A FLOWER is a very attractive object, most beau- tiful to the sight; often giving a grateful fragrance, as though it were conveying in that subtle manner a mysterious meaning of its worth and mission here. It germinates from a tiny seed, self-sown or otherwise, and springs into being an individual design, acknowl- edging itself a something in the natural world. A beautiful blossom wins our admiration and even love; we behold it expand to its acme of perfection, almost too lovely, because it has realized its all; for progress to mortals is the only incentive to activity of mind or body. With the full blossom every effort is over (we allude here to the flower-blossom alone, distinctive from anything that might follow), it can progress no farther, shortly after, deterioration com- mences. How sad we feel to see its lovely petals lose their freshness and wither and die away, as if all forgetful for our lavish care, seemingly ungrateful- of our love, depriving us of its perfume, and becom- ng a thing we soon cast afar from us; Associations 4S   &#xD;<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC7224-00000004"/> 2        )ELMWOOD, - OR, may occasionally lead us to preserve the lifeless rem- nants, but they are only emblems of what had been so full of loveliness, leaving ever a twilight memory in the heart. The sombreness of change shadows the spirit, and passing away seems the only memento whispered on the breeze, to be treasured by the senses. As the beautifully blooming flower springing from its seed in the ground, so from a thought-seed in the mind springs an individual fancy. To enable that to blossom, the soil of imagination is sought eagerly for, and the rich luxuriance of that agent causes often a natural curiosity, a monstrosity as botanists might term it, of exceeding beauty or magnificence. The extreme fertility of a wild imaginative soil sown, as is usually the case, broadcast with seeds, of Fancy, is generally choked by the variety of hobby- -weeds impossible to eradicate, as they are almost a concomitant of the ground itself. Seldom do we see this flower realizing its blossom, but if so, like its em- blem it must share the same fate, and once in full bloom, fades from that moment, and is as a thing neglected or worthless. The old but trite saying, "It is but fancy's sketch," teaches us that we cannot daguerreotype that flower of the mind, for its beauty is ideal, evanescent as a dream. Bright, beautiful Fancy! promising abundant love- liness, but fulfilling those promises most sparingly. Dark in the desolate mine gleams the glittering crystal, ever sparkling like truth in the heart, constant to its mission, though hid from all earthly eyes.   HELEN AND EMMA.       3 See the discovered diamond, found by an adven- turer on the coast of Africa, full of value, though rough and needing the lapidary's art to give it its true position among the gems of earth.  When finished off, how it astonishes by its brilliancy! How splendid, how planetary its light! We gaze and admire again and again. It is the same. It faileth never, but if possible, seems to outshine itself, as it cultivates and increases our delight and gratifi- cation iti beholding it. So like the diamond is Reason, that gem shedding planetary light over the immortal soul. It needeth when first discovered in the infant mind, to pass through the ordeal of time and common sense; once having taken - its true position, its brilliancy is established, so long as it retains its rightful kingdom, and reigns supreme over all the other faculties. We greet thee then, Reason! -intrinsic gem of the soul!,  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7224-00000005"/> 4        ELMWOOD,- OR,            CHAPTER II.  DID you ever attend a boarding-school, dear reader? If not, you may have known those who have passed through that-trial. Did not each person tell you of some sort of a frolic, or perchance, mischievous act, committed by friend or self during term-time? Were not there reminiscences of a varied nature also? each bearing the recognizing stamp of indi- vidual character, as the remembrance was brought  ] up to their mind, of their own peculiar view of the case? I once visited Miss S. Undertake's " finishing off" Academy for young ladies, where all the. higher  : branches of a collegiate course were attempted to be taught. She had a large number of pupils; most of them the daughters of wealthy men residing in a neighbor- ing city; occasionally a miss from the country might be found, sent by some rich parent or guardian friend. The location of this Seminary was delightful, so , much so, it must be described. On the banks of a river, sufficiently in the back ground to admit of a fine garden and lawn in front, : which latter gently sloped to the water's edge, stood' a large mansion of imposing appearance. It had   I;   HELEN AND EMMA.        5 wings on each side of the main building. Its archi- tecture was simple, but the length and breadth of the edifice attracted general notice. In the rear of the house was what seemed a youth- ful forest. Trees cultivated and self-sown were fast raising their heads in graceful umbrage, making a retreat in this grove delightful. An exceedingly large and ancient elm stood out prominent, near one side of the building, as if em- blematic of the aristocracy of the place, as a sentinel establishing its ancestry by incontrovertible proofs. The river was not at this point very wide, and from its opposite banks, almost frowning upon the pictu- resque scene, uprose several peaks of a mountainous range, adding grandeur also to the beautiful. The scenery was truly American; one of those rare spots seeming to combine a little of each of the orders of creation. To say the least, -then, Glenwood, or "Castle Love- ly " as some of the pupils had cognomened it, had a certain advantage in its fascinating locality. Perhaps this was one cause that attracted a num- ber to the place; but a greater one, was Miss Under- take's fashionable notoriety. She had overseen the education of the daughters of such and such a millionaire; and of course, our daughters " must " finish off" there, to be considered properly educated. The recitation rooms were in one wing of the building. Many were the rules for the observance of the young ladies, both as regarded their studies and general deportment. 1  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7224-00000006"/> 6      - ELMWOD, -- OR, Teachers of fashionable music, drawing and dancing, also those for foreign languages, were employed. But Miss S. Undertake was the principal. She was the architect of the. peculiar educational system, which she termed, " her own method." Possessed of some elegance and dignity in man- ner, attentive to all the little idealities of etiquette, and a certain style,- also a woman of some beauty, she attracted attention to herself, giving an impression hat the inner cultivation of the heart and mind fol- owed, as of necessity. Unfortunately, this was a sad mistake r Miss Undertake's parents were English persons who had been wealthy; but leaving her an orphan at a very early age, a lawsuit, unsettled at the time of her father's decease, swallowed up a greater part of the property. This affair never had been, or was likely to be, adjusted to the satisfaction of all parties. Her available property was small. She came to America at the age of twenty-five, and through the influence of powerful friends, was enabled to lease the building above described, commencing with a few pupils, her now distinguished Academy. The persons who aided her, had been acquaintances of her parents in their days of prosperity, and re- ceived attentions from them while in a foreign land. Miss Undertake had been taught in a fashionable school abroad, and of course pursued a similarity of method in her mode of instruction,--though a revi- sion of some matters, and her precise rules regarding affairs (being of a systematic turn), led her to abso- lutely believe she had established an individualized   HELEN AND EMMA.       7 order of education. Her success was great,- and this added to her self-reliance on her own opinions. Innovation in any form on Miss Undertake's course of instruction, or a question concerning the maturity of her judgment, was looked upon little less than a deep insult to herself. Some very few parents or friends having attempt- ed a remonstrance concerning a number of her regu- lations, were silenced with a decided answer,- "That she must strictly adhere to her peculiar system." All Miss Undertake's pupils must pursue the same course, engaging in studies and accomplishments for which many of them had neither intellect or taste to render them at all beneficial. A certain amount of knowledge must be forced into some cavity of the cerebrum, if, as was often the case, it only remained sufficiently long to give a correct answer for the-time then present, not so wise teaching as learning a par- rot, for they remember what they cannot understand. The human. mind is so noble and great in its natural demands, that it -spurns and casts aside of its own accord what only lightly grazes its surface. It calls for more respect to ensure us its availability. Miss Undertake had never interpreted intellectual philosophy; she had committed to memory pages of words on that subject, but she was wholly unac- quainted with what those very words meant to convey. -Poor little emblems of ideas! Who has not at times felt the inadequacy of words to portray an iota of our meaning; and yet often what wonderful agents they are for good or evil. % e':.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7224-00000007"/> 8        ELMWQOD, - OR, But not to be too prosy. You will understand me when I say, if Miss Undertake had all the letters of the alphabet to educate, from Miss A to Miss Z, notwithstanding, all the different forms and in- intentions of those letters, each one must go through the same purgatory, expecting the same results. If this course could be adhered to, who would recognize Miss W in the drapery of Miss O? Would not one be wholly lost in the other, and be deprived of its individuality? - Is not this a fault? Should not the shape of the mind be consulted, its natural tastes, in a measure, speak for themselves; making the instruction a neces- sary attainment to satisfy one's own desires, and not looked upon, (as in some cases,) as if it were a great bore or hardship? It seems unkind to call a boy or girl a dunce, or stupid, or to say such an one can never learn; she or he, has no taste for study. Thus because the unfortunate pupil cannot readily, or at once, shine in all spheres, he is denied the right of having any little sphere of his own, in which he may be most useful; giving a concentrated light outshining by far the scintillating brilliancy of the genius for all things. It seems certainly, after elementary instruction has been sufficiently impressed upon the mind, that Miss A's reason should be complimented at least to know if she would like to have her own personality dis- guised in the fancy garb of Miss Z? The heart must be truly educated in order to enable teachers to know the wants of each pupil committed *      / 5' 9    HELEN AND EMMA.          9 to their care; winning the confidence of this agent, we find the object we search for, it betrays itself into acknowledgment of its necessities and inclinations.

Is not that a pretty sight, those young lovely crea- tures dancing upon the greensward, under the shade of that ancient elm? Intermission, nature triumphant-for a few moments, as the teachers hold a conclave for consultation at this hour. Beautiful Helen Lyle! radiant almost in that beauty, - graceful in every movement, - enthusiastic in each expression, as if life buoyed thee on its surface.              - Fair girl! sunlight spreads out her wings and bears thee upward! Can it always be sunshine, if not, what will be thy fate? Pretty girls are Jenny Pell and Louise Welford; little butterflies flying from one object to another, sipping sweets from all around. All are pretty, Is not youth always admissible of some grace or beauty? Who is that just coming from the grove with' book in hand? Look! even now a shadowy mantle seems to be wrapt around her from the surrounding trees. She is out of the wood; as she approaches nearer, how increasingly lovely she seems. "Is not Emma Elliott beautiful when you see her   HELEN AND EMMA.       1l near by?" said little Carrie Lee, the pet of the school as she was the youngest; being only twelve years of age. A very sweet girl she was too; all attempts to render her a fashionable Miss, had as yet been un- successful at home. Therefore she was sent to Miss Undertake; hoping that lady could restrain, if not wholly change, the natural beauty of the child's honest nature. Mrs. Lee said, "Carrie was too wild; that she laughed immoderately, and was too unreserved in her expression of right or wrong." Mr. and Mrs. Lee wished these faults removed. They wanted a-child of twelve years to have the manners of a girl at twenty. But nature triumphed, whenever an opportunity could be found, it overcame all obstacles, and the silvery laugh so harmonious and true, like the sound of falling water upon a warm summer's day, came gratefully to the ear. Carrie Lee had her faults; but the above we do not consider unpardonable sins. Again she repeated her question: "Is not Emma Elliott beautiful?" addressing her- self this time to Helen Lyle. "Yes," said Helen, " she is pretty, but so prosy; and then such a book-worm, a real moth gnawing the pages of literature. For my part I should as soon think of reading my future in the stars, as opening a book, (or a school book, I may say,) unless actually obliged to. When I spoke the other day to Emma, asking her, how she could endure to study so? she replied,' It was pastime to her, she was so  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7224-00000009"/> 12       ELMWOOD,-- OR, fond of acquiring knowledge and educing compari- sons between men and things, cause and effect, nature and art in their multiform changes.' Only think, girls, what notions for a young lady seventeen years of age! For my part I do not care to trouble myself about anything' that I can avoid. It is hard enough to be compelled to study so many hours each day. But let me speak to Emma, for the sage cometh hither." "Come, Emma Elliott," said Carrie Lee, "'the girls are all talking about you. Come up and defend your wisdom!" "Here I am, though I must confess, I cannot de- fend what I do not possess."' "What makes you carry an abominable book round with you?'" said the pertinacious Carrie. "Yes," added Helen, " are you so much in love with those printed pages, that you must ever have some of them in your hand?" "Now, dear Helen, listen a moment. You see this sweet wild-flower with its pretty pink blossom?" asked Emma. "Oh! beautiful! beautiful!" exclaimed several voices, " where did you find it?" ( I must have some for my hair," said Helen. "And I, to mingle in with my white Jasmine wreath," said Jenny Pell. -"Do tell me where to find nmore. We cannot wait," impatiently urged Carrie Lee. "In a damp spot in yonder grove. I will show you the place girls. But have none of you curiosity to know its name and habits?" inquired Emma.   -HELEN AND EMMA.      13 "Pray how should we know," said Louise Wel- ford. "I do not care for its name, if I can only get some for my hair," added Helen, " you remember we re- ceive visitors to-morrow." '"Do you know what it is Emma," said Carrie Lee. "I for one should -like to know, for I will press some for my Aunt Jane, who loves flowers dearly." "It is the Arethusa," answered Emma. "What a name! but how did you find it out, lady sage?" "I happened to have taken my Botany with me to-day, so I consulted my book ; and when I found the flower I compared it with various descriptions of plants, until I found the one answering perfectly to my pretty blossom; and that was the Arethusa. I think I shall never forget it in future. So you see books are companions sometimes and tell you secrets." "We have but five minutes more, so do come with us to find the   ,what do you term it?" said Helen Lyle.  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7224-00000010"/> "       ELMWOOD, -- OR, CHAPTER IV. WE will now visit the recitation rooms of Miss Undertake. How changed the deportment of the young ladies we were introduced to upon the green- sward; how automaton like each sits. In uniform position are they, all so quiet. Carrie Lee's laughing eyes are still roaming round, often disturbing the im- posed gravity of the others by her ridiculous grimaces. In vain is she lectured, " she cannot help it," she says, and she speaks pretty nearly the truth. Miss Undertake complains of Louise Welford, as she overhears her music lesson. "You do not try to sing, Miss Welford. Your voice is harsh and dis- sonant. You do not give any credit to Madame Schmidt, you are so obstinate in your determination not to sing." "( Why, Miss Undertake, I never could sing," said Louise, ' only in the nursery, and even then the nurse entreated me to cease that dreadful noise. I cannot positively see the use of my practising the scale daily, I do not improve, because really I have not the least taste for music, and cannot tell if I sing right or wrong. I can only imitate for a moment a sound, but can never recall any air I ever heard. I do 'not seem to distinguish one tune from another.   HELEN AND EMAIA.      15 I certainly wish, Miss Undertake, that I might never hear music mentioned again, in connection with myself." "It was your mother's particular desire, Miss Wel- ford, great attention should be paid this branch; she said you had sadly neglected your-music; and as one of my pupils, she knew you would be obliged to go through a regular course of instruction. You do not show so bad a disposition concerning your drawing lessons." "I like to draw," answered Louise, "I do find some pleasure there, and I can draw a tree that does not look like a horse, and a house that does not re- semble a man. But in this intolerable music, I never know what I am about, for I have neither taste, time, or tune for it. If I mean to sing A, I am as likely to sing G, and B for E. It does not l'eave the least impression on my mind; and if ever I do sing right, it is by chance." "Let me hear nothing farther of this kind," replied Miss Undertake, " if I do not discover signal itn- provement, some of your recreation hours must be devoted to the study. Your family are wealthy and fashionable, and what would people say, if you were not musical? It is decidedly the fashion now-a-days to be very fond of music." Miss Undertake glides away and, passes into the room where drawing is taught. "What can be done with Miss Parker?" said Signor Guido to the principal. ("Just look at her sketch book, if you please. It offends my eye to teach her.

Thinking she must    I have some imagination to discover any resemblance to her copy in her own sketches, I directed her to color one of my drawings, I wish you could have seen her taste. The trees were all one shade of  brilliant green, the house red, and the ground literally  yellow; with a great patch of indigo for the sky.  What can I do with her?  "There is Miss Pell, who colors beautifully. Then  Miss Lyle, she has a natural taste for drawing. She not only takes correct copies but sketches from  nature; and being imaginative in reality, colors with  equal skill. What can be done with Miss Parker?"  "Let her go on, I will reprimand her for her inat-  tention." "But she is tery attentive and well-disposed, though  she cannot even imitate correctly."  "I will see that she is impressed with the impor-  tance of this accomplishment in a&amp; lady of fashion. She is heiress to the rich banker, Bentley, and must  not disgrace Miss Undertake's seminary.  "Miss Parker, please come to me. Your teacher  complains of your ill success in drawing." "Yes, ma'am, I dislike it much, because I cannot  succeed. If he gives me formula, I can then make an exact copy, but without it my pencil plays antics  in its attempts to delineate." "You must be more heedful, pay a strict regard to all Signor Guido says." "He is out of patience at the beginning ma'am, and says I have neither taste or talent, and can never learn."   HELEN AND EMMA.       17 "That should not be. He must encourage you. I hope to hear better accounts of you soon. Drawing is a necessary accomplishment in a young lady of your standing, and must be acquired." On to the dancing hall proceeded Miss Undertake. Imagine her surprise, to see a foolish simper lurking on the faces of Monsieur Louis Caperelle's pupils. In vain the young Misses tried to smooth down their faces into sombre mood. She too soon became aware of the cause of this excitement; had her courage allowed her. to have smiled, she could have done so heartily, but her risibles were schooled into subjection. In the centre of the room stood Monsieur Louis, violin in hand, with all the ardor of his nation, teach- ing the grace of motion. Keeping time on his cue were Miss Carrie Lee's lajge red bows taken from the braids of her hair. Some of the young ladies coming into the hall unex- pectedly, found poor Monsieur asleep. In a moment Carrie Lee's bows were transferred to the French- man's wig. As one and another came in, he awoke; and, without a dream of his ridiculous aspect, pro- ceeded at once in his lesson. He rebuked them for  their mirthfulness and want of politeness in their behavior. Miss Undertake requested the young ladies to be seated, as she wished to confer with Monsieur in the ante-room; in the meanwhile, they were to remain  very quiet.  She had some business with Monsieur, and took this opportunity of transactingit. She also removed 2* *           -       , .

As she returned to the general assembly room and dismissed the pupils, she requested the second class in dancing to remain. The members of this class expected a severe repri- mand, and some deprivation of their pleasure; but before Miss Undertake commenced what she had -to say, Carrie Lee was at her side. "Allow me to speak, Miss Undertake," said Carrie, "I am the guilty one. The others are not to blame, but how could they help laughing? I suppose it was wrong, but Monsieur was so sound asleep, and his head hanging on his arm over the chair, I could not resist pinning on my bows. I will try to do better, but it was so funny! I expect I must be punished, but do excuse the others." "  Hush, Miss Lee, you are incorrigible!

HELEN LYE'S parents were in the prime of life; possessed of abundant wealth, and high in station. She was their only child; and all the foolish excesses of fashion's hydra-headed termagant were made sub- servient to Helen's will, if she chose their aid. They were good persons in the main; but the artificial veil of excessive etiquette disguising the mother so con- stantly, shrouded the natural emotions. It was only by some unconscious magnetic influence, betraying real human nature, one could be made aware that a common human heart did really pulsate in the lady's polished form. A magnificent city residence for the winter, a suburban palace for summer, (when the months were not employed in travelling,) made a variety in, life very agreeable to the Lyles; especially, when Helen returned from "Castle Lovely," or Glenwood. It may seem strange that such a mother should have felt it possible to part with her only child; but to her mind it was a necessary arrangement, prepara- tory to her daughter's entrance as one in the great whirlpool of fashionable notoriety.

When the diplomas were awarded at the close of the term it was a fecte day for the pupils, and ended with music and dancing in the evening. This year, Miss Helen Lyle had reached the climax of Miss Undertake's systematic course. She was to represent herself as an article " finished off ' from that storehouse of knowledge; armed with full conscious- ness of her supreme powers, to prove which she held the patent right of scholarship bestowed upon her, and signed by the veritable Miss Satisfactory Undertake herself. Let me introduce this episode, for what a peculiar name, our fair principal had considered it for her best good, so long to exempt from change. She had been born a few months after her father's lawsuit commenced; and Mr. Undertake, having a natural distaste for business, would daily make answer to his lawyers, "Oh! arrange it satisfactory to your own ideas, and it will be satisfactory to me." This gentleman suffered much from gout, and dread- ed the daily details of a complex case. His solicitor came at a regular hour; and. when in an irritable mood, he would merely repeat the word satisfactory;  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7224-00000014"/> 22       ELMWOOD, -- OR, requesting his immediate withdrawal, as he cared not for the circumlocutory arguments, pro and con. One day the mnurse, with her honest countenance full of smiles, knocked aa. the door of Mr. Undertake's private apartment. Itwas the very hour- for Mr. Evasion to produce his customary documents. But the good woman knew it not, neither did she re- member it was the day for the chronic malady to increase the sufferings of her master. "Sir," exclaimed the delighted nurse, coming into the room; " your lady holds a lovely babe in her arms. What shall she be called? It is a little girl." Scarcely had she commenced speaking, before the' word, "Satisfactory," was uttered again and again. "A long name, sir, I fear I cannot remember it, please --" At this instant Mr. Evasion, seeing the door open, came in. The anger of the choleyic man, made most distracted by his complaint, was at its height, as he caught sight of the book tied with red tape. "Satisfactory! and now and forever, let me hear no more of it." This he said with a tremendous effort, his -voice straining at the highest pitch I Anger is an elemental part of the painful disease he was afflicted with. The nurse rushed hastily up stairs, repeating this word, syllable by syllable, Sat-Is-Fac-To-Ry. "What a name," said the woman, " and he was so determined it should be the dear little baby's.

Mrs. Undertake's health failed perceptibly, and a few days after the birth of her infant, she died, with- out hearing the name, as the nurse thought, bestowed upon her child. His wife's death aroused Mr. Undertake, and then he became aware that he was father to a female child. He was disappointed in its sex, and gave orders to the housekeeper, to have it removed to some place where it could be nursed and taken proper care of, sparing no expense. Thus Miss Satisfactory Under- take was baptized by her guardians. Her father went abroad, and died less than a year after his wife, en- trusting the young orphan to his brother's care, with a good round sum for the fashionable education of his child. The remaining property was involved, as we have have before said in this lawsuit, the circum- stances of which gave the piquant name to one, who seemed to recognize its adaptation.

She was the child of a relative of Mr. Elliott's, and was con- signed to his care. A widower, having only one son, after a few years he had adopted Emma as his daughter. She gave promise in early childhood of a superior mind. She was very gentle and somewhat reserved in her manner. She had received instruc- tion from her governess at home, and endeavored to make an application of what she learned. She was not satisfied, unless she could thoroughly understand what was attempted to be taught her. Mr. Elliott thought her progress too slow, and feel- ing sure of her native talent, he was wont to blame her instructress for a want of zeal. He resolved Emma should go to Miss Undertake, and pass through four years at her establishment. Had Emma been more accustomed to society of her own age, this might have been agreeable news to her; but habituated to solitary communion with her books, she already felt their quiet companionship, and a reluctance to leave her home. But she knew the wishes of him who had been so kind to her must become paramount to all inclinations of her own, so   HELEN AND EMMA.     - 25 she became an inmate at Glenwood, at the age of thirteen. Mr. Elliott had business abroad. He was going to take his son with hirr, that he might have the ad- vantages of travel, under favorable circumstances. He expected to be gone from three to four years. Henry Elliott was a noble looking lad of sixteen, when he went to Europe. He was not strong, for his severe love of study had impaired his general health. His father hoped, if possible, to rest his brain, and give a change to his pursuits; and thought great improvement in his health would be the con- sequence. Henry was of an ardent temperament; yet manly self-restraint gave dignity to his manner, and at his early age commanded, involuntarily, the respect of all around him. He regarded his sister with tender care, as if he also was, in a measure, her protector. He had been absent from home at school, and saw Emma only during his vacations. He felt no envy or unkindness toward her for gaining a place in his remaining parent's heart. Emma Elliott was so inoffensive, and so thought- ful of others, it was impossible for any one to regard her with coldness. She had completed her course at Glenwood, and earnestly hoped her father and brother would arrive at home in season to attend the closing exercises of the Seminary, and the ball in the evening. Her wish was gratified; she received a letter stating their return, and intention to be at Glenwood in the course of the week.

HELEN AND EMMA.        27 CHAPTER VII. THE great day had arrived. The general assembly room at Glenwood Academy was finely decorated by the taste of the pupils. Miss Undertake permitted quite a latitude of action for the two preceding days. Bouquets of beautiful flowers decorated the various teachers' desks. Before the throne of the principal, (as the girls- styled the lofty seat elevated two feet above the other teachers in the centre of one side of the room,) upon that desk stood a lovely white Bohemian glass vase on a silver salver; this vase was filled with white camellia japonicas. It was the parting gift of the senior class to Miss Satisfactory Undertake, as the inscription on the salver told. Wreaths of sweet wild flowers hung around the room. Festoons were over the globes, maps, and blackboards,- even these generally despised things were garlanded, bespeaking the joy of a release for a season, from all such types. of Miss Undertake's system. "Dear me!" said that wilful Carrie Lee, goin; into the room to view it for the last time before the company were admitted, "How beautiful the flowers \ o  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7224-00000017"/> 28       ELMWOOD, -- OR, are! But who suggested the white camellia for Miss Undertake's vase?" "It must have been Emma Elliott, for she wishes always appropriateness in all she does," said Louise Welford. "Miss Elliott could not finish a sentence without a why or a wherefore in some way appended," in- terrupted Miss Envyly, "I do dislike pedantic girls. I am glad they will never be the fashion, for I should spurn to follow out all I said with a reason why I said it." "It would be hard indeed, because you might search a long while for such a commodity," replied Miss Caustic. "Fancy runs a great race in her chase after Reason, and is often annihilated in the attempt to embrace it." "I do not think, Miss Envyly, you can give a good reason for disliking Emma Elliott," said Carrie, (- she is so kind to all. -But who placed those japonicas there? I am sure it was some one who recognized their significance to our principal." ("Your reason, Miss, for the same?" said Julia Caustic. "Or are you also a fancy delineator?" "They are so cold, and chaste, and exact," quickly replied the young girl; " no graceful fragrance to make them loveable. I admire them; but they are always the same. I could never love them. The dear sweet-briar-buds we wear as the juvenile class, are so affectionate in their twining gracefulness, and so very sweet, they win our hearts at once. But how like the camellia is Miss Undertake!" 4 This you call reasoning," dryly answered Miss         .   HELEN AND EIMMA.      29 Caustic. is I should say ' it was but Fancy's sketch,' after all, for you have an idea of similitude in your own mind, but no proof that another drew the same conclusion, which was the thing to be demon- strated." "Hark! there is the bell for the pupils to meet to- gether up stairs," said Carrie. In half an hour the visitors were seated in the assembly room, awaiting the entrance of teachers and pupils. A band of music was stationed at one end of the large apartment, and had already commenced play- ing. When the colored servant (just at the right mo- ment) opened the door, (having been signalized before,) in came Miss Undertake, robed in a rich dress of black India satin, high in the neck, setting forth her fine figure to great advantage. A collar and sleeves of most expensive Malta lace, completed her attire., Her dark hair, naturally profuse and wavy, was adorned with a single camellia japonica. Following the principal came the other teachers, each in costume after their own particular taste or ability; then the young ladies composing the senior class, all dressed in simple white muslin with wreaths of myrtle around their heads, chaste and lovely as a pleasant dream they appeared. This class was seated in front of the principal. The junior class followed, also in white dresses, but rose colored girdles circled their waist, and- blush roses coquettishy garlanded their heads. Next came the sophomores, in robes of delicate 8$  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7224-00000018"/> 30       ELMWOOD, -- OR, blue crape, with wreaths of white jasmine on their hair, and bracelets of the same upon their arms. The juvenile or preparatory class closed the proces- sion; they wore dresses made of the palest rose-colored crape; their young heads circled with the infantine sweet-briar rose; also, looping up the short sleeves, was the eglantine, we would hope bereft of its thorns. Even .the most lovely object in animate creation will have its drawhack represented by a thorn, or its sem- blance. Why not inanimate objects also? Reason may be the thorn of Fancy, and vice versa. But we are running away from our subject, and Miss Caustic will censure us severely. The exercises of the day commenced, and con- cluded to the satisfaction of those present. The examination, of course, was short, questions having been prepared, and their answers committed before- hand to memory. Each parent or interested friend, thought their own particular charge, a protege of wisdom; as well as the loveliest in person, amid the ranks. All seemed in a happy state of mind, for there was no competi- tion; great tact was displayed, that the dullest should appear equally well with the most naturally gifted and studious. This was part of Miss Undertake's peculiar system. The awarding of the diplomas followed, each young lady courtesying gracefully, as she received the imposingf evidence of her attainments. This over, in a short but pertinent address to those leaving her establishment permanently, and a farewell for a sea-   HELEN AND EMMA.       31 son, to her other pupils, Miss Undertake relinquished her discipline. The remainder of the day and evening belonged to the scholars, without restraint from her- self. Miss Undertake having removed the ban of her authority, nature resumed her right, laughing from many a youthful face rejoiced to have that agent re- stored to its original possession, on their countenances and in their hearth. Most brilliantly illuminated was the hall for the dance. Brothers, and other friends of the masculine sex were there, ready to participate in the festivities of the occasion. Into more than one heart that evening, Fancy glided softly and introduced a new feature, an ideal of the love element. Young heads were intoxicated with the ardor of their unaccustomed joy. To some this was an eventful era; but to others, an episode only in the daily routine of life. Music, dancing and a fine supper ended the festive scene. Then followed the painful adieu from those not expecting to return. All boarding-school young ladies have experienced that sad regret occasioned by a like cause. We must also bid farewell to Miss Undertake and, her beautifiul location at Glenwood. With some of her pupils we may continue our intercourse, and be" come better acquainted.  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7224-00000019"/> 32       XELMWOOD, - OR, CHAPTER VIII. EMMA ELLIOTT was now seventeen years of age. Having left school, her adopted father wished her to assume the position of lady of his house and its responsibilities. Henry was to return to Cainbridge, as he had one year more to remain in college, ere he entered the Law School. Emma was so mature in mind -and manner, that she gracefully and readily oc- cupied her assigned place in the family. She devoted some hours of each day to reading and reflection. She was fond of music, though not to excess, but Mr. Elliott was so extremely attached to that art, she en- deavored to cultivate her taste, and played and sang very sweetly, though not by any means with great skill. Mr. Elliott had business cares to attend to, both foreign and home concerns, involving large risks on his part to enable him to control the immense amount of commercial influence to which he had been accus- tomed. He had adjusted agreeably his affairs abroad and hoped to have enjoyed more rest oil his return again to his native land. But the great zeal for spec- ulative interest among men in the same line of busi- ness as himself, made him restless and discontented unless in the midst of the rushing tide of the monley- making world. He was now sixty years of age, and i    '   *   HELEN AND EMMA.      33 had passed through life with honor always emblazoned on his shield. He was an excellent citizen and an influential member of society. He felt great relief in having such a prudent and lovely-young house- keeper in his adopted child, and wholly abandoned his household concerns to her own control. Fortunate- ly she was. worthy such carte-blanche considerations; though, of course, somewhat inexperienced in the exercise of her faculties on like subjects. Emma Elliott's heart was educated early by her own dear mother, who was a woman of intrinsic worth, and who lived long enough to implant the seeds of virtue in her child's breast. The instruction thus bestowed coming from the natural fount, flowed on in ceaseless course. The remembrance of her fond parent was fresh in Emma's mind, though she died when her little girl was but ten years of age. Yet the child often recalled the precepts, and more - than all, the example her mother presented to her, endeavoring to imitate in a measure, what. she thought would afford most pleasure were she per- mitted her mother's companionship on earth. Thus early called upon to pass through the shady side of life, she felt the heart alone to be the only true spot where eternal sunshine could continue, and that only by seeing the " silver lining " to each passing cloud, recognizing all trials befalling us, as hidden blessings, conveying true joy under their mysterious mantles. Henry Elliott returned the day after they left Glen- wood to Cambridge, for the term had already com- menced. What did he think of his adopted sister? In -parting from  Emma to go abroad, Henry  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7224-00000020"/> L 34       ELMWOOD --OR, - thought of her only as a quiet little girl that gave his father pleasure. On meeting her at Glenwood, where she was presented by Mr. Elliott to him, he was taken entirely by surprise. Was this beautiful young- lady his adopted sister? So rapid is the change in the last few years of girlhood, as that finally bids farewell, an'd imperceptibly the maiden blushes into true womanhood. Henry Elliott was almost sorry his sister was so lovely. And why? - he really could not tell. What was Emma's beauty? Regular features, she had not. Very large and strikingly expressive orbs? No. Wavy masses of hair bound round her classic head? Not one of these, and yet she was exceed- ingly lovely. She did have dark blue eyes, with long silken fringes, almost concealing their hidden depths, where the soul-spring was mysteriously sending forth its magnetic attraction. Brown hair combed smoothly down arranged in bands in front, and carelessly but neatly disposed on the back of the head. A most expressive mouth revealing in its sweetness, its inti- macy and harmony with the same spirit that beamed from the eves. It was the beauty of soul, making radiant all the earthly casement, an indescribable attraction one could never repel. Emma had not a feature, bereft of this peculiar charm, that could be compared to Helen Lyle's. Yet though all acknowl- edged the extreme loveliness of Helen, you looked upon her, and forgot all but that she was a queen of beauty. Emma's face was never forgotten, it sent forth an influence, making you even feel a little reflected beauty dawning upon yourself, for its innate   HELEN AND EMMA.        35 sweetness had left the impression that truth, in spite of all our heedlessness or repulsiveness, always leaves upon the human heart.

"HELEN has ' finished off' at Glenwood," said the delighted mother to one of her fashionable coterie. "She is charmed to be at home again, and we an- ticipate much pleasure, as she will come out this winter." "Ah! indeed, so I supposed," said Mrs. Firstnews. ," What a sensation she will create. She is decidedly a belle; and, of course, very accomplished ; she must be, having been a pupil of the celebrated Miss: Un- dertake." "She plays and sings divinely, I must say," said the proud mother. "You must certainly hear her, Mrs. Firstnews." "Thank you, dear madam, I should be so happy. I adore music." "I believe my daughter is at home, and will send for her to come down." At her mother's summons, Miss Helen glided into the room; not yet wholly spoilt, but in the dawn of affectation. Extremely delicate were the few words she gave utterance to. 1"How d'ye do, Mrs. Firstnews, your daughters do not accompany you. I regret their absence." "Do you remember themn, my dear?  They are several years older than yourself."   HELEN AND EMMA,      37 "Certainly, as friends of Mamma." "Are you equally as kind to all your mother's ac- quaintances? Many will be glad to be remembered by so lovely a young lady as Miss Helen Lyle." "Thank you, Madam, you are too complimentary." "Oh no! Your blush is exquisitely becoming." "Do I really blush? Miss Undertake would be shocked, she forbade our blushing. She said ' edu- cated persons should control all emotion.- What could an unsophisticated peasant do but blush and reveal her feelings to the beholder. It was a milkmaid's peculiar privilege to blush, and we must show our superiority over the plebeian, by never feel- ing, or at least giving evidence of our surprise to others.'" "Indeed! How excellent your memory is. Are you as conversant on all subjects as this, relating to mere personality?" "Titis, my dear Madam, made a lasting impression upon my mind, because I had the erroneous habit of blushing, and was often reprimanded for it. I really hoped I had overcome the evil. I have been improv- ing for some time past." Will- you favor me by playing the piano?" "With pleasure. Will you have Italian, German, Spanish, or English compositions?" "Suit your own taste, my dear."' "Play that exquisite little waltz, by Strauss, that I admire so much, Helen," said Mrs. Lyle. "Oh lovely! tfiat is very fine. Do you not sing?" asked Mrs. Firstnews.

Helen paid more attention to music than to any other accoml- plishment; she really enjoyed it, and in this art she- triumphed. Mrs. Firstnews was full of enthusiasm. This was all that Miss Helen was called upon to display, (ex- cept herself,) so the lady departed with the impression that for once an only daughter could be both beau- tiful and accomplished. She made various other calls that day, entertaining every one with the beauty and grace of Miss Lyle, and the great sensation she must create. She would reign supreme belle of their circle the coming winter. Some heard with pleasure any news, for a change; others, more especially mothers of four or five blooming daughters, looked more gravely upon the subject. Mrs. Firstnews having exhausted herself as well as her topic, retired to her own home where she might rest, ere she undertook a fresh excursion. Helen Lyle came out, and was truly successful in individualizing herself as the new star of the fashion- able sphere around her. She was hurried from one engagement to another, as if in the course of a few months she must be initiated into every variety, and dissipate all the novelty of life; leaving her a prey to ennui when the season was over for all this excite- ment. Mrs. Lyle fancied she lived life over again in her   HELEN AND EMMA.        39 daughter's success.

She was subjected to great exposure, as she often walked many miles in the most inclem- ent weather, with insufficient apparel, to obtain slop- work, as it is termed, from the neighboring village stores. With her mother she had sat daily, sewing from daylight until the sunset hour, and whenever light could be obtained; it was often midnight before their task could be accomplished. The exertion was altogether too much for her tender age to endure, and she now suffers the consequence. "Mrs. Domett is an honest, good-minded woman, but her condition is very unfortunate. She is warned to leave her house, (or rather room,) because she cannot pay the rent due for the last quarter, of the miserable shed over her. Her child is too ill to be re- moved, even had she a shelter to take her to; and her distress is very great. She- is urgent for work but cannot beg; there seems a natural and wholesome pride about the family. "With your permission, my dear sir, I wish to know if I may give a portion of the money you gave me for my personal expenses, for their present relief? And then I have one more request, also, to make." "Where does this poor woman live, my dear? You say you are convinced of her truth and hon-e esty?" "I am, most certainly, sir; I am acquainted with some persons who have known them for more than two years, and all of them speak of their industry and neatness.

'6 It is a sad case, dear Emma. Devote one-third of your own money to the immediate necessities of this poor widow and her family, and here is double that sum to be added to it. It will allow Mrs. Domett to pay her hard-hearted landlord his rent." "Oh, sir! I thank you most sincerely." "I wish you to use your own money, in part, that you may feel somewhat the pleasure of denying yourself for the benefit of others; thereby increasing the happiness of both parties." "You are always considerate of my good, sir." "Now for the other request. We have but twenty minutes more at present." "It is this, sir; do not deem me too forward, but I  do so feel the necessity of some change in the ar- rangement called slop-work. You must know, sir, (and I have it from good authority,) that the merchants in these village stores go to the city, and there con- tract and obtain an agency, agreeing to have such an amount of work done for so much money. They then return home and article-out these goods to per- sons to be made for almost nothing; each garment finished, conveying great interest into the merchant's pocket. I have heard, sir, some of these men have neglected their former line of business, and found this so profitable as to thrive wholly on the prqceeds thus gained." This is new to me; explain more minutely, my dear, concerning this slop-work, as you term it," said Mr. Elliott. : 1   HELEN AND EMMA.       43 "I will, sir; first let me say the little pay received by these persons so employed, is seldom given to them in money. They must take their due in goods from the merchant's store; oftentimes, very inferior articles; and a second profit is thus made by the men who charge the usual prices for articles of a better .kind. I hope, sir, there are many exceptions to this hard statement, but I have been informed this is generally the case." "For the honor of humanity I hope you are mis- taken in your information. But go on, I am much interested." "Well, sir, for instance, a calico shirt is required to be made for fourpence. A pair of drawers for a less sum. Woollen pantaloons for twenty-five cents, the latter is considered the most profitable work; though it very often takes more than a day, to make them as required to be done. These garments must be finished at a given time, to enable the merchant to perform his contract. The small sum paid for the work, leads some persons employed, to slight the sewing so much, that wearing the garment more than once, is impossible without sundry loop-holes betray- ing themselves in all parts of the article. Those who have too much principle, to do their work lightly; (and I fear there are very few,) find it almost impos- sible to support themselves by this method. "To show you, sir, the idea persons generally have of slop-work, I will relate an anecdote. A little girl, of good family, was reproved by her mother for sew- ing some patch-work improperly.

"This is really a bad business. What can be donq to remedy the evil?" "I hope something may transpire to change the present system. This is an unfortunate concern in a two-fold measure; for not only do the poor feel obliged to grasp at even this little to obtain their food, but they are led to deceive, and deceive others; for these garments, I am told, are sold at a decent price to poor sailors and adventurers, - for the first contractor must get his profit, above what he gives the village agent. Thus the deceived purchaser bargains for a made garment, and finds to his dismay it is little better than a flag or sail-cloth; ,unfit for use, without entire renovation."- "How did you' discover all this, my child?  "From visiting the poor, and listening to the re- ports of others who had done likewise. Oh! sir, I sometimes think, if one could only see the weary, worn-out females that are so often brought to the grave in their struggles for a decent livelihood, - if one could be an eye-witness of each hard trial, en-- countered to obtain the bare subsistence of life, they would improve the condition of these persons, by paying them adequately for their virtuous endeavors, and urging the same upon others." "We must speak of this again, Emma, but five minutes of our time remains." "Allow me to make one more statement. It is said, a person may obtain a quantity of this work from the   HELEN AND EMMA.       45 first contractor, if they can give a guarantee for their' honesty, and its safe return; also, by coming for the goods and bringing them back in due season. Thus, they must necessarily go to the city to do this. As we shall be in town several days, could we not pro- cure some for Mrs. Domett? She would be so grate- ful, and receive so much more for her labor, as only one profit would be made from her toil." "I will endeavor to comply with this request, and you shall be her trustee; I am glad you have the love of benevolence. Now give me a proof you have also the love of complacency sufficient to bestow upon me a daughter's kiss." "There, sir, it is done. And I must now haste away, for the half hour is on its last seconds."

"Now that we are comfortably on our way to the city, my daughter," said Mr. Elliott, "we will renew the conversation we had a few hours since.  "Having some unoccupied time after my arrange- ments were completed for our absence, and accident- ally meeting our philanthropic friend, Mr. Ellis, I mentioned the purport of your remarks to him. He presented the matter in a new light to me." "How, sir, am I mistaken in my opinions?" asked Emma. "Not exactly, my dear; but let me repeat his state- ments to you." "Thank you, sir, I am anxious to hear them." "He said this work was originally intended for the poorer portion of society; persons dependant on its receipts for their daily bread. When that class had the work to themselves, better remuneration was made them, but of late years the work had, in a great mea- sure, passed into the hands of another part of the population." "Indeed, sir," said Emma, " this is new also to me."  "Daughters of farmers and mechanics," continued Mr. Elliott, " men well to do in the world, who can   HELEN AND EMMA.       47 afford comfortable homes and good board for their children, but not extra fancy clothing, or like wants, not belonging to the strictly necessary. These per- sons having some leisure time, and not feeling any of the agonies of want, were willing to work for small compensation, and the great demand for the work by this class reduced the price of labor to the low me- dium now established. They thus usurp the bread- money of the poor to enable them to decorate in more gay attire their persons or their homes." "Is it so, dear sir? I cannot think they are aware of this circumstance." "I presume not, as a general thing. But it seems to me, the improvement should be made in this quarter. Owing to the good arrangement of our laws and the high moral principle ever holding sway over the usages of civilized society, as also to the natural humanity of the human heart, we have greatly reduced the number of the very poor in our midst, especially in our villages and small towns. Yet there are among us, my child, and daily coming to our shores, human beings, and poor helpless human mothers .with infants clinging to their breasts, friend- less and destitute; they may be honest and willing to work, but work is hard to be found, or-if fortunate to obtain it, its miserable compensation deprives the weary one of all hope of ever being successful to maintain herself or family in this manner. If not elevated by principle to hope on and ever, depression of spirits overcomes all else, leaving her a prey, though oftentimes a reluctant victim, to every avenue of vice."  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7224-00000027"/> 48       ELMWOOD,- OR,  "It is truly dreadful to contemplate," said Emma,  "but I have no doubt, sir, discouragement is often a I powerful agent, in the fall of many a forlorn wan- : derer from their former rectitude."  "Since we have considered this subject, I do assure you, Emma, it has become one of interest to me, and if my personal exertions can aid the matter, they shall be applied., My business demands much care; but the concerns of others shall not be neglected by even that." "What amendment would you propose, sir?"   [ "That this so termed slop-work should be wholly confined to that class incapable of a higher branch of i labor; that fair compensation should be given, and l the work performed faithfully, according to a required agreement. Then the one employed and the pur- chaser would both be benefited, and the conscience, at least of the original contractor, receive a surplus interest." "Could enough poor be found, sir, capable of an- swering the large demand for this work?" "I should say, certainly, if it was known it was established for their benefit alone. It is generally'a coarse kind of work, Mr. Ellis says; but the garments should be made firmly and in a decent manner; most females have sufficient knowledge of the needle to perform this properly." a What employment would you suggest to those whom you deprived of these resources, these daugh- ters of farmers and mechanics?" "Should you not advise, Emma, for them to take in finer sewing which they would have the ability to   HELEN AND EMMA.       49 do, and receive adequate wages for, or to make milli- nery or fancy articles for stores,- thereby, exercising their more cultivated powers, leaving slop-work to those incompetent to nicer labor. Widows with families to support, or invalid- females not able to brave the inclemency of the weather, and those per- sons unable to go into domestic service, are the most needy." "They are so, sir; and I think you have provided well for the middle classes. I do hope some im'prove- ment may be made in this business." "I agree with you; and now, Emma, as we have been conversing for others, let us speak regarding ourselves a few moments. Have you sufficient money for your -wishes "       - "Plenty, thank you, sir." "Take this purse in addition, my child, and if you have occasion, use it unsparingly. I can confidently trust you with the contents." "You are too kind, I fear I can never repay you for all your benefits to me," said Emma. "Nonsense, my daughter, are you not my little housekeeper and companion? You must remember you have also other claims upon me; I am a relative, you know." "I am proud of that relationship, dear sir." ," Don't make me blush, Emma, I am most too old for that. But you will call and see some of your old friends, and among them the young beauty, Miss Lyle. You can invite her to return with you, should you wish it, to enliven some of your solitary hours. Is it possible we are almost at our journey's end?" 5  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7224-00000028"/> 50       ELMWOOD, -- OR, "Indeed, sir, the time has passed so pleasantly, I was not aware of our rapid progress. I intend to call and see Helen very soon, perhaps to-morrow. I wonder if she is as fanciful as ever!" 4 You cannot expect much change as regards that part of her character," replied Mr. Elliott. " 1 hear she is quite the fashion this winter, and passes her time pretty gayly. She is a beautiful butterfly in society, sipping the honeyed nothings of existence; but place her in'a quiet homle with the sober truths of life whispered in her ear, how soon the dust would be   [ removed from her beautiful wings, bereaving her of her all."    HELEN AND EMMA.       51 CHAPTER      XII. A VERY fine day was the one after Mr. Elliott and his daughter arrived in the city. He early proceeded to his business concerns. Soon as the etiquette of fashionable life would permit Emma; to call on her friend Helen'Lyle, she did so; and found her just ready for a' drive to her milliner's, in pursuit of a new hat. She was delighted to see Emma, for the warmth of natural emotion was not yet wholly extinct,--the remembrance of one with whom she had passed the previous four years, not obliterated. They had ever been good friends at school, though so entirely different in character. Helen urged Emma to become her guest while in town, but as her father had taken apartments at a Hotel, she concluded she must defer her visit until another period. "My dear Miss Elliott, I am pleased to see you," said Mrs. Lyle, entering the drawing-room, attired in the most elaborate manner, in the acme of the pre- vailing fashion; " you will surely remain with us." "Thank you, Madam, I am with my father, and he may need me; therefore, I must forego the pleas- ure at this time. I see you are both prepared to go out, let me not delay you longer. I have been telling  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7224-00000029"/> 52       ELMWOOD,-OR,  Helen I was obliged -to purchase a winter hat, and she insists upon my accompanying her to Madamie Verey's." "That is all right, Miss Elliott," said Mrs. Lyle, "you must purchase it there, of course. Madame is our first milliner, and all the rage." "Such exquisite little arrangements for the head, and such superb flowers as she has'!" said Helen. "She has a truly Parisian taste," continued Mrs. Lyle, interrupting her daughter, "and is au--fait in her art. You will be charmed with her establishment. The difficulty is, how to select from  her great \ variety. As you go with us, my dear, I will ring for the footman to open the carriage door, and we will depart. We are thus early, because Madame's apart- ments are so thronged later, and Helen wishes more room and attention." "Emma, what do you do with yourself at Elm- wood?" asked Helen. "How very lonely you must be; and Henry absent at college; how can you exist?" "Perfectly well, dear Helen, and I am also very happy. All my time is occupied, and never yet have I had leisure to imagine myself discontented." is You always were a strange girl at Glenwood," said Helen. (' Do you carry your books round with I you as you did at school?"  "Sometimes, but you know I have now household cares to attend."    -  "What do you mean, my dear," quickly asked Mrs. Lyle, " that you are Mr. Elliott's (your father I A would say) - that you are his housekeeper? I have   HELEN AND EMMA.       53 ever heard him spoken of as a generous man, and we all know of his wealth. This is astonishing!" "He is one the kindest and most benevolent of men," answered Emma, feelingly. "He keeps abun- dant help. But I oversee, as a wife or daughter, the arrangements of the family, and it gives me great pleasure to be of any use to one so beloved, and who 'is so thoughtful regarding myself." "Certainly, my dear, if you can abide the care. For my part, I dislike the trials and perplexities of domestic concerns so much, that I have passed them all off my mind. Especially, since Helen has left school, we have so many engagements, it would be impossible for me to even 'superintend those harassing domestic affairs. So I supplied myself with a well recommended' person to relieve me of all thought upon those subjects, and now give myself no farther trouble." "Was Mr. Lyle satisfiedwith that plan?" asked "Why, Emma," said Helen, " you little reviver of antediluvian forms! No one thinks in this epoch of consulting gentlemen -about household matters. What possible difference can it make to a man, whether my lady or my lady's assistant, caters for his appetite, if that is only well attended to?" "I was thinking of the domestic economy of the arrangement," said Emma. "My dear young lady," said Mrs. Lyle, " we must have you with us for a season, to eradicate some of your erroneous ideas. Should not a person who has had to practise economy for years, know better how 5*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7224-00000030"/> 54       ELMWOOD, -- OR,  to continue that course, than one educated as I have i been?"  "I think," answered Emma, " such persons might know how to economize, when obliged to do it; but 7 when the necessity of the case was removed, they might,  perhaps, exercise a needless extravagance, relieving ' i themselves of the former task of deliberative thought.",' "Why, really, my dear Miss Elliott, what a won- derful person you are. I believe you are the only individual of my acquaintance that condescends to reason on any subject which might give additional trouble to themselves. But our conversation is. too  serious for young persons. See! Helen has an ab-  i stract look already." "Oh, no, mother, I have heard both Emma and yourself. But Hwas thinking of Jullien's concert to- night. You must hear him, dear Emma, at all events. L Your father would be in ecstasies." "It was our intention to hear him, ere we left home," said Emma. "He is unparalleled," said Helen, " a perfect artist, and so irresistible in his graceful movements. He is the monarch of his musical throne, and his subjects the most obedient vassals I ever beheld. But we are at Madame Verey's, so now for a change of arts for awhile, and acknowledge Madame the Jullienne of her profession." "Welcome, ladies," said the polite little French lady, coming gracefully forward. "So glad am' I you have arrived. Mademoiselle, I have the most re- cherche hat hid away, especially for your inspection. Just the article. It is of white moss velvet, graced   HELEN. AND EMMA.       55 by the costiliest feather of the season; there is not another in the city to compare with it. Oblige me, Mademoiselle, by trying it on." "That is truly exquisite, Madamer, it is indeed be- coming to my child." "I knew it would suit your refined taste, Madam. See! those lovely blush-roses, only outrivalled by the extreme loveliness of your daughter's complexion." "What do you think of it, Emma?" asked Helen. "As a hat for the street, do you mean?" said Emma. "Certainly, what a funny question," replied Helen, laughingly. "To tell you the truth, Helen," whispered Emma, (while Madame Verey was busily employed, showing Mrs. Lyle some rare caps, and other fancy articles,) "Madame asked you to try it on, and it don't seemn to me possible for you to do so." "Why, is it not on my head? You are joking, Emma, are you not?" earnestly inquired Helen. "I should say," replied Emma, " it was decidedly off your head, and gently reclining on your neck. I am sincere in my expressed opinion." "This hat is the height of fashion, you silly girl," said Helen; *' you will be obliged to have the same form and size." "Not I, my dear; the definition of hat, is a cover for the -head. And that, it is my intention to pur- chase," replied Emma. "Well,. Helen, have you decided?" said Mrs. Lyle. "Not fully, I am waiting for Emma to make a selection." O  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7224-00000031"/> 56       ELMWOOD;-- OR,-  "For the other young lady," said Madame, "does  she wish to be suited also?"           I I will look at some of your hats, if you please, Madame," said Emma.                ! "Pale blue, of course," answered Madame, " that ! must be your color; harmonizing so delectably with f your style of beauty. I have a little love of a hat; so chaste, so innocent; just suit you, Mademoiselle." "That hat is a beautiful color," replied Emtna, "blue is a great favorite with me. But really, Madame, the hat is so small, I cannot get it on my head." "Mademoiselle is deceived. Pray try it on, I shall esteem it one great favor for you to attempt it." "It is plenty large, my dear Miss Elliott," said Mrs. Lyle. "I never saw you have so stylish an air before. You really look most attractive." , 4 Do, Emma, pray do, purchase it. Now am I not generous, for you certainly will outrival me with that hat on." "But I cannot get it on, I assure you; it only covers the hair on the back of my head," said Emma. "You astonish me, Mademoiselle," said Madame Verey with emphasis. "The hat is the first stamp of fashion, it cannot be excelled. It would be inad- missible, in good society, were it larger, now the seal of ton is set upon it." "I am convinced then," replied Emma, "that my head is too large for the fashion; but such as it is, I must try and find a covering for it." Mrs. Lyle and her daughter appearing annoyed, Emma delicately intimated, that she would leave her   HELEN AND EMMA.        7 affairs until another time, and await their pleasure then. In the meanwhile, Madame whispered to Mrs. Lyle - "Is the young lady sane, that she challenges the established law of the season for hats elegoantes?" "Miss Elliott is a little peculiar," answered Mrs. Lyle, " in her opinions. She is the adopted daughter of the very wealthy Edgair Elliott of Elmwood." "Indeed!" replied Madame, "what a pity we could not show off her beauty to advantage. She is very pretty; cannot she be induced to remodel her attire, more after the fashion of the day? She would be quite a belle then, Mrs. Lyle." "Mother! I will take this hat," said Helen. "How much, Madarne, the price of Miss Lyle's pur- chase?" asked Mrs. Lyle. "Thirty-five dollars, only; very cheap. Not an- other in the city to compare with it." "How much was the blue hat?" asked Emma innocently, surprised at the high price above de- manded. "Twenty-five dollars, my dear. - The feather in Mademoiselle' ' hat make the difference. Shall I not send it home for you? It make you look lovelier than ever." "No, I thank you, Madams. It would not at all suit my purpose," answered Emma. "Good morning, ladies! Call again- always welcome," said Madame. "Did you not tell me, Ernmma, you were in-haste to purchase your hat?" asked Helen. "I did not think  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7224-00000032"/> 58       ELMWQOD,- OR, you so difficult. Madame Verey is the most tasteful of women; and her store the great resort for fash- ionists." " I must go then," said Emma, " to one less cele- brated;' I really wish a protection for my head, as that will not change with the fashion, it must still feel the cold wind, keenly as ever, when exposed to its full force." " It never occurred to me about that," said Helen. " Its beauty and becomingness were in my thoughts. However, I do not like the hats this season, they do not feel comfortably upon the head." " Why did you purchase so expensive a one then ?" asked Emma. " You incorrigible girl!" said Helen. " Living in the world that I do; how could I exist out of the sphere of that inexorable tryant -fashion ? " "Make another sphere for yourself then, one of comfort and utility," replied Emma. " And be deserted by every one ?" asked Helen. "Nay, Emma, you carry your joke too far. I am not at all calculated for a hermitess." "I am    not joking, dear Helen," said Emma. " I shall purchase me a hat that will not look so outre to the present style, as to make me an object of remark or attraction. But I shall have one mnade for me suf- ficiently large to ensure some protection for my head. I do not intend to exceed ten dollars in price." "Are you so avaricious ?  I know your father sup- plies you with abundant funds. You cannot possibly find one with ' an air  ' about it, for that," said Helen. " I must try and do my best," replied Emma; " I   am not avaricious for myself, only for those having claims upon me." " For pity's sake! " said Helen, '; do tell me who has claimns on the private purse of Miss Elliott'? I was not aware you had any poor relations needing your aid." " The great world of the poor and needy claim all my surplus stock," said Emma.     I cannot pay fif- teen dollars extra, for mere fancy, when so many heads, equally worthy as mine, have insufficient pro- tection, even, from the cold night air." " I have been listening in surprise to your friend Emma, Helen," said Mrs. Lyle. " I must say, girls! -one would be almost unwilling to believe Miss Elliott a graduate at the fashionable seminary of Miss Undertake. What did you do with your pecu- liar ideas while there ?

" And I care very little for Reason's cap, if I may be always permitted to wear Folly's bells," gayly said Helen. " I thought you, dear Helen, considered reason and fancy' synonymous terms; I am glad you already feel there is a difference in their signification," replied Emma. " A truce to reason now," said Helen.

The ladies alighted ,as they reached their home; and the carriage conveyed Miss Elliott to her Hotel.   HELEN AND EIVMA.       61 CHAPTER     XIll. "So ladies," asked Mr. Lyle, a fine portly looking gentleman, about fifty years of age, as he sat in his elegant drawing-room that evening; " so you have had a visit from my old friend Elliott's adopted, daughter. What is she liken?" "Nothing that you can mention, Papa," said Helen. "Then I should like very much to see her. Novel- ty certainly is pleasing, for its charms are rarely found in these days," said Mr. Lyle. "If it had not been for the very novelty, and the winning face and manner of Helen's friend," said Mrs. Lyle, "I should have felt ennuied at some of the conversation." "It must have been something out of the pale of fashionable life then," replied Mr. Lyle, " for you cer- tainly 'are conversant with all objects and events con- nected with that." ("Why, Papa," said Helen, " she reasons about everything. She never does anything,  without if called upon to explain, she can give a why or where- fore she did it. Is it not comical?"

"You are too severe, Papa," replied Helen. "I can give a good reason for liking Emma Elliott. - She is so kind and gentle, and never lectures you; only brings her views in quietly and firmly; if she finds it is annoying, she ceases at once. And though she is naturally a beauty, she makes no account of it at all. She never dreams, like many other girls, of trying all sorts of arts to eclipse one the other." '"Ah, ha! Miss Nellie, I understand. She does not try to outrival my little beauty! She is modest and unassuming,-rare trait. When shall I see this curi- osity? And how does she look?" eagerly asked Mr. Lyle. "Like a gentle violet, sir; to-morrow, she and her father will take tea with us, and we all go to hear and see the divine Jullien, in the evening. We wanted to surprise you, but your curiosity has prevented," said Helen. "I shall be glad, indeed, to see my old friend again. But why did they not come at once to our house? ' asked Mr. Lyle. "We urged it upon Emma," said Helen. "But she thought her father would be unable to devote much time to his friends, and would prefer a Hotel during'his stay." "Where is Mr. Elliott's son now?" inquired Mr. Lyle. "In college, sir," said Helen, with an unfashionable- blush upon her naughty countenance. "What an aristocratic looking young man he is,"   HELEN AND EMMA.       63 remarked Mrs. Lyle. "I was delighted with him at Glenwood." "Oh! you saw him then," said Mr. Lyle, "when Helen graduated?" "Yes, .husband, I forgot you were not present. He has a fine figure, and such a majestic mien! How he will turn the poor girls' heads, when he mingles in general society again." - Yes, wife, there are weighty considerations why the young ladies should be pleased with him. Two or three hundred thousand, even in perspective, make a young man quite an Adonis. A hero already in the foreground. What do you think, my daughter?" "The poor child," said Mrs. Lyle, " she is actually asleep on the sofa. No wonder, husband, it was very late when we arrived from Mrs. Lawton's ball last night, and she has been out all the forenoon." "Helen, dear, wake up, you had better retire." "Oh, mother! I was dreaming so pleasantly." "Ha! ha! ha! sleeping or waking dreams, you little rogue? Run away to bed," said Mr. Lyle, " and remember' you are only just out of the schoolroom, and love with such mi:ses is often a great goblin of fancy, decked out with all imaginary splendor, dwell- ing in a castle in the air; all at once vanishing like a ghost when you think you have discerned its reality." "You are pleased to jest, father," said Helen, " but you talk in riddles. I am very tired, and will bid you good-night." "Kiss me, Nellie, dear, for I am real flesh and blood, and your mother, also, in as far as fashion will release her from her grasping clutches."  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7224-00000035"/> "       ELMWOOD, -- OR, "Husband! you are too provoking." "Take care, dear wife, ' it is out of the pale of good society ' to exhibit strong emotion of any kind." "Did I not know you thoroughly, Mr. Lyle," an- swered his wife, "I should be indeed angry at your tantalizing remarks. I think you are sometimes quite too hard upon me." "Well, wife, you have your foibles, and I have mine; now good-night, and to your room, daughter dear." "Was Helen really asleep, wife? Do not let the little minx begin so early to imagine herself a heroine. We must guard her too carefully for that. It may color all her after life." 4' I think the child was just beginning to doze as I spoke to her. What you say, husband, may be true. I have always wondered at her fondness for Emma Elliott, they are so entirely unlike. As Henry's sister, that ,solves the riddle. Henry is truly a promising young man. He will be joint heir with Emma to his father's personal property; for I have lately heard Mr. Elliott has plainly mentioned his determination of dividing his personal property equally between 'Emma and his son. The real estate, of course, goes to Henry. Why might he not be as suitable a match as we could find for Helen?" "Wife, are you insane, like most females, on this point of marriage? Soon as girls are out of the nursery now-a-days, the weak child totters to the drawing-room and falls in love. No wonder they are oftentimes so bruised, as never wholly to recover, making them timid of any other attempt, even when   HELEN AND EMMA.       65 prepared, by time, to walk with their acquired strength. Talk openly of Henry, and make Helen speak of him. Let:her not nourish this chimera of fancy in her brain, making a bewildering phantasma- goria of her senses, by brooding over it in silence. This must not be." "I cannot see any harm likely to be done, hus- band. It strikes me it would be a capital match." "Capital fiddle-sticks! Excuse me, but I am out of patience. Helen is our only child, I am in no hurry to dispense with her society. She has and shall have a good home under my roof as long as she likes; fashionable or unfashionable as that roof may be. Beautiful as she is, and proud as we are of her, suppose, now, just suppose Mr. Henry Elliott should have a different fancy or taste, and differ materi- ally in his opinion; and the little idol of our hearts should go into a spasm of melancholy, all for an- imaginary ideal, and mourn herself into a shadow; and this nonsense coaxed into her young foolish heart, by a too fond but silly mother, and her own secret dreams! - and then this hero should, all at once, marry a Miss Margaret, that nobody ever heard of before, and confer all his beauty and estates upon poor Peggy. How would you feel then, Lady Lyle? What, remedy would you apply to an imaginary broken heart?  Would wrapping it in swathing bands of pride cement it as happily as it was done before? Think of this thing, Emmeline, and act accordingly." Mr. Lyle, as the reader will see, was one of those generous hearted souls, pure in honest intentions. *   He6  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7224-00000036"/> "       ELMWOOD,-- OR,           g He was wealthy and had married a beauty, who    i really loved her husband. Her commanding position  in society, had centred around her a bevy of fashion- X able friends, until she had become so initiated in the mysterious circle as to be shackled on every side by the merciless tyrant that held them all in chains. Her husband regretted this, but a natural dislike, and inertness to remonstrance on domestic trouble of any kind, usually kept him silent. In his love of fun, occasionally, he would send his torpedoes of raillery off as he had done that evening, but the effect was generally as transient as the sound produced. When he was aroused by an event he considered important, he was firm and earnest; showing the character that might have been, had he not alloweid his fine faculties to slumber, for want of sufficient vital energy to arouse them. He had given free scope to his wife on all the arrangements of her house, and always supplied her with a purse full of money for the personal requirements of Helen and herself. The energy of her husband, and the thoughts he awoke that night in her mind, led Mrs. Lyle to rea- son with herself; while her lovely daughter slept in the arms of fancy. J    HELEN AND EMMA.       67 CHAPTER    XIV. "WHAT do you think now'?-" eagerly inquired Helen, as they reentered the carriage on their return from Jullien's concert. "I -was very much pleased, dear Helen." "Pleased is that all? Were you not in raptures, Emma? Did you ever hear anything to compare with it?" asked Helen. ("Let me say a few words, Miss Lyle," said Mr. Elliott. "I can truly say, I never heard any band so exact, so perfect, if we may so speak, in their per- formance. Jullien certainly bore the magician's wand. I could feel my blood flowing feverishy through my veins, in my excited state of delight. I know my daughter was greatly charmed, only she is less en- thusiastic in her immediate expression." "Well, my old friend, Elliott, it gives me joy to hear your honest opinion. I began to fear I was be- coming a fashionist myself, for I have experienced sincere pleasure in hearing this spirited band, and have attended almost every concert that has been given by them. Since you, also, feel the charm, I know I am out of danger, and have not yet been en- trapped by a fashionable humbug." "There is no humbug in this, my good sir," said  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7224-00000037"/> 68       ELMWOOD, -OR, Mr. Elliott, " it is the excellence of art, and I think we may both enjoy the brilliant artistry of their music, as a whole, without being initiated into the thousand and one minor points of criticism, or having upon our heads a fashionable pair of ears. The ' American quadrille,' played on my heart, and awoke many an old association, making it bound and rebound, as in my boyish days, and I laughed inwardly, as well as outwardly. That is the right kind of music, that goes home to us, Lyle, and stirs up thought within  us. Come, Emma, let us have a little more from your lips, now I have finished." "I fear I may not agree with you, sir, and perhaps, I had better remain silent." "Speak out truly, Miss Elliott," said Mr. Lyle, "I am getting to be an old man, and can tell you, ' honesty is the best policy.' "She would not prevaricate in a thought, Emma is truth itself," said Helen. "Thank you, my friend," replied Emma!, " as we have reached your dwelling, I must defer my opin- ions until another time." "No, no," exclaimed Mr. Lyle. "I have hardly seen you, my dear; and cannot give up my old friend for an hour or more, so come in, I entreat, and if you will not stay all night, we will see you safely at your Hotel." "We cannot put you at the extra trouble of having your carriage out again to-night. It is such a short distance from here to our temporary home, that Em- ma and myself can easily wallk there, after passing an hour more in your agreeable society."   HELEN AND EMMA        69 "Now, Miss Elliott, as we are so comfortably en- sconced at home, let us have your criticism of Mon- sieur Louis George Jullien." "I am entirely incompetent to the task, Mr. Lyle, but I will speak of the performance as it affected me," said Emma. "It first, struck me with amazement; it was so new, so unexpected; then the brilliancy of the style passed over my mind. Pleasure followed at the perfect understanding between the great leader and his band; the melody of soul, the recognized me- dium, uniting them in unmistakable harmony." "So far, so good, dear Emma," said Helen, " yet, how can you analyze your feelings? I only know I am in the bewildering whirlpool of ecstasy. What next?" "After the music ceased," continued Emma, "do not be offended, Helen, my pleasurable feelings van- ished also. I knew I had been surprised, and had heard brilliant sounds from the great orchestra, now silent before me. Like a gorgeous panoramic show to the eye, after the curtain has fallen upon it; so had these sounds passed away from my ear. Something was wanting, and yet I could not detect the fault. I felt as if I had just escaped from a brilliant gas- lighted apartment, all at once into total darkness." "You incomprehensible girl!" said Helen. "How did the solo performers affect you?" "Deeply, from their exquisite execution, they were unsurpassingly excellent." "You really begin to grow a little enthusiastic; when you were in -the city a few months since, you attended several of the Germania concerts. How will  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7224-00000038"/> 70       ELMWOOD, -OR,           1 those compare with Jullien's, in your peculiar mind?"  asked Helen.  "I think," said Emma, " now you have mentioned M the Germanians - and I may also add the classic little band comprising the Mendelssohn Quintette Club, which I most delightedly heard during that  visit -I have, I think, found the key to my feelings, concerning the great Jullien. After all, my taste may be at fault in not appreciating rightly.- As I before said, Jullien's music is like some wonderful phenome- na in nature, attracting all eyes for the time being, but when the meteoric display has departed we can- not recall it, we only know that it has been, by the stones, perhaps, that -remain on the ground. His music seems greatly to excite the feelings, giving a zest of pleasurable delight during the performance, but leaving the heart and mind untouched." "Proceed, my queer little critic, we are all atten- tion," said honest Mr. Lyle. "I beg pardon, sir, it is only my uneducated opin- ion, and I feel like trespassing on forbidden ground in giving that so much at length." "We all wish to hear you, my dear," replied Mrs. Lyle, " and you may feel you are conferring a favor." "I also am a ready listener,"' said Mr. Elliott, "and observe how attentive Miss Helen is." "Come, Emma, go on, I am very -curious to hear you," said Helen. "Almost always," continued Emma, " when I have heard the Germanians, or Quintette Club, (as you know, -in vacations, I frequently tame to the city for the express purpose,) I have been less aroused at first,   HELEN AND EMMA.       71 than at Jullien's concerts; but somehow, the music sank into my soul; and as I returned home, the sweet strains vibrated on my ear, as if each passing breeze had been enchanted, and was wafting the echo again to its sister zephyr's. Some of their pieces awoke strong emotions in my heart of an ex- alted nature; and a chasteness of purpose seemed to impel me on and sustain me in performing the varied duties of life. There was ever a fragrance retained in the memory, and that was my vacuity at Jullien's concert." "Who has been at Fancy's court now? Really, dear girl, your reason has played bo-peep with the fairies, sometime or other, and they are always at battle with their only enemy, reality, so they have sent a simile to tilt a lance with you. - Well, well," laughingly continued Mr. Lyle, " none of us want all prose, without the privilege of running into rhyme sometimes." "I hardly receive your meaning, sir," said Emma. "Were you aware, my young friend, you were rather fanciful in your comparisons? I was pleased though to see it, because I like equilibrium, and :you would be one-sided if you could not balance yourself on all points," and with a wholesome, round ha! ha! ha! Mr. Lye ended. "Father! you interrupted Emma," said Helen. "Excuse me, Miss, pray proceed, your father is looking at his watch," urged Mr. Lyle. a' Which is a sign for me to cease at once," said Emma rising. "Oh! no, dear, continue; as- you seem to interest our kind friends." i   &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7224-00000039"/> 72       ELMWOOD, -- OR, "I have but few more words to say," said Emma. "The style and the matter of Jullien's music must be of a lighter character calculated to dazzle and amuse. That of the other performers alluded to, more quiet, yet earnest; more solid, efficacious to awaken thought, and refine and exalt by its severe purity. Remember, dear friends, this is only my humble opinion, and of course of no consequence to any one but myself. I will not detain you longer, sir." "I am ready," said Mr. Elliott; " and now Miss Helen, you will certainly accompany us home Thurs- day morning; as it-is Henry's vacation, we must make Elmwood a little livelier for him; so, my good friends, do not let her disappoint us.'"   HELEN AND EMMA.       73 CHAPTER XV. "How do you like our curiosity, our friend Em- ma, Papa?" asked Helen Lyle. i"I think her, to begin with, a flower of loveliness -Class, delectabilia; Order, prudentia; belonging to the genus peculia. Is her adopted brother like her, dear Helen?" "I was talking of Emma, sir, I do not know much concerning her brother," replied Helen. "You will meet Master Henry at Elmwood, and I would like to know what sort of a boy he is,- a clumsy fellow, I dare say'" said Mr. Lyle. "Oh! no, sir, he is very graceful," said Helen, quickly. "But very plain," continued Mr. Lyle " with a hooked nose." "Why, father, you have seen him, in years gone by, and knew him to be a fine looking boy then; and he is handsomer now than ever," said Helen. " Goggle eyes he had, did he not?" asked Mr. Lyle. "You are disposed to jest, father," said Helen, "Master Henry is only'a boy; so Miss Helen do not imagine him to be a cupid with his shaft full of 7  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7224-00000040"/> 74      ELMWOOD, - OR, arrows. To speak plainly, do not think too much of -Master Elliott, for aught we know, he may be en- gaged to Miss Betsy Dumbedikes, heart and soul. A young lady sighing after a heartless lover, is a most ridiculous and woe-begone sight." "I do not see, Papa, why you speak in such a manner to me. What is Henry Elliott to my lady- ship??only as Emma's brother, and the son of your good old friend." "Oh! nothing, of course, I only wanted to caution you, daughter mine; for the most whimsical little chimeras get into the brain-work of a foolish young head, that often take years of repentance to eradi- cate. So a word in season, is a fortress of strength. Now for your friend Emma,--she seems to be a gentle, modest girl, and there is much sweetness in her manner. She dresses plainly, but neatly. I am  pleased that you like her, my child. What attracts you to her'? she is anything but a fash- ionist." 6"It would improve Emma exceedingly," said Mrs. Lyle, " to move more frequently in a polished circle; and become somewhat versed in the style and air, that, alone, can  give. Her wardrobe needs a thorough change, also: Her dresses are all of them made in the fashion of last year." "Yes," said Helen, "that is all the fault I find with Emma.   She is gentle on almost all subjects, and willing to oblige others. And though she has plenty of funds to command, she still economizes and wears out her clothes, ere she purchases new. The idea of wearing out a dress in these days,   HELEN AND EMMA.      75 when new fashions arrive every month,-it is so preposterous!" "So it is," said Mr. Lyle. "It is-like going back to the dark ages in life, when a garmentwas an heir- loom from family to family, and change would have been thought desecration. Poor Emma! having the courage to wear your garb from one season to another - what a miracle! It would be like the stig- ma of crime on the taste of a city belle." "How did you like what she said, Papa, about Jullien, and her comparing him with others? ' asked Helen. "She colors her views with her peculiar tastes; she does not seek to influence another by argument. She individualizes her feelings, as those of a unit in the community, leaving others the same privilege. There was no bigoted fault-finding with the great world for not coinciding with her views; but she, when urged, honestly gave her own opinions. This is as it should be. One should not attempt to criticise for the mass, and think to establish an authority by so doing; but ea'ch should judge with their dis- tinct mental organization, how they received an im- pression. This would deprive criticism of its sting, knowing it affected only an iota of creation, as so expressed, and not the collective body. For my part, my child, I am unchanged, I prefer Jullien to any artist I ever heard, and I never expect to hear or see his equal." "And I agree with you, Papa. Jullien forever! I am distracted to hear him again." Jullien still for me ; echoed Mrs. Lyle; ' he has a  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7224-00000041"/> 76         ELMWOOD, -  OR, decided air of fashion. All the ton are in a perfect furore for his promised return." "All sufficient reason, dear wife,--Jullien  is a stamped man, now the mighty upper ten have set their seal upon him. Viva! Monsieur Louis George Jullien, and bon-soir to you, ladies!" \   HELEN AND EMMA.       " CHAPTER XVI. THURSDAI evening saw our good Mr. Elliott, his daughter and her friend Helen, at his residence in Elmwood. Elmwood is a delightful spot. The house is situ- ated on a gentle rise, and approached through a long avenue of ancient elms; back of the mansion a beau- tiful garden; orchard and farm-land were all in a high state of cultivation. Wandering in the distance round the base of a lofty hill, and through the ver- dant meadows, gently flowed the river of the town; adding, as water ever does, its peculiar charm to the scenery. Several other fine country seats were situated near Mr. Elliott's, and a little apart from the immediate village of the town. Irrington was the name given to the town as a whole, and Irrington village was a neat little place, its inhabitants generally industrious and honest tradesmen. As is usually the case, there were also men of refinement and classical acquire- ments located in various parts of the town, whose families, when congregated together, made a little cultivated atmosphere of their own, where they could enjoy interchange of thought and sentiment. The country around the village was rich in its 7*  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7224-00000042"/> 78       ELMWOOD, - OR, natural scenery; altogether, Irrington was a fine place for a residence to a person of reasonable hopes, as regarded the daily requirements of life. But twenty miles from the capital city of the state, Irrington was only far enough off from its great neighbor, not to be annoyed by its presumption or competition, yet to derive all the benefits resulting from the effects of the condensed body, comprising its population. Henry was expected home Saturday. The day following their arrival at Elmwood, was spent by the young ladies in planning what they would do to cele- brate his return. Soon as it was known Miss Lyle was a visitor at Mr. Elliott's, those friends who were on terms of in- timacy there, called upon Helen, inviting her to their respective homes. This good old fashion is still kept up in some parts of our country. Parties and visits were now anticipated. Helen and Emma had ar- ranged one for the coming week at Elmwood. Helen Lyle's fine scheming taste for all that fancy could devise, being in its acquired state of enjoy- ment, she was most pleasantly employed, weaving airy dreams into wreaths of expected realization. As Helen was Emma's guest, the latter yielded to her wishes, in as far as her principles did not directly interfere. 3ir. Elliott had made it an urgent request to his daughter, that Miss Lyle might arrange anything she thought would amuse her, begging her to feel per- fectly at home during her sojourn with them. Mr. Elliott feared it might be dull to the indulged   HELEN AND EMMA.       79 child of his old friend, at Elmwood, after her city ex- perience, and so wished to do all in his power for her comfort, and educated ideas of pleasure. He hoped also the society of his gentle daughter would have a good influence upon the fashionable belle of the season. As for Henry connected in any way with Helen the idea never suggested itself to Mr. Elliott's mind. He was still to his father, my boy Henry, and thought of only in that light. Did Miss Helen Lyle think of Henry Elliott as a boy? By no means; he had been the idol of her dreams for the last four months. She had seen no one in the city to compare with him in any point. Unconsciously Helen blushed, and her heart beat quickly, when after embracing his father, and shaking hands with Emma, he frankly stepped forward and did the same to her, saying - "This is an unexpected pleasure, Miss Lyle." a Where's the kiss for your sister, Master Henry? Methinks, I should not have neglected the opportu- nity for kissing a pair of the pretiest lips in the world." "I was afraid I might be intrusive, sir," said Henry. "What is the world coming to? Who ever heard of a boy having such a thought as to be afraid to kiss his sister. Why, I've known many a second cousin claim his privilege of a kiss, when the lady was -at all indebted to nature for any of its favors; and here, with a lovely sister before you, you are- afraid. Whew, boy! you'll never do for the army. See, how  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7224-00000043"/> 80       ELMWOODI -- OR, Emma blushes! The girls are running away; go after them, Henry, and make it all up before dinner- time. I must not neglect my appointments, but defer my pleasure at your return, until I can enjoy you in good earnest." The foregoing conversation was confusing to both of the young ladies. Helen Lyle was not altogether pleased, she would have liked it better, had Henry embraced his sister cordially, and not treated them nearly alike in his reception of them. Henry joined the young ladies. All was now for- gotten in their imparting to him their proposed enter- tainment. He entered into the affair-with good spirit, and proposed inviting one or two of his collegiate friends to become actors with them in the arrange- ments.                   e Monday evening, Mr. Allonsby gave a select party in their honor, and a dinner engagement on Wednes- day, led them to postpone their own party until Thursday evening. Of   HELEN AND EMMA.       81 CHAPTER    XVII. How brilliantly the house looked coming from out the avenue of trees; the illumination appeared quite fairy-like. Emma received her guests, as lady of the house, in a large reception room on the right of the building. When the company had generally assembled, the opposite drawing-room was thrown open, and dan- cing commenced to the music of the Germania serenade band, engaged at Helen's expressed wish. The dancing continued until the announcement of supper, a most recherche feast, and well appreciated by those present. During this interlude, the young ladies, with a few chosen friends of either sex, con- trived to escape unperceived. After supper the visitors were requested to march back to the drawing-room to the music of the band, (in olden style). They followed the leader to the opposite suite of rooms below; a moment or two after the gas was extinguished, and presently re- lighted. In the meanwhile, a curtain had been with- drawn between these two large apartments presenting to the guests a gorgeous tableau, representing a group of persons collected from all parts of the world, each in their national costume, with some emblem of their country, tribe, or clan.  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7224-00000044"/> 82       ELMWOOD, -- OR, For instance, there was Victoria, Queen of Eng- land, magnificently attired, seated on a throne of crimson velvet, with the crown upon her head, and all the insignia of royalty around her. Miss Lyle represented this character, looking " every inch a Queenl.' Next to this personage was an American lady, dressed in white sillk, with exquisite natural flowers in her hair, and a blush rose surrounded by lilies of the valley, upon her breast. Chaste as the flowers she looked, and loveliness beamed from the eyes of Emrna Elliott, as she held in *her hand a small flag of the stripes and stars over the head of an old Indian chief kneeling at her feet; he was apparently burying his tomahawk in the earth, while she extended her other hand as if to raise hirn up. A hearty son of Erin with the shamrock in his hat, and a basket of potatoes on his back, came next. Then a Welsh peasant girl in gay attire, and a Russian noble in robes-of costhest furs. On the left of the English Queen stood a hand- some young Highlander with his tartan gracefully wrapt around him, embroidered with gold thistles, attracting all eyes by his manly beauty, heightened by his fancy costume. Then a -tutiful Circassian slave held coffee for a hideous looking Turk, who, with scimitar by his side, was seated cross-legged on his purple velvet cushion fringed with silver. A Pole and Austrian crossing swords as if in the heat of battle. A French page, beautiful as a young girl could   HELEN AND EMMA.       83 look, dressed in that costly and most effeminate garb, usually bestowed by some proud lady on her favorite attendant. Persia, also, with its- gorgeous draperies. China, with her long braids and small shoes. Italy with its monk in pontifical robes, and his magnificent banner of a diamond cross resting on black velvet. The Spanish Don, the Egyptian, the coal-black African, and the Jew with his money bags in hand; indeed, a representative from all climes heterogene- ously mingled. The only person seated was the British Queen, the others knelt or stood, excepting the Turk. The Queen's throne added to the richness of the picture, and made a good division of the throng. The different positions and various expressions were well sustained by the individuals portraying characters. Helen Lyle looked as if these persons were natur- ally all of them her subjects, as if she was born to command. Emma Elliott, as America should ever appear, pos- sessed the beholder with its natural nobility; its power of self-reliance amidst diffculties. Not pre- sumptive, yet all powerful. After the curtain fell, the surprised audience mani- fested rapturous applause, which was stopped only by the music of the band, who played some of the national airs of the nations represented. Scarcely had the sweet sounds ceased, ere the curtain again rose. Two or three old wornen were seen in the interior of what seemed a -wash-house  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7224-00000045"/> 84       ELMWOOD, --OR, they were habited in black skirts, with white cotton short gowns over them, and were scrubbing clothes on wash-boards in tubs of good soap-suds, scolding merrily the while. All at once the band struck up the memorable air, "There is nae luck about the house." The curtain fell, and the word washing was whis- pered around the room. The curtain again rose. A lady in the extreme height of fashion promenaded the room, with an air that bespoke sufficiently well the upper tendom at- mnosphere; she looked up, and immediately a General, from top to toe, appeared on the scene, and, chapeau in hand, bowed to the lady of fashion, and then to the audience before him. Washington! the company exclaimed. Just at that moment the band played Washington's Grand March. We need not say Miss Lyle, as the lady of ton, received Henry Elliott's bow, as General Washington, with marked favor. In less time than could be expected, the inside of a country Inn was presented to view. A pretty bar- maid behind a bar, and four or five countrymen pur- chasing lemonade, for the young lassie would not deal out destruction in the shape of artificial spirits, but, as one of the honest yeoman said, " she gave the real spirits to a fellow in a glance of her merry black eye, that made the water sparkling enough for him." The countrymen went out to their wagons, and the Inn passed away. The next scene represented a lover kneeling at the feet of his mistress, pleading warmly his suit, while   HELTEN AND EMMA.      85 she shook her head, saying, No, to all his imploring words. She looked though, as if like a true woman, she meant Yes, but for fear of appearing to yield too readily, she would wait for farther entreaty; and her words spoke the no, while the heart was too full for utterance. Miss Lyle and Mr. Henry Elliott repre- sented this syllable. The band played the song called "No," a burlesque on the words of "Isabel." They were interrupted by a pretty Miss with a rose in her hand, which she continually inhaled. "Oh! what a sweet scent this has, it is so beautiful! I must carry it to Mamma, the scent of roses is her favorite odor," said the young girl. Just as she left the room, clad in white crape, with hair parted smoothly over her forehead, leading a little white lamb by a string with one hand, and holding a pure white dove to her breast, came one who ex- claimed, "Innocent creatures! I will protect you from harm." The audience manifested much applause. One old gentleman, a privileged friend, said, ("Three cheers for the maiden, the most innocent of the em- blems." Emma Elliott courtesied and withdrew, after the compliment bestowed upon her. The rooms were now wholly relighted with gas, and a few dances in appropriate costume finished the gala party. It was a fine affair, and gave universal satisfaction. 8 *  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7224-00000046"/> 86       ELMWOOD - OR) CHAPTER    XVIII. "WE really had a jovial time. I must give you credit, young folks," said Mr. Elliott, " for your good taste in arranging matters. It passed off with eclat, and I hope none of you feel the worse for your ex- ertions." "We are rather weary, and intend resting this morning from farther excitement," said Emma. "Ohil, my dear," interrupted her father, "I forgot that last evening a messenger came from Mrs. Do- mett. -The porter mentioned it to me this morning." "I had intended to have visited her to-day," said Emma. "I was there Monday and found her little girl more comfortable, and the mother full of grati- tude, as she was expecting her trunk full of work from the city agent." "Who is this Mrs. Domett?" said Henry. "A particular friend of your sister's, my boy, one in whom she feels much interest." "When do you go, Emma?" asked Henry. "I will accompany you, if you please." ' This afternoon I shall visit her, as I have some things to take with me," replied Emma. "Is it far?" asked Miss Lyle. "I should also like to take a walk, if it is not a great distance."   HELEN AND EMMA.       87  ' "Not two miles," said Emma, " as I usually cross the fields. I did not think of inviting you, dear Helen, to accompany me, thinking it would not be agreeable. I was going to beg you to excuse me for an hour or so, but if you and Henry would like, it would give me pleasure to have you both join me in my proposed visit. I have one or two other calls in that neighborhood, which, perchance, you would pre- fer not to make, as it is among the very destitute and poverty-stricken I am going. The contrast will be great, Helen, to the scenes you have been accustom- ed to witness." "Are you not afraid of contagion of some kind, Emma, in going to these low places?" asked Helen. "Could you not send relief to these persons?" "Not the comfort that my going to them would give," said Emma. "The contagion from infectious diseases of the body is not to be compared, dear Helen, with the immoral contagion we daily expose our minds to in the world. Besides, these persons are mostly afflicted with the disease of poverty, and that we can in a measure remove, if we have the will; so we can eradicate it from their premises, in- stead of spreading it abroad." "I should like to go, for the novelty," said Helen, "if you really think, Emma, there is no danger in exposing ourselves." Henry Elliott had listened attentively to the above conversation; though having retired to another part: of the room, after his father had left the apartment, -he had, to all appearance, been deeply enamored of a beautiful bignonia, with its delicate pink flowers. He  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7224-00000047"/> 88       E0LMWOO,- O--R, had, however, heard every word, and those words left their impression upon his mind. He advanced un- concernedly forward, saying: "Well, my sweet sister, what is the hour for visit- ing Mrs. Domett? I am at your service to carry any bundle, basket, or whatever you may please, of any reasonable size, as your obedient attendant on the occasion." "Thank you, Henry, I may need your service. I had thought of taking Thomas with me, but if you are sincere, I will accept your proffered aid." "Never was more in earnest in my life," answered Henry. "I generally carry a small basket myself," said Emma, "but to-day I have other things I would like to convey to families in that vicinity. - Three o'clock, then, shall be the hour. Helen, if she does not repent, will join our party, so we can make it a party of pleasure; as it should be always our enjoy- ment to try and do some little good to others." "-Oh, I shall go with you," said Helen, " variety is said to be charming, and this will be my first visit in the abodes of the poor. I always give them money when they are sent to us by friends, requesting assist- ance for them, but I never took the part of ' Sister of Charity' before." Mrs. Domett kept her little apartment in as com- fortable a looking state as she could possibly, and Alice, her very pretty daughter, was now so far re- covered as to sit up several hours at 'a time in the bed. The child had been so anxious to see Miss El- liott, to tell her she was almost well, and the trunk   HELEN AND EMMA.       89 of work having arrived, Mrs. Domett had complied with her daughter's urgent request that Miss Emma might be apprized. Alice wished immediately to commence sewing, while she sat up, but her mother told her she must not do so without Miss Elliott's leave; astit would not be right for her to expose her- self too much after all the kind care bestowed upon her. So she must try and be patient until Miss Em- ma came. The party arrived at Mrs. Domett's about four o'clock in the afternoon. The good woman received them kindly, but seemed rather perturbed at the pres- ence of Helen and Henry; but Emma soon made all feel at ease. Miss Lyle stared around her at the desolation pre- vailing. She was astonished to see how pretty the little girl was, in her clean white night-dress. She did not know this very garment was made by the delicate hands of her friend Emma, or she would have been even more amazed. Henry Elliott, with his fine heart, felt elevated in ' being permitted to- accompany this missionary of gladness on her errands of love and mercy. They remained some time with Mrs. Domett, and even Miss Lyle addressed the little girl kindly, giving her a silver dollar as a remembrance. Alice Domett looked at her mother, then at Miss Elliott, -and said, "Can mother buy -her a pair of shoes with this bright money the beautiful lady has given me? Mother's shoes are all'worn out; she spends all her earnings for me and my three little brothers; they are playing out of doors now, to make 8,*  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7224-00000048"/> 90       ELM WOOD,-- OR, them hardy,- this warm room is not good, mother says, for them.

Alice was silent in a moment, but awaited wist- fully the answer to her question concerning the shoes. Henry stepped forward and said, ("Keep the lady's dollar, Alice, it may be an omen of good. Your mother shall have some nice warm shoes, also." "Oh, how good everybody is," said the innocent child, "everybody but Mr. Atkins, who wanted to turn mother out of the house because the storekeeper would not pay her for her work, and that money she owed for the rent. Mother could not get the sum anywhere until Miss Emma came." "There, Alice, you are talking again," said Emma. "Have you forgotten, Alice?" asked her mother, "that Miss Elliott told you you must pray for those who are not kind to you, and pity them, -not speak- ing harshy to others of them." Alice blushed, and looked as if she felt she had done wrong. The party now bade good bye. Henry remained the last for the purpose of closing the door. In so doing, he slipped a bank note into Mrs. Domett's hand, telling her he knew from Miss Elliott's interest in them, a good use would be made of the money. The poor woman looked full of gratitude, but Henry   HELEN AND EMMA.       91 quickly closed the door, so that she could not express it in words. "Helen," said Emma, " what you have just wit- nessed- is comparative ease and comfort to what I am now going amidst. Will you still keep: your resolu- tion to accompany me?" "I thought Mrs. Domett's abode was poverty it- self," replied Helen. "Only one room for those five beings to live in! How can things be worse? But I will go on with you." "Henry," said his sister, "I fear your basket is too heavy. Now I have left my smaller one, let me as- sist you." "Nay, nay, Emma, you make light of my strength. Do not judge me so feeble. I could carry thrice its weigfit in so good a cause." They now entered a miserable hovel, where upon some coarse straw on the dirty floor of the hut lay a wretched man in the decrepitude of life. No other human being near him. Helen returned to the door, but seeing Emma and Henry both fearlessly go up to the miserable creature, she felt ashamed and re- entered again. What was Helen's surprise to see Emma stoop down, and in loud tones ask if his daughter had been there that day? The invalid was very deaf, his senses were all fast fading away. "My girl! Oh, Sally? No, no. She curses her poor father night and day. I stole her silver, yes, did I, but she has her revenge." "Poor old man! he raves," said Emma. "You speak, Henry, ask him if his daughter has been here to. day."  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7224-00000049"/> 92       ELMWOOD, - OR, "Eh!. yes. Sally came, but it did no good, I can- not go to the almshouse. No, no, Jerry die here. Cannot move away from the old green home. I must stay in the orchard, pray let me be!" and sobs choked farther utterance, "Poor man! It is all in vain," said Emma. "I have tried to benefit him, but he pleads so not to be moved. He imagines this to be the home of his, childhood, and wishes to die here. He was unfortu- nate in his trade, and drank so hard every one for- sook him; and he sought this miserable shed, and laid himself down in. despair. He is now too weak to rise. His daughter lives in the neighborhood, but she shuns the poor creature. I have been obliged to pay her to come daily and take care of him, at inter- vals. She also is very poor, and he has robbed her of her small earnings when in a state of intoxication, to satisfy his farther thirst for spirit, before he was reduced to so feeble a state. She, with no principle to guide her, and her natural affection veiled over by a life of crime, on -both sides, retaliates upon him now, and were it not for her love of gain, would never approach him more. You shudder at this dreadful scene, Helen, but death will soon bring re- lief here. His daughter whom I must visit will shock you, even, more." "Why have not the town authorities investigated this case?" asked Henry. "I think they are ignorant at present of the circum- stances. The poor man has been unable to rise from his straw, the past two weeks, and the hut is thought too wretched to have an occupant. He came back to   HELEN AND EMMA.       93 seek his daughter, and she repulsing him with harsh language, menacing him that she would deliver him to the officers of justice, as a thief and vagabond, led him to seek his retreat in the old hut." Can nothing be done to aid him?" asked Henry. "No more, I fear. I intended to have mentioned his case to Mr. Elliott on our return--but he is so averse to being moved. He is far more feeble than when I last saw him. I shall try to prevail on some man in the neighborhood to be faithful to him the last few days he may possibly have to live, and to bury him decently after his death." I will see that is done, Emma, I know a good honest fellow, that I once served when a small boy; he will do it from gratitude, if for no other consider- ation."  "Father gave me a sum -of money to apply to the needs of the unfortunate; and from that sum I will pay the necessary expenses. But where is Helen?" "She is just outside the door," said, Henry. "She is looking pale and weary." "Perhaps, Henry," whispered Emma, " you had better accompany her home." "Would it not be beneficial to her to go on with you? Such an opportunity may never occur again, and it is well we should all know that there are two distinct worlds in the great body around us; the rich world, and the poor world, both though comprised of human beings with the same internal well-springs of life as ourselves, having like affections, hopes and fears, all belonging to one great family, divided only in this world, by the boundary line of dollars and cents."  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7224-00000050"/> "       ELMWOOD, - OR, "Perhaps you are right, Henry, in wishing Helen to proceed farther, and see the opposite side of life, to that which she has daily encountered. I will ask her wish concerning the same." '"Helen," said Emma," we have two or three more places to visit. /Will you await us in the fields, or shall Henry accompany you home?" "By no means, Emma, 1 will go on. But that old man made me so nervous. It is so new to me. Poor creature! Was he dying? He sobbed like a child. I was obliged to go out of the place. How could you and Henry remain there so long?" "He is an unfortunate brother of ours, Helen, a child of our Heavenly Father; and as we hope for clemency for our own misdeeds, must we not extend our charity to other erring mortals? He will soon be in the immediate presence of his God, disrobed of this repulsive looking body, where'we would hope his spirit would be purified and exalted; and peni- tence with her angel wings waft. away pardoned sins, leaving him at rest in childlike faith on the love of that Father --'whose mercy endureth forever.' Here it is, that his daughter lives." "What, Emma, up those miserable stairs? They are falling to pieces. Surely, you will not venture up them." "Emma is already up, Miss Lyle," said Henry. "Let me assist you. Take hold of my hand, do not fear, the ascent is safer than it appears." Helen availed herself of this aid, and felt renewed strength in her undertaking. Loud and angry were the upraised voices, as if in   :- .  X HELEN AND EMMA.      95 :dispute,/;as -Emma knocked at the door. A rough -looking man opened the door and passed rapidly down the stairs. Well might Helen shrink now. A coarse, dirty looking woman in the prime of life was seated on the floor, with a pipe in her hand. Her two children lie screaming and kicking on the cold brick hearth, almost destitute of clothing, if we may except the coating of mud and filth, upon their bodies. A jug was upon the floor containing liquor; no bed, chair or table was to be seen. Two broken crickets, and some old crockery ware, with a large iron pot, were also upon the floor. In one corner of the room lay a heap of dirty straw, over which was strewed a pack of cards. "Devil curse ye! ]" said the woman, as the man left the room, and Emma surprised her, by coming in. "What is the matter, Sally?" asked Miss Elliott. "Matter enough, that dare-devil Tom Jones has been here,and brought this liquor to treat; and then he made me play cards, and now he's won all the money you gave me, for seeing to that old bed-ridden creature in the hut. I didn't lose it-- he cheated, and stole it out of my hand, and run off as you see'd. I'll blow his brains out, yet. There's those two-brats squalling all the time for something to eat, and precious little they'll get for it. Hold your noise! or I'll flog you to nothing, you varmints, you." "Poor little ones!" said Emma, coming forward. "Sally, my brother and a lady are with me. I can- not remain long. I have something to say to you.

I have secured a good asylum for your children, and if you are willing, they shall be taken to-morrow, where they will not cry so piteously for bread, and shall receive kind care." "Take them and welc6me. I am tired of their cries; I meant to have bought 'em a bit of bread, though, if that villain Tom had not stolen the money. But what's to become of me? Eh!" ' You are strong and able, Sally; if you would only give up your bad ways and companions, you could find work enough to do." "But who is going to help me?" "You must help yourself first, and then others will be willing to give you employment." (' Well, take care of the young ones, they'll be bet- ter off than staying here, they'll starve, if they do stay much longer. Then I shall be free to get my money back from that devil Tom. - I'll be revenged, yet." "Do not speak so, Sally. I shall send for the children on the morrow; and if you will repent and reform, I will be your friend, also. You see how eagerly those little ones are eating the bread I have brought them. Here is food for you also, for to-day. I cannot stop longer now, but I beseech you to recall all I have before said to you. I shall be glad to hear well of you." "Well, well, you'll see these brats cared after, you say, and the old one is knocked up, going off soon- and somebody is going to bury him. So Sally's left clean to herself, and nobody to trouble her. That's fair game." 4 I pray you stop, and wound not the feelings of -/   RELEN AND EMMA.       97 these ladies, farther," said Henry, speaking for the first time. "They have just come from the dying bed, probably, of your suffering father. If you are -human, you must remember that he-is your parent still, whatever wrongs he may have committed. I beg you to reflect on your conduct, before it is too late to ask his pardon." They now descended the rickety staircase; Helen wiping the tears from her eyes. "How true is the fact," said Emma, "convincing us how debased moral degradation can make even the natural well-springs of the human heart. Here is a father forsaken by a ehild,- a part of his own being, rending the life-riven tie, even, when the form of death Shudders at the door. It is insufficient to awaken one vital emotion of humanity in the callous breast of that sin-beguiled woman; and that very woman a mother of human beings herself. Dark indeed must have been the crime on both sides, that has shut out the blessed light of humanity, making a chaos of the natural inclinations of our being." "Thank God! Emma," said Henry," a case like this is very rare. I did not know Irrington could be the locality -of such criminality." "( We are you know, Henry, on the outskirts of the town now; this portion of ground is not often visited by the selectmen ; the buildings are occupied but a short time by the same tenants; and, I fear) too little notice is taken of this avenue, as it proves, of vice." "Are you going farther?" asked Miss Lyle. "We 9            *  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7224-00000052"/> 98       ELMWOOD, -- OR, have certainly seen destitution enough for one day. What a dreadful'creature that woman swas! I pitied those little starving creatures.. I never saw children eat so eagerly before, they must have been long with- out food." "Quarter of a mile farther, Helen, I am anxious to go. I planned a longer walk than usual after Hen. ry's kind offer to accompany and assist me. I fear, though, it will be too much for you, and had perhaps better defer it until another time, unless Henry will remain with you until I return; you can sit upon this stile while I run across the fields. You have already walked a long distance. I at first intended making a few calls only in Mrs. Domett's immediate neigh- borhood, but the remembrance of that poor old man made me do to-day what I intended should be the duty of to-morrow. So instead of poverty alone, you have also been the witness of criminality. I do not generally ride to these places, because I think I can do more good bty coming in a more humble manner, though I sometimes have taken Thomas to carry my heavy baskets or bundles for me. Whatever the poor misguided ones are to themselves and associates, I have never received an insult from them." "If Miss Lyle will accept my arm," said Henry, "it is at her service, and will afford her some strength. You have so lightened my basket, Emma, I fear there is little left in it for others." Helen said she was quite rested now, as they had seated themselves on a log during the above conver- sation; so taking the proffered arm of Henry Elliott, they pursued their way.   HELEN AND EBAMA.       99 They stopped at the door of another wretched hovel, and Emma knocked again, but so great was the noise within, that no one answered the call. Her courage might have given way, had not Henry been with her. He now stepped forward and resolutely repeated the knock. The door which was padlocked in the inside was cautiously opened. "Oh! let her come in," said a feeble voice. "It is her, let me see her once more." "Hush, woman! there are others there." "Do not let me intrude," said Emma, softly, I only came to see poor Mrs. Ring' how  is she to- day?" "Oh! walk in, Ma'am," said the old woman, over- come by the gentle voice, " she's as bad as ever. We have some friends here just now, but you need not mind  them, they are only having a fracas; they'll be gone soon." It was the money Emma had given formerly to this woman for taking care of Mrs. Ring until she could be better provided for, as- well as the intuitive respect Emma commanded that led to her being so decently received. Emma went up to one corner of the room, where a   female was extended upon- a mattress, (which Emma had humanely sent her); with consumption gnawing her vitals, daily consuming her little rem-. nant of strength. Around her were men and women wrangling and talking, as if unconscious of her pre- sence, and heedless of her moans. In another corner, crouched upon the floor, was a deformed girl, with a countenance expressive of the deepest sorrow. There was intellect shining from her lustrous eyes, but it told of trial and suffering.  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7224-00000053"/> 100       ELIMWOOD,-- OR, Small children were there, emaciated looking crea- tures, as if youth and joy were things unknown to them. Seven human beings continually resided in this room; which was only twelve feet by thirteen, in size. The old woman, as she was called, rented it, and these miserable ones boarded, if so it might be termed, with her, each paying a small sum to defray the ex- penses. Not a bed was in the room, excepting the mattress sent by Emma. At the time our party arrived there, ten persons were in the apartment. Emma came to see if Mrs. Ring thought she could be removed to the Hospital the next day. While she was talking to her, the poor deformed girl struggled to get across the floor to attract Miss Elliott's atten- tion; as she did so one of the men knocked her brutally down. "Damn the cripple," said the man, " she is always in my way,"' at the same time he hastily left the blouse. "Let me speak one word to the lady"- seeing Helen the nearest, the poor girl uttered these words, looking earnestly at her, endeavoring to touch her dress. Helen shrank from the touch, as if all there was polluting; she, indeed, trembled to be the wit- ness of such scenes. Something in the girl's eye was so beseeching, she could not resist the appeal, and she actually had moral courage to ask, "What she wished?" '"To go away, too. Take me anywhere. I can knit, I can sew. Oh! let me go from here." She spoke these words in low, but thrillingly ear- nest tones.   HELEN AND EMMA.      101 Emma had arranged matters with Mrs. Ringfor her attempted removal, and Henry had given' the- brothl and other matters to the old woman's'care, for- the invalid. Helen now whispered the poor girl's agony. See- ing the strangers were going, the attention of the -in- mates of the room was again drawn to them, and the girl sank into the corner once more. Emma spoke to the woman, asking, " If the young girl paid for her home, there?T" ( Pay, the lazy tike! No, she don't earn, and so she don't get. But I'll have it out of her bones yet." "( Then she must be a burden to you," said Emma.. "I will see her provided for." "She cannot go until she has paid her due." "How much does she owe you?" "It is now six months since a man brought her to my door, and left her with a five dollar note, saying, he would come again by the time that was gone, and he has never been seen since. I could not turn the girl out doors, though she sits and mopes all the time; all she does is to look arter the children, and take care of the house while we are all out on a spree, O and just palaver to the sick body. She never smiles, and is like a dead dog for all the good she does. Pay for her handsomely, and she may crawl off as soon as possible. But what is she good for?" "She is a human being," said Emma, " and needs more pity and care, seeing she is deprived of some of her powers." ( Oh! pray let me go now," said the girl, gaining momentary courage. "She will beat me again, and, ,3         -  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7224-00000054"/> 102       ELMWOOD, -OR, indeed, I cannot do more here than I have done, I am faint and sick. Oh! take me away, anywhere. I have seen better days than these. These scenes are crippling my senses, even as my poor body'is crippled." "Poor girl! you shall go hence. But we are on foot. I will send a carriage for you to-night, if my father is willing, and with his leave you shall share my home until I can find an asylum for you." Henry now spoke seriously to the woman, saying, "I will pay what you demand for the girl's release, but not until I return for her, and she has assured me you have not ill-treated her again." The young girl wept tears of grateful joy, and a shadowy smile lighted up her pale face, leaving an expression of great beauty upon her countenance. The visitors were much moved at this; they now withdrew from the sad scene, and hastened toward home. For a few moments neither of them spoke, each was silent, with their individual, yet varied emotion. Emma, recalling her friend Helen's inexperience in anything of like nature, at last addressed her. "Dear Helen, this is indeed the shady side of life. The sunlight is over our path, but its rays fall not here. It is really as necessary to moral health, to have the genial influences of light, and the warm rays of love and hope, as the beams of the glad sun's rays to our physical well-being. You are sad, dear girl, how can it be otherwise. This is notfancy but reality; and as you have this afternoon seen the deso- lation of poverty, (however caused,) you can never efface the impression from your mind." '       f   HELEN AND EMMA.       103 "I never imagined such abject want as of certain existence; though having seen misery enacted upon the stage of a theatre, I thought it only a scene highly wrought for stage effect. I could not often witness such distress. It makes me almost ill. I should rather pay any amount of money, than go through the like again." "It is very easy, Helen, to open a purse, filled (by a kind hand) with gold, and take from it what we might never know was removed; easy enough to do this, endeavoring to feel we have brought up our con- sciences, even above the market price. But there is no self-denial in the like, no duty performed of self- sacrifice. It is only an abstract action, and we avoid all care or thought upon the subject. We say, poor creatures! take my purse, and we feel no more con- cerning them, neither know how the money may be expended. How silent you are, Henry." "I cannot remove that beseeching look of the young cripple, Mathilde, from my mind's eye. Who or what can she be? How old should you think her? What depth of expression there is in her face." "I should think her fifteen," said Helen. "How dreadful to be a cripple. What are you going to do with her, Emma?  Oh! here is Mr. Elliott coming to meet us.' You tarried so long, my children, I came to seek you on your return. How dispirited you all look. Never mind, though, the Bible says, ' By the sadness of the countenance, the heart is made better.'" "We have witnessed sad scenes, sir," said Henry.

HELEN LYE remained but a- few days longer with her friend Enmma. She had been less gay since she had visited those scenes of distress, recorded in the last chapter. She wished for renewed excitement to obliterate the impressions made upon her, by being an eye-witness to such sorrows. She could riot efface the remembrance while at Elmwood; as the conver- sation often reminded her of it, and Mathilde being an inmate of the house, though Helen did not see her, yet it kept the circumstance connected with that sad afternoon fresh in her memory. It caused her to reflect on life and its duties (ore than she had ever done before, and she disliked reflection, it made one so much trouble. If she did not have time for it, she did not feel such a burden of duty upon her mind. Helen's feelings were, in a measure, changed toward Henry Elliott. He was now humanized, (if we may so express it,) that is, he was a palpability, real flesh and blood; not a visionary perfectionist, an ideal, seen with the roseate hue of love, 'mid the hazy at- mosphere of a dream. She saw him, still handsome, noble in. form and mind; but their wide -difference of taste and feeling, separated her from' the illusion  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7224-00000056"/> 106       ELMWOOD, - OR, she had cherished. His interest in the welfare of the unfortunate; his love of study; his desire for the 'greatest amount of good, to the greatest number of applicants, interfered with Helen's aristocratic ideas! To sum up all-- his wearing the sober garb of rea- son so easily and naturally, as to deprive fancy of a larger share than a flower in the button-hole of his imagination, disenchanted her. Helen Lyle saw she would never be the choice of Henry Elliott, and at once convinced herself he would never suit her for a lower. Henry accompanied Helen to her city residence; and there she parted from him, as it would not have seemed possible, a fortnight before, for her to have done. The veil was drawn aside, and the life of the real had once been seen by the beautiful dreamer. Helen's parents were delighted to receive their pet, and questioned her closely as to her visit. She dwelt enthusiastically upon the topic of the fete her friend Emma had given; and cursorily alluded to the scenes, she had witnessed.' She spoke openly concerning Henry, and her father felt, at once, both relief and dissatisfaction. It would have been, indeed, pleasant for Mr. Lyle to have had the son of his old friend allied to himself and family by a nearer tie. If it could not be, should -he not be thankful Helen's eyes were thus early open- ed to the same. He satisfied himself, at last, that all was for the best, and then went honestly and hope- fully, as ever, on his way. "I am so glad you have returned, darling," said Mrs. Lyle. ' There is to be a grand fancy ball at our   HELEN AND EMMA.       107 friend, Mrs. Osborn's; she was regretting your ab- sence from the city. She said I must certainly send for you, for her nephew, George Osborn, had just re- turned'from Paris; and she wished a star of the first magnitude to grace her rooms on the occasion; and she-knew of no luminary so brilliant as yourself. There's a compliment for you, daughtermine! So you see, dear, we must immediately devise a charac- ter, and some appropriate costume for you." "What shall I take?" said Helen, entering at once with all her heart into the subject. "One of Shaks- peare's heroines? or what?  "Select something you will feel at home in, my dear. The Miss Ellsworths, you know, are exceed- ingly lovely girls, though entirely different in their order of beauty. Grace is the most delicate blonde I have ever seen, while Maude-is richness itself in her severer style. Those dark sparkling eyes, and her great wealth of black hair, make her costume that she has chosen peculiarly appropriate. The sisters are to represent Night and Morning, by making a personi- fication of these divisions of time. Maude Ells- worth, as Night, is to wear a black velvet dress, stud- ded with stars., On the back of her head, the crescent moon in early infancy is seen, rising from out the black cloud her mass of hair will portray. Grace is to be dressed in virgin white, excepting a pale roseate scarf, of the thinnest possible material, twined round her head and floating upon her shoulders. Her curls of golden hair, like fleecy clouds in sportive playful- ness, are left to roam at random, without any indebt- edness to art. Four other young ladies represent the  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7224-00000057"/> 108       ELMWOOD, -- OR, Seasons. Among them, as Spring, you will find your wild little schoolmate, Carrie Lee. Her mother was here yesterday, and told me Carrie's dress was- of white crape, embroidered round the skirt with green floss in imitation of grass. On her head was to be a small wreath of feathery moss, from out of which drooped the blossoms of the lovely snow-drop. A basket on her arm, containing violets and anemones, with the bright ranunculus (or buttercup) as it is usually called, completed her costume.. She is so fresh, and carries so cheerful a prospect in her face, she will identify herself very well as an emblem of the season she represents, if she gets through without perpetrating some foolish act." 4 And then," said Helen, she will say so roguish- ly, 'You must not expect perfection in the spring-time of life.' "Most of the young ladies have already decided what they intend to personify, so we must be active," said Mrs. Lyle. "What does Mrs. Osborn's nephew ;intend to do?" asked Helen. "That is not known at present, my dear." "Well, riother, what say you to my representing Sunlight? As nature, in her moods at will, seems to be the favorite subject, I will even follow suit." "4 That is just the thing, Helen; who knows but Mr. Osborn may be your Shadow. He is very wealthy; that is, he Will be wealthy, as heir-at-law of the old people. Very handsome, and of course stylish, having lived in the firstcircles abroad several years. Let us arrange the dress quickly-then I 3;.,   'HELEN AND EMMA.      109 will order the carriage and apprize my friend, Mrs. Osborn, of your welcome return, and your readiness ' to enter into her plans." "Tell her from me, mother, that I think she had better send forth word her party is to be a personifi- cation of nature, and perchance we may have thun- der, lightning, and rainbows there also." "Now. for your wardrobe, Helen." "I have it, Mamma,- a straw-colored crape dress over a straw-colored silk, with a topaz tiara on my head; bracelets and brooch of the same yellow gem; also a gold girdle round my waist, fastened with a topaz clasp, and an amber wand in my hand." "Charming! charming! darling! You have ex- ceeded, my ideas with your exquisite fancy. You will look magnificently, the color will so become your eyes and complexion." "How I wish we had Emma Elliott here for the sky," said Helen, " and she should be dressed in divine blue, with sapphire gems; she would look so serene that. the sky would not lose, being compared with her beautiful eyes." "And Henry, too," asked Mrs. Lyle, "what part should he have?" "I know   not what would be his 'choice," said Helen, abruptly. "Suppose, mother, you go now to Mrs. Osborn's, while I procure the articles for my expected display." In a few hours mother and daughter met again. Mrs. Lyle had been introduced to Mrs. Osborn's nephew.   He was delightful, fascinating; indeed, a perfect gentleman. Had remarked to her,- (Mrs. 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7224-00000058"/> "O       ELMWOOD, - OR, Lyle) -' That he had never seen her daughter, but anticipated. with rapture, the pleasure., He had heard her so charmingly spoken of, as so very beautiful. He was delighted with her exquisite fancy. He had not decided before; but, would it not be too presump- tuous, would beg humbly to represent-the Shade - for in no other appropriate manner could he follow, even at a distance, so bright a divinity." The foolish mother was delighted at the implied compliment to her child, and asked his costume. "( Ah!. Madam, it must be a suit of gray, a twilight coloring; but black feathers in my black velvet hat, will betoken the approach'of still deeper shade." 1"Is not that most too gloomy, George?" asked his aunt. "Pardon, my dear lady, but the contrast could not be too great between the beauty of Sunlight and the sombre homeliness of Shade." "True," said Mrs. Osborn, "no picture is really beautiful without strong contrasts. Look even now, my dear Mrs. Lyle, from this window, the distant hills in the country seem overshadowed by clouds, while the lowland beneath appears as if one quiet smile." "Lovely!"- said the lady addressed. "Exquisite! 'pon honor!" said the perfumed non- descript, delicately lifting his jewelled eye-glass, to survey the scene. "I must return to my daughter," said Mrs. Lyle, rising to take leave. Mrs. Lyle repeated faithfully every iota of the above conversation to her eagerly listening hild.   HELEN- AND EMMA.       1 The effect produced was such as might have been expected, from the known character of the young lady. We will just (fairy-like to be sure) step into her heart's boudoir.

She could also sew, knit, and embroider beautifully. She was most anxious to be employed to do something for her youthful benefactress.

Mathilde, of her own accord, introduced the sub- ject, giving Emma an opportunity of expressing her wish.

"I believe my mother was a Creole. I know she was very beautiful. My father was a French gentle- man. His name was D'Allenby. We lived in Lou- isiana. My father owned a plantation there. He died when I was quite a child, but I have seen my mother wear his miniature, and often press it to her lips. My parents were both young. I do not think I am more than sixteen years of age. I did not remember my father, and I was so happy. Every attention was paid me when at home; I was not a cripple then. I had a governess and a master in music and drawing. My mother spoke English after my father's death, except, occasionally, I have heard her converse in French. I had a beautiful flower- garden, and how I loved the flowers! They were as dear young friends to me. There were no other chil- dren near but thbse of the slaves belonging to our plantation. We had birds, too, with their sweet songs to cheer us, and I was happy all the day long. There was a gentleman who often came to see Mam- ma, and he brought ime beautiful playthings, and I liked to have him come, until one day, when I found Mamma with her handkerchief to her face in the arbor, and her beautiful eyes -wet with tears. I im- mediately began to cry, which aroused all her ener- gies at once. She arose and led me into the house, butdAd not answer my earnest questions, s    10.  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7224-00000060"/> "4      ELMWOOD,-- OR, "' What made her cry? Who was it?' aI found out from my slave Jennifer, that the white man had been there,-she said,' my mother always cried, after he had visited her.' "' He is a naughty man,' said I, 'I will not touch his playthings any more.' "When he next came, I carried all the things he had given me, and threw them upon the floor at his feet, and to my mother's great surprise, I said, "' Take your things, you naughty man! You make my pretty mother cry.' "I have often recalled my mother's distressingly imploring look, but at the time, I did not understand enough to know why it was. The gentleman whose name was Ponsby, scowled at me in the most dread- ful manner, saying, "( Child worthy of thy father! I see his expression in thy eye.' "(' Forbear!' said my mother, ' Mathilde is a mere child. I do not know what whim has made- her act thus. Go to your room instantly,' and her voice trembled, and she looked sad as the slave carried me away. "I did not know I had done wrong until then, and I began to cry, and ran off and hid my face in Jennifer's lap. And there my mother found me an hour afterward, when Mr. Ponsby had departed. I cried myself to sleep, and the sobs heaving at intervals my little breast, were waking evidences of the sorrow I had felt. My mother never spoke so before, and it most broke my heart." Tears; at the remembrance, flowed from Maa'de's   HELEN AND EMMA       115 eyes, and Emma's mingled with the young girl's, in memory of her childhood's first great-grief. "Jennifer told me," continued Mathilde, 4" that my mother took me in her arms, and kissed me fondly; when I awoke, I was on my own little bed, and my beautiful- mother seated by my side. But oh! she looked so sad. She was more than ever affec- tionate to me, after this, and kept me constantly by her side. One day, several months after, the house seemed all in co fusion, and my mother in great distress. She told me, we were going away,- the slaves were crying bitterly. My own slave, Jen- nifer, to whom I was much attached, knelt at my feet, and was loud in her demonstrations of grief and despair.- I found my mother and myself were to go alone, and leave all our property behind, and to add to my wonder, Mr. Ponsby had already began to act as Master, and would not permit any one to assist us, but the attendants he had brought with him. "My mother informed me, we were going to Massa- chusetts, to reside with a relative of hers, to whom she had written. That we should first go to New Orleans, and sail from there. She had a purse of money and some jewels, which I saw her place in her bosom, as if for safe keeping. The poor slaves groaned in their sorrow, and manifested so much agony at our departure, that Mr. Ponsby threatened them with the lash, if they did not cease their cries and disperse. Mother's personal attendant who al- most worshipped her, entreated to go with us, as did Jennifer, who all unmindful of the punishment await- iWher disobedience, still clung to me. These poor !  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7224-00000061"/> "6       ELMWOOD,  OR, creatures were forced away, while I cried violently at the sight. My mother took me by the hand, and bade me, if I loved her, be a good child, and ask no, more questions, but to keep close by her side. Oh! how my heart did ache to go away, and leave those who loved us so well. What was to become of them without my lovely mother, who had always been so kind to them. We rode off in the carriage with Mr. Ponsby. I had taken such a bitter dislike to the man, I hardly dared to look at him. Most of his attendants remained behind with a person he had brought with him to act as master or overseer in his stead. For a long time no one spoke; at last, I heard Mr. Ponsby say to my mother, "' Do you not yet repent, Alicia? (that was my mother's name). Will you not yield to my wishes?' "I paid great attention, for with the eager curi- osity of childhood, I was anxious to know what all this could mean.   My mother answered firmly, I shall never forget that answer. "'Never! never! I will not so wrong my noble husband, as to marry his deadly enemy. It was you, Jasper Ponsby, you, that made the quarrel, you, that proposed the duel, in which one of the best of men lost his life. Though you have beggared his wife, both of her heart's wealth, and her means of support for herself and child, and she is now seemingly in your power, I tell you, beware, how you ill use her farther, or deceive her. The laws of man forbid you to deprive me of personal freedom; and should you disobey those, and escape punishment, remember the laws of God are paramount to those of man, and      .yy-b /   HELEN AND EMMA.       117 those you cannot escape from. I expect to find let- ters on our arrival at the city, from my friends. I cannot account for their long silence.'- "This was the purport of their conversation ; though then, I did not understand it all, but my mother kept a journal, and I read it afterwards in that. She said, 'the diary was for me, when I grew older.' Mr. Ponsby had promised to see us safely in New Orleans. Instead of that, he had carried us to a place distant from there, and on a plantation of his own. 1 remem- ber, that my mother refused to alight, when he took me in his arms and carried me into the house, and his. servants assisted or rather dragged my unconscious mother after us. -When she recovered, which she did quickly, for her agony would not afford her more than momentary relief, she caught me eagerly by the hand., We were alone with Mr. Ponsby. Oh! how earnestly that dear being entreated our depar- ture. She sued for-her own right, but it was all in vain. Never shall I forget her noble appearance,. sorrowful indeed, but strong as adamant in her first decision regarding Mr. Ponsby's proposal. He told her, no indignity should be offered her, but until business matters were settled, she must remain there. ( We staid in our room all the time for a week, and my mother told me as much as she thought I could understand of our situation, and gave me a few pages of manuscript, which she pinned on the under-dress I then wore. This happened one night just before I went to bed. She held my father's miniature to me, and bade me kiss it, and said he was a good hus- bald, and cruelly treated. She told me also, of the  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7224-00000062"/> "8       ELMWOOD, - OR, Father I still had, who watched over me- always, that I must love Him, and -pray to Him, and be a good child. She then tenderly kissed me, and sat by the bedside until I fell asleep, - In the early morning I awoke, but Mamma was not there. I began to cry and went to the door I found it locked.- I then called aloud for my mother; and seeing the window open, I leaned out to look for her; in so doing, I lost my balance and fell to the ground, becoming in that way the cripple you now see me. "Forgive these tears, Miss Elliott, they fall not in sorrow at my deformity, it is the freshy awakened memory of my mother's last kiss, -of the last hours she sat by my bedside, and held my hand, so fondly in both of hers. "I believe I was very ill after my accident. I re- member I was many weeks in bed, and when I could speak, I was continually asking for my mother. "' The woman who took care of me said, ' she had gone away, and, perhaps, I might never see her again. But to be a good child,-and no one should harm me.' "It seemed, that the little while my mother had been in the house, she had won the love and regard of this woman, who had assisted her to escape in the hope that she would succeed, and reach New Or- leans. She could not take me with her, I was so young and tender, but she pleaded with this person to be watchful and kind to me. She gave her one of her rich jewels as a token, and told her to guard the few pages of manuscript I had upon my gar- ments, as they were all she had then to give mie.   HELEN AND EMMA.       19 She confided-with her own truthful nature implicitly to this woman, who in return, told her she did not like Mr. Ponsby, and would be glad to leave his place. That she came there to teach' the slaves some domestic employment, and should return home the first excuse she could reasonably make. She promised to remain with me until she heard from Mamma, or to take me away with her when she left. "When Mr. Ponsby found my mother had actually gone, which he did not discover for two days after, as he had been obliged to return to our plantation, he was extremely angry, and would no doubt have vent- ed his anger upon me, but I was ill, and he knew a cripple for life; a sort of Doctor attended me, but I often think, had I then had proper care, I might now have the proper use of my limbs. Mr. Ponsby made great search for Mamma, but it was all in vain, and he gave out word that a crazy relative had escaped from his plantation, for whom he felt much anxiety, and offered rewards for her recovery, describing her appearance. -c I mourned bitterly for my mother, but the woman was faithful to me, she taught me to knit, sew and embroider, and seemed pleased to have anything near her that she could love. I could no-t tell why that man kept me there after my mother had left. I afterwards learned the reason. I remained there several years, as I could not get away, and indeed, did not know where to go. I thought Mr. Ponsby had forgotten all about me, I scarcely ever saw him, and he never appeared to notice me. I remained  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7224-00000063"/> 120       ELMWOOD ,--OR, mostly in my own apartment, which was next that of the good woman who had been so kind to me. She had the general care of the house, and was too necessary to- Mr. Ponsby, for him to interfere with little matters.- Sometimes two of the 'slaves would form a chair with their arms, and carry mne about the, house. I really think Mrs. Agnes remained on my account, she had no near relatives of her own,-and had learned to love me, I was so dependant on her care.                f "One night, as I sat upon my couch reading to Agnes, and she was at work by my side, Mr. Ponsby knocked at the door, and coming in, told Agnes, "' To pack up a bundle of clothes for me, as he was going to send me away the next morning.' "' Where to, sir?' she asked. ( To some friends for her to be taken care of,' he replied. ' She is of no use here now, or anywhere else for that matter. She loqoks too much like her father;' this last sentence he uttered without being aware of his words. But Agnes and I remembered it. "I had read my mother's manuscript, in which she said, this Mr. Ponsby had been a suitor of hers, before she had married my father. That she had never liked him, or encouraged him in any way. He hated Papa for being a successful rival, and had led him into a quarrel, which had ended in a duel that terminated his life. Before my father died, he had lost considerable property, and had also endorsed a npte for a friend, which obliged him to mortgage his plantation, as his friend was unable to meet his lia-   HELEN AND EMMA,       121 bilities. After Papa's death, this mortgage was sold to Mr. Ponsby, who had tried every means to win my mother, who was, as I have said, very beautiful, to become his wife. She so steadily refused, and clung so fondly to the memory of her husband, and to me, of whom she said, that I looked at her with' my dear father's eyes,-that he bought the mort- gage, and succeeded, at last, in getting our property into his hands. He promised to see us in safety at New Orleans, whenrce we could sail for the North to visit my mother's relatives. This was the substance of all but the last page of the manuscript, which was hurriedly written. "It told me my mother was fearful of remaining longer at Mr. Ponsby's, but she would not cease in her efforts, until I was restored to her. To trust to Agnes, as she had promised to be kind to me. Never to be in the presence of Mr. Ponsby alone, and above all, to trust in God, and daily pray for Him to watch over me. Again and again she blessed me, and her last words were written as if in fervent prayer. - Here is her dear manuscript; I have almost worn it out, for it has been continually upon my breast. "The next day, I was taken in a  carriage to a town many miles off, and here I was compelled to part with Agnes. It was with bitter grief, for I felt she was the only earthly friend I then had. "Agnes had told Mr. Ponsby she would leave him entirely, if I was removed from her care. He seemed jealous of her kindness to me, and paying her wages, bade her depart, after we had carried her thus far on "  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7224-00000064"/> 122      ELMWOOD, -OR,            I her way,- for at this town she could find convey- ance whither she intended to go. "( I suffered much as I rode in silence by Mr. Pons- by's side. I prayed God to help and protect me, and carry me to my mother. I had never entirely -given up the hope of seeing her again on earth, though Agnes assured me she must be dead, or we should have heard some tidings from her. "At length Mr. Ponsby spoke. Your mother was a -fool! She deserved her death. She could have had a handsome home, plenty of slaves, and been happy, but she chose otherwise, and met her fate.' "'. Tell me! oh! tell me, where is my mother?' "'In her grave, child.' "' Dead! is my mother really dead! oh then, let me die, also,' I said in my grief. ( Why should I live longer? oh, my mother! my mother!'-- My anguish was dreadful, I found I had clung to the hope of meeting her again, more firmly than I was aware of. "'I only retained you,' continued Mr. Ponsby, ' to satisfy my revenge, by sending you a cripple to your mother, to punish her fool-hardiness. But she is gone. I have no need of you now. So you may go where you please. "'Why, why, did you not let me follow Agnes?'  I asked. "'I wished ,to punish. her for her obstinacy in i leaving my plantation.'  "'How did my dear mother die? Oh! why did you not tell me before? Where was it?' said I, in the courage of despair.   HELEN AND EMMA.      123 "'It is not a month since I heard of it myself; though she died in an obscure situation, not more than one hundred miles from my place. It was all by accident I found it out at all. "'Some traders came to my house, who had among their possessions a likeness of your father. I asked how they came by it? They said, an old woman sold it to them for the value of the pearls around the locket. She said it was on the neck of a crazy lady that died in her hut some years ago. That she found -her in the forest, perfectly exhausted, and- carried her into her house, but she had a fever and died. She called, in her sickness, for her husband and her baby, and then nothing could be made from her words. She gradually weakened, and died a week after she was found.' There was a small sum of money about her, which the woman paid for her burial, but her clothes were ragged and her flesh bruised. All she had was the locket, of any value about her, and that was around her neck.' "'Oh! my beloved mother, what must have been thy agony,' I exclaimed. ( Have you the locket, sir?' I asked. "'I bought the trinket of the men.' "' Oh! give it to me then, I do beseech you, grant my prayer! give it to me,' and I looked up in his face as I spoke. That look seemed to decide him. ' You do not remember your father,' he said. "' Not him, but his memory; and my mother wore the picture next her heart.' "' See here, girl,' said he, and he broke the glass, spat upon the picture, and then crushed the ivory tablet into a hundred pieces.  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7224-00000065"/> 124      ELMWOOD, - OR, "I felt as if I must be the next victim, and I think I was quite willing then to die. "Mr. Ponsby said he was going on business to the New England States. 'You shall go with me, Mathilde, I will seek an asylum for you;' he spoke these words as if to awake me from my dumb agony. "I was bewildered with all I had heard and seen of the man. I cared little what became of me then. I knew I had friends in the north, somewhere, but had forgotten their address, and thought they would not wish to be burdened with a poor cripple. "I remained silent for ' hours, but obeyed the directions Mr. Ponsby gave me. He paid for my being taken care of, until we reached Boston. He then gave a man some bank notes, and told him to seek a good asylum for me, where I might earn my bread, or a pittance in some way. The money was to be for my benefit also. 4 He bade me good-bye, saying, ' Mathilde, I really loved your mother, and it is only on that account I did not leave you to perish. Had you more resem- bled her, I might have aided you farther.' "How love in any form could have entered that cruel heart, I could not understand. All seemed so dark in his character. Perchance, conscience awoke, as he recalled the dreadful deeds he had committed, and called too loud for him to resist its summons. "The man to whose care Mr. Ponsby gave me, brought me by railway to this town, carrying me to that wretched place from which you rescued me, six months ago, I think it was. He was a base impos- tor. He gave me in charge of the old woman,   HELEN AND EMMA.      125 giving her a small sum of money; promising to re- turn and pay my expenses. I have never seen him since; I am certain it was as much as one hundred dollars that Mr. Ponsby gave the man, who then ap- peared to be honest and well-disposed. He was a porter in a store. He treated me very civilly on the way, but I suppose the money was too great a temptation, as Mr. Ponsby did not require anything farther than his taking me away to some place of safety. He never expected to see the man again. I was off his hands, and I suppose, he hoped, off his conscience also. "I do not believe the man he employed knew the dreadful nature of the place he carried me to; he seemed a stranger in the town, and undecided where to stop, but seeing the woman at her door standing alone, and as it was near night fall, he gave me to her charge, which she accepted, tempted by the ready money, and the promise of future payment. "And since, my  dear Miss Elliott, you cannot imagine the horrid scenes I have witnessed, nor the brutal treatment I have received! I have been made to do all the work my condition would possibly allow.  Night after night, have I gone without a mouthful of 'food to my poor corner of the floor, and wept myself to sleep. Only in my dreams have I been happy, then the sunbeam was over my head, and the sweet singing birds on the trees. And my mother, my beautiful mother, was holding my hand again in hers, and I was so, so happy. But in the morning I awoke to my daily life, and- sorrow and wretchedness were over me, yet I earnestly prayed 1 11'  ,1  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7224-00000066"/> 126       ELMWOOD, -- OR, God to deliver me from these scenes, and he heard -me, and you, his dear young angel came, and once more I am glad. Oh! I am so grateful to God and you. And I breathe the pure air of heaven, and the dearer air of kindness and love, and dream again of my mother and home, and I awake, and find a home still, and a friend, and feel as if my heart was not large enough for the gratitude there is in it for your kindness.

Mathilde was attired in one of Emma's dresses, her fine hair parted over her intellectual forehead, her rich hazel eyes moistened with heartfelt emotion; she was, as she had pictured her mother, most beautiful in face.

HELEN Lyle attended the ball she was anticipat- ing, and looked very beautiful in her fancy attire. ( Mr. George Osborn was enraptured with such a brilliant belle, but was obliged to keep in the shade, for the time, then present. The affair passed of finely. The next day found our Parisian gallant at the door of Miss Lyle's dwelling, inquiring for her health after the fatigue of the preceding evening. Helen was coming down stairs into the hall, as the servant opened the door, and of course he walked in, and she received him in propria persona. This was the commencement of a continued series of visits. Soon rumor whispered, "Only think how attentive Mr. Osborn is to Miss Lyle. They must be engaged. I have no doubt of it. Money on both sides. Capital match! Both move in the first circle, both young and handsome." Again scandal with her envy speaking tongue. 4"What a dreadful flirt Helen Lyle is, and so affected. She rolls her eyes up, if one chances to look at her, thinking by so doing, she may resemble the Madonna. She owes most of her beauty to dress. She has not the least expression.   HELEN AND EMMA.       129 "' As for Mr. Osborn,he is only a walking dandy; I should think employed by the tailors to exhibit their goods, for he never dresses two days alike. And so conceited he is. He looks to me as if he had a mirror before him, in which he could see the reflection of his own pretty face, and the self-satisfied simper is ever on his countenance. He has not much fortune, after all, in his present personal right. He is only the acknowledged heir of those antiquated Osborn's that gave the ball the other night. How ridiculous they looked, dressed out in their finery, and they so openly admire their stripling nephew. I accepted their invi- tation, for the purpose of finding something to ridi.- cule, and enjoyed it to my heart's content." The above sentences contain the sifted meanings gathered from the babble of the small-talk circle, that either belonged to, or surrounded the fashionable clique. For once, rumor was right. The warm, summer sun of a beautiful morning in July smiled upon Helen Lyle, a betrothed bride. She was to be mar- ried in the fall, and make the tour of Europe with her husband. Helen thought herself exceedingly happy. She had met one who apparently idolized her; she had no care upon her mind, no anxiety for the future. She lived only in the present, and that present was a continual round of engagements, out of compliment to her new position. Then the pre- parations for her wedding attire afforded another cause of excitement. She must drive hither and thither, order this and that, for her wardrobe; as she had plenty of funds at her disposal, this was only a source of pleasure.

Mr. Lyle was not altogether satisfied. He was sorry to part from his child. 'His old fashioned no- tions would have been better gratified, if Helen's lover had more resembled a good, plain specimen of a man; than, as he said, " tricked out with so many set-offs. He liked to see, at least, half of a human face, but now, Mr. Osborn only allowed his eyes and nose to display themselves. His forehead was par- tially covered up. His cheeks burdened with such a pair of whiskers; and his upper lip and chin, actually hid in a forest of underbrush. He must say he did not like that; neither the gold chains and trinkets about his neck, or the diamond rings on his delicate perfumed hands. All do very well for an exhibition day, or a fancy ball; but to go through the trials and perplexities of every-day life, he should rather have a clean face, and a pea-jacket." Mrs. Lyle was shocked to hear such opinions ad- vanced by her husband. She told him, "' Helen's happiness was at stake; that Mr. Osborn only adopted the Parisian style; that he was an excellent young man, very aristocratic, wealthy, and perfectly adored Helen,"  "If the dear child has set her mind on it, why let it be," said the father; "' but I would it could have been another." "Who, pray?" asked Mrs. Lyle. "Henry Elliott, for instance," he replied. "Why, husband, you seemed opposed to that, and objected, when I thought of him for Helen."

"Dear me! wife, what unaccountable beings you women are. I was not considered much of a catch when you married me, and I think you have made out passably well." "Indeed, I have, Mr. Lyle; but times have changed since then. You could make a fortune in those days; now, if one is not made for you to begin with, why you are nobody and cannot get along." "Then you are one of those, wife, who think poverty almost a crime?" "The world considers it one." "How so-?" "If a man is poor, it is his fault, they say, and it is of no use to help him. He has no energy. Why don't he go to California or Australia? He's above his means, we cannot afford to patronize such inac- tivity of habit." "Well, wife, that partakes of the same character as a conversation I heard the other day. I heard Mr. Jarvis remark of a fine, gentlemanly looking young man, who had a letter of introduction to him, in which his assistance was solicited to enable him to procure some kind of business." "' Why don't he work?? asked Mr. Jarvis. "'He wishes to work mentally,' said a friend of the stranger.

"I should think, wife, Mr. Jarvis belonged to the class with whom you have been conversant: but we will leave that topic, for one of deeper interest to us, at present. You say, Helen imagines herself really in love?" "Oh, yes! and the time draws so near for her wedding. I shall miss her much. But then it will be such an advantage for her to go abroad. It is all the fashion to go to Europe in these times." "Where did we go, wife? How, pray, did we live without a wedding tour? I believe we rode from your father's mansion to my own, about three miles distance; and then settled down to our matrimonial state with repose and comfort." "Oh! times have so altered. Do you forget that the wheel has had several revolutions since then, and those old ideas are buried in oblivion." "What, wife, comfort and repose? bless me! I don't knowr but what you are right, though. For repose is only an ideal in your world, where there is constant excitement. It is only twenty-five years ago that we were married. You are not a very old woman yet, Emmeline, and you don't look half so old as you really are."   HELEN AND EMNMA.      133 "Husband! you never will do for fashionable life. It is considered extremely rude to speak of a lady's age." "Hem! when that lady is one's own wife, and to her hearing only?"- "Certainly, the principle holds good." "What is admissible in your polished circle?" Mr. Lyle was interrupted by Helen. "Father, how glad I am you have not gone out, George has bought a superb pair of greys, with silver harness, and the most exquisite little affair of a ba- rouche. He has sent the coachman to bring them to the door. Do look out and see them." "Well, to please you, little mad-cap! But why did he not wait awhile?" "For fear he should lose them, sir." "And now must probably go to a year's expense in keeping them." "Mr. and Mrs. Osborn will drive them out occa- sionly," said Helen, blushing, ," and they are such superb creatures!" "Fancy is a pretty expensive folly, daughter, and very deceitful withal. It will not do to give her free action, she must be held in by the reins of reason." "That sounds like Emma Elliott, Papa, and re- minds me I had a letter from Elmwood to-day, in which she says, Henry and herself will come to the wedding. She told me all about Mathilde D'Allenby, her adopted sister, that now is; it was quite a tale.

But I fear much the result of this marriage." "Because the parties are so young and thoughtless, sir?" "-One reason; but Emma, you well know when two young persons are what is termed engaged to each other, they imagine the happiness of life bound up in themselves. Each unconsciously acts a part, it may be in all honesty, but they endeavor to play the agreeable to each other, and to render as accept- able as possible their personal appearance. The faults of each are generally hidden under a veil; and the drapery of love conceals all deformity in person or mind. But after marriage, when the veil s  partially drawn aside, one imperfection comes to view, then another, and another, until these very indi- viduals are obliged to acknowledge the truth, that Cupid is indeed a blind god."'

"I pray she may not soon awake from her dream, Emma, unless it is before the event takes place. Helen is, I am sorry to say, wanting in principle, that is, she is not actuated. by any ruling motive of right in her conduct. She acts entirely from impulse." "She is remarkably amiable, sir, for an acknowl- edged belle." "It may be on account of ever reigning supreme; supposing a rival should step forward, would it not disturb her equanimity?" - "It is true, sir, so far all has been sunlight in Helen's sphere."l "What is she to do, if adversity should befall her, or the cares and perplexities of life cross her path?" "I do feel anxiety for her, and were I competent, would write her a friendly letter of advice." "I doubt if advice would avail much at this crisis ; in her life. How important it is that children should be so educated, as to be able to maintain their self- possession, even in the smiling or cloudy hour. To have a reliance in themselves, through the active principle instilled into their youthful minds, teaching them to look upward with the eye of faith, and rest in the arms of divine love, equally in sunshine and in storm.

"Better, my dear, to have- fewer, unless principle governs the impulses of those united in the holy bond of matrimony.  My old friend Lyle is a sober, honest nman, but too indolent for his own good, or the welfare of those connected with him.

WHAT a fine illumination! Persons passing by stop to gaze at the elegant mansion so brilliantly lighted. It is on account of Miss Helen Lyle's marriage, and the wedding party of that eve- ning. It was the marriage of her only child, and Mrs. Lyle was not sparing in the expenses of the occa- sion. The company was large, and beauty, elegance and grace were there congregated, as were also folly, wealth and pride. In a beautiful arbor composed of flowering shrubs and plants, with wreaths of natural flowers inter- woven, stood the bride and groom, already man and wife, receiving the congratulations, heartless and sincere, of their acquaintances. Helen Lyle, or more properly speaking, Helen Os- born, was a splendid, not a lovely bride; most too brilliant for our taste. Woven in the thick, classic braid of hair around her head were diamonds, gleaming like stars from out a cloudy sky. Upon her neck, a costly necklace of the same rich   HELEN AND EMMA       139 gem, lying like crystal ice drops on the new fallen snow. Her robe was of rich white brocade, with a long train edged with silver embroidery. Lace of the finest texture, embellished the corsage and sleeves of her dress, the latter were short, and looped up with diamond circlets. Slipped under the braid of her hair and hanging in folds around her, was the gossamer bridal veil, in itself, a little fortune to a destitute one, it was so costly. Place her anywhere, and you would single her out for the bride. She reigned preeminent, far above competition. The diamonds were presented her by the aunt of her husband. The bridegroom looked fresh from the hands of barber, tailor and cordwainer; patent-righted indi- viduals, to supply the needs of the beau monde. Let that suffice, with this addition, that all that could be seen of the young man's face, was in fashionable symmetry with his garb.  He was indeed an ex- quisite. The young couple left home the following morn- ing; Mrs. Lyle endeavored to be composed, but when the parting hour came, the mother overcame the fashionist, and she wept real tears of sorrow at her child's departure. The winter season of gayety was among the things of the past. And now the migratory birds of fashion and impulse were preparing for the watering places on the sea-shore.

They intended visiting various portions of their native land, during the lovely months of May and June. Mrs. Lyle would remain at Saratoga during July, visiting Newport in August. They had heard several times from Helen; her letters were fraught with exciting scenes, full of life and spirit. They seemed to bespeak a happy heart, contented with her lot. She had already visited Scotland and Ireland, and returned again to Eng- land. The last account received, she was soon to go to Paris, where her husband told her, "the nectar 'and ambrosia of life were to be found." A little extract from one of her letters, will show us that Helen Osborn is, as yet, but a daguerreotype of Helen Lyle. "Oh! dear mother, we go next to Paris. I am delighted! There, reigns the Queen of Fashion! I shall try to become one of her subjects. George says, that dress is one of the fine arts in Paris, and the artists are real gods and goddesses, as regards divinity of taste. l "The English people seem cold, to me,- I feel frigid in their society; and their street garb is so plain, be- reft of all extra ornament.

There is need of more conscientious firmness in many of those men, that make the law their study, and practise it 9 professionally. To be true to themselves and others, their moneyed gain must not be put into the scales of consideration, after they have undertaken a case for a client.

There are many persons, my son, both in and out of this profession, who would scoff at the views T have advanced, and consider me a sophist.'

From many of the temptations some are obliged to encounter, I shall be entirely free; owing to your liberality of purse in the settlements you have already bestowed for my benefit. Therefore, I shall never consider my fee, the sum total; but only an incidental consequence. I would hope, that were I otherwise situated, it might be the same; yet much less merit will be mine, as you see, sir, than if the fee was to me my only re- source for the daily necessaries of life."

"How you blush, Emma, when you talk to Hen- ry," said Mathilde. "Why, Mathilde, you are pleased to be roguish this morning; you should never call one's attention to personalities of that kind, when in company with a third person," said Henry. "Oh!

"It is just two years to-day, since you visited that wretched hovel, and restored me to my former self, making me your friend and sister. Oh!

What should I have been had it not been for your care? What might I not have become?   The remembrance is too much for me, I shudder at the very thought." "It seems to me, my young sister, Mathilde," in- terrupted Henry, "that you allow your feelings to gain the mastery over you.

"So we will," said Mathilde. "And now we have come to that lovely I Lake of Shadows.' How beau. tiful Is it not? How lovely!" "There again, Mathilde, a few  moments since you were in raptures with sunshine, now it is the perfection of shade. But this is a fine sheet of water, truly; how transparent it seems, reflecting so vividly the minutest leaf on the overhanging trees." "What a place for thought," said Emma. "How should we feel if all our motives, impulses and acts were thus accurately delineated" to the outward eye of one another, and our hearts possessed the trans- lucency of this lake?

I think I seldom, if ever, heard you address her by ally other title than her Christian name. I happened to think of this just now, so I asked you."

There is Mr. Elliott and another gentleman going up the avenue." "Who is it, Henry?" asked Emma. "I know not, Emma. He looks like a Southerner, I never saw him before." At the mention of Southerner, it was Mathilde's turn to blush; she felt the warm blood flow rapidly over her system, and a chill almost immediately suc- ceed, as her past hopes and fears awoke in her mind. She had felt as such imaginative natures often do, a trembling presentiment of something to occur, ever since she saw the expression oh Mr. Elliott's face at   ELMWOOD, --OR, -49 breakfast. She did not know as it would be con- nected with herself, but she knew, as she afterwards said, there was an event of some kind to happen. How shall we account for this?

PARTIALLY reclining upon a divan in a luxuriously furnished boudoir, with hair and dress a la neglige, was our young friend, Helen Osborn., She had been only a few months in Paris, and looked, even then, care-worn and fatigued. Her little foot, in its neat satin slipper, was impatiently striking the floor; every few moments she suddenly started up, as if she de- tected a well known step, and again sank back disap- pointed. There were traces of tears upon her cheeks. What could it mean? "What time is it?" she asked of her maid. "Half past three, Ma'am." "So late as that, Netta?" "Even so, would that my dear lady would disrobe and seek to find some rest. You will be ill, Ma'am, if you are so much distressed." Netta was a privileged person. She had attended Helen at home, and accompanied her abroad. She had a good education, and was a superior woman for her situation in life. Helen had tried to persuade Netta to retire; but the faithful domestic would not leave her mistress to bear her sorrow in solitude. She knew that it might be daylight before Mr. Osborn returned; as the past   HELENX AND EMMA.. 1*1 two weeks -he had been very irregular in this paTr- ticu'lar, often remaining out the whole night. Poor Helen! the shadow had began to follow her in ear- nest. "Go to bed, Netta, I beg of you. I do not need any assistance, it is my wish that you go." ( I will leave you, if you insist upon it; but do not hesitate, my dear lady, to speak to me, as I shall Olrly retire to my little room. I cannot go- to bed, for you may need my services; you are very pale, and seem suffering with fatigue." 4; Well, go, good Netta, you are very thoughtful." "Can it be," said Helen, when left by herself, "can it be, possible, that George intentionally neglects .;! What does this mean?

She had received also various attentions from her husband's former friends. She had written to her mother, after a month's residence, that Paris was the most deliglitful spot in the world; so tasteful and elegant were its inhabitants in their appearance.' She only wished her mother could be present to partake of her enjoy- ment. A. las! another month! and Helen had not again written home, so changed were her feelings. From her childhood she had been the first object at home of her parents, who almost idolized her; and her hus- band had seemed to feel, if possible, even a greater enthusiasm of idolatry. Therefore, neglect in any form would come most unkindly upon one so accus- tomed to homage. In riding with her husband, Helen had several times encountered an open carriage, occupied by two ladies, both of whom were beautiful, but the younger, apparently about eighteen years of age, was one of the loveliest beings Helen had ever gazed upon. Her husband manifested strong emotion on seeing these ladies, and bowed with great empress- ment of manner. Mr. Osborn on being interrogated by his wife, an- swered, they were friends of his when he tarried in Paris before,- Madame and Mademoiselle D'Arblay. He then immediately changed the subject. Why it was, Helen could not say, but a sudden pang of jealousy came into her mind concerning this said Mademoiselle, and all because her husband was- so silent.

Even when questioned, he avoided affording farther information than that already given. The dark flower of mistrust had sown its seed in Helen's heart, she was unknowingly culturing it to the detriment of her happiness and comfort. Helen thought her husband encouraged the atten- tions of a certain titled friend of his -to herself. That is, he accepted in her name, invitations to visit public places of resort from the Count Tortenay; and these visits were generally made with the Count alone, un- accompanied by her husband, who gave the excuse of some previous engagement preventing the possibility of his joining their party, as his apology. Worldly and fashionable had been Helen's educa- tion; and thoughtless and even selfish as she was, / still the virtuous proprieties of life were fully impressed upon her mind. She was too truly American, to then understand the extended latitude which the French nation permits in general society, and the attentions, perhaps meaningless on the part of those who offered them, were received almost as insults by our fair friend. Helen felt peculiar dislike to Count Tortenay, be- cause she beard him remark to her husband in French, "How enchantingly Mademoiselle D'Arblay looked last night; you were so engaged, Osborn, I felt almost jealous to think you had two such idols to worship." A ,significant sign from her husband silenced the speaker, and he also changed the subject, as Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7224-00000080"/> 1'54      ELEWOOD,- OR, Osborn had formerly done. This little episode served farther to convince Helen, that the young belle had some mystery thrown around her, which she was not to be allowed to unravel. It was these surmises that made her so uncomfortable, even before her husband had remained so late from his Hotel. She had now firmly resolved not to let another day pass without having a confidential interview with her husband, and endeavoring to solve the enigma of his wanderings.

"He has a fine plantation there; he married his wife in Massachu- setts; she was a daughter of Colonel Peabody's. Mr. Amory has, important business here, and will remain a few days with us. I hope all attention may be paid to his comfort." "Thank you, kindly, sir; I must beg my fair friends to give themselves no uneasiness on my account. I have a daughter at home about twelve years of age, that my young friend," said he, addressing Mathilde, "much resembles in the form of her face and fea- tures."

Gently and so gracefully did Mathilde wheel her chair (which was one made for her express use) into the hall, one scarcely observed the interruption. She then rang the bell attached to the chair, which was answered by a domestic who placed her in a kind of wicker car, in that way she was easily drawn up by simple machinery to the level of her own apartment. Mathilde at first occupied a room below, but express- ing a desire one day to go up and down stairs like the rest of the family, her kind friends, to render her every aid to take away, as much as possible, from the deprivations her misfortune caused her, adopted these means for her benefit. "What do you think, Mr. Amory?" said Mr. El- liott, in a low tone. "She is very like her mother in personal appear- ance (the eyes excepted.) Her voice is in the same key, and has that peculiar melody which was so de- lightful in Alicia when she spoke. How patient the young girl seems under her trial; but I noticed a nervous- susceptibility about her; and I much fear my presence has recalled unpleasant thoughts to her mind." "It could not be otherwise," replied Mr. Elliott, "as the South witnessed her early sorrows and the commencement of her trials."

These friends, of whom  Mr. Amory's wife is the nearest, being the cousin of Mathilde's mother, had removed only a few months before South, on account of the tendency to consumption in all Mrs. Amory's family, and her own health being so delicate, this course was advised: -"The missive forwarded by Mr. Ponsby was sent North first, and then re-mailed South again, and some time elapsed ere Mathilde's friends received the intel- ligence.  They had never heard anything of the fate of Mathilde's another, since the letter they received after her husband's death, informing them of the mel- ancholy event, and giving them  the expectation of seeing her soon at their own house. "When Mr. Amory saw the address of Mr. Ponsby, he discovered that they only resided some fifty miles apart. He immediately decided to go first to Mr. "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7224-00000082"/> 158      ELMWOOD, - OR, Ponsby's, and gain more particulars than his letter conveyed; and as he had business North, to proceed thence for traces of the child. '"Mathilde's mother and Mrs. Amory were almost inseparable in their girlhood; and the love the latter bore her own fair child, spoke with a true mother's heart for the lone orphan of her beloved friend. - She wished her husband to bring Mathilde home, and great was the anxiety she felt lest the search might prove unavailing.. "She spoke to her little Julia of her unfortunate cousin who was a cripple, without father or mother to sympathize with her condition; she who had suf- fered so much, until the beautiful emotions of youth implanted strong affection in the child's mind. She was ardent in her desire to strew flowers of kindness on the desolate path of the orphan, and be herself the medium to make her cousin forget the weak limbs that failed her their support. "Mr. Amory will tell you the result of his interview with Mr. Ponsby." "I hastened, my young friends," said Mr. Amory, ' to the beside of that man, and found him a prey to remorse of spirit, while already the hand of death seemed to have commenced leading him from earth. He appeared very thankful that a human being had come to his aid in the capacity of a friend, or of one who did not openly curse him. "An old woman performed the duties of nurse un- der the promise of high wages. His household was almost desolate. He had sold his slaves, and invested his money in bank and railroad stock, both in New   HELEN AND EMMA.       159 Orleans and New York.  All his affairs seemed to have been arranged, as regarded his moneyed interest, as if he had been aware his days were numbered as very few upon the earth. "Mr. Ponsby could not buy with all his wealth, at that late hour, the priceless gift - affection. His life had been so tyrannical, so harsh and ungenial, that it withered all thoughts of a softer nature in any one heart towards him. He had been an implacable en- emy; he was hated and feared by his slaves, who obeyed only through the wretched bond of slavery, but whose loftier natures looked contemptuously on the arbiter of their destiny for the time being. "His love for Alicia (Mathilde's mother) seems to have been the only kindling within of any natural warmth, and that was more akin to passion, than to the self-sacrificing nobleness inspired by the holy in- fluence of sincere affection. Yet this emotion for Alicia had entailed great consequences upon the main, as well as upon others. "Mr. Ponsby had been maddened by the success of a rival, and he was determined to be revenged. He sought long for an opportunity to insult and arouse D'Allenby to a quarrel with himself. Through others he offered every inducement to lead him to habits of dissipation. He even hired an emissary to throw ob- stacles in his success in life. This agent but too well succeeded in working on the weak parts of D'Allen- by's character and his chivalrous ideas of honor, until he had been obliged to mortgage his estates. When that was fully accomplished, he was informed by the author of his misfortune, that he' had done that for  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7224-00000083"/> 160      ELMWOOD,  OR, the purpose of revenge; and called upon D'Allenby to meet him in a duel of life or death, or be branded with dishonor, as well as beggared in the free use of his property. " The quick blood of D'Allenby rushed impetuously through his veins, and in his madness he accepted-- nay, demanded an immediate meeting. "The affair was arranged ere he dared communi- cate to his gentle wife the information; he did so only a short time previous to his leaving home to accept the challenge. "Dearly as D'Allenby loved his young wife and lovely child, the thoughts of them acted only as a stimulant to his already excited brain,-and he was impelled to rush on by a power, he sought to think impossible for him to control. "Alicia was in anguish at the recital of his wrongs and his determination. She entreated him to desist, to treat the whole with scorn. What was poverty compared to crime? She brought her young daughter and held her before him, as a silent but eloquent pleader. "Though D'Allenby's whole frame seemed writh- ing with emotion, and the very spirit within almost leaving him in his last embrace of those so dear,- those he might never more behold on earth,--yet above all, that scathing idea of honor, so false, yet so powerful in the unreconciled hearts of the young and passionate, held its tarnished shield, and all must be sacrificed to erase the imaginary spot from its posi- tion. "You know the result, my young friends, and the   HELEN AND EMMMA.      161 other particulars of this painful affair. Let me return to Mr. Ponsby. "Never did I witness so desolate and gloomy a death; so surrounded by shadows, that hope, in any form, seemed all but banished from the scene. "Mr. Ponsby entreated me to remain, saying,- ' Heaven had heard one prayer, at least, and answered it, by sending some person to whom he could unbur- den himself ere he died.' He gave'me a short history of 'his life. "He was born in England. He said the unkind influences exerted upon his mind when a child, by those under whose guardianship he had been placed, had a lasting effect -upon his character. His mother died when he was quite young. He came to Amer- ica, where, by his own industry and tact (as he said) he acquired his property. He seemed perfectly sen- sible, until the last day of his life, when his ravings were agonizing to hear. "One moment he addressed Mathilde's father, and pronounced violent anathemas upon him; then ear- nestly speaking to Alicia in imploring terms; again, as if sudden remorse began to gnaw upon his vitals, he would exclaim with great vehemence- "'Nay, nay, Alicia, I did not do it. As I live, I did not cripple the poor child. She did fall. She did. Listen! Oh! believe this; bad as I am, I did not cripple the child. Those eyes- her father's; ay, for those I hate her. Where -is she? I have searched the whole country for Alicia.' "These unconnected sentences appeared  to be spoken as if his whole soul was throbbing in aWgony "*  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7224-00000084"/> 162       ELMWOOD- OR7 "In the night he passed away from earth, without a friend to shed the tear of sympathy and regret. To himself he lived, and by himself he died. "I remained in his apartment during the evening, retiring about eleven o'clock to rest; the old nurse saying, 'the physician thought he might continue in this way several days, as the disease had affected his brain.' I did not know he was dead until the morning. The nurse told me, 'she was so exhausted with watching she fell asleep, and when she awoke he was a corpse.' The scene was so sad, that the remembrance affects me still. To think in this wide world of ours, so full of human love and sympathy, that man had not attached, in any manner, one friend to mourn his loss. His must have been a rare case, I fain would hope. "After seeing him properly buried, I left for New Orleans, to consult his lawyer in that city. "Having paid the nurse, and obeyed to the very letter the directions Mr. Ponsby gave before he died, I sent advertisements descriptive of Mathilde, and her unfortunate condition, with the address of my hotel, could any information be found concerning her, on to the leading papers in Massachusetts. The one in the Boston Atlas attracted your father's notice. He did not, however, see it until the day after my own arrival in Boston. "Having made many inquiries in the city regarding Mathilde, I was informed that a young cripple an- swering to my description, (far as I could give one,) resided in the family of Mr. Elliott, of Elmwood. A mutual acquaintance of your father's and mine   HELEN AND EMMA.      163 offered to bring me to his residence, and we overtook Mr. Elliott on his way to the office conveying a letter in answer to my advertisement. He welcomed me cordially to his home, and our friend returned to town. Soon as I saw the young girl, I felt convinced of her identity with the one I was seeking. "And now, Miss Elliott, if you will communicate the tidings to her, and see if she will accompany me home, I will thank you greatly. I think she would receive them more quietly from you." "I will do my best, Mr. Amory, but indeed, sir, we should miss Mathilde so much. She has become dear to us all." "Emma will feel her loss exceedingly, sir," said Henry, "I do not see how we can give her up." "It shall be left with her, shall it not?" asked Mr. Elliott, "to decide if she will go or remain at Elm- wood." "Certainly," replied Mr. Amory, "we would not assume any right; only a strong desire my wife and child feel to see and love -the relative that I have found."  Mr. Amory arose, and Mr. Elliott following him into the hall, left Emma and Henry by themselves. After expressing their surprise, and the varied feel- ings the foregoing conversation had awakened in their minds, Henry spoke as if giving utterance to a thought . "How just is God, Emma; the poor old man we visited, who died in his wretched hut upon a bed ot straw, alone and forsaken, so great had been his errors and crimes, and the man of wealth in his costly  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7224-00000085"/> 164       ELMWOOD, -- OR, home, who also was guilty all his life; both passed away abandoned by human sympathy." ' It was even so, Henry. This punishment was the effect of their disobedience to -God'-s eternal -laws of right; and so it must ever be, to continue the har- mony of those immutable decrees; yet the wisdom and kindness of our Father even here exercised its power in both instances, throwing a veil of insensi- bility over each sad heart at the last, in this manner rendering the poor objects in a measure unconscious of their utter desolation." "4 Mr. Amory's story has made me sad, Emma. I must go now to Mathilde to say good bye, but will not mention this subject until you have prepared her for it. In about two hours I must leave." "Suppose I go first, then, and inform the dear girl of the change in her prospects."   HELEN AND EMMA.      165 CHAPTER     XXVII. THERE stood at the half open window of a chateau not many miles distant from the -city of Paris, a young girl, with wild roses wreathed in her dark brown hair. She looked out listlessly upon a lovely fountain, whose jets threw the water over two little marble cherubs into an artificial lake beneath. This was a pretty device; beautiful flowers also gave forth their varied fragrance, and the whole scene, including the young girl, was an extremely graceful one to the eye. Suddenly the sound of carriage wheels caused the young lady to withdraw. Presently up the avenue a very elegant equipage, with rich emblazonments adorning its exterior, came slowly and solemnly. From it, as it reached the house, alighted with the assistance of servants, an infirm man, whose apparel bespoke his high rank. This was the Lord de Latinee, brother-in-law to the young girl's mother, who, a widow, resided here with her only child. This lady was but thirty-nine years of age, and scarcely looked twenty-five. She was an American by birth, and had been married by her pa- rents when very youthful in life. She lived but three years with her husband, who was a wealthy gentle- man, many years her senior.  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7224-00000086"/> 166       ILtMWOOD,-- OR, "Has my son been here to-day?" said Lord de Latinee, after greeting his beautiful relative, Madame Amina D'Arblay. "Do not deceive me, Amina. The boy is a scapegrace, and deserves to be disin- herited; but, alas! he is all I have left." "Indeed, I have not seen him, my lord, neither know I of his whereabouts." "Where is Marie? She may know more. Pray send for her, Amina, that I may ask her myself con- cerning him." Marie came into the apartment, all unconscious of the question she was to answer. When she withdrew from the window at the sound of the carriage, she anticipated another, rather than the present visitor. "Marie, my child, hav you seen my son Charles to-day?"' - So unexpectedly did this come upon Marie, she blushed deeply. How glad was she that she could, with truth, reply in the negative. "Do you know where he is, Marie?" "1 have no idea, my lord." Allow me, then, to ring for my carriage, Amina. I must look elsewhere. It is necessary that I see him to-day. His debts are enormous, and there must be an end to his dissipation. Only three months and he will be of age. He must reform, or I shall leave him to his own resources." "Are you sure, my lord, that he is what you repre- sent him to be?" "Sure! Look here, Amina, see these bills for all sorts of articles, sent by tradesmen to me, after the very liberal yearly allowance I bestow upon him. It   HELEN AND BMMA.      167 is ungrateful, I will bear no more. Do not admit him here, Amina; I feared Marie's attractions might have led him hither." Lord de Latinee had not been gone an hour before in the little arbor by the fountain, sat Marie D'Arblay with a young lover kneeling at her feet. "No, Charles, it cannot be," said Marie, " my mother knows not you are here, or that you have been here for the past month. It would distress her much were she to meet you now; she has gone to visit a neighbor and will soon return. You must be speedy in what you have to say, for I would not wil- lingly give her pain." "Well, promise, Marie, not to love another." ' I cannot give you any promise, Charles." "Marie! you know how madly I love you; oh, listen to me, I beseech, Marie!" "It can never be, Charles; and I only came this once to meet you, to tell you my firm resolve. Go to your aged parent, I entreat you, be the comfort of his declining years; you are the nearest, dearest tie that binds him in the relationship of life. Remember your departed mother, Charles! She left you as a priceless treasure to your father, thinking you would doubly exert yourself to be all a fond parent could wish. You dishonor her sacred memory by proving yourself so unworthy your mission in life. Reflect, Charles, and if you really love, let that pure sentiment lead you to reform." "May I hope then, Marie?" "Urge me no more. Do not, I ask of you, sol- emnly, do not entice your American friend, Mr. Os-  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7224-00000087"/> 168       ELMWOOD, - OR, born, to the billiard table again. It is cruel of you, Charles." "Ay, I have a rival, then, that accounts for my cold treatment."- "Charles de Latinee! Do you dare insult your cousin? Is not Mr. Osborn a married man.? But I forgive and pity you. It is the dispirited looks of his beautiful young wife that disturbs my mind, and I fear all is not right. Count Tortenay, whom all the Parisian world know is a desperate roue, is, I hear, very much infatuated with her." "You take great interest in these Americans, methinks, Marie. I remember now, you became acquainted with Osborn when he was in Paris a few years since."' "Accidentally; he was placed in embarrassing circumstances, owing to the thoughtlessness of his youth, my mother said, and my uncle, mother's only brother, extricated him from them; Mr. Osborn hav- ing had a letter of introduction to him, from his im- mediate relatives in America. Uncle was visiting us at the time, and in that way mother and myself be- came acquainted with him. He entreated the diffi- culty he was in might be kept secret, knowing it would much distress his friends at home; promising, ere long, to return with interest the favor my uncle bestowed upoA him. You must not mention this, Charles; remember, I trust in your honor. It was a gambling debt, and I fear the -early love acquired for play will still farther fascinate him, if he is exposed to its temptations." 4 I will keep the secret for your sake, Marie; why .   HELEN AND EMMA.      169 did you not mention it before? He has played and staked high. That villain, Couht Tortenay, has be- come so enamored of Osborn's wife, he lures him on and three nights the past week he has not sought his hotel until daybreak, when his maddened condition made him almost brutal." "What a horrid picture, Charles, you place before my mind's eye. Look on it, yourself; can you, in imagination, behold it without a shudder. His poor young wife! How I pity her! What misery she must endure. Expose the Count to him without delay." "Would you have me expose myself to the deadly shot of that odious man? For to tell you the truth, it was him that first led me to the billiard hall, where the delusive appearance of all that could unite com- fort and ease with seductive elegance, was held out as a snare to the unwary. It has fascinated many a youthful heart, whose warm and generous emotions would have at once revolted from darker haunts of vice." "It is this attractive drapery thrown over crime, disguising its hideousness, that makes it so much to be dreaded .in the present era," said a gentle- voice behind the arbor. Madame D'Arblay had returned.  The subject on which the young persons had been engaged, had be- come so interesting they had not heard the light step coming toward them. "My aunt!"          ' "Charles! I overheard your last remark, and can well imagine your -theme.

He is distracted concern- ing you. It may be that he may be taken suddenly away from you; and remorse must, as a necessity, pursue the guilty child through life. It is a fearful thing to gnaw the tender heart-strings of a beloved parent with unceasing neglect and ingratitude. Charles, you are young; throw off this wretched, unhappy life. Become a man at once; acknowledge your errors freely, and resolve from this moment to cast the dice and the wine-cup into endless oblivion. I see, my dear boy, the good spirit awakening in your eyes; resist it not, but promise its mandate shall be obeyed.'" "Oh! Cousin, listen to mother; her advice will give you more comfort, than all the false glitter you have as yet imagined to be happiness." : Will my cousin Marie aid me to reform?' ': Most willingly," replied Madame D'Arblay. "Only do so in earnest, and you, my dear Charles, will ever be a welcome guest in our home, wherever that home may be." i( Marie! it shall be; and this very night shall not pass over my head without my father shall know and feel he has once more a son, and a grateful child in Charles de Latinee. I must now leave, I am anx- ious to commence my work immediately." '(Be not too ardent, Charles, but be firm," said Madame D'Arblay. "It is more difficult to retrace your wanderings than to follow a guide, well ap- pointed in his profession of evil example. You will have much to encounter. But 'lead us not into   HELiN ANtD 1MA A71 temptation,' let that be your true aspiration, and you will find it will eventually overcome all obstacles in the way." "And Charles," said Marie, "if you only could, without exposing yourself to injury, apprise Mr. Os- born of his danger; yet do not, on any account, risk yourself in the power of Count Tortenay. Promise me that; other means may be found." Surprised at her own warmth, in her last remark, she bade her cousin good bye, and with a "s God speed thee to the right," from her mother, and a lin- gering gaze from Charles to Marie, the young man departed. "My child, my Marie! how came your cousin here?" asked Madame D'Arblay. "He came to renew his suit, mother, and I had the moral courage to be firm. Oh! it was a task, but I never exposed the trial it cost me. And now, he may be saved. He m'ust be. I saw good emotions working in his countenance, when I pitied poor MAr. Osborn's wife; for, mother, he is again led away by that wicked Count."    - "I am glad, Marie, you were so true both to your- self and your cousin. Had you given him the boon he has so often, earnestly desired, of your affection, he would not have felt, perhaps, that he was unwor- thy the prize. But now we have, at least, awakened him to himself, and his own condition, and God grant his sincere reformation. But you surprise me concerning Osborn. My brother, you know, is absent, or I would urge him to speak to the young man.

I think, dear, I will send Mr. Osborn my card, and invite him to bring his,wife to our chateau, or if he wishes, we will call ourselves at his hotel." "' I should be delighted to become acquainted with Mrs. Osborn, mother. I met her at the Fancy Ball, but she did not take off her mask, and I was not in- troduced; though her husband discovered me by my voice, and conversed with me several times during the evening, and, as I told you, mother, was very polite to me. Count Tortenay was with Mrs. Osborn. He is very handsome and fascinating. I do hope he will not, by any artifice, win her respect or regard. Please write to-day, mother; it seems as if we might protect her from danger, if we only knew her personally." ' I presume were it not for the secret in our posses- sion, Mr. Osborn would have been glad to have had his wife receive our attentions. I will satisfy him on that point. I feel interested in them as Americans, and my early education in that country has left opin- ions and feelings, never to be satisfied with a show of morality without its vital truthfulness."

"I must say that I agree with you, Mathilde, and feel I should do the same placed in like position." "I must wholly refuse this property - I cannot, in- deed, I could not receive one penny of it. My beau- tiful mother would feel me unworthy of her love, were I to revel in the wealth of my parents' enemy, even to their death. They may have forgiven hims as I have tried to; but this bequest of his, made through remorse, I must never receive. If he has no relative, let my uncle devote it to the purposes of charity, for it may do good, as an agent, in the hands of the benevo- lent. I would -have been glad to have felt a sense of independence as regards property, had it been that I could have done so in justice to myself; then I should have ceased to be a burden to my friends, and could have remunerated others for the services I require." "Do not speak of being a burden, dear sister.

"Were I not in such an unfortunate condition of body, dear Emma, I would like much to visit my rel- atives. I already love them, for my mother's sake. It is so much trouble to others for me to journey, that I hesitate, and I still adhere to my desire of wish- ing, by what little talent I can command, to in a measure support myself. I have already a large box of useful and ornamental articles, made since I have been with you, and I would like to find a sale for them. I have avoided speaking on the subject, be- cause Mr. Elliott forbade my doing anything of the kind. But I so wish to do some good, and be of some use in this wide world of,ours." "You are daily teaching others, my sister, in the patient manner in which you endure your depriva- tions. One good example, constant in its exercise, does more real good to us faulty beings, than stores of book lore on the same subject without its personi- fication. - So, sister, pray be satisfied that your mis- sion here is to teach us the sweet meekness of patience and submission." "Why did you not tell me yesterday concerning Mr. Amory, Emma?" "I saw you were agitated, and Henry was coming to say good bye." How thoughtful in you, Emma, I can bear it better to-day, and hope to be perfectly prepared to meet Mr. Amory on his return. I knew my mother had relatives in Massachusetts, but I had forgotten the name, as I was so young at the time, I left my home."  HELEN AND EMMA.      175 "Henry comes back Saturday, Mathilde; I am so anxious to hear his opinion concerning your de- cision." "I have no doubt of it, Emma; should he, however, disagree, I am resolved to be firm." "Mr. Amory comes on Monday, shall he take away our little sister? No, I cannot part from you, Mathilde." "Oh, could you but go, also. I think it would be wrong not to return their kind desire of becoming acquainted; especially, as I am a cripple, and so unpleasant to the eye." "Do not draw a compliment from me, for you know I am principled against flattery. But, sister, the angel is often in the face, when it walketh not in the form. The soul speaks from the eye, and never spoke more lovingly and pure than it now beams from those orbs of my beloved Mathilde." "I hardly know you in this guise, dear Emma, though now and then I have noticed the rainbows of Fancy overhanging your wisdom. I am so happy that you think me loveable, so very happy, that I am not 'a disgusting object,' 'as those persons called me when in that wretched abode from which you rescued me."

SATURDAY came, and that day brought both Henry and Mr. Amory to Elmwood.  The latter had fin- ished his business, and hoped by passing the Sabbath with Mr. Elliott to be able to leave for his own home the first of the week. Mr. Amory had despatched intelligence to his fam- ily of his success, and the present happy condition of the young girl. At Mathilde's request, Emma made known to the gentleman her decision regarding the property. Henry looked pleased, Mr. Elliott thoughtful, and Mr. Amory surprised. "She is right," said Henry, " she is a noble girl.'" "am almost inclined to your opinion, my boy," said Mr. Elliott, slowly. "I am altogether unprepared for any such delicacy, my friends," interrupted Mr. Amory. "Mingling so much in the grasping world of every-day memory, I cannot comprehend this casting away, as it were nought, the thousand realities in the form of dollars, and all for a chimerical delusion in the child's brain. Surely the money cannot harm her. The man is dead, and her parents would be rejoiced, to know she had so much property at her command."   HELEN AND EMMA       1" "I think, though, excuse me, sir, in my disagreement, but your ideas differ so much from mine," said Hen- ry. "I think Mathilde richer, with this decision in her mind, more truly independent than she would be, with all the wealth she could receive in like manner as that now offered her. She would constantly be reminded of the destroyer of her parents' happiness on the earth; of their trials, and her own sorrows-- and, above all, feel she was indebted to that wicked man for her luxuries and comforts. No, no! it could not be. I honor her more than ever." "I see it clearly now," said Mr. Elliott, " my pru- dence made me cautious, dear children, but your young, generous emotions kept side by side with your judgment." "What, then, is to be done with the property?" asked Mr. Amory. "The law places it in Mathilde's hands in less than a year from this time; until then, I have care of the concern." "Here is Mathilde, I hear her chair in the hall," said Emma. Henry rose; Mathilde wheeled herself into the little circle, and recived Mr. Amory with a quiet dignity that really surprised them all. It seemed as if she had grown older by the firmness she determined to manifest in this affair. "Miss Elliott has obeyed your request, and says, my dear young friend, that you are irrevocable in this matter."  "I am, sir. The remembrance of my parents' wrongs seals the compact my own judgment wrote upon my mind."  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7224-00000092"/> 178      ELMWOOD, - OR, '"What is to be done, then?" again asked Mr. Amory. "How shall I act?" "Might I suggest," said Mathilde, I would beg you, sir, and my kind friend, Mr. Elliott, to jointly take charge of, and distribute this wealth as you feel it would benefit the greatest number; thereby, more effectually removing the remorse of the wretched man, than by bestowing it on me alone. This is a Roman Catholic idea, that we make our guilt a mat- ter of barter and trade, and pay up our consciences; endeavoring to still their unsatisfied yearnings. But it was remorse that made Mr. Ponsby do this act; and let us make the most for him, of all that he has left in our care." "What is your decision about returning with me? I have sufficient means of my own, without the least need of disturbing this property on your account, my dear child, to have you always share our home. That is my wife and child's earnest desire." "I would like to go much, sir," answered Mathilde, "yet, I am an incumbrance' in travelling; and one more thing, I should wish to be employed in some useful manner in your family. I can use the needle in various ways. My health ls now so good, and I am so much improved by these ever-to-be remembered friends, that I am really able to do something for my own support."' "We will speak of that another time," interrupted Mr. Elliott. "Now, my good sir," said Mr. Amory, "I have a boon to ask myself. Will you not allow your daugh- ter Emma to accompany us, for a few months. She   HELEN AND EMMA.      179 looks delicate, and a change might be of great benefit to her, as the cold winter of the North is coming on, even now threatening us with its approach.

"Would you like to go, Emma?" asked Mr. Elliott, while Henry eagerly awaited her reply. 4 I do not- think you can spare me, my dear sir, I am your housekeeper, you remember." "Oh! In those matters Mrs. Trent could do very well, but your companionship would be a: great loss to me; still, I think you had better accept the kind offer. You could be of so much use to Mathilde in travelling, and relieve Mr. Amory of his care. Henry will come home every Saturday; the anticipation of seeing him will keep me in tune, I lSpe." "4 Thank you, dear father," said, Henry, yet we shall have to tax all our powers to forget the stars of our little sphere." "Forget us?" asked Mathilde; " nay, Henry, you cannot mean that." "How else should we bear our loss?" said Mr. Elliott. Emma did not speak, but she looked at Henry, and was satisfied that it was easier to talk, in some cases, than to act.  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7224-00000093"/> 180       ELMWOOD,- OR, CHAPTER XXX. ONE would be apt to say in France, truly this is the birth-place of taste; for certain it is, they there have the prettiest fancies imaginable in ornamenting their homes. This came to my mind seeing the ex- quisite arrangement of a room, with its delicately cur- tained windows and its grouping of statuettes; the studied carelessness of its furniture as regarded posi- tion, giving the apartment the appearance of high- bred ease; so far removed from that formality of exactness that almost chills the thoughts and feelings of one introduced into a room of the latter descrip- tion. The. pretty apartment, mentioned above, was at present occupied by a lady and her husband. "George," said the lady, "I pray you give heed to my anxiety." "You are a foolish child, Helen, a mere infant in the ways of the world." "But tell me about her. Who is she?" "What can that be to you? I never knew you so anxious before to become acquainted with a hand- some woman. She may prove a rival to you. What then?  "Be serious, I beg of you, Mr. Osborn.".   HlELEN AND EMMA.      181 "' Mr. Osborn!' Hem! that is something like; you are progressing, a year in Paris would quite change my pretty wife." "Do not trifle, George; I must know the cause of your absence so many nights in a week from your. hotel. I cannot stay here longer. I wish to return home, to my parents I mean." "Are you in earnest, Helen? Before you have seen Italy? Is it my absence at night, then, that has caused you to bring that young lady so vividly to my mind? Let me sacredly assure you, she is as in- nocent as yourself of any participation in that matter. Indeed, I have not seen her since the night of the Fancy Ball." "Are you sincere?" "Solemnly so." "What, then, detains you?" , Business of importance." "But why not transact it by day?" "A private affair. I cannot choose my own hours." "How you. relieve my mind, George; I never was neglected before, and it came so unkindly to me." "Did you feel so much, my beautiful wife? For- give me, I pray you. I hope soon to finish the mat- ter entirely. After I receive letters from my relatives, I shall leave for Italy, dearest." "How glad I am. I feel so happy now, that I could even bear with patience Count Tortenay's foolish sayings. He comes for me to-day to take a drive r]in his superb turn-out.

"You do seem very strange, George; it must be want of Test." "I shall be at home early to-night, and hope to feel better in a few days." A knock at the door--it was opened, and a porter handed the silver salver, with a letter upon it for Mr. Osborn. "Who is it from, George?" "Only a friend." "It is a lady's writing," said Helen, who, seated by his side, could distinctly see the delicately formed letters. "How jealous you are this morning. Did you not know confidence is the root of true love? You seem to have quarrelled with that agent, and gone over to its enemy."                 l "I am your wife, George; perhaps I am silly; why should I care? Count Tortenay says, ' I could com- mand a retinue of admirers by one of my winning smiles. That I have only to express by my looks, a wish to him, and it shall be gratified.'" "Indeed!' Mrs. Osborn, and you listened to such language. -An American wife. I am astonished!" "Did you not urge me, George, to receive his kind attentions, as he was an intimate friend of yours?" "Certainly, certainly,-- but,- ah!- I mean, as   HELEN AND EMMA. .     183 you seemed jealous of the little unknown lady, I simply returned the compliment, and was becoming absolutely jealous of the Count. Ha! ha! Now we are even." " The man's a villain to use such language to my wife,?' said Osborn to himself. , I am fearfully in his power. I almost tremble for Helen." 4"Are you reading your letter again, George; you seem to be muttering over something." "Well, Helen, I am going to be a remarkably gen- erous man and gratify a woman's curiosity. The unknown lady and her Mamma are desirous of mak- ing the acquaintance of Mrs. Helen Osborn, and will call to-day, should the said lady be at liberty to receive them." "Indeed!" replied Helen, "but my engagement with the Count-I must postpone their kind visit until another day." "Oh! incomprehensible! Woman and mystery ought to be synonymes. All excitement a short time since to know, even the name, of the young lady, and now putting off an interview with her until to-mor- row."

"Madame and Mademoiselle D' Arblay. I hope you will find their acquaintance very pleasing, Mrs. Os- born - Helen - I would say. They may call early, before the Count's arrival; and by the way, Helen, I would not make any future engagement with that gentleman, as other engagements may interfere."  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7224-00000095"/> 184       ELMWOOD, -- OR, "Well, my dear husband,- if women are myths, I am sure you have given proof this morning, that the lords of creation share the same chaotic mantle; for you are perfectly, unintelligible to me. When did I make any appointment with Count Tortenay? Have I not submissively followed your desires, even when they were painful to me, and now I have began to think I might enjoy them in a degree, (for truly, George, he is a very handsome, fascinating person,) you seem disposed to put an end to them entirely.", "Fascinating! Truly, Mrs. Osborn, Paris performs wonders! You are improving." "C I am glad you think so. I was always fond of admiration, and if you, who are so fastidious, think me improved, I must be so in reality." "A lady's carriage, sir," said the porter. "Madame and Mademoiselle D'Arblay." "Admit them, Philip.' "You will now have an opportunity, Helen, of seeing my lovely, and yes, -very fascinating young friend. If we could receive them, I was not to send an answer, as they are visiting in the city to-day; so they have taken it for granted, and seem determined making your acquaintance, at least." "Madame D'Arblay and daughter," said Philip, ushering in the ladies. "We have come," said Madame D'Arblay, after the ceremony of introduction was over, " to ask you, Mr. Osborn, to leave your hotel and pass a few days at our ahateau, Glensarde. Do waive all useless etiquette; persons become so much better acquainted a little apart from city life and its conventionalities. rt   r   HELEN AND EMMA.       185 I wish much to know and love your fair wife.'

'"Thank you, dear Madame," said Helen, "it is indeed pleasant to meet with such warm friends. Your daughter reminds me much of an intimate ac- quaintance at home. Does she not resemble Emma Elliott, George?" "What, your beautiful violet friend, as you term her? I would rather compare Mademoiselle D'Arblay to the fairest and sweetest of flowers, the unsurpassed "ily of the Valley.'" Mademoiselle D'Arblay blushed, and bent her graceful head, yet she did not seem pleased. She at once observed an expression of unquiet on Helen's face, and feared the marked compliment of the hus- band might render her distasteful to the wife. There- -fore, she went directly to Helen, taking her hand in such an irresistibly affectionate manner, as not to be repulsed, saying- '"My dear Mrs. Osborn, do permit us the favor of your acquaintance. Your husband came often to see my uncle on business when he visited France before, and we thus became acquainted with him. Do not refuse us the pleasure." Helen was overcome with this sincere kindness, and : readily agreed to go the next day to Glensarde. "We return to-night," said Madame D'Arblay, "will you not accompany us?" "Yes, Helen, do go," said her husband, " our friends are so kind, and I will come out to-morrow." 16*         .              .  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7224-00000096"/> 186       E LMWOOD, - OR, "You forget, (eorge, my engagement," said Helen. "Leave that to me," he replied. "Count Tortenay's carriage at the door," said Philip, and almost as soon, appeared the gentleman himself, exquisite in apparel and manner. The Count looked a little suprised to see the in- mates of the apartment, but with his usual ease, be- trayed little concern. Saluting the strangers, whom he had often met in high-bred circles, he addressed Osborn in a bold manner, saying- "At your request, my fine fellow, I come as escort to Mrs. Osborn this lovely day. My equipage awaits her commands." "And we," said Madame D'Arblay, advancing, 'must deprive Count Tortenay of the pleasure, for we are resolved to take Mrs. Osborn by storm to our chateau." "Indeed!?" said the Count, looking significantly at -Helen's husband. "I was not aware until this morn- ing, Mrs. Osborn had the extreme pleasure of Mad- ame D'Arblay's acquaintance, or that of her very fair daughter. But I assure you, I cannot resign my lovely charge so easily. You must know, my friends," (he continued, with some bitterness in his tone,) "Osborn has business to attend to in Paris, and so he appointed me general attendant for his charming wife. I have found the office so delightful I cannot, at once, relinquish my title to another. Mrs. Osborn agreed, yesterday, to visit some noted places, and will, I know, fulfil her promise." The Count looked sternly at Osborn as he made the last remark. George could hardly suppress his anguish at find-   HELEN AND EMMA.       187 ing himself so much in the Count's power. He owed him an immense sum of money, and how he was to cancel the debt he knew not. Would luck ever be his again? He would try once more that night, and if he lost, he would then give- up forever. But the debt.- At all events, Helen would be safe, could she be placed with female friends like the D'Arblay's. She would not be under the influence of the specious say- ings of the " fascinating handsome" man. Rapidly through his mind run these thoughts, and he seemed to come to a conclusion through them. "My dear ladies," said Osborn, "I fear Helen must keep her promise to our friend the Count, for to-day. To-morrow I will accompany her to -Glensarde." "What says the fair lady herself?" asked the Count, bowing obsequiously to Helen. "That she generally acquiesces with her husband's wishes." The Count looked the very least triumphant, but said, addressing Madame and Mademoiselle- "Your pardon, ladies! Were it a less favor than the society of one so unparalleled in loveliness as -Mrs. Osborn, I would be more generous. You are so soon to enjoy that in earnest, you will, I feel confident, pardon my presumption." Madame D'Arblay turned coldly, in reply, to Mr. Osborn, saying-- "I hope Mr. Osborn will perform his .promise as faithfully to-morrow." She then bade Helen an affectionate farewell, whis- pering gently in her ear- "Beware that man!  George handed the ladies to their carriage, and did not appear again.  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7224-00000097"/> 188 "     ELMWOOD, - OR, Shortly after, Count Tortenay performed the same office for Mrs. Osborn, escorting her to his carriage, where sat a maiden aunt, who was deaf, and one might say almost blind; she always accompanied them when they drove out. It was the express desire of Helen to her husband, when first asked to receive the Count as her chaperon, that some elderly female should accompany them. The Count made a selec- tion agreeable to himself, and his choice, otherwise than having the appearance human, might as well have been a statue for all the good or ill her com- pany offered. It surely was no obstacle to the undis- guised flattery of the Count, or to the blushes of the lady. There was one unseen, who witnessed the hilarity of manner and the tender attentions bestowed, in as- sisting Mrs. Osborn into the carriage. It was her husband! He had crept cautiously to another apart- ment, and watched his own wife drive away with his tempter, his now hated enemy. He had destroyed his own moral courage; he was a slave and a base coward. Why did he not throw off this thraldom? Because the chains of pride bound him in their gall- ing fetters, and he dared not burst them asunder. One more trial, and then he would brave all, every- thing, for peace of mind again. Not that he doubted Helen - never a moment. But she was very beaUi- tiful and vain; fond, too fond of flattery. Dress and style she worshipped. This had been the maternal education. Helen was also thoughtless and proud. The Count had tried every inducement that wealth and rank could command to please her fancy. He   HELEN AND EMMA.       189 had never trespassed on any ground of personal free- dom; he knew too well his position to do that.

MRS. AMORY was delighted to receive her guests. Her young daughter felt as if a new era had dawned upon her in the coming of her discovered relative and friend. The resemblance was striking between the cousins in the countenance, but the forri so active of the younger one, made a painful contrast to the crippled, powers of the other. Mrs. Amory had learned from her husband the de- cision of Mathilde regarding the fortune left her. Mr. Amory consulted with Mr. Ponsby's lawyer in New Orleans. He said, the mortgage on Mr. D'Allenby's estates was only bought up by Mr. Ponsby; were that mortgage paid for, the planta- tion would still belong to Miss D'Allenby. That it was now leased to a man whose lease expired in a month's time. Mr. Amory told his wife if Mathilde did not change her mind, he should repurchase the mortgage with- out disturbing the eighty thousand dollars, already devoted by her to charitable purposes. The estate would then fairly belong to Mathilde, and her most fastidious ideas could not lead her to refuse it under the circumstances.   HELEN AND EMMA.       191 He sent for Mathilde a few days after his return from New Orleans, and tola her what he had done. That Mr. Elliott had insisted upon his taking in charge a few thousand dollars for her own personal requirements, and investing them safely for her best interest. That to Mr. Elliott's fund he had added a little gift of his own, and the home of her youth was in every respect honorably her own. Mathilde was so overcome by this kindness and the varied emotions it awoke in her mind, of the sweet recollections of her earliest days, the beautiful mother, the good old slaves, and her favorite Jennifer, that tears spoke fast before she found her voice to answer. And even then she was silent, after she once essayed to speak. '"How can I thank you enough, Mr. Amory? and him, also, dear excellent man, whose adopted daugh- ter has been the angel of love and restoration to my bodily and mental health. But -oh! do not deem me obstinate, do not think me unmindful of all your disinterested kindness, when I ask you how far does my father's property exceed the mortgage?" "I know not, exactly. It only lies twenty-two miles from us, farther South. We shall all of us go with you to visit it when Mr. Alvir's time has ex- pired; He hires the slaves also. They are counted in with the house and land." "Poor creatures!" interrupted Mathilde, "' they are denied the best gift of God, free agency." "But," continued Mr. Amory, without giving heed to her piteous ejaculations, "Mr. Judkins, the New Orleans attorney of Mr. Ponsby, said the soil is in  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7224-00000099"/> ELMWOOD --OR, fine condition, the house and out-buildings firm, the garden well cultivated, and the slaves healthy So I think a pretty property might be made of it, barring the mortgage, especially for one young lady, and that one so thoughtful and prudent as my little cousin." "Can you assure me what you last said was true, Mr. Amory?" "I have scarcely a doubt; but why this anxiety, when I tell you the incumbrance of the mortgage is removed and the property free." "Then, my dear sir, I shall, when I come of age, sell the plantation, free the slaves, and repay the amount of the mortgage money to my very generous benefactors. I shall be happy then if a small pittance is left for- myself, and should feel far more wealthy, than with the weighty burden of indebtedness to my friends on my heart. Their kindness must ever be a debt I can nevercancel, and that is all I am able to bear." "Mathilde D'Allenby, you are the most extraordi- nary girl I know," said Mr. Amory, more surprised than ever. "Where were you educated? Stop, for- give me; I am too hasty." "No, sir. Trial and misfortune led me to reflect; they were my teachers, and I had need of them, for I am naturally wild and thoughtless. You will be sur- prised, sir, at my excessive love of fun when you know me better. I have also been benefited greatly by my residence in Mr. Elliott's beautiful home of harmony and love." "But, Mathilde, I counted your slaves in with the rest of the property. Were you to free them, it would be a dead loss to you."   "Let it be so, if it be a live gain to them." "What would you do with them after they were free?" I would grant them their wishes, in as far as I could, for my dear parents' sake." "Dear me," thought Mr. Amory, " if the world at large had such an antipathy to coin as this young girl has, what a fall there would be in bank stock. It is below par with her, it would seem; in all cases." "Well, my child," said Mr. Amory, aloud, c we have had business enough for one morning, and you have awakened some new ideas in my mind. I do not know but they will tangle up all those I had there. before; so you must give me time for reflection." "How sorry I am to try you so much-and your own business cares were sufficient fqr you before sir," said Mathilde. "No, I am at leisure for a few weeks, and I hope ere long to make things right and pleasant to all par- ties concerned." Emma Elliott had already won a place in the affec- tionate heart of Mrs. Amory. She had been sitting conversing with her during Mathilde's absence, and had imparted to that lady all she knew concern- ing her cousin's history. Plans were formed for various kinds of amusement in which Mathilde could participate. Leaving them so apparently happy, we will look back on our Mas- sachusetts friends, and see how they succeed in forgetting old acquaintances. 17  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7224-00000100"/> ELMWOOD,  OR, CHAPTER    XXXII.

HELEN AND EMMA.       197 CHAPTER XXXIII. IN the Chateau Glensarde, we now find our friend Helen quite at home. The ladies are very kind. She has already been there a week. Marie's uncle is daily expected. Letters have not arrived from America, as yet, for Mr. Osborn. George accompanied his wife to Glensarde, but seemed much perturbed, and said immediate engage- ments recalled him, at once, to Paris. It seemed great relief to him to know Helen was under the care of so sensible a person as Madame D'Arblay. Madame D'Arblay had promised not to betray his former secret, but she intimated to Mr. Osborn that she wished to have a private interview with him. For reasons of his own, he decided to avoid her doing so at present. Helen and Marie had a tete-a-tete in the pretty arbor by the fountain, over which trellised flowers gave forth their chaste perfume, surrounding these fair beings in their intercourse with the seeming fra- grance of affection. "But, Marie! how could you refuse him, when you loved him so devotedly?" asked Helen. "Duty. Positive duty to him and myself. We should each of us have been wretched had I com- plied." 17r         *  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7224-00000102"/> 198       ELMWOOD,-- OR I He is so handsome, so wealthy; you could have had all your heart could wish."

"He could not have expected anything but a firm refusal, from my former treatment of him." -' What was the matter? I saw no fault in him, and I have met him several times. Count Tortenay introduced him to me; I did not exactly understand his remark afterward. ' A mere birdling,' said he, (not uncaged yet; has the world's book to study; he is only just passed the title page, and in the introduc- * tory chapter.' Then he laughed, and I laughed also, why, I know not, for I did not receive his jest, I suppose. But somehow, the Count makes a person appear- to sympathize with him. I cannot account for his power." "Dear Mrs. Osborn, you alarm me!" said Marie. "Me! I alarm you, what have I said?" "I beg your pardon, do excuse me, but our conver- sation agitated me." "From its nature it must excite you. Pray answer the question I asked before. What is the failing of Lord de Latinee's son?" "Those who know the world better than ourselves, those who have all-its pages by heart, can answer that question the most correctly.

Then he began to lose, and played again, hoping to retrieve; he again lost, and again played, until his debts would have made him entirely reckless, had not his father's generosity enabled him to pay the interest upon them. Another victim was found by the same false friend that had patronized him; and one case generally exemplifies all. First gaining fast; then losing; next .recklessness, folly, despair, and oftentimes suicide!" al How dreadful! Marie, where did you learn so much of such a kind of life, and you so young?" "Living in Paris in winter, and in its environs the rest of the year; hearing as I must hear, and seeing as I must see, can I remain in ignorance? Besides, did not Charles tell me the entire truth?" "And did you not then accept hime and forgive all, Marie?" "His repentance was only in words. He has nat- urally a pure and noble heart, and it was an emotion I awoke there by alluding to a lovely young wife,' whose husband was placed in like position with him- self; and her deep grief and anxiety, it was that which at once touched the true nature within him, and he promised never to enter one of those conta- gious dens of immorality again. I think he will be firm. His father loves him distractedly; having lost a wife and four children. Charles is all he has left,- he was the youngest, and ever the pet."

"Have you not heard from Charles?" a Mamma had a letter from his father, at which she seemed much rejoiced." "Did you not read it? I should have gone dis- tracted not to have devoured the contents at once." "Mother did not propose to show it to me; I waited until she thought it for the best to do so." "You are indeed a second Emma Elliott; I did not think the whole world could produce another. ]But now I have a wee bit of a secret to tell you, Marie. Count Tortenay is coming for me to drive over to Paris, and he is to bring me the most exquisite flow- ers, for I chanced to say I loved flowers exceedingly. He said his conservatory was full of the rarest plants, and the very handsomest should be cut for my acceptance." "( Where do you suppose Mr. Osborn is?" asked Marie, wishing to turn the conversation. She felt extremely anxious about her new friend, but Mrs. Osborn being her mother's guest, and older than her- self, she thought it would be better to communicate to her parent, and leave her to warn Helen of her danger.   HELEN AND IPMMA.      201 CH-APTE R    XXXIV. "MATHLDE is overcome, dear Julia, do not be alarmed, the associations of her early memory are now again mentally personified, and she is, as it were, once more a child. She will command herself in a few moments; let us leave her alone, and go out on the piazza," said Emma. "It would be better, to do so," whispered Mrs. Amory to her daughter. The whole family were now at the D'Allenby plan- tation. Mr. Amory had been there a week before, and had prepared all things for the reception of the lawful mistress. Jennifer, Mathilde's own slave, was still living, though much older in appearance than the years that had passed would seem to justify. Old Sambo was most too old for service; but Dinah, Chloe and Thisbe, who were children when Mathilde went away, were now strong girls, Peter and Tillo also, were stout, active men, in the prime of life. Jack was dead, and three others removed by Mr. Ponsby, no one knew whither. These poor creatures were rejoiced to know that the child of their beloved lady was -again coming to them. They alternately wept, danced and sang.  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7224-00000104"/> 202      ELMWOOD, - OR, But when Mr. Amory told them their young mistress could not walk, they moaned as if they were suffering themselves. Jennifer was now wild with joy. It was the sight of her that made Mathilde give so unresistingly vent to her emotions, she so vividly brought back the painful past. Mrs. Amory had an excellent housekeeper, and a few domestics who came from the North to live in her family. The negroes belonging to this estate were much improved since Mr. Amory had bought the place. He had them instructed in various ways, and endeavored to make them more comfortable in their condition. Mrs. Amory could leave her home with ease, sure of care being exercised over her affairs; and the fam- ily decided to remain a fortnight, until Mathilde completed her arrangements. Though it was several months before Mathilde was of age, yet Mr. Alvir's lease having expired, Mr. Amory as guardian, acted according to his ward's wishes, and permitted her to follow her own inclina- tion, thinking the sooner her affairs were settled, the better would it be for all concerned. Mathilde, one morning, called the slaves into her mother's little library, and addressed them in the kindest manner, telling them -they were all free I She was surprised at their silence. No one wished to leave her, each one wanted to remain. "I am not going to live here," said Mathilde. "I intend to sell the place, and I want to see you all taken care of properly, if I can."   HELEN AND EMMA.       203 "Oh Missus, dear young Missus, old Sambo too old-; let him die with young Missus!" "And me," said Jennifer, "I carried little Missus,' when a bit of a baby. I rocked-little Missus in the cradle. Oh! let me be where she may be," said the sobbing woman. "Well, Sambo and Jennifer, you shall, if I can make arrangements, remain with me." What say the others? Dinah,. Chloe, and Thisbe shall go to Massachusetts, if they like, and Miss Elliott will get them places to work, and earn money for themselves. Mr. Amory has kindly offered to take Tillo for his coachman, and Peter to work in the garden. When they have learned their duties, he will pay them good wages for their services." "And we shall be free!" they at length shouted, "and nobody hunt us down? Nobody send blood- hounds after us? Nobody beat poor niggers?" said Chloe. "Nobody tie up Tillo?"asked the young man, and snapping his fingers, he grinned with most un- mistakable joy. "Oh, Missus!" said old Sambo, "we've had a hard time since your blessed mother went away. No kind words since. The lash spoke to us, and blood an- swered for us!. Oh, hard times! I am a' most used up; but life comes into me again seeing you here." "Now I want you all to hear me, and be still," said Mathilde. "By the laws of this state you are my property, but I do not consider that I hold any right to you. Money, in my opinion, cannot purchase an immortal  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7224-00000105"/> 204      ELMWOOD, -- OR, soul; that belongs to God, and the casement of that soul is God's also. We cannot barter and dtrade with the Almighty. He made you all free agents, like me, and you are free as regards your personal liberty. Yet in one thing you are still slaves, --to the power of ignorance. You must, therefore, until you acquire that knowledge you have so long been deprived of, you must be willing to be directed by those who know right from wrong. If you do so, you will soon become happy men and women. Are you satisfied to do as I propose? It is necessary to place you in safety somewhere, to fully ensure your freedom. I shall now admit my dear friends, and in their presence destroy these papers which pretend to prove you to be my property." Mathilde did as she proposed. Mr. Amory begged her to take Jennifer as her own attendant, and let old Sambo -have a home long as he might live with them. It was amusing to see the antics of these poor creatures when they fully understood their situation, and were dismissed by Mathilde to return to their huts. They hardly knew how to behave; some cried, while others laughed. They were free as white men! That was enough. If all could not stay with little Missus, yet her-good friends would take charge of them. "' Hurrah for free niggers!" said Tillo, and a loud cry succeeded this fine exclamation. "Stand up straight, you rascal!" said Peter to himself, "you're most like a white man now; button up your coat, Mr. Peter."   HELEN AND EMMA.       205 "La! it's only a flannel jacket, Master Peter!", said Thisbe. "Well, Miss Thisbe," said Peter, " favor me with your hand, as old Master Trickey used to say to that pretty Miss Rose as was here." "What a whipping we should have if he saw us now!" said Dinah. "Oh, what a cat-o'-nine-tails!" said Chloe, laugh- ing, showing her ivory teeth to perfection. "T guessed none of us ever laughed at the catWo'- nine-tails before," replied Tillo. "Yah, niggers! how you all act," said Sambo. "Niggers! why, we'sfree!" they answered. "But you an't turned white yet!" said Jennifer, "Now go to work, you lazy fellows; an't you going to work any more for young Missus 'cause ye's free?" "Work! yes!" cried one and all. "Wal, then, she can't live on air; so let's make the hoe-cake, and fix things for tea." "Yes," said Master Tillo, " and a coachman I'm to be." "Yah! Yah! Yah!?" was the laughing chorus end- ing this ready rhyme of Tillo's. They all hastened to busy themselves with right good will, each striving to out-do the other in the amount of labor- performed; showing how powerful to do good is the acknowledg- ment of human sympathy from one being to another. Mathilde had a fine offer for her plantation from a New Orleans merchant who had acquired great wealth, and was willing to give a handsome price for it, as it was in so good a condition. Mr. Amory had employed Mr. Ponsby's lawyer to find a purchaser. 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7224-00000106"/> 206      ELMWOOD,-- OR, After all was settled, the mortgage money refund- ed, and the slaves provided for, Mathilde D'Allenby found herself sole mistress of twenty-five thousand dollars. Mr. De Lile, the New Orleans merchant, had heard ali the particulars concerning this property from Mr, Amory, and when he saw the beautiful face of Ma- thilde, and the maimed condition of her body, he gave more for the estate than it was ever expected to have brought when furnished with the usual number of slaves. Mathilde concluded to make the South her future home. It was her native clime, and she loved the balmy breezes, for they sang songs of the early past, and she hoped happy hours might yet be hers. She, with her maid Jennifer, was to board with her cousins. She gave Sambo a small hut for his- own, and all things he could wish to render him comfortable. Tillo and Peter were also, established here, and the women were to go home in the spring, which was fast approaching, with Miss Elliott; until then, they shared the hospitality of Mr. Amory, and made them- selves very useful. One circumstance we must not forget. The even- ing before the party left the b'Allenby plantation, Tillo begged a hearing of " young Missus." He wanted to know " if they might have a jubilee and bonfire?"  -  Mathilde consented; but little did she know of what that fire was to be made. Mr. Amory went out, attracted by the blaze. Stand- ing in the shade, he saw two odd-looking figures   HELEN AND EMMA.      207 dressed up, one to resemble Mr. Ponsby, the other intended for their late Master, Mr. Trickey. "Now hand me that cat-o'-nine-tails, ye saucy nigger, Pete." "Take care, yer black Tillo! I'll try it an ye first." "Come, Pete, you lick old Ponsby 'till he comes to nothing, and I'll make up to Trickey." "Hurrah! Yah! Yah! Now put the whip, chains and lashes all into the fire, and'let's dance round. They are having their turn now." "Favor me with your hand, Miss Chloe," said Peter. "Tillo, advance with Miss Dinah, and come, join in old Sambo, with Miss Thisbe." "Yah! you silly niggers, I'se too old," said Sambo, yet he'complied. "Now three salutes, as Joe Trickey said when old dad was going away to stay, three salutes for hand- some young Missus!  Three more forfree niggers!" The scene was so wild, and passed so soon before the astonished gaze of Mr. Amory, that he scarcely had a chance of interrupting them, and when he saw how quietly they walked toward their huts, after the flames expired, he thought best to pass it by without notice. Mr. Amory was preparing his slaves for their free- dom when he first met with Mathilde, and intended soon to offer them wages, or give them permission to go where they wished.  Her argumes had hastened what he meant eventually to accomplish. Therefore he felt no trouble in bringing these emancipated ones into the midst of his own dependants. Mr. Ambry was much and truly beloved. He was  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7224-00000107"/> 208       ELMWOOD, -- OR, a good man, but his early conservatism made him slow to act in this progressive era. Nevertheless, he had commenced thinking for himself; individualizing thought, I might say, and ore long he would acknowl- X edge a right to his own opinion founded on his ed- ucated judgment. The only draw-back to Mathilde D'Allenby's per- fect happinesswas parting with Emma. She already loved her cousins, but Emma she almost worshipped. She looked to her as a superior. They promised a close correspondence, and Emma hoped many times to meet her adopted sister in her now happy Southern home. ,*   HELEN AND EMMA.      209 CH APTER     XXXV'.

Do not, I entreat you, be offended. Let me act the part of a mother in your case. I feel only affection and interest for you." "You are very kind, Madame, but if Mr. Osborn thinks me so competent to take entire charge of my- self, as to leave me without his care, I think I must be capable of judging for myself in this affair." "You do not know the value of this gift." "What matters that, Madame?" "This diamond ring is composed of first-water gems ; besides, Helen, my child, you must pardon me, it is dishonorable, if I must so speak, for you to accept this from the Count." "Dishonorable! me! Madame D'Arblay!   If my husband returns not to-night, I shAl leave for my hotel in Paris to-morrow; until then, give me per- mission to remain in my own apartment."

I pray you hear me patiently, these tears speak my sincerity. Ask yourself, why does Count Tortenay pay you these attentions? Why does he fatter you so openly? Why does he linger round your pathway, making you offers of all things but himself? and that is to be the closing scene, the finale of all this fasci- nating folly. And you an American wife, Helen!" "Marie, hasten hither, my dear," said Madame D'Arblay, opening an adjoining room. "Reach me the vinaigrette, our friend is ill, a little faint. Retire, my child, let her see no one but my self when she recovers." Helen looked vacantly round the apartment, and then full in Madame D'Arblay's face, as if all at once a sudden thought, had revivified her whole frame, which was now trembling with emotion. "It is enough, my dear Madame. You are right, - - and Helen Osborn is saved! Oh, the brink on which I stood! I thought only of the present enjoyment. What shall I do?" "Helen, Count Tortenay is a noted rove. He is a gambler, and, I might add, a villain." "And my husband placed me in his care; nay, almost commanded me to receive his attentions. It was at first witreluctance on my part that I com- plied. Then I became attracted by artful devices -to his fascinating society. I never reason. I do not like meditation, and will not, unless some matter of   HELEN AND EMMA.      2" great importance occurs, reflect. Why could my husband have acted thus? He must have been igno- rant of the Count's real character. How grateful he will be to you for saving me from committing myself by further imprudence. What am I to do? Count Tortenay comes for me at two o'clock to drive to Paris; we visited the Louvre last week, and I highly enjoyed its fine works of art. He proposed to-day to drive through the Boulevards. What can I do? And this ring? There it is, never shall it touch my hands again. But Madame D'Arblay, you cannot, no, for a moment, you cannot think Count Tortenay ever imagined he could make me a faithless wife? Say, dear Madame, assure me of that. I but just take in the full meaning of your warning. My parents, my friend Emma, what would they say to such a horrid supposition?" "( Be calm, dear Helen, the storm ie averted now, let us escape from this, for the present, into a clearer atmosphere. It is vain to search the heart of man, but One knows its mysterious wanderings. Rest now, and Marie shall come and, sit with you. I will endeavor to -think for you, and perhaps" more light may be given to guide us safely out of this unpteas- ant affair. Until then, share with my dear .Marie a mother's love." Bestowing a kiss upon the lovely woman, Madame D'Arblay went to find her brother. "Have you succeeded, Louis?" she asked, seeing him writing at his escritoire. "Ah! dear sister, I am glad you have -come. Your worst fears have not anticipated the reality.

He was not at his hotel, and it was only through the untiring exertions of Charles De Latinee that I succeeded. Charles seems to shun his former associates. You know how very fastidious Osborn is in regard to personal appearance, the very essence of dandyism affecting him at all times." "Yes, Louis, that was a fault I ever found with him. It seemed to be his chief aim to exhibit him- self. But pray proceed." "He was found at the hotel in les Champs, hur- riedly walking the chamber in extreme dishabille. His astonishment was great in beholding us, for I had persuaded Charles to accompany me to his room, and we entered unannounced. Feeling under some obligation to me, he could not receive me other than kindly, but he looked upon Charles as an intruder. After asking pardon for our liberty, I at once, without reserve, told him I had come to serve his best inter- ests; that I knew his situation, and before him were two warm friends to aid him. He looked utterly amazed. Before he could speak, I went on repeating all that Charles had told me concerning the Count, and his winning him to the gambling table, and last, the Count's intrigue with his wife. As I mentioned the latter, he clenched his fists, and the blood rushing into his face, made him appear almost a maniac. He stamped upon the ground, and swore to be revenged. We calmed him as we best could, after the first burst of passion ceased. I told him, deep was my regret, that he had again fallen into error; especially, when   HELEN AND EMMA.      213 having under his care a young and lovely wife. I pictured the dreadful effects his course might have produced. He really writhed in the wretchedness of his condition. Charles came to my aid, and told him his experience. "Osborn,' said Charles, 'I have met you repeat- edly in the "Salon des Fleurs," though I have not played but once with you, and that was a short game of ecarte, for pleasure only. Still I have seen you win, night after night, from Count Tortenay, and again lose double the sum, yes, treble, what you had'gained. Your debts must be very heavy. So were mine. Had it not been for an angel, in the form of woman, one whom I have loved from childhood, and a doting father, whose silvery locks adorn his aged head, what might I not have become? I hope I am saved! I feel new life in my firm resolution; for never! never will I play for money again so long as I live. My father has cancelled my debts, on w'hich that villain7 Count Tortenay, received interest from me; depending on the death of that dear parent for a clear payment of the sum total. He was constantly urging me to play. But I am now free again! Oh, Osborn! Is it not slavery of the worst description, to wear the bonds of self-contempt and remorse? We, young and enlight- ened, to throw -willingly around our necks the halter of humiliation; and be led abjectedly by another's will, without daring to remonstrate; and all the while, a withering, gnawing opposition feeding itself with our wrongs; yet so servilely enslaved, that we still bow and cringe, with a hideous hypocrisy that we despise.

Let me first pledge you my friendship, if you also will forever abandon this gaming for money.' "'What can I do?' interrupted Osborn, at last speaking for himself. ' I am an orphan, dependant' on an uncle and aunt for all I have. Their liberality is great, yet their wealth is small compared to Count Tortenay's. And already I owe himn more than the sum they would bestow on me for several years to come.' "' Is it possible? I asked in despair. ' What can you do?' "; Die! die like a madman, as I am!' said Osborn, distractedly pacing the apartment. 'Oh, Helen!' he continued, 'would I had not brought you to this, by my folly.' "Charles went up to Osborn, affectionately laying his arm upon his shoulder, saying, "' This is more than I can bear. You too have an angel, in- woman's form, to save you. I have seen her; she is young and beautiful.' "' And he would -have beggared me of her! Oh! villain that I am!' frantically exclaimed Osborn " Stop, and hear me further. Be seated, I entreat you, and be quiet. I may be of use to you. It was the picture of an unhappy wife, made so by her hus- band's misdeeds, that presented to my mind thoughts of one I loved, placed in like position through similar acts of mine. I felt a conviction of guilt never to be forgotten. It saved me! let it also save you.. Some- how, your debts must be paid. The Count is a dan- gerous person. You are still in his power. We must   HELEN AND EMMA.       215 be cautious. Your wife must be prudent. Let him have no sort of pretext for a quarrel; pay him, and then leave for Italy.' "'You distract me! Pay him! and not a franc left in my possession. Oh! let me die! But take care of Helen! Pray take care of her. Her parents are wealthy, and they love her; yes, love her, as few are cherished. She is her father' idol, and her mother's pride. And H-forgiveme!' arid the wretched man sobbed aloud in agony. "For a moment the room was still. Silence fell upon the great grief of self-accusation, aid the bitter- ness of its memories. After a few moments, Charles again spoke. "' Mr. Osborn, arouse yourself, and hear me still further. My father, Lord de Latinee, is very wealthy. He allows me more than I ought ever to think of spending.  Moreover, he is benevolent and  kind. Sign in your heart the pledge of forever abandoning the gaming table, and trust me I will do all I can to remove this load from your breast.' "Osborn looked up as if he could not have heard rightly. His lips trembled, and his eyes were still dim with tears. "'Generous, noble youth!' he exclaimed, ,how can you take such an interest in a stranger? How can you be so kind to me, and I a foreigner besides? But this must not be.'  "Why not?' interrupted Charles, enthusiastically. 'Is not the mother of the lady of my heart, an Amer- ican? Is not my peerless Marie, the friend of your own beautiful wife?            '  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7224-00000111"/> 216       ELMWOOD, -- OR, 4' Marie D'Arblay! Your betrothed!

But she is my cousin; her mother's sister mar- ried my father.' "' You do astonish me! Count Tortenay told me you were a stripling, not yet out of parental leading- strings; but mentioned nothing further.' "Osborn then turned to me, saying, - "' Monsieur Louis, already am I under obligations to you; I have not wholly discharged my debt. Though repayment of the sum loaned, I acknowledge has been made; yet your former kindness, and your present interest, leave me owing you much; that, beggarly as I am, not only in purse but in character, I can scarcely ever hope to repay. Accept my heart- felt gratitude. The riches of a feeling heart, I be- lieve I still retain. Impulses of a better nature have come at length to my aid. And your dear generous friend, you must not suffer through my evil conduct,' (he said to Charles.) ' As Marie's uncle,' he con- tinued to me, ' let me pray you repeat to the mother, as I will to Mademoiselle D'Arblay, the heroic con- duct of this noble young man! There is in him the germ of real good that will expand and ripen, and recover the effects of the mildew, that at one time- proposed to destroy the whole plant.

Also to the parents of my dear young wife, will I expose my errors, and rely on their forgiveness and aid in my distressing situation. I will make all the return I can for their pardon and clemency, for I doubt not of it, when I enclose them my written bond, signed as I will sign it, in the im- mediate presence of you two as may witnesses, that henceforth and forever, I abandon any  and every game, that holds out a moneyed lure to tempt and excite the passions of a man. Moreover, it is my wish to enter some business, where I can be of use; and if my Helen's father, Mr. Lyle, will take me into his counting-room, I shall be only too happy to obey him there.' "' Viva! viva!' shouted Charles, 'and until answer comes from these American friends, M. George Os- born must be in debt to Lord de Latinee, instead of the Count Tortenay.   See here! I hold the bank notes in my hand, and before the sun sets this glo- rious day, the husband of Marie's friend shall be a man again! and the wily Count lose his   fearful power forever, over both body and soul. Viva! viv a! ' "Again, overpowered, Osborn sank in his chair. I hen said,- "' Let it be eo, Mr. Oborn.

' The relief is so great, from the release of debt to such a man as Count Tortenay; to be in the exercise of free thought and action again, that I fear I do not sufficiently express my gratitude, for though the same in debt still to a friend, I am not fettered in my soul as before. And I will, yes, my friends, be yet worthy your esteem. George Osborn, the dandy'! the fine gentleman! George Osborn, the gambler! the almost villain!

" Excuse me,' said Charles, aside. ' I must receive an invitation first, my dear sir. Besides, I must pay this bill at the hotel, and see that Count Tortenay -receives this money, and gives the required acknowl- edgment of it before faithful witnesses. I will say I am sent to pay the same.' ,' Come, Osborn, you must away with me, at all events,' I exclaimed, ' so not another word now, and put on a bright smile; for the lovely Helen needs more of your attention than you have recently be- stowed.' "So you see, dear sister, Mr. Osborn drove with me to his former hotel, having some effects there to see about, and wishing to write immediately to his friends, he will not join us until evening. Repeat the   HELEN AND EMA.      219 whole truth both to Helen and Marie. I dislike any- thing but the entire truth, you remember. Prepare Helen; and let us be glad, my beloved Amina, that we have been allowed to be instrumental in re- awakening virtue in the hearts of these young men; and in saving a beautiful flower from the grave of a corrupt soil." Madame D'Arblay repeated faithfully these partic- ulars to the friends, as they sat lovingly together on the divan by her side. Various were the emotions in the heart of each. The young wife at first feeling horror, then grief, next surprise, and last of all a joy of relief. Marie's eyes sparkled at the nobleness of her lover, then tears bedewed her cheeks; she arose and left the apartment. "My brother will return the ring for you, dear Helen," said Madame D'Arblay.  "In a gentle and polite manner he will thank the Count, and tell him American wives seldom receive valuable gifts from unmarried men." Leaving our friends all at Glensarde, the Osborns anxiously awaiting letters, we wtould say, Count Tortenay has not made his appearance at the cha- teau since the repayment of his debt, and the return of the ring, perhaps thinking it time to change his affections since they were so uselessly bestowed.

"I agree with you, Emma, for I feel more truly at home to-night than since you left," said Mr. Elliott. "But where is Henry?" "Here he is, sir," said the young man. "Emma at home again? When did you return? How well you look! This is a surprise!" "I suppose you don't care about the news from the South to-day, sir. Eh! boy?" said Mr. Elliott. "Indeed I do, sir, and I expect to hear it all in due season; but when did- you come, Emma?" "This morning I arrived at home, and am glad to see father and you in apparent health, though you look pale and-thinner, I think, Henry." "That is the nature of the law, Emma, to use up all the materials it can. But now you call my atten- tion, I think he has lost flesh.

"You shall be obeyed, father; I will ask leave of absence on Monday, and return ready to commence my labors?' Emma related her Southern experience, and the particulars with which we are already acquainted. She told Henry of the three negro women who had come on with her, and of Mr. Jarvis, under whose care she was placed. "Where are the women?" asked Henry. "Here, my boy," said Mr. Elliott, "1in this very house. Now don't fall in love with either of the three graces, for the names of Dinah, Chloe or Thisbe, neither of them would sound very harmoni- ous coupled to Elliott; besides, a slight objection as regards color, on my part." ;"Why, father, how happy you seem." "I It was your happiness, my son, that made me fear you would fall in love with everything that came in your way; that is why I cautioned you concerning the above ladies." 4' And Mathilde seems really happy, Emma," said Henry, addressing his sister., "She does truly so. She has not forgotten her dear Massachusetts friends. What has occurred in our little sphere since I left?" "Your friend, Mrs. Domett, and her child prosper.

Tuesday morning, Henry commenced his active employment in the garden; it ended by his tying up a choice bouquet for Emma, formed of -ler favorite flowers. He carried it to her in the drawing-room, thinking to find her alone, but she was reading to his father, and the soft tones of her voice fell like music upon his ear. He laid the bouquet gently by her side, and sat down to become a ready listener to the sound, if not to the sense. But Mr. Elliott assailed him, soon as Emma finished her sentence. "Hoity, toity! Mr. Gardener, who gave you leave to cut off my choicest flowers? I sent you there to study physiology, and you seem to have opened the book of sentiment instead." "Indeed, sir," said Henry, coloring quite too much for a young man, "I performed much physical labor, and you certainly do not wish your flowers to lose their sweetness on the desert air.' ' "So you brought them hither to waste on lady fair? Eh? my'boy. Come, Emma, you promised to sing me those little songs you learned of Mrs. Amory, let me hear them now, my child." Emma complied with her father's request. Henry had arisen and was apparently gazing out of the window, but in reality he was looking inward, trying to discover why it was, that foolish- heart of his gave such evident acknowledgment of its where- abouts. Since Emma had left Elmwood, Henry had felt as if the whole place was changed. It was de-prived of its   HELEN AND EMMA.       223 fairest ornament. But what was that to him? Emma was his adopted sister; yet she was not related to him by ties of consanguinity, nearer than fourth or fifth cousinship. Might it not be, after all, something to him where Emma was?

Six weeks had now passed since the letters were sent to America by Mr. Osborn. The beginning of the seventh brought a package directed to him. There were letters for Helen, also one for Madame D'Arblay and her brother, another for Charles D'Lat- inee, coming from the immediate relatives of the Osborns. It was with great trepidation George broke the seal, though the weeks past had given him renewed strength to endeavor and retrieve his past errors. Yet these letters were of great importance to his future career. The first one opened, from his uncle Osborn, was written evidently in pain. He had been ill. The distress caused by his nephew's folly was very great, but the repentance awoke forgiveness in his heart. He had consulted with Mr. Lyle, who had agreed to pay half the debt, and he would remit the other por- tion. "This time, and this only, George," said the letter, " do I aid you in paying money that has been worse used than throwing it away. Mr. Lyle and myself both feel you had better return immediately. We send you means to fully pay all your debts con- tracted abroad, and also sufficient to defray your   H ELEN AND EMMA.      225 expenses home. We are all of us under great obliga- tions to your faithful friends. As Madame D'Arblay was born in America, I hope with her family, she may yet visit us, where she will receive a hearty welcome." This was the amount of the letter.. Mr. Lyle's epistle was similar, mingling reproof with kindness, and his best wishes to see the result of George's resolutions such as he anticipated. He would receive his son-in-law at once into his count- ing-room, upon his return. He might be awkward at first, no matter for that; he would himself assist and teach him. "Anything, my son," he continued, "is better than to be idle. Industry has no time to spare for folly; while idleness is a fair mark for all sort of evil doings. You have done wrong. You are repentant. God forgives you, so do I. But come home, George; bring back my darling child to gladden again our hearts. You must both live with us now. Persevere  in your good designs, and we may all be happier than ever before." Osborn had not written home of the danger in which Helen had been placed by her acquaintance with Count Tortenay. He intended to tell every cir- cumstance on his return. The kind, honest letter of Mr. Lyle affected him much. Mrs. Lyle's letter to her daughter was full of the expectation of seeing her again. She regretted her husband should have been led astray, and disliked the idea of his entering Mr. Lyle's counting-room. She said it was still called his counting-room; though,  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7224-00000116"/> 226       E LMWOOD, - OR, as she knew, her father had long retired from busi- ness himself, and was only a silent moneyed partner in the concern. The latter part of Mrs. Lyle's letter was devoted to personal requirements of her own. She had sent Helen a private purse, wishing her to bring home the latest fashions for their mutual benefit. She was Mrs. Lyle still. She had most truly expressed thanks for the kindness of Madame D'Arblay and family, and earnestly repeated the Osborns' wish, " that they should come to America and visit them at their own home.! Great was the relief of Mr. Osborn at the clemency of his friends. He felt sincere gratitude, though disappointed of his projected tour to Italy and else- where. He hoped the time might come, when that, wish might more reasonably be gratified. His whole mind was now bent on giving some genuine evidence to his friends of the change in his character. The D'Arblays were fine specimens of goodness and generosity. These flowers of human kindness and love may be found in all parts of the world, though often undiscovered, because the great power of circumstance does not always call them into prom- inent -action. Madame D'Arblay and her good brother had im- proved every opportunity of conversing with Osborn, leading him to feel the incapacity of his former life to insure him either permanent peace or happiness. The D'Arblays were much pleased with their invi- tation to America, and did not deem it impossible,   HELEN AND EMMA.      227 that at some future time, they might with consistency accept it. Mr. Osborn immediately repaid his debt of honor to Lord de Latin6e, who received him kindly, telling him-"Charles had introduced him to his acquaint- ance, with full particulars of his affairs." "An unpleasant introduction, my lord," said Osborn. "Perhaps the acquaintance may prove pleasanterr' replied the nobleman, courteously. "That, I fear, will be impossible. I remain only a few days longer in Paris. Where is your noble son, my lord, that I may once more thank him for his true friendship to a stranger?" Lord de Latinee drew himself up proudly at this commendation of his beloved child. He felt that he was all this - and more. "My son has gone to England. It was a sudden conclusion I came to, and his friends at Glensarde are as yet ignorant of it. He left three days since; I know you esteem my boy, and I think I may place confidence in you. When Charles made his confes- sion to me of the sad manner in which he had spent the money I allowed him, and the atnount of debt incurred in like folly, he also said,- "' Another confession, father, and then my mind will be relieved. Yes, dear father, clear to you as the crystal innocence of my childhood. And Iv at least, shall find a true friend in my only refmaining parent, if all else is denied me on earth.' "The boy, the foolish child," (here the father brush- ed away a trembling tear on his wrinkled face, seem-  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7224-00000117"/> 228       ELMWOOD, - OR, ingly overcome with the remembrance,) " that proud boy was so subdued, so humble, and looked, so sor- rowful, I knew before he spoke that some lady was mysteriously connected with his grief. Speak, my boy, said I, unburden your whole heart, and it will  beat less heavily in your breast. He then told me all concerning Marie D'Arblay, the girl-angel that saved my child. I will speaktruly, Monsieur Osborn. My wealth, and anon, yes, soon, soon my title might gain for him a wife as high in rank as himself. I might have wished this. I never dreamt of Marie as a wife, for Charles. Her beauty, I at one- time thought, might attract his boyish admiration, as a mere amuse- ment, for the time being, -without real interest on either side. But, Monsieur, how noble she is!-T Though she has refused my darling, my boy, yet she has saved him! My lost and beloved Louise was Madame D'Arblay's sister. She was sent with her to be educated at a convent near Paris, by a- very wealthy uncle residing in that city. I became de- votedly in love with my Louise, who was much younger than myself, and very beautiful. Three of our children died, and Charles, the babe, she left me as a farewell token on the earth. He is now my all." Lord de Latinee paused, as an acknowledgment to the sacredness of his wife's memory, "Madame D'Arblay's marriage (for you know she was married at Paris) did not please her uncle, and while he endowed Louise at his death, with a hand- some sum, he gave little to her sister. Seeing my boy so depressed in spirits, and not wishing others to know the cause, I made it -an urgent request -of my  , *  i1*'                HELEN AND EMMA.       229 son, that he should personally transact some business for me in England. He will -be gone three months. It is very hard for me to bear the separation, but his happiness should be all I think of now." "How very sorry I am, my lord, that he has left. I brought an urgent invitation from your sister-in. law, at ,Glensarde, for him to visit them, soon as was agreeable to himself, for he would be a wielcome guest." '"Ah! I asked Charles if Marie had not returned his affection, but he avoided that part of the subject. He did not seem entirely hopeless, but was dispirited when left to himself. I saw, without his perceiving it, a growing melancholy." "Pardon my interrupting you, my Lord; as you have so flatteringly confided in me, allow me also to return the compliment, and enlighten you in some measure. Marie D'Arblay is even more worthy of your admiration and love than you suspect. My wife and Marie are intimate friends; daily intercourse for a few weeks has cemented an affection which women often feel for one another, when no rivalry interposes to prevent. Marie loves your son in the most devoted manner. She has told Helen (my wife) the great struggle it cost her to keep herself firm, both in her words and conduct, at their last interview.  She thought she read- the true nature of your son, and with the instinctive love of woman's heart she read it correctly. Had she accepted him as he was then, even with your desire added to his own, he would never, perhaps, have become what he is now, and I hope ever will be, an honor to you, my lord, and to all his friends." 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7224-00000118"/> 230       ELMWOOD, -- OR, "Does Marie then love the boy?" said the excited parent. "Better than all else here, I imagine. She looks pale, and oftentimes pensive; but her principle tri- umphs over all her impulses. She is a rare example of female loveliness. One so very young seldom has so much fortitude in action." "Her mother educated her, Monsieur; Madame ,D'Arblay is worthy to have such a daughter, for she is a very superior person. They both love, do they? Yes, yes, it shall be. Charles will prove his reforma- tion, and they shall be proud to receive my boy, and I will be proud to call MarieD'Arblay my daughter. Why, is she not the niece of mny beloved Louise? that is rank enough; foolish old man that I was. Pardon me, dear sainted one : All, all shall be couleur-de- rose yet. I almost wish my boy was here, my dear, dear child. B-ut' keep still, Monsieur Osborn. Do not repeat a word; let things work round themselves. And you go in two ayXs? Well, God bless you and yours. I suppose this, a it is our first, will also be our last meeting."  X '4 Yes, I fear so, my lord; pray remember me affec- tionately to your son. Here i'the letter sent him by my friends. I yet hope to welcome him in my na- tive land as my friend and guest." "Adieu! Monsieur Osborn, adieu." With one more hearty shake of the hand, and a low obeisance to- the age of his friend's father, and the respect his character commanded, Osborn departed With a tear-drop in his eye that fell upon his hand, ere he withdrew from the scene of this affecting inter- view.   HELEN AND EMMA.       231 CHAPTER XXXVIII. "How do you like living at the North, Chloe?" said Mr. Elliott, seeing her performing some domestic duty in the house. "Young missus male all places shiny," said the woman. "What is your name, Chloe? Chloe what?" "Lor, Massa, I never thought. I guess I did'nt have any but Chloe. It's Chloe Allenby, I 'spose, that's it." "What are Dinah and Thisbe's names?" "Oh! Massa Elliott, if one's Allenby, all's is, you know." "Then there was quite a family of Allenbys on your plantation?" Lor, Massa, there was one time besides all the house family, sixteen niggers of us in our huts, but that's afore dear mistress died. Those were shiny days for the slave; but times changed when old Ponsby bought us up, and let us out to Master Trickey, who was a cruel massa, I'se knows full well." "Do you like to work, Chloe?" "I like's work for young missus, and young home- missus out there; and I guess Chloe likes to work  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7224-00000119"/> ELMWOOD, ..- OR like a free nigger, but didn't like to work for Massa Trickey, and wouldn't work sometimes." " That was wrong, Chloe, you should have obeyed him, and not been idle." "Lor, Massa, I guess he took skin pay from me." "Well, well, those times are past. I hope you will learn to be good and faithful to those who employ you, and become a nice woman yet." " Thank you, Massa, it does Chloe good not to be called nigger-wench and black jade. How I'se likes to be free! Everybody seems to think here, that I'm a real woman, and made of flesh and blood like them. A'nt it jubilee to be free!" "You must show your gratitude, Chloe, by trying to learn all you can that is right, and be kind and good to everybody else." So I'se shall, Massa." 4 Your Missus calls you, Chloe," said Mr. Elliott. " X-cuse I," said Chloe." This courtesy she had already learned since she had been at the North, having heard Miss Elliott ask her father to excuse her, when called abruptly from the table. She now thought she had performed a great act, in showing this knowledge to Mr. Elliott, and with a self-satisfied grin hastened to her mistress. " Well, dear father," said Henry, coming in from the piazza, " I think it my time to fear now. Have you not been holding consultation -with Miss Chloe for some time? I think I may say, I have some ob- jection to color in a mother-in-law." " That's igt, .you rogte, why you really can return a joke. But what on earth, Henry, makes Arthur   a   -Mansfield send so many bouquets here? Scarcely a day passes, but the porter brings in-a bunch of flow- ere, with Mr. Mansfield's compliments. What on earth can he think I want of his flowers, when my own conservatory is full ?" "I did not know, sir, he ever sent any here. I have not heard of it before. I introduced Mansfield here at one of our fancy gatherings several years ago, and he has called repeatedly when in town, since that time." "Why, Henry, he has called every wdek since Emma's return." " Indeed, father! Of course; the bouquets were for her. Strange! she never spoke of them." "Has she not mentioned his visits ? She is gen- erally very communicative of events to you. I never thought much about it, but as this was just placed in the water by Chloe, I was attracted to it; the flowers are certainly very lovely. You do not notice them, Henry; you pretend to be very fond of flowers gen- erally." "They are very fine, sir." Where is Emma, that she does not come and say a few kind words to them. She always talks to her flowers. She has a little wreath of sentiment, whose perfume often tell tales of its hiding place in her heart." "Has not Emma seen them, sir?

But what's all this animation -about? Is it anything to you, eh?" "Not much, sir. I just happened to have given her those myself, that's all." "You giving flowers to a young lady! Do Coke and Littleton teach you how to select them? A few xmoments ago I should have thought the 'forget-me- not' was to have been woven on 'bachelor's buttons' for you; or a sprig for your breast, of 'love-lies-a- bleeding.' But now ,'Tis roses and lilies and myrtles so fair, Yet neither can with my sweet sister compare.' Eh! Henry, roguish boy. Father does not need spectacles to look into the human heart. You can- not tell me anything; I know all. My permission you have freely; then, indeed, I shall have tWvo chil- dren of my own." "Father! what mean you? Your words overcome mne. I can never hope for such a treasure to become mine. I never yet breathed a sound of love into her ear." "What are words, boy? Love looks, and in those looks confesses words unspoken." "How poetical you are growing, dear father!" "My subject, Henry, is the poetry of human-na- ture. It is true affection that blends so beautifully with the prose -of our every-day life.

"- How long it is since I saw you last, and you are really grown, Carrie," said Miss Elliott to a very pleasing'girl, who had just entered her little private parlor. ' Yes, I am now grown up all I ever shall be. I shall never be much anyhow. You remember Miss Undertake always said that, and, of- course, it must be so." -"When did you come to town?" asked Emma. "Yesterday; I am staying with my aunt at Wood- fern. I had -not seen you since your return, and thought I must come to-day." "Thank you, dear Carrie, for the remembrance." "What beautiful flowers! where did they come from, Emma?" "Mr. Mansfield sent them here." "To you, I suppose. What a delightful young man he is. I danced with him six times the last ball I attended. Does he come here often?" "Occasionally," said Emma. "Have you heard the last news, -Emma?

Oh! you are the same Emma Elliott as ever! Utility yet, your watchword.

PLEASANTLY seated in a family circle we find- our friends, the Osborns, once more in the home of Helen's youth. Mr. Lyle and his son-in-law have already had several private interviews, and business matters were settled between them. Mr. Osborn carried Helen directly to her father's residence on their arrival, though- she afterwards visited those relatives on whose kindness he was dependant. Old Mr. Osborn received his nephew kindly, affec- tionately encouraging him in his reformation. Helen's pride, even after all the kind influences the D'Arblays had exercised upon her, revolted still at her elegant husband's going from his leisure into the business man; but she reconciled herself, thinking her mother would be with her now, and they could visit together. For Helen's love of display was again brought into full action by that parent's wishing her to appear in the latest Parisian fashion, and becomle, as before, a leader in their gay circles. Mr. LyleI found full employment for his benevo- lence and his rough, though honest good nature, in initiating George in his duties. He knew when old   HELEN AND EMMA.      239 Mr. Osborn died, his nephew would have a snug property; but he felt it so necessary for George's true happiness, and that of his darling Helen, to lead him from himself into active employment, that he really went to much inconvenience to bring all things rightly about; but he succeeded well in his under- taking. The D'Arblays continued to correspond with their American friends, but no important event had yet transpired. Mrs.. Lyle and her daughter passed their time in a similar manner to what they did before her child's marriage; but of late, Helen's mother had complained of much pain in her side, and seemed not to enjoy her usual health. Still she went out, and often very imprudently. Mrs. Lee had been one of Mrs. Lyle's intimate friends during Helen's absence. She told her one day, "'that she thought her mother needed physical care, that her gay spirits enabled her to bear up beyond her strength." Mrs. Osborn replied, "her mother did speak of some pain, but she had, not thought much about it, as she was ever ready to join in all the dissipations of the day." It had never occurred to Helen that her mother would die, or could die, she felt her so necessary to her own existence. She repeated to her father Mrs. Lee's remark. Mr. Lyle, good man, had not thought at all about it, being so engaged with his son-in-law. "Come to -think of it, Nellie dear," said he to his  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7224-00000123"/> 240f      ELMWOO --- OR daughter, " your mother did often say that ' she felt ill during your absence ;' but I thought it was you she sighed for, and that made her low spirited. Since your return she has seemed bright as a lark." "Not always, sir; she fainted away yesterday, when we came in from a long drive.' "Indeed! child, why did you not speak of it?"- "Mother forbade me, said you would laugh at it, and call it a scene." - Helen! I shall send for Doctor Rone to-night. Say, nothing to your mother; let her think it a friendly call. He will manage the matter well." Some weeks after this conversation, our poor young friend was motherless. Had Mrs. Lyle's disease been attended to in season, it might possibly have been checked. She neglected it, and her love of society made her reckless. Since her child's return, she had struggled in vain to forget her sufferings, in the joy she felt at partipcipating with her beautiful daughter in a round of anusements. This was a great trial to Helen. /She not only grieved for her mother, whom she loved, but she felt selfish sorrow also for one on whom she depended, who did so much for her. She was at first incon- solable,  Mr. Lyle was much affecteod, but his manliness gave him self-control. All the endearing tenderness of a devoted father he bestowed on his child, but she would not be comforted/ Her husband seemed to have .ost all power of soothing her. -W1lout re igious ml inciple to sustain her in her first real sorrow, she felt a if her whole happiness in   HELEN AND EMMA.       241 life was shattered; that she must have her mother on earth, or she must die also. Eventually a calmer state came to her, and then she asked --"What was she going to do?"Her husband and father -absent most of the time, and her adviser, comforter and companion was no more. After Helen's marriage, Mrs. Lyle had discharged her housekeeper, having had -much trouble with her. and her other domestics. She had then resumed the responsibilities as head of the household, and contin. ued so while she lived. Now Helen was called to that painful task, at any time, of occupying a 16ost parent's position in the family circle. But what v trying one it was to her, She was totally ignorant of her duties and cares. Mr. Lyle would have had a housekeeper again, but both Mr. Osborn and himself thought it every way for Helen's best good, that she should feel obliged to arouse herself to immediate action. They agreed not to notice, for a while, any delinquencies that might occur under her manage- ment, but to encourage her by appearing pleased with her efforts. Mrs. Lee kindly offered assistance, and was often an adviser, though not always a judicious one. 4"If it were not for the domestics, I could manage to endure this housekeeping," said Helen to her hus- band after six months' experience, " but really I must give up my care soon to a competent person, for these trials are more than I can bear. The help are con- tinually quarreling one with another, and then come to me to settle their disputes, making me act the part of umpire between them.

You remember, George, I ever told you before our marriage, I should prefer to board at some hotel rather than keep an establishment of my own." "I am sorry, dear Helen, for your troubles," re- plied her husband, and regret your friend, Emma Elliott, could not have come to us as we hoped, but Mr. Elliott's illness prevented. I trust he will soon be convalescent; perhaps Emma could :aid you in this matter. I too have trials in my new position. My false pride has received many a sad rebuff. I can tell you it was very hard for George Osborn, the dandy, (for one I was, my wife,) to become the ear- nest man of business. I remember, now, my own 'dear mother's remarks to me when I was a child:- ' Georgy, do not spend so much time adorning your person. I like to have you neat and nice, but not fanciful. This vanity will one day cause you great unhappiness; rather, my son, adorn your heart and mind, for your mother knows there is some real good under all this exterior rubbish. You will one day re- call my words, and if you follow my advice, you will then thank me. It is your good, my boy, I am seek- ing to insure.' Had my kind mother lived, or had I heeded her oft-spoken words of wisdom, how much better a husband might you have had, dearest Helen; but it is useless to regret the past now. I experience daily annoyances from my former folly. I deserve it, and try to bear up cheerfully. Your good father is my guardian angel; he is so honest and true to me in his dealings.

"Come, my children," said the person in question, "what are you holding consultation upon?" "Concerning one Mr. Lyle, father; he was our last topic." "Rather a worn-out subject by this time, one might suppose. Can he assist you any way? I came to tell you, my child, that three friends from the South will dine with us, so have all things in order, my dear." "Dear father, I am so sorry. Mary, the cook, is going away to-morrow, and is extremely ill-natured. I fear she will spoil the dinner. She is angry with the porter, and will not remain if he is allowed to stay."9 "g Well, well, do the best you can, dear, to-day; for these are friends I esteem, and would wish to have comfortably entertained." "Father! I am tired of housekeeping, and think I shall engage a woman immediately, to act in the capacity of housekeeper." "Do not give up yet, my daughter. Let six months more pass, and then if you cannot act farther, your wish shall be complied with. If you are unwilling to oblige me, you can please yourself with a person at once; but it would gratify me greatly to have you persevere. Come, Osborn, we must to the business mart.

"I am deeply interested reading that new work, and now I must descend, yes, descend is the very word, to the kitchen, and let culinary matters occupy my mind; then to the dining hall, to see if all things are in order there. Oh! how glad I shall be when this thraldom is over. I dislike being obliged- to do anything, it is so much pleasanter to act just as one feels inclined." -   HELEN AND EMMA.      245 CHAPTER    XL. "WHAT do you think, doctor," said our pale friend Emma, "concerning Mr. Elliott?" "Decidedly favorable symptoms, Miss. If you do not take more rest, you will be mny next patient. Your father is better; he must be kept quiet, and all will soon be right." "How thankful I am, sir." "Then take a good nap upon it. Remember, physicians' orders must be obeyed. Your father is in a gentle sleep. Mrs. Trent will remain with'him, and you must to your couch. I wish you to be bright to-morrow. If all is as I now hope it will be, I want to have some conversation with you then." Emma obeyed the good doctor's prescription, for she truly needed rest. Mr. Elliott had experienced the true worth of his adopted child during his illness, she had been so de- voted in her attentions. To Henry, she seemed the ministering angel, making the darkened apartment still light by her consoling presence to the sufferer. The following morning found Mr. Elliott much improved. Doctor Lindsay said, "all that he needed now was time to restore him again to health."

I am going to take a walk in your garden-with Miss Emma, to give her a little fresh air for a while," said the doctor. "So do, doctors said Mr. Elliott, feebly. "Do not let my precious flower suffer for want of tender care.2 "No more at present, sir. You must keep very still, and let Mrs. Trent do the talking. She must amuse you-love stories, remember-not tales of ghosts and goblins; something to interest, yet not excite. You know exactly, ma'am; I see, by your spectacles being thrown up on your forehead. Well, good day; don't forget my directions - pills at "Yes, sir, I know all," interrupted Mrs. Trent, and the doctor and Emma went out to the conservatory. "Do you know Mrs. Emerson, my dear Miss Elliotf?" asked the doctor. "Slightly, sir." "She is suffering severely with neuralgia. How I wish I could obtain a nurse like you for her. Poor woman! It is impossible to judge of her anguish, unless constantly with her. It is so difficult to get a proper person to take care of her, I certainly think, my dear, if I had leisure, I would establish a school for the education of nurses, for particular diseases." "Had I not on hand a project of my own, I would ^   HELEN AND EMMA.       247 offer to aid you in the desire you expressed," said Emma. "What I wanted to ask of you was, if you had not among your charity acquaintance a person you could well recommend for Mrs. Emerson? I have seen my- self, you well know the duties of a nurse. It is a high and holy office, and one that should give great satisfaction to the person possessing such a gift, for gift I think it is, naturally." "I do know of one that will suit you exactly. She -is gentle, yet firm; quiet, but strong; with an edu- cated heart and conscience; her sensibilities active to feel, but strengthened to endure." "( Admirable! Go on, you are giving utterance to my idea of a true nurse." "The woman I refer to is a widow, Mrs. Harris. She has suffered mentally and physically. She goes into the chamber of sickness with a light step; every- thing is done with gentle care, all bustle and impor- tance is avoided. She seems to do all that is requisite for the comfort of the invalid, and yet you are hardly aware how it is accomplished. The room is perfectly orderly. The medicine by itself. The glasses, spoons, and like matters, clean and clear, are on a waiter by themselves. Paper near at hand for the physician's prescriptions, already cut into different sized pieces, that the noise of tearing the paper may be avoided. The patient kept in nice order as possible under the- circumstances. The linen and the bed fresh. Oh! sir, these little tender mercies of the sick room, though seemingly of minor importance to the man in strong -health, are so grateful, so refreshing to the poor suf-  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7224-00000127"/> 248       ELMWOOD,-- OR, ferer. Like dew to the thirsty earth, so do these drops of human forethought and kindness fall on. the deli- cate sensibilities of the invalid." "True, my dear young lady, you make the tears come into my eyes at your description; for it brings Mrs. Emerson's case so before my mind, and her great need of a true nurse after your turn. They say we doctors get hardened to our practice. It is a school of discipline truly, but I never yet have witnessed great suffering without sorrow in my heart. To be sure, outward control is essential to the well-being of those under our care, but many times have I wept inwardly when duty bade me be firm in appear- ance." "I have no doubt of it, doctor. The world, as usual, jutdges the whole fraternity of medical men by a few, who may have given cause for remarks of an unkind nature to be made. I am glad we think alike concerning the office of a nurse. I think the profes- sion of a true physician is also both high and holy. Think, sir, how much he may benefit the soul as well as body. I once knew a poor sailor, who was so in- jured on board his vessel that he was obliged to be sent to the marine hospital after the ship came into port. He suffered severely, and no possible hope was entertained of his recovery. He seemed distressed in mind; his physician, one of our good Samaritan doctors, perceived this, and kindly questioned him. "Oh! sir,' said he, ' and heartily I could go aloft, were it not for the love of Jessie and my mother's bible. That bible, sir, I wish I could see once more; it is in my chest, for I kept it wrapt up; yes, sir, I kept it for *    .       ,   HELEN AND EMMA.      249 my mother's sake, though I did not read it. When a boy, the very day I went to sea, my mother gave me that bible as the mainstay of my life. She told me to be ruled by that compass, and I should always steer rightly. Bless you, Jim! bless you, my boy, said she, good bye. And my mother's warm kiss sent such a dash of brine into my eyes, that all the old sea breezes have never cooled that spot on my cheek, for I think' I feel it there even now. But my mother is dead. Three years the- grass has grown over her grave. And Jessie, poor Jessie, the bonny Scotch lassie, she was all that was left to smile upon me when our gallant brig entered the noble harbor. She'il watch in vain next time; and her heart will soon be wrecked on the sea of sorrow for poor Jim. Oh sir, I cannot bear to think of that, for *he was *o canny' and winsome, and loved the English sailor from a-little boy.' The kind physician offered to do all he could for the sufferer; he took his bible from the chest and read to him; he wrote a parting letter to the beloved Scotch maiden, under the sailors' dic- tion; he prayed with him, and 'healed the afflicted soul, though he could not save the body. The sailor died calmly. 'Tell Jessie, all's right ahead--now. She must not grieve, I have found the true beacon light, and am fast steering to the haven of rest. Send her my mother's bible, and God guide yotir own bark safely, sir; to the snug harbor of Eternity.' These were his last words to the good man, who so faith- fully attended him, and though he realized no,extra fee that was tangible on earth, do you not think, sir," asked Emma, "he made a joyous investment in Heaven?"  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7224-00000128"/> 250       ELMWOOD,- OR, "( He must have felt great satisfaction in his own heart to see the good effects he produced." "So you allow, dear doctor, how much moral med- icine a true physician can administer with some knowledge of a mind, that if it does not benefit, surely cannot produce any evil results." *( Where do you learn so many things, my young girl? You seem most too good to be in the midst of us frail mortals."  "Good, sir, it is because you do not see my faults, that you make such a remark. I have many serious faults, I. assure you; it is painful for me to have you mistake me. But what am I to do concerning Mrs. Harris?" "Engage her by all means. Mrs. Emerson urged me to find some one I could rely on. You are so prudent, Miss Emma, I will just state the plain truth to you. My patient has been ill a number of years. Her disease, as neuralgia implies, is upon the nerves. She has and does suffer intensely at times; again she rallies, and is apparently well. It has not, as yet, actually killed the body, though her spirits begin to droop from its, of late, frequent recurrence. Her friends know that she suffers, and as they cannot ma- terially aid her, and as they feel she will outlive-the attack, they, with no unkindness meant on their part, become so accustomed to feel that it is her lot, that they do lose sight of, the great reality, as it is to her. Her husband is an honest, honorable man, engrossed by business. He is fond of his wife, willing to pro- vide everything he can for her comfort in the moneyed line. But his own strong health prevents his feeling   HELEN AND EMMA.       251 that peculiar sympathy, a delicate organization like hers seems to require. Thus her situation is rendered still more trying to endure. May you never know from experience, dear girl, what this writhing pain is. To give you some idea of its nature, that you also may, if you will, repeat the same to nurse Harris, ] will use Mrs. IEEmerson's own words. "' Define neuralgia, doctor? said she. 4 It is as if all at once, your pride of health was humbled by a sudden blow into agony. An inward tempest raging in the body, and demon after demon hurling all man- ner of weapons in fierce sport at the commotion. Its very breath is excitement. It feeds itself afresh-from the boundless resources the storehouse of the nerves affords. They struggle in vain; it will gorge itself until its appetite is appeased, and then vanish as sud- denly as it appeared. It is a fearful power, doctor; none can understand its mystic meaning, but those who have experienced its effects. And they can never forget the thraldom of its slavery.' "Mrs., Emerson does suffer, Miss Emma, beyond description in words. I can aid her but little during the spasms. How to promote her general health is my study. Did not Mr. Elliott require you at pres- ent, I should ask you to visit her." "Soon as my father is convalescent, so as to allow, it shall be my first care. But would she like to see me?" "I swill tell her about you, Miss Emmra, She in very sensitive at all times, but as my friend I shall introduce you. I really think youl:ay find both pleasure and profit in the acquaintance."

Of all strange affairs, I think this the most novel," said Helen Osborn to her Papa, ("Mrs. Brown, the matron of the Orphan's Friend Society, brought a beautiful little curly-headed infant here to-day, and wanted me to adopt it. Was it not a joke?" "Considering what Mrs. Helen Osborn's ideas of care and trouble are, it must appear so to her. Had she been older and wiser, I might have thought of it in a different light," replied Mr. Lyle. "It was really a pretty baby, father, but I never liked to play with dolls in my youth, and I do not think I should like a live doll belonging to a stranger, any better now. She told a pitiable tale concerning it. She said, 'she knew I -had much leisure, and might find enjoyment in doing good.' I declined the honor of mother by proxy; and what do you think I did? Why, I sent her to Mrs. James Irving, who has already two adopted children, and I thought might like another, to have a trio on whom to dispense her 'benefits. She is remarkably fond of benevolent e  fforts.  "Would it be productive of any good effects, my 22  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7224-00000130"/> 254       ELMWOOD,--) OR, dear Helen, I think I should try to convince you, that your time might be very profitably spent in some such manner as Mrs. Brown proposed. You have my per- mission to exercise your benevolence on any fitting occasion to succor the unfortunate." "Oh, do not take up Mrs. Brown's text, Papa. She has given me a sermon by the way-side, ' On the duties of the rich to the poor.' It is enough for one day. Where is George? He promised to find time to ride out with me this afternoon. Our ponies are in fine order, and I am anxious for some excitement. Besides, I have never worn my Parisian riding-habit since I returned, and it is over a year now." "Who do you think is coming to America?" asked Mr. Osborn, gaily entering the apartment. "Letters, George? From Paris?" asked Helen. "Yes, dear wife, I opened mine; the next steamer we may expect  " "Do let me read for myself, George; do- give me my own epistles," said Helen. Truly it was a pleasant surprise for Helen to find her foreign friends were on a tour to her own coun- try. Lord de Latinee had deceased, but not until he had bestowed the idolized son upon the beautiful maiden of his love, Marie D'Arblay.    r On Charles's return from England, his father, from much former anxiety, as well as premature old age, began rapidly to decline. He repeated Mr. Osborn's conversation to his son, and told him he would be most happy to receive Marie DIArblay as a daughter. EHer conduct had convinced him of her worth.    HELEN AND EMMA,       255 Lord de Latinee sent for his sister-in-law, and after full explanation on either side, the father assuring her of Charles's good intentions for the future, he wished, without much delay, Marie might with her friends come to La Verate, and have the ceremony of mar- riage performed in his presence. His request was complied with. A month after the joyous wedding of the young persons, the sad event of his death followed. Thus must it ever be, smiles and tears, making sunshine and shade on the face of Time; still that agent goes on unchanging in this particular, until it merges itself in Eternity. Marie, now Lady de Latin'e, with her liege lord, mother and uncle, were on the broad sea, with America for their destination. This plan had been decided upon for the benefit of all parties. Before Marie left, ishe repaired to the beautiful cemetery of Pere-la-Chaise, and placed upon the grave of her husband's father a pure white amaranth- ine wreath, which she wove herself, emblematic of a "happy and serene immortality." This little act, though simple in itself, was a graceful tribute to the memory of the deceased, and as such was truly felt by the bereaved son. The D'Arblays were all anxious to see the lovely Helen once more% and Marie wished to give her per- sonal proof of her realized happiness in being the wife of one she so much loved. Madame D'Arblay ex- pected much enjoyment in viewing her native land again. "Father! what shall We do?" asked Helen, after  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7224-00000131"/> 256       ELMWOOD,-- OR, dealing out this information by degrees, as she first read to herself, and again aloud to her friends; " what can we do? Lord and Lady Latinee sounds so grand. Really, it throws a veil of awe over the young forms of Marie and Charles. I shall- not know how to re- ceive them now. But Madame D'Arblay and her brother will be just the same as ever." "Helen! You are wild with excitement, do be calmer, rpy love," said her father. "Your cheeks are glowing and your eyes sparkle. Pray tell me, can a title effect such animated changes in a woman's countenance?" "You forget, father, they are my friends, and must be my guests; and, of course, such important person- ages as they are, being of high rank in nobility, must be entertained accordingly." "Indeed, Miss, or Mrs. Helen, you seem already to ,feel reflected lustre shining from jewelled diadems, hey? But to be serious, my child, you must forget that your old friends hold other rank than what your heart could not but award their characters, and their kindness to you in a foreign land. They must be our guests while in the city. I shall insist upon that, and all that is in our power must be done for their comfort and enjoyment; not for the lord and lady, -but as a slight return for their attentions to a friendless stran- ger.: For such you truly were, Helen, when Madame D'Arblay rescued you from that villain, Count Do not start, my child, I know all.

HELEN AND EMMA.      257' "Do stop, father, it is you who seem agitated now." "Agitated! What can a man be made of if he does not feel his whole nature rise within him at the most degraded, debasing of all vices; that seeks to destroy the most exquisite of all flowers in a woman's soul, virtue! whose fragrance guards her very immor- tality." "Forbear, father! I cannot endure more." "Speak, dear Helen! the danger is past; I should not have recalled it. Arouse, my child. There- you are yourself again. Now remember your letters. Your friends will soon follow. I suppose you are ten thousand times thankful you have already engaged a housekeeper, and your year of trial past." "Indeed, I am, sir. How soon may we look for-  them?" "In about a week or ten days." And a week did bring the expected guests. They landed at New York, where finding urgent letters from the Osborns and Mr. Lyle, they came imme- diately on, wishing to meet their friends before they commenced sight-seeing, hoping Helen -might accom- pany them in the latter pursuit. Mr. Osborn's aunt and uncle put in their claim also, though Helen would insist her father's residence must be their home. The D'Arblays did not forget these elderly persons, -neither did Charles or Marie. The Osborns proposed giving a great entertain- ment in their honor, and consulted their nephew and his wife concerning it. This was exactly what Helen wished. Had her dear mother only have lived to 22*  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7224-00000132"/> 258      ELMWOOD,-- OR, have entertained real nobility, would she not have re- joiced, thought Helen. Seasons of festivity always brought that parent immediately to her remembrance. Helen's heart did not forget her mother's love either. She often mourned her loss; but her volatile nature wooed the light of day, rather than the softened shade of the melancholy hours. She was for impulsive action, and never so happy as when in the midst of fashion and frivolity. Mrs. James Osborn, George's aunt, made Helen queen of the festivities, and a fine affair it was. Their guests were well entertained. a Dear Helen," said Marie, "I cannot get an oppor- tunity to have a nice little conversation with you, so constantly are you planning for our amusement.

She never will be, methinks, except -to books, reason and philosophy." ' Take care, Helen, you hint at mental polygamy," said Marie. "Emma is a lovely being, Marie, one of those sweet spirits that sometimes mingle among mankind, to how how impossible it is for us common mortals to be like them." "What do you mean, my dear," asked Madame D'Arblay. "The truth is, Emma Elliott is almost perfect,. Madam; if anything goes wrong with thtose around her, they say, oh, if Emma were only here, all would   HELEN AND EMMA.       259 be right. She is to me a moral phenomenon. Ever since I knew her, she has been held up to me by rhy father for an example. Considering it entirely out of my power to reason myself into any kind of active goodness, and feeling I fall so far behind my friend, I chobse, for vanity's sake, to consider her only a planet from another sphere, which we lesser lights cannot equal in brilliancy." "What a compliment you paid me, dear Helen, by even mentioning my name with hers." "Neverthless, she looks and moves, nay, more, her spoken thoughts resemble those of my Lady de Latinee." "Thank you sincerely. Shall I see her?" "Yes, if she will not come to us we will go to her, even if we surprise her in the very midst of some benevolent proceeding. She passed a few weeks with me not long since, after her father's recovery. Here comes Carrie Lee!  "We know it all, Carrie. George told me to-day. Arthur Mansfield found his flowers faded at Elm- wood, and were not cherished for his sake. So he turned his steps away, and met a little lady, whose smiles fully repaid his former disappointment.

"I am Marie, and that only, to my friends; neither will Charles allow George to call him other than by his Christian name. Do tell us, Miss Lee, if it will gratify Helen, she is fond of humor." "Well, I must obey Mrs. Osborn. I always did at Glenwood. Mr. Mansfield being anxious for Miss Lee's portrait, proposed sending a particular friend of his, a promising young artist, to me to-day; and I was-to have my first sitting. Whereupon, there came into Miss Lee's unprofitable brain, an idea that she looked miserably off the canvas, and might look worse upon it. Mr. Drew, the crayon artist and min- iature painter, had never seen Miss Lee, so I sent black Carrie, whom you know some Southern friends named for me; who has been in our house as a ser- vant from my childhood. I sent her dressed up in one of my own garments, putting a wig upon her head, a Malta lace ruffle upon her neck, and an em- broidered handkerchief in her hand, with full instruc- tions exactly how to conduct in my place; and she obeyed, for she is bright and full of African wit. Im- agine Mr. Drew's entrance; he has arranged his easel --all things are in order. He then waits for the por- ter to usher in Miss Lee--the door opens--the astonished painter confronts the maiden!" "' Good day, sar,' says she. 'How shall I sit so you can have the best light?'" "' It was Miss Lee that I wished to see.' (' Dat's I.' "' Miss Caroline Lee.' "' Dat's me.

Soon as he left I entered from an adjoining room, where I had unseen enjoyed the joke exceedingly. Had Mr. Drew been a stranger to Arthur, I should not have dared attempt this; but he is a friend, and maybe will forgive the folly." "What a queer child you are, Carrie," said Helen. "I must not stop another moment now, though I could not resist coming over to tell you my joke." "What a lively girl," said Marie. ' Is she ever SO?             !

We is much respected by his senior friend, though tIat worthy ridicules his con- scientious scruples oftentimes, only in jest, to call out the sentimyentsoftyoung man. Mr. Elliott had long since recovered his health. Emma was successful ink,her endeavors to procure a nurse in the person of Mrs. Harris for Mrs. Emerson, whose gratitude was most feelingly expressed to Miss Elliott, whose acquaintance she had made. Mr. Elliott's philanthropic friend was a constant visitor at his house. He always came with a mis- sionary spirit to see Emma; nevertheless, Henry, good youth, found himself better pleased when his visits were less frequent. He was a well-looking man in the prime of life;- he had called at Elmwood that day, and Emma ac- companied him when he took his departure. "Where have you been, dear " asked Mr. Elliott. "Mr. Ellis called here this morning and told me such a harrowing tale. Dr. Jackson and himself were eye-witnesses to the same. Shall I repeat it, and then tell you where I went?" "Certainly," said her father.   HELEN AND EMMA.       263 "In the lower part of our town near by the willow- swamp, there are several rude shantees inhabited by poor laborers. Some of these are a quarter, and others half a mile apart. The doctor called at Patrick Roby's to see his wife, who is ill with fever. She told him this story :- "' Doctor, if you are going on farther, you'd better stop at Jack O'Hara's, and see if all is right there. Ellen has not been to the house,for a day or two. She always- came to get potatoes and oatmeal, and paid daily for what she had. The last time she was here, she said, ' her father had not- been at home for two nights, and her mother was sick so she had to lie down and could not do anything, so she guessed she must be runninig home to mind the childer.' Ellen is only ten years old herself, but is a good girl, and her mother a nice person. But they are dreadful poor, doctor! Pat says, 'Jack O'Hara has got into his ola ways again, after the drink, and often forgets himself and never goes home a wee-bit, when he thinks he's there all the time.' Then his wife takes on bitterly, and often she and the childer have nothing for a day to eat that could be called dacent food, letting alone the cold and rain, that come in upon them when it storms. The doctor called at Mrs. O'Hara's, and knocked for admission. No one answered. He opened the door and such a scene, sir! He says it en- tirely overcame him for the moment. A few rough boards covered part of the floor, where it had given way. A ragged straw bed lay upon some timbers to support it. The first sight which met the doctor's eye, was that of two little blue shivering forms nestled  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7224-00000135"/> 26Bi4:     ELMWOOD, --RO up together in a kind of pen, which in all probability was meant for a safeguard to prevent danger. One, a child just beginning to creep, and one could walk by the ald of holding on to some support. These babies were lying down together, and the younger had her sister's little hand up to her mouth, vainly seeking to find nourishment from its source. The other was lying still, with its eyes vacantly open; an old coat was thrown over them. Strange as it was, neither of these infants uttered a sound as the doctor entered, appearing as if all strength had left their poor little frames. The warmth imparted by their lying so close together was. all that sustained their feeble existence. The doctor removed his eyes to gaze on another heart-rending scene. On the straw lay the mother cold as ice, for she slept the sleep of death. Across her feet was the poor Ellen, seemingly dead, also. She had fainted suddenly away from crying and exhaustion, for her face bore the traces of tears. She was cold and still. Solemnn silence seemed to pervade the scene. Just as the doctor was trying to act, which his shattered sensibilities had as yet pre- vented, Mr. Ellis went into the door which the former had left ajar. He stood amazed! ' What desolation," said he, ' God forgive us! Here in our very midst, in this beautiful town, prosperous with the productions of the soil, is death by starvation. It must have been so, I fear. And I came as the bearer of evil tidings, and to offer aid if possible. This poor woman's hus- band was run over by a train of freight cars, and instantly killed. He was intoxicated, and had fallen asleep uponl the track as he was endeavoring to reach /   HELEN AND EMMA.      265 his home. She is spared this sorrow. But there is life yet to be taken care of.' Mr.' Ellis took the buf- falo robe from the carriage of the doctor, and wrap- ping it around the babes, placed them carefuilly in the vehicle, and immediately conveyed them to the house of a person who would take good care of them. Meanwhile the doctor used friction and all the means he could command; he was assisted by Mr. Ellis on his return, to restore Ellen to consciousness. She partially recovered; they removed her to Mrs. Roby's, that being the nearest house. When she came to herself, and was relieved from the bewilderment of finding she was in a strange house, and was also sat- isfied concerning her mother- and 'the childer/' she said, with tears streaming down her face, "4 My mother grew so bad, I was afraid to leave her, intirely, to get any food. The childer had the last of the oatmeal yesterday, and there was nothing more at all. Finding my mother did not move, I guessed she was asleep. The childer went to sleep also, and I put the boards there to keep them from crawling away if they should wake up. Then I tried to come to Mrs. Roby, but it was so dark and I felt so tired, that if I went to walk I could not see this way or t'other, and I thought I'd rest a bit, and father would be after coming home and helping all on us, and I guess I fell asleep too, for what I know.' Poor child! watching and hunger had made her faint, and the chill air of the apartment had benumbed her with cold. Her garments were thin and few. Ellen cried and moaned for her parents and the poor childer. T-he doctor told her she must be a good girl, he would see her mother 23  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7224-00000136"/> 266       ELMWOOD--- OR, properly buried, and take care of her and the babies. It was to Mr. Roby's I accompanied Mr. Ellis. I saw Ellen. She is to stay with Dr. Jackson until our plans are matured for our new enterprise, then, dear sir, I hope to have her as a pupil. I next went to the Asylum for Destitute Orphans, and succeeded in get- ting admission for the two little ones. This institu- tion is only for those under ten years of age, and the mere babe has often found a kind home and gentle care in this heavenly charity." "Yours is a sad tale, dear Emma, and you look weary from its effects, my child," said Mr. Elliott. "How much suffering there is that a little care from each one able to give it, might effectually remove. Here is a letter for you from the Osborns, one also for me, requesting you may visit them while- their foreign friends are there. Henry came home to-day from his office, and is even now in pursuit of you." "' Here you 'are at last, Emma," said Henry, coming into the room. "I have been roaming over hill and dale after you. There are invitations for us from the Osborns. Shall you go, Emma, to the city?" "I should like to see Marie, or Lady de Latinee, I should say, Helen has told me so much of her good- ness. But my time is all occupied at present. I wish to get my plans fully organized before we com- mence our tour, for your father is determined upon a journey the coming season; and I hope that the early fall. will enable us to begin our anticipated exertions.' "You might go for a few days to the city, my child. I think you had better do so, as the request is   HELEN AND EMMA.       267 urgent, and in earnest; my old friend Lyle says, 'he cannot be refused."' "If you think best, sir; I will follow my inclination and go." * I will accompany you," said Henry. "You can there see your friends, Mrs. Lee and Miss Waters, who are so delighted with your project." "Mrs. Trent will come in, father, and take my place; what a treasure she is. Adversity seems to have brought out her character in a beautiful manner; it might have remained unknown to her and to us, what traits she did possess, had she not been so afflicted." "Oh, I can get along very well, Emma; I have an engagement, now,! said her father. After Mr. Elliott left, Henry went toward Emma, saying- "Here are some lovely violets -and wood-anemones for you. I found them on the side of the hill, that is the violet-flowers, and the wood-anemone clustered in the shade of the rocks, in the glen beneath. The spring has been so backward and so cold, that the flowers almost trembled with the chilly breath from the North wind blowing." "I was as cold as if it was mid-winter to-day," said Emma. "The piercing blast made me actually shiver." "When the weather is milder, Emma, I shall ask you to go with me and see the sufn set from that gen- tle height; it is a lovely scene from that point. I saw Miss Forrester the other day; she is enthusiastic in regard to wild flowers. I rAust carry her some from  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7224-00000137"/> 268       ELMWOOD, - OR, Elmwood. She is a lovely girl; only a little too fan- ciful. Arthur Mansfield introduced me to her. I should like for you to become acquainted with her. She writes very sweet little verses, and I dare say will give me a few in return for my floral offering." "I remember I have heard you speak several times of her lately. How old may she be, Henry? and what like? . "She is eighteen, and fair as the lily, with dark eyes, and those long lashes that shade and also give such pensive expression to the face. She is niece to the gentleman in whose office I was at first. I have called several times upon her, and found her both fascinating and agreeable.?' "Arthur Mansfield is to be married next week, Henry. I wish I could see Carrie Lee; I would like, once more, to offer her a little sage advice." "Only think of the joke she played on the artist. He went to Mansfield, apparently in. anger, and told him ' his time was too valuable to be so trifled with. And he felt after the fine description given of Miss Lee, it was really unkind to practise such deception.' Mansfield, of course, was perfectly astonished, and demanded his meaning. Seeing Arthur really ap- peared ignorant, he told him, 'he was surprised to find him advocating the cause of amalgamation.' " "'Oh! I see it all,' said Arthur, 'and imagine it was some plot of Carrie's.' He then told the circum- stance of the colored girl's bearing the same name, and his own suppositions regarding the affair, which were very nearly right. In the evening, Arthur car- ried an humble note of apology from Miss Lee to   HELEN AND EMMA.       269 Mr. Drew, which for Mansfield's sake, was accepted. She says, 'this will be her last act of folly.'" "I hope it may be, Henry, and think Arthur might have a more judicious influence over her than her too fond parents. She is a smart girl, and only wants good example and gentle suasion-to make her a useful member of society." "I should not be surprised, Emma, if she never wholly overcame the love for practical joking, it seems to be so very natural to her. Arthur felt a little annoyed at this last act, for Mr. Drew is so peculiarly sensitive." After Emma sought her chamber at night, some wandering thoughts concerning the pretty Miss For- rester passed through her mind. But after all, why should she care? Of course, Henry will marry, and if she is worthy of him, why not Miss Forrester, as well as another?"I ought to rejoice if he is loved," she said, but the pensive air and downcast eye seemed to belie her power of joy at such an event. With her usual self-command she endeavored to compose her agitated feelings, and woo the forget- fulness of sleep. How often that agent proves a balm and blessing to weak human nature. 23*  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7224-00000138"/> 270       ELMWOOD,--OR, CHAPTER XLIII. "A MONTH's absence from the counting room, how delightful!" said Mr. Osborn. "What is our pro- posed route?" "I believe, Osborn," replied the young Lord de Latinee, "Helen and Madame D'Arblay are planning for us. At all events, we hope to reach New York to-morrow, and after the sight-seeing is over in that great metropolis and its environs, we can determine whither to proceed next." "It will be so charming to have change of scene," said Helen, " and something to keep one alive. Ex- citement is the food I digest the most easily." "But, dear lelen, mental dyspepsia follows," said Madame D'Arblay; ennui is a symptom of that disease, and melancholy only another-evidence of the ill effects of that high-seasoned brain-dish. Believe me, dear, excitement as a constant diet is deleterious to the strongest mind," "How much sympathy you seem to feel with my violet friend." "Both Marie and myself were delighted with her. She is so prudent, modest, and lovely in form and face. I wish she was to be of our party to-morrow."\ "She accompanies her -friends soon to the White   HELEN AND EMMA.       271 Mountains in New Hampshire.  I hope we may arrange matters so as to meet them there." A few days later we find our friends established in New York,  Mrs. Osborn felt she was in the Paris of America, as she termed that city. Her foreign friends had been extremely pleased with Boston, and the cul- tivated beauty of its suburban towns. The society in which they had mingled betrayed a natural ease and refinement, that is the sure growth of mental culture. Helen had her fashionable friends, who culled the artificial flowers of life, to make up the brilliant bouquet of their existence. Yet the tal- ented andthe excellent also, sought the -hospitable mansion of her father. He was universally esteemed. "I was so satisfied in Boston,"-said Madame D'Arblay, (writing concerning her visit to a friend at home,) " with the affection all classes seem to feel for their favored city; with the warmth they exhibit, claiming as a near relation the place of their birth; their worthy pride of the philanthropy and enterprise of their fellow-citizens; their fine buildings, and the order in their streets. I think it most remarkable in the last particular. The efficacy of the police, re- moving all causes of disturbance with great firmness, yet in the most quiet and unobtrusive manner. The wonderful activity of the firemen, and the great im- provement introduced and adapted by one of their own citizens, a son of the well-known and valued Dr. Channing. Then their Park, or Common as they term it, with surrounding malls, kept very nicely in order, and lined on either side by fine trees.

Their State House is situated gently above the Common, on Beacon Hill. This building is finely located, and appears extremely well from the harbor. We are in New York now. All is very showy and elegant here. The wives and daugh- ters of the millionaires dazzle you with their habili- ments. The street garb is much more elaborate than it is in Boston; variety in color also predominates, whereas, in the latter city you may often see a dress very rich in material, but plain so as to pass unno- ticed, except to the eye of true taste, worn among the wealthiest classes. I am only giving you a few mor- sels now, for I cannot write long, but when I return you may expect my theme for a long while to be in praise of--America. Well, indeed, is the Eagle chosen for their emblem; for it soars aloft on wings of great apparent strength. Its eyrie may one day be most formidable in extent and power." "I am glad you are folding your letter, Madame D'Arblay," said Helen, "for such a scene as I have just witnessed. Hastening from a church-in Broad- way were a young couple, appearing in the greatest agitation. They sprang into a carriage, which was driven in a Jehu-like manner away. I gathered from the by-standers in passing, that it was a runaway match, and the relatives were in pursuit. Just as the knot was tied, a friend of the groom apprized him that danger was at hand, and without farther cere- mony he caught his scarcely made wife by the arm, and desperately departed, whither no person said. The friend remained; to settle the marriage bill, and   HELEN AND EMMA.      273 communicate with the astonished clergyman. The parties were from Boston. They passed so suddenly before my eyes I could not distinguish the bride's face, which was closely veiled.' "Are such things common in your country, Helen?" asked Madame D'Arblay. "No, Madame, it is their rare occurrence that makes it an event. I do want .to know all about them. I have great sympathy with those sort of things, and used to think I should perpetrate some such act myself, but my father was too kind and yielding to give me an opportunity. Now this little romance just enacted will make those two young per- sons quite heroic in the minds of listeners to the' tale, for years to come." "I view the subject quite differently, my dear, but will not force my homely opinions, as you term Miss Elliott's ideas of matters and things, upon you. I think she would better agree with me." "Here is Marie all dressed for the hop, and my toilette not commenced," said Helen. "I am deter- mined to create a sensation to-night, for there are several very handsome Southerners here. There is no- sin in looking well, that is, if one can. Is there, my dear Madame?" "Mr. Osborn did not enjoy quite as much as his wife the realization of her wishes the other night. These said Southerners, with their unreserved man- nets, were endeavoring to render themselves very agreeable to the lady." Helen was by nature a coquette. She loved ad- miration from all .around, and had long sighed for  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7224-00000140"/> 274        ELMWOOD,-- OR, some new conquest to her charms. Not by any means, did Mrs. Osborn for a moment, think of com- promising herself as a wife, or wearying of her hus- band; but excessive vanity called for gratification, and she, at times, abandoned herself to its folly. It is an undeniable fact, that some women not only receive, but demand as their right, admiration from the other sex. And there are those who will deign to allure this homage to themselves, by studying the most attractive garb and assuming it. There is a weak point in perhaps their otherwise estimable char- acters, that seeks this attention as a necessity, and coquetry seems inherent in their natures. There are other women who shrink timidly from observation, avoiding all that would designate or in- dividualize them in dress or manner, and really are most too frigidly insensible of any satisfaction from the praise of men.  Total indifference is almost as reprehensible as coquetry, but a nice distinction be- tween these extremes is the most desirable.              .   ,   HELEN AND EMMA.      275 CHAPTER XLIV. "EVERYTHNG is now arranged; Mrs. Howard, and the middle of September we hope to commence our labors," said Miss Elliott. "I am so glad to hear it. Why is it that this thing has not been thought of before? We house- keepers have suffered so much. I am sure I have been made sick oftentimes by the trouble concerning my domestics. Here is Mrs. Ashey, coming to your door.", "Miss Elliott," said Mrs. Ashey, coming in quite excited, so I hear you are to be a public benefac- tress. I have come to put my name on your list of subscribers, and also to hear everything concerning your arrangements from yourself." "Do you expect to succeed?  "Not in a moment, my dear Madam, but we hope patience and perseverance will bring about the de- sired end. I pray that it may. These servants, or help, I would say if I could; but mine have proved anything but help to me, for they have been the tor- ment of my married life. There's my cook; I have given her two dollars a week, and I keep two other girls beside, and our family consists only of four per- sons. Why, that cook has broken three seventy-cent  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7224-00000141"/> 276      ELMWOOD,- OR, pudding dishes, four large pitchers, ten pie plates and the handles off of three butter-boats, during the last six weeks, to say nothing of the dishes she has cracked. I would not keep her a moment, for she is very important in her opinions, but my husband is somewhat of an epicure, and she does cook finely. But she will do-as she chooses, and if interfered with she gives the emphasis of her anger to the dishes, that she fears to give in her spoken words to me. Then Sally, the chambermaid, truly, that girl has been out almost every night since she lived with me, and the parlor girl is also a regular gadder." "You are unfortunate, Mrs. Ashey. Do you not have some system as regards your domestics?" "System, my dear. With the present race of ser- vants, rules are unheard of. It must be as they please, they must be accommodated, or they will leave. So I try to live along, anyhow. I always tell a new girl when I engage her what I expect her to do, and she promises faithfully to fulfil the same. Yet she only waits a few days before she does what it pleases her, and leaves the rest undone. I cannot follow them up every day, so I let things go. Oh! it is the greatest trial in housekeeping. What has been your experi- ence, Mrs. Howard?" "Similar to your own in some respects. But the falsity I have had to encounter has been my trouble. I cannot believe a word girls say now-a-days. I had a nurse who took charge of my liffte Jeannie. Every pleasant day I wanted the child carried out to walk up in the Mall or Common, to breathe the pure air, as she is feeble, I thought it might benefit her. Mar- ,    HELEN AND EMMA.      2" garet seemed very willing to do this. Day after day, when I hoped my little invalid was gaining strength, she was carried into a close heated room belonging to a friend of the girl's in Broad Street, breathing the impure atmosphere that a cooking stove and the sur- roundings gave to the apartment. No wonder my darling caused us so- much anxiety, for she pined daily, and we were obliged to come out here for a season. She is now bright and well. I discovered this information concerning Margaret all by chance, but found out for a fact that course had been her usual practice." "Oh! I never pretend to believe what girls say, Mrs. Howard. If they are only honest I can manage some way," said Mrs. Ashey. "Why, Madam, you cannot consider them honest if they are so untrue as to deceive," said Emma. "No dear, not in our nice sense of the word. But I mean when they come to cut up your sheets to make under-garments, and pilfer your handkerchiefs, night-caps, and hose for their own use, declaring when asked, 'they never saw such things,' you per- chance discover the same in their trunks. It is enough to wear out the patience of Job." "It is a sad thing truly, Mrs. Ashey. The greatest difficulty I have had in my experience has been through the ignorance of domestics. My girls have been generally willing, but incapable until I have taught them what I think the right way. Such mis- takes as boiling the tops of radishes for greens, and throwing away the root. I told a new cook one day to boil some squash for puddings and masl it through 24 - ,     W  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7224-00000142"/> 27-8      ELMWOOD, - OR, a sieve, and I would attend to the seasoning and pastry. When I went to look at the squash, I found the hard part alone remaining, she had thrown away all that had passed through the sieve. One of the funniest things happened while I was at our neigh- bor's, Mrs. Brent's. She had a new waiting-girl, and our family only were there at tea. She sent Bridget for some crackers after we were seated at table. "Crackers, Ma'am? asked Bridget. "Yes, take this waiter, and bring them up.' "The girl stopped a moment, looking confused. She shortly returned with four flat-irons upon the waiter, and handed them to Mrs. Brent, who at first seemed not to comprehend the matter. " What are these for, Bridget,' she asked. "'Ye's told me to git 'em ye'self, Ma'am. It was crackers ye were arther, and it's crackers ye've got, surely. And I thought they were queer things for supper.' 1"After dismissing the girl, and sending one of the children for the article wanted, we all had a hearty laugh at the girl's expense, and the idea of the indi- gestible food she had offered." "That was a hard joke, truly, Miss Elliott," said Mrs. Ashey. 4 I could talk at least a month upon this subject, and tell sad tales of disaster these ser- vants have caused; the trouble they have made, re- vealing family secrets, and telling tales from one house to another and the like. But to-day I came on pur- pose to see your subscription list, and to hear how we poor housekeepers are going to have the blessed light of a new era shine upon us. Mrs. Howard, do excuse me. I suppose you already know about it." s           .        ['-c   HELEN AND EMMA.       279 "As regards Miss Elliotts general plans, but I would be delighted to hear her particularize."9 "Here is. the subscription list. Not a lady has re- fused her name. I was in the city several days last week, and every one to whom    I applied seemed pleased, each offering to give yearly what they could afford. You will see the sums set down by their names. So we shall have sufficient funds the first year for all we need to make the attempt.", " Now we will be quiet as two listening women can be, if you will favor u's, Miss Elliott.?' "Hearing so many of my friends complaining in similar manner to yourselves, and finding this subject of help one generally introduced as a topic of trial and regret, I have often wondered if some means could not be found to remove the cause of this getting to be great calamity, rendering the families of many households wretched and confused. I think the mis- tresses have- much to do themselves in this concern, and oftentimes add by their want of system, energy, and    perhaps want of ability, to their difficulties. Feeling a necessity of change in these affairs, I con. sulted with Mr. Elliott, who' with his usual excellent judgment and benevolence, aided and advised with me. We then introduced our subject to the philan- thropic Mr. Ellis, and formed a  committee, adding three other ladies thereto, much older than myself, whose characters and experience in life made them most valuable acquisitions. Together we counselled, and this is the result. Mr. Elliot gave us a large build- ing which he owned in the city;  He had it fitted up nicely for our purpose at his own expense. Our ob-  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7224-00000143"/> 280       ELMWOOD, --OR, ject is, to establish a School for Domestics, where the various branches of female labor may be taught. To have our system regular, those acting as teachers will confer together and advise, that each may pursue the same course in manner and matter, in their instruc- tion. We prefer to take the young and inexperienced. "There will be a department for those intending to act in the capacity of cooks, where that division will be faithfully attended to. The best receipts for pre- paring food will be given, and domestic economy taught, which, while it does not spoil by over-saving- ness, avoids that extra waste of means that is often expended in our most worthy families;- a careful use of the utensils needed in preparing food, the ne- cessity of keeping them clean, and the easier way of cleaning them immediately after they have been used; the great advantage of having a place for everything. These, and various other minor points, form their daily lessons. Common articles of food are to be purchased and the practical part of preparing food is to be done by turns. What they do not use of this is to be distributed among the poor. As they pro- gress in this art, we shall take orders from friends, and prepare food in the nicest manner for small com- pensation. "The next department is that of the chambermaid, where her duties, with all the neatness and order re- quired, will be enforced. The waiting and parlor girl follow this. "The nurse, the seamstress, and the lady's maid, form the fourth and last division. Besides the instruc- tion connected with their regular duties, there is a   HELEN AND EMMA.       281 large room where they daily meet together, and re- ceive that important knowledge that applies equally well to each individual in their situation as domestics; the true definition of the position in which they stand to their employers; that they engage to serve them for wages which they are to receive; that their duty is to be faithful and obedient, respectful to others, and by so doing rendering true respect unto themselves; that their situation will be honorable to them, in so far as they fulfil their duties rightly. I think, Mrs. Howard, that this is an important point. Servants are so apt to forget the relative position of each party, and deem it slavery in them to obey; whereas, they are only carrying out the wishes of another, for which service they are paid." "That is very true, my . ear, but pray proceed,- you see we are all attention." 1"After explaining the above, and leading them to feel there is no degradation (but what is caused by bad conduct on their part), in thus placing themselves under the guidance of others, we would learn them the moral duties incumbent upon them for their own well-being, which we all daily here have need to prac- tise. Truth, which is the basis of all good, must be held immaculate, and honesty and industry will fol- low easily where this heralds the way. The necessity of method in their various labors, saving a vast amount of time. The gentle handling of articles in- trusted to their care. The respect due themselves in the selection of their acquaintances; and lastly, though not by any means the least -the obligation they are individually under to a Superior Being, who 24*'  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7224-00000144"/> 282       ELMWOOD, --OR, cares equally for them, as for those more favored by fortune, whose servants we all are, from the highest unto the lowest. This is but a synopsis after all, as I cannot enter into every particular, my friends. "The cooking department is furnished thoroughly with cooking utensils, that the proper use of each ar- ticle may be taught by practice. A fine range is set in this room, and the meals for the whole establish- ment are here provided. On either side of the halls in the upper part of the building are neat chambers, plainly but thoroughly furnished; these are to be taken care of in the most particular manner by the chambermaids. They are daily reviewed by the lady superintending that branch for the time being. There is a large parlor down stairs where our committee gather, and we receive callers and applicants. This room is under the care of the parlor and waiting girl, whose business is somewhat similar. The waiting is also done by these girls. "There is a nursery, where the nurse can exercise her powers of benevolence, where the children of poor parents or others, can be received for a certain length of time, and the best possible care taken of them. "The sewing of the establishment will be performed by the seamstresses. "In addition to these distinct classes, there will be the very important maid of all work, to be cared for. She will go through the different divisions by degrees -and any wishing the privilege will be allowed the same, of learning one or two branches, or-all if they can spare time, that is proposed to be taught. There is a large wash-room, where the washing, clear-   HELEN AND- EMMA.      283 starching and ironing is to be done. Every member takes her turn at this work, until able to perform in the nicest manner. "The-inmates of our establishment are not to go / out without leave, and the general rules of a private family are to be observed, to give them the habits of regularity. Disobedience to these rules, want of moral principle, or ill conduct in any form, subjects the offender to immediate discharge from the institu- tion." "Allow me to ask, Miss Elliott," said Mrs. Ashey, (" if you admit colored help?" "We intend to. Some of the very best servants I ever saw are among that class. Each chamber is oc- cupied by two inmates, but if these individuals were not equally divided, and preferred to be by themselves, matters could be arranged to make it pleasant to all parties. The girls or women when first received, must, if possible, bring a certificate of good moral character from some responsible person. If totally unable to do that, they must faithfully determine to have a good character formed, and engage to do all in their power to accomplish that purpose. If they can, they are to pay a small sum weekly for their board and advantages. Those wholly dependant are. to be received on condition, that they labor a certain length of time gratis, in the families of those aiding the institution, selected for them by the committee. You saw by the preamble heading the subscription list, that each lady subscribing had a right to call at this establishment and be supplied with help gratis, when we could- answer their demand. The funds  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7224-00000145"/> 284       ELMWOOD, - OR, from their very generous hands are devoted to the interests and expenses we incur, which must, at first, necessarily amount to considerable. Three months is the shortest time we receive an applicant for, unless an unusual case occurs, where we make an exception. We have already eleven paying women, from twenty- five to thirty years of age engaged, when our labors commence. These individuals pay from fifty to sixty-two cents a week. Besides these, there are quite a number of applicants among Irish girls, ex- pecting their sisters from the old country, who offer to pay twenty-five cents weekly from their own wages, to enable their sisters to be taught, and for a home for them when they arrive on shore. These girls have heard from their mistresses of our inten- tions, and made numerous applications. We must limit our number this year, until we see if ours is only an ideal or experimental effort; or if it prove a real benefit and blessing to the housekeeping community and their families. "We have a most judicious and experienced resid- ing matron, who is to have the general overseeing of the whole establishment--Mrs. Trent, whom we well know and value. Then Mrs. Thayer, who is also a widow, like Mrs. Trent, is to have the immediate charge of the cooking department. She is not only theoretically, but practically acquainted with this branch and its multiplicity of smaller branches. "Equally judicious has been the selection in each department. Daily one of the committee are to be in attendance." "What particular branch does, Miss Elliott super- intend?" asked Mrs. Howard.   HELEN AND EMMA.       285 "I have chosen my position in the nursery, for I love children and am patient with them. Feeling the most sincere sympathy for the ill and afflicted, I felt the duties of the sick chamber one of the most urgent, and perhaps, least understood, and as I have had some experience in waiting upon others, and felt sadly the need of efficient nurses to aid me, I hope you will not think it vanity in me to say, I chose this, hoping to do some genuine good in that way. That is my section, though I visit every part of the building. "In the leisure hours which the girls have, if they choose, they will be taught reading, writing and sim- ple arithmetic. A room will be provided for this- purpose, where the necessary articles used will be obtained, in readiness for them, and a good common- sense teacher procured. They are requested to attend church on the Sabbath, but are not restricted in their peculiar religious views. But a system of true morality is urged earnestly upon them. "I believe, my friends, I have told you about all I can at present, of our anticipated plans." 4 I am so delighted," said Mrs. Ashey, "I never lis- tened so quietly before, and with so much interest. My husband will be so pleased with this news." "Husbands, generally, I believe," said Mrs. How- ard, " will be equally so. For the trial of servants is a topic they hold in great detestation. When Mr. Howard heard me speaking of this affair to a friend the other evening, he exclaimed--'Oh! I pray it may succeed, it will be the signal triumph for house- keepers of the nineteenth century, for our city, at  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7224-00000146"/> 286       ELMWOOD, -O- 0R, least, if not for the whole State.' He was quite en- thusiastic. It will oblige you, Miss Elliott, to come oftener to the city." ("We propose boarding at one of the hotels during the winter months, more especially for Henry's ac- commodation. We shall, however, keep our house open at Elmwood, and the old servants will remain. Chloe anrd Dinah, that I brought on from the South to be educated as servants, go into our institution at their own desire, and I think they will make fine do- mestics. Mr. Elliott will often wish to be at home on business, thus the house will always be comforta- ble for him, that is why we do not close it entirely." "When do you commence your journey," asked Mrs. Ashey of Miss Elliott. "We go next week to Brattleboro', from thence to the White Mountains in New Hampshire," said Emma.' "It will be a most charming tour, and you abso- lutely need rest. Here is my name on your subscrip- tion list, and I must say, Miss Elliott, I feel great sat- isfaction in adding a small sum to your finances. When my friend Helen Osborn signed, her father happened to be in the room, he signed the paper also, calling himself Miss Blank, which quite amused us." "The Csborns are journeying now with their for- eign 'friend, I believe," said Mrs. Ashey. "Pray tell me how your adopted sister is, the interesting Mathilde D'Allenby?' "I received a letter a few days since; she was well and happy. Her relatives are very fond of her. She is a subscriber to our new undertaking. She said-   HE-LEN AND EMMA.      287  'Oh, could I but come to you as easily as you could to me, I would offer my services for a year in your noble enterprise.' Mathilde is instructing her young cousin for her own amusement. She uses the needle skilfully." "By the by, Miss Elliott," interrupted Mrs. Howard, "is your brother engaged to - that pretty Miss Forres- ter? I meet them often walking around the Common together, and they look so happy." "Henry is not engaged to my knowledge. I have never seen Miss Forrester." "Is it possible? She is quite a belle, and very fas- cinating, for she is well educated and talented. But I must go, for I have made you a long visit." "And I too," said Mrs. Ashey. Both the ladies departed, and our sensible, high- minded patroness of the above great enterprise seated herself on a sofa, and carelessly plucked the leaves from a small tea-rose she had just taken from a bouquet, seemingly forgetful of her occupation, until a dew-drop rested on one of the delicate petals, whiena glistening attracted her attention, and she awoke from her reverie. Henry's gentle hand touched her lightly on the arm. "What a rare state to find you in, Emma; actually musing, like a Lady Listless. I brought you some lovely lilies of the valley, but seeing you have de- stroyed the tea-rose I gave you this morning, I may as well offer them where they will be cherished with better care." ( Forgive me, Henry, I really was not aware of my employment. I have had two friends from the city  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7224-00000147"/> 288       ELMWOOD,-- OR, here most of the morning.

"I shall not think you excuse my seeming unkind- ness if you do not give me those lovely flowers you hold in your hand. They are great favorites of mine - their exquisite perfume won my early love, and they never have lost their power over me." Henry yielded, and at dinner had the satisfaction of seeing these graceful little bell-flowers reclining on the soft dark hair of Emma's head, and a few resting upon her breast, as if assured of protection there. Henry looked and smiled, and both were satisfied.  ,         .   HELEN AND EMMA.      289 CHAPTER XLV. "DID we not have a glorious time last evening?  said Helen Osborn to Lady de Latinee. "It was very pleasant," she replied. "But I do not like this obeisance to my title. The evident ad- miration of Myj Lord, and My Lady, in the abstract; if I may so say, unindividualized. The compliments and invitations we received from entire strangers, who paid those, of course, to our insignificant titles, as they could not in a few moments' intercourse, find aught of value in ourselves." "It is not very common for lords and ladies to mingle in our circles here. Therefore, the apparent homage. But it was from the class called extra-fash- ionables you received these attentions. You know our plans for Thursday eve; it is our last night here. Several gentlemen so urged me to take the lead in the affair, that I gave my consent so to do. I want you, dear Marie, to give me your valuable aid. Say you will. George and Charles have both promised ' heir support. There was only one objection. George wanted to take the part of lover to my ladyship, in the place of my Savannah admirer. I had already bestowed that high honor, and made it all right with my husband, by telling him he could not refuse the   &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7224-00000148"/> 290       ELMWOOD,- OR, mere semblance to another of that which he possessed The evenin g came. For the sake of those who love to cull some of the Flowers of Fancy, we will give a full description. It was, at least, a novel entertainment. The general company assembled in one of the large drawing-rooms; the other room was reserved for those performing for their amusement. A gentleman announced " that a common word in the English language was to be impersonated, and they were requested to reveal its meaning." The curtain then rose. Two young ladies were sitting conversing together after this manner: "I heard it only yesterday, Anna. Is it not a shocking affair? Our village is quite alive." "I cannot believe it,Jetny; Miss Cooper has always been considered so judicious a person." "Nevertheless, it is true. They say she is distract- edly in love with William Minot; and offered him every inducement to break his engagement with Miss Rivers and marry her." "I think there must be some mistake." "No, indeed! for Mrs. Evans' parlor girl said, Mrs. Parker's nurse told her, she had seen Miss Cooper crying over a letter; and Mr. Minot's man-servant brought that very letter to her. Besides, Miss Coop- er's maid said, that Mr. Minot was a great favorite with her lady." "All that may be, and yet Miss Cooper may not feel a-shadow of love for the gentleman?'."   HELEN AND EMMA.       291 "How strange you are! Why, you never believe rumors of this kind. I heard the other day Mr. Ever- ett's wife was so extravagant, he was on the point of failure in business. I suppose you will doubt this, also, but time will tell." "He may fail, and yet his wife be entirely blame- less as to being the cause." "There is one thing I feel certain must be a fact. Mr. and Mrs, Hammond are on the eve of a divorce. They are miserably unhappy. Such different tem- peraments; educated entirely unlike. They already have separate apartments, and never speak, if they can help it, to one another. They say, she is much attached to an officer in the navy. I cannot vouch for that. Still, every one sees their indifference." "I cannot listen to you any longer, Jenny. Do not, I pray you, deserve the odium this verse attaches: "Go then, and search the world all round; And naught so deadly can be found, And that vile, creeping, hateful thing, Whose heart is false- whose tongue a sting." "Slander--slander," was the general outcry.  So it proved to be. The curtain fell, to rise again in a few moments. "A bouquet," said' the manager. "You are to discover the names of the flowers in the emblems presented to you." Most lovely was the group of human flowers before the eye as the curtain rose. In the centre was a lady in rich red damask, with a wreath of red roses upon her head, Next her, in * '  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7224-00000149"/> 292       ELMWOOD, - OR, the softest possible tint of rose-hued white, with the most delicate pink crape, at intervals, ornamenting the dress, and blush roses upon her breast, stood another young girl. At either side of the two were other ladies in rich green robes, one holding sprigs of myrtle in her hands, the other leaves of the fragrant geranium and the sweet-scented verbena. In the foreground, resting on the support of these, was a lovely being robed in purest white; her long hair floating upon her shoulders, in which mazy garb, exquisite day lilies, without a stain on their spotless purity, drooped gracefully. While on her breast, one flower of the same kind laid fondly, as if it harmo- nized with its transient home. A timid looking child, in lapis lazuli hued robe attired, with modest violets ornamenting her person, stood on one side, and a sunny little creature in straw color, with primroses in her hand, occupied the other. Filling up the interstices were two gentlemen kneel- ing, in green robes, one holding upwards heaths, the other heliotropes and pansies. This exquisite bouquet was surrounded by a white ribbon string tied in a bow in front. It was presented as a tableaux. Great enthusiasm followed this, ,s it was finely arranged and executed. .The flowers were all detected. Helen's rose and Marie's lily received full admiration. The next scene was the acting of a proverb. A lady reclined on a rich sofa, in most dejected manner. Her face was pale, her cheeks bore traces of tears. A closed book lay by her side. A friend entered the room.   HELEN AND EMMA.       293 "Do not feel so sad, sister," she said, "he will re- turn before long. I am confident he loves you, and you only. Some important business detains him." "Day after day, Ellen, have I watched for his com- ing, and yet he is absent still. Not one word has he written to me. I am weary of this neglect. Nay, more, dear sister, I am \ill. My heart forebodes evil. Where can Edward be?" "Here! here! at your feet, dear Agnes," said a young man, coming suddenly into the apartment. "Here am I, at last, to plead the cause of my sin- cere affection, and pray forgiveness of my seeming neglect." Had a sunbeam floated fancy-free and rested on the countenance of the desponding maiden, creating there a sudden brilliancy, it could not have outrivalled in brightness the expression now beaming on that face, lit up by the emotion of returned joy, and the expectations of love. The curtain fell. We could distinctly hear,- "Hope deferred maketh the heart *ik ; but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life." This ended the performance. All seemed well pleased, excepting our friend Osborn, who thought the last part of the proverb too well. acted by Helen and her Georgian admirer, - especially, as the pansies or forget-me-nots held in the flower tableaux, were pinned on Helen's breast, and the button-hole of her friend's coat was decorated by a red rose, which he carefully guarded from destruction. The morrow   saw the travelling luggage of our friends reniioved from the hotel, and they upon the 25*  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7224-00000150"/> 294       ELMWOOD, - OR, waters of the, beautiful Hudson, the scenery of whose banks is so varied in grandeur and beauty. The party were charmed with the prospect on either side. "This," said Helen, " is our American Rhine, and the -Rhineland; it seems the fit place for romantic scenes. Mr. McLane, our Georgian friend, regretted exceedingly his inability to accompany us, but he  hoped to meet'us somewhere amid the mountains in New Hampshire." "We leave Albany to-morrow for Saratoga Springs, I believe?" asked Marie. "Yes, thence to Niagara, then to Montreal, and from the latter to Portland, in Maine. We take this peculiar route in order to join our northern friends, if possible, at the Mountains. Mr. Osborn thinks you can visit the principal American cities with equal advantage and more pleasure in the early fall. I anticipate great enjoyment at Sara- toga; there we shall encounter much of the beauty and fashion of our country. I must say, also, I am anxious to hear your opinion, my dear Madame D'Arblay, concerning our unsurpassed cataract of Niagara." "Charles is so much pleased with America and the Americans. I do not. know as he will willingly return to reside in Paris. 'Your husband has quite fascinated mine, I think, dear Helen." "As' long as the sex gives no cause for jealousy, you cannot complain, Marie." "I cannot imagine a wife's feeling jealous of her husband, or vice versa. Where we truly love and   HELEN AND EMMA.      295 esteem, it seems to me impossible, to admit such a thought in our minds." "May you never have cause to think differently, Marie. But pray who comes hither?" - "Mrs.- Arthur Mansfield, at your service. How delighted I am to see you." "This is a surprise, Carrie, and you are really a matronll7  "Demure, as matrons should be," said Carrie. "I have jist left Arthur asleep onthe sofa in our private parlor, with his feet gently bound together by a silk handkerchief. Hearing some one speak of your ar- rival here, I effected this, and locking him safely in, escaped to greet you. I will just run back and release my captive, or come with me, all of you, and witness the scene."- "Run away, alone, you unchanged being," said Helen. In a few moments, Carrie returned with her hus- band, who, after a hearty welcome, informed his friends that the turning of the key in his door dis- turbed his siesta, and he was vainly struggling in his fetters when the rogue came to his aid." "I thought Carrie was going to dispense with jokes after marriage, and become a pattern wife," said Helen. "She is a pattern wife," said the proud young husband, " notwithstanding these little episodes from dignity. She told me the other day, the greatest joke she ever perpetrated was marrying such a funny being as myself, for I never felt annoyed at her peccadilloes, nor forbade her indulgence of them. We leave here  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7224-00000151"/> 296       ELMWOOD, - OR, in the morning for New York, thence to Philadel- phia, Baltimore and Washington." "We also depart, but in another direction. We must see all we can of Albany by moonlight," said Helen.   HELEN AND EMMA.      297 CHAPTER      XLVI. ' Is not Brattleboro' a beautiful town?" - said Henry Elliott. "I should like to remain -a month here, father. I think the patients at the Water Establishments must 'enjoy their lovely locality. How pretty the village looked from Cemetery Hill, and the three mile circle was so varied in beauty. How exceedingly transparent was the water we passed in our ride. I never beheld shadows so dis- tinctly delineated before, excepting in our lovely lake at home, Emma." "How excited you are, Henry; remember, here is an Insane Asylum that is 'so beautifully situated, perhaps you would willingly be placed therein2l ' Well, children, this is a fine country," said Mr. Elliott; " were it not for that ever following moun- tain, I should be delighted'with the other surround- ings. At first, it seemed imposing to me; but it certainly would have the effect of a nightmare upon my mind if I resided here. I should wish to roll it afar, and look on the other side. It seems to enslave one in its too near and constant embrace." "So much for your opinion of Chesterfield Moun- tain, sir," said Henry. "You should have witnessed the fine view from its little eyrie on the summit, as I  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7224-00000152"/> 298      ELMWOOD, --OR, did this morning. It was a charming prospect, sir. Not too elevated to render objects indistinct without the aid of a glass, but yet presenting awide landscape for the eye to revel upon. The Connecticut wound gracefully along, adding much to the view." Progress is the order of the day. Here a glimpse, there a glimpse. A. cursory idea formed of men and things at the best. The morrow saw our travellers passing over the rich soil of the Vermont valley to Bellows Falls. They stopped at the Island House for the remainder of the day and night, enjoying the romantic falls over- hung by the perpendicular Fall-Mountain. The Con- necticut here flowed proudly over the obstructions in its way, leaving its white foam as evidence of its power. The covered bridge across the river, uniting the separate States of Vermont atnd New Hampshire in the close bonds of exchanging interest, both to the traveller and the residents on either side. They were finely accommodated at the Jsland e House, and received kind attention from the very polite host. Onward again next day until they reached Little- ton. Many lofty heights 'vere seen from the cars in transient glimpses. Ascutney, in Windsor, Vermont, deigning to appear now and then through the cloud- capt mist, that wrapt all around in a mantle of drenching rain ere they reached the terminus of the railroad. Notwithstanding the storm, our friends took a coach at Littleton and proceeded to Franconia. Well were they repaid.   HELEN AND EMMA.       299 Their first view of the Franconia Mountains came to them in such a garb of peculiar beauty, as if to award their toilsome coach-ride and its fatigue. The sun had burst through the ebon mass of clouds as if indignant at its barrier, shining with resplendent brightness on the frowning masses around, acknowl- edging its superiority over these lower orders of crea- tion. It clothed the highest peaks of Franconia's imposing chain with welcome smiles, while below them all was yet gloom and darkness. It was a pass- ing lesson, teaching the mind ever to look upward, for the eternal sunlight is still there to brighten our hopes, above all the lesser clouds of earthly sorrow. One after another, as if humbled at the great supe- riority of the sky-monarch, like obedient vassals these dark clouds withdrew, and received in token of appro- bation gifts of varied value. Some a roseate lmantle, others a fawn-colored garb, and again a few revelled in the richness of a bordering of purple and gold. Gently passing away from Sol's kingly arch of blue, they made the heavens a wealth of moving beauty and interest. Under this gorgeous canopy, our trav- ellers first beheld the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Some fleecy clouds stooped to embrace these children of earth, that rear their heads so proudly upward, leaving their misty tears ere they departed; but the sun followed these coquettish wan- derers with rainbows, that soon made them vanish from the sight. Franconia village was now gained. The sun had already bade farewell to the inhabitants there; but our travellers recognized it again and again in their upward ascent.  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7224-00000153"/> 300       ELMWOOD, - ORj But night soon came on in earnest. Night, dark and lonely; and they, the only passengers in the slowly moving, ponderous old vehicle, called the coach. "Now for Robin Hood and his men!" said Henry. ' Every moment I expect some dark form to come from out the woods." '"I think I shall quiet myself into a'nap," said Mr. Elliott, "so be on the watch, boy, and guard your sister well. No cowardice; remember, she is my treasure at least." Emma's blushes were hid by the wing of night, that concealed also the expression upon Henry's face, of wishing he could have occasion to show his bravery for the sake of the dear one by his side. Onward, onward--would it never end? They were descending then, and no spirit of evil had ap- peared, saving the one lodged in the coachman's companion, who was revelling in the first effects of an intoxicating draught, and thought himself the wealthiest man alive. At last, as if by magic, they came upon an exten- sive building, brilliantly lighted. Mr. Elliott awoke, and thought, at first, it was fairy-land, or a dream - but the cold air soon convinced him that it was reality indeed. Henry had wrapped his cloak around Emma the last few miles, protecting her, at least in one sense, from ill. They entered a receiving room, where an immense fire burned right merrily; it was a joyous sight to the weary travellers, for it was then between the hours of nine and ten at night, that they arrived at the Profile House.   HELEN AND EMMA.       301 We gave, a minute description of our friends' first view of the Mountains, on account of the uncommon appearance the circumstances narrated invested them with. "Did you observe that extremely lovely young girl in the cars?" asked Henry of Emma the following morning. "I did so; she remained at Littleton." "Is not that the party she was'with, alighting now on the piazza?" asked Mr. Elliott. "Even so, sir. We shall see the sweet face again. Now, Ernrma, for the ' Old Man' of the Mountains."'. A fine view was obtained of this profile, which more than answered their anticipations. Echo Lake was next visited, " and the mountain fairies," as Emma said, only answered her in mock- ery, repeating her own words, refusing a thought of their own in return." After dinner several open wagons, with two or four horses attached, took-a party of forty-five to the Basin, Pool, and Flume. These objects are so well known, and so oft rehearsed in the journals of travellers, we will only say they caused great delight to our friends. The curious old man, especially, amused them much. He had established himself in a temporary home at the Pool, where, under a protective awning, he gave birth to his one idea; giving each person-that approached him a like wordy-daguerreotype of his phantasy. He, in return, expected a few pennies, as -he-had colored glasses enabling the spectators to see also, through an illusive medium. Thus, his fancy was good bank stock to him, and his speculation 26  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7224-00000154"/> 302       ELMWOOD, -- OR, brought him an overplus interest for his feeble outlay. He was a noble specimen of a New Hampshire Yan- kee, who, if report speaks correctly, often -made from eight to ten dollars per day during the visiting season. Sunshine or storm, he was always there; not a whit differing in his ideality. Mosses, lichens, and leaves were gathered care- fully by the travellers as mementoes of the wonders of Franconia- Notch, and its never-to-be-forgotten scenes. "How did the Mountains affect you, Emma,'when you first came from the house this morning?" asked Henry. "I felt humiliated in regard to my former knowl- edge, realizing more than ever the majesty of creation. Here in this little breathing-gap of open space, hem- med in on every side, obliged to look directly upward for the light of Heaven, I felt significantly the imme- diate presence of God -His greatness-- His power on' all sides - and His deep unfathomable love speaking out from the clear blue sky, arching over us, promis- ing gentle protection in its serene calmness. What a text these wonders of creation must be for the infidel- to comment upon." ' "Strange as it may be, Emma, I must say the feel- ings I experienced were similar to your own. These scenes awoke powerful emotions in my breast. I shall be sorry to' leave, yet to-morrow we bid farewell to Franconia, and go round to the White Mountain Notch." - "I have learned the name of your little beauty in the cars," said Mr. Elliott to Henry. "She is to be   HELEN AND EMMA.       303 our travelling companion, as her friends proceed in the coach with us to Gibbs's." "Ah!" said Henry, with animation. "Who may she be?" "She is the daughter of Colonel ----, who has lately returned from California with his friend, who is also of the party, with his wife. Another fair girl, with a widowed mother, and a poet, comprise their party. So we shall have charming company." "You think, sir," said Henry, l" we shall be favored with the prose of California life, and the poetry of female loveliness, as well as the fancy from a poet's imaginative brain. These to beguile us, and the novelty of the scenery anticipated in our morning journey, lead us to expect much. Emma and myself intend sitting outside, that we may not lose an iota of what may be seen." "I knew that fine looking man was the father of that sweet girl," said Emma, " she hung so fondly upon him. He is a widower, you say; what a treas- ure she must be to his heart. She is so childlike, so unconscious of her attractions; it is that which ren- ders her so irresistibly lovely. I wished to clasp her in my arms, as a sweet sister in my affections. She looks delicate, her fragile form seemed like the grace- ful ivy, clinging round the noble strength of the oak; for the form of her father gives evidence of power and energy." The next day's travel carried our friends to the White Mountain Notch. They passed various ob- jects of interest on the road, enjoying their new ac- quaintances,' and refreshing themselves from the little  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7224-00000155"/> 304       ELMWOOD, - OR, birch baskets of various kinds of fruit, and the like, handed to the coach by children coming out from rude shantees by the way-side. The time passed delightfully. Here, Mount Washington, the monarch of the whole range, first greeted their gaze. Here, also, aspiring subjects were around on every side. The narrow road down the White Mountain Notch creates a feeling of terror in the young and timid, So chaotic is the view on one side, as if the fallen ones, banished from their high estate, had here met, and in their wrath hurled the trees from their roots, dashing them frantically in all directions, separating also huge fragments of rocks, venting their first wtith- ering rage on the inanimate works of nature, their deeds remaining, as fearful evidences of the scathing power of revenge. Soon relieving both eye and mind, comes most mu- sically down the foaming waters of the "Silver Cas- cade," thrilling the ear with that exquisite clearness of melody, proceeding only from the sight and sound of water, falling over impediments from a great height. Eight hundred feet above does the mountain fairy send forth, her joyousness in the silvery stream, in ac- knowledgment of the unsurpassed beauty of natural scenery. The infant Saco also finds its nativity in this mountain notch, and remains here in apparent feeble- ness; a tiny streamlet still, as if forgetful of its length and increasing breadth, its beauty and its power. Would that we could so vividly retain the youthful   HELEN AND EMMA.       305 period of our lives, as we follow down the stream of time; but memory only, with its misty remembrances, recognizes the past for us. The Willey house with its interesting reminis. cences, heightened a little by the peculiarly interested views of the present proprietor, were not forgotten. The grave of the unfortunate family received addi- tional aid to its height, from the stones individually placed upon it by our friends. Some of the party ascended Mount Willard. A return to the hotel for the night ended the activities of the day. Yet an event occurred, just at eve, that must even here be related in full. Our party were attracted to the piazza by the an- nouncement, that those who left in the morning for the purpose of ascending Mount Washington had returned home. The ponies looked weary and worn, and were taken directly to the stables, where the kindest care was bestowed upon them. But the party! Two ladies were weeping bitterly, and wringing their benumbed hands with great agi- tation. The gallant Colonel of our party immediately gave them brandy, which soon, in a measure restored them, while his little daughter, like a ministering angel; hung around them  with, trembling interest. When they could speak, they earnestly besought our friends not to attempt the task, they had with so much difficulty accomplished.  Most woe-begone looking objects were they, with coarse green flannel jackets on their slender forms, and gipsey hats bound tightly down with handkerchiefs upon their heads. 26*  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7224-00000156"/> 306       ELMWOOD,-- OR, Laughing and crying alternately, they addressed the fair, dignified young lady, who accompanied the Colonel and his party, beseeching her " as she valued her life to give up the ascent of Mount Washington." Miss   calmly replied, " she thought of attempt- ing it on the mogrow, from the Glen-house." "Oh!" continued these ladies, who were, I believe, from the warm clime of the sunny South, "could you but realize our sufferings." "I cried and prayed inl my distress," said one. "I," said the other, " used every demonstration of affection I could command to our guide, calling him, dear man, in most earnest terms; but his heart seemed made of adamant. One gentleman of their party who had crossed and re-crossed the Alps, endeavored to prove this feat one of greater difficulty. The discouragements thus spoken of were greatly to the discomfiture of mine host of the hotel. Sup- per was announced, dispersing the curiously attired -group. Our friends and their new formed acquaintances proceeded on the morrow through the Notch again, and thence onward, not stopping until they reached the Crawford House. Here, as before, at the Profile, in Franconia Notch, also at White's and Gibbs', they inquired for a horn, but alas! they were all lost or broken. Where were the New Hampshire tinkers? Henry promised to send a Yankee peddler soon as he V could find one, on a mountain tour, for. the purpose of supplying the deficiency in this article. Sports- men know well the charm of the Crawford House. The old gentleman is now dead, but the establish- ment is still carried on.   HELEN AND EMMA.      307 Proceeding onward again, crossing and re-crossing the Saco repeatedly, they stopped for a miserable dinner at Jackson, and thence passed over the uneven and rather peculiar jolting; for riding it could not be called, of Pinkney's Grant, stopping to view Glen- Ellis and Crystal Falls, both of which afforded plea- sure to the eye, though differing in character; they reached just at eve the house of the Glen. Comfort- able apartments had just been secured, when Henry, passing through the hall, was joyously greeted by Mr. Osborn and Lord de Latinee. They had arrived the night before, and waited the ascent of Mount Washington, hoping to encounter, as they had done, their friends. The ladies of either party were pleased to meet. Each one had something to relate of the impressions of their experience in journeying. Emma and Henry gave pretty nearly the account we have done, entering more into the minutiae on some topics. Marie was charmed with the route from Portland; and Helen in raptures with her ascent of Kearsarge, in North Conway; for Mr. McLane had joined and accompanied the party to the house, perched so evenly upon the summit of this fine formed, conical- shaped mountain. Madame D'Arblay was eloquent in the praise of the Saco valley; indeed, all of them chimed in the praise of North Conway.  - "From what you have said, Miss Elliott," said Madame D'Arbiay, " and what I have already seen, you have passed the last few days in the excitement  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7224-00000157"/> 308       ELMWOOD,- OR, of grandeur; majesty and power have been mostly in your mind. How sweet then to you will be the ex- quisite -repose of this lovely village, lying like a sleep- ing child upon its mother's breast; the cultivation of its fine soil, so rich- in verdure; the beauty of its woods and trees; the sunshine mirrored in its streams; the graceful gliding of the river Saco, which has won a place in my affectionate remembrance. There was a moral beauty in the spot to me. It seemed to invite the stranger to pure and lofty emo- tions. The White Mountains are seen in the dis- tance, dreamy in their magnitude. Kearsarge, with its even aspect, taking away all terror from the eye, giving varied beauty and interest to the scene. No wonder the artist and the artistic mind, seek here to gather gems and flowers for their studio within. It not only offers food for their daily life, but induces. the imagination to portray its own exquisite ideals, by preserving around them a perpetual harmony of aspect. These very artists, with their white-spread canopies, seated at intervals under the shade of some gnarled oak or lovely elm, add not a little to the pie- turesque effect. Of all the places I have yet seen in America, give me this one for my last resting-place. These were the impressions a few days passed in North Conway left upon my mind." "Well, Mrs. Osborn, said Lord de LatinCe, enter- ing .the apartment, "we have all the best horses engaged for to-morrow." "Delightful!" said Helen. "Are you timid, Em- ma? Fdr pity's sake, tell me if that is not a book under your arm? How it carries me back to Glen-   HELEN AND EMMA.      309 wood and Miss Satisfactory Undertake. But you are following your old fashion." :c That is her 'vade mecurm, her diary. She always carries that to note her thoughts in," replied Henry. '( I would not if I could, and could not if I would, give in writing any thoughts of mine, but Emma always was a philosopher, and a sober matter-of-fact piece of perfection," said Helen. "And I a dreamer, a lover of fancy; culling flowers with and without perfume, attracted by their seeming beauty. Thus my life has been wasted on the fickle desert air, that blew the sands in all directions, leaving everywhere an uneven surface." s"What is to be done about the ponies, ladies?" asked Mr. Osborn. "Jenny Lind, One Eye, and Peter, are considered the best. I think you must draw lots, there are so many of you, for these three. But they assure me at the stables that' the horses are all safe and well trained." "Let us all agree to go in some fantastic garb," said Helen, "it will look so prettily to those remain- ing at the Glen. You koww we must guard ourselves well from cold." "Helen," said her husband, re-entering the room he had left only a moment before, " here is ,another sur- prise for you i'" and forward came a young couple who seemed glad to meet her again. ;t When were you married, Lena? ' "Have you not heard of our affair? I thought it would be a nine days' wonder, and forgotten ever after. We were obliged to resort to a runaway match, and were married at a church in Broadway, New York."  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7224-00000158"/> 310      ELMWOOD, --OR, ("How long since?" interrupted Helen. " Why, if I mistake not, I passed just as you hastily entered your carriage, after the ceremony was over." "Is it possible? Olh! had I1but known a friend was so near at hand; but I saw nothing at the time." "How did this happen? I thought your father was pleased-with your present husband." "He was, and treachery alone blinded him; but the veil is again removed, we are restored to his favor, and return to reside with him after our bridal tour is ' accomplished. A cousin, who had long paid his devoirs openly to me, but secretly to my inheriting property, from my father, returned from sea a short time since, and maddened by jealousy at finding a successful rival in the case, invented a plausible tale concerning my husband of a former forgery, commit- ted by Harry while in Calcutta. This, and various other well-contrived manoeuvres, incensed my father so much that he forbade Harry, without a word of explanation, the house; telling me ' our engagement was forever at an end;' winding up by saying, 'my cousin Edward had returned from sea, and hav- ing long loved me, and proved himself worthy by his attention to business, I might find sincere happiness with him, which an unprincipled man like Harry could never yield to me, as Edward had solicited my hand.' -You know my father is a decided man of business, good in his intentions, but few in his words and firm in his sometimes too hasty decisions. I was astonished and indignant at his communication. I knew, soon as he spoke of my cousin, it was some vile scheme of his. He was ever my dislike from   HELEN AND EMMA.       3" childhood, and ingenious in inventing, even then, plans of evil augury. Harry ywrote me, and I an- swered his letter. He told me 'he could not conceive the cause of the change in my father's conduct. He was not aware of having a living enemy.' I felt this to be true. He was esteemed and loved. You know I am a wayward, impulsive creature, and have been long left to my own guidance. ,I felt and thought only of Harry's situation. I told him I was ready to take the public vows of our union upon me, before God and man, as we were already united in bonds of true affection, which death alone could sever. After some dozen of letters had passed between 'us, and friends of each had offered aid, we departed for New York and were there married. The ceremony was but just over, when Edgar Harold rushed in, and whispered to Harry that my cousin was driving fu- riously up Broadway. We passed him in our coach, but he did not see us as the blinds were closed.. It seems he was -on a different errand from what we thought. Finding we had left together our native place, which information we conveyed in a letter to my father, to be given him a few hours after our de- parture, he felt discovery might be made concerning his perfidy, and thought best to absent himself for a season. My husband demanded in writing an expla- nation from my father, who, as I am his only child, condescended to give the cause for his course of con- duct. Harry easily refuted all charges. My, last let- ter from home conveyed me a check upon one of our city banks for a- most generous sum of moriey, ena- bling us to take with more ease a protracted bridal  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7224-00000159"/> 312       ELMWOOD, -- oK, tour. It gave us also the comforting expectation of a welcome home on our return. Now were Miss Elliott my listener instead of you, dear Helen, she would say -- 4"Though all this has, terminated well, yet you have committed decided wrong. You ran a risk. You overstepped the bounds of delicacy, and like re- markable sayings.' And though all may be very true, and I esteem Miss Elliott sincerely, yet somehow, I am so very happy now, I could only whisper my mis- deeds in a sympathizing ear like your own." i"You are really complimentary to my ladyship, but notwithstanding you think me a sister of folly, I will not quarrel with you now. Do you not see the attention we attract by our tete-a-tete? My husband has -ran off with yours, besides." The party assembled in the morning front of the hotel was grotesque in the extreme. The guides in their rough attire; the ladies with brilliant scarfs or shawls arranged gracefully over their motley garb; the ponies with their varied colored saddle-cloths, all added to the effect. A slight rain had fallen, and the clouds were yet hiding the summit of Mount Washington from the eye. The Glen House is situated at the base of this mountain, and the finest view of this peak is here obtained. Gay as their attire seemed the merry group. Emma Elliott had refused to take one of the best ponies, and took one promiscuously from the assem- bled steeds, having been assured they were all safe. Henry was at her side.   H1ELEN AND EMMA.     313 Mr. Elliott declined the ascent, but gave his son repeated charges concerning the care of Emma, which were entirely needless. The good man saw the evi- dent admiration with which his son ever followed that fair girl, yet he, with true good sense, would not always appear too obtrusive in his knowledge. After the party were all ready, they stopped in front of the house and gave three parting cheers, which their friends that remained returned. The Colonel's lovely daughter leant caressingly on her father's arm, and the rich light sparkling from her 'dark eyes animated the beholder with its joy-wishing expression. Her father seemed her idol, and with him she was content; it was a beautiful picture both to the eye and heart. Her friend was of the eques- trian party, adding much by her lady-like demeanor and refined conversation to the general enjoyment. Her guardian accompanied her; he was full of viva- city and ready-humor, and proved-a universal favorite. His wife did not join our friends, but remained with her oister at the Glen. The first part of the ascent was unpoetical enough, for the heavy rains had caused a depth of water in some places that soiled the garments sadly, as the ponies waded unheeding through. But song and jest filled the air with merriment, and upward, upward they progressed, until the half- way house was reached. Helen here dismounted, assisted by her husband and Mr. McLarie, who had followed her closely during the ascent. The ladies had promised to be courageous, and so far all had gone well. Somehow, unknown to any 27   &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7224-00000160"/> O14       ELMWOOD ,-OR, -one, but as is often the case in such places, there had joined this select party one of those " hale fellow, well met" individuals, honest enough in intention, yet unrefined in expression, affording a kind of amuse- ment to the group. He seemed particularly pleased with the pretty Miss  of the Colonel's travelling party, and was ever at hand when her pony stopped to quench his thirst, as they often do in the many little streams and springs nature has so kindly fur- fiished amid the mountains. "Halloa! there!" was a favorite expression of this hero. "Why, you are all thick as peas in a pod!. By jingo!" said he, addressing- his chosen fair one, "I thought you'd,.have pitched over your pony. I de- clare, it is'nt small potatoes to go up this ere hill any- hoW. Is it now?" One may imagine the sensation such language created in the refined mind of the delicate girl.. Yet -there was something so original in his manner-of ex- pressing himself, and he was so honest and harmless a specimen of his species, that it provoked alone the risibilities of the party. Henry and Emma Elliott were a little behind the others in their accent. Emma's outside garment be- coming burdensome, she had stopped to remove it. The guides were all far ahead, so they were quite alone in the woody 'part of the mountains; but they allowed, as they had been told to do, the ponies to take their own course, and trusted in their better knowledge of the path before them. "How exciting this is' said Henry. "I have ever   HELEN AND EMMA.       315 desired to make the ascent of a mountain, and this is my first attempt. Are you not expecting a grand view when we reach its summit?" "Yes, Henry, but we must prepare for disappoint- ment. Do you not see the clouds gathering closely together? Though there is sunshine below, there is certainly a curtain of mist before." "Here we have the lights and shadows of life around us; I hope we may find sunshine when we gain the mountain's height. Here, Emma, are some beautiful leaves, take these; for soon we shall have passed all vegetable matter, and pass over the barren soil only." "My pony seems uncommonly thirsty, Henry; he stops to slake his thirst at every brook. He also seems weary, and unfit for the task." "I have observed it, and were not my animal the one he is, I should offer to exchange with you. We must soon come to a stopping-place where we will rest awhile ere we proceed." "This pony is certainly ill," said Emma, on reach- ing the last resting-place, before- coming to the barren ground.  "I had better dismount, Henry, he seems determined to lie down.' Emma had not time to do so before the poor beast sank from utter exhaustion, unceremoniously throw- ing off his slight burden, who had just released her foot from the stirrup. Henry's agitation was so violent, that he lost some of his self-possession- spring from   his own steed, forgetful of all, save the dear one's situation; his pony plodded onward, up the very narrow bridle path, heedless of everything Up       , .l  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7224-00000161"/> 316      .ELMWOOD,-- OR, but the relief from any other burden than himself, to carry forward. Emma was soon released from her unpleasant predicament, but the few words of deep tienderne3ss uttered by Henry did not escape her eau "My beloved! my own dear Emma, speak, are you injured? For Heaven's sake, speak!"This was in- stantly said, almost at the moment the accident oc- curred, anrd the tone and agony of manner were never forgotten by the hearer. They were not uttered as brothers generally speak to the most loved of sisters. There was that indefinable apartness from all else, that characterizes the emotions of a deeper and different love. Emma did not faint. Her first act on being extri- cated-from her position was for the care of her pony. With great exertion Henry made him rise, and then led him to a shady spot, swhere from a little travelling canteen he had about him, he brought water from the spring and laved the poor creature's feet; taking also the saddle from his back, thus leaving him free to repose. "The blood flows from your hand, are you wound- ed, dear Emma," said Henry, anxiously. "4 A slight cut only, from a stone." "Let me bind my handkerchief around it. Ten- derly was that act performed, and the hand even afterwards retained, as if there was healing in that simple process. What are we to do? was now thought of for the first time by Henry, who said- "Why was I so forgetful as to allow my pony to go on without bidding him stop."   HELEN AND EMMA.      31!7 "It is as well so, Henry, for the guides will see him without a rider, and perhaps mount and return for us. How thankful I am the accident was so slight. I am glad my poor beast is released. I think he must have been overtasked. I propose we, try to proceed on foot; they must soon discover our absence." "We might do so, but we may lose the bridle-path, I will go forward a little and see.' Do sit you down gnd rest, Emma. Why, you walk lame. Pray tell nle the extent of your injuries? You said you were not hurt to speak of." "My foot pains me some; I think the ancle may have been sprained. I will use hydropathy for its benefit, as nature offers that remedy alone for my present aid. I will take your canteen, and give it a few spring showers, and then swathe it with a wet bandage with a dry one over it, and all will soon be well., Fortunate that I provided myself so well with garments, for they are useful now. You pioneer a little. By the time you return, I shall have doctored (myself completely." "Relief is coming to us," said Henry, after some minutes' absence. "There are two horsemen descend- Jing the rugged heights. I went beyond the woods, ,where I eould see them winding slowly round the -steep descent." ( Ye hoa! What's in the wind in this quarter?" ,said a rough voice coming suddenly upon our friends, :followed quickly by the guide on Henry's horse. Henry related their disaster. "That is just what I told Tompkins before we set 27*  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7224-00000162"/> t319t;    -ELMWOOD, - OR, out," said the guide, now speaking for the first time. "'That old Joe wan't a fit critter to go up Washington to-day. 'Tis a shame, for Joe's got good spunk, and is a well-dispositioned, kindly beast, and ought to have been better cared arter. He went up yesterday, and arter that old Johnson's boy stole him out of the stable, and went clean down to the Wash-house and back two or three times. I told Tompkins he wouldn't eat his grain. Well, let him stay there, I guess he will not move, or if he does, he'll only go home; he knows the way well enough. Tompkins shall smart for treating this ere dumb beast so. Ill tell the landlord, I promise ye." After this very natural first care for the beast, who was an old acquaintance of the guide's, he hoped the lady was not injured. He said the party stopped on the barren height, that commanded a fine view of the Glen-house, and there missed them, when shortly after seeing Mr. Elliott's horse without a rider, they feared difficulty of some kind had occurred. Several gentlemen proposed returning with the guide, but our Vermont acquaintance having already proceeded to descend, their aid was thought unnecessary. , What a fix we are in! and didn't- you give a scream?" said that personage to Emma, " or go into one of those sudden faints, and you a real city lady? I blow now, but I thought they went a'most dis- tracted at the buzz of a moscheto, and senseless at the sight of a cow in the streets. Wall, if this a'nt worth coming all the way up Mount Washington, to know there are some 'ceptions regarding real ladies not fainting at e'en-a-most their own shadow. Now,   HELEN AND EMMA.      319 I reckon you had better mount my pony here; we will place your saddle on him and fix things snug, and your husband can take his own horse off and on' with me." "Mr. Elliott, you mean. I suppose," interrupted Emma, with a beautiful color animating her face. "Oh! I made a mis-guess then, perhaps, only look- ing ahead a little. Wall! that's no concarn of mine. Howsoever, let's follow on. I guess we ha'nt much time to waste, for a great drop of rain on my hand told me what to expect sooner or later." Our friends went on fast as possible in the proposed t manner. The chilly atmosphere soon enveloped them with its shivering acknowledgment. Henry replaced Emma's cloak, wrapping it closely around her, A hasty hail-storm followed next, the pearly stones of which jeweled the rims of the gentlemen's felt riding hats. This added, at least, variety to the scene. It was soon over; a passing gleam of sunshine betrayed all at once to them the great height already gained- a bend in their course enabled them to' look down, and for a moment, Emma trembled at the giddiness the first glance gave. Even then she could just distinguish the Glen House, from its situation looking like a tiny snow- flake. Rivers in- the far distance, with the sunbeam kissing their surface, seemed like slight silver threads winding hither and thither. The lofty trees and thick woods appeared almost even with the ground of the Glen.. Mountains -were on every side, many of them looking like infants compared to the present one now holding them as hostages. Some sister mountains  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7224-00000163"/> 320      ELMWOOD, -- OR, towered around. Large towns and villages seemed like fragmentary Lilliputian attempts gathered to- gether, resembling little groups of white dots upon a' dark surface. This view was only revealed to them a few moments, the sunbeam vanished, and again the misty mantle fell on all around, and sombre indeed was the scene. Our little party could scarcely distinguish one another, but still the ponies plodded up and on. At length, benumbed with cold and weary with fatigue, the cheery sound of human voices came gladly to their ears, and the guide announced the summit of Mount Washington,-the end of the journey was accomplished. Our Vermont friend, who had appeared quite thoughtful the latter part of the way, alighted and rushed into the house, proclaiming the safe arrival of those detained, giving the cause wherefore; then speedily rushing out again " in time," as he said, " to lead in the live heroine of the day." All clustered around the newly arrived, and Emma really needed their attention; the cold and dampness had increased her lameness, and she was actually obliged to limp in her attempts to walk. Henry was all-devoted, which did not escape the eyes of Ver- mont, who knocked the elbow of the astonished maiden, with whom he had seemed so much smitten during the first part of the route, and pointing to Emma and Henry, said- "Don't you read signs in stormy weather?  "I do not understand you, sir," said Miss --, withdrawing herself a little distance, fearing another attack upon her arm.   HELEN AND EMMA.       321 "La, now! can't you see without glasses?" "Certainly, sir, I have never had occasion to use them. I am not near-sighted." , "Wall!. anyhow, you know what sheep's eyes are?"     .       ' "Yes, sir, I have seen them often in the sheep's head." "I reckon I've seen them in other heads besides; and mighty speaking things they are too when they're. cast in the right direction. But as you don't seem to know much, I must e'en speak out plainly. That ere youring fellow there is, most ready to make a fool of himself,' he is so clean-smashed with love for that real nice-looking, wrell-made, sensible young lady, that d never cried or fainted when she'd got upset." ' Mr. Elliott and Miss Emma are brother and sister, I understand, sir." "'Whew! I'll never believe a bit on't, not by a good chalk! I'll find out the truth, or Jack Stormers will give up his guess." Dinner was served in a neat and orderly manner, and even the dessert was not forgotten. Gloomn still reigned without, though regret was in each heart at the disappointment, yet the merry life within doors was shared by all. Pieces of rocks and small stones were received by our friends from the urbane host of this eyrie-home. After remaining long as possible, permitting their descent before sunset, they again mounted and began their homeward jaunt, which they found much more difficult than the ascent.

Emma was mounted on the horse of the Ver- monter, Jack Stormers; and Henry insisted upon his taking his own in return, feeling already under obli- gations to him for his kind services. What was Henry's surprise on reaching the spot, to find Old Joe standing patiently where he had left him, as if he had rested and arisen, awaiting his re. turn. The guides placed the saddle upon his back; Henry refusing to mount him they led him safely home. After a couple of hours' ride the mist rolled away, and sunshine lit their path with its joyousness, but the thick umbrage which they had entered, prevented their seeing aught but its dancing rays, giving the green moss the most exquisite of emerald hues, and- rendering the scarlet of the maple brilliant in the extreme. "We will go home in fine style," said Mrs. Osborn, "with gay cheers and wonders such as mortals never. heard of before. Emma's accident will help us to a scene. The party were gladly welcomed back to the Glen. The ladies finely complimented by the gentlemen and guides, for they were the only party ascending Mount Washington that season, where the ladies rode the whole distance down without dismounting. Mr. Jack $tormers received the sincere thanks of Miss Elliott's father; through the means of that cir- cumstance he edged himself into conversation with that gentleman, determined to find out the truth of   HELEN AND EMMA.       323 the relationship between the young lady and her supposed brother. "A reg'lar smart one is that daughter of yourn, sir. She don't look a bit like her brother, though, does she?                     . "There is not much resemblance," replied Mr. Elliott.        - u Pretty near of an age, I reckon." "Henry is a year or two her senior." "Have you been married twice, sir?" "No; I am a widower, my friend." "I guess your son is an oncommon good 'un." "He is one of the best of children." "Mighty fond of his sister, and terrible careful of her. Few such brothers I come across." Mr. Elliott now began to suspect that Henry had inadvertently betrayed himself during the accident. He hesitated if he would or would not enlighten the stranger regarding their real relationship. Instead of feeling angry or annoyed at the man's excessive curi- osity, he was really amused, and remained quiescent, ready to be again catechized. Jack was not bashful, and continued his interroga- tions. A  sudden light seemed to flash through his mind. "Is Mr. Henry your own son, Mr. Elliott?" "Certainly he is, sir." "And is she, arter all, his own sister?" No  answer being made to the last remark, Jack tipped back his chair; rocking, and snapping his fin- gers, he said- s",I've hit the mark at last.- Is Miss Elliott your own daughter?"  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7224-00000165"/> 324      .ELMWOOD, - OR, "- She is my daughter, sir." "But not your own. Whew! I knew it. Jack Stormers knows a thing or two. Now, I'll tell you what, sir, there are such things as good brothers, and loving brothers. But hang me! if ever I saw a brother pick up a sister's glove, kiss it, and place it next his heart, and then button his coat over it. I guess I saw that thing to-day, unknown to the lady, it was too. But I can tell ye, sir, folks don't live in Vermont with their eyes closed, and I hail from there." "The gong sounds for tea," said Mr. Elliott. Now, young man, keep to yourself your last imparted infor- mation, and I will reward you by saying, Miss Elliott is only an adopted daughter of mine. Her delicacy would be hurt should you repeat to others what you have now done to me. She already feels grateful to you; do not disturb that gratitude." "Wall! now, I reckon it onkind of you to hint that Jack Stormers' mouth is to be kept open because his eyes are. I'll show you we Green Mountain boys know when to blart out and when to be dumb. Theres 'my charmer coming. Isn't she a duck?" "Most too graceful inf her movements to be com- pared to that bird." I've got to look my last on her to-night, though, for I'm off by daylight; but I must not forget to let her know I've got the right of the story about Miss- , Elliott, anyhow." Off marched the curious stranger. After' tea, he followed Miss  into the drawing-room, greatly to her discomfiture, for she could better endure his man- ti    HELEN AND EMMA.       325 ner in the woods, where we may expect to meet with uncultivated animals, than in the midst of that refined circle to be singled out as a particular friend. This was' too much for her equanimity. Miss Elliott seeing the flushed cheeks of the young girl, addressed Mr. Stormers, attracting his attention to herself, while Miss - endeavored to escape by leaving the apartment, and taking refuge on the piazza, Jaok's eyes followed her, and hastily answer- ing Miss Elliott's question, he pursued and overtook his seemingly victimized acquaintance of a day. "I've. found out all, as slick as can be, and Mr. Elliott is brother to Miss Elliott, and yet she is no more his sister than you be. I reckon I knew it the best." "Then I was misinformed, sir," said Miss --- , rising to return to her private apartment. "No you wasn't, neither, Miss, for Mr. Elliott adopted her-- stop a minute, I want to say good bye, for I'm off early in the morning. If you, or your folks ever come round my way, you'll have a fust-rate welcome; for we have the best of butter, and milk and cheese, and good cattle too. So don't forget old Vermont, or Jack Stormers either." And Jack held -out his coarse red hand, grasping the fragile fingers of the lady as if they possessed the same properties as his own. Miss   did not like to hurt his feelings by refus- ing to shake hands with him, yet she felt the pain of his hearty, honest good bye, many -minutes after he left.

"Lean on my arm; Emma," said Henry; " let me throw this cloak around you, the evening air is so chilly. I wish you to go out on the piazza, for at last I have found a horn."  A description of the mountain echo is almost impossible. It affects the mind to pensiveness and melancholy, the sweetness of the sound reverberating many times, amid the heights, like sister spirits calling to one another in the land of dreams. There is a melodious softness, an abstraction from all other kinds of sounds, that gracefully sinks into the heart, and mingles reverence with its remembrance. It is the true music to come from amid the- Mountains. The early morn .separated the travellers. The Colonel's party passed on to Gorham.

"You seem deeply interested in its success." 6 I am, sir. I feel so much good may be done in this way. There is another school I would like to have established if any one had the courage to com- mence. And that is a school for housekeepers; by those, I mean the mothers and daughters of our com- munity, - teaching them the duties of the heads of families to those in their service; the necessity of' furnishing their kitchens thoroughly with cooking utensils, towels, and all things necessary for the faith- ful performance of the work required of their domes- tics; the duty they also owe these persons regarding their health, nbt requiring too much of them; giving them plenty of wholesome food; their duty as moral X   HELEN AND EMMA.       329 guardians, giving good advice and practising it them- selves, for this class are very observant of what their mistresses do as well a* say; evincing an interest in. them as human beings., Such conduct on the part of employers will induce continued faithfulness in those -employed.

"Oh! sir, the expression I used is common among young ladies who often tell what they would do were they married."

Madame D'ATblay and Marie remained with her a month after the funeral, vainly trying to reconcile the unhappy woman. It was a great trial for Helen; having just passed a season delightful to her, from its constant excitement, so soon to change the scene to one of sorrowful reality, it was too much for her undisciplined mind to bear. So she thought, and she murmured at her wretched lot. , orgetting the many blessings left her, she saw only the cloud that shadowed her at her mother's death, returning redoubled with power to darken her future life. Her husband offered her sincere sympathyy for he well knew the value of that good man, who had now passed from earth. His relatives were very kind to Helen, but she was shut up in herself and all was useless. Madame D';Arblay felt it necessary for her to pre- pare to return to her own country. She had left her   HELEN AND EMMA.       333 brother in New York, and must return there as they sailed from that port. Charles, or Lord de Latinee had been most sincere in his reform. He was a noble young man and wor- thy his wife; more in his praise we could not well say. He had proved, by experience, the misery of a dissipated life, and early had courage to renounce its baneful attractions. He wished to commence some good work of benev- olence, as his property and time fully allowed, and duty as well as pleasure demanded it of him. He had been delighted to see the change in Mr. Osborn's character, the strict attention- he paid to business, and the respect in which he was already held by the business community. He considered him a valuable friend, with whom he was sorry to part. Mrs. Osborn refused to oversee the affairs of her household in any particular, and kept her private apartment several weekls after her father's decease. Mr. Lyle had left Helen the bulk of his property, leaving a few legacies to relatives and friends. Marie endeavored, ere she left Helen, to persuade herl to arouse herself from her condition, and interest herself in some benevolent undertaking, speaking of the great success of Miss Elliott's school. She told Helen of a need she thought her own city might be supplied with, through her influence. "We have," said she, " in Paris an infant asylum; it is there called ' The creche,' the literal meaning of that word is a manger. It is intended as a place of safety for young children, whose parents are obliged to labor daily for their maintenance. These parents  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7224-00000170"/> 334       ELiWOOD, -- OR, pay a very small sum, amounting to a couple of American pennies a day. Their babes are here taken care of in the kindest manner, until they return from work at night, receiving if they wish their little ones again, who greet themn with joy. Cannot you estab- lish something of this kind, dear Helen? You know not how much good you might accomplish. There are so many distressing accidents occurring, (I have read accounts in your papers) whereby the little inno- cent babe loses its life, or is cruelly injured being left alone, or nearly the same thing, in the care of another almost an infant herself. I see a fair field for your exertions in a good cause. You would forget your own sorrow, Helen, and become attached to visiting these little ones in their happy, daily home. You would therein find excitement, (which you say you must have in order to exist,) of the most healthy na- ture. You might,-at first, obtain a large airy room, where the bright sun would shine in and enliven it, and provide several faithful experienced nurses for your services to make the attempt. You and your young friends could share the daily visiting to see if all things went on rightly. Little cradles with neat cradle-clothes must be provided, and clean garments belonging to the institution made for the little ones. The nurses must be required to wash and dress them daily in the most thorough manner, and this must be overseen by the lady managers. For the sake of cleanliness alone, and the improvement made thereby in the health of these little buds of poverty, such an institution should be considered a moral benefit to the city. I would suggest also, that birds to sing,   HELEN AND EMMA.      335 flowers to look at and toys to play with, might be found in this public nursery. Think, Helen, how pleasant it would be for you, to go often into this cheerful room, and see a number of pretty little clean faces peeping from out their nice cradles, smiling and cooing to you in return for your kindness. You would learn to love them and forget yourself. I will be the first donor to the institution, and you shall be the president. Do let us call a meeting of your friends, and arrange affairs at once." Helen listened, for Marie's animated spirit awoke her attention. "It would be so much trouble for me to have such a care, or anything to do with it myself, that I could not think of it," said Helen. "I am willing to give to such a charity, but I could not personally act. Besides, I am not well; I feel a languishment steal- ing over me daily." "That is because you need your energies to be called into exercise. You constantly think of your sorrow, until you become blind to all else but its increasing magnitude. Let some bright rays obtain entrance, and you will again be able to walk out of this despondency and enjoy the beautiful light still shining around you. You are unkind to your hus- band, whom you really love. Remember, he has. long been an orphan himself, and he deeply feels your loss. For his sake you should wear the robe of resigi. ation, and find consolation in his love and sympathy. You render George unhappy now, dear Helen, and if you will not heed my prayer concerning the infant children of poverty, at least wear the smile  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7224-00000171"/> 336      ELMWOOD,  OR, of home with which to welcome your nearest earthly friend. We must leave in the morning, and for the sake of Marie de Latinee's love, forgive her admoni- tions and entreaties. By and by perhaps you will write, telling your success in founding a ' creche' in your beautiful native city." , , *   HELEN AND EMMA.      337 CHAPTER XLIX. "How does our educated nurse suit Mrs. Emer- son, doctor?" "Admirably! She said to me, ' I should think the good girl had been through a siege of neuralgia tor- ture herself. She is the most unobtrusive, yet the kindest person I ever knew.'  "How thankful I am. Do you know, doctor, I had Mrs. Emerson and her delicate system in my mind when this girl came to our establishment. She seemed so young and healthy, and of that peculiar round-kind of disposition, I thought her just qualified for such a situation. Does Mrs. Emerson attend to the hints we suggested, regarding her treatment of Nancy? You know the capability of the girl, and the continuance of her labors depend upon her retain- ing her present soundness of constitution." "Yes; Mrs. Emerson has suffered so much, she would not deprive any one of that inestimable wealth that health brings its owner. Nancy is sent out every day to take the air, and the out-door exercise she requires. She generally takes the opportunity during Mrs. Emerson's hours of-relief. She is a treasure to her mistress." "We have received many satisfactory letters from \            '   &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7224-00000172"/> 338       ELMW0OD, -- OR, patrons, and our school has only been in operation little over a year. Our funds continue to increase. Father is our treasurer. What a charming feeling it is to be successful in what we consider a good under- taking." "Indeed it is, Miss," said the doctor, " and I must give my thanks, verbally, to the fair proposer of this enterprise. You remember Mrs. Dawson, an old neighbor of mine?" "Yes, sir, I have seen her at your house." "( Every other day, so it appeared to me, the good woman came in either to dinner or tea, I for relief,' the said, 'from the sound of broken crockery or quar- relsome servants.' If I mistake not, there were fifty pitchers, four looking-glasses, nearly one hundred cutps and saucers, tumblers, and so forth, broken dur- ing one winter. Hearing the story so often, I may have multiplied the number. At all events, I never saw her gray silk dress and tall slim figure, gliding past my office, without anticipating a crash of some kind; and actually I have heard the sound of broken 'crockery more than once as she approached the house. Tom, Jim or Bill, Bridget, Margaret or Jane, was her everlasting theme; in the agony of a housekeeper, 4those horrid servants' she would condemn. She has not been in more than once or twice the last few months, and when she does come, her knifting needles fly, and her tongue, though seldom given to praise, ceases to blame the domestics of her establish- ment." 4"We have supplied Mrs. Dawson, as she early Subscribed. The girls do not like there, but we   HELEN AND EMMA. :3Q instruct them to be patient and do their duty, and they may by good deeds on their part overcome the evil in time. There is one lady much more trouble, some than Mrs. Dawson. It is Miss Gripeall. In the first place, her kitchen is most scantily furnished  what there is in it looking as if age had long disabled the articles from use. Secondly, she forgets that persons who labor need good healthy nutriment to subsist upon. She is almost a skeleton in appear- ance, and keeps house for an aged brother. A small bit of meat boiled one day, warmed -over the next, and a soup made of almost nothing the third day, is the general idea of her animal economy. This might serve to sustain life in the two sedentary persons, but for those rising at four in the morning and continually in activity, more substantial food is needed, especially as the vegetable economy partakes the same slender- ness of the former. You know, sir, we approve of true domestic economy, and advocate it boldly' but it is far apart from the littleness of Miss Gripealll' establishment. We do nriot permit the girls to return and enter complaints against their mistresses. There are few that have been dissatisfied, or wished to change. We inquired into Miss Gripeall's particular case; we had been informed of her narrow views regarding the rights of others. We called upon her, telling the rules of the establishment, not changing more than once a  month the help for any one person if they were not suited." "Miss Gripeall has been a  patient of, mine, and well I know her ways.

Strange he need require medicine so often. It is only three months ago I bought a plaster for his back. I suppose your fee won't be much, doctor, as Timothy only needed a small dose of physic.' I know her wrell, Miss Emma, and have some idea of sending her a good round bill with interest, she is so avaricious. She is very well off as regards money. I must not forget my other patients. Dear me! Miss, I had almost forgotten one thing. Mrs. Mansfield sent her love for you, and wished me to ask you (to come in and see her little Carrie;' telling me also to say, ' the first strength she acquired was put in practice by trying her grand-; mother's cap on to the babe, to see how she would look when an old woman.' She is a child-woman herself, and will ever be so I fear. But then she is so benevolent, kind, and loveable, one forgives her folly without knowing it. Good bye, my dear, what fee shall I have for my long visit to you?" "Coffee, if you'll stop, sir, for Judith is just coming with the waiter. I only take, an early lunch to-day, as I am obliged to go into the city before dinner. My friend, Mrs. Osborn, is in such a melancholy state I am going to visit her." Emma found Helen lying on a sofa, with an open novel in her hand. She rose to receive her friend. "I am trying, Emma, to pass away the time in reading. I have actually read every novel I could find in the house; and you are aware I generally de- test reading more than an hour at a time. But I am so lonely; George is at the store when there is not   HELEN AND EMMA.      841 the least necessity of his remaining at that odious place, and I have nobody to amuse me at all." "Is it not your own fault, dear Helen, that you are alone? Have you not refused society of late?" "You know I do not, of course, go into company," answered -Helen. "t But your intimate 'friends 'might be allowed to call and see you. Had you not sent for me, I should have feared a denial myself." ' "I did want to see you, Emma, to know if you could -not find some interesting young person that woulM come and read to me. It makes my eyes ache to read long; and then she might amuse me by telling what is going on in the world around." ," If you are going to employ the person in novel reading merely, I should feel unwilling to recommend a young person, fearing it might injure them. Why do you confine yourself to that style of works?" "I could not endure anything else. They do not require thought, they only brighten up fancy, and are a sort of time-being excitement, that is grateful in any form to me. I want some kind of a female com- panion, not exactly a friend, but one I can pay well, and therefore feel a right to call upon her." "I am afraid, Helen, you would not render such a person's situation very agreeable." "' Why, if I hire her to amuse me, and pay hand- somely, I don't see why it should be an unpleasant task." "You might not be easily amused. May I speak yet plainer to you, dear Helen, and say, I fear you never will be happy until you try to shed some rays 29*  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7224-00000174"/> 342       ELMWOOD, - OR, of happiness yourself on those around you. It is through that medium we alone- derive true enjoy- ment."  "George looks as grave as possible when he comes home, and does nothing but gape and sigh," said Helen. "And what does Helen do?" asked Emma. "Why, I yawn and sigh, and oftener weep." "Let me beseech you, then, turn over a new leaf, and when your husband returns, weary from the busi- ness of the day, welcome him with gentle smiles. Offer to sing him one of your own sweet songs, that he loves so well to hear. You will find greater plea- sure than in all the heartless flattery you received from Mr. McLane. Your husband's joy will fill your heart with renewed gladness." "' It is so much trouble to sing merely to one's hus- band, who has heard you so often. If he praises, it is only in the same old strains, calm and collected. There is no rapture in his manner." "You are a sad woman, Helen, if you allow such thoughts in your heart. A husband's praise should be the most earnest desire of a wife; and it is the very calmness you complain of that makes the praise so valuable, showing it is sincere:--not possessing the exhilaration that flattery induces, which spends itself in intoxicating words, and that is its all. Do Helen, take my advice. I would not employ a com- panion with the views you now have. Exert your- s'elf and your natural talents, and let me know the result of the trial." "I will think of it, Emma, but I fear it will prove   - HELEN AND EMMA.      343 too much of a task. I hope we shall close the house and journey again before long. I am looking forward to that change for relief. Anything but this sad place, which is so dull to me. Meeting with strangers and strange scenes, I may overcome my unhappiness, but not here." "'I think youl are mistaken, Helen. ,Home is the true place to find and make happiness. What have you here to prevent your home being happy. You knew your dear parents, in the common course of nature, would probably precede you in their depart- ure. Your faith should lead you to believe they are happier in their new mission than while on earth. Moreover, that was God's will, and you should be resigned. You have an excellent and fond husband. You are sole mistress of this elegant establishment. You are wealthy on your own account. Your health, though not robust, is good generally. )Do you not see how ungrateful you are, when so many blessings - surround you. Let us see the beauty of Helen's mind bud forth, and be worthy the casement that enshrines it. Come, dear Helen, I shall remain with you to-night purposely, to see that smile for your husband, and hear one sweet song from you again."

I had no idea, Henry, that the prospect was so fine from this hill. See how sweetly the village spires look, and the apparently golden panes of glass in the various dwellings. The dancing light on the tree-tops also. How lovely is it all." "Have I not told you so, Emma, often? Even, when Miss Forrester aided me in its praise, you seemed to doubt, for you would not accompany us in our second excursion." "Oh! I did not doubt, Henry. I have been much occupied of late. How'fast the hours pass away." "Have there not been times when you would bid them stay?" "Could I have had my own way, I might have somnetimes chained them," answered Emma. "  How much better it is for us we cannot have all our wishes gratified." "Do you think so," said Henry, inadvertently-- looking as if he wished, just at that moment, to have all his desires confirmed. "Do you not agree with me? Think how selfish we should be. We should demand everything as our   HELEN AND EMMA.      345 right. There would not be the blessed feeling of gratitude ever in our hearts." "You are, as you always were, Emma, ever in the right." . "No, no, Henry, there you are wrong, but I will not add, always in the wrong." "See this deepening twilight, Emma, does it not steal gently along by our side? It has wrapt the distant hills in its gray hue, and darkened the woods, and sent shadowy angels to cluster around and pro- tect us. I always feel as if sweet spirits were pecu- liarly near us at twilight. If ever I muse, it is then." 1"You are romantic, Henry, too much so for your profession of law." "I have another profession, which, alas! may, per- haps, savor more of romance than reality for me. Let me make it known to you. The moon will soon rise, Emma, and better light our path through the woods. Let us sit on this stile, and await her coming. I have a burden on my heart I have longed to unfold; if you will be the recipient, I will reveal the same to you." Unconsciously Emma's heart beat quickly in her breast. She, not knowing how to speak, was silent. "Years have passed since we first met, dear Emma, when my father placed you, a child, in his home. As you increased in age, ill physical and mental beauty, his love also increased; and he adopted you as the child of his earnest affection. He even openly stated, he should divide his property equally between his heir and yourself.

I saw my father's deep love for you. I never murmured, though I amn his only near relative on earth. I never complained when half my estate was named as your portion of property. I had but one thought, one wish, after meeting you again at Glen- wood; and that was, to share everything with you always. For these last few years I have cherished this proud hope. I never called you sister, though so sweet a name. I was not satisfied with its sound. I whispered my love to you in flowers, and, at times, felt it might be returned. Again, as when the poor tea-rose that I had daily watched to have it open all so beautiful for you, was carelessly shattered on the ground. I felt it emblematic of my :hopes, and tried to look on other hearts with love. But change I found impossible. When you left us for the South, our home lost its sunbeam, and father and I pined in the shade."- "Emma," continued he, taking the hand that did not now resist his own, " may I ever call you by the dearest name on earth? May I whisper what sweet sound would satisfy my ear? 'Twould be to call you wife, dear girl, my wife, forever.",; The moon was slowly rising, her calm light fell upon the serene and happy countenance of the lovely girl, who looked like an afgel of beauty to her enraptured friend. She pointed upward; directly over them was a bright star, watching their pure emotions.   HELEN AND EMMA.      347 Emma smiled, and placed her other hand in his; and both were silent. "Let it be the star of promise, then," said Henry, The moon and the star witnessed this compact of love. Mr. Elliott determined to have a little sport, now the ardent desire of his later years had been successfully accomplished. Having been informed -of the matter by Henry, he spoke to them at breakfast the following morning. "Here has Emma been -blushing away, and hiding her blushes when Henry came. Yet, anxious about him while absent; and nervous (a rare thing for her) when a certain pretty lady, a Miss Forrester, was mentioned, and all that kind of thing; thinking no person could read these heart-emotions, hidden under the garb of delicacy. Here's Master Henry been full of love as well as law; hoping the latter would con- summate the former.

EMMA'S marriage took place a few months after her engagement. It was a most delightful occasion. All present seemed to, feel the true principles on which their affections were based, and knew they might reasonably expect happiness as the result from their union. The- mementoes of love which Emma received were numerous. She had a most affectionate letter from Mathilde D'Allenby, in which she said,- "For a long time, dear Emma, have I been expect- -ing this denouement. I read all -while with you at Elmwood. Receive the best wishes of your adopted sister and her Southern relatives for your increased happiness." Emma had also a most welcome letter from her friend, Helen Osborn, who was unable -to attend, announcing the fact, "that the Flowers bf Fancy were fast fading for her, for she held in her arms a beautiful gem of intrinsic worth, whose reality was to be her future pleasure and care.

The one so brilliant to-day will soon wither and pass-away. Like the Flowers of Fancy Helen culled through life, is the present beauty of this bright bouquet. She offers it now, that its fragrance may silently convey to you the lesson at last received into her heart--' That the grass withereth --the flower fadeth'--'Folly is joy to him that is desti- tute of wisdom' -' but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.' This diamond ring, surrounded by rubies, is typical of the gems of reason that have ever shone from the life and purposes of the beloved Emma, whose example it will be my future study to imitate." If any among our friends have likewise seen the evanescence of the Flowers of Fancy, will they not 'also cultivate those gems which God has implanted in each human breast, whose immortal blossoms are gems of enduring beauty; and through this relation- ship, become sister spirits with our beloved Helen and Emma!
