and the birth of a son to Brigham Young&#xD;
before all the crowned heads of Europe."&#xD;
Mr. Clutchit opened the door, entered&#xD;
and closed it softly.&#xD;
Much descriptive genius need not be&#xD;
wasted in reproducing the picture of the-&#xD;
premises immediately Loccupied  by the&#xD;
Clutchits.&#xD;
The "Hall of Reception " was a square&#xD;
front room on the first floor of a tenement-&#xD;
house. At night, by the sudden turning up&#xD;
of a bed-ounge, it became the sleeping-&#xD;
chamber of the illustrious pair. The, rear'&#xD;
room, into which Mr. Clutchit had just es-&#xD;
caped from the wind, was at once their&#xD;
private parlor, kitchen, and dining-room.&#xD;
. The Clutchits always dined at thefashion-&#xD;
able hour of six, as became people of their&#xD;
aristocratic lineage and pampered appetites.&#xD;
The table was spread for the banquet, the&#xD;
cloth being a copy of an old police Gaete,&#xD;
Mr. Clutchit's tacked plate being placed&#xD;
precisely over a cut representing the arrest&#xD;
of some notorious swindler.&#xD;
Madame Gringo, se Olutchit, was seated&#xD;
awaiting his arrival. She was leisurely nib-&#xD;
bling at a roll and sipping tea from a tin&#xD;
cup.                       -  -  -1&#xD;
The honored husband of the, world-re-&#xD;
nowned Madame threw his hat in a corner&#xD;
and dropped Iiito his chair, prepared to&#xD;
anist her in the demolit on ofa tough beef-&#xD;
steak and rolls.DI&#xD;
"Windy out, Dick I"&#xD;
"Ug I no name for it. It's a searcher.&#xD;
It went through me like a pickpocket&#xD;
through a horse-car."&#xD;
"Dick, I say, people's getting' tired ol&#xD;
knowing what's to happen, and they donl&#xD;
care a fig about what has happened. Nol&#xD;
even a bite yesterday. It's shameful how&#xD;
little people care for their future. Only ont&#xD;
customer the day before, and not over&#xD;
dozen in the whole month. Now, what's t&#xD;
be done?11"-&#xD;
'.'Consult the stars-sign of Taurus ram&#xD;
pant,," said Olutchit.&#xD;
"Hang the stars! What dodge shall w&#xD;
go into to make ourselves safe 1" 1&#xD;
" Gs into the Tombs as impostop% if w&#xD;

" Yes it'll be shut up both the Clutch*&#xD;

"Yes, and his whole kit of brushes and&#xD;
colors, easel and all, But they ain't worth&#xD;
sixpence. I don't wonder he hung himself."&#xD;
I do; but never mind.-Ae didn't know&#xD;
how to make them profitable; I do. There's&#xD;
where the true genis'shows itself."Now&#xD;
then, these rolls are ferfully stale, and so's&#xD;
the butter. The strength of that butter is&#xD;
sufficient to run a saw-milL"    ,&#xD;

with poverty-genius triumphant--defyig&#xD;

botme. If a damp miserable cellar in Pell&#xD;
street, with its, rough- unpliasterd walls&#xD;
through which the moistute oozed, with Ift&#xD;
smoke' begkinmed beams, and'its broken&#xD;
boards which lay loosely upon tht bare&#xD;
ground in mocking- pretense fort -a floor,&#xD;
could by any stretch of the imagination be&#xD;
called a home even for a dog, then it was a&#xD;
hoes for George Jaffray.&#xD;
And for two months, the worst and storm-&#xD;
lest in the year, ever since'they had reached&#xD;
this the lowest step of their degradation,&#xD;
ad George Jaffray and his wife found&#xD;
refuge in this den.&#xD;
Day after day had he tramped the streets&#xD;
hungry and xaggad, each day growing more&#xD;
hopeless anid desperate, each dAy approach-&#xD;
lag-nearer the tnevitkblebitter end.&#xD;
Anotaet dafIi% trap eided, bringing him&#xD;
'ack to his dismal refuge with oaly the&#xD;
mmory of denial and disappointment-&#xD;
'h-e mad wind seemed, as it raved and&#xD;
rhistled past, to mock him in'his despair&#xD;
-hen for the moment he paused in friont-of&#xD;
the building, beneath which awaited his&#xD;
coming the only being in all the wide *ast&#xD;
city who had clung to him.&#xD;
"God help me," he muttered as he de-&#xD;
scended the worn wooden teps leading from&#xD;
the patenxent down to -the tiineiwracked&#xD;
door of the cellar. "1Whylshoild I suffer all&#xD;
this misery IBette die' by tihe haigman's&#xD;
hand than by this slow terrible, torture of&#xD;
starvation I"&#xD;
He pushed open, the door, entered and&#xD;
closed it. For a second or two he stood&#xD;
motionless in the darkness.&#xD;
" Mary 1"0 he called.&#xD;
No answer came. No sound broke that of&#xD;
the awful stillness save that of his own&#xD;
heavy breathing.&#xD;
"Poor soul, she's asleep. The light has&#xD;
burned out-burned out as my life willone'&#xD;
day burn out and be lost in the darkness 'of&#xD;
death."&#xD;
He took a. match from, his pocket, and&#xD;
groped his way to the farther wall.&#xD;
"Mary I" he called again.&#xD;
No answer.&#xD;
a I'll have -a light," he muttered, and&#xD;
struck the match upon his coat sleeve, and&#xD;
&#xD;
as the light fdashed up, it reyeale4 theob.&#xD;

meant of a candle in its neck and staning&#xD;
upon the ileadbf a barre. '&#xD;

His halid, thin, roughliike the hand of a&#xD;
skeleton, with the skin aried aind corrugated&#xD;
over it, trembled with the coid as he apied&#xD;
the match to the wick.&#xD;
"S o  Ican see Iny misery a little plainer.&#xD;
Ax If it were not plain enough already."&#xD;
He lifted ,the battle from the barrel, and&#xD;
turned toward 'what seemed a heap of'rags&#xD;
in the col-ner fariherest from the door."&#xD;
"UghI!' it's colder than a landlord's&#xD;
heart I Ho  that *ind whistles'througy&#xD;
the old door!&#xD;
Nearer the heap of rags, the boards of the&#xD;
floor - creaking 'as he advanced. " Such. a&#xD;
bed as this for the daughter of a henker I&#xD;
Mary!"&#xD;
No sound but that of -his own' voice, ah&#xD;
that of' the wind.&#xD;

of what would be teresult checle hlim.&#xD;
To call others in might cause hiz* to be ar.,&#xD;
rested as the murderer of the. unknown.,&#xD;

HoldI he may not yet be dead. Jaffray&#xD;
bent over the body, and throwing open the&#xD;
coat and vest, placed his hand dver the&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
"There is still life left," Jaifray muir.&#xD;

c&#xD;
&#xD;
In replaping the clothing, and as he with-&#xD;
drey his hand, his eyes rested upon some-C&#xD;
thing protruding from: one of the vest&#xD;
po9kets.&#xD;
The.moment his flungers closed upon it he&#xD;
knew by the feeling that it was a roll of bank&#xD;
notes.&#xD;
"Money--bank billsI-" fis hand clenchedI&#xD;
over the little roll like a vice. Then the&#xD;
thought of his dead wife flashed into hisI&#xD;
mind. "Poor Mary; these ,would have&#xD;
saved your life--your life-Too late.-too&#xD;
late !0 Another thought followed this, upon&#xD;
whish he acted at once.&#xD;
He caught the senselfas 'form under the&#xD;
arms and as carefully as possible dragged it&#xD;
further nto the darkness of the cellar.&#xD;
"If I only had a light! Surgly this man&#xD;
has aqi been robbed. The ruffian, must have&#xD;
been frightened off, or-"&#xD;
Silence! He heard the slow tread of sone&#xD;
one passing upon the pavement above.&#xD;
"The policeman; much use he is, except&#xD;
to carry. off the dead after ethe murder's&#xD;
done.'', The sound of the official's steps died&#xD;
away, mingling with the far-off noises of the&#xD;
great etteet beyond. ,.-&#xD;
Then Jaffray lifted theta wreck of the door4&#xD;
replaced it'in the opening from the outside,&#xD;
and Ascending the steps,.hurried down the&#xD;
narrow street toward the Bowery.&#xD;
By the light, gleaming -out over the en-&#xD;
trance to a corner drinking-saloon, he exam-&#xD;
ined the notes. There were three fiv5-dollar&#xD;
bills.&#xD;
Fifteen dollars ! The firstinoney, save per-&#xD;
hapa 'few shillings, his trembling hands had&#xD;
grasped in many weeks. His eyeA brighten-&#xD;
ed. The sight of money in his possession&#xD;
*as equal to wmonthof surfeit.&#xD;
Thrusting thenodes hu his pocket, he entered&#xD;
the salo6n and approached the bir with as&#xD;
much indifference as in his excited condition&#xD;
he could assume.'&#xD;
The saloon was nearly deserted. Two or&#xD;
three loungers were seated at a table in the&#xD;
further part of the room lingering over their&#xD;
last round of drinks, as if loth to leave the&#xD;
warmth of the place and (begin, their 4ome-&#xD;
ward tramp through the fierce wind. The&#xD;
&#xD;
bals of thpe sloon clock marked the h ,M&#xD;
of twele.&#xD;
"Bt1randy," said Jaray.&#xD;
The barkeeper,a young man wiathn'(i&#xD;
face, high cheek ,bones, a heavy moustache6&#xD;
keen grey eyes, hair cropped short, aid'with&#xD;
his shirt sleeves rolled up, handed his cus-&#xD;
tomer glass and bottle..&#xD;
As Jaffray raised the glass to his lii-s, he&#xD;
beheld a smeaT of Mood upon his hand.&#xD;
The keen-eyed barkeeper noticed it at the&#xD;
same instant.&#xD;
To this funetionary, whose liter years had&#xD;
been passed amid   e,howls and rowdyismi&#xD;
of east-side gin-shops, the sight of blooA&#xD;
though niot y any meanson uucnnomgn o0-&#xD;
currence naturally provoked his curidsity&#xD;
'out your hand, sir i" he said. o  het&#xD;
A 1, that brandyis. How'd you cutit I"&#xD;
"Cut it-no-Only struck it against the&#xD;
door-post as I came in, that's all" r&#xD;
Jaffray, shortly.&#xD;
The barkeeper gave him4 a sharglook e&#xD;
saw that tes man ,before him, despite the&#xD;
efforts to conceal his emotion; was laboring&#xD;
under, the influence of a strong mental z&#xD;
citeNert. .He noted, too, that the hand,&#xD;
of his customer, as he held the glass to his&#xD;
lips, trebled.&#xD;
"Cold   'nd out," said Jaffra  fter heh d,&#xD;
drank.&#xD;
The liquor--and he had taken a tiff dose&#xD;
of it-seemed to warm him into newlif, 1&#xD;
had been many a long day since his lips had&#xD;
tasted liquor.&#xD;
"Change this bill," he said brusquely.&#xD;
"A five--ertainly, but "-the balkeeper&#xD;
held the note up  "Why, man. here's blood&#xD;
on the bill,,tgo. Off your ha4 s'pose I&#xD;
How blood will catch and stick to every-&#xD;
thing, won't it1" He placed the note ,in the&#xD;
drawer and gave Jaffray his change.&#xD;
Jaffray gathered it up and, shoving it&#xD;
loosely into the pocket iof his-shabby vast,&#xD;
with a curt "good night," turned away and&#xD;
left, the saloon.&#xD;
"That man's had arough time somewhere.&#xD;
Lord, how his hand shpok-the hand with&#xD;
the blood on it," said the barkeeper to one&#xD;
of the men at thg table.&#xD;
"Who is he, Joe I*s&#xD;
&#xD;
"DMno-but I shan't forgit his fede sho.&#xD;
He's a hard-looking nut., He's been up to,&#xD;
some deviltry, I'll bet, or mny game's not Joe&#xD;
Muddler. He don't look as if he was in' the&#xD;
habit of carryin' fives and tens about hini as&#xD;

Jaffrayout of the saloon, wiped-the blood'&#xD;
from his hand upon the frayed skirt of his.&#xD;
coat.&#xD;
From a neighboring grocery-one ofthose&#xD;
all-night shops where groceries are the pre-&#xD;
text and villanous liquor' the reality-he&#xD;
purchased a candle;' then retraeed'fiis step&#xD;
to the  cellar, once rore to confront death&#xD;

dreamed was to be 'the beginning of a long,&#xD;
hard battlei..&#xD;
A battle with fate, a struggle which was&#xD;
to eid-where I&#xD;
Onca Within the den, he fastehed the&#xD;
shattered door as losely as' possible, then&#xD;
lighted the candle. His first glance rested&#xD;
upon the rigid face of his dead wife.; He'&#xD;
shuddered as he turned frota the horrible&#xD;
sight and stepped toward the form of the&#xD;

"Put not your trust in husbands."&#xD;

Mrs. Cletchit by this time had subsided'&#xD;
into a spasm of hysterical sobbing- -a sure&#xD;
symptom in- a woman that she is cotfiig&#xD;

-"I want 'to' use Mr. Clutchit-as won is&#xD;

In compliance with the call, Mr. Clutehit,&#xD;
bringing with him the odor of tobacco-&#xD;
smoke, entered through the hall ddor.&#xD;
When he came in, almost the first object&#xD;
his eyes rested upon was the gleaming dia-&#xD;

Clutchit paled. - Could it be possible&#xD;
"Dick," said his wife, "this lady has a&#xD;
little business for us to transact, she-"&#xD;
"I will explain It. I shall require the&#xD;
services of Mr. Clutchit more particularly 'at&#xD;

him what I want, and through 'him commu-&#xD;

evidence that I aan in earnest, here are twen-&#xD;

Clutchit shivered.&#xD;
Twenty dollars to begin with, Mrs.&#xD;
Olutchit. Is it a bargain I",&#xD;
&#xD;
Of course it was.' What will not poverty,&#xD;
detected in- a criminal act do to condone"'&#xD;
the offence.&#xD;
As Mrs. Clutchit received the twenty dol-&#xD;
lars she gave Mr. Clutchit the benefit of a&#xD;
look which made that individual shiver&#xD;
again.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
GUROGE JAFFRAY GETS ON TOr OP TIE&#xD;
CnUsvo&#xD;
GEORGE JAPPRAY sped on through the&#xD;
gloom of the night, in defiance of the fierce&#xD;
wind which seemed to whistle a poverty's&#xD;
dirge through his threadbare garments. At&#xD;
last he crossed the street and entered a place&#xD;
over the door of which, painted upon the&#xD;
glass, was the sign&#xD;
"LODGINGS."&#xD;
'Whatever money he might have with him,&#xD;
hC'knew that he was in no condition to pre.&#xD;
sent hmself in a hotel in quest of a room;&#xD;
his appearance was too suggestive of the&#xD;
vagabond for-that.'&#xD;
Having paid the amount demanded as the&#xD;
price of bed and room for the night, Jaffray&#xD;
was speedily conducted to them by a half-&#xD;
asleep, flabby youth, bearing in his grimy&#xD;
haid a smoky tin lamp.&#xD;
"Anythin', else," he queried as he placed&#xD;
the lamp upon the.stand.&#xD;
NQ ; go I" answered Jaffray.&#xD;
"D Dy'u want to be called early I"&#xD;
"Ho; go I I'll call myself ,when I'm&#xD;
ready-"'&#xD;
Rum   old rounder, that cove I" mur-&#xD;
mqured the flabby youth, as he disappeared,&#xD;
down the dark passage.&#xD;
Jaffray closed and bolted the door, and&#xD;
seated himself in the only chair in the nar-&#xD;
row, cell-like room.&#xD;
4" For the first time in many a long week&#xD;
George' Jaffray can enj6y the luxiuy 'of~ a',&#xD;
bed," he said, as he glanced about him, but&#xD;
at wiat a cost&#xD;
After'sitting awhile the wild intense ex.&#xD;
citement of the past few hours passed awaq,&#xD;
and now that be. was calmer he begar to&#xD;
feel the heavy physical weariness produced&#xD;
by mental exhaustion'and long fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN THECRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
But by   strong effort he roused himself,&#xD;
enk taking the wallet from his pocket, pro-&#xD;
ceeded to give its, contents a thorough,&#xD;
ting f   ..&#xD;
"arte-de-visite. What agloriqus face but&#xD;
nothing, of the apgel in it---there is too mucOi&#xD;

Ah, that's over and gone,. and this is a,&#xD;

Wlo0 nows but'it may be a pref. . I'll look&#xD;
Into the matter after I throw off the outward&#xD;

as he lay there for a brief period meditating,&#xD;
busily?iapping out his plabsfr'the ffiture,&#xD;
the last night's-fearful'oideal4and the fate df&#xD;
his wife came to him more like ithe rimem-&#xD;

The thought of his dead wife alone sad.&#xD;
denedhita.&#xD;
As the recollection of their happier days,&#xD;
of her deVfotion and unfaltering love, which&#xD;
crowned her memory aswith, a halo, came&#xD;
unto his mind. the tas 'welled out ponhis&#xD;
thin,, starved fage, and jhe sobbed: like a&#xD;

And, now to the Morgui-f om there to&#xD;

pushed it away. She slowy recovered.&#xD;
" My carrage is at the door. I-I. am&#xD;

"If he has, been. foully, dealt with his&#xD;

flashing eyes. "DOUBTLkss! He will be&#xD;
caught! That wap his murderer, and  .1 11aI&#xD;
not forget his face. Henceforth there is no&#xD;

" In every possible way I will assist you,"&#xD;
interrupted the banker. "I have been de-&#xD;
ceived. He has wronged me."&#xD;
" Wronged you-you out of a few paltry&#xD;
dollars! Compare that wrong to mine."&#xD;
"Really, Miss Trainor!"&#xD;
"Never mind, I came here with .a hope-&#xD;
faint it is true, that I might be able on my&#xD;

return to a home that henceforth will be&#xD;
shadowed with such sorrow as only the&#xD;
heart of bereaved nidthercan feel. Should&#xD;
we desire your assistance I will inform you&#xD;
of It."&#xD;
Her calmness, suddenly following her&#xD;
outburst of passion,'so surprised the banker&#xD;
that he could ontly bow in reply.'&#xD;
Drawing the veil over her, fade she passed&#xD;
from the banker's presence,&#xD;
Mr. Kramnp followed her, closing'the door&#xD;
behind him.&#xD;
Jerome Duval was alone.&#xD;
"So, by this's scoundrel I have been de-&#xD;
frauded out of twenty-five thousand dollars,&#xD;
and that girl thinks nothing of it. A woman&#xD;
is an enigma; no! -she is the epitome of&#xD;
willful blind stubbornness; my first step in&#xD;
this affair shall be to put the facts in pos-&#xD;
session of 9 detective. I will not consult&#xD;
her-she w6uld muss the whole of it by her&#xD;
folly."  He touched the bell.&#xD;
A messenger entered, the banker penned&#xD;
a note, enclosed it in an envelope, and direct-&#xD;
ed it.&#xD;
"Go at once to the police headquarters,&#xD;
deliver this note, and bring me an answer.&#xD;
You need not mention the object of your&#xD;

His meditation was interrupted by the&#xD;
entrance of Mr. Kramp with a letter,&#xD;
"What is thisI"&#xD;
"A boy brought it; wants a answer,"&#xD;
grunted the Cashier. The bankei opene4tit.&#xD;

"Of course, being a banker's daughter,&#xD;
she could not be otherwise," interrupted&#xD;
Duval.&#xD;
"AgainI You seem to have a strange&#xD;
dislike to our gods of wealth and their&#xD;
belongings.".&#xD;
"I beg pardon.   Accept my second&#xD;
apology; but really-"&#xD;
"4Ah, Mr. Glenham, you are hyper-&#xD;
critical."&#xD;
"Oh, no. Were I hypercritical I might&#xD;
say something still more unpleasant; but&#xD;
his daughter-does she appear in society&#xD;
often?"&#xD;
"1 Seldom,"was the Madame's reply.&#xD;
Mrs. and Miss Trainor, Mr. Glenham-&#xD;
there just beyond the group around Mr.&#xD;
Duval, evidently they have just arrived."&#xD;
"And pray who are they,, Madame Mo-&#xD;
quard?"&#xD;
"Very amiable people. Rumor has it&#xD;
that Miss Trainor is engaged to-." The&#xD;
reply was unfinished. At that moment&#xD;
Miss Trainor's face came in full view;&#xD;
every feature was visible to Glenham.&#xD;
"My God 2" he almost exclaimed aloud,&#xD;
"that is the face, the very'face I"&#xD;
"What is it, Mr. GlenhamI Are you&#xD;
ill?"&#xD;
"No, no.   A momentary surprise-a&#xD;
case of mistaken identity, nothing more I&#xD;
assure-you."&#xD;
Madame Moquard gave him    a sharp,&#xD;
penetrating glance.&#xD;
"It is the reality of the fce photo-&#xD;
graphed upon the carte-d&amp;amp;-visite which I&#xD;
found in the pocket of the dying man on&#xD;
that terrible night," he said to himself,&#xD;
"and why has fate led her here to 'my&#xD;
presenceI" Then aloud:&#xD;
"Madame Moquard, do you know Miss&#xD;
-Miss Trainoer's given name?"&#xD;
"Louise, I believe."&#xD;
The mystery was out. 'Now Glenham&#xD;
understood it all. Ths wasLouise Train-&#xD;
or, the sister of the dead stranger. The&#xD;
letter beginning yitb ".Dear Iobert," and&#xD;
signed "Louise,w" was herlast letter to her&#xD;
brother,'Robert Trainor, and he, looking&#xD;
In3&#xD;
&#xD;
then upon her, remembered the words he&#xD;
uttered when he had read the letter in&#xD;
that obscure lodging-house in the Bowery&#xD;
on the night he fled away from the Pell&#xD;
street cellar&#xD;
"Out of thousands bearing those names,&#xD;
Louise and Robert, in this 'vast city, I&#xD;
might, in ten years' search, happen to find&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Glenham, now that the mystery of the&#xD;
identity of the man to whose terrible mis-&#xD;
fortune hie'owed his present position, and&#xD;
that of the sister within his reach, re-&#xD;
solved to avoid her ; why, will be revealed&#xD;
hereafter.&#xD;
" There, Mr. Glenham, isn't he perfectly&#xD;
handsome? DI'ye see I" broke in Madame&#xD;
Moquard, pointing to a distinguished look-&#xD;
ing individual just entering.  "Not to&#xD;
know him is to argue yourself a stran-&#xD;
ger-"&#xD;
"To fashionable religion," interrupted&#xD;
Glenham.. "Yes; I see him and know&#xD;
him. He is the Reverend Mr. Pawridge,&#xD;
who gets ten thousand a year for his good&#xD;
looks and his capacity for teaching his&#xD;
high-toned congregation how not to be&#xD;
followers of the Nazarene."&#xD;
" Madame the Countess Moquardl -it&#xD;
was St. Leon who spoke, havee you-a&#xD;
moment to spare ,"&#xD;
"Certainly, if Mr. Glonham will accept&#xD;
-my apologies for deserting him."&#xD;
f Certainly, for a moment," replied Glen-&#xD;
ham, smiling.&#xD;
St. Leon and Madame Moquard bowing,&#xD;
passed on a few steps and were soon ap-&#xD;
parently in earnest conversation.&#xD;
"That Countess is another social riddle&#xD;
I shall solve one of these days," mentally&#xD;
noted Glenham. "I think, Robert Glen-&#xD;
ham," he said to himself, "it will be bet.&#xD;
ter for you to disappear from this scene."&#xD;
In pursuance of this mental resotvo he&#xD;
slowly pushed his way through the "Con-&#xD;
stantly moving throng in the drawing-&#xD;
rooms carefully avoiding, though through&#xD;
no special feeling of fear, the groups'sdr.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV-&#xD;
"RIGHT IN THE MInDLE OF THE BUNJA-&#xD;
LOO," AS INTERPRETED BY 31R. CLUTCH-&#xD;
IT-WITH THE REVEREND MR. PAW-;&#xD;
RIDGE'S ACTION THEREON.&#xD;
WHILE the Reverend Mr. Pawridge was&#xD;
in the act of explaining to Mrs. Shrugg,&#xD;
her daughter, Arabella, and her brother,&#xD;
-m. Namby Shrugg, the reason ofjthe&#xD;
absence of' Mrs. Pawridge from these&#xD;
scenes of dazzling light and human love,&#xD;
there ame an unlooked for interruption.&#xD;
The cry of "Put him out" was heard&#xD;
in the hall. 'Then, "How did he get in "&#xD;
" He's coming up 1" " Where are the ser-&#xD;
vuntsI" "Theruffian!1"1&#xD;
Immediately, thereafter a voice broke&#xD;
-out in song. The voice was not operatic&#xD;
'y 'any means. It lacked culture slightly,&#xD;
and the- higher -notes were somewhat&#xD;
cracked.&#xD;
From the bustle and confusion it was&#xD;
evident the singer was bilariously obsti-&#xD;
nate.,                             ,&#xD;
" Wout you be quiet!"&#xD;
 R-r-r-r-erise up Wil-li-am' Rer-r-r-&#xD;
eriley and come er-eralong with me," ral"&#xD;
lied the voice.&#xD;
"Get thepolice!"&#xD;
"Lemma alone; I'm a gen'l'man and a&#xD;
child of song!"&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN TH&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then upon the hot, perfumed air ar&#xD;
the sound of a slight scuffle, and present-&#xD;
ly in the broad arched doorway stood the&#xD;
obstreperously inclined child of song, ha t&#xD;
in hand, facg the high and mighty guests&#xD;
of the blue-blooded Shruggs.&#xD;
The child of song was Mr. Clutchit,&#xD;
with the wink of inebriation in his eye-&#xD;
and the blush of hot whiskey, not to speak&#xD;
of other fluids, upon his nose.&#xD;
"Who is he?.1" was the general murmur&#xD;
pervading the astonished throng, for they&#xD;
saw by his apparel he was not one of their-&#xD;
"set.&#xD;
"Lays andgenelmen-spologise--brupt,&#xD;
perence-buz 'fac' is (hic) friend o? minez&#xD;
ere  (hic)-~ I&#xD;
The hicepough suddenly changed the eur-&#xD;
rent of his mind and he burst out once&#xD;
more as a- child of song, and entered, or&#xD;
rather waved into the room.   Out' he&#xD;
roared the fragment of an old army chant:&#xD;
"Nght in the midAle of (hic) the Bunjaloo,&#xD;
Oh (hie) I love ,Marja(o an ashe lovesh me,&#xD;
Dunjtloo (hic), Btinjaloo."&#xD;
At this precise period of his harmonic&#xD;
exiltation St.' Leon, who, had advanced&#xD;
nearest him, suddenly amid divers screams&#xD;
from the' women, grasped Clutehit by the&#xD;
back of the neck, and was in the' act of&#xD;
running him  out when .the voice of the'&#xD;
Reverend Mr. Pawridge was heard.&#xD;
"Let him go, my friendd..&#xD;
St. Leon loosened his hold, and' Clutch-&#xD;
it, in no wise abashed,,faced him.&#xD;
"Whar-yer-er- jays and gen'men.&#xD;
" Right in the middle hic) of the ,unjaloo,&#xD;
Bunjaloo-"&#xD;
"My friend," said the Reverend. Paw-&#xD;
ridge, placinghishandgently upon Clutph-&#xD;
'it's shoulder. "My 4ear friend, permit me&#xD;
to speak a word 'to you in private, Will&#xD;
you oblige me I"&#xD;
Clutchit stared at the reverend gentle-&#xD;
man and then burst into a roaring laugh,&#xD;
which was suddenly terminated byva hip-&#xD;
cough which v7ry nearly made lim dislo-&#xD;
cgte bis necir.  -- .&#xD;
" Thas good. I lie) knowae   -p&#xD;
it, aizza Porrige. Shertenly IMl spl'n.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mum's the word. I know (hic) you; so-so&#xD;
(hic) does Mizzus Porrige."&#xD;
"The fellow's crazy!!" exclaimed one of&#xD;
the blue bloods at a distance.&#xD;
"Be careful, Mr. Pawridge, the wretch&#xD;
may do you some injury!"&#xD;
And the women added a little chorus of&#xD;
exclamations expressive of their regard&#xD;
for the safety of their dear pastor,&#xD;
"Have no fear," said the reverend gen-&#xD;
tleman, with a majestic wave of his hand.&#xD;
"9Words of love will conquer even the&#xD;
tiger; this is merely a man-"&#xD;
Right in the (hi) middle of the'Bunjaloo,&#xD;
added Clutchit-&#xD;
"Now, this way, my friend, this way;&#xD;
one word in private, and then we will, if&#xD;
you desire it, return together ; there, tak e&#xD;
my arm. My friends," and the pastor&#xD;
looked around with the same sort of smile&#xD;
with which every Sabbath morning he&#xD;
leaned over his pulpit and begun his ser-&#xD;
mon. "My friends, you see kindness be-&#xD;
getteth confidence, confidence bringeth&#xD;
love, and love conquers all. Be kind to&#xD;
the erring. We are none of us more than&#xD;
human; we all have our likings-"&#xD;
"Bour (hic) sour for me," put in Clutch-&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"And our dislikes," continued Paw-&#xD;
ridge, placing his arm tenderly within&#xD;
that of Clutchit's. "Come, my friend."&#xD;
Clutchit made no resistance. He mere-'&#xD;
ly hiccoughed a guttural reference to the&#xD;
bulojaloo, and with that mysterious and in-&#xD;

it, thickly.&#xD;
" Merely where we will not be dis-&#xD;

were none of the servants visible. He&#xD;
drew the bolt, and opening the door wide&#xD;
turned to Clutchit, who, by his extreme&#xD;
quietude, was evidently under the im-&#xD;
pression that preparations were being&#xD;
made to invigorate his system with a dose&#xD;
of bourbon, if nothing better. He was&#xD;
mentally deciding whether he would take&#xD;

rudely disturbed.&#xD;
Mr. Pawridge bad grasped him by the&#xD;
coat collar with a ferocious grip, and be-&#xD;
gan bombarding him with a fierce sue&#xD;
cession of kicks, each one of which almost&#xD;
lifted him from the floor and towards the&#xD;

"You infernal, drunken vagabond, get&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
LOUISE TRAINOR FINDS A CLUE-ST. LEON.&#xD;
THERE were tlkee persons at that fite&#xD;
of the Shrugg'b who were far more&#xD;
troubled, mentally, than either Mr. Clutch-&#xD;
it or the Reverend Mr. Pawridge, but&#xD;
upon either of their faces were the masks&#xD;
of content, or happiness,. or peacefulness,&#xD;
behind which the babbling throng could&#xD;
not see. ,&#xD;
Why should they not hide their face?7Far&#xD;
better as it is that we all should hide from&#xD;
the world, from our friends, the troubles of&#xD;
our lives. Each has his or her own griefs,&#xD;
anxieties, and daily torments to battle&#xD;
with, and certainlyis notrefreshed by hav-&#xD;
ing added to the number, those of others.&#xD;
Robert Glenham, when he returned to&#xD;
his hotel, was full of thought, of schemes,&#xD;
of fancies, concerning the future of the&#xD;
course he had marked out for himself..&#xD;
To-night he had been brought face to face&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
with Jerome Duval, and there had arisen&#xD;
before him the fair face and features of&#xD;
Louise Trainor, the original of the photo-&#xD;
graph carte-de-visite which he had found&#xD;
in the dying man's wallet. But might not&#xD;
the man who had been thrown d6wn the&#xD;
steps of the miserable cellar in Pell street&#xD;
be another than her brother? It was&#xD;
barely possible. However it might be,&#xD;
should suspicion once in the remotest de-&#xD;
gree point its fateful finger at him as be-&#xD;
ing connected with the death of Robert&#xD;
Trainor-that man, and through one of&#xD;
those strange mysteries of life step-by step&#xD;
retrace his career back into the blackness&#xD;
of that awful night, and so fix upon him&#xD;
even the robbery of the helpless victim,&#xD;
there would be but one more step-the&#xD;
scaffold. Circumstantial evidence hangs&#xD;
more men than absolute fact. Fact in&#xD;
testimony is no more nor less than itself,&#xD;
it is hard, plain, and absolute; it suggests&#xD;
nothing to come, and out of it is born no&#xD;
mystery; circumstantial evidence, vague,&#xD;
a thing of hints, inuendoes, surprises, and&#xD;
never complete, a romance and suggestion,&#xD;
always pointing to something yet unre-&#xD;
vealed.&#xD;
Should Jerome Duval recognize him-&#xD;
there was but little fear of that, however&#xD;
-but should he, would not that recogm-&#xD;
tion reopen investigation and so lead to&#xD;
the forging, despite himself, link by link,&#xD;
ofa chain of circumstantial evidence which&#xD;
would drag him down to disgrace?9&#xD;
He shuddered as his imagination con-&#xD;
ceived the bare possibility of such a re-&#xD;
sult.&#xD;
And Louise Trainor, bad she so soon&#xD;
given up the search for her brotherI&#xD;
Never since the hour she had confronted&#xD;
the stranger in the banking-house of&#xD;
Jerome Duval had she ceased racking her&#xD;
mind with the terrible thought. Yet she&#xD;
had made no outward demonstration of&#xD;
her intent, or of her mental trouble since&#xD;
that day. She, too, wore her mask.&#xD;
Jerome Duval, despite hie mssk-that&#xD;
stereotyped smile-wasmentallysuffering.&#xD;
Though his pride, his inordinate selfish-&#xD;
ness, had almost absolute control, over&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.'&#xD;
&#xD;
him, yet the thoughts of the past, of , his&#xD;
treatment of-his dead daughter and of the&#xD;
terrible ordeal to which the unexpected&#xD;
revelation of her death and, as he bnagin-&#xD;
ed, that of her husband had subjected him&#xD;
would obtrude themselves.&#xD;
So far as his conscience was concerned,&#xD;
is trouble would have been exceedingly&#xD;
alight, but it.was that intense fear of so-&#xD;
ciety getting at the facts; of a raking up&#xD;
of all the old stories of Jaffray's elopement&#xD;
with his daughter.&#xD;
There was the real fear of Duval.&#xD;
From his remaining daughter, Edith, he&#xD;
had concealed the skeleton in his house&#xD;
with care and caution until that unlucky&#xD;
day.&#xD;
When Edith, by the confession of her&#xD;
mother, had acquainted herself with all'&#xD;
the details of the wrong done her sister, a&#xD;
sister whom she had never remembered,&#xD;
nor of whom had she ever before heard,&#xD;
she scarcely knew what course to take.&#xD;
She would not abandon her mother, yet&#xD;
she had resolved to remain no longer be-&#xD;
neath her father's roof if a plausible excuse&#xD;
could be found for making her home else-&#xD;
where.&#xD;
The mother broached the subject to&#xD;
Duval. He was inflexibly opposed to any&#xD;
such arrangement.&#xD;
"What you know You know," said he&#xD;
to Edith one day; "what else there may&#xD;
be of our family matters and our troubles&#xD;
in the past that you do not know, I do&#xD;
not care to have you learn abroad. Your&#xD;
home is a palace, Edith; all that my-&#xD;
wealth can bring you, you well know, is&#xD;
yours; but to leave my roof to reside&#xD;
elsewhere is the satisfaction of a foolish&#xD;
freak I will not permit."&#xD;
The mother's influence, like his, though&#xD;
on the wane with the poor girl, for a while&#xD;
held her in check, but not long.&#xD;
At several reunions, parties, and in their&#xD;
box at the opera, she had met Madame the&#xD;
Countess Moquard. Sometimes that'superb&#xD;
woman was accompanied by St. Leon, to&#xD;
whoi Edith had taken an unaccountable&#xD;
dislike; sometimes with Madame were&#xD;
other lights of society.&#xD;
&#xD;
37&#xD;
&#xD;
One evening, while as yet undetermined&#xD;
by what ,means, she should get beyond&#xD;
and out of the dark shadows of selfishness&#xD;
and pride, and away from the mockeries&#xD;
which surrounded her in her own home, a&#xD;
party of young ladies, many of them her&#xD;
former class-mates in the Spingler Insti-&#xD;
tute, was made up to attend the opera&#xD;
'' Traviata" being the attraction with Gaz-&#xD;
zaniga, then at the height of her popular-&#xD;
ity, and Brignoli.&#xD;
Through the invitation of one of the&#xD;
ladies, Glenham was one of the gentlemen&#xD;
selected to accompany them.&#xD;
This brought about an introduction to&#xD;
Edith of the "grave, quiet, thoughtful&#xD;
man-so gentlemanly, so reserved, so&#xD;
polite, and so polished," as one of, the&#xD;
young ladies in,-her enthusiastic admira-&#xD;
tion described him to another.&#xD;
So, by one of the trifling chances of his&#xD;
every-day life, Glenham found himself in&#xD;
conversation with the young sister of his&#xD;
dead wife, the daughter of his bitterest&#xD;
enemy.&#xD;
Could that young girl have known to&#xD;
whom she was speaking, with whom she&#xD;
was so pleasantly chatting upon the opera,&#xD;
what might have been the result ?&#xD;
Had that meetingg not have occurred,&#xD;
this story might have ended here.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
ST. LEON5 S TORY--WHEN AND WHERE&#xD;
sT. LEON MET MADAME THE "COUNTESS"&#xD;
MOQUARD.&#xD;
ONE evening, two years prior to the&#xD;
occurrence of the terrible death of George&#xD;
Jaffray's wife in the Pell street basement,&#xD;
St. Leon,-then a stranger in the city, was&#xD;
standing in front of the main entrance to&#xD;
an uptown hotel, then newly erected,&#xD;
looking out upon the crowds which were&#xD;
passing to and fro along the wide pave-&#xD;
ment. He was upon the point of starting&#xD;
off, having lighted a fresh cigar, for a&#xD;
stroll up the street.&#xD;
At that moment his attention was at-&#xD;
tracted by the appearance of a woman in&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

ni&#xD;
It&#xD;
I.&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
the passing throng. To him her walk and&#xD;
demeanor, although she was alone, did&#xD;
not seem in keeping with what he suppos-&#xD;
ed might be her calling.&#xD;
As she turned her face momentarily&#xD;
toward him, the glaring light of the hotel&#xD;
gave him a full view of her features. She&#xD;
was not what he would call beautiful, but&#xD;
she was handsome; her features were regu-&#xD;
lar, and he saw none of the hard lines and&#xD;
traces upon them which indicated a life&#xD;
passed in dissipation. As she passed she&#xD;
merely glanced at him, as any lady might,&#xD;
in common with the rest of the group&#xD;
upon the steps.&#xD;
A sudden whim, an unconquerable im-&#xD;
pulse, induced him to follow her. She&#xD;
crossed the next corner and, discov-&#xD;
ering that she was followed, changed her&#xD;
apparent intention of turning and contin-&#xD;
ued down the avenue.&#xD;
Reaching a quiet portion of the street&#xD;
he came beside her. She looked up, and&#xD;
as he saw no expression indicating an ob-&#xD;
jection to his movements, he addressed&#xD;
her with some common-place phrase by&#xD;
the way of introducing himself.&#xD;
She replied pleasantly, yet with some-&#xD;
thing of reserve. With this introduction&#xD;
they walked on slowly. Her language, as&#xD;
they grew more familiar, betrayed a de-&#xD;
gree of culture and modesty of expression&#xD;
indicating that the social position from&#xD;
which she had fallen might have been&#xD;
above the ordinary level.&#xD;
Down the avenue they walked until&#xD;
they reached Twelfth street. By this&#xD;
time much of her reserve had vanished,&#xD;
and the two chatted as volubly as if they&#xD;
were old acquaintances now met after a&#xD;
long separation.&#xD;
She informed him that she resided in&#xD;
St. Mark's Place. He offered his services to&#xD;
escort her a portion or all the way home,&#xD;
as she was alone. Jestingly she placed her&#xD;
arm within his, she felt safer, she said, and&#xD;
it looked more respectable.&#xD;
At this moment they came opposite a&#xD;
fine large residence; she glanced toward&#xD;
it, then turned her face from it and shud-&#xD;
dered as if she had caught sight of some&#xD;
&#xD;
: horrible phantom. He felt her hand con-&#xD;
vulsively tighten its clasp upon his arm.&#xD;
He questioned her as to the cause of her&#xD;
strange emotion; she gave him an evasive&#xD;
answer, and for a while she appeared de-&#xD;
pressed. Her gaiety had partially vanish-&#xD;
ed. Reaching the house in St. ,eark's Place&#xD;
he paused upon the steps.&#xD;
His curiosity was piqued to learn the&#xD;
cause of the sudden change in her demean-&#xD;
or when opposite that mysterious build-&#xD;
ing. For the deep and strange interest he&#xD;
felt in regard to this woman, he could not&#xD;
account, and he was inclined to laugh at&#xD;
himself for it. It was the fascination of&#xD;
the hour he thought,&#xD;
St. Leon became a constant visitor, and&#xD;
once or twice escorted her to the theatre.&#xD;
He discovered that when there was work&#xD;
in that line, she earned a living by making&#xD;
artificial flowers, or gave lessons in music.&#xD;
One day, and despite himself he knew it&#xD;
would be the inevitable conclusion of the&#xD;
intimacy out of which lhad grown up for&#xD;
her an unconquerable love, he proposed&#xD;
marriage. At first she firmly refused, but&#xD;
this only the more determined him; at last&#xD;
she yielded. She then told him the story of&#xD;
her life. In that he learned that with all&#xD;
her brilliance and undoubted intellect she&#xD;
had been the victim of that one great mis-&#xD;
take -of womankind.&#xD;
This occurred one year prior to this&#xD;
meeting with St. Leon, who was about to&#xD;
become her husband. She was then a&#xD;
scholar at the Spingler Institute, and rare-&#xD;
ly missed a day in her regular attendance.&#xD;
Her parentswere wealthy, though not what&#xD;
the ton of society would regard as rich,&#xD;
and resided in New Orleans, and had sent&#xD;
her to NewYork to complete her education.&#xD;
There were only her and her sister, three&#xD;
years younger than herself, for the parents&#xD;
to idolize. Their every wish had been&#xD;
gratified, and their future bade fair to be&#xD;
bright and happy. Both sisters attended&#xD;
the school, but in different departments.&#xD;
One day she noticed a gentleman stand-&#xD;
ing near the steps of the boarding-house&#xD;
which adjoined the Institute as she came&#xD;
out with one of her companions. When ho&#xD;
&#xD;
38&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN TH&#xD;
eaughtlier glance momentarily fixed upon&#xD;
his he raised his hat slightly and smiling-&#xD;
ly bowed.&#xD;
The man was well dressed, good look-&#xD;
ig, and there was an expression of earnest&#xD;
admiration and respect upon his counte-&#xD;
nance which the woman could not fail to&#xD;
notice. She passed on to go out. Next&#xD;
mornng he was there again, and again&#xD;
smiled and bowed. For three or four days&#xD;
this continued, when one afternoon, hap-&#xD;
pening to go out -earlier than usual she&#xD;
saw him evidently waiting for her. Then&#xD;
he saluted her. She hesitated. He found&#xD;
his advantage in that hesitation, and for&#xD;
the first time spoke to her, she was fright-&#xD;
ened, but the apparent sincerity and re-&#xD;
spect inhis tone reassured her. He walked&#xD;
beside her to the corner of University&#xD;
place, but in that interview made no ad-&#xD;
vances to excite a suspicion. Besides, why&#xD;
should she suspect, knowing no evil her-&#xD;
self? A day or two after this she saw him&#xD;
again, and in return for his bow he receiv-&#xD;
ed from her a smile of recognition and a&#xD;
nod. There, thus meeting almost daily,&#xD;
these simple recognitions merged into&#xD;
short walks together.&#xD;
He played a sure game.&#xD;
From short walks their intimacy grew&#xD;
into longer strolls, step by step by his spe-&#xD;
cious artifices he led her to love him, he&#xD;
promising, entreating, filling her imagina-&#xD;
tion with dreams of future bliss. While&#xD;
withhim her home and parents were for-&#xD;
gotten; When at home he and his protesta-&#xD;
tions occupied her mind.&#xD;
She became frequently absent from her&#xD;
recitations, wenVtoff for long rambles in the&#xD;
parks and through the bye streets, until&#xD;
one afternoon she went with him to Tay-&#xD;
or's. There for the first time he prevailed&#xD;
upon her to drink a glass of wine, then&#xD;
another, and yet another.&#xD;
All the while his serpent tongue beguil-&#xD;
ing her deeper into the toils. Dazed, be-&#xD;
wildered by the strange excitement of the&#xD;
wine, she accompanied him from the saloon&#xD;
-and she then realized the extent of her&#xD;
error.&#xD;
Under various pretexts through all their'&#xD;
&#xD;
E CRUSTS.                          39&#xD;
acquiintance he had persuaded her not to&#xD;
reveal their intimacy to her parents.&#xD;
Go.back to the Institute to remain she&#xD;
could not. Go home she dared not, wouki&#xD;
not. Two or three times she met this&#xD;
man. He laughed at her, then threatened&#xD;
her, cowardly scoundrel that he was.&#xD;
Then she secured 1;oard and apartments&#xD;
in St. Mark's place. Until this her remit-&#xD;
tances had come regularly for her from&#xD;
home. Then they failed. For the first&#xD;
few ihonths she had a hard struggle&#xD;
with poverty. Here the thread of her&#xD;
story is taken up by St Leon, who had&#xD;
become fascinated with her. He heard&#xD;
her story, trusted her, married her, and&#xD;
they took up their abode at a hotel.&#xD;
Among the few trinkets and keepsakes&#xD;
she possessed at the time of their mar-&#xD;
riagehe had noticed the carte de visited por-&#xD;
trait of a young man. Questioning her&#xD;
in reference to it, he found that she al-b&#xD;
ways evaded direct reply, and not desir-&#xD;
ing to cause her pain, he finally ceased&#xD;
his inquiries. But he impressed upon his&#xD;
memory the features of the portrait. He&#xD;
trusted her and loved her as a man&#xD;
should do.&#xD;
Some weeks after their marriage, re-&#xD;
turning homeward one evening from Nib-&#xD;
lo's Garden, St. Leon suddenly pro-&#xD;
posed a walk up Broadway instead of the&#xD;
usual carriage ride. Strolling on up they&#xD;
reached Grace church, then crossed over&#xD;
toward the Astor Place hotel.&#xD;
As they stepped upon the. curbstone,&#xD;
her arm resting lovingly in his, she sud-&#xD;
denly started, partially drew back, and&#xD;
he felt her hand grasp his arm in the&#xD;
same convulsive effort as it did on the&#xD;
evening when- they  passed the insti-&#xD;
tute.&#xD;
As he looked up to see the cause of&#xD;
her strange terror, he beheld only one&#xD;
person, a young man, well dressed, smok-&#xD;
ing a cigar and standing in the entrance"&#xD;
to the hotel.&#xD;
One glance was sufficient, the face was&#xD;
the original of the face of the carte de&#xD;
visit he had seen in her possession.&#xD;
The man was in the act of bowing in a&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="40 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6629-00000024"/>&#xD;
BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
mocking manner when his eye caught&#xD;
that of St. Leon; on the instant he disap-&#xD;
peared into the hotel.&#xD;
St. Leon made no comment then, but&#xD;
arrived at their hotel he at once told her&#xD;
he recognized the person on the steps of&#xD;
the St. Denis as the original of the por-&#xD;
trait, and demanded who he was, and&#xD;
why his appearance had such an effect&#xD;
upon her.&#xD;
She revealed the secret, for she said&#xD;
that further concealment might bring&#xD;
upon her distrust, and a suspicion of her&#xD;
fidelity. He took the portrait. Upon the&#xD;
back of it was written the name "Mo-&#xD;
quard."&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIIL&#xD;
ST. LEON AND HIS LITTLE TROUBLE.&#xD;
APTER all, the secret which she revealed&#xD;
to him concerning the man of whose fea-&#xD;
tures St. Leon caught a glimpse as he&#xD;
suddenly disappeared from the entrance&#xD;
of. the Astor Place Hotel was scarcely&#xD;
more in its revealment than a realization&#xD;
of what he had suspected. He knew&#xD;
there was a mystery connected with his&#xD;
life; he knew before they were married&#xD;
that whatever it might be it would sooner&#xD;
or later be unveiled.&#xD;
" Moquard !",&#xD;
That was the name.&#xD;
The man whom he saw in that single&#xD;
glance was evidently a man of the town;&#xD;
in dress, in manner; the mocking siile,&#xD;
the easy graceful gesture as the stranger&#xD;
half saluted his wife was convincing proof&#xD;
to him of a previous intimacy, perhaps&#xD;
closer than she was willing to acknowl-&#xD;
edge.&#xD;
She confessed enough, however. Enough&#xD;
to show that she had loved before.&#xD;
The carte de visite he retained.&#xD;
It was St. Leon's nature to be an adven-&#xD;
turer.  A man who never fought with&#xD;
lifek or fortune, but one who through his&#xD;
shrewdness almost invariably contrived to&#xD;
keep side by side, a boon companion, with&#xD;
both luck and fortune.&#xD;
His sudden affection for her was real.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was perhaps the, first time in his life&#xD;
he had ever become infatuated with aught&#xD;
of womankind.&#xD;
An adventurer himself, a yreyer upon&#xD;
society, and always ready to plunder it by&#xD;
any trick or device which his fertile brain&#xD;
might suggest, even in the very height of&#xD;
his infatuation was not blindly led by it&#xD;
into absolute faith and trust in the honesty&#xD;
and fidelity of the woman he had married.&#xD;
He suspected she might betray him at&#xD;
any moment. Her past life, despite her&#xD;
plausible and certainly pathetic story of&#xD;
her early life, had not been pure; the sud-&#xD;
den trembling and exhibition of fear at&#xD;
the sight of the strange man---the original&#xD;
of the face upon the carte de visite-were&#xD;
to St. Leon evidences of a deeper mystery&#xD;
in regard to him than she had cared to&#xD;
confess.&#xD;
Did she still, despite her story and&#xD;
statement to the contrary, know the resi-&#xD;
dence of this man "Moquard?1"&#xD;
After his discovery, on the evening in&#xD;
question, of the relation of this man Mo-&#xD;
quard, he narrowly watched his wife's&#xD;
movements with a wary eye. He wanted&#xD;
to believe in her, wanted to believe that&#xD;
there was one person who could be true&#xD;
and constant, and thus set at naught his&#xD;
doctrine that society-mankind-were but&#xD;
a crowd of vultures and kites, and that&#xD;
deceit, knavery, and cunning were a part of&#xD;
their nature.&#xD;
With the carte de visite in his possession&#xD;
he was determined to solve the mystery,&#xD;
whenever chance should happen to bring&#xD;
him in contact with the stranger.&#xD;
Should his suspicions be correct, and he&#xD;
discover that she had deceived him in&#xD;
the story she had told, it was no part of&#xD;
his scheme to discard her. Such an idea&#xD;
lie never once entertained. He needed&#xD;
just such a confederate, a woman whom&#xD;
the conflict with the rougher chances of&#xD;
life had rendered callous to the finer feel.&#xD;
ing of her nature. If he could mold her&#xD;
to his purpose and use her in furtherance&#xD;
of his plans, whatever they might be, he&#xD;
did not much care.&#xD;
By adroit practices, by the arts and&#xD;

V7&#xD;
&#xD;
cinning of the bold ard shrewd reaper&#xD;
in the field of human credulity, he had&#xD;
acquired not only all the airs and appear-&#xD;
ance of refinement of the courtly man of&#xD;
society, but a sufficiency of means to sup-&#xD;
port it. Bye-and-bye, something of an es-&#xD;
trangement came about between St. Leon&#xD;
and his wife. They had not quarreled,&#xD;
yet an inexplicable coolness had slowly,&#xD;
almost imperceptibly, grown up between&#xD;
them. Still she served his interest as best&#xD;
she could&#xD;
"We can live together or apart," he&#xD;
said to- her one day, " it matters little as&#xD;
to that formality, ,but whichever course&#xD;
you may prefer it need not prevent one&#xD;
helping the other when necessary. You&#xD;
are a woman of the world, why need you&#xD;
care what the world may say of you I1&#xD;
If we meet in society as mere passing&#xD;
acquaintances, or as apparent strangers,&#xD;
so much the better, for then collusion&#xD;
will not be suspected."&#xD;
And thus, as the coolness in affection&#xD;
grew up between them, the bonds of self-&#xD;
interest became stronger and held them&#xD;
mutually in each'other's, service.&#xD;
One day in July following the date of&#xD;
his marriage, St. Leon bethought him of a&#xD;
jaunt to Coney Island.&#xD;
Perhaps there might be profit in it,&#xD;
mingled with whatever of pleasure the&#xD;
trip iigh afford.&#xD;
Arrived upon the Island towards even-&#xD;
ing, he wandered into one of the hotels&#xD;
near the beach, lit a cigar, and seated him-&#xD;
self upon the veranda.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
THE BRUNETTE OF THE ISLAND-ST. LEON&#xD;
OPENS THE TRAIL WHICH LOUISE TRAIN-&#xD;
OR IS TO FOLLOW.&#xD;
WHILE sitting there listening to the&#xD;
washing of the long sweeping waves as&#xD;
they rolled up upon the sand, St. Leon's&#xD;
attention was attracted by the arrival of a&#xD;
couple of young women, both in their way&#xD;
more than ordinarily handsome-the one a&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
blonde the other a dark-eyed brunette.&#xD;
They had evidently just arrived.&#xD;
Their arrival so late, at the time when&#xD;
the Island was fast being deserted by visit-&#xD;
ors, perhasps caused him to notice them&#xD;
more particularly, as it was evident from&#xD;
this lateness that they intended remaining&#xD;
over night.&#xD;
The blonde and brunette entered the&#xD;
reception room-the low porch windows,&#xD;
or doors rather, of which opened upon the&#xD;
veranda where he was seated. As they&#xD;
entered he heard one of them order supper&#xD;
-and as a preliminary thereto a sherry&#xD;
cobbler and a milk punch.&#xD;
From his seat directly opposite one of&#xD;
the windows by a slight change of position,&#xD;
he was enabled to see and notice their ap-&#xD;
pearance and action ; not only that but in&#xD;
the stillness around, that weird? still-&#xD;
ness which comes only with the night upon&#xD;
the sea shore -to hear their conversation&#xD;
as if uttered in an ordinary tone.&#xD;
The brunette sipped the milk punch&#xD;
while the blonde solaced herself with the&#xD;
lighter exhilaration of the sherry cobbler,&#xD;
and now, as they sat there awaiting their&#xD;
supper, he noted their appearance more&#xD;
closely. The blonde was petite in form, but&#xD;
well formed, lively, quick in motion, and&#xD;
wore that peculiar facial expression of&#xD;
archness and coyness which to even an&#xD;
ordinary observer would suggest the pre-&#xD;
sence of a mask concealing the real nature&#xD;
of the woman. Her dress was not "4loud "&#xD;
in style, or in the contrast of colors-it was&#xD;
appropriate to the season-neat, elegant,&#xD;
and in keeping with her complexion. She&#xD;
was in style, action, and look a foil to the&#xD;
brunette. And the brunette was a nagni-&#xD;
ficent type of the blase woman of pleasure,&#xD;
playing, with an almost indescribable air&#xD;
of reality, the part of a woman of fashion.&#xD;
Taller than her companion, voluptuous&#xD;
in form and in every motion of her rounded&#xD;
limbs, and with no action of her well poised&#xD;
head that was not in itself a study for an&#xD;
artist, she sat there with the easy grace&#xD;
and nonchalant air of one Nyose role was&#xD;
to command, and who had yet to learn the&#xD;
meaning of the word fail in whatever in-&#xD;

THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
42                       BETWEEN&#xD;
trigne or duplicity she attempted. An&#xD;
enchantres-fair to the sight, but in&#xD;
reality false, calculating, cold, and as im-&#xD;
placable as destiny. A Juno in form, a&#xD;
Venus in beauty, a Hecate at heart.&#xD;
Through all her grace, b auty, and&#xD;
queenly fascination was discernible the&#xD;
traces of a hardened life. As she arose to&#xD;
cross the room  with her companion, in&#xD;
answer to the summons to supper, there&#xD;
was in her walk the peculiar swagger, but&#xD;
partially hidden by the lithe gracefulness&#xD;
of her step, which marked her most inti-&#xD;
mate associations to have been with men&#xD;
rather than women. Her carriage was&#xD;
bold and half-defiant, yet withal temper-&#xD;
ed by the studied effort she made to con-&#xD;
ceal it.&#xD;
Half an hour afterward they came out&#xD;
upon the veranda and lit a couple of ciga-&#xD;
rettes. After a few whiffs the blonde&#xD;
threw hers away but the brunette contin-&#xD;
ned to the end, lit another, and when it&#xD;
was finished the pair stepped from the&#xD;
veranda and strolled off to the beach.&#xD;
They then returned and retired for the&#xD;
night. St. Leon, his curiosity piqued, re-&#xD;
solved to remain until next day himself&#xD;
upon the Island, and so enjoy the glories'&#xD;
of the early morning at the pea shore.&#xD;
As to these women, that they were'&#xD;
adventuresses there could be no doubt,&#xD;
harpies of some sort, and that they were&#xD;
there to play their part in one of the many&#xD;
games by which the unwary are entrapped&#xD;
was reduced to certainty.&#xD;
While they were seated near the open&#xD;
window leading to the veranda a light&#xD;
wagon was driven up and in it were two&#xD;
men.&#xD;
The eldest of the two was evidently a&#xD;
sport of the sort, that may be seen-any day&#xD;
lounging about hotel steps or in the neigh-&#xD;
borhood of first-class saloons. The gray-&#xD;
tweed summer suit, 'the heavy watch&#xD;
chain, the cluster diamond pin in his&#xD;
bosom, the sharp, watchful eye, the hard,&#xD;
worn look of the features, and that name-&#xD;
less expression of cunning which pervaded&#xD;
his whole appearance, bore the stamp and&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
seal of his profession as a gambler and&#xD;
sharp.&#xD;
His companion was plainly, at least so&#xD;
St. Leon thought, not of his class. He,&#xD;
had that open, fresh, hearty look which&#xD;
the professional gambler never has; there&#xD;
was health and strength in his movements.&#xD;
Clad in white duck pants, dark coat&#xD;
and vest-fitting neatly-a light summer&#xD;
hat of the farhionableg$ray, a neat but not&#xD;
showy watch chain and charms-these&#xD;
attributes enumerated and you have the&#xD;
man. That he was too honest in appear-&#xD;
ance for the company he was in was no&#xD;
great discovery for St. Leon to make.&#xD;
As they leaped from the vehicle the&#xD;
elder individual exclaimed,," Come lot's&#xD;
have a drink.&#xD;
" That's me I" was the reply.&#xD;
But, as he stepped upon the veranda,&#xD;
he caught sight of the two women who&#xD;
were just then testing the virtues of&#xD;
another cobbler and punch.&#xD;
The blonde scarcely noticed him, but the&#xD;
brunette gave him one glance only. He&#xD;
was "struck."  The glamour of fascina-&#xD;
tion at first sight was upon him as it has&#xD;
been upon thousands since woman's crea-&#xD;
tion. The miser who would not give a&#xD;
cent to save a fellow being from starvation&#xD;
will barter all he has, and his soul into&#xD;
the bargain, to win the smile of a woman,&#xD;
The glance shot out from those dark&#xD;
eyes acted upon that young man like .a&#xD;
magnet.&#xD;
ie stepped across into the room where&#xD;
they were seated.&#xD;
The mystery of the women and their.&#xD;
object began slowly to develop itself.&#xD;
He bowed. While the.blonde demurely&#xD;
turned partly away the brunette looked&#xD;
him squarely in the face as if to read his&#xD;
character and nature thoroughly, yet her&#xD;
look was not bold. There was a thin pre-&#xD;
tence as if of surprise in it at his temerity.&#xD;
Missing him for the moment his com-&#xD;
panion, the sharper clad in gray, caught&#xD;
sight of him; then went to the threshold&#xD;
of the door and beckoned.&#xD;
But the victim was enthralled. The&#xD;
dark eyes of the brunette were upon him,&#xD;
&#xD;
En&#xD;
&#xD;
43&#xD;
&#xD;
had thrilled him, and he was in for a '&#xD;
"lark."I&#xD;
Was his companion trying to save himI&#xD;
Again he bockonid-the two came to-&#xD;
gether a moment-then St. Leon, still&#xD;
sitting on the veranda, beard the man&#xD;
in gray exclaim, as if thoroughly dis&#xD;
gusted with the   other's infatuation,&#xD;
4 Pve warned you-I've nothing to say.&#xD;
As for me, d--d if IPm to be caught in&#xD;
that way. Im off.n&#xD;
They parted. The younger returned&#xD;
to the women and ordered wine and&#xD;
luncheon, while the 'sharper sprang into&#xD;
the carriage, and drove rapidly away.&#xD;
Presently the party, now seemingly on&#xD;
the best of terms, arose and strolled down&#xD;
towards the beach.&#xD;
Keeping them in sight, St. Leon fol-&#xD;
lowed.&#xD;
The play began to be interesting to him.&#xD;
The brunette and the young gentleman&#xD;
were certainly charmingly intimate for&#xD;
such a short acquaintance. The blonde&#xD;
seemed almost neglected. They went in&#xD;
for a bath.&#xD;
The beach by- this time began to be&#xD;
crowded.&#xD;
After bathing, as they came down from&#xD;
the dressing-house, St. Leon passed them.&#xD;
As he did so he beheld ahead of him&#xD;
and crossing the beach a few hundred&#xD;
yards off, the shaper in gray, whomhe&#xD;
supposed had driven back to the city,&#xD;
and abandoned his friend.&#xD;
A little distance up the shore and sep-&#xD;
arated from a long row of bathing-houses&#xD;
by a wide open space of ridgy sand and&#xD;
stunted grass stood an old desertedshanty,&#xD;
and directly in front of it lay a great heap&#xD;
of seaweed and brush. Still with his&#xD;
face turned toward the group he hurried&#xD;
rapidly toward this shanty. He had&#xD;
scarcely entered it, when three men came&#xD;
out of it walking quietly, and taking a&#xD;
wide circuit, reaching the centre of the&#xD;
beach directiy in a line with the ap-&#xD;
proaching party, who were coming on&#xD;
slowly at some distance behind.&#xD;
As the three then executed this ma-&#xD;
&#xD;
nouvre the sharper at the shanty had&#xD;
placed himself partly in the shadow and&#xD;
stood'gazing toward thbiparty as intently&#xD;
as if he were watching the progress of a&#xD;
desperate battle.&#xD;
The three men halted upon the beach,&#xD;
and one of them soon revealed the nature&#xD;
of their business by the sudden setting up&#xD;
of a three-card monte rig, an exceedingly&#xD;
simplecontrivance. This being done, one&#xD;
or two other apparently disinterested in-&#xD;
dividuals came strolling up. He knew&#xD;
these must be, by their unnistakable&#xD;
" get up," the cappers and steerers for&#xD;
the game.&#xD;
St. Leon turned from them, and lo I di-&#xD;
rectly behind him came the brunette and&#xD;
blonde with their new-found escort. He&#xD;
appeared perfectly happy.&#xD;
Nearer and nearer to this little open-&#xD;
ing for business approached the two girls&#xD;
and their compamon.&#xD;
And nearer, too, sauntered St. Leon.&#xD;
He heard one of the cappers ask the&#xD;
others: " Isthata 'Sat' "between them?7"&#xD;
And the other answered, " Stash it,&#xD;
dy'er ever see Lib without one down&#xD;
here ?"&#xD;
As the party came still nearer to the&#xD;
noble and refining game of three-card&#xD;
monte the rappers began making a great&#xD;
show of being utter strangers to the op,&#xD;
ration and played the part of innocent&#xD;
but interested strangers with a degree of&#xD;
perfection which would have done them&#xD;
credit upon the stage.&#xD;
St. Leon glanced over toward the&#xD;
old shanty. There, still watching like a&#xD;
tireless sentry, stood the sharper.&#xD;
In a few moments more the brunette&#xD;
and her companion, her face flushed with&#xD;
the exercise, and his with excitement over&#xD;
what he considered his easy conquest,&#xD;
while the blonde with no special change&#xD;
in her appearance, except that she had&#xD;
become, as we have seen, upon familiar&#xD;
terms with the "Flat, "  were within&#xD;
reaching distance of the monte table.&#xD;
" Oh, Minnie," said the brunette," there's&#xD;

&#xD;
day-let's look at them. I should like to&#xD;
bet something just for the fun of it."&#xD;
The gallant-who evidently was no ex-&#xD;
pert in the mysteries of this sort of thing&#xD;
-made no objection to the fun. So blind-&#xD;
ed was he in his not-at-all strange in-&#xD;
fatuation for the girl that nothing short&#xD;
of an earthquake could have brought him&#xD;
to kee what a fool he was making of him-&#xD;
self. By listening closely to them&#xD;
St. Leon discovered his name, or rather&#xD;
the one which he had given her. She&#xD;
said, "Come, Mr. Devoe, what time is it 'I&#xD;
Isn't it late?"&#xD;
He took out his - watch-a fine gold&#xD;
English lever, a Frodsham probably-and&#xD;
answered her.&#xD;
The two cappers glanced at it, and at&#xD;
each other.&#xD;
Then for the first time St. Leon noticed&#xD;
a stealthy, almost imperceptible sign of&#xD;
recognition pass between the dealer of&#xD;
the monte and the brunette.&#xD;
So, so, the plot thickens, and is deeper&#xD;
than we thought.&#xD;
The " tuae of day " was then a stall,&#xD;
that the cappers and dealer could learn&#xD;
at sight the value of the victim's watch.&#xD;
The gambling valuation of such an&#xD;
article is averaged at one hundred dollars&#xD;
for a gold, and twenty-five for a silver&#xD;
"ticker."-&#xD;
Meanwhile he watched the proceedings&#xD;
closely.&#xD;
" I'll bet ten dollars, Minnie," said the&#xD;
brunette, "I can tell what card that is."&#xD;
" Well." said the dealer, "I don't like&#xD;
to bet with ladies, ma'am - but just forthp&#xD;
fun of it, I will."&#xD;
So the bet was made, much against the&#xD;
will of the young man, the " Flat."&#xD;
She placed her finger upon the card.&#xD;
It was turned, and she had guessed&#xD;
right and won.&#xD;
The dealer doesn't mind the loss but&#xD;
smiles over it as if it were a matter of&#xD;
course that he should lose. He now takes&#xD;
up three cards.&#xD;
" Perhaps the ladies and gentlemen&#xD;
think these cards are too much worn. I'll&#xD;
change them for a new set.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
TEE CONTINUATION OF THE LITTLE GAME..&#xD;
As he spoke he made a motion to place&#xD;
them in the breast pocket of his coat.-&#xD;
" No, no, we don't want 'em changed,"&#xD;
said one of the cappers, "let 'em be;&#xD;
them's good enough."&#xD;
"Of course we know these, and new&#xD;
ones might not be so lucky for us. Be-&#xD;
sides," this she said to her victim, that is&#xD;
his name now; "I'm going to win some-&#xD;
thing more."&#xD;
"Very well," said the dealer. "Just as&#xD;
you say." But even as lie spoke and&#xD;
withdrew his hand from his pocket, St.&#xD;
Leun saw that he had changed the cards&#xD;
and produced a new set.&#xD;
"No, no change; I'll hide the same&#xD;
three." He threw the cards upon his im-&#xD;
provised table.&#xD;
" Now then," continued the dealer, "I'll&#xD;
bet three hundred dollars that no gentle-&#xD;
man can turn the jack of hearts. Any&#xD;
gentleman can bet; I'm ready. Three&#xD;
hundred dollars that no gentleman can&#xD;
turn the jack of hearts! "&#xD;
"I haven't so much money as that,"&#xD;
said the brunette, throwing one of her&#xD;
witching glances at her victim, at the same&#xD;
time, with a pretended sigh of regret,&#xD;
looking into her peat little pocket-book.&#xD;
" What an awful sum of money that is!&#xD;
But if I had it I'd bet it that I know which&#xD;
is the jack of hearts as you call it.'&#xD;
Was innocent simphcity ever so charm-&#xD;
ingly imitatedI&#xD;
" Yes, and so would I," chimed in the&#xD;
blonde, with a fascinating naivete, and&#xD;
giving the 'FlatI the benefit of a be-&#xD;
witching glance with her blue eyes.&#xD;
Then one of the cappers put in his verbal&#xD;
oar, speaking, however, in a tone just loud'&#xD;
enough to be heard only by the two women&#xD;
and their prey, "Let's raise the money&#xD;
among us, each put up what we've got.&#xD;
Miss there got the card dead sure."&#xD;
" What's the use of putting up so high I&#xD;
You know none of us ain't got no such&#xD;
stake as three hundred dollars! Come now&#xD;
let u, a bit," said the other capper to the&#xD;
dealer.&#xD;
&#xD;
At this instant, St. Leon standing near&#xD;
and apparently an uninterested speaker,&#xD;
thought of the sharper who had driven the&#xD;
light wagon up to the hotel.&#xD;
He looked'over toward the old shanty.&#xD;
The man was there, but he had moved&#xD;
back a little further into the shadow, and&#xD;
bis foot was no longer resting upon the bit&#xD;
of seaweed.&#xD;
Still his gaze was fixed upon the group&#xD;
around the three-card monte game, and he&#xD;
seemed as motionless as the wind-wrecked&#xD;
shanty beside him.&#xD;
"Not a cent less than three hundred&#xD;
dollars, gentlemen," said the dealer in that&#xD;
hard metalic tone peculiar to his class, and&#xD;
with'a pretense of not noticing the two&#xD;
women.&#xD;
St. Leon drew still closer, forhe saw that&#xD;
the plot of the swindlers was rapidly cul-&#xD;
minating to a finale of success. Blindly&#xD;
lured to his fate through his infatuation&#xD;
for the dark-eyed enchantress whose hand&#xD;
at that moment carelessly, as if by acei-&#xD;
dent, rested upon his shoulder, the young&#xD;
man drew his pocket-book.&#xD;
"Let me see, ladies, how we can fix it.V&#xD;
Then turning to the brunette-"  you're&#xD;
sure you know the card 1"&#xD;
She gave hima glance-that was enough.&#xD;
Away with caution, common sense;, their&#xD;
power melted away before.'the burning&#xD;
sensual sparkle of the "trained wanton's&#xD;
eyes like ice in the heat ot the summer&#xD;
sun.&#xD;
"Let me see," he repeated, taking out a&#xD;
roll of bills.&#xD;
We'll go in fifty dollars-twenty-five a&#xD;
piece," said each of the cappers.&#xD;
"You're ,very obliging," said the bru-&#xD;
nette, laughing. "Well,'here's my ten."&#xD;
"4Poor me, and I've nins," said the&#xD;
blonde.&#xD;
At this moment, as the young man was&#xD;
counting the roll of bills, we saw the dark-&#xD;
eyed sorceress look tiowrd the old'slinty,&#xD;
where stood the sharper; she gave a nod.&#xD;
ie answered the signal by one in re-&#xD;
St. Leon 'would have gi4exi something&#xD;
handsome in the way of rewardif the vic-&#xD;
&#xD;
1!&#xD;
&#xD;
tim could have seen just then what we&#xD;
did.&#xD;
" Now, then," he said, here'ss two hun-&#xD;
dred dollars."&#xD;
"And here's my ten," put in the bru-&#xD;
nette.&#xD;
"No, keep that," said the victim as un-&#xD;
conscious as a babe of the stall being&#xD;
played upon him. "This is all I've got,&#xD;
but you're suie you know the card I Yes.&#xD;
Then we're all right, and we'll have a gay&#xD;
old wine supper over our winnings."&#xD;
" Come, gentlemen," said the dealer&#xD;
"There's my three hundred dolla-,s, solid&#xD;
cash, nothing less."&#xD;
"Oh cme," said one of the cappers.&#xD;
"This gentlemen's got two hundred, and&#xD;
here's our fifty ; call it an even bet of&#xD;
two-fifty."&#xD;
"Not a red less than than three hun-&#xD;
dred. If the gentleman with the two&#xD;
hundred hasn't any moro money conve-&#xD;
nient, and he's so sure of winning, I'll give&#xD;
him a chance; I'll take his check for the&#xD;
balance, or any kind'of security."&#xD;
The victim's pride was touched. He&#xD;
had waded into the stream; - ware he to&#xD;
falter or show the white feather now, hO&#xD;
would lose his hold of the enchantress at&#xD;
his side.&#xD;
There had gathered eight or ten morb&#xD;
of the strollers on the beach around the&#xD;
spot, and their presence added an ther&#xD;
stimulus to his action.&#xD;
"Oh, I do wish I was near home, rd&#xD;
soon get the money,' exclaimed the bru.&#xD;
nette..&#xD;
That sentence settled it with her b6-&#xD;
witched victim.&#xD;
"l1ere,"he said, taking out his watch and&#xD;
dethching the chain from the button-hole;&#xD;
will this do in place of the extra fifty. It's&#xD;
worth-"&#xD;
" Oh, don't do that," pleaded the bru-&#xD;
nette. "Don't. risk your watch on ac-&#xD;
co6un; of my foolishness. Perhaps, 'fte&#xD;
all I might not tfirn the ight card, and&#xD;

&#xD;
mingled with tnat other and equally as&#xD;
enthralling passion, that of winning.&#xD;
Satan is represented as a male. It is a&#xD;
mistake.  The spirt of cool, heartless&#xD;
calculating evil in one of these woiqen&#xD;
was more'devilish and relentless than that&#xD;
of a dozen Satans. And the ungloved&#xD;
hand of the brunette, as she uttered her&#xD;
hollow plea to prevent hi parting with&#xD;
his watch, was toying with a golden cross&#xD;
suspended from a golden chain over her&#xD;
heart..&#xD;
Satan cowers, so the preachers tell us, in&#xD;
the presence of that symbol; the woman&#xD;
toys with it.&#xD;
" Oh,,pshaw," said the victim. "Here,&#xD;
it's oply for a moment; tai e it."&#xD;
The watch was deposited with the two&#xD;
hundred and the cappers' fifty.&#xD;
"Now then, gentlemen.'&#xD;
The crowd pressed forward.&#xD;
The brunette, with her arm clinging to&#xD;
her prey, who, as the supreme moment&#xD;
which was to decide the wager, approach-&#xD;
ed, became terribly anxious.&#xD;
"If you please," said the brunette, her&#xD;
face lighting up with a gleam of triumph&#xD;
as she reached out her hand towards the&#xD;
three cards.&#xD;
"This is- the ' card, THE JACK  OF&#xD;
HEARTS I "&#xD;
$je turned it.&#xD;
'Every eye was fixed upon the young&#xD;
man's face.&#xD;
The card was the deuce of hea,rts,&#xD;
Watch and money was gone! The&#xD;
dealer gathered in the stakes and put up&#xD;
big eards.&#xD;
"ify God, is it possible," exclaimed the&#xD;
victim, "money, watch-rnot a cent left I"&#xD;
The brunette led him away, and with&#xD;
the witching of her warmly but low spoken&#xD;
expression of sorrow, soon soothed his&#xD;
feelinqgof disappointment.,&#xD;
With the blonde jnd brunette on either&#xD;
side of him,, completely inthe toils, he&#xD;
slowly walked toward the lotel.&#xD;
St. Leon heard the brunette Satan say to&#xD;
him as they passed from his hearing,&#xD;
"Never mind, my ten dollar bill is left.&#xD;
I will' lend it to you. We will have some&#xD;
&#xD;
wine, and when you see me in-" He&#xD;
heard no more then.&#xD;
St. Leon glanced toward the old shanty&#xD;
The sharper was -tiere no more. The&#xD;
monte ,dealer was slowly moving further&#xD;
down the beach followed by the cappers&#xD;
and presently, from behind a row of the&#xD;
dressing houses beyond, emerged the&#xD;
sharper-or really the steeredr " of that&#xD;
profitable job-and joined his fellow&#xD;
swindlers.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
SOME RECOGNITION AND PLANS.&#xD;
Sr. LEON sauntered thoughtfully back&#xD;
to the hotel, reseated himself- upon the&#xD;
veranda and lighted a fresh cigar.&#xD;
The features of therblonde were famil-&#xD;
iar to him, and as for the sharper who had&#xD;
kept solitary vigil at the old slianty-hi%&#xD;
face, too, now came back as one that he&#xD;
had met elsewhere-where he could not&#xD;
recall.&#xD;
As he sat there ruminating upon the&#xD;
probable fate hereafter of the' victim of&#xD;
these male and female swindlers, he felt&#xD;
a tap upon the shoulder.&#xD;
He-looked up.&#xD;
He had heard no step, so that the light&#xD;
and unexpected touch of the hand start-&#xD;
led him from his reverie. He looked up,&#xD;
and beside him stood the blonde heroine&#xD;
of the day's work.&#xD;
" Mr St. Leon, can I speak with you a&#xD;
moment."&#xD;
St. Leon!&#xD;
How should she know his name. Yet&#xD;
as she looked down upon him there came&#xD;
to him the dim photographic 'memory,&#xD;
an indistinct familiarity in the face, but&#xD;
to trace it in its present guise was&#xD;
impossible.&#xD;
He made no betrayal, however, of hi.&#xD;
real thought-he waa too thorough a man&#xD;
of the world for that.&#xD;
"You see I know you, although you ma r&#xD;
not remember ,me--s by,the expression&#xD;
of your features I amIn'clined to thin4&#xD;
, ou do not," said theblonde.&#xD;
"As you are now," he replied yleaa&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
antly,"I certainly admit I do not recog-&#xD;
nize you."&#xD;
" Ah !" she said, and as she spoke she&#xD;
glanced around nervously. "Perhaps I"-&#xD;
she broke off abruptly, and then said in a&#xD;
low tone-" Lib is listening-or rather,&#xD;
both watching and listening."&#xD;
" LibI-OhI "St Leon turned his glance&#xD;
away for the moment.&#xD;
He saw as he said this the sharper of&#xD;
the shanty slowly walking across the&#xD;
sands.&#xD;
"I thought that fellow had disappeared&#xD;
altogether, and there he is," he thought.&#xD;
The blonde seemed to hesitate.&#xD;
Then she whispered-" I will see you&#xD;
again, Mr. St. Leon, in a.few moments."&#xD;
"Very well,"he replied.&#xD;
The sharper came nearer, came up upon&#xD;
the veranda, and merely giving St. Leon a-&#xD;
casual, but as that individual noticed, a&#xD;
shaip inspection-passed on into the bar-1&#xD;
room of thehotel.&#xD;
"I know him now," mentally exclaimed&#xD;
St. Leon. "I recognize him now, as well as&#xD;
if he were an old familiar friend. How&#xD;
the faces of those we detest come back to&#xD;
us ! I know him now."&#xD;
He took from his pocket the photograph&#xD;
of the'man of the St. Denis hotel steps.'&#xD;
"It is the sante, I'll be sworn."&#xD;
While he was looking at it, the blonde&#xD;
came to him again.&#xD;
"Come with me," she said.&#xD;
St. Leon looked up into her face. There&#xD;
was an expression of singular earnestness&#xD;
which impelled him to consent, although&#xD;
he hid his doubts as to her motive.,&#xD;
He followed her. Not into the dining-&#xD;
room, not into any remote portion of the&#xD;
veranda, but to an upstair chamber.&#xD;
Then-the two being there, she closed&#xD;
the door and locked it.&#xD;
St. Leon looked in somewhat of as-&#xD;
tonishment:   ,&#xD;
41 Y ou have locked the door ."'&#xD;
"46Yes.7'&#xD;
49 That is not right)&#xD;
"Every thing, -Mr. St. Leon, is right&#xD;
whbh will bring justice to all."&#xD;
.Certaizly, but what has justice to d&#xD;
&#xD;
with a closed door; 'or an interview be&#xD;
tween strangers I"&#xD;
"Justice has no single abiding place&#xD;
Justice is everywhere. She may choose&#xD;
to bide herself for a while but she wili&#xD;
surely in the end appear. Time is justice.&#xD;
for time brings to all in the end-relief."&#xD;
St. Leon listened. He began to have p&#xD;
better opinion of the blonde.&#xD;
"You wonder at the locking of the door.&#xD;
If you desire it I will unlock it. What I&#xD;
had to,say to you was private; as private&#xD;
positively as the personal bank account of&#xD;
Alex Stewart."&#xD;
" Certainly if what you have to say is&#xD;
private-no better place than this could&#xD;
have been chosen," said St. Leon. "Coney&#xD;
Island is not quite so. public a place as&#xD;
Broadway, to my thinking."&#xD;
"You can be seated if you like, or  f&#xD;
you prefer standing we can converse&#xD;
equally as well. Here "-as she spokeshe&#xD;
handed him the key of the door-" here is&#xD;
the.key, you can keep it until our inter-&#xD;
view ceases. You see that I know your&#xD;
name. I, know more of you than that.&#xD;
Now listen to me. I saw you here yester-&#xD;
day, but*I preferred not to acknowledge&#xD;
the recognition. You were close upon us&#xD;
through the whole time we were, down&#xD;
upon the beach. Now, candidly confess to&#xD;
me before I proceed further, what special&#xD;
object had you in view in thus playing the&#xD;
spy upon the party?"&#xD;
, St. Leon smiled. Then he answered--&#xD;
" In what manner will our interview, or&#xD;
what you mxay have to say be influenced&#xD;
by such a confession.? However, I will&#xD;
confess so much as this: that in watching&#xD;
you and your confreres in swindiing--"&#xD;
" Swindling 1"&#xD;
"I know no other name for the busi-&#xD;
ness-in watching you, and your cop-&#xD;
freres my principal object was to gee how&#xD;
great a fool a man in the toils .f design-&#xD;
ing women cot1dmake of himself, and how&#xD;
beneath their smiles and losing glances&#xD;
and tender manifestations oft regard they&#xD;
could so adroitly. conceal ,o upuchjoold,&#xD;
heartless depravity."&#xD;
" You're quite a philosopher, S, Leon.&#xD;

'I&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, sir, as an appendix to that frank con-&#xD;
fession, you should add that your own ex-&#xD;
perience in the art of swindling enabled&#xD;
you to more readily appreciate the per-&#xD;
formance of other experts in the same&#xD;
line." )&#xD;
"I was not aware that my character&#xD;
was open to such grave suspicion."&#xD;
" Well, well, this sort of badinage is&#xD;
useless, we can indulge in that amusement&#xD;
at some more fitting opportunity. St.&#xD;
Leon, I said I knew you, yet you do not&#xD;
recognize me 1"&#xD;
"Really, I do not."&#xD;
"Did you recognize the man who&#xD;
passed us but a few moments before we&#xD;
came up here I The same who yesterday&#xD;
came here with Lib's companion '1"&#xD;
"I d not at first, since then I have&#xD;
recalled him; I do know him now, perfect-&#xD;
ly."&#xD;
" Did you recognize the young man who&#xD;
came with him?",&#xD;
69I never saw him before. However, my&#xD;
memory of faces is not always the most&#xD;
perfect, it is like all human attributes-&#xD;
treacherous."&#xD;
"You are married, and it is of your&#xD;
marriage I have to speak, for it is that&#xD;
which has brought about this interview.&#xD;
As I know there is a cloud between&#xD;
you and your wife--a distrust on your part&#xD;
and a fear on hers-"&#xD;
" This is strange knowledge for you, a&#xD;
stranger, to possess in reference to ny&#xD;
private affairs."&#xD;
" She told you she came from New Or-&#xD;
leans, did she not ?"&#xD;
" She-she did."&#xD;
" And she revealed to you a very pretty&#xD;
romance of her own life-eh 1"1&#xD;
St. Leon made no answer. The wotnan&#xD;
&#xD;
before him seemed an enigma.&#xD;
4 She even made you-a man of the&#xD;
world, 'an adventurer-believe it ?"&#xD;
" I have no reason to disbelieve it. Is&#xD;
there no truth in womankindf" he half&#xD;
answered, half questioned, bitterly,&#xD;
She smiled, then a shade of sad earnest-&#xD;
ness crept over her' features as she con-&#xD;
tinued.                     .&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now let me enlighten you. Weeks&#xD;
ago I intended to have seen you personal-&#xD;
ly, but circumstances intervened which&#xD;
postponed the satisfaction of my desire.&#xD;
Your wife never saw New Orleans!"&#xD;
"What !"&#xD;
"Her parents of whom she spoke so&#xD;
affectionately died during her infancy."&#xD;
"Go on-this is becoming interesting."&#xD;
"The man whom you met here but a&#xD;
little while since was her paramour-had&#xD;
been her paramour-her lover if you like&#xD;
the word better-for two years before you&#xD;
saw her for the first time,"&#xD;
" Well!"&#xD;
"But the man who betrayed her, who&#xD;
first led her into the dark depths out of&#xD;
which even your love, or the love of any&#xD;
human being will never lift her, the man&#xD;
who loved her to distraction and, left her&#xD;
heart cold and sordid to all the world&#xD;
beside, is the man who was the victim of&#xD;
the three-card monte game on the&#xD;
beach !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, this is sensational,, whatever&#xD;
may be its veracity. It is a delicious bit&#xD;
of seasoning between the crusts of thispie&#xD;
men call society. Go on, you see I am&#xD;
calm, unruffled, as if I were listening to&#xD;
the pleasant story of a boon companion&#xD;
told over a glass of sparkling hock."&#xD;
"Your wife is my sister / 4&#xD;
"What next '1"&#xD;
"This man, the sharper as you choose&#xD;
to -term him, is not so bad as he seems.&#xD;
He was once what the world calls a re-&#xD;
putable member of society; with his fall,&#xD;
if fall there was in his conduct, I have&#xD;
nothing to do at present."&#xD;
St Leon threw himself back upon a&#xD;
lounge in a half reclining posture.&#xD;
" The name ofthis admirable friend of&#xD;
my wife is Moquard 1" said St. Leon.&#xD;
"Yes-I was not sure you knew it."&#xD;
"How- can I, avoid it when here, upon&#xD;
the back of this photograph of his exebed-&#xD;
ingly attractive countenance, it Is written.&#xD;
Now pray inform me what is the namni of&#xD;

&#xD;
is ghostly hour -f midnight when silence&#xD;
and its sister soltude reigned supreme inI&#xD;
the darkness.',&#xD;
Those who occupied it were of the most&#xD;
ancient of the republican aristocracy.&#xD;
Beside them 'the Shrugga shrank back&#xD;
aghast. Even Jerome Duval envied theseI&#xD;
claimants of the blue blood of the Knick-&#xD;
erbockers,  ,'' I   ,  .  . .      ,&#xD;
The residences of these descndants of&#xD;
the Schweitzer Deadstones, w)o were no4&#xD;
doubt the original Dutch ,wbocaptured&#xD;
Holland, and of the Shruggs, and of the&#xD;
banker Duval were indicative of the char-&#xD;
acter of the occupants.&#xD;
The Shra'gg mansion was -a' bazaar of&#xD;
flash, gilt, arid extravagance - modern,&#xD;
new, and outre, every bit of it.&#xD;
Duval's "home," was costly, magnifi-&#xD;
cent, showing everywhere "ihe pride of&#xD;
wealth but in no part, save Edith's apart-&#xD;
ments, displaying the presence of refine-&#xD;
ment or culture.&#xD;
But the Echo mansion, solid, substan-&#xD;
tial, and old; the furniture heavy and&#xD;
massive, of a fashion then almost forgot-&#xD;
ten, and everything imposing and impres-&#xD;
sive.&#xD;
To be sure, the occupants to.whom we&#xD;
refer were not so much Knickerbocker,&#xD;
save in their exclusiveness, as the Dea4&#xD;
stones who preceded them,,but they were&#xD;
the' top, on the very; topmost knob of&#xD;
the top crust.&#xD;
Judge if you can by these Deadstones&#xD;
*hat appalling beings, how utterly un-&#xD;
approachable to the vulgar crowd were&#xD;
the Schweitzer Deadstones of Manhattan&#xD;
who were intermingled by marriage' with&#xD;
the Diedrichs, thIe Knickerbockers, the&#xD;
Stuyvesants, the Kimmels, the Corlears,&#xD;
and all the rest of those noble fainilies&#xD;
who themselves were the immediate de-&#xD;
scendants of the puissant blooded stock&#xD;
who helped the Dutch to take Holland-.&#xD;
The occupants, the Deadstones,'receiv-&#xD;
ed only the highest class, tolerated the&#xD;
Shrugs and Duvals, an4 were" merely,&#xD;
oidescn4inglj Iffable with such ques&#xD;
tionable tables as Madame the Count-&#xD;
ess Moquard' and St. Leon,&#xD;
&#xD;
With the Trainors, mothervand daugh&#xD;
ter, they were more .than  rdiarily in-&#xD;
miliar, the Trainors being oil verylold&#xD;
stock, and withal, never had 4itermarried&#xD;
any of the lower orders obIlater 4ate.&#xD;
Robert Glen1a swas ma4e weWoD*&#xD;
there through an introduction by one of&#xD;
the "blooded stock," and Gleuham, who&#xD;
had the early history of New York and&#xD;
its ancient burghers at Is tongue's end,&#xD;
quickly~made himself acceptable and was&#xD;
received as one of the veritable  bloods."&#xD;
Here, then, one day Louise Traiuor mak-&#xD;
ing a call, met Glenham.&#xD;
Since bio recognition of her at the&#xD;
Shrgg fete as -being the original of the&#xD;
carte de isitephotograph he had found&#xD;
among the -papers' of -the victim of the&#xD;
Pell, street horror, be had not seen her.&#xD;
He dared not reveal what he knew. of'&#xD;
the fate of her brother,-without incutfting&#xD;
the risk of-himself being exposed, of hav-&#xD;
ing, all his plans come .to naght, and,&#xD;
perhaps, bring with it the suspicion that&#xD;
he was even concerned In bringing about&#xD;
the brother's terrible fate.&#xD;
It was byiner accident that op this&#xD;
particular afternoon Glenham had" drop-&#xD;
ped "into this Peadstone mansion,.&#xD;
Of the Deadstones there, was old:Dead-&#xD;
stone, in ancient-cut. of coat, and pants,&#xD;
patriarchal jeard, goldspectacles, weak&#xD;
voice, sharp nose, few teeth, and a general&#xD;
lai4-onethe-shelf appearance; Mrs. Dead-&#xD;
stope, little, odd,,thin-lipped, loquacious,&#xD;
neatly dressed, kindly in manner, and re-&#xD;
garded by the servants as the .legitinate&#xD;
head of the house; Miss Letitia Deadstone,&#xD;
young, gay, sensible, homely as to feature,&#xD;
elegant as to dress,: with a :good hon-&#xD;
est smile for everybody (so everybody&#xD;
thought who 'accepted what they beheld&#xD;
as gospel truth); and a hearty welcome&#xD;
ever ready for a few of thehigh-tonedfa-&#xD;
vorites she ha4 taken int her confiednce&#xD;
in that lofty circle inyhich they moved.&#xD;
This conmpleted-these three-the fam-&#xD;
fly group at hone.&#xD;
There was a son, but he was off some-&#xD;
where in Europe, playing billiards with&#xD;
foreign nobs, or the deuce with foreign&#xD;
&#xD;
q&#xD;
&#xD;
ladies-at least he wrote so-andhe'never&#xD;
wrote unleEs the necessity Of a fresb' de-&#xD;
posit at his banker's camee necessary.&#xD;
Louise Trainor was one 9f the Miss&#xD;
Deadstone's f&amp;amp;orite, and they we.ie often&#xD;
together.&#xD;
They were so seated together in one of the&#xD;
great parlors, surrounded by a cordon 'of&#xD;
high-backchairs with their grotesque carv-&#xD;
ings Ad solemnly glared down upon by&#xD;
two or three, dim-faced, faded-eyed por-&#xD;
trait3, eind which a battalion of echoes&#xD;
were no doubt lirg in wait ready to&#xD;
bounce out into space at the fist available&#xD;
opportunity.&#xD;
Lis and Letitia seated side by side&#xD;
upon a roomy, 4eep pld sofa, ;were evi-&#xD;
dently' discussing some very, important&#xD;
subject-impp#at atleast pethem-whei&#xD;
the door bell tingled' away down in the&#xD;
basement depths.&#xD;
Then, surroundedbytheusualbodyguard&#xD;
of echoes, came the step of a servant up&#xD;
from those depths into the hall&#xD;
The door was open.'&#xD;
A pause, then the '4or of the parlor&#xD;
was opened and a- stout-bodied narrow-&#xD;
ishouldered servant entered and held out&#xD;
his silver server.&#xD;
Miss Deadttone took'the, card from it.&#xD;
"Robert Glenha'm," she reati; thein&#xD;
turned to Miss litinor- 'am so glad h(&#xD;
has called,Twish youto seehim." To th(&#xD;
servant-'I Show Mi.Glentham in."&#xD;
Bowed the servant and 'retired. 'The&#xD;
fn, a noieint' he re-enteiled annouiicini&#xD;
with due formality and an additional bow&#xD;
'Mr. Robrt Glenhan," and retired t&#xD;
the depths again, his footsteps followed b,&#xD;
the tireless'troupe of echoes.&#xD;
"Goo4 morning,' Mr. Glenhain, T a&#xD;
really happy tlit you have called so op&#xD;
portunely."&#xD;
"Why opporAinely, Miss DeadAtone i&#xD;
queried Glenham, glancing at Miss Train&#xD;
or, wlhon he recognized.&#xD;
"So tat iay have the 'pleasure 4&#xD;
introducing to you one of my friend&#xD;
)iss Louise Trainor, I am sure you---"&#xD;
1 certainlyy can not be, should'not 1&#xD;
&#xD;
ether than delighted with the introduce.&#xD;
tion," replied Glenham.&#xD;
And then the mere'formalityof intro-&#xD;
duction wai observed,'&#xD;
tP-a yladifes, do not illow me to Inter-&#xD;
rupt yont tetc-a-tete, I merelymade a pass&#xD;
ing call.&#xD;
"Don't mentn it, M.'Glenham. Come,&#xD;
take possession of papa's favorite--this&#xD;
Elizabethan chair. It Is-'&#xD;
Thank you," interrupted Glenhan as&#xD;
be obeyed the request, and then turning&#xD;
to Miss Traior he said'.'&#xD;
"I belie-re I had'the pleasure of meet-&#xD;
ing you before,, at 'the reunion at Mrs.&#xD;
,     ' replied 'Louige, o"I saw you&#xD;
thecro, butthere was such a crush, the only&#xD;
wonder is that one saw anybody, unless,"&#xD;
she added in' a somewhat changed tone,&#xD;
"unless one was in search -6f some partio-&#xD;
ulat face;' some particular. person to thLe&#xD;
exclusion of all else."&#xD;
WYou were not thereon that mission&#xD;
I trust I" said Glenham who had, noticed&#xD;
the change in her tone, a faint suspicion,&#xD;
crossing his mind that her werds might&#xD;
have a deeper meaning.&#xD;
t No--no--it was a mere thought , of&#xD;
mine," She changed the subject, "You are&#xD;
fond of the opera, Mr. Gienham'I"&#xD;
'1 am, 'when it is opera and not the&#xD;
'murder of music by a troup of blase, worn&#xD;
artistes who are subsisting upon 'the rep-&#xD;
utation of the voices theyhad generation&#xD;
n ago."&#xD;
S     And Gazzaniga--she is not worn," said&#xD;
: Miss Deadstone.&#xD;
o    "No, not worn in thestrict acceptation&#xD;
y of the term. Her Violetta is as passionate&#xD;
or grand in dramatic action and force as&#xD;
n  whell, a few years ago, I heard her in&#xD;
- Milan."&#xD;
Considering Gldnham had never seen&#xD;
Milan, or been nearer to it thlia the lower&#xD;
- part of(Sandy Hook, his criticism mast be&#xD;
taken at its true 'value.&#xD;
of   But he was safe; he knew neither Miss&#xD;
Ii Trainor or Mish'Deadstone had ever been&#xD;
there, so that the reputation of having&#xD;
be been a trans-Atlantic tourist, and a' so-&#xD;

That evening denham was to nfeet the&#xD;

ally to come upqn him, that by some one,&#xD;
or from some source, who or-what he knew&#xD;
not, there was close at han4 a betrayal&#xD;
of thereality of ,is life-an exposure of&#xD;
his past life, and resulting in' his own&#xD;
degradation.&#xD;
He ha4 had onca or twice before the&#xD;
Aame strange dread of evil to' come, asd&#xD;
it had passed away. , Now it seemed&#xD;
to come-gradually -gathring ,tronger,&#xD;
darker-more awful in its portent.,&#xD;
Who in all the .wide city could fathom&#xD;
his secret&#xD;
Who?    .&#xD;
As he turned at the street crossig the&#xD;
action brought him face to face with--one&#xD;
whom he had seen once before, wlie hie&#xD;
hand was stained with the blood of th&#xD;
brother of Louise Trainor.&#xD;
It was the young man with an old fce&#xD;
high cheekbones, heavy mqustache, keex&#xD;
gray eyes, and croppedbir-Joe Muddler&#xD;
the bar-keeper of t4e corner drbin&#xD;
saloon.&#xD;
Joe was clad in theheight of bar-keepe&#xD;
fashion, but the keen eyes had not for&#xD;
gotten the man of whom he had sai&#xD;
months ago, on that night-" I shan't foz&#xD;
get his face."   ,&#xD;
Therecognition wasmutual-yetteithc&#xD;
betrayed by action his knowledge of th&#xD;
other's individuality.&#xD;
Glenham walked 'on, neither glancin&#xD;
to the right nor left.,&#xD;
The bar-keeper paused a moment aft(&#xD;
&#xD;
Mn. JOE MvDPLEP h 'bar keeper, sallied&#xD;
fqrth from the. hotel, with a suspicious&#xD;
twinkle in his sharp eyes.&#xD;
As if by the . twinkle he'  was' saying&#xD;
to himself "MAh, ah I I don't knowmuch&#xD;
about that fellow; but what I d6, knovi&#xD;
is this: he's, apigeon to l:e plucked, and&#xD;

/ So he cogitated as he strolled' along, al-&#xD;
most retracing Glenham's'walk from the&#xD;
House of the Echoes.,&#xD;
,  As he wanton his way with that pecu-&#xD;
liar swagger which only anEast side Bowr-&#xD;
ery bar-keeper can assume when he is in&#xD;
"luck," he resolved othe matter 1 of Mt.&#xD;
Glenham'slittle affair over and over again,&#xD;

Glenham had passed on, then, as if datfs.&#xD;
fied, continued hisway.&#xD;
But Glenhami was troubled. He knew&#xD;
the bar--keeper recognized -him; 'he felt&#xD;
it-yet he endeavored to' cahin himself&#xD;
with the belief that thit was the end of it.&#xD;
Wasit?&#xD;
If Glenhamn, vas -he ascended tghe steps&#xD;
leading to thd grand entrance of his hotel,&#xD;
had looked around, and quickly, he-would&#xD;
have discovered the fact that Job Muddler,&#xD;
the bar-keeper, had quietlyfollowed 'him&#xD;

And If, after he "had 'seended to his&#xD;

only bar-keepers can solve.&#xD;
'He had, however, made enough, by some&#xD;
occult process best knowito himself, to&#xD;
array, himself in the flashy imitation of a&#xD;
gentleman, tolnake a show offjewelry and&#xD;
secure a position as thei bar-keeper if a&#xD;
fashionable-Broadway skiboh.&#xD;
But desplee6 this exaltation in' rank, he&#xD;
had an ambition to get a little father&#xD;
ahead in 'the "fast line" anid thbrefdre he&#xD;
was not disposed to' lose sight' of any&#xD;
chance by which he'might ~add l"ohis ac-&#xD;

" There was suthi' strange about that'&#xD;

al over, an' it wasn't with cold, 'Llat'a&#xD;
Sure I&#xD;
" Why, Joe, my brick, I thou bt you&#xD;
had stepped out, gone; haven't seen you-&#xD;
for an age."&#xD;
Thus, encountering Joe, exclaimed Mr.&#xD;
Moquard, that amiable gentleman who&#xD;
has already introduced himself as a part&#xD;
and parcel of, this veracious history.&#xD;
Mr. Moquard was clad neatly, but ex&#xD;
pensively.  Evidently he was not suffer-&#xD;
ing for the want of funds.&#xD;
When he addressed Joe tht indmvuai&#xD;
looked up, recognized his acquainta ice,&#xD;
held out his hand, struck anattitue, and&#xD;
aid:&#xD;
"Moke, put it there; shake. How are&#xD;

"Fine-anywhere now I"&#xD;
"Not the old place,, over in Bower"&#xD;

SGdt w     oker,I  you are a genius, you&#xD;

"Prospecling, Joe;,just ambling for the&#xD;
benefit of my health. Suppose we walk&#xD;
together, eh?"&#xD;
This proposition suited Joe, and so the&#xD;
precious pair sauntered on together.&#xD;
'Joe was dealing within himself wheth-&#xD;
er he 'should disclose to his friend and ex-&#xD;
tremely honorable acquaintance, Mr Mo-&#xD;
quard, his ideas concerning Glenham,&#xD;
when tn their stroll they reached the cor-&#xD;
ner of the block in which stood glowering&#xD;
down uppn the street the grept broad-&#xD;
fronted House of the REchoes.&#xD;
Down the wide steps of that house at&#xD;
that niomeut game Louise Trainor, her&#xD;
friend, Letty Deadstone, above upon the.&#xD;
threshold of the door bidding her a laugh-&#xD;
ing good-bye and then disappearing.&#xD;
Miss Trainor turned her steps toward&#xD;
the corner from which Joe Muddler and&#xD;
guard were sl0ly advancing,&#xD;
- Absorbeain thought she dfd not notice&#xD;

cugied in ,a strategic effort to obtain an&#xD;
apple from the stand without the troyible&#xD;
and expense9f havingto pay for it.&#xD;
Miss T;lno s glance fell upon Joe&#xD;
Muddler an Moquard.&#xD;
The moment she beheld Moquard she&#xD;
uttered an exclamation of surprise, end&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ments at the great hotel - scheming, plan&#xD;
ning, and plotting to gather in her prey.&#xD;
Madame Moquard,, so far as, her ap-&#xD;
quaintance:with Glenham was convergedt,&#xD;
had no designs upon his pea ce find or&#xD;
upon his money. She had rather a liking&#xD;
for the grave, cynical, quiet man. There&#xD;
was nothing in this liking akip to love,&#xD;
and certainly nothing of passion, it was&#xD;
simply a liking---a desire, to win 'his es,&#xD;
teem, his friendship.&#xD;
To her, pariah that she,was, the friend-&#xD;
ship of one human being-4 friendship&#xD;
that would be thoroughly useful, with no&#xD;
admixture of the grosser, characteristic&#xD;
which so often leaven that best of all hu-&#xD;
manfeelings-would be a blessing, a source&#xD;
of happiness,, she would -not readily cast&#xD;
So, with what toppqrtuPity, offered in&#xD;
the way of meeting Glenham, she did:4er&#xD;
best to gain the prize,, and with her we..&#xD;
man's tact, and the natural spq*uqenfe of&#xD;
hotel life, yhere occasions oPe day or an-:&#xD;
other for chance eagounters. are rarely&#xD;
lacking, it is et strange that .she,, by-&#xD;
andsby,. partially succeeded in her pur-&#xD;
pose. -&#xD;
When they Met st table, it came to pass&#xD;
that they began to regard# .ealothUr as&#xD;
old acquaintancess , neither, o Wever,&#xD;
knowing or caring to inquire intothe pagt&#xD;
life or-history oftheother.,.- I&#xD;
Glenhad's past wAs as a volyqme which&#xD;
he had sealed up and 14d, away from all&#xD;
mo4aisight or thought, ni4as for madame&#xD;
Moquard's, what eggd he for that? 3-Both&#xD;
were willing to..acceptsthe present, gad&#xD;
use it as wiely.for thir own purposes of&#xD;
enjoyment 'and schemes as they could.&#xD;
 Glenhanwith that aoutenesswhich had&#xD;
grown upon him through the. bitteiZ ex.:&#xD;
periences.of the past, readily understood&#xD;
that she was a schemer, and that she too,&#xD;
like~himself, was alone in the world,, and&#xD;
working-to accomplish a hiddenpurpose-&#xD;
some d4ep-lIaid speme,; but he also saw&#xD;
that, init orwith ise did not seek to&#xD;
Incjlidhim as one otfhey pnppets.&#xD;
And, although he knew, it not, she read&#xD;
hi mental page equally as clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
So, why should not this pair be what in&#xD;
society ie called friends,?&#xD;
And what more appropriate place for&#xD;
the fonatjon or continuance of such&#xD;
friegidsbip than a fashjonable hopel, which,&#xD;
in itself, is, a social world-the duplicate&#xD;
of the p!etences,,luxury, dress, and extra-&#xD;
vagance of that mogstrqps sham, "our&#xD;
best society"-thatupper-crugt of metro-&#xD;

As, ft St. Legn-the men whom she had&#xD;
accepted for a, husband, ap4 from whom&#xD;
she had drifted, away; a bold, unsgrupu-&#xD;

affection.&#xD;
That one was Abel Kramp, the cashier&#xD;
,Abel Kramp, with' 'his single piercing&#xD;
gray eye, his deformed back,' thick un-&#xD;
gainly body, hook nose, 'thin lips, and'&#xD;
weird look-this man Gleihani had not,&#xD;
thought of.&#xD;
It so happened that late one afternoon,as&#xD;
Glenham   was crossing  the' pavement'&#xD;
from the entrance of:a store in onecof the&#xD;
avenues, where he had'beenmtaking some&#xD;
trifling purchases,' to', his '-carriage, he&#xD;
-noticed a crowd gathethd atth cornier of&#xD;
the street, but-a feW paces distant.&#xD;
Curiosity prompted 'him to ascertain&#xD;
the cause.&#xD;
Pushing through the throng, he saw&#xD;
lying upon the pavement a mal, evident-&#xD;
ly in great pain..&#xD;
As a niatter of course, as is always the&#xD;
case, precisely when be is *ranted and his'&#xD;
presence is:necessary, ho policemanWas&#xD;
present. No doubt he was iiound tbe&#xD;
corner in some 'retired doorway- resting,&#xD;
himself, or in a seeladed area conversing&#xD;
with' an amiable young housemaid con-,&#xD;
&#xD;
ham..&#xD;
"No, sir," was the reply.,&#xD;
What is- the matter with him, do you&#xD;
know" i.queried (4leaham.&#xD;
"lHe was crossing the street here, and a&#xD;
couple of carniagesv'were coming around the&#xD;
corner in opposite dire'tions,both driving&#xD;
fast. He saw them both, butin dodging one&#xD;
he got in the wayof the other,:4ndwis run&#xD;
'over, Them hackmen.ought to be hung&#xD;
by the heels to'a lamppost, sir.",&#xD;
As yet no policeman.&#xD;
Glenham bent'closer.to the'enuerer.&#xD;
There: was 'no writhing of the'limb$;&#xD;
only &amp;amp;.low intermittent moaning.&#xD;
Just then the zpri turned' his :head so&#xD;
that he was face:to face with ,lenban.&#xD;
" George Jaffray-alive "&#xD;
Glenhan. at the-samne time 'reognised&#xD;
the victim. '     '&#xD;
":Abel Kranip 1" he exclaimed, invblun-&#xD;
tarily.&#xD;
Of all the men in the world tlie cashier&#xD;
'had been absent from his memory.&#xD;
 I Am 'glad yo-i-you aren't dead&#xD;
"I am badly hurt -hirt,"hoined Abel.&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Can you-can you get me a carriage 'to&#xD;
take me home-"&#xD;
Glenhan would not have refused such a&#xD;
&#xD;
67&#xD;
&#xD;
favor, at least.&#xD;
"Why, Abel, my carriage is at the&#xD;
cur b.. Tell me where you live, and I will&#xD;
see you safely home. I hope you are not&#xD;
badly hurt. Come, let me raise you up.&#xD;
Once in my carriage, and then you can tell&#xD;
me where your home is."&#xD;
Then, turning to the crowd of lookers-&#xD;
on, who were pressing closely upon him,&#xD;
Glenham said:&#xD;
"tand back-more room here."&#xD;
The man opposite, to whom Glenham&#xD;
had first -spoken, and who was still be-&#xD;
side Abel, proffered his assistance in rais-&#xD;
ing him from the pavement.&#xD;
Carefully they lifted Abel to his feet,&#xD;
and slowly led him, weak, trembling and&#xD;
moaning; to the carriage.&#xD;
So far as they knew, or as he feebly ex-&#xD;
pressed himself,"there seemed to be no&#xD;
fracture of his 'limbs; whatever injury&#xD;
there might be was internal.&#xD;
The crowd, as in duty bound,'followed&#xD;
them, and pressed closely up to the car-&#xD;
riage-door.&#xD;
No policeman as yet had appeared.'&#xD;
Everybody had an observation to make&#xD;
and all sorts'of advice to give, and each&#xD;
individual was positive'that if his advice&#xD;
should be taken there Would be no further&#xD;
trouble.&#xD;
To all the suggestions and advice Glen-&#xD;
ham made 'no reply.&#xD;
He heard and saw only Abel.&#xD;
A' mind was busy with the peril of&#xD;
this unexpected discovery by Abel of his&#xD;
identity, and of how he could, 'either to&#xD;
secure the cashier's silence, in case 'he re-&#xD;
covered from his injuries, whatever they&#xD;
might be, or failing in that, how he 'could&#xD;
best turn it otherwise to his advantage.&#xD;
Once he had deposited Abel in the car-&#xD;
riage he asked him Ins place of residence.&#xD;
The cashier told him.&#xD;
t was in one of the up-town cross&#xD;
streets on the6eatside.&#xD;
Giving his doahman the poper direc-&#xD;
-divso and bidding the man that had as-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
sisted hhn, and who was evidently expect-&#xD;
ing ai invitation to accompany the party,&#xD;
a curt and somewhat unceremonious adieu,&#xD;
Gleiham entered the carriage. and was&#xD;
driven off, leaving the crowd to slowly&#xD;
disperse in search of some other sensation&#xD;
around which it might gather, and waste&#xD;
tine in the gratification of its morbid ap-&#xD;
petite.'&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
ABEL KRAMP'S LAST RIDE.&#xD;
THE ride of Glenham'with the disabled&#xD;
cashier was not a long one, and the car-&#xD;
riage, in accordance with the direction&#xD;
given the coachman, drew up at the place&#xD;
indicated.&#xD;
It was not a pleasant orcleanly ihorough-&#xD;
fare in which Abel Kramp had'his abode;&#xD;
it was one' of those arrow' unsavory&#xD;
streets, lined on either side by tall tene-&#xD;
ment-houses, with their narrow dark en-&#xD;
.trances through which, :ut and in all day&#xD;
long, careered ragged, dirty-faced, frowsy-&#xD;
headed ,children, lean, hungry-looking&#xD;
dogs, while slouchy women in drabbled&#xD;
dresseslingered about the pavement in&#xD;
little groups, gossiping over the-troubles&#xD;
of the little wretched world, in which&#xD;
poverty had thrown them.&#xD;
, It was before one of these tall tenement-&#xD;
hoses.that the carriage drew up.&#xD;
The sight of such an equipage was a&#xD;
rarity in that neighborhood-an ambu-&#xD;
lance, a pie wagon, or a cheap hearse, with&#xD;
its. dingy decorations and the necessary&#xD;
cheap hack. followingit, were the most&#xD;
expensive vehicles usually visiting the&#xD;
locality.&#xD;
Consequently the wopen -thereabout&#xD;
ceased their, gossip, thep ragged .children&#xD;
ceased their play and er9wded up toIsee&#xD;
the iwpnted show of a private carriage&#xD;
with a liveried driver.&#xD;
Glenham was the firat te alight after&#xD;
the coachman had openedthe door.&#xD;
"On the third floo-third fluo, Mr.&#xD;
Jaffray," saidAbel. " Tere, thae the en-&#xD;
trance."&#xD;

After a brief but.thorodigh examination,&#xD;
and a few 'questions to Abel, which were&#xD;
answered as well as he was able, Dr.&#xD;

of life. Of all men in the world he knew&#xD;
Abel Kramp could if he chose give him&#xD;
this information.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
"'OUT OF A DREAM INTO THE REALITY."&#xD;
GLENHAM administered to Abel the&#xD;
medicine in accordance with the direction&#xD;
of the physician, and after a while the&#xD;
cashier seemed to obtain an almost com-&#xD;
plete respite from pain. He lay there calm,&#xD;
quiet, and apparently little inclined to'&#xD;
converse. He made no motion or attempt&#xD;
to speak, save now and then to ask for&#xD;
water.&#xD;
By-and-by Glenham discovered that he&#xD;
was sleeping as quietly as a child. The&#xD;
breathing was regular, and his pulse beat&#xD;
as evenly as if no physical derangement&#xD;
had occurred.&#xD;
Glenham, as the moments crept on, be-&#xD;
gan to feel, in the silence and loneliness&#xD;
of the dimly-lighted room, a drowsiness&#xD;
creeping upon his senses, and, in that&#xD;
half waking, half unconscious state, he ap-&#xD;
peared'to have two separate conditions of&#xD;
existence. He imagined himself to Le by&#xD;
the bedside of Abel, and at the same time&#xD;
sitting in one of the great shadowy parlors&#xD;
of the House of Echoes, conversing witlA&#xD;
Miss Trainor, talking to her of Abel&#xD;
Kramp and his accident, and speak-&#xD;
ing to Abel concerning Miss Trainor;&#xD;
and amid this strange duplication of&#xD;
himself and the confused jangle of&#xD;
thought and incident there came a&#xD;
shadow, and, preceded, followed, and&#xD;
surrounded by troops of echoes at every&#xD;
step, entered Jerome Duval, with the&#xD;
thin, ghastly, death-stricken face, and&#xD;
upon his arm leaned his daughter Edith,&#xD;
she, too, deathly pale ; and both father&#xD;
and daughter with their eyes fixed upon&#xD;
&#xD;
him with terrible earnestness.,- Slowly&#xD;
they moved towards him, andas they did&#xD;
so Abel Kramp's presence intervened,&#xD;
and then all faded, or seemed to fade, or&#xD;
rather, dissolved into, another-a vast&#xD;
graveyard, with a leaden-grey sky glow-&#xD;
ering over it, while as faras the eye could&#xD;
reach, row after row of graves stretched&#xD;
away like the furrows and hillocks of a&#xD;
newly-plowed field.I&#xD;
Then again before him stood Jerome&#xD;
Duval, withEdith, bending beside a grave,&#xD;
sunken, overgrown with 'weeds, and un-&#xD;
marked. Something, as if it were a whis&#xD;
per borne to his- hearing upon the wind,&#xD;
murmured in his ear, "Mary lies here-&#xD;
Mary, the sister of Edith."&#xD;
And out of this weird phantom of his,&#xD;
drowse grew another, a wild, desolate sea-&#xD;
beach, upon which the waves were dash-&#xD;
ing up and wrestling together like bat-&#xD;
tling monsters. The flash of a signal-gun&#xD;
of distress lightened up the gloom around&#xD;
him,, and in the instant of this terrible&#xD;
illumination he beheld a vessel stranded&#xD;
-upon a ledge of rocks, and upon her decks&#xD;
what seemed a myriad of struggling hu-&#xD;
man beings.&#xD;
- Again the flash and the dull boom of&#xD;
the gun, and, all the life upon the decks&#xD;
was swept away, and upon the summit&#xD;
of one vast wave, which seemed surging&#xD;
toward him and almost overwhelming&#xD;
him, he beheld two lifeless bodies-,horri-&#xD;
,ble, ghastly forms. One more glance-the&#xD;
faces of-the dead were turned toward him.&#xD;
They were the faces of Edith Duval and&#xD;
of the man whose body he robbed in the&#xD;
Pell street basement.&#xD;
With one mighty surge the great wave&#xD;
which bore them up, as a, giant would&#xD;
have held up a couple of children, hurled&#xD;
them at his feet upon the beach.&#xD;
The terror and fright of this distemper-&#xD;
ed vision aroused him.&#xD;
Abel Kramp's hand was grasping his&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
" Why-why -Mr. Jaffray-wlat is the&#xD;
matter ? I have-I-have been trying to&#xD;
rouse you." This much saidAbel, weakly,&#xD;
but with scarcely any of the tremor in his&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN TI&#xD;
voice, which marked his utterance in the&#xD;
early part of the evening.&#xD;
Glenham, with an -effort, arousedhim-&#xD;
self, but the paleness, of his face and the&#xD;
drops of perspiration told how much the&#xD;
mental agony, the swift-chpnging phantas-&#xD;
magoria of his brief drowse, had distress-&#xD;
ed him. 1t was some moments before he&#xD;
thoroughly regained his usual composure&#xD;
-a composure, a control of his feelings&#xD;
which, enabled, him to stolidly repress&#xD;
every impulse or thought which might&#xD;
divert him from the bitter task .to which&#xD;
he was devoting his life-1evenge.&#xD;
"1Abel," he said, "did I frigtten you?&#xD;
I was tired-and the silence around me&#xD;
irresistibly droye me ipto this drowse., I&#xD;
must have slept. sound, had some ugly&#xD;
dreams, too, if I.remember right. Well-&#xD;
well!..Wh.y," looking at his watch, "past,&#xD;
twelve; no wonder it, is so quiet around&#xD;
hereit is time for, your medicine, Abel.&#xD;
You seem much better: your sleep, at least,&#xD;
has done.you, good,"  ,&#xD;
.t I feel easier; not,;mich pain; butI&#xD;
am weaker., While I slept, Mr. Jaffray-I&#xD;
can call you by that name now that there&#xD;
are none here to-.&#xD;
"1Oh, certainly," said Glenham, as .,he&#xD;
busied himself dropping the medicine into&#xD;
a gloss.&#xD;
"iWhile I. slept I dreamed my life&#xD;
through, all its troubles, its hopes.- I&#xD;
lived years in minutes. they say that&#xD;
such a dream to the sick is a forerunner&#xD;
of-of death."&#xD;
"An idle. fancy," replied  Glenham.&#xD;
"1Here, take this."&#xD;
Abel raised himself partially and oey&#xD;
ed, then fell back upon his pillow.&#xD;
f" An idle fancy," repeated, Glenham,&#xD;
" at least-" he paused, ganged at Abel&#xD;
and toolj him by the hand which lay upon&#xD;
his breast.&#xD;
" Abel)" Glnat voice lowered and&#xD;
despite his effort to-repress it, there was a&#xD;
tremor in hi, utterance.&#xD;
Abel's soittary eye glanced toward the&#xD;
lamp. "Mr. Jaffray, turn up the lamp,&#xD;
'make it lighter."&#xD;
-Glenham arranged the lamp, placed it&#xD;
&#xD;
HE CRIUSTS.                        7i&#xD;
upon a little table by the bedside, and then&#xD;
reseating himself, again took Abels hand&#xD;
in his own. Now the solitary eye was&#xD;
fixed upon him.&#xD;
"Abel," he said, "I trust you will not&#xD;
permit whatas about to say to you-":&#xD;
Glenham remembered, as hie began, the&#xD;
words' of Dr. Pillule  "i could do no&#xD;
good should I cat again $bfore morning.&#xD;
4fter tiiat you had better, as gently aspossi-&#xD;
ble, bring him to a knowlege o] his true con-&#xD;
dition."&#xD;
Buthe also remembered that should he&#xD;
wait until after the physician had called&#xD;
it might be too late. Besides, siould,in&#xD;
the erly morning, Duval 'learn of bia&#xD;
cashier' condition, heImight be confront-&#xD;

" Better,"argued Glenham, in the'selfish-&#xD;
ness of his soul, bett r a lnhadred Abel&#xD;
Kramps should die than such a meeting'&#xD;
should occur.'&#xD;
So it was, as he sat there, that he re-&#xD;
solv'ed to reveal to Abel Krainp h)is true&#xD;
condition.&#xD;
"Abel, what i ani about io' say to you&#xD;
is a sad revelation, which concerns you-"&#xD;
he hesitated,. then began again. " The&#xD;
doctor informed me that-"&#xD;
The -solitary eye ,xed, upon him as&#xD;
he spoke, and watched' the changes of&#xD;
Glenham's e  iitenance and his hesi-&#xD;
tancy. "Mr. 3Mfrayspeak it out. If the&#xD;
doctor hais 'said I ani to die'of my hurts,&#xD;
let me know it. I am firmer stuff than you&#xD;
im-imnagine."&#xD;
A "I am glad to hear it, Abel. I-the&#xD;
doctor-"&#xD;
"Says I can not recover, is that it "&#xD;
There was not a tremor in the cashier's&#xD;

"So be it. God's will be. done!" said&#xD;
Abel Kramp, There was a solemnity iiM"&#xD;
hi' tone ililchli for the moment 'awed&#xD;
Gienham.     *&#xD;
"Mr.. Jaffray, I havesopie papers to irii&#xD;
trust to you, which you will not receive&#xD;
until after-afei I amn oit of the wo-Ad.&#xD;
See! ' I, have,tfie keys-here,-open that&#xD;
book-case, take, down from the second'&#xD;

Glenham took the keys.&#xD;
" Now," tlioight he, 'is my tine."&#xD;
He took the~volume from the shelf.&#xD;
" Brig it here," said Abel.&#xD;
Glenhapi handedO him the work, It was&#xD;
in ordinary binding, somewhat worn.&#xD;
"You will not' leave me until -until all&#xD;
is over?" There was a tremulous* ex-&#xD;
pression of anxiety in his tone.,&#xD;
"You may be sure of that,' s'aid Glen-&#xD;
ham.&#xD;
"I am grateful. N ow," the cashier said&#xD;
as he opened the book "do you 'se, as&#xD;
I turn the pages," he turned them slowly,&#xD;
but not leaf by'leaf, "that here and there&#xD;
certain letters are underscored"by the&#xD;
mark, lightly made, of a peiicilI"  .&#xD;
As he spoke he p6tiitud out at random&#xD;
on the different- pages a letter here and&#xD;
there which wap sidesignated.&#xD;
I see them,, said, Glenhamn, somewhat&#xD;
puzzled as to what Macanilays History of&#xD;
,England and these marked letter's had to&#xD;
do with' the pagers to which the cashier&#xD;
had alluded.&#xD;
Abel Kramp closed the book and placed&#xD;
it under his pillow.&#xD;
When I am gone take the book away&#xD;
with you. Then begin at the nineteenth&#xD;
page, and by taking each letter as it occurs,&#xD;
through, until you reach the thirty-ninth&#xD;
page, you will find the direction' which&#xD;
will place within your hands the papers&#xD;
of which I have spoken. Read themi, and&#xD;
act as yon see fit.' I-I will be beyond&#xD;
all reach of whatever harm may occur&#xD;
from their use."&#xD;
Glenham saw that the period to Which&#xD;
Dr. Pillule had referred in the 04Wndition&#xD;
of his patient was at hand.&#xD;
"He may seem to grow stronger."&#xD;

Evidently Abel Kramp had . grown&#xD;
strong. 'there were no more expres-&#xD;

His face was ealm, atid the solitary feye&#xD;
as clear and bright, as the lamplight fell&#xD;
upon it, as if the glaze of death were an&#xD;
hundred years away.&#xD;
Stronger! 'So auch so'that Glenham&#xD;
began to feel that there was a chance of'&#xD;
life, despite' Dr. Pillulel' assertions.,&#xD;
But it did not deceive Abel.&#xD;
He knew that death was near. He knew&#xD;
that 'his present return of strength, and&#xD;
the clearness of'his mental' faculties, were&#xD;
but the last transient faash of the life-&#xD;
light ere it went out forever.'&#xD;
Stronger! why he feit strong enough&#xD;
to hae arisen from his beBd and' gone,&#xD;
about his Usual avocations.&#xD;
"Mr. Glenham," he said, "you may&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
LETTERS FROM AN OLD TRUNK AND&#xD;
WHAT THEY DID.&#xD;
qLEN.HAM looked at his watch. Tho&#xD;
monients were slowly creeping on toward&#xD;
the dawn.&#xD;
He began to grow impatient. Perhaps&#xD;
the eashjer's strength would fail before his&#xD;
story was.finished.&#xD;
But there was as yet no quiver in his&#xD;
tone; he seemed rather to grow stronger,&#xD;
and the solitary eye brighter and' more&#xD;
expressive.&#xD;
And as Glenham noted this he began&#xD;
to wonder within himself if after all the&#xD;
doctor might not have been mistaken in&#xD;
hsrassertion.&#xD;
This young girl came to, the banking-&#xD;
house guite often-two or three times a&#xD;
eek. Upon the occasion, of her first&#xD;
visit t, nd that was when I saw her for&#xD;
the fir t time, she inquired for Mr. Duval.&#xD;
She was well clad, not expensively, but&#xD;
neatly, as if she might, perhaps, be the&#xD;
daughter ,of a tradesinan in comfortable&#xD;
pircunstances. I. showed her into Du-&#xD;
va}'s private office.&#xD;

&#xD;
felt that the deformed, 'ungainly Abel&#xD;

my fate was fixed.&#xD;
"The next day, or the day after, she&#xD;
camJ., again, smiled upon me, and there&#xD;
seemed to be an unfathomable depth of&#xD;
yearning love in the glance of her blue&#xD;
eyes, blind fool that I was, to think it&#xD;
I scarcely dared trust myself-to speak to&#xD;
her in the presence of the clerks about me,&#xD;
as I conducted her to the private office.&#xD;
I do not care to relate-how, within two or&#xD;
three weeks, the net was woven which en-,&#xD;
meshed me, how she won mewithher wiles,&#xD;
her fascination and apparently guileless&#xD;
innocence. It. is enough to say that we&#xD;
'were married. She was, so I was led.to&#xD;
believe, poor and friendless, with only&#xD;
Jerome Duval as her, dependence. .How I&#xD;
worshiped her as I led her from the&#xD;
presence of the minister who performed&#xD;
the marriage .service to. our-our home-&#xD;
here, Mr. Jaffray, here in these very&#xD;
rooms. Duval, made ,me a present of a&#xD;
watch and chain, the same I now wear,&#xD;
gave me .n increase of salary, and I be.&#xD;
gan to think .in the midst of my new-&#xD;
found happiness that Jerome Duval's&#xD;
stern stolidity, his grasping greed, hie&#xD;
haughty, overbearing demeanor were af-&#xD;
ter all only the cloak which hid from the&#xD;
world a kindly heart, generous nature&#xD;
and the goodness of the Christian. Nel'&#xD;
lie-that was her name, apparently idol&#xD;
ized me-and returning home to her pre&#xD;
sence after business hours from the dul&#xD;
round of work in the banking-house&#xD;
seemed like coming out of the darknes&#xD;
into the full glory of a paradise. Bu&#xD;
then came darkness, the terrible darknes&#xD;
which engulfs the soul and crushes ou&#xD;
the light of hope, a darkness more awful&#xD;
than that of death itself. One day-we ha&#xD;
then been married four months-I cam&#xD;
home rather earlier than usual. She ha&#xD;
gone out, probably on some trivial shop&#xD;
ping errand. I had a pass-key by which&#xD;
could enter at all times. Into this ver&#xD;
room I came. I busied myself a whil&#xD;
in looking over some papers-bills, rc&#xD;
&#xD;
',&#xD;
&#xD;
ceipts,and memoranda. There wasia small&#xD;
trunk in one corner of the room in which&#xD;
Nellie--how Ihate the naamq-kept sundry&#xD;
odds and ends of ribbons, lace, and a few&#xD;
keepsakes and trinkets, which she said had&#xD;
once belonged to her mother. Some evil&#xD;
or good spirit, thought, or whatever you&#xD;
may call the sudden feeling pf curiosity&#xD;
which came upon me, prompted me to&#xD;
notice that it was unlocked, the key re-&#xD;
mainingin the lock, led me to raise the&#xD;
lid, and with no more than the vague&#xD;
idea of satisfying this curiosity to exam-&#xD;
ino Ats contents. In one corner there&#xD;
was a little pasteboard box, tied around&#xD;
with half a dozen findings of tape and&#xD;
securely tied.&#xD;
" Twice I passed over the box, the last&#xD;
time as I was about closing the lid, when&#xD;
there came again that strange, irresistible&#xD;
feeling of curiosity- a feeling foreign to&#xD;
my nature-to open the box and - learn&#xD;
what it contained, 'Some trinkets, me-&#xD;
mentos, perhaps,' I thought. At last I&#xD;
yielded,,I lifted it out and opened it. It&#xD;
held nothing but' two packages qf letters,&#xD;
not old letters, either, as you might sup-&#xD;
pose. Drawing one at random from one&#xD;
of the packages I opened it and read it.&#xD;
Had it been my death sentence it could&#xD;
not have appalled me more. My brain&#xD;
fairly reeled. It was-it was--"&#xD;

Presently the" writhing  ceased. The&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;

" Poon tellowy" said Glenham, "his is&#xD;
another journey ended;- another atom&#xD;
vanished from ,earth into the earth to&#xD;
make earth. ' Poor patient, plodding,&#xD;
simple, credulous-hearted victim  of a&#xD;

Theoom had become quite light.&#xD;
Reverently and tenderly he folded the&#xD;
hands of the dad across, the stifld breast,&#xD;
and with a lastlook at the rigid features&#xD;
-he drew the :sheet-up over the face and,&#xD;
turned away fora moment.&#xD;
Then, recollecting himself, he stepped to&#xD;
the' bedside and drew from beneath'the&#xD;
pillow the book andthe watch.&#xD;
- ' These .are my .leghey," he thought.&#xD;
He placed the watch in his pocket.&#xD;
At that &amp;amp;instant he heard some one as-&#xD;
cending the stairs.&#xD;
. "The Doctor," said'Glenham-&#xD;
A tap at the door. Glenham locked&#xD;
it.    -&#xD;
Dr. Pillule entered.&#xD;
" Gone? As I thought You see I was&#xD;
,right."&#xD;
Really for the itioment, in his profes-&#xD;
sionalt pride, the, doctor looked pleased,&#xD;
then changing his expression to one more&#xD;
appropriate to him 'who stands in "the&#xD;
presencee :of the majesty of - death, - he&#xD;
added, "Was his death painless-how&#xD;
long since-you were with himj of course?'&#xD;
Glenham answered these ,questions a,&#xD;

"Doctor," said Glenliam, "-I have a&#xD;

"Very well. You have been reading&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV-&#xD;
.JE9OME DUVAL IS SOMEWHAT TROUBLED.&#xD;
Dr. Pillulo Was driven directly to the&#xD;
residence of Jerome Dqval.&#xD;
The eminent Christian and banker had&#xD;
not yet arisen--so the servant who an-&#xD;
swered the summons asserted.&#xD;
"Hand him this qard," said the doctor.&#xD;
"I must see him immediately-it is upon&#xD;
a matter of importance."&#xD;
The servant disappeared, leaving the&#xD;
doctor waitipg upon the threshold of the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
Presently he returned.&#xD;
"Mr. Duval will see you directly, sir,&#xD;
please step this way)'&#xD;
He conducted the doctor to the bank-&#xD;
er's sitting room-the same in which, he&#xD;
was sitting so comfortably long before on&#xD;
that March evening when he read in the&#xD;
afternoon papers of -he terrible death of&#xD;
his daughter, Mary Jafftrar&#xD;
In a few moments the banker, in morn.&#xD;
ing gown and slippers, entered.&#xD;
This is an early visit, doctor, but in&#xD;
n0 wise connected with your professional&#xD;
duties I trupf- 7&#xD;
ePartly. I came to inform you that yes-&#xD;
terday afternoon your cashier, Mr. Abel&#xD;
Kramp-"&#xD;
"Abel-Abel-why-"&#xD;
"Abel Kramp met with an accident&#xD;
while returning to his home, and "-&#xD;
Accident I. ,t-,&#xD;
"Precisely-which has resulted in his&#xD;
death."&#xD;
"Abel Kramp dead!" exclaimed Du-&#xD;
val.   Abel Krahup d-e-a-d," he repeated,&#xD;
slowly, as if endeavoring to realize the&#xD;
fact more surely as he spoke.&#xD;
"Dead, sir. Some friend of his con-&#xD;
veyed him to his apartments, sent for me,&#xD;
and then watched beside him until he&#xD;
died."&#xD;
"Dead! dead !.. That is bad--very bad&#xD;
news. Cashiers' like him axe hard to fid.&#xD;
A friend did you say ,&#xD;
taDi fY'ou learn the name or address of&#xD;
that friendI&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
1I was in the room but twice, and--"&#xD;
began the doctor evasively.&#xD;
"You thought only of your patient, I&#xD;
presume, and did not-"&#xD;
"My stay was brief at each visit.&#xD;
And here- " the doctor drew forth the-&#xD;
dead man's will- "is a will which he. re-&#xD;
quested me to take charge of. I have&#xD;
not read it nor.did he give me any clue to&#xD;
its contents. I would rather you had&#xD;
charge of it-my professional-labors you.&#xD;
see-you understand?'"I&#xD;
"Of course--ertainly," said .Duvalr&#xD;
taking the will with an eagerness which&#xD;
did -not escape the attention of, the doc-&#xD;
tor; "I shall attend to its bequests as,&#xD;
faithfully as if he had been my brother."&#xD;
"You know the location of his apart-&#xD;
Mets" queried the doctor-.&#xD;
1" Most certainly, and of :all my em-&#xD;
ployees."1&#xD;
"You will of course take charge of his-&#xD;
funeral obsequies?" .      .&#xD;
brHesiall have as tender and respectful&#xD;
burial."&#xD;
"I shall notify the coroner. The in-&#xD;
quest will doubtless -be brief-my own&#xD;
statement with the information of the ac-&#xD;
cident as given me by his friend will be-&#xD;
all that is necessary to decide the -case.&#xD;
Upon my certificate,"no autopsy will be&#xD;
neded."criI     I of --     -&#xD;
1"- The certificateof a physician of your&#xD;
reputation will be sufficient to allay all&#xD;
doubt."&#xD;
The doctor 'bowed in deference to the&#xD;
compliment.,&#xD;
" I will order my carriage at once," said'&#xD;
Duval, "and drive over to his apar-tments.&#xD;
Is there any one now with him?"&#xD;
".No. I locked the, room-here is the&#xD;
key. Let an undertaker be summoned&#xD;
after notifying the coroner. Should'my&#xD;
-presence be required before teno'clook.I&#xD;
-will be at my offce"&#xD;
" Thank you, thank you," said Duval..&#xD;
" This is dreadful, however. 'Itis -the-&#xD;
first death among :my employees. since I&#xD;
bave been in.,the,' banking business.&#xD;
Really, doctor, it has shocked me, more&#xD;
than perhaps you are aware of. I have a.&#xD;
&#xD;
habit of restraining the expression of my&#xD;
feelings; but surely this is one of those&#xD;
accidents-one of those unexpected occur-'&#xD;
rences which are 41 the more startling-&#xD;
when-when-"           '&#xD;
"There, Mr,,Duval, I understand what&#xD;
you would say. It is distressing, but&#xD;
must be borrie." .&#xD;
It was vell the doctor interrupted him,&#xD;
for the eminent Christian and banker in&#xD;
his sudden anxiety to appear deeply af-&#xD;
fected by the loss of his cashier, and to&#xD;
conceal his real feeling in the matter, had&#xD;
become muddled, and his usual calm self-&#xD;
possession was somewhat weakened..&#xD;
"Evidently," thought the doctor, "it&#xD;
would take more'than one cashier's death&#xD;
'to bring grief to this man's heart." But&#xD;
he sd nothing.&#xD;
A few more words were exchanged,&#xD;
and the doctor, with such polite expres-&#xD;
sions of cojidolence and of good wishes&#xD;
which he considered' necessary frm a&#xD;
physician to a nabob who one day might&#xD;
require  his  services , the amiable, pair&#xD;
parted.&#xD;
The doctor to his office, and Jerome&#xD;
Duvalto order his carriage and prepare for&#xD;
his mission to the dead, cashier's apart-,&#xD;

'So-9o-Abel Kramp is gone! One&#xD;

So, arguing'in this Idisjointed manner,&#xD;
as is the wont of men of his nature, he&#xD;
proceeded to dress, with his usual scrupu-&#xD;
lous care, but with more than usual ce-&#xD;
lerity.&#xD;
Then' another subject jf .annoyance&#xD;
came up.  "That friend, who had at-&#xD;
tended so faithfully to the cashier in his&#xD;
last moments-what night not Abel&#xD;
Kramp have divulged to him I Who was&#xD;
this friend?1" ;Abel, so far as Duval knew,&#xD;
had no ,special visitors at the banking&#xD;
house, and butrarely lad.any onp called to&#xD;
see him personally, so f4r as.the banlger's&#xD;
observationsextendf.,4"Friend? This was&#xD;
the first intimation ho had had that such&#xD;
a being ever existed. Surely, the doctor&#xD;
should have inguired. Strange remiss-&#xD;
ness, on his part in such a series case."&#xD;
At last being dressed,' and the carriage&#xD;
announced as. in waiting at the door,&#xD;
Duval, giving the order to the coachman,&#xD;
was driven away.&#xD;
On his way there were two points inIs&#xD;
cogitations which assumed paramount im-&#xD;
e portance.&#xD;
Ohe was td the identity of that' un-&#xD;
known friend.&#xD;
The other was as to what revelations,&#xD;
- if any, Abel Kramp had made either to&#xD;
d his friend or. to the doctor.&#xD;
f   If any had been made, to the doctor&#xD;
n would. not the doctor. have mentioned&#xD;
d something of itI&#xD;
e   To reliev his mind, as he rode, leaning&#xD;
d back in' the catriag, he' opened the will&#xD;
i- 'and read it.&#xD;
h    There was not much of it.&#xD;
d    It''covered only a single sheet of law&#xD;
d 'paper and was In Abel's own handwriting.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="80 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6629-00000047"/>&#xD;
BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Throughout there was no mention or al-&#xD;
lusion whatever to his recusant wife.&#xD;
Duval discerning this felt relieved.&#xD;
Knowing this, by his first quick glance&#xD;
at its contents, he reperused it more&#xD;
slowly, so as to thoroughly understand it&#xD;
and its bequests, or rather bequest.&#xD;
For it left without reservation all his&#xD;
property, the accumulation of his savings,&#xD;
hib furniture, pictures, articles of vertu,&#xD;
books, as well as the whole of his deposit&#xD;
in the savings-bank to Alexander Rogers,&#xD;
"clerk," so the will singularly read,&#xD;
formerlyy in the employ of Jerome Du-&#xD;
val, banker, but discharged upon account&#xD;
of illness, and left to die in poverty by the&#xD;
employer he had faithfully and honestly&#xD;
served for seven years, but who 'fortuaate-&#xD;
ly found a friend and protector that r'es-&#xD;
cued him."&#xD;
"'Rogers!"   muttered Duval. "1 re-&#xD;
member    hini-a 'thin-faced, gioveling&#xD;
sort of a fellow, but honest.ges, 'fo he&#xD;
had neither the' sene or' eoura'ge td be&#xD;
otherwise." So, sa !"he is the' legatee, eli?&#xD;
Well, when ii co hes into' tihis' inhdrit-&#xD;

with a smile his folded it up and pla&amp;amp;dlit&#xD;
in an inside pocket. - "             "&#xD;

testation of a notary or'any of the for-&#xD;

The carriaget this moiet stopped.&#xD;
Duval looked out.&#xD;
The coroner's office was before him.&#xD;

Louise Trainor was there, looking pale&#xD;
and worn, yet with her whole mind,'en-&#xD;
grossed with the absorbing, ruling idea-&#xD;
the detection of the murderer of her&#xD;
brother, or the clearing away of the mys-&#xD;
tery which surrounded his disappearance.&#xD;
Upon the day on which she had so sid-&#xD;
denly face to face encountered Moquard,&#xD;
and so signally failed in her endeavor to&#xD;
secure his detention she formed' another&#xD;
resolve.. She began to see how hopeless&#xD;
it was to depend upon her own unaided&#xD;
efforts, and she also began to feel that it&#xD;
was wearing her away and in this ex-&#xD;
haustion, mental and physical, destroying&#xD;
her power to steadily continue the par-&#xD;
suit.&#xD;
She was alone in the world-save in so&#xD;
far as her: motherwas concerned there&#xD;
werenone in all the frivolous crowd with&#xD;
whom her social position brought her in&#xD;
contact upon either whose friendship or&#xD;
confidence she couldirely.save-I----A' "&#xD;
To her mother of late she had avoided&#xD;
all reference to the matter; for She was&#xD;
feeble, and any further mental excitement&#xD;
than that she had alreadyborne in mourn-&#xD;
ing over the loss of her son, whose life -had&#xD;
been the g16ry of her existence. might&#xD;
bring.upon her a mortal illness.&#xD;
To the mother, her mind weakened by&#xD;
het bodily ailments, the past was fast be-&#xD;
coming a -mere dream. To her daughter-&#xD;
she now looked for consolation and.solace&#xD;
-and. Louise knowing- this, took care,'&#xD;
with:'all tenderness and love, to obtrude&#xD;
upon her nothing which would revive' all&#xD;
the sorrow and anguish of that deaO'&#xD;
past.&#xD;
But as for herself, she had not forgotten&#xD;
the words she had uttered to Jeroni Du-&#xD;
val, at.the outset of her search:&#xD;
" Henceforth there is no rest for me n-&#xD;
til my brother's death is revenged by&#xD;
bringing to. justice: the man' who 'was his&#xD;
slayer.   Would give all-,+yess&#xD;
even my own life' for a, clue which will&#xD;
lead me out of this dark mystery.".&#xD;
Sincethei she .had'once again, as she&#xD;
thdight, stood fice to face with that man;i&#xD;
he was almostwithin her reach and yet&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
again he eluded her and was gone. In&#xD;
all the- great city, so guarded and pro-&#xD;
tected by the police, that man still roamed&#xD;
at large, despite her endeavors, her weary&#xD;
round of search I&#xD;
Was it not terrible, this awful blank of&#xD;
hopelessness which began to close in upon&#xD;
herl&#xD;
But she knew no such word as despair.&#xD;
A new resolve had come upon her.&#xD;
Once more slie had determined to employ&#xD;
the agency of a detective.&#xD;
The detective sat opposite her in that&#xD;
great dimly-lighted room, into and out of&#xD;
which the haunting echoes had so often&#xD;
troops&amp;amp;; sat there,,saying little but listen.&#xD;
ing to her relation of all her search, and&#xD;
of the circumstances attending it.&#xD;
He was an easy, nonchalant seeming sort&#xD;
of.person, with not at all bright eyes or any&#xD;
facial expression of aptitude for his busi-&#xD;
'ness. He rather would have been taken&#xD;
by the ordinary observer for a sort of man&#xD;
about town, bla$4 to anything in the&#xD;
way of.excitement; a man of imperturba-&#xD;
ble good nature,.not gifted with any no-&#xD;
ticeable mental qualities, and one whose&#xD;
social position.might-be high or might be&#xD;
low. Neatly clad in the prevailing fash-&#xD;
ion, in the prime of life, that is to say, not&#xD;
.over forty, with a carefully trimmed mous-&#xD;
tache, Mr. ,Tohn Trueman sat there with&#xD;
iso little outwar4,expression of interest in&#xD;

" On the fifth of March you say he land-&#xD;
ed here ? inquired the detective.&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"And on the fifth day of March a perso'&#xD;
giving the name of Robert Trainor called&#xD;
at the banking-house of Jerome Duval and&#xD;
deposited that large amount of money, at,&#xD;
say noontimeI "&#xD;
"At eleven o'clock, according to Mr.&#xD;
Duval," stated Miss Trainor.&#xD;
" Yes, and he presented the letters of&#xD;
introduction from Messrs. Bullion, Bond &amp;amp;&#xD;
Co., of London 4&#xD;
" Precisely."&#xD;
"Miss Trainor," said Mr Trueman,&#xD;
stroking his chin reflectively, and speak-&#xD;
Ing as calmly and slowly as if the whole&#xD;
affair and his narration of it were a mat-&#xD;
ter of no particular moment, "I see noth-&#xD;
ing uncommon in this disappearance."&#xD;
" Nothing  uncommon!"    exclaimed.&#xD;
Louise Trainor.&#xD;
" There are a hundred a year of- such&#xD;
disappearances which come to our knowl-&#xD;
edge, and the knowledge of the police.&#xD;
In a city like this such things must be-&#xD;
such things have to be among al the&#xD;
other happenings. The only wonder, is&#xD;
that there are not more of them."&#xD;
"But, sir-."&#xD;
"One moment, Miss. Excuse me," said&#xD;
the apparently argumentative and disin-&#xD;
terested Mr. Trueman.  "They're good&#xD;
cases to work up sometimes. This one is&#xD;
not very clear at the start. Now you see&#xD;
you ain't sure but that your brother, Rob-&#xD;
ert Trainor, was made away with in Lon-.&#xD;
don, and that some one else, crossed the1&#xD;
water with his baggage and -under his&#xD;
name. No one on this side who knew&#xD;
him has seen him so far as you or I know.&#xD;
But I'll. start upon the theory that he&#xD;
himself did actually land here.  Now&#xD;
when you found he had come ashore and&#xD;
had not, after twenty-four hours' search&#xD;
and waiting put in an appearance,: you&#xD;
ought to have come to us at once. Our'&#xD;
chances would have been ten to one of&#xD;
succeeding. Now they are only one to&#xD;
ten that we fail."&#xD;
" Fail! Do not say that!"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN T&#xD;
&#xD;
"My theory is this--providing he did&#xD;
land here, and that is the theory on which&#xD;
I will work up the case-that the man&#xD;
who first called at the banking house was&#xD;
your brother; that the next who' came&#xD;
was one of the parties who had a hand in&#xD;
his disappearance. You saw him during&#xD;
your visit there-this map 7"1&#xD;
" As plainly as I now see you."&#xD;
"And you are positive that this man&#xD;
whom you saw in the street a little while&#xD;
ago was that man ?',&#xD;
".As surely as I would have recognized&#xD;
my own face in the glass I recognized&#xD;
him."&#xD;
" You see, Miss, this matter of identity&#xD;
is not always a certainty. Besides,. if you&#xD;
had had this man arrested when younet&#xD;
him in the street you could hive done&#xD;
nothing with him as the case now stands.&#xD;
Mere suspicion without some proof to&#xD;
back it won't do."-:&#xD;
" From my description of him will you&#xD;
be able to recognize'him."     . .&#xD;
" That depends. My business is to hear&#xD;
nothing, see nothing, know nothing, and&#xD;
remember nothing, yet to hear every-&#xD;
thing, see. everything, know everything&#xD;
and: remember everything."     .&#xD;
" Is there any hope.do you think"n-&#xD;
" That is not for me to say, now. If&#xD;
there was no hope in me I wouldn't un-&#xD;
dertake the case.. - Hopei Miss Trainor, is&#xD;
like a, good breakfast-it's an excellent&#xD;
foundation for a good dAy's work... I.will&#xD;
'try to get .through this puzzle,,after. my&#xD;
own fashion. . You must have patience&#xD;
and let me have my own time." If I fail&#xD;
it will be nobody's fault-if there is any&#xD;
fault in failure-but mine. ,Now, where&#xD;
*shall I commtmicate with you at any or&#xD;
il tines-at.your house or here?"&#xD;
" At my own residence.".&#xD;
Aft3r . but little further , conversation&#xD;
Mr. Trueman took his leave, and left Miss&#xD;
Trainer alone in the great roomaind not&#xD;
I:entirely well satisfied with the detective's&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
"What cares he," she thought, "whe-&#xD;
ther he succeeds or fails ;'be is .paid the&#xD;
saihe. There's no more. feeling in the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
man than there is in a finger-post. He'll&#xD;
never unravel the mystery-never-never!&#xD;
Only in the great hereafter will I know&#xD;
the fate of poor Robert."&#xD;
Quite different were the cogitations of&#xD;
Mr. John Trueman as he sauntered away&#xD;
from the house towards Broadway.&#xD;
" These women are the most unreason-&#xD;
able beings. They have no faith in pa-&#xD;
tience. It's their nature to worry and&#xD;
have their own way, 'specially if it hap-&#xD;
pens to be the wrong way of something&#xD;
they don't know anything about. They&#xD;
can't wait. I'd rather deal with a dozen&#xD;
men than'one woman in a matter of busi-&#xD;
ness. It's my opinion-never mind. I'll&#xD;
work this job up as best I can in my own&#xD;
light, but it is a slim, a mighty slim&#xD;
chance."&#xD;
So musing as he went along, he came&#xD;
to the noisy thoroughfare, paused a mo-&#xD;
ment at the corner, as if undecided which&#xD;
conise to take, up or down.&#xD;
"Last March, ehI and now it's getting&#xD;
into the fall. I shan't go to Duval's bank.&#xD;
There's no. information to be obtained&#xD;
there. Ill go to the office and think it&#xD;
over."&#xD;
So he did. At the office, seating himself&#xD;
quietly and lighting a cigar, he proceeded&#xD;
to arrange the information he had receiv-&#xD;
ed from Miss Trainor, in what he called&#xD;
"systematic working order."&#xD;
Presently he took from the large table&#xD;
in the centre of the office, a file of daily&#xD;
papers.&#xD;
"Only back to July,"' he said. "I11 go&#xD;
to-the Herald office. I'll begin there. I'll&#xD;
see in the March issues the reports of&#xD;
coroners' cases-the found drowned, the&#xD;
knocked on the head, and other little ac-&#xD;
cidents of that nonth. There's nothing&#xD;
like beginning with a good start. If that&#xD;
Robert- Trainor, landed here he's been&#xD;
hocussed, robbed, and made away with.&#xD;
There is always a clue to eyery riddle-&#xD;
the only trouble is to find it. A very&#xD;
small key sometimes opens a very large&#xD;
door. Let me see-ah-that burglary case.&#xD;
I'll step over and see about that, and then&#xD;
I'll take in the Herald on my way."&#xD;
&#xD;
V.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE CRUSTS.                        83&#xD;
It had been scarcely two hours'since he&#xD;
had left Miss Trainor, yet just as be threw&#xD;
away the remains of his cigar and was&#xD;
preparing to leave the office, a messenger&#xD;
entered, bearing a note to his address.&#xD;
He opened it deliberately- he did no-&#xD;
thing hastily. He read simply these lines:&#xD;
" Mr. TRUEMAN-In relating to you the&#xD;
circumstances connected with my bro-&#xD;
ther's disappearance, I omitted mention-&#xD;
ing onething to you which, perhaps, may&#xD;
be of value. He wrote me from London&#xD;
that he hnad purchased a ticket in the&#xD;
Havana Lottery, which ticket he may&#xD;
have had with him when he landed. The&#xD;
drawing of the lottery may not have oc-&#xD;
curred until March. This information&#xD;
may be of some use to you.   L&#xD;
"Yours,        L. T.11&#xD;
"Much use that is, but it may be. A man&#xD;
in my business shouldn't despise anything,&#xD;
except an empty pocket."&#xD;
He folded the note, placed it in his&#xD;
pocket, and left the office .&#xD;
Mr. Detective Trueman had in this in-&#xD;
terval formed his plan of action in this&#xD;
special business of tracing out the fate of&#xD;
Robert Trainor. It was his nature to be&#xD;
obstinate in his adherence to whatever&#xD;
theory he formed, and, to use his own ex-&#xD;
pression, "nothing short of an earthquake&#xD;
would move him " from it. To his credit,&#xD;
however, be it said, his conclusions were&#xD;
never arrived at hastily, and his judgment&#xD;
only made after careful and deliberate in-&#xD;
vestigation of a case or "job'" in all its&#xD;
bearings.&#xD;
He was one of those beings whose real&#xD;
character and calibre of intellect women&#xD;
find it hard, acute as they are, to under-&#xD;
stand.  Therefore it was that Louise&#xD;
Trainer, juaging him merely by super-&#xD;
ficial oboervation and by his, apparent&#xD;
stolidity of manner, distrusted his ability&#xD;
even though she felt impelled by some&#xD;
unaccountable impulse to yield him her&#xD;
confidence.&#xD;
When he left her presence shesat there&#xD;
brooding over this one grief, that had&#xD;
coine like a dark and evil shadow upon&#xD;
her life, and under the influence of which&#xD;
her mothlet too surely was gradually fad-&#xD;
ing from her sight.&#xD;

She had hoped and prayed that every&#xD;
day of her search, of her wearying endea-&#xD;
vor might bring her some faint encourage-&#xD;
ment; but as each day and each week had&#xD;
come, only disappointment confronted&#xD;
her. Now that she had resolved to leave&#xD;
the work to the detective, Trueman, and&#xD;
for the time, at least, to await with what&#xD;
patience and hope she could, the, result of&#xD;
his services, even this relief did not&#xD;
bring her the mental rest she so much&#xD;
needed.&#xD;
For the sake of the dear memory of her&#xD;
lost brother, and of all Is tenderness to&#xD;

when he left his farewell kiss upon her&#xD;

From her brooding thought she was&#xD;
aroused by the opening of the door.&#xD;
A servant entered, leaving the body-,&#xD;
guard of echoes to die away in the outer&#xD;
hall.&#xD;
" Miss Deadstone would like you, maam,&#xD;
to come up to her room-her bud-wor, if&#xD;
you please, ma'am.",&#xD;
And with a bow' the minion of the&#xD;
Deadstone mansion, withdrew, satisfied&#xD;
that he had as gracefully as usual accom-&#xD;
plished one of the most important,func-&#xD;
tions of his position,&#xD;
Louise 'Trainor ascended the broad&#xD;
staircase and entered the apartment which&#xD;
Miss Letty Deadstone occupied as her&#xD;
boudoir.&#xD;
Is it all arranged with the officer?"&#xD;
asked Letty. -"Im so glad. Now that&#xD;
you have it partially off your mind, come&#xD;
iit down and let us have a cozy chat; it&#xD;
ill cheer you up, Lohi. I'm afraid I will&#xD;
have to keep you hete awhile unless you&#xD;
become a little more like the Louise&#xD;
Thinor of last year. By the way, I've&#xD;
got a bit of gossip for you. Of course you&#xD;
know the Rev. Mr. Pawridge ?" I&#xD;
"I do. What of him, Letty?"&#xD;
"Well, it's a great deal of. him, and if&#xD;
the rumor are true, it's not much to his&#xD;
credit."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
THE NEW READING OF- THE ENGLISH&#xD;
HISTORY, AS FOUND BY GLENHAMS&#xD;
GLENHAM slowly deciphered the enigma.&#xD;
It was certainly a task requiring patience&#xD;
if not labor. As he came to the under-&#xD;
scored letters he transcribed them one&#xD;
after another upon a sheet of paper, so&#xD;
that at the expiration of two hours he&#xD;
completed his task.&#xD;
"At last ! he said, and gave a sigh of&#xD;
relief as he laid the book aside upon the&#xD;
table and read the result of the' dead man's&#xD;
bequest.-&#xD;
Thus, line for line, ran tlie solution of&#xD;
those marked letters, from page 19 to&#xD;
page 39 of "Macaulay's Hist:ory of Eng-&#xD;
land"-a new reading, and one which per-&#xD;
haps never before had been exacted from&#xD;
a history:&#xD;

with which the lawyer concluded his&#xD;
examination and looked up at Glenham.&#xD;
"Mr. Kramp is dead1!,&#xD;
"Dead! Why, I saw hin yesterday&#xD;
morning," said the attorney. " Heart-&#xD;
disease, eh I Take a seat."&#xD;
" No sir," said Glenham, taking a seat&#xD;
immediately opposite the lawyer. He then&#xD;
narrated as briefly as possible the circum-&#xD;
stances attending the cashier's death.&#xD;
"Somewhat singular12" said Mr. Drill,&#xD;
dropping the solitary glass from his eye,"&#xD;
fortunate for him he met you. You say&#xD;
you gave the will to Dr. Pillule?"&#xD;
"1I did, but I question, little as I under-&#xD;
stand the law, if the will will be of much&#xD;
value, drawn as it is without witnesses,&#xD;
and-"'&#xD;
" Abel Kramp knew what he was about&#xD;
-see 1" Rising, Mr. Drill brought from&#xD;
his safe a folded document. "Here is a&#xD;
will, of which the one you found was a&#xD;
copy. This is the original duly signed,&#xD;
sealed, attesited,.and as perfectly legal as&#xD;
I could make it."t&#xD;
"I am glad of it," said Glenham. "Pray&#xD;
inform me who is this Mr. Rogerg-the&#xD;
legatee -or rather, not so particularly&#xD;
who is he; but where is he to be found&#xD;
-his residence, I mean 1"1&#xD;
"I will give it you presently, I have&#xD;
here in this sealed package some papers&#xD;
which are in the handwriting of Mr.&#xD;
Kramp and which you can take with you&#xD;
and peruse at your leisure. Among them&#xD;
are a few letters whichv.it would be well&#xD;
not to leave lying about outside of lock&#xD;
and key. As I understand them, they are&#xD;
not complimentary to the reputation of a&#xD;
certain banker in this city.  However,&#xD;
you probably will have but little interest&#xD;
in their contents and can burn them up.&#xD;
They are the relics of a great sorrow which&#xD;
befel Mr. Kramp." As the lawyer uttered&#xD;
the last sentence, a softened look came&#xD;
upon his hard legal face and the gruff&#xD;
voice mellowed. "A great sorrow, sir,&#xD;
which he bore like a man."&#xD;
At this moment the thin-faced youth&#xD;
entered.&#xD;
" WellI" said Ur. Drill, his face at once&#xD;
&#xD;
regaining its usual office hardness and his&#xD;
voice rising to its regular height of gruff-&#xD;
ness. "Well "   -&#xD;
"Mr. John Trueman wishes to see you,"&#xD;
said the youth.&#xD;
"Let him in." Exit the boy and im-&#xD;
mediately enter Mr. John Trueman-as&#xD;
non-committal of face, as nonchalant of&#xD;
manner, and careless of gait as if he were&#xD;
merely an animated mechanical contriv-&#xD;
ance that needed winding up.&#xD;
"Be seated, Mr. Trueman.".&#xD;
Trueman complied with the request. As&#xD;
he did so Glenham arose. -,&#xD;
" Mr. Glenham," said the lawyer-&#xD;
"should you desire to have an interview&#xD;
in reference to this-this-matter-and I&#xD;
presume it will be necessary you should,&#xD;

any prior engagement of yours?'I&#xD;
"Not at all. Here, I presumeI "&#xD;
"Of course, here; I will make it -yes,&#xD;

Trueman was apparently absorbed in&#xD;
the contents of a bulky calf-bound digest&#xD;
which he had taken from the table.&#xD;
"I shall be obliged to you," replied&#xD;
Glenham, politely, and without more ado&#xD;
passed out and was gone from their pres-,&#xD;

replacing the book upon the table$ " a&#xD;

*1I think I have met him before -on the&#xD;

"No doubt, no 'doubt," said Mr. Drill,&#xD;
betraying a slight impatience in his tone.&#xD;
Of all things he' detested being cross-&#xD;
examined, especially by Mr. 'Trueman's&#xD;
covert inuendoes, which he was sharp&#xD;
enough to know were uttered only for the&#xD;
purpose of drawing him out. After a&#xD;
moment's pause he added-" Anything&#xD;

youth's mind- who stood in the doorway.&#xD;
" Verywell-good day, sir."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
MR. cLtrITCH:tT FALLS DOWN STAIRS BY&#xD;
GETTING TO HIGH.&#xD;
Mn. CLUTOIT as a detective proved a&#xD;
failure. Mrs. Pawridge found him after&#xD;
an extended trial to be a gay deceiver.&#xD;
Somehow he was unfaithful to his trust.&#xD;
She discovered that he was incompetent&#xD;
to detect anything except the presence&#xD;
and quality of whiskey and other exhilar-&#xD;
ating alcoholic compounds. So one day&#xD;
she gave him a, peremptory dismissal.&#xD;
Whereupon he returned'once nibre to&#xD;
the shelter and permanent conifort of&#xD;
" Gringo," where he might if he chosh be&#xD;
independent ,and get continuously drunk&#xD;
without question.&#xD;
Madame GriiGgo no "more, for his wife&#xD;
had given up the astsological business as&#xD;
being inco patible with profit. It did&#xD;
not pay.&#xD;
She had removed from Carmine street&#xD;
to other"ani loftier quarters.&#xD;
Mi.Clutphit had tried various exped-&#xD;
ents, after losing rs..Pawridge's patron-&#xD;
age; whereby to earn a living, but some-&#xD;
how he didn't rake in any large amount&#xD;
of reward f~r his labor.&#xD;
Iet was a sort 'of child of chance. He&#xD;
fell into the ways of an odd jobbist, and&#xD;
he beqa tqhave the appearance of a half&#xD;
finished jA,'wandering about for some-&#xD;
body to finish hin :iip. He began to be&#xD;
generally drunk afterhours of Wrk,'and&#xD;
4s ty  neighbors or iis wife never saw&#xD;
him at his work they rarely beheld him in&#xD;
any other (Ondition, than that of inebria-&#xD;

The Clutchits now occupied the third&#xD;
floor in a tenement house in oue of the&#xD;
cross streets on the east"side of the Bow-&#xD;
ery. They had been there three months.'&#xD;
One evening Mrs. Clutchit was in her&#xD;
kitchen, kneading dough in a cracked&#xD;
wooden tray.&#xD;
Her calico dress sleeves were rolled up,&#xD;
displaying a pair of arms gooselleshy as.&#xD;
to texture, red as to color, and variegated&#xD;
by dough and Bour.&#xD;
Behid her a small cooking stove gave&#xD;
out an intense beat,mmgled with the cri&#xD;
dI' . -   .S.&#xD;
odor that is.the inevitable sequence ofl&#xD;
baking.      ad become angular m form,&#xD;
flat breasted, and her astrological mouth&#xD;
seemed to have pushed her ears back and&#xD;
absorbed a portion of her upper lip. Mrs.&#xD;
Clutchit was evidently fading. 6nly in'&#xD;
her temper remained the vigor of youth.&#xD;
Mrs. Clutchit rolled up her last batch&#xD;
of dough, put it into the bread pan,&#xD;
scraped the sticky bits and loose flour&#xD;
from her goosey arms with her fingers,&#xD;
and looked up at a two-dollar clock which&#xD;
stood -amid a crowd of bottles, cups,&#xD;
and broken plaster ornaments upon the&#xD;
mantel-shelf above the stove.&#xD;
"Nine o clock and that man not home&#xD;
yet. Saturday night, too, when he knows&#xD;
I'm out of money. Ugh ! the brute !"&#xD;
She listened.  Evidently a familiar&#xD;
sound struck her ear.&#xD;
"That's him in' the lower hall. Drunk,&#xD;
I'll be bound. No supper for him this&#xD;
night."&#xD;
She opened the door; stepped out into&#xD;
the passage and stood at the head of the&#xD;
stairs which were'only feebly lighted by&#xD;
kerosene lamp hanging from the ceiling.&#xD;
"9That's Clutchit,'t she muttered.&#xD;
It was Clutchit, fearfully demoralized.&#xD;
Clutchit was full, bt his bottle-mouth&#xD;
was uncorked and he was grumbling all&#xD;
the way.&#xD;
He paused at the foot of the stairs with&#xD;
his foot on the lower rail !while h is body&#xD;
swayed about and lurched like a water-&#xD;
logged ship in a heavy sea-.&#xD;
"He kin git up if he kin," said Mrs.&#xD;
Clutchit, viewing the spectacle and then&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
turning back into the kitchen and'wrath-&#xD;
fully banging the door shut. !&#xD;
" Sheems t'me," murmured Clutohit&#xD;
idiotically arguing with himself, "Sheoxis&#xD;
t*me tbishish nozzer floor-wrong floor-&#xD;
osser floor-lem nie see-hie-wher-nmi-&#xD;

braced up, against the wall, and lcered&#xD;
stupidly around. "Lemme she-thought&#xD;
thatsit-thishishn'tmy-hic-fleor-thish&#xD;
fourth floor-damme why don't they light&#xD;
gash; I wonder-hic."&#xD;
' Then he swayed and'rolled and lurched&#xD;
around the bannisters, and fooled' along&#xD;
the n all till he had retraced his steps to&#xD;
the head of the lower flight.&#xD;
" Thought sho-down there't Where"'I&#xD;

And he stralihtened u p, then suddenlY&#xD;
llmilered, clutched too short at the stair&#xD;
rail, slin his foot forward,'fst'hat'&#xD;
little bala'nee he had, and' yitniged head&#xD;
and heels, tumbling, squelching, and&#xD;
bumpimg'dowi the stairs&#xD;
Doors were flung open, and the tenAnts&#xD;
came rushing out.&#xD;
They looked over the railing, 'saw&#xD;
the dim light What and who it was, then&#xD;
went back again.&#xD;
" It's only that Clutchit with a load&#xD;
on."&#xD;
'Clutchit's drunk again."&#xD;
"D-n that Clutehit."&#xD;
That's what they said, and every one&#xD;
of them -repeated the same to somebody&#xD;
else inside.&#xD;
Mrs. Clutchit went down toi the foot&#xD;
of tlie stairs, where the tail of her house-&#xD;
hold lAy flopping and groaning on the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"There, you beast now 'git-right up,&#xD;
and gitup ,stairs, if you kin."&#xD;
The fall had sobeied him a little, only a&#xD;
very little.&#xD;
He gathered  himself up after five&#xD;
minutes of scratching and clawing about&#xD;
the floor and' stood proudly balanced for&#xD;
about two seconds. Then he made a&#xD;
fresh start, lurched head down, took a&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
sudden and unceremonious whirl, and&#xD;
bounce like a 'boulder fidm a catapult&#xD;
up against and opposite door.&#xD;
Whang flew open the 'door, and Mr.&#xD;
Clutchit pitched into the room and went&#xD;
down with a squelch. Then came terrific&#xD;
yells. Two old maids were in that room,&#xD;
and at that precise moment.one of them&#xD;
was standing close to the door, listening&#xD;
to the row outside, while the other had&#xD;
her ee to the keyhole.&#xD;
Resur-When that door burst open one&#xD;
old maid was knocked endwise up against&#xD;
a waspstand* and went 4lwn with it and&#xD;
a pitcher full of water all pver her, and&#xD;
the  other was flattened  out, with&#xD;
Clutehit's head, resting on her feet.&#xD;

Clut 4t, ipk the midst of the, uproar&#xD;

And presently thy had' Oufift'up&#xD;

him into the kitchen.&#xD;
When they let go of him he dropped&#xD;
with a grunt to the floor. The men went&#xD;
&#xD;
out and left him alone in his glory with&#xD;
his wife.&#xD;
Thenshe saw that the patent tin collar&#xD;
which he wore had bent up, and one of&#xD;
the Bytonic corners 'had slit a gash uP-&#xD;
under his chin, and the tin bosom attach-&#xD;
ment had sprung out 'and was twisted 'so&#xD;
that it 'looked, with the paint sciatehed&#xD;
off anud a 'wet quid of tobacco flattened&#xD;
against it, like a piece of'roofing.&#xD;
He had not only dropped on the floor,&#xD;
but into a s6lid sleep, and began to snore&#xD;
then and there. Mrs. Clutchit jammed her&#xD;
hands 'iMto 'his pockets , and began: a&#xD;
general search. 'She drew forth an ageno&#xD;
pamphlet full of pictorial tin collars of all&#xD;
fashions, a lot of business cards, and his&#xD;
pocketbook.  In that she found a liank&#xD;
cheque for twenty dollars, -and three or&#xD;
tour dollars in money. The cheque and&#xD;
money she froze to at once-and put the&#xD;
pocketbook back into his pocket.&#xD;

&#xD;
BET WEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
butcher. Of all household ogres theI&#xD;
butcher is the most implacable in the'&#xD;
way ofextending credit or of observing&#xD;
those little amenities of short change&#xD;
which customers so much admire and de-&#xD;
light to receive.&#xD;
Her butcher was an exception-one of&#xD;
those hearty, confidential individuals,&#xD;
who if a piece of meat cost forty cents and&#xD;
the customer had only thirty-five cents&#xD;
would take it, pleasantly remarking, "All&#xD;
right-never mind-you can owe me the&#xD;
fivepence."&#xD;
If anything yields exquisite delight to&#xD;
the average market customer it isthe&#xD;
financial favor of being trusted for five&#xD;
cents which the butcher as. well as her-&#xD;
self knows she will never pay, and 4oes&#xD;
not mean to pay.&#xD;
Of her butcher she purchased what meat&#xD;
she required, and then tendered him the&#xD;
cheque.&#xD;
"I owe you four dollars, and can you&#xD;
give me the balance in-in money I , It&#xD;
is all Mr. Clutchit brought home with&#xD;
him."&#xD;
The butcher knew her. She had been a&#xD;
long time customer of his, had always&#xD;
been fairly honorable in her dealings,&#xD;
and so, after a moment's hesitation and&#xD;
inspection of the signature and cheque&#xD;
generally, he complied with her request.,&#xD;
The cheque was signed by Robert&#xD;
Gleiham, and drawn to the order of St.&#xD;
Leon.&#xD;
This business being translated Mrs.&#xD;
Clutchit slowly, with her heavily laden&#xD;
basket, proceededhomeward. As she loft&#xD;
the stall she did not observe that stand-&#xD;
ing beside her during her colloquy with&#xD;
the butcher was a quiet, unobservant in-&#xD;
dividual who to all appearances'seemed&#xD;
to be lounging ut merelyfor the pur-&#xD;
pose of killing tfiue.&#xD;
When she passed the cheque to the&#xD;
butcher the lounger was employed in&#xD;
examining a shoulder of mutton, punch-&#xD;
Ing it with his fingers, and turning it over&#xD;
in a desultory manner; and in doing it&#xD;
seemed to be partially absorbed in some&#xD;
&#xD;
sort of.a mental calculation as to what It&#xD;
might weigh, and its probable cost.&#xD;
'After Mrs. Clutchit-Grngo had dia-&#xD;
appeared, the quiet individual abandoned&#xD;
contemplation of the shoulder of mutton&#xD;
and paid his respects to tie butcher,&#xD;
"Isn't that risky   business, taking&#xD;
cheques from parties-eh&#xD;
"Parties!" said the butcher, good-&#xD;
humoredly. "Oh! no, not'when I knok&#xD;
'em. It aint women who buys meat in&#xD;
dribs like that come the swindle, you&#xD;
know; now that woman, I've knowed her&#xD;
a couple of years. She used to be an as-&#xD;
trologist, sort of fortune teller. Now she&#xD;
isn't M thatline, bift she always pays. I&#xD;
s'pose that cheque she got from her hus-&#xD;
band, Clutchit.  He don't amount to&#xD;
much, I don't think. One of thein fellows&#xD;
tbat's always doing something and never&#xD;
making much at it. Shiftless, slip and go&#xD;
easy, Jack of all trades. It's all right as&#xD;
long as she says so."&#xD;
" Supposing he had offered it, ei ?"&#xD;
"Well I'd have taken it all the same.&#xD;
She'd fx it right if he'didn't."&#xD;
i I suppose so," replied the individual,&#xD;
"but you'll excuse me. I have odd ideas&#xD;
about this cheque busmiess."&#xD;
"One has to be careful you know," in-&#xD;
terupted the butcher,  abiittiint much&#xD;
difference after all. If we don't loge oie&#xD;
way we will another, and a body don't&#xD;
add to their loss by being civil and oblig-&#xD;
Ig.- At least I never did. Now this&#xD;
cheque,"f here he took it out ofhis greasy&#xD;
drawer, and. held it up in his greasy&#xD;
fingers. "I don't know whether it's good&#xD;
or not, bint it looks good, and coming front&#xD;
Mrs. Clutchit' I ve 'faith that it is good;&#xD;
d'yer see I&#xD;
"Certainly.  Yes.   Faith is a good&#xD;
horse." As the butcher held it up the&#xD;
individual merely glanced 'atIt carelessry,&#xD;
but in that careless glance his eye had&#xD;
caught the names upon it, the' auiouft&#xD;
and the name of the bank upon which it&#xD;
was dawn.&#xD;
Evidently he was'satisfied.&#xD;
"I think as  return I will stop, if it&#xD;
isn't too late, and order that shoulder of&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN THE 'CRUSTS,&#xD;
&#xD;
mutton," said the individual, turning I&#xD;
"Any time. Saturday nights we're&#xD;
open till eleven."           '&#xD;
The individual slowly moved on, and&#xD;
edged his way though the crowd. "One&#xD;
more score against this St. Leon," he said&#xD;
to himself, "and, as sure as my name is&#xD;
Jack Trueman I'll find another beforeI&#xD;
Monday night. Robert Glenham- well II&#xD;
can find him easily enough. I think Sun-&#xD;
day is a lucky day for fishing; I'll fish for&#xD;
Clutchit."&#xD;
At the entrance to the market he caught&#xD;
sight of Mrs. Clutchit.'&#xD;
"Fishing is unnecessary," he thought&#xD;
as he saw her. "' Here is the fish, I'll fol-&#xD;
low her, and that 'I1 save trouble.&#xD;
And so he did.&#xD;
To the door of the tenement house.&#xD;
Then he went on, ligL iing a cigar by the'&#xD;
way, and strolled up townwards.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
GATHERING UP THE THREADs.&#xD;
Fpom Lawyer Drills presence and office&#xD;
Glenham returned to his hotel.,&#xD;
Once there'and in his rooms he broke&#xD;
open the sealed package and began an&#xD;
examination of its contents. There were&#xD;
various papers, all of them  in Abel&#xD;
Kramp's handwriting.&#xD;
The largest comprised three or foui&#xD;
pages of foolscap, closely written, and&#xD;
composed more in the desultory, broken&#xD;
form of a diary than a straightforward&#xD;
statement; more as if it bad been written&#xD;
from time to time.&#xD;
Carefully Glenham read it, and to say&#xD;
that, despite his expectation that there&#xD;
would be some strange revelation in the&#xD;
contents of the mysterious package so&#xD;
singularly brought int ohis possession, he&#xD;
was astonished, would but feebly express&#xD;
his feeling.&#xD;
He almost leaped from his seat.&#xD;
\The expression of amazement gave way&#xD;
to one of exultation. His face lighted up,&#xD;
his eyes flashed with a' gleam, as of&#xD;
triumph.&#xD;
"At last!" he said, half aloud, "at&#xD;
&#xD;
91&#xD;
&#xD;
last, Jerome 'Duval, I can stand face to&#xD;
face with you, and defy the chance of rec-&#xD;
ognition.. With this knowledge, traced&#xD;
by a hand 'now as cold and pulseless in&#xD;
deith as" your 'heart is to all feeling of&#xD;
compassion or honor-with this knowledge&#xD;
in my possession, I no longer fear what-&#xD;
ever danger may come to him who claims&#xD;
the name of George Jaffray."    Again&#xD;
and again Gilenham read the manuscript,&#xD;
and, as at length satisfied that he thor-&#xD;
ougbly understood its meaning, every&#xD;
word and line of it, he folded it, with the&#xD;
rest of the papers, and deposited them&#xD;
securely in an inner pocket.&#xD;
"God help me, poor dead wife ! Your&#xD;
sorrows, your terrible death, and all the&#xD;
anguish, misery, insult, which this man,&#xD;
this father has brought upon us, must&#xD;
soon be atoned for. The hand of fate&#xD;
must be in this-no human sagacity, no&#xD;
human foresight could have so surely led&#xD;
me, scheme and plan as I might, to the&#xD;
consummation. of my sole wish. Ah !&#xD;
Abel Kramp-deformed, wronged, yet&#xD;
faithful, forgiving, but never f6rgetting-&#xD;
from out of his lonely grave'reaches forth&#xD;
to make clear the way. All is ready. It&#xD;
remains but fo 'me to strike the blow.&#xD;
One breath from me and the vain, haughty&#xD;
money-god will tremble like a whipped&#xD;
cur, and his house of cards topple to&#xD;
pieces. And Edith-"&#xD;
Yes, Glenham, Edith-must she, too,&#xD;
suffer?&#xD;
The thought of the fair young girl, so&#xD;
innocent, so trusting, made him pause.&#xD;
The sister of his dead wife, should she,&#xD;
too, have her future life darkened by&#xD;
himI&#xD;
Steeled as he was against her father,&#xD;
the remembrance of Edith's gentle, con-&#xD;
fiding -nattire, of her purity, for the mo-&#xD;
ment calmed him.&#xD;
But it was for a inoient only.&#xD;
Again the spirit of bitterness came upon&#xD;
him, and he almost cursed the weakness&#xD;
that had threatened even foi so brief a&#xD;
period to make him forget, or half repent,&#xD;
the unalterable resolve to which he had&#xD;
devoted his life.&#xD;

BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
The Pell street den, with all its horror,&#xD;
arose before his mental vision, and he&#xD;
was a man, with the heart of :a demon.&#xD;
At times, when the recollection of all that&#xD;
he had suffered from poverty and want,&#xD;
and of the unrelenting cruelty, heartless-&#xD;
ness with-which Jerome Puvalhad driven,&#xD;
him, by one device and another, frop an&#xD;
honorable position in. society, and de-&#xD;
stroyed his happiness, only because he&#xD;
could not separate him from the woman&#xD;
he loved-is it any wonder that his pas-&#xD;
sion for revenge became the implacable&#xD;
master of his life ?7. That it at times ob-&#xD;
literated every wholesome thought and&#xD;
all the finer feelings of his nature, and&#xD;
crushed out the yearnings for the calm&#xD;
and quiet of a purer life, was an inevitable,&#xD;
conseqyence.I&#xD;
Now, with this key to Jeroie Duval's&#xD;
social destruction in his grasp, he became&#xD;
defiant. There was none of the terror&#xD;
now that before bad bee  evoked at the&#xD;
bare thought of his identity with George&#xD;
Jaifray, and he could mastereill obstacles.&#xD;
From out of the gloom and mists of&#xD;
doubt, the spectres of the 4ead beckoned&#xD;
him into the light and clearness of cer-&#xD;
tainty.&#xD;
As he descended the broad staircase of&#xD;
the liotel, he felt that once again be could&#xD;
at will stand before the world-confront&#xD;
all the city-as George Jaffray.&#xD;
And as for Edith Duval- again the fair&#xD;
vision was before him.&#xD;
" She shall be mine! - God will govern&#xD;
what else 'may betide afterwards.'&#xD;
T[hen came the thought of others - the&#xD;
recollection of his interview with Louise&#xD;
Trainer in the .House of the Echoes, his&#xD;
knowledge of the fate of her brother, and&#xD;
as he remembered it he half resolved, in&#xD;
his exultant defiance of consequences, to&#xD;
reveal the secret to her.&#xD;
What harm could come to him now I&#xD;
But the robbery of the dead man!&#xD;
It will not be forgotten by the reader&#xD;
that Jaffray left upon the body'of the vic-&#xD;
tim  of the midnight ruffians his gold&#xD;
watch and diamond pin, and that when&#xD;
the body was discovered in the morning&#xD;
&#xD;
:i&#xD;
&#xD;
by the police, both watch and dianmnd&#xD;
were gone, and the body stripped of its&#xD;
clothing.&#xD;
Of that desecration of the dead he wa'&#xD;
guiltless; even he had not robbed the&#xD;
dead, for when he 'took possession of the&#xD;
pocket-book, money, carte de visife, and&#xD;
papers, the man was still breathing_; and&#xD;
when he rushed forth into the night and&#xD;
and storm aind sped away, the slow ebb&#xD;
and flow of the'helpless form lying in the&#xD;
noisome den still gave t6ken of the pres-&#xD;
ence of life.&#xD;
Of this robbery he neel not inform her,&#xD;
he, argued. Then Came"Close upon this&#xD;
the forecast of what would be the inevi-&#xD;
table sequence of his betriyal. Louise&#xD;
Trainer would, in her search fdr alt the&#xD;
circumstances attending the catastrophe,&#xD;
discover tfie fact that her brother had&#xD;
been left there to die; that tle had bdeen&#xD;
plundered, murdered, his body despoiled&#xD;
of everything; n4 to her question, Who&#xD;
did this? 'What coukl he; George Jaffray&#xD;
alias Robert Glenham, answer ? Denial&#xD;
would'not answer her; for denial, with no&#xD;
other evidencethan his partial confession,&#xD;
would be regarded by her as an attempt&#xD;
to screen .himself, and that would b'e-&#xD;
worse than all.,&#xD;
. While he thought of all this, while he.&#xD;
was bewildering his mind with this, he&#xD;
little dreamed that Mr. John 'Trueman, in&#xD;
his nethodical way, was searchingfor and&#xD;

which would unravel to the mourning&#xD;
sister of the lost man the dread mystery,&#xD;
and lay it openin all its hideousness.&#xD;
Pursuant 'to. his plan, 'John Trueman&#xD;
had examined a file of the Herald.&#xD;
Carefully he scanned the local reports&#xD;
of the accidents, inrders,'sidden deaths,&#xD;
and mysterious disAppearinces recorded&#xD;
in the columns of that paper day by day&#xD;
through the month of March.&#xD;
There' was only one report of all which&#xD;
attracted his attention.&#xD;
This he read and re-read.&#xD;
It was in the paper dated Mai'ch 7th,&#xD;
1855.&#xD;
"March the seventh, eh9?" he mused.&#xD;

" This Robert Trainor arrived here, ac-&#xD;
cording to his sister's statement, on March&#xD;
the fifth. Um ! On that day he or the&#xD;
man who personated him visited Duval's&#xD;
banking-house, Now, if he was hocussed&#xD;
and knocked on the head, or made away&#xD;
with in any manner,,it must have been&#xD;
on .the night of, that day.. Let me see-&#xD;
here is the only mysterious affair which&#xD;
occurred on the night of the fifth; that&#xD;
was discovered by the police on the morn-&#xD;
ing of the sixth, and of course the account&#xD;
,of it is here in the Herald of the -seventh.&#xD;
It was. in the, afternoon papers, I s'pose,&#xD;
too-the afternoon of the sixth."    ,&#xD;
John Txuemian,.in order to brighten his&#xD;
thoughtsand possibly quicken his judg-&#xD;
ment, solaced himself with a quid.of fibe-&#xD;
cut, andthen continued his consideration&#xD;
of the reporters work. . " ,     ,&#xD;
It was almost verbatim the.samestate-&#xD;
ment, with, .perhaps, a few additional&#xD;
particulars, thb reading of -which a month&#xD;
after the ;occurrence had so. terribly af-&#xD;
fected Jerome Daval in his sitting-room,&#xD;
aid which had; brought for the first time&#xD;
to, Edith Duval the knowledge . of the,&#xD;
miserable death of -her' sister Mary-the&#xD;
,wife of George Jaffray.&#xD;
"Coroner Settem held the inquest, in&#xD;
this case, ehI Well I don't see how this'&#xD;
affair can concernthis Trainer business.&#xD;
This is  a starvation .case in a cellar-it&#xD;
isn't likely, so nevermind; I'll see Settem&#xD;
in a day or two, and have a chat with&#xD;
him-I may pick up 'a little useful, infor-,&#xD;
iration of some sort by it."-&#xD;
Coroner Settem.&#xD;
It was to this official that Jerome Da-&#xD;
-val was driven in ,is carriage at the In-&#xD;
stance of Dr. Pillale, during which mem-&#xD;
orable drive he read the copy of the will&#xD;
'ot Abel Kranrp.,&#xD;
&#xD;
The coroner's inquest was a mere mat-&#xD;
ter of form; how could it! be otherwise&#xD;
whin such an eminent and highly influen-&#xD;
tialcitizen as Jerome Duval suggested it&#xD;
to a-complaisant city- offiial so open to&#xD;
A material . arguments -as Coroner Set'&#xD;
tei 7, There was nothing in it--merely a&#xD;
jury summoned-the verdict--,-" accidental&#xD;
death," and a cheap funeral next day at&#xD;
the expense of Duval anotherr lonely un-&#xD;
marked grave in- the' public ground of&#xD;
Greenwood cemetery..&#xD;
Whatever there were of the dead casb-&#xD;
ier's effects ;in . the way of books, papers,&#xD;
and memoranda, with some few of the&#xD;
more choice articles of vertu Mi his rooms,&#xD;
Duval caused to be immediately removed&#xD;
to his. own, residence; the furniture and&#xD;
all else of the. contents of the room'were&#xD;
conveyed to an auctioi-room, sold, and&#xD;
the receiptii herefor 'duly transferred per&#xD;
cheque to the keeping, of, the Christian&#xD;
banker.&#xD;
At the sale of these effects among other&#xD;
auditors o othe voluble auctioneer, was&#xD;
Madame Gringo Clutchit..&#xD;
Wbat Madame ,Gringo Clutchit desired&#xD;
to purchase, if, it could be obtained with&#xD;
the limited sum at her immediate disposal,&#xD;
was a lounge.&#xD;
She bid on i lounge, and it was hers.&#xD;
So to - the i Clutchit 'mansion-apart-&#xD;
ments rather-the lounge, once the prop-&#xD;
,rty of the cashier, was transported.&#xD;
Onthe Monday afternoon following the&#xD;
Saturday evening in which he had shad-&#xD;
owed Mrs.: Clutchit from  the market.&#xD;
Mr. John Trueman was seated ,on that&#xD;
lounge awaiting the. arrival, momentarily&#xD;
expected, of Mr. Clutebit.&#xD;
Duval did,-not mourn, over the loss ot&#xD;
I his faithful ,servitor-he would ,ot have&#xD;
mourned if that seritor had been his&#xD;
own brother, or even. son. But over the&#xD;
loss of a few thousanfd dollars his grier&#xD;
would have been profound.&#xD;
The cashier's.position made vacant by&#xD;
t the, death'ofKramp wasspeodily filled by&#xD;
- a"1 gentlemans- son "r. anF. F.-whose&#xD;
f father . banked" heavily in  Daval's&#xD;
house. Duval accepted this young gen-&#xD;

&#xD;
tleman f )r two reasons --one because his&#xD;
father's account in the bank was ample&#xD;
security, as he imagined, for the official's&#xD;
honesty; the second, because the salary&#xD;
was to be nothing for the first year, to.be&#xD;
increased to such amount in the second&#xD;
year as the great banker might deem a fit&#xD;
equivalent for services rendered.&#xD;
Per contra, the young F. F-this bit-of&#xD;
rich flavoring of the social upper crust-&#xD;
accepted, that's the high-toned way -of&#xD;
putting it, the situation under a pretense&#xD;
of an earnest desire to learn the banking&#xD;
business, but in reality because he was&#xD;
forced to it by his father to "settle him&#xD;
down " and bring him to a-realization of&#xD;
the fact that there were, other and more&#xD;
useful aims in life than billiards, swell&#xD;
suppers, and guzzling wine.&#xD;
This new cashier was no other' than&#xD;
Namby Shragg, the son      of Carlton&#xD;
Shrugg, heretofore referred to in this&#xD;
veracious history as being a blue blood&#xD;
of the most exalted type.&#xD;
Young Shrugg. concealed whatever dis-&#xD;
gust he may have felt at being thus cor-&#xD;
nered by the "old man," or of being even&#xD;
for a few hours each day a monetary ap-&#xD;
prentice in the banking-house of even so&#xD;
great a financier as Jerome Duval.&#xD;
He made up for it after hours.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Duval had placed .over this&#xD;
young sprig of the avenue, in the osten-&#xD;
sible capacity of instructor, but really as&#xD;
a guard, one of his oldest officials-.his&#xD;
paying teller, who said little, and that lit-&#xD;
tle in as surly, cart, and disagreeable a&#xD;
mauner as possible.&#xD;
Especially did he. snub Namby Shrugg,&#xD;
rather than instruct him in the routine of&#xD;
his duties, for he had, upon the death of&#xD;
Kramp, Indulged in the hope that he&#xD;
would have been promoted, as a mark of&#xD;
confidence and a reward for his long ser-&#xD;
vice, to the vacancy.&#xD;
Shrugg was too lofty and airy in style&#xD;
for the old paying teller. But complaint&#xD;
was useless. Duval never heeded the&#xD;
complaints of his employees; if they&#xD;
didn't like their position, they were at lib-&#xD;
erty to depart at once,&#xD;
&#xD;
At home Duval remained the imperious-&#xD;
autocrat-the lord of all he surveyed,&#xD;
whose right none dared dispute.&#xD;
The servants moved like shadows in&#xD;
his presence; below stairs, in solemn con-&#xD;
clave and with bated breath, they dis-&#xD;
cussed his absolute tyranny to their hearts'&#xD;
content, but with no hint at rebeUion.&#xD;
Their places were too good for that;&#xD;
besides, his sternness was in a measure&#xD;
compensated for by the gentleness and&#xD;
kindness of Edith and her mother, who&#xD;
since the revelation of the Poll street hor-&#xD;
ror had clung together seemingly with no&#xD;
other interest or feeling in common with&#xD;
the father and husband than that which&#xD;
involved the observance of the ordinary&#xD;
duties of the household. They gave Je-&#xD;
rome Duval their duty-all that might&#xD;
have been of affection orlove or genuine&#xD;
respect had been crushed out by the re-&#xD;
membrance of his past cruelty and the&#xD;
inhuman treatment the deAd sister, his&#xD;
daughter, had received at his hands. He&#xD;
bad compelled Edith's mother to silence,&#xD;
but he had crushedher heart in doing it.&#xD;
Glenham resolved to beard the lion in&#xD;
his den, for ,with such a weapon as the&#xD;
written statement left him by the cashier,&#xD;
there could be but little doubt, arguedhe,&#xD;
of the result.&#xD;
Heretofore, under various pretexts, he&#xD;
had declined invitations from Edith to visit&#xD;
the Duval palace-pretexts-the very fem-&#xD;
inineness of which he was heartily asham-&#xD;
ed. He had, too, despite, his ne w-found&#xD;
courage in thus daring.the presence of the&#xD;
man he hated, a vague presentiment that&#xD;
the struggle was approaching the cloge-&#xD;
that this act in the-drama of his life was&#xD;
soon to be ended.&#xD;
It was near eight o'clock in the evening&#xD;
when he alighted from his carriage in front&#xD;
of the banker's -residence and ascended&#xD;
the broad stone steps, over which frowned&#xD;
the heavy carved arch of the entrance.&#xD;
How well he renietnbered it! How, in&#xD;
the years gone by, he had so often entered&#xD;
there fall of hope, pride, and with before&#xD;
him a future seemingly cloudless. And&#xD;
now !-&#xD;
&#xD;
The thought of all he had suffered since&#xD;
then, ?tnd of the man who caused it, caine&#xD;
upon him, and for the instant he felt like&#xD;
strangling the banker as he would a dog.&#xD;
The windows of the drawing-room above&#xD;
and of the reception-roon below were&#xD;
lighted.&#xD;
Eviden bly.visitors were present.&#xD;
He paused a moment. In that moment,.&#xD;
by an effort, he recovered his usual appar-&#xD;
ent serenity.&#xD;
His summons was answered by one of&#xD;
the servants, one who, in the long ago,&#xD;
had often admitted him.&#xD;
He handed his card to the servant.,&#xD;
"Miss Edith?" said the functionary.&#xD;
" Step into the reception-room,'sir, I will&#xD;
see,"&#xD;
Even the reception-room, save the new&#xD;
frescoing of the walls and one or two ad-&#xD;
ditional paintings, was unchanged in ap-&#xD;
pearance.&#xD;
Presently the servant returned. "Miss&#xD;
Edith Diival-is in." -, -.&#xD;
I And theservant, with all due ceremony,&#xD;
conducted Glenham up the' great stair-&#xD;
case to the, drawing-room, announced&#xD;
"Mr. Robert Glenham," and'retired.&#xD;
Contrary to his anticipation; there were&#xD;
no visitors; only, neawone of the crimson-&#xD;
draped windows, one person.&#xD;
Edith.&#xD;
As -the servant announced his name and&#xD;
retired, closing the doof After him, she&#xD;
arose from her seat-and advanced, a plea-&#xD;
sant sile lighting up her face, toward&#xD;
Glenham.&#xD;
" At last, Mr. Glenham," she said " you&#xD;
have-"&#xD;
"Honored myself by keeping one of m3&#xD;
.Innumerable promises to call. I can onl&#xD;
hope thatmy punctuality in this instanc&#xD;
will be accepted as a palliation of my de&#xD;
linquency in the:past."&#xD;
. " Thank you," she said, "for the inter&#xD;
ruption.  Now then, sir knight of th&#xD;
sedate countenance, suppose you do pen&#xD;
ance by dropping ceremony and playin&#xD;
the part of oa ,of the most constant o&#xD;
'visitors-for 'this oedasioi only-as th&#xD;
playbills have it."&#xD;
&#xD;
Glenham seated himself near her.&#xD;
The man of the world in her presence&#xD;
began to forget his purpose upon her&#xD;
father.  --&#xD;
The  conversation thus beginning in&#xD;
pleasant raillery soon passed into another&#xD;
channel, and almost before either were&#xD;
aware of it, they began to speak . in&#xD;
lower tones; and, at last, he drawing his&#xD;
seat nearer her, and taking her hand in&#xD;
his, the secret was revealed.&#xD;
" Edith," he said, and his voice, in spite&#xD;
of himself, trembled. "Edith, let us unt-&#xD;
derstand one another better. I mean, let&#xD;
us understand by utterance what at least&#xD;
I have these many weeks thought of-&#xD;
hoped for-- and whether you have thought&#xD;
of it or not, it is better ,e should speak&#xD;
frankly, and so end this suspense. Edith,&#xD;
by every token and act by which an hon.&#xD;
orable man :can make known, without&#xD;
speakinghis thought, I have endeavoredto&#xD;
convey to you an expression of my feel-&#xD;
ings. I do not think you can have failed&#xD;
to comprehend it."&#xD;
"Mr. Glenham-"&#xD;
' "Please hear me out, and then-and&#xD;
then I will be the listener." A silence en-&#xD;
sued, then Glenham abruptly, but in a tone&#xD;
of gentleness, said: "Edith, I love you.&#xD;
It is useless to annoy you in this with&#xD;
the wild rhapsody which you find in the&#xD;
utterance of the' heroes of sentimental&#xD;
novels. In simple words which 'express&#xD;
the yearnings of my heart, I only say,&#xD;
Edith, I love you, and ask in return no-&#xD;
thing new save the frank ansWer which ia&#xD;
to decide my fate. Your assent will make&#xD;
me a happier man, and bring sunshine&#xD;
y upon a lonel', clouded life; a refusal will&#xD;
y simply leave me to go on in my appointed&#xD;
e path, 'through its loneliness, its gloom,&#xD;
- with what courage and fortitude the heart&#xD;
may have which resolutely strives to bear&#xD;
its grief in silence."&#xD;
oe The girt, while he spoke, her hand still&#xD;
- resting in his, had not raised her eyes; she&#xD;
g sat as passive and motionless as one in a&#xD;
)f trance.&#xD;
e    Slowly she raised her hand,-and in the&#xD;
blush which mantled her fair cheek and the&#xD;

softened expression of her eyes, as they&#xD;
met his earnest look, he read his answer&#xD;
before she uttered it.&#xD;
" Robert-.Mr. Glenham-I-. There,&#xD;
you have my hand in yours. You have my&#xD;
love, and-"&#xD;
"Say no more," exclaimed Glenham,&#xD;
". The outspoken honest trust and confi-&#xD;
deuce of a love like yours are like a gleam&#xD;
of Paradise in this world. Once more the&#xD;
sun shines, the clouds have passed, and&#xD;
let us hope that our lives in the future&#xD;
may be as calm and peaceful-"&#xD;
The door opened, and the servant en-&#xD;
tered.&#xD;
" Miss Edith, your father wishes to know&#xD;
if you are engaged "&#xD;
As she replied, she gave Glenham. an&#xD;
arch smile-No-yes-Does he wish me&#xD;
to come up to himi7"      ,       .t&#xD;
" No, Miss Edith; he tolame to say that&#xD;
:if you weren't.engaged, he'd come here."&#xD;
"Tell him I am not engaged."-&#xD;
"Except to me," whispered Glenham to&#xD;
her as the servant disappeared..&#xD;
A blush and a soft pressure of the hand,&#xD;
was her only reply.&#xD;
Then she arose and seated herself at the&#xD;
piano.                         ..-&#xD;
"Mr. Glenham-Robert, I mean-now,&#xD;
do you remember 'the air Gazzaniga 'was&#xD;

"Yes, to be ure. Come now, let me see&#xD;

standing at the corner, of the piano, he&#xD;

Again the door opened, and Jerqme Dn-&#xD;

ing toward him.&#xD;
" I thought yomwere not engaged, I see&#xD;

, " Rob-Mr. Glenham, this ia my fath-&#xD;

Not a muscle, not a nervo of Glenham's&#xD;
face quivered as with a smile he confront-&#xD;
ed. the banker,-aid extended his hands&#xD;
"Mr. Jerome Duval, I am happy in&#xD;
making your acquaintances"&#xD;
Duval took the proffered hand and&#xD;
bowed.&#xD;
"I know that in-extending my hand&#xD;
upon introduction as a visitorI may have&#xD;
transcended the observance of d'awing-&#xD;
room etiquette, Mr. Duval, but it is aous-.&#xD;
tom in which I frankly own I often forget&#xD;
ihyself."&#xD;
Duval gave him as,he uttered this apol-&#xD;
ogy the benefit of a searching look, a look&#xD;
whicb he remembered long after.&#xD;
"Your social position, Mr. Glenhani, of&#xD;

great banker again bowed.&#xD;
"This is Mr. Glenhain's first call, fath-&#xD;

brough you and him together.  She was&#xD;
going to say more, but somehow, she brqke&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6629-00000059"/>&#xD;
BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
To say that to Duval the crash was en-&#xD;
tirely unexpected would be wrong.&#xD;
But he thought he had so hedged him-i&#xD;
self about with collateral resources which,&#xD;
however great the run upon' his house&#xD;
might be, would bridge him over in safe-&#xD;
ty. The Great Frogtown and Greenland&#xD;
Grand Trunk Railroad with the Arctic&#xD;
extension was to have been the crowning&#xD;
glory of his life; he was its life, its&#xD;
sponsor, and he indorsed his faith in it by&#xD;
every means in his power. He issued&#xD;
circulars describing the immense wealth&#xD;
in the corporation and the enormous divi-&#xD;
dends the road would pay; lithographs&#xD;
and chromos were scattered throughout&#xD;
the length and breadth of the land, giving&#xD;
alluring views of the grand scenery along&#xD;
the line of the road, and the stock shares&#xD;
were printed upon the finest of bank note&#xD;
paper, in the most elaborate style of the&#xD;
steel engraver's art.&#xD;
By this widespread system of adver-&#xD;
tising by the easy subornation of half a&#xD;
dozen government organs and daily jour-&#xD;
nals, by distributing shares of the stock&#xD;
among congressmen and other official pat-&#xD;
riots whose services or influeince might be&#xD;
or was useful, and by his own influence&#xD;
on 'Change, the quotations of the Frog-&#xD;
town and G. G. T. R. R. had gone up so&#xD;
that in the popular view to hold a share&#xD;
was equal to having possession of that&#xD;
much gold.&#xD;
Besides, was not Jerome Duval its&#xD;
sponsor?. So everybody, widows, work-&#xD;
ing men, tradesmen, and all classes invest-&#xD;
ed their savings in this famous stock.&#xD;
Then, too, to be a depositor in the great&#xD;
banking house of Jerome Duval was to&#xD;
be accounted safe and in .A 1 standing.&#xD;
Merchants,   lesser  bankers,   brokers,&#xD;
financiers, manufacturers, and commercial&#xD;
men and professional men of every degree&#xD;
considered it an especial privilege to de-&#xD;
posit and hold account in his bank.&#xD;
"So when the crash came, when through an.oversight&#xD;
of thle groat banker, and in the first mad excitement of&#xD;
the hour, some of the heaviest depositors, In order to&#xD;
save their credit and meet outstanding obligations,&#xD;
crushed in and withdrew their deposits to the last cent;&#xD;
when thus crippled, and with no tme to meet the crisis&#xD;
&#xD;
by a sale of therF. and G. G. T. .. stoek before it, to&#xD;
his dismay, 'o sundenly dropped to one quarter of its&#xD;
nominal value-what else could he do but, like a hunted&#xD;
stag at bay, face destruction as best he ingsht i&#xD;
Thus was 'his failure accounted for by&#xD;
the daily papers.- The doors were -closed,&#xD;
and in the midst of the ruin and wrecks&#xD;
around him he stood up-enly a man-&#xD;
with none so poor as to do him reverence.&#xD;
From his closed banking house, he&#xD;
was driven slowly to his home in his&#xD;
carriage-a monarch of the monetary&#xD;
world no longer. All the wealth he had&#xD;
garnered would not suffice to save him.&#xD;
He had fallen with his ladder, and the&#xD;
country was ringing with the news.&#xD;
As he bad made his bed so he must lie.&#xD;
' There was yet, though he little dreamed&#xD;
it, another and greater blow impending.&#xD;
This financial ruin was only the-shadow&#xD;
of the coming Nemesis.&#xD;
Glenham-and Glenham's joy over the&#xD;
banker's downfall was tinged by no touch&#xD;
of satiety.&#xD;
He -was resolved 'to have the full&#xD;
measure of his revenge after he had mar-&#xD;
ried Edith.&#xD;
Yet he was sorry-he had a regret con-&#xD;
corning her father's financial wreck, and&#xD;
that was that he could not have stricken&#xD;
him down in the midst of his wealth, and&#xD;
when surrounded, by all the pomps and&#xD;
vanities and splendor with which he had&#xD;
exalted himself. For with the precious&#xD;
document which he held in the handwrit-&#xD;
ing of Abel Kramp, he himself 'could&#xD;
have toppled over the huge fabric of the&#xD;
banker's fortune.&#xD;
As Glenham laid aside the last of the&#xD;
morning papers he had been reading con-&#xD;
taining the latest disclosures and the&#xD;
very latest reports of the lesser failures&#xD;
brought about by the toppling of their&#xD;
great idol, he drew from his pocket the&#xD;
"1 document."'&#xD;
That was the name he had given it.&#xD;
It was, rather, a revelation.&#xD;
"Useless now, " he said, as he glanced&#xD;
over it;  useless now-only as an evi-&#xD;
dence which I can yet show to Duval to&#xD;
prove that I know the real cause of his&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN THE CRUSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;amp;DAncial downfall. I-wonder if he will,&#xD;
save anything from the -'wreck  I Save II&#xD;
how can he.? All must go. The clamor-&#xD;
ous crowd of creditora,will not rest untilI&#xD;
he is stripped of every, vestige of U.is&#xD;
wealth-every dollar will have to be yield-&#xD;
ed up to satisfy the Moloch of the law.&#xD;
And while he grovels in abasement, and&#xD;
is dragged down by unrelenting fate to&#xD;
poverty-I, whom he expelled from his&#xD;
presence; I, whom, with ,all the devilish&#xD;
trickery and devices his wealth could&#xD;
furnish, he drove step by step to degrada-&#xD;
tion, can revel in luxury; aye! and bring&#xD;
him cringing to my doors for relief. Ah&#xD;
after all this whirligig time rights all&#xD;
things at last., I will see Edith. She is&#xD;
fast as love can bind her. His pride, for-&#xD;
tune, power ,swept away-it remains for&#xD;
me to crown the ruin by taking from him&#xD;
his sole . remaining treasure--.his only&#xD;
child. It will be consoling for him to&#xD;
learn that she Is the wife of his dead&#xD;
daughter's husband." .&#xD;
While Glenham thus gloated over the&#xD;
retribution that had fallen upon his ene-&#xD;
my there was fast' and surely follow-&#xD;
ing him a revelation which boded him a&#xD;
fate he might have avoided,,had he con-&#xD;
sidered his own safety rather than made&#xD;
-his mind the mere nurse to a spirit of re-&#xD;
venge.&#xD;

"I had almost forgotten that. There may&#xD;
be nothingin it-and yet-prizes are not&#xD;
-so often drawn. Let me see if he had the&#xD;
ticket in his pocket at the time he was&#xD;
made, away with the, robbers who went&#xD;
through him-if it did come up a prize,&#xD;
&#xD;
103&#xD;
&#xD;
would have drawn the prize here in&#xD;
town. Those tickets are, good anywhere;&#xD;
any dealer in that sort of . thing-any&#xD;
broker will cash them. It's worth looking&#xD;
after."&#xD;
Mr. John Trueman at once resolved -as&#xD;
he expressed it "for a flyer "-to inquire&#xD;
into this little matter, so without much&#xD;
delay proceeded to make himself visible&#xD;
in the offices of divers of the brokers in&#xD;
Wall street, who advertised somewhat ex-&#xD;
tensively these schemes of chance.&#xD;
Two or three of the brokers hadn't sold&#xD;
a prize or cashed one within two years-&#xD;
this they -told him as an official-in confi-&#xD;
dence. At length he- entered the last&#xD;
office in which he considered it likely the&#xD;
holder of the ticket would have gone.&#xD;
When. Trueman entered, there was the&#xD;
elaborately dressed clerk, with his hair&#xD;
parted in the middle, and his blonde&#xD;
moustache as marvelously waxed and&#xD;
pointed as when Glenhama had surprised&#xD;
him undergoing the pleasant labor of&#xD;
scraping his finger nails with the in-&#xD;
finitesimal pen-knife. He lifted and drop-&#xD;
ped his eyelids at the entrance of True-&#xD;
nan as lazilyas before,&#xD;
The huge and, fancifully painted safe,&#xD;
the long desk covered with papers, the&#xD;
polished counter were all there. As True-&#xD;
man came in, instead of the clerk being&#xD;
oblged to undergo the painful operation&#xD;
of conversing upon business matters, the&#xD;
little short-bodied, bustling broker him-&#xD;
self came up.&#xD;
"Ah-anything in tickets" ,said the&#xD;
broker.&#xD;
Yes," leisurely replied Trueman. "I&#xD;
don't know that I wish'to invest just now&#xD;
-but-yes-perhaps I may. Have you&#xD;
sold any big hits lately?"&#xD;
' Um    In what lottery - Kaintuck,&#xD;
Delaware, or the er--ah--Havana I&#xD;
" Well-say' the Havana," remarked&#xD;
Truemaan, "that seems to show up the&#xD;
heaviest in hits-eh'I"&#xD;
" Ah--let me see'- yes -no-no, sir.&#xD;
The sale has been very light lately of&#xD;
Havanais Kentuck's played mostly."&#xD;
" I s'pose you have-you do sell a prize&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
in the Havapa now and then. What's the&#xD;
biggest you ever sold -do you remember&#xD;
Perhaps the numbers that drew them-may&#xD;
be good agaii."&#xD;
The broker 'paused. Then he tapped&#xD;
his forehead with his finger, looked at the,&#xD;
clerk who lifted his eyelids .and looked&#xD;
out through the front window at a pass&#xD;
ing wompn, and then wearily dropped his&#xD;
eyelids. -&#xD;
' Now I remember. Oh yes. I know.&#xD;
The biggest prize I have sold sice i&#xD;
moved in here was-no I didn't sell it&#xD;
either. I'll' tell you how it was, wait a&#xD;
moment" The little man turned around&#xD;
and thrusting his hand into the gigantic&#xD;
safe drew forth a large book, laid it upon&#xD;
the counter and opened it.&#xD;
" Now then; 'let me see. November,&#xD;
December-no-ah-here it is in March.&#xD;
Yes, March is the month. 11ere's the en-&#xD;
try. On the teuth of March. Ticket&#xD;
numbered 1939  One hundred thousand&#xD;
dollais. First advance, five +housand dol-&#xD;
lars by cheque; .March the thirtieth paid&#xD;
balance, ninety-fiye thousand dollars, less&#xD;
five per cent. discount. Now then," ad-&#xD;
ded tie little man looking up.  "The&#xD;
party who presented this ticket said he&#xD;
bought it in London; thit he had ergot-&#xD;
ten all about it until the day he came in&#xD;
here. He seemed excited."&#xD;
"Yes," said the clerk lifting his eyelids&#xD;
and glancing at .Trueman, "he spoke so&#xD;
quickly and so loud that he made me jab&#xD;
my peiilife into my finger."&#xD;
Trueman smiled. He began to make a&#xD;
show of beinginterested, which encouraged&#xD;
the broker to think he Vnight have a cus-&#xD;
tomer before him.&#xD;
"tWould you know him if you saw him&#xD;
again?"&#xD;
"Certainly," replied the broker, "be-&#xD;
sidos lI pow his name."  '&#xD;
"Ah!" . snid Trueman, inquiringly.&#xD;
" Iferwas an Englishman, I s'poseI"&#xD;
"No, American; ft'ely dressed, gentle.&#xD;
raply, gad all" that. Looked like a man&#xD;
,of means. I gon't know that I've seen&#xD;
him since. I took his name, I always do&#xD;
tl4t. At least the name he gave.me as&#xD;
&#xD;
his own. It might have been a false one,&#xD;
thoUtgh. Here it is."&#xD;
"What is itt"&#xD;
"Robert Glenham, of New Orleans."&#xD;
Trueman betrayed' no surprise.. That&#xD;
wasn t his style.&#xD;
'Robert Glenham. And the, chequea&#xD;
you-gave him; were theypayable, to hi-s&#xD;
order ?..&#xD;
"To his order, certainly."&#xD;
"He was a lucky man.    Ud like to&#xD;
make a hit like that'myself. When is the&#xD;
next drawing?" '&#xD;
"On the-fifteenth."&#xD;
"Have you -that number in your&#xD;
packages--1939?"&#xD;
" I'll see; if I haven't it's likely I can get&#xD;
it for you," and the, little broker once&#xD;
more thrust his arm into the big safe.&#xD;
"You can look it .up, and I'lldrop in&#xD;
in the course of an hour. Ive got to! run&#xD;
over in Exchange place a moment-just&#xD;
look it up for me."&#xD;
" With pleasure, sir."&#xD;
And Mr. John Trueman' bowed himself&#xD;
out of the office.&#xD;
Once'out he emitted, from between: his&#xD;
closed lips that sort of a low, long drawn&#xD;
whistle which might not ibe. inappro-&#xD;
priately teamed a musical-chupkle..&#xD;
q R-o-b-e-r-t G-1-e-n-h-a-m I .Well, I&#xD;
am in luck, if I never was before. llen-&#xD;
ham is the signature upon that cheque&#xD;
paid by St. Leon to Clutchit's employer.&#xD;
Either that cheque is 'another forgery of&#xD;
St. Leon's, or he and Glenham are birds&#xD;
of a feather. My mind is made up. I'll&#xD;
nab St. -Leon. That'll be step number&#xD;
one. Step number two,- interview Glien-&#xD;
ham in relation to the cheque.' 'And tep&#xD;
number three-'ll think about that.' I&#xD;
think Fm the one who will unrAviel this&#xD;
precious tangle.' Drill has business with&#xD;
this Glenham; but Drill is .close as an&#xD;
oyster. Never mind, I'll see." 'S6 cogitat-&#xD;
ing he went his 'way not a little.elated-&#xD;
with the discovery of the lottery tiokat&#xD;
clue.&#xD;
Now he had the torn -letter, the ring,&#xD;
the secret of the lottery ticket, and the&#xD;
name'of the man who presentedit.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;

Glenhapn ascending thesteps, hesitated.&#xD;
Why sould he obtrilde himself upon the&#xD;
familyin that moment mhen itshead had&#xD;
been stricken down from the Jeight of&#xD;
fortune to common povertyI&#xD;
WouldEdith receive him at such a&#xD;
tim  I  .&#xD;
These were the questions which arose&#xD;
in his mind and made him momentarily&#xD;
hesitate.&#xD;
''Then, as if decided, he rang the bell.&#xD;
The servant ushered him into the recep-&#xD;
tion-room, and in a few moments returned&#xD;
with the answer: "Miss Duv,al is in. This&#xD;
way, sir."f&#xD;
Uip'to the 'driawing-room as before.&#xD;
Her their Was with her.&#xD;
Evidentlythere had been something of&#xD;
serious import in -their conversation*&#xD;
Duval looked old, careworn, and 'there&#xD;
was a careless disregard of his usual neat.,&#xD;
ness in his attire.&#xD;
Ih voice was husky and tremulous..&#xD;
It was plainly apparent-that 6e' was un-.&#xD;
dergoing.some, terrible jn0rtal ordeal )an&#xD;

wistful expression w#ih  nil  trouble&#xD;

As'Vxiiham entered Duval arose and,&#xD;
sile tly'saluted hhh; the'iYeseated hhn-&#xD;
splf.  From Edith Glenham -received&#xD;
faint mile of recognition.&#xD;
hM. Glenliam your visit could not,&#xD;
-lave 1e ! mdde in better time."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am glad of It,",replied Glenham,&#xD;
wonderingly.&#xD;
"Mr, Glenham, you were the subject,&#xD;
partly, of our conversation when your&#xD;
presence was announced. Had you not&#xD;
arrived, I should at a later hour have sent&#xD;
for you.&#xD;
"In what way is my presence so wel-&#xD;
come?"&#xD;
"Be seated, Mr. Glenham." Glenham&#xD;
obeyed the Tequest, by placing himself&#xD;
near Edith.&#xD;
"Mr. Glenham, you pare, aware of the&#xD;
;gneat ,agd un4expected  ophletiat iga&#xD;
fallen uponme in fi pci l.1wAters., I am&#xD;
to-dayreduped ,to ,the plane of poverty&#xD;
from whch I firtarose. Of the puse of&#xD;
my downfall I alone know tlAe eet, for&#xD;
the one who has wrought this nisery is&#xD;
dead. The world and Wall street say--and&#xD;
Have not contradicted it-that my failure&#xD;
Is due to the collapse of' my great railway&#xD;
scheme. t is not so. That was nothing!"&#xD;
Glenham 'stared curiously at him, and&#xD;
instinctively, as if anticipating what was&#xD;
to come, placed his hand over ,his, beast&#xD;
pocket in which- was deposited the,'doca-&#xD;
ment left him by the dead cashier.&#xD;
- "I had, picashier, lately kifled 'by an&#xD;

hands for safe keeping."&#xD;
" Did you not at' once tax, him with&#xD;
this I"&#xD;
"No. I waited until I could make all&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
Glenham well knew the reason Duval&#xD;
had not at once brought the cashier to&#xD;
punishment.&#xD;
"This blow crushed me," said, Duval.&#xD;
I I saw the inevitable end coming, and&#xD;
yet I strove by all the means in my power&#xD;
to avert it. Had it not been for this sud-&#xD;
den panic, which has involved all through&#xD;
the country so many failures, I might,&#xD;
perhaps, have conquered, and my house&#xD;
still retained untarnished its great name.&#xD;
As it is I am-"&#xD;
He broke down for the instant.&#xD;
Edith sat motionless.&#xD;
Glenham was about to speak when Du-&#xD;
val recovered himself and continued:&#xD;
"Mr Glenham, five days ago I had hoped&#xD;
that this house would have been graced&#xD;
by the wedding of my daughter Edith to&#xD;
the son of one of the wealthiest men in&#xD;
the city-"&#xD;
"Father!" exclaimed Edith.&#xD;
"That marriage is impossible now.&#xD;
Perhaps from what I have since, even to-&#xD;
day, learned, it would still have been im&#xD;
possible, for Edith has confessed that she&#xD;
has formed an attachment for you, and&#xD;
further, that an engagement has taken&#xD;
place. Upon two conditions I give my con-&#xD;
sent."&#xD;
f What are the conditions, Mr. Duval'&#xD;
asked Glenham.,&#xD;
" The first condition is that you place&#xD;
to her credit and solely to her own use the&#xD;
sum of fifty thousand dollars, and provide&#xD;
an annuity for her mother-who now lie&#xD;
ill from the effects of this calamity whicl&#xD;
has fallen on us-of five thousand a year&#xD;
the second is that the marriage shall b&#xD;
strictly private, and shall take place i&#xD;
this apartment immediately!"&#xD;
If Glenham had been before surprised&#xD;
he was now amazed. Edith extended-he&#xD;
hand and placed it in his, and murmured&#xD;
&#xD;
" Robert, can you do this ? If not, it shall&#xD;
not separate us.".,&#xD;
"To the.conditions I assent, Mr. Duval,&#xD;
with* this proviso, that here I draw up, a&#xD;
memorandum of agreement to be ratified&#xD;
hereafter; to the fulfllment of which I&#xD;
pledge myself, and that the marriage&#xD;
shall take place, as we are, without&#xD;
other preparation, and within half an&#xD;
hour."&#xD;
To this Duval consented. Within half&#xD;
an hour a carriage was sent for a minister.&#xD;
By the time he arrived the memorandiim&#xD;
was drawn up and signed.&#xD;
Edith, blushing and terrified, yet with&#xD;
an expression of love and 'trustful hope&#xD;
gleaming through her tears, placed her&#xD;
-aand in that of Glenbam's, and they stood&#xD;
up in the dimly-lighted room, with her&#xD;
father at her side.&#xD;
The marriage service was soon perform-&#xD;
ed, and the minister departed.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIV-&#xD;
BROUGHT TO BAY AT LAST.&#xD;
"AT least, Edith," said Duval,'"if all&#xD;
my plans for your future have failed, I&#xD;
,have, in this moment of my supremest&#xD;
grief and ruin, provided for you.",&#xD;
"Dear father, all is not yet lost. Your&#xD;
name-"&#xD;
A servant entered and announced a&#xD;
visitor.&#xD;
"Mr. John Trueman!"&#xD;
"What is his business " said Duval.&#xD;
"He says it isof the utmost importance.&#xD;
He also asked for a Mr. Gunnem.",&#xD;
" Glenham, he means," said Glenham.&#xD;
" Well, admit him. I will see him."&#xD;
A moment later, and Mr. John True..&#xD;
man entered.I&#xD;
"I beg pardon for this intrusion," he&#xD;
h said, "But my business is of that sort&#xD;
which don't allow much ceremony. It is&#xD;
e with Mr. Glenham that I have this busi-&#xD;
n ness to transact."&#xD;
" Some other time. This is neither time&#xD;
nor place," interrprpted Duval. "Mr. Glen-&#xD;
r ham is engaged now. ,Wait below in&#xD;
the reception room."&#xD;
&#xD;
Sorry, but I can not. My appoint-&#xD;
ments are numerous and my'time is lim-&#xD;
ited- Life is short, and waiting don't&#xD;
lengthen it. Mr. Glenham, I called an&#xD;
hour or more ago at your hotel. As I&#xD;
came up I saw you enter your carriage,&#xD;
and heard your direction tq the driver.,&#xD;
Had I been a few moments sooner I would&#xD;
riot have had occasion to follow you here.&#xD;
Mr Glenham you're WANTED I"&#xD;
WantedI Why, what do you mean I"&#xD;
Shall I speak it out here before this&#xD;
-lady and Mr. Duval?"&#xD;
Certainly. Out with it, and then take&#xD;
your leave," said Glenham, sharply. "You&#xD;
are an entire stranger to me, and I can&#xD;
not for the life of me imagine what urgen-&#xD;
ey there, can be in your business whatever&#xD;
it may be."&#xD;
"Mr. Glenham, my name is John True-&#xD;
man. My business, as this shield will in-&#xD;
form you, is that of a detective!"&#xD;
"A detective!"&#xD;
Glenham paled.&#xD;
4 Yes, sir, and it is you I want.".&#xD;
" Me-I-what for?"&#xD;
"Ihave a warrant, drawn up this morn-&#xD;
ing, -for your arrest. In this warrant you&#xD;
are charged with the murder of. Robert&#xD;
Treinor on the night of the fifth of March,&#xD;
eighteen hundred and fifty-five."&#xD;
Had a thunderbolt fallen at his feet,&#xD;
Glenham  could not have been   more&#xD;
stunned than by this terrible accusation.&#xD;
Duval became almost livid in the face,.&#xD;
Mr. Trueman was used to such scenes.&#xD;
He was as calm as if he were merely in-&#xD;
viting a friend to dinner,&#xD;
"Not only for the murder, but the rob-&#xD;
bery of Robert Trainor on that night."&#xD;
"'No, no! It is false !. On my soul I am&#xD;
as innocent of that crime as-as-you&#xD;
are," he cried.I&#xD;
" That's to be settled hereafter. You&#xD;
are not Robert Glenham. Here is a torn&#xD;
letter found in the cellar in Pell street in&#xD;
which you lived, and into which by some&#xD;
means this man Trainor was decoyed,'&#xD;
murdered, robbed, and stripped of his&#xD;
clothing.  This letter was written by&#xD;
your wife, Mary Jaffray, and addressed&#xD;
&#xD;
to hernother. Here, too, is a ring found&#xD;
irpon the finger of the murdered man,&#xD;
Vith hi initials uppnit. 4nd to makq ps-&#xD;
surance doubly sure in the tra* of cir-&#xD;
cumstantial evidence, there was among&#xD;
the papers in the possession of Robert&#xD;
Trainor attthe time of the ipurder a ticket&#xD;
in the Bavavi Igottery numbered 1-9-3-9,&#xD;
which drew a prize of one hundred thou-&#xD;
sand dollars. That ticket you presented&#xD;
and drew the money for. Your real name&#xD;
is George Jaffi'ay, and by that name I ar-&#xD;
rest you!I"&#xD;
Glenham, with one last pitying glance&#xD;
at Edith turned, boldly and confronted&#xD;
his accuser and the banker.&#xD;
"Further concealment is useless. Yes,&#xD;
I am George Jaffray i but I am not guilty&#xD;
of murder. I have i ot that terrible crime&#xD;
to answer for." Here, Jaffray-not to, tlhe&#xD;
detective but to Duval, not deigning to&#xD;
notice the official-related the story of&#xD;
that terrible night in tho Poll street base-&#xD;
ment-the death of his wife by starvation&#xD;
and his flight. '"And oyer her dead body&#xD;
I solemnly swore to bitterly revenge the&#xD;
misery and suffering you brought upon&#xD;
her and upon me. You drove me step by&#xD;
step from afluence into the dark depths&#xD;
of poverty, You cast ;your, child, ny&#xD;
wife, off-thrust her from her home. You&#xD;
did this jin the plenitude .of your wealth&#xD;
and pride. You would not have ,your&#xD;
daughter wed a man without position and&#xD;
wealth. You have met your reward. You&#xD;
pursued me with the vindictiveness of a&#xD;
fiend. I have followed you with no dther&#xD;
feeling than-that of triumphing over your&#xD;
downfall., It was I who attended Abel&#xD;
Kramp in his dying hours, and In my&#xD;

revelation,had sank back into an .easy&#xD;
chair and had sat there motionless,' his&#xD;
eyes fixed upon Jaifray with a stolid&#xD;
stare.&#xD;
His face was as rigid and white as that&#xD;
of a dead person.&#xD;
Edith flung herself upon his breast.&#xD;
"Oh, father, father!"  But he moved&#xD;
not.&#xD;
'lrueman steppeal fortvard "beside 'Du-&#xD;

Then he turned to Jaifray.&#xD;
" 1 am sorry for this, sir," he said, and&#xD;
his voice dropped Almost to a whisper,&#xD;
pointing to the banker. "But-but--he'is&#xD;
dead I She had better be removed. This,&#xD;
Is the worst case'I ever had."&#xD;
"iEdith !" said Jaifray, "Edith!"&#xD;
She looked up at him.&#xD;
How changed her expression 1'She arose&#xD;
and grasped Jafray by the hand.&#xD;
" Conie," she 8a'id; "come! W'll-go and&#xD;

"My God! She's crazed,' exclaimed&#xD;
Glenham.&#xD;
"Mad, surely !" said Trueman.   He&#xD;
'ushed to the door and shouted for the&#xD;
servants. 'They dame pouring in.&#xD;
4 1Anil this is my revenge?!" was the only&#xD;
utterance of George Jaifray.&#xD;
.      .        .    9&#xD;
The end had come. In the confusion of&#xD;
the moment Trueman had forgotten his&#xD;
usual caution and watchfulness, and when&#xD;
he turned toward where Jaifray-had ,been&#xD;
standing he was gone.&#xD;
Escaped-&#xD;
