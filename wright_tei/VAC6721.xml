The author of this volume proposes, simply, through imaginary persons and  a succcssion of amusing situa- tions, to expose certain social errors; an attempt amply justified by authentic precedents, and the known cxistence among us of characters and associations like those herein presented. The Satire -- i it is so regarded - will be found, in its ENTIRETY, to be free from   reflection upon any legitimate and consistent organization for charity or good works; and its spirit, if considered from' the standpoint of the zeriter, and as he conceived it, cannot offend the most fastidious admirer of Christianity and good morals.

FLOWERS FROM A MORAL GARDEN, AND THEIR SEPARATE SCENTS. THERE are men yet living in New York, who will remember, if properly reminded, "Old Israel Smith;"  unless his modest etchings "on the sands of time" have been washed away by the shifting currents of our social and commercial life. Smith is a very common name; but -Israel Smith is not so commlon. If Israel could have known to what strange mis- takes such a common name as Smith would lead, without some prenomen more uncommon, le never would have named his children John and Joseph. But he did so name them, and their strange ex- periences--or some of them--form the cocoon from which the author weaves the following story. The boys were twins. So alike were they in per- sonal appelarance, that even among familiar friends one was often mistaken for the 'other.  Their likeness was not a general resemblance simply, leading to occasional mistakes in their identity; 17    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6721-00000007"/> 18    THE MSHAPS OF AIR. PELTER. it was a peefeet likeness, to the eye of ordinary observation, and to- nice perceptions a distinction wAas found difficult. Even by their parents-when the boys were ndt together--  John  was often miscalled "Joe, and Joseph  "John." When they were together, it was possible to observe such a difference in exprression, as to give to eac1h his own identity; but this waCs not so marked as to be observed whlei. they were apart. If, to any one, a resemblance so e:xat seems un- natural, or opposed to the common observation of mainkind, we prove the doctrine of exceptions by this well-authenticated fact: and the fact is per- fectly consistent with proper analogic reasonintg. All of us have seen twin-born children bear- ing some resemblance to each other; and some of us have seen such '  resemblance as conluses a casual observer. If, then, Nature, in well-known cases, so approaches an exact similitude, is it not reasonable to suppose that, in instances exceptional, Nature may so fashion twins as to make the re- semblance perfect? Butn, independent of all reasoning, we have the fact; and that, for us, is all-sufficient. They had their father's features ; and his were of that sober order, usually employed by sancti- monious spirits in making what is called "God- fearing ' men."  Why pattern men are called "God-fearing," rather than "God-loving," is only   FLO IWERS FROM A MORAL GARDEN,     19 comnprehended by lugubrious souls. Israel was a pattern man: that is, he made long prayers, with one eye open to our fleshly wants. As the boys grew  up, they developed dislo- sitions most unlike; and this, to Israel, was a ; perpetual " cross." "If John could only be like Joseph!"   was his pious exclamation, always ended by a pious sigh, when the boys were mentioned in his pres- enice. Joseph was familiar with the history of that Bible character for whom  he had been namled; and he said - whatever may   have been his; thougllt--that if the wife of another Potiphar should try him with lascivious charms, he would prove a Joseph in his virtue, as he was in name. John was the object of vicitude and prayer: he was the " bad boy "--the unregenerate - and his solemn visage was a mask, behind lwhich laughed perennial Fun. He was much about the wharves, ald listelned with enthusiasm to graphic pictures of the "Derils of the deep," of genial climes where Summer is perpetual, and where Oriental charms grace sensu- ous pleasures. Joseph sometimes went with Joh]n, and he found a fund of entertainment in the strange enchant- ments of the sea. He listened with attentive ear to stories of untutored savages, in islands far    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6721-00000008"/> 20    THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. away, and of how they lived in the supreme con- tentment of their own simplicity. His pious ardor was aroused, and he was all impatience to plant, in such a fruitful soil, the seeds of discord and dogmatic disputation. "What a field for missionary wNork!'   was Israel's commentary, as Joseph told the stories o'er. Each of the boys began, unconsciously, to pre- figure in his mind the coming years; and, before they were old enough for any actual service, they made their mimic voyages in their mother's wash- tub. When they had reached a proper age, Israel found them places, on different vessels; each for a lengthy voyage: Joseph--the pride of Israel's heart-for the South Pacific; and John--the un- regenerate-for the  lamours of the Orient. After this, for thirty years, they roved the seas; and during all that time they did not see each other. They made occasional returns to the family home, but, it so happened, their visits were at different times. About ten years after the boys had shipped as nascent tars, the good man Israel, on a bed of sickness, began to make the final footings in the ledger of his life, that he might find a proper balance to show against the unseen book of the world to come. He must have found the balance favorable, for, with a complacent smile, and with-   FLOWERS FROM A MORAL GARDEN.     21 out a murmur or regret, he left a benediction in the flitting air, and gave up the ghost. His wife had ' gone before him; and, being ever faithful, perhaps she had gone to sweep and garnish, with celestial fingers, in the promised house, as, for many years and with flaogginl strength, she had swept and garnished in the house of Mundus, against the time of Israel's CominIg. With the snapping of these cords of life, the connecting link between John and Joseph Smith was also snapped. Neither knew, with certainty, where the other could be found; and they soon discovered that there were so many other John and Joseph Smiths that the common name was like another sea to them, and they were mnerged in it. When rain-drops fall, from clouds surcharged, they patter on our shingles with their separate beats; but when they fall upon the sea they give no separate sounds, and only serve to swell the mighty roar which swallows them.    For Israel's shingles, these boys each had his sepa- rate sound; but when plunged in the sea of Smiths, they soon were wholly lost, and not so much as a phosphorescent glimmer marked where they had fallen. At the date of the following incidents, years had passed since either had received a word of    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6721-00000009"/> 22    THE MSHAPS OF MR. PEL TER. information in relation to the other, and neither knew that the, other was alive. Both of them were saving of their money; and they improved each opportunity to increase the store. In every port where bargains could be had, they made such purchases as they had trans- portation for; and then they sold or bartered them at other ports, where generous profits could be realized. Such perpetual accretions, through three decades-added to their pay--made at last a sunl quite snug; for, with their occasional pro- motions, their field for barter and their trans- portation limits were enlarged. Their natural dispositions remained unchanged in every changing  scene; unless there was a change in Joseph, where there seemed to be a growth of pious zeal in the cause of foreign missions. Some stories have been told of Joseph, reflect- ing on his honesty when entrusted with merchant- able supplies for contented savages, who, in re-  ality, needed no supplies; but as to all of these reports there was the proverbial "other side," which, in Joseph's view, cleared the ugly shades away, and left his record like a sunny sky, after scudding clouds have passed, looking brighter for their passage. What was he to do with a useless cargo?  Clothing, for example, suited to the climate of    - -1   FLOWERS FROM A MORAL G4ARDEN.     23 the Northern Pole, was hardly suitable for the natives of the South Pacific. Spasmodic clllarity did'nt stop to think of this; and whly should not Joseph make some fitter disposition? If he  was offered money for the cargo, should he refuse to take it?  Was it not a providential "lift" for him  and to o n one's injury? Surely the natives, to whom it had been sent, had no use for it. Joseph could reason on these doubtful ques- tions most adroitly; and I can not do him justice in the statement of his nice distinctions. "He could distinguish, and divide A  hair, 'twixt south and southwest side." John, with his blunt perceptions in matters ethic, might and would, undoubtedly, hlave called the whole transaction by an  ugly name.  BuIlt John could never comprehend such questions. Both at length returned to their native city; each with a resolve to quit the sea, and find the comforts of a settled home. They found the city now much changed from what it was when Israel first began to tell them of its wickedness, and for a time they felt like strangers. The remarkable resemblance of their childhood was still preserved, and similar employments had given them a similar physical development; even    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6721-00000010"/> 24    THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. in complexion they were the same, being bronzed by like exposures. Within a year after their return, both were married. Their wives were as different, in each dcis- tinctive physical development, as can be well imagined; and in mind and temperament they were as far apart. John's wife was Julia.  Perpetual sunshine rested on her face, and beamed in all her smiles. Her heart was a perennial spring, and bubbling fun gave music to its constant flow. She was well developed in every turn of form and limb, and was comely in her look.  In activity, she was as supple as an antelope, and could almost rival an athete. She had looked behind John's somber mask, and found a congenial spirit there; with this she toyed and coquetted for awhile, and then she embraced and loved it.   Before their marriage, she gave John due notice of tle quickness of her jealous choler; and after mar- riage, she was not wanting in occasional remind- ers of it. John was not at all disturbed by this, for, by nature, he was constant, and Julia was supreme in his affections. Joseph's wife was Rachel-an incarnate Pene- tential Sigh. Meekness, and a constant sense of worminess, were prominent in her professions.   FLOWERS FROM A MORAL GARDEN.     25 "All of us are worms!" she frequently re- marked, in her sprightly style of conversation. Her lack of every subtle grace and clllhrm was, to her, a most consoling fact, since it pro- tected her from vanity. "The besetting weakness of our sex!" as she sententiously observed. In her angular construction, she formed anl outward type of her inward nature; and all her juices were acidulated.  Nearly every one be- lieved her to be a hypocrite; but Joseph found in her the chrysalis of an unfledged saint. With such wives--whose virtues will hereafter more strikingly appear--John and Joseph settled down, but in different sections of the city. Being differently engaged, even here, they did not chance to run across each other; and hav- ing names like scores of others, these were insig- nificant. Each believed the other to be still upon the sea. Both had the means of living well, and they did live quite respectably. Soon after this, Joseph's missionary zeal began to find its social trumpeters; and it was not lonlg before "The Ladies' Board of Foreign Missions," then in the flush of its first enthusiasm, became excited by reports of his marvelous adventures. It was at once determined by the Board that his experience would be, to them, invaluable; and    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6721-00000011"/> 26    THE MSHAPS OF MR. PRL TER. Mr. Pelter - Ezekiel Pelter - was instructed to secure Joseph's presence. Mr. Pelter was the oleaginous member of the Board, and he advised the ladies in the business details of their work. Sanctimonious scents always perfumed his oily chunks of wisdom, and made them most agree- able. He was so in love with charity, that he lived on it: not in a shabby, slip-shod way, but quite genteelly. "Charity suffereth long, and is kind," saith the preacher; and Ezekiel Pelter was a living proof of it. If his right hand ever did a stroke of honest labor, it was done so cun- ningly that his left hand knew not of it. He called himself, sometimes, a vessel; some- times a worm; and sometimes the most debased of sinners; but he did not really think himself a vessel, or a worm, or a sinner even; and when he addressed his Maker (as he did on every possible occasion) it was in such a pat- ronizing way as to show at once that he thought himself entitled to a special hearing, and- that. God was honored by his notice. Except when devotionally engaged, or admin- istering some pious admonition, a perpetual bland- ness settled on his shining face, and gave im- pressive unction to his learned speech; and he was never known to differ in opinion from any- one who might extend a favor.    FLO WERS FROLM A MORAL GARDEr.    27 He was addressed, and spoken of, in various ways-and sometimes in peculiar ways. Among those most familiar were the following: By his wife -"PELTER!" She spoke the name with a sharp and snap- ping sound, as though her jaws were hunlg on springs of steel. He always made quick movements when he  heard this voice; for, when unusually excited, she could make the air cerulean ;-and she did, sometimes. This was Ezekiel's " cross"- this wife of his -and the ladies of the Board, without excep- tion, pitied him. When he discovered that they -pitied him, he bore his cross like a crusader in the Holy Wars-always conspicuous. It is said that le could dissolve the Board in tears by his pictures of domestic trials, and that on such occasions his large and spotless handkerchief played a leading part. By the badgered- -"Pelter, AGAIN!" -These words were spoken usually as profane men utter maledictions; but Ezekiel's mail was proof. When the ladies heard the maledicent tone they were righteously indignant; but when they saw Ezekiel with such a calm and placid look,' and such an impressive gesture of his hand, wave the offensive words away, their anger was forgotten in their growing admiration. 2    <pb n="28-29 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6721-00000012"/> 28    THE AMSH,4PS OF MR. PEL TER. "he was persecuted," Ezekiel would say; and the effect was magical. One of the sisters, more emotional than the rest, would even clasp his hand and raise her tearful eyes to his in an actual overflow of sym- pathy. By the naughty boys--"Old Pelter!" Ezekiel was too old a pelter, and too wise a one, to attack these wandering Arabs of the street; and as a duck sheds rain from its oily back, he shed the pelts of -gamin. By the. ladies of the Board -"Mr. P-e-l- t-e-e-r," with a lingering, loving accent, which always seemed to touch his noble heart. Before this le bowed, with his hand upon his waistcoat. What emotions were unspoken there, and covered by that hand, they could easily im- agine. Such "Ladies' Boards" are organized, ostensi- bly, for foreign service; and it is supposed that they employ themselves in the affairs of distant countries. We see them mount their instruments for indefinite ranges, and, with ostentatious bear- ing, prepare to sweep the distant heavens. Ad- miring this sublime astronomy, we look for new developments and visit the observatory; the tel- escope is tlere, swinging on its axis, in the bi- sected dome, but it creaks with the rust of long non-usage as it swings. Where are the observers? f  "The ineig loving acet oce i ol er.    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6721-00000013"/> t   FLOWERS FROM A MOORAL GAR4I9EN.    31 We find them looking, not through it, but through their little microscopes, and chattering like a roost of magpies, as they search for stains upon their neighbors' garments. To such ignoble ends, come, sometimes, these great pretensions! The Board, of which Ezekiel was a member, had its supply of microscopes; and the ladies were quite expert in the use of them. It was thought -among themselves-that there was not so much as a single " beam " in all their eyes, and that this enabled them  to look, with un- clouded vision, for "motes" in the eyes of others. What would have seemed to them    suspicious, if observed in one outaide the Board, was regard- ed with complacency, and even with approval, in a member of the. Board. The emotional member--who would sometimes take Ezekiel's hand, and overflow with sympathy --will serve to illustrate. Her name was Miranda Trap; or, as Ezekiel loved to call her, "My-rindy." By other mem- bers, she was spoken of as "peculiar sometimes"; and, by the irreverent, she was oftener spoken of as "gushing." If she was a vessel- and she sometimnes claim- ed to be-she was a genuine Antique, I and, be- yond a question, cracked; for, upon the slightest provocation she would leak, most copiously.    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6721-00000014"/> 32    THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. "Them tears! My-rindy," Ezekiel would say, with his hand upon her head; and then he would wrestle with his own emotion. Let future poets call her Niobe. To borrow here the poetic name, Niobe had found that a 6fellow-feeling'" makes us qwondrous kind; and, to such questionable lengths did this feeling bear her ardent soul, that she burned to break Ezekiel's cross, and to anoint him with her tearful unguellts. Ezekiel was not so cold or passionless as not to feel Miranda's sympathy; and it was very precious to him. So this good man found here a refuge from domestic storms. The ladies of' the Board observed occasional displays of tenderness between them; but they never frowned, for they knew Ezekiel's trials and the spiritual nature of his comforter. Had not the Board determined to send for Joseph Smith, it is difficult to say what might have been the issue of this growing fervor be- tween Ezekiel and Miranda; and perhaps some poisonous flower might have blossomed from it, to infect the moral garden of the Board. What happened, is reserved for another chapter.   CHAPTER   II. MR. PELTER MAKES A SAD DISCOVERY. MR. PELT'rB   knew where Joseph lived;  ,1(1] in company with others, he had seen him at his house. When there, Ezekiel, in his peculiar and im- pressive way, displayed his fascinations; and so successfully, that JoseIph was decidedly impressed bythem. By many little marks of deference and respect Joseph showed his admiratioll for Ezelkiel, who seemed, in spiritual nature, of kin to liln. If the good man swelled a little as he noticed this, it was but natural; and in this fe sho\ed that, in trivial things, he did not exalt hmself above humanity, as he did in greater things. Afterward Ezekiel reported to the Board some of Joseph's conversation, but He could not spice it with the new and strange aromas lwhichl Josepl gave to it h Wat he did repeat only served to tantalize  the Board, and to make the members eager to behold  this hero of a hundred tales. Miranda Trap, among the others, listened, with 33    <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6721-00000015"/> 34    THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. wide -eyed wonder, to Ezekiels report; for, in it, he himself was prominent. She, too, insisted that, if possible, Joseph should be brought to them. They were so impatient that they resolved to wait beyond their usual time; for, if Mr. Pelter sho1ld bring the traveler back with him, he might advise them in their work: it was vision- ary work, though they called it rission-ary, and in their view of things it was all the same. Ezekiel did not know, and in fact he was in- clined to question, whether, at such an hour in the day Joseph could be found at homle; but he  yielded to the ladies' wishes with his usual ur- banity, and took his broad-brim hat, and, with a twirl of his large and spotless handkerchief around it, to make it "slick," he bowed and started off. While jostling through the Broadway throng, with his eyes upon the street, that he might call a stage when the proper one should come, he  came in heavy contact with a passer-by. The passer-by was much more earnest than polite in what he said to him, and when Ezekiel turned, with "I beg your par-don, sir," upon his lips, the passer-by was out of sight. Bless me!" said Ezekiel. Whether he was spealing to the passer-by, or   A SAD DISCOVERY.       35 invoking blessings on himself, or addressing one on whom his eyes were fixed, it is impossible to say. He saw a familiar face, witl a look of amuse- ment on it, turned in his direction. Holding out -one hand, and with the other lifting off his broad-brim hat, he approached the wearer of the smiling face. "How do you do," said he, impulsively. "I am very well, sir," was the quiet answer; and the smiling face was merrier than befiore. "I was on my way to see you, sir," contimiued Mr. Pelter; and now he made another offer of his hand. The smiling eyes did not appear to know him, nor did their owner take the offered hand. "My name is Pelter! Ezekiel Pelter! of the Missionary Board!"  the good  man still con- tinued; and now his blandness was like a halo around his smiling face. "Do you not remember me?" "There is some mistake, no doubt," replied the smiling stranger, " for I never saw you, sir, and the name of Pelter was never on my log-book." "Surely you are Mr. Smith?" said Ezekiel, puzzled. "Ah, yes; and there are a thousand other Smiths," replied the stranger, pleasantly. "But," said Mr. Pelter, witl assurance, "you are the son of Israel Smith! all I have lived for    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6721-00000016"/> 36  THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. thirty years upon the sea! There are not a thousand ' other Smiths' to answer this lesci'ip- tion!" "You do appear to know me," said the stran- ger, in surprise; "but, for the life of me, I cal't make you out! Perhaps it is your rig that's strange. In what waters did we meet?" Now Mr. Pelter was not pleased by this reply, for he believed that Joseph Smith had noticed him particularly, and -it was something new, in his experience, to have any one forget him. Had this been Joseph Smith, he  would have been remembered; for Joseph had admired the oily look and words of Mr. Pelter. But this was John, not Joseph, Smith. With a chagrined and injured look, Mr. Pelter now continued: "The ladies would be pleased to meet you at their rooms." "What ladies?" inquired John. This question was a fresh offense, for Joseph had expressed a special wish to meet the ladies of the Board. With a crushing dignity and his severest look of pious indignation, Ezekiel now replied: "The Ladies' Board of Foreign Missions, sir!" Unscathed by the lightning of Ezekiel's glance, and all unconscious of his anger, John again inouired'   A SAD DISCO VERY.        37 ' And what do they want of mne? Tlhis was too much, even for Christian equan- imity; and Mr. Pelter would lhave turned away from him with sublime contempt, had he  not re- membered with what a flourish he had described to the ladies of the Board hs flatterinlg reception by Joseph  Smith. Reemclbering this, he  hesi- tated. It would not do to now confess that Mr. Smith had "cut himl" onl the street. He must pocket the  personal indignity and  have Mr. Smith return writh him, or belittle the imposing figure he had madle Ibefore the ladies of the Board when describinlg his reception. He could pocket an indignity; in fact, he  had done so a hundred times- it was necessary in his employment; but he could not belittle the im- portance of Ezekiel Pelter in the estimation of Board. This he lived on, and he was not so reckless as to fly in the face of his bread and butter. So, with all his self-importance gone, and with grief and indignation in his heart, he answered: "They would like to hear something of your travels, sir." "Why, bless their -hearts! I would like to please them," John replied; "aind I have a little time to spare. How far is it?" "It's very near," Ezekiel said. And, with this, they walked along together. 2*    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6721-00000017"/> 38  TIIE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. "How did you know me?" inquired John, as they walked along. "Know you!" replied Ezekiel, unable longer to restrain himself. ' Did I not talk with you? -in- your - own - house?" ' In-my-house!" said John deliberately, and looking curiously at Mr. Pelter. "I wonder if the old chap drinks," was his reflection. In a little time they reached the rooms. When the ladies perceived them coming, and heard Ezekiel's well-known voice say, 'This way sir," there was a buzzing in the room. Every one was instantly engaged in some new arrange- ment of her dress, or in fixing on some striking posture, and before. the door was opened, all were ready, and apparently engaged in some important work in hand. Of course, they were so much engaged that they did not hear Ezekiel enter, and were much surprised when they saw him in the room, with Mr. Smith beside him; and, of course, one lady cried: "Oh! Mr. P-e-l-t-e-e-r!" Then all took notice of the distinguished pres- ence, and the stranger was received in becom- ing form. It is to be regretted that Ezekiel felt the chill of his street encounter on him now.  Except for this, these pages would be graced by some   A SAD DISCO VER Y.      .39 exalted and inspiring, words from him; for there never was a better time than now  for him to speak. So it is, that all of us are made to suf- fer, through a great and good man's injury! The ladies looked for something fiolm Ezekiel; and Miranda's well was full. But not a touch- ing or a brilliant word -did Mr. Pelter utter: he  was walking in a cloud, and his thoughts were very, very bitter. Not even this detracted from lis majestic port, and with graceful motions of his hand, he per- formed the separate introductions. "How can I serve you, ladies?" was Jolh]l's first inquiry, when the introductions were con- eluded. This broke the spell of awkward silence, and Miranda, lmoved by her gushing and impulsive na- ture, quickly answered: "Oh, sir! tell us of your strange adventures! Of the sights you 've seen! and of the poor, deluded idol-worshipers!" "Do you pity them?" asked John, turning to the excited maiden. "O I do! I do!" exclaimed Miranda. "Then pity me-alld all mankind," said Johl, with a pleasant, smiling look, and bowingl to tlhe gushngl vessel. "What do you mean, sir,?" asked Miranda, puzzled, and yet much pleased by his attention.    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6721-00000018"/> 40    THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. All -of us are idol-worshipers!"  answered John. "Oh, Mr. Smith! What do you mean?"Mi- randa asked again; feeling strangely fluttered by his smiling look. "What senseless idols do we worship?" re- sponded John. "You are one of them, and yet seemn all unconscious of our adoration!" Here John bowed, profoundly, with his hand upon his heart, and the look which began to sparkle in his eyes was mistaken for one of ten- derness, by the gushing, and now blushing maid- en; and she answered-looking rosy as she spoke -by another question: "And--is it- us you worship?" Here, the Antique Vessel fairly shone; and John replied- "Why not?" Ezekiel was restless and excited now. What did those blushes mean, upon the faded cheeks of his My-rindy? The Austere Member was stand- ing by Ezekiel-nearly behind the visitor-and they could hear the conversation with Miranda, and see her flushed and speaking face. "Did you ever hear such nonsense?" she whis- pered cautiously in Ezekiel's ear. "See her smirk-and simper--the foolish girl! A pretty looking idol she would make!  He's making a fool of her!"   A SAD DISCO VERY.       41 Her feelings woulld have been quite different, no doubt, had she been standing in Miranda's place. Beads of perspiration begean to .start on Eze- kiel's face, and as he wiped  them off, other beads would  quickly formn; when the Austere Member spoke to him, the beads begyan to run in little rills in the wrinkles of his face. "Is it so warm?" the Austere Member asked, looking at his glowing face. "I had not no- ticed it." "I 'll make it warm for ldim!" said Ezekiel, spitefully, and glaring on the unconiscious John. Why, Mr. P-e-l-t-e-e r!" exclaimed the AMeI.. ber. "Come this way! hle will overhear youl" With this, they drew off tog ether, to another portion of the room.  Some of the other mem- bels, seeing this, followed after them; and they were soon  engaged in low-toned conversatiol. Soon, otler members followed, until Miranda was left alone with the distinguished traveler. Now, Joln stooped slihlltly, and, speaking in a lower tone, inquired: "Who is that oily chap?" Miranda, in surprise, replied: "Who?   Mr. P-e-l-t-e-e-r?" Yes.   said John, that 's what he called himself. Who is he, lanlow?" "Why,  sir," said Miranda, blushing, he's a member of our Board!"    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6721-00000019"/> "Does he drink too much occasionally? '" in- quired John. "Oh, Mr. Smith! How   can you think so! No!" "Well, he 's a funny acting fellow then." "How? What do you mean?" "Why, he came up to me upon the street, as though he was my brother at the very least, and insisted that he knew me. I tried to cor- rect his evident mistake, and he said that he had visited at my house!" 'Well; so he had.' "He had? For what? To see my wife?" "To see yourself, sir! He told us all about it; and what you said to him. That's why we sent him for you." "He's a-  - humbug! to draw   it mildly. I never saw him in my life before; and he was never at my house!" "W-h-a-t?" was all, in her astonishment, the astounded girl could say. "It 's all his oily blarney!" continued John; "he never saw me in the world until to-day." Miranda had never stopped to think that she might be an idol-worshiper, and that Ezekiel had been her Joss; but. now she felt it, and to see her idol overturned by this strange hand -for the lever of distrust plays havoc with our idols -and to feel the foundations of her faith   A SAD zDISCOo l'z. 4y surely slipping from beneath her, was to be coll- founded for the moment. But she had a heart of wondrolls elasticity, and witl an ilst:la for reflection, she invested the destroying hand with supernatural' power, and trampling o her pros- trate idol she set up a new dliviity, in the per- sol of the man before hler. Joln made a better looking god than  Mr. Pel- ter; and when her mind was turned in his di- rection, Miranda felt much better satisfied wVith him. In poetic fancy, she could cilcumnavigate the globe with John, and fill their sails with ao- matic breezes; but Ezekiel was too real, and he would expose his grossness sometimes, in spite of all her ideal drapery. Whien a woman makes a chanoge in idols, she feels lno sympathy for the ole dethroned; and Miranda was a woman. "What an artful hypocrite he has been!" said she, with a contemptuous look in the direction of Ezekiel. "He made himself of great import- ance! and told Ius how he had impressed you! But let him pass. Now, do tell us, Mr. Smith, sonething of your travels!" Here she gave lin such a look as had often thrilled Ezekiel witl rapture. "I have no time for any lengthy talk to-day," said John; "but, perhaps some other time I will amuse you."    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6721-00000020"/> "   THE MISHAPS OF AIR. PEL TER. "Oh! will you, Mr. Smith?"' the gushing maiden interrupted. "But now, in truth," continued John, "I have not the time. Let us see what the ladies wish." During this brief and harmless conversation the members were in earnest consultation. John and Miranda, by speaking cautiously, and in a tone inaudible to them, seemed to arouse suspicion, and Miranda's rapturous look was no- ticed by them all. Perhaps, if left alone, the ladies would not have looked  unfavorably on Miranda's evident success in efforts to entertain and please the visitor; but they were not left alone. Ezekiel was there, with lthe recollection of his street encounter, and with the greater provocation of the traveler's trifling with his adored "My-rindy." "He's a wolf!"Ezekiel exclaimed, in great excitement; "and a godless libertine!-with a h-u-n-dred wives-and c-o-n-cubines, no doubt! It stands to reason, ladies! Why did you send for him? To talk to you, as idols? No! What then? To tell My-rindy that he worshiped her? No! What THEN? I'll tell you what! To talk of heathen idols-of idols made of wood! and stone! and suchl-like idols!

It was a trying moment for the members of the Board, for Ezekiel's speech and look aston- ishled them. "What shall we do?" asked one. "Tell us what to do!" another said. What shall we say?"' inquired a third. "Tell us what to say!" exclaimed a fourth. Ezeliel, now somewhat recovered, was equal to the great occasion. "Let us confine ourselves to  business," he calmly said to them. "We propose to make up supplies for the field in Southern Africa; let us ask him what in his Opinion would   be most suitable to send." An approving look was on all the faces of the Board, and here John's repeated inquiry was "How can I serve you, ladies?" The Austere Member made the inquiry sug- gested by Ezekiel. "Send them blankets!"John replied; ,"good, warm' blankets!" With a twinkle in hs eye, he added to Mi- randa--speaking in a lower tone-"As well send blankets as anything, for the natives will not get sight of them."    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6721-00000021"/> "   THE MZSAPSS OF MR.

Ezekiel was too indignant for expression, buIt he managed to articulate, very slowly, and with protruding eyes and hands upraised:. "B-l-a-n- kets -for - South- Africa!  In the midst of this sudden consternation, John turned to his companion, and, with a nod and smile, he said ' Good day," and disappeared. When the members looked to see what ex- planation he would offer, his place was vacant, and Miranda stood alone. Ezekiel was the first to move and speak. He made a headlong rush; breaking -throught the circle of his saintly friends, ,and causing them to gaze in some surprise, on his impetuous move- ments. Stretching out his arms as he approached the maiden, and with his sonorous voice quaver- ing with emotion, he fervently exclaimed: "How often, O My-rindy! would I have gathered you together-" "You needn't mind about it!" said the fickle spinster, interrupting him; and then she drew away. Here again, a sudden chill congealed his burn- ing eloquence; and he stopped, and dropped his arms, struck by a cruel and unpitying hand.

The other members started at this sudden and specific accusation, and could not understand it. Mr. Pelter was, for a moment, staggered by the unexpeeted blow: but soon his bosom beoant to heave with indicgnation. While he hesitated, how- ever, his ardent passion for Miranda restrailed hot words of wrath, which else had crushed her, and a look of benignant pity glorified his face. He spoke, at first, but a single word; but the look of mingled adoration and reproach witvh which he pointed it, can not be pictured in de- scription. That single word was the one he loved the best of all- M IY-RINDY!" That she could hear that word unmoved, when pronounced in such a tone, and with such (a look, was sufficient even for Ezekiel to see thlat the placei he had held in her gushing heart, was closed to him for evermore. He was fired by this to defensive measures; for he  saw as well, that he must acquit him- sclf before the ladies of the Board. 'Did he say that to you, My-rinds?.?--tlat ire did not know me'? and that I was never at his house?" asked Mr. Pelter.

The 'loving, lingering accent on his name was gone; and he noticed it: he noticed also, in the member's look, what he had never seen be- fore an evident distrust. More anxious now than ever, he renewed his protestations. "I assure you! - upon my honor -that I speak the truth," said he. "What motive could he have for denying what you say? His character is high-as you your- self confess -and he is spoken of, by every one, with great respect." Here Mr. Pelter drew himself up, in his most admired and commanding attitude. "What motive, madam!" continued he. "Were you blind? Could you not see?"   Then, turn- ing to Miranda, and pointing to her: "There is the motive! THERE! He would lead that pre..

A feeling of resentment, unnatural in his tender heart, at once  ! succeeded to his apathetic misery. He entirely forgot the scriptural injunction, to turn his other cheek, and to forgive' his enemies; and, if he had thought of it, it would have seemled to him like a satire on humanity. He had many times advised this course to others, but it was quite another thing to act on it in his own affairs. In this lhe was not  unlike the majority of those who spend their lives  [ in fitting jackets for their fellows, which they themselves refuse to wear. With every step his indignation and his anger grew, and by the time he had reached h]is house a resolute determination had been formed.

But    : 50              ,   A COIP', OAISIG SITUA TI0N.     51 he did not answer her, and with clouds upon his. stately brow, he made his way at once to a private room, where lhe was accustomed to proc- pare the reports and official circulars of the La- dlies' Board. While hot with his resentment he commenced to write. Even- whe   his " cr1oss" appearecd, and ithll wondering looks inquiredl: "What are you at?" he   did  not anlser.

Whlen he had finished writing, he read what he had written, and a   calm  cold smile of satisfaction succeeded to the blandness on his face. Slowly and carefully he folded up  whaLt lhe had written. Then he sealed it. Then he wrote    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6721-00000024"/> the superscription. The superscription was as follows: With this he hurried out, and before his anger cooled, he put it in the nearest letter-box. "The villain is unmasked!"  he exclaimed; and again he walked away -not sorrowful, lut exultant. On the following day the letter was delivered. Rachel was at home, and she personally received it. She looked at the handwriting.  It was strange to her. Tlen she noticed that it was a city letter; and then she wondered from whom it could have come. She might have ascertained the fact at first, by looking at the letter; and now, as though that thought had just occurred to her, she opened it. First she read the signature. "Ezekiel Pelter--who is he?" said she, con- tinuing her self-questioning. "Oh yes, I remem- ber now; he is that pleasant and fine-spoken gentleman who called on Joseph, as a member of the Missionary Board. I wonder if the letter is for me; perhaps it is for Joseph."

She soon became so entirely absorbed in  it -so painfully  absorbed  in   it-that she changed in every look. The letter was as follows: "Dear  Madam, and Sister in the Bonds of Faith: "I find  myself in a  position most painfully embarrassing.  I have prayed  most earnestly for divine    direction,  and  He  appears to  make  my duty plain to me." (This opening sentence was one of Mr. Pelter's favorite hyperboles-especifally when about to un- dertake a  thing  of  questionable proprieity---and he was so accustomed to its use, that he did not stop to think, that in fact, lie had not prayed for divine    direction;  and  that if any  supernat- ural spirit prompted  him,    it was doubtless that of Beelzebub.  He found  it most convenient, at all such  times, to chaarge  his meanness to the Lord, and  then take  personal credit for  his vir- tues.  St. Peter must keep  a  watchful eye on the celestial gates, or Mr. Pelter will outwit him.) The letter continued: "What I have  to write will prove distressing to you; and  as  I  write my heart is bleeding   <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6721-00000025"/> for you." (Another hyperbole of Mr. Pelter's.) "Even now  I feel inclined to stop, but duty urges me.  A precious soul demands my inter- ference! Shall I be silent, and see that precious soul entrapped bly artfll snares, until the Evil One shall come and take it to himself?   I can not! Shall I not rather, by sounding the alarm, preveent the consummation of the wicked   act? Do you inquire how  all this concerns yourself? It is my painful duty to inform  you. It is your husband-Joseph Smith-who leads this lamb of our little flock to the gates of hell! Astonishing as this may seem  to you, incredul- ous as you may be at first, a simple statement of the facts will force conviction on your minid.

Rachel read the letter withl the most astonish- ing comnposure, and by the time she had finished it her face was as hard as stone. Some wives would have  been -broken by it utterly : most wives would have been so shocked by it as to display  profound  emotion.  But Ra- chel was only weak in her profession: in her nature she was as hard, and cruel, and  pitiless as Fate. Even the  wrinkles in her  face seemed to set themselves and petrify, when she had finished reading, until they looked like some rollgll clis(ol- on a granite form.  Without so much as a trembling of her hands, she folded  up the letter, and put it in the bosom of her dress. After a moment's silence she, unconsciously, bel(ct speak- "She was the fairest of the flock, was   she ? As  artless as a  child in illie  louts! T i m' most spiritual among them!

Such thoughts and self-communings did not tend to make Rachel cheerful; as the day passed on, the stony face did not relax; when Joseph entered, at his usual hour, it even seemed to harden more.  But the flashes from her eyes were like glints from polished steel. "What is the matter, Rachel?" asked Joseph, in surprise. Humph!" she answered, with a contemptu- ous motion. "What is it, Rachel?  Tell me what it is," insisted Joseph. "Have you been setting traps to-day?" she spitefully retorted. "Setting traps! What do you mean?" said he, with growing wonder. "Trap should be a word familiar to you," an- swered Rachel. "But perhaps you use the more poetic one, Mi-i-r-a-n-d-a! How is she?" 'Rachel!" now said Joseph, in a tone of sharp rebuke, "explain yourself! What is all this non- sense?" "Explain myself! That's good! Ha, ha, ha! How  well you play your part! After you - after you, sir, I will explain!" After me! And what shall I explain?" "Explain your amours with Miranda Trap!" cried Rachel, with a stormy look. "And if you tell me honestly, everything, even if I hate you,   A COMPROMzISING SITUA TION.    57 I will not despise you, as I shall if you try con- cealment!" "For Heaven's sake!" cried Joseph, " tell me what it is you're talking of!" "Then," said Rachel, drawing herself up, "you will not confess! You prefer contempt! O, you canting hypocrite! Now, Joseph had been accustomed to commnand in storms lefore, though not in such storms ' as this, but here he was not disposed to shrink, for his patience was exhausted. "Leave the roo !-" said he; and he spokle as he had spoken on the sea, when the storln was rending all his sails, and. his strong-ribbed slip was struggling, with the waves. She had never heard this voice before, and in spite of all 'her courage, she trembled with alarml. She left the room.  Some little time elapsed before she re- gained composure.  When she was restored, she reflected on her situation. Of Joseph's guilt slie entertained no doubt, and his anger seemed to her a " confirmation strong." But she had not the courage to again provoke his wrath.   Slle resolved to watch with the vigilance of hate, and to consult with Mr. Pelter on the means to be adopted. Joseph was bewildered. He had no basis even for conjecture. He would have pressed for fur- ther explanations had he not already seen that    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6721-00000027"/> 58    TIE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. it would be worse than useless. His wife had called him a '4 canting hypocrite," and this was an offense not to be forgotten. The evening and the nigllt passed by without a change in the status belli. After breakfast onl the following morning, Joseph took his hat and walked away, without a word to Rachel.   No sooner was he off, than Rachel resolved at once to summon to her aid the valiant Christian soldier of the Board. She sat down and wrote to Mr. Pelter. She urged him to come, as soon as pos- sille; and fixed a time " when," she wrote, Jo- seDh will be absent, and we will be undisturbed." She signed the letter simply, "Rachel.". She could not expect him sooner than the fol- lowing day ; and with Christian fortitude she enogagCed herself in her usual household duties. Now it so happened tlat Joseph had not been long down town, before he encountered, on the street, the good man Mr. Pelter.  Joseph was glad to see him, and, holding out his hand most cordially, he said: ' Good morning, Mr. Pelter.  How  are the ladies of the Board?  To Mr. Pelter this seemed like impertinence in the most sublime degree, and he was so in- dignant that he could scarcely speak. He drew up, and with a flaming face and a voice trem- bling with passion, said:   A COMPROMSING SITUA TIONr     59 ' I scorn you, sir!" Joseph dropped  his extended  hand at tlis, and stared at Mr. Pelter. Then his face flamed, and he answered sharply, and with angry eyes: "What do you mean, sir?" Ezekiel, not to be intimidated  by Joseph's frownl, retorted hotly: "You know what I mean! And I give you notice that I will save My-rindy from your licen- tiousness! For shame, sir! for shame! And you a married manl; and with a trusting Christian wife!" Saying this, Ezekiel passed proudly on, kaving Joseph in fresh mazes of bewilderment. "He talks about this same Miranda!" reflected Joseph. "It seems as though there was a Tralp, somewhere! but it is set too cunnlingly for me. I lever heard of such a person as Miratnda Trap. Some vicious scamp has put this up on me.   I don't suppose there is such a person as Miranda Trap! It's hard to fight such shadows. I must make Rachel explain it to me!" While engaged in these reflections, Joseph, too, Nwas passing on; but all the noises and bustle of the street did not drive away this mysteriotus specter - Miranda Trap. That night, the atmosphere at home had a smell of brimstone, and Joseph thoughlt it p)I1l- dent to postpone his questions to his wife ultil    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6721-00000028"/> 60    THE MSHAPS OF MR.1 PELTER. it cleared somewhat. The following morning was not clear, and Joseph thought that he would leave the matter for another day; or, at least, till he  came home to dinner. That morning was an exciting' and eventful one to Mr. Pelter. Rachel's letter came. He read with peculiar satisfaction, but he did not speak, for his wife was in the room. "Who's the letter from?" she asked. "Oh--it's a business matter," answered Mr. Pelter. That 's not what I want to know. WTho is it from?" "No matter, no matter,"l answered Mr. Pelter, getting nervous, and putting the letter in the inner pocket of his coat. "No matter, eh?" replied his virtuous spouse; and then she rose, with resentment in her face, and left the room. "Wife!" called out 'Mr. Pelter, presently; and she came back. "   I wish you would sew a but- toin on my coat," said he. His coat was off, and he was engaged in dress- ing, with unusual care. She took it in her hand, and asked: ' Is the button all?" "Yes," he answered. She went out again, taking Ezekiel's coat. No sooner had the door closed after her than she put her hand in the inner pocket and drew out   A COMPROMSING SITUA TION.     61 Rachel's letter. She put it, in the pocket of her dress, with a look of satisfaction, and then sat down to sew the button on. When she returned the coat, she asked: "Are you going out?" "Yes," he answered; and he was very rest- less; for it would be a sorry day for him if his spirited companion should discover his unlawful passion for Miranda Trap. So, being restless, and dreading further ques- tions, he finished dressing as soon as possible, and without thinking  of the letter, took his broad-brim hat and went away. When he had gone, his wife took   Rachel's letter from her pocket and sat down to read it. The letter was as follows: "My dear Mr. Pelter: "Ever since I received your letter I have been burning with a desire to see you  -" "This letter then," said Mrs. Pelter, "is not the first! 'burning- with - desire!'" But she was too impatient for another word, and con- tinued reading. "My husband will be away from home all day to-morrow --"  "Ah!" cried the jealous wife; but still she read. "You must come soon! and you had better come when Joseph is away, and we will be un- disturbed -  3.    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6721-00000029"/> 62 -   7EI MSHAPS OF MR. PL'LTER. "Oh, the shameless thing!" exclaimed the furi- ous Mrs. Pelter; but still she read: OO! Joseph was so angry. You must tell me what to do!  I am  half distracted, and can scarcely wait for you! Do not fail to come- and soon!  Your precious 'lamb' must not be forgotten." That was all, except the signature- "Rachel." "His lamb!" cried Mrs. Pelter, in a rage. "Oh, if I only had her here! This is the sort of missionary work my husband is engaged in! I'll serve his 'lamb' with caper sauce! and they'll be curious capers, too, if I get hold of her! O, wont I? - wont I? -WONT I?" Mr. Pelter, all unconscious of the furious storm gathering behind him, hurried on with eager steps to the house of Joseph Smith. Rachel was wait- ing for him. Oh, Mr. Pelter," she exclaimed, as soon as they were alone together. "What shall I do?' "Compose yourself, dear lady," said Ezekiel, in his sweetest tone of consolation. "All of us are worms; but we have a Helper." "I know it Mr. Pelter," Rachel cried; " but, somehow, my religion seems to fit other lpeople's cases better than my own. This is AWFUL!" "It is, indeed," replied Ezekiel; "but with proper circumspection we may defeat his wicked purposes."   A COMPROMSING SITUATION.     63 "Oh, I hope so, Mr. Pelter! I liope so! But to think that Joseph could be guilty of such a thing! I have lost all faith in men!" "Do not say that! do not, I pray you!" And here Ezekiel gave her such a glance as Miranda never could resist. It did begin to look as though Mr. Pelter, compelled to abandon the moral gardeni of the Board, was trying now to cultivate the imoral garden of Mr. Joseph Smith. "Well," said Rachel, hesitating, "I will ex- cept yourself." "Thank you, madam; thank you!" said Eze- kiel. And here they were interrupted by a ser- vant bringing in some letters which the postman had just left. Rachel took the letters and. looked them over; and Ezekiel, who was standing by, let his eyes fall upon them as she looked them over. Soon he stopped her suddenly, saying: They are in correspondence!" "Who?" asked Rachel, looking up. "Your husband and My-rindy!" replied Eze- kiel, in profound astonishment. "What do you mean?" cried Rachel in dis- tress. "There is a letter from My-rindy!" said Eze- kiel; and he pointed to the letters in Rachel's hand. "I have seen her write a thousand times, and know her writing."     <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6721-00000030"/> "   the MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. Rachel, with feverish anxiety, ran the letters over, and soon found one in a woman's hand. "Is that it?" she asked, holding up the letter. "It is," said Mr. Pelter. "What shall I do?" asked Rachel. Ezekiel had read the story of the monkey and the chestnuts, and he answered promptly: "Open it." He was anxious to see this correspondence. "I do not dare to open it! I never thouglht of doing such a thing! Joseph would be very angry!" "It is your duty, madam.  Let him see that he is detected and he will not dare to take another step! Besides, the letter will probably disclose how far they've gone already." "O, what shall I do?" "Open it!" "I am sorely tempted!" "Do it!" With trembling hands amid fluttering heart she did it. This is what she saw, and she read it to Ezekiel: "il1r. Smithi, wy dear and valued friend -- "I do not blame you for it--oh no! I can not find it in my heart to blame you- but -I am - unhappy." "Poor child!" said Mr. Pelter. "O, Joseph!-"Rachel wailed.  But she con- tinued reading:-   A COAfPROMSING SITUA TION.    65 "Your words and looks have opened up such new and sweet, delights as to fill my heart. Oh for the wings of a dove! that I might fly away from all my trials to the enchanting scenes where you have been!" "Oh! oh! oh!" cried Rachel. "O-o-o-o!" groaned Mr. Pelter. "But," continued Rachel, reading, "I must tell you of my troubles. Mr. Pelter-the odious man! -" "What? what's that?" exclaimed Ezekiel. "The odious man!"' repeated Rachel, reading. "Oh, she's lost! she's lost!" cried Mr. Pel- ter. "And where is Joseph?" cried the sorrowingl Rachel. But still she read:- "Mr. Pelter- the odious man! - has already turned suspicion on us.

A virtuous womnan's face tells nothing to her' injury! O, Mr. Pelter!' Ezekiel was not a fickle man, and without great provocation he would not falter in his alle- giance; especially when his bread amnd butter hung on his fidelity. But the most loyal and magnanimous of men may be driven to revolt. That word  odious" in Miranda's letter was too much for Mr. Pelter; it pierced his noble heart and made him  desperate. "Your husband met My-rindy first in the pres- ence of the Ladies' Board," said lhe.   They encouraged him, and I protested!7 In his sudden indignation he determined to renounce Miranda and all the Missionary Board, and to espouse the cause of the injured Rachel. Impetuous in his zeal--too impetuous, perhaps, and yeb displaying in the act his generous and unselfish nature--he fell upon his knees before this new object of his solicitude; and clasped his lhands and lifted his sympathizing eyes to hers. "For heaven's sake get up!"  cried Rachel, shocked. He did not get up, but placed his hands upon   "Imperuous in his zeal he fell upon his knees before this new object of his solicitude."    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6721-00000032"/>   A COijfPROMSING SITUA TION.    69 his spotless waistcoat, and exclaimed in dramatic  tones: Lay your troubles on this boo-som, Rachel!"

Joseph heard Ezekiel's last dramatic speech, and he stopped to hear no more. Quickly step- ping up behind. him, he took Ezekiel by the ear and dragged him howlinog to his feet; still hold- ing on, he gave a sudden jelrk and forced Ezekiel toward the door, then by a dexterous movement of his foot he  sent the good man flying throughl the door. All this was clone without a spoken wolrd; then Joseph took Ezekiel's broad-brim hat and threw it after him. Ezekiel was a man of courage; but it was a spiritual courage -his flesh was weak. He quick- ly grasped his broad-brim hat, and with a friohit- ened look behind, to see if Josell followed, he hastened to the outer door; then he rusled out, and made such progress down the street as aston- ished all beholders. Were these not veracious chronicles this scene might be omitted, for it is the darkest cloud upon , Ezekiel's long and useless life; charity, which had sheltered him so long, should cover it as well.    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6721-00000033"/> 70    THE MSHAPS OF MR.

This," said he , "explains itself; don't make it worse by attempting to excuse yourself!" Rachel sank into a chair, completely overcome. Joseph began pacing back and forth across the room. At length he stopped before his wife, and asked: "Where did you pick up that man?" "O, Joseph--" she commenced. "Stop!" he cried. "No excuses, if you please  How-came - he- h ere? "I sent for him." "You sent for him! Then you're the one that 's setting traps!"

You are in the trap; and I have caught you, sir!" "Don't try to draw me off! Explain the am- orous scene I witnessed here!" "Sir!" replied the virtuous Rachel, rising up.

He took the letter from her hand and looked at it. "Who opened this?" he asked. "I did! ' she answered boldly. "Ad do you employ my correspodlence for the entertainment of your lover?" This cut Rachel like a lash, and nearly wild she cried: "You shall not insult me by such language!" "I beg your pardon," said Joseph, with a bow and sneer. "Will you lay your troubles on my 'boo-som,' Rachel? This, I find, is the proper form of speech." Rachel felt the lash again, but again she ad- vanced to, the attack. "See what troubles you have laid in the bosom of Miranda Trap! Read that letter!" "'Still harping on my daughter,' are you?" With this, he commenced to read the letter. "What's this?" said he, looking up at her. "Oh, how in-no-cent!" said she. He looked at the envelope to be sure of the address, and then at the signature. "Miranda Trap  again!" said he.

Here Joseph left the room to find his papers, and very soon he left the house. When Mr. Pelter had placed a sufficient dis- tance between himself and Joseph Smith, he at- tempted to resume his usual stately walk and mien. It was impossible. His great heart throb- bed with grief unspeakable. No more, for him, the sweet and cheap delights of charity!  No more bouquets, or choice perfumes, from  that moral garden where he used to snuff the odorous air! No more companionship with the congenial spirits of the Ladies' Board! His glory had de- parted, and even his "My-rindy" had called him ODIOUS! ' If Alexander wept for other worlds to con- quer-and it was a very silly thing to do- would he not have fairly howled if le had lost by one sharp  stroke of fate all the. teeming worlds over which Ezekiel had held his gentle sway? That broad domain extended, as Ezekiel used to sing, "From Greenland's icy mountains To India's coral strand." But Hope would not desert him  utterly, and she sent a glint from her flickering lamp. Would not Rachel lay her troubles on his 'boo-som," and fill the aching void beneath his waistcoat? Living on this slender, single hope, he proceeded sadly to his house. He entered, and retired to   A COMPROMSINVG SITUA TION.     75 his favorite room. He should have kept away from there, for too many recollections of his de- parted glory were suggested by the strange and miscellaneous contents of that little room. Here were tracts, anc  circulars, and charity appeals--all the coinage of his cunning brain- strewn in disorder on his table.  Now, they seemed to him. like dead, inodorous flowers on a grave of buried hopes. It was too much: and in an agony of spirit which convulsed his frame, he sat down and stretching his arms upon the table, bowed his head upon them, and with a groan surrendered to despair. While thus contending with emotion, he heard a voice - a familiar voice -and one most pain- fully distinct. The voice cried, "Pelter!" What a harsh  and jangling discord in the bitter-sweets of Ezekiel's memories! He slowly raised his head and looked around. There stood his wife - his " cross"--with sleeves rolled up and fury blazing in her eyes. Her sleeves were not rolled up with reference to any pugilistic exer- cise, but because she was engaged in the unro- mantic labors of her "washing." "Do I look like a woman to be trifled with?" she asked. "No, indeed!"Ezekiel answered, with a, sud-    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6721-00000036"/> 76    THE MSHAPS OF AMR. PELTER. den quake of fear.  Nor did she look like a woman to be trifled with. then she stepped briskly forward, and before Ezekiel could recover from  astonishmient, she bundled up his tracts, and circulars, and charity lppeals, and all his precious manuscripts, and took them  from the room. She was not longo away.  W1hen she returned, Ezekiel asked what she had done with them. "They're ashes!" was the furious answer. Ezekiel groaned. "Now," said Mrs. Pelter, 'I want to have a talk with you! Tell me first, who is Rachel?" As quick as thoughts could flash, they pointed Mr. Pelter to the letter so carefully concealed. By an involunltary motion, his hand rested on the pocket where he had placed it. It was gone. "You needn't look for that!" said she; "I have the letter. Who is she? I ask." Ezekiel's ideas of moral duty, as he had ex- pounded them  to Rachel when he urged her to read what was not intended for her eye, were coming home to roost; and now he really held quite different views. But he did not state them. He thought it best to answer Mrs. Pelter. "She is Mrs. Smith," said he, now quite sub- dued. "What Mrs. Smith?" Mrs. Joseph Smith."   A COMPROMSING SITUA TIO.     " "Is she a member of your Board of Holy Petticoats? S, No." 'What did she want of you?" ' She wanted to consult with mo." "What about?" ' Some trouble with her husband." I-n-d-e-e-d!

"Well, take off your coat and help me with them." "Help - you - w-a-s-h!" "Yes! You've washed more dirty linen in your Board tlan you 'll filnd here! Shall I help you with your coat?" Saying this, she took hold of Ezekiel's coat, and in spite of all his protestations, soon had it off.

The  report cannot be fully comprehended  without a  circulmstantial detail of the action  of the Board in relation to it. After Mr. Pelter had retired, leaving Miranda, in hysterics, as related in a  former chapter, the  ladies began to clear the morall atmosphere. It was determined, from the first, that Miranda Trap was the unconscious victim  of  some  infamous    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6721-00000038"/> 80    T71HE MVISIAPS OF MAlR. PL. TER. design. It had not occurred to them till now that Mr. Pelter might be the guilty man. Miranda had distinctly charged him with try- ing to "deceive" and ' tempt " her. What did she mean hly this? And what did Mr. Pelter mnean by his references to Joseph Smith? Here was a better field for microscopic search than they had had of late, and they determined to improve the opportunity.  They began by questioning Miranda ---she still indulging in a copious overflow of te;ars. "Now, Miranda," said the Austere Member, let us hear your explanation.  What did you mean by charging Mr. Pelter with trying' to ' de- ceive 'and 'tempt' you.?" With interjected sobs, Miranda answered,- He - has - deceived - us - all!  "How-?"  "How?"   "How?" Inquired the different members of the Board. ' By pretending that he knew Joseph Smith, alnd telling us about a. pretended interview with him. This is false! He never saw him   until to-day! And if he would falsify in this, would lie not in other things?" "True ;" "Tue    True ;;" replied the mem- bers of the Board. "But how do you know that this was false?" asked the Austere -Member. "Why, Mr. Smith said it was," replied Mi-   MR.

"How   has he  tried to 'tempt' you con- tinued the Austere Member, now with stern judi- cial gravity. "In ev-ery way!" sobbed Mirlanda.  "He has tried to secure mly af-fee-tions! And-oh, for- give me, ladies, for I had  no thought of wrong- - he - did!"  With this confession  she broke down, and  all the  members raised their hands in horror. To  say that the Board was shocked  by this    I disclosure, is to convey but a  very faint impres- sion of the real sensation. "She is so impulsive!" one remarked. "Poor child!" another said. "And he a   married man!" a third exclaimed. "We   should have kept a better watch  on  him," was the judicial comment of the  Austere Member. And  abuse railled down upon the im- aginary head of Mr. Pelter, sufficient, had it fallen on his actual head, to have crushed him  utterly. They were so  indignant that, for the  moment, they forgot the peculiar conduct of Mr . Stili. Miranda was a    victim.  This, in itself ,  was a   great point gained by her. It did not occur to one of them to inquire how far Miran-     <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6721-00000039"/> 82    TIE HfSHA PS 'OF MR. PEL TER. da's gushing passion was in fault, and whether, after all, Ezekiel was not more sinned against than sinning. Miranda, under this strong support of sympathy, very soon recovered; and as a victim, she was actually caressed by all the members of the Board. "And this," said one, "is why he was so furi- ous at Mr. Smith!" '"Oh yes! I had forgotten Mr. Smith," said the Austere Member. "Tell us what he said to you, Miranda." Miranda told them what he said; but not how she had received it, or how she looked at him. "In this there was nothing in the least im- proper," was the verdict of the Board: ' but why did he make that ridiculous suggestion as to blankets for South Africa? And why did he run away so suddenly?" Miranda laughed-a genuine laugh--at this, and then explained that it was but a bit of plea- santry in Mr. Smith, and that he was obliged to go away; so he had told her. "But," said Miralnda, "'he told me he would come again some other day, and give you any information he was able to." So Miranda spurned her broken idol, and ex- cused her new divinity; order was restored and the 'moral atmosphere was cleaied. M[r. Smith was vindicated and Ezekiel doomed.   MR. PELTER IS AGAIN A yOSS.     83 After this, by formal vote, M  . Pelter wa s iln- definitely suslpended from the Boardl, a-nd a coin- mittee was appDointed to notify the fallen ,man. The committee fixed upon the day of Ezckiel's visit to the distracted Raclhel for their official visit. They had often been at Mr. Pelter's house before, and the good man usually appeared fi'on his little room, to receive and welcome tlhem. Expecting now that he would answer it, they rang the bell. The tinkle reached the kitchen, and suspended operations there. ; The bell!" cried Mr. Pelter, with the h]andle of the wringer in his land. "'I'll answer it," said Mrs. Pelter, and she started for the door. "Tell them that I am out!-left the city!- dead!" cried Mr. Pelter after ler; but she was out of hearing. "Is Mr. P-el-t-e-e-r in?" inquired the com- mittee. "He is," said Mrs. Pelter, very stiffly. "Would you like to see him?" "If you please," the committee answered. "Step this way," said Ezekiel's "cross." She led them  to the kitchen, opened  the kitchen door, and stood aside for them to enter'. They stopped upon the threshold, speechless with azLnazement. There stood Ezekiel! - the Moral    <pb n="84-85 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6721-00000040"/> 84    THE MSHAPS OF AMR. PELTER. Paragon! -the broken monument of Charity! standing by the -wash-tub and perspiring in the rising- steam. Red as he was from   the unaccustomed exer- cise, he was redder still froml shame, when he  looked down and saw his long and faded apron. In a sudden frenzy, which for the moment was superior to any fear of consequences, he tore the apron off and trampled on it. Then, with greater dignity, he took his coat and put it on, and with his lofty and commtandiing bow and gesture to the members of the Board, walled proudly from the kitchen. Mrs. Pelter saw that for the moment her au- thority was gone, and without a word she saw Ezekiel escort the ladies to his little roonm. Here the scene was too affecting   for descrip- tion. The little room looked cheerless now, for its sun was veiled: the familiar table was as empty as light promises: the tracts, and circu-. lars, and charity appeals were nowhere to be seen! "Where are your documents?" inquired one, with a sad and pitying look at the empty table. There was a look of injured innocence on Eze- kiel's face, as he replied: "Where are all my ' good deeds past?' ' Devour'd As fast as made! Forgot as soon as done!'"    "Ezekiel was standing by the wash-tub and perspiring in the rising steam."    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6721-00000041"/> 1 ;i. ! r I c i  MRi. PEL Ti R IS AGA IN A yOSS.   87 No, no! Do not say tha;t!" said the previ- ous speaker; and the ladies began to melt. Eze- kiel noticed this, and was quick to take advan- tage of it. Clasping his hands, and with a peculiar motion of his lips, famililar to provincial favorites in high tragedy- sort of tragic slob- bering-he fairly crushed them with a sense of their ingratitude. "And now," said, he, in closing his masterly appeal to their emotions. "You see the inglor- ious end of all my willing services! Wringing clothes at at dirty wash-tub!" With this, his feelings seemed to overpower him, for he sanlk down into a chair, and bowed his head upon the table. It was a scene to make! The very gods look down in pity. Afterward, in describing it, the committee said that they were so overwhelmed tlihat they could think of noth- ing but Ezekiel's misery. With tearful eyes, a melted member asked "Why did you   tell us, Mr. Pelter, that you knew Joseph Smith, and had seen himn at his house?" "Because I did and had!" said Mr. Pelter, raising his head. "He denies it that he  may discredit me! And why! Because I know his wicked purposes, and am  determined to defeat them!" "What purposes?" the committee asked.    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6721-00000042"/> 88    THE MSHAPS OF AIR, PELTER. "His designs upon My-rindy!" said Ezekiel, rising up in great excitement. "But that has been explained; there was really nothilng in it." "Who says so?" "Miranda." "From  bad to worse! From  ad - to- worse!t  "What do you mean?" "Why she has begun to practice what she learned from hi!  What?" "Deception!" "How?" "She is in correspondence with him - now! and in languatge of a peculiar character. Am- orous, some would call it. She asks hiln to fix a time and place for a private meeting, and tells him that I have turned suspicion on them. And that though she 'll not confess, she fears lher face tells something. And, for all my efforts in her behalf, she calls me O-Dm-I-O--S!" "Why, Mr. P-e-l-t-e-e-r, this is impossible! it is too shocking! Who told you this?" "I saw her letter! Where?" "In the hands of Rachel Smith!" "The wife of Joseph Smith?" "   His most unhappy wife!"   MR. PELTER IS A AIN A 70S..    89 ' And you say that you did know him, and did call on him as you represented?" "Most assuredly I did!" This information and these serious charges were too startling to be acted on without a consult- ation. Wllile they consulted, Mr. Pelter stood with folded arms; and now he first noticed his jealous wife, standing just within the door. "A pretty lot, the whole of you!" said she, as she caught Ezekiel's eye. "I told you that your Board had more dirty linen to be waslied than my kitchen held! Now   tell these moral scavengers about your precious letter - -lnd amor- ous too- from this dear, unhappy Rachel Smith!" With this she seemed to scent infection in the air, for she turned up her nose and quitted the rolon. The committee turned to Mr. Pelter, and one of them inquired: "What is that?- the letter she speaks of?--from Mrs. Smith?" Mr. Pelter was embarrassed. After a moment's hesitation, he replied: ' My wife - you know - is - pe-culiar." The tone and look with which he spoke were more significant than the spoken words. They smiled and nodded, as if to say, "We under- stand; she makes these foolish statements silmply to annoy you." Then Mr. Pelter smiled, for he felt assured that he was re-established in their confidence. 4*    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6721-00000043"/> 90    THE MSHAPS OF MR. PEL TER. "Now, Mr. P-e-l-t-e-e-r," said a member of the committee, " we have concluded to give you an opportunity to confound your enemies and put them to confusion. We will arrange some way for Mr. Smith to meet the Board again; you will be there, and in presence of us all you can confront, and, if possible, expose him." At first Ezekiel was very far from  pleased with this arrangement, for the weakness of his flesh was a very heavy drag upon his valiant spirit. Then he  considered that he  would be safe from injury in the presence of the Board; and with this reflection, he replied that nothing could please him more. So they parted: Ezekiel with reviving hope, and the committee with the sad reflection that Miranda was the guilty one. It was the return and report of this commit- tee that caused the unusual excitement when the messenger from Joseph Smith appeared before the Board. They reported privately; that is, they informed the members individually of what they had discovered; and every member was informed except Miranda. The conclusion was, that on the following day, when Mr. Smith was present, and Ezekiel and Miranda in attendance, they would 3nvesti(ate, and fix the guilt where it properly oelonged. It seemed as though Ezekiel now would step   jMR. PELTER IS AGAIN A  0OSS.   91 into Miranda's niche, and she be tumbled out of it. So uncertain is the foothold of our idols. On the following day, when the Board con- vened, there was a look of some anxiety on all their faces; but on the faces of Ezekiel and Miranda it was most marked. Ezekiel could not feel exactly comfortable when he thought of meeting Joseph Smith, and his ear would burn in spite of him: while Miranda could only bear the chilly atmosphere which surrounded her by drawing on the fires of her passion for the ex- pected visitor. Joseph Smith at length arrived, accompanied by Rachel. The members all rose up and bowed; then Joseph bowed.  Mr. Pelter was the only oie he had ever seen before; and Mr. Pelter he did not deign to notice. Ezekiel flushed at this, and the ladies seemed surprised. Miranda's heart was in su'ch a flutter that she could not restrain her mounting blushes; and when Joseph looked in her direction, she gave him such a smile as made him pause and look at her attentively. But his look was cold and curious--nothing like the smiling look of John.  Her gushing heart grew heavy as she noticed this, and the meteors all disappeared from her flaming face, and left it pale and anxious. "I beg your pardon for this intrusion, ladies," Joseph commenced; "but I am anxious to clear    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6721-00000044"/> 92    THE MSHAPS OF MR. PEL TE R. up, if possible, some strange mistakes and mis- unde rstandings." Curiosity was now alert, and every ear erect. "Is there such a person present," he continued, "as Miranda Trap?" Now the meteors tilted in Miranda's face again, and then they died away and left it paler than before. "You know her," replied the Austere Member, in astonishment, "and must know  that she is present." Here Rachel's look was keen, and she threw a sharp, quick- glance at Mr. Pelter. "Pardon me," said Joseph, witl a bow, I' but I never saw her in my life. Willyou introduce me, or point her out to me?" This is ridiculous!" said an indignant mem- ber; and she was interrupted by Miranda, who cried out in real distress: "' O, Mr. Smith! this is too much! too cruel in you!  And that, too, after all you said to me! O-o-o-o!" Every one but Joseph felt quite touched by this wail of agony, and even Rachel looked on her with pity, and on him  with evident con- tenmpt. "You, then, are Miranda Trap!" said Joseph, turning to her. "You know I am! you wicked and deceitful   AIR'.

I am very glad to find you," said Joseph, calmly, but evidently confused, -"for I have been fighltinig shadows long enough. Now, let me ask you wliy you wrote this letter to me?" Here he held. out the letter read by Rachel and Ezekiel. Ezekiel groaned. O - you-- wretch " now fairly shrieked the furious maiden. "You shall not expose' the feel- ings of my heart in this cruel, cruel way! With a panther's bound she sprung to hm, and caught the letter from his hand. The Aus- tere Member's face was hard and rigid now, and Rachel's had the chiseled look of the day before. Joseph was more bewildered every instant, and in actual desperation he commenced again. "Now, ladies, answer me this question, will you? I ask it to satisfy my wife.  Slle insists tlat I have been here before, and, that I lIrcc met Miranda Trap.  I want you, at least, to clear me in this respect. Did you ever see me here before?" "Yes!" "Yes!" "Yes! came in various keys of indignation from nearly every member of the Board. Joseph was dumbfounded. "Mr. Smith!" began the Austere Member, with her severest look, "if you have compromised    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6721-00000045"/> "   THE MSHAPS OF MR.

For- tunately for her your designs have been un- masked. Except for Mr. Pelter here--and he has suffered for his noble conduct" (here she waved .her hand toward  Mr. Pelter)--" you might yet be leading this thoughtless and im- prudent girl to ruin!" This public recognition of his services caused Ezekiel's heart to fairly dance within him; and he rose up, and with his hand upon his waist- coat, bowed profoundly. "I have seen an exhibition of Mr. Pelter's noble conduct,'" said Joseph, with a sneer, "and he no doubt preserves a lively recollection of it. I warn him now, and here, to be very careful, or he will not get off so well again." Ezekiel's fleshly weakness here caused him. to tremble, but when he heard a member say: "Hear him threaten! Mr. Pelter has too many friends!" his reviving spirits nerved his legs, and he stood firm. "Then you have seen Mr. Pelter!" cried the   Mr. PELTER IS AGAIN A YOSS.    95  Austere Member. ' When you were here before you said you had never seen him." "I never said so!  I never even spoke of him!" said Joseph, hotly; " and, as I have al- ready told you, I was, never here before!" Then he  turned to Rachel, in his sore per- plexity, and asked:. "Is this a mad-house? Or, am I demented?" He only met a cold, hard smile on Rachel's face, and she replied: "This was to be your test! Are you satis- fied?" "No!" he thundered. "I AM!" said she. "You are a guilty man!  What Mr. Pelter said of you has been here confirmed! He proved a truer friend to me than you!" Here Mr. Pelter began to swell again, with self-approval, for even his questionable acts began to look like virtues. Iad Rachel really lain upon his "boo-som," perhaps, in some mysterious way, that would have proved the crowning vir- tue of them all. Such thoughts were very com- forting. Now, this cold, hard woman, who turned upon her husband with a front of stone, crossed over to Miranda with a look of gentle pity in her eyes. She put her hand on Miranda's head, in a caressing way, and said to her:    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6721-00000046"/> g96   7'tTHE MSItAPS- OF AiR. PEL TER. ' Poor child! I am very sorry for you.

I have, been cheated of my very life, and cannot recov- er! or-ever-be-the better-for it!  God help us all - and pity - IE!" This was all so sudden, so unexpected, and so majestic in its simplicity, that every one was filled with a reverelntial awe. Then Rachel tulnecd and said: "Good ladies, I thank you for your frankness, and for your refusal to assist a guilty man in his deceptions." Without another wocld to any one, and without looking at her husband , she walked away.  Jo- seph rushed wildly after her. For a moment after they had gone, no one spoke a word. Had an angel suddenly appeared amonig them, and rebuked them for their ever- lasting  search for something to condemn, they could not have been more thoroughly astonished than when they saw this stern-faced woman en- courage virtue by lessons from our firailties, aind then pity -and forgive, where she had cause for hatred. There were chords in Rachel's heart -as there are in every one's, however rough the instrument may look--which, when touched by skillful fin-   MR.

It was -well for the now crushed and penitent Miranda that such chords were struck, for their    virlations reached, and set in corresponding mo- tion, the chords among her fellows. Ezekiel was among the first to feel the pulse; and his heart ' flew open with a' suddenl gusli of Pelterean cllhari- ty. Now   blandness settled on hs face, with a, 1)rihllter  shimmer, and  Ezekiel  was  "himself again." Miranda, taklinug courage from  his look, felt her heart thrill, and in a penitential voice she cried: "O, forgive me, Mr. P-e-l-t-e-e-r!" What could Mr. Pelter do but step up to her, and with his hands above her head, in an atti- tude of benediction, say: "Behold, how  good and how pleasant it, is for brethren to dwell together in lunity!" From this nettle of distrust the Board  thus plucked the flower of harmony, and in Miranda's impulsive  heart, Ezekiel  was again a  Joss, all spangled  with her tears of penitence.    <pb n="98-99 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6721-00000047"/> CHAPTER V.             i VIITUOUS ZEAL LEADS MR.

Not long after this, and soon after the  exciting incidents just related, Ezelkiel and Mi- randa -were on the street together, on some good work of chariity.  John and Julia were also on the street that-   J dcay, and it so happened tha they met each     : other. Julia recognized the missionary twain from John's description; and with laughing eyes she    i called John's attention to them.

He says you've got an- ther woman." John only laughed, and said, "They seem  to o offended." "Why," continued Julia, "the fair Miranda mould not even look at you9" "And Mr. Pelter did look at- you," said John. What made her color so, and seem so much confused and fluttered?" ' I do n't know." It 's very queer!" persisted Julia; then, look- ing squarely in her husband's face, she added: John, you hay' n't been talking nonsense to that girl, have you??" ' Why, no!" said John. "What are you think- ing of?" So the subject dropped: by John to be forgotten; by Julia to be stored away in her place for curiosities. When Ezekiel and Miranda returned to the ladies' rooms, they had a new sensation for the board. It was opportune; for their "fields" were very sterile now, and they longed for oc- 1) (atio1n.

"Well -she was fine-looking!" said Ezekiel: anCd he spoke with kindling eyes and waterinlg month,--like children, sometimes, when they tall of luscious peaches. "I may say splen-did!" he he -continued, after, in imagination, another taste. "Perhaps it was. an acquaintance merely,? sug-  gested one, in a regretful tone; as though they  might be cheated after all, and lose some pun - gent scandal.  "Oh, no!' replied Ezeliel.  "They were by  far too sweet for that. Eh, My-rindy? Did you notice how they seemed to lean and hang on one another?" "I didn't look at them!" replied Miranda, with a lofty look of scorn. "What is our duty in the matter?"' asked the Austere Member; and she spoke as though she thought they really had a duty in the matter.  ' "I tlhink," said one, " that we should keep an eye on them."  "And so do I," another said: and that opinion ! seemed to have the support of all. "Mr. P-e-l-t-e-e-r," suggested another, ' why  can't you keep watcl?" "I never shrink from duty, ma'am!" was Ezc-   MAR. PELTEe LED INTO DANGER.     103 diel's noble answer; and he secretly rejoiced that he could gratify himself under a colmmission so high-sounding as that of duty. Before the Board adjourned, Ezekiel was conmissioned. For many days, in spite of all his diligence, Mr. Pelter's watch was unsuccessful.  But per- severance, in the end, unless exhausted in  at- tempts at the  impossible- a limitation  whch makes a fallacious adage nearer true--will suc- ceed. He at last espied the " other  voo-man." She was engaged   in shopping on a business street, and after Mr. Pelter had caught sight of her, he gave no opportunity for escape. Julia, in her pre-occupation, and in the hurry- ing throng upon the street did not notice him. Had she been even more observing, she would not have seen him, for he dodged and concealed himself in a way  that would have honored a professional detective. Usually, Julia had her carriage with her, but now it was laid up with  some rheumatic diffi- culty, and she patrolized the more democratic carriages of the, streets. Ezekiel followed her from place to place, until he  felt nearly ready to give up the chase, when he saw her call a stage. He hurried forward and stepped in be- hind her. Now Julia noticed him, and a smile began to play upon her face.  Ezekiel regarded her as another victim, and his sympathetic heart    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6721-00000050"/> 104   THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. was most decidedly  moved in  her direction. But, of course, he did not speak to her. At length she stopped the stage. As she stepped  out, Ezekiel followed her. When she reached the pavement and started on, she looked around and saw him following. At this, she stopped before a window, and began to look at articles there displayed for sale, think- ing that Ezekiel would pass. But he also stopped before another window, and holding up his eye- glasses, seemed entirely absorbed in something unusually attractive there. Seeing this, Julia started on. Then Ezekiel also started on. She walked faster; and so did he, until he began to sweat and blow.  Then she checked her pace, and walked very, very slow; and so did he. "Now, convinced that he was really after her, she hurried on, her feet winged with fear, until she turned into another street and reached her house. She ran up the steps and rang the bell. Then she turned around to look for her pur- suer. There he stood, but a little distance off, looking at a house across the street, as though examining it with a view to purchase. As soon as she had disappeared within, Eze- kiel walked along until he reached. the house. He saw a man engaged in shaving the well-kept lawn, and stopped. Resting his arms upon the fence, he looked over.   MR. PELT1ER LED INTO DANGER.    105 A- hem!" said Mr. Pelter. And the man looked up.

"Will you step here a moment?" asked Mr. Pelter. The man walked up to him. "Who lives here?"Ezekiel inquired. "Mr. Smith." "Does she live here with him?" "Who?" ' Why, that woman who just went in." "Pretty likely, sir, for that's his wife." His -wife!" exclaimed Ezekiel. "Two wives on hand, and looking for another! Oh, what a world! what a wicked world!  Saying this, he turn  an  aled a ale away'. "What did that man want?" asked Julia, from a chamber window where she had been stalding on the watch. "Why, ma'am," the man replied, looking up to her, he 's crazy." "What did he want, -I ask!" "He asked me who lived here." "'Well?" "I told him Mr. Smith."    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6721-00000051"/> 10G   THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. "Well!" ' He asked if you lived here." Well?" "I told him yes." "Well, well-go on!" "Then he said: 'Two wives on hand, and looking for another!" "Is that all?"  "That's all, ma'am." "What did he mean by that?" "Don't know, ma'am--he did n't say-that's all he said." Julia withdrew, and put this conversation in her place for curiosities. When Mr. Pelter met the Board again he was big with his discovery. His zeal was specially commended, and  every one declared that the "work" was progressing favorably. "Now, if we only had what the lawyers call the flayrante delicto, we could take active meas- ures!" one exclaimed. "Do you suppose," was the judicial inquiry of the Austere Member, speaking to Mr. Pelter, "that you can track the man himself to his adulu terous nest?" "I can try," replied Ezekiel; implying by his tone and manner that he felt quite certain of his ability to do so. "Then do it," said the Board,   MR. EL TER LED INTO DANGER.     107 This important matter being settled, and there being nothing further of special interest in the missionary field, the Boardl adjourned, to meet again when Mr. Pelter should be ready to report. How little are such guardians of our private virtues appreciated by the vulgar throng! "But," as Ezekiel says, "their reward is sure to come; in another world, if not in this." Will it smell of brimstone? Another interval of 'unsuccessful effort on tlhe part of Mr. Pelter. He gets occasional glimpses of the man he hunts, but he can not track him to his "' nest" without discovering himself. this, for obvious reasons, he is anxious to avoid: he  has not forgotten his ungraceful exit from  Jo- seph's house. He resolves, at last, to clhange his plan of operations-to wait for a darlk and moon- less night, when the unsuspecting man will be snugly housed; unless he is absent with his other wife: in which event another trial must be made. UnLder cover of the darkness he could look through illuminated windows, and, unperceive( himself, see everything within. It was as dark as Erebus when he  set out. He found the place, andc paused a moment to consider the most favor- able approach. He would be less liable to ob- servation from the street if he selected his position in the rear. This determined him. Very cautiously 5    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6721-00000052"/> 108   THE MzISHZAPS OF MR'. PEL TER. he made his way around the house.    Not a sound was heard, except the muffled palpitations of Ezekiel's heart. Suddenly he stumbled over some unseen object in the dark. With a bless- ing on his pious lips, he fell upon " all fours," with his bland face in a thorny bush; now up again, he stumbled on his way. At last he saw a flood of light streaming from the windows in the rear; the windows were too high. He walked back toward the stable, to chlange the angle of his vision, and finally, he could just perceive the heads of John and Julia in the room.0 'He's there!" said Mr. Pelter to himself, and he began to feel about, to find some object on which to stand for a better view. He found at last a barrel-one used in carrying coal from the alley to the house. With a word of gratu- lation, he turned this over,--" bottom up." By great exertion he finally succeeded in getting on and standing up. Now his view was clear and he saw distinctly. What he saw was sufficient to satisfy the Board with exclamations for weeks to cone. He saw Julia, rise, and go up to John, and then --sit down: not on another chair, but on the lap) of the suspected John! Before he had recovered from astonishment at seeing this, his attention was required in a matter more exciting. The house-dog, haviing been restrained by the   MR. PELTER LED INTO DANGER.     109 coachman in the 'stable, for a few restless mo- ments, now camie bounding froml the stable door. Ezekiel's odor struck hill instantly; and with no reverence for sanctimonious scents, he  made a sudden leap, and struck the barrel on which Ezekiel stood. Then ensued an animated con- versation; Ezekiel dancing all the time, now on one foot, now oil the other, on the barrel-head. "Good doggie " said Ezekiel, iln his most per- suasive tone; and then he jumped, to save his bleeding calf from another bite. "'Bow-wow-woxw!"  was the dogged aniswer; and then another snap, and another jump at Ezekiel's legs. "So, so; good doggie! nice do,ggie continued Mr. Pelter. Bo-wwow-wow!" the dog again replied. Now the coachman, thoroughly aroused, rushed forth, with a pitchfork in his hand. "S-c--c--ick! sick him, Leo!

The staves now stood around him as a protecting shield to his bleeding legs.

I am not a thief!" "Get your lantern, Thomas," said John, speak- ing to the coachman, "and throw some light on this dark subject." The lantern was already lighted, and the coach- man went and returned with it within the in- stant. John took the lantern and held it up to Mr. Pelter's face, and knew it at a glance; then looking at the. barrel-trap, he laughed, and slout- ed: "By all that's wonderful! A barrel-full of charity!"

She was curious. ' Help him out of here," said she, " and bring him to the 'louse for examination." They contrived to pull him out, atld John con- tinued: "Now walk on, and we will follow." When they reached the house, John conducted Mr. Pelter to the room where he had seen the shocking sight. 1 Here the good man's sad con- dition was, for the first time, fairly visible. His face was scratched by the thorny bush on which he fell, and some blood  had started from the scratches. Whle engaged with Leo at the bar- rel, excessive perspiration had flowed the blood to untouched portions of his face; and when he  was finally released, he  passed his coal-black hands down and across his face, and streaked    <pb n="112-113 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6721-00000054"/> "2   THiLE MAISHAPS OF MR.

His spot- less waistcoat was all black with coal, and his lower garments were torn and soiled in many places. All this, with Mr. Pelter's frightened looks, was too much for Julia's gravity; and in spite of all th&amp; stuffing- in her mouth--for slhe had crammed in her handkerchief--she suddenly exploded with such a ring of laughter as set the servants in a roar, where they were canvass- ing the situation. John was nearly overcome as well, but he managced to restrain himself, and, smiling, said: "Now, sir, let us hear what you have to say." Ezekiel, without speaking, slyly made a motion with his thumb in the direction of the laughing Julia. John could not comprehend this digital expression, and he spoke again-o-now with some impatience. "Well, well, go on!" Had Mr. Pelter been in a less dangerous situa- tion, and free from all embarrassment, he would undoubtedly have improved the present opportu- nity to rebuke, with great severity, what he re- garded as the sinful lives of John and Julia; but prudential thoughts restrained him. He thought that by concealing what he sup- posed he knew of John's relation to the jealous  "Mr. Pelter slyly made a motion with hstub h ieto of the laughing Julia."    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6721-00000055"/>   -MR.

"But what possessed you to come and look in here?" asked Julia; now connecting in her mind this strange behavior with that of Mr. Pelter's following her, and his strange remark as to John's " other woman," and the dual wives. -Why, ma'am," Ezekiel answered, with some confusion, "I wanted-to see-if you were he re together - that's all." This answer only deepened the mystery; and Julia was about to continue her examination, when John turned to her and said: "I believe the man is cracked. At all events, there seems to be no sense in what he says. I think we had better let him off; he has been severely punished, as it is, for his foolish curi- osity." "Oh, yes!--by all means!- let him go!-if you wish it so." Her suspicions were thoroughly aroused by what seemed to her John's anxiety to get Ezekiel off. Then you may go," said John;  and let this experience be a lesson to you." Ezekiel was not long in going; and when he  found himself alone, he said: "It was a lucky thing for me that I knew about his Raclel!

But what will Mrs. Pelter say when she sees me in this con- dition? She'll put me in the wash-tub now, I fear." His duty first was to report to Rachel; and even in his soiled and tattered garments he made his way to Rachlel's house, and there reported his discovery. With serious misgivings, he now pro- ceeded to confront his " cross." What Mrs. Pel- ter really did, or what she said to him, was never known. He would never speak of it. BIut it was remarked, after that unlucky night, that  he stood in greater fear of his spirited companion tlan before; and it was. also noticed that, after that, when she criedl "PELTER!"  he bounded like a rubber ball. His face, too, had a care- worn look, which all his blandness could not entirely conceal. After Mr. Pelter left the house, John and Julia beogan to discuss the matter. "4This looks very strange to me," said Julia. "Whly should that man take such pains to look in here?" "I don't know," was John's reply; "but as near as I can ascertain, he belongs to a boitrd of meddlers in other peoples matters." "But why should such a Board direct its in- d uiries in this direction? What is there here to * '-ot   A1lR. PE LL T7'  LED IV TO DANGr E 117 excite their curiosity?

"You should have said so, then." "You seenmed in such a hurry to get himi off." "In a hurry! Why no, my dear; except tlhat I did not care to hear his foolish talk." John spoke so naturally, and with such a show of perfect frankness, that Julia began to question her suspicions. Then she thought that she would see if John, in any way, could clear up solme other doubts. Do you lknow," said she,   that this same Pelter followed me all the way from down town the other dcay?" No," John answered.. "But was he follow- ing you? Was he not by chance going in the same direction?" "He was following me! I tested him suffi- ciently to know.

"He said,  two wives on hand, and looking for another!' What did he inean by that?" "Why the man is crazy! I more than half thought so before, but now it's clear. What man in his senses would get off such twaddle? When I met him first he acted in a very curious way,- and I thought that he was drunk-but that I told you of." "Then, when he met us on the street, and spoke of your 'other woo-man,' he was crazy too?" "No doubt of it.  I can understand it now. He has something on his crazy mind about a woman, and, perhaps, when he saw  us on the street that day, he associated you with  her. Queer freaks these fellows have sometimes. This also will account for his following you, and for his appearance here to-night. No sane man would have perched himself upon a barrel, in the back yard, to see if we were in, when a thousand simpler ways were open to him. He could have rung the bell, and walked in to see us. It must be that the fellow's daft. I'm glad that we were easy on him.",   MRl. PELTER LED INTO DANGER.     11' All this seemed possible, and even reasonable, Julia thought. And she was satisfied. For some days after this Mr. I'elter did not leave his house. These were dark days: and even to this day a veil of darkness hides them. 1But in these dark dlays the scratches on Ezekiel's face and the bites upon his legs were healed. Then Ezekiel emerged. And there was nothing in his dress or look to recall the unlucky night. But in  Mr. Pelter's manner there was some- thing strange. He never stopped upon the street without looking around, as though   upon  the watch; and sometimes he would fancy that he  saw the object of his fear, and then he  would dodge and conceal himself, or turn quickly into another street. This fear was ever-present with him, and he could not shake it off, for it dogged him--everywhere. A future chapter will disclose the nature of this fear. After he emerged, he sent notice to the Board, and named a day when he would meet them at their rooms. At the appointed time, they  all assembled there, and when Mr. Pelter entered he was greeted and much comforted by their applause. It was understood among them   that he had made some astonishing discoveries, and that the "cause" was much indebted to his moral courage. They were impatient for the details. Mr. Pelter's natural modesty inclined him to at-    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6721-00000058"/> 120   7'TE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. tempt to check the enthusiasm of the Board in his behalf; but somehow, as it always happened in such attempts, his words and manner only served to make himnself more prominent. "It is not myself,' said he, on this occasion, "But the cause of virtue that has triumphed! I am but a worm! an humble instrument!." This was very modest in Ezekiel, but any one could see by his self-satisfied expression that he did take personal credit, and feel a personal triumph, and tlat he believed that all the vir- tues revolved around himself and made their center there. It was noticed, as he spoke, that withal there was an anxious look upon his face, and the cause of this he now proceeded to ex- plain. "I 'am walking in the constant fear of deatlh!" said he. "At any moment I may be stricken down by this bold adulterer-- this man of sin! If I fall, let it be remembered of me that I fell in the noble cause of duty!" It is impossible to describe the imposing atti- tude of Mr. Pelter as he delivered these affect, ing words. The effect upon the Board was most profound. "In the cause of duty," continued Mr. Pelter, "I am fearless! Let the base assassin strike T he will strike a fearless heart " "What a noble man!" said a weeping member.   MA'R.

The  sensation here was equal to  Ezekiel's wishes, and he paused to give it; full effect.

"Oh, do go on!" called out the vessel, not blushing in the least. "'I saw her--sit down," resumed   Ezekiel, "upon - his ---l-a-p!" "Oh, shame!"Shae" m    " Shame!"  cried the members of the Board; and Miranda now put up her hands as if to hide her blushes- although, in fact, there were no blushes there to hide.

He then related how, on the following day, Joseph Smith came in search of him, and when he could not  find him, how he frightened Mrs. Pelter by his murderous threats. In all of this, Ezekiel made  himself appear to be a much braver man than he  really was, and he assigned a cause for Joseph's anger quite different from the actual cause, as will appear when the proper scene is introduced. This is to be regretted, since many readers may be inclined to question Ezekiel's veracity, rather  ? than to admire his peculiar imagery.   He was  never known to swerve from the truth, when the truth would serve as well as imagery.  The Board now  centered all its sympathy on the forsaken Rachel. i E        !^-i'   CHAPTER   VI. TABLEAUX VIVANTS. WHEN  Rachel left the ladies' rooms, with Joseph following her, she made every effort to avoid him, but unsuccessfully. He followed her with prayers and protestations, and would lot be shaken off; but she did not reply to him lby so much as a single word. Thus they walked along until they reacheld their carriage. Then she turned to him, and said. "Which one of us shall get in here?" "Yourself, of course, if only one," he an- swered. She stepped in, and he stood still until the carriage turned and drove awav. The whole affair was so incomprehensible to him that he lknew not what to do. He saw that in Rachel's present' state he could not talk with her, and who else could furnish him a clue? Could it be possible thatt he had visited the Board without knowingo it himself? This could Inot be possible, of course, unless his mind lhad 123    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6721-00000060"/> 124    7HE MSHAPS OF' MR. PEL TER. been aberrant. Had it been?   The positive as- sertions of all the members, and of Miranda Trap, certainly seemed to show that he had been there. Was his mind  in any way disordered, and yet he, apparently, in the full possession of his fac- ulties? "No madman was ever yet convinced of his own insanity," he thought; "and if my mind is touched, that would  account for everything." But such reflections 'were too absurd, and he abruptly broke them off. When he first concluded to settle in New York, he invested nearly all his funds in al manufac- turing establishment in New Jersey, and in some vessels engaged in trade and  transportation to foreign countries. the factory in New  Jersey was in a quiet, pleasant spot, and Joseph nmade occasional visits there, remaining sometimes for several days to- gether. Now he thoughlt of this quiet spot, as a place of rest from his distractions, until his wife should find a better and more temperate mind,. le no longer thought of insisting upon an explanation of Mr. Pelter's questionable ap- pearance in his house, for if Rachel should deign to answer him  at all, she would answer by a counter-charge, no doubt. It would be best, he thought, for many reasons, to leave passion time to cool, and to avoid all further conflicts for the present.   TABLEA UX VIVANTS.     .  125 So he determined to make a visit to the. fac- tory; and with this determination he started for his house. ' Rachel," said he, when he saw his wife,  I have concluded to make a visit to the factory, and let our troubles rest until our minds are settled, and we can talk them  over calmly." Rachel was too strong a woman to be easily crushed by troubles, but she could petrify; and so she turned to stone. ' My mind is settled  now!"  she answered. ' If you need sedatives, take them in any form you please. It will occupy some time, I think, for you to arrange a plausible theory of defense; take your time--and make it strong.   I shall manage to exist if you are absent for awhile." ' I see that it is useless to attelpt to talk at present," responded Joseph. "Entirely useless!" was the answer. "I have lost faith in you! Do you know    what that means?  Do you know what it is to lose an- other's confidence?" ' Well, well; no matter now. I shall lnot be absent very long, and hope to find you in a bet- ter mind when I come back." She did not answer this; and Joseph went out to pack up his things.  Very soon he left the house. Nothing could have suited Rachel better than    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6721-00000061"/> 126   7lTE rMSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. Joseph's absence for awhile. She 'could now take any measures deemed  expedient. for securing proofs of Joseph's guilt, and without the fear of interruption. She soon stated her intentions to the Ladies' Board, and found in them a corps of ready helpers. They advised her to confide in Mr. Pelter, and be governed by his knowledgre and experience. This advice  was agreeable to her. There is a subtile law, pertaining to the action of our hearts, which resembles that so often quoted by physical philosophers as a general law of na- ture-it abhors a vacuum. This abhorrence was in Rachel's nature, as well as in that of gentler women ; and she could not help contrasting Mr. Pelter, on his knees, suffer- ing from a vacuum, and Joseph with his vacuum doubly filled. Wintry smiles began to flit across her stony face, and sometimes even warmer onles. But they found the place so strange, at first, that they did not linger there. That they came at all was evidence that Rachel had begun to modify the rigid maxims of her life. Mr. Pelter must have been a man of wondrous power, to make a change so marvelous. The ladies told her where Ezekiel lived; and a few days after Joseph left she resolved to call upon him.  Mrs. Pelter saw her when she left her carriage at the gate, and started for the door;   TABLEAUX VIVANTS.      127 an1( so did Mr. Pelter.

The wintry smiles began to flicker feebly on Rachel's face again, as she responded: "You are very kind." "What is it now?" asked Mr. Pelter, in a business way. "It is-trouble! Mr. P-e-l-t-e-e-r;" and Ra- chel struck the lingering accent on his name. Mr. Pelter's gentle heart was touched, and so profoundly touched that even his My-rindy was forgotten. There was a look of more than sym- pathy in his inquiring eyes, but Rachel did not notice it. "Trouble?" he repeated.  I And have you heard of it?" "Of what?" she asked. "Did you not tell the ladies that your hus- band was at the factory, in New Jersey?" " Yes. "And do you still believe that he is there?" "Yes."    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6721-00000062"/> 128   THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. "Then you have not heard of it!" "Of what?" "Of your husband's latest!" Latest what?" "Latest WOO-MAN!" Another one?" Another!" Rachel's fortitude was tried at last, and she began to break. "Tell me," was all that she could utter. "He is not at the factory!   He is in the city!  Go on!' I saw him  yesterday!" "Ah! now I see you are mistaken. If he had been here yesterday, I should have seen him-- he would have been at home." '"He should have been at home." "He would have been, I say!" "But he was not!' "He was not in the city!" "I saw himi!" ' It was a mistake!" "My-rindy saw him!" She was mistaken!" "We met him face to face-and he spoke to us-with the woo-man hanging on his arm!" "'This, then," said Rachel, with a sudden flash of rage, "is the secret of his frequent visits to   TABLEA UX VIVANTS.       129 the factory! O, what a shocking factory! Who is slhe? Can you tell lme who she is, and where she can be folund?" "Not yet,"  said Mr. Pelter, "but I shall track her to the nest, and then I 'll tell you." For a moment Rachel's look was one of stuple- faction and absolute despair. She began to grope as if in darkness, and to totter as if about to fall. Mr. Pelter, seeing' tlis, stretched out his arms to catch her, and called out: "Rachel!"' At this very instant, Mrs. Pelter's head popped through the dor, and she cried  "PELTER!" and then poplped back again. Rachel did not fall, nor did Mr, Pelter touch her, but she put ,one hand upon her forehead, and stood a moment speechless  then the lonog- sealed fountain of her tears gave way, and s11e sobbed as though her heart was broken.. This was no time for sentimental thoughts or speech, on the part of Mr. Pelter, for there was a passion quivering in his presence which dwarfed and stunned him. "God help me!" was all she said, when, by great effort, she had sufficiently recovered; and, with tears upon her cheeks, she turned and left the house. Rachel's agony had a human termination. After she had reached her home and reflected on this    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6721-00000063"/> 130   THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELT'ER. new development, all her other passions were sub- jected to the ruling one of hate. She resolved to find the woman who hung onl Joseph's arm --for she hated her. After Mr. Pelter had followed Julia home and made his inquiries of Thomas, as recorded in a previous chapter, he hastened to report the facts to Rachel. She would have gone at once and confronted Julia, but Ezekiel advised her to be patient, and wait until he had caught Joseph there, and made the case too clear for contra- diction. On that unlucky night when, from his position on the barrel-head, Mr. Pelter saw the shockino sight, Rachel was startled 'by a visit from the begrimed and battered man. "They're caught!" said he. And then he told his story; and she could see how nuch he hadc suffered in her service. Promising to meet again they parted, for it was late, and Ezekiel must hasten home. The proof of Joseph's infidelity was now re- garded as complete; and Rachel was impatient for the day of his arraignment. Joseph remained longer in New Jersey than he had intended when he left his house; and when he reached New York again, he was advised that a vessel in which he was part owner was ready for another voyage-indeed it had been ready   TABLEA UX VIVANTS.      13 for several hours, and was only waiting for his return. It was nearly night when he  arrived, and without delay he went on board to inspect the cargo, and give some final orders and in- structions. He was detained for several hours, and until late at night; so late, that he resolved to "turn in" there for the remainder of the night. This was the unlucky niht of Ezekiel's visit to the house of John, when he saw the shocking sight. On the following morning, early, he went ashore, and the vessel sailed. Now  he started for his house, and on the way was occupied by his perplexities: he little dreamed how much they had been complicated since he left his house. He soon found Rachel, and in a glad and hopeful voice saluted her; attempting even a caress more affectionate than usual. She drew away from him with a look of ab- solute disgust. "Why, Rachel," said he, in astonishment, ".is this your greeting?" She did not even answer him, ,and walked away. "We must arrive at some understanding in! this matter," said Joseph to himself. "I can not live in this way!"  And with a look of some determination, he started after Rachel. He found her seated in another room.    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6721-00000064"/> 182   TILE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. "Rachel," said he, "if you will help me in this matter, we can probably arrive, at some satis- factory solution. I lhave tried without your help; and only grope in darkness. This Miranda Trap is like the Old Man of the Sea to me; and un- less I shake her off, she'll ride me to distrac- tion. There is an explanation, if we can ollly find it." "Your affair with Miranda Trap," said Rachel, in an icy tone, "was fortunately discovered in time to save her." "I tell you," said Joseph, with impatience, "that I never had an affair with Miranda Trap!" "So you said before," said Rachel, in a tone most aggravating. "Rachel!" retorted Joseph, angrily, "you seem to have forgotten what I saw in this very room! and that there is an explanation- due to  me. Are you attempting to cover it by these ridic- ulous and baseless charges? Remember that it. was not a shadow -that I saw." "Sir!" said  Rachel, flaming instantly, and rising to her feet, "there are other charges, and very far from shadowy  ones, which you must meet! You will find them  much more serious and perplexing than what you call the ' ridic- ulous and baseless ones.' They, at least, are sup- ported by the most substantial proof!" "Other charges!"  repeated Josepll, with ,a   T7ABIEA UXY VIVANTS.      133 sneer. "Wh at otlher charges? Name themn! All! And let's have done with nonsense.

"For heaven's sake, speak out! I tell you that I am tired of insinuations! Name your charges!" "Very well."  Here Rachel's face was wlit;e.

"I have the proof! the proof!! the PROOF!!!" now cried Rachel, furious with passion. "You - have- no - such - thing!" answered Joseph, so terribly in earnest that he was white and calm. "But I have proof-and can produce it--to show that I have not been in' the city since I left you here!" "Where were you last night?" asked Rachel. *' In New Jersey?" "Last night I was detained by business until nearly morning-- " "Ha! ha! ha! Not in New Jersey, though?" "No." I know it! and I know what your ' business' was. You were caught last night!

"The vessel sailed this morning, and of course I have not the proof at present, but when she returns I can furnish proof." "This, then, is the way you have arranged to meet the charge, if Mr. Pelter should report! What a convenient thing that vessel was! Of course she carried off your proof!

You may rest as- sured that I know  enough-too much, indeed! What, I may conclude to do, is yet an open question. You will learn in proper time." With this she turned from him again, and again went out and left him. "That rascally 'Pelter has been here," said Joseph to himself. "He is the author of this mischief, and he shall explain it to me. I'll go to him at once!" Then he started from the house. He was not long in finding where Mr. Pelter lived, and soon found the house.  But Mr. Pelter was laid up with the injuries received the night before in the grounds of John I and Mrs. Pelter so far ob- served his wishes as to say to all that he was not able to see visitors. "Is Mr. Pelter in?" asked Joseph, when she had answered to his ring. "He is in his room, sir; but at present he is not able to see visitors," was her reply. "I will take your name and give it to him, and he will see you when he is able."    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6721-00000066"/> 136   THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. "My name is Smith," said Joseph; "'but no matter; I will call again." ; Are you Josep7h Smith?" asked Mrs. Pelter, with a sudden interest. "'Yes," he answereld. ' Colme in! come in, sir! I want to talk with you," insisted sle. He stepped in and followed her. Ezekiel, in his little room, lhad hleard ,the bell, and when he  heard the sound of voices at the door, he was curious. As he  approached his door he heard his wife invite the visitor to enter; and now he was more curious than before. As soon as they lhad passed his door he opened it a little way and peeped out. He saw and recog- nized the visitor at once. Feeling a sudden weak- ness in his knees, he softly closed the door and took out his large and spotless handkerchief, and wiped his face. "He is after me!"   said he; and then he softly locked the door, and drew his table up against it, and sat down on the table. he  waited thus, with palpitating heart, for some little time; and when Joseph did not come out, he began to think that he had another object in his visit. "Is he after Mrs. Pelter -for his harem?" was his mental question; and when he  thought it possible, he gave soft expression to his horror. "O, what a world!  What a  wicked world!" said he.   TABLEA UX VIVANTS,       1?37 When Mrs. Pelter and the visitorl were seated, she said to him: "Since your wife and my husband hlave com- menced to intrigue, I think it best for us to join against thelm." Do you  charge my wife with an improper intrigue?" asked Joseph, with a frown. Well -yes. That's what I call it. I be- lieve the ladies of the Board have some other name for it-they give very pious names some- times to what seems irregular, at least to me.'" Saying this, she excused herself, and went into another room, leaving Joseph on  tenter-hooks. She soon returned: with a letter in her hand. "You know your wife's handwriting, I sup- pose?" said she, in a bustling, business way, but with a revengeful sparkle in her eyes. "Of course I do." "Read that!" and here she handed him the letter she had taken from Ezekiel's coat. He took and read it carefully and without a word. But there was a fearful change in the expression of his face. When he spoke again he was very calm- too calm; and Mrs. Pelter saw a wicked passion in his eyes. ' Where did you get this letter?" he inquired. ' I found it in my husband's pocket." "You must let me have it." "You can have it, sir; I have no further use for it."    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6721-00000067"/> 138   THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. "I HAVE!" said he; and he spoke in such a tone as frightened her. "Your husband," he continued, " went there, I suppose--went to see my wife - his ' lamb,' as she calls herself? "Oh yes, sir." "6 And they have met each other since?" "Oh yes"5 "At my house?"9 "She came here to see him once." "Indeed! What passed between them here?" "You can judge, perhaps, when I tell you what I saw." "What did you see?" "They were in Mr. Pelter's little room  to- gether, and I went up softly and opened the door, and put in my head---- Well?" "Well; he said, ' Rachel!' and with open arms stepped up, when I cried ' PELTER! and frightened them." "Well?" "That's all, sir; I backed out again." "Woman!" said Joseph, starting up, "do you know what you are saying?" "Why how you look," she answered; "you're enough to frighten one! Of course I know what I am saying." "Do you care much for your husband?" "Do I care for hinm?"   TABLEA UX VIVANTS.      139 "Yes. Would you care much if something happened to him?" How?" "If he should get hurt!" "O, sir! now I understand you. Of course I care for him - too lmuch to have him  hurt! tIe 's spooney, sometimes, but after all lhe's my husband." "Then keep him from  my path! I will not look for him --on your account-- but let him keep away from me, or he will get hurt?" "O, what have I done?" cried Mrs. Pelter, in alarm. "You must promise me-" Before she could finish whlat she was about to say, Joseph Was rushing from the house on his way home again.  No sooner was l!e out of sight than Mrs. Pelter hurried to Ezekiel, and soon frig'htenedl him more thoroughly than sihe ; was friglltenel. "Do you know  who was here just now?" she asked. "Yes, " he answered, " it was Joseph Smith." '"And you are a lucky man to have escaped him!" - "Hlow?" asked Mr. Pelter, trembling. "What - did - he - w-a-n-t? "He wanted you!" "Oh, dear! Oh, dear! what does he want of me?"    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6721-00000068"/> "O   THE MSHAPS OF MiR. PEL TER I-e wants to punish you! He wants to kill ,VOli!" Ezekiel groaned. His legs shook so that he could scarcely stand. "Oh, wife!" said he, as he settled down into a chair, and turned his white, scared face on Mrs. Pelter, "if the Lord will only save me this time I'll be a better man! Indeed - in- deed - I will!" "Keep away  from Joseph Smith, and save yourself," said she. "The Lord don't man- age our private matters; iHe is in better busi- ness!" This was the fear which, after that, haunted Mr. Pelter whenever he walked abroad;l and for which he gave a different cause, in speakingo to the ladies of the Board. When Joseph reached   his house again, anid Rtachel saw him, she knew that there was so-me desperate purpose in his mind. She could see it in every look and motion, and before he spoke a word. In spite of every effort at composure, she trembled as she met him. "I have the 'key,'  said he. "You said the 'key' would explain it all, and make. it clear- alind so it does!" What - do - you - mean?" she asked, in a low, scared voice. "When, in my perplexity and distraction, I   'TA BLEAl UX VIVA TS.     141 asked you that question, you refused to answer me. I will not refuse to answer.  Shame on you! Shame  Shame! Slame! Now I see why you trumped up charges to worry me! It was to cover your short-conings! Look at that!" Here he threw  down the letter he had re- ceived from Mrs. Pelter, and spurned it with his foot. Rachel was so overpowered by astonislhment that she could not move. "Look at it, I ,say!" continued he. Slie stooped and picked up the letter, aiid recognized it. She turned from white to red, and from red to white. "You are' Mr. Pelter's 'lamb,' are you?" he  commienced again. "Oh!  she quickly cried, "that did not refer to me! It referred to Miranda Trap!" "Have done with Miranda Trap!' he  thun- dered. "You have played upon that string as long as it will sound for you! Hear me play on it now, and see if you enjoy the sound as much as I did! Was it Miranda Trap who wrote to Mr. Pelter to come to her when her husband was away, and they would be undis- turbed? Was it Miranda Trap before whom the sanctimonious lubber kneeled, in this very room? Was it Miranda Trap who even went to visit him, and who w as discovered in his room with 6*    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6721-00000069"/> "2   7I Az MSOiAPS OF /MR.

Oh, it was an oversigllt in you to refuse to talk with me, and to send me hunting for an explanation of my difficulties!" Rachel, with  wild and staring eyes, stood rooted to the spot. She could not speak; she tried to, but was paralyzed. The letter ly itself she might explain, but the scene in Mr. Pelter's room she could not explain to the satisfaction of a jealous and suspicious mind. It would support the worst constructions of the language of the letter. After struggling for a time, while he intently watched her, she found a voice to speak. It was a strange, unnatural voice, and full of agony.- Oh, Joseph, strike me if you will! Kill me if you will! I am not as guilty as you think me, but yet I am n ot free from guilt! I slould have been more frank with you. Do whlat you please; say what you please! In the present temper of our minds I cannot explain!   This much I'll say -and  God knows I speak the truth - I am better, fir better, than you think me; though not so good as I profess to be!" Her evident distress touched Joseph's magnan- imity, and he replied: "Let us drop the subject for the present." Rachel was quick-to accept the proffered truce,   'TABLEAUX VIVANTS.       1:43 and for the time the warfare was suspended. Then Joseph left the house again to go where business duties called him. Rachel's reflections were very bitter. In spite of his supposedl lniscondluct, and what she re- garded as the concltlsive proof of it, he held her at advantage by his discovery of her ilpruldence. Mr. Pelter was the only wiitness as to Joseph's infidelity, and now he would be discredited ald male to appear a dishonorable conspirator. Jo- seph still denied his guilt, and could continue to successfully deny it, unless the proof was stronger. "If I could only catch them!   And I will if such a thing is possible," she said. To accomplish this, it would be necessary to communicate again with Mr. Pelter ;for he was the only one who knew and could identify the woman. As she thought of this, she felt inclined at first to abandon the attempt; for if Joseph should discover another private meeting witl Mr. Pelter, hler case would be a desperate one. "But," she reflected, "it is desperate now, and I must take the risk." She could not go again to Mr. Pelter's house, and she did not dare to write to him ; but she could arrange to meet him at the ladies' rooms, and this, at length, she determined on.    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6721-00000070"/> CHAPTER   VII. JOSEPH WRESTLES WITH TEMPTATION. RACHEL  would  not be precipitate.  Joseph might admit his guilt, and render further es- pionaye unnecessary. But, as days' passed by, he did not confess, nor in any way refer to the charges made. Evi- dently he expected her to speak, and when she continued silent, he grew colder and more dis- tant. She would not speak until slhe could con- found him by her personal observations. She felt quite certain of finding him with the suspected woman before very long, for she concluded that he must manage somehow   to divide his time between them; and she thought when he  told one that he was at the factory, he was really with the other. So matters rested until  Ezekiel's scratches healed, and he had miade his astonishing report to the ladies' Board. Shortly after this, Rachel, tlrough the ladies of the Board, arranged to meet Ezekiel at the ladies' "4   YO7EPH zWkESTLES WITH TEL'APTrA TON.   145 rooms. When they met, she urged him to con- tinue his investigations. Up to this timle, as has been already shown, the call of duty was to Mr. Pelter like a bugle-call to battle in a veteran army; but now the call was drowned in tlhe louder cry of fear, and he was not so ready as before to confront the wrath of Joseph, even with his Christian armor on. But after much persua- sion, he finally consented ; for in spite of all his fears, he had great colfidence in his dodging capabilities. It was arranged that on the follow- ing day, at a certain hour, Rachel should meet him on Broadway in a hired carriage. The place agreed upon was near where Ezekiel had pre- viously encountered Julia, when she was engaged in shopping. And the carriage was to be a hired one, that it mlight be less likely to attract atten- tion than her own if Joseph should appear.  It was thought to be quite likely that Julia would be found again engaged in sholpping tlhere; and if she was not, tlen they could drive to the neighborhood where Julia lived, and arrange for observations from that locality. On the following day, as the appointed hour drew  near, the Fates seemed  all p1ropitious. Ezekiel, in his impatience, arrived in advance of the hour named   andc it -was fortunate that it so happened. He had hardly reached the place, when he saw Joseph coming froim   the opposite    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6721-00000071"/> "6    THE MSHAPS OF MR. PEL .LTER. direction. He dodged and  skipped with great agility, until he had crossed the street; then he very quickly turned around - and saw Joseph en- ter a shop opposite, where gentlemen's clothing was kept for sale. He did not come out imme- diately, and while Ezekiel watched the door Rta- chel drove up in hel h ired carriage. Mr1 Pelter, now protected by the intervening carriage, hurried back across the street, and fron the street-side of the carriage gave Rachel warn- ing- of Joseph's presence. With a sudden start, and quiveringl from excitement, she let fall the carriage curtain, and inlited Mr. Pelter to a seat beside her. He lost no time in taking it. Look- ing from a little peep-hole, which they very soon arranged, at the side of the carriage, curtain, they watched the door for Joseph's re-appearance. He soon came out, dressed cap-a-pie in a new and becoming suit of clothes; even his hat was new. They were so engaged in seeing this that they did not notice that at the very moment another carriage came, and stopped' immediately in front of them, and very near; nor did they notice thlat a comely and smiling woman called out from the otler carriage, and made Joseph look that way. They saw Joseph turn and stop. Then they looked to see what had stopped him. Their carriage fiont was slightly turned toward the street, and the other carriage was squarely at   7OSEPI WRZESTLES WIT/T   TEAMPTT FTIOATN 147 the curb-stone, and could be seen from the little peep-hole. The other carriage was a handsome one o and arranged in open style; and they saw 1 lady in it, beckoning to Joseph. Rachel's eyes were wile with wonder as she took in the sight, and called Ezekiel's attention to it. "Bless me!" he cried, with a sudden start. "It is - the- v-e-r-y -- woo-man!" They could hear her as she spoke to Joseph. "Come! Get in and go with me!" said shle. "I will bring you back after luncheol, if you wish it. I want to talk with you aO moment." Joseph hesitated, and even seemed to be pr1o- testing. But she would not listen to him, anlld at last he did get in, and the handsome car- riage turned and drove away. Racliel, with a white, stern face and coin- pressed lips, called sharply to the driver and ordered him to drive after them. And so he  did. "I want you to go and lunch with me to- day," said Julia, as she and Joseph drove away. Then, looking in his face, sle added: "Why, you look as solemn as a ftneral!  Somehow- though how I cannot say exactly--but so)mehow, you look almost straige to me.  Perhaps it 's that new suit of clothes and a different hat." Joseph was too full of speculations and grow- ing curiosity to reply at once. "She must know    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6721-00000072"/> "8   T7l E AMnISHAPS OF MR. PEL TER. me well," he thought, "to notice that I have alotler suit of clothes and a different hat." Julia kept her smiling eyes upon him, and he  beg'an to feel the fascinating spell; perhaps he made no effort to resist it. The contrast, cer- tainly, between this face and Rachel's was most striking, and Joseph now was suffering from a vacuum. But why did she call him?   What did she want? At first he thought that she had some business inquiries to make, and that being on the street, and in her carriagTe, it was natural to call him there. But when she talked simply of taking' him to luncheon, and spoke not a word of business, he was puzzled and uneasy. What if he had been entrapped by a charmer of the denmi-monde? Inwardly he thanked his lucky stars that Rachel could not get hold of this. "Why don't you answer me?"    Julia asked. "You look worried! What troubles you?" Oh," said Joseph, reminded by the question of his domestic troubles, "the  very mischief seems to be in everything! I almost wish that I was dead!" "Cheer up!" said Julia. "In this sad mood you are not like yourself.  Even  your voice sounds strange. Tell me what troubles you, and it will be curious if we do not make the troubles fly!"

All this had a sound of reason ; and if Joseph saw no sophistry, let it be remembered that there was a spell upon him. If objectors would sit in judgment on him, let them first surround the judgment-seat with s ule  witching eyes as Julia had.  It was a happy thought to put a bandage on the eyes of Justice. Then came other stumbling-blocks in Joseph's way to trip up hs virtuous feet. Rachell  had destroyed the comforts of 'his home, and fairly driven him to seek agreeable society abroad; if he found agreeable society, why should  he not enjoy it, so long as he did not go too far? He would not go too far!    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6721-00000073"/> 150   THE MSHAPS OF A/'. PELTER. But he had already gone too far; when he  cargite with temptation, he was then undone. He should have said, 'Behind me!  When Julia touched his hand, and gave him such a smile, he  made no attempt to hold back the sudden tide of pleasure which gulped him in its amorous flood. It was the old, old story. He did not stop to think that turtle-coves, like other birds, are poisoned by the exhalations from the waters of Avernus. Seeing that Joseph did not seem  inclined to tell her of his troubles now, Julia resolved to wait until they could sit down at home, and have sufficient time for a full discussion. She wondered what the trouble was a hundred times, but she did not ask again. At length she said. thkinng to turn the cur- rent of his thoughts: "I had an object in bringing you with me to- day; and it is a selfish one-as usual, perhaps." "Now," thought Joseph, "she is coming to her business, after all. I shall be glad to know what I am about, for I began to fear that she would muddle me as much as Rachel did." "I want you," continued she, "to get some tickets for the theater to-night; if We wait till evening the best seats will be taken; you can get them after lunch. Several of my friends are going, and I told them that I would go."   YOSEPH WRESTLES WITH TEAMPTA TION. 151 Joseph was shocked. He was one of those who profess to think that theaters are but the gilded gateways to perdition; and it was. not strange that he experienced a virtuous recoil as he  listen- ed to this proposition, and thought of being seen in such a place with this strange and handso0me woman. "What would the brethren acnd the sis- ters say? And what would Rachel say?"   In truth, with him, as with very many others of like pretensions, the thought of what might be said had greater force by far than the restraints of conscience; but it contributed to his self-right- eousness to put it on his conscience, and so he did. ' Impossible!" he answered. "Impossible! I could not think of such a thing!" Julia's rosy lips were made for pouts as well as smiles, and she pouted now most decidedly. "^Very well, sir,--very well!" she answered, in a pet. After this, the silence was unbroken until they reached the house. Joseph at once observed thlat the house was in a respectable, and even fashion- able, locality. Before reaching it he had deter- mined that he would not go in, but when he saw the stamp of respectability on its front, he thought that he would not be compromised if he did go in. He did go in. He followed Julia like one walking in a sleep, until she reached her boudoir; here she turned to him and said:    <pb n="152-153 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6721-00000074"/> 152   THE /l MSI4 PS OF MR.

Before Joseph could recover from   his inde- scribable astonishment, she retreated, looking back and smiling as she went-- to a sleeping-room and closed the door. Joseph felt the power of her charms, and feared if she returned to the assault that he  could not resist it. Besides, if she was what she ought to be, how could she address him as she did, and receive him -a stranger --in her boudoir? It will be remembered, that in his early days andt before he went to sea he had resolved that in such  a situation he would prove his strength. Here was the first occasion ever offered for the actual test. "She is another Mrs. Potiphar!  said Joseph to himself, " and I will fly!" He sat down carefully, and drew off his boots; with these in hand  he  rose, and with noise- less steps, approached the door. Very softly he  unlatched the door ,and opened it: and then, on noiseless toes; he  stole eautiously away. In the vestibule below he pulled on his boots, and then made boldly for the outer door. A servant saw him as he tip-toed througlh the hall, with his boots in hand, and she informed  "She retreated, looking back, and smiling as bhe went to a sleeping ,room."    <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6721-00000075"/> r1 I I   JOSEP/Z WRESTLES WITH TEMSPTA TIOQV. 155 another servant, and both hastened to a window to see what he was about. Julia, hearing the sound of carriage wheels directly after, hurried to her window. Rachel did not once lose sight of Julia's ear- iage until it drew up at Julia's door, and lhad left its occupants and driven off., While Julia Land Joseph were getting out and walking up the steps, Rachel stopped. When she saw them en- ter she started on, and  drove slowly past the house and fixed it in her mind. After she had passed a little distance, she had her carriarge turn to the most favorable position, and then  she stopped to watch. It was growing very warm for Mr. Pelter now, and he began to  perspire freely; the prospect of confronting Joseph was too much for him, and his courage began to ooze away. Rachel was so entirely absorbed in other things that she did not observe his perturbation. Her face had never been so hard as now, nor her look so keen ; but there was no other object for that look so keen thha Julia's door. Mr. Pelter grew more restless and excited wiith every passing moment; and when it seemed that Joseph might appear, before he could escape, hMis fear' found tongue. he  elntreated Raclhe] to re- lease him while he lhad a chance for safety; and had she looked around, she would have been    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6721-00000076"/> 156   THE MSIrl, PS OF MR.

With her eyes on Julia's door, and without moving from her fixed position, she answered in a strange, unnatural tone: "Go!" With a sigh of infinite relief, the good man wiped his face again, and prepared to go. As he rose up and put his foot upon the carriage step, he looked back across his shoulder, and quickly asked: "Will you come to the ladies' rooms?" She did not answer-she did not seem to hear him--and her eyes were fixed on Julia's door. So Mr. Pelter left her. He hurried to the pavement on the other side from Julia's house, and had almost reached a point directly oppo- site, when he saw the hall door open and Jo- seph Smith step out. At the very instant, he heard the crack of the driver's whip and the sound of rapid carriage wheels behind. He looked behind, and saw Rachel's carriage dash- ing up.  He looked  across, and saw Joseph watching him as he came cown the steps. With terror in his face, and a sudden bound, he ran, with Fear upon his flying heels. As he ran, he turned his head at nearly every step to see if he was pursued. So, running and looking back, he soon passed out of sight. When Joseph turned from watching him he   70SEPH WRESTLES WITH TEMPTATIOZA. 157 saw Rachel's carriage, now drawn up in front of him; he also saw her stern white face at the carriage window. Then he saw  her beckon to him, and with a guilty look he stepped toward the carriage. Rachel did not speak at first, but her look was more than words. Not until he reacelid the carriage did she speak, and then she said: "Get in!" Without a word, and  looking utterly con- founded, he opened the door, stepped in, and sat down beside her. "Drive home!" said Rachel to" the driver. And they drove away. All this Julia saw from her chamber window, and the servants saw it from below. "Why, that man looked like John!" said Julia to herself. And then she hurried to the boudoir. John was not there; nor was Joseph there. She pulled a bell-cord, and when a servant came she asked: "Where is my husband?" "He's gone out, lma'am." "Where?" "Do n't know, ma'am; but 't was very queer." "'What was queer?" "Why his walkin' out so - in his stockin' feet --walkin' on his toes--with his boots in 'is hand."    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6721-00000077"/> 158    THE MSIZAPS OF MR.?'L TER. "WWat do you mean?"

And why did John drive away with ler? Why did he  not speak to me about it? Why did he  steal away? That looks suspicious!" Such were Julia's first reflections. Then she sat down to collect her wits and search for some reasonable explanation. In doing tlis, slie searched her place for curiosities, and Mr. Pel- ter now appeared in her mental panorama. He seemed singularly associated with all of her perplexities. Was he really crazy? Was not this white-faced woman the one referred to by this strancge mlan in their street encounter? Mioght not she be the "other wife'" of whom he  spoke to Thomlas? She must have some strong hold   yOSEPH WRESTLES WITH TEMPTATION. 159 on John, to take lim  from her very arms al- most! Such were Julia's more deliberate reflections; and the more she thoulght, the more perplexities beset her. At last she started up, with a sudden resolution. "If John can not explain all this--and to my satisfaction-I will find this Pelter and examine him! But John can and will explain it! He is not a iman to prove unfaithful! Yet why did he  steal away? That is the strangest thing. She was determlined, whatever her suspicions, not to form an adverse judgment before John could have a hearing.  With this final resolu- tion, she engaged herself in her affairs. It was not very far to Joseph's house, and until they reached it neither he nor Rachel spoke. When they were in the house, Rachel turned on Joseph, and with a sneer inquired: "Can yon explain the business of this factory?" Joseph made no reply. "At lastl! said she, "I have caught you, where even your brazen face can not support you in denial!" "Rachel!" said Joseph, most dejectedly, "give me a little time to collect myself. I have been walking in the mists so long that I can not make things clear, even to myself--much less to you." 7    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6721-00000078"/> 160    the MSHAPS OF A1,. PELTER.

THE IMP OF DISCORD. AT the usual dinner-hour John came home. Julia met him as she always did, but there was inquiry in her eyes. "Where are your new clothes?" she asked. "What?" he answered. "Why did you not bring home your clothes?" "What clothes?" "Why, the ones you wore this morning!" "These are the ones I wore this morning." "No, they're not!" "What's in your head?" "Well, well; no matter now. Tell me where you went when you left me here." "Wly, I went down town as usual." "No, no! Not when you first went down; but after I had brought you home to lunch!" ' After you had brought me home to lunch!" repeated John, with much astonishment, and look- ing at his wife. "Yes.

"What sort of quizzing are you at?" asked John; now thinking that his wife was bent on some amusement.  Julia was impatient at what seemed John's attempt to avoid the subject, and she continued, with a serious lookl: ' Come, John! Tell me now. And tell me why you took off your boots and stole away while I was dressing." "Ha! -ha! ha!! h! ho! ho!" laughed John. "Go on! That's good! Took off my boots, and stole away while you were dressing!" Julia did not join in his amusement, but on the contrary grew more serious; and John soon noticed it. "Why, Julia, what's the matter with you? You are as incomprehensible as Pelter!" "Yes; and why was Mr. Pelter here? And what did he run away for?" John smiled and answered: "Has that crazy fellow been around again? By my faith! Un- less you blegin to speak more seriously, I shalll think that lunacy is infectious, and that Pelter's breath lhas charged the air. Come, now! be serious, and tell me what you re at!" "John!" said Julia, now  really angry, and flushing as she spoke, "don't treat me in this manner! You know yourself that, to say the least, your actions were very singular; especially your stealing off on tip-toe, and in your stock- ing-feet, with your boots in hand!"

"Why, wife," said John, not knowing what to think, '"you speak and  look as though you milght be in sober earnest! I am- in sober earnest, John!" said Julia, almost ready now to cry. "And-I think-you are-too bad!" "Stealing off on tip-toe - and in my stocking- feet!" repeated John, and his laughter tlhreat- ened to break out again, at the outre figure in his mind. "Why, my dear," said he, "how could I ever do a thing so perfectly ridiculous? And what object could I have in cutting such a figure?" "Do you deny it?" asked Julia, in great sur- prise. "Of course I do!  Who told you such a story?" "Well, I did not see you in that condition, but I did see you in other situations; and these you cannot deny." "What other situations? "Well, for one, with the woman in the car- riage at t]e door." "What woman? What carriage?" "You seem  determined to provoke me!

"And I did not ask you to take me to the theater to-night?" "I never heard of it before. I shall be very glad to take you there to-night, or any other night when you wish to go." "What makles you so provoking, John? You do not tell me-seriously, and to my face-      i that you deny these things?" "Most certainly I do! Your talk is all as obscure to me as the inscriptions on Egyptian monuments."   THE IMP OF DISCORD.       165 "That's all the explanation you intend to give me, is it;!" "It's all I have to give." "Then you intended to face me i ldown, and openly deny what transpired before my very eyes?" "There is soime mistake!  You did not sece me, Julia, as you say." Enough of this!' said Julia, with a look of di'llity. I find that I have been mistaken in your character." Then  turning on him, with a frown he  had never seen before, she added: "Be careful,   John, be very  careful!  I am  not a woman to be trifled with, and you will find it so!" John was so astonished by her tone and aLg,1'r, that he did not think of stopping her as slhe now swept proudly from  the room. "Well! upon   my  word!"  he soliloquized, ' This has a more serious look thanll I expected! What curious fancies Julia has! And how they seem to have fixed, them selves! They are like the phantasies of lunacy! And she cliltg's to thell like a madman to his vagaries! No sane mind could ever form an image so superlatively ridicu- lous as that of my stealing from my house on tip- toe, and in. my stocking feet, with my boots in hand!

My soul's delight! The object of my constant and increasing love! Can it be possible that some sudden and dis- , tressful blight has touched your mind, and that all your sparkling wit has turned to inane phan- tasies?" The very thought of such a thing distressed him so acutely that he could think of nothing but some soothing panacea.  He resolved to humor, rather than to contradict, her whims, un- til, from a more thorough observation, he could satisfy himself as to her real condition. With this determination, he went out after her. He found her sitting in another room, with her head bowed on a table, and sobbing convulsively.  The sight touched John as no other sight could touch him ; and he went up to her, and stooped down and kissed her hair.  "Come, Julia, my darling wife! Do not give way! Look up, and speak to me again! I 'll  admit it all! Come now!" "You admit it, do you?" cried Julia, quickly   i lifting up her head. "Now explain it to me!  "First, compose yourself," said John. Julia rose up in a blaze of jealous passion, and retorted: "You are a sailor, and have often seen the lashes of the wind goad on the swell- ing waves to fury! Did you ever try to calm EI           l-   THrE irP OF DISCORD.     167 them, when  they seemed' almost to reach the stars, by saying 4 compose yourselves'?" She was wrought up to actual frenzy, and John regarded her with a graver, sadder, and more compassionate expression. He did not know what to say to satisfy and calm her. "Did you, I say," she again broke forlh, "ever try to still the waves -or evenl ddretal that such a thing was possible-by saying calmly, ' compose yourselves?" ' "No," John answered. 'It would have seemed, like folly, would it not? "Yes."

I begin to think that my fears are too well founded, and that she is really going mad!" Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Julia in   derision. "That's the way you turn it now! Mad! Ita! ha! ha!" More convinced than ever by her wild, unna- tural look and laugh, and unable to control his 7*    <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6721-00000082"/> 168   THE MSHAPS OF MR.

Now I believe that he can not explain himself! I will find that Mr. Pelter!" If Julia had really been demented, she could not have been more entirely possessed by the fancies of her mind than  she appeared to be when John next saw her; and John could not have looked more sorrowful and broken had ihe seen the actual wreck of what was dearer to hinm than his life. He resolved to consult solme eminent authority, and see if something could not be done to restore her faculties. So the evening and tihe anxious, sleepless night passed by. On the 'following morning the situ- ation. was unchanged, and John .even hastened from the house, so great was his anxiety for a  consultation.                 ' Julia was glad to see him go so soon, for she was anxious to comimence her search for yMr. Pelter. She ordered the carriage, and at once commenced to dress. When she was ready, the carriage wa-s waiting at the door. She went oul:, and as she took her seat, said to the coachman: "Thomas, I must find that queer man Pelter --the man you caught in    the barrel-trap. I don't know who he is, or where he is, and wish ,t   THE I1M7P OF DISCORD.       169 yoll to make somei inquiries. If you see him on the street as you   dri\ve alollg, let me knlow. His name is Pelter."' With this they started off. They did not see Ezelkiel on the street, but when they commenced to take their inquiries at different business places, they found that Mr. Pelter was not unknown. Some of the places where they inquired had been deluged with his tracts and charity aplpeals, and he seemed to have been entirely impartial in his visits to them   all; consistency, in this respect, was one of Ezekiel's virtues, and no one could complain of his neglect.   Several of those who knew   the man did not know   his place of resi- dence or where he could be foulnd; but finally, one   suggested  the  Ladies' Missionary  Board, With this to guide her in her inquiries, she soon found  out where Mr. Pelter   lived. She drove to his house, and   went herself to ring  the bell and  make  her inquiries. Mrs. Pelter soon   appeared, in  answer to the bell, and Julia asked: "Is Mr. Pelter in?" Here was a woman made of different clay, and formed   in a different mould, from that which formed   and  fashioned  those  who  usually pro- pounded   this familiar question, mad  Mrs. Pelter was really pleased  with her appearance; thought she  wondered all the time what she  could want of "Pelter."    <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6721-00000083"/> 170   THE MSHAPS OF /MR. PEL;LEA'. "He is out at present," answered Mrs. Pelter. "I am   very sorry,"  Julia answered. "Can you tell me where I would   be most likely to find him?"  "Clinging to some woman's petticoat!"   said Mrs. Pelter, spitefully. Julia smiled. And Mrs. Pelter, seeing it, came as near a smile as she ever d(id; and, in fact, as near as it was possible to come with such a face as hers. "What plarticular petticoat shall I try to find?" asked Julia, with a lbroader smile. "Well,': said Mrs. Pelter, chuckling at her first conceit, " you'd better go to the brooding-place; you'll probably find them  tall upon some new egg of mischief."  "Where is that?"' inquired Julia, now exceed-     , ingly amused. "At what they call the Ladies' Rooms," said Mrs. Pelter; and she gave the street and num- ber. Now, for the first time, Julia thought of what     i John had told her of his visit there, and how? she might have saved the trouble of her inquiries if she had thought of it before. ' Is Mr. Pelter wrong in any way up here?" asked Julia, tapping her forehead with her finger. "1 What? daft?  4"Yes."   7TIE IMP OF DISCO'RD.      171 "Why, bless you! No!    But I do not won- der that you ask the question; for he is suiely a very different mnan from. what he  clainms to be."' Thanking Mrs. Pelter for her informaltion, and leaving a smile behild to warm  the spot where Mrs. Pelter's heart lad been, Julia returned to her carriage, and drove away to filnd the ladies' rooms. When   she reached  the '; rooms,"  she sent Thomas in to inquire for Mr. Pelter. At that very moment the Board was actively engaged in assaults on Julia's cllaracter. Ezekiel had just reported to them his observations whle with- Rachel on the day lbefore. By his spirited remarks he  conveyed   an  impression - incoln- sciously, lperhaps, but he conveyed it -of his un- usual dignity and courage on that occasion. He did not even  mention-so engraged   was he  in more important matters -his flying heels in the sight of Joseph Smith. "Mr. P-e-l-t-e-e-r is inquired for," said a memn- ber, returningl from the door where Thomlas wa-s. "Who is it?" asked 1Mr. Pelter. ' He is a coachman--by hs dress," the mem- ber answered. Mr. Pelter excused hmself, and going to the door, found  Thomnas there. He stopped in tlhe open door, ald did not recoonize the coachman. "Is your name Pelter?" Thomas asked.    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6721-00000084"/> 172    THZE MrISI4APS OF MR. PEL TE'R. "It is,' said Mr. Pelter; frowning on this familiarity, and swelling sensibly. "You look sprucer than you did when wre took you from the barrel," continued Thomas, with a merry twinllle in his eye. Hush!" said Ezelsiel, with his finger up, and then he stepp]ed out aid carefully closed the doori. "What is it, my good man?   he now in- quired ; and, as he spoke, he beamed upon the coachman graciously. "My mistress wants you." ' Where is she?' "In her carriage." "Here?" "Yes, sir."  Now, it had been the great desire of Ezekiel's secret heart, ever since lhe saw her first, to make tlhe acquaintance of the " handsome   voo-man"; and he  would in truth much sooner cultivate that blooming garden than the finest moral gar- den in the world. But these were his secret - thoughts, and he was by far too prudent to dis-  close them to the Board. "Tell her that I will be out immediately,"       ; said he; and he returned. "Who is it?" asked the members, when he re-appeared. "The very one we're talking of," said Mr. Pelter.   THE IMP OF DISCOo/D.      1 7 3 "Goodness!" exclaimed the members, ini sur- prise. "What does shle want?" "She sent in for me," Ezekiel answered; "she's in her carriacge at the door.'" Then he  added, artfully,- well knowing that he would be urged to go: "Is it proper?" She can 't hurt you,"  said one. "It is your duty," said a second. And all, without exception, urged him to go; for they were not disposed, on mere punctilio, to be cheated of a fresh sensation. "The call of duty," said  Ezekiel, bowing to the second member,   always finds its answer here," and he put his hand upon his waistcoalt; but really nearer his stomach than his heart - and quite properly.  Then he took his broad- brimmed hat and started out. As he approached the carriacge where Julia sat, he lifted off his hat, and let his blandness shine with more than usual splendor. Julia smiled, and guleeted  him, and thanked him for his coming. "Will you get in and ride with me?" said she. ' I want to talk  with you. I will bring you back again." Notling could have been proposed more fLgree- able to Mr. Pelter, and he showed    it in his shining face.

"What a world we live in, Mr. Pelter," Julia commenced, as they turned and drove away. "It is a dying world," said Mr. Pelter, solemn- ly, and sighing as he spoke. "Whalt a wicked world it is!" said Julia. ' Oh what a wicked world!" responded Mr. Pelter. "I hope that you did not suffer much fi'om your rough  treatment on our grounds on that dark night;"' and Julia smiled in spite of all attelmpts at gravity, as she remembered his .ap- pearance then. "I suffered, madam," replied Ezekiel; "but we were made to suffer." "How comforting your religion is." And Julia turned away her head to conceal another smile. "Oh, it is such a comfort! And, madam, I would braave a hundred such dark nights as that to be of service to you." Here he turned on her his captivating look, and Julia sliled and answered by a word of thanks. "I want to ask you about that night," con- tinued she. "Tell me why you went there; tell me frankly, Mr. Pelter." With that fearless look, so natural to him when   THE TIMP OF DISCORD.     175 he felt secure from danger, he replied; 'I went to save you from a godless libertine!" Julia had not looked, or prepared herself, for such a blast as this, and she was. greatly scan- dalized by a charge so shockiing. "Are you speaking 'of my husband?" she re- plied, in a tone of dignified resentment; and in spite of all her own anathemas, her woman's nature would defend the man in whoml she trust- ed once. "Are you- really - married to him?" asked Mr. Pelter, in a tone of great astonishment. ' Do you ask me? Did you not see that we were living there?" Mr. Pelter saw by her flashing eyes that his awikward feet were treading oin torpedoes, and he clumsily attempted to extricate himself. "Yes," he answered, "I satw that!" "Then why did you ask me if we were married?" "Because I did not think that he would dare to go so far." "Did you think that he would live with me and not be married to me?" "He might do that!" "What, then, do you think of me? Am I a wanton? How dcare you, sir--" Oh no! no! no! I beg ten thousand par- dons! I did not think of you!

She noticedl this, and quickly settled back to her previouls position. The coachman, muttering something to himself, turned back to lis position. When Julia spoke again it was almost in a whisper; a namieless and shapeless, but giant and oppressive horior, was coming over her. "Speak low!" said she, "' and tell me what  you mean!" "I mean," said  Mr. Pelter, speaking  low, "that he las another wife!- It was a hard and  cruel blow, and it fell with crushing weight.

He was about to liave the coachman stop, when Julia, seeing his intention, put her hand  upon his arm  and shook  her head. Then, by an almost superhuman   effoirt, she threw off the lethargic spell, and leaning over to Ezekiel, whispered: "Was it the  white-faced woman in the car- riage, who came for him on yesterday; and who was at the  door when I saw   you running off?"

' Will you let me know when it is arranged?" Yes." "'Then let me take you back.   I must get home! This blow is killing me!" 'Oh, ma'am -'" commenced    Ezekiel; and then he stopped; for he saw that she did not heed, or even seem to hear him.  Slhe aroused herself an instant, and told the coachlnan to take Mr. Pelter back, and then drive home. After this, she sank back again, and closed lelr eyes, and did not move or speak until the car- riage stopped for Mr. Pelter to get out. Then she sat up, and witlh her lhand ol Mr. Pelter's arm, and her face near his, she said impressively  "Remember! you must let me know!" "I will," said Mr. Pelter.

When Julia reached her home she found her husband there, and a stranger whoni she had never seen before. John was so shocked by her appearance when she entered that he  could not control his nmas- tering emotions; and he Droke down with sobs, and hurried to a private room to regain com- posure. The stranger, with a look of tenderness and pity, stepped up to Julia, and said to her, "Let me assist you to your room." She could not refuse his proffered help, for she was too weak to reach her room  unaideld. Hanging on the stranger's arm, and looking in his kind and sympathizing face, she asked: "Are you John's friend?" "Yes, and yours," he answered. "I -am glad of that," said she; "for it seems a very heavy blow to him." "It is, indeed," the stranger answered. "His sobs," said Julia, "fell like heavy ham- mers on my heart.

A sharp, quick glance was instantly excllanged between the hu:;band and the stranger, as they heard the question. Which one was first I alsk?" repeated Julia. "Do n't you understand mee?" "No," said John. "What do you mea'n?" "Wlich one did you marry first?" Another look was here exchlanged between the husband and the stranger. "Was she the first?" persisted Julia. "Yes, yes," said John, not knowing what to say. 'It is better so than the other way," con- tinued Julia. "How?" asked John. "Why, I would rather be the one who holds your heart - and I believe I do - even if our marriage was unlawful, than to be the deserted wife!" A moment's silence intervened, and then she spoke again: "But, John, it was a very wicked thing to    <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6721-00000089"/> 182   THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. do! I tlink- I know indeed-that you did not dream that it would cost your Julia's life; but -it will!" Another painful silence passed, and she again continued: "I can never show my face again.! It is such a shame! It will be very hard. for me to give you up: but I must do it. You belong to her!" Here the stranger interrupted, saying, "You will feel better for a little rest. I am a phy- sician; let me give you something. When you have had a little sleep we can talk of all these things." "It is a healer of the soul I need," responded Julia. "This physical machinery is of very little value to me now; and I do not care how soon the wheels run down-and--stop!" While she was speaking, the doctor took some medicine from a little pocket-case, and as soon as she had finished he offered it to her. "Take it!" said he ; "you will feel better for it." "rTo please you I will take it, for you are kind; but for myself, I do not care." She took the -medicine. The effect was very soon apparent. Her breathing was more natural and her system  generally more relaxed. Soon her eyes grew dull and heavy; and then they closed; and then her soft, low breath gave no- tice of her slumber.   THE IMP OF DISCORD.      t83 The stranger was an eminent physician, and one who gave particular, attention to treatments of the " mind diseased." Jolhn had been with him since he first found himl in the morninog. He repeated to the doctor his strange interview with Julia. "That fancy of my walking in my stockinig- feet, and stealing from her, seems to trouble her the most of anything," said John. "But yet she is just as earnest and as positive in the declaration that I went home to lunch with ler, and lwas carrietd off from there by somle white-faced woman." "Is there not some foundation for these fall- cies?" asked the doctor. "Not the least!" said John, most positively. "So far was she from  taking me to lunch as this; I did not even see her during the entire day! And I certainly did not go off witl any wo- man- white-faced or black, or of any other color. As to my walking on my toes in my stocking- feet, and stealing from the house in such a way, it is too ridiculous to be reconciled with sanity." "Well, I will go with you, and see ler," said the doctor. "What do you think from what I've said to you?" asked John, with manifest anxiety. "You nmay be right," the doctor answered. "I am inclined to think you are.  But do lnot be cast down; it may be -and, indeed, is likely to    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6721-00000090"/> 184   TIE AISHAPS OF MR.

The servants did not know where she had gone, and they sat down to wait for her return.  When she did return, they did not see her until she entered. As soon as Julia was asleep, ,the doctor sug- gested that they retire to another room, and ascertain, if possible, Where she had been, and how employed while she was out. "It may lead us," the doctor said, " to something more deter- rinate." They retired to another room, and John stepped out and sent for- Thomas, who very soon ap- peared. This gentleman," said John to him, "will state some qu estions to you; I wish you to answer them carefully and frankly." Thomas bowed and gave his attention to the doctor. "Where have you been this morning, and how has your mistress been engaged?" the doctor asked. "We have been hunting for a queer old chap by the name of Pelter," Thomas answered, "and when we found him she had a talk with him." "What did they talk about?"   7ITE 7P OF DISCOR'D.      185 G I did not hear; but once or twice my mis- tress was very, much excited; andC she seemed, somehow, broke  down when Pelter left us. Then I drove home." "Is thalt all? "That's all, sir." "You may go," said John, and Tholmas at once retired. "Who is this Pelter? Do you know him?  asked the doctor, turning to John. Well," said John, o I ie is a crazy fellow, or a very fooliah one; and  i did not tlilk to state before that 1he seems to be, somehow, mixed up in the confusion of her mind. She asked me wlhy he ran away when the woman took me off." Here John told all he  knew of Mr. Pelter, and closed by saying: "He seenms to be so fixed in her curious falllies, thhat it is not strange, perhaps, that she should try to find him. In a sound and healthy state of mind, she could have no earthly object in seeing him." "You see," remarked the doctor, " by what she said just now, that she has other fancies than those you stated; and that the one now prominent with her is that you have another wife, whom you have deserted." "Yes," said John, "and that was one of Pel- ter's crazy notions."  "Then," said the doctor, "he may have con- 8    <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6721-00000091"/> ] 86   THE1 I MSHAPS OF MR.

"If I find him hanging around my house again I will order his arrest!" "I am not satisfied upon the question of your wife's condition," said the doctor, ' and must talk with her. We can do no more at present. She will sleep for several hours, perhaps, and when she awakens she may be more clear,: or- she may not. " "What do you mean when you say that she may not '?" "Well, it is possible that this excitement and anxiety mlay terminate in some serious affection of the thrain, of which her present state is the inception; if so, it is quite likely that all these fancies are really the imlagees produced by physi- cal disease, as I said before, and that they will vanish, and be remembered only as a dream- dlll a shIadowy one at that-- when she recovers. Now I must go. You can send for me when her sleep is over." With this, the doctor went- away, and left the frightened and  bewildered John with the specters of his fears. Julia's sleep was not so long' or so profound as the doctor thought  it would be; and when John returned to her, he found her restless and turning on her couch, and muttering incoherent   THE IMP OF DISCORD.       187 words.  The fever had  begun, and her heated blood was swelling all her veins by its rapid and unnatural flows. Her face and hands were hot and dry; and when she started from her sleep, and John offered her sone water, she clltched the glass with trembling  fingers and drAined it eagerly. Then she settled )back, with a long- drawn breath, and fixed her eyes on John. But he could see that her look    was vacant; and when he  spoke to her, and she commenced to speak again, he saw that her mind was wandering The doctor had scarcely reached his office wlhen he was called, and hurried back again. "This is what I said :might happen," said lhe to John, after seeing Julia. "But is there danger?" inquired John, in a frightened tone. "No   immediate danger," replied the doctor, "and perhaps no real danger; for she will have every care.  In all such cases, there is much in proper care.  In her intervals of consciousness- if she has them, and probably she will not- try to tranquilize her mind, and  never try to settle vexing  questions.  Nature is the great physician now, and much depends on constant watchfulness and  careful nursing." The doctor then   wrote out prescriptions, and gave all necessary orders, and  went away again. John nerved himself for the coming fight with death.    <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6721-00000092"/> CHAPTER   IX. MRt. PELTER AS A STAR. AFFAIRS at Joseph's house were in a sad con- dition. Confidence was entirely destroyed be- tween himself and Rachel.   Each felt guilty of a guiltless indiscretion; and each felt prop- erly indignant that the indiscretion was so mag- nified. Neither could charge the other without receiving a counter-charge, and each believed the other to be more guilty than a knowledge of the actual facts would justify. Joseph tried to introduce the subject and come to mutual explanations; but Rachel would not be satisfied with this, and required from him, first, the confession of a crime which existed only in her jealous fanLcy. You do not execise that charity which, as a Christian woman, you should exercise," said Joseph. '"Nor do you practice those Christian virtues which you should practice!" retorted Rachel. "Your religion, tlen, is not a help in time of need," continued Joseph. 188   "It is too much like yours!"   again retorted Rachel,--  confined to preaching more than prac- tice." 'Tius, their anger stripped the maisks from off their faces, and left no common ground to stalld( upon.  Sullenly, angrily, and defiantly, they took theli separate courses. Joseph, after this, was much absent from   his home.  Rachel, believing that she knew   where he was, was more and more possessed by jeal- ousy and hate. If I can catch them  in a public place, I 'll expose them  to the world," said she. Joseph's evenings now were nearly always spent away froln home, and he established new asso- ciations, to fill his leisure hours. This unlfortu- nate estrangemenet drove Rachel more and mor'e to the "' Ladies' Rooms." the Board received her as a victim; and  they never tired  of in- creasing her uneasines s by artful innuendoes. Mr. Pelter was constantly upon the watch to hit upon some time and place when he  wuld be certain of finding Joseph and his wife to- gether,. that he might communicate the fact to Julia; but the unfortunate estrangement defeated all his plans.  Affairs remained in this condition until Julia  had passed the crisis of her malady, and had convalesced, and finally recovered.  The attack -    <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6721-00000093"/> 190   THE MISIZAPS OF MR. PEL TER. had been as severe and dangerous, as it was sud- den and unexpected.  For many hours, at its turning-point, she was shadowed by the hover- ing wings of death. But she rallied--feebly first, and then with greater strength-until, with con- scious smiles, she chased the shadows from the room. John, worn by watching and anxiety, was the oDject of her first wondering gaze. Her low voice struck him like an electric shock, as slie inquired, "How is this?" ' O! my DARLING!" was all that he could say; and he bowed his head upon the bed, while great sobs choked him.  She put her wasted hand upon his head, and by that simple touch filled him with her tenderness. "Have I been so ill?"? she asked. Now John looked up, and a great beatitude was shining through his tears. "Why, John, you look worn out!" said she. ' Have I been here long?" O Ohl! so long! An eternity! if duration can be counted by our throbs of anguish." "How you love me, John."   And here she took his hand and smiled. "I never knew how much till now!" "I am  trying to remember ; it is like a hideous nightmare; I can't make it out." "Do n't try to make it out!" cried John, with eagerness.   AMR. PELTER AS A STAR.       191 m'I must try, John.  My mind   will workt in spiite of me; and it is better to settle its per- plexities than to leave it in a muddle.   Some well-intentioned people have strang'e notions .as to the proper treatmtent of a curious lmind. In mistaken kindness, they refuse to answer clles- tions, and drive it back upon itself, to fret andl worry, until, il new  perplexities, it finds itself distiracted. Do n't treatt me tills wavy. Has ly brain been touched?  Have I been wandevring?" ' Yes," said John, converted 'to her notion of a proper treatment. that explains it then!" saild she, with a sigh of visible relief. "I have had some curious fan- cies, Jolhn. I saw that crazy Pelter; and. I saw a 'white-faced woman take you  off from me. Even now these forms are so distinct as to seem realities. They are fancies, are they not? I did not really see them, did I?   And yet I could almost swear to their existence!" "They  are all delusions!  answered  John. ' Depelnd upon it!  I am not; deceiving' you!' Nor did he think he was. Well then," said Julia, " let us banish them!" With this, she marshaled  all ler fancies in a ghostly line, then linked them to what she now believed to be the image  of the white-faced woman, and drove theml from her brain.   With this came rest. With rest came strength. With    <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6721-00000094"/> 192    THE 11rSrTIPS OF M'R. PELTE/R. strength came thankfulness and joy.   S'unshille filled the house again; and Julia's csong s and laughter startled all the specteris from their clran- nies. John was determined  to protect his  wife against a recurrence of distressful scenes. He gave to Thomas most particular and positive in- structions. "If," said he, "that fellow Pelter comes about the house ag'ain, you must arrest him, and  hand him over to the authorities. I will bear you out in it, and   will appear and make  the proper charges.  Julia's life is too precious to me to be again endangered. 'He shall not escape if I catch him    here again, said Thomas. Rachel was urged, from  time to time, by the Ladies' Board, to commence proceedings against her husband, by a criminal complaint; but she could not be induced to go so far as that. She was always on the watch to secure proofs of Joseph's guilt; but she could not lend  herself to a prosecution, wlich would, she thought, re- sult in his imprisonment for a term  of years. Mr. Pelter, after being baffled 'for a score of times in his efforts to determine when he  would be certain of finding Joseph at home with Ra- chel, at last resolved upon a more direct attempt. When he next met Rachel at the "rooms," he asked: "When is your husband home?"   IMR. PEELTEALr  AJS A STAR.    1 )3 "Usually at dinner," answered Rachel. "All other times are most uncertain now." When he heard this answer, he  accused him- self of great stupidity for not thinking of that himself. He knew   that the windows of the dining-room opened toward the street, and near enough to enable a passer-by - especially if sit- ting in a carriage-to see distinctly objects in the room. He could not hit upon a better plan than was at once suggested. "We can catch   them  at the dinner-table!" he reflected, " and without the  danger of dis- covery, by simply driving  past. But he can't be there every day to dinner ;' for some days he must be with the other voo-man!" "He is not there every day to dinner, is he ?" he continued, speaking audibly- "No; he is often absent'," Rachel answered. "She 'll' -know,' reflected Mr. Pelter, " when he is absent, for he'll be with her!" Some little time had passed since Julia called on him, and  he was impatient to see and talk with her again.  He had no knowledge of her sickness, or of the sad effects of his previous disclosures; and before he had  settled on his present plan for finding' Joseph and his wife to- gether, she was well again.   A  few days after he had settled on this plan, he set out for Julia's house, to advise her of it. 8*     <pb n="194-195 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6721-00000095"/> 194   THE I MSSHAPS OF MR. PELT ER. he was dressed witl. unusual care, and was determined on malking ta most favorable impres- sion. When he was near the house he stooped to dust his feet, and his shining face was re- flected in his polished boots. He concluded not to ring the bell, for he might thus attract atten- tion and curiosity, and he walked past the house, wiftl hs eyes upon the windows. He hoped to see Julia there, but did not, and so he turned and walked back again. Back and forth he walked again, and then again, looking at the windows, until the servants noticed him. Julia was not at homle, and the servants, think- ing that such conduct had a suspicious look, hur- ried to the stable, and reported to the coachman. They described the man, and( Thomas in an in- stant, thought of the 'crazy Pelter," and of John's instructions with regard to him. "Let me see," said he, and he stooped and craned his neck, and carefully looked out from the stable door-his boody not exposed.   The girls, on tip-toe, looked above his head, ready, at an instant's warning to dodge out of sight. Mr. Pelter, in his repeted walks, not seeing Julia, resorted to anotler means of attracting her attention. -He took out his large and spotless handkerchief, and put it to his nose, and then with all his might blew such a blast as nearly shook the windows in their frames.

"That's him! that's him!" the girls criel out, and then retreated fromn the door. "Yes," said Thomas, also dodging back, "that's the fellow- sure " "Who?" asked the girls, excited. "Why, the thief we caught here -in the bar- rel," answered Thomas, chuckling, as he noticed their look of fear. "Mercy!" cried the girls, in real alarm, "he 's taking' observations for another visit! Prolbably he knows that mistress is away, and thinks you gone as well." "For all his dress, he has a villain's look " said onle "Yes," the other said, "and a savage villaii'sl look." And their imaginations made him quite a furious monster, when, in fact, he would hiaver run in terror from either one of them. "Stand back,! stand back!" said Thomas, "I must manage to get him in here somehow." "In here! To cut our throats? Wait, Tom  Wait! Let us get out!" exclaimed the girls ; and then they ran until. they reached the house, and shut and locked the door. Thomas now walked out, as tlough unconscious    <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6721-00000097"/> 193   THE tSISHAPS OU AR. PELTER.  of Mr. Pelter's presence. By this time Ezelkiel had made his usual turn, and walked Lack again. i'holm  was near the fence when he came back. Mr. Pelter saw hm, and, in his loftiest and most patronizing tone, he said :  "All! how are you?" "How are you?" Trhomas answered. Thanks to a gracious Providence, I aim well --very well," said Mr. Pelter. "Will you walk in and see the grounds?" asked Thomas, pleasantly; for he  feared that Mr. Pelter might escape if he tlried to catch him on the street. "Ahem!" said Mr. Pelter, pleased with the  sulggestion, and thillking that he would be cer- tain now of Julia's notice. "Thank you, I will step in a moment." Thomas held the gate for him, and he stepped in and began to addire a bed of flowers near. "Do you ever think, my man," said he, with unction, "of the Giver of these bright flowers?" "They was n't give to us; my mistress bought 'em at the green-house." Ezekiel groaned. "Come and see the stable," continued Thomas. ' Here! read this!" said Mr. Pelter, holding' out what, he had just taken from his pocket. "What's that?" asked Thomas, looking at it. Ezekiel put his finger on the head-lines of his   A/MR. PELTER .A S A STAR.    193) favorite tract, and read out the words, in his lofty and impressive tone: "'ebmare of t)e Zratfj to Growme." 'All right," said Thomas, and he again in- vited Mr. Pelter to the stable. "If I could only call you to the manger!" Ezekiel fervently exclaimed. "'They're all out of date!"   said  Tlihornv, "We feed from  racks and boxes now! Come! I'll show you." "' Too true!  Too true!" said    Ezekiel sol- emnly. "What's too true?" "That the manger is all out of date'   ! O! what a world!" "As crazy as a loon!" said Thomas to him- self. By this time they had reached the stable, and Thomnuas stood taside for Ezekliel to enter.  As soon as Thomas entered, he looked about and found a stout but slender piece of rope; then approachng Mr. Pelter from  behind, he caught his arms and drew them back, and in a twinkle tied them. "Now," said he, "  I've got you!" Mr. Pelter was so overcome thy fear, at first, that he was speechless; and Thomas, taking ad- vantage of his condition, quickly placed him in    <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6721-00000098"/> 200    TI/BE MSHZAPS OF IM.

I would not tie you, but I must fix you sure, so I can leave you while I get ready to take you off." Mr. Pelter thought of abduction, torture, assas- sination, and a hundred other frightful tilings; for Joseph's threats to Mrs. Pelter were running in his mind. Trembling from head to foot, and stammering in his speech, he asked: Wh -   h -- where?  "To the police station," Thomas answered. Ezekiel's courage mounted now, and he  no longer trembled, for the thought of danger to his person was removed.  The idea of a brief confinement for the sake of righteousness was rather pleasing than displeasing to his mind. He had twanged so long upon a single string, that the familiar sound was irksome even to himself. this arrest, if properly manipulated, would fur- nish him  another string, and he would strike such wailing sounds from it as to reach hearts insensille to his ustual appeals. In imaoination, he could already see the indig- nant members of the Board hurling thunderbolts against his prison-walls; and even Mrs. Pelter   MR. PELTER A S A STAR.      201 must be touched to some compassion by his dis- tress. Rachel, and I My-rindy," and the "hand- some woo-man," would all regalrd himl  with ta hio(her veneration than before, when they saw him suffering in their cause. And what an end- less theme for tracts!  He would  write, and throw them from between his prison bars, as thick and fast as snowflakes come in a winter storm! He luxuriated in these thoughts; and now he only feared that he  might be discharged, and not confined at all. Thomas, when he had " fixed him, sure," went in to notify the servants in the house, and offer them a chance to look upon his prisoner. "Are you sure," they asked, " that you lhave him safe?? 6 As safe as a thief in stocks!" said he. With this assurance, they ventured  to the stable, following in the coachm;an s wakle. With hesitating steps, when they reached the  door, they entered. Mr. Pelter's clothing was disarranged some- what, by the trussing Thomas gave him.  His breeches-legs were drawn up above his boot-tops, and his hat, by contact with the post, was knocked upon one side. This gave him a rakish look, which detracted much from the im pressive- ness of what he very gravely uttered. He looked,  in truth, more like a drunken man, attempting    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6721-00000099"/> 202   TIE AIISHAPS OF MR.

His appearance, in- stead of appealing to the compassion of the servants, amused them greatly, and they nudged each other and tittered, and thenh laughed out- right, Thomas joining them. "Did your master order this assault upon my liberties?" inquired Mr. Pelter, il a crushing tone. "It's strictly 'cordin' to instructions," ans- wered Thomas, with a smile. You're a child of sin!" said Mr. Pelter, as he noticed Thomas' smile, "with no bowels of compassion " In his earnestness he threw back his head, and hit his hat again against the post, knocking' it to a new position, more rakish than before. At this the servants' laughed again, Land Thomlas joined them. One eye now was nea;:ly covered by his hat, and with that half open, and the other fairly blazing with llis indignation, he gave the such a look as he thought would crush them, but it only served to increase their irreverelt merriment. Thomas now retired to make some changes in his dress, and the servants scampered to the house again. "Now, old chap," said Thomas, on his return, "if you'll be quiet, and not try to get away, I 'll take all your fastenings off."   MR. PELTER AS A STAR.      203 'I will go with you," the good man answered, and this was all that he would say. On this parole Thomas untied him from   tlhe post and freed his hands. "Come on!"   said Thomnas, and they started off. Ezekiel was silent, but there was a diglli- fied serenity upon his face. When they reached the station-house Thomas gave -him up to the authorities. "What is the complaint?" asked the officer. "General cussedness! Thomlas anwered. But why did you arrest him?i 'Actin' under orders." Whose orders?" My master's; I will go and brilng him." Without waiting  for another word, Thomnas went, out to report to John. "What is the name of the man who ordered your arrest?" asked the officer of Mr. Pelter. "Joseph Smith," replied Ezekiel, and the name of Joseph Smith was duly written in the records. What is your name?" With a pardonable degree of pride, and some pomposity, Ezekiel replied: "Pelter, sir-Ezekiel Pelter-of the Missionary Board!" His name was also' written in the records; and Ezekiel was asotonished to observe that neither his name nor that of the Missionary Board, seemed to make the least impression on the officer.    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6721-00000100"/> 204   THE MS/IAPS OF MR. PELTER. Taking down a bunch of keys hanging near his desk, the officer rose, and said to Mr. Pel- ter: "Come this way." Mr. Pelter followed him, and was transferred to less cheerful quarters, where, for the prlesent, he was left without confinement in a cell. The officer retired, and locked the door behind him. Hold there "' cried Mr. Pelter, from a grated openilng in the door. The officer stopped and  turned around, and Mr. Pelter said: "I must advise my friends of my situation. Will you give me pen, and ink, and paper?' The officer nodded and walked on. He soon returned with pen, and ink, and paper, and handed them  to Mra. Pelter through the grated opening in the door.  Until now Ezekiel had not looked about him.  There were other pris- oners in the open room  or hall-way where he was left; and in nearly  all of the diamond openings in the doors of cells around he saw curious and sometimes vicious faces. Those in the hall-way with him soon came up and ques- tioned him, with jeers, and grimaces, and bois- terous laughter. Their faces and their language were so repulsive and terribly profane, and Eze- kiel was so shocked by the association, that he drew away and sat down by a small rough tabl,l and commenced his letters to his friends. The   MR. PELTER AS A SY7AR,      205 otlers left him for a time, and only among them- selves made comments on his looks. One letter was to the ladies of the Board, alld another to Mrs. Pelter. The one to the  ladies of the Board is yet preserved, and curious readers are referred to it as a matchless specimen of Mr. Pelter's masterly descriptions. It was read by the Austere lMem- ber; and the awful stillness of the 1room  was only broken by the moans of Miranda Trap and the sobs of the other members,   Ezekiel was compared to the Apostle Paul in his imprison- ment; and the comparison   was most decidedly in favor of the Christian soldier of the Board. It is undoubtedly the fact that in luxuriant im- agery and sublime self-centering the apostle was eclipsed. Mrs. Pelter read her letter with far different feelings. "It serves him  right," said she; "thougll I must try and get him   out. Perhaps this will teach him to let other people regulate their own affairs!" In due time Thomas returned, accompanied by John. "Is this Mr. Smith?" inquired the officer. "It is," John answered. "What is the charge against this man Pel- ter?"    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6721-00000101"/> 206   TirE LMS/HAPS OF AlR. PELTER. "I hardly know  whaIt the technical offense would be, but I will state the facts." John then proceeded to relate how Mr. Pelter had been caught in his grounds at night, prying about the house; and how, as Thomas hid in- formed him, he was taking   other observations when alrrested. "The fellow is a thief, no doubt," the officer remarked. "He has a very pious way of talking," inter- rupted Thomas. "Oh, that's a favorite dodge with some," re- plied the officer, with a knowing smile. ' The devil's 'livery of heaven' is among his favorite costumes;  he dresses preachers in it some- times." "When will it be necessary for me to come and testify?" inquired John. "Well," said the officer, " he will first receive a preliminary examination before a justice; tlihe he will be bound over for' his trial. Your man, here, knows all the facts, ^and for the purlpose of the examination his testimony will be suffi- cient. We will not really need you until the trial in the higher court; of that we will sendl you notice.  Let your man be here to-morrow, and testify at the examination." With these instructions John and Thomas went away.   MR. PELT ER AS A STAR.      207 Then the officer took down his bunchl of keys, nfld went in to Mr. Pelt;er. Here, my man," said he, with his hand on Ezekiel's shoulder, "yolu belong' in   separate quarters." Saying this, he  took Ezekiel to an enpty cell, and opened it, and shut Ezekiel in. The dark and unclelan iplace did not corresDond at all withl Mr. Pelter's previous notions; and the idea of a confilnement here was much less attractive thanlt before. The -Board made inquiries, and ascertained tlhat he would  be examined on  the following m11orn- ing. they resolved to support him by their presence and encouragemlent. They were 1present at the opelning of the court oni the following day, but the Dlace was not attractive, and tlhey were shocked to see their respected member in tlhe crowded dock, surrounded by the moral offi I of the city. MWhen Mr. Pelter saw tlem, his heavy heart plucked courage  from their presence, and e10 looked upon the court with much complacelncy, from a moral pinnacle. His wife was mucl   more practical tlhan tl1(e members of the Board, in   what she did.  As soon as she was notified of his confinement, she went for legal counsel. She was adyiised, among' other thilngs, that her husband could be released    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6721-00000102"/> 208   THE Af SHAPS OF MR. PELTER. on bail, even if he should be held for trial. She took this information to Ezekiel at the station- house, and sent the lawyer to consult, with him. So, when the case was called, he had counsel for his defense. But the story of -the coachman was so simple and direct, and so free frolm ambiguity and con- tradiction, that the court could not do otherwise than hold Ezekiel for trial. He was so lleld, and his bail was fixed at a reasonable amount. He was now  transferred from the station-house to the city prison. The story of the coachman, when he gave his testimony as to Mr. Pelter's conduct when he was trapped on that unlucky night, was so enl tirely different from the impression made by Mr. Pelter in his account of it, that the members of the Board were unanimous in the opinion that the prosecution was supported by false testimony; and this increased their indignation. "Joseph Smith," said they, "is trying to de- stroy the character of Mr. Pelter, and .fix a crime  upon him, that he may be secure from   Mr. Pel- ter's charges!" This was a sufficient motive, in the opinion of the Board, to induce the guilty man to resort to perjury in the present case; and tley now urged Rachel more strongly than before to take some active measures in opposition to her husband.   MR. PELTER 'AS A4 STAR4/.     209 "Next he   will commence   upon  yourself " said they, "and  try to hide your knowledge behind prison walls." "If he slould  ever even  think  of such a thing," said Rachel, in a burst of passion,- "I will prosecute to the bitter end! But he  dare not think of such a thing. I intend to speak to him of Mr. Pelter's matter, for I will not have him prosecute that man for acting in my service! This resolution was applauded withl enthusiasm, and Rachel was so aroused that she determined to go in person to the city prison, and   assure the persecuted man of her active sympalty, and her intentions as to  his release. The Austere Member volunteered to go with her. As Mr. Pelter was being conducted from    the court-room, he  saw  his wife.  In a quiet and unostentatious wray, she approached him, and, with other words of comfort, said that she would take immedliate measures to secure bail, and that his confinement would be brief. This, coming as it did from  one so energetic as his wife, was all that Mr. Pelter needed  to assure content. Now he  was himself again- dignified and bland. To have seen  him  walking with the sheriff to the city prison, a stranger would have thought that the officer had been guilty of some grave offense, and that Mr. Pelter was trying to con- sole him by some hopeful prospect.    <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6721-00000103"/> 210    TIE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. When  they reached  the prison, Mr. Pelter masked his look of satisfaction behind an out- ward show of great solemnity. He was a mar- tyr now, and his look and words must support the character. His present quarters, -in comparison with his previous ones, seemed almost cheerful; and he looked around - in spite of his solemnity - with a glance of satisfaction. "Where are your chains?"   e asked, with the tone and  look of that provincial favorite in tragedy before referred to. "Chains!" replied the sheriff, in surprise. Bring them on!" continued Mr. Pelter, loft- ily, " and I will show you how a Christian bears his persecutions." Believing that his confinement would be brief, he wished to nmake the most of it; and if he could really wear the clanking chains, his im- prisonment would prove a mine of wealth to him, since his quick imagination could then in- vest the situation with tragic horrors impossible to invent if he was treated kindly. ' Chains are only us'ed, on desperate criminals,' the sheriff answered.  And  the answer  only served to stimulate Ezekiel's desire to wear them. To be treated as a desperate criminal would be to glorify his martyrdom.    ! "My enemies will not be satisfied if my limbs   lMRe. PELTER AS A STAR.      21-1 are free! Put on the chains!" insisted Mr. Pel- ter. ' It would be contrary  to our regulations," the sheriff, still protested. "Will you bring them  to me anllet me sa lt  ee them?" asked Ezekiel. "Well, it is a curious and unusual request," the sheriff answered, "but I will let you see them if you wish." Leaving Mr. Pelter in the corridor, and smil- ing at the odd  request, the sheriff went out; and soon returned with the clankingl chains. There they are," said the sheriff, dropping them on the solid floor of stone, "and it is a style of jewelry not usually admired." The clanking  sound struck Mr. Pelter's ears like music, and made him  more than ever anx- ious to have on the chains. What an olbject for compassion he would be!   Here they were in- terrupted by a call, and the sheriff hurried out to answer it. For the remainder of the day he  was so engaged that the thought of Mr. Pelter and his chains did not occur to him. As soon as the sheriff had retired, Mr. Pelter lifted up the chains and examined them.    One of them was the arms, and connected two broad iron bands, fitted for the wrists.  These, when properly secured, were firmly riveted. The other one connected broader and heavier bands, formed 9    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6721-00000104"/> 212   THE -MShIAPS OF MR. PEL TER. to clasp the ankles. These also, when properly secured, were firmly riveted. After he had ex- amined them, he tried them on. To secure them, he sacrificed his spotless handkerchief; he tore it into strips, and passing these through the rivet- holes, he contrived to tie them with his fingers and his teeth, so as to hold the bands in place. Then he walked along the corridor and dragged the heavy chain upon the sounding floor until the other prisoners, confined in cells, looked out and watched him  with amazement as he passed their doors. Then he practiced for awhile, in impressive atti- tudes, and would hold his chained hands up be- fore imaginary witnesses. But at length he tired of this, and untied the bands and released him- self. He then began an examination of his prison. The  corridor in which the sheriff left him extended along the side, and was lighted by two large windows, beneath one of which was a nar- row table and a single chair. The windows were made secure by means of heavy iron bars, placed at short distances from each other, and firmly bedded in the solid masonry of the heavy prison walls. Opening' on the corridor was a row of cells, and he now, for the first time, noticed that most of them  were occupied.  The walls, and floor, and cells were all of heavy stone, and the doors were iron-studded, and hung on massive   MR. PELTER AS A STAR.      213 iron hinges, and secured by iron bolts. From little diamond openings in the doors of cells, pris- oners looked out curiously, wondering who this strange man was.  He did not speak to them, but, shrouded in solemnity, and looking on the floor, he 'walked back and fortlh. At last he sat clown by the narrow table, and began to arrange his thoughts for projected tracts and pamphlets. In such employments the day passed by. When it was nearly night the jailer entered and informed the distinguished prisoner that some ladies wished to see him. "Who are they?" he askedc The jailer handed him their cards. "Rachel! and a member of the Board!" he exclaimed, with some excitement.  "Can I sec them here!"  Oh, yes," the jailer answered. "Give me a little time to compose myself.' "How long?" 6 Ten minutes." "All right." And with this reply the jailer went to notify the visitors. The chains were more than ever tempting now, and Mr. Pelter, without reflecting that he would be practicing a deception, commenced  to put them on. "This will touch their hearts!" said he, as he tied the strings.    <pb n="214-215 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6721-00000105"/> 214    THE MSHAPS OF AMR. PE LTER. Then he  sat down again, with one elbow    on the table and  the other hand  upon  his knee; the chain extending  from  the upright wrist to the hand upon the table.   By the time he had arranged all this, and reclined his hlead upon his upright hand, the jailer entered, escorting Rachel and the Austere Member of the Board. The jailer was as much surprised as the ladies were, to see Ezekiel in chains;  and his puzzled look was almost comical. As soon as Mr. Pel- ter saw them, he rose, and, by an artful move- ment, caused  the chains to rattle. Then  he slowly stepped towautrd the visitors, and the heavy clank! clank! clank! upon the    sounding  floor caused them  to-stop and gaze in speechless won- der on the spectacle. The jailer, no less stupe- fied  than  they, wondered  how  and  why  the prisoner had secured and donned' these grim   and heavy trappings. Mr. Pelter was in secret ecstacies, as he be- held the profound effect of his manoeuvre;   but he was careful that his face should not disclose his feelings. Rachel felt she had brought him to this dis- tressful plight, and her self-reproaches and   ac- cusings were unsparing. With tears and protes- tations she assured  Ezekiel that she would not rest until she   had  effected  his release. The Austere Member was too indignant for any such      <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6721-00000106"/> I , I 4 I   AIR. PELTER AS A STAR,      217 expression. In her righteous anger, she threat- ened to bring down the wrath of God and man upon the heads of those who were guilty of the outrage. "He suffered," said Ezekiel, with a look of more resignation which called forth a burst of admiration from the visitors: "and," continued he, "He forgave His enemies."  Now he  raised one hand- withl a clankling, of the chain -and his blandness played like celestial liglht around. "In charity and kindness speak for me,   he  again continued; "but only so; for-I forgive them  ...-all  Here was an exaltation in the moral heights never reached by Ezekiel before; and the mem- ber stood in silent awe before him. "Leave me now," said he, in a tone of ten- der sadness. "Leave me to my meditations."' "Bless you, sir! said Rachel, with emotion. O! Mr. P-e-l-t-e-e-r!" sobbed  the Austere Member. Incapable of further speech, they sadly turned away, and left him to his meditations. Anid as they went, the clank i! clankl! clankl of the heavy chain upon the soundinig floor followed after them, until the iron-studded door had shut them from the prison walls. With their exit from  the stage, the actor's part was done.    <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6721-00000107"/> 218   THE MSIArPS OF MR. PELTER. He had just untied the iron bands, and re. leased himself, when the jailer reappeared. "What is all this nonsense?" the jailer asked. "Do you call it nonsense?" Mr. Pelter an- swered, with pretended indignation. "Shut up! you sanctimonious humbug! Don't try to come it over me! How did you get those things?"- pointing to the chains upon the floor. "The sheriff brought them in." "What! For you to strut and work on peo- ple's feelin's with?" "No; for me to look at." "I have more than half a mind to put them on in earnest, and then see how you'll enjoy it."' "Oh no! Do n't do that!" "You're a cunning scamp!  But I'll put a stop to this high-tragedy!  With this, he took up the chains, and said to Mr. Pelter, "Come this way! It's time to lock you up."  Saying this, he took him to a cell and locked him in. Thus the act abruptly closed; with the Star behind the drop. At a later hour, the laughing stars of heaven peeped forth from behind their curtain, and through the window and the diamond openilg in the door of Ezekiel's cell, winked their shining eyes at him, as though they had enjoyed the scene. Ezekiel was content,   CHAPTER X. THE WlH'TE-FACED WOMAN IN THE TOILS. JOHN  said nothing to his wife of Ezekiel's arrest, for he feared that any mention of the man might raise the ghosts so hard to lay She was now entirely restored, and John was more than ever anxious to contribute to her pleasure, and fill their evening hours with agree- able amusements. When the curtain  dropped  on Mr. Pelter's play in the city prison, hundreds were making ready for the rising curtain at a favorite thea- ter, which promised on that night unusual at- tractions. John and Julia were among the num- ber so making ready. Racllel and the Austere Member were pre- paring for another act in the tragi-comedy wherein they were acting. They resolved to see and talk with Joseph as to Mr. Pelter's persecution and, if possible, to make him  join them  in active efforts for Ezekiel's release. To make sure of finding him as soon as possible, they went to 219    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6721-00000108"/> 220   'THE MAISHAPS OF MR.

So they found a place where they could rest and r1efriesh themselves. After thev had rested and refresled themselves, and when they were about to start for home, tlhey were astonished to  discover howV late it "I declare! it's nearly eight o'clock!" said the Austere IMember. "So late!"  said Rtachel; thena  we can do nothinog more to-nilght. "No," said the member; and they started off to find a conveyance home. They took a stage. As they passed the theater where the unusual attraction -was announced, Rachel caught the member's arm, and  in a quick, excited voice, cried out: "Look!" "Where?" asked the mem)eer. But Rachel did not hear, for she had already pulled the strap, ancl was getting  out. The member followed her. Rachel caught her arm, and hulrried with her to the pavement; she did not stop until she had reachedl the side of the entrance to the theater. They were none too soon. John and Julia almost touched their garments   RA CHEL  NV T7W'E TOILS.     2 I21 as they passed them. Julia was radiant, to-nighit, antd while they were in Rachel's sighllt, she gave John a coquettish tap with her flashing  fan, and such a smile as nmade Rachel writhe in jealous tortures. The throngT soon closed  around - John and Julia, and they disappeared within. "I saw them  getting from carriage before I left the stage!" said Rachel, almost breathless with excitement. "Going to a theater!" exclaimed the member, in a tone of pious horror. "Yes, and   with  his mistress!" Rachel ans- wered, with a hiss of rage. "Is she the oneo   the one he  lives with?" asked the member quickly. "Yes," said Rachel, starting forward.   "Now come with me! I must go in! We cannot wait here!  I must see them when they come out! I'll expose them here! in this public place! The member was most willing to avail herself of this excuse to visit the forbidden precincts of a theater, and they went in together. The member's eyes began to wander in delight around the house; and she could not but think how  much more attractive every thing appeared than in the gloomy places of rectangular enjoy- ment to which she was accustomed. Is it any wonder that pleasure finds more vo- taries than the chilling pageantries of woe? Or    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6721-00000109"/> 222   7'HE MSIA4PS OF MR. PELTER. that people will believe, in spite of all anathe- mas of creeds, that God will show a smiling face, instead of a vindictive one? Rachel's mind was too much occupied by her absorbing passion to notice anything except the objects of her search. These she soon discovered, Cand in a place where she could fix her burning eyes. The gilded balconies, and fluted columns; the graceful draperies of the proscenium and stage; the dazzling lights and crystal pendants; the sparkling jewels and expensive costumes, and even the favorite actors, in their mimic robes of royalty, were all blended in a kaleidoscopic view, with no distinct and separate forms. Two forms alone, in all that wilderness of beauty, were most fearfully distinct-John's--and Julia's. Until the first act closed they did not notice Rachel. Then Julia took her opera-glass land looked around. As she took in the place where Rachel sat, she was at once arrested by Rachel's look. She was puzzled for an instant by some- thing familiar in her face, and then, with solne excitement, she turned to John, and handed him the glass, saying, as she did so: "There is the very face that troubled me in my delusion!  See!  what a wicked look she has!  And how she keeps her eyes upon us! Oh John! she makes me fairly shiver! Who   lR AHCIIEL IV 7THE' TOILS.   223 ever heard  before of an  embodied phantasy? She has the very look of hate that I saw upon her face when she took you off! 'Nonsense! Julia. Donlt get excited over an imagii,ary likeness to an imaginary form!' But John, though  speaking with a show  of confidence, could not avoid a feeling of unrest. "Which one?" he asked, as he  raised tle glass. Julia described the place and person. "Well! she is a starer!" lmuttered John. "Did you ever see her anywhere before?" Julia asked. "Never! answered John. "Well!" said Julia, "it is the strangest thing. See! She seems to look at you with fiendish hatred!" Let her look!" said John, bringing down tile glass, and anxious to lead Julia's mind to other things. But Julia could not resist a feelilng of uneasi- ness, and as the second act commenced, and through all the play, she threw occasional glances across to Rachel. She always met the same im- movable, vindictive look.  John turned  in that direction, too, when he  thought that Julia did not notice him ; and with every look his uneasiness increased. "They see me!" said Rachel to her compan-    <pb n="224-225 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6721-00000110"/> 224   THE MSHiPS OF MR.

But they'll not escape!" And like a vicious beast of prey she watched. When the play was over, Rachel and the melem- ber started from their seats when they saw John and Julia start. Although their seats were on different sides, the distance to the door of exit was about the same. When   John and Julia reached the door, and passed out into the lobby, Rachel and the member were immediately behind them. Before they reached the outer entrance, Rachel stepped up to John and wrathfully con- fronted him. 'How dare you flout - me thus? and openly parade your shame!" she cried, in a loud, shrill voice. 'Drop that huzzy; and come home with me!" "Who are you'? said John, in a sudden blaze of fury; but holding back hot words, in his anxiety to fathom this baffling perplexity. "I am your WIFE! you wicked, perjured, and deceitful man! I'll not submit -" Before she could finish what was already on her tongue, she, and all the crowd, were attracted. by a sharp and sudden cry of anguish from the lips of Julia; and every eye was turned on her.    "See how she keeps her eyes upon us."    <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6721-00000111"/>   RA CHEL IN THE TOILS.     22 Her face was very white; and her eyes were wide, and staring, and fixed on Rachel. "That is not a specter!" said she, specaking slowly. "I am not demented now! It is tle face! the very face! and the very charlge! the monstrous clarge! O God! What is it all?" John, now fearful of the worst results, took off the bridle from his tongue and let his fury fly. With one arm  supporting Julia, he pointed witl his other hand to Rachel; and in a voice which broke like thunder on the air, cried out: ARREST THAT HAG!  The words were like a killing blow to Rachel; and 'she staggered and retreated with a look of horror. The member now rushed in- "How dare you, sir!" said she to John. '"Another one?" cried John. "Are ALL the witches out to-night? Arrest her also!  Julia now required all of his attention; for she seemed about to swoon. "Make way there!"  said he, as he almnost carried her along to reach the open air. John and Julia were accompanied by friends who knew them  well, and who held them hilgh in their esteem; and when they he(ard the mon- strous charge, their indignation was not long un- spoken. They turned on Rachel and the me1m- ber, and  demanded their arrest. An  officer    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6721-00000112"/> 228   the AHSIAPS OF MR. PEL 7ER. appeared and took them both. John, with some assistance, took the half-conscious Julia to the carriage, and sending a messenger for his phy- sician, started for his house. Rachel and the member, confounded by the situation, were taken to the station. When Joseph went home to dinner, on this exciting dlay, Rtachel was absent. This was not strange; for she was often  alsent now.  He waited for her till long past the usual hour, and then took his dinner solus. After diinner she did not come; still he thoulght it nothing strange. Until nearly midnight, he expected, every instant, to hear her ring; but the still- ness of the house remained unbroken. A chima clock on the mantel, with its silver tongue, rang out the hour of midnight; still Rachel had not come.  He walked about the room; then sat down and tried to read; then he rose up and  walked about the  room again. So the dragging, anxious hours passed; and  the chime began  to sound  like lrhythmic voices speaking to his fears. He did not attempt to sleep, but walked and watched, until the sun- light of anotheir morning slanted through the half-closed shutters of the room; still Rachel did not come. When the city was astir, and he could hear upon the streets the swelling hum of toil, he started out to look for Rachel.   RACHEL AIN THE TOLS  .     229 Where should he go? It was too early yet for the Ladies' Board. Perhaps he could gain some information through Mr. Pelter; and what Mr. Pelter knew his wife could draw  from him. With this reflection he set out for Mr. Peiter's 11 use. Mrs. Pelter was much astonisled ly this etaly call, and very naturally suppose that it referred in some way to her husbad. "Mr Smith!"  said she at once,  "why are you so hard  on lhim? If you will only let him off, I will see that he does not trouble you again. If you are so angry that you will not favor him, then let him go on my account. You must know  that he did not attempt to steal. It was his prying curiosity.  He is sometimes almost a fool; but he is not a thief!" "What are you talking of?" asked Josephl. "Why, of my husband, to be sure." "And what of him?" "I want to get him  out of jail." "Out of jail! What's he in jail for?" "Do n't make light of it. You sent him there!" ' I?" "You! ' "' Why, woman, what's the matter with you?

Mrs. Pelter was so puzzled now that she knew not how- to answer him. She knew -as she supposed--that he was sent there by Joseph Smithl; and what reason now had Mr. Smith for denying it?  Perhaps, upon reflection, he had determined to ignore the whole affair, and thus avoid a public scandal. This seemed to her quite likely, and she re- solved to trim to this new tack. Well,' said she, with a knowing look, "sup- pose that it was said that he was held on your complaint?" "I should deny it?" "Would you? Truly?" "Most certainly I should." "And you will not testify against him?" "No." "Nor have your man?" "Why no! Of course not!" ' Will you go with me and say you have no charge against him?--no criminal charge?" "Most certainly I will; for in truth, I have no criminal charge against him." "Well, you are a curious man. But you are very good to me; and you may have a hundred wives before I'll say a word agaiist you; it's none of my business, anyhow!   And  Pelter would be better off if he had not made it his."

"Let's talk of somlething, then, said Joseph, "that I can understand.  Do you know where my wife is?" "Which one? "Which one! Is your head filled with maggots too? Where is Rachel?" "Why sir, I don't know, I am sure." "I thought you might know through Mr. Pel- ter." "Bless you! You forget that Pelter is in prison." "Rachel may be in prison, too, for all I know," said Joseph, gloomily. "That's not very likely," said Mrs. Pelter, with a smile. ' Anything is likely! Why, woman! if you should tell me to my face-and seriously-that I was not Joseph Smith at all, but William Jones, you woulld not surprise me in the least; and I would be more than half inclined to agree with you.

Mrs. Pelter looked after him, through a gather- ing mist about herself. "He begins to muddle me," said she, as she went about her work. Joseph could only wait until he could make inquiries of the ladies of the Board. He did wait. When he saw  the Board, and  learned where Rachel really was, his distress was touch- ing-. Late as it was, on the night before, when Rachel and the Austere Member were taken to the station, a messenger was sent to arouse from sleep another member, and give the startlingc information that Joseph Smith had secured their arrest, and that they were now  confined in prison. At an early hour in the morning a special meeting of the Board was called, to take some vigorous action as to this crowningo outraoge They sent a member to the station, to interview the prisoners and learn the facts. When she re- turned and reported to the Board, their indig- nation was most furious. "Whose turn next?" asked   one, mounting the rostrum, and gesticulating wildly. "Is this man to take us, one by one, and plunge us into dark and loathsome dungeons? Where are all our boasted liberties?" Another jumped upon a chair, and like a rant- ing sibyl on her tripod, called out excitedly'   RACHEL IN THE TOILS.      233 "We have concealed his crimes too long'! He has imprisoned those who saw   his guilty acts, but we are free! and we know his crimes, lld now we must proclaim them!" These; and many other inflammatory speeches, wrought up their minds to a pitch of mad ex- citement, and in the very heat of it, Joseph Smith appeared. '"I come," said he, with his hat in hand, "to ask if you can give me any information as to my wife." "Your wife!  repeated one, contemptuously. "Yes; can you tell me where she is?" "Hear the wretch! Pretending ignorance!" cried out the sibyl fron her tripod. "Wretch!  Pretending ignorance!" repeated Joseph, in a daze. "I ask you where my wife is; if you know, please tell me; if you do not know, then tell me that, and I will retire." You know that she is in prison!" called out another member. "In prison! My wife -in PRISON!! Fdr God's sake, madam, tell me what you mean. How can Rachel be in prison?" "We know it all, sir; don't count upon our ignorance."

' "This is not the first time that you have been before the Board pretending ignorance. But it will not save you. You have gone too far." this Ossa on Pelion was too much for Joseph's shoulders, and he broke down. "Ladies," said he, in a tired, sorrowful, and even touching voice, " if you but knew the sad distraction in miy brain, and could see how sorely I am badgered by perplexities, you would try to aid me, and not turn  me off to wan- der, in my blindness, to paths more intricate.

RACHEL ON TIE STOOL OF PENITENCE. JOSEPH wandered for a time like a somnam- bulist, repeating to himself, in an absent way: "Sent - my wife - to PRISON!" At length it flashed upon his mind that these charges must have some foundation, and that perhaps Rachel was in prison, and that he was falsely chalged with sending her. This thought aroused him in an instant. He made inquiries, and at last found one who knew of the arrest, and who informed him that the prisoners were perhaps already on their exami- nation. Now he hurried on until he reached the court. His wild, distracted look attracted all who saw him, and he forced a passage through the crowd to reach the front. When he reached the little open space before the justice, an officer in attend- ance said: "Here he is." All looked at him, and the justice asked: 230   TILE STOOL OFP P/IV TEzVCEL.   237 "Is your name Smith? "It is" said Joseph. "We are waiting' for you," said the justice, "and the case has been already cldled." Joseph did not seem  to hear him, for he was looking wildly at his wife. Her eyes looked wicked, and were fixed on him. "What have you to say as to the charge against these women?" asked the justice. Joseph, with a sudden start, turned to the justice, and with a look of great amazement, asked: "What is the charge?" "You ought to lknow," said the justice, in sur- prise, "since you ordered their arrest." "I never ordered their arrest!" "What? Here, officer! you made the arrest, I understand. -Iow is this?" "He did order the arrest, your hlonor." "You 're a---"Joseph commenced, turning on the officer. ' Stop!" cried the justice; " where was it, offi- cer?  "In the lobby of the theater, when this mani --Smith -  was coming out." "I was never in a theater in my life," pro- tested Joseph. "Enough of that," said the justice, with imn- patience. "Tell me what you know     of this affair."    <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6721-00000117"/> 2:38   TIIE MAISI1HAPS OF MA. PELTER. "I know nothing of it!" answered Joseph. Nothing? ' Nothing!

"What do you know  of it?" turning to the offhcel'. 'I did not see the fracas," said the officer; "I was called in to make the arrest." Well!" said the justice, turning to the clerk, "if there is no evidence, let these women be dis- charged." Then, turning to Joseph, with some severity he continued: "You should not makle complaints and author- ize arrests, unless you intend to prosecute. It is trifling with officers and courts of justice. "But," still persisted Joseph, 'I never made complaint, rand never authorized the arrests! There is somne mistake- "   THE STOOL OF PEAITENCE.     2'39 "I 've heard enough!  Stand back!"  Then turning to the clerk he said: "Call the next case." So, wondering and wandering more than ever, Joseph stood bauk. Rachel and the Austere Member were at onee discharged. As they  passed out, they were obliged to pass the place where Joseph stood. Rachel would not see or notice him, althoul he tried in every way to attract her notice. The member drew  up to the fullest height of her long, lean form, and turning up her nrose, passed him with a sudden flirt--all the artificial flowers on her hat quivering sensibly, as though in sympathy with her indignation. Joseph went out after them ; but they did not stop or look around.  He tried to overtake thenl, but they hurried on, and all at once they dis- appeared. He waited for their re-appearance, and walked back and forth, for so long a time that lie at last concluded they had found another place of exit. Then he walked away. As John left the theater, supporting the half- conscious Julia, and listened to the language of her violent hysteria, his mind was filled with curious questionings. What he had heretofore be- lieved to be the creations of a distemlpered mind, now came in fornm and specific language. Here IO    <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6721-00000118"/> 240   THEE MSHAPS OF MfR. PELTER. was Julia's white-faced  wollman, and the very chlarge. Here the woman    claimed him ai s her husband. Here she tried to take him   off with her. How had Julia seen all this in the pic- tures of her mind? Was there, in truth, solme spiritual sense too subtle for our gross percep- tions, which enabled some to read the future as an opell page? He had heard men talkl of such a thillng, but he had regarded them as dreamers or as charlatans. Could it be possible that his wife had that intensely electrical temperament, or spiritual affinity, which enabled her to read froim the book of mysteries? How, otherwise, could there be this correspondence of her pre- vious fancies with existent facts? These, and others like them, were but indis- tinct impressions flashing througlh his mind as they hurried home.  The physician  came soon after John arrived. He expressed the most con- fident belief that nothing serious would result. He gave Julia something quieting, and she soon dropped off in sleep. But John was anxious, and did not retire; and he had no sleep  that night. In the morning, when she awoke, he was at Julila's bedside to see if rest had strengthened her. Her eyes were bright and natural, and her mind was clear; but her brow  and lips would occasionally contract, and discover her perplexity.

If I had started on this ground of trust, I should inot have wandered so. Was she arrested?" "Who?"   "The hag?" "Yes."' "  I'm sorry for it, for I 'believe she 's crazy. Don't laugh, John; 'twas 3Tou that made Pelter crazy,. and I do not believe in it. He is simply foolish, and his head is filled with her insanity." "I am   sorry for her, too, if she is crazy." "Why, she looked like it, and her frenzy was most unnatural.

"Wly, John?" "Because you love me." "Can't we love, and yet distrust?" "Yes; but not for very long.  Love is the cable; and distrust the hidden rock which chafes it. If the cable wears against the rock too long, it will surely snap," If there was a shadow on her mind, it was banished by this blunt and impressive figure. With brighter eyes she answered: "John, you are a splendid fellow! And I never loved you half enough! Let us keep our cable from the shoals, and above the fret of hid- den rocks." "Amen!" said John, with a trustful, thankful heart. The morning hours flew.  So absorbed was John in the sublimation of his love, that he did not think of Rachel. When, in the afternoon, he thought of her, he suddenly exclaimed: "I must be off.   My evidence will be required." "Let them  go, John!--let them  go," said Julia.

Not displeased at all on hearing this, Jollb went home again. When Rachel and the Austere Member so quick- ly passed froml Joseph's sight, they were on a mission which, had they been less pious, would ,be called a vengeful one ; they called it one of duty. It was to state their grievances, and  to coln- mence proceedings against Rachel's husband for the crime of bigamy. The case, as they stated it to the attorney, was so clear in every cir- cumstantial detail, that there seemed to be no question as to Joseph's guilt. And when Ralcel made the necessary affidavits, she did not ldrealn that the concise and formal statement was, in all essential features, a pure fabrication, containing not a single tint of truth. r    <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6721-00000120"/> 244   THE OfISHAPS OF MR.

MR. PELTER -LEAVES THE MORAL HEIGHTS.  *   ' . *  * JOSEPH was taken to the city prison. Mr. Pelter and some other prisoners, held for trial, were in the corridor.         ' Ezekiel was seated at the little table, beneath the grated window, engaged in writing. He was employed upon a new Pelterian tract, where, in  exaggerated languagce he gave what he held to be a picture of himself, suffering for his righteous- ness. He was so absorbed in this employment, that the entrance of the sheriff with Joseph Smith did- not disturb him. Even when the sheriff closed the door, with a loud and clang- ing sound, he did not look up. He did not look up till Joseph touched'him on the shoulder and spoke to him. When he did look up, and saw who touched him on the shoulder, he bounded from his chair, and with a frightened look, stammered out a broken exclamation of surprise. "I told your wife," said Joseph, with a smile, 252 i4   7E LEA VES THE MORAL HEIGHTS.    253 "that I would try and help you out of this. But now I am myself a prisoner, and my hands are tied." "You! a - pris-on-er!" exclailmed the aston- ished Mr. Pelter, staring. "Yes," said Joseph,  a nd yet, I'll help you, if I can." "Bless me!" said Ezekiel, now recovereed fro his fear. "Have you a lawyer to advise you?"Joseph asked. "Yes," said Mr. Pelter, with his importance growing.

And here the good man fairly snorted. "Yes." "I know you did!" And at the recollection, Mr. Pelter's warlike spirit began to stir, and frowns began to settle darkly on his brow. At this exciting juncture Mrs. Pelter and the lawyer were shown in. Mr. Pelter, with his majestic step, went forward to receive them. After mutual greetings, he pomp- ously announced: "The Devil's Emissary is at last in bonds!" "That's good news!" said. Mrs. Pelter. "And now I hope they'll catch his Imps- not ne-  glecting those in petticoats; a few selections from your Board would be most wholesome." Ezekiel groaned. "But, to leave the Devil and his angels--" continued' Mrs. Pelter, "I have good news for you." "Ah!" "Yes.  There 's something wrong about this matter of your arrest--I don't know  what it is-but there's something out of gear.

With all his self-importance gone, he sighed, alld meekly took his " cross." The quick, keen eye of Mrs. Pelter soon distinguished Joseph, and in a glow of honest sympathy she hurried up to him. "Why  sir!" said she, "what brings you here?  "They say," said Joseph, with half a smile, and half a sneer, " that I have two wives. Some such notion seemed to' be in your lhead when I saw you last, but then I did not under- stand you." ' Are you here for bigotry?" asked the aston- ished woman. "Such a charge would be much nearer to the mark than bigamy," answered Joseph, smiling. "Bigamy is what I mean, no doubt," said    <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6721-00000126"/> 256   7THE MSHAPS OF MR.

"Oh woman! woman! will you never under- stand! All of this, every charge, and every in- nuendo, is a wicked he !

"No guilty inal could look and speak like that!" said she. "He might deny, and swea, and all that, but 'twould be in a different way. Now, with all my heart, I can work for you!

"Keep up your heart!" said she. "If I find the mischief where I expect to find it, I 'll have some satisfaction on my own account." ' Where do you expect to find it?" inquired Joseph.

"Now," said he, "if you will send your hus- hand's lawyer to me, I will tell him- as H told you--that I have no charge against his client, and that I am  ready at any time, and in any place, to say the same on oath, and that I know nothing of his arrest." "Hear that," said Mrs. Pelter, with a show of some emotion. "You work to get him out of prison, and he works to get you in! I'll take a hand in this affair!" With this she turned and joined the lawyer and her husband. "I wish that you would go and have a talk with Mr. Smith," said she to the attorney. "He will help us."

Now he saw that all of his shortcomings, that he had scored against the Lord, were written on an open page, and charged against himself. "I have often called myself a sinner," said Ezekiel, looking up, " but I never felt like one till now." 'And I 11 venture," said his wife, "that you never stood so fair as now  in the sight of heaven." Her speech was like a revelation to him, and lie really felt himself to be a better man.

"Do you believe him?" asked Ezekiel. "Yes, I do; that's why I am so puzzled. If I did not believe him I should not be puzzled. I can't help believing him; and yet I can not reconcile his statements with what you have said to me. Are you sure that he appeared to make complaint against you?" Well, no," said Mr. Pelter, "he did not per- sonally appear; it was his man -his coachman." "Ah! you did not tell me that. You always spoke of Joseph Smith."

'Now you're- fiank  enough, a,t all events," said Joseph, with a smile. "I have received instructions in a new theol- ooy," replied Ezekiel, looking at his wife, " and a better one, I trust." "Talk your matters over now," said she, "and I will go and talk with Mrs. Smith." "Thank you," said  Josephl, with a look of gratitude. "I believe that all of us will profit by your 'new theology;' for I have heard your exposition." With a look of satisfaction, the energetic wo- man left them.    <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6721-00000132"/> CHAPTER   XIII. SOME VERY STRANGE DEVELOPAENTS. RACHEL was much surprised when she saw the card of Mrs. Pelter; but she concluded to re- ceive her, and so went in where Mrs. Pelter had been seated. The meeting was embarrassing to both; b-ut Mrs. Pelter, in her impetuous way, commenced: -"I just left your husband." "In prison?"Rachel asked, speaking with an effort. "Yes," said Mrs. Pelter. '6 and my husband is in there with him." "O!  What an awful thing it is!"   cried Rachel; and she hid her face behind her hand- kerchief. "It's more likely to turn olt in goode," said Mrs. Pelter, "for now we begin to see the right of things." "What do you mean by thatt?" asked Rachel, looking at her. "Why, it seems that Mr. Smith had no hand   S TRANGE VDE   0ELOPMENTS.     269 at all in Pelter's matter, and knew   nothin(g of it; so you see that charge   falls.

"Mistakes  Why, woman,    Mr. Pelter saw him --" "' There is the trouble!" interrupted Mrs. Pel- ter. 66 Pelter has t1 voon-derful imagination!" "Do you mean to say that your husband did not see him, as he said he did?" "Well, he begins to think so now." " Who begins to think so?" "' Pelter." He begins to think that he  did not see what he said he saw?" "' Yes." ' Then how could he so mislead me?   It -was a wicked thing to do." " As I said before, it was his imagination- his von-derful imagination!  That Ladie's Board has practiced on   it, and drawn him this way and that way by it, until they made him think he saw what he did not see at all. That Board was determined to lmake out a case against your husband, and they made use of Pelter and his wonderful imagination."

"What obeject could they have?" "Why-- as they say-- it is their mission . They think, somehow, that they are the scourges of the Lord; and when no one appears for pun- ishment, they look up some one to whip; they've made a fool of Pelter a hundred times, but now he's found them out and quit them." Mrs. Pelter saw' by Rachel's look that the Board was. sufferinlg at her handcs, and she was sharp enoughll to let the impressionl wolrk, with- out speaking more of it at present. '6 Joseph certainly caused my arrest,'" said Ra- chel, with more confidence. "No; you're mistaklen there," said Mrs. Pel- ter, nlo less confident. "I am  not mistalken! Why do you think I am mistaken?" "Because, at daylight, he came to our house to see if  Mr. Pelter knew where   you had gone." ' This morning?" "This morning. He did not know that Mr. Pelter was in prison.- When I told him of it he  was much surprised. He was in distress because he did not know  where you hLad gone.

"He came to dinner, ma'am, at the usual hour." "When did he go out again?" "He did not go out; he waited here for you." "How long did he wait for me?" "All night, ma'am; he  did n't; o to bed." "He went out in the evening?" "No ma'am." "But I saw him! I saw him at the theater!" "If you say so, ma'am, of course I'll not dis- pute it." "Then he did go out?" "No ma'am-he did not.

PELTER. "You may go," said Rachel, with such a baffled look as made Mrs. Pelter smile. "I know," said Rachel to Mrs. Pelter, that Joseph was at the theater, for I saw him there; and yet the evidence is positive that he was here! What is the explanation? He told me, just before the sheriff took him off, that he was innocent of every charge--and he called God to witness." "Do you wonder now that a man of Pelter's wit should make mistakes? Your husband and yourself are as much at sea as Pelter ever was. Did you ever think that this Board might be playing on your imagination?" "No." "Where have all these charges against your husband come from?" "From Mr. Pelter and the Board." "Pelter will retract!  Does this not leave everything without foundation?" "Except as to what I saw." "Taking all you saw, can you say from that that your husband was really guilty of wlhat was criminal or wicked?" "Taking what I saw alone, it would not be sufficient. I took that with what was told me." "And they took that in making what they told to you. Did you ever stop and ask yourself why they have taken up this thing so earnestly?"   "No." "Can you understand it now, when I stuggest it?  "No." "In every new  appearance, have they not always turned the worst side -out for you?" I never thought of it before; but I think they have." "Have they ever tried to put a good face on anything? even when there was a doubt as to appearances." "I believe they never have!" said Rachel, growing more excited. "But I never looked at things in such a way before." "Have they not made you absolutely see some things that you never could have seen without their spectacles?" "It may be so--it is so! But 'why shouldl they do it? I never injured them; and Josephl never injured them." "They are MEDDLERS!" And in that one word Mrs. Pelter's case was stated. Rachel now began to look   upon herself as much more guilty than before.

If Mr. Pelter should "*'    <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6721-00000135"/> 274   THE IZ-ISZIAPS OF MR. PELTEA. retract, where would lbe her charge of bigamy? She would not have a single .fact to support the charge. Joseph's presence at the theater would not support it; and that, too, might be explained; besides, Joseph solemnly affirmed that he was not at the theater. How weak her case appeared in the light of Mrs. Pelter's strictures! How had it ever looked so strong to her? It must have been the magnifying glasses of the Ladies' Board! She had felt self-condemined for sending him to prison, when she believed him to be guilty; but now, that he might be innocent, her condemnation was increased a thousand times.  Her very strength of character made her fault appear more  monstrous than  it would  have seemed to many others, and it crushed her. "Go back!" said she-in a sudden outhurst of remorse, and kneeling on the floor before her visitor- "and tell my husband that you left me on my knees crying for FOIRGIVENESS!" "No, no " said Mrs. Pelter, lifting Rachel up. '"I would rather taike a different message to him -it would distress him less and help him more; besides, it is too late to go to-night." "What message would you rather take to him?" "I would rather tell him that, in your hon- est heart, you believe him to be innocent." "Tell him that! I do! I do!"   STRANGE DE VELOPMENTS.     275 "And that you will not associate with' that  Ladies' Board." "Tell him that! God knows, I've had enough of them! And that starting on an honest faith in him, you will join hands with me, and hunt these flying rumors until we catch and strangle them." "Tell him THAT! I will! I will!" "Oh why have I not talked witl you before?" "Because the 'Ladies' did not like me, I suppose ; or my blunt ways of speeclh. I think that you had better see your husband; but not to-night, it is too late, and you need rest." I 'll go to-morrow. And to-night I 'll think of all you've said to me." Mrs. Pelter left her thus, and as she trudged along toward home, she indulged in self-congrat- ulations. "A  good day's work, I think!" said she. "Arranged  for Pelter's freedom-pitched, his idols over -emptied all his oil-cans---given Smith some comfort- and put his wife upon a smootler road to travel." "This is an ugly business, after all," said 'a member, at a meeting of the Board, on the fol- lowing day.  "Did you say," (turning to the Austere Member)  "that Mr. Pelter was in chains?"    <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6721-00000136"/> 276   THtE AMSHAPS OF iMR. PELTER. "Yes; in heavy chains!" replied the Austere Member. "They do not put chains upon a prisoner un- less the case is a very strong and serious one," the questioner continued. "I begin to think," remarked another, "that Mr. Pelter has not given us the truth in all these things." "I think so, too," another said. "How  can you think  so?" cried Miranda Trap. Because, the coachman swore  " "But," Miranda interrupted, " we have already said that the coachman was a perjurer!" "I know we have, and I begin to thilnkl that we have said some othzer things that we shoulc not have said." "Why   What do you mean?" "I mean," said -the questioner, with spirit, "that we have  been too quick  in making charges!? "Why! What has turned your head so sud- denly?" "Well, I began to feel uneasy about some things and I talked them over with my husbandc--" ; With your husband!" cried several voices; and one continued, "Are we to take men's opinions in our affairs?  "On such subjects," said the Doubting Mem-   STRANGE DEVELOPMENTs.     2" ber, standing stoutly up, in self-defense, "I think that lmen's opinions are better than our own." This was heresy. ' Men's opin-ions!" said the Austere Miember, with a snort, and turning up her nose. "Well!" said the doubter, not to be put down, " you have been taking a man's opinioll- and acting on it, too -and he not the most prudent man- iln my opinion!" "Name him!" said the Austere Memnber, with a frown. "Mr. Pelter!" "A-hem!  But he is one of us," said the Austere Member, with some confusion. "What did your husband say?" one asked. "He said that Pelter was a blockhead, and thlat we should get rid of him; and that his piety was all a sham!" (Iere Miranda flusled and looked quite furious.) "And he said that we had pushed on Mrs. Smith to make a clarge of bigamy, when there was nothing to support it!" "Humph " said the Austere Member, thow- ing up her head. - Why did not Mr. Pelter tell us," continued the Doubting Meimber, " howtv he eitered what he  called the 'abode of sin'.?

And my husband says   and I agree with him -that we had better let such things alone; and instead of prying about our neiglhbors' houses, that we attend to missionary business-- if we have any. Now, I have spoken!" "I - should - think - you  had!" said the Austere Member, in a raage, for she was the nasal organ of the Board to collect domestic scents. The courageous doubter found herself support- ed, and the party of, reformers was soon respect- able. They began to question all of Ezekiel's reports, and the husband of the doubter was thought by them  to be quite sensible. The discussion waxed furious at last, and the reformer's ranks grew stronger. Finally, the Austere Member stood almost alone, and no one would have dreamed, to hear her talk, that she ever coulc have been upon the moral heights. Quivering with rage, and white with passion, she called to the gushing vessel, and these two together left the ladies' rooms, never to re-enter them. So, having lost its nose, the Board cared no more for scents, and all their little microscopes were packed away. Then the members all looked up and saw their telescope, and going up to it, they cleaned off the rust and fixed the object- glass to take new images.   STRANGE DEVELOPMENTS.          279 On that same day the Board received a strange communication, written    in a  cramped, irreg'ular hand.  They had never seen a specimen of Mrs. Pelter's writing, otherwise they might have known from  whom  it came.   Without remark, or colm- ment, or any signature, it read as follows: "Thou shalt not go up and down, as a talebearer, among thy people." -(Lev. xix. I6.) "The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords."--(Psa. Iv. 21.) "Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut offL" --(Psa. ci. 5.) "In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin; but he that refraineth his lips is wise,"- (Prov. x. I9.) "A froward man soweth strife, and a whisperer separateth chief friends." - (Prov. xvio 28.) "Where no wood is, there the- fire goeth out; so, where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth." -(Prov. xxvi. 20.) "Judge not, that ye be not judged." -(Matt. vii. I.) "For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile."-(I Peter iii. IO.) The  royal reveler  was  not more confounded by the writing on the wall than were the mem- bers of the   Board  by  this strange communica- tion. "I Who ever thought,"    said  one, "that all of this was in  that Book which we profess to take as our guide? "It condemns us all,"    another said.  And  all of them  were  visibly impressed  by it.    <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6721-00000138"/> 280   THE MZSHAPS OF AMR. PELTER. That Board did not soon forget these words; and even they began to grow in charity. Mrs. Pelter was at the city prison early in the morning. Slhe reported her success with Rachel, and encouraged Joseph by he  confidence. Ezekiel had slipped and stumbled, through the night, as he tried to walk in her new way, and felt discouraged when she came. She brushed tle oil from his shoes, and gave them a filmer hold when he stepped out, and he took heart again. Rachel also came. It was observed by Joseph that she -had never been so gentle as when she spoke to him of his confinement. Now, for the first time since suspicion and distrust began to grow between them, they talked of all their troubles, and tried to understand each other. Everything was satisfactorily explained, except the story, to which Mr. Pelter still ad- hered, that he did see Julia in Joseph's lap, and the strange encounter at the theater. Joseph still insisted that he was in neither place; and he  spoke witl such sincerity that Rachel could not charge him with an intention to deceive. Perhaps," said he, " even this will be cleared up some day." It was now  plain to Rachel that her charge of bigamy could not be, sustained; and in -spite of the conviction that her own rage and jealousy   STRANGE DE VELOPMENTS.      281 were alone responsible for the present situation, she felt relieved. After this, she would not leave her husband, except at night-whenl she was obliged to go- and then she would return on the followinlg (ay. So, day after day, she cane ; and even ill tlese prison walls they both became more, free il all their thoughts than  wlen surrounded by  the walls of bigotry and  self-rigllteousness, which closed them in fromn charity. At length the day for Mr. Pelter's trial came. He was formally arraigned, and   plead "Not guilty." The room was full; for Mr. Pelter's '!labors" had made him known to many, and they were curious to see if the great exemplar had beel guilty of a crime.  The coachman was present as a witness, but John was absent. Indeed, John lhad not been subpcenaed; for all the officers sup- posed that Joseph was the one who made coin- plaint. John did not know, in fact, that the trial would be had that day. Mr. Pelter, feeling certain of acquittal, was serene and bland. ITe bowed with dignlity to the presiding judge, and to the sheriff, and to the prosecutiing lawyer, and the curious audience; then he sat down, and spread his large and spot- less handkerchief across his knee. A jury was soon called, and properly examined,    <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6721-00000139"/> 282   TIIE MSHAPS OF MR.

"He 's game!" said one in the crowded room, "and comes smiling to the scratch." "Order in court!" the sheriff cried. Your honor," said the state's attorney, " the prosecuting witness-Mr. Smith-is now in jail, but he  has not been tried, and is competent to testify." The coachman, hearing this, pricked up his ears, alnd leaned forward. "What is the charge against him?" asked the court. "Bigamy," the attorney answered. "What's that! what's that!" said the excited coachman, springing from his seat. "Order!" cried the sheriff. The coachman left his seat, and silently ap- proached the sheriff, and in a whisper asked: "Did that lawyer say that Mr. Smith was now in jail, and charged with bigamy?" "Yes," said the sheriff, "you know it well enough. Sit down!" The coachman stepped back to his seat again, but his face showed such perplexity that those around him were attracted by it. "What's the matter?" asked one near him. "That crazy Pelter said he had two wives!"   STRANGE  )EVELOPMENTS.     283 replied the coachman, "but who could ever have believed it?" "Who had two wives?" the neighbor asked. '"Why Mr. Smith! my master! To think that he would serve my mistress so I She's a angel, sir! And he was not a bad man. I'll not believe  it till I see him!  ' You'll see him soon; they'll bring him in." While they were talking the court directed that Joseph Smith be brought, and the sheriff went out after him.  The officer soon returned with Joseph Smith in charge. "There he is!" said the coachman's neighbor. "Is that the man?" Thomas looked at him, and instantly replied: "Who ever could believe it?" "Then he is the man?" "Yes. Let me out of this!  I must go and see my mistress! Poor thing! Poor thing! I must break it to her easy; for if she hears it sudden, 'twill be the death of her!' Saying this, and in his great excitement not thinking that he would soon be called to testify, lie rushed out, and hurried home. The first witness called was Joseph  Smith. He was sworn, and took the witness-stand. State's Attorney.--"Will you tell the jury, Mr. Smith, what you know of this affair?"

Mrs. Pelter, who sat by Rachel, back among( the benches, quivered with excitement.

Rachel asked. "I am  more confused by every fresh development." "This proves more than that Pelter was ar- rested by some other person,- and without the knowledge of your husband." "What more?" "Why, don't you see? If it was not your husband who saw  Pelter in the barrel-trap-- and Pelter told us both that he was caught there --then it was not your husband who was in the house! And it was some other lap the woman sat in! Whoever that man was, he came out, and saw Pelter in the trap!" "Can that be possible? O! I hope so!" "And if that is true, then, don't you see, if there is a man so much like your husband that Pelter could not see the difference, perhaps it was that same man that you saw at the theater; for, remember, he was with 'the very woman!" "That would leave my husband clear of every- thing!" said Rachel, "and show that he had told the truth in everything. But how can one man be so like another?" "There you have me," answered Mrs. Pel- ter. "Joseph had a brother--a twin-brother-" said Rachel, musing, "who was so much like Joseph that he was mistaken for him often ; but   STRANGE DEVELOPM1E V 7S.     287 they have not met for over thirty years --and Joseph thinks that John is dead." "Why have you not thought of this before?" asked Mrs. Pelter, much excited. "Why should your husband's brother be more likely to be dead than your husband?   If your husband's brother should be here, we would have a key to all the mysteries. Then it would appear that your husband's brother was where he had a right to be, and where he should be- with his wife!" "You reason like a lawyer," answered Rcachel, admiring her. "With your clear brain, I could have solved the riddle, and saved myself from misery. I have been a blind and foolish woman, and I shall not blame Joseph if he never can forgive me." "You go too far in saying that. He must admit that appearances convicted him, and that it would require a stronger faith than mortals have, to hold him guiltless in the face of them. As soon as we get out of this, we must search for this brother of your husband." "What a comfort you are to me!" said Ra- chel, with emotiol; " and yet the ladies told me that you were not a Christian." "As they understand it, I am not," said Mrs. Pelter.

There was a beauty in these simple words that Rachel had never found in all her austere creeds. When Thomas, the coachman, reached John's house, he was so blown that he could scarcely speak. He sat down in the kitchen to recover breath.\ "Why, Tom; what's the mattter?" asked a servant. Thomas only shook his head. "What is it, Torn?" another asked. "It's trouble! that's what 'tis," said Thomas. Now, more curious, the servants pressed him with their questions. But he only answered by an inquiry: "Is she home? ' "Who?" "Mrs. Smith, of course!"

"How very clear you make it!"    <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6721-00000144"/> 292   THE MSHAPS OF lMRl. PEL TER. "What was I in jail for?" continued John, motioning' with his hand for Julia to keep quiet. "4 For bigamy! So the sheriff and the lawyer said." This answer struck both John and Julia in- stantly. Here was the same old charge. But now some other man was in John's skin to an- swer for it. "Did you look at me?" continued John. "Of course I did," said Thomas. ' But might you not have been mistaken'? Might it not have been some other man you saw?" SaWT?) ) "Will you turn and look into that glass?" said Thomas, pointing to a pier-glass. John turned, and stood before the glass. "Is that you? In there?" asked Thomas. "No," answered John; "that is my image or reflection." "Well," said the coachman, "' hen you can find among living men an image as licke you as that is, then I'l1 say the prisoner might be that other man."5' Such an image, among living men, flashed at once upon John's mind; and turning quickly to his wife, he said: I wonder if it can be my brother Joe?" "Was he like you?"Julia asked. "Yes. But how can Joseph be in prison on   STRANGE DE VELOPMENlTS.     293 such a charge? He was a very pious soul; and, in fact, he was my pious father's pride, while I was the castaway and reprobate." "His name was Smith," said Tiomas, wonder- ing. ' That's what they called him." His name was Smith, and he is my image! It must be my brother Joe!" said John, with much excitement.  'Julia, I must go and see what this trouble is, and help him out of it!" "I hope," said Jullia, " that he is not guilty of such a crime as Thomas says he 's charged with. But I tell you, John, these sanctimonlious men will bear close watching sometimles; they'll be no better than the rest of us; and too often not half so good." I 'd like to see a better saint than you ar'e, answered John.  "But I lmust be off.   Come, Thomas!" When they arrived at court, Thomalts was takell by an officer and brought before the court. 4 Is that the witness?" asked the judge, with a frowning look on Thoilas. Yes, sir,' replied the officer. "I am more than half inclined," said the judge to Thomas, "to send -you to the lock-up!" "For -wha- wha -what?" asked the tremblilng Thomas. For having left the court-room  when you. were wanted as a witness!"    <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6721-00000145"/> 294   THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. Here John stepped forward. "May it please the court," said he, ' my man here," (indicating Thomas) "in his surprise and consternation, did not think of his surroundings, and -- "Why! what's this?   interrupted the aston- ished judge, as he looked from John to Joseph, and from Joseph back to John. "Another Proteus!" This attracted all within the view, and others looked from John to Joseph, and from  Joseph back to John. Now, there was a buzz, and whispers of astonishment. "It is the KEY!" cried Mrs. Pelter, rising up in her excitement, and speaking in a voice which could be heard throughout the room. "It is my  brother JOHN!"  cried Joseph, standing up, and looking at him. "Yes, Joe! you're right," said John, with a look and tone of gladness. "Order in -court! the sheriff cried, and all was still again. Now John continued-speaking to the court again : "There is some strange mistake in this affair', I fear, resulting from the remarkable resemblance which you have observed between ,my brother and myself. If you will allow a little time for onsnltation, I have no doubt the ends of jus- tice will be subserved by it."   STRANGE DE VELOPMENTS.      295 "' I never saw a resenmblance so exact!" re- plied the judge.  "Take time for consultation. I can now beg'in to see why your brother Jo- seph so persistently denied what we supposed to be the fact.  Let the coachman take   his seat." Thomas took his' seat. John went to Joseph, and they took each other's hands, and made such demonstrations of their pleasure as their situation would allow.  Then they were joined by Mr. Pelter's lawyer. Mr. Pelter was the picture of comic misery. The situation was so far beyond his misty pow- ers of analysis, that he was incapable of cohe- rent reasoning. As though he might find some inspiration there, he looked up to where his wife was standing. She, with  parted lips and sparkling eyes, grasped and fully understood the whole. By ler side was Rachel, with  hands clasped  on her breast, looking pale and anxious, and her re- morseful soul speakilng in her staring eyes." "O!" she hoarsely whispered to Mrs. Pelter, "6 why did I not trust my husband?" Mr. Pelter's lawyer called the state's attorney to the consultation. Everything was now  ex- plained and understood between them. "Then,' said the state's attorney, "the case against Mr. Pelter falls."    <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6721-00000146"/> 296   THE MSHAPS OF MR. PELTER. "And so does the case against my brother Joseph, I should think," said John. "Undoubtedly," replied the state's attorney. "No case can be made out against your brother, for he is innocent; his wife was entirely mistaken." With these conclusions the conference closed; and  the state's attorney addressed the court, explaining, in all their details, the curious, and comical, and serious mistakes which had  ended in these prosecutions. Joseph's innocence, as well as Mr. Pelter's, being  thus made clear, both, by proper orders and  proceedings, were at once discharged from custody. '"Come on!" was heard in a sharp and snap-  ping female voice, from another portion  of the room, and all looked to see from wlhol it came. A  tall, lean  form  was seen maklin(g long and ungraceful strides  for the outer door, and a shorter and  Imeeker \woman was following after her. Mrs. Pelter, from  her position, saw  them both,  and she quickly recognized  the Austere Member of the Board, and   the now broken ves- sel, Miranda Trrap.  And so, without our bene- dictioin, they make  their final exit from  these veracious chronicles. Mr. Pelter's eyes at last began to open. "Bless me!" said he, " who   ever could have thought it!"   STRANGE'?/L OPJE'r',5.     '2;)7 John and Joseph, arm-in-arLln, walked outl, andll waited nlear the door for R-achel and Mrs-. Pelt,er. "1Ohi Joe!"  said Jo0In withl a he ar'ty laugll.

Pelter came, throg,'l, the door, and made a rush for Joseph, and caught him bly both hlands, and congratulated him. "Evidently," said John aside, -with his lalgol- ing eyes on Mrs. Pelter, "Joe is not fastidiolls as to styles in beauty." "Where is Rachel?" Joseph    asked, as soonl as Mrs. Pelter gave him  time to speak. "She 's just inside the door," said Mrs. Pelter, and won't come out until she knows that you forgive her." "Don't she know me yet?" said Joseph. "I " go for her, then." He went, and came out again with Rachel on his arm.  Her face was pale, and her eyes were filled with tears; but at light; was s]lining throlloug her tears, which made hler almost seem    attrac:- tive. Joseph   led her utp to John, and forlmally presented her.   She blushed and stammered   like a frightened girl; and  John, to break the em- barrassment, took her hand and said: "I must first ask your pardon, sister, and then    <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6721-00000147"/> 298   7THE' MSItA PS OF MR,.

Can you forgive me for my unbroth- erly behlavior in the lobby of the theater?"9 i-tachel blushed again; but now she looked at Jol1n, and admired his frank and smiling face. '"The fault was my own, I'm sure," said she, "'and 1 ask your forgiveness, for insulting you and your charming wife." Charming!" answered Jolin, with  another lauhl , "you did not think so then! ha! hal! ha!"9 "This is Mrs. Pelter, John," interrupted Jo- seph, as he presented 'his courageous champion. "Ah"! said John, with a twinkle in his eye, "I have entertained your husband I believe. I gave him the run of my gooseberry bushes, and let him play with Leo." Now it was time for Mrs, Pelter's blushes; but for all of that she admired John. "He made you trouble, sir, I know," said she. "Oh, do n't mention it," said John.  " le took me once to his Ladies' Board, and there I met a gushing maiden  7" "What's that?" cried Joseph. "Why, Pelter took me to his 'Board,' and they wanted me to tell about the idol worship- ers-it was rather in your line, that- and now, by Jove, though I never tlought of it before, they must have thought that Jolhn-the bad boy - was the missionary, Joseph!"   STRAIVGE DEVELOPMENTS.     299 R But who was the gushing maiden?" inquired Joseph, smiling at his brother's raillery. "The 'miailen all forlorn? They called her Trap - Miranda Trap. I met her after that one dlay upon the street, and she wouldn't look at me! And Pelter said -he was with her- that I had another woo-man!" "Who was with you?" Joseph asked. "Why, Julia-my wife.": "Do you know," said Joseph, "that those women have been swearing that I was the one who made that visit to the Board; and that I was walking with your wife that day?" "Oh, Joe! you wicked  fellow!" responded John, with a wink at Mrs. Pelter. "Rachel!" said Joseph, suddenly, " where is Miranda's letter? That's John's." "Joseph!" cried Rachel, in real distress, "if you can forgive my folly, let's go home." John, seeing her distress, dropped his Danter- ing tone, and said: "No! You must all go home with me. You'll find a sailor's welcome in his house and heart.  And I want you to see my wife; for she is a charming woman!" "Not to-day! not to-day!" said Rachel.  "I mnust go home!"

Joseph gave the street and number, and with this they parted. When John reached home he astonislhed Julia by ant explanation of all the strange mistakes. "then," said Julia, it was your brother's wife who watched us at the theater, and made that charge upon you in the lobby?" "Yes,' said John; " she thought 'twas Joe she saw witlh you." "Well, I am  soirry for her, for I know someC tiling of the stings of jealousy." "I am  sorry for her too, for she takes the blame of everything upon herself. We must go over there to-morrow, and you must try to com- fort her." "Yes. Then everything' is clear, except my curious fancy as to Joseph's wife coming hiere for you, and your stealing off to her." "And since tlhat is a fancy, it can not be cleared," said John. On the following, dlay they drove to Joseph's house. Rachel was composed, and almost cheer- ful; and Julia's manner was so friendly and caress- ing, that Racllel was at once quite charmed. When  Julia was introduced to  Josepll,. he blushed, and was so sensibly confused that John remarked it. "It's all right now," said Rachel, as she saw Joseph's blush, and  put her hand  on Julia's   STRACE E D  QL*.'ET..    , 1T ] shoulder; " but you must confess, wheiif I did not know  you, and saw  you take Josephl in your carriage, - "Take Joseph in my carriage!" repeated Julia. "You took me home to lunch one day, you know," said- Joseph, still uneasy. "What!" cried Julia, " and asked you to take me to the theater?"  "Yes."  "Was that you?" "Yes." "I thought it was John! Here Julia laughed, and laughed, and laughed, until the tears ran down her face; and then she held her sides, and cried, ' O dear! O dear!" and laughed again. "What is it, Julia?  What is it, Joe?" in- quired John. "If there's anything so funny let us all enjoy it." "'And I asked you to my boudoir?" continued Julia, ready to explode again. "You thought it rather free in a perfect stranger, I suppose. -No wonder! Ha! ha! ha!  Then Joseph told the story, and John began to laugh. "What did you think, Joe?  Did she scare you? 'T was well your name was Joseph!? "I thought I'd better get away," said Joseph, "and I did!"     <pb n="302-303 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6721-00000149"/> 302   7TE MSHAPS OF 1IRN. PELTEIR.

Why, I made my wife believe-and I be- lieved it, too-that that was all her fancy." Then Joseph, the pride of Israel's heart, and John, the unregenerate, sat down to talk to- getier. Julia said to Rachel, as they sat down to- gether: "All this would make a curious story, if written out and printed in a book."

His are the birds'-notes. He interprets the quaint, low tune of the busy wren, the soaring snatches of the sky-lark, the liquid language of the oriole, the ever-sad and questioning call of the Dart- ridge, and the pheasant's everlasting monotone.
