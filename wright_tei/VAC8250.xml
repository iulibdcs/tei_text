SUBSTANCE AND SHADOWS.&#xD;
PERFECTION IN LIVING.&#xD;
How few understand the art of living happily! Is it&#xD;
not strange, when so many hive lived before us, and we&#xD;
might derive the advantage of their experience, that, after&#xD;
all, we so fail 4ff attaining the desirable end? We begin&#xD;
wrong, and then keep on wrong, and, ot course, are&#xD;
doomed to end wrong. Take, for example, a newly'xn~r-&#xD;
ned pair. The inquiry is not often "what can we aftbrd,&#xD;
and how can we best consistently live?" but, "what&#xD;
can I induce my father to give me ~I -how handsome an&#xD;
outfit can I possibly obtain?" The Brussels carpets and&#xD;
long mirrors, in the houses of the afilnent, did not always&#xD;
haiig there. There was a tedious process of a~cumu1ation&#xD;
before si4llcient was earned to justify the outlay. The&#xD;
father, ten chances to one, sailed ~o foreign lands, encount.&#xD;
ered storms and shipwreck, but, not disheartened, still&#xD;
pursued his employment, and at length became a success..&#xD;
ful owner, and retired from his exposed condition upon&#xD;
the waves. I3ut he has a daughter. She ne~e~ knew of&#xD;
her mother's anxieties lest master and c~rg&amp;amp; should be&#xD;

lost; for she was too young to be distressed with imagin-&#xD;
ary troubles. She is to be married; and this same&#xD;
hard-earned money is freely expended, and the new man-&#xD;
sion outyjes the old one; but alas! we fear the experi-&#xD;
ence of that toiling pair is wanting to learn the art of&#xD;
living rightly. The idea that "father is rich, and I shall&#xD;
never want;" has been the ruin of thousands..&#xD;
There, too, is the opulent merchant. Was he always&#xD;
so? Some may tell you he once traded in a very small&#xD;
way; but they remember, too, how carefully he kept an&#xD;
eye to his accounts, that expenditures should not exceed&#xD;
the income. Is ~he ~son pursuing the same course?&#xD;
Where he rides, the father walked. When the father&#xD;
began life, the evenings were not 8pent at the theatres&#xD;
nor amusements; but in a~snug. corner, with a little square&#xD;
table before a small fire, he used to "flg~re up" how&#xD;
much he could afford. to purchase for the enlargement of&#xD;
his stock; and then hi~ prudent~ wife. was willing, to dis-&#xD;
pense with all useless . finery. How is it n~w 3 He is&#xD;
worth two hundred, thousand.! Does he enjoy more at&#xD;
the marble table, when the son is~vexing him to know if&#xD;
he.nia.y* not~go abroad, as an apology for doing nothing,&#xD;
than at that little square one, where only one candle shone&#xD;
upon his iDay~.Book and. Ledger? He will tell you,&#xD;
"But Frank must be. indulged ;" and the money is&#xD;
launched out which will unfit him for a busy, industri-&#xD;
ous, . happy life. Traveling merely to be idle, never&#xD;
benefited anybody; for they are too indolent to improve.&#xD;
But what comes.of.ail this living? Certainly there is&#xD;
little happiness; for, at present, a busy round of exciting&#xD;
pleasw~e isco~iuted as the pprfeetioii of. living.&#xD;

:Now, satiety follows all this eflbrt to be 'happy~;&#xD;
whereas a steady, industrious person, who lives with fore~.&#xD;
thought, who really desires to .izr~jrove, does not do' so.&#xD;
Things that are had for the mere asking are not&#xD;
prized like those for which we have toiled. It is a mis.&#xD;
enable notion that we must shield children from kiiowing&#xD;
how to labor ~-~-ay, and from actual labor. They never&#xD;
can know happiness; they never will live well.&#xD;
When shall we learn that . it j5 not what is without,&#xD;
'hut what is within, .that gives the true perfection of liv-&#xD;
ing? I believe the trouble lies in not doing, as well as&#xD;
in overdoing. When I see people so vexed because they&#xD;
cannot procure some one to do for them what they would&#xD;
feel all the better for doing themselves, my envy for the&#xD;
wealth which occasions the torment, ceases. The fret-&#xD;
fulness of the present day is much on the increase, simply&#xD;
because we are so dependent on others. The multiplica-&#xD;
tion of luxuries makes the multiplication of servants.&#xD;
We Iwerload our tables, and at the same time have a dis-&#xD;
taste for viands which no toil has sweetened. The poor&#xD;
body is put under "electric shocks," because our nerves&#xD;
are too weak to oversee our cook or direct our chamber-&#xD;
maid.&#xD;
We are forced to ride where we should walk, and then&#xD;
complain of the inattention of the coachman, and scold&#xD;
him about his carelessness. "Getting one's living" is&#xD;
considered vulgar; and, as no passport to good society is&#xD;
furnished people who work, is it any wonder so many are&#xD;
striving to . be gentlemen and ladies? This causes the&#xD;
clerk to lay out all his salary (it is well if he does not&#xD;
more), in imitation of the rich man's son, who dresses no&#xD;

bettor than he; and the little shop-girl foregoes many&#xD;
comforts, that she may secure a silk dress like a custom-&#xD;
er's? With these perverted views, where are we to end?&#xD;
Who will make the next generation? Let us learn to be&#xD;
as independent as possible of others. Let us ask, with&#xD;
a manly courage, can I afford to do thus and so? Will&#xD;
it dignify my character to yield to this indulgence? Shall&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
SUDDENLY RICH.&#xD;
MR. ATHOL went to bed a poor man, and awoke the&#xD;
next morning worth some two hundred thousand dollars!&#xD;
Before the accession of wealth, he was a toiling man for&#xD;
a dependent family; yet he always acquired sulllcient, by&#xD;
his industry, to keep his children in good condition, and&#xD;
his wife a light-hearted woman; besides having an agree-&#xD;
able intercourse with neighbors in the same block, under&#xD;
similar circumstances. With a free and easy heart, every&#xD;
Saturday night Athol settled with the world, and squared&#xD;
all his accounts; so he went to church with a feeling of&#xD;
independence as long as his health should be continued~&#xD;
him. To be sure, riches in the prospective looked invit-&#xD;
ing to this worthy couple. They used to wish for them to~&#xD;
enable tbem to highly educate their children, to befriend&#xD;
the poor widow in the next street, and, as they needed,&#xD;
to bestow a pittance upon their aged parents; but they&#xD;
never coveted&amp;amp; luxurious fare, showy dress, or a splendid&#xD;
equipage; perhaps because they were so unattainable&#xD;
they left no room for such wishes.&#xD;
But we said John Athol awoke one morning and found~&#xD;
himself a rich man. Being descended of English pa-&#xD;
rents, it appeared, by an advertisement in the evening&#xD;
paper, "that the heirs of Peter Athol could learn som~&#xD;

&#xD;
thing greatly to their advantage by calling upon Smich&#xD;
&amp;amp; Co." That intelligence was neither more nor less&#xD;
than that an aged uncle a rich, miserly man, who had&#xD;
never married had recently died, and left a will, be-&#xD;
queathing to sundry unknown relatives in America, the&#xD;
heirs of his brother Peter, the whole of his estate, after&#xD;
defraying his funeral expenses, and giving an annuity to&#xD;
his trusty servant, Jude.&#xD;
The estate could not be exactly appraised; it was&#xD;
thought that it could not fall short of as many English&#xD;
pounds as in our currency would amount to two hundred&#xD;
thousand dollars; and John Athol, a laboring man, was&#xD;
the only heir to all this property!&#xD;
The curious sensations which this event awakened were&#xD;
worthy of a graphic sketcher. The postman handed&#xD;
honest John the letter just. as he awoke at early dawn.&#xD;
His behavior was not unlike the wild excess of joy&#xD;
which a lunatic would manifest on some special breaking&#xD;
Qut of sunshine in his heart. He read the letter first to&#xD;
his wife. Her exclamation was characteristic of such&#xD;
&amp;amp; woman:&#xD;
" Well, John, we shall not be obliged to work any&#xD;
more, and can dress ourselves as well as the best of&#xD;
, ,,&#xD;
em.&#xD;
"Yes," said John; "and we can have a new house,&#xD;
and keep a carriage if we like, and have our servants,&#xD;
and eat all the luxuries in the market. Turkeys and'&#xD;
plum-puddings will make our daily dinners, instead of1,&#xD;
soup and mutton broth, and cheap vegetables And&#xD;
besides, we can travel all over the world. How kind it&#xD;
was hi uncle Peter 'thus. to remember us! We must pay&#xD;

&#xD;
our respects to his burial-place, and this, of course, will&#xD;
carry us abroad. But let us wake the children, and tell&#xD;
them of our good luck."&#xD;
Peter, Nancy, Susy and Tommy, were all old enough&#xD;
to know what money could do for them, and such a merry&#xD;
household as the news created was never before in John&#xD;
Athol's premises. Every oneof them immediately pro-&#xD;
ceeded to tell what they could now purchase, and how&#xD;
happy it would make them.&#xD;
"Now," said Susy, "we must not associate with the&#xD;
poor people around us. Having~wealth, gives us a new.&#xD;
standing in society, and when we move we will bestow&#xD;
some little presents upon the poor about us, just to keep&#xD;
them in good favor, and then we will leave them for-&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
"That's a lucky thought," replied the mother; "but&#xD;
would it not be best to conceal for the present our great&#xD;
~ea1th, until we can get some plans matured 'i"&#xD;
They all thought so, and agreed to keep the matter&#xD;
close.&#xD;
There was a heavy rap at the door. A whole company&#xD;
of the neigliliors were standing without to welcome and&#xD;
congratulate holiest John upon his good fortune. $~t~a&#xD;
few, however, hinted that "they hoped this sudden ise&#xD;
in the world would not turn their heads;" and an 91d&#xD;
farmer in the neighborhood suggested "it was always&#xD;
well to ask the Lord's blessing, that we be not led astray&#xD;
by the snares thus thrown in our way." Honest J6hn&#xD;
thanked him, but we fear forgot to put up the petition.&#xD;
Our friends will notice that what this worthy couple&#xD;
coveted rk~hes for, before they came, had never been&#xD;

* mentioned by them since, namely, the education of their&#xD;
children, helping the poor, and giving a lift to the aged&#xD;
parents. Susy, to be sure, had spoken of having a music~&#xD;
master, and buying a 2harp, because pianos were so com-&#xD;
mon; and reter said he should like to go through col-&#xD;
lege, if he could do so and not study. All seemed to&#xD;
have wishes very diiThrent from their former ones. The&#xD;
news ran like telegraphic despatches, that John Athol was&#xD;
a millionaire, gathering a growing sum in the mouth of&#xD;
each one who heralded it. The Athol family were&#xD;
nearly insane.&#xD;
Never were people before in such a dilemma! They&#xD;
began to be far more unhappy than ever before, and when&#xD;
the steamer brought a remittance of several thousands in&#xD;
specie, it was, on the whole, the most disquieted day the&#xD;
family had ever known. Stepping out from daily em-&#xD;
pioyinent, and looking upon such a store of .unco~inted&#xD;
gold, and then feeling such a restless desire to appmp~i..&#xD;
it in such a manner as to make themselves h~ppy,&#xD;
wa~ anything but agreeable to ltokers.~on. Singular as&#xD;
it~zuay appear, they began tQ be selfish in the very be..&#xD;
g~nxAiug; or rather they were so contract~ they had no&#xD;
vz'4~rd to supply anybody's wants but their own; and&#xD;
Eereiu lay the secret of feeling such disquietude. In-&#xD;
deed, so entirely had the family immured themselves in&#xD;
consultations at home, that they were not regretted, as&#xD;
they might have been, when they removed from their&#xD;
~heap, small tenement, to the granite house upon the hill.&#xD;
Qtwo~ however; fairly settled in great splendor in their&#xD;
z~ew abode, and the name of Athol glittering showily&#xD;
~pou i~e door, inquiries were at once commenced among&#xD;
&#xD;
46&#xD;
&#xD;
the neighbors as to who occupied the dwelling; and being&#xD;
told how they had suddenly risen from daily labor to be&#xD;
somebodyy," the wealthy old aristocrats' children, if&#xD;
not their sires, turned up their noses and laid a veto upon&#xD;
their acquaintance.&#xD;
The first winter, therefore, was passed in most "in-&#xD;
glorious ease." John .A.thol dressed in broadcloth and&#xD;
had nothing to do, and, more than all, he had no asso-&#xD;
ciates; for his former companions in toil he foolishly&#xD;
supposed would interfere with his dignity, by coming too&#xD;
closely in contact with him, and, to most of the old citi-&#xD;
zens, John had an ungainly appearance which broadcloth&#xD;
could not hide. His wife, too, was never so unhappy&#xD;
before. She kept a great supply of servants, and erro-&#xD;
neously concluded she could be thus relieved from all&#xD;
labor herself. In a very short time, however, she heard&#xD;
disagreement among the servants, and saw waste and&#xD;
destruction in larder, kitchen and. cellar; and sometimes,&#xD;
forgetting her wealth, she plunged into domestic matters&#xD;
as formerly, and somehow she confessed she felt much&#xD;
better than with her hands folded in the drawing-rooms.&#xD;
She supposedit was natural to her to work, but now she&#xD;
hid her labors from observation, lest it should not be creel-&#xD;
itable to her station.&#xD;
Jiut the children much more readily fell into the new&#xD;
mode of living. They soon learned what it was to be&#xD;
"fashionable;" but it evidently did not agree with their&#xD;
constitutions. They grew puny, wasp-waisted, and de-&#xD;
pendent. The* boys were in a fair~ way to be ruined!&#xD;
They aped the complete dandy w~e patent leather&#xD;

because they were out so late at nights. Evidently John&#xD;
Athol's family were depreciating; and before long he&#xD;
became aware of the fact, that money, invested in mere&#xD;
luxuries , dwarfed the better part Qf human nature..&#xD;
still there canie continual remittances, and Mr. Athol&#xD;
was now f6rcecl to consult with a broker as to investii~g&#xD;
it. Re bought stocks i~i newly-formed companies, in the&#xD;
e~pe~tanoy of doubling his property; but his schemes did&#xD;
not all work as he had promised himself; still there was&#xD;
a large margin wherein he could speculate. lit looked to&#xD;
John Athol like prairie grass to a northerner, when he&#xD;
has just left a stunted half-crop at home. Yet gradu..&#xD;
ally the money seemed to elude his grasp, and he soon&#xD;
found it was quite as much a task to~ learn to keep it as&#xD;
to earn it, and far more unsatisfactory. The children&#xD;
grew clamorous they grew dyspeptic, too, from want&#xD;
of exercise, and they grew impatient and unhappy from&#xD;
want of employment. The girls were in no fair way to&#xD;
keep thoir present position, ~or one was Iiirting ~with a&#xD;
profligate dandy, and the other was engaged to one who&#xD;
lived on ice-cre~nis ai~d drank sarsaparilla bitters, if&#xD;
nothing stronger and he had a character corresponding&#xD;
to his diet.&#xD;
John Athol and his wife began ti be alarmed about&#xD;
their children more than themselves. They therefore&#xD;
concluded to break up the city establishment in the&#xD;
8prg, and~ begin a new life. They concluded Upon a&#xD;
trip across the water, and all the fa~nily embarked for&#xD;
~urope. On the passatg~ there was a clergyman, with&#xD;

&#xD;
~U~5TAIWE A1~{D ~U4PQW8.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
whom they formed ~ decided intimacy. John told him&#xD;
all his former history. They had serious conversations&#xD;
by moonlight upon the deck of the vessel, and the rich&#xD;
man seemed troubled in mind. Sometimes he seemed to&#xD;
be impressed that he was not making a right use of his&#xD;
property, and he began to be afraid to give an account&#xD;
of his stewardship. No one could rise up and plead for&#xD;
him; no one could say they had been blessed by him,&#xD;
no widow's heart ever sang for joy because he remem-&#xD;
bered her "low estate." lie told his wife of bis&#xD;
wretched misgivings. ~he tried to comfort him, yet&#xD;
herself felt condemned. The children only laughed at&#xD;
their superstitious fears.&#xD;
There came a heavy storm upon them during their pas-&#xD;
sage. The captain looked out fearfully, and the pilot&#xD;
felt dismayed; the passengers were terror-stricken, and&#xD;
John Athol quivered like an aspen leaf; and begged the&#xD;
clergyman to pray for him. Money at this time seemed&#xD;
of little consequence; all they coveted was the enduring&#xD;
riches of an inheritance above.&#xD;
John made most solemn promises if his life should be&#xD;
spared; indeed, all his family seemed impressed while&#xD;
the danger impended; but when the storm ceased, the&#xD;
children forgot their resolutions, and frolicked as before.&#xD;
Not so did their parents.&#xD;
They were at length safely landed in England, and&#xD;
there John ~Athol engaged in a lucrative business, and&#xD;
again commenced an industrious career, taking his two&#xD;
boys under his immediate supervision, and allowing them&#xD;
only what was necessary for a respectable appearance,&#xD;
and obliging them to work for that. At first, they&#xD;

&#xD;
relncta~itly acceded, but finding little enjoyment in com-&#xD;
plete idleness, they soon were happy in their new occu-&#xD;
pations.&#xD;
Mrs. Athol attempted an amendment in the young&#xD;
ladies, and so far succeeded as to make them cheerfully&#xD;
surrender their foolish engagements; and, as in England,&#xD;
air and exercise are deemed so essential to strength of&#xD;
body and mind, they all fell into such "fashionable" and&#xD;
healthful habits, and, by slow degrees, they all learned&#xD;
the lux~Ury of doing good with their abundance; and the&#xD;
delightful letters just received in America, represent&#xD;
them in the most vigorous exercise of their powers, fully&#xD;
convinced that to "become rich" without a ballast of&#xD;
character proportionate to their weight, is always more&#xD;
likely to prove a snare than a blessing.&#xD;

THE BEST ROOMS.&#xD;
TuER~ is a kind of grim, staid air, whiGh always gath-&#xD;
ers around one on entering the spacious drawing-rooms&#xD;
which are devoted wholly to select visitors and *hshion-&#xD;
able parties. Who does not prefer the free and easy&#xD;
atmosphere of the basement or dining room, or the snug&#xD;
little nursery, where everything lies about carelessly,&#xD;
but not untidily 3 You can sit down in these places, ~nd&#xD;
feel you are a privileged guest; the stiff demeanor is&#xD;
thrown off, and the thoughts run in an easy channel, and&#xD;
you Thel at home.&#xD;
But the "best r~ms"in a city do not wear ~izeih a&#xD;
gloomy air as those select places in the country. Deliver&#xD;
me from the tomb-like, sombre appearance of the best&#xD;
parlor in a large wooden house, situated on some bleak&#xD;
hill, where the wind is keeping the ]Eolian harps in con-&#xD;
tinual play through the interstices between the window&#xD;
casements. Such a room is only opened on great occasions.&#xD;
Weddings are celebrated there, and so also are funerals.&#xD;
Once in a few weeks, in summer, invited guests are&#xD;
seated there a few hours previous to dinner or tea. if it&#xD;
is a very warm day, it may be a luxury to stop awhile&#xD;
in this apartment; for the flies rarely enter such a&#xD;
place. It is too cheerless for any living creature to vol-&#xD;

&#xD;
untarily make it a home, unless it be a company of&#xD;
spiders, and they weave strange network in ~uch places.&#xD;
It happened during the last summer months, a friend,&#xD;
who was distinguished for her uncommon neatness and&#xD;
keen observation whenever paint was discolored or&#xD;
slightly soiled, threw open the doors of her best par-&#xD;
lor to a party of city friends. Unluckily, a huge cob-&#xD;
weh~was displayed from the mirror to the ceiling, thence&#xD;
the fancy device ran obliquely to the mantel shelf; and&#xD;
as it arrested the attention of-one of the party, her eyes&#xD;
seemed riveted to the Spot. The hostess, observing it,&#xD;
proposed a walk in the garden, and, having rid her room&#xD;
of visitors, she lost no time in displacing the cobwebs.&#xD;
When they returned, however, the lady very ungallantly&#xD;
joked upon the removal of the web, and added, "I was&#xD;
so delighted to see such an appendage in your room, my&#xD;
dear friend, that I am amply repaid for the effort I made&#xD;
to visit you." This practical joke was not, however,&#xD;
pleasantly received, and it only serves to confirm the&#xD;
truth that joking upon facts is at all times quite a haz-&#xD;
ardous business.&#xD;
And there is "the parlor chamber" in the country!&#xD;
It has long, snowy-white curtains, deeply fringed, and&#xD;
looped on one side, while the closed blinds give it a sad,&#xD;
sickly hue; but a solemn air seems to gather about you&#xD;
even here. The mahogany bureau lo6ks darker. than in&#xD;
any other room; the bed presents an appearance of great&#xD;
comfort beneath its white exterior, but you feel a strange&#xD;
aversion to tumbling and rumpling it. It seems a fit&#xD;
couch for a fevered patient, who longs for a cool and still&#xD;
apartment, where the light of day is excluded. Such&#xD;
&#xD;
22&#xD;
&#xD;
28&#xD;
&#xD;
are the associations which gather around "best rooms!"&#xD;
0! I would infinitely prefer the more common-place, where&#xD;
the sun has free access, and people come in and go out&#xD;
cheerfully; where even the children play ball, and roll&#xD;
hoop, and blow soap-bubbles; for all these things indicate&#xD;
that life is within, and merry hearts make us love to live&#xD;
in their sunshine.&#xD;
Yet, what a strange idea have I broached against such&#xD;
parlors and chambers! Who does not furnish and keep&#xD;
such'? We hire a house or buy one. Forthwith we&#xD;
shut up a certain part of it, and reserve it only to open&#xD;
on great occasions. Woe to the child that ventures within&#xD;
one of these sanctums with his playthings! If he is&#xD;
dressed nicely, and his little feet are perfectly clean,&#xD;
when mamma has a fashionable call from a lady who is&#xD;
fond of children, little Tommy may go in and ask the&#xD;
lady "how her little Susy is." But if he touches the&#xD;
tassels upon that embroidered couch, or lifts up the cov~&#xD;
ering a bit to look at the pretty damask all concealed&#xD;
beneath, his mother tells him, "Tommy, dear, you may&#xD;
go into the nursery with Margaret, now. Mother don't~&#xD;
allow mischievous boys in this room." Poor child! how&#xD;
gladly he runs out of his prison, to where he can play&#xD;
unrestrained and run without fear! Tell me frankly,&#xD;
kind reader, do you love the restraints which these "best&#xD;
rooms" impose'?&#xD;

FANCY WORK.&#xD;
ThE young lady who spends most of her time in doing&#xD;
"fancy work," has a variety of complaints. What ca~~&#xD;
produce them ~ She lies in bed till she is called to&#xD;
breakfast, drinks a strong cup of Mocha, eats a roll, and&#xD;
sits to the fancy work! It is "so enchanting," she&#xD;
would just finish that bud, or draw the outline of that&#xD;
superb dahlia, before she dresses for dinner; but, hark!&#xD;
the bell rings, and. she took no note of time; father has&#xD;
come home, and Miss Paulina has her morning's work to&#xD;
show him. He praises it exceedingly, gives her a two&#xD;
dollar bill to expend in variegated worsted; declares he&#xD;
does not believe a girl in town is more industrious than&#xD;
she. But, somehow or other, she has little appetite for her&#xD;
dinner; she utterly discards meat; will take a thin slice&#xD;
of currant pudding, and finishes her dessert with a few&#xD;
nuts and raisins. She desires her mamma to purchase&#xD;
those "worsteds;" it will save her the trouble of going&#xD;
out. In a few weeks, a beautiful screen is produced, the&#xD;
work of Miss Paulina's own fingers! How it is shown,&#xD;
by her admiring parents, to numerous friends!&#xD;
This but goads on the young lady to undertake a set&#xD;
of chair-coverings, and a piano~.cloth, to match! In her&#xD;
~iind's eye, how splendidly they will look in her own&#xD;
&#xD;
parlor! for Paulina expects to be married at no distant&#xD;
day, when her lover returns from abroad. With this&#xD;
engagement, and the fancy work, she has little inclina-&#xD;
tion for society; when she takes a respite, it is to answer&#xD;
her beau's last letter, or to linger over those sentences&#xD;
which he penned on a foreign shore.&#xD;
Two or three coverings are completed, when the&#xD;
mother finds her daughter lounging upon the couch more&#xD;
frequently, and complaining of a pain in her chest, be-&#xD;
tween her shoulders, and in her side. She looks pale;&#xD;
and, as she gets no better, it is thought best to send for a&#xD;
physician. He comes, examines her pulse, looks at her&#xD;
tongue, thumps on her lungs, leaves a prescription, and&#xD;
goes away. But not so with the disease; a universal&#xD;
debility follows, and a cough succeeds. People speak of&#xD;
it as a case of consumption; but the parents are strangely&#xD;
blinded, and talk about Paulina's native constitution;&#xD;
that she never from infancy was sick a day before her&#xD;
cough is a cold; she must take a composition of some&#xD;
sort, which will remove it. The physician leaves a recipe;&#xD;
says little respecting his patient, but examines the lungs&#xD;
more frequently; and finally ends the chapter by telling&#xD;
her friends she had better take a journey to the Sulphur&#xD;
Springs. She does so, and is charmed with the effect.&#xD;
The scenery, and bracing air, and entire change, almost&#xD;
make her well before she reaches the Springs. The&#xD;
parents are joyous they knew Paulina had no serious&#xD;
disease; and, excepting a slight cough, and a little&#xD;
tendency to night-sweats, they cannot discover but she&#xD;
is perfectly well. Just to amuse a few dull hours, Pau~.&#xD;
lina took her fancy work.&#xD;

&#xD;
At the great hotel, filled with strangers and invalids,&#xD;
she cares not to make herself common. A girl whose&#xD;
affections are pledged to another, cares nothing for the&#xD;
mass of people about her. She drinks the water, bathes,&#xD;
eats at the public table, has a voracious appetite, and,&#xD;
although she looks like an invalid, her parents' do not&#xD;
believe her to be one. She spends a month with them,&#xD;
and returns home greatly invigorated, having completed&#xD;
three chair-coverings, and traced the outlines for the&#xD;
piano..cloth!&#xD;
The physician sees not so decided a change for the&#xD;
better as he hoped; but who wishes to communicate such&#xD;
intelligence to fond parents 3 Mr. Gill is daily expected&#xD;
in the packet ship at New York, and Paulina is on the&#xD;
tiptoe of expectation, and appears in her best humor to&#xD;
meet him. He arrives, but exclaims, "Heavens, Paulina!&#xD;
what have you been about 3 Why, you are as pale as a&#xD;
lily, and I left you the color of the rose."&#xD;
Mamma interposes, and details the child's illness; says&#xD;
she attributes a good deal of it to anxiety on his account,&#xD;
and quiets the lover with the assurance that she will soon&#xD;
1e well again. She does grow better; for she walks now,&#xD;
rides occasionally, and obeys more of the laws of nature,&#xD;
which she has too long defied. Mr. Gill does not seem&#xD;
pleased with the fancy work; has brought some home&#xD;
from Germany, f~r richer; and so Paulina throws by her&#xD;
worsteds, and bestows all her labor upon her mother, as a&#xD;
parting present. Keep it, fond mother; it was at the&#xD;
expense of a 'ruined constitution, those' buds and flowers&#xD;
were made! Those cypress leaves will have a peculiar&#xD;
significance soon ; - they should form the ohaplet which&#xD;
&#xD;
encircles the birth, age, and death of this young&#xD;
girl!&#xD;
But she marries, - a frail, delicate creature, constant-&#xD;
ly under the care of a physician, and a perpetual source&#xD;
of anxiety to her husband. Her cough is more and more&#xD;
troublesome, ~nd they are on the eve of starting to pass&#xD;
the winter in Charleston, S. C., when Mrs. Gill is seized&#xD;
with ~deeding at the lungs, and is utterly prostrated!&#xD;
Her physician only wonders the crisis has been delayed&#xD;
so long? The husband is distressed beyond measure;&#xD;
her mother is frantic, and all at once is awakened to the&#xD;
danger of the case. Now, what efforts are used - to&#xD;
produce recovery! Physicians of acknowledged celebrity&#xD;
are consulted; panaceas that have "never failed" do not&#xD;
reach the case. Nurses and skill may prolong the suf-&#xD;
ferer's life, but the termination will soon come. The&#xD;
announcement is made that Mrs. Gill is seized with&#xD;
another fit of bleeding, and, shortly after, that she. is&#xD;
dead! There is no post mortem examination, although&#xD;
the friends desire it; it is so clearly a plain case of con-&#xD;
sumption, that medical men ask for no testimony but that&#xD;
already furnished. 'There should, instead of a post mor-&#xD;
tem examination, have been a coroner's inquest, and it&#xD;
would have been clearly proved that the parents were&#xD;
guilty of murder, certainly in the second degree; and&#xD;
they should have been made to atone for such a crime as&#xD;
permitting a child to live without any regard to physical&#xD;
laws, and thns lay the foundation of incurable disease~&#xD;

&#xD;
upon the responsibilities of domestic life, has been s~~d-&#xD;
denly snatched from among us by the insatiate destroyer&#xD;
who spares no mark, however prized. Endowed by&#xD;
nature with a vigorous constitution, the insidious advances&#xD;
of the common enemy were not observed until he had&#xD;
sapped the citadel of life, and thus, in a few short months,&#xD;
the parents' pride, the husband's hope, the light of many&#xD;
a circle, has been snatched away, leaving a numerous&#xD;
band of mourners the reflection that all which friendship&#xD;
and skill could effect was promptly done;~ but, alas! they&#xD;
proved unavailing." This libel upon Provid~mce ought&#xD;
not to be borne! This natural effect of transgression,~&#xD;
which as surely followed disobedience, as wilful suicide,&#xD;
should not be ascribed to an inscrutable decree! If we&#xD;
thus sin ignorantly, it is all our own fault, and we justly&#xD;
deserve the penalty; since every school-book might teach&#xD;
us that exercise and air are indispensable to any tolerable&#xD;
measure of health, particularly in young females.&#xD;
Fancy work has been tl~e death of hundreds. Who&#xD;
can take any satisfaction in examining the nicest piece&#xD;
of elaborate workmanship, when the penalty paid for it&#xD;
was a spinal affection, or an aching side, or diseased&#xD;
lungs ~ A great religionist once exclaimed, as he looked&#xD;
upon such a piece of labor, "It is red with the blood of&#xD;
murdered time," alluding to the most conspicuous color&#xD;
in the embroidery. Rather would 'I call it suicidal&#xD;
murder, inflicted by known causes, for reasons unknown;&#xD;
for, after all, a yard of tapestry may be twice as beauti-&#xD;
ful as that upon which life has been sacrificed.&#xD;
]3y these remarks I would not be understood to discard&#xD;
the use of the needle, and instead thereof substitute street&#xD;
&#xD;
spinning! Far from it it is fancy work, that&#xD;
enchanting labor, which binds some fingers to the employ-&#xD;
ment, regardless of proper exercise, about which we&#xD;
declaim. There is no need of enforcing upon a female&#xD;
not to have so strict a watch over her hosiery and com-&#xD;
mon sewing. I never knew the health to fail by too&#xD;
close application to common work. Uow seldom is one&#xD;
obliged to be reproved for over-practising upon a piano!&#xD;
How few for mending, or remodelling, their own clothing!&#xD;
low few for attending to domestic affairs! It is only&#xD;
upon this useless, body-destroying, and, for aught I know,&#xD;
soul-destroying, fancy work, that I would pass the laws&#xD;
of condemnation. Believe me, when I add, I am acquainted&#xD;
with a young lady who ruined her health, some years&#xD;
since, by working a black lace veil!&#xD;

SUBSTANCE AND SHADOW.          81&#xD;
&#xD;
CHASING THE RAINBOW.&#xD;
THERE was a dark cloud in the western horizon. The&#xD;
low mutterings of distant thunder were heard, and a few&#xD;
drops of rain gave warning of a timely character to the&#xD;
loiterer unprotected in his way. And as that heavy&#xD;
cloud united with others, and assumed a still more ter-&#xD;
rific aspect, the lightning began to play upon the mag-&#xD;
netic wires, the wind with redoubled fury swept the&#xD;
foliage against the window-panes, and suddenly the rain&#xD;
fell in torrents. Now, the lately parched street was&#xD;
filled with foaming, rushing water, and pedestrians&#xD;
sought shelter in every nook that offered, and all the by-&#xD;
places were secured as a shelter against the untimely&#xD;
blast. The strife of the elements seemed maddened and&#xD;
fearful; man, in his lofty strength, felt his insecurity and&#xD;
inability to control the mandates of his Creator's will, and&#xD;
shrank like a child, to adore in silence that wordless&#xD;
voice which attested such almighty power. But look&#xD;
now,-the clouds have parted; a narrow strip of clear&#xD;
lAue sky is discernible, and a splendid rainbow is over-&#xD;
arching the heavens. Yon little urchin would fain&#xD;
take hold of its foot ~ for the rainbow seems to have set-&#xD;
tled down just back of yonder hill. He runs to~ find&#xD;
it~ termination; for he would examine the prismatic&#xD;
&#xD;
colors which are so blended together. He would find&#xD;
how they are commingled -would fain hold in his. tiny&#xD;
hand the blue, the violet, and the delicate shaded pink.;&#xD;
but, arrived at the hill, it seems still further onward,&#xD;
and its foot now rests as far beyond his present location,&#xD;
as when he first started. Chase the rainbow as far as he&#xD;
will, it is always terminated in the distance.&#xD;
The child cries over the delusion; he wonders of what&#xD;
and for what rainbows were made; they are emblematic&#xD;
of no promise to him; he wants a grasping reality.&#xD;
But is it the child only who chases the rainbow'? How&#xD;
many, who have started in life with the heavy cloud above&#xD;
them, have, as it parted and unfolded some magic colors,&#xD;
been allured by the dazzling brightness, and entered&#xD;
upon a vain pursuit to catch the illusion, and yet have&#xD;
always found it still further from their grasp! I would&#xD;
not that so many misguided travellers should rise before&#xD;
me; for that thunder-cloud ought to have left a salutary&#xD;
influence; those heavy rain-drops were designed to&#xD;
n~oisten the parched soil of the human affections, and that&#xD;
rainbow which followed was a sure pledge that the prom-&#xD;
ises thus awakened would be fulfilled - only we are too&#xD;
curious to examine the blended colors, which are the&#xD;
precursors of our future welfare.&#xD;
Yet, look out once more upon tiature when the tran-&#xD;
sient shower has subsided. That furious blast, which so&#xD;
curled and bent, and even prostrated, the delicate buds;&#xD;
that rain, which so washed the roots and made numberless&#xD;
little seams of earth as if lacerated to the very found~&#xD;
tion, has unsealed the bud, and, as we look, the flower&#xD;
is imperceptibly but beautifully opening to our gaze;&#xD;

SUBSTANOB AND SHADOWS.&#xD;
the drooping tendrils again rise with renewed strength;&#xD;
the bright sun kisses off the pearly drops that stood upon&#xD;
leaf' and tender limb, and the beautiful reflection of the&#xD;
rainbow tinges this once fearful shower with a beauty&#xD;
worth the skill of the heavenly Architect.&#xD;
Just so in daily life the discipline* of dark clouds is&#xD;
only an augury of bright manifestations in the distance;&#xD;
our tears are but the fertilizing of dry and dusty, spots&#xD;
which needed their genial influences, and the rainbow is&#xD;
but the light of our Father's countenance, to illumine the&#xD;
eye of faith with the tokens of hi~ love.&#xD;

TJMJDJTY&#xD;
TUE feeling of timidity, which sometimes embarrasses&#xD;
us in the presence of our superiors, often makes us unjust&#xD;
to ourselves. Our timidity drives our senses out of us.&#xD;
We are ashamed of our bashfulness, and this conscious&#xD;
ness makes us awkward in our attempts to overcome it.&#xD;
We have a friend who is very loquacious, and always&#xD;
talks to the purpose, save in the presence of one man;&#xD;
and before him he never uttered a sentence worth repeat..&#xD;
ing. We were forcibly struck with the same kind of&#xD;
reserve which llazlitt describes in a visit he paid to&#xD;
Coleridge&#xD;
The thought of the meeting had worn heavily upon&#xD;
him, for he seemed to disparage his own powers~ and&#xD;
magnify his friend's. After the small-talk incident to&#xD;
meeting was discussed, Hazlitt undertook to give Cole-&#xD;
ridge an account of some thoughts he had written "On&#xD;
the Natural Disinterestedness of the Human Mind."&#xD;
"But," said he, "I failed.~ and', after I had tried for&#xD;
the twentieth time, I got some new pens and paper, and&#xD;
determined to make clear work of it. I wrote a few&#xD;
meagre sentences in the skeleton style of a mathematical&#xD;
demonstration; but I was forced to stop when half way&#xD;
down the second page, for I tried in vain to pump&#xD;

words, images, notions, apprehensions, fancies, and facts,&#xD;

and concluded by shedding a few tears of despondency on&#xD;
the blank, unfinished paper. I can write better now!&#xD;
Am I better than I was then ~ 0, no! my timidity has&#xD;
left me."&#xD;
Great minds undoubtedly feel distanced as well as&#xD;
attracted by each other. Only weak heads with shallow&#xD;
brains will chatter on regardless of their superiors. But&#xD;
we* are fast, as a mass, getting out of this bashfulness.&#xD;
We are running too far at random, reckless of what peo-&#xD;
ple think or say of us. Hence, possessed of one idea, we&#xD;
carry it about with us, and throw it in everybody's face;&#xD;
we write with lightning speed, and the thoughts are&#xD;
scorching, and show only the~ wildness of the brain.&#xD;
Such people know not the definition of tirni~lity, and we&#xD;
question whether, in the progress of the nineteenth cen-&#xD;
tury, the word, if used at all, will not be found in our&#xD;
dictionaries with a parenthesis, marked (obsolete).&#xD;

THE HOLIDAY WAL1~.&#xD;
WOULD that everybody were happy about these fes..&#xD;
tival days! We would iron out the wrinkles from the&#xD;
careworn brow, and put a jubilant tone into the speech&#xD;
of those who are brooding over "memories of the past,"&#xD;
and show every gloomy countenance how it may be irra-&#xD;
diated by a cheerful smile in the contemplation of9&#xD;
the blessings which, although withdrawn, were continued&#xD;
so long and gave so much of zest to former days. But&#xD;
we must remind such that they must look out from~ tkem.~&#xD;
selves; and if they will put~ on their winter garments&#xD;
and go with me into the crowded thoroughfares of our&#xD;
great metropolis, where at every other step they will see&#xD;
the inviting placards, "Christmas and New-Year Gifts&#xD;
at reduced prices," "Dry Goods at cost," "California&#xD;
outdone," "Secure your bargains here," &amp;amp;c., just as we&#xD;
happen to stop at the window of a toy-shop we shall be&#xD;
sure to find Mr. Jones, or Smith, or Brown, who has&#xD;
taken his wife and their two little precocities into this&#xD;
very shop, to select their holiday presents. The parents&#xD;
of these children have concluded it is best that "Sammy&#xD;
and Tommy" shall make their own selections this year.&#xD;
It will throw them more on their own resources, help&#xD;
them develop their immature judgment, and, in short,&#xD;

make ~them more manly. Now the spectator would&#xD;
judge there is little need of that conclusion1 for they&#xD;
both are dressed in small-clothes with knee-buckles, wear&#xD;
tiny beaver hats, and carry walking-sticks, which they&#xD;
flourish with more of an air than "Grandpa." Besides,&#xD;
the little fellows know enough of the definition of words&#xD;
to tell you the different meanings of "I will" and "I&#xD;
won't," as they are selecting their holiday presents.&#xD;
"Mamma" has stood this half hour trying to persuade&#xD;
"Sammy" to take a little box entitled "The Wonders of&#xD;
Creation in a Nut-shell;" but he has seen a drum, with&#xD;
the two sticks attached to its sides, and master Tommy.&#xD;
is blowing a miniature fife, and five and seven years are&#xD;
not insensible to martial music, and th\ey are resolved to&#xD;
secure these noisy playthings, and act the part of soldiers;&#xD;
for Biddy has promised to make them each a paper cap&#xD;
and put a red feather in it. Well, they have carried the&#xD;
day, and the purchases are made.&#xD;
Just at the further end of the same counter little&#xD;
"Susy" is selecting a big doll. "No, she don't want any&#xD;
other but that ;" although mother thinks five dollars is a&#xD;
great sum. to pay for a miniature baby, when so many&#xD;
real, living foundlings are set down at our doors for&#xD;
nothing. Watch a moment.&#xD;
"Susy" has secured her treasure, and it i~ laid in a&#xD;
bit of a trundle-bed, and her little eyes sparkle with&#xD;
delight, and she jumps and capers and tosses up the baby,&#xD;
and imitates the exact movements of the nursery-maid&#xD;
at home. All this is very pretty for sport in both in-&#xD;

that they cannot be restrained from fighting either ''to&#xD;
conquer or die;" and should they be united to the little&#xD;

womanhood, and tosses a real, live baby, that crows and&#xD;
cries and wants to put his fingers in the gas light, the&#xD;
glorious fun which .the purchasers to-day have~ made,&#xD;
causing them to be so gay and happy, will settle off in&#xD;
a monotone, and they will talk plaintively together about&#xD;
separating, perhaps forever, if slain upon the battle&#xD;
field! So, after all, we see there is a responsibility&#xD;
attached even to a holiday present. By these. very gifts&#xD;
we may lay the foundation of a ferocious spirit, or sow&#xD;
the seeds of a proud and vain superciliousness, which&#xD;
may flower in after years, when you can never eradicate&#xD;

THE HYDROPATHIST.&#xD;
Wu~ not be a fish, and swim all the time in your&#xD;
native element ~I Why dart out from the aquatic tub to&#xD;
be placed between feather beds, encased in wet sheets,&#xD;
and thus sweat out thy existence contrary to the law of&#xD;
old, "by the sweat of thy brow thou shalt earn thy&#xD;
1~read"? IDo not become a monomaniac upon one idea.&#xD;
Bathing is good, -daily ablution is refreshing, invigor-&#xD;
ating, cleansing, purifying; but, like all good things,&#xD;
it may be perverted. Cold water is not the panacea&#xD;
for every ailment and ill in life; a wet jacket will not&#xD;
always 'ward olY every attack. But let us not quarrel&#xD;
about this liquid element, water. It is to be highly&#xD;
prized, - we will admit all its excellences; but, in doing&#xD;
so, we would not overlook other bountiful provisions of&#xD;
nature, by which both the outer and inner man is made&#xD;
a worthy temple for the human soul. An exclusive&#xD;
medicine, like an exclusive thought, is very apt to de-&#xD;
range all the natural functions. You have lost flesh,&#xD;
but you have the cleanly, wholesome appearance of a&#xD;
duck. You have wasted your system by injudiciously&#xD;
applying this element. Some have broken down, by&#xD;
thus doing violence to constitutional laws. Yet you still&#xD;
persist in this daily practice; its use occupies all your&#xD;
&#xD;
thoughts; your medicine has become your daily&#xD;
thought; and when this is the case, it is the more doubt-&#xD;
ful whether the malady will leave you. Cheerful occu-&#xD;
pation for the mind has done more toward recovery of&#xD;
the body than all other remedies put together. Again.&#xD;
I caution you, use, but do not abuse, this kindly elemezit.&#xD;
A duck with the mind of a man would be a natural&#xD;
phenomenon. Be a hydropathist if you will, but for&#xD;
humanity's sake do not ally yourself with any other&#xD;
species but that God intended for you.&#xD;
Look at the canary in your window; watch his habits.&#xD;
Early in the morning he dips his wings, and flutters&#xD;
about in his tiny pond; but no sooner has he done so,&#xD;
than he rises to the top of his cage, and begins to carol&#xD;
forth his song. He is not again in the element rioting&#xD;
in excess. Learn of the bird to be cleanly, but like ~im&#xD;
plumethy wings for an upward flight.&#xD;

THE WIFE O~N THE HOMESTEAD.&#xD;
THERE are few positions in life more trying than the&#xD;
situation of a daughter-in-law; particularly if she be&#xD;
doomed to reside with the "old folks," and a variety of&#xD;
brothers and sisters, who are all pledged to their own&#xD;
ways, and feel infallible in their judgment upon others.&#xD;
We are all frail; but the covering with which we shield.&#xD;
the faults of our own kindred seems to be cast aside in&#xD;
this new relationship. "Richard" never does an im-&#xD;
proper thing; but if "Mary" has purchased a rich&#xD;
shawl, or has treated herself to a new silk dress, and&#xD;
appears out fresh and neat, without a previous consulta-&#xD;
tion, what a whispering and wondering, perhaps what a&#xD;
jealous and envying disposition is manifested! The old&#xD;
lady says, "she never brought up..her girls to such ex-&#xD;
travagance. Ilitty never owned a nice silk ~n her life,&#xD;
but she earned it in keeping school; ~nd Sarah Ann has&#xD;
never 'afforded herself a silk cloak. Now, to have such&#xD;
an interloper come right in upon us, and set such fash-&#xD;
ions, is quite too much for me. Besides, it will fail&#xD;
Richard, poor boy, who has always kept his money in&#xD;
such a snug way." But stop, my good friend; Mary&#xD;
brought to your son some thousands, and has more in&#xD;
expectancy; or she is a sweet-tempered lady, and such&#xD;
conduct will Badly grieve her.&#xD;
&#xD;
Then woe to the ~young wife if they live in common I&#xD;
The veriest trifles are often magnified, and the happiness&#xD;
of a family is often marred by the addition of a single&#xD;
extra egg in the pudding' or a disposition to make a little&#xD;
tasteful arrangement upon the table, even with her own&#xD;
purchased articles. In this case, it is said, "modern&#xD;
upstarts wish to begin where their fathers left oft: The&#xD;
country is all tending to pauperism, an4 there is no such&#xD;
thing as economy practiced now-a-days."&#xD;
But the trials are not all told ; indeed, no pen could.&#xD;
portray all the petty vexations with which some young&#xD;
housekeepers are assailed. A few friends to tea, a light&#xD;
entertainment for the evening, a few extra lamps, an&#xD;
accompaniment to the piano as the finale piece, how it&#xD;
grates and jars on the ears of the old people in the sitting-.&#xD;
room! There may have been performers on flutes and&#xD;
tamborines; solos and duets may have been sung for years&#xD;
by their own daughters, without a word of complaint;&#xD;
but the scene is changed now! These modern wives&#xD;
have friends with whom they correspond, and sometimes&#xD;
they do not feel as if their time is entirely thrown away&#xD;
if they attend to some literary pursuits, read a valna.&#xD;
ble book, or even glance over the contents of the daily&#xD;
journal. But to encounter the imputation of "~saunt~&#xD;
ing away one's time," or being charged with "being&#xD;
indifferent to the interests of~ a husband," because one is&#xD;
sometimes out of the treadmill, is, indeed, a hard lot.&#xD;
And to fail in well-meant efforts, to have a wrong con-&#xD;
struction placed upon all one's actions, to be watched,&#xD;
questioned, bored and fretted at, why, it would destroy&#xD;
the serenity of an angel. But worse than all is to have&#xD;

quarters; board at some third-rate hotel is preferable,&#xD;

you will not be troubled many months with a cheerful&#xD;

cause; the family will never think her much ill; the&#xD;
advice of a physician will be deemed unnecessary; and,&#xD;
erelong, she, the light~-hearted, rosy-cheeked wife, will&#xD;
slowly decay, like the damask rose with a worm at its&#xD;

This is not all a fancy sketch. Thousands have&#xD;
endured similar trials, and if they have survived them,&#xD;

fatal diseases have followed in the train of blighted&#xD;

A CHAPTER ON CORNS.&#xD;
Wao ever wrote out a pain? What word can express&#xD;
the swinging, indefinable sensation, which arises from the&#xD;
small protuberance called a corn? Yet how few re-&#xD;
gard such an irritation, that literally makes you so mis-&#xD;
erable and unhappy! True, you apply a plaster when&#xD;
your patience is worn out, or you wrap the aching&#xD;
excrescence in emolient, or bathe it in cold water; but&#xD;
who ever thinks of commiserating with one who has&#xD;
only a corn? A fever may bring more debility with&#xD;
it, but not half so much pain; a disease which calls for&#xD;
medical aid may excite more alarm, but is not so trying&#xD;
as a corn. Did you ever take a walk in the country&#xD;
when the windows of heaven had been shut up some&#xD;
days, and, after you had broiled an hour in the sun,&#xD;
attempt to remove the tighf shoe which encased your&#xD;
corn? Could you ever describe the sensation? Did&#xD;
you ever put on a new pair of boots, and set off in a car&#xD;
or coach, where you were confined all day without rem-&#xD;
edy, and not suffer more distress than language could&#xD;
describe?&#xD;
I appeal to the great brotherhood of humanity, for&#xD;
they are legions, who know by experience that I have.&#xD;

But the foot must be dressed neatly. One must have&#xD;
a good fit, and that means a snug one; consequently we&#xD;
go limping through the world with a distorted coun-&#xD;
tenance, and walk as if treading on precious gems,&#xD;
simply because our feet are scoured. How we welcome&#xD;
the sight of our best friend, an old shoe! How gladly&#xD;
we raise the aching iix~t to another chair, and feel how&#xD;
comfortable is solitary confinement, if we are only at&#xD;
ease! Whence come these afflictive evils ~-. what pro-&#xD;
duces them? "Tight shoes, tight boots," is again and&#xD;
again reiterated. You tell your shoemaker these troubles;&#xD;
he measures you, gives plentiful allowance to ease; but,&#xD;
alas! a woful twinge gives you warning that he has mis-&#xD;
understood the ease. You grow despairing, threaten to cut&#xD;
a slit in the side.Qf the new boot or. shoe, when along&#xD;
comes the newspaper. The advertisement headed "Corns&#xD;
Cured" has more interest to you than 4he Gomprornise&#xD;
Bill. The corn can be extracted for the trifling sum of&#xD;
one dollar! The coin in the desk drawer is drawn out most&#xD;
cheerfully, and you are soon on your way to submit to&#xD;
amputation. Some one in the crowded street treads on&#xD;
you, and your corn is touched in the most sensitive part,&#xD;
SQ that you literally cry out. You arrive at the surgeon's.&#xD;
He looks at the cause of all your nervous agitation, and&#xD;
tells you he can directly relieve you. You throw down&#xD;
the dollar; without much ado he extracts the corn, and&#xD;
you are a happy being. Life seems all sunshine; you fit&#xD;
out in French boots and 'narrow-toed shoes, and patent&#xD;
shining leather pumps, and really dance on, where 'before&#xD;
you only limped.&#xD;
Thit did ever an ecstatic joy last long? All at once,&#xD;
&#xD;
in a hot dog-day, you feel another twinge. There is no&#xD;
mistake in the feeling; a new corn is springing up just&#xD;
where the old one was taken out. You feel that you have&#xD;
been humbugged - go to your doctor with the perspira-&#xD;
tion on your brow, and demand the reason of this sensa-&#xD;
tion? He tells you, "My dear sare, for one dollar I&#xD;
relieve you. You treat your toe like well person, whereas&#xD;
it be in val id." You swing open the door and return,&#xD;
wisely concluding if you are always to wear moccasins&#xD;
and loose slippers, you will help him to no more amputa-&#xD;
tions. In a few days he calls on you to inquire, "1f&#xD;
sare, you object to append your name to von certificate,&#xD;
that you were entirely cured by mine agency?" How&#xD;
lucky it is we were taught lessons of good breeding!&#xD;
How fortunate that we call it "vulgar and low" to kick&#xD;
over a dumb animal, much more a contemptible quack!&#xD;
There are ills we are born to bear, and corns come&#xD;
under this' catalogue. We cannot tread firmly, and we&#xD;
need not expect it; we cannot feel easy, and we need not&#xD;
covet it, only when in a dark evening, or about our own&#xD;
home, we find the old slippers and give ourselves to free&#xD;
and easy treatment.&#xD;
We read that St. Paul says, "a thorn was given him&#xD;
in the flesh." Commentators are divided as to what the&#xD;
annoyance was; but who can doubt but it was a cqrlz.?&#xD;

PLEASURE-SEE KING.&#xD;
TRuNws and bandboxes were never in greater requi-&#xD;
sition than at the present time. Look at the coach at&#xD;
the door of your opposite neighbor. See the vast quan-&#xD;
tity of baggage that is to be piled on behind, beside the&#xD;
carpet-bags and valises under the driver's feet, and the&#xD;
innumerable smaller boxes, and sunshades, and umbrel-&#xD;
las, that are to ride inside. We have often pondered&#xD;
upon the show the contents of such an outfit would make,&#xD;
displayed to the eye of the multitude; What bachelor&#xD;
would ever again think of marrying, after having wit-&#xD;
nessed it? We are now speaking of the mere sight.~&#xD;
seeing and pleasure-travelling public. They are starting,&#xD;
they scarcely know where; they expect to touch at fash..&#xD;
jonable resorts, to rest in quiet country inns, to see life&#xD;
as it is, life as it should be, and life as we make it. All&#xD;
these places require a great variety of apparel, adapted&#xD;
to climate, situation, and the company to be met. So&#xD;
"madam" must take her brocades, lest it become too&#xD;
cool for her lighter fabrics; but the "tissues" must not&#xD;
be omitted, because in some places there is a great display&#xD;
of fancy dresses even .among the mammass," on account&#xD;
of the daughters. Then the rigging for the head the&#xD;
t~Iso fro3its, or half or whole wigs, fresh from the&#xD;
&#xD;
dresser's shop, all perfumed with bergamot; the tasteful&#xD;
head-dresses of ribbon, and lace and flowers; the nicely-&#xD;
flounced skirts, over which laundry maids have so copi-&#xD;
ously perspired, and quit their places; the network&#xD;
hosiery of the choicest silk, which has been whitened&#xD;
around black bottles for the occasion. Why, the legions&#xD;
of articles, which help compose the contents of trunks&#xD;
and bandboxes, who can enumerate half of them, all&#xD;
compressed tightly together, but so carefully wedged as&#xD;
not to wrinkle or tumble each other? Then there are the&#xD;
smaller trunk and little valise, belonging, as the girls&#xD;
say, to "father." These contain shirt-bosoms, stiff and&#xD;
shiny as new pieces of tin ware, dickeys made to wear,&#xD;
without wilting, the hottest of dog-days; perchance a&#xD;
light gossamer wig, or an extra "scratch," to cover&#xD;
the old gentleman's bald head, or a half-dozen cravats&#xD;
that the young ladies can tie into a Brobdignagian style;&#xD;
added to which is a cumbrous suit of new broadcloth,&#xD;
and a case of the nicest cigars.&#xD;
But we are told that this starting off is in consequence&#xD;
of the poor health of the young ladies. And don't they&#xD;
look puny, low-spirited and dyspeptic, only as the present&#xD;
excitement; has got up a little glow? Ten chances to one&#xD;
they are out this very minute, while their. trunk is being&#xD;
packed, buying "Eva's Parting," or the very last fask~~&#xD;
ionable music, and a small cargo of confectionery to con-&#xD;
sume ~t odd times. And have n't they a big trunk of&#xD;
dresses and flounced under-dresses, of which they alone&#xD;
know the uses and names? Mark it, hQw feeble they&#xD;
are! Is a walk proposed by the father or mother? "0&#xD;
dear, do let us have a carriage!" is the exclamation of&#xD;

the youngest. Then They talk upon side-aches, and doc-&#xD;
tor's prescriptions, and wish they c9uld rid themselves&#xD;
of nervous complaints; but they are too feeble to ride&#xD;
on horseback; they have no appetites for anything save&#xD;
ice-creams and syllabubs; consequently, they move on&#xD;
from the country inn to more fashionable quarters; and,&#xD;
after travelling the six weeks in dog-days, come home,&#xD;
little refreshed, to talk about winding up with a "Euro-&#xD;
pean tour." The truth is, had they left those cumbrous&#xD;
trunks and bandbbxes at home, and travelled for comfort&#xD;
merely, they would have found what they sought.&#xD;
Now take a peep at Mrs. Bogg's prospects. She has&#xD;
been directed to change the scene, - to seek variety as&#xD;
a restorative to "weakened nerves and general debility."&#xD;
No sooner does she receive the prescription, than up&#xD;
comes the inquiry, "What shall I want to wear 3"&#xD;
The dressmaker is sent for; her work is slackened, and&#xD;
here is a good customer. She recommends foulards,&#xD;
silk bareges, light, graceful mantillas, and all the para-&#xD;
phernalia which a young bride would desire on her wed-&#xD;
~~ng tour. From inability to leave her chamber to&#xD;
attend to any domestic avocations, she places herself in a&#xD;
carriage, drives to our most splendid dry. goods establish-&#xD;
ments, orders ~the most unique and expensive articles,&#xD;
slowly concludes which color will best become her lily&#xD;
cheeks, and finally orders a large parcel for the aforesaid&#xD;
dressmaker to select from. A fortnight, by day and&#xD;
night, is spent by seamstresses to array the invalid Mrs.&#xD;
Bogg for this journey for health! When she finally&#xD;
starts oft; she is only sustained upon "Sarsaparilla hit-&#xD;

the tone of the system."&#xD;
Why did she not put on her travelling habit,: take a&#xD;
few useful articles of dress from her. full closet, have&#xD;
them packed in one trunk. or a large carpet-bag, and&#xD;
thus derive some benefit from her journey 'I Need we&#xD;
wonder that so many invalids return home no better~'&#xD;
than they left it T~ So long as they are slaves to fashion,&#xD;
and content to forego all the pleasurable benefits which&#xD;
a journey in a rational way might produce, so long will&#xD;
they talk about going "South" in the winter, and&#xD;
hardly keep soul and body together at the " North" in&#xD;
the summer.&#xD;
Now, it is the contents of those big trunks and. band-&#xD;
boxes that work all the mischief. They cost a vast deal&#xD;
more than the two-dollar-a-day hotels; but the indulgent&#xD;
husband or affectionate father very cheerfully toils on to&#xD;
~ay the semi-yearly bills, and makes no complaints, save&#xD;
"at the ruinous state of the times and the extravagant&#xD;
follies of people in general."&#xD;
We go for a good appearance abroad as at home -for&#xD;
a "genteel outfit," if you term it, when among strangers;&#xD;
but neither the weak, nor the lazy or fashionable, will&#xD;
ever realize the full enjoyment to be derived from change&#xD;
of scene and air, until they rise above all foolish rivalry&#xD;
in dress and gewgaws. Half the day spent in bedecking&#xD;
one's self for dinner, and the other half in preparing for&#xD;
a " hop" in the evening, never created any more self-&#xD;
respect on account of the labor. A whirl-about in dog-&#xD;

AN AGREEABLE COMPANION.&#xD;
Wn are often wearied with a great talker, but never&#xD;
with an agreeable companion. How eagerly the society&#xD;
of an agreeable friend is sought! How welcome they a~re&#xD;
on a journey, in a sick-room, or at home! Life assumes&#xD;
a very different aspect when we live in such a genial&#xD;
atmosphere. We are never tired of living, because there&#xD;
is a charm, a spell, that binds us to that fellow-being.&#xD;
Look at the opposite character, a disagreeable person,&#xD;
and you will understand my meaning. This is one&#xD;
whose daguerreotype is more easily taken,- and may we&#xD;
not fear the reason is, because the likeness is more com-&#xD;
mon~ - a fretful being, who never sees a ray of sunshine&#xD;
but a cloud all the darker follows it; one who enter-&#xD;
tains her friends with descriptions of petty grievances in&#xD;
her children, or who inveighs against her "help," who&#xD;
are always rude and unaccommodating; and who inflicts&#xD;
all yesterday's conversation with Bridget the cook, or&#xD;
Nancy the chambermaid, upon you, and is sure to nar-&#xD;
rate what "she said," and "1 said to her." Such a&#xD;
person is severely trying, and more than once have I&#xD;
heard one and another remark, "0, we won't call there;&#xD;
Mrs. - is so tedious about her family affairs!"&#xD;
An agreeable person never holds up the faults of her&#xD;

whom we are conversing, may suggest, whereby mutual&#xD;
benefit may be conferred. Perhaps we have need again&#xD;
to cite the remark, the most agreeable are not of necessity&#xD;
the most loquacious. Dr. Johnson once said, he knew&#xD;

quoted, and perhaps, in another square, some comments&#xD;
are made on "money and business;" and, having read&#xD;
these, he looks at the "Telegraphic" head, to learn how&#xD;
the New York market stands -what is said about "cot-&#xD;
ton," and other things, which materially affect his invest-&#xD;
ments. If the "times" look favorable, that gouty old&#xD;
toe pains him less; if squally, woe to the household&#xD;
where he reigns supreme! Nothing goes right with him&#xD;
when monetary affairs go wrong: "Women must curtail;&#xD;
it's of no use to spend so much in finery; one silk dress&#xD;

pay so much wages." "But, who will rub your foot,&#xD;
grandpa?" asks his little, smiling grand-daughter. "I'll&#xD;
rub it myself~" he answers gruffly, "before I 'II come to&#xD;
nothing by extravagant help." All this comes from&#xD;
reading those little items mentioned above. his family&#xD;

5UTANCF~ AND SHADOWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, I contend, much of our happiness, reason as we&#xD;
will about it, depends on money.&#xD;
It is vain to enumerate what it will procure. ThQ&#xD;
richest land, the best house, the most elegant furniture,&#xD;
the finest span of horses, the neatest vehicle, the best of&#xD;
~attendants, the gayest troop of friends, the choicest old&#xD;
wines, the rarest London porter, the first box of straw&#xD;
berries, the finest salmon in the market, cucumbers in&#xD;
March, peas in April, beans the first day of May! If&#xD;
you are sick, it will make a most attentive physician, who&#xD;
will call in a "consulting" brother, at the sight of the&#xD;
most remote danger; it will make a person stand over&#xD;
you the longest night, and perform any kind of office. If&#xD;
you are asthmatic, it will prop up pillows behind you; if&#xD;
feverish) it will change your mattresses daily; if desirous&#xD;
of pleasant sights, it will command the most splendid&#xD;
bouquet, and make Hamburg grapes as plenty as hail..&#xD;
stones. If you are lonely, it will bring you a choice&#xD;
companion for the hour, week, month, or life even. If&#xD;
you are old, it will induce a pretty little girl of seventeen&#xD;
to marry you. If you are desirous of travelling, it will&#xD;
procure you the best berth in the steamship, and most re-&#xD;
markable attention during the passage, and whenever&#xD;
you land. It will give you the best pew in the church,&#xD;
and the most commanding influence in the congregation.&#xD;
All the weekly and daily journals can lie on your table,&#xD;
and you can make even an editor happy by your sub~&#xD;
scription, if he chances to be proprietor of the paper!&#xD;
Now, who undervalues this great good 3 Why, the&#xD;
clergyman says, "It won't give you the keys to a&#xD;
heavenly inheritance ;" and Aunt Judith says, "Your&#xD;

money perishes with you." But all this admits of&#xD;
qualification. If you have opened your hearts to objects&#xD;
of benevolence, if; in your life and in your will, you have&#xD;

who shall say that heavenly treasures have not been pro-&#xD;
cured by the wise use of money 3&#xD;
Ay, in your life, that is the better way, appropriate&#xD;
some of those accumulating dividends, which so harass&#xD;
your daydreams, and cai.ise you to toss so uneasily at&#xD;
night, lest you should not reinvest them in a productive&#xD;
channel. Make somebody or something your favorite&#xD;

COMING EVENTS.&#xD;
THE habit of brooding over a coming event is not&#xD;
preparation to meet it. The faithful performance of to-&#xD;
day's duty is the truest test that we shall best meet to-&#xD;
morrow's trial. Some are forever living in the future;&#xD;
but this clearly is not the design of our heavenly&#xD;
Father. Else why are we so completely shut out from&#xD;
forthcoming misfortunes 3 Why no certain assurances&#xD;
that contemplated happiness will ever arrive 3 Plainly,&#xD;
because it isbest it should be so. And herein God h~s&#xD;
made all alike, both high and low, subject to the same&#xD;
contingencies. The care he exerts over the beggar is the&#xD;
same as over the monarch - and this teaches us the&#xD;
emptiness of earthly honors.&#xD;
The fear of death keeps some in perpetual bondage.&#xD;
Now, an event that our Creator has made certain, but&#xD;
indefinite as to time, was not designed to keep us in con~&#xD;
tinual servitude. I have duties to perform; family and&#xD;
social engagements to meet; business wants to be at-&#xD;
tended to, and daily employment upon which my physical&#xD;
life depends. I need all the vigor of constitution, all the&#xD;
exercise of mental power, to meet these cares. My time&#xD;
cannot be frittered away in random fancies upon calcu-&#xD;
lating chances. I must work! and if my time has come&#xD;
&#xD;
that I must lie down and die, have I not made better prep-&#xD;
aration, by this discharge of present duty, for the retri-&#xD;
bution which awaits me 3&#xD;
But there is a preparation. Yery true, but it is living&#xD;
as if under the eye of a kind Parent, looking to him for&#xD;
daily strength, and then pressing on to labor. I am to&#xD;
be wise; - the necessary knowledge of my physical&#xD;
frame will induce me to be temperate, and not per-&#xD;
vert my powers; and if, by what we call accident, we are&#xD;
suddenly removed, or linger out in a fitful fever, all is&#xD;
well God has thus ordained the event -it came in&#xD;
the, right time and place, because it was his ordination.&#xD;
A little child visited its mother's tomb. It had been&#xD;
told.her that her mother lay in a sweet sleep. Thinking&#xD;
it could wake her, it shouted in its tiny voice, "Mother,&#xD;
der mother, let me into your little room. Call me,&#xD;
mother; I would be with youj; it is so cold and stormy&#xD;
here, and so quiet and warm in your little room. Do,&#xD;
mother, let me in. Once you took my little hand and&#xD;
held it fast. Take me again as you did once. They tell&#xD;
me you cannot hear but where is heaven ~ Here is&#xD;
my mother."&#xD;
An aged woman sat by the same tomb, and wept. "My&#xD;
daughter," said she, "how I wish I were quiet and happy&#xD;
like thee; thou art pure as an angel, and art gone to&#xD;
dwell with them. But I fear to enter the dark portals,&#xD;
lest my spirit should b~e separated from thine; for, alas! I&#xD;
have not lived like thee."&#xD;
We should live so that the grave our Redemer has&#xD;
hallowed should appear as the gate to Eternal Mansions.&#xD;

MONDAY MORNING.&#xD;
MONDAY morning! The most trying dawn of all the&#xD;
week! The quiet Sabbath has just passed, and a new&#xD;
week of vexations has commenced. It is washing-day!&#xD;
The cook is cross; the chamber-maid has a beau who&#xD;
keeps late hours, and discontent sits upon her brow on&#xD;
Monday. John, the eldest boy, says he feels ill, and&#xD;
does not care to go to school. This frets Emma, the lit-&#xD;
tle girl, who thinks, if Johnny is allowedd to stay at home,&#xD;
she may as well have the headache, and stay too. The&#xD;
breakfast dishes are all on the table, unwashed, and Alice&#xD;
says it is none of her work to clean them, and Phebe&#xD;
say~ that chamber-girls never do it in "genteel families."&#xD;
A quarrel ensues; the washing gets behindhand, and&#xD;
the mistress perceives, just as she steps below to give&#xD;
orders for dinner, that she must encounter wry looks and&#xD;
short answers, although she is not conscious of any&#xD;
special fault. Added to this, the husband has discovered&#xD;
a hole under the arm of his coat, that he wishes his wife&#xD;
to darn very nicely, and a few stitches are to be taken&#xD;
in that fob-pocket, and afew more in cording anew the&#xD;
bottom ~f his pantaloons; and in the mean time he in-&#xD;
quires "if it would be convenient to invite Mr. Simonds&#xD;
&#xD;
to dinner ~ " Just as if; on washing-day, any food could&#xD;
be thought about, unless it be a "picked up" dinner!&#xD;
The reign of disorder in the kitchen now increases;&#xD;
the process of ataxching is commenced; there is great&#xD;
haste to "hang out,?' and little care to rub clean, and a&#xD;
gentle hint from the mistress brings down a shower of&#xD;
abuse from the domestics, who declare every family in&#xD;
the city sends away all nice garments to the laundry, and&#xD;
intimate that hereafter they expect to be treated as other&#xD;
domestics.&#xD;
The children have fretted the morning away. John went&#xD;
out to skate, about the middle of the forenoon, and grew&#xD;
sick at his stomach, and is a fit subject for water-gruel&#xD;
a beverage he despises. Emma has broken her doll's face,&#xD;
which she promised papa she would keep forever, if he&#xD;
would buy it for a "Christmas present;" and, to com&#xD;
plete the vexation, some CC dear friends" from the country&#xD;
have come in just to deposit their baggage, get their food,&#xD;
and do some shopping.&#xD;
Madam goes down to regulate affairs in the region&#xD;
of discord. The bell rings, and some of her genteel&#xD;
acquaintances have called; she would not but be dressed&#xD;
in silk, for the world, to receive them; so she departs&#xD;
hastily to her dressing-room, attires herself like a lady,&#xD;
and is only mortified by a chattering little fellow, who&#xD;
says, "Ma is getting diviner down stairs, but she went&#xD;
up to dress her just now." And what a meeting!&#xD;
"How glad I am to see you, my dear Mrs. H.!"&#xD;
"No more so than I am to find you at home. Now&#xD;
I really hope I have not interfered with any domestic&#xD;
engagement."&#xD;

MRS. FELL'S EXPERIMENT.&#xD;
TUB entire wish of Mrs. Pell's heart had long been to&#xD;
remove into the country. She had taken so many after-&#xD;
noon rides, passing by white cottages covered with honey-&#xD;
suckle and woodbine; she had looked upon so many&#xD;
open piazzas, where rocking-chairs and rocking-horses&#xD;
composed the furniture of such shady retreats, and her&#xD;
mind was so entirely fixed upon trying the experiment,&#xD;
'that General Pell had little peace until her wishes were&#xD;
fully carried out. So when "Rosebrier Cottage" was&#xD;
advertised, General Pell was the purchaser. Mrs. Pell&#xD;
was, at this. time, the most blithe and delightful woman&#xD;
to be fQund. She was about to relinquish her city cares;&#xD;
to vacate her large granite house; to make an overturn in&#xD;
her domestic arrangements, and move into the countrV.&#xD;
We must do justice to Mrs. Fell's character; therefore&#xD;
we must not leave out of sight an avaricious propensity,&#xD;
which ever led her to count the cost before undertaking&#xD;
any 'great outlay. It wa~ a long time, therefore, before&#xD;
she settled in her mind that would~ be a proper sum for&#xD;
the occupant of her city dwelling. She thought the dif-&#xD;
ference in rent between city and country, with economy,&#xD;
would defray all the household expenses in her new&#xD;
home. General Fell was not such &amp;amp; nice calculator; he&#xD;

was a military man, and when a heavy demand was&#xD;
made upon his purse to support his office, he never&#xD;
flinched, and it was in part to keep him more at home,&#xD;
away from such enjoyments, that Mrs. Fell had been&#xD;
induced to try the change. Then, again, the health of&#xD;
her children was another prime consideration. Arthur&#xD;
was just recovering from the effects of a whooping-cough,&#xD;
and Billy always was afflicted with some complaint inci-&#xD;
dent and attendant upon hot weather. Her physician&#xD;
had for several years ordered them into the country dur-&#xD;
ing the rage of dog-'days, and Mrs. Fell, and her chil-&#xD;
dren and servants, had not found so much comfort in&#xD;
staying by the sea-shore, or living at the "Springs," as&#xD;
some other ladies. Those heavy payments at the close&#xD;
of the term were a great drawback upon her enjoyment;&#xD;
for she was mistress of her own purse, from property&#xD;
inherited in her own right; so General Jell never con-&#xD;
tradicted or advised contrary to her preconceived plans.&#xD;
The removal to "Rosebrier Cottage" was, in itself,&#xD;
quite an event in Mrs. Fell's life. The general had&#xD;
found a tenant for the city residence, -a member of the&#xD;
company whom he once commanded, and a five years'&#xD;
lease was drawn; the general; however, reserving the&#xD;
prii~ilege of one chamber in the mansion for hi~ private&#xD;
use; so that when over-fatigued, or fearful, it might be,&#xD;
of .a Candle, lecture, he could have a retreat where h~&#xD;
could lie down in peace.&#xD;
"Rosebrier Cottage" was just off from the great road;&#xD;
down a verdant lane, boi~dered on each side with shrub~&#xD;
bery. Just the spot where a romantic couple would&#xD;
dream of living upon ethereal s~bsttumces, forgetting all&#xD;
&#xD;
* about vulgar bodily wants. But Mrs. Bell had a difl~r..&#xD;
ent taste and. a difti~rent family. She lived fi.ir her cliii..&#xD;
dren now, and for het husband when he was with k~r.&#xD;
But, in ~his chosen retreat, for the first time in her life,&#xD;
she began to feel the effects of solitude. The nursery-&#xD;
maid h9 charge of the two boys, and in their gym-&#xD;
nastic exercises and rural sports she could not largely*&#xD;
participate.&#xD;
The cottage was darkly shaded by heavy trees; there&#xD;
was a sombre look even in the sunshine, which reflected&#xD;
only quivering brancl~es waving against the Venetian&#xD;
blinds; there was a deep silence, save when broken by the&#xD;
sound of the children's voices, and altogether a sense of&#xD;
loneliness crept over the new inmates of the cottage. Gen-&#xD;
eral Fell, when at home, left early in the morning, and&#xD;
never returned till evening. So the dinner-table was&#xD;
leaded by Mrs. Pell and her two children. To keep&#xD;
them under wholesome restraint was an impossibility;&#xD;
they would take advantage of their father's absence, and&#xD;
a scene of wild disorder generally led. the nursery-maid&#xD;
to remove them from the table before the second course&#xD;
~as brought on; and to a lonely woman in a lox~e cottage&#xD;
the attraction of a country home may be imagined. One&#xD;
cannot twist wreaths of flowers the long day. Few are&#xD;
listless enough to sit for hours at an open window to&#xD;
hear the robins sing; and, after~ all the bustle of city life,&#xD;
such profound quiet is but "inglorious ease,"~ without&#xD;
friendly 'companionship.&#xD;
It was a long while before. Mrs. Peil's city friends&#xD;
found their way tQ "Rosebrier C~ttage." She had not&#xD;
\ been pm~e~i~g in her invitation. th~t they should~ do so,&#xD;

&#xD;
and so they sparingly came. Even then, there was a&#xD;
sort of discomfort about receiving them; there was no&#xD;
market near; she found it difficult to keep a cook, on&#xD;
account of the retired situation. There were few to con-&#xD;
sume the products of the market, and, as the general was&#xD;
seldom at home, the dinner dwindled into a very common&#xD;
affair. So a friend to pass the day, although it some-&#xD;
what relieved the monotony, yet abated the pleasure by&#xD;
the effort to wait on her.&#xD;
But how were the~ children progressing ~ They were&#xD;
quite as liable to illness as before. Arthur, from ex-&#xD;
posure to damp evening air, had several times been&#xD;
threatened with the croup, and Billy had broken one&#xD;
arm, through the nursery-maid's carelessnessof course,&#xD;
besides being subject to some chronic difficulties, wholly&#xD;
attributable to the location of "Rosebrier Cottage."&#xD;
The general, too, had been absent on duty the most&#xD;
of the summer; and Mrs. Fell begau to wonder why&#xD;
the charms of a country life were so incomplete. She&#xD;
was certain she enjoyed nothing. The days seemed&#xD;
to her of interminable length; she had read all her&#xD;
books; she h~d even studied newspaper advertisements ~&#xD;
she had hemstitched all her ruffles, and as to great care&#xD;
upon her own wardrobe, who hut the croaking frogs, the&#xD;
chattering swallows, and the whippoorwills regarded her&#xD;
apparel 'I Ab.! she had made a mistake, and we will tell&#xD;
you how she made it.&#xD;
In the first place, her avaricious spirit led her to&#xD;
imagine. a home in the country would be a more economi-&#xD;
c~i a~'air; secondly, she misjudged her husband's taste.&#xD;
And, hor.ft~r, let no woman ixMgine, if th~ charms abe&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
can throw about a city home are not sufficient to retain&#xD;
a husband there as his chosen resort, that leaving him&#xD;
among the high spirits he ~ovets, will ever win him over&#xD;
to rural felicity. Then, a~ to the matter of children's&#xD;
health, there is no security against disease, whe±e pa..&#xD;
rental care is improperly bestowed or wholly entrusted to&#xD;
servants; and, last of all, it is never the part of wisdom&#xD;
for a wife to make a distinction between "mine and&#xD;
thine," hoping thereby to increase mutual esteem.&#xD;
General Fell returned late in the autumn from one of&#xD;
his tours. "Rosebrier Cottage" had a forlorn look&#xD;
outwardly. The long, trailing vines were craving sup-&#xD;
port. The gardener had long since left the place. Mrs.&#xD;
Fell was a mere skeleton; and the boys were wild, un..&#xD;
governable, and unrestrained by parental discipline. But&#xD;
one domestic (the nursery~woman) remained on duty,&#xD;
and she received extra pay for doing so. The general&#xD;
met his wife in tears; but knowing it was not discreet to&#xD;
commence any comments upon the obvious condition of&#xD;
things, he waited until~ her proud spirit yielded, and&#xD;
importuned his assistance.&#xD;
A new house was taken in the city; soon after, (3Ien-&#xD;
eral Fell resigned his commission, and Mrs. Fell en~&#xD;
tru3te4 him with the investment of her money, and this&#xD;
repose of confidence led him to financier in the best&#xD;
possible manner, since their interests had now become a~&#xD;
mutual affair. Since then he is much at home, and the&#xD;
perfect discipline with which he has controlled those&#xD;
wayward boys has convinced the mother which of the&#xD;
two is the better fitted to enforce obedience. Mrs. Fell&#xD;
h88 never since attempted to manage her family concerns&#xD;

alone, having been taught the folly of seeking to control&#xD;
a husband and household, without having first, laid the&#xD;
foundation upon mutual confidence and esteem.&#xD;
The thought of her first experiment to live in the&#xD;
country, in a sort of half-fledged condition, always man~&#xD;
ties her cheeks with the blush of shame; but her repent-&#xD;
ance was deep enough to effect a cure. We would not,&#xD;
however, deem it amiss to say a word to other Mrs. Pells,&#xD;
who are sighing for Rosebrier Cottages as the ultimatum&#xD;
of 'their hopes. We would by no means disparage the&#xD;
itiany pleasures connected with such a residence; but&#xD;
that they have serious trials to encounter, who go without&#xD;
forethought, admits of no doubt. The business of the&#xD;
husband not unfrequently renders such retirement a&#xD;
great inconvenience; he cannot be much at home while&#xD;
his children are actively employed; the etiquette of the&#xD;
table is too often neglected; the. privileges of good&#xD;
schools are sometimes renounced; life too often ~degener~..&#xD;
ates into a mere holida~j'; and, some philosophers will&#xD;
have it, women become imperious by being unrestrained&#xD;
in gayety. Therefore, we would recommend to all hus~&#xD;
bands and wives to seek their pleasures as far as possible&#xD;
together; never separate enjoyment from each other'a&#xD;
society; but, above all things, if you sustain the parental&#xD;
relation, live where you. can live most with your cliii-&#xD;
drew; if your inclination t~nd means suggest, a Country&#xD;
howe, seek it, but never disjoin tke~ two.&#xD;

THE FAST YOUNG MAN.&#xD;
T~w~i "fast young man" does not remember where his&#xD;
father was born, nor what was his occupation. The slow&#xD;
means by which he gained his wealth is all an enigma&#xD;
to him. He stepped into his silver slippers when he died,&#xD;
and has worn them half out before he has arrived at&#xD;
years of discretion.&#xD;
What a swell he makes! Money has made him some-&#xD;
what popular with the upper ten; and the daughters of&#xD;
former shoemakers, barbers, and wine-merchants, who&#xD;
lived under ground, and "sold by the glass," iiow look&#xD;
upon him asa "idce young man;" and to be sure he is.&#xD;
His dickey is transparent with waxy gloss; his wristbands&#xD;
protrude below his cuffs just far enough to show their&#xD;
quality; over his vest is displayed such an elegant mas-&#xD;
sive California gold chain, that it is very pardonable to&#xD;
speak about it. Besides, he, is so generous! If he meets&#xD;
a young lady, he. forthwith conducts her to a confection-&#xD;
er's to take an "ice," or acup of smoking Mocha; there&#xD;
the invitation i~ extended to 8 concert, then an opera;&#xD;
and, by this time, both have lost their natural vision, and&#xD;
can only see through expensive "eye-tubes."&#xD;
But the fast young man has money, and what does he&#xD;

&#xD;
care for labor, and old women's talk about the "road to&#xD;
rum"? His motto is, "one life and a merry one."&#xD;
At the expiration of five years we will look at him&#xD;
again. He has now lost much of the "dandy," and be-&#xD;
gins to exhibit quite a "seedy" appearance. His gait&#xD;
is stiff; he lounges at the corners of the street, or is found&#xD;
sitting, stooping and stupid, upon the loafer's bench; has&#xD;
quit those "divine young ladies," or, rather, they have&#xD;
left him, and he begins to think his prospects for the&#xD;
future are rather cloudy. If he could but raise an outfit,&#xD;
he would gladly take passage to Australia; but if he has&#xD;
a friend (generally. he has none), as soon as he suggests&#xD;
the idea of borrowing enough for "a start," he' is hushed&#xD;
by the reply, "Why, to a person of your habits that&#xD;
climate would soon prove fatal." sow, what hopes can&#xD;
he entertain? The past has been all wasted; the present&#xD;
finds him minus of character, cash, and credit; the future&#xD;
lies before h~m with a diseased, bloated body, filled with&#xD;
pains, and nobody to sympathize with him; and, beyond&#xD;
this world, he so dreads a retribution, that he envies the&#xD;
very dumb animal. He did not mean to finish off in this&#xD;
manner when he started in life.&#xD;

SPEECH-MAKING.&#xD;
WHY is it that our most talented public speakers are&#xD;
forever apologizing, in the outset, for appearing before&#xD;
the "vast and intelligent audience"? You ma~ travel&#xD;
from one end of the continent to the other, and, in nine&#xD;
cases out of ten, when the great man rises to speak, h~&#xD;
will tell you "the call was unexpected;" or that "lie is&#xD;
miserably jaded with the fatigue of a long journey;" or&#xD;
"that he has made no sort of preparation for a speech,"&#xD;
which he all the while intends shall electrify a whole&#xD;
multitude. I wonder if public speakers think they thus&#xD;
impose on their hearers, and get up a true sympathizing&#xD;
spirit for their professedly unsound condition? Why not&#xD;
tell the real state of their minds, if an exordium 1w so&#xD;
needful to I going on with what they mean to say, and&#xD;
prepare their remarks something after this manner?&#xD;
"I rise, my friends, because I feel strongly inclined&#xD;
to do so, knowing the power I possess, and the eloquence&#xD;
for which I am distinguished; this props me up amidst&#xD;
all the privatioi~s and fatigue attendant upon coming&#xD;
before you. Fame (that is, popular favor) I covet,&#xD;
yet I would not be accounted vain or filled with seW&#xD;
esteem."&#xD;

conceit; for, after being repeatedly told that his talents&#xD;
are of the highest order, that he is remarkable for logical&#xD;
precision, and always bringing the strong points in his&#xD;
subject forward, so that 'they leave an overwhelming im-&#xD;
pression upon the audience, how can he forget such enco.&#xD;
miums when he next rises in a crowded assembly?&#xD;
I~2ow, did a public speaker know how distasteful to an&#xD;
audience are his first apologies, he would never make&#xD;
them. If~ he is unprepared, why does he say anything?&#xD;
If he is hoarse, he need not tell Qf it. If he is tired,&#xD;
nobody can help it. Could he but see (I mean the&#xD;
4ogizing man) how his best friends twirl their canes,&#xD;
or pick the fingers of their gloves, or look suspiciously&#xD;
into their neighbors' faces, there would, be few who would&#xD;
venture to begin with talking about themselves.&#xD;
We have sometimes fancied we saw a wag coming upon&#xD;
the stage, after all the speakers had apologized for address..&#xD;
ing ~the audience, and, although not in very good ~aste&#xD;
to a refined assembly, yet commencing something&#xD;
like this: "My friends, I am exceedingly glad to have&#xD;
this opportunity to utter my sentiments. I know IL am a&#xD;
good speaker. IL. love your applause, for it excites my&#xD;
eloquence. I have no cold or disease which now troubles&#xD;
me. IL am not weary, foi I have rested on purpose t~o&#xD;
appear before you m a healthy condition. I am,, there-&#xD;
fore, anxious to do my best. I trust the reporters will&#xD;
so herald my speech that my breakfast to-morrow morn-&#xD;
ing may be swallowed with a seasoning of just praise,&#xD;
wl4ch I feel is my due; for I well know my superiority&#xD;
above all who have preceded me; besides, I always aim&#xD;
tQ l~mv~ a i~ost powerful im~ressiQn; my wit is not stale&#xD;
&#xD;
and my reasoning is not overdone~ My manner is unex-&#xD;
ceptionable, for I have practiced some years to acquire it,&#xD;
and my personal appearance is dignified and imposing."&#xD;
Can we be reproached as satirical if we appropriate&#xD;
much of what the wag has uttered, as being the real&#xD;
sentiment of many an apologist?&#xD;
Let u&amp;amp;have the truth; and,' although a wise man will&#xD;
repress his vanity, yet let him not covet a sympathy to&#xD;
which he is not entitled, when his whole life-time has&#xD;
been a preparation for extemporaneous speech-making.&#xD;

WEALTH WITH INDOLENCE.&#xD;
WEALTH! Young ladies are prone to pay too much&#xD;
regard to riches. They seek showy rather than virtuous&#xD;
companions. A massive chain, an opal ring, a certain&#xD;
dandyish pretension, is extremely taking with some well-&#xD;
educated ladies. The young man who is unassuming,&#xD;
and slowly makes his way to fortune by untiring indus.&#xD;
try, is too often cast in the shade. Yet we will follow&#xD;
the two a few years, and most probably the one~ whom&#xD;
we cast aside will be considered the most useful citizen.&#xD;
Women err strangely in forming marriage engagements.&#xD;
They may not be altogether in fault here ; for does not&#xD;
mamma, ay, and papa too, often inquire, is he rich?&#xD;
as if this were the saving clause.&#xD;
An heir to a large estate lately married a poor girl.&#xD;
Every one looked on with the highest satisfaction. "How&#xD;
fortunate!" was in the mouth of all her friends. But the&#xD;
young husband had nothing to do; he wasted life in a.&#xD;
public hotel, or he travelled to some watering-place, and&#xD;
the long dog-days were spent in brushing flies, or&#xD;
driving mosquitoes. The wife fell ii~to indolent habits,&#xD;
and, from having nothing to do, learned to do nothing.&#xD;
Some called it a state of elegant ease; nobody found&#xD;
fault, because, where bills are paid, and plenty of money&#xD;
&#xD;
is left, the world will not complain. But as to the real&#xD;
happiness of such a life, it admits no comparison with that&#xD;
of those who started in life poor but hopeful, combating&#xD;
disappointment, and rising by degrees to an abundance;&#xD;
learning how to use and enjoy, and in the very aequi~i-&#xD;
tion deriving more pleasure than in fruition. For thus&#xD;
are we made, const~tly finding new pleasure with new&#xD;
acquisition; and no sooner do we sit down to enjoy our&#xD;
wealth, than we find it insufficient to fill the vacuity.&#xD;
For this reason people who retire from active busi-&#xD;
ness with scanty mental resources are rarely happy.&#xD;
They find a satiety they never knew in business; and I&#xD;
lament when I hear a wife so urgent that her husband&#xD;
should build a cottage and live upon his money - as if&#xD;
idleness and ease made pleasure.&#xD;

THOUGHTS FOR THE GLOOMY.&#xD;
IN the midst of the autumnal tinge I walk out in the&#xD;
country to revive the association of the past. It is not&#xD;
my taste to groan and sigh over the de~3ay of nature.&#xD;
On the contrary, my thoughts are lively and buoyant.&#xD;
What is there to make one sad? All things that are&#xD;
dying we know will be again revived, and many of them&#xD;
will put on far more beautiful forms. The trees, like&#xD;
our bodies, will soon have a resurrection, and be clothed&#xD;
with fresher beauty. Why, then, mourn if disease invades&#xD;
our frame? What if it should yield to the influence of&#xD;
this or that malady 3 Can we not trust to the beneficent&#xD;
decrees of our Maker, who so planned the structure that&#xD;
from its present ruins an incorruptible clothing may be&#xD;
put upon it? Our thoughts need not be sad and enervat~&#xD;
ing, cheating us of all pleasure in the present, and fore-&#xD;
boding only gloom in the future. We cherish such&#xD;
pernicious feelings until life becomes the most unpalat-&#xD;
able drug, and yet we shrink from quitting it, so dis-&#xD;
trustful are we of the kind care which placed us here.&#xD;
0, it is painful to hear some Christian people complain&#xD;
of" inflictions," and "their hard lot," all the wb~ile they&#xD;
are themselves making it so!&#xD;
Autumn is thought particularly to awaken these&#xD;
&#xD;
gloomy sensations. It need not be so. A new sc~en~&#xD;
opens on us; our eyes are dazzled with the fading land~&#xD;
scape; its purple and gold touch the heart ~vith delight.&#xD;
I feel as if in holiday attire. To be sure~ the flower.&#xD;
beds are stricken down; the broad suniiow4rs no longer&#xD;
wave majestically; the pinks and peonies have disap-&#xD;
peared, but the box-tree is still as verdant as ever, the&#xD;
pine-tree maintains its greenness, and there is always&#xD;
something about me which retains its original. What&#xD;
if I muse unconsciously? I am not sad.&#xD;
I remember that flower-garden, once my delight as I&#xD;
conveyed the water-pot to refresh it; how the scions and&#xD;
slips I procured grew fair and strong under my skilful&#xD;
training. They gave me satisfaction then, and the&#xD;
retrospect does so now. There, too, stood the kitchen&#xD;
garden.&#xD;
The vegetables I so faithfully attended, yielded me&#xD;
their reward. They grew luxuriantly, and the recol-&#xD;
lection of those evening strolls, when I marked their&#xD;
progress, now yields me pleasure. I cannot sigh because&#xD;
they answered those uses, and are gathered and gone.&#xD;
My eyes are now opened to other scenes. The lively&#xD;
recollection of the past inspires me with hope for the&#xD;
future. Yonder is a boy flying his kite. I cannot say,&#xD;
"Pooi~ fellow, I used to amuse myself like you; but that&#xD;
day of merriment will no ~more return to me!" I feel&#xD;
merry now. I can recall my fluttering emotions when I&#xD;
first let go the string, and I gazed to see it soar among&#xD;
the clouds. To be sure, I have a different stock of fears&#xD;
and hopes at this time, and these n~y yield me, If not~&#xD;

&#xD;
so airy, quite as substantial pleasure. So why ~houId I&#xD;
mourn that I can no longer fly a kite'?&#xD;
We are always straining after some enjoyment beyond&#xD;
our reach, away in the distance. Some are longing for the&#xD;
season of winter gayeties, living on expectation of future&#xD;
parties, balls, lectures and the like; but such people never&#xD;
enjoy the now of existence. Retrospect and anticipa-&#xD;
tion is the sum of all their pleasures.. Give me a lively&#xD;
hope to sustain me to-day. I care not what season I am&#xD;
living in. When we cease to be children toys should no&#xD;
longer amuse us.&#xD;
More than half the world are diseased, but they are&#xD;
not all filled with bodily maladies which a prescription&#xD;
will cure. They are mind~sick, and this is a malady&#xD;
drugs never reach. Narcotics, to be sure, may deaden&#xD;
sensibilities, but they do not give healthful vigor. I&#xD;
would rather do the most menial work, if I could only&#xD;
breathe a pure atmosphere, than cramp my faculties in&#xD;
devising schemes to make me happy at some distant&#xD;
period. To-day is all that can call my own, and&#xD;
must be busy in its sunshine. "But," says the croaker,&#xD;
"my days are all cloudy; I have had no sunshine since I&#xD;
was a child." Again I repeat, the fault is your own.&#xD;
What do you gain by moping over your troubles'?&#xD;
"You cannot help it," do you reply'? You never will&#xD;
help it, so long as you permit yourself to dwell upon&#xD;
and talk about them. Do your own work faithfully, and&#xD;
have some ever on hand to do; keep up a cheerful&#xD;
exterior; and, nine times out of ten, you will cure the&#xD;
wi~lady of which you complain.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUNSHINE AND CLOUDS.&#xD;
SUNSHINE and clouds! How beautifully they succeed&#xD;
each other in the natural world! The heavy cloud which&#xD;
rises in yonder western horizon emits flashes of lightning&#xD;
which almost removes our natural sight; and that low&#xD;
muttering report, which follows so closely upon it, shows&#xD;
to us with what majesty nati~re reveals herself. By and&#xD;
by comes the fertilizing shower, and the little, fainting,&#xD;
parched twig has a rain-drop upon its tiny leag and&#xD;
although the sun has come forth in its full splendor, the.&#xD;
tear still glitters, and every hue of the rainbow is&#xD;
reflected from it.&#xD;
Why is it not thus with the showers of affliction which&#xD;
are poured upon us'? They are surely designed for a far&#xD;
higher end than the natural shower; for that water~ only&#xD;
a parched earth, which will soon become thirsty and crave&#xD;
it again; whereas the shower of tear-drops which bruises&#xD;
our spirits carries with it the blessed influence of healing~&#xD;
which should so fertilize our Christian graces, as to need&#xD;
no repetition; but, like the varied hues of the rainbow,&#xD;
which are so blended that no one color tahes precedence&#xD;
of the other, so the blended and harmonious mingling of&#xD;
the rain-drops of affliction should be irradiated by the sun&#xD;
of righteousness, that a perfect bow should span the&#xD;
horizon of our souls.&#xD;

TILE COUNTRY IN WINTER.&#xD;
A WINTER'S residence in the country is much more&#xD;
than it is usually accounted to mean. To one especially,&#xD;
who does business in the city, some three, five, or ten&#xD;
miles off, the privileges are peculiar; the cars are so&#xD;
convenient and accommodating withal. You may miss&#xD;
seeing the man with whom you have business, a dozen&#xD;
times in a day; he may state the hour you can see him,&#xD;
- but the train leaves just ten minutes before that time;&#xD;
or you may conclude to stay over one~ train, and. what&#xD;
confusion is made in the home where you were an ex-&#xD;
pected guest! How the little ones clan~or for "turkey&#xD;
and bread," not to say a word of the mother-in-law,&#xD;
who, perchance, is fretting and knitting in the corner,&#xD;
"wondering how people can expect to do business in one&#xD;
place, and keep themselves in another;" or the wife&#xD;
goes sighing thrcnigh the room with a look of anxiety in&#xD;
hem~ face, "hoping there is no accident to-day;" aiid,&#xD;
as she looks out, there is her neighbor who has been&#xD;
home and dined, and is ready for a fresh start; and Miss&#xD;
Muggins has~ happened from tbe city to spend the day&#xD;
just atAhe time you were wanting in butter and minus in&#xD;
groceries, and you buy everything 'in the city, where your&#xD;
husband has an account. And then the children behave&#xD;
&#xD;
so when their father is absent; they are so boisterous.&#xD;
And when it is so cheerless within, as you look without,&#xD;
how the blues creep over you!&#xD;
The old flower-stalks are all empty and dry, the.&#xD;
grass all brown and crisped, the vines all tangled and&#xD;
overgrown with dead weed, the trees all dismantled, and&#xD;
the leaves heaved up like little mountains, awaiting a&#xD;
high gust to send them in mid air like snow-flakes; and,&#xD;
then, to break the monotony, there is the hissing of the&#xD;
tea-kettle, and the low kind of second which "Maggie" is&#xD;
continually singing, and, more than all, your meditations&#xD;
on this wise: "Why did I ever think of living in the&#xD;
country the year round ~ Why, for the health of the&#xD;
children, to be sure. And how has it proved? 'Ned'&#xD;
has had the scarlet fever, and little 'Nell' the whoop-&#xD;
ing-cough, and we were obliged to send into the city to&#xD;
get our old physician (all practise on the new principle out&#xD;
here) ;. and who cares for a fee, when a child's life is at&#xD;
stake? Well, then, as we were here, why, the plea of&#xD;
economy is urged, and a cheaper rent. Row much&#xD;
cheaper? One hundred dollars less than we paid in the&#xD;
city, where conveniences were much more compact.&#xD;
Wood, water and drains all in a heap Ihere. We are ex-&#xD;
posed to cold, sunshine and observation; our next neigh-&#xD;
bor, exactly facing all our domestic operations, and always&#xD;
happening to be looking at us just as we would avoid&#xD;
scrutiny. Then the children must trudge half a mile to&#xD;
school, and when Sunday comes, in what a state we find&#xD;
ourselves! No Sunday~school very n9ar; omnibus to&#xD;
take us to the city, but who can get ready seasonably?&#xD;

lacing ar~ broken, and father forgot 'the memorandum'&#xD;
we so charged him to remember, and Maggie must go&#xD;

in the city, where she can attend mass in the morning."&#xD;
And, then, it is so delightful to attend lecti~res, and&#xD;
concerts, and parties of all sorts in the city; to go to&#xD;
some friend's house and "fix, " after riding in the omni-&#xD;
bus, bringing the baby atop of your best silk dress, -&#xD;
and to stay till midnight, find omnibus gone, and obliged&#xD;
to accept invitation to stay all night; to rise headache,&#xD;
and put on your nice dress, and go home to find every.&#xD;
thing helter-skelter; and have your husband's mother&#xD;
meet you in the front-door passage, and inform you&#xD;

Ag~in, it is so pleasant, when your husband does&#xD;
not come home to dinner, to take his place and help some&#xD;
half dozen lady guests, who are "so fond of the country&#xD;
that they have come to pass the day with you," although&#xD;
when in the city they never thought of more than a call!&#xD;
To sit and hear their admiration of your tasteful place,&#xD;
and "the lovely spot it must be in summer," and, per-&#xD;
chance, hear the conclusion, "but it is so dull, we&#xD;
never could live in the country in the winter."&#xD;
Then the snowstorm! To inhabit a house facing due&#xD;
north, with a large hall on either side the parlors, where&#xD;
the ~olian harps constantly are played! To wake in&#xD;

your husband has got to face the weather, and break the&#xD;
paths, and thaw the pumps, and dig out some wood, and&#xD;
that he must go, for he has a note at the bank to pay,&#xD;
and you have such a dread of protested notes that you&#xD;
are willing he should make the sacrifice.&#xD;
More than all,-to feel that the die is cast,-that you&#xD;

all pleasure-seeking is forever at an end.&#xD;
You may expect but few changes; The hinges will&#xD;
rust off the gate, and the blinds will need a new coat of&#xD;

TIlE FEMALE FINANCIER.&#xD;
never was a woman who has lived longer On&#xD;
promises than I have, Mr. Oldbuck. More than a year&#xD;
ago, when I told you we must have new parlor carpets,&#xD;
you put me off till the' election' was over, because then&#xD;
there would be such 'good times,' that I thought Cali-&#xD;
fornia and our metropolis would only be another name&#xD;
~f'or the gold region. Now look at it ,- where are my&#xD;
carpets?"&#xD;
"You speak, wife, as if I had the whole control of&#xD;
events. How could I foresee that times would be as they&#xD;
are money at nine and ten per cent., and banks refusing&#xD;
to discount only the best of paper - stocks down, and&#xD;
manufacturing interests at a stand comparatively for the&#xD;
last;year, at least short dividends?"&#xD;
"I wish 1 were a man, Mr. Oldbuck, and I '11 war-&#xD;
'rant you I would have things different. Do you suppose&#xD;
I would have served on ward committees during all that&#xD;
exciting campaign to elect a President, attended cau-&#xD;
cuses, carried torch-lights, and given such entertainments,&#xD;
and, after all, be turned off without an office? This is&#xD;
the world's gratitude, Mr. Oldbuck. No; when I was in&#xD;
Washington, I would have kept there till I got some-&#xD;
thing, if I had stayed a whole year to accomplish my&#xD;
purpo~."&#xD;

&#xD;
SUBSTANCE AND 8J!ADQWS.&#xD;
You reason very foolishly, wife. Did I not secure&#xD;
all the testimonials of my ability for an office? L)i4 I&#xD;
not go to great expense, and wait until 'hope deferred&#xD;
made my heart sick,' as Miss Keinbie said last night?&#xD;
And did you not say I had better return and mind my&#xD;
own business?"&#xD;
"What if Idid? IfI had been a man, I should have&#xD;
had more courage, I '11 warrant ye. I would have made&#xD;
the President pay for all the champagne and time I had&#xD;
spent in his behalf; if I had filched it out of his own&#xD;
pockets."&#xD;
"You would! Well, well, I did not, and so let th.&#xD;
matter rest."&#xD;
"But, I tell you, I want some new carpets."&#xD;
"When my dividends warrant it, wife, you shall&#xD;
have them. You know, as well as I do, how 'stocks'&#xD;
stand now no agitation in the market, no time to sell,&#xD;
and no time to buy."&#xD;
You are a fool, Mr. Oldbuck, to let your broke'&#xD;
serve you such a game. Have you lost all confidence in&#xD;
your own judgment, that you must trust to him when it&#xD;
isbestto 'sellout' or 'buy in'? He'Ufieece youas&#xD;
clean as old Ichabod Gammon was served."&#xD;
"Gammon, Gammon who was he?"&#xD;
"Why, my Uncle Ichabod, to be sure. I)idn't he&#xD;
employ a broker to invest, all his money, and didn't he&#xD;
keep changing stocks, and crying up this, and down that,&#xD;
until at last all hi~ property got in the worsted mill, till&#xD;
it worsted him, poor old man, out of all he had? And&#xD;
your fate will be no better, Mr. Oldbuck, if you don't&#xD;
turn about and do your. own business in your own way."&#xD;

you would be very glad to have me undertake and clear&#xD;

There was to be a house auction the next day. A&#xD;
suit of Brussels carpets were to be sold, that had been&#xD;
down but two years, and the size exactly fitted Mrs.&#xD;
0ldbu~k's drawing-rooms. She had never been at an&#xD;
auction, but herr neighbor Grimshaw had often showed&#xD;
her great bargains she had procured. She thought she&#xD;
would ask her to accompany her, and if she got a decided&#xD;
bargain (as she felt confident she should), there would&#xD;
be no trouble but her husband could raise the money to&#xD;
pay for her purchases. The plan met with her neigh-&#xD;
bor's entire approval, and early the next morning both&#xD;
ladies were at the sale. There were some bedsteads of&#xD;
beautiful finish, ~6tne x~att1~esses and a number of articles&#xD;
which exactly filled Mrs. Oldbuck's eye, to famish anew&#xD;

fled every time she looked upon them, and it was with&#xD;
the greatest impatience she waited for the auctioneer to&#xD;
come to the articles she meant td bid upon. At length&#xD;
the carpets were put up.&#xD;
"How much am I offered for these beautiful car-&#xD;
pets?" inquired the shrewd auctioneer -." new, clean,&#xD;
beautiful pattern, and been used but two years, without a&#xD;
stain or spot."&#xD;
"One dollar per yard," said Mrs. Oldbuck.&#xD;
Neighbor Grimshaw touched her -" You are too fi~at&#xD;
don't bid again."&#xD;
"One dollar five cents - ten twelve I am offered&#xD;
- who says more for this splendid bargain?"&#xD;
"Seven shillings," said Mrs. Oldbuck.&#xD;
"One dollar twenty-five," hallooed an anxious by..&#xD;
bidder.&#xD;
"One thirty," shouted Mrs. Oldbuck; and) nobody&#xD;
saying more, the 'carpets were knocked' down to Mrs.&#xD;
Jedediali Oldbuck. "What a bargain!" said she to&#xD;
Mrs. Grimahaw. "I guess my husband will be "-&#xD;

"Ten dollars," said Mrs. Oldbwck.&#xD;
Nobody bid Over her,- it was fairly hers.&#xD;
"The mattress - a new hair mattress, and how much&#xD;

dollars for this splendid mattress-why, it is giving it&#xD;
away~&#xD;
Seven,~ eight, ten, eleven, twelve,-" fifteen," again said&#xD;
Mrs. Oldbuck, greatly advancing on the company; and&#xD;
it was hers! And she purchased a bathing4nb, and&#xD;
shower apparatus, and an antique bureau, and some old&#xD;
prints, and a few old chairs; so that in all her bill&#xD;
amounted to two hundred and three dollars and six&#xD;
cents!&#xD;
The articles were all sent home that afternoon~ and&#xD;
such a motley exhibition was rarely seen. The same&#xD;
pattern and quality of carpeting was selling at one&#xD;
dollar and twelve cents at retail, the pattern being old-&#xD;
fashioned; besides, it was so mothy that several yards&#xD;
mustz be thrown' out. The mattress was filled with&#xD;
western hair, and smelt very disagreeably, and cost but&#xD;
six dollars originally! The bedstead looked as if some&#xD;
occupants bad been, and were still, in embryo. The&#xD;
chairs were fit only for a miser's gaxret, and the shower-&#xD;
'bath was broken, and Mrs. Oldbuck'e 'physician said it&#xD;
uever should be used, as showering the head was decid-&#xD;
edly injurious to health.&#xD;
Mr. Oldbuck came home attwilight, and looked upon&#xD;
the purchases, and then upon his unpaid bill, and then&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the countenance of his wife. lie said nothing -&#xD;
no, he never did ; - she reproached him enough for&#xD;
both.&#xD;
Mrs. Oldbuck did not sleep, that night. She felt&#xD;
quite sick the next day. The auction furniture still&#xD;
stood in the back kitchen. It was a trying time for&#xD;
Mrs. Oldbuck.&#xD;
A week after, Michael, the handcartman, was directed&#xD;
to carry every article to the auction store, to be resold;&#xD;
and a suit of fashionable tapestry carpets were sent home&#xD;
without any comments. 'Mrs. Oldbuck gradually re~~&#xD;
covered. There are certain kinds of mortification which&#xD;
do not prove fatal. Nothing was ever said of her&#xD;
purchases between husband and wife; but Mrs. Grim-&#xD;
shaw had to "take it," for leading her into such foolish&#xD;
expenditures, and they are no longer neighbors.&#xD;
Oldbuck was speaking of the money-market, the other&#xD;
evening, to a friend, when the gentleman addressed him-&#xD;
self to Mrs. (2)ldbuck, saying, "I suppose if you women&#xD;
ruled without, as well as within, we should be saved&#xD;
from all this trouble."&#xD;
Mrs~ Oldbuck replied, "Female financiers wh&amp;amp; knew&#xD;
how to invest, are rare. I tried it once, and have never&#xD;
complained of my husband since." And think you,&#xD;
reader, that Major Gldhuck ever regretted his wife at-&#xD;
tended that auction ~2 They have lived happily ever&#xD;
since, and not a reproachful word has escaped her lips.&#xD;

TILE EXPRESSMAN.&#xD;
How things change in this world! Hart, the stage-&#xD;
driver, issucceeded by Adams, the expressman. Now, the&#xD;
duties belonging to both these departments are very oner-&#xD;
ous. Nobody fully realizes the importance of the calling of&#xD;
the expressman, who has not lived in a country village.&#xD;
Just sat yourself down, during a season, in a seven-by-&#xD;
nine village, where there are some half-dozen dress-makers,&#xD;
two or three milliners, a few grocers, and two* or three&#xD;
dry goods' shops ; one lawyer, a Universalist, a Metho-&#xD;
dist, Freewill Baptist and a Calvinist minister, whose&#xD;
whole members, put into one house, would make a barely&#xD;
respectable congregation. But there i~ but one express-&#xD;
man to attend to all the calls of this little heap of people.&#xD;
The milliner wants to match that shade of silk, or to&#xD;
exchange a few shawls she purchased yesterday, for&#xD;
another set of colors, and she has an errand to be done&#xD;
she entirely forgot when in tfre city; and the dress-maker&#xD;
wants a new cloak-pattern she has seen advertised, and&#xD;
she negotiates with the expressman to get it for seventy-&#xD;
five cents, because she is one of the trade, and ought to&#xD;
be considered; and a great trouble comes out of this.&#xD;
The pattern-seller insists on her dollar; says she knows~&#xD;
only one prices and "Miss Bond" is a dress-maker of whom&#xD;
&#xD;
she never heard, and, after the poor fellow has haggled&#xD;
away his precious half-hour, and paid the full price, he&#xD;
must run down on Long Wharf and deliver Mr. Grocer's&#xD;
order, and out into Elm-street to speak for some dried&#xD;
fruit; and this reminds him the widow Ellery spoke to&#xD;
him a week ago to get her a drum of figs and a box of&#xD;
raisins. Then he must hurry to Washington-street, and&#xD;
leave an order from the dry goods' store for two pieces of&#xD;
nice black silk, to be delivered -~ at a dollar per yard -&#xD;
and the~ partner who sold it "is down town," and there&#xD;
is nobody who knows anything about such a piece; and&#xD;
then Sophia Blake wants a short lace veil, and Sally Slack&#xD;
sent for a pair of corsets, and the measure was lost!&#xD;
Squire Low wanted some blanks and forms for land&#xD;
conveyances, besides a quire of ruled paper and a small,&#xD;
cheap blank book. Gershoni Allen sent for a pair of&#xD;
chickens, "first chop; "and Solomon Twist wanted a shoul-&#xD;
der of mutton. Tom ]3owen desired the expressmau to&#xD;
step into ]3oardman's and get a gallon of pure ~Coguac,&#xD;
and a dozen of Champagne, "Cilley's brand." Mr.&#xD;
Wyeth has not received his newspaper regularly, and&#xD;
sends to the office to get back numbers, and to know the&#xD;
cause of his not receiving them by mail. Old lady Con-&#xD;
~tant wants a few gift books, under price, for Christmas~&#xD;
and New-Year's presents to her grand-chiLdren, and like-&#xD;
wise to know what good, strong gingham umbrellas are&#xD;
worth. lie might give fifty cents for a prime article,&#xD;
with nice whalebone sticks! Nancy Gerrish wants a&#xD;
muff and boa, but limits the price to five dollars; and&#xD;

down by Cragie's bridge, for a hat-case; at 'the West&#xD;
End to deliver a package, and at the North 1~nd for Mrs.&#xD;
~iy's cloak."&#xD;
Now, all these errands are expected to be done pre.&#xD;
wisely as they are directed, and the small sum of nine-&#xD;
pence is considered a fair charge; but woe to the man&#xD;
'who' fbrg~ts a single message!&#xD;
Besides, it is expected the expr~ssman will carry about&#xD;
him a sunny countenance, never get vexed with anybody,&#xD;
thank everybody instead of receiving thanks, know&#xD;
£~eryonej and be willing to oN.ige everybody,' because it&#xD;
isId* business. No matter how many flouting remarks&#xD;
axe made to him, he is not expected to resent them; and,&#xD;
although he is the most importaiit personage in the vil-&#xD;
lage',- better than clergyman, lawyer or representative,&#xD;
all ~f whom conld be spared, and not be half as much&#xD;
missed,-~-~.yet every idle man in the village feels competent&#xD;
to' undertake the business of an expressman. In truth,&#xD;
it is an important office, and he who fills it satisfactorily,&#xD;
mnst be a. shrewd, good-natured, obliging, self-su1~cient,&#xD;
all-sufficient, but by no means an insujlicient man.&#xD;

PHASES IN MARRIED LIFE.&#xD;
ONE may well be amused at the changes which come&#xD;
over some people's domestic and connubial bliss. When&#xD;
we first knew Mr. Fennel, he was a young man of quite&#xD;
prepossessing appearance; at that time he was engaged&#xD;
to Angeline Bright. ' I seem to see them now, starting&#xD;
off at early twilight for a walk. Most lovingly and coseyly&#xD;
did they lag along, seeming to have an inexhaustible&#xD;
fund of conversation; so that, after being together till&#xD;
midnight, ten chances to one they would agree to see&#xD;
each other before noon the next day.&#xD;
By and by Mr. Fennel married. There never was a&#xD;
more agreeable honeymoon passed this side of the celes-&#xD;
tial regions. They seemed to enjoy each 9ther's society&#xD;
far better than any other; now they rode out every&#xD;
afternoon, and the old counting-room was deserted, after&#xD;
three~ o'clock, by the junior partner, much to the annoy.~&#xD;
ance of the senior one, who used to prophesy, "these&#xD;
~things will wear off by and by, when they have been mar-:&#xD;
ned a few years." The man spoke from experience, and&#xD;
he spoke truly.&#xD;
Fifteen years after marriage, you might have seen Mr.&#xD;
Fennel still taking a walk, but hi~ d4ugkter is hanging&#xD;

little boy. The poor woman seems to have lost that&#xD;
elastic step she once had; she looks faded and care..&#xD;
worn, and talks about "Willy's fretfulness, having just&#xD;
cut his teeth;" and "Margaret Ann is feeble, arid they&#xD;
apprehend a spinal difficulty;" and if you. inquire why&#xD;
they do not go into the couritry and try a change, she&#xD;
will answer, "Bless me, Mr. Fennel is so, busy at the&#xD;
store, I scarcely see him from morning till night!"&#xD;
I don't know what ails the man, but he is so abstracted&#xD;
he never gives a positive answer to anybody but his cus~&#xD;
timers, and his wif~, when she inquires if it will be con-&#xD;
venient to replenish her purse. An old friend occasion-&#xD;
ally tells him what a fool he is to be so absorbed in&#xD;
husiz~ess; that his wife is much changed, and really&#xD;
looks like an invalid. This for a moment touches him in&#xD;
a tender spo~. Perhaps he thinks, if she should die, what&#xD;
a terrible expense it would be to procure a housekeeper,&#xD;
and how much of his time it would take to oversee the&#xD;
household the very thing which has worn her down.&#xD;
~o he buys a horse and carriage, and resolves he 'will&#xD;
give the family an airing once or twice a wee]t He&#xD;
thinks once in the middle ,of the week, and sunday&#xD;
afternoon, he can spare to drive them in the suburbs.&#xD;
But now he is so delighted with his new horse, he ex-&#xD;
pects all the family to be continually talking about his&#xD;
good qualities. The children soon get tired of such fre~&#xD;
quent rides, and beg the privilege of staying at home,&#xD;
and playing with some of their school-fellows.&#xD;
The next year, Mr. Fenuei~ carries his wife to ride in&#xD;
a chaise. She is mu~h emaciated; and has a hollow cough&#xD;
now.,, ~till, he is m~eustomed to it, and, as she isiuueoni.~&#xD;
&#xD;
planning, he does not apprehend anything more than a con&#xD;
stituttonal ailment. And as they ride, she is weary and&#xD;
does not dare to talk; and he is thinking about some bad&#xD;
debts, or about dismissing his book-keeper; and when&#xD;
she inquires who lives in some splendid palace which they&#xD;
are passing by, he invariably answers, "I am sure I&#xD;
dunno;" then, perchance, he gives a long gape. How&#xD;
interesting!&#xD;
Mrs. Fennel won't live a great while, but still there is&#xD;
no fear but he can get another companion, "he is such a&#xD;
nice man, and so attentive to his business." Lady&#xD;

"AND SO FORTH."&#xD;
TRtaY, a mighty wide margin should be allowed for&#xD;
all "and so forth" includes. It gives the closing zest to&#xD;
~irnch of some people's conversation; it is the finale of the&#xD;
speechmaker, the end of the delineator, and affords the&#xD;
most ample field in which the imagination can riot. And&#xD;
yet what sources of contention it has opened I All the&#xD;
letters in the alphabet may be joined together, and their&#xD;
exact meaning plainly indicated; but and so forth is&#xD;
married to no letter, and so his bachelorship is quoted,&#xD;
and made subservient to all purposes. A friend engages&#xD;
board; he stipulates the terms, and the host enumerates&#xD;
privileges, "&amp;amp;c." The lover adds to his long epistle of&#xD;
proposal that he hopes one day to be forever united,&#xD;
where they shall realize one blissful dream amidst matri-&#xD;
monial comforts, "&amp;amp;e."&#xD;
Now, although nothing is expressed in this winding&#xD;
up, yet everything is understood. The man procuring&#xD;
board sees a long array of agreeable privileges, which it&#xD;
is ne~'er intended he should realize. The disposer of a&#xD;
cargo includes many items in the termination with which&#xD;
the owner will never be furnished; the lover winds up&#xD;
with a delightful anticipation which may be dissipated in&#xD;
imagination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Whoever would give the definition of "4'~c.," would&#xD;
confer a great blessing upon posterity. It certainly is&#xD;
taken to mean a great deal, and it is used as the excuse&#xD;
to mean nothing. And yet it is such a graceful close;&#xD;
it so helps out a forgetful orator; it so finely finishes a&#xD;
windy paragraph; it so exquisitely furnishes what one&#xD;
dislikes to enumerate, and it gives such a pledge without&#xD;
an obligation, that, were all the lexicographers in the&#xD;
world to agree to set it aside, it could no more be done&#xD;
than to quench the light of day.&#xD;
There must be stops, windings-up of passages, a time&#xD;
when eloquence boconies weary, when the man of letters&#xD;
concludes, and, "with sentiments of heailfelt esteem,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c.," breaks off abruptly, and yet satisfies the most&#xD;
fastidious critic. And yet there are times when this&#xD;
much-quoted word is never applied. It never finishes a&#xD;
prayer, nor affords a close to a sermon; it is not inserted&#xD;
in a note of hand, nor in a will; and if by chance it enters&#xD;
into a long, undischarged bill of goods, there is much care-&#xD;
ful research to interpret its meaning. So, like many&#xD;
good things which we both use and abuse, it has its place,&#xD;
and when used aright helps finish up a long array of&#xD;
wearisome details. Therefore, we commend and so&#xD;
forth to all sweeping paragraph-writers, all elaborate&#xD;
sentence-makers, all hurried correspondents, all disconso.&#xD;
late lovers, all advertisers of real estate, personal proper-&#xD;
ty, and whatever is wearisome in the whole catalogue of&#xD;
minute enumerations.&#xD;

hands, and burned fingers, and excrescences, which "Russia&#xD;
Salve" purports to heal and mollify; and there is a long&#xD;
catalogue of unmitigated suffering, notwithstanding thou-&#xD;
sands of pamphlets are thrown into every vestibule,&#xD;
counting-room, shop and dwelling, where poor humanity&#xD;
sits on stilts, or is prostrate on beds, or reclines on sofas,&#xD;
or stretches out in recumbent chairs.&#xD;
So, a fine day is not always a guaranty of fine feel-&#xD;
ing8. There is a poor, wasted skeleton of a man; and as&#xD;
the wind flows balmily from, the south-west, he concludes&#xD;
1~ venture a few paces from his home. He puts en his&#xD;
&#xD;
$UJ3STA~cE AND SHADQw$.&#xD;
&#xD;
heavy overcoat, and stout boots, and thick mumer, and&#xD;
draws his hat pretty snugly over his forehead, az~d, at a&#xD;
snail's pace, assisted by the use of a large cjane, he ap-&#xD;
preaches you. You kindly inquire for his health, and&#xD;
congratulate him upon being visible on the sidewalk'&#xD;
but, alas! he coughs before he articulates a reply, tells&#xD;
you he is almost afraid he is overdoing; that he has&#xD;
not ate the value of a biscuit for a week, and thanks of&#xD;
trying the effect of the water-ei9ire treatment. Well, he&#xD;
needs the rubbing, and dousing, and chafing, and exer-&#xD;
cising of that kind treatment. Awhile hence, leafy June&#xD;
sends you to his place of sojourn, and you will see a man&#xD;
wi.th a brisk trot, unbandaged, sucking in all the aromatic&#xD;
fragrance he can inhale from the blossoms of trees and&#xD;
the scent of perfumed flowers, and he wonders why you&#xD;
stare so long in his face; tells you he has advanced&#xD;
fifty per cent.; that his life can now be insured at a far&#xD;
less premium than formerly; that he eats mush and milk,&#xD;
dines on baked potatoes, and sups on tea and Graham&#xD;
bread; that he walks fourteen miles a day, always feels&#xD;
* cheerful, and yet calculates on a return to the city a well&#xD;
man!&#xD;
That invalid, too, over the way, who has been wrecked&#xD;
all winter, swollen with the rheumatism, diseased 'in&#xD;
the liver, lame, weak-visioned, a victim to poultices&#xD;
and pills, whose physician has made him a daily visit for&#xD;
three months past, has sallied out this fine morning. He&#xD;
tells you, he feels encouraged; that his laix~eness is&#xD;
better; that he is trying a new cure for the liver com-&#xD;
plaint, and, as warm weather approaches, he has full con-&#xD;
fidence his bodily ailments will be mitigated, perhaps&#xD;

entirely leave him. A fire kindles in his eye as he&#xD;
anticipates his future well-being; and. if the hope but&#xD;
continues buoyant, he will soon dismiss. his physician,&#xD;
ride into the country, live on dandelions, snuff the breeze,&#xD;
and bid defiance to disease.&#xD;
But invalids alone are not on the promenade. Can-&#xD;
vass the streets where dry-goods' establishments have&#xD;
advertised "$pring fashions opened this morning," and&#xD;
witness the rush! There is the glitter of silks, satins,&#xD;
and brocades; the fresh sunshade just mounted for the&#xD;
season, which overshadows the last unique pattern hat,&#xD;
made so flaringly open that the rich, ponderous ear-rings&#xD;
are distinctly visible, creating a kind of thrill lest their&#xD;
weight shall slit down the ear and cause an advertise&#xD;
inent of "lost," in to-morrow's newspaper.&#xD;
Verily, says the perambulator, this is an age of gold.&#xD;
Our bachelor friend walked in behind the show at one of&#xD;
these immense windows which exhibited the "very last&#xD;
styles." "What is the price of this mantilla?" inquired&#xD;
a young, economical miss. "Only forty dollars," replied&#xD;
the shopman; "decidedly cheap, a great bargain." It&#xD;
was taken! " And of this wrought handkerchief 3"&#xD;
"Only twenty-five." What! thought he, as a heavy&#xD;
roll was disgorged from her port monnaie. As he went&#xD;
out he jostled against velvets, blonde lace, gaudy jewelry,&#xD;
pointed remarks as well as collars, and, in a fit of despera~&#xD;
tiQn, concluded he would stand the "landlady's rise on&#xD;
board" some time longer, rather than venture into the&#xD;
sea of extravagance which this fine morning had revealed&#xD;
tohini.&#xD;
&#xD;
SOILED GARMENTS.&#xD;
WITH what care we bedeck our persons, and, if about&#xD;
to enter the presence of a distinguished individual, how&#xD;
shocked we should be to appear with soiled garments!&#xD;
And, then, with what nice discrimination we put on the&#xD;
apparel suited to the occasion!&#xD;
But, while, we are so studious about the ~tuter man,&#xD;
how is it with the inner temple 3 Are we careful about&#xD;
the. soil or spots here? How happened we to wink at&#xD;
that fraud to evade justice and secure wealth 3 Why&#xD;
did we yield to that resentment, and thus cause a brother&#xD;
to sin, and ourself to be the subject of recrimination 3&#xD;
How came we to speak unkindly of that man, about&#xD;
whom we ought to have been silent 3 Why that hasty&#xD;
word in the family. 3 I fear we are not clean within,&#xD;
however we practise outward ablutions.&#xD;
If but half the time and attention we bestow upon&#xD;
the body was given to correcting, purifying, and regen-&#xD;
erating the soul, one-half ,of our bodily maladies would&#xD;
be obviated. A pure soul never exists in an impure&#xD;
body; but we dare not reverse the rule, it will not&#xD;
bold. The physician gives the recipe for the earthly&#xD;
malady. Christ came to give, the specific that would heal&#xD;

THE BROKEN PROMISES.&#xD;
"BUT .physical airments, Mr. Tompkins, admonish me&#xD;
that I am not long for this world, and I do wish, hus~&#xD;
band, you would make me one promise. I know I shall&#xD;
not be here long, my dear." Her voice grew very&#xD;
plaintive, and Mr. Tompkins was obliged to hear her.&#xD;
"Well, what is it that I must promise, to make you&#xD;
happy, wife; anything reasonable V'&#xD;
'"Now, that is the way you always answer me. So&#xD;
cavalierly, so unfeelingly, and in such a coarse way. I&#xD;
tell you again, I shall not be here long. You are a&#xD;
rugged man, Mr. Tompkins, and know but little of my&#xD;
physical ails, I tell you."&#xD;
"Pho, nonsense! You are nervous, wife. Go out,&#xD;
take the air, brace up a little, and the vapors will quit&#xD;
their hold."&#xD;
"Butr that promise, husband 'U'&#xD;
"Well, now for it."&#xD;
"Will you promise me, sincerely,, as God spares your&#xD;
life, if I should die, that you will never marry again?&#xD;
You know how many girls would be glad to step. in my&#xD;
shoes; how many widows would like the privilege of&#xD;
sitting in ~z~/ drawing-rooms,-those ~beautiful rooms,&#xD;
all hung in tapestry, and thb~e hri~ht ~haudolirs gus-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ended, looking just as good as new, if they were bought&#xD;
at auction. My worsted work, too~ 0, I could not&#xD;
bear to know that anybody should own it after me! But&#xD;
I am going to a better place, I trust. Heaven, they say,&#xD;
is paved with gold! It will be. hard to leave you,&#xD;
husband; but I know you will soon follow. Now, prom-&#xD;
ise me faithfully that you will never marry again, but&#xD;
keep everything just as I leave it, which shall be in good&#xD;
order. Will you ~"&#xD;
"On condition, wife, that, if I should die, you will&#xD;
observe the same injunction. You know how many&#xD;
young men are dancing attendance on rich widows ;. how&#xD;
many who have lost their wives would like to wear my&#xD;
coats, and pants, and satin vests. Now, you will keep&#xD;
them always hanging in the closets, just as I left them,&#xD;
and never let my wrought slippers be put upon another&#xD;
man's foot."&#xD;
"Certainly, Mr. Tompkins; but that event will&#xD;
never happen in my day. You will live long after me."&#xD;
The promises being thus mutually exchanged, Mrs.&#xD;
Tompkins seemed to revive, She' procured a bottle or&#xD;
two of specifics for hypochondriacs, and really grew so&#xD;
much better as to propose a journey. The autumn fob&#xD;
lowing, she broke out in a European fever, and Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Tompkins were registered as having taken passage&#xD;
for Liverpool.&#xD;
New sights so engrossed her attention, new faces so&#xD;
won her heart, new cookery so improved her appetite,&#xD;

how her neighbors stared, as they accosted her with, "Can&#xD;
this be you, Mrs. Tompkins 3"&#xD;
But Providence and man are not alike in their designs.&#xD;
Mr. Tompkins had gr~wn thin, had a cough, a pain&#xD;
through the ~ho~lder~, little appetite, a~id great debility.&#xD;
He was consumptively inclined, but remarkably resigned to&#xD;
his situation. And now gossip abounded; some affirmed&#xD;
he had lived a wearisome life with his wife; some said' they&#xD;
"could tell things," but would not; others, who were in&#xD;
her confidence, shook their heads, and said they "never&#xD;
criminated church members;" for Mrs. Tompkins was a&#xD;
very pious woman. But, at length, the man died, and the&#xD;
bereaved widow lamented loudly, and begged the sexton&#xD;
to see that all things were done in good order, and in-&#xD;
sisted to know if he really believed the body could be&#xD;
kept two days. She sent for an artist, had his picture&#xD;
taken, bought the finest bombazine. dress, had a mantilla&#xD;
trimmed with the deepest folds of crape, wore a blinding&#xD;
veil, and cried as if her heart would break. She went to&#xD;
Probate, administered herself on the estate, lived in her&#xD;
own drawing-rooms, kept her servants, but complained&#xD;
bitterly of loneliness. She was always at church meet-&#xD;
ings, always wept, or held up her handkerchief, when the&#xD;
good man prayed that "afflictions might be sanctified,"&#xD;
and, in short, the. widow Tompkins, With her fortune of&#xD;
two hundred thousand, without "chick or child" to&#xD;
share it, was quite a prominent character in the mouths&#xD;
of sundry widowers and forlorn stricken'bachelors. For&#xD;
two f41 months she wore the veil down. It was.said she&#xD;
was observed to draw it aside very slightly; then a little&#xD;
f~i~tli~r, till, finally, ~he ,threw it over the crown of her&#xD;
&#xD;
bonnet, just as parson Boneset repeated the text, "For&#xD;
our light afflictions, which are but for a moment," &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
That night Deacon Sears called. But how excusa-&#xD;
ble was his visit! His wife died suddenly, "but full&#xD;
of hope;" and how natural that his sympathies should&#xD;
be drawn towards the widow, full of hope likewise!&#xD;
Mrs. Tompkins was always at the prayer-meetings, and&#xD;
Deacon Sears always exhorted; and how natural it was&#xD;
he should seq the widow home; and, when he got to the&#xD;
door, how' natural that he should step in; and, when&#xD;
fairly in, how natural to stay, disliking to leave good&#xD;
company! Depend on it, then, matters were talked over&#xD;
between the members, and some inferences were drawn;&#xD;
but, curious enough, the deacon had promised Mrs.&#xD;
Sears, in the event of her death, he would ne~'er marry&#xD;
again! This promise was extorted before sundry wit-&#xD;
nesses, and they were all living, and ready to testify to&#xD;
the fact. The deacon was a man of truth, and ~he parish&#xD;
generally thought him to be relied on. One person went&#xD;
so far as to say to the widow Tompkins, aside from this&#xD;
promise, she did believe he had serious intentions;&#xD;
whereupon the widow grew faint, and was revived only by&#xD;
sal-volatile. Here were two pledges made Vo dead people;&#xD;
could they violate them 3 Was there any validity in&#xD;
them 3 Grave questions were discussed in the public&#xD;
meetings, whether certain promises were obligatory;&#xD;
whether the dead took cognizance of the actions of the&#xD;
living; and whether the spirits of our departed friends&#xD;
were hovering over us mortals 3 These topics led to&#xD;
much metaphysical discussion; but the deacon always&#xD;
opposed the doctrine of personal recognition hereafter.&#xD;

We shall all be blessed in the mass, was his favorite&#xD;
theory. still it wore upon him. The widow grew more&#xD;
and more attractive. Just so far as repelling forces&#xD;
diverged from the centre, the power of gravitation in~&#xD;
creased, and Mr. Boneset was requested to deliver a&#xD;
lecture upon moral obligations.&#xD;
The divine took the ground that all promises made in&#xD;
good faith were strictly binding; that death rather&#xD;
sealed than annulled them; that the accusing spirit&#xD;
might so torment a man who wilfully broke such an&#xD;
engagement, as to be his perpetual misery in a future&#xD;
state, besides the disquietude incident to existence here.&#xD;
This was a poser. Matters grew worse and worse; but,&#xD;
finally, taking shelter under the old maxim, "that a bad&#xD;
promise is~ better broken than kept," Deacon sears and&#xD;
widow Tompkins took advantage of our new law, and&#xD;
were married.&#xD;

"I NEVER will marry Mr. Sinclair, ma,- so you may as&#xD;
well drop the subject as not. Do you suppose I '11 have&#xD;
a mechanic for a beau,~when Sophia Marshall, and Sally&#xD;
Edes, and all my associates, have young gentlemen to&#xD;
wait on them 3 Look at his coarse hands; they are too&#xD;
big for a kid glove there is~ not a pair imported of&#xD;
sufficient size for him. I never will marry huiA, and you&#xD;

"But, my dear, Tom Emery has only a small salary,&#xD;
and you never need think your father will countenance&#xD;
him. Why, child, should you slight a mechanic I Your&#xD;
father was a journeyman carpenter once."&#xD;
"Mother, 1 '11 hold my ears if you tell me that again.&#xD;
I 'ye been mGrtified enough to hear father tell every&#xD;
young gentleman that comes hers, about his beginnings,&#xD;
and being b9und to old Mr. Gragg as an apprentice. I&#xD;
really left the room the other evening, it was so painful&#xD;
Certainly he was a mastpr-builder before he retired, and&#xD;
neyer worked any; he only rode round in his chaise, and&#xD;
superintended his workmen."&#xD;

up, and we girls cannot dress like other people? I 'in&#xD;
sure, I 'in tired to death with hearing about how you&#xD;

the fashions."&#xD;
"If you should accept Mr. Sinclair, Hitty, I have no&#xD;
doubt but your father would give you a handsome house,&#xD;
and furnish it beautifully, and do everything you wish;&#xD;
but if you disobey him and marry a worthless rake, you&#xD;
alone must"bear the consequences; but I enjoin it upon&#xD;
you, child, 'to look before you leap.'"&#xD;
Sinclair was the son of a worthy mechanic, and chose&#xD;
his father's occupation; but he was well educated, and&#xD;
had just offered himself to Hitty, the retired ~, master-&#xD;
builder's daughter, and many people thought he had&#xD;
made a great mistake.&#xD;
Torn Emery was a clerk at two hundred and fifty dol-&#xD;

threw bouquets at Signorina Teresa Parodi, carried a gold&#xD;
opera-glass, a perfumed handkerchief and gold-headed&#xD;
cane, was cultivating a moustache, whiskers and an im-&#xD;
perial, and, above all, did not work for a living; he&#xD;
only sold goods, and changed places aboi~it once a month.&#xD;
Yet Ilitty thought "he was divine!"&#xD;
"I should feel pretty, ma," said she, one day, "to be&#xD;
seated in my velvet chair, or be in the street with my&#xD;
* velvet cloak, and meet Sinclair with his working..dress&#xD;
on. I 'm sure I would not bow to him. What would&#xD;
Effle Grieves think of me?"&#xD;
"You talk very foolishly, child. Sinclair has a mind&#xD;
and purse as far above your dandy beaux as the donie is&#xD;
above the steps of the ee-hou~e.~'&#xD;
&#xD;
"But look at his hands, ma,- those awful big hands,-&#xD;
and his smooth face! 0, dear! say no more to me about&#xD;
Sinclair. Mr. Emery, ma, is a beauty, and pa had bet-&#xD;
ter not oppose me too, much - 4iere are more ways than&#xD;
'one to get married."&#xD;
The mother wiped her eyes, and secretly wished "girls&#xD;
had not such silly notions."&#xD;
The mother said to her husband that evening -.-" If our&#xD;
Hitty, pa, should marry Tom Emery, I hope you will&#xD;
make the best of it."&#xD;
The old man rattled his paper, and pretended not to&#xD;
hear a word.&#xD;
A few days after this the dear child was missing. The&#xD;
morning journal told the cause of her disappearance,&#xD;
and there was a very afflicted household, where slie had&#xD;
been the pet and pride of maternal love.&#xD;
Formal intelligence has, however, been transmitted to&#xD;
her parents that "Mr. and Mrs. Emery have secured&#xD;
board at one of our first hotels on their return," and the&#xD;
fond mother is pondering whether it will do to hint to&#xD;
"father" about the expediency of taking them home!&#xD;

BIJEBLEISM."&#xD;
MR. CEPHAS BUI3BLE is undeniably the "fastest"&#xD;
young man in the market; for he is not only ashamed&#xD;
of his parentage and birth-place, but he is actually&#xD;
aeh~med that he was ever a boy! You never heard&#xD;
him quote "what he did when a child ; " indeed, we&#xD;
have no very authentic record that he ever was a child!&#xD;
lie was a young man when we first knew him, which&#xD;
was some twenty years ago, and he styles himself such,&#xD;
now. When we first made his acpiaintauce he was about1&#xD;
exchanging a clerkship for "one of the firm." It was&#xD;
more manly to work for one's self; and so the poor fellow&#xD;
rushed headlong into business without capital, and, as is&#xD;
usual, experienced the disagreeable dose of not being&#xD;
able to face his creditors; but, having passed through&#xD;
the ordeal of bankruptcy, he was prepared to be a&#xD;
"shrewd speculator,'.' and some days could count his&#xD;
thousands, and some days only his coppers!&#xD;
But he somehow always continued to, keep in the&#xD;
fashion. He was the "nice young man," in the estima-&#xD;
tion of all the fairest of creation; and no concert, party&#xD;
or lecture, was accounted quite so pleasant "as those&#xD;
which Mr. Bubble attended;" for he had a most prodi-&#xD;
gious fund of small talk.&#xD;
&#xD;
The fact that Mr. Bubble remained a single man un-&#xD;
doubtedly increased his acquaintances, and made him a&#xD;
more popular man. And yet parents used to caution&#xD;
their daughters about being "engage~tto such fellows as&#xD;
Bubble," and, at the same time, they never failed to&#xD;
invite him to partake of their hospitalities! Although&#xD;
often unsuccessful in his financial operations, he was&#xD;
called "shrewd," "well posted," &amp;amp;c., becaaise he always&#xD;
dashed headlong into and through everything.&#xD;
True he had been in all sorts of society, and had a&#xD;
smattering of all kinds of phraseology, which adapted&#xD;
him to all varieties of company. He knew the phrases&#xD;
on change and in the drawing-room, in the lecture and&#xD;
at the opera; and, by the right application of terms,&#xD;
it was astonishing how often sound was taken for&#xD;
sense.&#xD;
He was always at home in a "panic" gotten up by&#xD;
brokers; could be a " bull" or a "bear," as best fitted&#xD;
his positions could put on his nice white kids and call on&#xD;
the Misses Flambeaus, and converse about the "en-&#xD;
chanting belle of last evening's party," and tell "how&#xD;
divinely Miss Popinjay looked, at the opera;" could&#xD;
bow and twirl his gloves, and pat down his huge mous-&#xD;
tache after a hearty laugh with the ladies ;~ and at. the&#xD;
lecture-room he could sit with his rolling eyes upon the&#xD;
fair assembly, and ogle, and give a pleasant simper and&#xD;
a graceful recognition fo many of the upper-ten; while&#xD;
not a few exclaimed, as they sought him in the crowd:&#xD;
" There 's Mr. Bubble, Nelly;" "There 's that pleas-&#xD;
ant fellow, Bubble, liatty; " all showing how popular&#xD;
he was becoming.&#xD;

And then Mr. Bubble was the pink of fashion. Yery&#xD;
early in the season you might see him promenading,&#xD;
dressed a Ia mode. If "adder-skin pantaloons" were in&#xD;
vogue, you mightke sure Mr. Bubble had been seen with&#xD;
them; if they were flowing ortightly compressed to the skin,&#xD;
long or short, why, look at Bubble,- that determined&#xD;
how they ought to be worn. If the dress-coat was short,&#xD;
or the frock or sack were only a round-about; if the vest&#xD;
were open and long, or close and short; and if Congress&#xD;
half-boots or French red-tops were the fashion, Mr. Bub-&#xD;
ble had been out.&#xD;
But who was his tailor ~ Nobody knew, because, if&#xD;
they had, the precise article might have been "com-&#xD;
mon, "-.~-as it was, only an imitation could be selected.&#xD;
He always spoke of his clothes being made in London;&#xD;
and it was remarked that nobody ever wore a dickey that&#xD;
sat so perfectly as did Bubble's. There did not seem to&#xD;
be anything difficult in attaining to the perfection of cut-&#xD;
ting out one bit of linen like another - but how many&#xD;
hundreds failed in the experiment to do so! The differ-&#xD;
ence was, Bubble's never wrinkled, never confined his&#xD;
neck to a straight-ahead look, never broke down when&#xD;
suddenly called to look on one side, never fa~1ed to be&#xD;
graduated to the neck it enclosed. And, whose shirt-&#xD;
bosom ever sat like Cephas Bubble's '? J)id you ever&#xD;
see it ballooning out, or so tightly drawn down as to&#xD;
make him round-shouldered for its accommodation ~ I&#xD;
think not. Yet who made these articles nobody knew, and&#xD;
he would never sell the recipe any more than the one by&#xD;
which he had gained his reputation for being a "shrewd&#xD;
fellow!"&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Bubble is generally placed upon "lecture corn-*.&#xD;
mittees," "associations for the moral improvement of&#xD;
young men," upon "fancy grounds," "laying out circu-&#xD;
lar paths," "widening and bordering walks;" and it is&#xD;
supposed, by some, he was the architect of many of our&#xD;
public buildings, where the finances were not commensu-&#xD;
rate to the undertakings, for many unique models of&#xD;
churches have been found in his old portfolio. Perhaps&#xD;
this attempt at designing may have originated in his con-&#xD;
stant effort to promote the progress of the age, having,&#xD;
as he does, a profound contempt for the old, prudent&#xD;
characters who caught the spirit of those who landed in&#xD;
the "Mayflower."&#xD;
But Mr. Bubble meets with serious opposition. He&#xD;
desires an alteration in our constitution, so that younger&#xD;
men may be eligible to office, and an "amendment" that&#xD;
a retiracy to private life may be enforced at the age of&#xD;
fifty, for he has been but thirty-two for the last ten&#xD;
years. He has "thought abput being married" ever&#xD;
since we knew him; but probably fearing it might lessen&#xD;
him in the esteem of the frequenters at fashionable re-&#xD;
sorts, he has conchided not to pay the penalty.&#xD;
lit may seem too personal a matter to point directly to&#xD;
him where he is sure to be seen - but ask any inveterate&#xD;
attendant upon operas or popular lectures, to point him&#xD;
out, and it can be done. He purposes, however, to leave&#xD;
the city as soon as he ascertains which will be the most&#xD;
fashionable summer resort, and if he finds it is decidedly&#xD;
"vulgar" to stay in America (as some anticipate), he&#xD;
holds himself in readiness to "go abroad."&#xD;

worth, and how much tax he pays; whether he is an epi-&#xD;
cure, and how much he has invested in good securities&#xD;
and bad stocks; and where the certainty is not known,&#xD;
the guess alWays supplies the want. No wonder the man&#xD;

LIFE IN THE COUNTRY.&#xD;
LET no one imagine he has leen in the country,&#xD;
~ho has taken a drive around the suburbs of a city. All&#xD;
such places are but so many miniature cities, where the&#xD;
same fashions, works of art and decorations of nature, are&#xD;
everywhere visible. To go into the country means to sit&#xD;
in the cars three or four hours, and then find yourself&#xD;
landed at a depot where the woods rise before and behind&#xD;
you; where the people stare at every stranger who&#xD;
alights, and where curiosity is excited to know your&#xD;
whereabouts and your business. Then take a steady&#xD;
family horse, and drive to some farm-house, where primi-&#xD;
tive rocks surround the premises, and all the hedges are&#xD;
the growth of uncultivated natur~. Step into the interior,&#xD;
where diva~us and luxurious couches never stood, but,&#xD;
instead thereof~ a yellow-painted, hard floor, with a bed&#xD;
upturned in the corner, an antiquated fireplace, and&#xD;
relics of other days in thick profusion strew the way&#xD;
and here you may gain a~ taste for rural pleasures. The&#xD;
gay routine of cit life enters not here; the morning&#xD;
call is never made; the brocade is never needed; all you&#xD;
have to do is simply to yield yourself* to the sweet inlu-&#xD;
ences about you.~ For fragrance, you can lay aside the&#xD;
elegant perfume, and substitute the refreshing incense&#xD;

Anon, the rain pours in torrents, and the tender plants&#xD;

But the most enchanting rainbow appears, in a grace-&#xD;

where its varied colors are only visible between columns&#xD;
of brick, but the glorious arch we have described. And&#xD;
now for a stroll by the river-side. See the rushing, foam-&#xD;

like a dashing cataract. You wonder at the imagination&#xD;
of the friend by your side, who. speaks of the fine mill&#xD;
privilege here presented, and tells you how a dam&#xD;
could be constructed and a fall obtained to carry so&#xD;
many thousand spindles! Just so with yonder grassy&#xD;
valley, it is so verdant and peaceful, the birds carol&#xD;
so sweetly, and, the fire-flies flit so numerously at even-&#xD;
ing's dewy coming, that it seems a cold calculation that&#xD;
talks only about a warm, fertile soil, which is capable&#xD;
of producing so many bushels of grain!&#xD;
You feel that rural pleasures have not deadened all&#xD;
love of gain, nor made plodders of the soil insensible to&#xD;
the value of the land they~ till. The same specimens&#xD;
of humanity are found the world over, and it is best&#xD;
it should be so. We, too, with all our enthusiasm,&#xD;
should soon see the sun rise without much emotion, and&#xD;
the birds sing without heeding whether it be a golden&#xD;
robin or a tiny sparrow. The fragrance of the fields&#xD;
would be inhaled by degrees with insensibility, and the&#xD;
supply of our animal wants would gain the ascendency,&#xD;
and the glowing rapture which the change from a city&#xD;
to a country life awakened, would lose its fre8h delight,&#xD;

and we, too, should sink into apathy amidst the glori-&#xD;
ous manifestations of nature's curious workmanship. ~o&#xD;
we will hie back again to our busy metropolis, ere the&#xD;
charm has faded from our hearts.&#xD;
As we were .sketching the life of the old-fashioned&#xD;
farmer, we were struck with the dissimilar position of him&#xD;
who ranks under the same title in the neighborhood of&#xD;
our city. Our suburban farmer cannot often boast of his&#xD;
hundred acres, iior yet of his heavy wood lot; he has&#xD;
no "sheep pastures," nor land unfit for productive labor;&#xD;
if so, his prolific imagination riots over the expediency&#xD;
of "lotting"it, and causing a village to spring up in a&#xD;
day. His vegetables are carefully tended, not to minis-&#xD;
ter to his own palate, but to adorn with their dewy fresh-&#xD;
ness some showy stall in yonder market. That cultivated&#xD;
bed of strawberries is scarcely tasted at home; but children&#xD;
are employed to pick for "boxing." Alas, for the rich&#xD;
cream in his dairy! that, too, must be bottled, and made&#xD;
to swell the amount of~ .his yearly gains; the asparagus~&#xD;
bed, the early potato-patch, the corn so early ripened,&#xD;
the long catalogue we class as "kitchen vegetables," all&#xD;
are fostered and. protected4 and hastened to ripen, to&#xD;
administer to other palates.&#xD;
We were lately consulting with a friend, who lives on&#xD;
such a farm as we have described, respecting board for&#xD;
the summer. lie was a frank wan, and assured us, if we&#xD;
were calculating upon enjoying or feasting upon the&#xD;
product of his vines, that we should soon become dissat-&#xD;
isfied. "All I raise," continued he, "is promised to a&#xD;
particular stall; that man has his city customers, who&#xD;
depend upon my forced hot-house productions; and mauy&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
a time have I carried my own vegetables to market, and&#xD;
purchased others less fresh for my family's use. In this&#xD;
way' only, I have attained to my present possessions; it&#xD;
is literally by the sweat of my brow, and what many&#xD;
would call~ the most parsimonious economy. The rich&#xD;
pass by my fertile grounds, and stop in their carriages&#xD;
to admire the size of enclosures devoted to one particu-.&#xD;
lar species of vegetable, namely, my asparagus-bed, and&#xD;
it~ neighbor, the plat of radishes. They apparently envy&#xD;
the profusion; but suppose they were told we who&#xD;
cultivated rigidly refrained from gathering for our own&#xD;
use until they were fully satiated? This is the life of a&#xD;
farmer who begins to clear his way, and sees indepen-&#xD;
dence in the foreground.&#xD;
"Well, the rich man who so much admired my&#xD;
grounds becomes possessed of them himself. He knows&#xD;
they must be profitable, as I relate the minute account&#xD;
of what I have realized. But how does he find it? ile&#xD;
does not labor himself; his wife and daughters know&#xD;
nothing of the wearing drudgery of a toiling farmer's&#xD;
life, and he erects a ~mall farm-house on his grounds,&#xD;
hires a gardener and l~is wife to conduct the whole labor,&#xD;
himself nominally ranking as superintendent. Friends&#xD;
from the city in large parties come to enjoy'his fruitful&#xD;
acres; the honie consumption very much abridges his&#xD;
marketable produce ; his hired appendages are fed upon&#xD;
the dainties they pick, and it requires no close~ arithmet-&#xD;
ical calculation to find the result of farming 'like a gen-&#xD;
tleman, and farming like a working man.&#xD;
"Hence it comes that so many are humbuggedd,' as&#xD;
they call it, in experimenting. In fact, there is no&#xD;

cheat about it. The difference has been clearly showD,&#xD;
- what is consunied at home cannot be paid for abroad;&#xD;
what is expended for hire is seldom as productive as the&#xD;
work of one's own h~nds."&#xD;
We pity the man whose experience teaches him such&#xD;
practical lessons Let such aa~ one watch the unceasing&#xD;
toil of the. thrifty farmer, who has secured his indepen-&#xD;
dence by the sweat of his brow, and he will readily per-&#xD;
ceive that employing others is a very different affair from&#xD;
working himself; and nowhere will its results be more&#xD;
keenly felt than in the "pocket nerve."&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
COMMUTATION.&#xD;
THE word commutation has been much in vogue of&#xD;
late. We have applied it to the fate of our fellow-men&#xD;
convicted of crime, and whom we would save from the&#xD;
ignominy of the gallows. We are not prepared to discuss&#xD;
the vexed question and consequences of capital pui~ish-&#xD;
ment, nor yet of imprisonment for lif~. We are only&#xD;
speaking of commutation. We were fancying ourselves&#xD;
sinners under sentence of death, and with the weight of&#xD;
heavy transgressions upon us. We know we shall soon&#xD;
be tried and found guilty, not in an earthly court, but at&#xD;
~ heavenly bar. We' were thinking upon what we could&#xD;
base a plea that would there avail in proof of our inno-&#xD;
cence. We cannot offer any false claim, nor set up any&#xD;
personal merit, be cause we are in the presence of the&#xD;
Searcher of hearts, who knows the end from the begin-&#xD;
ning. There is a ground of hope and fear in this assur-&#xD;
ance. We can rejoice that our cause 'is in the hands of&#xD;
such a judge, who knows what is in man, and will not be&#xD;
misled by any prejudice or' false view. We can, there-&#xD;
fore, throw ourselves into the arms of mercy.&#xD;
But I apprehend we lose sight of our need of commu-&#xD;
tation in the day of our trial, when we mete out the sen-&#xD;
tenco to our erring brother man. He may have ~ininitted&#xD;

the greater transgression; he may have slain his brother,&#xD;
and his doom* by earthly tribunals is death. There was,&#xD;
probably, a dark o~iapter which led the way for this step&#xD;
in his history. He is accountable for the indulgence of&#xD;
unbridled passion, of deadly revenge, of a bloodthirsty&#xD;
aim. His offence cries to Heaven for redress. And does&#xD;
it not cry likewise for commutation there, if not here?&#xD;
To lose a soul, what is it? Does it live in intense&#xD;
anguish and remorse until it consumes itself by preying&#xD;
upon its own powers? Or do those sufferings gain new&#xD;
intensity when earthly clogs are removed, and burn on&#xD;
forever 3 Or is there a. portion, terrible though it be,&#xD;
meted out to transgressors; and, having suffered the full&#xD;
measure for our iniquities, is the soul permitted to retrace&#xD;
its tedious way back to the Father's throne of mercy, and&#xD;
there receive an expiation for its sins while in the body?&#xD;
These are fearful questioning, but they will come; and&#xD;
the uncertainty with which we feel they are attended in&#xD;
the final issue, should warn us against the indulgence of&#xD;
all iniquity here. Certain we may be, we shall all stand&#xD;
in need of commutation.&#xD;

THE OIPiPRESSETi SEAMSTRESS.&#xD;
SoME people seem to have an idea that they pay too&#xD;
much for everything, and it is a positive duty to employ&#xD;
those who will work the cheapest.&#xD;
Mrs. Ellsworth lived sumptuously, and her daughters&#xD;
dressed elegantly. We won't call them extravagant,~ be-&#xD;
c~sse people who have plenty of money are not obliged&#xD;
to give an account to their neighbors of their expenditures.&#xD;
They were, however, discussing this very subject them-&#xD;
selves upon their damask lounges, when the servant man&#xD;
entered and presented the seamstress's bill. Such a&#xD;
nicely..folded paper always attracted the family's atten..&#xD;
tion, and having looked at the bottom and seen the&#xD;
amount, and exclaimed, "Dear me! how high!" they&#xD;
proceeded to examine the contents of the bundle which&#xD;
accompanied the bill.&#xD;
"The work is done beautifully," said Miss Henrietta.&#xD;
"How superbly this lace is set on I How splendidly this&#xD;
is hemstitehed! I declare, mother, I never mean to do&#xD;
any work myself; again, it is so much better than I can&#xD;
make it look."&#xD;
"But you forget," said the mother, "it costs a great&#xD;
deal to hire all our sewing for a large family, if it be&#xD;

&#xD;
done ever so cheap ;" yet she felt herself that it was very&#xD;
pleasant to have garments so made..&#xD;
"1 wonder," said Sophia, a tall, graceful girl of sixteen,&#xD;
to the little waiting seamstress in the entry, "what you&#xD;
would charge to make papa ten shirts ~ I have engaged&#xD;
to have them done by the first day of May; and it is so&#xD;
* long a job, and so vexatious, I wish I could transfer them&#xD;
to you to finish."&#xD;
The child was sent home to inquire of "her mother&#xD;
what she should charge to make ten shirts, with full&#xD;
bosoms, hematitched each side, and rufiled, of the nicest&#xD;
fabric, and workmanship to correspond."&#xD;
The little girl returned and. artlessly replied.:.&#xD;
"Mother says as how she shall charge a dollar ;~ i~it&#xD;
if the young folks. said they would n't give it, rather than&#xD;
lose the job, she would say seventy-five eents apiece."&#xD;
Amused with.a simplicity which ought to have excited&#xD;
sympathy rather than merriment, Sophia pretended that&#xD;
seventy-five cents was all she expected to give; she had&#xD;
hoped to get them done for, fifty cents. Mrs. Fuller gave&#xD;
oily that; but she did not add Mrs. Fl's shirts were un-&#xD;
bleaelaed,. and very common work was put in them. After&#xD;
some hesitancy she brought them down, and, doing up a&#xD;
largebundle, dispatched it. to the seamstress, a~lding:&#xD;
"Now toy poor head and my eyes are relieved."&#xD;
'Thit let us see to whom this burden was transferred.&#xD;
The same sean~stress once had a husband who was a pros-&#xD;
perous merchant; but he speculated unwisely, diQd ~sud-&#xD;
denly, ~ left a widow, with two small children, to'&#xD;
g~pple, with ~the hard fate of poverty, and the remem-&#xD;
braace of "better days." They occupied but one room,&#xD;
&#xD;
and, as her only employment ws~ sewing, it wa~ dI1BOUIt&#xD;
to make both ends meet, with the most ufttiringinduatry.&#xD;
"Don't you think, mother," said the little Rilen, 'who&#xD;
brought home the work, "the young lady thought she&#xD;
ought to get the shirts made for fifty cents apiece. But,&#xD;
mother, she surely could not have known what a slow&#xD;
process it is to gather, and hemstitch, and ruffle~ and do&#xD;
all the sewing, just for half a week's rent, or she never&#xD;
would have said so."&#xD;
The mother brushed a tear away. "No, child, she&#xD;
never sewed for a living!"&#xD;
"And, mother, she told her sister that she was so glad&#xD;
to get rid of the tiring work, and she said that her ether&#xD;
would never know but she did it all,. and she should&#xD;
have fifty cents clear, on every shirt. What could she&#xD;
meanV'&#xD;
Mrs. A. had heard of such deception before, but she&#xD;
cared not' to inform her daughter that the young lady&#xD;
was, probably, to receive one dollar and a quarter for&#xD;
each shirt. She felt that her business 'was only to finish&#xD;
the whole number as soon as possible.&#xD;
She immediately set about the task of cutting them~.by&#xD;
the pattern, asserting them into piles, and getting the&#xD;
plainer parts ready for Ellen to hem, as she was very&#xD;
nice in needle-work, as far as she had earned the art;&#xD;
but it was always near "school-time," and the poor child&#xD;
but little relieved her mother.&#xD;
It was at the season, too, when storms. succeed each&#xD;
other rapidly, and the heavens are often overcast; and,&#xD;
as the tenement of the' widow was badly lighted,. it ~began&#xD;
to make sad havoc with her vision. Her eyeswere weary&#xD;

~fre~u continued use; and when the long job was patiently&#xD;
aceomplished, who eQuld tell the aches and pains by which&#xD;
it w~s all the way attended I Miss Landon, speaking of&#xD;
suck poor, has well said:&#xD;
"We little think how wearily&#xD;
The aching head lies down."&#xD;
Long before the promised time Ellen carried home the&#xD;
ponderous bundle of ten shirts. Miss Sophia severely&#xD;
scrutinized them, 'pulled upon the ruffles, next looked at&#xD;
the gathers, then the stitching, and, finally, tossing them&#xD;
in a heap, added:&#xD;
"Tell your mother they are worth no more than fifty&#xD;
cents, and I will give her that if she will receipt the bill."&#xD;
The child returned with a heavy heart and imparted&#xD;
the information.&#xD;
The seamstress wept'; she looked at the portrait upon&#xD;
the wall.&#xD;
"If he were but alive," said she, "I should have&#xD;
some~ protector from wrong usage." She could not but&#xD;
exclaim, "How my head does ache!" as she untied an..&#xD;
other budget of work; "five dollars for ten shirts! I&#xD;
ought,'~' thought she, "to better vindicate my rights; but&#xD;
they who oppress the' poor have the worst of it. Here,&#xD;
Ellen dear, take this bill for making the shirts, and bring&#xD;
me back just what Sophia pleases to give; but say, mother&#xD;
has toiled very hard, early and late, upon them."&#xD;
Ellen did so, and Sophia took her five dollars from her&#xD;
purse, adding:&#xD;
"' This; is a great deal of money for poor people to&#xD;
spend ~ it will buy you a number of calico dresses."&#xD;
"But ~mo1~her's rent is due~," said the child&#xD;
&#xD;
"Pho! rent is nothing - make your landlord trust&#xD;
you!" and, so saying, she darted from the room.&#xD;
The seamstress never closed her eyes that night. Think&#xD;
you no unseen Eye will vindicate her true claim ~i&#xD;
"Sophia Ellsworth," said Grace Eaton, "where did&#xD;
you get that splendid fan ~ It is really elegant!"&#xD;
"I saved it," replied Sophia, "from money father&#xD;
gave me to make his shirts; but I hired them done at&#xD;
half price, and he never knows it to this day."&#xD;
Poor girl! Your fan should be used as a screen to&#xD;
hide the hard spot in your heart. Prosperity uever long&#xD;
follows in the footsteps of oppression.&#xD;

OUR EEL.&#xD;
"Ouu Eel," writes a fond mother, "has become crazed&#xD;
since she has been at a watering-place. I don't know&#xD;
what to make of the giddy creature. iler father insists&#xD;
that she ought to be returned home, but the dear little&#xD;
pet is so happy and wild with enthusiasm, I do dread&#xD;
to break the charm which now binds her to lovely N-.&#xD;
I transmit to you, my dear friend, the identical letter we&#xD;
received this morning, that you may be the better able&#xD;
to~'reply to my question, namely, "What ought I to do&#xD;
in this 'case?' "&#xD;
"N -, Aug. 28, 1858.&#xD;
"Mi DEAR PARENTS - I begin to realize more and&#xD;
more what a blessed thing it is to be brought out in soci~-&#xD;
ety. I am all' the time in a whirl of delight; there iS&#xD;
something new at every turn. Truly, this is an earthly&#xD;
paradise. Our old humdrum friends at home* talk about&#xD;
poor human nature, and its degradation! 0 faugh! I&#xD;
never desire to see better specimens than we have here.&#xD;
"Dear mother, I have not time to tell you of half the&#xD;
conquests I have made since I came here. We have a&#xD;
lovely southern gentleman, who. sings exquisitely with me&#xD;
every evening, and a decidedly brilliant young English-&#xD;
man, who performs duets with me to gathered crowds in&#xD;
&#xD;
our public parlors. I seem to be fast losing the foolish&#xD;
timidity I once felt. The blushes which used to mantle&#xD;
my cheeks, when you bade me perform any little piece&#xD;
at home before the grave old squire and his lady, do not&#xD;
torment me now. I am not afraid of any one here, and&#xD;
this confidence which I have acquired is alone worth the&#xD;
price you pay for me to remain here.&#xD;
C~ ~ danced every time at the last 'hop,' and wore my&#xD;
cherry-colored tissue over the white satin. It was thought&#xD;
the most decidedly elegant costume that appeared on the&#xD;
occasion; I only wish papa would afford me a set of&#xD;
diamonds. He is so rich he might do it as well as not.&#xD;
I should be willing he should take it out of my marriage&#xD;
portion, if ever I should settle down as a staid old ma-&#xD;
tron, and bind myself to one lover; but that is a thing I&#xD;
can never bring my mind to conceive of doing. There is&#xD;
a great charm in listening to varied specimens of making&#xD;
love. For example, one little coxcomb, who regulates&#xD;
his stomach upon 'Sarsaparilia bitters,' when he cannot&#xD;
get a stronger tonic, came up to me in our crowded&#xD;
drawing-room, and, said he, in a lisping tone, 'I am&#xD;
sure, whoever is fortunate to gain your affections, Miss&#xD;
Edgerly, has his fortune made for this world. Aw I&#xD;
understand your papa, miss, is a millionaire. I should&#xD;
like right well to call upon you in your city home.' As&#xD;
I turned my head away disdainfully, Mr. Moxon caught&#xD;
my arm, and in the most gallant manner asked me 'how&#xD;
my heart stood affected since yesterday's conversation'&#xD;
(for we talked over love matters then).&#xD;

exquisite auburn shade. His face is some 'pitted' with&#xD;
the relics of small-pox and yellow fever; for he is fresh&#xD;

until he coaxed it into a lovely curl, he was so embar-&#xD;

favorite walk we have here, called the 'Lover's Preci-&#xD;

event happened. there. A gentleman, being disappointed&#xD;

When the friend to whom Mrs. ~]dgerly sent the above&#xD;
letter, opened and read it, we may be sure she very soon&#xD;
decided upon the advice which she shQuld bestow. It was&#xD;
scarcely a year since Isabella visited this lady. She had&#xD;
then just~ graduated from a four years' residence at a&#xD;
celebrated boarding-school. She was not, of course, then&#xD;
"brought out;" but talked of wondrous things she&#xD;
I3hould do when that time arrived.&#xD;
* She was a giddy, impulsive creature, just lika an&#xD;
unbroken colt, ready to break the harness and neck ~f&#xD;

profoundly ignorant of alIdomestie affizirs, although she&#xD;

BIUp~&#xD;
"While she was with me," writes the same lady with&#xD;
whom Mrs. Edgerly conferred, "Isabella was far from&#xD;
being industrious. She would eat fruit until her appetite&#xD;
was completely satiated, and I could not induce her to&#xD;
eat any solid food. She had little regard for the laws&#xD;
upQii which our health depends, and would sit in a cur-&#xD;
rent of air one day, and be confined to her bed the next&#xD;
with an ear-ache. Her needle, when she used one, was&#xD;
occupied in worsted work. She had some patterns of&#xD;
elaborate finish (a boarding-school expression), but she&#xD;
never executed much during her visit. She was forever&#xD;
building air-castles in dreamland; wondering whom she&#xD;
should marry, and always applying the phrase, 'an&#xD;
exquisite fellow,' to the most consummate coxcombs.&#xD;
"My dear Mrs. Edgerly, by all means take your&#xD;
daughter home. She needs incessant watching, and how&#xD;
you could have thus perilled her in the care of only a&#xD;
young lady like herself, I cannot tell.&#xD;
." What if she has the neuralgia, and sea-bathing and&#xD;
change of air are recommended ~ Certainly, the recipe&#xD;
did not add to the list those questionable acts. which she&#xD;
writes about. Almost any disease is preferable to being&#xD;
made a heartless coquette, and such Isabella is~ fast be..&#xD;
coining. I would not only take her home, but I would&#xD;
furnish her with useful employment when she gets there.&#xD;

mestic labors. Those have the least pains and aches, who&#xD;
labor most; at least, a refreshing sleep will remove such&#xD;
infirmities; whereas a listless young lady fancies herself&#xD;
ill until she becomes so.&#xD;
"If I have been too diffuse in my advice, it is because&#xD;
I every day see the evils which flow from a fashionable&#xD;
education, to th~ exclusion of the practical knowledge&#xD;
of which every female should be possessed. I do not,&#xD;
however, feel I am too exact in my requirements, for my&#xD;

jah, who sought a country lass, because he thought&#xD;
he should find in her the sterling qualities he desired for&#xD;
a wife; and you may recollect, too, how it proved with&#xD;
him; forever after the engagement she forsook her old em.&#xD;
ployments, and, in attempting to fit herself for a city lady,&#xD;
by keeping herself constantly within doors, and practising&#xD;
only upon 'tent stitch,' a pain in her side was induced,&#xD;
the bloom on her cheek was exchanged for a lily white,&#xD;
and her closets, to this day, look like an apothecary's&#xD;
shop. Yet poor Abijah, of course, is doomed to bear&#xD;
what he cannot help, but always hoped to avoid. Many&#xD;
a man becomes thus cheated.&#xD;

in the distant tomb; his shroud, with its snowy folding,&#xD;
appeared distinctly before me; his form, icy and stiffened,&#xD;
~and countenance beaming with no light but the str~J1g~&#xD;
expression which death gives to the compressed lips,&#xD;
whicli are sealed forever! Good God! I exclaimed in&#xD;
my agony of loneliness, is this widowhood'? I looked out&#xD;
upon the heavens, - all was peaceful there; the stars&#xD;
seemed to shine with an unusual brilliance; why was&#xD;
this darkness in my soul'? Again I sought my bed; I&#xD;
clasped my pillow to stop the throbbing of iny fevered&#xD;

A period of twenty years ha~ now elapsed since&#xD;
this history was first chronicled. Yet, so often has the&#xD;
sad drama been again and again realized, that every&#xD;
soul exclaims, "1 have read this tale before." J3ut&#xD;
did you know, my friend, that "Johnny" is married,&#xD;
and the widow is now betrothed to her third husband ~&#xD;
~JYhat husband in prospect is the father of the bride of the&#xD;
widow's son!&#xD;
"Time will work wonders," quote it as often as we&#xD;
will. In his hurrying track he has left a deep impress&#xD;
upon that household. There are fiaxened-haired boys,&#xD;
whom want 'of paternal control has made ungovernable&#xD;
and unlovely children. The father and son make but&#xD;
one household; and the step-daughter is no companion&#xD;

property has been given to the children during the&#xD;
lifetime of the parents, and no home remains for them&#xD;
hut according to the "contract!"&#xD;
That woman reviewed her life. Thrice was she mar-&#xD;
ried, and two husbands had she laid in the grave. We&#xD;
have heard her lamentations and grief; but she assures&#xD;
us no hour of desolation in widowhood was half so try-&#xD;
ing as the daily friction which now attended her do..&#xD;

retrace her steps; and her sad closing history can only&#xD;
operate as a warning to others, lest they fidi into su~b&#xD;

a charming location. The farm-house is at th~ top of&#xD;
the hill, and overlooks one of the most commanding&#xD;
views, dotted with neighboring farm~.houses, long ~elds of&#xD;
'waving.corn, and now and then patches of heavy red and&#xD;

n~twithstanding Mrs. Peters's dissatisfaction.&#xD;
~Bat there is a discussion going on. ILlitty is the&#xD;

to transfer to paper. It appears that a day or two before&#xD;
Mr~. Peters sent his request, Judge (Jonley' was travelling&#xD;

of the refreshing mountain breezes, he had inquired&#xD;
whether he could b6 received into any farm-house in. the&#xD;
immediate vicinity, ~and an application was made to Mr.&#xD;
Hobbs, the very person with whom Mr. and Mrs. Peters&#xD;
had boarded.&#xD;
The judge was a widower; a man of wealth, but an&#xD;
admirer of nature. He sketched some; he wished for&#xD;
retirement; was liberal in his offers to remunerate our&#xD;
friends, offering the same amount for himself as both&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Peters paid; and as he desired no change ~of&#xD;
style, Mr. Hobbs was disposed to receive him. And now&#xD;
came the question whether the Peters' would be satisfied&#xD;
with smaller acc~,umnodations, and whether, moreover,&#xD;
they really wanted them on any consideration; for it was&#xD;
apparent to peopl&amp;amp;of such good common sense, that Mrs.&#xD;
Peters' element lay in more fashionable society; so after&#xD;
a full discussion it was concluded that they could nQt re~&#xD;

it in proper phraseology; which, with, her good education,&#xD;
was no difficult task.&#xD;
Upon receiving the reply, it was indeed a wonder to&#xD;
the stiperfiojid Mrs. Peters how a farmer's daughter could&#xD;
dictate sueh a delightful note. "I am sure," said she,&#xD;
"'I never saw Rutty use a pen, but I always knew she&#xD;
had studied grammar, and I have often wished,, Mr&#xD;
Peters, we had treated the girl with more civility when&#xD;
she came to the city last autumn; but my heart is so&#xD;
estranged from country cousins, I acted naturally."&#xD;
"And so, wife, after all, we cannot board in our Green&#xD;
Mountain State - now where shall we go 'i"&#xD;
Mrs. Peters immediately suggested advertising in the&#xD;
evening papers. It was late in the season; 'all the fashion-&#xD;
able quarters were occupied; but in a few days she re-&#xD;
ceived a statement of terms from the landlord of a cele-&#xD;
brated hotel, that a small, unoccupied chamber was vacant,&#xD;
with a privilege in the common parlor, which could be&#xD;
improved at the rate of twenty dollars per week; and Mr.&#xD;
Peters determined to try the experiment of "genteel&#xD;
boarding."&#xD;
Mrs. Peters was in ecstasy; her satins, silks and bareges&#xD;
were refitted by the last fashion-plate, and she was soon&#xD;
in free and easy conversatiQn with the Joneses, the lUlls,&#xD;
and the Gills; but she always scrupulously concealed the&#xD;
fa~ that she bad passed her two last summers at the&#xD;
farm-house. She was careful never to introduce her&#xD;
daughter Clarinda, who was at a boarding-school, to&#xD;
Eittyilobbs; and so the daughter had formed an idea of&#xD;
Miss Hobbs, as some awkward Green Mountain hoyden,&#xD;
&#xD;
li&#xD;
&#xD;
who knew only how to do rough work, and would shame&#xD;
a city maiden by contact.&#xD;
Mrs. Peters, however, in her new home, did not find&#xD;
"genteel society" so comfortable as she expected. There&#xD;
were cliques and parties; there were jealousies, and envy,&#xD;
and distrust. Mr. Peters was known as the tried hus-.&#xD;
band, and sundry wives despised in others just what they&#xD;
were guilty of being themselves. The small chamber&#xD;
they occupied was filled with uncomfortable occupants ;~&#xD;
the buzzing of flies, the whizzing of mosquitoes, and the&#xD;
glaring blaze of the sun, compelled her to draw a com-&#xD;
parison between that large, neat room she occupied in the&#xD;
farm-house, where the eight-day clock ticked in the cor-&#xD;
ner, and fresh bouquets appeared on the mantel shelf~&#xD;
Yet a month's board there cost no more than a week here&#xD;
- but gentility made the difference.&#xD;
At the close of a sultry day towards autumn, the busy&#xD;
rumor run the rounds that a newly-married couple, of&#xD;
distinguished notoriety, had arrived, and would appear at&#xD;
table. Expectation was on tiptoe, and the greatest prep..&#xD;
arations were made for sight-seeing, when, lo, at the&#xD;
head of the table appeared Judge Conley and "she that&#xD;
was Hitty Hobbs!"&#xD;
Mrs. Peters could not control herself. She ran and&#xD;
saluted the bride as her most intimate friend; she web&#xD;
corned- her; she expressed so much regret at not passing&#xD;
the present summer at her father's house; she should&#xD;
have been so delighted with Judge Conley's society; and&#xD;
that same evening it was proposed they should ride over&#xD;
to the seminary to be introduced to her daughter&#xD;
Clarinda.'&#xD;

1V~s. Conley did ~ liowever~ accept such attentions&#xD;
at this time, when she did not need them. She plainly&#xD;
added, with the refusal, "Mrs. Peters, my marriage has&#xD;
not deprived me of ray original identity. When I visit~&#xD;
ed you as Illitty lXobbs, I was only a green country girl;&#xD;
my present position has added nothing to my worth of&#xD;
character; if I can, ever oblige you I shall be happy to&#xD;
do so,. but I cannot accept your present civilities."&#xD;
Mrs. Peters was so chagrined that ~he left her board-&#xD;
ng.heuse the next day; but she was never after ashamed&#xD;
to A~Iekziow1edge that her most agreeable summer residence&#xD;

any roqzn ~he might obtain with her Green Mountain&#xD;

spent her summers ~till at her father's, yet she taught&#xD;

&#xD;
A "GENUINE WIDOWER."&#xD;
TilE first deep shadow that ever rested upon Henry&#xD;
Herbert's home was cast over it by the loss of his affec-&#xD;
tionate and devoted wife. It was indeed to him one of&#xD;
those mysterious dispensations, the meaning of which we&#xD;
know not now; for there she stood at the domestic fire-&#xD;
side, idolised by her husband, and seemingly perfectly&#xD;
indispensable to her two children, who were just at the&#xD;
ages to demand her constant solicitude. Such a loss&#xD;
seems always doubly painful to be borne by the f~thsr&#xD;
when the children are quite insensible of their h~vy&#xD;
bereavement; and Herbert never felt it more intensely&#xD;
than when contemphting the little volatile movementaof~&#xD;
his daughter Grace, who stood arranging a bunch of nat&#xD;
ural flowers to make a5 garland for her mother's grave.&#xD;
True, the child wept, and called to her dear mother~ as&#xD;
if invoking an ascending spirit in its upward flight; but&#xD;
then she dried her tears, and sVood before her mirrat&#xD;
half an~ hour after, parting her auburn locks, and rolling&#xD;
ever her curls, so ~as to produce a pleasing effect - for&#xD;
girls at ten years of age are no~ altogether insensible to&#xD;
the budding charms which belong to that period; and&#xD;
young Arthur Herbert, who was two yesra older thaai&#xD;
(~race1, had learned to put on his cap quite jatmtily, i~i~&#xD;

&#xD;
to exhibit some marks of precocity, which only made it&#xD;
more apparent to others than himself how much he&#xD;
needed the moulding influences of a judicious mother to&#xD;
control his too-ripened propensities to manhood. It was&#xD;
~ dark day, therefore, when that wife and mother was&#xD;
borne forever from those loved objects for whom she had&#xD;
lived, arid prayed, and sacrificed so much, and to whom&#xD;
her husband still turned as if she were even now a&#xD;
ministering angel, hoping by her' unseen and gentle in..&#xD;
fluences to be still directed. If it were a mere fancy,&#xD;
who would wish to dislodge it from such a troubled&#xD;
breast? But what was to be done with this dependent&#xD;
household?&#xD;
Mrs. Herbert was most unexpectedly taken from a&#xD;
scene of labor and care over which her supervision was&#xD;
s~ipreme. If her husband was perplexed, she was his&#xD;
comforter; if he was sick, she was his nurse; if he was&#xD;
4ejeeted, she was his sun; in fine, one who smoothed all&#xD;
the thorny experience of man's troubled' life, and upon&#xD;
whom he always leaned and sought counsel, assured that&#xD;
only words of wisdom would direct him. Of course, the&#xD;
faithful discharge of the maternal relation was not want-&#xD;
ing; and while the feeling of desolation bore so sadly&#xD;
upon henry Herbert's heart,~ let us hear the first letter&#xD;
he dictated to a very dear friend after his severe afflie..&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"M~ DEAR ANNA :-~ I can never express to you iii&#xD;
Iangu~ge the painful sense of~ loss which everywhere&#xD;
me sizica my beloved Lizzie has gone from my&#xD;
~ it mor~intonu~1y reali2~i thM the&amp;amp;st&#xD;
&#xD;
morning our little family group ranged ourselves ~rotu~4&#xD;
the breakfaat~table. She who. was ever the presilin~&#xD;
genius at that board, whose smile always made the most&#xD;
lowering day open propitiously and hopefully, was not&#xD;
there; but, instead, a pert young housekeeper occupied.&#xD;
her chair, and by her attempts at afl~bi1ity. and affected&#xD;
good-humor strove to dissipate the sadness of our counte..&#xD;
nuances. 'Perhaps it was a kind act, well intended, but I&#xD;
could not bear it; my coffee remained untasted, my roll&#xD;
lay untouched on my plate. The children, of course,&#xD;
partook of my emotion, and the housekeeper, being not&#xD;
of any too sympathetic turn of mind, began to chide us.&#xD;
'Why,' said she, 'Mr. Herbert, do you think nobody&#xD;
ever buried a friend but yourself? Young as I am, I&#xD;
have lost a husband; but I was led by the grace of God&#xD;
to feel it was all right. If I had yielded to the pressure&#xD;
of the calamity, wh4 would have become of my chil-&#xD;
dren? No, sir, I immediately summoned my energies,&#xD;
broke up housekeepi~~g, put out my children to board,&#xD;
secured a situation rpr myself, and determined to look&#xD;
beyond the cloudy a~pect. I at length succeeded, and&#xD;
you see the cheerful acquiescence I have attained. Mr.&#xD;
Herbert, you still have plenty of means to supply their&#xD;
wants, and yet seem refining and unhappy.'&#xD;
"There was a truth here which Mrs. Agnew pre..&#xD;
scented, but it did not take hold of me as if uttered in a&#xD;
sympathizing spirit. I wondered she dared express her.&#xD;
self so freely. I felt her husband was never to her what&#xD;
my wife had been* to me. It was too much; and when&#xD;
Maggy, our old trusty domestic, entered. my rooiii&#xD;
soon after, with a deep sigh and mdd, '0, l~Xr. Herbert,&#xD;

$UJ~eTANqE AN]) AI)OWS,&#xD;
we ha~e indeed met with~ sad loss, and I do not feel. as&#xD;
if~ I can. stay with you under this new mistress,' it woke&#xD;
up a tide of feeling, perfectly irresistible, and servant&#xD;
and master wept together. Mrs. Agnew is not a pre~.&#xD;
possessing woman in her maxiners. Maggy says she has&#xD;
already dictated very unwisely to her, and they have&#xD;
had some Blight altercation she is about to leave."&#xD;
And now, if we will ibilow the journal of this dis-&#xD;
tressed widower, we shall have before us an exact picture&#xD;
of human nature. in its frequent manifestations.&#xD;
"June Tth. It is now a month since dear Lizzie left&#xD;
me. I begin to regain my composure, but I am terribly&#xD;
oppressed with a sense of loneliness. . A thousand ob-&#xD;
jects of' interest, upon which she daily looke4, tend to&#xD;
keep her continually in my thoughts. There is her&#xD;
writing~desk; the unfinished manuscripts lay upon~ the&#xD;
table; a note addressed to a friend, but owing to some&#xD;
circumstance never sent to her; an unfinished piece of&#xD;
fancy-work kept for a stray hour's amusement; her&#xD;
books, her pictures indeed, everywhere the. mute ob-&#xD;
jects which her eyes or fingers rested upon. And where&#xD;
is she now? comes to me with appalling force. Shall&#xD;
we meet again?&#xD;
"July 9th. It is recommended by my friends that J&#xD;
shall surrender housekeeping. Mrs. Agnew is con-&#xD;
sta~kitiy troubled with her servants,, the children have&#xD;
grown very restless under her management, and Arthur&#xD;
refuses to obey her at all.' It is thought I had better&#xD;
send the children to some~good boarding-8choel, and find&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
1MP&#xD;
&#xD;
some home for myself where 1-shall be subject to less&#xD;
perplexity, and sooner regain my former cheerfulness.&#xD;
" July 20th. The decision is made, and I have been&#xD;
gathering all the relics of dear Lizzie's handiwork for her&#xD;
daughter Grace to preserve as a precious legacy. The&#xD;
dear children are at a weWrecommended school, and I&#xD;
take lodgings to-morrow in a public house. It is&#xD;
thought I shall be more in society in such a place, and&#xD;
wear off the effects of my great loss. But the idea of&#xD;
quitting a home where IL have enjoyed the most exquisite&#xD;
pleasures, where a holy charm seems to pervade even the&#xD;
apartments through which she so often glided, and&#xD;
adorned, is indeed painful. But then, with such a&#xD;
housekeeper, what is left for me but to pursue this&#xD;
course? I cannot find one half the nice materials upon&#xD;
which Lizzie expended so much time. Mrs. Agnew says&#xD;
the servants must have carried them away. What was&#xD;
in drawers is mostly abstracted; but, as I never gav~&#xD;
attention to the minutiae of what was contained in trunks&#xD;
and private receptacles, but gave all the keys to my&#xD;
housekeeper, I have no means of knowing what was&#xD;
purloined. But whoever is the aggressor must suft~r&#xD;
more by the gain than I can by the loss.&#xD;
"Aug. 8th. 1 do not exactly enjoy this bustlix~g&#xD;
whirl in which I live. I sometimes picture to myself &amp;amp;&#xD;
re-gathered family, where we can agaiw garner up our&#xD;
wasted hopes, and sit by our cheerful fireside. If there&#xD;
were another Lizzie in this wide world who could but&#xD;
supply the place of her who was gone but what have I&#xD;

spare me from all unnatural grief. How much the&#xD;
children need a- home and a mother's care!&#xD;
"Oct. 17th. When I was first introduced to Amelia&#xD;
Blond, she at once reminded me of my dear wife. True,&#xD;
she is a mere girl compared with her - some fifteen&#xD;
years younger --but still all the graces of womanhood&#xD;
are fully developed. If- heavens! I blush to enter it&#xD;
tipon my journal! How Mrs. Agnew, n~y old house~&#xD;
'keeper, would glory in the fulfilment of her prophecy&#xD;
made in my deepest bereavement! 'Mr. Herbert,' said&#xD;
she, 'your feelings will be materially changed in a few&#xD;
months, and in less than a year I predict your marriage!&#xD;
Such violent grief never'survives more than one season.'&#xD;
I could have turned her from my threshold for such an&#xD;
ifltimation; but, alas! how little we know ourselves!&#xD;
Lizzie, your image is still enshrined in my heart; but&#xD;
must I go weeping through the remainder of my journey&#xD;
because you were taken from my side? I met Dr.&#xD;
Frost yesterday; he first ventured to joke me upon being&#xD;
married again. This led to a serious conversation upon&#xD;
the subject. The doctor~ has been through the depths of&#xD;
arniction three successive times, and now is in the full&#xD;
enjoyment of domestic bliss. He urged no objection to&#xD;
Miis J~lorkd but her age; but some girls at twenty are as&#xD;
fit to rule a household as others at fifty. I do not myself&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
think her age an insuperable objection; she will be more&#xD;
companionable to Grace. But how 4o I know that she&#xD;
would marry a man so much her senior ~ The doctor&#xD;
says, 'how will you know unless you ask her?'.&#xD;
"Nov. 4th. Since my last entry in my journal, I&#xD;
have taken a great step. The proposal to marry Amelia&#xD;
was accepted, and I find myself in a new world; the old,&#xD;
restless, disconsolate feeling I have endured seems leav~&#xD;
ing me. My weed is horribly rusty upon my hat, and&#xD;
outward marks of mourning are superfluous. I have&#xD;
thought Ii would not use any more crape s~nrroundings.&#xD;
I must express my feelings to my dear friend to whom I&#xD;
so recently communicated my deep sorrow, well assured&#xD;
that she will ~eply, 'Henry, Itremble for you.'"&#xD;
And let us hear the confession thus confidentially&#xD;
made. It belongs to our humanity, that the sunshine&#xD;
should succeed the storm, as much in the physical as the&#xD;
material universe.&#xD;
"My DEAR ANNA : - As you have been the faithful&#xD;
depository of my sorrows, it is but justice due to you to&#xD;
be made acquainted with my joys. 'Know then, my good&#xD;
friend, that having been crushed by the weight of sorrow,&#xD;
and feeling the desolation of a heart that turns to another&#xD;
for support, I met, by the merest accident, a lovely girl,&#xD;
who so strikingly reminded me of my early love, that I&#xD;
~'sought an introduction to her. She was stopping here&#xD;
with her father for a few days. She is well connected;&#xD;
her father is cashier in a bank in Western New York. I&#xD;
have been there, made my proposals, and have been ac~&#xD;

&#xD;
quaintecl with this new feature in my history. Do not&#xD;
ask me if I am demented ; -4'ar from it. Amelia Blond&#xD;
is just about twenty ~ears of age, lively, fascinating, per-&#xD;
fectly charming in conversation; the idol in her home,&#xD;
being the eldest child,; handsome, sweet..texnpered, and&#xD;
of the a being as would make Grace and Arthur one&#xD;
most accomplished of companions, and the best of&#xD;
mothers. I cannot, for I dare not, attempt to tell~ you&#xD;
how I conceived of this beautiful being who has been&#xD;
raised up to me to pour new life and happiness into my&#xD;
once bruised heart. In personal beauty, she fair exceeds&#xD;
my departed wife; besides, she has had all the modern&#xD;
advantages of a fashionable education, which eminently&#xD;
qualifies her to impart her gifts and graces to my chil-&#xD;
dren. I shall not be married until January have&#xD;
rented a fine house; and the very prospect, of being once&#xD;
again reinstated as a happy family quite elevates my&#xD;
.fi~elings,' and makes me enthusiastic in the contemplation.&#xD;
The children, too, are delighted with the prospect. Do&#xD;
not chide my prompt action; life is so brief we must&#xD;
gather all the sunshine we can between its parted clouds.&#xD;
Yours, truly,   H. H."&#xD;
And thus the "dear Anna" playfully replied:&#xD;
"Have I not the evidence before me, Henry, that you&#xD;
are a genuine widower? Inconsolable the first month of&#xD;
your bereavement.; not much relieved the second; quite&#xD;
convalescent the third; beginning to look round you the&#xD;
fourth; find a lovely piece of human perfection the fifth;&#xD;
engage to marry her the sixth; live on the ecstatic pros-&#xD;

acted over the drama, I could joke you, or chide you, or&#xD;
gravely caution you. But I always fear for those de-&#xD;
voted husbands with overpowering griefs at the loss of&#xD;
their earthly idols. At the present period of your ecstasy&#xD;
I shall therefore intrude no remonstrances, 'for I am well&#xD;
assured you are in a dreamy state of bliss that nothing&#xD;
but the reality will equalize. Let me, therefore, wish&#xD;
you as much enjoyment as you anticipate; and to ask&#xD;
more would be superfluous. TrQly, ANNA."&#xD;
On the first of January, seven months~ from the death&#xD;
of his idolized wife, Henry Herbert and Amelia Blond&#xD;
were united in marriage. The new home ~ias an attract-&#xD;
ive place. Grace 'and Arthur were delighted with their&#xD;
new mother; the father did not think her a day too&#xD;
young for his wife, and the manifest pride~~with which he&#xD;
introduced his wife, and the smile-lighted expression&#xD;
which irradiated his features, bespoke the perfect satis~&#xD;
faction which pervaded his inner being. When we took&#xD;
leave of Mr. Herbert, he seemed fully persuaded that it&#xD;
was a wise dispensation which removed his first idol.&#xD;
And although her memory was atill fragrant, yet he&#xD;
presented a living memorial that the crushed affections&#xD;
may be rejiwakened, and that there is no heart, however&#xD;
desolate, if it beats beneath a manly bosom, but may re-&#xD;
pair its loss. And too often the truth is self-evident&#xD;
that the newly-repaired affecUons seem to flow out more&#xD;
spontaneously and with deeper fervor than' did the old;&#xD;
for, as an ancient writer quaintly' remarks, "the old,&#xD;
heart, rejuvenated by the fires of new passion, becomes&#xD;
juvenile in its exhibitions of tenderness."&#xD;

THAT YACA~CY.&#xD;
DRATH does not make all our vacancies. There Was&#xD;
a nice little miss who lived over the way, and she con-&#xD;
ceived a most unfortunate attachment for his clerkship,&#xD;
Mr. Anthony Dobbs, a youth of nineteen. II was a sad&#xD;
event,' worse than death. We are reconciled (or ought&#xD;
to be) to what Providence sends; but who would give&#xD;
away a beautiful girl to a fellow who owned three, or f~r&#xD;
bottles of hair-oil, some nicely-perfumed handkerchiefs,&#xD;
sun4ry parti-colored neck-stocks, the wearing apparel he&#xD;
had on, and two pairs of white kids, one soiled, the&#xD;
other fresh~ Was it not lamentable to see the affection;&#xD;
forgetful of such an inventory of worldly goods, march up&#xD;
to Hymen's altar an4 wake solemn vows to "1~ve, protect,&#xD;
and cherish," so much that was shadowy and unsubstan-&#xD;
ti~il? But, then) poets talk about love as "ethereal,"&#xD;
needing no substantial soups, only a few highly-spiced&#xD;
condiments, to support the interior life. Certain gross&#xD;
people, not understanding this definition, have been fool-&#xD;
ish, enough to accumulate means where by the larder and&#xD;
cellar can be supplied; but they are the beef-eaters, of&#xD;
this lower world, who imagine a house, a table, and&#xD;
worldly ~oods, are quite essential! How wonderful. that&#xD;
such a theory shoi~d ever ~have taken so deep ~roo&amp;amp;in&#xD;
this pleaeure4aking wozid!&#xD;
&#xD;
Then there is another vacancy of a different kind. Do&#xD;
you remember the bachelor, with a high dickey and stiff&#xD;
gait, who was always advocating the laws of health, and&#xD;
took so much exercise that he used to be facetiously&#xD;
called "the walking~ticket" 3 He boarded, ever since&#xD;
our grandmother's day in Pelham-street, at the "cr~tck&#xD;
house" of Mrs. Wines. Well, he has been caught, and'&#xD;
there is a vacancy. Poor fellow! how he hated music;&#xD;
bat his dulcin~a drags him to every concert in town. As&#xD;
to parties, he abominated everything of the kind but a&#xD;
game of whist with gentlemen. Now, the carriage is&#xD;
ordered at ten to attend a fancy ball, and he dresses in&#xD;
pumps, and says, "Coachman, call, at one o~cloek, at&#xD;
No.-" How long think you it will be before some&#xD;
malady seizes him and lays him on the sick-bed 3 And,&#xD;
then, that young wife, will she sit by a dull lamp and&#xD;
~ drop medicines, and warm flannels, and act like a faithful&#xD;
nurse in his declining years? How fortunate it is we&#xD;
are not made of glass, and transparent all the way&#xD;
through! How well it is that half our dissatisfaction we&#xD;
can throw off upon some "pain" or "an affection of the&#xD;
liver"! The doctor cannot tell where the twinge comes&#xD;
from which causes us to make a wry face. You tell him&#xD;
it is in the toe; he discerns a slight inflammation there.&#xD;
Poh, nonsense; it is in the heart.&#xD;
But we were on vacancies. 'Weariness of the same&#xD;
place makes many decamp. This disease comes on with&#xD;
depression, proceeds to a cough, and thence t~ a southern&#xD;
latitude, to escape easterly winds. A whole family are&#xD;
thus scattered.&#xD;

<pb  n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8250-00000078"/>&#xD;
too small; the street is too narrow; the children have&#xD;
no play.~room; the acquaintances maintain more style;&#xD;
and so removals must ensue. And, then, comes a weari-&#xD;
ness of' one's country. People have been west, have&#xD;
seen Niagara, lived suimners at the Springs, been to&#xD;
Virginia cotton.fields, ascended Mt. Washington, looked&#xD;
at the jumping-off place dowa-east, and what can excite&#xD;
them here? Plainly they must take the steamship and&#xD;
go abroad. They would travel through High ilolborn,&#xD;
peep into Westminster Abbey, pass through Switzerland,&#xD;
spend a winter in Rome, see the crater of Mt. Vesuvius,&#xD;
come back to Paris, get a smattering of all things,&#xD;
fashions and people, and return home by the way of&#xD;
New York!&#xD;
flaying seen all this world, we sometimes wonder they&#xD;
don't turn their attention to another; but few seem to&#xD;
do this, and any premonition, in the form of gout or&#xD;
consumption, draws the "facul~y"in earnest consulta-.&#xD;
tion. upon their case, and every conceivable thing is done&#xD;
lest they should leave this world, which is so trying.&#xD;
And, when they must die, how they grasp still at fleet-&#xD;
ing shadows ! - sometimes undetermined where to bestow&#xD;
what they cannot carry with them, distrustful of every-&#xD;
body, altering last wills, subjoining codicils, making&#xD;
strange bequests, passing away with great parade through&#xD;
public streets, and leaving places vacant!&#xD;
All this we daily witness, a~id. never once think of&#xD;
expressing our profound gratitude that we are corruptible&#xD;
rather than transparent, for those we leave behind to&#xD;
criticize our real characters.&#xD;

"SELLING OFF AT COST."&#xD;
"WHERE did you get that splendid lace upon your&#xD;
cape?" inquired Mrs. Eager of her neighbor, Mrs.&#xD;
higgins.&#xD;
"Why, I purchased it at Fonday's; did you know&#xD;
they were selling off at cost?" Mrs. Higgins then un-&#xD;
rolled an elegant striped silk, she had just purchased for a&#xD;
dress, only fifty cents a yard! a nice de lame, only nine-&#xD;
pence! lots of prints only fourpence! and a splendid&#xD;
pocket handkerchief at six dollars, the original price of&#xD;
which was twelve!&#xD;
Poor Mrs. Eager took fire at such a display at once:&#xD;
she never saw such bargains in her life. True, she was&#xD;
not in want of any of these articles just now, but what&#xD;
of that? A good thing in the wearing apparel line&#xD;
neither eats nor drinks anything. She would have a&#xD;
silk dress, that was so cheap; and there was some lace,&#xD;
just such as she wanted, at half price. The de lame&#xD;
would make a beautiful morning-dress. What matter was&#xD;
I&#xD;
it if she had half a dozen already? It was so cheap.&#xD;
At all events she must have a pocket handkerchief to&#xD;
carry to Mrs. Minor's ball. And with~ these thoughts&#xD;
dancing through her brain, she immediately equipped&#xD;

with "No humbug selling less than cost," announced&#xD;
to her that this was the place, although sundry neigh-i&#xD;
hors purported to be selling the same.&#xD;
sure enough there was a most tempting display.&#xD;
Heaps of silk, glittering and changing in hue; elegant&#xD;
laces, varying in prices, but all decidedly cheap; prints,&#xD;
patches, linens, cambrics, satins and velvets, all by turns&#xD;
attracted our friend's attention. And then the clerks&#xD;
'were ~o attentive, so ready to accommodate, and even&#xD;
Mr. Monday himself stepped forward and inquired:&#xD;
"Mrs. Eager, let roe sell you a bill of goods to-day?"&#xD;
to which Mrs. Eager replied:&#xD;
Money is so scarce, Mr. Monday, I am quite limited&#xD;
in' my purchases this season."&#xD;
"That need not make the slightest difference," re-&#xD;
marked the good-natured shopinan; "take just what you&#xD;
please, have the goods booked, and pay just when 'it best&#xD;
suits you."&#xD;
Was ever any one so aceommodat~ing 3 Well, thought&#xD;
Mrs, Eager, this is the first bill I ever ran. up in a dry-&#xD;
goods store; but where 'a the harm? Mr. Eager, I&#xD;
know, would riot approve of it; he always says, "Pay as&#xD;
'you go, wife;" but I know he is short just now, and I do&#xD;
want these things. She hesitated a moment, and then all&#xD;
was over. Tier decision was made to take all she wanted,&#xD;
it was such a good chance. One silk was so beautital,&#xD;
she thought she would take fifteen yards of that piece.&#xD;
Then there was another less elegant, but still very use-&#xD;
[~ixi for some oceasions,-~--- she would have a dress from&#xD;
that. As to laces, she was surprised to hear she had&#xD;
ift~enAollars' ~vorth, ~nd, baying c~inpl~te&amp;amp;l~er&#xD;
&#xD;
trading, the footing of her bill amounted to a trifle ever&#xD;
seventy-five dollars! Not one of these things was to~ b~&#xD;
used now; but thou she remembered they were all :o&#xD;
ckeap. She was truly glad to obtain so many things~ to&#xD;
lay away. She thought it would be better to withhold&#xD;
the fact of her purchases from her husband, lLntil money&#xD;
grew easier, and the banks discounted more freely..&#xD;
Mr. Eager caine home to dinner sick and dispirited.&#xD;
He protested he could not get on much longer sinless&#xD;
there came a change for the better and upon Mrs. Ea~ger&#xD;
expressing much sympathy for him, he bade her keep up&#xD;
good cheer, be economical as possible, and perhaps by&#xD;
and by things would change for the better. For the first&#xD;
time, Mrs. Eager wished all her goods back again in the&#xD;
shop whence they were taken. ]3u.t what was to be&#xD;
done ~ They harassed her mind, and she stowed them&#xD;
all away in a back closet, putting them out of sight, hop-&#xD;
ing to get them out of mind. We will leave them there&#xD;
for the present, and return to Fonday's.&#xD;
"I will look at your choice laces," said &amp;amp; little miss&#xD;
of some eighteen years. She selected of the prettiest&#xD;
patterns, and "how much do you ask for this 3)3 she&#xD;
inquired.&#xD;
"Two dollars a yard, iniss,-.just such as we have&#xD;
been selling for three dollars."&#xD;
'T can't think of giving that. Mrs. Higgins bought&#xD;
one here Lor four and ~ixpenee, which looked equally as&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"You are mistaken, 1 think," replied the clerk;&#xD;

This is a specimen of some people who make "~1ie&#xD;

They literally den~a~4 the goods to be given sway. nut,&#xD;

this class extinct, where would be the sIiop~keepers?&#xD;
"I declare," said Fonday, one night to his partner,&#xD;

"cash to the amount of twenty thousand dollars; we-have&#xD;
booked about ten thousand, and have sold our most do-&#xD;
*~ble articles, and upon the remainder there must be a&#xD;
further reduction, or we shall never get them off."&#xD;
"No," replied the partner, "get in some new ones,&#xD;
advertise again, and by- degrees we shall clear them all&#xD;
out."&#xD;
They did so; but here were new liabilities assumed,&#xD;
and if no profit; how much loss think you, accrues ~&#xD;
And upon whom is that to fall 3 If the firm are able&#xD;
to stand it, of course they are impoverished; if not, it&#xD;
iblis upon those who first sold the goods; and so the evil&#xD;
consequences are traceable far back, and we hear of&#xD;
much derangement in trade, unexpected failures, great&#xD;
scarcity of money, banks that won't discount, and a&#xD;
train of evils. If" selling off at cost" is really what it&#xD;
purports to be, how can it be but a ruinous affair 3&#xD;
There is another evil; goods are put at prices which,&#xD;
-u*~less afterward adhered to, will not be purchased.&#xD;
Other traders, who are pursuing the old way of fair&#xD;
profits~ ~are neglected; for people will flock where goods&#xD;
can be purchased cheapest. I remember an anecdote in&#xD;
point. A short time since a small, insignificant4ooking&#xD;
back storestood full a mile from any thoroughfare, in a&#xD;
little dirty street. But the marr advertised "goods from&#xD;
auction at unprecedented low prices." In the course of&#xD;
~a week, so great was the rush, that the paasage~.way&#xD;
iee4irig to the stor. was literally blocked up all h~rs in&#xD;
the--day~ - II.~old-lacofoz' one cent, which were hel~t&#xD;
&#xD;
thi'ee cents everywhere; and gloves for #our c~nts,~ aetti-&#xD;
ally worth eight; and women will find out such things!&#xD;
But we will turn to Mrs. Eager. She was invited to&#xD;
a large party, and she could not resist the temptation to&#xD;
show that eleg~int silk she had laid away in the dark&#xD;
closet. Her mantua~znaker advised her by all means to&#xD;
have it made up; it would show oft splendidly by gas&#xD;
light. But then if Mr. Eager should find it out, as dis-&#xD;
appointed and tried as he was already, what would be&#xD;
the consequence ~ Vanity will make us risk conse.~&#xD;
quences, and the silk was carried to a shop and made in&#xD;
elegant style. Mr. Eager always knew when his wife&#xD;
looked well, but could never tell what she wore. So&#xD;
they started for the party with the unpaid dress, and&#xD;
Mrs. Eager seemed to forget the past, and enjoy only the&#xD;
present.&#xD;
Soon after they entered the gay~ assembly, a volatile&#xD;
young lady thus addressed Mr.. Eager:&#xD;
"So your wife has come out in Fonday's richest ~ilk.&#xD;
I saw it there, and meant to have purchased it, but Mrs.&#xD;
Eager had got the start of rue. Fon~ay told me he sold&#xD;
her a nice bill of goods."&#xD;
Mr. Eager was thunderstruck, and said nothing, but&#xD;
gave an assumed laugh, and passed on. His enjoyment&#xD;
for that evening was at an end. He seemed abstracted,&#xD;
dull and cheerless, and no one could divine the cause&#xD;
not even his wife. They returned home, and she began&#xD;
to chide her husband for inattention. This elicited the&#xD;
whole matter, and Mr. and Mrs. Eager were changed in&#xD;
tone. For the second time, Mrs. Eager wished all her&#xD;
purchases in the store whence they were taken.&#xD;

&#xD;
A few days after, while sitting at dinner (having mado&#xD;
up the disagreement), the bell rang violently, and the&#xD;
bill was handed to Mr. Rager, which his wife had run up&#xD;
at Monday's. For the third time, Mrs. E. wished those&#xD;
goods back again in the store.&#xD;
"~ If I had ever deprived you of money when you had&#xD;
~ked it; if you had not known my ~ishes respecting&#xD;
bills being left unpaid ; if you had not deceived me&#xD;
bait why pursue his conversation ~ The. bill was paid,&#xD;
a~nd~Mrs. Eager never again bought what she had not&#xD;
cash to pay for at the time.&#xD;
"But I have'bills at a number of stores," says 0fl0.&#xD;
"And ~so do I," replies another.&#xD;
Let me ask you one question, ladies; do you ~ever&#xD;
purcbas~ many articles in this way which with cash in&#xD;
hand you would feel that you did not need'? The answer&#xD;
tothie' question tolls whether it is expedient or not to&#xD;
purchase on trust. It may be convenient, it may be&#xD;
~g~eeable to your husband that you should do so; then&#xD;
very Well, but never, never deceive a maft,~-~- never let a&#xD;

THE UNFINISHED PICTURE.&#xD;
HAVING recently called upon a family, consisting of&#xD;
three daughters and one son, who bad just returned from&#xD;
a fashionable watering-place, their fertile imaginations&#xD;
were busy in the future, as a great event was about. to&#xD;
take place.' "Hattie," one of the young ladies, had&#xD;
recently become engaged, and that most fruitful topic of&#xD;
"Who is he'?" having been disposed of (not exactly as&#xD;
some of the friends would have desired), the subject of&#xD;
bridal fashions formed the chit-chat of the whole call.&#xD;
We will premise that the lady's father was only in mod-&#xD;
erate circumstances, and leave the reader. to judge of the&#xD;
wants, and their reasonableness, by a simple description.&#xD;
"Hattie is to be married," said the mother, "in&#xD;
splendid white brocade. The article is of recent importa-&#xD;
tion, and cost five dollars per yard. Is n't it a beautiful&#xD;
article'? Her pocket-handkerchief cost twenty-five dol-&#xD;
lars, and she is now teasing her father for a diamond&#xD;
bracelet. Dear child! it is an event that seldom hap-&#xD;
pens more than once in a lifetime, and I do not wonder&#xD;
the child feels a little particular in the style of her&#xD;
dress," continued her fond mother., "The bridal hat&#xD;
must be of corn-color. That is decidedly, girls, the&#xD;
most genteel, the most expensive, and the most tasteful."&#xD;

&#xD;
"And where will they live 'V' inquired a friend.&#xD;
"0, that is undecided! Probably board for the&#xD;
present. My child is a perfect novice in domestic affairs.&#xD;
She cannot assume the cares of housekeeping, at any&#xD;
rate."~&#xD;
"But, iiia," drawled out the engaged Hattie, "I can&#xD;
get a cookery-book, and that will teach ~ne everything.&#xD;
I can, then, make ices and cream-cakes, and all those&#xD;
splendid fixings we have had for desserts all the past&#xD;
~mmer." And the girl was on tiptoe at the very&#xD;
tl~ought of her hixurious living. Poor thing! we pitied&#xD;
her. - We could not, however, forbear tQ ask who was&#xD;
most in fault, that mother or the daughter.&#xD;
There was a rumor, a few days after this interviews&#xD;
of a Ee~vy' fidlure; the father ~f Hattie was interested in&#xD;
the same oor4cern, an&amp;amp;he, too, was declared a bankrupt I&#xD;
And once more the attention of people was directed to&#xD;
'~ 4o~1ng man to whom she was about to be married.&#xD;

t~ idle summer, at the Springs, and hail a love of sketch-&#xD;

MARRYING TOO LATE.&#xD;
"THEIU~ is no season" said my Uncle Richard, " I&#xD;
dread like the approach of spring. It is not that I have&#xD;
not a taste for opening buds and' blossoms; it is not that&#xD;
I am not a lover of rural pleasures; bizt it is because&#xD;
your Aunt Hannah seems to have so many newly4lown&#xD;
ideas and wants, that I find it hard to steer clear of the&#xD;
breakers. I don't know the peculiarities of other women,&#xD;
for I never studied the female sex much. You know I&#xD;
lived a bachelor until I was eight-and-forty, and what tl~~&#xD;
deuce I ever married for, sometime~ proves &amp;amp; v&amp;amp;xin~&#xD;
question to me. But still I do know the reason. I felt&#xD;
lonely, sometimes. I used to get irritated with landladies,&#xD;
and mad at house-servants, and provoked with washer-&#xD;
women; and whenever I spoke of my troubles to rziy&#xD;
friend Squire, he used to say, 'All this, Dick, comes from&#xD;
single blessedness;' and I was fool enough to believe&#xD;
him. Then I had a terrible tussle with myself to *know&#xD;
whom I had better marry! I hired a pew in the 'broad&#xD;
aisle of Dr. Brodwell's church; for they said this w~s 'a&#xD;
good place to look out for a wife; so I opened the window&#xD;
of my 'heart, lifted my embossed prayer-book, and 'r-&#xD;
peated, 'Good Lord, deliver us;' but I am afraid UGW 'it&#xD;
was not an acceptable prayer.&#xD;

"~We11, Judith Dunn, the widow, sat right before me.&#xD;
She had three little daughters, all arrayed in black for&#xD;
their 'dear papa;' and Mrs. Dunn wore so thick a veil I&#xD;
never could penetrate beneath it to see her face, until&#xD;
about the fourth Sunday after I took the pew. Then she&#xD;
brushed by me, and, hitting the flap of my coat just as&#xD;
she was turning the corner, '~xcuse me, Mr. Guy,' said&#xD;
she. It was enough. Squire saw her, said she had&#xD;
money, told what well-behaved children the little Dunns&#xD;
were, what a nice wife she made, what an amiable dispo-&#xD;
s~tion~ha had, how she mourned her husband's death, and&#xD;
the uncertainty of her ever marrying again.&#xD;
"'Find out that last fact for me,' said I to Squire.&#xD;
Shaving committed myself, I must stand the racket.&#xD;
"Squire made an errand to Mrs. Dunn's house, feigning&#xD;
a kind of inquiry about a man indebted~ to her late hus-&#xD;
hand. and himself. The widow appeared terribly down-&#xD;
east, and Squire awkwardly said, I hope your days of&#xD;
mourning will not last forever. Time assuages grief,&#xD;
and it 'may be your duty to yet form another connection.'&#xD;
~'07 heavens!' exclaimed the widow, 'never, never,&#xD;
Mr. Squire. My heart is broken I can never love&#xD;
another man. My husband, sir, was one of a thousand.'&#xD;
I left her,' said Squire, 'but just as my hand was&#xD;
on the latch to go, she inquired, "Do you know, sir, who&#xD;
that gentleman is who has taken the pew adjoining mine&#xD;
in our church?"&#xD;
"'0, yes; he is my friend Guy, an old bachelor, but&#xD;
a sterling maD, worth his. thousands, full of good-humor,&#xD;
~ud on the look-out for a wife, as ~we say.'&#xD;

"Mrs.' Dunn evidently looked brighter, arid remarked,&#xD;
'lie is very fine-looking 'what is his business P&#xD;
"'A commission merchant,' I replied, 'and a law-and-&#xD;

Do as you please, 'Mr. Squire; but you know all&#xD;

"Squire told me all this," pursued iJ"ncle lLichord%&#xD;
"and the widow Dunn yvas forever after before me. I&#xD;
went again to my pew, but ere I started I remember&#xD;
twitching off half a dozen dickeys before I could get one&#xD;

tailor, and for the first time in my life actually stood&#xD;

And then, too, what harassing work the spring&#xD;
makes about journeys! Why, I used to take my carpet-&#xD;

Y~t you may listen to all their private intercourse with.&#xD;
the fraternity, ~nd never will you find them ready to&#xD;

They may ridicule, boast of their independence, of their&#xD;

talk about women; and, as all this seems a natural prd.&#xD;

THE HENPECKED HUSBAND.&#xD;
WELL, I suppose Mrs. Pipps did sufi'er with nervouss&#xD;
headaches" and "spasms ;" but was that tiny reason why&#xD;
she should keep all her family in a pucker 3 Why could&#xD;
she not let the wind alone, if it blew from the east'? Why&#xD;
not let it rain as hard as ever it did'? Why not let the sun&#xD;
shine so hot as to blister, and the dews fall so heavy as&#xD;
to wet her through 3 Surely, Mr. IPipps could not help&#xD;
these things, and she was not exposed to bear them, and&#xD;
it only made others unhappy to be forever in a fuss&#xD;
about them.&#xD;
And then Mrs. Pipps was never well. This was a&#xD;
great source of unhappiness; but why need one ugly&#xD;
pain put everybody else in a state of torture 3 And the&#xD;
'poor woman 'kept up such ceaseless complaints. '"There&#xD;
never was a worse cook than Bridget; she never made&#xD;
anything fit to be eaten; the cakes for breakfast were&#xD;
overdone, and the mutton for dinner was burnt up, ~nd&#xD;
who wanted~buwit mutton chops and watery potatoes for&#xD;
a meal "3 And then the chimney smoked when she felt&#xD;
very nervous, and it ought to have been swept long ag&amp;amp;;&#xD;
besides, the kitchen was always in a hubbubr and there&#xD;
must be a ~htmge of servants. One day she desired her&#xD;
husband to get her a new kind of pills; the next some&#xD;

liniment, and the third day a patent medicine that&#xD;
was invigorating in the spring. Sometimes she believed&#xD;
herself going into a deep consumption, and then, again,&#xD;
her liver was affected.&#xD;
Yet, Mr. Pippa was a pattern man. He never told&#xD;
his wife she was "fidgety;" that exercise and air would&#xD;
strengthen her nerves; because he knew such imaginary&#xD;
diseases were to be differently treated from real ones.&#xD;
Whatever she wanted, he helped her to procure. Still,&#xD;
he looked the sicker of the two; he w~is sallow, and the&#xD;
~rowafeet settled about his eyes, and his hair was&#xD;
sprinkled quite too early forhis years. He was, more-&#xD;
over, a patient man always told the, children to mind&#xD;
what their mother said to them, and never to cross her&#xD;
in her wishes.&#xD;
And yet Mrs. ?ipps was solicitous about others as&#xD;
wel1'a~ herself. She would send Sammy a mile out of&#xD;
his way after school to inquire how old Captain Bodwell&#xD;
did ; and she sent with the message an "infallible&#xD;
reciDe" for his gout, which she cut out of an almanac,&#xD;
and a recipe for nice bread, for his cook to try. To Mrs.&#xD;
Budd she ordered ~a nice jelly, after she had fretted&#xD;
abo~it its being slightly aeid; and there was not a ease&#xD;
of soarletina, cough, ~r asthma, among her acquaintances,&#xD;
bitt she could recommend a cute; so she was not a&#xD;
se~#sk woman, ~u~d Mrs. Pipps, although a great trial&#xD;
at home, was quite popular abroad. As to visiting, she&#xD;
never did more than make a call, and that must be some&#xD;
delightful moxriing, in a close* carriage, with the #trict&#xD;
injunction if the wind veered easterly to be driven back&#xD;

~omo peQple wondered this woman did not read more,&#xD;
and divert her attention from self. But, suppose she&#xD;
took a newspaper. Why, the first thing her eye would&#xD;
rest upon would be a "late awful tragedy," or some-&#xD;
body was "robbed ;" and such a fermentation ensued,&#xD;
one might fancy her almost deranged. And then, the&#xD;
fear that Mr. Pipps was assassinated, if he ch~inced to&#xD;
stay out an hour later than usual, drove her into hyster-&#xD;
ics, and hartshorn, and cold water, and valerian, all lost&#xD;
their power. Sometimes sudden sickness seized her, and&#xD;
then she fancied her flannels were not well aired, or too&#xD;
much wind blew into the clamber through the key-hole,&#xD;
and the windows and doors must henceforth be air-proof.&#xD;
Another severe trial to her was living near an engine-&#xD;
house. She never slept soundly (such people never do),&#xD;
and her fear lest the fire was in her husband's store, or&#xD;
down at iNetty's house (her married daughter's), knew&#xD;
no bounds until Mr. Pipps was up and dressed, and in.-&#xD;
terrogated the firemen; thus knowing, for a certainty,&#xD;
where the great smoke came from. There never ~was a&#xD;
watchman's rattle sprung from midsummer to midwinter&#xD;
but she heard it; and then she knew there were thieves,&#xD;
or some foul play, and she would sit tup wrapped in flan-&#xD;
nels and dressing-gown and shawls, until she ha4 ascer.&#xD;
tamed the cause. Finallyher disposition was so excitable&#xD;
that both husband and daughters kept much concealed&#xD;
from her; but, if by chance it ever got reported, a&#xD;
heavy woe rested on the household. And she was such&#xD;
a prey to superstitious fears that her mind was never at&#xD;
ease. She saw letters with black seals in burning can-&#xD;
dles, and heard death-watches behind her bed, and&#xD;

with gloomy forebodings.&#xD;
Things grew worse and worse. Mr. Pipps had no rest&#xD;
day nor night, and such self~denying men will wear out&#xD;
after a while. Indeed, nobody thought his life desirable,&#xD;
a*4 old Aunt Esther said she thought "he would have a&#xD;
dry funeral." The "general debility," which had fob&#xD;
lowed him for years, took a more decided form, and after&#xD;

large gilded signs, no advertisements describing the fas-&#xD;

domestic annoyances, - no fretful wives, no crying&#xD;

of a few hundreds annually, a man can recline on a most&#xD;
luxurious ~couch, or play "billiards," "chess," oz'&#xD;
"whist," whenever and with (almost) whomsoever he&#xD;
desires a game, women excepted!&#xD;
Now, what if one does keep late hours with such&#xD;

upon? Has she never seriously interposed about having&#xD;
her own will and way, and teased the "dear man"&#xD;

THE TRAITOR'S END.&#xD;
"MORE than half a century ago, a terrible storm swept&#xD;
over the city of London. It was the hour of midnight,&#xD;
when the blast was beating most piteously, that an aged&#xD;
clergyman was aroused by a piercing cry for helps lie&#xD;
rose, threw~ide his curtain, and beheld the form of a&#xD;
rude man, who appeared as a. common street-sweepers.&#xD;
he r~ii poured in torrents, but the imploring accents&#xD;
the call induced the preacher to take the arm of bi~&#xD;
guide; and, threading his way through narrow street&#xD;
and rude ~thoroughfares, he arrived at a rude dwelling&#xD;
wherein lay a dying man.&#xD;
"A strange tale was his. That very day a sra1~ger9&#xD;
advanced in life, had fallen speechless at the scavenger's&#xD;
door. The kind4iearted scavenger had lifted hirii from&#xD;
the ~~vement, opened for him his bed, warmed' hi~ feet9&#xD;
administered a cordial to his lips, and x~oiV he wa~&#xD;
dying!"&#xD;
The apa~inen~ was indeed a dreary one. Up a long&#xD;
flight of rickety ~taix~nside a door' half~.hingele8s, en a&#xD;
narrow pallet of straw, lay this same stranger. The&#xD;
lamp burnt 'dimly on ~ broken chair; a few fading ems.&#xD;
bers were on yonder hearth; a teapot without a handle&#xD;

in ~undry panes were stuffed coarse pieces of clothing.&#xD;
A valise stood by the bedside - it was the only property&#xD;
which the stranger brought with him. The man was&#xD;
only half-dressed; his coat was thrown aside, his neck&#xD;
was loosely encased within a low shirt-collar, but upon&#xD;
his legs there were a pair of huge mi1itar~ boots!&#xD;
That face! There was an expression there which, once&#xD;
looked upon, would haunt your memory forever! That&#xD;
forehead, bold and manly; hair slightly changed by age;&#xD;
lips compressed, but yet moving, as if life were loth to&#xD;
quit its hold, and large, rolling eyes that beamed with&#xD;
a~i unearthly glare.&#xD;

went that poor man's heart, - for he was dying. The&#xD;
clergyman took h6ld of that clenched hand, and gently&#xD;
bending his head, incjuired, "My friend, hast thou a&#xD;
Obristian faith?"&#xD;
"Christian?" he e d~. in a loud voice, for the first&#xD;
time, and in a deep tone,~ ibli made the preacher traui~&#xD;
bk. "Will Christianity giv~ m~ b~ack my henori Go&#xD;

the sting of remorse is throbbing in these very temples;&#xD;
judgments are imprecated by dark demons; a tarnished&#xD;
name, a nation's dishonor, ax~d the curse of unborn in-&#xD;
fants, even now ring through my soul!"&#xD;
The minister had watched beside many impenitent sin-&#xD;
ners, many rebels, whose hands were stained with blood,&#xD;
but never had he been called to such a death-bed.&#xD;
Suddenly the man arose. With a mighty energy he&#xD;
paced that creaking floor. If the storm was without, so&#xD;
was it within in a most terrific form. Those white, bony&#xD;
fingers laid hold of the valise, which stood by the bed-&#xD;
side, and drew from thence a faded military coat lined&#xD;
with silver, and an old parchment, in a piece of damp&#xD;
cloth, that looked like the wreck of a battle-flag.&#xD;
Look," said ~the stranger, "this coat is spotted with&#xD;
ood," - bygone days seemed to rise before him,&#xD;
"this. coat covered me when I heard of the battle of&#xD;
Lexington, when I planted the flag of triumph on Ticon-&#xD;
deroga; that bullet-hole was driven trough at the siege&#xD;
of Quebec-and now look at me! I-am~--~-ietme&#xD;
whisper softly in your ear ha! they will hear -"&#xD;
One burning word was said only one. "Now help&#xD;
me,"~ cont1in~ied he, "to put on this coat, for I have&#xD;
no wife, no child to. wipe the cold sweat from my brow.&#xD;
I must die alone; let me die as on the battle-field, with-&#xD;
out a fear."&#xD;
And while he sat arrayed in that tarnished co~, the&#xD;
preacher spoke to..hjm comforting words of, faith, in&#xD;
Christ, of hope for &amp;amp;ying penitents, o1 mercy pleading&#xD;
with justice, of that faith whioka Ufts effith~frown,~ az~d&#xD;

th~ death-chill was on his frame, -~ death-light, too, wa~&#xD;

over the blue waters, relating pleasant stories of his&#xD;
sieges? Is there not George of England wailing over&#xD;
lost colonies? And here a1m I, I the first that&#xD;
struck the note of freedom, the first that gave the bloW&#xD;
to that king, here. am I, dying like a dog, howling&#xD;
over treachery, lost in pangs of remorse."&#xD;
The preacher stepped back awe-struck. Who was&#xD;
before hixx~? Again the heart throbbed, the death-watch&#xD;
was heard in the wall, the death-rattle seemed hardly&#xD;
suppressed in the throat.&#xD;
"Silence along the lines there!" murmured the&#xD;
dying stranger; "not a whisper; not one, for your liv&#xD;
are at stake. Montgomery, we will meet in the centre&#xD;
of. the tow~x. We will have victory or death! There&#xD;
are steep rooks, silence, every man, as we move up&#xD;

freedom'! What care we for darkness and storm? Hurra!&#xD;
Now, now, one blow more and Quebec is gone, it is&#xD;
ours!"&#xD;
A ghastly look is there. The pale cheek, the glassy&#xD;
eye, th~ heaving bosom, the wild stare, the death-rattle,&#xD;
the tottering step, and lo! lie has fallen on the floor!&#xD;
Who is this strange man dying in a garret? this&#xD;
mark of nobility crushed like a moth ? - this wretched&#xD;
maniac, still clinging to his faded flag and his rusty uni-&#xD;
"Wh#uce come these ftre~ of remorse? -this faint hope&#xD;
&#xD;
of heaven? - this more than tbar of hell? Where the&#xD;
parchment where the flag ?'&#xD;
Let us unroll the flag. It is a blue banner, with only&#xD;
thirteen stars upon it. But what of 'the parchment T ~It&#xD;
is a colonel's commission in the continental army, ad-i&#xD;
dressed to Benedict Arnold.&#xD;
Unhonored and unwept, there lay the' traitor! His&#xD;
~corpse was in a rude house; he was unknown 'and&#xD;
unpitied, save by strangers. Yet that right arm had&#xD;
struck many a blow for freedom; but, for one act of base&#xD;
perfidy, he has fallen forever. Quenched is the light&#xD;
of his farmer glory; remorse hangs like a thunder-bolt&#xD;
over his soul, and his last agonies are those of a dis-&#xD;
'~graced man, who might have been a victorious and suc-&#xD;
c~ssful hero.&#xD;
Now, in dirnly.lighted rooms, when children beg of&#xD;
aged grandsires to tell them tales of the Revolution,&#xD;
Arnold; the traitor, is foremost in their thought ; 'and&#xD;
then the dreadful effects of ti~eason are narrated. We&#xD;
are told that he left the great metropolis, that he engaged&#xD;
in commerce, that his warehouses were in Nova Scotia,&#xD;
that his ships were in many ports; but in one night his&#xD;
stately warehouses were laid in ashes' - the owner was&#xD;
suspected as the incendiary. The entire population of the&#xD;
British provInces' assembled in a mass, sand in Bight of&#xD;
his wife they hung an effigy, whereon was inscribed,&#xD;
"Arnold, the traitor!" When he stood beside kings,'&#xD;
when in the house of lords, all faces were turned, and&#xD;
all fingers raised. One venerable lord arose, and&#xD;
declared that he could not speak to his sovereign in&#xD;
the presence of a traitor.&#xD;

father? You told Aunt Charlotte you had. all the&#xD;
money."&#xD;
"Hush, child! what are you talking about? I did.&#xD;
nQt say so."&#xD;
"Why, yes, mother,- you said he was poor, and had&#xD;
you thought of being burdened with so many. 'country&#xD;
cousins,' as you call them, you never would have had&#xD;
him. Don't you like Aunt Phoebe, and Aunt Folly, arid&#xD;
Aunt Judy? I 'in sure I do."&#xD;
"Why, Agnes, you are crazy, I believe! When did&#xD;
you ever hear your mother talk so? Tell me instantly."&#xD;
"Yesterday, ma, when, I sat in the back parlor, and&#xD;
you and aunt were in the front one. I 'm sure you said&#xD;
so, dear mother, and I pity you very much,- for you&#xD;
told aunt there was a time, before I was born, when&#xD;
father drank too much,.-.. and then, you know, you spoke&#xD;
of the 'pledge,' and said how glad you were that the&#xD;
temperance reform saved him."&#xD;
"~y dear, I was talking of somebody else, I think.&#xD;
We were speaking of Uncle Jethro and his family."&#xD;
"But they have no Agnes, mother, and-you know you&#xD;
told about father's failure in business~- Uncle ~Jethro&#xD;

"You 'ye told quite enough, my child. What do you&#xD;

aunt and I must 'have all our privacy retailed in this&#xD;

"Not mother, I have n't, because I thought it would&#xD;
hurt his feelings. I love my father, and I never tell&#xD;
him anything to make him unhappy~&#xD;
Agnes sat looking in the fire, and asked, "Mother, if&#xD;
people really~ love others, do they? ever talk against&#xD;
them 3 Didn't you tell me never to speak of any home&#xD;

tell. we never to repeat them, and I never do."&#xD;

despicable characters. Don't yoti ever let me know of&#xD;
your doing the like again. You d&amp;amp;n'~'hear ri~gAt, and&#xD;
you make ~t great deal of mischief in this way."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PASS-BOOK.&#xD;
THE greatest accommodation to a young housekeeper,&#xD;
is a "little blue-covered book," containing an "account."&#xD;
For a time it pu~ts her aIt ease in every particular. ~he&#xD;
never teases her husban~t for little wants; far, send this&#xD;
"book" to the grocer, the kind, accommodating man&#xD;
will put up anything you desire, and if he has not got it&#xD;
on hand, what is the difference 3----he will get it for you.&#xD;
Some families have a large amount of Wants. Not 'only&#xD;
eatables are included, but dry goods; and this is of great&#xD;
moment to a woman, to open an account with a large&#xD;
firm who literally keep everything&#xD;
We are presupposing one's credit to be undoubted, and&#xD;
the smiles and urbanity of the shopkeeper will not be&#xD;
wanting. lie knows your husband, and assures you he&#xD;
cares not how largely or long you are his debtor; - he&#xD;
never expects b~~t semi-annual payments; and six&#xD;
months ahead seems, with some purchasers, a long&#xD;
period, during which time ten thousand clian~es of getting&#xD;
money float before their vision.&#xD;
"Thank fortune!" exclaimed TJiomizs Oarney, as be&#xD;
threw d#wn some settled accounts; "this is the last bill I&#xD;
owe on earth, and I have ~ve dollars left untouched,&#xD;

wife. Let people say what they will, housekeeping is&#xD;
far 1eheaper than boarding."&#xD;
Netty, the young wife, bit her lips, and wiped the&#xD;
perspiration from her brow. Alas, for tlie book at the&#xD;
dry goods establishment! It had now come to be the&#xD;
first of July, and the young housekeeper was in hourly&#xD;
expectancy of her bill. The book she had left some days&#xD;
before, that the account might be added.&#xD;
This was an expected guest, moreover, which she knew&#xD;
would surely arrive. One might expect an aunt or&#xD;
cousin for months, a sister from the western country, a&#xD;
brother' from the West Indies, and some unforeseen cir-&#xD;
cumstance might prevent their arrival. But who ever&#xD;
heard of an account's being delayed long, or not being&#xD;
sent at all? If the creditor fails or dies, is there not a&#xD;
consignment of the books, or a final settlement of the&#xD;
"effects" '1 You cannot hope to evade such visitors as&#xD;
these..&#xD;
Thomas and ~{etty sat on the sofa, at the close of the&#xD;
third day. in July, contemplating who 'and what they&#xD;
should~ see on the morrow., They had been married&#xD;
seven months, a~id riot a word of altercation had, passed&#xD;
between them. She was all he desired; he w~s more&#xD;
than, she expected, '--a conclusion which young couples&#xD;
are very apt to come to at seven months, perhaps, more&#xD;
generally than at the end of seven years. In this con-&#xD;
sciousness of joy, and full of hope, Ketty sat completing&#xD;
a splendid muslin frock for herself to wear on the mor-&#xD;
row, when the bell rang~loudly. She started to go to&#xD;
the d~or, but was driven back by Thomas, who rebuked&#xD;
&#xD;
her mildly for interfering with his business when Dinah&#xD;
was out.&#xD;
Ketty 'listened, -she 'trembled, it was "the ac-&#xD;
count," for she heard the carrier ask, "If it would be&#xD;
convenient to giVe them an early call ?"&#xD;
Thomas, thinking it to be but, a trifle, asked the lad&#xD;
to step in, and he would then settle it. Merciful Heaven!&#xD;
What is it? Did it belong to him? A long sheet of&#xD;
bill-paper literally filled, finely written, and &amp;amp; variety&#xD;
of items on many single lines.&#xD;
"Is this your account?" eaid he to his wife, with a&#xD;
scowl, the first scowl that she had ever seen upon his&#xD;
brow.&#xD;
"I have an account with Lombardie &amp;amp; Co.," said she;&#xD;
"but I was not aware of so many items, Thomas, truly~&#xD;
What is the sum total?"&#xD;
"Two hundred and five dollars and six cents."&#xD;
"Impossible!" said Netty, springing from her seat.&#xD;
"That is impossible. I did suppose I might be indebted&#xD;
some twenty-five dollars to the firm. It can't exceed&#xD;
thirty. This, sir,'~' said she, to the young man who pre.&#xD;
rented the bill, "is a mistake. I never had half the&#xD;
articles"&#xD;
The young man happened to be the assistant book..&#xD;
keeper, and felt not a little nettled at this off-hand&#xD;
declaration.&#xD;
But the young wife pretended to show the errors.&#xD;
"There is a silk dress; I never, surely, had such an&#xD;
article."&#xD;
"Why,"~said Thomas, "what was the color of the&#xD;
dress you had wade to attend Mrs. Wilkins' patty?"&#xD;

"That blue.spotted,~ Netty, I disliked 50 much. I&#xD;

~{etty colored "Mechlin lace at a dollar per yard.&#xD;
I have no recollection of more than two yards, bought&#xD;
last February."&#xD;
Bn~t~ lace, insertion, edgings, and fancy trimmings,&#xD;
swelle4 the amount most prodigiously; and, after making&#xD;
sundry dissenting protestations, it was concluded, if there&#xD;
were any mistakes, they should be rectified. And the ~pre~&#xD;
seuter, of this trying sheet ~very willingly made his exit.&#xD;
"Thomas," said Netty, when they were alone, "I&#xD;
naver bad half these articles."&#xD;
"Woni~n a~e very apt to be forgetful, when the&#xD;
money is not paid, wife, at the time."&#xD;
"Two hundred dollars! I never had such an amount&#xD;
in. the world," was the constant' reiteration. "Lombar-&#xD;
die, i~ a very pleasant and agreeable man one of the&#xD;
kindest and most obliging shop-keepers in the world.&#xD;
Re never had a Ixergain but he told ma of it; and many&#xD;
a time~ has ~h$ let ziw have some desirable shade of silk,&#xD;
or a fashionable pattern of lace, much cheaper than I&#xD;
cwgd have procured it, had I the money in my pocket."&#xD;
"?eh, nonsense, Netty! if you had the money in&#xD;
your pocket, think you the amount would have been&#xD;
withdrawn for the same artielesV'&#xD;
"$ut I have always made good purebases, Thomas,&#xD;
and received my money's worth for what I have. cx-&#xD;
p~4Q4~ All the trouble is, I have not kad all the&#xD;
itez~ip here speoi~ed."&#xD;
&#xD;
" I know nothing about tka4 Notty; but I do won-&#xD;
der, knowing my salary as you did, you should have&#xD;
ventured so largely upon credit, without consulting me.&#xD;
I know not how I shall procure the means to settle this&#xD;
bill; I have only five dollars towards it in the world. It&#xD;
will take a long time, and great economy, to make up so&#xD;
large an amount."&#xD;
Ketty felt greatly disturbed, and did not omit the first&#xD;
opportunity to examine the bill in the presence of~the&#xD;
firm. In vain did she contend with this and' that article&#xD;
she had no recollection about. One circumstance after&#xD;
another was presented to her mind, and a dim conscious..&#xD;
ness seemed to revive almost every particular.&#xD;
"How many useless things!" said she, mentally, as&#xD;
she reviewed the bill. "There are ten yards of]3russels&#xD;
lace, I have never used it, but bought it so cheap!&#xD;
There is a piece of ribbon, -I did not want so much.&#xD;
Belts, silk hosiery, wrought handkerchiefs and collars,&#xD;
cufl~, coverings for the shoulders, -very pretty and very&#xD;
cheap; but as the money was not immediately called foV,&#xD;
all these articles were taken."&#xD;
It was a bitter experience, and. bitterly did she at one&#xD;
for it; hut it did not originate in a bad heart, it was a&#xD;
thoughtless expenditure, and her attention had not been&#xD;
fixed upon the issue.&#xD;
"I am thinking," said she, to Thomas, as she~ knew&#xD;
he grew uneasy about the payment, "that I wil1~ do&#xD;
without Dinah; and the nine shillings per week I pay&#xD;
her shall be appropriated to the payment of my foolish&#xD;
debt. I need to ftel the folly every day, and such an&#xD;
experience will entfrel~ cure ~&#xD;

been disposed of in aw auction room, and Netty has no&#xD;

~The little passbook" is frequently of great service&#xD;
with experienced housekeepers; but the cominou propen-&#xD;
sity to take more than is necessary, because payment is&#xD;
delayed a few weeks, often swells the amount far beyond&#xD;
etir~ expectation. In little trifles, large a~nounts will&#xD;

POSTERITY.&#xD;
"WirAT al'e you planting those trees~ fur?" inquired&#xD;
a young stripling of a venerable man. "You will never&#xD;
live to eat the fruit, nor yet to ~ee them blossom."&#xD;
"If I do not," replied the old man, "you may;. atid.&#xD;
if you do not, 8omebod!,t will; and so I shall confer a&#xD;
benefit to posterity."&#xD;
"I love my ease too well," remarked the young man,&#xD;
"to work for unknown beings."&#xD;
"Poor fellow! " retorted the aged man; "1 pity you,&#xD;
and if the fruit of my labor should come to maturity in&#xD;
my lifetime, you shall have a portion of it."&#xD;
The youth was so struck at 'the picture of disinterest-&#xD;
edness, that he ever after became a cheerful worker for&#xD;
posterity.&#xD;
The old man lived, and age neither bowed his fram~&#xD;
nor "abated his natural force," and the trees he planted&#xD;
flourished and brought forth fruit. True to his promise,&#xD;
when he firs(gathered the fruit he took a portion of the&#xD;
ripest and best. to his friend, who tived at some distance&#xD;
from his dwelling, and when he ard, thus addressed&#xD;
him:&#xD;
"Young man, the first gatherings from the trees I&#xD;
planted f~r posterity I hare brought to your table; and&#xD;

Ne~er hesitate to work, at any period of life. It may&#xD;
be the benefit will not come to thyself; but always re-&#xD;
member, the fruits of thylabor will be a blessing to pos-&#xD;

The young man thanked the sire for his gentle re~&#xD;
proof, and heeded the less~n. What he spent before in&#xD;
luxury, he laid by as a sacred trust, either to benefit the&#xD;
present age, or to be a blessing to those who came after&#xD;
him. Lie died, and a large. property was given to be-&#xD;
nevolent enterprises; so that to this day many bless his&#xD;
memory~&#xD;

THE FARM&#xD;
&#xD;
NEAR TILE DEPOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
SOMEWhERE about the spring of 1849, the health of'&#xD;
Mrs. Frink began to decline. She was yelloW as th~&#xD;
dandelion that sprung up in her pathway, and weak as&#xD;
the tender violet in its premature bloom. She consulted&#xD;
with her f~mi1y physician what course of life would be&#xD;
most likely to result in a permanent benefit.' 2U~ talked&#xD;
of a sea-voyage; but how could she leave her young&#xD;
family  ~ Of a season at Havana; but how could, her&#xD;
husband leave his business ~I We all know, likewise, that&#xD;
unless we can leave dull care behind us, or t~ake it with&#xD;
us, no benefit can accrue to a weak stomach.&#xD;
Finally, it was arranged that they should retire upon&#xD;
a farm., somewhere near the sea-shore, on account of&#xD;
the salubrity of the air, and the double benefit which&#xD;
would thus accrue to the little Frinks. But where was&#xD;
such a place to be found ~ lit must be easily accessible&#xD;
from the city~ for Mr. Frink by no means thought of relin-&#xD;
quishingixis business in the metropolis. Indeed, his&#xD;
means wrnld not perjait him to do so, had he desired it.&#xD;
sow, there were I indispensable things to be secured&#xD;
by this purchase o a farm. It must have a neat, sub..&#xD;
stantial dweUiRg-house upon it, and out-houses to match;&#xD;
well divided "into pasturage, woodland and tillage;"&#xD;

&#xD;
theti an experienced farmer must be secured to take&#xD;
ch&amp;amp;vge of it; and, above all, it must be near tke depot.&#xD;
This was a prime consideration. Of course, after arriving&#xD;
at these conclusions, all the eyes of the family were turned&#xD;
to the public journals, and directed under the caption,&#xD;
"Farms to sell." Nearly a week passed before one'&#xD;
offered 'having the requisite conveniences; and. to show&#xD;
that such an one was, now presented, we copy the adver-&#xD;
tisenient~, verbatim.&#xD;
"BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY-SEAT FOR SALE.&#xD;
"The well-known estate of 'Mr. Oliver Shaft, situated&#xD;
in Oakdale, eight miles from the city, is offered for sale.&#xD;
It is in the heart of the village, on a beautiful slope over-&#xD;
looking the sea, commanding an extensive view of the&#xD;
shipping and intervening agricultural scenery; the farm&#xD;
contains about thirty acres of~prime land, all of the very&#xD;
best quality for cultivation, and can be improved by a&#xD;
gentleman of fortune, for a summer or permanent resi-&#xD;
dence, as he may require. The terms of payment can be&#xD;
made easy, as a part of the purch~ise-money may remain&#xD;
on mortgage, or the whole, would be exchanged i~r real&#xD;
estate in the eity.'~&#xD;
"Well," said Mrs. Frink, "I believe this is just the&#xD;
place for us, after all;" and again she re over the&#xD;
advertisement. "Stop," said .sh "I have omitted ~one&#xD;
thing; it adds, £ within a few rod the dep~'. At&#xD;
any rate, we~ will see this~place, and~. ~arrangeA~*s can&#xD;
be madei should have no sort of Qbj~Ct*n to di~posing&#xD;
&#xD;
of our city residence. It is ilot probable I shall'#irer&#xD;
desire to return."'&#xD;
"Wopien jump at conclusions," said Mr. Frink.&#xD;
That afternoon passage was taken in the cars for Oak-.&#xD;
dale. IBoth father and mother, with Jamie and little&#xD;
Alva, and Hitty Frink, all alighted in a few moments at&#xD;
Oakdale. With an eager curiosity, they cast a look in&#xD;
every direction for their new home; but could it be&#xD;
possible? - all the one which could any way answer the&#xD;
description, was on yonder hill, a dilapidated old castle&#xD;
of a house, with falling out-buildings,1 and this was the&#xD;
"Shaft. place!" "How unlike the advertisement!"&#xD;
remarked Mrs. Frink.&#xD;
~' Nothing was said about the buildings, if I recollect&#xD;
rightly," replied Mr. Frink.&#xD;
Mr. Oliver Shaft 'was seen, in his long dressing-gown,&#xD;
seated upon the piazz~., reading his newspaper, for if was&#xD;
a mild spring day, as they proceeded towards the house.&#xD;
"We wish to take a survey of your grounds," said&#xD;
Mr. Fink, "with the intention of becoming purchasers;&#xD;
but the dilapidated look of the buildings has rather put&#xD;
the yeto upon 'my wife's intention." Mrs~ Frink here&#xD;
coughed violentlyand thought the sea-breeze too bracing.&#xD;
"The fact is," said Squire Shaft, "our sons have all&#xD;
settled in the city, and their mothers anxious to follow&#xD;
theta; none of them took a liking to farming, and, as we&#xD;
are getting a little advanced in life, I being turned of&#xD;
seventy, and. myg~ife being not far from that corner, we&#xD;
thought we~woul~ dispose. of our farm."&#xD;
Mrs. Shag, a large, %teshy old lady, with a rul4e4nd&#xD;

re~4l~ I~ped t1~ey were people who meant to purchase,&#xD;
for s1i~ was l~eartily tired of showing the house to people&#xD;
who caine jis for curiosity."&#xD;
They folly e lamed th~ object Qt' thmr visit, and the&#xD;
~W lady ye nmenced hetjabors~ "here," said she, throw-&#xD;
i~g open an old door, that the wet weather made swing&#xD;
very rei~iet~ntly, "here is a large, nice room, look~&#xD;
ing right out ou the sea, ships and all beautiful and&#xD;
airy9 QQr ])orcas was married here, and she has made&#xD;
~ut so poorly, it never seemS 50 pleasant to me since; "and&#xD;
a deep sigh was heard. "And here is a room for yarbs&#xD;
and clutter - it was made for a china closet, I spose, but&#xD;
I never kept any in it. And this is our Thomas's bed~&#xD;
room when he CQIflOS out of a night or so; and this is '~y&#xD;
old man's and my room; there is the sitting-room, and&#xD;
here~ is a kind of hack parlor. The next story has eight&#xD;
ehanibeirs, besides the elI, where the man sleeps; it 's a&#xD;
monstrous house," she conebided, "and a sight of work&#xD;
to keep it clean." As it bore no marks of being kept so,&#xD;
how did the old lady know how to calculate? To be&#xD;
sure, it bore marks of former grandeur; but, scantily&#xD;
furnished, and with z~umberless signs of decay, it did&#xD;
look uninviting But, thought Mr~ Frink, if it can be&#xD;
bought for a bargain, I will take it; repairs can be made,&#xD;
and that paaturo out back might be divided into house~.&#xD;
lots, and sold at a grand speculation.&#xD;
1~r&amp;amp; Frink did not seem so. much elated with he~&#xD;
prospects. The~house was old and dirty, and a great job&#xD;
it would be to make it look "geute~l." "But,~then,"&#xD;
ike kept repeating, ~" it is so near ~he depoi!" (LI~v~&#xD;
found th.t out, to my sorrow! '~ remarked old lady 8ha~&#xD;
&#xD;
"Tat, tat, wife," replied&amp;amp; the old man, "you are getting&#xD;
old and clumsy to wait on visitors; I dare say this lady&#xD;
delights to entertain them."&#xD;
"So do I," continued the old dame; "but who wants&#xD;
Toni, Dick, and harry, just for their own convenience,&#xD;
when there 's not a mite of friendship in 'em?"&#xD;
Mrs. Frink said, how forcibly that remark reminded&#xD;
her of her mother's sayings; she supposed all old people&#xD;
felt so about too much company; for her own part, she&#xD;
hated to 1~e alone.&#xD;
But' the price; that was the desideratum. The old&#xD;
man asked ten thousand dollars. The depot-master said&#xD;
it could be bought for ,a great deal less money; and-&#xD;
how much less he promised to ascertain and inform Mr.&#xD;
Frink the following week. * But did they really want it&#xD;
at any price? ~Those large, open rooms rose before Mrs.&#xD;
Frink, and she imagined how the ~wind would whistle&#xD;
in a violent storm through the interstices; but then it&#xD;
was airy, and it could be made to do.&#xD;
The follow~g week Mr. Frink oame home with the&#xD;
title deeds, and told his wife the purchase was secured,&#xD;
provided she signed her right of dower in their present&#xD;
home; for they had made an exchange nearly even, and&#xD;
he considered it a decided bargain.&#xD;
Jn a month after they were at Oakdale; but Mr.&#xD;
Frink looked dissatisfied, and well he~ might, for,' upon&#xD;
re~$xamination of the deeds, he found that pasture he in~&#xD;
tended to divide into lots, was "to be kept forever open,&#xD;
subject to no buildings thereupon." Strange such a&#xD;
clause should have slipped his eye !&#xD;

Mr. Frink thought it best his family should be on&#xD;
the spot to~ superintend the improvements; but, what&#xD;
with the dampness and exposure, little Alva was seized&#xD;
with the scarlatina, Jamie with a croup, and the little&#xD;
girl with the measles! Yet this movement was all&#xD;
made to benefit Mrs. 'Frink! And now she must have&#xD;
her city doctor; nobody else was acquainted with the&#xD;
constitutions of her 'children, and the old ~nurse and she&#xD;
did so long for the friendly attentions of her old neighbor~&#xD;
hood. She felt among strangers; and Nelly, the cook,&#xD;
had already announced her intention of leaving. A man&#xD;
&amp;amp;iid his wife had taken the farm upon shares, and' very&#xD;
difficult people Were they likely to prove. Mr. Frink's&#xD;
share of the butter was almost always expended in cream,&#xD;
for the 'visitors now began t~ find the ~y out. 'The&#xD;
loneliness that Mrs. Frink feared, she was not likely to&#xD;
realize; people ~hoin she scarcely called upon now c~n~ie&#xD;
regular visi1~, and not a few maiden ladies were&#xD;
always on hand. And then Mr. Frink was away from&#xD;
the dinner-table, - he could not leave his business until&#xD;
five o'clock, 4-and what a care and ~dditionaI burden thus&#xD;
fell upon the wife's shoulders I The children greatly&#xD;
took advantage of their' father's absence, and Hitty and&#xD;
Al Va required constant checks at the table. And then&#xD;
there were always some unexpected~ gnats, and when&#xD;
~I~~LOtkt pr~~ti~ion was made for th~ir ewn farnil~, "the&#xD;
&#xD;
e~tra oospauy must be. civilly treated,, and teii chances&#xD;
to one the provision-store was closed, and this threw Mrs.&#xD;
iI3~rink into a 'complete panic. Indeed, before a single&#xD;
quarter had passed, she wished herself in the wilds of&#xD;
Yerniont, rather than so near the depot.&#xD;
"Who could have thought it," said she to a friend,&#xD;
confidentially, "that old Captain hl3eers and his daughter&#xD;
would have come here to stay a week; and Susan Rivers&#xD;
and her child, because it was teething and so trouble.-&#xD;
some, and Mrs. Snyders and her adopted nephew, just to&#xD;
smell the sea-breezes? And all these I have had at one&#xD;
time! Mr. Frink was in New York, and our man actu.&#xD;
ally told me he could not raise vegetabk~s enough to&#xD;
stipply our table, leaving his share out of the question.&#xD;
Why, to tell you the plain truth, Mrs. Smith, I am worn&#xD;
to death. I have not had time to walk down by the shore&#xD;
since I came here; it 's nothing but, 'Ma, somebody is&#xD;
coming with a travelling-bag and valise.' And then&#xD;
they are so very glad to see me, and admire the place&#xD;
so much ~ It isso roomy, and so airy, 'so delightful, why,&#xD;
Mrs. Frink, I think you must be perfectly happy.' What&#xD;
can I do?" inquired Mrs. Jrink, with the deepest solici-&#xD;
tude. "It's a thousand times worse than being bored&#xD;
to death with country cousins in the city."&#xD;
This was "farming it," with a vengeance. The man&#xD;
brought in a bill in the autumn far exceeding the rent&#xD;
and cost of 'living in the city"; taxes were nearly in pro..&#xD;
portion, fuel was at the same rate, and the freightage of&#xD;
all the groceries must be paid over the railroad. Mr.&#xD;
Frink had a season ticket for his family, dined at a res~-&#xD;
tauraut, paid extra for doctor and nurse, they wore&#xD;

A TRYING CASE.&#xD;
ARTHUR BRANCH, £sq., returned to'the city from a&#xD;
fashionable watering-place to consult with his attorney&#xD;
respecting the laws of divorce. It is thought he finds&#xD;
them more stringent than he anticipated. lie was driven&#xD;
to this expedient at the suggestion of a female friend, who&#xD;
has interposed her meddlesome propensities between&#xD;
Mr. Branch and wife. It appears Branch was mar~&#xD;
ned more than a year ago to a city aristocrat. She&#xD;
had been the pride of her wealthy parents upwards of&#xD;
twenty summers; had coquetted at New York, and&#xD;
danced the polka at Saratoga; had stood on Table Rock&#xD;
a few days before it submerged, and, at the time of her&#xD;
engagement with Arthur Branch, Esq., was undergoing&#xD;
a process of flirtation with one Don Jose, a Spaniard, now&#xD;
banished by the C~ foray" to the mines, for ten years of&#xD;
solitary life.&#xD;
Mr. Branch can bring sufficient witnesses to prove that&#xD;
he has in all respects deported- himself. as a kind, loving~&#xD;
forgiving and forgetting married man. His purse has&#xD;
always hung outside his pocket, and its contents have been&#xD;
most freely expended. The main difficulty seems to lie&#xD;
in the discovery that Branch made a blunder in marry-&#xD;
ing. He supposed his wife to be an angel, and she&#xD;
proves to be a woman.&#xD;

&#xD;
Soon after their marriage Mrs. Branch proposed a trip&#xD;
to Europe. Her husband assented;* and after his ador-&#xD;
able "sposa" had consulted with Parisian milliners and&#xD;
London dressmakers to her heart's content, she declared&#xD;
her willingness to return without a sight of St. Peter's&#xD;
or a sail upon the Rhine; thus showing That her love of&#xD;
the frivolous overcame that of the sublinie.&#xD;
Mr. Branch had no sooner taken his American resi-&#xD;
~lence, and issued cards for his* first levee, than Mrs.&#xD;
Branch complained of "confined quarters," and proposed&#xD;
taking her summer residence at some watering-place.&#xD;
Since then she has become a perfect belle. Her first&#xD;
conquest seemed to be the favor Qf a young sprig in the&#xD;
medical faculty, and, under pretence of a singular hang-&#xD;
nail on the little finger of her left hand, Mr. Branch has&#xD;
been obliged to pay for medical advice upwards of two&#xD;
hundred dollars!&#xD;
All this he has borne with lamb-like resignation. He has&#xD;
~iever crossed his wife in a single particular. Just before&#xD;
the railroad jubilee, however, he did speak. Then he ex-&#xD;
pressed the desire to' open his metropolitan residence, and&#xD;
to invite a few of his select country friends, illuminate at&#xD;
evening, and end the festivities in a manner suited to the&#xD;
august occasion. The simple annunciation of this fact&#xD;
~threw his wife off her guard. She raved like a lioness.&#xD;
C~ Did he suppose she was going to soil her best drawing-&#xD;
rooms to please the 'blue noses;' or that she was going&#xD;
to give the use of her best chambers to country cousinS&#xD;
who were boorish enough to sleep in barns?"&#xD;
Branch did not urge the matter. His Monongahela&#xD;
whiskey reposed in its cask, his pale Sherry lay still in&#xD;
&#xD;
the quarter-cask, his Madeira and Hock were encircled&#xD;
with cobwebs, and Branch felt like one of the "invited&#xD;
guests." Worse than all, his wife kept the keys!&#xD;
if Lopez had dreaded a contest as much as our friend&#xD;
Branch, he woi~ld never have thought of possessing Cuba.&#xD;
Somebody told him a divorce might be obtained; but&#xD;
this was a female friend who~ had an eye to becoming his&#xD;
housekeeper. Unquestionably enough has been done,&#xD;
but how can it be proved ~ Besides, who wants to tell&#xD;
what they do know?&#xD;
The attorney advised Branch ~o return to his wife,&#xD;
conciliate her confidence, agree upon some terms amica-&#xD;
bly, and make the best of a bad job. Branch paid ten&#xD;
dollars for the advice, wiped his eyes with an embroidered&#xD;
handkerchief; and added, with a dolorous sigh, "but I&#xD;
am afraid she will pick my eyes out."&#xD;
The last telegraphic account reports the matter "all&#xD;
settled." ~Branch holds the reins while l~iis lady and a&#xD;
Spanish gentleman sit upon the back seat. She eats&#xD;
boiled custard with a silver fork, while Branch uses a&#xD;
spoon. The Spanish gentleman has heavy hair under&#xD;
his chin, and huge whiskers; Branch has &amp;amp; smooth face,&#xD;
and shaves 'clean. These are only~ outside diftbrences;&#xD;
but things of weightier consequence we pass by. The&#xD;
moral of our story consists 'in this: Never marry a co-&#xD;
quet for her beauty, nor an aristocrat for her money.&#xD;
Never believe in walking divinities, nor terrestrial an~els.&#xD;
But should you be so unfortunate as to make si~ch a&#xD;
mistake, pocket the knowledge, and never divulge the&#xD;
fact; for everybody laughs over the rehearsal of family&#xD;
jars, and nobody pities a married man.&#xD;

SUDSTANO1~ AND SHADOW8~        20g&#xD;
&#xD;
THE EARLY SPRING FLOWERS.&#xD;
THAT little bunch of crocuses! They shot up from&#xD;
the cold, damp earth which encased their roots, and, all&#xD;
delicately attired in their pure virgin whiteness, seemed&#xD;
to cast an upward glance, as if by instinct taught that&#xD;
Heaven provides for the defenceless. They were the&#xD;
admiration of every passer-by ~ little fairy children, who&#xD;
looked through the interstices which enclosed them, would&#xD;
fain have borne them away as the earliest of spring fl~ow-&#xD;
ers; and more matured lovers of the beautiful paused&#xD;
and gazed with wonder, that beneath such an inclement&#xD;
sky, so courageous a little bunch of rousess should open&#xD;
to the first balmy influences of spring! Yet there was&#xD;
an association of sadness which pervaded the thoughts of&#xD;
some beholders. They bloomed beneath a deserted man-&#xD;
sion, whose owner was dead; and the gardener, who,&#xD;
years ago, had so enriched their bed of earth, he, too, had&#xD;
departed I In the window just above them, bright eyes&#xD;
had looked upon their early unfolding, and carefully had&#xD;
the protecting shield been thrown around them when the&#xD;
hoar-frost and icy snow had bound them in their winter&#xD;
shzggishness. Yet early was that warm covering re-&#xD;
moved, and the earth stirred gently, and the sun then&#xD;
shot down some of those slanting, but warm rays~ which&#xD;
&#xD;
quickened their germination; and with what delight the&#xD;
fair maiden looked upon the little parterre of fiowerp&#xD;
which so early met her gaze! And now she, too, was&#xD;
gone, and the magnificent mansion was laid in ruins, and&#xD;
the hand of improvement had torn down its massy walls,&#xD;
and the sound of the hammer was heard demolishing its&#xD;
once fair proportions, and rough ~boards were protruded&#xD;
over our little fiower.bed, and no kind glance from the&#xD;
owner ever recognized their beauty; yet still they&#xD;
bloomed on, and even added a new tinge to their petals,&#xD;
for the purple dye w~is now intermixed with the soft&#xD;
white, and their blended colors sweetly attested how true&#xD;
is nature to the laws which govern even the humblest of&#xD;
her productions! And do we see no simile~ in natural&#xD;
to spiritual beauty ~&#xD;
The proprietor of that mansion left a daughter. Her&#xD;
spirit was as guileless as the snow-drop she loved to tend;&#xD;
her voice sweetly harmonized with the lute she so euw&#xD;
chantingly played, and the 'soft touches of nature and&#xD;
art seemed to ally her to the angelic rather than mortal&#xD;
elements of humanity. ~he~ was the admiration of all;&#xD;
yet there was no hauteur of demeanor, no arrogance of&#xD;
spirit, no supercilious scorn; but she gently moved in&#xD;
that upward path which knows no deviation from the dic-&#xD;
tates of duty and filial aiThetion.&#xD;
Scores of wealthy young men danced in the joyous&#xD;
sunbeams which her cheerful spiri~ threw around her;&#xD;
yet she refused them all for the high..toned, lofty worth&#xD;
of one born in obscurity, yet destined to be great, because&#xD;
he improved the matchless wealth which lay in his ye~&#xD;
undeveloped resources. And now she was sneered at by&#xD;

thos~ who once bowed inadoration at her fireside ; cold&#xD;
glances of recognition came from those who once deemed&#xD;
her the fairest of maidens. Yet, possessed of the entire&#xD;
affection of him to whom she had lighted her vows of&#xD;
eternal constancy, what cared she for the glances of mere&#xD;
fashionable adoration? Like the early spring flowers, she&#xD;
was unobtrusive, and felt defended by the strength of his&#xD;
affection, of whose f~rvor~ and unchanging confidence she&#xD;
had theAeepest assurance. The world looked on and talked&#xD;
of the disparity between their earthly stations; they&#xD;
spoke contemptuously of those lowly born being thus&#xD;
brought to mingle in palaces; yet the lover was unmoved&#xD;
by such declamation, and slowly and steadily he pursued&#xD;
his way, climbing up the hill of science, and implanting&#xD;
such deep footsteps, that the imprints were iitot worn out&#xD;
by light feet that followed after hi~n.&#xD;
Years passed by, and the marriage day approached.&#xD;
The owner of the mansion "was gathere~l to his fathers;"&#xD;
the wealth of the father had descended to that only child;&#xD;
yet she chose not to keep up the ancestral palace, for the&#xD;
pomp and vain glare of heartless friends had sickened her&#xD;
of gorgeous splendors. She cared not for the prismatic&#xD;
colorings of the ricltchandelier, nor yet for the frescoed&#xD;
walls, which an artist so elaborately executed. She chose&#xD;
simple nature in a suburban home; and there, amidst&#xD;
the chirping of insects, and the songs of the~ birds, and&#xD;
the lovely summer-house, and the adjacent green-house&#xD;
of rare ,exotics, she loved to commune with nature. Her&#xD;
husband, too, with his early rural taste unvitiated, gently&#xD;
stole away from the cares of his office, and, at early twi~&#xD;
light, the happy pair seemed entranced with the love of&#xD;
&#xD;
the beautiful which surrounded them never forgetting&#xD;
the Giver of such bounty, while overshadowed with his&#xD;
beneficence. But they lived not the lives of mere her-&#xD;
mits, who selfishly enjoy, but do not bestow. Their home&#xD;
was the resort of the intelligent and inquiring; the stu-&#xD;
dent was there aided and cheered; the heavy-hearted was&#xD;
lightened beneath such genial quietude, and. the pure in&#xD;
K heart seemed to bask in one long~ hine of delight. Emi-&#xD;
nent in his profession, studio ; ostentatious, freely&#xD;
dispensing, yet always drinking themselves from the fount&#xD;
of that happiness which never cloys, in a vine.claddwel-&#xD;
hug, sheltered by overarching trees, lives she who tens&#xD;
anted the mansion, and he who was born in the cottage;&#xD;
conclusively showii~g that, if true to the laws which alone&#xD;
can dignify our nature, there need be no disparity be-&#xD;
tween our condition jn society; for he is only lowly bern&#xD;
whose life ana.actions declare him such. The clump of&#xD;
spring flowers \#ill rise as freshly from the cottage of her&#xD;
whose scanty pittance barely supphie~ her daily bread, as&#xD;
beneath tife windows of the most opulent mansion; there-&#xD;
fore, take courage, ye of ambitious aim, since lofty worth&#xD;
inquires not concerning the height of the dwelling which&#xD;
was its birthplace.&#xD;

&#xD;
LIGHT LND SHADE.&#xD;
IT was at the close ~f one Qf those deliejous days in&#xD;
autumn, when the foliage of the overarching trees looks&#xD;
like pyramids of gold, when we. tread lightly upon the'&#xD;
sward where the rustling leaves have 'thickly fellow~&#xD;
shipped together, and our souls are given to memories of&#xD;
love, or dwell sadly, yet tenderly, upon some object of&#xD;
aO~ction whem death or distance has separated; on the&#xD;
evening of such a day, that a mother and her two daugh-&#xD;
ters sought ,a retreat amid the recess~ of decaying&#xD;
nature, to enjoy a friendly conversation upon the son and&#xD;
brother, over whom so many sympathies had been ex-&#xD;
pe~ided since he had squght in a CalifQrnian home to pro-&#xD;
cure for theni the glittering dust which his inexperience&#xD;
had sugges~~to him~ was the panacea of all temporal ills.&#xD;
Never was a fairer specimen of manly bearing, of&#xD;
courageous heart and 'high resolves, exiled from the home&#xD;
of his infancy. Full of promise, fill. of magnanimity,&#xD;
with an heroic soul, he plunged into the a1l-t~bsorbing&#xD;
gulf of ambition and the attainment of a fortune. lie&#xD;
had bidden farewell to the church where he was baptized,&#xD;
to the green where he sported when a boy, an~ in a huge&#xD;
ship, which contained innocence and iniquity, purity and'&#xD;
crime, he had embarked for the Eldorado of his hopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Letters had been. received since his departure, wherein&#xD;
the common phrase was inserted, he was "doing well;"&#xD;
miners had returned, who brought the report that he was&#xD;
iron~hearted and accumulative; pieces of the metal in its&#xD;
pristine state had been ~nt, too, as precious relics to that&#xD;
mother and sister; and now eighteen months had elapsed&#xD;
since the parting. day, that sad and tearful day when&#xD;
silence reigned so profoundIy~through the household.&#xD;
Now all the despairing fears had yielded to brighter&#xD;
hopes. The. last intelligence announced that he should&#xD;
soon embark for home; that his bags of gold were filled,&#xD;
and that a happy meeting awaited them when he should&#xD;
recount strange tales of suffering, while he should be&#xD;
luxuriating upon the already gotten treasure.&#xD;
At this still hour the mother and sister had stepped&#xD;
out to think on the son and brother.&#xD;
Mary! she was a delicate, fragile creature, hardly&#xD;
ripened into womanhood; her hair of a chestnut br0Wn&#xD;
waving in massive ringlets in the ~breeze, while her lily&#xD;
face, her deep blue eyes and broad forehead, combined&#xD;
in an expression of intellectual beauty, upon which ~an&#xD;
artist was now lavishing his skill as a present for an&#xD;
sent friend who had attended that brother.&#xD;
Emma! she was fair, and more mature. Her face&#xD;
presented a picture ~f never-ending freshness ~ her dark&#xD;
eyes often aleamed with moisture; and these words came&#xD;
impetuously from her lips:&#xD;
"We shall be so happy, mother, when .Robert ret~irns,&#xD;
having achieved the summit of his ambition. Our cot-&#xD;
tage will be deserted, I suppose, for a more imposing&#xD;
dwelling.' What a specimen of architecture brother will&#xD;

roses and evergreens will contrast strangely with our&#xD;
humble daisies in broken pots, and our leafless multiflora&#xD;
that is perishing inconsequence of our cold, room. All&#xD;
these events 'will surely come to pass, and (she started&#xD;
up) the fair-haired Mary shall realize a bright fulfilment&#xD;

"It was only last night I saw Robert in my sleep.- I&#xD;
Was' hitting at a piece of embroidery. My brother ~as&#xD;

and exclaimed, £0, sister! life is just like yours many-&#xD;

give full effect to the picture, and so is the reality of&#xD;
life.' I am sure I saw him, and yet I know it is all&#xD;
faney.~" The young girl started, even then, as if she&#xD;
heard a footstep.&#xD;
The' widowed mother, we have said,, was there. Her&#xD;
ailver hair was parted back from a mild and beaming&#xD;
face, and her countenance plainly indicated she had her&#xD;
fear*, and 'her daughters their' hopes.&#xD;
"How strange it is," said she, "that we have had&#xD;
no letters by the last arrivals - not a word from Robert,&#xD;
girls!"&#xD;
"Perhaps the letters are intercepted, or delayed, or a&#xD;
thousand casualties may have befallen them," said the&#xD;
hopeful children'.&#xD;
They~trolledalong, full 'of gayety and cheerful prattle,&#xD;

ing some chill in this autumnal evening had seized her&#xD;
daughter's delicate frame.&#xD;
"But I am quite well, now, mother."&#xD;
Yet the remembrance of that strange hallucination still&#xD;
troubled her. She never revealed with what force. some-&#xD;
thing checked her gayety; and, taught from childhood t~&#xD;
be free from superstitious misgiyings, she chased away&#xD;
the gloomy apprehension, and resumed her wanted cheery.&#xD;
fulness.&#xD;
It was in deep twilight when they returned home.&#xD;
Henry, who was Robert's friend, and accQlnpanied. him,&#xD;
was sit4g in the back parlor. The sisters each laid&#xD;
hold of him, but his eyes- were downcast. He seemed to&#xD;
avoid their gaze; his sea-burnt face seemed to have an&#xD;
unwanted flush.&#xD;
"My son V'inquired the mother. "Our brother 'i"&#xD;
the sisters.&#xD;
"Have you received no lettersV' said Henry, in a&#xD;
quivering voice. He endeavored to speak, but there was&#xD;
a choking sensation in his throat,&#xD;
Emma stood there; Mary leaned against her; the&#xD;
mother's face was white as a shroud. Robei~ was dead!&#xD;
The gold he had gathered had all been abstracted by&#xD;
ruthless savages; he had fallen a victim to disease on~&#xD;
board the ship, as he was returning, and his body was&#xD;
consigned to the great deep.&#xD;
Transformed in every nerve stood that late hopeful&#xD;
family. The sisters seemed on the very verge of mad-&#xD;
ness; but the mother sank on her knees and uttered an&#xD;
inaudible prayer.&#xD;

Tl~e world looked cheerless; existencee seemed an empty&#xD;

of the two who usually met every evening to bemoan the&#xD;
fate of the lost Robert.&#xD;
it w~s no~ .a year since the tidings were communicated&#xD;
to them. Again, toward. the close .of a bleak autumnal&#xD;

ap~roaohed yet nearer. Merciful -heaven! What do I&#xD;

"~ literss, I have come at last."&#xD;
-Au electric impulse throbbed through their hearts.&#xD;
Sobs, i-ta, :incohereut ejaeul~tiens, followed. In the&#xD;

&#xD;
she looked, and, raising her hands. to heaven, she articu-&#xD;
lated, in a husky voice,&#xD;
"Robert, my son! is it you I embrace?"&#xD;
His lip quivered, but his manly form still gave evi-&#xD;
dence he was of human kind. And what was his&#xD;
explanation?&#xD;
Henry and Robert had separated after crossing the&#xD;
Isthmus, and returned by different routes. While at&#xD;
Panama, Robert consigned all his gold to the care of' an&#xD;
American captain. His ship was boarded by ~i race of&#xD;
outlaws, who pillaged it from stem to etern, and made off&#xD;
with the booty. Robert received the intelligence just as&#xD;
he was ready to sail for home, and, being chagrined,&#xD;
resolved to return to the mining region; and, being well&#xD;
acquainted with localities, established himself in a remote&#xD;
part, inaccessible to transmitting intelligence by mail~&#xD;
ll9re he assiduously labored, and realized a handsome&#xD;
return. Again lie set his face rd, and this ~tim~&#xD;
he was prospered to his journey's ~nd.&#xD;
From the crew of the pillaged ship Henry had acquired&#xD;
information of the death of a young man on board named&#xD;
Robert, and of course supposing it was his' friend, as he&#xD;
believed he sailed in the same ~jiip with l~s gold, nQ&#xD;
doubt remained hut he was the dead maid&#xD;
If there had been a~shadow over this dwelling, think&#xD;
you there was no sunshine restored? It was a sight up~n&#xD;
which angels might gaze, to see the grateful emotions&#xD;

&#xD;
INQUISITIVE CHILDREN.&#xD;
"I WAS always brought up to attend church, Fanny,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Green, to her newly-hired domestic, "and I&#xD;
wish you to do the same. I shall require of you, how-&#xD;
ever, to attend one of the evangelical order; for, while I&#xD;
Kpay you for bodily selvice, remember I have an interest&#xD;
for your soul."&#xD;
Fanny thought she had, indeed, found a mother, and&#xD;
was truly thankful for her new place.&#xD;
The next day was Sunday. "Ned" was called early&#xD;
to be washed and dressed for the Sunday school; Dan&#xD;
was to repeat his lesson before leaving home; and the&#xD;
eldest daughter, who was teacher, was to conduct both&#xD;
children to church. But things did not work well. The&#xD;
shoe~sti~ings broke/ the boys' collars were starched so&#xD;
badly that ~they purposely rumpled them together the&#xD;
lessons were very 'poorly committeA, and the breakfast&#xD;
was not ready till after 'the bell rang for the opening of&#xD;
the school. Mrs. Green was still in bed, for she was so&#xD;
wearied with weekly services there must be some extra&#xD;
time to rest. Ned fretted at Dan, and Dan threw his&#xD;
pencil at 1'T~d. It wa~ a scene of great confusion for a&#xD;
family who professedly maintained such order. Mr. and&#xD;
Kr~. Gr0e~1, by dint 6f hurry and bluster, equipped&#xD;
&#xD;
themselves for church. Fanny was despatohed, leaving&#xD;
her dishes unwashed, and her kitchen in confusion, be-.&#xD;
cause the essential duty of "attending meeting" demanded&#xD;
the sacrifice. Nothing was said, and, perhaps, not much&#xD;
thought, about carrying a right spirit into the sanctuary,&#xD;
if the body were only placed in the pew!&#xD;
A cold dinner was served. Of course, Mrs. Green&#xD;
allowed no cooking on the Sabbath, and the children&#xD;
were allowed no natural freedom; their business was to&#xD;
keep still, and sit cross-legged, with their~ "primers" or&#xD;
"question-books" before their eyes; and, naturally, this&#xD;
was a dreaded. day to them. Mr. and Mrs. Green read&#xD;
their prayer-book, and the chapter from. which the text&#xD;
was taken; in~~red of the children respecting the scholars&#xD;
present at the Sabbath school, and then took up the&#xD;
religious newspaper, and thus gradually prepared the&#xD;
way for worldly conversation. They had done all that&#xD;
duty demanded; had been to church all day, kept the&#xD;
time strictly, and now began to unbend their thoughts&#xD;
from things above to things beneath.&#xD;
"Husband," said Mrs. Green," that was a splendid&#xD;
shawl Mrs. Sawyer wore to.day. I wonder if S&amp;amp;wyer&#xD;
is rich'? They are a family that seem to have, everything.&#xD;
Susan wore an elegant bonnet. I saw just such a one,&#xD;
for which they charged me twelve dollars. And did. yuu&#xD;
see Mrs. Draper's scarf'? It was the most elegant one I&#xD;
ever saw. I don't see, for my part, how people contrive&#xD;
to get such things. I 'm sure we could not aflird to&#xD;
dress so."&#xD;
Dan here spoke up: "Mother, Tom Spencer has got&#xD;
a beautiful plaid vest; won't you get me puch. a one?"&#xD;

C% ~ ~want ~ xiew sack," said Ned. "All the boys dress&#xD;
better than I do."'&#xD;
"Hush, hush, children!" said the mother; "do you&#xD;
know' what day it is? Sabbath days wore not' made to&#xD;
talk about dress. Don't you know what the command-&#xD;
merit says; six days shalt thou labor, but the seventh, &amp;amp;c.?&#xD;
What did grandpa tell you, boys, last summer, about&#xD;
keeping Sunday?"&#xD;
"If he did talk so good," said Ned, " he got his hay&#xD;
in Sunday, for rear of a shower. How came he to do&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
"Boys I boys! what are you talking about?' Your&#xD;
grandpa is a deacQn, and a very, very pious man. Never&#xD;
let ~ne hear you question his doings."&#xD;
"But, mother," said Ned, "you talk about dress on&#xD;
Sunday with father; what is the harm for Dan and me&#xD;
to doso'P'&#xD;
"Children, you are young. Your father and I are&#xD;
privileged to say what we please, provided we talk no&#xD;
evil. We merely comment upon the vanity of the world,&#xD;
and the little regard people pay to religious duties.&#xD;
Mind your books, tind not listen to all we say." The&#xD;
boys winked at each other as if they had good understand-&#xD;
ings, and could see through a mill-stone.&#xD;
'That evening the conversation turned upon the subject&#xD;
of lying. Ned wished his mother to define to him the&#xD;
exact meaning of falsehood.&#xD;
"Why," said the mother, "it means when we wilfully&#xD;
and intentionally deceive another. If, for instance, I tell&#xD;
you the medicine you take is very pleasant, when it is&#xD;
very o~rensiv~ and 'nauseous it would be a lie; if 'a&#xD;
&#xD;
neighbor sends to me to lend an article, and I say I bav~&#xD;
not got it, ~when I have it, that, too, is a lie "-.&#xD;
"How came you, then," said Ned, "to tell Mrs.&#xD;
Moody you had no eggs, wheii there was a firkin full in&#xD;
the cellar?"&#xD;
"Hush, Ned! don't interrupt me while I am explain-&#xD;
ing to your brother. Have n't I told you, again and&#xD;
again, how impolite such a habit is 'P'&#xD;
"But, mother, I want an explanation, too."&#xD;
"Order, order, Edmund!" said the father, very em-&#xD;
phatically.&#xD;
"Lying, Daniel, is the mark of a weak mind and a&#xD;
bad heart. I hope you never do it, my son; and, more&#xD;
than this, never teach your associates to do it, to screen&#xD;
you from justice."&#xD;
But Dan began to reason. "Mother, when you&#xD;
direct the girl who tends the door, to say you are 'not&#xD;
at home,' when you are in the nursery, is not that a&#xD;
falsehood ~&#xD;
"My child, there are certain conventional rules in&#xD;
society, which are allowable, because custom sanctions&#xD;
th~m. You are not old enough to reason upon such'&#xD;
things now."&#xD;
"And," said Ned, "when you say, '0, dear! I wish&#xD;
such and such people were a hundred miles off,' and go&#xD;
straight into the parlor, and tell them 'how glad you are&#xD;
to see them, and how long you have been wishing they&#xD;
would call,' is not that a falsehood?"&#xD;
"You are the most disposed to question, Ned, that I&#xD;
ever knew a boy. I tell you, boys, once for all, there&#xD;
are certain eustoins in society which we can adopt, with-&#xD;

Everybody who has had e~perien~e knows what these&#xD;
things mean; lint unsophisticate&amp;amp; chulden do not under~.&#xD;

as I tell you, children; always speak the truth, and~ keep&#xD;
the Sabbath day holy, and you will be bles~ed."&#xD;
This oQnclusiQn 8ileflved the boys, but they looked very&#xD;
dissatisfied with the reasoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
WHAT WILL PEOPLE SAY?&#xD;
"Now, Mr. Gill, I want to go to Washington as much&#xD;
as anybody. ~Nobody would like to be introduced to the&#xD;
president and all the men in the cabinet more than my-&#xD;
self. But, dear me, what will people say ~ Everybody&#xD;
will think you are elY in search of an police, and how&#xD;
many comments will be made upon m~,i accompanying&#xD;
you ~ I do wish I lived somewhere that people did n't&#xD;
talk about their neighbors."&#xD;
"That would be a region, Mrs. Gill, that never came&#xD;
under my observation."&#xD;
"Why, husband, they don't do so in country places;&#xD;
they live at a distance from each other, and nobody med-&#xD;
dIes with other people's affairs."&#xD;
"How little you know of the country, wife! You can&#xD;
do nothing there but it is made the subject of conversa-&#xD;
tion. So trifling are the matters,~too, about which people&#xD;
vex themselves, that a worthy clergyman told me that in&#xD;
his parish the frequency with which he c~&amp;amp;xged his&#xD;
linen made quite a~ topic in the sewing-circle ~ and then&#xD;
you can never weaa' a new dress, or buy a hood, or a&#xD;
cow, but everybody is interested to know all the particu.&#xD;
lars."&#xD;
"You astonish me; then I'll never go into the country&#xD;

position to be inquisitive in mat ~ 'oh so litt ~on~&#xD;

Mr. Gill made his newspaper rattle, but said nothing.&#xD;
"Billy," said Mrs~, I to her eldest boy, wh~ sat&#xD;
studying at her work4a e, "what that freddy&#xD;
Crawford t9ld. you about his mother cha i~her help 3"&#xD;
"Why," replied the~ boy, "he sai ~ ~t his mother&#xD;

her domestic as 6ften as she pleased, tIJI ~he got a good&#xD;
ones and I believe, but I won't be positive, he sai4 they&#xD;
had turned off ten cooks in three months."&#xD;
"Tl~ere, Mr. Gill, don't you think I 'm patient with&#xD;
our old crone, who don't know when it is time to put on&#xD;
the potatoes to boil, only as I tell her? I wonder what&#xD;
people would say if I acted as other women do 3 Here&#xD;
I 'ye wintered and summered our old Nancy, and done&#xD;
half the work myself rather than change, because people&#xD;
will talk 80."&#xD;
'~ Willy, dear, did you say Mr. Andxews is about&#xD;
moving into an elegant hoi~s~?"&#xD;
"yes, mother, I went into it to-day; they are just&#xD;
~zr~iahing ~t. There are great mirrors, reaching from&#xD;
the ceiling to the floor, and the room is all being hung in&#xD;
pictures, a~ d one side of the library i~ all glass doors for&#xD;
books to be xted, andit is very beautiful, mokh.r, all&#xD;
over. Don't you wish we lived in such a house, mother?"&#xD;
"As1~ your father, child, if he wishes so." ~he boy&#xD;
obeyed.&#xD;
"Yes, my son, I should enjoy the luxury of a well-&#xD;
~Jeeted library; ari4 tQ regale myself with looking at&#xD;
&#xD;
choice pictures would be a great feast; but, if I could not&#xD;
do it consistently With4tly means, people would talk, as&#xD;
your mother says."&#xD;
~" And who would care for what they said?" inter..&#xD;
erupted Mrs. Gill. "If I could only live in such a house,&#xD;
little should I heed what people would say of me."&#xD;
"What.! not you, surely, who make it such a daily&#xD;
study to do things to avoid observation. I really should&#xD;
have hesitated, ~ven if my circumstances admitted, to&#xD;
have procured an elegant house, lest it should bring dish.&#xD;
comfort on y~ou, wife."&#xD;
"Never mind that, Mr. Gill. I tell you, when I feel&#xD;
I am doing right, I don't care what people sayof me;&#xD;
but wheu I have misgivings, I am forever upbraided that&#xD;
everybody will talk about me. My conscience, Mr. Gill,&#xD;
is precisely like every other woman's. If their husbands&#xD;
or fathers can afford them all the luxuries they desire,&#xD;
not a straw do they care what is said about them; but&#xD;
let them feel they are not warranted in their indulgences,&#xD;
and, at no distant day, see want and failure staring them&#xD;
in the face, and then self-reproach added to these make&#xD;
unhappiness enough."&#xD;
"But, wife, are you not a little prone to talk of others&#xD;
yourself?"&#xD;
"That 's always the way; criminating me, Mr. Gill.&#xD;
No, F never meddle nor interfere with anybody's busb&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
"William, go to bed," said the father.&#xD;

MRS. BUTTERS' BABY.&#xD;
Mus. BUTTERS' baby! There never was such a first-&#xD;
born child. It had little diamond eyes, a complexion of&#xD;
snowy whiteness, and its hair, thy, it was so flaxy, soft&#xD;
and ourly~ that everybody begged a curl to remember it&#xD;
by. And then it was the pet of the house; all the treat&#xD;
its grandmother wanted was to spend a day with her&#xD;
daughter, and~rock .the cradle where the baby lay, and&#xD;
talk about its "knowing ".propensities; for it did seem&#xD;
as 'if the child actually crowed before it was a week. old.&#xD;
But, dear me, the baby was a boy! This was a sad dis&#xD;
t~ppointnient, for its. aunts Jerusha, and Patty, and Phila,&#xD;
i~ll ha&amp;amp; prepared something as a namesake present, should&#xD;
it be of the gez~tler sex, and :called after themselves.&#xD;
But it was so lovable, although a boy, that it w~ie the&#xD;
complete idol of the house. Mrs. Thitters was a fashion-&#xD;
able woman, and, after the birth of the child, found her-&#xD;
saif largely indebted to'wany of her acquaintances in the&#xD;
business of waking calls. Judy, the. maid of all ~work,&#xD;
was~ delighted with the baby, 'and if of a Monday mowing&#xD;
Mrs. Butters summoned her from the Wash-tub to tend&#xD;
the little fellow while she went out to discharge some of&#xD;
her debts, Judy always smilingly ob.~erved, "the clothes&#xD;
will Only wash the easier for soaking." Sometimes, it is&#xD;

&#xD;
"christening."&#xD;
It was the first grandchild on both the paternal and&#xD;
maternal side; and both grandparents were desirous of&#xD;
its bearing their cognomen. But, alas! it made no&#xD;
euphonious sound when the two names were coupled to-&#xD;
gether. Timothy Home was the grandparent by the&#xD;
mother's side, and Jeremiah Butters by the father's.&#xD;
When it was proposed they should be united, it wee with&#xD;
a shudder its dear aunts exclaimed, "Timothy Jeremiab.&#xD;
Tim Jerry would surely be the nickname of that sweet&#xD;
baby." There was a family feeling of no very~ enviable&#xD;
stamp likely to be produced by this little a~Q~ir~. of a name&#xD;
for the baby. Its mother could not bear the idea of bor&#xD;
darling being forever nicknamed "Jerry Butters."&#xD;
&#xD;
0&#xD;
&#xD;
true, her mistress ~would not return in season for her to&#xD;
do any justice in getting a dinner; but then Mrs. Butters&#xD;
never fretted if the bez&amp;amp;y was well attended.&#xD;
Week after week,- nay,. more, month after month,~~-&#xD;
this little idol seemed to steal a~vay the affections of this&#xD;
household. It jumped and screamed, looked delightedly&#xD;
ogt of the window, and its fond mother confidently af-~&#xD;
firmed it knew its father before it was three months old.&#xD;
"There never W~28 such a baby!" But remember, that&#xD;
babies indulged, like men and women of older growth,&#xD;
have changeful freaks, and evince strange propensities&#xD;
and strong dislikes. The day of its " christening" it&#xD;
was terribly out of sorts; it shrieked so loudly and grew&#xD;
so restive in the nurse~ arms, that Mrs. Butters always&#xD;
declared a pin must Mve pricked it somewhere.; so it&#xD;
only gained sympathy for this ebullition of temper. But&#xD;
I am a little in anticipation in thus arriving at the&#xD;

&#xD;
Timothy was I'ar preferable.. Its father thought just the&#xD;
contrary; and we.te it not that a stop was put to the dis~.&#xD;
puted question, a serious quarrel might have ensued.&#xD;
Qid Uncle Jerry Butiers deposited a thousand dollars&#xD;
in a city bank, the~prinei~al a~nd interest of which were&#xD;
to remain till the baby should arrive at the age of four-&#xD;
teen, and then the proceeds were to be expended in its&#xD;
education, provided it were named after himself. Grand~&#xD;
pa Tim had not money so plenty, and of course he of the&#xD;
larger means, in small as in great matters, carries the&#xD;
question. The only disagreeable thing in the affair was&#xD;
that not one of the iornes was present at the baptizing.&#xD;
Little "Jerry Butters" soon began to know his name,&#xD;
and quitosoon began likewise to show his disposition. He&#xD;
was too old to be always excused by his mother with the&#xD;
plea that a pin sticking into his "dear little self" made&#xD;
him cry. His grandmother Home gave the true version&#xD;
of the affiLir when she said it was a spice of old .A.dam-.-- the&#xD;
child was depraved; for she was a sound orthodox pro-&#xD;
Lessor, that never forgot&#xD;
"In Adam's fall&#xD;
We sinned all."&#xD;
But it was the first baby, and it must be indulged.&#xD;
It was a proud. day for its parents when it puckered up&#xD;
its little mouth and ai~euiated "I won't." It always&#xD;
had a lump of sugar for every repetition of those two&#xD;
syllables. But by and by it did not sound~yo pretty.&#xD;
Wben it tipped over its full cup of milk on purpose, and&#xD;
threw its silver tumbler against the large looking-glass in&#xD;
the front parlor and shivered it to pieces, its father began&#xD;
&#xD;
996&#xD;
&#xD;
to feel there was some temper that ought to be corrected.&#xD;
Poor Judy, too, had long ~since declared she could do&#xD;
nothing with the child in its mother's absence; so a new&#xD;
girl on purpose to take care of it was provided. Mrs.&#xD;
Butters' health made it very necessary she should be&#xD;
much in the open air,- at least she often quoted, "her&#xD;
physician told her so."&#xD;
But fresh troubles began to thicken, and this dear lit-&#xD;
tle baby, this pet and idol, was at the foundation of&#xD;
them. That he was the most self-willed little urchin,&#xD;
and a perfect torment, was the frequent affirmation of&#xD;
the attendant; and, after sundry kicks 'and scratches, she&#xD;
declared unless she were permitted to correct ~the darling&#xD;
she must leave her situation. This Mrs. Butters would,&#xD;
not permit, affirming that all correction should be given by&#xD;
parents. It turned out that she was soon left in sole charge&#xD;
of her baby, to do as she pleased with him. It was a&#xD;
new and troublesome office. It was proposed at length,&#xD;
to relieve her by giving her young gentleman a week's&#xD;
visit at Grandpa Butters'. The trial was made, but two&#xD;
days before its expiration, the "little treasure" was re-&#xD;
turned as too unmanageable for its aunts and cousins!&#xD;
Its mother was in a sad dilemma. To keep peace&#xD;
every plan must be devised to amuse Masifer Butters.&#xD;
Neither cook, chambermaid ~nor nursery-woman, would&#xD;
stay, for the little rebel would contrive to make each one&#xD;
unhappy.&#xD;
Mrs. Butters was completely worn out. In a fit of&#xD;
despair she protested to her husband she must adopt&#xD;
some new mode of living, and the only expedient seemed&#xD;
to be to break up housekeeping. Certainly this was&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
l~kelyto be an easy matter, for everything was in a fair&#xD;
way soon to be broken by this incorrigible, uncorrected&#xD;
child. Mr. Butters sighed at the proposal. He felt&#xD;
this would be no antidote~ But a woman must generally&#xD;
have her way, and Mrs. B. was not long in determining&#xD;
to select a place for a new home. She called at many&#xD;
of the first-class houses to ascertain the terms; but, alas!&#xD;
they did not take children. This strengthened her be-&#xD;
lief that all children were alike troublesome, and Jerry&#xD;
was no Worse than others. The result of two days' per-&#xD;
ambulations ended in this,- at the west end of the city,&#xD;
in a genteel boarding-house, a family consisting of a man,&#xD;
his wife and child, had just vacated the premises, she&#xD;
sought, and if the boy were not "over troublesome," the&#xD;
landlady thought th~ey might be received. Mrs. Butters&#xD;
assured her he was not, and it was arranged, if it met her&#xD;
* husband's approbation, that the place was secured. Be-.&#xD;
sides, Mrs. Butters knew of a friend who would hire&#xD;
their house, furniture and all, and she would be saved a&#xD;
world of trouble by stepping into ready-furnished apart-&#xD;
inents, which she might do if she seized those already&#xD;
offered.&#xD;
We will now introduce our friends to their new board-&#xD;
ing-house. Master Jerry was a most refractory fellow,&#xD;
and did not at all appear to like his new home. The&#xD;
first dayihis fond parents dressed him in the most splen-&#xD;
did manner, and brought him to the table, which circum-&#xD;
stance so inflamed the landlady that they were glad soon&#xD;
to conduct him back to their own apartments "No&#xD;
children are allowed at my table, Mrs. Butters;" was&#xD;
&#xD;
SUBSTANCE AND s~iws.          231&#xD;
&#xD;
once said, so that its significant meaning was never for.&#xD;
gotten.&#xD;
At evening, Master Jerry 'took a freak in his head&#xD;
th~t he was not at home, and should not go to bed. His&#xD;
cries were loud and continued, and no entreaty, play..&#xD;
thing, or earthly device, made the least impression to sub-&#xD;
due his feelings. The strange sound in this hitherto&#xD;
quiet house made sad notes of discord, and nearly every&#xD;
boarder called to ascertain what could be the mat-&#xD;
ter. Old Mrs~ Bellamy declared it disturbed her so&#xD;
that she got no quiet sleep all night; and she intimated&#xD;
to the landlady that she should be forced to seek a place&#xD;
where there was less uproar, unless it ceased.&#xD;
"1 protest," said little Miss Chapman, "I could not&#xD;
hear myself play upon my piano last evening, and it was&#xD;
so annoying to the gentlemen who called on me"- and,&#xD;
taking her quizzing-glass and examining every one at the&#xD;
table, she felt at liberty to observe, "1 do hope, my dear&#xD;
madam, you will free us from such an annoyance."&#xD;
Poor Mr. Butters was overlooked by her shrouded eyes,&#xD;
and his chagrin at this speech really prevented him from&#xD;
finishing his breakfast. He rose from the table, and,&#xD;
after he left, a general smile ensued at Miss Chapman's&#xD;
mistake.&#xD;
There was still another difficulty. The help in this&#xD;
house were all colored, and Master Jerry was continually&#xD;
shrieking with fright as any specimen of ebony ap-&#xD;
proached him. His motherdeclared he would have lits,&#xD;
and so it was decided he must be kept alone in his own&#xD;
room. Confinement was not his element, and his grand-&#xD;
parents declared it must not be some other plan muat&#xD;

&#xD;
be devised. Just as the landlady was about issuing her&#xD;
orders, Mrs. Butters informed her of their determination&#xD;
to leave. Grandpa had consented to make one more&#xD;
trial with his namesake. A married daughter should&#xD;
never stay too long with an ungoverned child under a&#xD;
father's roof, however urged to do so. Those maiden&#xD;
sisters, or that stray cousin, or that old domestic, will&#xD;
kindle a breeze when the weather seems most calm.&#xD;
Scarcely had Mrs. Butters got settled at her father's,&#xD;
before Master Jerry began to train. ~ Let the little&#xD;
dear have this," or "He is not well to-day, and more re-&#xD;
fractory than usual," had ceased to appease the disturbed&#xD;
household; they began to see. that some sort of discipline&#xD;
must be commenced. Here was a little fellow, just able&#xD;
to trot about, once the darling and idol of his friends,&#xD;
now their source of constant disquiet and unhappiness!&#xD;
In that little breast an ungoverned temper had made dis-&#xD;
cord to a large family of peaceful inmates. Truly to&#xD;
such did a wise man say, "Spare the rod and spoil the&#xD;
child." After a Thithful trial of patient endurance, Mrs.&#xD;
Butters found that a home of her own was the proper de-&#xD;
posit for her child; that wholesome correction was abso-&#xD;
lutely necessary when the first display of temper appears,&#xD;
and that neither boarding-house nor grand-parents will&#xD;
continue long to bear a chastisement from which there is&#xD;
an escape.&#xD;
Master Butters is still unmanageable. His parents&#xD;
think his irritability arises from delicate nerves, and his&#xD;
fond mother has actually applied to the homoeopathio&#xD;
physician for some quieting powders. "Uncle Jerry"&#xD;

SUBSTANCE AND SHADOWS.         286&#xD;
&#xD;
A DARK PHASE IN LIFE.&#xD;
IT is a wretched condlijon to be poor! Besides the&#xD;
wants and deprivations of daily life, there is the reserved&#xD;
bow or mere nod, the apology for being "near-sighted"&#xD;
when you are in company with a rich man, the con~&#xD;
tempt of countenance which says, " You have not done&#xD;
as well as you might," and the "I 'm glad to get rid of&#xD;
you," which a sensitive person always feels most keenly,&#xD;
because poor.&#xD;
I wonder so many steeped in vice and poverty have&#xD;
any moral courage left to seek a better fortune, rather&#xD;
than that so few do so.. Few people take into account&#xD;
the hard rubs it costs them to rise. Suppose it is a man&#xD;
who has resolved to be somebody. He applies for assist~&#xD;
ance, and tells the humiliating story of his degradation;&#xD;
and that is no small cross when one is repentant to begin&#xD;
with. His friend shakes his head, and says, "I don't&#xD;
know of. anything I can do just now; I commend your&#xD;
good efforts, hope you will be successful, and when I hear&#xD;
of' a chance will let you know."&#xD;
Back he goes to his. counting~room, and never thinks&#xD;
of the fellow, till a hardy truckman stands before him,&#xD;
waiting for his change, who, years after, tells him' he is&#xD;
the same person who applied to him years ago for help&#xD;
&#xD;
to become a man! Then there is a class who never&#xD;
believe you are really in earnest to reform; and others&#xD;
who wonder how you ever became so poor; and yet others&#xD;
tell how many thoughtless vagabonds they have helped&#xD;
into employment. When a man has a feeling, to rise,&#xD;
they depress him, instead of lifting him; and many a&#xD;
time this has sunk him in despair.&#xD;
There is the poor woman asking for work; she says&#xD;
she is a stranger, and has a sick child or husband, but&#xD;
can do any kind of sewing.&#xD;
She is sent to the slop-shop, and there she is examined,&#xD;
before she takes a sack worth fifty cents, as if she were&#xD;
about carrying Californian dollars away. She receives&#xD;
at the most a shilling a day for her work; her charge&#xD;
grows sicker, her courage less, and she sinks in utter&#xD;
hopelessness.&#xD;
Thousands die for want of one cheering word, - one&#xD;
helping hand. We have all our charity so systematized&#xD;
that its very essence seems drawn out. We are so afraid&#xD;
of "imposition" that we would impose a fine upon a&#xD;
spontaneous freak of nature that would unburden some&#xD;
loose change from our pockets! We are so discriminate&#xD;
that we have apologies for all our miserly affections.&#xD;
This makes it a very hard world for a poor person to live&#xD;
in! If he is virtuous, he must bring such credentials as&#xD;
are "satisfactory." His honest countenance goes for&#xD;
nothing, because we have been so often "duped," and&#xD;
often one would rather starve than beg, because of the&#xD;
very manliness it takes out of him.&#xD;
Then a poor man stands a poor chance in countless&#xD;
ways. He may have the talents of a Cicero~ and the&#xD;

&#xD;
perseverance of a Demosthenes; but he is objected to by&#xD;
the rich man as a son-in-law because he is poor! With&#xD;
great caution he obtains any business; for people are&#xD;
afraid to put their effects where a man ha~ nothing but&#xD;
his talents! His tailor is afraid to trust him; his boot~&#xD;
maker points to his printed paper, "Terms Cash," just as&#xD;
he selects a fit; his landlord sends in a bill once a fort~&#xD;
night, ~~a-..the man waits to take the amount back. Indeed,&#xD;
it is very difficult for a poor man to live any how, and&#xD;
it always has been so. Rich men by their very credit&#xD;
accumulate, letting their money lie at interest where the&#xD;
poor fdlow has to pay his last cent. And all this is&#xD;
done for years before "better days" begin to dawn, and&#xD;
people look on, and wonder such and such people have&#xD;
no more energy. The truth is, they have expended&#xD;
energy enough to make up a dozen characters of great-.&#xD;
ness, just to live.&#xD;
We are not half willing to give people a start. We&#xD;
ought to encourage struggling genius and self-sacrificing&#xD;
laborers. To make, a man honest, show him that you&#xD;
believe him so; if "Sylvia" will marry him, bolster&#xD;
him up; give him a few hundr&amp;amp;ts, if you have your&#xD;
thousands; cultivate the manly part, and you will rarely&#xD;
find a l~nave!&#xD;
It is singular how little props sustain one. A trust&#xD;
committed, business bestowed, a customer sent, a. ~atron~&#xD;
izing "club," or a little cash remitted, will niake &amp;amp; cheer-s&#xD;
ful face for days after.&#xD;
Much poverty might be unfelt if the tender mercies&#xD;
of the world were less eruel~&#xD;
&#xD;
A FACETIOUS SKETCH.&#xD;
IN the progress of the age it is an incontrovertible.&#xD;
fact that working for a living is decidedly "vulgar."&#xD;
The disadvantages attending employment are sufficiently&#xD;
~obvious without any argument. J~ist think of a man&#xD;
always busy! No time for pains and aches, no inclina-&#xD;
tion to be nervous, no disposition to look after "invigor-&#xD;
ating medicine," but brain, hands and heart all occupied!&#xD;
Why, such an individual is a perfect enemy to a doctor;&#xD;
he is ~rarely sick, and so neither homoeopathist nor al-s&#xD;
lopathist can claim him as a patient. And, then, what a&#xD;
foe to nurses is such an one! Never needing some old&#xD;
lady to watch by his bedside and drop out medicine,&#xD;
never wanting a less substantial dish than a sirloin of&#xD;
beef or a haunch of venison, and never oppressed or&#xD;
depressed after a hearty meal!&#xD;
And then the worker has no time to attend to other&#xD;
people's affairs. He never inquires into the scandal so&#xD;
fresh and racy, - never cares whether his~ neighbor's&#xD;
daughters' beaux are aristocrats or plebeians, never&#xD;
knows what he carries home in his market-basket, nor&#xD;
whether he is living beyond his means!&#xD;
He has no time to loiter about a courthouse, and is&#xD;
never taken under an arrest, - never peered~ through&#xD;

<pb  n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8250-00000119"/>&#xD;

any grating to look at a "fugitive slave," never&#xD;
attended a call to consider the constitutionally of certain&#xD;
proceedings, and never hazards a farthing On a bet who&#xD;
will finally sit in the congressional hail!&#xD;
There can be no mistake but the working-man foregoes&#xD;
uncommon pleasures. Never to be able to stand against&#xD;
a post, nor to sit upon a seat on the Common. Never to&#xD;
be seen with a gold-headed walking-stick, and backing up&#xD;
a lady. Never to be caught napping after dinner, nor yet&#xD;
lounging in the rocking-chair, nor behind the folds of a&#xD;
damask curtain, with the last new novel. Why, is it&#xD;
not plain enough he sacrifices a great deal? And all for&#xD;
what? Why, to be an independent fellow, - to feel&#xD;
that he has plenty of money in the locker, and is in a&#xD;
fair way to gain a great deal more. And do you not see&#xD;
how the beautiful law of dependence is thus frustrated?&#xD;
Never obliged to ask the favor of a friend to lend him&#xD;
a sniall sum to meet contingencies, never unable to&#xD;
meet an account for want of funds, and, consequently,&#xD;
under no necessity of uttering a lie, asserting he was&#xD;
disappointed in not receiving a remittance from abroad.&#xD;
And, as he is not forced to sin, of course the necessity&#xD;
of penitence is done away!&#xD;
And, then, the man who "works" has such coarse,&#xD;
clumsy hands, if it be a handicraft he follows;, or, his&#xD;
fingers are~ so contracted by writing as to be perfectly&#xD;
shapeless in the white kid glove; besides, he cannot&#xD;
aspire to be beau, general or particular, to those young&#xD;
ladies whose dresses drag in the streets, nor yet to those&#xD;
wh~ ogle young gentlemen behind the counters in dry&#xD;
goods. estaJ4ishmeut&amp;amp; Not he! Think you one who&#xD;

"works for a living" is fit to attend a fashionable lady&#xD;
to an operaw? Why, the very name of labor is odi-&#xD;
ous. "If my father did work at shoe-making," says&#xD;
Miss Angelica, "it was long before I was born; and I do&#xD;
wish he would get ovef the silly habit of speaking about&#xD;
what he did when a boy, while Mr. iluckins is present.&#xD;
Ma was always a lady, so I have nothing to fear on her&#xD;
account."&#xD;
And then comes the strange anomaly, a working-&#xD;
woman! One who is not ashamed to tell a daily street-&#xD;
walker that she has some domestic affairs which call for&#xD;
attention; who does not know, certainly as early as the&#xD;
month of March, what will be the prevailing spring&#xD;
fashions; who cannot tell whether she shall wear a visit&#xD;
or a mantilla this year! Why, such a woman is de-~&#xD;
servedly scouted out of all "genteel society." And,&#xD;
then, what exquisite thinks much of her daughters;&#xD;
good, plain, common-sens~ed girls, who know how to&#xD;
sweep, and mend hosiery, and make puddings, and direct&#xD;
Dinah when their mother is gone, but who never per.&#xD;
formed an "Jitalian air, with all its trills," in their&#xD;
whole lives? They never could lisp out sent mental&#xD;
talk, never were "nervously ill" from living in a&#xD;
heated house, and never had the "blues" for want of&#xD;
exercise! Who could value such acquaintances?&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8250-00000120"/>&#xD;
HAPPINESS EQUALIZED.&#xD;
IT is mighty' discouraging - this drudging toil we are&#xD;
compelled to do to save us from starvation. Earning&#xD;
one's "bread by the sweat of the brow," is no foolish&#xD;
task; it 's very homespun work, talk as we will about it.&#xD;
There 's a set of poor fellows digging, digging, digging&#xD;
all day, just to earn a dollar. There 's a poor woman&#xD;
stitching and sewing, and pressing, and button-holing,&#xD;
to earn her fifty or seventy-five cents; and at night, in&#xD;
the first case, the man with the clean, sleek, plaited-&#xD;
bosomed shirt w~lks up and says, "Mike, here's your&#xD;
money;" and the mistress, with flounces all the way up&#xD;
her skirt, holds out the pittance and says, "Here, Mrs.&#xD;
Saveall, is your 'money for your day's work;" and then&#xD;
the laborers go 'home to stow away in an ugly, ill-venti-&#xD;
lated, old, crazy apartment, filled with children, and, it&#xD;
may be, a sick or scolding wife, who moans over her sad&#xD;
fate, and says she never expected' to come to this -~-" cold&#xD;
potatoes and dry bread; no nursing, and little to live for."&#xD;
Now, such a picture makes one side of human life; but&#xD;
it is only the 'shady one. We all have discouraging&#xD;
days dark days cloudy ones. By-and-by the sun&#xD;
shines. That man who earns his dollar goes home and&#xD;
tells his wife he has taken a job for higher pay; tosses&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
up the baby, and tells its mother about the quantity of&#xD;
groCeri~5 he is going to buy, and that she can have a new&#xD;
bonnet, and "little Mike" a new pair of shoes, and that&#xD;
they shall all fit out and go upon some visiting expedition&#xD;
awhile hence, to see some distant aunt, or cousin, or&#xD;
"very dear friend." And then, how she sings over her&#xD;
work! How little she minds about the baby's fretting,&#xD;
or Luther's mischievous ways! Her heart is all turned&#xD;
to that outfit, and the pleasant idea' keeps running&#xD;
through her mind that if she is not as well off as some-&#xD;
body else, she, to say the least, is happier. She heard&#xD;
the man with a ruffled shirt say, in the morning when she&#xD;
took his clothes home, that his money did not bring him&#xD;
in any dividends; that he had notes to pay, and did not&#xD;
know how 'to meet them; and then he added, "You&#xD;
people who work for your daily bread are the happiest in&#xD;
the world." And she adds, "I know it is so; for Mr. Fry&#xD;
looked dejected and careworn. His face was sallow, ~ai~d&#xD;
his eyes looked as if he had watched all night; while I&#xD;
feel as gay as a lark, and would not change situations&#xD;
with Mr. Fry, the merchant, to.~day, if Ii could."&#xD;
And there is the seamstress, and her' einplbyer in h~r&#xD;
flounced dress. "Madam," to be sure, sits on an elegant&#xD;
couch, and her eyes rest on tapestry carpets, and beneath&#xD;
folds of damask the light stealthily peeps in, all soft&#xD;
ened; but, ten chances to one, her husband was out all&#xD;
night at some gaiDing4able; or he is a veritable Candle,&#xD;
who gave her a ~urtain lecture about her extrav~gance;&#xD;
or some son has vexed her life out about going to' Cali-&#xD;
fornia; and thea seamstress, who is plying her needle away&#xD;
in the back nursery, has a' thousand times as pl&#xD;

thoughts coursing through her brain. She, perhaps, has&#xD;
a prospect of marriage, and the work is cheerfully per~&#xD;
formed, because she has her eye on some piece of furni-&#xD;
ttire she means to purchase; and then too, she has an&#xD;
idea how happy she shall be when she inhabits "a home&#xD;
of her own," and John goes to his work, and she sits and&#xD;
works for him. Would she change places with her em-&#xD;
ployer, think you '~&#xD;
Thus it is, we are very apt to take things on the&#xD;
surface, and then come to a conclusion. We envy peo-.&#xD;
pIe in coaches when we are tired with walking; we&#xD;
de0i~e more spacious dwellings when we are pinched for&#xD;
closet-room; we covet gold chains, and silk dresses, and&#xD;
outside finery, forgetting that away down in human&#xD;
hearts there are aches, and pains, and vexatious, and petty&#xD;
trials, which corrode the peace and quiet of luxurious&#xD;
peoplevarying in kinil, but not in degree, with the more&#xD;
humble, toiling, plodding, every-day sort of people.&#xD;
The man who rides in. the coach often has a gouty&#xD;
leg; and how he envies the nimble trip of the mechanic!&#xD;
The lady in diamonds and gold chains has a deep-seated&#xD;
cough, and she covets the rosy cheeks and merry heart&#xD;
of her washer-woman; or she has a little piddlingg,"&#xD;
wefrd-~eed child, who has been heated to death in a&#xD;
nursery, and the ruddy countenance of her cook's little&#xD;
boy, who plays out of doors and takes care of himself; is&#xD;
to her a perfect enigma. She would give all the world&#xD;
if her puny boy was as robust. And so she feeds him&#xD;
on sweetmeats, and buys him a nice covered carriage,&#xD;
and hires a servant--girl to drag him to the Common, and&#xD;
bopes by these means he will recover; whereas, if she&#xD;
&#xD;
would let him trot about alone, and pick dandelions, and&#xD;
fall into mud-puddles, and eat brown bread and new milk,&#xD;
no doubt the little fellow would be hale and hearty'.&#xD;
Thus we see the law of compensation is about equally&#xD;
divided. One has more money, and the other more ac-&#xD;
tivity; one has more luxuries, and the other more&#xD;
health; one frets over a thing another \covets; and so,&#xD;
taking it in the aggregate, everything is about equally&#xD;
apportioned. And this should teach us perfect content-&#xD;
mont with our lot, unless we are disposed to he idle; and*&#xD;
a sluggard has no business to -live in God's universe,&#xD;
where everything in nature is destined to progress.&#xD;
Therefore, clear away the wrinkles; stop fretting because&#xD;
your neighbor is better off than yourself; keep up a&#xD;
merry heart, and you will find this world a pretty corn.-&#xD;
fortable place after all.&#xD;

SWEET SIXTEEN;&#xD;
OR, THB FIRST FLIRTATION.&#xD;
"~MAMMA, have you any objection to my receiving the&#xD;
attentions of that young gentleman who danced with me&#xD;
at Jest evenings hop ?" inquired Edith Gray, as she&#xD;
looked ~ut of7 the window at the Ocean House, whither,&#xD;
for the fir~t tir~ie in her life, she had arrived.&#xD;
~' Objections, my dear! I know nothing about the per-&#xD;
son you speak of."&#xD;
"Why, ma, don't you remember Mr. Rodolphus McGil-&#xD;
very, the gentleman with long, flowing black hair, and a&#xD;
bronze face? He wore those heavy whiskers that were just&#xD;
tucked in at the corners of his mouth, and his hair curled&#xD;
gracefully over his upper lip, and disclosed a set of the&#xD;
most beautiful teeth I ever beheld. There ho is r~ow, sit-&#xD;
ting on yonder piazza, smoking, with Eugene Fitzroy."&#xD;
"You seem wonderfully posted, child, in the names&#xD;
of the gentlemen about here. It is but six days since we&#xD;
arrived,, and Edith, dear, you must not make too free&#xD;
with those whose characters you know nothing ab~t.&#xD;
What, then, of this Mr. Rodolphus what d'ye call him 3"&#xD;
"Do ~,all him Mr. McGilvery, mother. He is a splen-&#xD;
did young man; and now I will tell you what I do know&#xD;
&#xD;
about him. The very first day I caine here, just before&#xD;
papa went away, he asked to be introduced to me. He&#xD;
is of Scottish descent, and is making the tour of the&#xD;
United States. Well, in a very familiar manner he said&#xD;
to me, 'Miss ~dith' (for he heard 'pa' call me so), '1&#xD;
shall wish to monopolize your society while I am here.&#xD;
I am fond of young ladies. I had a sister once who&#xD;
strongly resembled you. That weed on my hat betokens&#xD;
her deceased ' And be wiped his eyes and looked so&#xD;
affectionately towards m~, ma, I began to love him at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
"Why, Edith, you should not indulge in such strong&#xD;
expressions. Remember, you are a very young lady,&#xD;
and know but little of the world. You must be cautious,&#xD;
dear, about accepting attentions from strangers. Many a&#xD;
young girl has been duped by their duplicity6"&#xD;
"0,1 know all about that, mother! " replied the san-&#xD;
guine sweet sixteen; "but they who deceive foolish girls&#xD;
are not of the stamp of Mr. MoGilvery. He is alto-&#xD;
gether above such mean conduct. Besides, did n't I just&#xD;
explain to you why he feels attached to me? on ac&#xD;
count of my resemblance to his dear sister."&#xD;
"And it may be that he never had a sister, after all,&#xD;
Edith. How do we know the fact V'&#xD;
"Ma, I iiever saw such a doubting person as you are!&#xD;
What earthly motive could have induced him to have&#xD;
asserted such a tl~ing, unless it were true? Now, please&#xD;
tell me, have ~iou any objection to my accepting his&#xD;
attentions? He told me to ask you, and I am sure this&#xD;
argue&amp;amp; that he is not desirous of inveigling me against&#xD;
your will."&#xD;

"'Still, I should have thought better of the man, had&#xD;
h~ sought my acquaintance, and asked the question him..&#xD;
self You may' tell him so, as your reply, Edith, to his&#xD;
question."&#xD;
"Bnt he was too modest, mother, to venture convers-&#xD;
ing with you. There he is, rising from his seat. I will&#xD;
run and ask him to come to our room."&#xD;
"No, Edith; you must not be too familiar, I tell&#xD;
you." But Edith waved her little hand for his approach,&#xD;
and he came into the hail, and there stood, waiting for&#xD;
her to join him.&#xD;
Artless and thoughtless, she ran to him, and began&#xD;
narrating all her late conversation, and, after pressing&#xD;
Mr. Uodolphus MoGilvery to go and see her mother, he&#xD;
reluctantly consented to do so.'&#xD;
Upon entering the room, he ~was the picture of smiles&#xD;
and the graces personified; so bland in conversation, so&#xD;
delicate in remarks, so apparently diffident, yet resolute,&#xD;
that Mrs. Blithe did not wonder her daughter was fasci-&#xD;
nated~.&#xD;
The interview was a long one, and ended iii a full dis-&#xD;
closure of the object for which he came to this country;&#xD;
indirectly keeping in View, all the while, that trwney was&#xD;
no consideration with him, his father having just died&#xD;
and left him sole heir to a princely fortune; that he only&#xD;
pined for sympathy and companionship; and, as Edith so&#xD;
strongly r~rninded him of his deceased sister, he, per-&#xD;
haps, had ventured too far in endeavoring to gain the&#xD;
friendly regard of one young and innocent heari~ an a&#xD;
strange land.&#xD;
These thoughts being uttered in a most winning a~eent,&#xD;
&#xD;
suited by infiexions and cadences to the major or minor&#xD;
key, as best suited the pathetic or more lively part of&#xD;
his history, all counted with Mrs. Blithe, and she ven~&#xD;
tured so far as to add, that "if, during their sojourn,&#xD;
they could do anything to minister to his comfort, they&#xD;
would most cheerfully perform it." And Edith was 'in&#xD;
ecstasy that she had thus won over her mother to be-&#xD;
come interested in Mr. Rodolphus MoGilvery.&#xD;
What did she care for that staid young man, Mr. Les-&#xD;
ter, from New York; or Mr. Fry, th~ rich bachelor, who&#xD;
had promised Mr. Blithe to attend his wife and daughter&#xD;
in his absence ~ 1i was certainly very ill-timed and&#xD;
impertinent in the latter to inquire what they knew of&#xD;
the character of the gentleman with whom they were so&#xD;
intimately connected, after he had told them so minutely&#xD;
his personal history. Truly, Mrs. Blithe, you are as&#xD;
easily satisfied ~ind as credulous as your daughter.&#xD;
Mr. Fry, however, took it upon himself to ascertain&#xD;
authentically whether the Btatements made by Mr. Rodol-&#xD;
phus were strictly true. He addressed a letter to a mere&#xD;
cantile house in New York, upon whom he professed to&#xD;
draw for money, and found they were ignorant of the&#xD;
existence of such a man. He addressed another to Count&#xD;
Zolvani, whom he said he knew intimately, and was&#xD;
answered that "he never heard of the gentleman in&#xD;
question." So that, when convinced of the falsity of two&#xD;
asseverations, he began to distrust all others, which sorely&#xD;
puzzled and vexed Mrs. Blithe and h~r daughter.&#xD;
While in the heyday of apparent triumph, having&#xD;
secured the affections of an artless girl, having Rirted&#xD;
and danced in the sunbeams of fashionable lifb, suddenly&#xD;

Mr~ Rodolphus Mc(~ilvery disappeared, leaving the land-&#xD;
lord with his unpaid board-bill, and at the liv~ery-stable&#xD;
a large undischarged account "for sundry drives about&#xD;
the suburbs," in which Mrs. Blithe and Edith had par-&#xD;
ticipated; and, worse than all, leaving a young and&#xD;
guileless heart to feel the chagrin which always ~attends&#xD;
an unsuccessful flirtation.&#xD;
But the present mortification wore away when they&#xD;
felt the escape which the continued attentions of the&#xD;
Scotch gentleman would, ere long, have made very&#xD;
doubtful; and our young friend now was convinced that&#xD;
a.~ster1ing character, generally, can furnish testimonials to&#xD;
establish its owii assertions. So the mortifying lesson&#xD;
proved a salutary one.&#xD;
Mrs. Blithe and her daughter now willingly accepted&#xD;

whose inquiries undoubtedly gave the walking-ticket to&#xD;

proceeded. Still, after their return in the autumn, she&#xD;
one day inquired concerning the age of Mr. Fry.&#xD;
"Your father says, Edith, that Mr. Fry cannot be&#xD;
more than thirty4hree."&#xD;
Edith reckoned. "Twice seventeen is thirty-four; that&#xD;
is not so very great a disparity, after all," said she,&#xD;
thoughtfixlly.&#xD;
~' Remember, daughter, the old adage, 'Better be an&#xD;
old man's darliz~g than ,a young fool's pet.'"&#xD;
' , 014 man!" indignantly replied Edith, "J 'in sure&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Fry is anything but an old man. Here is a let~.&#xD;
ter he has addressed to both you and father."&#xD;
"New Yoiu~,  ,&#xD;
"To ~ PARTICULAR FRIENDS, MR. AND MRS.&#xD;
BLITHE: A very delicate subject will be presented for&#xD;
your consideration in this letter. It respects your approval&#xD;
of an intimate connection between myself and your daugh-&#xD;
ter Edith. You have had a perfect knowledge of my char-&#xD;
acter from boyhood. I know there is a disparity in our&#xD;
years, but only enough, I apprehend, VOL add the test of&#xD;
experience which neutralizes the folly of youth. Should&#xD;
you, therefore, accept my proposal to wed Miss Edith,&#xD;
may I hope the event will not long be delayed ~ I trust&#xD;
my pecuniary resources are adequate~ to common emer-&#xD;
gencies; so that we may commence, and with ordinary&#xD;
success continue, in a rational mode of living, in keeping&#xD;
with your daughter's former style. Please answer by&#xD;

"Who is the reigning married belle of the season, at&#xD;
the Ocean House ~" I inquired, upon my arrival the&#xD;
next season.&#xD;
"A Mrs. Fry, from New York," was the reply. '~ She&#xD;
is truly lovely, and her countenai~icc and manners are&#xD;
faultless. Besides, she has a most fascinating man for a&#xD;
husband."&#xD;
I gazed at the belle as she entered the dinixig.-hail. It&#xD;

&#xD;
THE MAY-J~AY FE$TIYAL.&#xD;
TEE flowers resolved upon holding a festival on May-&#xD;
day. They issued their invitations between the sunshine&#xD;
and showers which flekle April produced. But it was&#xD;
thought expedient to call a convention, and decide who&#xD;
ani~ng all the gay races would be present. No sooner&#xD;
had little~ Miss "Crocus" received her invi1~ation, than&#xD;
she rose from her snowy embankment, arrayed in her ves-&#xD;
tal whiteness, and declared her willingness to be present,&#xD;
at the same time prefacing her remarks with the expecta-&#xD;
tion that her robe might be somewhat soiled from its pure&#xD;
delicacy, by the frequent contact ~ expected to encoun-&#xD;
ter with the rough blasts of the season.&#xD;
The Misses "Jonquil and Daffodil" next rose, and&#xD;
signified their desire to grace the floral feast. They were&#xD;
fron~ the sunny ~quarters against which defensess and&#xD;
shields protected them from the rough 'usage of sister&#xD;
April, at whose concert they had for years annually ap..&#xD;
peared; and although they sometimes quailed at the in-&#xD;
harx~eniox~s utterances with whieh she attuned her wind&#xD;
instruments yet they had, always basked in her gra-&#xD;
smiles, and appeared in full costume~ at her opening&#xD;
d~spl&amp;amp;y. ~J~hq, with pleasure accepted the call to~ppear&#xD;
in the convention.,&#xD;
&#xD;
A lowly, timid maiden, clothed in deep yellow, spoke&#xD;
despondingly, and doubted whether her tribe, as a whole,&#xD;
would venture into the gay assemblage. We at once&#xD;
recognized the look of our familiar friend, the "Dande-&#xD;
lion." She remarked she had never been petted by her&#xD;
aristocratic neighbors in the bouquet, but that she had for&#xD;
centuries bloomed outside the garden wall and among&#xD;
common pathways; and that although she was of humble&#xD;
origin, and often passed by as worthless, yet she was&#xD;
highly prized by her jaundice&amp;amp; patients, and eagerly&#xD;
~QUght for at her first appearance as the harbinger of&#xD;
health; and although she was seldom present at evening&#xD;
parties, yet she had the honor of being conspicuous at&#xD;
many a rich man's dinner table! She could not, there..&#xD;
fore, feel assured that she should appear at the May-day&#xD;
fes~0~~ a bright little wild flower, clothed in a robe&#xD;
of delicate pink, who next took the speaker's stand., She&#xD;
remarked that her residence was in an uncongenial cli.&#xD;
mate to most of the sisterhood, yet she delighted to live&#xD;
in damp soil, and among shady retreats; that she was on&#xD;
perfect terms of intimacy with the wild "Honeysuckle,"&#xD;
and they were neighborly and content, ay, and~ far less&#xD;
likely to wither, than when ruthless hands transferred&#xD;
them to china vases in splendid drawing-rooms, thus in-&#xD;
troducing them into society from which they naturally&#xD;
shrank often becoming sickly, and soon dropping&#xD;
from their elevated position, preferring the mossy rock&#xD;
upon which they originally grew, to all the heated splen-&#xD;
dor vihich surrounded them. Upon hearing~ these words,&#xD;
Miss "Violet," clothed in her delicate blue attire, Caine&#xD;

forward most timidly, and wasreceived with much applause.&#xD;
She spoke of a seeming delicate constitution, yet, having&#xD;
laid imprisoned beneath a snow-flake, or encased in a&#xD;
globule of ice, she had been permitted for some weeks to&#xD;
expand her roots, and niake~an early appearance, as one&#xD;
of the indicators that Spring had arrived. But she&#xD;
was exceedingly flexible, could bear no rough usage away&#xD;
from the clump t~ which she was attached, and remarked,&#xD;
unless attended by a train of her companions, she should&#xD;
prefer to diffuse her sweetness in the open field which&#xD;
nature.had assigned her; she could not well bear trans-&#xD;
planting.&#xD;
A modest variegated "Daisy" next blushingly came&#xD;
forward. She signified that it was quite too early for her&#xD;
to appear on May-day in the open air that from her&#xD;
box of earth she had only looked through a glass case-&#xD;
ment,, and, as she had been so delicately reared, she feared&#xD;
an outward exposure; besides, she was under a peremp-&#xD;
tory engagement to keep her stand within view of &amp;amp; sick&#xD;
sufferer, whose eyes always turned toward her with de-&#xD;
light. Upon this remark, however, a confused number&#xD;
of voices were~ heard, all declaring that they were equally&#xD;
prized 'by the invalid, whereupon the gardener at the hot-&#xD;
house oomtnanded silence, and, throwing over them a&#xD;
shower of moisture, they were soon seen bathed in a&#xD;
flood of tears!&#xD;
Miss "Heliotrope" made a short speech, which was&#xD;
encored, and a sentiment was offered to the effect that&#xD;
"she 'was the sweetest of Miss Spring's daughters,"&#xD;
which 'threw Eer into such a delirious fragrance that she&#xD;
was, more than ever, the admiration of all. The&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
"Bulbs," next came out in their glasses; but as they had&#xD;
not much depth, and were full of doubts whether they&#xD;
should be disengaged, jit was concluded to dismiss them&#xD;
at pleasure.&#xD;
There was a call at this time for the "Moss Rose"&#xD;
and "Tulip," the "Cactus" and "Japonica," the Dah-&#xD;
lia" and "Lily," when a delicate little Ilower, known as&#xD;
Miss "Clover," addressed the meeting. She spoke of&#xD;
making an earlier appearance than was her annual cus-&#xD;
torn; but, being petted by Miss April amidst sunshine and&#xD;
showers, she had ventured too early she feared for a public&#xD;
appearance. She observed that she did not appear with~&#xD;
out a train of companions, and therefore a non-compliance&#xD;
with their invitation might be expected. There was a,&#xD;
decided reluctance in the choicest exotics and the culti-&#xD;
vated garden flowers, to 'grace the convention; they~&#xD;
were preparing for a more public exhibition, in more&#xD;
showy quarters, under the scientific care of the "Horti-&#xD;
cultural Society."&#xD;
Yet there were seine excellent remarks made 'by the&#xD;
early Spring flowers., They observed that scores of&#xD;
maidens and lovers were continually seeking them. In-&#xD;
deed, their native charms were unadorned, and~ so they&#xD;
attracted unfeigned admiration. On the whole, the&#xD;
members of the convention acquitted themselves with&#xD;
credit, and concluded to appear in sufficient nuinbem&#xD;
and strength to grace the foreheads of the May Queens,&#xD;
and to be borne in admiration among select private&#xD;
groups, who promised to meet them at an early hour&#xD;
on May morning, and transfer them to the ~nost eligible&#xD;
quarters. ' 22&#xD;

MR. TANGLE'S EXPERIMENT.&#xD;
MR. TANGLE, above all things, loved rural life; so he&#xD;
bought a cottage, and took up his residence "in the sub-&#xD;
urbs." His family were delighted with the arrangement;&#xD;
it would be so pleasant to sit under shady trees and eat&#xD;
fruit seasoned with the richest cream, and to sleep all&#xD;
night with such refreshing breezes to fan them. And so&#xD;
neighbor. Tangle left the bricks and mortar of the city to&#xD;
tread upon velvet lawns. He purchased the "Major's&#xD;
place," where, for ~ long time, there had been a placard,&#xD;
"This Place for Sale or to Let," and entered upon his&#xD;
labors like an energetic man. He purchased a hoe,&#xD;
a spade, and a rake; a horse, a cow, and a cart. He&#xD;
hired a man and a woman to make things go on agree~&#xD;
ably to all parties. His ~wife could drive the' horse, and&#xD;
his children could all stow away in the' carryall, and&#xD;
never did a family enjoy more in prospect.&#xD;
"Weeds shall never grow in my grounds," was the&#xD;
motto of Mr. Tangle; but the ambitious little runners&#xD;
had displayed their roving habits before he entered upon&#xD;
his labors. The "hired man" was employed to subdue&#xD;
them, while his master wrought among ~the flower-beds.&#xD;
How Mr. Tangle did work! How long he kept out&#xD;
in the hot sun, feeling like a delighted husbandman!&#xD;
&#xD;
how short a respite intervened between his labors! At&#xD;
last came evening - cool, dewy evening, "so fragrant and&#xD;
refreshing;" but, alas! there came with it a strange&#xD;
sensation, and Mr. Tangle was not able to stand erect!&#xD;
How his back ached, and how stooping he went into his&#xD;
house, and what a suffering night followed! His limbs&#xD;
were all stiffened there was a feverish action, a cramp, a&#xD;
rheumatic affection, a loss of appetite; and, finally, all&#xD;
the charms which so cheered him a week ago, had lost&#xD;
their power to do so.&#xD;
ile sent for his city physician, who pronounced his&#xD;
disease "the result of over-exertion." It took. him a&#xD;
week to recover his upright position, and, ever after, the&#xD;
sight of "spade and hoe" was only suggestive of pain&#xD;
and misery. The weeds grew among the flowers, and the&#xD;
grass became entangled with the borders, and there was&#xD;
an air of neglect which crept over his half-acre lot. He&#xD;
came to the conclusion that he was not born to till the&#xD;
soil, and went back to his old counting-room, as soon as&#xD;
he had found and reported the old placard, whereon was&#xD;
written, "This Place for Sale or to Let ;" and there it&#xD;
stands, just where it was when it first met his eye. Am-&#xD;
ateur farmers will please observe it.&#xD;

perfectly stale; and merely summoned you to say that,&#xD;

Michael enters, with a profound bow.&#xD;

A WE~K AT THE FARM-HOUSE.&#xD;
A LITTLE robin sat perched on the highest bough of&#xD;
a tall tree. There he sang, and warbled forth for hours&#xD;
his sweetest notes, making the evening air vocal with his&#xD;
rich tones. Day after day he continued this practice,&#xD;
with little interruption, and only at nightfall was he&#xD;
missed from his accustomed seat. Long, long before the&#xD;
tired laborers awoke, he was a am caroling his morning&#xD;
matins, refreshing~ the restless~ sleepless sufferer, ~who&#xD;
had counted the weary hours of night. And what was&#xD;
the office of this tiny songster '~ Was it to gladden my&#xD;
heart that he made himself so vocal ~ Ay, not me alone,&#xD;
for, underneath his seat, his companion had built her&#xD;
nest; and, while she sat at her Weary task, her loving&#xD;
mate attempted to cheer her with his most tuneful notes. '&#xD;
No. doubt the phraseology, interpreted, meant, "I will&#xD;
inform thee of impending danger, and should the mighty&#xD;
eagle, or any of the feathered tribe, invade our premises,&#xD;
I will give thee 'note of preparation.'" And then the&#xD;
potectin~ ~songster would flit away a few paces, and&#xD;
return with a morsel of food, and; kindly dropping it in&#xD;
the nest, remount, and sing again a livelier strain.&#xD;
What a lesson to a jarring 1~ouseho1d did this robin&#xD;
teach! How, when weariedwitli care, or worn down&#xD;

&#xD;
with labor do the accents of sympathy cheer and reserve&#xD;
the spirits! how does the feeling that a protecting hand&#xD;
is held out to support us, help us to bear together what&#xD;
would separately ~sh us! And just this kind of reli~&#xD;
ance we are invited to feel in ~our heavenly Parent's.&#xD;
care.&#xD;
The faithful hen. All day long, a hawk ha~d been hov~&#xD;
ermg at. short intervals over a brood of chickens. Just&#xD;
as the parent hen saw him approaching, she gave a pierc..&#xD;
ing shriek and g4hered her brood under her wings. This&#xD;
summoned the cock, who raised his erect comb, and gave&#xD;
a note of defiance. We looked in vain for any abatement&#xD;
of these creatures' care. Their instinct seemed almost to&#xD;
approach the reasoning faculty; for, when the danger was&#xD;
past, the hen arose, and the brood commenced busily piok~&#xD;
ing at every seed or tinfstone, as if anxious to improve&#xD;
the time till they should be again invaded.&#xD;
What a moral we could have drawn of watchfulness&#xD;
against impending dangers t Were we alike careful and&#xD;
used our forecast aright, how many wrecks of fortune and&#xD;
reputation might be saved! The hawk ~till pursued, but&#xD;
the hen bafi~ed his designs by her unceasing care. So&#xD;
might we escape many furious birds of prey, did our&#xD;
reason serve us as well as her instinct!&#xD;
The weaned calf. Gri~zing by the door of the hus~&#xD;
bandman's cottage was the brindled calf. The mother&#xD;
was a singularly gentle creature, and overflowed with&#xD;
ziatur~l milk, beside that of "kindness." She was so&#xD;
cherished, that her progeny was reared to take her place;&#xD;
and the frisky little animal would eat bread from the&#xD;
hand, ~ri~k 'warm milk' from the pail, and so readily&#xD;
&#xD;
accommodate herself to her owner's wishes, That she never&#xD;
bellowed for her mother, but quietly took what was given&#xD;
her; and, when tired of grazing, as if fond of human&#xD;
sympathy, would stand in the doo!'-way and thrust her&#xD;
nose within; and so the tender creature won the good~&#xD;
will of all around the rural homestead. Early training&#xD;
effected all this; and might it not be so with a superior&#xD;
race, if they were early led to the cultivation of the heart'~&#xD;
Might Ihey not be reared by faithful mothers, and trained&#xD;
by after-influences, to become benefactors of our race'?&#xD;
The unruly cow. The farmer called her breachhy"&#xD;
She showed her skill one morning in removing from her&#xD;
enclosure. She was driven to the rich pasture, but had&#xD;
an unaccountable love of straying out of it. No sooner&#xD;
had the little driver deposited her safely, and whistled&#xD;
his way homeward, than the restless creature took her&#xD;
horns and raised every rail from its post, and made her&#xD;
way to the public road. A passer-by put up the fence,&#xD;
and travelled pn, thinking he had done good service to a&#xD;
neighbor.&#xD;
Jt so happen~1, at nightfall, that the owner of the ~ow&#xD;
went for her, and, finding her in the road grazing con-&#xD;
tentedly, he easily inferred that the faithful boy had not&#xD;
turned her into her pasture; for how, reasoned he, came&#xD;
the fence up? Surely, the creature that could tear&#xD;
down, could not replace the work! In vain did the boy&#xD;
protest that he put the animal where he was desired; and&#xD;
it was only when his master learned, from him who put&#xD;
up the bars, that it was so, that he was reinstated in his&#xD;
confidence.&#xD;

opiuioi~. ~f acts, which, circumstantially viewed, seemed to&#xD;
present but one side, and that an unfavorable one! We&#xD;
might have added, another additional argument, which&#xD;
proved that the cow 'had not been put in the pasture,&#xD;
viz., the neighbors had observed her all day feeding out&#xD;
of' it. How frequently do our prejudices become&#xD;
strengthened by the superadded weight of trifling cir-&#xD;

The worn-out horse. He fed in the door-yard. For&#xD;
many years he had done service in the heavy-laden team,&#xD;
a~nd, pacing back and forth to the neighboring village,&#xD;
he had carried the heavy lumber. But now his joints&#xD;
grew stifi; his legs refused their office, and the poor&#xD;
creature was turned in the verdant lawn to graze at will.&#xD;
When he laid down, he could not rise without assistance;&#xD;
and the blanched eye of the poor animal told full well&#xD;
that he was a sufferer. Yet he meekly fed, and his mas-&#xD;
tsr had a hope that he would again do service. Did you&#xD;
never see other worn-out specimens, those who had&#xD;
drudged and trudged life's dusty ways, that only laid by&#xD;
when a sense of helplessness forbade i~Lhem to labor 3&#xD;
They never enjoyed but in prospect, and the treasures&#xD;
of years' accumulation had little worth when the palsied&#xD;
limbs and dim visions of premature old age came upon&#xD;
them.&#xD;
And there were other ~summer' sights." The ant&#xD;
was toiling upon her bed of sand, the hornet was build-&#xD;
ing his clayey nest, the swallow was fluttering over the&#xD;
babbling brook, the caterpillar was preparing for her&#xD;
transformation, and all nature seemed obedient to the&#xD;
laws of its Creator. Truly, this seemed a good world,&#xD;

a pleasant world, and why should we not call it a~ hap p~,i&#xD;

WORDS OF KINDNESS.&#xD;
NELLY MoKIN was a child of Scottish descent. Her&#xD;
Thtlier died iii her infancy; and her mother, being strait-&#xD;
ened in pecuniary circumstances, was advised to seek in&#xD;
America a home for herself and child, as offering better&#xD;
remuneration for the toilsome life of plain sewing, to&#xD;
which she now resorted for a livelihood. The poor woman&#xD;
lent a credulous ear to the story that money flowed plen~&#xD;
tifully in our streets, and embarked to assure herself&#xD;
of the fact.&#xD;
* Upon her arrival she found herself nearly penniless,&#xD;
exhausted by a long voyage, and landed upon an inclem-&#xD;
ent shore, with none to~ raise the eye of pity or extend&#xD;
the hand of relief. She was a stranger, and knew not to&#xD;
whom to apply. Even her own countrymen seemed&#xD;
hardened by severity, and manifested no tenderness&#xD;
toward the new emigrant who appeared among them.&#xD;
Little Nelly could only cling to the scanty skirts of&#xD;
her mother, and in* wonder trudge through our streets,&#xD;
unable to divine why her mother sought such an inhos-&#xD;
pitable shore. Besides, she was the only surviving one&#xD;
of a family of eight children.&#xD;
After many fruitless attempts to command labor, and&#xD;
a shelter which would wear a neat and comfortable air,&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. MoKin at length fell in with an honest, pitying&#xD;
heart of her own sex, from the Emerald isle, who olThred&#xD;
to share her room and furniture with her till such time&#xD;
as she could recompense her for the kindness.&#xD;
Mrs. MoKin then flowed the direction of some falsely-&#xD;
styled philanthropic people, who directed her to certain&#xD;
slop-shops, where, by excessive toil, she could only man-&#xD;
age to procure her daily bread, leaving scarcely a cent&#xD;
whereby she could help defray the rent of her tenement.&#xD;
The poverty and loneliness of her own heart she eould bet-&#xD;
ter have endured, had she not been compelled to witness&#xD;
the inroads it made upon the tender susceptibilities of&#xD;
little Kelly. The child had always been accustomed to a&#xD;
plenty of common food, and she had hitherto ate, it with&#xD;
a blithesome spirit,- and that always sweetens the coars-&#xD;
est fare.' But now there was a stint; both her mother&#xD;
and herself could not enjoy their homely meal, and feel&#xD;
that their appetites were appeased; and so one coaxed the&#xD;
other to take the last spare morsel, each feeling the&#xD;
other had the most need of sustenance.&#xD;
It may seem, to many outside observers of human con-&#xD;
dition, that to feel the cravings of hunger i~an unneces..&#xD;
sary thing. They think of their full larder, and of the&#xD;
over supply which they would gladly render to such.&#xD;
Bat how do the destitute know where to find such a sup-&#xD;
ply? How gladly would the Scotchwoman have become&#xD;
the useful inmate of a family, or her little Kelly have&#xD;
lent her aid, could such a place have been assigned them!&#xD;
Yet they lived in a neighborhood where luxuries abounded,&#xD;
themselves inhabiting the only room over a livery stable,&#xD;
which wa~ occupied as a "poor tenement."&#xD;

&#xD;
Iiittle Nelly at length became what we call a "shav-&#xD;
ing girL" She used to frequent the carpenters' shops&#xD;
and fill her basket; and then, going to the doors of the&#xD;
opulent, she SoxzLetimes obtained a few cents, with which&#xD;
she bought a loaf of bread, which, in her first efforts, so&#xD;
gladdened her heart that it really deprived her of her&#xD;
usual appetite. She had 8 winning voice, a sweet smile,&#xD;
and clear eye, which looked as if no taint of sin lurked&#xD;
beneath, and no hypocritical guise concealed the truth of&#xD;
her somewhat reluctant coiifession of poverty. S'till~'she&#xD;
met with a cold and forbidding reception at most Oil! the&#xD;
placess where she sought for aid, and not infrequently&#xD;
was the doer rudely shut in her face, with the coarse&#xD;
expression, "]3egone, and never trouble me. again!"&#xD;
Perhaps this grating language was 'not entirely charge-&#xD;
able upon ~those that uttered it; for are not our domestics&#xD;
so constantly admonished to beware of street beggary, that&#xD;
thay only reiterate the' language which their employers&#xD;
~y have put in their mouths 3&#xD;
And so little 1~elly 'trudged onee more to a door she&#xD;
he4 often frequented without being severely repulsed.&#xD;
~he 4omestics, at varied occupations, heeded not her&#xD;
gentle ringing of the gate-bell; but the lady of the&#xD;
hou~e i~nswered it. The soft, plaintive voice of the deso-&#xD;
late child struck a vein of' tender sympathy in the heart&#xD;
of 'that lady. She took her full basket 'of shavings, and&#xD;
kindi~r added~ "Come in, my' little girl, and warm your-&#xD;
4',&#xD;
A. tear stood in Nelly's eye. It was shed at the voice&#xD;
of' kindness.. So she followed her new friend, and an-&#xD;
swered' her many inquiries as to her place of abode and&#xD;
&#xD;
STYM~ANOE ,AND SHAD0W~.&#xD;
tier destitution, in such a trut1tf~d and simple ~naaunpr as&#xD;
completely won the heart of her benefactress. She mime-&#xD;
diately went to a receptacle of castoff garments, and,&#xD;
taking therefrom a supply suited to her condition in mid-&#xD;
winter, most surprisingly gladdened the hea~'t of the des~.&#xD;
olate child by fitting them on her person, and tying up a&#xD;
little package for her mother ~ which was followed by so&#xD;
many hearty thanks that no one, by the look and man-&#xD;
ner, could have doubted the sincerity.&#xD;
This kind lady did not feel, as many do, that, before&#xD;
bestowing her alms, she must first make a formal call to&#xD;
become an eye-witness .of absolute poverty; she saw&#xD;
before her a shivering, thinly-clad diild, and she knew&#xD;
by substituting more comfortable garments she was doing&#xD;
no evil service; for sometimes we. seem to read clearly&#xD;
in the eye. and manner of a sufi~rer that destitution is not&#xD;
synonymous with imposition.. So she bade little Nell~&#xD;
come again at a stated time, and she would furnish her&#xD;
with another supply.&#xD;
The grateful child ran home in perfect delight. The~&#xD;
world was all sunshine to her now. She was soon a~&#xD;
her mother's door, and, having displayed.a bright silver&#xD;
piece, a basketful of ~omfortable and neatly-assorted&#xD;
provisions, and a supply of clothing which exactly met&#xD;
the wants of the mother, they both fell on their knees&#xD;
and thanked their heavenly Father for raising up to&#xD;
them such an unknown friend. Few more fervent&#xD;
prayers 6were ever breathed; and the little girl seemed&#xD;
wild with delightat her unexpected success. She be~ght&#xD;
two candles at the neighboring grocer's, and, having&#xD;
secured a few sticks of'drifl~-wood, that mother and child&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="268-269" xml:id="VAC8250-00000134"/>&#xD;
were ~realIy, more heartily ~lad than many in an opulent&#xD;
mansi&amp;amp;i.&#xD;
At the time appointed, however, for Kelly to make&#xD;
her next call upon her benefactress, she dad not appear.&#xD;
That evening ~ messenger came to say that the child was&#xD;
very sick, and could only beg that '.' the lady who spoke&#xD;
those kind words to her would come and see her." She&#xD;
spoke not of outward gifts, -. it was only the kind words&#xD;
~which seemed to linger in her heart. "They were the&#xD;
first," said she, "that were ever spoken to me;" and&#xD;
they. were the last, save the accents of a mother's voice,&#xD;
whence nothing else could emanate.&#xD;
Her benefactress called to see her; but Kelly's eyes&#xD;
were closed, and her little heart beat faintly. ~he could&#xD;
neither hear nor eec, - yet there was one incoherent&#xD;
expression which she attempted to utter. It was of" the&#xD;
lady who spoke - the kind words."&#xD;
This simple narration, is strictly true, and with it is&#xD;
embodied a touching meaning the power of a kind&#xD;
word to the forsaken and friendless. It has a magic&#xD;
spell which often reconciles the distressed to any out-&#xD;
war4 condition, fir more than even the relief of present&#xD;
wants.&#xD;
Those words were incorporated in the soul of little&#xD;
Kelly. She went to heaven's gates with the cheering&#xD;
accents; and if the spirits of the departed are permitted&#xD;
to welcome those who follow after them, may not she who&#xD;
spoke those words of kindness hope to be recognized by&#xD;
th8#grateful child, where all the artificial distinctions of&#xD;
Bociety are done away, and the sweet charities and&#xD;
benevolent, acts of this life are alone accounted worthy&#xD;
&#xD;
of remembrance ' Speak, then, 0 speak words of kind~&#xD;
ness to the suffering, if you can do nothing more!&#xD;
Stands at thy gate no suffering child,&#xD;
With sad, imploring air,&#xD;
Who asks of thee her daily bread,&#xD;
And would thy pity share?&#xD;
Lean, shivering, wan, that haggard child&#xD;
Solicits but in vain;&#xD;
Thy door is closed with grating voice,-&#xD;
"Begone! come not again."&#xD;
Methinks, ere long, there is a gate&#xD;
At which thou knockest too;&#xD;
And, as itopes, that little child&#xD;
Stands present to thy view.&#xD;
Her guardian angel waits to hear,&#xD;
How urgent thy request!&#xD;
The door now closes with the voice,&#xD;
"I know thee 'not, thou stranger guest;&#xD;
For, inasmuch as to this child&#xD;
The voice of love thou did~t deny,&#xD;
So, now, to thy soliciting,&#xD;
I must like thee reply."&#xD;
The guest stood waiting, quite shut out~&#xD;
From an expected bliss,&#xD;
And felt how sad was the reverse&#xD;
Between that world and this!&#xD;

&#xD;
EVADING A DUN.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT is curious to notice how some 'people can evade a&#xD;
dun. There is the rich Mr. Skinner, who buys every-&#xD;
thing on credit. lie gets his work, too, done by the best&#xD;
of mechanics; but they are not cash jobs. 1f by way&#xD;
of accommodation, a person to whom he is indebted sends&#xD;
a messenger, stating, "it will greatly oblige him if he&#xD;
would cash hi~ receipted bill," sometimes, if he feels in&#xD;
a pleasant mood, Mr. Skinner will do sp, provided the&#xD;
"fractional part over the amount is "given in ;" but let a&#xD;
common workman present his bill for 'payment a few&#xD;
days after his work is done, and he will be told "to go&#xD;
about his business; that he only settles his accounts when&#xD;
he receives his dividends, which is semi-annually; and&#xD;
that if he wants any better treatment he may take a job&#xD;
of some one else the nekt time' Now, as every one&#xD;
knows Mr. Skinner is sure pay when the six months have&#xD;
expired, he is passed over as a "hard customer ;" and,&#xD;
to 'keep in his favor, it is generally known that only&#xD;
semi-annually one must expect his payment.&#xD;
Sometimes, Mr. Skinner boasts how much the interest&#xD;
amounts to which he derives from thus 'withholding a&#xD;
settlement; but he always forgets to mention 'how much&#xD;
inconvenience and extra interest those to whom he is&#xD;
indebted are Qbliged to pay to meet their liabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, with our neighbor Tolman, the style o~f reason-&#xD;
ing is very different. He affirms that Mr. Skinner&#xD;
inherited his wealth, and never knew the anxiety attend-&#xD;
ant upon not "quite enough;" whereas, he has been in&#xD;
strait places, and feels it is only due the laborer to be&#xD;
paid when 'his work is done. He therefore never has any&#xD;
running accounts, and it was never said to him, "Will&#xD;
it be convenient for you to settle our little bill to-day'?"'&#xD;
and yet he seldom gets a job done as cheaply as friend&#xD;
Skinner1 for he has not the desire to beat those down&#xD;
with whom he contracts.&#xD;
There is another class, who always have a frivolous&#xD;
excuse whereby they avoid a dun, and defer payment.&#xD;
The sight of a bill always finds them with an excuse for&#xD;
withholding payment. Either "they have not yet ex-&#xD;
amined. the one rendered," or "they have been absent,&#xD;
or disappointed in receiving some expected remittances,"&#xD;
or "there appears to be a slight mistake which requires&#xD;
the supervision of the book-keeper;" all these are again&#xD;
and again urged merely to postpone a ~~ttlement. This&#xD;
is the delinquent creditor who generally settles arrearages&#xD;
in July that were ~lue in January.&#xD;
Then there is the man in moderate circumstances, who&#xD;
means to pay as soon as he possibly can, and who hates a&#xD;
dun tremendously; but he is constantly assailed by a&#xD;
dapper little collector, who says, "We are greatly incon-&#xD;
venienced by such small amounts as yours, sir, and when&#xD;
may we with certainty expect our bill liquidated'?"&#xD;
This man is sure to be punctual to the time assigned;&#xD;
but he says to his family, "I don't know how it is that&#xD;
people contrive to evade duns, and postpone paymeuW;&#xD;

for my part, if I procure an article one week, I am sure&#xD;
to hear'from it the next; while my neighbor has a six&#xD;
months' reprieve without having an item presented to&#xD;
him?'&#xD;
'The fact is, nobody is afraid to dun the man who buys&#xD;
but a small amount. The reasoning is, "If he don't pay&#xD;
promptly, keep on dunning, and force him to do it; it will&#xD;
be no great 1os~ to us if he withhold his patronage."&#xD;
Whereas Madam Bruno, who rides in her coach, and&#xD;
buys a thousand dollars' worth of silks and satins every&#xD;
six months, on1y has to bid her coachman stop a moment&#xD;
while she goes in to the bookkeeper, and says, "My&#xD;
bill, sir, which you sent me last week, will not be settled&#xD;
'for two or three months ~" and the young man with the&#xD;
pen behind his ear bows very obsequiously, and replies,&#xD;
"Just as it suits your convenience, Madam Bruno ;" and,&#xD;
as she walks 6ut toward the door 'to her carriage, one of&#xD;
the firm meets her with a most complaisant air, and asks&#xD;
"if he shall not have the pleasure of showing her some&#xD;
choice Thbrics he has just received'?"&#xD;
Now, who says there is no advantage in keeping a&#xD;
carriage? If any one, it must be he is profoundly igno~&#xD;

A PLEA FOR DOG-DAYS.&#xD;
EVERYBODY vilifies dog-days; there is no damp, um-&#xD;
comfortable morning, -~ no day when. the furniture is&#xD;
moist, and the flies light heavily, and bite voraciously,&#xD;
no time when you feel debilitated and worn down with&#xD;
having had a sleepless night, when. your disturbers have&#xD;
been a concert of cats, whose voices could not harmonize,&#xD;
or an army of mosquitos which, attacked you on every&#xD;
point, - but forthwith comes the exclamation, "We&#xD;
always have such trials in dog~days!" And so this&#xD;
portion of time has come to be voted as the meanest,&#xD;
most disagreeable, unendurable, of all days in the calen-&#xD;
dar.&#xD;
Now, for one, I should like to know ho~ we could&#xD;
dispense with dog-days? We might do without' dogs,&#xD;
I admit, because we can. dispense with hydrophobia, and&#xD;
that emanates from the canines; but I should like to&#xD;
know how we could live without the results which spring&#xD;
from dog-days. Suppose it is a time "when all Bed-&#xD;
lam and Parnassus is let out," when flies do bite, and&#xD;
children scream, and seren~Iers are out till midnight,&#xD;
and the anixxial~ kick in the stable, and the house-dogs&#xD;
growl and howl as their peculiar prerogative, 'and women&#xD;
scold their husbands, and old bachelors clear o~' to new&#xD;

&#xD;
boarding-houses; suppose the milk is sour, and the air&#xD;
is damp and foggy, With occasionally a flash of lightning&#xD;
and a roar of thunder; who cannot bear six weeks out of&#xD;
fifty-two, which are not altogether so pleasant, when the&#xD;
harvest days come along, and the earth yields her richest&#xD;
products, which were maturing all the time we were&#xD;
defaming the weather?&#xD;
I should like to inquire what great achievements were&#xD;
ever carried forward without some drawbacks, some&#xD;
endurances, some days of despondency, when the head&#xD;
ached, and the heart grew sick? Dog-days, we admit,&#xD;
are peculiarly trying t9 strong as well as weak nerves;&#xD;
but for them, what woman could ever induce her husband&#xD;
to take a journey, and shnt up the house, and leave his&#xD;
unpaid notes, and welcome evei~ railroad train that car-&#xD;
ries him further and further from bank and counting-&#xD;
moms~ and old dingy associations?&#xD;
If there were no dog-days, what would become of&#xD;
those delightful watering~places, where swarms do con-&#xD;
gregate, and cheerfully coop up in seven-by-nine bed-&#xD;
rooms, and are most happy to. pay' exorbitantly for&#xD;
such accommodations, with all other annoyances thrown&#xD;
in.&#xD;
If there were no dog-days, how could we test our&#xD;
endurance' of physical' evils? How should we learn to&#xD;
fed grateful for the difference between a morning when&#xD;
the starch is, literally all' wrung out of us, when our cof-&#xD;
fee tastes flat, and our neWspaper items are insipid, and&#xD;
our family are all 'out of sorts, one complaining'that&#xD;
her hair will not keep in curl; anethei~, that her newly-&#xD;
ironed f~ck~ is all tuiiibled; and a third, that the shine&#xD;
&#xD;
has disappeared from dicky and boots; I say, if we had&#xD;
no such mornings, h~w little should we prize those cool&#xD;
aut$nflal days when we are all on the right key, and&#xD;
everybody looks smiling and feels happy!&#xD;
And then there are the free-and-easy fashions which&#xD;
dog-days especially countenance. The prim gentleman&#xD;
can sit in his thin coat, and keep'on his slippers, doff his&#xD;
neck-cloth, unbutton his vest if a fleshy man, swing a&#xD;
fan to keep off. the flies in his afternoon lounge, con-.&#xD;
descending to remark on his wife's flounces, and the&#xD;
uncomfortable condition of gentlemen who are burdened&#xD;
with wigs; and the poor woman is all of a perspiration&#xD;
lest the false appendages when taken off should expose&#xD;
the fact of her husband's indebtedness to them for his&#xD;
youthful appearance; for size never appears with her&#xD;
natural charms, save in the privacy of her own room. The&#xD;
hottest morning finds the prim madam with her foretop&#xD;
smooth and glossy, her "stand-off~" under-skirt, and her&#xD;
rumpled, iron-rusted, white morning-dress; for the prim&#xD;
lady maintains that "dress commands respect."&#xD;
And then, besides all the. above enumerations, dog~&#xD;
days have a tendency to cure envious people.&#xD;
It was a hot morning some time in August, 1850,&#xD;
when, at early dawn, I looked across the way, and espied&#xD;
my neighbor, with his packed trunks ranged on the side-&#xD;
walk, and other undeniable marks that they were fitting&#xD;
out for a regular campaign in the country. Presently&#xD;
he locked his outside door, and ran across the street with&#xD;
the key, to know if I would take charge of it during an.&#xD;
absence of six weeks Immediately my envy was ex-&#xD;
cited. Why, reasoned I with ny~elg should the world.&#xD;

be so unequally divided? And then name the query, I&#xD;
wonder how he can afford such jaunts any better than I ~&#xD;
Somebody s~id he w~ deep~ in "fancy stocks." I hope I&#xD;
did not wish they would depreciate; but strange~thoughts&#xD;
run through envious brains. At any rate, when he&#xD;
wheeled round the corner in the carriage, with. all hi~&#xD;
family, my impulse was to leaVe the window. ~1?hen it&#xD;
flashed across my mind, how came he to think I could&#xD;
take charge of his key for six u'eeks? Was it decreed&#xD;
by everybody that I was a permanent fixture? I had&#xD;
half a mind to travel off that instant. But, as the day&#xD;
wore away, my feelings became more quiet. In a day&#xD;
or two after, as .1 was looking over the items in the&#xD;
morning journal, what should Ii discover but that "cer-&#xD;
tam burglars had entered Mr. S.'s dwelling, and abstracted&#xD;
many valuables, besides injuring the furniture and car-&#xD;
rying off every~ article of plate!" I took the key and&#xD;
marched over to the premises.. I felt no envy, then;&#xD;
everything was in a state of "glorious confusion." Added&#xD;
to all this, we were telegraphed that one of' my neigh-&#xD;
bor's children was taken sick on the route, and they were&#xD;
most uncomfortably situated at a poorly-conducted hotel!&#xD;
Did I wish myself in his place then, think you? This&#xD;
was the last time my envy was excited. I felt thankful&#xD;
I ha4 a home, and a nice bed, and airy chamber, and a&#xD;
healthy family; and all this lesson I acquired in dog-&#xD;
What if we do perspire freely? What if the feline&#xD;
race do~ hold ooticerts, and the canines howl, and the&#xD;
babiescry, and the sky lowers, and women fret? If we&#xD;
are but at home all these things can have an amicable&#xD;
&#xD;
adjustment. There are no landlords' bills t4~ settle, no&#xD;
"itew~"to quarrel over; and the effect of these debili..&#xD;
stating dog-days results in heavy crops, plenty of produce,&#xD;
a purse which no watering-place has emptied, and a con~.&#xD;
firination that the necessity of the stay at home princi-.&#xD;
pie is, after all, the most salutary. So, wipe the brow,&#xD;
and cheer up with the certain good results of dog-days.&#xD;
If the city is empty, then the air is purer, the streets&#xD;
less crowded, and one's home all the more agreeable.&#xD;

IN A DILEMMA.&#xD;
"THE child will die, Mr. Foote, unless we have some&#xD;
doctor, -and who shall we have? Do run and see&#xD;
neighbor Gray."&#xD;
"Mrs. Gray says, have a homoeopathist, by all means;&#xD;
but I met Mrs. Gill, and she says it is all a humbug to&#xD;
crack up this system. She knows two children who have&#xD;
died already under this treatment; she says, try no&#xD;
experiment, but doctor in the old-fashioned way, on the&#xD;
allopathic system. Then you will have nothing to&#xD;
reflect upon."&#xD;
Mrs. Jones drops in to give her advice. "N~ow,"&#xD;
says she, "as you are an inexperienced couple, I am&#xD;
going to advise you to try cold water and friction. I 'ye&#xD;
literally rubbed diseases down, and washed them off.&#xD;
I~obody thought my little Peggy would live,, but I kept&#xD;
on washing and rubbing till the dear creature opened her&#xD;
eyes, and seemed bright as ever."&#xD;
A. pail of water is furnished her, and a flesh-brush&#xD;
and hair mitten. The child squirms and cries, and the&#xD;
mother declares she must leave off&#xD;
Mrs. Jones is in the other room, insisting upon it the&#xD;
child must be treated with "energetic action," and rubs&#xD;
accotdingly, t6 get up a perspiration. Mrs. Gill says she&#xD;
&#xD;
looks upon such barbarous treatment as suicide; and&#xD;
Mrs. Gray says calomel is just as bad, but one of the&#xD;
homoeopathist powders would relieve instantly.&#xD;
Here Jim runs for her doctor, Mrs. Gill sends the&#xD;
father of the child for hers, and Mrs. Foote, in her&#xD;
excited state, remembering hQW "hot-drops" once&#xD;
relieved her, pours a quantity down the child's throat.&#xD;
By this time, the two physicians have arrived. They&#xD;
exchange glances at each other, and inquire if they are&#xD;
mistaken in being directed to this house; They refuse&#xD;
to confer together, and, both feeling their dignity some-&#xD;
what offended by the novelty of being sent for, as if the&#xD;
skill of e~ch is called in question, refuse to administer,&#xD;
and both decamp. Mrs. Foote has offended Mrs. Jones,&#xD;
and the child is now left quiet, and seems relieved; na-&#xD;
ture has thrown off the alarming symptoms, and who&#xD;
shall have credit for the cure ~I The mother says it was&#xD;
the "hot-drops ;" the father says it was the quiet after&#xD;
the rubbing; and Mrs. Jones says she did the work.&#xD;
And now comes the question, who will they eniploy&#xD;
when the child is next seized? People are all afloat&#xD;
on the system of medicine. One doses one way, and&#xD;
another a contrary; yet they both recover, have perfect&#xD;
faith in their own way of doctoring, and are loud in&#xD;
declaring against others. But hear the conclusion of the&#xD;
whole matter, as given by experience.&#xD;
Trust not thyself to quacks, neither in medicine nor&#xD;
religion. A prescription for thy conscience should be as&#xD;
accurate as one for thy stomach. Past~ keep thy mind&#xD;
cheerful and thy countenance hopeful, and diseases will&#xD;
not often come to thee; or should they threaten, they,&#xD;
will not find thee an easy prey to conquer.&#xD;

MALE COQUETRY.&#xD;
"WELL, mere attentions ought to mean something.&#xD;
If you, Mr. Small, have been appointing such special&#xD;
meetings, making engagements, likewise, to ride and&#xD;
walk, and everybody has construed them into .a court-&#xD;
ship, unless you mean something, you ought to pursue&#xD;
a different course."&#xD;
"But Mary is agreeable, and a pleasant girl to carry&#xD;

it will b&amp;amp; inconvenient for me to call for a week, and she&#xD;
actually wept when I left her for my travelling tour. I&#xD;
suppose she feels dependent upon my attentions.&#xD;
"Mr. Small, you are trifling with ~[ary's affections.&#xD;
What is she to understand by your glances and visits, and&#xD;
walks, and moonlight wanderings; by your sereflades,&#xD;
your selecting her as your first partner in the dance,&#xD;

you sought to win her regard? I ask you, Mr.. Small,&#xD;

suggestion of your name mantles her cheek with such a&#xD;
conscious blush, that I have seen her turn to the window&#xD;
for concealment; and then you may be assured those&#xD;
lonely musings in her chamber, and those solitary walks&#xD;
by the river-side, greatly favor the idea, that in the&#xD;
future she is weaving a Thntastic wreath of ivy over a&#xD;
cottage, wherein are the charms of wedded life. But&#xD;
tell me plainly, Small, did you never say anything by&#xD;
which she might construe these attentions into that&#xD;
which had its centre in the heart 'U'&#xD;
"Never, aunt, never! And, really, your eloquence&#xD;
has quite moved me. Mary has only been to me as a&#xD;
pretty pastime of my idle hours. She is a sweet vocalist,&#xD;
and we have only sung love songs, and glanced occasion-&#xD;
ally in each other's. faces. With the old man, too,. I have&#xD;
often accepted the honor of a. glass of wine; but I can&#xD;
look them all in the face without a fear of being aa'rested&#xD;

volley of smoke, and turned ever the pages of the book&#xD;

if 'he were not much interested in its contents, since~&#xD;
this conversation commenced.&#xD;
~?ar differently was Mary occupied. She was arrange~&#xD;
ing a bouquet of flowers, according to the language which&#xD;
they indicated, to present to Mr. .~Small; 'or' she was&#xD;
catching the sweetest tone of music, or practising the last&#xD;
chorus, hoping 'it would meet his enthusiastic approba-&#xD;
tion;' and when she was alone with him, ~he was hop~&#xD;
ing some of his sentimental sayings might be construed&#xD;
into some definite words, that the mere repetition of them&#xD;
might clothe them with an unmistakable, meaning. But,&#xD;
to do Small justice, he never did mean to trifle, except&#xD;
for his own pleasure; for ~he was supremely selfish, and,&#xD;
since the remarks of his aunt had resounded in his ears,&#xD;
he resolved to absent himself yet more and more; for&#xD;
he would not injure the pure affections of Mary, not he&#xD;
and so he saw her the less frequently, and was more&#xD;
taciturn.&#xD;
Mary~gre~ sad. She lost the vivacity of spirits and&#xD;
the elasticity 'of gait which were her former character-&#xD;
istics; there was a sinking at the stomach, a fluttering&#xD;
at the heart, a throbbing in the head'; restless nights fob&#xD;
lowed, 'and febrile symptoms called for medh~al aid.&#xD;
Alas f~r the prescriptionn which could not effect a cure!&#xD;
Then the incipient stages of consumption began to ap.&#xD;
pear, and a change of place was recommended. But&#xD;
Newport 'and Niagara both failed in restoring the bloom&#xD;
that ~had faded upon Mary's cheek. Mere lookers-on&#xD;
spoke of ~the baneful effects of our climate, in ~thus sap-&#xD;
ping the'vital springs of health; and' the beautiful world&#xD;
we lire in was' condemned as only fostering 'the 'seeds'of&#xD;

early decay. A sea-voyage was at length undertaken.&#xD;
Italian skies, Swedish landscapes, and England's brac-&#xD;
ing air, added to the subduing influence of time, did&#xD;
give a partial restoration; but Mary was never again&#xD;
the same blithe and happy being as before her affec-&#xD;
tions were thus chilled. There was a tinge of ro-&#xD;
mance, however, left in her nature. She lived among&#xD;
floWers and pensive scenes, and erelong the village&#xD;
clergyman became so enraptured withlier pure and gen-&#xD;
tle nature, that he offered her his ha~nd, and soon, after&#xD;
rejoiced in. the possession of so precious a tre~isure. Yet&#xD;
there was a sad history, all unrevealed in words, which&#xD;
those mere attentions had caused to tinge and shade her&#xD;
once bright and joyous spirit.&#xD;
And Mr. Small was still pursuing one gala day of&#xD;
enjoyment. lie did occasionally wonder if Mary were&#xD;
perfectly happy. He still had a kind of regard for her&#xD;
welfare; but the field was large and his friends promis-&#xD;
cuous. lie had since flirted with a dozen hearts and&#xD;
pretty faces; they were to him like garments when&#xD;
slightly worn, Which he threw off without compunction&#xD;
as some fresh charmer appeared. Yet Mr. Small was&#xD;
tolerated in excellent society; flirt as he might, and&#xD;
entrap the affections. as he did, he was always re-&#xD;
ceived with welcome, and scarcely a mother in the land&#xD;
but would have freely consented to bestow her daugh-&#xD;

had a singular faculty of pleasing, and his mind' was just&#xD;
cultivated enough to make him a fascinating companion;&#xD;

LOVE OFFASILION.&#xD;
You may talk about love 6f parents, and conjugal&#xD;
love, and brotherly love, and love of humanity, and love&#xD;
of the church; but what do they all amount to, when put'&#xD;
beside the love of fashion,- that everlasting pride of&#xD;
appearance, which drives so many into insanity, which&#xD;
makes so much wretchedness on account of unpaid bills,&#xD;
which torments 'when one would be at ease, whioli pro-&#xD;
duces a restlessness which no drug can relieve'? Yes,&#xD;
that insatiate demand, which must be appeased, makes&#xD;
the bane of existence to many sensitive minds;~ good-&#xD;
natured fellows, who hate to deny their wives and daugh-&#xD;
ters; 'who never did say "no"to an importunate request;&#xD;
who are made to believe it is necessary to have half a&#xD;
dozen French' hats and a change of jewelry once a&#xD;
month; who can easily be persuaded by daughter or&#xD;
wife that a change of climate is demanded by their&#xD;
impaired health. All these get the better of a man's ~com&#xD;
edition when his pe~uniax~y resources are insufficient~ and&#xD;
he is' the most unhappy man alive. 1'lace him on a&#xD;
splendid couch is~there any ease for him'? It is not&#xD;
that'fly that lights upon his face which annoys him. Those&#xD;
utipaid hills, and the face of that dunning little urchin,&#xD;
who, twice a week, wishes to know "'when it will be con-&#xD;

lie turns over his newspaper; but what avails it to him&#xD;

he has no interest there.&#xD;
"Why is it father is so dull '!" inquires young&#xD;
sixteen, flounced up to her waist - one item which helps&#xD;
out his misery. And just at this time the cook demands&#xD;
her wages, and the seamstress exacts her pay, and "wife"&#xD;
wants her purse replenished, and business is dull, and&#xD;
fashion is importunate, and the good man cannot make a&#xD;
clean breast of it, and say he does not feel as if he could&#xD;
afford the supplies; and so he goes on, goaded with a&#xD;
load of unrevealed anxieties, which prey upon his health,&#xD;
and completely victimize him, so that he 'pays the penalty&#xD;
by a short and fatal fever, or a paralysis, or some malady&#xD;
which suppressed grief has engendered.&#xD;
And what a family is left! The quantity of bomba~.&#xD;
zine and crape for mourning his loss tells the story.&#xD;
And then the estate is declared insolvent, and after a&#xD;
great outcry about the extravagance of the man's family&#xD;

patched-up widow of the late faabiQnable man'?&#xD;

SUD$TANCE AWP SHADOWS.          28~I&#xD;
&#xD;
*    CHANGI?~G PLACES.&#xD;
A RESTLE$S, roving habit, seems to be gaining in our&#xD;
community. Once it was considered almost indis-&#xD;
pensable to a good marriage that the husband should be&#xD;
the owner of the house he occupied, especially in the&#xD;
country. Now, ever!,where has become a city, every-&#xD;
bod~, has assumed city habits. The country shoemaker&#xD;
hires his tenement, because he does not consi4~r himself&#xD;
as "a fixture" in any village; the shopkeejer is making&#xD;
a trial, and boards his family at the hotel; the minister&#xD;
even has abandoned the old, ivy-grown parsonage, and&#xD;
takes "lodgings" with some wealthy parishioner. In&#xD;
the city, the trades-people move into the country in the&#xD;
summer, and back again in the autumn. We have few&#xD;
social firesides, and seldom does a man sit under his "own&#xD;
vine and fig-tree."&#xD;
What we are to become, where we are to gather the&#xD;
household band fifty years hence, on a time-honored&#xD;
"Thanksgiving," or a "Merry Christmas," is a mat-&#xD;
ter of some perplexity. If there are no family "man-&#xD;
sions;" 4f course one strong tie is broken that linked us&#xD;
with the past. As it now is, who can talk of his early&#xD;
home'? The child is born in one town, schooled in&#xD;
another, his lot is cast in yst another for subsistence;&#xD;
&#xD;
and, perhaps, the far West is destined to hold his family,&#xD;
and be his sepulchre.&#xD;
I should not wonder if our New England homes, our&#xD;
old family records, the places where our fathers lived,&#xD;
the very tombs of our ancestors, in coming time should&#xD;
only be a beautiful history relics which have passed&#xD;
away under the all-powerful ban of present "improve-&#xD;
inents." Do you not know, reader, many a homestead that&#xD;
has been transmitted for half a century, nay, more, some-&#xD;
times a hundred years, from father to son, and again to the&#xD;
same descendant of the same name; in the best parlor&#xD;
of whidi you may 6x4 the "coat of ~ "the record&#xD;
and genealogical tree," where all the different branches&#xD;
are traced'? And who would think of removing such a&#xD;
relic any n1o~ than displacing a landmark'? But times&#xD;
are beginning to change. The most promising son hears&#xD;
of large fortunes made in trade; of golden California, or&#xD;
some region where the slow accumulations from agricul-&#xD;
tural toil dwindle into insignificance. He goes to that&#xD;
spot; perhaps fails in~ health t~id purse; but still the life&#xD;
of a farmer does not suit his taste, and, rather than return&#xD;
back and take "the homestead," where he might live&#xD;
respectably, and die regretted, he suffers his patrimony&#xD;
to be sold into the hands of strangers, takes his pittance,&#xD;
perhaps settles on the banks of the Mississippi, dies of&#xD;
some "fell disease," and his children never see, and&#xD;
scarcely know, their father's birthplace!&#xD;
The ennobling business of agriculture is too often ex-&#xD;
changed for one of traffic or speculation in some distant&#xD;
city. This arises partly from our aversion to hard labor;&#xD;
but could I depict to you the thousand vexatious, the&#xD;

THE AUDIENCE AND THE LECTURER.&#xD;
WE hope it is an innocent amusement to watch the&#xD;
promiscuous company in a lecture-room, especially a&#xD;
crowded one. Arrive at what hour you may, somebody&#xD;
is sure to have preceded you. "Silsby," the man with&#xD;
the high dickey, always "foregoes" his tea, that he~ may&#xD;
occupy his particular seat directly in front of the lec-&#xD;
turer. He carefully arranges his wig, draws up his&#xD;
high overcoat collar, secures as much elbow-room a~ iS&#xD;
necessary, pulls out his evening paper, runs over the&#xD;
doings of the legislature and common council, and notes&#xD;
particularly the action upon 'the subject of a public&#xD;
library, as he is a bachelor, loves reading at a low rate,&#xD;
and imagines there may be some spare seats in. the appro-&#xD;
priated room.&#xD;
Ne,~t in turn comes in the Widow Wadman. She is&#xD;
generally found on the same settee with Silsby, although&#xD;
there appears to be no affinity between them, since the&#xD;
bachelor is quiet, and the old lady is all of a nettle.&#xD;
She has so many things to look after; her spectacles, her&#xD;
fan, her opera-glass, her muff and her ever-shoes, are&#xD;
all in particular places, before she can hear a word. That&#xD;
little roguish elf beside her is her grandson, and, as she&#xD;
C~iot ~ee in the distance, his tiny ~eok is continually&#xD;

and the passage of the Maine liquor law would ruin his&#xD;
trade; he is. conning over 8ome pan~graph adverse, to his&#xD;

are those "reserved seats," where some stupid fellow&#xD;
places his J' lady attendant," when they are suddenly&#xD;
driven out by the keeper in charge, while, just after, the&#xD;
particular friends of the orator enter and fill them.&#xD;
Finally, the lecturer enters. He may have a school-&#xD;
boy's gait, or a sailor's swagger, or a State.~street air;&#xD;
and, if he lacks in confidence, few places are so trying&#xD;
to his natural gait as the nine feet on 'the stage to the&#xD;
chair behind 'the desk. Now he takes out his notes, -&#xD;
opens a large white handkerchief, puts it to his mouth as&#xD;
an excuse to look upon the audien*, and forthwith is an-&#xD;
nounced and begins his theme. it takes some minutes to&#xD;
engage the minds of such an audience. You have their&#xD;
eyes at first, that is all.&#xD;

awake. Those a "little hard of hearing" place their&#xD;
hands behind their ears to catch th~ sound; the ~boys are&#xD;

&#xD;
MODERNIZING.&#xD;
Tais modernizing ha~ been the ruin of m~ny.&#xD;
Says one, I bave tried it, and e~peri~meiitaI owl-&#xD;
edge is worth a great deal. I once thought i~ w~ld l~&#xD;
a fine a0~'air to repair a house somewhat out of fashion,&#xD;
and thereby I should get the cost of my " prey rnent8 ~?&#xD;
back again in the market value of my estate. I wait~4&#xD;
to make a large parlor without folding-doprs; so I c~4le4&#xD;
upon my carpenter and 8taLed my plans, which he assure4&#xD;
me could be executed very satisfactorily. I engage him&#xD;
forthwith, and ~et about the business. It soon damped&#xD;
my wife's ardor, however, when she ~aw the d~t and&#xD;
confusion it occasioned, and so I was forced to hold on my&#xD;
way without sympaThy. The rooms were thrown into&#xD;
one, but what could I do with the ceiling?&#xD;
0&#xD;
The niason protested against p4ching the walls;'&#xD;
of course, then, the whole ceiling must be torn down~&#xD;
newly loathed, and freshly mortared. Then the bookez~s~&#xD;
on perceived as clearly ~ myself the impA~rtance of cut-&#xD;
ting down the ~indow~, throwing out an iron balustrade,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c. This was includedd on ; - but, alas! who ever want-&#xD;
ed two fire-places in one room, especially when bQth were&#xD;
rendered useless by a furnace? And what could be doi~e?&#xD;
WhyI had gone so fa~r, that I en4eav~re4 to'ma~ tl~&#xD;

&#xD;
as t~ultless as possible to myself and future purchasers.&#xD;
So the fire-places were removed, and yet the unseemly&#xD;
jog in the wall, which the chimney occasioned, left the&#xD;
monument to tell where they once stood. Just as I be-&#xD;
gan to think II saw the end, every one who stepped in to&#xD;
witness "the improvements," made the remark, "What&#xD;
a pity that the ceiling is so low! I think the cutting&#xD;
down of the windows a decided failure !"&#xD;
Upon settling with the carpenter, I found my "im-&#xD;
provements amounted to nearly six hundred dollars;&#xD;
my reason was sure his bill ought to be two hundred&#xD;
more, for the work 'on the chimneys was a heavy job;&#xD;
and sundries amounted to a few dollars short of a thou-&#xD;
~and. And had I accomplished my aim? Scarcely one&#xD;
looked upon the work but 'wondered I had not 8old the&#xD;
old 'house as it was, and purchased a modern one; for&#xD;
all the doors, windows, 'ceilings, and work in other parts&#xD;
of the building bore distinct marks of the 'very year it&#xD;
w~s completed. I was 'not satisfied, after all my labor,&#xD;
and concluded; after passing one uncomfortable winter in&#xD;
my large modem room, which the furnace was hardly suf-&#xD;
ficient to heat, I say, I concluded to sell my house!&#xD;
At a private sale I entirely failed in my purpose; at&#xD;
public auction it was finally sold for just two hundred&#xD;
less than I had I~een offered before I attempted to improve&#xD;
it! Passing by the premises a month after, I felt a little&#xD;
chagrined to see my improvements all displaced, and the&#xD;
owner putting things back into the very condition from&#xD;
which I had removed them.&#xD;
Modernir~ing is very common; but we should remember&#xD;

pie, a mafl generally looks best when he looks naturally.&#xD;
False whiskers seldom improve him; a wig does not look&#xD;
better than the gray hair which age puts on; indeed, any&#xD;
attempt to improve nature will generally prove a failure.&#xD;
I pity the girl who uses rouge instead of her natural&#xD;
complexion, - who modex~nizes her form almost to distor-&#xD;
tion, - who puts on artificial airs, and simpers affectedly;&#xD;
for I am well aware the object is never accomplished by&#xD;
such means.&#xD;
This is the season for modernizing. We lay aside ht4s,&#xD;
bonnets, coats, dresses, for a fashionable summeri~attire.&#xD;
See that it is becoming before you purchase. Do not&#xD;
wear a fashionable hat if you dislike it; do not wear an&#xD;
unbecoming bonnet because your milliner tells you it is&#xD;
fashionable. Do not repair your house unless you can&#xD;
improve it; do not do it unless you can afford it. Make&#xD;
no outlay which will haunt you if "money continues&#xD;
hard," or "banks' refuse' to discount freely ~" but always&#xD;
remember, seasonably, few people grieve over full purses,&#xD;
while many cry over empty, ones!&#xD;

fondly were they treasured, repeated and reechoed, by the&#xD;
little, fragile child, who seemed delighted with the trans-&#xD;
ports she thus inspired! And that feeble, tottering little&#xD;
walk, supported by chairs, and held up by various arti-&#xD;
cles of furniture; and occasionally the giving way of&#xD;
some hold, which more generally ended in a merry laugh&#xD;
'than the natural 5y. And now she began to notice, and&#xD;
gradually develop the infantile mind. Sweet child! we&#xD;
taught hexdhe old-fashioned but never-worn-out petition&#xD;
&#xD;
of, 'KNOW I lay me down to sleep;" and. years have&#xD;
passed since those lisping accents were repeated, yet they&#xD;
are as audible to me this moment as if just echoed from&#xD;
her voice.&#xD;
When sickness came and assumed a threatening aspect&#xD;
my courage forsook me. My faith (had I any 3) was too&#xD;
weak for nay reliance. I felt she must not die. Had I&#xD;
not a better right to the darling child than her heavenly&#xD;
Father 3 And why was she forced to suffer 3 Innocent&#xD;
and lovely, yet there she lay, racked with pain, fevered,&#xD;
tossing, d~lirious ~ and I was equally so, questioning the&#xD;
Almighty's behest!&#xD;
The third day, Myrtilla died. A transient calmness&#xD;
seized me, as I looked upon features now at rest; yet an&#xD;
agonizing, choking sensation followed, and I would fain&#xD;
have gone with ~her. But whither had she gone 3 Now&#xD;
the awful realities of the unseen world began to dawn upon&#xD;
me. In vain did my friends try to assuage nay anguish,&#xD;
by comforting assurances that "of such were the king-&#xD;
dorn of heaven,"~and that Jesus especially blessed such.&#xD;
My sorrow was selfish: I wanted my treasure back again.&#xD;
For weeks I 4rried about with me a disquieted spirit.&#xD;
I shrank mostly from friendly intercourse, save with those&#xD;
to whom I could detail the uncommon traits of my lost&#xD;
one's character. I could not compose myself to rea~l.&#xD;
Occasionally I would peruse some touching passages in&#xD;
the records of the evangelists, showing me how Jesus&#xD;
sympathized with the mourners; but, alas! I wanted a&#xD;
present Savioiir to restore my child, as was done to the&#xD;
Widow of Nain.&#xD;
I felt myself rebellious and sinful, unreconciled arid&#xD;

&#xD;
dist~'ea#ed; and I waiidered abont, parfonning my nec~s~&#xD;
sary duties, but having no heart in them. Many pious&#xD;
and many worldly friends visited me. One besought n~e~'&#xD;
in the offices of prayer and holy submission to yield to&#xD;
~$Iod's wisdom, who always appoints what is best; while&#xD;
others begged me in the round of gayeties and recrea-&#xD;
tions to try an4 obliterate the past; but I could bear&#xD;
anythingg better than the trial of forgetfulness.&#xD;
There was no sudden change caine over me, which&#xD;
immediately subdued me, and yet there was something&#xD;
wholly distinct from the effacing hand of time iVhieh&#xD;
brought resignation into my heart. I~Iy feelings were&#xD;
gradually softened; my syinpi~thies were quickened; I&#xD;
felt chastened, bu~ not destroyed. A friend of mine&#xD;
begged me to interpret tohitn my experience. I thought&#xD;
it over, and the first distinct beaming of God!s oountenanc&amp;amp;3&#xD;
~ap~n toy stricken soul was iu answer to my first pra~ier.&#xD;
It was a feeble utterance; it was. wrung from my heart&#xD;
after anguished weeks; hut it was sincerely uttered:&#xD;
Father, lead me to understand thy dealings with me."&#xD;
Years passed on, and we were gTh4dened by the birth&#xD;
of five pronuising children. They were l~althy and vig-&#xD;
orous; yet I never felt I had such a~ claim upon them as&#xD;
was preeminently attached to Myrtifla. That chastise-&#xD;
ruent was my first sorrow; and it broke my stubborn&#xD;
heart. It did, indeed, prove a blessing in disguise. I&#xD;
have since often watched by the death-beds of little&#xD;
children; I have witnessed the convulsive agony of pa-&#xD;
rental hearts, and have longed to tell them, that there is&#xD;
relief for such troubled spirits; but the wqrds died upon&#xD;
&#xD;
Yet I dau never tell you all the benefits of my earthly&#xD;
sorrow. ft so wonderfully checked my~reliance on The&#xD;
perishing, and' implanted such a hope in immortality,&#xD;
that, bitter as was the cup, and rehietiintly as Ii drained&#xD;
its bitter, dregs, yet of the fruit of such an experience&#xD;
I would not be dispossessed, could that child have lived&#xD;
to have been to me an earthly ministering angel.&#xD;
" Where your treasure is, there will your heart be&#xD;
also," says Holy Writ; yet I would not think to carry&#xD;
the earthly attachment to a. heavenly state. I fear we&#xD;
become too selfish, too carnal in our desires, to reach that&#xD;
blissful state. I may not recogni2~e my lost child there as&#xD;
once mine; I may not know any of my dearest kindred&#xD;
and loved companion~ of this world; but I trust to Ood's&#xD;
love for that. if I need such helps to make my 'enjoy..&#xD;
merit, undoubtedly they will be furnished. What rnay&#xD;
jiow militant~ against my wishes, I may leave behind ~&#xD;
pith the perishing flesh. I would not ~fix my thoughts&#xD;
on eternity by making it consist of similar pleasures I&#xD;
have knoWn here. Alas! that Christian hearts~ should&#xD;
be so distrustful of a Father's fostering care!&#xD;
We are too prone. to feel that the friends who contrib-&#xD;
uted to our enjoyment here will again rejoin us hero~-&#xD;
after. It is a delightful thought, I well know; bitt who&#xD;
can tell how independent the disembodied soul may be&#xD;
of what made its essential enjoyments while here 'I N~&#xD;

$UJ3$TANCJ3 AND SHADOW~3.&#xD;
&#xD;
PROP~RTY.&#xD;
AcQuxsrrmoN and possession are two very different&#xD;
things, producing very different results. The desire to&#xD;
get seems an instinctive element in many. Indeed, we&#xD;
know not but it is a natural element of our being. Take&#xD;
a glance at life. The little infant first opening his eyes&#xD;
cries for something out of his reach; the blaze of a can~&#xD;
dIe arrests his attention, and he would Lain put his tiny&#xD;
angers in the brilliant light. Childhood is just as grasp-&#xD;
ing. The boy begs for his kite, his marbles, and various&#xD;
playthings, which, when obtained, fail to satisfy. There&#xD;
is always some other lad who has a coveted treasur9.&#xD;
The youth of sixteen longs to feel he is no more a minoi',&#xD;
and boasts what he will do when that period arrives.&#xD;
The man lo~ks out from his busy store, and hears of the&#xD;
retired cottage, and sighs for ease amidst luxurious&#xD;
indulgence, where the irritating bustle of trade will no&#xD;
more reach him. The man of retirement feels a vacuity,&#xD;
and* wonders why, as he ranges ever his elegant man-&#xD;
sion and his gravelled walks, so little enjoyment attends&#xD;
the acquisitions; and old age, still tenacious of life,&#xD;
recounts the exploits of an early period, dwells on the&#xD;
changes ~f society, and, when not solaced by the prospect&#xD;
of a heavenly home, tightly clings to itB earthly posses-&#xD;
&#xD;
sions, and even mourns that so little time is left to hold&#xD;
on to present acquisitions. The desire, nay, even the&#xD;
struggle to attain, seems to be the period of the greatest&#xD;
enjoyment.&#xD;
A friend invited one of his companions to visit him, and&#xD;
promised to show him the beauty of his garden, the&#xD;
varieties of trees, the shrubbery and green-house, where&#xD;
so many rare plants ~irere deposited. He accepted; and,&#xD;
having surveyed the beautiful enclQsure, and feasted his&#xD;
eyes upon all it contained, as lie turned away from&#xD;
beholding it, he bowed, and said, "I thank you."&#xD;
"For what'?" asked his friend; "surely you have had&#xD;
nothing yet demanding gratitude." "I think difir~..&#xD;
ently," replied the friend. "I have gazed upon all,&#xD;
which has cost you so much money and anxiety, for&#xD;
nothingg, and have been about as much benefited as your-&#xD;
self; for, after all, you can do no more than look upon&#xD;
these things."&#xD;
It does not necessarily follow that the man in posses-&#xD;
sion of his million must be unhappy. If he is indolent,&#xD;
he will undoubtedly be so; but, if his mind is active, of&#xD;
course his hands will be often employed, and the ennui&#xD;
which attends repletion will not be his Late. Why is it&#xD;
that the poor and middling classes so often envy the rich ~&#xD;
Certainly these people have the advantage of fortune's&#xD;
favorites. A gentleman who owned a valuable hQr~e&#xD;
once remarked that his ~rooni took the most pleasure&#xD;
with him. said he, "I am always fearful when I drive&#xD;
him that he will be lamed, or when I stop at a hotel that&#xD;
he will not be properly attended. My~ servant has no&#xD;
sue~i fears. He. drives him at will; whistles as he goes;&#xD;

f4zlds r~d trouble in his possessions.&#xD;
Yen may call these trials small tries, unworthy&#xD;

ettp4s the getting a spur which urges us to make&#xD;

t~itur~ will remunerate us, for all present discourage-&#xD;

THE CAST-OUT EVERGREEN.&#xD;
IN a tangled wild-wood there grew a luxuriant ever-&#xD;
green. It had taken root in the damp earth beneath a&#xD;
clump of 'dried leaves. But gradually it peeped forth,&#xD;
and, throwing its feeble tendrils around the scattered and&#xD;
decayed bi~anches which autumnal and wintry winds had&#xD;
thickly strewed ar~nnd, it entwined itself by such sup~&#xD;
porting embraces, until it reached a trailing length; and&#xD;
assumed a brilliant verdancy, which made it a conspicuous&#xD;
beauty among the dried shrubbery and mouldering foliage&#xD;
~hich encompassed it. And there for years, it may be,&#xD;
it had grown unobserved. Even the bright rays ~f the&#xD;
sun but scantily and slantingly shone in upon its branch-&#xD;
9&#xD;
ing progress"; for, among the majestic oaks and stately&#xD;
pine-trees, the eclipse which fell' upon the evergreen Vras&#xD;
sometimes almost total. Yet it ki~ew no ~tint, no fading&#xD;
* hue; and no rude footsteps had ever trampled upon' it.&#xD;
In its obscurity it seemed to obey o~e of the great' laws&#xD;
of nature, and silently to 'live on with increasing beauty&#xD;
and 'strength. At e~rery "few paces ~a livid green sh6t&#xD;
out, more ~tender and beatitiful than others with ~which' it&#xD;
claimed affinity, and thus an added bea~ity Was given by&#xD;
its changing colors.&#xD;
But erelong footsteps are heard' in this sacred '*brest.&#xD;

Over briers and brambles, over underbrush and rubbish,&#xD;
the pursuit is urged, and the lovely evergreen is at length&#xD;
~espied in the tramp. The fatal knife soon severed it from&#xD;
its damp root. Gently was it untwisted from its support-&#xD;
lug holds, and through many a gap, and over many a&#xD;
wild and thorny bush,. had it extended itself. It was in-&#xD;
deed hailed by the gleaners as a rare treasure, and care..&#xD;
fully and faithfully was it twined in a broad receptacle,&#xD;
which was designed toenclose many of its kindred; for the&#xD;
Christmas holidays were approaching, and this undying&#xD;
evergreen was to be woven in a ohaplet as an emblem of&#xD;
the Christian faith.&#xD;
Its destination was in a stately mansion, and the prep~&#xD;
~ration was in view of scenes of festivity and joy. By&#xD;
maiden fingers it was rounded and arranged with more&#xD;
perisha1A~e wild flowers, and hung in the splendid draw-&#xD;
ing-room windows. Here was an emblem of life contr~ted&#xD;
with a dreary prospectt without; but it was a new. life to&#xD;
the vine which had been cradled amidst alternate snows&#xD;
and scanty sunshine. In its strange atmosphere a radiant&#xD;
glar~ of light always beamed upon it. When the setting&#xD;
~un would have left it in its native darkness, the brilliant&#xD;
artificial light shone quite as strongly upon it. And&#xD;
theii only a frosty window-pane lent it any damp and&#xD;
refreshing aid to save it from decay; for, amidst the&#xD;
heated drawing-rooms where mirth and music were keep-&#xD;
ing time, there was no absence of a blighting heat which&#xD;
withered both anim~te and inanimate things. Yet for&#xD;
twenty successive holidays did this evergreen maintain&#xD;
its position. The wild flowers which were llrst put&#xD;
betw~er~ it were long since perished, aa~d a decaying&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
beauty 'was nOW resting upon the evergreen. it twisted&#xD;
itself; and grew rusty and fading. But it had answered&#xD;
it5 purpose it had maintained its place as long as the&#xD;
festive season lasted, and then the window which con-&#xD;
tained it was suddenly thrown up, and the chaplet was&#xD;
thrown among other rubbish into the street!&#xD;
As with quiet gaze I looked upon it, I too saw an em-&#xD;
blem of worldly friendships. It was no more suggestive&#xD;
of Christian faith; for the place it now occupied was but&#xD;
an emblem of fallen greatness, of short-lived remem-&#xD;
brances, and of cast-off beauty. And while I moralized,&#xD;
a little tattered beggar picked up the relic, and with her&#xD;
oold and benumbed fingers sought to plane it around the&#xD;
crown of her bruised and faded bonnet. Then with a&#xD;
lightsome tread she made her way to yonder attic, where&#xD;
the~ puny baby tore it in pieces upon the cold hearthstone.&#xD;
Thus ended the cast-off evergreen!&#xD;
Shall I weaken your impression, kind reader, by an&#xD;
analogous picture ~? Have you never seen the protected&#xD;
child growing up amidst sikn~t influences, maturing year&#xD;
by year in a steady growth - the pride of parental fos-&#xD;
tering, throwing out the tendrils of affection, dreaming&#xD;
only of merry days, while the soft waters went murmur-&#xD;
ing by, and in their placid; unruffled flow seemed to&#xD;
image only the innocent thoughts and face of him who&#xD;
stood upon the brink of the stream ~ By and by comes&#xD;
a rough breeze, and the image is no longer reflected.&#xD;
The world has called him out of that peaceful home, and&#xD;
he mingles in a new and heated atmosphere. For a time&#xD;
he is~ unmindful vhM he has severed the root from which&#xD;
~ie drew his healthful nutriment. He phinges nt9 the&#xD;

~strangegiare of brilliant and festive Ii%. He lives in&#xD;
~n excited and pestilential miasma. By slow degrees&#xD;
hi~ ~mera1 principles are undermined; he is enfeebled,&#xD;
perhaps bloated, perchance fevered, with the association.&#xD;
But, alas, he has withered at the root, and men cast him&#xD;
out like the worthless evergreen!&#xD;
Is it not so with the devotee at fashion's shrine? So&#xD;
long as with princely fortune one gives and returns the&#xD;
merry dance, and provides sumptuously at the festive&#xD;
board, is he not sought, caressed and flattered? But&#xD;
remove the gilded show which his ample fortune sup-&#xD;
plies; let him now buffet the fierce gales which only&#xD;
plunge him stiSl deeper in the dark shades of poverty,&#xD;
and is he not, too, "cast off" as the evergreen?&#xD;
Alas, that man should be rigid and cold with his bro-&#xD;
other, even as nature with her rough winds and fearful&#xD;
tornadoes, which sometimes destrQy the richest treas-&#xD;
ures! The little wild-flower, that grows so comely in its&#xD;
silent retreat, untouched by 'foreign hands, puts forth its&#xD;
tender branches and shuns the vulgar eye, content to&#xD;
bloom in some guardian shade. 4'he morning and even-&#xD;
ing sun smile upon it; its honeyed blossoms scent the&#xD;
dese4 air; but the unpitying frosts of autumn leave no&#xD;
vestige of th~ flower. It came from nothing, and to&#xD;
nothing it has returned!&#xD;
But here my analogy fails. We are born into an&#xD;
endless life, and if we. suffer ourselves through our own&#xD;
misconduct to be "cast off" we cannot smother or anni-&#xD;
hilate our life. Consciousness, once awakened, never dies.&#xD;
But if, by adherence to the firm root of~ principle, we&#xD;
fearlessly tread life's thorny passages, and find ourselves&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"cast out" in the conflict, no whirlwind or earthquake&#xD;
can destroy the germinating principle; for, unlike the&#xD;
frail duration of the flower, or the decay of the ever~&#xD;
green, we~ shall yet ripen beneath a more congenial sky,&#xD;
under the guardianship and ~unshne of a Father's prom&#xD;

TILE WELL-ORDERED HOUSE.&#xD;
Mv friend has been two years building a house, in&#xD;
order to surround himself with every convenience and&#xD;
comfort that can possibly be brought within his range.&#xD;
It is just completed, and is pronounced a perfect model.&#xD;
The most exquisite taste is now being displayed in tbe&#xD;
furniture. He has impor~4 the finest specimens of mar-&#xD;
ble busts, the most antique vases, and some of the rarest&#xD;
Specimens of paintings which an Italian artist could bring&#xD;
out on canvas. And, when the whole shall be completed,&#xD;
he intends to invite a numerous party of friends to inspect&#xD;
it; for he is a little vain of the perfect specimen he is.&#xD;
thus enabled to exhibit.&#xD;
Yet, after all, my friend is not a good householder. The.&#xD;
splendid out-building which holds his body has furnished&#xD;
him with no suitable apartment, well fitted up, to hold that&#xD;
invisible mind which is still vacant, or filled with a thou-&#xD;
sand fancies which make him in a constant st~fte of unrest.&#xD;
He, therefore, walks his splendid halls, and traverses his&#xD;
magnificent drawing-rooms, where the mirrors only reflect&#xD;
his discontented countenance, and the wan, haggard, look&#xD;
of despair. Evidently, he is still in a dilapidated Btate;&#xD;
the real tenement in which he lives is suffering for want&#xD;
of repairs. There are a thousand vexatioui disquievudes,&#xD;
&#xD;
~hi~h this outside show does not remove; vacant chain-&#xD;
hers, which need to be furnished; large spare rooms,&#xD;
that need to be brushed an&amp;amp; ventilated, and set in order,&#xD;
for the guests that temporarily reside there.&#xD;
The poor man, upon whom he has just bestowed his&#xD;
alms, looks somewhat puzzled to interpret that despairing&#xD;
glance ~he cast towards him; he is at a loss, moreover, to&#xD;
interpret the strange ordering of Providence in these&#xD;
seeming inequalities of condition. "With that house,&#xD;
those luxurious couches, servants to do his bidding,&#xD;
plenty of money wherewith to anticipate every want," the&#xD;
poor man queries, "why does he not look more like a&#xD;
happy man 3" He turns away from that massive granite&#xD;
dwelling, and down in yonder alley he carries the dollar&#xD;
just given him, and distributes its avails among a swarm&#xD;
of hungry children with whom he lodges. They are not&#xD;
his own ;~ but the feeling of pity inspired him this morn-&#xD;
ing to beg in his own name for them. The food is pro-&#xD;
cured; and~ those faces, which hunger has made lean and&#xD;
wan, now brighten with gratitude, and they bless .the&#xD;
kind old man who was so thoughtful as to give them this&#xD;
bountiful breakfast. This blessing sends a thrill of trans-&#xD;
port through an infinite number of fibres,~ whioh lights up&#xD;
the love in his heart, and makes him the happiest bene-&#xD;
factor in the world. They all eat their meal together,&#xD;
and sunshine plays around the 2~board. There are merri-&#xD;
ment and jocund hilarity; and the youngest climbs his&#xD;
* knee, and repeats her little hymn of gratitude.&#xD;
The rich man took his meal alone. There was a ser~&#xD;
vice of silver upon his table; the smoking Mocha was&#xD;

prey to such sad forebodings; why life had lost all its&#xD;
sweetness, and he should thus fall a wreck within his&#xD;
marble palace. Evide~tIy he had taken better care of&#xD;
his outward tenement than~ of that within. One half the&#xD;
attention paid to regulating his idle fancies, to forgetful-&#xD;
ness of self in some eflbrt to relieve another, together&#xD;
with a cultivation of those ~social qualities which would&#xD;
gladden his heart, would have made him what he so ear~&#xD;
nestly desires to be, namely, a happy man.&#xD;
And so people look on and condemn riches as the. bane&#xD;
of personal enjoyment in many instances; as hardening the&#xD;
heart, and making people morose and churlish. it is not&#xD;
the mine of gold which necessarily produces this result;&#xD;
buf rather, in our efforts to amass it, we so neglect the&#xD;
interior condition of our dwelling, as to be incapable of&#xD;
afterwards enjoying ourselv-es when most ready to do so.&#xD;
I have a friend, too, who is not a good housekeeper.&#xD;
Her home is the abode of neatness' and precision. A&#xD;
single cobweb could not be found in all her house. 'Slie&#xD;
is. forever reiirranging,, remodelling, and beautifying her&#xD;
external condition.; yet she has great unrest within. A&#xD;
petty vexation, a small, anxiety, may so ruffle her feelings,&#xD;
that in that capacious and welbordered dwelling there&#xD;
shall be no inward peace for the day. Plainly, trifles&#xD;
ha~e a~quir~d~ sueh &amp;amp;swqover hor feelings, ~that he&#xD;
&#xD;
unable to rise above them. You c&amp;amp;~ trace that assumed&#xD;
cheerfulness; beneath it lies a world of harassing thoughts,&#xD;
and a disquietude with which her friends may be familiar;&#xD;
but th~y can never know its hidden depth. Life to her&#xD;
is all a cloud; there is a painful intensity in living. The&#xD;
enjoyment which her ample means might furnish is rare-&#xD;
ly felt, simply because she has never removed the cob-&#xD;
webs and dust which have so frightfully accumulated&#xD;
within. Had the mifroz~ which so often reflected her&#xD;
varied apparel but shown hem~the deformity within; had&#xD;
that small beginning of indulgence in an ill-tempered&#xD;
thought been subdued; had that wayward fancy been&#xD;
subjugated a~d controlled by reason; in one word, had&#xD;
she sought for strength from above to enable her to com-&#xD;
bat successfully with these inward foes, undoubtedly she&#xD;
might have become as efficient an interior housekeeper as&#xD;
she is now an outward one&#xD;
Alas for us that we know ourselves so imperfectly!&#xD;
W&amp;amp; talk about being "intimately acquainted with our&#xD;
friends ;" we analyze their motives, and pass judgment&#xD;
upon their actions; but what in truth do we know of our&#xD;
"own interior I{f'e"? And, yet, it is this which makes&#xD;
all our world; our whole prosperity centres k~re. There&#xD;
would be much more significance in our inquiring after&#xD;
the prosperity of the soul, than the health of the body.&#xD;
Indeed, the former quite frequently determines the state&#xD;
of the latter. So that, merely in a selfish view, to become&#xD;
happy and well, it behooves us to regulate our interior&#xD;
dwelling.&#xD;
Take, for example, the dyspeptic man or woman. Y~u&#xD;
may compound for them all the drugs in tho~ I&#xD;

voeabulary; but, with that mind "ill at ease," you can&#xD;

spiritual food. We crave that nutrient, and yet vainly,&#xD;

quest of ~ocial intercourse, ~r shut ourselves in. well-stored&#xD;
libraries. Yet watch yourself; my friend, when ~all these&#xD;
allurements have ceased, and you are alone with yourself.&#xD;
What is the foundation of your future hopes 3 You have&#xD;
plans for coming time, unquestionably; but do they not&#xD;
all take hold 6f unsubstantial enjoyments? The partial&#xD;
deception may gloss, over your real needs for a brief&#xD;

SUBSTANCE AND SHADOWS.        SIT&#xD;
&#xD;
IN A "WORRY."&#xD;
SoMe people seem only to worr~, out existence. They&#xD;
have all external means of enjoyment, yet they are never&#xD;
at ease. A lady of this character, with ability to pro-&#xD;
cure 'herself every 4~utward enjoyment, was lately con-&#xD;
gratulated upon her freedom from all vexatious and&#xD;
annoying trials. "Why," said she, "I 'in full of trouble.&#xD;
I am always in a 'worry' about 'Isaac;' when he returns&#xD;
from sea I can enjoy nothing, because I know he is going&#xD;
a ; when he is ~t sea, I am always expecting to hear&#xD;
he is dead, or cast on some desolate island." Yet "Isaac"&#xD;
was not her husband, but an adopted nephew, upon whom&#xD;
so much sympathy was lavished.&#xD;
Another friend I could name is always tried, or&#xD;
"worried," with her domestic troubles. "Bridget got&#xD;
up late," or "Ketty goes out too often," or "Ned is&#xD;
becoming a careless driver ;" and, between seeking com-&#xD;
fort and finding it, life becomes a very wearisome aflidr,&#xD;
arid is entirely fretted away in relating troubles that have&#xD;
been lived over. What a pity it is that we are so forget-&#xD;
ful of the laws of inward peace as to brood over the ~past,&#xD;
talk about its evils, and thus make them ever preset!&#xD;
Then, there is another class who are always "worried"&#xD;
about w~hat no human foresight can prevent. An east&#xD;
wind, a hot day, a sudden shower, a dense fog, or a heavy&#xD;
&#xD;
dew, all alike vex them. Allowing such things to prey&#xD;
on the spirits, makes us very disagreeable companions.&#xD;
Who would select such a one for a travelling friend ~?&#xD;
Who would take~ such a one for hfe? When a man&#xD;
considers how mt~h his comfort, is concerned with a wife's&#xD;
temper,- how she leads him through life's rough places,&#xD;
with a violent or gentle hand,-before he chooses his future&#xD;
destiny, let him consider. The embryo of the ~woman is&#xD;
often seen in the child. Petulaflt, ungovernable, indulged&#xD;
children do not always rise above the natural propensities&#xD;
of early years when they arrive at womanhood; neither&#xD;
does the surly, rough lad, often become the agreeable&#xD;
gentleman. Yet, upon the disposition to meet the every.&#xD;
day discipline of life, depends all our enjoyment. A calm,'&#xD;
trusting spirit, a forbearing, hopeful temper, a county~&#xD;
nance where smiles ~redoininate,- who would fear to unite&#xD;
with such a one ~I The happiest effect upon a whole life&#xD;
often follows a well-matched pair. The mild and amiable&#xD;
graces will blunt the rough edges and the awkward man~&#xD;
ners of one nearest our hearts; for the magic influence of&#xD;
sympathy is electric, and assimilation often produces the&#xD;
admirable traits we come in contact with, and a likeness&#xD;
is imperceptibly stamped upon th~ character. It has&#xD;
been said (I know not how truly), that gaming upon the&#xD;
benign expression of the portrait of a deceased 'and be.&#xD;
loved friend, will, in time, produce a calm and serene&#xD;
expression upon the gazer; so indelible is the stamp,&#xD;
that the soul of our friend becomes mirrored in our own~&#xD;
Away, then, with "worrying," fretting trifles; they&#xD;
mar the beauty of the huzn~u ~ea, and eat, like&#xD;
canker, into the soul&#xD;

TILE FADED LEAF.&#xD;
IT was Qnly a leaf wifich riveted my attention, a&#xD;
dried, 'sere, yellow leaf! It fell from yonder tree, whose&#xD;
luxuriant shade had so softened and mellowed the bright&#xD;
rays of the morning sun, 'during the hot and sultry days&#xD;
of znidsumnier. lit ni~de but one of the thousand 'which&#xD;
had helped to form the deep shadow, and it was the first&#xD;
to falt; yet it seemed possessed of a restless activity,&#xD;
now it had dropped from its former companions. The&#xD;
/&#xD;
slightest wind wafted it under busy feet; anon it rose&#xD;
again, as a higher gust came;~ then it whirled along the&#xD;
thronged Street down the shallow ravine; and, after flut-&#xD;
tering and dancing like a 'thing of joyous life, it was&#xD;
b6rne into the watery current ~and floated down the nar-&#xD;
rQw streani into' a vast reservoir, where it disappeared&#xD;
forever!&#xD;
Just after the 'fall of the leaf; I missed hundreds of&#xD;
its' companions; at length they all disappeared, and only&#xD;
the bare branches and b~irren~trunk stood, tuiclothed and&#xD;
unsh4ltered, alone! Nature, as if prodigal ~f her moni-&#xD;
ti~ns, put on a sterner countenance; and chilly winds and&#xD;
clouded 'skieB, ~ahd' heavy 'storizis, succeeded;. soAbat&#xD;

SUBSTANCE AND SHADOWS.&#xD;
and, added W these, came an inscrutable dispensation&#xD;
of Providence. In yonder apartment was the friend of&#xD;
my summer hours, who had stood with me beneath ~the&#xD;
spreading foliage of the desolate tree, and she too was&#xD;
smitten by a sudden disease, which caused her to wither&#xD;
like the frail leaf. Many tendrils of affection were en~&#xD;
twined around her; loving hearts and ministering hands&#xD;
were there; but the common decree, that causes the leaf'&#xD;
to fall, had likewise been passed upon her. She too&#xD;
faded, withered, and fell. We bore her to her last re~t~&#xD;
ing-place among the rustling leaves and tall branches&#xD;
of desolate trees, and, with a few clods of earth; we.&#xD;
raised a mound, under which she securely sleeps. And&#xD;
where was the &amp;amp;pirit, with its unceasing activity, as it&#xD;
floated down the current oi~' life'? Did it wander, like the&#xD;
leaf, void of OQmpaflioflship, till it plunged into a ~vast&#xD;
abyss, and there met its fhial e~tinction't lit could not&#xD;
answer me on~ of the thousand queries which I would&#xD;
fain know. But nature ag~dn spake; that leafless tree&#xD;
was oniy preparing itself; by stripping its foliage, for i'~,&#xD;
greener dress and more luxuriant shade; its branches wer~~&#xD;
resting awhile, to expand and strengthen themselves, and&#xD;
reappear in still more beauteous attire; This seeming&#xD;
decay was not, then, real; the going away bf my friend&#xD;
was only a preparation for higher life. "But why,"&#xD;
said a lovely form, that gently whispered in my ear, and&#xD;
whom I knew to be an angel, "why gatberest thou tiky&#xD;
strength from the decaying, restless monuments of nature&#xD;
alone '~ Hast thou no higher revelation of the God of&#xD;
nature 3 Has he not sent a messenger to dissipate tire&#xD;

the corruptible should put on immortality by this apparent&#xD;
death 'I That spirit is now surrounded by ministering&#xD;
angels, and, having been welcomed by its Saviour into un~&#xD;
known regions of delight, after feasting awhile amidst&#xD;
'the seraphic joys of its new existence, will have a mission&#xD;

u~efui, beneficial activity on earth, peculiarly trained that&#xD;
soixl for its celestial employment in heaven. Thy friezid&#xD;
is still near thee; heaven i~ no distant place." And while&#xD;
I listened and wondered, the spirit fled, and my gaze was&#xD;
only fixed~ upon a little white speck of cloud, wherein the&#xD;
vision entered and passed away forever. ~So Nature was&#xD;
swallowed up in Revelation, and I went on my way cheer~&#xD;
fully, but thoughtfully; for I knew that in a little time&#xD;
a greater company would be gathered,. and the tendrils&#xD;
which now clustered around my heart would be broken,&#xD;
and I, too, should long to join in the blessed society.&#xD;
Then I, was glad the leaf had fallen, and I murmured&#xD;
no longer that my friend had departed; for Nature and&#xD;
Revelation were but handniaids to each other, and both&#xD;
spake by the same great teacher, Death.&#xD;
