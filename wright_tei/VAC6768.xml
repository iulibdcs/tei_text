Go, little book, I send thee forth With many an anxious thought; Oh, let thy snowy pages bear The gems I long have sought.

AMONG the multiplicty of books and authors that present themselves to us in this age of letters, none should be so acceptable to the public ear as those ornate with the varied tints of romance and poesy engendering in the minds of the young a pure, ealth- ful, and genuine virtue, anid awakenincg the adult to a culture of those powers anti faculties, which have for their object the glorious exaltation of our imper. - feet natures. Yet, so eager are we to follow fancy in her airy flight, and to catch her sweet inspiration, that the qualities of the author, and his disposition to foster those tendencies, are seldom or never taken into ac- count. Our notions of men are generally based upon their works; and the opinions which the young    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6768-00000006"/> 10      2ARCADIAN LEAVES. form of the world in whose interests and conceri tlhey are about to participate, are founded on the e: perience of tlhose gone before them. How importar then, that the tutor should feel it his incumbent dn to place in the hands of his pupil, works, who perusal would en:able him to cope with its danger and to ascend, one 1by one, the steps of fame unst lied, until he gains the top, from which he may b hold a bright and glorious inheritance beyond; u like the prophet of old, who, from Pisgalh's top, b held the fair land wlose fragrant precincts he w never permitted to enter. It is with this intent i cheerfully subscribe to the beauties of the lit volunme now before us. TI'ink, gentle reader, as you speak of these p: ductions, and judge of their merits-oh! think the grateful heart you gladden by your kind a liberal Ipatronage. The writer of this little work lost her sight at age of nine years. Her last view of this beauti earth was the scenery of Staten Island, where esided at that time.   f?57::    ARCADIAN LEAVES. After strugrling with adversity for several years, and all hope of recovering her sight had flown, she entered the New-York Institution for tie Blind in 1837, from which she graduated in 1844 with its highest hlonos.  Since then, her life has not been one of ecase, of sunshine, and song; but where others have found the rose, hers has been the scentless thorn. Her condition is truthfully portrayed in the expressive lines of one of 'her own class Wide o'er my prospect rueful darkness breathes Her inauspicious vapor; in whose shade, Fear, grief, and anguish, natives of her reign, In social sadness gloomy vigils keep; With them I walk, with them still doomed to share Eternal blackness, without hope, of dawn." Soon after her term  of puplage expired at t Institution, the death of her kind father added a new s sorrow to her condition. Many of our readers will doubtless remember that, in '49, the author pub- lished a neat little Volume entitled ", Poems by Alice Holmes," which was favorably received by the people; and she fondly hopes that these pages J. ..    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6768-00000007"/> 12      ARCADIAN LEAVES.  may meet with a like reception, by an intelligent and liberal public. Miss Holmes does not issue this little volume with the hope of hlanding down her name to distant pos-  tcrity, or with a view to literary honor; but with  the laudable desire of avoiding a dependency, so re-  pulsive to an active and sensitive mind.   ARCADIAN LEAYES.       13 EVA; 01, THE BSIKET OF WILD FLOWERS. "My poor, poor Ea!" said Mrs. Wentworth, fix- ing her large dark eyes, with an expression of anxious solicitude, on the frail form of a delicate child, who sat busily employed in arranging some beautiful wild flowers she had just been gathering. Having completed her task, she arose, and, gliding noiselessly to the bedside of her mother, bent down, and imprinting a kiss upon her cheek, said, in a gentle tone, "Good bye, Mamma; I'll be back soon. Don't cit ' she continued, winding her arms tenderly about her mother's neck. "Let us learn to put our -trust in Him who has promised to be the widow's guard, and a father to the fatherless. I know He has heard my prayer, and will help me to dispose of my basket of flowers; and with a few shillings thus 1*    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6768-00000008"/> L4      ARCCADIAN LIEAVES. earned, I slhall be able to bring lomeo something to  nourishl ald strengthen you."           . ' But your own health, Eva?" replied Mrs.   : Wentworth. "Remcmber you llave tasted nothina since yestcrmorn, and I fear your limbs are too weak to sustain you, even should you meet with the  success you anticipate."  "Xever mind me, dear mother," answered the  child, and with a light step, she bounded gaily from the room, .and descending the brolcn staircase, soon j found herself beneath the broad blue sky-her young [ heart bounding with the hopes which her own bright ; fancy had woven, and which were pure and guile- less, as the innocent flowers that lay smiling in her own tiny basket. ' leaven blees thee, my own darling!" ejaculated Mrs Wentworth, as the last echo of her receding footsteps died upon her ear. Then closing her eyes, she sank into one of those pleasing reveries, that sometimes visit the weary and care-worn; and her thoughts went back to the home of her early youth. Again, she beheld the cheerful fire blazing on the   ARCADIAN LEAVES.       15 hearth. and the little group who were wont to as- semble at eve around the family altar. Again, she looked upon the gray hairs of her venerable sire, as he opened the inspired volume, and from its sacred pages read the sweet message of redeeming love. In the midst of this happy picture, the door softly opened, and Mr. Vincent, the clergyman, entered. For many years, this amiable and excellent man had been a faithful and devoted servant of his Divine Master, in private as well as in public. He labored earnestly to inculcate the precepts held out by the doctrines of the Church; and those opposed to him in religious faith could not but admit that his life was that of an humble, and self-denying Christian. In the abodes of wretchedness and want, by the bedside of the sick and the dying, he was ever found, patiently adrninistering to their necessities, pouring the balm of consolation into their wounded bosoms, or lealding the wanderer to Him, who, is ever ready to receive the returning prodigal. Mrs. Wentworth, by whom   his visits were al- ways regard as sources of peculiar comfort, felt on his occasion that his presence was doubly welcome.    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6768-00000009"/> 16       ARCADIAN LTEAVES. For several weeks, she had experienced, the most acute suffering. Her strength was rapidly decreas- ing, and she realized that ere long she must bid farewell to earth, and lie down in the cold and silent tomb. In the course of their conversation, 'Mr. Vincent, alluding to the many trials and difficulties through which, in the providence of God, she had been called to pass, ventured to ask whether, under all these af- flicting circumstances, she could say in the spirit of meekness, "Thy will be done." ( Yes," replied the invalid. "Trials make the promise sweet-  Trials give new life to prayer;  Bring me to my Saviour's feet, Lay me low and keep me there." "Then," continued the clergyman, " should it please God to call you from this world, have you any fears with reference to your acceptance with Him?" "None," she answered.   "There is but one thing that troubles me. My solicitude for the wel- I   ARCIADIAND LEAVES.     17 fare of my child sometimes makes me feel an earn- est desire to struggle on a little longer." "If this be your only source of anxiety," said Mr. Vincent, "it shall speedily be removed. , Eva shall be tenderly cared for. I have no children, and she shall find in me a father and a friend." Mrs. Wentworth attempted to express her grati- tude, but a gush of tears choked her utterance. At this moment, Eva came bounding into the room, her countenance glowing with animation, while she held up to the astonished gaze of her mother a gold coin, which she said had been given her by a kind gentle- man to whom she had sold her flowers. "And what do you think, mamma?" she continued, throw- ing back the flaxen curls that shaded her fair brow, "when I told him my name, and that I had  a mother who was ill, he sighed, and said something about coming to see us, which I did not quite under- stand." Mr. Vincent soon after took his leave, promising to call on the following morning, and it had been mutually agreed to say nothing to Eva on the subject of her future home.    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6768-00000010"/> 18       ARCADIAN LEAVES. Charles Wentworth was the only son of a wealthy merchant, residing in a flourishing town some few miles distant from the city of Boston. When only fifteen years of age, he evinced so strong a predilection for the sea, that his father, willing to gratify his desire, and thinking that a single voyage would be sufficient to cool his enthu- siasm, allowed him to embark with an intimate friend in a vessel bound for Liverpool. This voyage, however, decided his future course. At the early age of nineteen, le married Lucy Gray, a young and beautiful girl, to whom he was devotedly attached, and who, it was fondly hoped, would induce him to change his mode of life, for the more quiet scenes of domestic enjoyment. Soon after the birth of Eva, ha received the com- mand of'a vessel bound for India. Two years sub- sequent, a rumor was circulated that the vessel had been wrecked during a violent storm, and that he, together with most of the crew, was lost. This melancholy disaster proved a death-blow to the elder Wentworth. A short time previous, he   ARCADIAN LEAVES.        19 sustained a heavy loss, in consequence of specula- tion, in which he had become seriously involved; and at his decease, his family were left in circum- i stances of utter destitution. After a series of mis- fortunes, Mrs. Wentworth removed to Boston, , where, by the aid of her needle, she succeeded in obtaining a comfortable support for herself and  child. But the constant fatigue to which she was neces- sarily subjected, tended to undermine her constitu- tion-naturally delicate-and, ere long, her languid step and pale cheek told that disease had begun its fearful work. Eva had by this time completed her tenth year. I-Her quick eye was not long in detecting the altered i appearance of her mother; and young as she was I she determined to devise some means by which to alleviate her condition. That very evening, on her return from the parsonage, her attention was at- : tracted by a child about her own age carrying a basket, in which were some rosebuds and delicate orange-blossoms. 6; Where are you going?" she    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6768-00000011"/> 20      ARCADIAN LEAVES. asked. "There," answered the child, pointing to a splendid edifice on the opposite side of the street; "and I must make haste, or Miss Ellen will think I am not coming." This trifling incident suggested a plan which Eva determined to put into immediate execution. Early on the following morning, she arose from her couch: and, stealing quietly from the room, directed her steps to a small grove, where she soon collected a variety of choice flowers. Having tastefully arranged them into chaplets and nosegays, she placed them in a basket, and went forth on her errand of love. The success which attended her first effort induced her to repeat the experiment. Thus she continued, till the time of her introduction to the reader, when she encountered the mysterious stranger, whose singular benevolence overwhelmed her with gratitude, and gave a new impulse to her ambition. Hardly had she seated herself to partake of the plentiful repast, which her good fortune had enabled her to provide, when a slight tap was heard, and a tall, handsome figure, neatly attired, entered the apartment. Eva sprang to his side, and, taking P   ARBCADIAN LEAVES,      21 I his hand, said timidly, "Mamma, here is the gentle- E man who was so kind to us this morning." i  For a single instant7 the eyes of Mrs. Wentworth i were riveted on those of the stranger. Then clasp- ing her hands, she exclaimed convulsively, "My i own, my beloved husband! I little thought to see thy face in this world; but God is merciful; the dead is alive, and the lost is restored to me again!" We shall not attempt to describe the emotions of Captain Wentworth at this unexpected recognition on the part of his wife, or the joy of little Eva, when told that the kind gentleman was no other than her own dear papa. A few words sufficed to explain the cause of his long absence. After the wreck of the ill-fated vessel, he was rescued from his perilous condition by a ship belonging to Portugal. On arriving at Lisbon, he found himself almost without the means of subsistence, and he at once formed the resolution of retrieving his fortune ere he should again visit his native land. To this end, he labored sedulously for many years. At length the palm was won; the great object of his life was 2    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6768-00000012"/> 22      ARCADIAN LEtAVES. accomplished, and he had come home to end his days in the bosom of his family. Mr. Vincent soon joined the happy circle, and a song of praise went up like incense to the throne of God. It was now mid-summer, and when autumn came. and the flowers drooped, a voice was heard like the low breathings of an angel's harp, and the soul of Mrs. Wentworth plumed its ethereal wings and went home to that rest that remains for the finally faithful. Mr. Vincent followed the bereaved husband and child to the little churchyard; and as he read those solemn and impressive words, "I am the resurrection and the life," the sacred relics of the dead were laid in their last resting place. Eva never forgot her mother; but as she grew up, she endeavored to walk in her footsteps, and imitate her example. Captain Wentworth lived to see his daughter united in marriage to an industrious tradesman of Boston, and then passed tranquilly away to that world where the spirit of his beloved Lucy had gone before him.

When around the festive board, brother, We gather to good cheer, How my sad heart will ache, brother, To see thy vacant chair!

ST LUKE, CHAP, II., VER. 8-15. 'TWAS midnight. All was locked in dreamy sleep; 1 The sky was cloudless, and the golden stars Circled the brow of their celestial queen, Whose silver beams illum'd the tranquil earth. No sound disturbed the stillness of the air, Save the low murmur of a winding stream, And the soft whisper of a gentle breeze That o'er the dewy grass its perfume shed. Such was the hour, so lovely, calm, serene, When, to the shepherds, who, on Judah's plain, By night, did watch their flocks with tender care,    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6768-00000016"/> 30       ARCADIAN IAVES. Behold! the angel of the Lord appear'd, And God's transcendent glory shone around, Which filled their trembling souls with fear. Be not afraid," the shining angel said, AWhose dove-like wings were bathed in silver light; "Glad tidings of great joy to you I bring. To you in Bethlehem, this day, is born Of David's line a Saviour, Christ, the Lord, Who is the everlasting Prince of peace. And this shall be a sign a lovely babe You there shall find, who, wrap'd in swathing bands, Is with his mother in a manger laid." He touched his golden harp, and lo! with him Appeared a multitude of seraphs bright, Who with their sweet harmonious voices say, "Good-will henceforth and peace to man below I And glory in the highest, be ascribed To Him, who sits on Heaven's eternal throne!" They ceased, and on their starry pinions sped To realms of light, in that celestial sphere Where, day and night, low bending at Ills throne, Angels and high archangels join their songs, And to Jehovah's name glad homage pay.   tA COADIAN LEAVES.      31 TO  A 8ISTEi. ,I O! sister, kind and dear, When stars look on the sea, And friends are thronging round my heart, And tears of grateful feeling start, 'Tis then I think of thee. Together have we strayed In happy hours gone by, When merry birds with plumage fair, Came lightly sailing through the air, Beneath a cloudless sky. And, sister, when I hear The brooklet murmur free- 'Its sparkling water while I drink, And gather pebbles on its brink, My thoughts are then with thee.    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6768-00000017"/> 32       ARCADIAN LEAVES.

And all the bright scenes of our mirth Have sped with the fleeting of years, And on the horizon of earth No sign of returning appears, Yet fresh in my heart linger still The times of devotion with thee, When humbly we sought what the will Of our Father in Heaven might be  And sweetly communed of the blesst That dwell in those regions of light, Where the weary for ever shall rest, And faith shall be changed into sight.

Now o'er the broad ocean of life Henceforth we must journey alone, Till we reach the fair Haven, where strife, Where sorrow and grief are unknown. 'Twas sad from each other to part From scenes that the world could not mar; Still are we united in heart Though distance has severed us far. But life will pass swiftly away, It is but a shadow at best; In faith, let us hope for the day That will crown us with glory and rest.   } -   r aARCADIAN LEAVES.       35 LINES WRITTEN AFTER A STORM.6 TE dark cloud is past, the wild storm is o'er, The thunder's loud crash re echoes no more; And the ocean's proud billows, that rolled mountain high, Now calm, on its breast all motionless lie. The bark that was tossed by waves has anew Once more spread her sails to the fatholess blue; And the bright orb of day, that vanished awhile, Is cheering again the earth with its smile. And rude, boist'rous winds, that howl'd through the trees, Are now giving place to a soft summer breeze; And birds, to the mountains for refuge that flew, Are warbling t   to God the praise to Him due. And wild blooming flowers, that drank of the rain, Are shedding sweet perfume o'er dale, hill, and plain; And the large drops that fell, like tears from the sky, Now, gem-like, embroider the beds where they lie.    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6768-00000019"/> 36       ARCADIAN LEAVES. The lowing of herds is passing away, And again on the hills the young lambs are at play, And the bee, that had ceased from his labors awhile, Is basking once more in the sunbeam's smile. Insects, that thirsted, are filling the air With songs of thanksgiving, in answer to prayer; And the earth's summer robe, that faded had been, Is turning again to a beautiful green. Though wild was the tempest, and dark was the cloud, And harsh was the thunder that echoed so loud, Yet nature rejoices, since these are all past, And fear and dismay are now fled in the blast.   g      ARaCADIAN LEAVES.      37 LINES SUGGESTED BY THE DEATH OF MSS CATHARINE JONES.

Alas! those waving plumes of mournful hue Tell of a form, that, like a lily fair, Around each heart a tender magic threw, And left a smile of quiet beauty there. Disease had early marked her for its prey; We heard no more her soft elastic tread; The rose-bud withered from her cheek away; j Her laughing eye a waning lustre shed. Calmly she slept, but ere that sleep was o'er An angel caught her spirit pure and bright, And on his starry pinions swiftly bore The precious treasure to its home of light.

One by one the glittering stars Looked calmly forth o'er nature as she slept, With her young blossoms cradled on her breast, While ever and anon, in sportive mood, A truant zephyr, with its idle wing, Would shake the lily on its slender stem, Or brush the dew-drops that had crept away, To nestle in the petals of the rose.   Ell!

Oh! she was beautiful, a blushing maid Of eighteen summers; yet her gentle heart Too well had known the bitterness of grief, And as she mused, and fond remembrance came Of by-gone days, when in that shady nook She listened to the tender vows of love, From him, who long had wandered from his home; Her spirit drooped, she bowed her head and wept. Ah! who may reach the hidden springs that lie Within the secret depths of woman's soul!- Man may forget, by fickle fortune swayed, And to his sacred trust may recreant prove; But she, unchanging, till her latest hour, Will in her trusting heart his mem'ry keep; Though wronged, deceived, her faltering lips will breathe His hallowed name; nor chide his cold neglect.    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6768-00000023"/> "      ARCADIAN LEAVES.

What sound is that so faintly hear She starts! It cannot be; she dares not hope! And yet-that manly voice-so like his own!

"I CANNOT believe him false; and yet, how strange that more than three months have elapsed since, by the margin of yonder limpid stream, he held me to his bosom, and promised to be faithful to me for- ever! No, no! I will not believe him false; and yet, there is a weight upon my spirit, a dark forebod- ing of approaching ill, which, in spite of all my ef- forts, I find it impossible to dissipate. Oh! Alfred, Alfred!" and with these words Emily Clifford started from her seat, and, throwing open the case- ment, bathed her aching brow in the cool fragrance of the summer breeze. The night was one of ex- quisite loveliness; but its beauty seemed only to mock her sorrow, and add a deeper pang to the bit- terness of her crushed heart.

"What! you here, and alone!" exclaimed the merry girl. "Why, you are looking the very picture of misery itself. Come, come, cheer up: I have news for you. Cousin Alfred is on his way tp C   , and will probably be with us to-morrow." "Do not jest with me, Kate," answered her com- panion, pettishly; then, recollecting herself, she added, in a more playful tone: "I am not well this evening, so you must pardon my abrupt manner." "I will do no such thing," replied Kate, laugh- ing. "I will believe you angry with me, unless you make me your confessor, and tell me the honest truth, which is, that you are absolutely in love, and that you have some misgivings as to the constancy of my very worthy cousin. There now, be frank with me, and perhaps I may be of use to you; at all events I will endeavor to prove myself worthy of your confidence." "Well, madcap," said Emily, who had by this time recovered her self-possession; " after all, there is something about you positively irresistible ; and   ARCADIAN LEAVES.       101 now, since you have guessed my secret, you must lock it within your bosom. But how came you by the intelligence that Alfred was on his way to C .-.-.?" "I have it from the most credible source imagin- able; yet, lest you should be inclined to doubt its authenticity, I believe I must allow you to peruse a letter, delicately inscribed to a certain young lady, who shall be nameless." Emily took the letter, and proceeded, with a trem- bling hand, to break the seal. It ran thus: "If you have not already banished me from your thoughts, read this, and let the sentiments it conveys, atone in some measure for my long silence and apparent neglect. "You are aware of the circumstances which compelled me to return to my father, and you will also recollect the vows we exchanged on the evening previous to my depar- ture; but you know nothing of the anguish that has rent my inmost soul, and driven me almost to madness. I found my father inexorable. He seemed determined to force me to a union with one, who, from my heart, I utterly detested. She, too, sought every opportunity of intrud- ing herself upon my society; but her presence to me    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6768-00000052"/> 102       ARCADIAN LEAVES. was most repulsive, and I, therefore, avoided her com- pany. "One morning, I was summoned to attend my father in his library. I shall not attempt to describe the con- versation that ensued between us; suffice it to say, he reproached me with my ingratitude, and told me that my obstinacy in refusing to comply with his wishes would plunge him in the vortex of ruin. "'I will not disguise the fact,' he continued, 'that, during my improvident life, I have expended the immense fortune bequeathed me by your grandsire, and an al- liance on your part with Helen Clair can alone enable me to hold the position which is fast tottering from my grasp. Oh, Alfred! by the love of your sainted mother, I conjure you to save me from the storm which must, ere long, burst upon my gray hairs, and make me a beg- gar and an outcast.' "What was to be done, I knew not. My brain reeled; I felt a cold shudder steal over my frame, and, but for the kind hand of an overruling Providence, I should have doubtless yielded to his entreaties. "Fortunately, however, an old friend happening to call, and desiring his immediate presence, I was left alone in the library. A strange curiosity prompted me to open a private drawer, in which I discovered a letter addressed to Helen by my father, disclosing a plan most likely to induce me to become hers. "' Having fulfilled my part of the contract,' he con. tinued, 'I shall leave the rest to you. The prize once   ARCACIAN. ttA1VTSb      103 secured will not be likely to escape. Ellen, it was I who first formed the plan of a matrimonial alliance between you and my son, Alfred knows nothing of the corres- pondence between us.' "Words cannot portray my feelings as I concluded the last sentence of that deceptions letter. I could have crushed it to atoms ; but suppressing my anger, I re- placed it, and, closing the drawer, sat down to deliber- ate on the best means of extricating myself from my un- pleasant situation. It was not long ere my father re- turned. He attempted to resume the conversation ; but this, however, I positively declined. He grew impatient, and threatened to disinherit me. My pride revolted, and, bursting into a paroxysm of rage, I arose hastily, and producing the fatal letter, hurled it at him, with an air of defiance, exclaiming vehemently as I did so, 4 Your secret is betrayed ; I am not so ignorant as you imagine.' "Pale, and trembling with agitation, my father at- tempted to reply, but could not. For some time, he re- mained like one stupified; then, rousing himself from his lethargy, his pent-up breath vented itself in a torrent of invectives, that made my very blood curdle in my veins. ' Go!' he said, ' and may your life be dark, your hopes blighted, and your heart's idol be torn from your embrace.' For a moment, I stood riveted to the spot; then, with a sudden bound, I darted from the room, and instantly left the house. And now, my dear Emily, after all this, can you still deem me worthy of your affec- tion? ahd wil you consent to link your fate with mine?"    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6768-00000053"/> 104      ARCADIAN LEAVES. "Oh, Kate, Kate!" exclaimed the weeping girl, "hov have I wronged the noblest and the best of beings?" The next morning found Alfred Graham tete-a-tete with his betrothed. It was arranged that their nup- tials should be solemnized on the following day in the little church,' at the end of the green lane, and that the bridesmaid should be no other than the beautiful and blushing Kate Hamilton. The news spread like wild-fire through the quiet village of C---; and, at an early hour, the church was thronged with smiling faces, eager to congratulate the youthful pair, and to wish them a long life of joy and prosperity. At the conclusion of the cere- mony, the bridal party returned to their home, where several of their most intimate friends had been in- vited to pass the day. In the evening, a sail was proposed, to which all had cheerfully consented. The lake was unusually calm-scarcely a ripple disturbed its placid waters; and as the gay group sprang into their boats, they were loudly cheered by those who stood watching them from the shore. Scarcely an hour had passed,   ARCADIAN LEAVES.      105 when the heavy clouds were seen hovering in the distance. On they came; and the rising wind and the rolling thunder told of an approaching storm. The lake grew turbulent, and the little boats, tossed to and fro on its angry waters, became almost unmanageable. For a single moment, Alfred held his young wife to his bosom; then, seizing the oar which had dropped from the hand of his companion, with a wild effort he attempted to steer in the direction of the shore, but the movement had been too sudden, and the boat was overturned. Assistance was speedily rendered, and most of the party rescued. But, alas! for poor Alfred, the bright eyes of his darling Emily were closed for- ever; and she, who, but a few hours before, had pil- lowed her head confidingly upon his breast, now slept in the cold waters-the bride of the foaming wave! The curse of his father was fulfilled ; his life was dark, his hopes blighted, and his heart's idol torn from his emLace." 9    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6768-00000054"/> 106      AROAMA  tLtjUESt. A DREAM, O'er summer flowers sleeping, Came zephyrs soft and light) And brilliant stars were gleaming Around the queen of night, That silver beams was flinging O'er mountain, plain, and sea, When softly to me stealing Came d Peams, my love, of thee.

Hand in hand together stand The youthful pair, and fondly there From each is heard the solemn word, That to her swain, in Hymen's chain, Unites the heart of Leonore. i     <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6768-00000058"/> "4      ARCADIAN LEAVES. A GROUP OF LITTLE GIRLS. TO MY LITTLE NIECE WHO IS NOW IN OREGON. Theresa dear, with deep regret How oft I think of thee, And fondly hope. my little pet, Thou'st not forgotten me. Oh! how I miss thy merry laugh, When children near me play; With joy I mark their sports awhile, Then sadly turn away. And o'er the deep to Oregon, On fancy's wings I roam, In search of her who once had been The sunshine of my home. And there behold that tender bud, In childhood's sunny bower, With glowing beauty bright and rare, Unfolding every hour.

Thy lute voice is thrilling each heart with delight, Thy sweet smile is shedding a soft, sunny light, Thy warm lip is breathing the depths of a love, As sweet and refreshing as dews from above. Thy light feet are roving o'er scenes bright and gay, Thy fingers are culling sweet flowers by the way- May wreaths of affection for thee be entwined, And all the sweet graces in thee be combined. TO JULIA. Think not, dearest Julia, that thou art forgot; I am musing of thee when thou knowest it not; In fancy I'm often conversing with thee, And think thou art smiling in answer to me. In night's airy visions I see thy sweet face, And deem thee the image of beauty and grace, When fairy-like footsteps fall soft on mine ear I rise up to greet thee with pleasure sincere.

But melts the heart, as dews that part, When o'er it meet, in cadence sweet, The tones of Isabel. The sunbeam bright, of golden light, With cheering smile may charm awhile, But then its ray will fade away, And leave the glade where once it played- Not so with Isabel. Her smile is bright, from morn till night, And while she sings, a halo flings Around the spot where 'tis her lot, With joyful mirth, to cheer the hearth- Adieu, my Isabel.   ARCADIAN LEAVES.      121 TO MY COUSIN    ELIZA. For thee, dearest cousin, for thee, My harp from the willow I've ta'en, And wake from its long silent chords, A simple, yet heart-bidden strain. I respond, dear cousin, with joy, To thy deep-toned breathings of love, They seem like the notes of a harp When touched by an angel above. With thee, dearest cousin, I hope Each other ere long we shall meet, And mutual friendship and love The joy of our hearts shall complete; For what, dearest cousin, is life, When severed from those we hold dear? Though surrounded by honor and wealth, We yearn for sweet sympathy's tear.    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6768-00000062"/> 122:     ARCADIAN LEAVES. 'Tis vain, dearest cousin, for me, To attempt by language to show The deep, sweet emotions of love,  1 Thy kindness now causeth to flow. Then haste thee, dear cousin, to me, That fondly our hearts may entwine, And yield to each other the joys That love's genial air makes divine. ALICE A. HOLLMES.   p I     </p>
