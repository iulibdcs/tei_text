            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,—</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>My only title to the very great honor I do myself on this occasion, lies in having
               myself been lately called to fill a station in a remote corner of the world, not
               dissimilar to that which your Excellency now occupies. This will be better understood
               on the perusal of the present work, which has been hastily thrown together since my
               return to this my native land, after an absence of about eleven years.</p>
            <p>I have long hesitated upon the propriety of thus making the events of my life public;
               for it is considered proper that characters like ourselves should have the
               circumstances of their lives drawn up by other hands, and even then not till they
               have passed from this mortal scene. Still, if a regard for real facts is to be
               considered, no one is equally competent with myself; and for this reason I have taken
               upon myself the task of selecting and arranging, and of superintending my work
               through the press. Your Excellency will at once perceive the delicacy and difficulty
               of this undertaking; but not wishing to magnify my efforts, I dedicate the work to
               you as it is, and shall look for your sympathy and liberality in passing judgment
               upon its merits; while, at the same time, I shall regard with <emph>favor</emph> such
               of your acts as have terminated unfortunately, and whose effects are magnified by the
               malignancy of your enemies.</p>
            <p>It is a source of great gratification, sir, to look over our common country, and see
               the wonderful advances which are continually made in every department of science and
               industry, in which our fortunate fellow-citizens are engaged; and it may be safely
               said that no nation, since the world began, has elevated itself in everything
               pertaining to man's happiness, in a degree equal to our own. And this is so true,
               that for me now, after eleven years' absence, to become acquainted with all our
               improvements in the arts and in the sciences, in agriculture and in navigation, and
               to obtain a correct idea of the population, resources, wealth, and refinement, even
               of the new States, will require not only a great exercise of memory, but a close
               application to study for a considerable length of time.</p>
            <p>I can but congratulate you, sir, on being placed at the head of such a happy and<pb
                  n="iv-5" xml:id="VAC7230-00000004"/> prosperous nation; and I assure you of my
               hearty concurrence in all your public measures,—not by any means excepting the one in
               which you manifest your love for liberty, by putting your name to that law which
               cements the bond of union between the Northern and Southern States,—and it is my
               earnest wish that the benign and bountiful Providence may shower down on you the
               choicest blessings, not only to the close of your administration, if you are
               permitted to see that period, but to the latest stage of your earthly existence.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN ARMSTRONG.</head>
               <p>MY NAME is Jacob D. Armstrong. I was born in Saybrook, Connecticut, May 5th, 1802.
                  My father, Abraham Armstrong, though by occupation a farmer, was an equal with the
                  higher class of citizens of the county, and for several years was Justice of the
                  Peace. My mother was a pious woman, remarkably quiet, much given to regarding, and
                  was held in high esteem by all her acquaintances. As I was her only child, she
                  loved me with extreme tenderness, and so much so, that, instead of sending me to
                  the District School, which she had an idea was a name for something else,
                  instructed me herself in the elementary branches. She first taught me to write a
                  printed character, and though she died when I was scarcely ten, I have not yet
                  forgotten it, and can, even now, in this respect, excel the most accomplished
                  secretary. Had she not died so soon, my character might have been altogether
                  different; still, the lady whom my father married two years afterwards, was every
                  way worthy of my regard; and I well remember how she used to listen, with tears in
                  her eyes, to my artless account of my poor mother, and she used to make me repeat
                  the stories she told me, the prayers she learned me, and the advice and religious
                  consolation she imparted to me with her expiring breath. For this reason my love
                  was transferred to her, and, having no children herself, our regards were mutual,
                  though to forget my mother was impossible, and, until I left home, I was the
                  subject of her highest concern and most affectionate regard. I am sorry to say
                  that the world should so seldom witness instances of like delicate
                  sensibility.</p>
               <p>At the age of seventeen I entered Yale College, where I remained only two years,
                  for, in consequence of a pernicious habit, not necessary to name, my health was
                  undermined; I was without resolution, and so weak, that I could scarcely drag
                  myself from place to place. Returning home, I made some firm resolutions, worked
                  moderately on the farm during the haying season, and in the fall took charge of an
                  oyster sloop belonging to my father, sailing from our banks to New York. This
                  course of life restored my health, so that, in comparison, I became vigorous; but
                  the next Spring I relinquished the business, and worked on the farm with my
                  father, which I continued to do for two years.</p>
               <p>In my twenty-second year I became acquainted with Miss Ellen Fairbanks, daughter
                  of Judge Fairbanks, of Wallingford. The pleasantest part of my life now commenced.
                  I visited her once a month, and, as she was always advised of these periods,
                  everything was in order, and wore the pleasantest aspect one could imagine. The
                  family were all taken with me; still, Mrs. Fairbanks, my future mother-in-law,
                  told her daughter she did not like my big head, which has made me laugh to myself
                  many times since, considering how affairs apparently terminated. Finally, we were
                  married, July 30th, 1825; and although we had no children for several years, she
                  has been to me a source of great happiness. It is, perhaps, after all, a question
                  whether children really add to the happiness of a pair who love each other; for
                  the many inconveniences and disturbances, the fits<pb n="6-7"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000005"/> of sickness and want of hired girls, have a
                  tendency to interrupt connubial joys; and, when the children prove unfortunate,
                  and make the decline of life unlovely, as is frequently more or less the case, it
                  seems clear enough that the childless state in which there are wealth, good humor,
                  and refinement,' is to be preferred. And yet, it should appear, that a course of
                  uninterrupted pleasures finally, and of its own accord, languishes into lassitude
                  and discontent; the pair look with envy upon their neighbors' boisterous and
                  healthy children, and sigh, almost complain, that they are leading unprofitable
                  lives, so that, as I said above, it is a question whether children really do or do
                  not add to one's happiness.</p>
               <p>Shortly after my marriage I seriously considered the subject of religion, and
                  after passing three weeks of extreme despondency, in which I imagined myself given
                  over to everlasting destruction, I accepted of the terms of salvation, and was
                  received into the Presbyterian Church, Dec. 28th, 1826. From that time to the
                  present I have been a, firm believer in the stern, yet wholesome creed of Calvin,
                  and, to speak rather too openly, a constant observer of all the precepts which it
                  enjoins. It is true that many times I have back-slidden; that I have not always
                  withstood temptation; but I trust, that having been truly called, my sincere
                  repentance has been accepted. The next year I sailed, as commander of the Gull,
                  from New Haven to New Orleans, and by my close attention to business earned, the
                  approbation of my employers. The Gull being condemned, I was put in command of the
                  Hapdragon, from Boston to Havre de Grace, but a misunderstanding arising between
                  the owners and myself, I returned home, and yet, in a few months, took charge, of
                  the Lilly, sailing from Newport to the Havanna. In December, 1828, we were wrecked
                  off the southern port of Florida, with a total loss of vessel and cargo.</p>
               <p>I now remained at home, for my step-mother had lately died; and my father
                  surrendered into my hands his farm of 276 acres, and, living in my family, gave up
                  all worldly, concerns, being in his sixty-seconds year. My father-in-law, the Hon.
                  Judge Fairbanks, at this time induced me to enter upon a political life, and,
                  principally by his influence, I was elected member of the Assembly. I was also
                  returned the succeeding year. Having now wholly regained my health, which I have
                  always considered as resulting from my marriage, my mind enlarged itself, and
                  resuming several elementary studies, I made myself an industrious, energetic, and,
                  I might, perhaps, be permitted to add, a useful man. I paid a considerable
                  attention to politics, and, without intending to become a lawyer, mastered the
                  substance of Blackstone's Commentaries. Several important laws were introduced
                  through my instrumentality, and I have always considered, myself the father of
                  those laws enacted for the protection of shad and oysters. But finding, on account
                  of my temper, which was hasty, and sometimes violent, that I was led into many
                  misunderstandings and mortifications, and thereby discouraged and repressed in the
                  attaining of influence and eminence, I resolved, with a certain bitterness, to
                  withdraw from political affairs.</p>
               <p>I then took a journey through the Western States, and, for some time, led a wild
                  life on the prairies of Illinois and Missouri. During the latter part of the
                  summer of 1831. I sailed the vessel Flying Cloud from Buffalo to Chicago, and
                  returned home in December, entirely satisfied with navigating those straitened
                  waters. March, 1832, I took charge of the merchant ship Hindostan, bound from
                  Boston to Calcutta, Canton, and the Spice Islands. After this voyage I bought
                  three-fourths of the Grampus, an excellent whale ship, and cruised twenty-eight
                  months in the North Pacific Ocean. Having returned with a full cargo, I found; my
                  share amounted to $7000, which, at the suggestion of a merchant, I invested in the
                  Mechanic's Insurance Banking Company, New York. Three weeks afterwards, the Bank
                  broke, and I was glad to get twenty cents on the dollar. This induced me to go to
                  sea again, and accordingly I sailed the Grampus to the eastern coast of Greenland,
                  where, falling in good luck, we filled our casks and set out on our return. But a
                  long and violent storm drove us among the Scottish Islands, where our ship
                  foundered, and was a total loss. However, by the assistance of some fishermen of
                  the Hebrides, we saved the greater part of our cargo, which, being marketed in
                  Liverpool, made us considerable gainers, not with standing the loss of our ship.
                  Returning somewhat disheartened and humbled, and doubting whether I was not
                  seeking my own destruction by going to sea, I determined to stay at home and enjoy
                  myself, nor, through my whole life, adventure again upon the waters.</p>
               <p>I had scarcely become reconciled to the dull life of a landsman, retiring and
                  rising early, and attending church regularly; had scarcely become interested in
                  the quarrels of the choir, and the private history of the minister, Mr. Hanford,
                  when I received a letter from Messrs. Ward, Albright &amp; Co., South street, New
                  York, in which they insisted on my taking command of a new and elegant ship called
                  the Romeo, which they were about sending to China by the way of the Sandwich
                  Islands. After hesitating some time, and, indeed, writing two letters declining
                  the honor they proposed to do me, I finally consented to go, and bade my wife
                  adieu, July 30th, 1838. Our parting was very tender. I had proposed leaving on the
                  28th, but before getting out of bed resolved to stay another day; and, in like
                  manner, the next morning thought one day would make no difference; yet, at last, I
                  gave her the parting salute, little dreaming I should be absent many years.</p>
               <p>It may be proper to remark, in passing, that my wife was a woman on whom my
                  affections were judiciously placed. She was at this time about twenty-five years
                  of age, and at that period of life in which I have been pleased to call a woman
                  most engaging; and neither the pains nor cares of maternity, nor poverty, nor the
                  labors which fall to the lot of most women, not the injudicious use of highly
                  seasoned food, or strong beverages, had detracted from the freshness of her face
                  or the agility of her motions. She spent a reasonable portion of each day in
                  reading pious and entertaining books, and, I am yet to see that woman who could
                  excel her in dressing suitably to the season, to her age, feelings, and
                  complexion. We had always lived together in peace, though I ought to except some
                  periodical times of melancholy, when I was not myself, for she had thoroughly
                  studied my character, she anticipated my wants, attended herself to my
                  shirt-buttons, and had the rare disposition of bending before a storm, not that of
                  taking upon herself to oppose it.</p>
               <p>Reaching New York, I inspected the provisions, anti-scorbutics, water-casks,
                  &amp;c., personally, selected a variety of books and articles of amusement, and
                  being all ready, August 18th, 1838, we were toward to sea, and the same day set
                  sail. Now, since it was between eleven and twelve years before I returned, and
                  since the Romeo was lost, and since too, I was thrown among a peculiar people, I
                  have taken upon myself the task of entering into detail, both as regards the
                  voyage, now commencing, and my subsequent adventures. The following pages are
                  arranged from a journal continued from the time of my departure to that of my
                  return, and may be relied upon for accuracy.</p>
               <p>I had seventeen passengers, viz.: Rev. Mr. Hadfield and lady, with seven children,
                  the oldest twelve; Rev. Mr. Barrings and lady, with four children, the youngest
                  seven, being missionary families bound for the Sandwich Islands, and Horatio
                  Young, a gentleman who was taking the voyage on account of ill health. My crew,
                  selected mostly by myself, was as follows: William Griffith, who, had himself
                  served as captain, first mate; Sharp Squire, second mate; George Darkson, cabin
                  boy; Ben Granville, carpenter; Cuff; cook; and Henry Blake, Mortimer Collingwood,
                  J. Ashburton, William Hooker, Wilson J. Webb, Timothy Dwight, Horace Highly,
                  Albert Barnes Butler, Jean J. Savage, John Slutz, Francis Hogg, John Norris, Peter
                  Peterwiski, A. J. Davis, and Benjamin Park, seamen.</p>
               <p>My employers had entrusted me with 19,000 Spanish dollars, and bills for a<pb
                     n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7230-00000006"/> considerable amount on their agents at
                  Macao. Our freight, as per invoice, Was as follows:</p>
               <p>1 printing press and furniture, types, paper, ink, &amp;c., in 8 boxes and 2 bls;
                  2,000 Bibles, in Burman, for Mr. Judson, at Ava; 4,000 copies of New Testament for
                  Mr. Gutzlaff; 1,500 copies of the Psalms, in Persian; 44 dozen New England
                  primers, in Arabic; 400 muskets, 2 four-pound cannon, 2,000 revolving pistols, 14
                  bls. and 25 kegs powder; 11 cases playing cards, common; 5 do. French, satin
                  finish; 2,000 bottles Newark cider; 30 bls. Monongahela whiskey; 80 baskets
                  champagne; 1 case dice; 1 do. loaded; 1 billiard-table; 7 cases English lawns; 85
                  ounces quinine; 4 boxes Sunday-School Union books; 1 case toys; 1 do. copper
                  jewelry; 80 bales assorted furs; 1,500 lbs. gensing; 2 bookbinder's kits; 1 case
                  temperance drawings and temperance documents; 10 heads. New England rum; 1 Orrery;
                  1 large telescope for the Royal Observatory at Pekin; 90 gross percussion caps;
                  200 boxes Guthrie's percussion pills; 25 doz. Malay knives; 80 do. sword canes;
                  144 lbs. calomel; 20 boxes confectionery 48 do tobacco, and 200 lbs. opium.</p>
               <p>Everything promised a successful voyage. In passing from the Northern to the
                  Southern Hemisphere we would find Autumn succeeded by Spring, without the usual
                  intervention of Winter. The Romeo was nearly new, fitted up in the latest style,
                  built by the best workmen, and of the best material, and, being known as a fast
                  sailer, was selected by the missionary board in preference to several other fine
                  ships sailing to the Pacific about the same time.</p>
               <p>On the 27th, off the Bahamas, we encountered a violent storm, which carried away
                  our cow, but by my skill and the strength of the ship sustained little damage, and
                  made the island of Porto Rico. Here we repaired our rigging and supplied ourselves
                  with tropical fruits. The missionaries' wives and children were highly delighted
                  with the abundance of oranges, lemons, pine apples, plantains, &amp;c., which we
                  hauled up the ship's side, and therefore I received many friendly glances. It did
                  us all good to see the children recover from their seasickness after the tempest,
                  and become as lively as the happy and innocent fishes in the sea below us.</p>
               <p>Set sail Sept. 20th—Every day fine breezes and animating ocean scenery. Met and
                  passed several ships bearing flags of almost every country in the civilized world.
                  October 16th—Touched at Rio Janeiro. The ministers, with their families, visited
                  several American merchants, who, in return, came aboard and drank tea. They were
                  quite polite, and apparently had some religion, yet I perceived the effects of
                  many years of money making in their countenances, even in their walk, and almost
                  pitied them—but rich men stand high above pity or contempt, for they have elevated
                  themselves above the rest of mankind—they have executed monuments more durable
                  than brass—they may not wholly die.</p>
               <p>Beat to sea 20th and 21st.—As we sailed Southward we experienced an agreeable
                  change, for we were no longer subject to the tropical heats, nor made foul with
                  dust blown through the air from the great African Desert. It was the Spring of the
                  year. Mr. Hadfield admired the sea birds and Southern constellations so much that
                  he thought a new heaven and earth were around him, From Nov. 15th to 22d many warm
                  showers. The missionaries, with their families, remained on deck late each evening
                  singing, praying, and exhorting, and as I was always welcome, even solicited the
                  join them, though of another denomination, I shall scarcely ever forget those
                  pleasant seasons. Many of the crew frequently joined them, and were very
                  attentive; and one was overheard to express himself to his companions to the
                  effect, that he enjoyed their society more than the finest clothes he bad ever
                  worn or the choicest food he had ever eaten. Mr. Young's health improved so much
                  that he begun to have hopes of regaining it entirely, though some days, when he
                  was low, he was quite despondent. However, he strengthened on the whole, and as he
                  was a polite gentleman, learned, sociable, and handsome, though of rather a
                  whiteish cast, I took a fancy to him, notwithstanding he was of a sarcastic and
                  sceptical turn. Innumerable strange birds surrounded the ship—they were red,
                  yellow, crimson, purple, and green, and many of them exceedingly graceful.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they would skin around the waves, sometimes brooding upon them they were
                  hurried away, and not unfrequently they hovered around the ship and rested upon
                  the spars. The ship was also surrounded by a great variety of crimson, purple,
                  spotted, golden, and watery fish, and showed us by the endless variety of their
                  motions how much better they can exhibit themselves by water, than cattle can by
                  land. As we approached Cape Horn, we saw several whales spouting lofty jets of
                  water. Mr. Young took upon himself to explain to the families, some peculiarities
                  regarding the whales, as, how a certain species gets its living by straining a
                  little animal of the size of a been through its teeth, for it is born with the
                  lockjaw, and cannot open its mouth. He exhibited engravings of their skeletons, of
                  the method of harpooning them, cutting them up, and extracting their oil. On my
                  listening very attentively to all that he said, he remarked that it was strange I
                  could take any interest in a landsman's account of the fishery, for he supposed I
                  had killed more whales than he had teeth. In the Sabbath discourses, for we had
                  service on that day, as well as two or three times during the week, Mr. Hadfield
                  spoke of the wisdom in assigning the whale to the ocean, for were the land his
                  habitative place, he would be unable, from his grossness, to get a sufficient
                  quantity of food, without trespassing on our gardens and fields. Wisely therefore
                  has he been put into the sea, where he can eat what he chooses, and nobody be
                  injured. He mentioned several other animals, such as the porpoise, grampus, morse,
                  sea-serpent, and shark, which, by getting their food in the seas, and living three
                  from their cradles to their graves, so to rights or he no existence. From this he
                  was led to speak of other creatures, aerial and terrestrial, dwelt upon the
                  fitness of one thing for another everywhere observable, and remarked that it would
                  be strange indeed, if God, in giving life and superior faculties to man. and in,
                  placing him infinitely above the rest of his works, should, in the end, leave him
                  to go the way of the swordfish, and shark, "No, my friends, it would be absurd to
                  suppose that he has so left us, for his protecting care is over us, and when we
                  trace our lines backward, willing to search and see, this is evidently manifest;
                  he has humbled us when we were proud, exalted us when we were low, and with his
                  spiritual influence caused us to avoid danger, and blindly to rush to some
                  exhibition of his mercy and goodness; and now, here today, with the great waves of
                  this remotest corner of the world around us, and the nearest land, ten thousand
                  feet below, we are as safe as we were long ago upon our mother's bosom."</p>
               <p>One day when we were under a light sail, we saw a water spout. two miles off. It
                  was about half a mile high, and turned continually upon its base with a spiral
                  motion, while at the same time it glided towards the pole. This afternoon we
                  caught a shark twelve feet long, laid him upon the deck, Mr. Squire knocked him in
                  the head, as though he had been a calf. With our anatomical books before us we cat
                  him into mince meat.</p>
               <p>The most tedious, alarming, and dangerous part of our voyage now commenced.
                  Although I find the particulars in my journal, and in the first draught of this
                  work, have circumstantially detailed the whole matter, yet my pen shrinks from
                  recording it. Therefore, the extreme fright of the families, the awful tossing of
                  the ship, the insolent demand of the seamen for liquor that might die drunk and at
                  peace, and my knocking the cape itself as frost, snow, iey ropes and slippery
                  deck, and the fatigue of myself and men, I pass over and hasten to the more
                  important, it not more interesting part of my narrative.</p>
               <p>Nov. 25.—Field ice all around us, yet, at a distance we descry the open sea, and
                  at the same time the waves of the pacific, dashing into the Southern Ocean.</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7230-00000007"/>
               <p>4 o'clock P.M.—Clear seas and heavy swell—water of a deep dark green. To the
                  passengers, the ship was at one time on an elevation equal to that of Chimborazo,
                  and the next moment fell into a profound valley with the said mountain falling
                  after them. Such of my crew as had only sailed to Europe and the West Indies, were
                  alarmed at the sight of these monstrous billows, but became reconciled when they
                  saw how easily the ship sailed over them. We hoisted our larger sails while we
                  were pursued by the stormy petrel, the snow-gull, or the albatross, and pursued
                  too, hour after hour, by some hungry shark both the ship and he side by side.</p>
               <p>Nov. 26.—Sun arose clear. Light wind. Repaired some of our rigging, and spread all
                  our canvas. Latitude 51° 18'' South, Longitude 93° West. 27 and 28th passed
                  without any remarkable occurrence. Latitude 45° 40', Longitude 98° or
                  thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Nov. 30.—A sail appeared which I took for a man—of—war. She showed British colors
                  and fired a gun for us to lay to. I did so, glad to learn the news, and to send
                  letters homeward. About noon a boat came along side, and fifteen or twenty
                  officers and seamen leaped aboard. It appeared that the ship was the Elecampaign
                  of 74 guns searching for pirates. They examined our papers very closely and seemed
                  to have a notion of searching the ship; but being invited, they drank several
                  bottles of champaigne, wished me a successful voyage, and took their departure.
                  When aboard they bade us farewell by firing a gun, to which we of course replied.
                  I heard it whispered among my men that Mr. Squire who loaded the piece, put in a
                  charge of something over the powder, which scattered on the water, but although I
                  knew he bore a mortal enmity to the British, I could not believe such a thing of
                  him and made no inquiry into the matter. Let me remark here that Mr. Squire was my
                  friend. He had sailed with me in many voyages, and was a good seaman. He was a
                  native of my own town, he owned a small farm near my own, he belonged to the
                  Methodist church, and looked up to me continually. Still, he was rather set in his
                  way, and was the only one on board any ship I ever commanded, who was in the habit
                  of disputing with me, that is, to a certain point, for when he saw that I had
                  eaten too much dinner, or was, from some other cause, ill-humored, he walked as
                  circumspectly and as humbly as the King of England could have wished.</p>
               <p>Dec. 10.—Fine breeze all day. 10 o'clock P. M. for the first time, saw the Aurora
                  Australis. It is more luminous than the same phenomenon in the north, and
                  sometimes assumes a great variety of shapes, such as castles, cities and
                  landscapes. The passengers broke out into devotional songs as they sat watching
                  it, and our spirits were high. Dec. 12.—Latitude 39° 60', Longitude 105° 45' 18''.
                  Porpoises crowded around the ship in a very extraordinary manner. We fired two or
                  three muskets among them, when they skipped and danced through the water and
                  entirely disappeared. One of them, however, was wounded and had a young one under
                  her fin; she raised her blood covered face towards us, and turned up her infant
                  which looked so much like a human baby, that had a Mahomedan seen it, he must,
                  have wept. This day caused every part of the ship to be fumigated and the ceilings
                  and floors to be washed with the juice of sour krout. For dinner we had this
                  preparation with baeon and potatoes, but the ship's crew mostly, refused to eat
                  it, till I told them they should have nothing else, when they fell to and eat
                  heartily. Most people think that sour krout is not fit to eat, they say it stinks,
                  but I assure them they are prejudiced against it; and besides there is no
                  anti-scorbutic like it, for a ship well stored with it need never fear the scurvy.
                  Sent up a new fore-top sail. Think I must have got west of the regular track, for
                  about sundown passed a small cluster of reefs and breakers laid down only in the
                  Portuguese chart of Liberatas Sylvester. Upon throwing the lead with 10, 20, 50,
                  and 80 fathoms line, found no bottom. Caused strict watch to be kept for more
                  breakers, and explained to my men how coral reefs are continually rising in this
                  part of the ocean; and that in many places there is</p>
               <p>no more safety than there is on the Mississippi for a steamboat—a reef arises
                  where lately a ship passed in safety—at evening a sand bar is formed where in the
                  morning the current boiled. About 9 o'clock, while we were conversing in the
                  cabin, and preparing to retire, some sea-animal swimming up to the rudder chains
                  bellowed so terribly that the women were nearly thrown into fits, and I myself was
                  raised to my feet.</p>
               <p>Dec. 13th.—Light changeable breezes during the fore part of the day. Noon, wind
                  steady and full. Dinner of sour krout and portable soup. 4 o'clock, breeze stiff;
                  made 18 knots the hour. Longitude, 108° 40' 44''; latitude, 34° 45' 2''. Breakers
                  eight miles west; no bottom.</p>
               <p>Dec. 14th.—Midnight, violent, thunder-storm; cleared off by daybreak, and stars
                  shone. Mr. Griffith reported sound of breakers. In the afternoon caught a large
                  shark, Chained his month together, locked it with a barn padlock, and set him
                  adrift; seemed unwilling to leave; followed alongside an hour and a quarter;
                  looked at us with red, watery eye; appeared to think us cruel; at last flapped his
                  tail and dived. 10 o'clock, P.M.—Heavy swell from the S. W. Had the sails taken
                  in, and preparations made for a storm.</p>
               <p>Dec. 15th.—Just before daybreak, heavy thunder-storm in the distance; it passed
                  away in less than an hour, the sky became clear, the sea calm. Ordered the pumps
                  examined and repaired, and sour krout for dinner. Twenty-three flying-fish lit on
                  the deck, which we cooked for supper, and found to be tolerable food, but unequal
                  to cod. This was the last day we spent on board the Romeo without alarm. Weather
                  warm; prayers on deck; turned in at half-past ten.</p>
               <p>Dec. 16th.—A few minutes after three o'clock, I was awaked by some one shaking me
                  violently. I saw by the lamps held over me that it was Mr. Griffith, but I could
                  not think any danger near, because I had not been forewarned in my sleep, nor
                  during the day had received any presentiment. I might remark that warnings are
                  usually received by those who are in danger, not so much that they may save
                  themselves, as that, after they are ruined they may reflect on their amazing
                  stupidity. Mr. Griffith whispered, for he was a cautious seaman, that I must come
                  on deck, breakers being a-head. I went up immediately. By the bearing of the
                  stars, I knew that the wind had shifted a little. I heard the man in the chains
                  crying, "Fourteen deep fathom!" "By the deep ten!" and then, "No bottom." The
                  sails were taken in so as to lay the ship to, and a boat was sent out to ascertain
                  where the breakers were. All along I heard the breaking of the surf; and as it
                  continued constantly at the same volume, I was at ease, for I knew that we were
                  lying still. About day break a thick fog settled over the sea, which alarmed me,
                  for I feared that the boat would be lost in it; but with proper foresight, I
                  caused the ship's bell to be constantly rung. A little after 7 o'clock, the fog
                  rose up from the water, the sun presently broke forth, and about two miles off we
                  saw the boat rising and falling, and the oars dripping in the sunbeams. By the
                  time they came on board, the air was clear as a gun. The sea was everywhere
                  covered with beautiful birds, and with horse-eye bubbles, signifying that the
                  Waves had lately broken. Mr. Griffith reported that there were continued clusters
                  of reefs about eight miles a-head, lying in the shape of a horse-shoe, and
                  extending easterly and westerly farther than their eyes could reach. However,
                  there were several passages, one in particular, a half a mile in width, with
                  sufficient water, and the open sea all beyond. Trimming the ship properly, we
                  accordingly made sail.</p>
               <p>Of a sin then committed, I have since sincerely repented.</p>
               <p>Trimming the ship properly, we accordingly made sail. In less than half an hour,
                  the danger was manifested. The waves broke over long lines like piers, or
                  break-waters, and extended on the right and left, as I judged by the assistance of
                  my glass, twenty or thirty miles. At this juncture we fell into a strong current,
                  setting through the reef, and then spreading all our sails, cleared the passage in
                  a few minutes. Before we were aware, we passed within thirty feet of<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000008"/> a sharp-pointed rock. Upon sounding, we found only
                  ten fathom of water, which made me conclude we were above the foundations of an
                  erecting island. The lead continuing still to be thrown, we still had ten fathom.
                  I ordered the sails to be taken in, when suddenly my ears caught, "And a hardly
                  seven!" I ordered the anchors to be got ready, for still the ship drifted forward,
                  when I was astonished at the quick exclamation of "Six!" electrified by "Hardly
                  five!" and caused the anchors to be cast at "Quarter four!" The boat being now
                  sent forward with the lead, found at a short distance no bottom, and the same for
                  five or six miles. On its return we set sail, and continuing to sound several
                  hours, saw no reason for being alarmed, and accordingly crowded on the canvas.
                  Made no observations this day.</p>
               <p>At 7 o'clock I went to tea, and being tired, shortly after turned in. I had no
                  sooner touched my hammock, than the ship struck. The screaming from the
                  missionaries' cabin, the trampling on deck, the cry of "Captain! Captain!" the
                  raking of the forward part of the ship, and the excitement of my feelings as I put
                  on my breeches, I shall never forget. Hurrying on deck, I found everything in the
                  utmost confusion. The crew were expecting that the ship would break apart, or fill
                  with water, slide off the rocks, and sink. We tried the pumps, and finding no
                  water made, began to have hopes. Yet we could do nothing more than lighten the
                  ship, and wait for full tide, when we might expect to float off. Our heaviest
                  freight was thrown overboard. It grieved me to see the rich and costly merchandise
                  fall like lead, or, half sinking float away; nevertheless, I thought to myself
                  that some of it were as well in the bottom of the sea as any where else; the
                  lightest articles were lashed together, and spars got out, with tackling affixed,
                  to assist in getting afloat. Meanwhile, I appointed a pump-watch. By this time it
                  was daybreak. The moon had shone during the after part of the night, and now was
                  in mid-heavens, while the tide was highest. The sea was somewhat smoother, and the
                  morning breeze had not arisen. We labored with our utmost strength, directed by
                  our united experience; and the women, when we strained ourselves, fancied they
                  lifted also; but all availed nothing, the ship would not stir, and the breeze
                  rising as the tide fell, again the Romeo thundered upon the rocks.</p>
               <p>Dec. 17.—This was the last day I spent on board the Romeo. I had fallen on a
                  settee with some pancakes and honey before me, when Mr. Griffith came and told me
                  there were three feet of water in the hold. The men were all set to the pumps,
                  when the carpenter and I went down to discover the leak. It appeared that at first
                  a considerable sized rock had passed quite through the ship's side, and remaining
                  fast, little or no water entered, particularly as some chaff and straw which we
                  had thrown down was drawn in by the slight current, and filled the little
                  vacancies. But afterwards this rock was pounded through, and while we were there
                  the ship struck with such violence, that, splinters were thrown around us. To work
                  the pumps was useless. The loss of the ship was inevitable. And now she began to
                  settle down at the stern. The long boat was launched immediately. Some
                  mathematical instruments, and what provisions could be carried, were put aboard.
                  The missionaries, with their families, and most of the crew got in, and rowing off
                  a little ways awaited my orders. Mr. Griffith, Mr. Young, two seamen and myself
                  remained. We got out the small boat and put in several necessary articles. Again
                  the Romeo settled down. There was no time to be lost, and I alone remained. I
                  could scarcely bear the thought of parting with the good ship. I looked around the
                  cabin, saw the convenient state rooms, the beds all made, and everything
                  comfortable,—cast my eyes upon the looking glasses, and tassels, fringes, settees,
                  chairs, spitting boxes, carpets, lamps, mahogany tables, pictured panels—what a
                  loss! and what stores of cordage and rigging, what heavy anchors and chains, and
                  all the nameless, articles costing such vast sums, necessary for the equipment of
                  a ship of 700 tons; but again the Romeo settled down; Mr. Griffith called to me
                  with violence, and I was forced to tear myself away. I went to my state room,
                  seized my pocket bible, and about two pounds of tobacco, and entered the small
                  boat. Immediately we pulled away and joined our companions. This was about 1
                  o'clock, P.M., and Dec.17, 1838. As I was determined not to leave the neighborhood
                  of the ship till all was over, I directed Mr. Granville, who steered the long
                  boat, to come near, and hand me the mathematical instruments, when I took an
                  observation and determined our position very exactly, it being 29° 18' 54'' S. and
                  131° 6' 7''42''' W. I handed them back to him, and remarked, that by steering
                  N.N.W. We could not fail to fall in with some islands, as we could not be many
                  hundred miles from Pitcairn's or St. John Baptist, and directed him to go on a
                  little, and I would follow. The missionaries broke out singing Bishop Heber's
                  hymn, in which occurs that line "From India's Coral Strand," as affecting as it
                  was appropriate, since it was a coral rock upon which the ship struck, and when
                  they concluded, Mr. Barrings cried our, that "He who held the waters in the hollow
                  of his hand," might preserve me, me the captain, and the boat being pulled away,
                  this was the last I ever heard him speak. I have since been informed that they
                  reached Hawaii, in safety. I watched them till they had gone forty or fifty rods,
                  when turning towards the ship, she was no more to be seen. She had gone down
                  suddenly, and we followed after the long boat. It was now about six o'clock, and
                  the sun was setting. With my glass I could see the missionaries taking tea, or
                  that food suitable for them, and my crew cutting up their bread and pork. We
                  endeavored to come up with them, and indeed did so about dark, but the wind being
                  fresh and the waves high, we were afraid, of staving, and accordingly kept about a
                  quarter of a mile astern. When the moon rose, shortly after, we saw them at about
                  the same distance. I used my glass, and beheld the women and children asleep, and
                  the missionaries and some of the sailors exceeding heavy. But there were five or
                  six of my men wide awake, and once my glass came across a mouth stretched in a
                  broad laugh. Three o'clock, heavy thunder storm, succeeded by a drizzling rain.
                  The sea ran high, and many times we thought we should be overwhelmed, for with
                  difficulty we kept the water out of the boat. When morning came, we could see
                  nothing of the long boat—we saw only the ocean, and each other's faces; and we
                  concluded they had been swallowed, and that beauty and strength, and innocence and
                  age, were stretched together upon the sand, at the bottom of the ocean. More
                  desolate beings than we were, it is not possible to imagine. The day was cloudy,
                  we had no compass, and knew not which way to steer. We had but a small quantity of
                  provisions, that is, something like 28 pounds of bread, a 5 gallon keg of water,
                  and half a dozen bottles of Newark cider. We were five in number, viz: Myself, Mr.
                  Griffith, Mr. Young, Mr. Squire, and Mr. Norris. What to do we did not know, but
                  in a stupefied state, we spread the little sail and let the boat glide
                  whithersoever it would. Sometime in the afternoon the sun came forth, when we saw
                  we had been sailing to the West. We tacked about, made a northerly course, and
                  taking care to trim the boat, found that she sailed very well. The sun set in
                  golden clouds afar off. Then the stars shone. For a long time we sat like men who
                  have lost their reason in the committing of a crime. To endeavor to reach
                  Pitcairn's or St. John Baptist, seemed hopeless, and we looked most to encounter
                  some ship, although we were to the west of the regular track, but should this hope
                  be delusive, we trusted that God would show us mercy, mercy if we were to live, by
                  our soon finding our 'deliverance, and mercy if we were to die, by overlooking our
                  sins, which were more of ignorance than of wilfulness, though we granted it
                  difficult to disremember the latter; and take us into the Heavenly Haven.</p>
               <p>Dec. 19.—Through the night the boat made some progress, as I determined by the
                  stars. Again the morning sun shone upon us, as cheerfully as it had ever done in
                  days long gone, when we had roamed in green fields, and on damp pebble stones, and
                  played, in the streets of our native villages. We eat and drank<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000009"/> sparingly, and night came again. The weather was
                  warm and we noticed many falling stars. Towards morning it grew colder, when I
                  thought of my tobacco with great joy, and we took a taste all around, and
                  presently formed, I know not what plans; we imagined we would come upon some
                  uninhabited island, amidst the coral lagoons, where we might remain some years,
                  and breathe out our lives—but we might as well die where we were, and let our boat
                  be tossed thousands of miles, with our bones in our clothes, lying in the
                  bottom.</p>
               <p>Dec.20.—About daybreak, Mr. Young and Mr. Griffith entered into conversation,
                  concerning human flesh. They discussed the point, whether it makes men insane, as
                  is affirmed by divers navigators, and they came to the conclusion, that such is
                  really the case, not so much from the effects of the flesh itself, as from the
                  previous privation, and the doleful state of mind incident to such an extremity. I
                  asked them, if in case they should survive their companions, they were going to
                  feed upon their bodies. Mr. Young said, he did not know what he might do in the
                  ravings of hunger, but he was determined not to be a cannibal so long as his
                  reason remained. Mr. Norris waking up, and hearing these words said, it was a
                  dreadful thing to think of, and rather than do it he would cut off his right hand;
                  and he added, if we will reason a moment we will perceive that it is no great
                  matter to die, since some person is drawing his last breath every moment. Mr.
                  Griffith said, this was true enough, but being born to live more than to die, he
                  was unexperienced in the matter, and would rather remain as he was, till old age
                  should gradually dispossess him of his powers, and make death not only natural,
                  but desirable. And yet since the aged too, "shrink back again to life, fond of
                  their prison and their clay," the present was as proper a time to day as any—and
                  this led him to say, that death is an uncertainty, for notwithstanding his belief
                  in the Bible and sermons, and the common voice of all ages and nations, it was
                  still a matter of doubt whether there is a future state,—we might be placed in
                  this world as objects of contemplation for superior creatures, and at death be
                  swallowed up in oblivion, though he granted that this was contrary to one's ideas
                  of goodness, which is supposed to be the basis of the universe; but we were poor
                  judges of what is for the good of creation at large; and the matter standing thus
                  very clearly, that is to say, in doubt and perplexity, we owe only one thing to
                  the Truth, that is, which is God, or any other name one may select, submission to
                  His will, for if He is a good and wise being, no harm shall be done us, and if He
                  is an evil being, or apparently evil all that we can do will not make Him
                  otherwise.</p>
               <p>I told Mr. Griffith that such reflections became a heathen much better than a
                  Christian, who lays hold of the promises of the Gospel with the hand of faith, and
                  that too with a vehemence and fierceness, so to speak, which shall silence the
                  doubts and cavils Satan puts into his mind. At the same time he is to review his
                  past life, repent of his evil deeds, and being accepted, is sure of attaining the
                  kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Mr. Griffith said it would please him very much to go to Heaven, but, to speak in
                  a figure, he doubted whether he could put his craft in proper order, during the
                  short time apparently remaining; for on account of the strict regulations aloft,
                  it was not every kind of vessel that was permitted to enter that harbor, and that
                  ship which sails from an infected port with suspicious papers, and the plague
                  aboard, must, to say the least, ride a weary quarantine. He wished, therefore,
                  that he might go ashore, and by the assistance of friends, examine the bottom of
                  his faith. For he had sailed through many storms of temptation, and in the
                  shattered Condition they had left him, he was conscious that much was to be done
                  before he should be willing to get his clearance papers from Death, and, with the
                  assurance that they were right, present them at the custom-house of Heaven.</p>
               <p>I replied, that as things were, he had no other opportunity than the present for
                  putting his craft in the order he wished, and since the time was so short, the
                  sooner he commenced the better. For my part, I was determined to do the best I
                  could; meditation, and silent supplications for forgiveness, and a total
                  extinction of all ill feeling towards any human being, should fill my remaining
                  days; and then, I hoped that in whatever I might fail, the Great Captain of our
                  Salvation, since he had sailed the ocean of life, and learned in himself how many
                  storms, reefs, currents, and false lights, there are to lead poor mariners astray,
                  and the losses I had experienced he himself would make up to the Great Underwriter
                  of All.</p>
               <p>While we were discoursing in this manner, the sun rose out of the billows and
                  warmed our damp garments. Some fanciful red 'clouds made us imagine for a moment
                  that we beheld trees and meadows. We partook of a slight meal and sang a hymn.
                  Some time after we examined our provisions, and found, to our surprise, only about
                  five pounds of bread and two gallons of water remaining. Though we had been
                  frugal, still we reflected that we might have eaten less. Mr. Young looked at the
                  provisions some time and remarked that that, then, was the precious stuff which
                  makes the world and the stars to mankind what they are; and then, with some
                  bitterness added, that although really more precious than silver, gold, or a
                  universe of jewels, yet by many at that moment was accounted as dust.</p>
               <p>We had nothing to do but to sit still and let the boat glide on, esteeming our
                  case entirely hopeless; nevertheless, Mr. Squire remarked, that our situation was
                  really preferable to that of a wicked man whose whole life was one of continued
                  prosperity; or to that of a certain great man he had read of who did something
                  very wrong, and then through the remainder of his life, "walked at the funeral of
                  his own reputation."</p>
               <p>At sun-set we eat and drank again, and a little after dark, the most of us fell
                  asleep. But I remained awake and guided our boat by the stars. I bit my lips
                  thinking on our condition. Slept a little during the after part of the night.</p>
               <p>Dec. 22nd.—After we had eaten our breakfast, and sat awhile in silence, Mr. Young
                  took out his watch, and remarked that a great many thousand children were entering
                  school in every part of the United States. The sun was shining in through the
                  windows of villages, and on southern pavements, in cities, where ladies and
                  gentlemen dressed in furs and warm clothing, were walking up and down, not
                  thinking of the salt sea nor of us. It was shining on the piney mountain tops,
                  where cold water bursts out and freezes along the sides of precipices. If snow was
                  on the ground, young people were sleigh-riding, and their bells were ringing
                  merrily, while in the woods the hunter follows the track of the far leaping deer.
                  The axe is heard on the edge of the forest, and the tall hickory tree falls
                  headlong scattering the snow like a breaking billow. In farm-houses there are warm
                  fires, and cookery, and many old and sweet faces; in taverns men are drinking and
                  tossing up coppers; in offices and students' rooms, there are books and heated
                  stoves, and in the many thousand churches, the still sun-light rests upon the
                  cushions of pew and pulpit, and there the mouse suns himself in the broad aisle.
                  Why should one go to sea when there is so much waste land, and so many delightful
                  places? But death comes to all alike, and rightly considered is never an accident.
                  That we have been connected with our bodies many years is nothing—we would love
                  any other dust as much, and since we must die what matter is it if we do so by sea
                  or land, we are of the earth, earthy—dust is but dust, whether in Asia or
                  America.</p>
               <p>Mr. Griffith assented to this and yet he said all classes of men have united in
                  admitting that a future state is at the best one of uncertainty; man and beast
                  naturally dread the approach of the last moment, and this voice of nature, or
                  rather shriek, he might call it, must, he believed, have some good cause for its
                  existence, though he granted We naturally dread changes in life when there is
                  neither pain or danger apparent; but whether it was on this account, or on that of
                  the disruption of old connections, or the doleful state in which the soul is<pb
                     n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7230-00000010"/> about to find itself, or the total
                  extinction of earthly light, being, and intelligence, he was not prepared to
                  decide, nevertheless it was plainly our duty to look heavenward, and if we might,
                  strive to rise, at the last gasp, to the being who created us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Norris begged leave to say, that the man who had done his duty to his fellow
                  man and his family, according to the best of his ability, need fear death no more
                  than a blue bird, but he, who, like Captain Kidd, had sailed this life with "his
                  Bible in his hand," who sat at church and sang with the congregation, and then got
                  rich on the sweat of others—who fared sumptuously every day, while his work hands
                  picked bones and ate cold potatoes at the second table, might justly fear falling
                  into the hands of the Great Captain of the Wreckers.</p>
               <p>At this instant, as I was sweeping the horizon with my glass, I discovered an
                  island, but Norris's words attracting my attention, I hastened to reply. As to men
                  becoming rich on the labor of others, I said, it was an expression in the mouths
                  of many who were more willing to find fault than to mend themselves. And how, said
                  I, comes it about that poor men usually sit at the second table? It is because of
                  their voracity and unseemly habits, which not only keep them poor, but make them
                  unfit for polite and restrained society. If, when they come to sit down at last,
                  the victuals are cold, the fault lies not with those who eat first; on the
                  contrary it lies at their own door, as may be proven, if they will mend their
                  manners and become more saving and diligent. If we are to die, let us not die
                  doing injustice to industrious and economical men, how far soever away they may be
                  at present from us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young said the conversation was taking a very curious turn considering the
                  state we were in, and perhaps it was well enough to introduce some other subject
                  than that of death, since it would presently introduce itself whether we wished it
                  or no. And not very mal apropos, after all, were these last thoughts to dying men.
                  It could be easily shown that a poor man's last hours are extremely sorrowful, for
                  he has been the drudge of others—his days have been to him unfruitful—life has
                  been a continual struggle between ignorance and poverty, and at last, he descends
                  into the grave amidst the double darkness of expiring nature and a beclouded
                  understanding. If it is true then, that there is a class of proud and luxurious
                  men who by their intellect take advantage of the willingness of honest men to
                  labor, and frame laws so that from generation to generation money and skill shall
                  have the advantage of poverty and ignorance, that class is refusing to be its
                  brother's keeper, and in a future state cannot complain if the disinherited come
                  to enjoy what is their own, and they themselves receive the reward of their
                  misdeeds. It stood us in hand, therefore, at that juncture, to consider whether we
                  had or had not disheartened poor boys or industrious timid men, whether we had not
                  sneered enviously or contemptuously, or withheld assistance or advice which we
                  were able to impart, and knew would be of great assistance. This, though usually
                  not brought into the account of men's lives, was, in his opinion, a most important
                  consideration.</p>
               <p>Taking the glass from my eye, I remarked that we had as well suspend this
                  conversation since it was running off into such strange matters, and we would go
                  ashore on yonder island. But indeed the glass was unnecessary, for now the island,
                  that is when we were on the top of a wave, lay directly before us, and immediately
                  the thoughts of death were as distant as though we were to live for ever, or we
                  felt as though we had tasted death and that its bitterness was to be ours no more.
                  Still, half fearing that we were mistaken, we, took oars, and in a short time hill
                  after hill arose out of the water. By the time the sun was an hour high, we were
                  close under the Southern shore of a large island, which was covered with trees. A
                  bold shore, several hundred feet high, stood in the sea, about four miles to the
                  East. We now considered whether we might not be massacred immediately upon
                  landing, but we had more confidence in man than in the elements, a part of nature
                  though they be, which some thinks so highly of, and steering for a little creek,
                  we were thrown by the waves into a cove beneath some large trees. We got out and
                  immediately felt refreshed in the cool shade and the air of the woods, for, having
                  been several days exposed to the meridian sun, our faces and hands were blistered,
                  and our bodies stiff with sweat and the confined seats we had occupied. We looked
                  around us butsaw no signs of the island being inhabited, and then stripped and
                  bathed ourselves in the shelter of some coral rocks which lay along the shore.
                  Thereupon we divided our food and the water into five equal parts, which we
                  consumed immediately, and it being near dusk, we lay down under our sail, on the
                  grass, and almost instantly fell asleep. During the night I imagined a sea
                  breaking over me, and rousing myself perceived that the dew had wet through the
                  sail, which made me dream I was feast away. About daybreak Mr. Squire began to cry
                  the lead, and continued to do so, with the many variations which indicated danger,
                  till we awakened him. We shook the dew off the sail, and though we could see a
                  light streak over the eastern part of the sea, we sank to sleep again. It was late
                  before we awoke; the sun was shining among the tree tops above our heads, and not
                  a drop of dew remained. Getting my thoughts together, I told my men that the trees
                  undoubtedly furnished food, and going a little way back from the sea, for the salt
                  spray spoils the set of all kinds of fruit, we presently came into a magnoot
                  grove. This tree grows to the height of an apple tree, the fruit resembles a black
                  walnut in size; and the pomegranate in exterior, which being hulled, presents the
                  eatable part, in the shape of a large plum, which is white and pulpy, and contains
                  two small kernels. Its taste is mildly acid and extremely luscious, without any
                  cloying tendency. Walking along as we ate, we came upon several other kinds of
                  fruits; indeed in a few minutes we had the pineapple, coco, banin, custard apple,
                  mango, papaya, and plantain, with which we filled our-selves without feeling any
                  the worse, but rather were in a comfortable easy state, almost wishing the island
                  uninhabited that we might take possession, and it would be no unpleasant residence
                  even though we should never see other faces than our own. Still it was by no means
                  likely that an island so large and rich in fruits and large trees should be
                  without people, and though we had no means of ascertaining whether they would
                  worship us as gods or eat us up as vermin, we began to consider the best means for
                  securing a favorable introduction. Accordingly we thought best to take an
                  excursion into the interior of the island, wherefore, arming ourselves with clubs,
                  that we might defend ourselves should we be attacked, we set out. At every step we
                  saw some new and strange variety of flower, fruit, and tree, and whose size and
                  luxuriance were surprising and uncommon. What we did not expect was the openness
                  and clearness of the woods, there being few or no underbrush, and no jungles or
                  swamps, and we could see from knoll to knoll very much as on our chestnut ridges,
                  yet there being so many fruit trees we could scarcely persuade ourselves we were
                  not in 'a garden which had been neglected.</p>
               <p>While we were walking along Mr. Young pointed to a rabbit a little ahead of us,
                  which we observed, but presently, as we drew near it, we were surprised, for it
                  did not run, and continued feeding although it could not fail to see us. Mr. Young
                  drawing near very softly, proposed to take it in his hand; as it offered no other
                  resistance than walking a step or two, he took it up, when we all examined it, and
                  found it peculiar only as regards having a white spot on each ear resembling a
                  half moon land as white as the moon itself. In a few minutes its mate came among
                  us, and going from one to the other, stood at last at Mr. Young's feet and looked
                  up to his arms. The tameness of these animals we looked upon as certainly
                  indicating that the island was uninhabited, and when we put it down and walked on
                  we wondered among ourselves how the native navigators of islands not a great way
                  off had never come hither; when we came upon a little field of about four acres,
                  surrounded by a living hedge of trees thickly planted, and entered by a mound
                  which we soon discovered had been<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7230-00000011"/> thrown
                  up by art, but when we entered this field we found it bare, and only a species of
                  grass growing, without the least signs of a human being having for a long time
                  entered the enclosure. We now concluded that though once inhabited the island had
                  for many ages been deserted.</p>
               <p>Leaving this place we came to a high hill, which, so far as we could see, ran
                  through the whole extent of the island, but here was merely spurred into crags,
                  out of which burst a great many springs, and we observed that presently they
                  collected together and joined a considerable stream in a valley, indicated by some
                  tree tops being seen below us. While we were considering what course to take a
                  flock of birds of Paradise lit on a nutmeg tree near by us. Their feathers were
                  very long and arched into ribbons and convolved bows, and plumed with red, green,
                  and gold, and were so extremely delicate that we concluded the island unvisited by
                  storms, and that vegetation was nourished by dews. Again, we were surprised that
                  we were permitted to handle the gorgeous inhabitants of these woods, and since we
                  had been lately roughly used we took the credit of doing so very tenderly.</p>
               <p>By the time we had sufficiently admired their finery and concluded upon the course
                  to take, it was nearly sundown. We therefore climbed to the top of the hill, and
                  had a pretty extensive view of the windward side of the island. A small river or
                  creek ran out of the hills, and wound below our feet some three miles to the sea.
                  Near its mouth we fancied we saw a column of smoke, and that here and there were
                  open spots, such as we had before seen, indicating the location of fields. Once we
                  thought we heard a voice. But the sun beginning to descend into the sea, we set
                  out for our boat, though we did not exactly know where it lay. Once we stopped,
                  for we heard a deep full sound something like that made between a drum and a bell.
                  This was a plain indication that the island was inhabited. Again we came upon an
                  enclosed field in the midst of the woods, and near it saw three deer feeding,
                  which, instead of flying from us, came up and licked our hands. Then again we
                  doubted whether man frequented these solitudes. Perhaps, thought we, some hermit
                  has retired hither, or here some colony of pious females reside and make the woods
                  gentle.</p>
               <p>Traveling onward we crossed a variety of ground, and so continuing to do for an
                  hour or more, confessed that we were lost, and knew not which was north or south.
                  We then concluded to pass the night where we were, that is, under a banin tree,
                  whose branches extended several hundred feet each way. I collected several talipot
                  leaves, which at evening are closed, and are about as thick as one's arm, but in
                  the morning unfold and extend several yards; these we spread open, and getting
                  between them, slept comfortably, though we knew not what snakes or villainous
                  reptiles would be found with us in the morning; for it is well understood that
                  almost all places within the tropics are over-run with poisonous serpents and
                  insects, since, as is supposed, the heat disengages them from their embryo bonds
                  in cold clay,—clay which, even beneath the poles, is filled with quiescent seeds
                  of these loathsome creatures; but as we had seen no traces of their existence, we
                  concluded that neither tiger or anaconda was to be found on the island. When we
                  awoke we found several quarts of dew lying in the folds of the uppermost leaf, for
                  thus abundantly is it condensed from vegetation and the atmosphere during the
                  night. For breakfast we had coco-nuts and custard apples. The latter fruit
                  resembles a large pine burr, and in size is comparable to a large apple. The skin
                  is thick, and the inside is filled with seeds mixed with a yellowish pulp, closely
                  resembling soft custard; the outer part being thicker, reminded one of pie-crust.
                  It is very delicious, light of digestion, and we afterwards found was the most
                  common fruit on the island.</p>
               <p>Having held a council after breakfast, we concluded that if the island were
                  inhabited, we would find a settlement near the mouth of the creek before
                  mentioned. Mr. Squire climbing a tree to ascertain the direction thither, we
                  traveled, forward. We passed several little fields, and many harmless animals,
                  which still suffered us to approach them, and were, we concluded from this fact,
                  objects of worship; as with the ancient Egyptians, who esteemed the greater part
                  of the animal creation, from the bull-frog to the crocodile, as their divinities.
                  In about an hour we came near the sea, and finding everything quiet, began to
                  suspect ourselves the only human beings on the island, when we stepped upon a path
                  about two feet wide, strewn with leaves, and presenting here and there the prints
                  of human feet. Being thus assured, we quickened our pace, though with caution. All
                  at once we stopped, for we met a man coming towards us, who also stopped, and held
                  up his hands in astonishment. Let me here describe him.</p>
               <p>But now I am almost tempted to drop my pen, and discontinue these pages forever;
                  since I am perfectly well aware that almost every reader will think I am drawing
                  upon my imagination. Yes, and although he has followed me thus far with
                  confidence, I foresee he will revert to that which he has already read, and
                  subject that, too, to his suspicions. Nevertheless, I am constrained to finish
                  that which I have begun; and I request the reader, once for all, to surrender
                  himself to my plain narrative. Still if he suspects that he is reading a fiction,
                  I have only to say I cannot help it; and that though not old yet, I have lived to
                  see many apparent wrongs become great blessings; and I have also seen some hung
                  for murder, who were afterwards proved to be innocent.</p>
               <p>The person of this native, then, was not black, but of an orange, or reddish
                  complexion. He was naked, except as regards sandals, yet I could discover no signs
                  of sex. His face, amidst astonishment, expressed kindness. His form was partly
                  common to male and female, that is to say, his features were effeminate, and his
                  hair long, but bending around the ears, was done up on the back of the head in a
                  flattish knot; while his neck rose from his shoulders in that angle and
                  inclination which we see so often in women. His chest was full and broad, it had
                  neither breast or nipple, or any kind of deformity. His limbs were not large, but
                  were muscular and well proportioned. As it was my duty to act for the rest, I
                  stepped forward, and clapping him on the shoulder, saluted him in the Malaya
                  language in a few words, that signified Peace be with us; and also bid my
                  companions not fear, but act like men. The native now came to himself, kissed me
                  in a brotherly way, and in the meantime spoke many, words in a strange language.
                  Then he skipped from one to another of us, took our hands in his, bowed, smiled,
                  and turned around half dancing. However, he concluded his performances in a short
                  time, by making signs that we should follow him. At a little distance we came to
                  where several paths met, but following on, we entered one a great deal broader,
                  and which was, in fact, one of the main thoroughfares, being about forty paces
                  wide, yet it was overshadowed by a lofty canopy of branches; for in distant ages
                  two rows of mahogany trees had been planted on each side, and now united overhead.
                  In the distance we saw an edifice stretching among the trees, and many people
                  sauntering in their shade, which was so unexpected a sight, and I might say, so
                  uncommon on any island in the Pacific ocean, that we imagined we had been conveyed
                  to some Burman country, and were approaching a temple of Vishnu, or the hallowed
                  precincts of the Grand Lama. This, however, we knew was not the case, and we could
                  only remain in suspense till we should become better acquainted with the island
                  and its inhabitants. When we were come near to the building, we began to attract
                  attention; one and another flew toward us, and we finally stopped near a little
                  stream, which crossed the avenue in front of the building. Immediately a cry
                  resounded through the neighborhood, and was repeated in many parts of the woods
                  upon which multitudes streamed into every part of the avenue, and forth from the
                  edifice. Afterwards we learned there was no account of any event having occurred
                  among them for many ages, so important as that of our arrival. The numbers
                  becoming great, many climbed the trees to gaze upon us, while others, by turns,
                  stood upon each other's shoulders. When they began to crowd us, I made signs that
                  they should keep their distance; for although I saw we were as much the subjects
                  of curiosity as was Columbus<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7230-00000012"/> on his first
                  landing, yet I thought best to take a proper course at the commencement,
                  particularly as I knew not what kind of people they might prove to be. Accordingly
                  they stood back, and being thus in the midst of a great crowd, no ways
                  embarrassed—for one who has been a political man need never be frightened by an
                  assembly gazing upon him,—I examined them more particularly than I had the one who
                  first accosted us, and made a new discovery; that is, they were beings without
                  sex, and consequently without certain organs, but over the whole surface of the
                  abdomen, and along the back or flanks, there were certain longitudinal openings,
                  or pores, so to speak, from a sixteenth to a half an inch in length, having
                  alternate elevations and depressions, which evidently perform the office of
                  excretion, and may not be improperly compared to a fish's gills, though not as
                  being exactly the same; and further, they were set across each other in the manner
                  of squares on a chess-board, yet lying so close in the cuticle, marred not the
                  appearance, indeed at a short distance were undistinguishable; still, on the
                  whole, we were not less surprised at their appearance, than they were at ours. And
                  now by a species of magnetism, though I am by no means pleased with the word, we
                  began to have great confidence in the natives, and suffered one or two at a time
                  to approach us, and examine our persons; and in particular, an elderly fellow,
                  with grayish hair, who raised my arm to a level with his face, and peeping under
                  the sleeve, saw a great part of the naked limb, and with the utmost assurance, and
                  yet with respect, if such an action may imply respect, put his hands in my bosom,
                  and forced them between my shirt and skin, through to my back bone. He raised up
                  my foot, and examined my boot, and run his hand down my stocking. He took off my
                  hat, and smoothed my beard, which I grant needed shaving. He put his hand in my
                  pocket, and was proceeding even farther, but seeing I resented such familiarity,
                  he desisted, and retiring a little way, spoke some time to the multitude, as
                  though he were relating the result of his investigations. My comrades, who had
                  submitted to a like investigation, were becoming tired of exhibiting themselves,
                  and desired me to bring matters to a conclusion. Accordingly, seeing something
                  like a chair near the root of a tree, I mounted it, and in a few words stated who
                  we were, and whence we came. Then I told them with all my command of gesture, that
                  we must depend upon them for assistance, cast away as we were, and that if they
                  treated us well, we would make suitable returns, but that if they attempted any
                  treachery, they might in time find their island too hot to hold them.</p>
               <p>All this they received in good part, nodding and smiling, and repeating two or
                  three particular words, which we interpreted into their delight at becoming our
                  obedient servants. At last, being tired with so much ceremony, and perceiving that
                  the sun was descending beyond the trees, we signified that we were hungry, and
                  would like something to eat. Understanding this, they took us into a large room,
                  and seated us on some striped mats behind a low table, which ran entirely around
                  the room. In a few minutes, provisions were brought in by a great number of youths
                  and children, and placed on the table, which being done, a signal was given by one
                  crying, at the main entrance, when the mats were filled by the natives, and a
                  general meal commenced. The food consisted mostly of fruits, though we had very
                  good bread, being baked breadfruit, which is light and porous, and has much the
                  taste of rye and indian; but we noticed that our part of the table was much better
                  furnished than where the natives sat, for we had several little dishes of
                  sweet-meats, rice puddings, and preserved jack-eyes, while they seemed contented
                  with coco, plantain, and the custard apple, though it was little they ate on
                  account of having their eyes constantly turned towards us. As regards meat, there
                  was none on the table, nor did these people ever eat it, as we afterwards learned,
                  since they accounted the habit, not a crime, but more befitting a shark than a
                  human being, showing what wild notions people come to entertain when they are shut
                  out from the light of the Gospel and civilization. After we had eaten, we
                  collected together at the front entrance, while the natives mostly retired to
                  another apartment, leaving many youths and children eating and gazing upon us. We
                  now concluded among ourselves that the natives were harmless and inoffensive, and
                  that as regards refinement and knowledge, they would compare with the ancient
                  Mexicans or Peruvians.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young and myself having a curiosity to get familiar with the, location of the
                  place, and the shape and size of the building, took a walk to the beach, which lay
                  through a strip of forest about fifty rods wide. We entered upon a broad avenue
                  running along the bank of the river, and presently came to the beach which was
                  broad and smooth, and composed of white hard sand, and being very low, the waves
                  ran a long distance after they broke. Crossing the mouth of the river, though it
                  was little larger than a creek, on a rude foot bridge, we returned by the other
                  side, obtaining meanwhile a view of the edifice which made us think we were
                  approaching an ancient Peruvian city. This building was three hundred and
                  seventy-two feet long, as we afterwards ascertained, with a wing at each
                  extremity, and at the centre, eighty-four by twenty-eight feet, all of one story,
                  built of unburned brick, yet of such antiquity as to have a dark brown color.
                  Seventy feet from each and arose two square towers eighty feet in height, and at
                  the extremity of each wing were three other towers eighteen feet in height. Over
                  the walls in many places, a creeping vine, bearing here and there a crimson berry,
                  had been suffered to run, and the tendrils having firmly fixed themselves between
                  the bricks, gave to the place an air of comfort and great age. The sun had set in
                  the ocean by the time we were opposite the edifice, and as we stopped to view its
                  proportions, a large drum was struck in the western tower, indicating, according
                  to custom, the close of day; and though the sound was astonishing in loudness, it
                  was not unmusical. When it ceased, we crossed the stream by a bridge wide enough
                  for a carriage Way, though of course carriages were unknown on the island, and at
                  a place where the stream was precipitated in a fall of twenty feet. Several small
                  houses, not unlike shops, were located in a little valley below the fall, and I
                  perceived two or three rude water wheels turned by a portion of the stream
                  conveyed along the bank in wooden spouts. On the left, near the bridge, was an
                  enclosure of some twenty acres, which evidently was a garden, although it
                  contained a great many trees. A flight of steps, or, more properly, a mound, led
                  into this garden, and seeing some remarkably fine fruit we desired to enter, but
                  as darkness approached we returned to the edifice, not knowing but that meantime
                  our companions had met with some misfortune. However, we found them at the main
                  entrance, among a crowd of natives, and both parties apparently in some kind of
                  frolic. They put me in mind of those young and inexperienced people who become
                  very gay and attractive on their first meeting. One of the old natives now
                  conducted us into a series of rooms, three in number, which they signified were to
                  be our apartments. It being nearly dark, a couple of lamps with two prongs, filled
                  with coco oil, were brought in, when many of the natives came and shook us by the
                  hand and retired, pronouncing a few words which we interpreted their good night,
                  particularly when they pointed to some couches, and imitated the posture of a
                  sleeping person. Several children came in and presented us various little gifts of
                  fruits and flowers, and some trifles which we took to be their playthings, and
                  falling on their knees, kissed our hands and retired. We were now exceedingly
                  curious in looking around upon every thing pertaining to the furnishing of the
                  rooms, for feeling quite secure and extremely comfortable in our quarters, our
                  curiosity rose to the highest pitch. We were at an immense distance from home,
                  among a people who could scarcely be said to belong to the human race, and hence
                  we inspected every thing before us as though endeavoring to convince ourselves
                  that we had not been conveyed, in some unaccountable manner, to a distant planet.
                  There were chairs not much unlike ours, with rattan seats, and two or three teak
                  wood tables. The beds, on which we were to sleep, were<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000013"/> composed of cotton, placed on movable frames, or
                  bed-steads, about two feet high. They were calculated for one person each, and
                  resembled the lounges of our own country. There were bed clothes with which one
                  might be covered, and curtains before the lattices made of coarse cotton woven as
                  our own cloth is woven. The partition walls were of bamboo, filled, where they
                  were joined with a species of cement so as to be very tight; the doors were of
                  some kind of wood in many pieces, jointed together accurately, and hung with
                  copper hinges. The floor, also of bamboo, was covered with a fringed mat of the
                  size of the room. Our apartments were connected with each other by interior doors
                  and very much resembled each other in size and furniture. I should not neglect to
                  add that every article was clean and sweet. The lattices being somewhat in the
                  fashion of Venetian blinds opened into plats of grass and dwarf shrubbery,
                  afforded thence a view of the strip of forest between us and the ocean, and indeed
                  not unfrequently of the comb of a billow before it fell. At ten o'clock the drums
                  were struck again, and as there was a general movement among the natives, we
                  concluded it to be a signal for retiring to rest. Upon this hint we barricaded our
                  doors, selected our coaches, and were soon laid quietly asleep.</p>
               <p>Thus it was we were introduced into a simple state of society, on an island of
                  perpetual spring, where, by some favorable concurrence, both pestilential jungles
                  and venomous reptiles were unknown, and where man had apparently lived from
                  remotest antiquity in a round of simple pleasures, and in a state of remarkable
                  inactivity.</p>
               <p>We awoke quite early, and yet found that the natives had been up sometime; and
                  were then collected in an assembly room, considering, as we afterwards learned,
                  what sort of beings we were; and adopting some general regulations concerning us,
                  two in particular being, that certain of their number, which might be called a
                  committee, should conduct us to such rooms, and such parts of their domain, as
                  might gratify our curiosity, and also superintend the cooking of our victuals, to
                  the end that we might be supplied with food that suited us best, and to serve it
                  in a small room adjoining our apartments, for it seems they accounted us as
                  superior beings out of the sea, entitled to peculiar marks of favor. Agreeably to
                  this arrangement, our breakfast was set in the designated dining room, to which we
                  applied ourselves with renewed appetites. During the meal, I felt somewhat vexed,
                  to see Mr. Young seize upon the choice conserves and prepared fruits with such a
                  hoggish avidity, that he scarcely left me a taste of a peculiarly rich dish, of
                  what resembled peaches and cream, and indeed, the rest of my companions were
                  little behind him; but it afterwards occurred to me, that they acted as though
                  they were free from my superintendence at the table, as at sea, and being at
                  liberty, acted somewhat like enfranchised slaves, or apprentices at a tavern. But,
                  perhaps, this statement had better not been made. However, there was a plenty to
                  eat, and that which was good, and we could but see that the purveyors had taken no
                  little pains to anticipate our tastes.</p>
               <p>Sometime after breakfast, the committee, rightly judging that we would be pleased
                  to see the interior of the edifice, conducted us to its various rooms. Of these
                  there were about two hundred, resembling those we occupied. There was also a
                  general dining room, besides several smaller ones, and two or three public or
                  assembly rooms, where they were went to meet, and discuss such topics of business,
                  or intellectual research, as their minds were capable of comprehending. There was
                  also a room where the children were instructed, and in a great measure by one
                  another, that is, on the monitorial, or as we would say, the Lancasterian plan;
                  the oldest turning to a younger one, and this one to another still younger, and so
                  on down, a method which has some pretty ways about, but as regards securing real
                  application, of no account whatever. As regards the alphabet and grammar of their
                  language, I shall speak of it hereafter. Of course they understood not the art of
                  printing, and their writings were upon palm and talipot leaves. We were conducted
                  into the children's sleeping apartments, which included fourteen different rooms,
                  of three beds or cots in each room, for as they had no parents, properly so
                  considered, they were not attached to any particular person, though we afterwards
                  learned, that there were those, who through life, have great affection for such or
                  such a one, from their very infancy; but of this relation, if it may be so
                  considered, I was never very clearly informed. The sleeping rooms of those
                  advanced in life, were in the towers immediately above those occupied by the
                  children, having tubes connecting therewith, to the end that decaying nature might
                  be reinvigorated by the respirations of youth. I was particularly interested in
                  visiting the kitchen, which was the largest and best arranged room which we saw.
                  There were several copper kettles set in an arch, and a capacious even for baking
                  fruits, which thereby are made very delicious and wholesome, and the self-grown
                  bread. The utensils and vessels were all, of copper, and perfectly bright and
                  clean. I was pleased in observing a conduit of fresh water constantly running,
                  being brought, as we afterwards observed, in earthen pipes, from a large spring,
                  more than a mile distant.</p>
               <p>Then we visited the work-shops in the valley. Here we were amused at the clumsy
                  machinery, and tools they had in use for the manufacture of their cabinet ware,
                  copper vessels, &amp;c.; and yet, we could but admire their ingenuity in doing so
                  much with such a soft metal as copper, the use of iron being wholly unknown. I
                  took out my pocket knife, which was a mere jack knife, though I had a good pearl
                  handled one besides, but it was of good stuff, and opening it, handed it to one of
                  the chief workmen. He was much surprised with it, as well as every one in the
                  shop, and when they saw the working of the spring, they were afraid of it,
                  particularly when in opening and shutting it, several cut their fingers. I might
                  remark, that a few days afterwards, I caused our boat to be broken up for the sake
                  of the iron, out of which several knives were made, which though only iron, were
                  vastly superior to anything they possessed.</p>
               <p>Finally, we visited the garden. Here grew every variety of fruit which is found
                  within the tropics. But it is remarkable how much their size and flavor were
                  increased by cultivation. The oranges, for instance, were double the size ever
                  found with us, and were as sweet and refreshing, as one can imagine. Nothing was
                  suffered to grow in this garden, but what had been propagated from superior stock,
                  for their gardeners understood grafting and budding to perfection, and the clean,
                  gravely soil was from time to time covered with fallen fruit, of more than two
                  hundred and fifty varieties. Besides, such vegetables as were eaten by the
                  natives, were cultivated in beds and rows, and in great abundance, while elegant
                  shrubs and flowers filled studied vacancies. Many little streams were let into
                  this garden out of the river, at some distance above, and the well swept alleys
                  ran side by side with the rivulets, for the ground had been so chosen and managed,
                  that the water was conducted to any point, and it was not rare to see two streams
                  near together running in opposite directions. It being the cool of the day, when
                  we visited this spot, the gardeners were busy in attending to their particular
                  branches; while a great number of the natives, who had been occupied during the
                  heat of the day, in the kitchens and shops, walked in the shady places, or
                  reclined on bamboo settees, near collections of water.</p>
               <p>In all oriental countries, gardens have been favorite places of resort, and by the
                  poor have been accounted paradises, in which they will lead lives of luxury when
                  they become rich. Gardens are the scenes of many pleasant and eventful stories; it
                  was there the Califs erected their seraglios and pleasure houses, there the
                  learned meditated, there the magician called up the Genii of the air and sea, and
                  there too, our first parents heard "the voice of God, walking in the cool of the
                  day."</p>
               <p>When we returned to the edifice, our conductors left us, and we were surrendered
                  to ourselves in the assembly room, which was on the western side, where the front
                  being formed of folding doors, was quite open, and presented the<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000014"/> appearance of a vast piazza. Here seventy or eighty
                  natives were collected, and when entered, they arose from their settees, in which
                  they had been reclining, the weather; being warm, and crowded around us,
                  manifesting a great deal of curiosity as regards our clothing and bodies. They
                  peeped into our bosoms, and up our arms, lifted up our legs, tried to put their
                  hands into our pockets, (even my watch was less a curiosity than myself,) stroked
                  our beards, and felt of the cloth of our garments between their fingers, as if
                  considering whether it might not be flesh, and a part of our bodies. As I was in a
                  sort of fantastic humor, which comes over me sometimes, notwithstanding my
                  principles and profession, and which emboldens me to do things another would
                  scarcely do,—having for its cause, a sense of humor which lies deep in my nature,
                  and as the air was quite sultry, I determined to put an end to their curiosity. I
                  directed them to stand aside, this they repeated in English, and at the same time
                  in their own tongue, for thus early we had began to learn each other's language,
                  and pulling-off my coat, laid it down. The natives started, and seizing it in
                  their hands, satisfied themselves that it was only cloth. Then I took off my vest,
                  and they lifted up their hands. Presently, I unbuttoned my suspenders, then
                  slipped my pantaloons over my heels, and turning quite around in my shirt, planted
                  my heel with a flourish upon the floor. Seeing that I was in a familiar mood, they
                  seized me, and stripped off my shirt, and saw all they could or wanted to see, for
                  by the time I had recovered myself, they had vanished from the room. Afterwards
                  they told us, that they thought we did right in clothing our bodies; and
                  afterwards they too, wore clothes, but it was not without tears, and sorrowful
                  retrospection that eventually they became,—but I will not anticipate the order of
                  events.</p>
               <p>By the time I dressed myself it was six o'clock, when a drum was struck, and
                  immediately after several other drums. These were hung, they were not only in all
                  the towers, but one above another, differing in tone, and hence they were enabled
                  to produce a peal, or, I might say, a succession of notes, either grave or gay,
                  according to the occasion. Frequently an air or tune was played, which, though
                  simple, was quite pleasing to those accustomed to it. Perceiving the natives
                  assembling under an old banin tree nearly opposite, we went forth, when the
                  committee assigned us a place near nine musicians, who presently struck up a
                  simple and lively air with their instruments, and, beating time a few minutes with
                  their feet, marched forward towards the sea. Thereupon the whole population, old
                  and young, formed into ranks of eight abreast, and marched after them in compact
                  and regular order. We were curious in observing their instruments, and noticed
                  that they had two kinds of flutes, one high and one low, a triangle, a species of
                  clarionette, a tenor and bass drum, a bassoon, and a bugle-horn of immense size
                  and extraordinary loud piercing sound, as it should have had, since it had two
                  mouthpieces and was played by two persons. The drums in the towers meanwhile
                  accompanied them, so that the very sky seemed filled with music. My comrades were
                  much elated, and I, myself, thought of the days when I was young and followed the
                  militia on training day. When they reached the beach they did not stop, but
                  marched directly into the waves, and, diving forward, were presently scattered in
                  the water. As their bodies were lighter than ours, being filled with air-cells, so
                  to speak, it was quite impossible they should sink, and, for a short distance,
                  they could run, on the top of the water; hence, they could swim with the greatest
                  ease. Frequently they lay in a billow that was approaching the shore, but before
                  it broke they darted away with the velocity of a swift fish, and they performed a
                  variety of evolutions in the water, such as would correspond with our marching and
                  countermarching, but to us on the shore, they were as undistinguishable as the
                  motions of the fishes themselves, since they were, for the most part, deep in the
                  water, nor arose oftener than once in five or six minutes to take breath. Mr.
                  Young said they reminded him very much of the mermaids, or folks of the sea, and
                  while we were seated under a tree a little ways off, he branched out in art idle
                  dream concerning these fabulous creatures.</p>
               <p>He said that, though of late years almost every one doubted whether such beings
                  existed, he, himself, was not quite so sure that the ancients who believed in them
                  under another name, were wholly in an error. And it stands to reason, too,
                  somewhat, for as the sea encompasses three-fourths of the surface of the globe,
                  why is it wonderful that another, and, perhaps, a higher, or, he was contented to
                  say, a lower race of mankind ruled the vast dominions of the, sea, having whales,
                  sharks, sea-horses, and sea-lions, and the great sea-serpent himself subject to
                  their authority, the same as horses, elephants, and the like, are to ours. This
                  being assumed, they are created so as to breathe the water as well as air, or,
                  perhaps may breathe the air only for a short time, unless it is mixed with spray
                  flying upon the wind, and, by consequence, they had been subject to the power
                  which had created them, as are all other creatures, great and small, whether we
                  known it or not; and had resolved themselves into communities, and had created
                  churches, separate habitations, and cities and temples out of the materials which
                  must lie in great abundance in the bottom of the sea, being torn from submarine
                  mountains and precipices, and with no lack of gold or gems, which the water
                  naturally dissolves out of the rocks and the craggy steeps; and, according to a
                  natural necessity, had compacted a social system, which he doubted not was
                  superior to our own, or else, he said, with some disdain, they would be a foolish
                  race indeed. As to those stories which we read, of certain women of this race who
                  sit upon the rocks by the shore when some young man, idle, and not knowing in what
                  way to exert the superabundant aspirations of ambition and of youthful longings,
                  passing by hears her sing sweetly, and turning, beholds a fair woman displaying
                  just enough of her charms to make him beside himself, he thought not so very
                  improbable; but whether she were of a higher or lower class of mermaids, our
                  ignorance of the race must leave undetermined; yet, if he were to decide, he might
                  presume her to be some damsel in distress, or, at least, one ignorant of what duty
                  required, or, perhaps, one satiated with her former courses pines for a new
                  object, and there, sitting upon the rock, combs her long hair and sings with such
                  a sweet voice as must needs enrapture whoever is so unfortunate, or, perhaps, so
                  highly favored as to listen.</p>
               <p>By the time he had concluded with these and some other fancies the drums in the
                  towers struck up, when the natives swam to the beach, and forming again as before,
                  returned to the edifice. Such was their daily custom, and one that had continued
                  from earliest ages, for since their food passes off wholly by perspiration, they
                  were convinced, and properly enough too, that to Buffer the pores to become filled
                  with excretions, and the dust and sweat naturally accumulating in this hot
                  climate, was little less than to solicit self-destruction; and besides, it was
                  highly refreshing to them thus to bathe in the sea, and then retire from the heat
                  and glare of the day, and the consequence was they remained cool a long time
                  afterwards, and enjoyed refreshing slumber. It was customary, too, at other times,
                  for such, as chose, to dive into the sea, particularly those who had been engaged
                  in labor, and it was seldom that some one of their number could not be seen rising
                  and plunging in the thickest of the breakers.</p>
               <p>This evening my companions and I concluded to make every effort to learn the
                  native language, as it seemed quite impossible that at present we should have any
                  opportunity for returning home, even if we desired, as was becoming a subject of
                  conversation with two or three of us, and being thus forced to dwell among these
                  people, it was our duty to learn to speak their tongue, nor would we fail to find
                  both entertainment and instruction thereby. Mr. Norris said that, for his part he
                  did not care about returning home. It was true, he was in the prime of life, and
                  that he had laid up several hundred dollars with the intention of getting him a
                  wife and enjoying himself, if enjoyment might be found in the wedded state; but on
                  the whole he thought he might go through life without a wife; indeed he had his
                  doubts about the superior happiness of the married state, though he knew it seemed
                  to be natural for a man to desire it. And there were many other natural desires
                  quite as common, such as the desire for riches, great<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000015"/> name, fine clothes, and a striking appearance,
                  which philosophers and Christiana of all; ages, he had been told, had decided not
                  at all necessary for happiness, but were opposed to it; and besides, the
                  matrimonial state put him in mind of the ocean which, at one time is clear and
                  smooth, and one is led to suppose that it will be always so, but presently a storm
                  arises, and the waters are thrown into a condition most dreadful to behold.
                  Nevertheless and moreover, Mr. Norris continued, he would be better pleased if
                  there were even an inferior race of women on the island to keep us in subjection,
                  though, perhaps, not such as are found in the Sandwich Islands, who, when a nail
                  or a bit of iron is thrown into the sea, will dive from the yard-arm after it, or
                  who, poor souls, for any other European trinket will do almost any thing a sailor
                  may request them to do. But be all this as it might be, he was contented to stay
                  on the island, since it was the finest kind of a place he ever was in. There was
                  neither captain nor owner to domineer over him, and, as far as he could see, one
                  man was almost as good as another, and if there were no women he was not troubled
                  about their wings; he had good accommodations, and plenty to eat and nothing to
                  do, though he was not opposed to turning his hand, now and then, to some kind of
                  work, for lie was not above earning his living the world around.</p>
               <p>Mr. Squire said he had no notion of staying on the Island; for, in the first
                  place, he could not live without meat, and if he could he would not: no, he was
                  bound to go back. Things were too dull for him. And neither was he a Shaker, he
                  would have us to know; still he was contented to stay, since he was obliged to,
                  and learn all he could, and then, when he got home, he could talk in a foreign
                  language as well as any scholar, and would have some of the most interesting
                  stories to tell that any body ever heard or read. Another reason why he was not
                  going to stay was, because he had a wife at home who depended on him for support,
                  though she lived on a little farm, off from which she might get a tolerable
                  living—even the rent of it he had calculated would support her. He said that he
                  had sometimes threatened he would run away and leave her, and never come back,
                  then she could see who her best friend was—then she would remember how she had
                  abused him (though he could scarcely tell as regards what), and she might shed as
                  many tears as she liked, it would be of no use, she would never see him again. But
                  he had no intentions of really doing any such thing; he only wanted to bring her
                  into subjection, and he was glad to say that all he said had not the least effect
                  upon her—she only told him to go. If he were only back again he said he should be
                  glad, or if he could be with her two nights and one day, or even one night and
                  part of a day, he would be gratified. He granted she was not over and above
                  handsome, but she loved him at the bottom of her heart; and, after all, he doubted
                  whether many women, considering how much work she had done, would make a better
                  appearance if she were dressed up and had a chance to put her best foot foremost.
                  When she was a girl, there were few in the meeting-house could compare with her.
                  Her cheeks were rosy, her lips red, her hair black, and her waist small; but he
                  corrected himself for mentioning such things, though being so far away it was
                  natural, for him at least, to run over all the pleasing appearances she had ever
                  put on, while, at the same time, it was quite impossible for him to recollect that
                  she had ever said or done any thing amiss. Then again, Mr. Squire said he had a
                  boy and girl at home, of three and five years of age;—but here he stopped
                  speaking, and, putting one of his hands over his eyes, we saw several tears drop
                  down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Griffith said he was an unmarried man, because nobody would have him; but, as
                  he was good looking, though a little dark-skinned, active in all his motions, and
                  as capable of commanding a ship as myself, and was only sailing under me to get a
                  more complete form of taking observations, it was evident he concealed the state
                  of his heart under these words; but I knew how things stood with him, for he
                  himself had told me; that is briefly; to say there were two sisters, in
                  Northampton, Mass, his native place, living near Hulbert's pond, on the
                  Connecticut necticut Meadows, one of whom fell in love with him, while he fell in
                  love with the other. The latter married a man who misused her; the former pined
                  away, and finally died of consumption. Therefore, he continued, he was not much
                  attached to his country on account of women, and, as the island seemed a very
                  comfortable residence for one whose ambition was limited to leading a quiet life,
                  it suited him very well, so that it was likely he would lay his bones in so me, of
                  these woods; for he had sailed every ocean, thrown the lead in every sound, and
                  visited every seaport from Archangel to New Orleans; he had eaten birds' nests
                  with Chinese chop-sticks, ran a mook with Malays, sopped his crackers in train oil
                  in Greenland, gnawed kangaroos in New Holland, swallowed curry and rice with the
                  Burmen, pointed his cannon at the cowardly slaver off Madagascar and the Guinea
                  coast, gazed at Vesuvius and Etna, sighed among Roman Ruins, flirted with red,
                  black, and brown girls the world over, and sung hymns in the gallery of a New
                  England meeting-house. He had read some books—he was a confirmed bachelor, and, on
                  the whole, thought he would enjoy himself as well here as any where else. Life is
                  a certain round, said he, and, when that is run, we have it to run over again; and
                  here, out of the gripe of knaves, he was indifferent whether he saw the world
                  again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young said he had seen a great deal of trouble in his day, although he was
                  scarcely in his thirty-third year. He had been bashful in early life, but
                  latterly, he cared little for the applause or contempt of men; still, as he felt
                  friendly towards us, it would perhaps take away some of the sting of his feelings
                  to let us know how unfortunate he had been, and besides, thereby, he would set us
                  an excellent example to be free with one another, for he believed that much
                  depended upon our sustaining the most friendly relations through our little
                  company; which, however, was a remark unnecessary to make, since the captain had
                  several times impressed it upon us.</p>
               <p>He said he was born in Western New York of parents extremely poor, who, though
                  upright, and possessing good minds, from several minor causes were not held in
                  high esteem, and, by consequence, he grew up among his mates as an underling.
                  Feeling very much dispirited through all his boyhood on this account, he left home
                  at the age of thirteen, or rather ran away, for he refused to return, and went as
                  cabin-boy in the steamboat Superior, on Lake Erie. He had great difficulty in
                  getting this place, and indeed, previously, served some time as scullion, washing
                  knives and forks and doing dirty work—for, being poorly clad and extremely modest,
                  he was subject to the sneers of the low and unfeeling; however, after a little, he
                  fell into the good graces of the officers, and was appointed to wait on the table
                  and attend in the cabins. During the winter of the first year of his absence he
                  lived in the Captain's family, at Detroit, and the next season went on the boat in
                  his former capacity, and became a favorite with the officers and crew on account
                  of his obliging behavior and agreeable ways; and thus he spent several years. Ever
                  afterwards he looked back on these seasons with a satisfaction attached to no
                  other period of his life. For he was well dressed and had plenty to eat, his
                  labors were light, and he continually came in contact with ladies and gentlemen,
                  so that his manners became polished. The steward of the boat was a widower, and a
                  grave and pious man, and yet not without a certain pleasing and becoming gaiety;
                  he took Mr. Young under his charge of his own accord, and gave him such an impulse
                  to lead a higher life that it continued with him to that day. And now he took a
                  pleasure in reading. Books of some kind were always lying within reach, belonging
                  to some of the officers or passengers, and thus he spent many summer hours when
                  unemployed in a particular seat, whence he had a view of the Ohio shores, or of
                  the islands, Cunningham's, the Basses, Put-in-Bay or the Three Sisters, as the
                  case might be, and his mind was elevated to a state of great enjoyment.</p>
               <p>There was to a man of the name of Stores living in Boston, Mass., who was a
                  passenger on the boat several times since being an extensive landholder in Ohio<pb
                     n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7230-00000016"/> and Michigan, he was forced to go thither
                  once or twice, a year on business connected with his property. As Mr. Stores was a
                  reading man and always had books along, Horatio, according to custom, borrowed
                  them of him, and this occurring several times for three years in succession, Mr.
                  Stores became interested in him, ascertained his history, and finally took him
                  home and sent him to school with the intention of giving him a complete education.
                  Mr. Young accordingly improved this opportunity to the utmost, and at last
                  graduated at Cambridge University. About this time Mr. Stores married his second
                  wife. She was a rich lady, handsome, accomplished, and twenty-three years of age.
                  To make this part of a long and extremely painful story short, said Mr. Young, a
                  story which never should had a beginning, they fell in love with one another, and,
                  after several months spent between love and enjoyment, ran away. They went to
                  Sandusky in Ohio, and thence crossed over to Put-in-Bay Island. Here there were
                  but few houses, the scenery was quite wild, the shores being precipitous, and the
                  forest of cedar, oak, and hickory growing to the very edge. There is a large cave
                  here which presents some curiosities, and frequently attracts visitors. After they
                  had been here about three months, a steamboat stopped on a certain day to take in
                  wood, when whom should Mr. Young see but Mr. Stores coming up towards the house
                  where they boarded. It seems that he had ascertained where they were, and when he
                  knocked they were extremely frightened, and would have fled had there been time,
                  but some one of the folks opened the door, when he entered, and inquiring for them
                  came immediately into their room. And now instead of being angry, he said he was
                  happy to see them, and shaking their hands, took a seat quite at ease. He was well
                  dressed, so also were Mr. Young and his lady, if such a term were proper to use;
                  but as if determined not to be embarrassing, Mr. Stores remarked that they had a
                  very romantic situation, and hoped they enjoyed themselves in this quiet retreat.
                  Mr. Young, not to be outdone, entered into conversation, and spoke of the
                  pleasantness of so many islands being at once in sight from the window where he
                  sat, and referring to the cave, offered to accompany him thither. But the bell
                  then beginning to ring, Mr. Stores said he must defer that pleasure for the
                  present, and departed with the invitation that if ever they should come to Boston
                  they must not fail to call upon him. So saying, he went aboard and presently was
                  sailing away. Mr. Young and Mrs. Stores stood by the window some time, and at last
                  threw themselves into each other's arms, quite overcome with such unexpected
                  treatment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young said that they intended to stay on the island through the winter, but it
                  proved to be a very wild and lonesome place, for the shores were frozen in by a
                  vast circumference of ice, when all communication was cut off with the main land;
                  and then again, when there came a thaw, which happened about once a month, the
                  strong south wind heaped the ice, which groaned and crashed by night and day in a
                  terrible manner, and frequently seemed, while they were abed, as though a thousand
                  wagons were driven fiercely over as many bridges, so that they were happy to seize
                  upon a time when the weather was fair and the water smooth, to pass over to
                  Sandusky, between seams of ice, and on large solid pieces, assisted by the two
                  farmers who lived on the island.</p>
               <p>They traveled into the Southern States, abode a short time at Louisville, but
                  finally, in February, landed at New Orleans, and enjoyed themselves in the best
                  manner they could by visiting the few memorable places, the theatres, and
                  racecourses, and the gay inhabitants of certain streets in the vicinity of the old
                  cemetery. They had a plenty of 'money, for Mrs. Stores had several houses in
                  Boston, in her own hands, and a considerable ready funds; nevertheless they
                  quarreled about trifles, till at last, Mr. Young beginning to have poor health,
                  became soured in disposition, and suspected he was throwing away his years of
                  improvement. Things now took a turn different from what they had ever imagined,
                  that is, they began to talk of separating, or, at least, of getting married, and
                  sailing away to some remote country. In April, however, Mrs. Stores was taken
                  sick, for the climate did not agree with her, and they returned to the Northern
                  States, and quietly settled themselves in a village near Newark, New Jersey. Here
                  her health improved slightly, but afterwards she settled into a decline, and
                  finally, in January following, expired in his arms.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young continued by saying that this event quite overcame him. He now saw
                  himself pretty much the same as ruined, not but what there were abundant
                  opportunities for him to exert himself, and even to make a figure in the world,
                  but with a matured mind, aided by several books which he came across, although
                  denounced by some people as subversive of religion, he saw how unjust he had been,
                  not only to society and to his fellow-men but to himself, and how much he deserved
                  some especial judgment, hence he could not think that he would prosper in any
                  course of life he might adopt. However, one should never despair, for years bring
                  great changes, men forget, he himself would forget, and the world is always
                  rushing to a fatal termination of its wealth and glory. He took his little
                  daughter, which he scarcely dared to speak of, to his father's house, and left her
                  in charge of his mother, with directions that she should be well brought up, for
                  which purpose he invested several thousand dollars in government securities and in
                  her name, the "interest of which was regularly to be paid for her support, and
                  going into the State of Indiana, commenced the practice of law, as he had
                  previously intended.</p>
               <p>Contrary to his expectations, business pressed upon him, and a brilliant course of
                  life was apparently before him. But again, his health was impaired, and at the
                  same time falling into some reflections touching society, assisted by certain
                  treatises, he looked with pain on the miseries and follies of mankind,
                  particularly as they could scarcely arise from any other cause than that of the
                  very unjust relations which man sustains to man, he determined to throw up his
                  profession, or at least to take a voyage at sea, when, if possible, his mind might
                  become reconciled, and his health restored. But he said he must not conclude his
                  account without speaking of his daughter. She was eight years old when he
                  departed, and was likely to make another such a woman as her mother in personal
                  attractions, but he doubted not that his own mother would instil into her mind
                  such principles as would make her an ornament to her sex. For now his parents had
                  become reasonably well off, they had a pleasant situation in a village that had
                  grown up around them, with schools and churches near by, and when he rode away in
                  the stage, early in the morning, and bade adieu to his little girl at the window,
                  he would have settled, in the village, but he bethought himself of his weak lungs,
                  and remained firm in his resolution. Finally, he said he had the good or ill
                  fortune to be a passenger in the Romeo, and, on the whole, cared but little if he
                  spent his days on the island.</p>
               <p>I, myself, then remarked that they all seemed very well pleased with the natives,
                  but I suspected that the time would come, in which they would not be carried away
                  so easily by appearances. Now, they did not reflect, that these people, although
                  having some few notions of mechanics, and perhaps a literature of a few wild songs
                  and some erroneous maxims, were nevertheless a savage people. For consider, said
                  I, they have no government, not even a monarchy; consequently they have no
                  officers of state or any of those numerous dependents which form the pride of
                  every civilized nation. Neither have they any religion, for they neither keep the
                  Sabbath nor have a house of worship. They have perhaps some idea of a God handed
                  down to them by tradition, but it must be very imperfect since it has not led them
                  to establish either law or government. They are also without family ties; for
                  since they are without sex how can they have: or, if they were male and female,
                  this relation would be extinguished, since they live in a huddle; and in fact, so
                  far as I could see they lived like brutes. As to the manner by which they
                  reproduce themselves, I was not prepared to speak, but we would soon be
                  enlightened on this point, and would find it to be<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000017"/> no great mystery, though perhaps a curiosity worthy
                  of a few pages in a Medical Journal. Therefore, on the whole, it would be very
                  slothful in us to sit down contented with a band of savages, merely because, as
                  one of us had said, there was a plenty to eat and nothing to do. But, said I,
                  rising and taking a turn across the room, there is a vast field of activity before
                  us, and if we choose to enter upon it by giving these people correct notions of
                  religion, government, science, and literature, we will find enough to do; and
                  besides, I wished to hint that we need not imagine the natives will keep us year
                  after year in idleness, for they will certainly get tired of us at last, and we
                  must go to work, which, of itself would be no great calamity, but for us to work
                  during life on that island would be a sad picture not unlike a penitentiary
                  existence; but if we were wise in time, we might occupy as elevated and enviable
                  positions as we pleased; for it is learning and skill, or, more properly,
                  management, which in every country, places one class so immeasurably above
                  another.</p>
               <p>While I was speaking, Mr. Young kept raising his eyebrows in a manner I did not
                  like, and when I ended, he said, that it was possible I too had judged these
                  people by first appearances; however, he said that some of my remarks were very
                  good, and some, though he did not like them, he knew were true; and he thought we
                  might introduce many improvements and many notions of the sciences, and to that
                  end he would unite with me, but he protested, he said, against attempting to break
                  up the framework of their society, even though we should be able to effect so
                  great a mischief. When he said this I felt quite angry and looked at him with some
                  severity of countenance, but was a little abashed on being met with a
                  corresponding expression, and it is from that moment that I date the commencement
                  of a series of conflicts carried on with varied success for several years, yet
                  which did not break out till some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Our course of life on the island remained without much change for sometime, but it
                  is proper to remark in passing, that we were visited by great numbers of natives
                  from other parts, to whom the description already given of those with whom we
                  resided would apply.</p>
               <p>One day we had a new dish for dinner which was remarkably rich and pleasant, and
                  was composed of coco milk, cane juice and what was much the same as strawberries
                  boiled with bread fruit, and dressed with an exquisite sauce, and was so expensive
                  as to require the milk of fifty cocos for one dinner. We were all Well pleased
                  with it, but in about one hour afterwards several of us were attacked with the
                  bilious colic, but I in particular more severely, since I am by nature subject to
                  it, and for the first fifteen minutes doubted whether I should live or die. I
                  could neither sit, stand, or lie. I threw myself over a settee, crawled upon my
                  knees and elbows, doubled myself up, writhed, squirmed and twisted, and took every
                  possible position, seeking thereby some relief. The natives hearing my cries, came
                  up and stood in the doorway, with tears streaming down their faces, not knowing
                  what ailed me or what to do for me. Seeing thus that they probably had no idea of
                  the virtues of medicine in assisting nature and expelling diseases, I felt a
                  profound contempt for them, and this was the only mitigation I received in my
                  extreme pain. Finding myself becoming weakened and the cramp still pressing upon
                  me, I directed Mr. Young to take charge of me. He caused me to be carried into the
                  kitchen and placed upon a mattress before a large fire. He boiled some salt and
                  vinegar in a copper kettle, and applied it, hot as it was, to my bowels. This,
                  though causing a blister, alleviated my pains so that my cries sank into a sort of
                  tune. Soon after I fell into a drowse, and finally into a deep sleep, when they
                  carried me to my room. I did not awake till next day, for thus Wonderfully does
                  this fit enervate the body. Perhaps in no other disease does a man suffer more
                  than in this, and it is surprising when one considers the cause, which is simply a
                  condensation of air in the intestine, for as soon as it can be expanded by heat
                  the pain, ceases. When death occurs, as not unfrequently it does, the intestines
                  burst. It was a number of days before I dared to walk out again, but at last I was
                  fully recovered, and was competent to talk with any person on any subject.</p>
               <p>We now turned our whole attention to the acquisition of the native language, and
                  at the same time we imparted to the natives our own. The name of the language is
                  the Nedean, the island being called Nede. The number of letters in the alphabet is
                  forty-two, eight of which are vowels, which are determined by their position, not
                  by their form. Each letter has only one sound, by which the words are spelled as
                  they are pronounced. Their grammar has few rules, and rests rather upon natural
                  principles, and the parts of speech are four, corresponding with substantives,
                  verbs, attributives, and connectives. The whole number of words upon our arrival
                  was 22,841, but by the addition of English words, and a progressive state of
                  society, was increased to about 26,000. I might add that this language is not
                  difficult to acquire, since the forty-two letters of which it is composed, include
                  almost all the natural sounds of the human voice. How it happened that they fixed
                  upon this fortunate number I can scarcely conceive, for, to use the words of
                  another, the actual production of a complete alphabet is of all human discoveries
                  that which requires the most persevering reflection, the luckiest concurrence of
                  circumstances, and the most patient and gradual progress. I can but suppose that
                  several well balanced minds existed in remote ages, who, though lost as regards
                  their names, yet live in their works.</p>
               <p>After three months close application, and continual practice, we came to have a
                  tolerable knowledge of the Nedean language. Mr. Squire and Mr. Norris, though
                  making the least progress, were highly elated, they constantly talked Nedean with
                  one another, and with the natives, seeming never satisfied with pronouncing the
                  new words; and they frequently drew pictures of the impression they would make in
                  this or that place in their own country; how the minister, perhaps, would call
                  upon them, and how a certain justice of the peace, or Lawyer Such-a-one, in their
                  own houses, or on the shady steps of the store or tavern, would condescend to
                  listen and receive instruction; and how they would give them invitations to
                  dinner, when young ladies would lose their usual disdain, and listen with
                  enchanting attitudes to men who could speak in a tongue unknown to President
                  Dwight or Professor Hammersmith.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young now commenced giving lessons in geometry, for so ignorant were the
                  people that they had no idea of this science. From the fact that they had lived
                  many ages in a state not unfavorable for such a discovery, breathing, thinking,
                  and working side by side with triangles and geometric lines, and never having the
                  least idea of their existence, I was led to imagine that we, our own countrymen,
                  and other civilized people, are living side by side with occult sciences which
                  some accident, or some mind educated in an uncommon manner, will hereafter
                  discover to the great astonishment of mankind. The Nedeans were well pleased with
                  the teacher, and the science he taught, and made great progress, for the human
                  mind is always open, to receive some great truth; and where civilization and
                  religion are unknown, the mathematics, as with the Greeks and Romans very
                  conveniently fill the vacuum. If Mr. Young were to write a history of our
                  adventures, he would in this place speak of the difficulties the natives
                  encountered in solving this or that problem; how, that though A B was equal to C D
                  clearly enough, yet it was rather doubtful whether E F was equal to G H, since the
                  connection between A B and E F was very dubious; or whether the triangle A B C,
                  was equal to the squares described upon B A, A C, and so on. But it does not
                  become me to go into these matters, nor to speak of the other sciences he taught,
                  because I am not a learned scholar; and besides, I feel that I am proceeding in a
                  manner rather too incidental. Nevertheless, I ought to dwell on several
                  unimportant matters still more, in order that the reader may see as clearly as
                  possible the difficulty of the undertaking which. I presently commenced, and
                  accumulate in his mind pity for my misfortunes, and sympathy for the good cause in
                  which I labored and endured. It is with pain that I refrain from making further<pb
                     n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7230-00000018"/> ther reflections in the same strain, for
                  I dread coming to the pages which must needs be written. As the youth who leaves
                  his father's house to seek his fortune in the world, bids adieu to the scenes of
                  his childhood, around which are gathered the most pleasing associations of the
                  happiest period of his existence, looks back with regret, and forward with
                  apprehension, so in some measure is it with myself; and to retrace with my pen my
                  subsequent adventures, is much the same as though I were actually in my own person
                  again about to battle with envy and depravity. However, to dissipate in a degree
                  the gloom which these reflections must occasion, I would remark, that since I have
                  returned my wife has made me the father of a fine boy, in whom I am placing my
                  hopes, and stretching forward my imagination in a variety of scenes and activities
                  more natural than profitable.</p>
               <p>There was a young man among the natives, named Ivy, who attached himself to me
                  with great affection, and who visited me early, and retired late. I admired his
                  wit, and loved his docility; he was possessed of a pleasing, smiling countenance;
                  he sought to anticipate my wishes, and with great assiduity learned to speak
                  English fluently.</p>
               <p>There was another native of the name of Ethillon, who was older, and apparently in
                  middle life; and on account of his comprehensive mind, and eloquence in public
                  speaking, was looked upon by the rest as their superior. He took great interest in
                  everything we related of our country, and of the world at large, and not
                  unfrequently made extracts of what we imparted. He entered into my feelings, and
                  was anxious that my time should pass agreeably, to which end he was quite
                  communicative as regards the manners, customs, and history of his own people. He
                  took me into a little room in one of the towers, where the manuscripts of his race
                  were deposited, and referred to many volumes and passages therein as not wholly
                  unworthy of my attention. I devoted some little time in the examination of these
                  palm-leaf documents, but confess I was not much interested; for it was with them
                  as with other barbarous nations, they dealt in generalities and fanciful
                  notions,—their philosophy would compare with that of Montaigne, and their poetry
                  with that of Ossian.</p>
               <p>As regards their history, it was confessedly obscure, the early ages being
                  involved in conjecture and fable; but it was admitted that certain histories once
                  existed, which represented the former Nedeans as altogether different from the
                  present race; but these had been wholly destroyed, for the reason that the events
                  and actions therein recorded were wholly unfit for mortal contemplation. I noticed
                  that there was frequent reference made to this circumstance, and they accounted
                  themselves as peculiarly happy in being free from the pernicious examples which
                  must influence their conduct were they extant. Mr. Young, however, deeply engaged
                  in these historical investigations, and threw away a great deal of false sentiment
                  in his admiration for their wisdom, as he called it. He had much to say about a
                  return to first principles, through ages of bitter experience, through smitings
                  and judgments, and of a final triumph of human nature. To such blasphemy, for I
                  can call it little else. I made suitable reply; and whether he was ashamed or
                  indignant, he was silent, yet spent much of his time with some of their
                  philosophers, as he pleasantly called them, examining the musty records of human
                  depravity.</p>
               <p>Now I would not be so understood as to convey the idea, that these people were
                  without virtue or benevolent traits, or even some notions of doing to others as
                  they wished others to do to them; in fact, they were a contented, happy, harmless
                  race, who loved one another well enough, and led some such a life as history
                  informs us was led by the ancient Peruvians. But as I firmly believe in the total
                  depravity of mankind, how can I consent to state that, knowing nothing of the
                  Gospel, and consequently of a true state of society, they were living agreeably to
                  the requirements of their Creator? Let no one rise up and reply, that I am severe.
                  I understand the whole ground of this subject, and I cannot accept for mankind
                  anything short of those views of duty and religion, which the great majority of
                  Christians have decided to be a correct interpretation of the Word. I know very
                  well that I am saying what is hard for human nature to bear, and that many who
                  agree with me in part, dissent from this extreme ground; yet here I stand,
                  believing that the final adjustment of all human differences will prove the
                  contrary to be an error of the most fatal kind!</p>
               <p>It seems that Ethillon and Gambia, who was another orator, and others, found some
                  difficulty in getting Mr. Young and Griffith to inform them of such particulars
                  regarding our own country and the world at large, as would lead them to form
                  correct ideas of our power, religion, learning, and refinement; and accordingly I
                  took upon myself the task of giving them the desired information, by going to the
                  foundation of society, or rather human nature, making an abstract from the Bible
                  of man's state of innocence, and of his fall, and concluded with a short history
                  of the principal scriptural personages and events, from Adam down to the epistles
                  of Paul, and the trance of St. John on the Island of Patmos. I then went back to
                  the earliest ages mentioned in profane history, commencing with Egypt, passed
                  lightly over Babylon, Assyria, and Persia, glanced at the shadows of India and
                  Cathay, turned to Greece and Rome, and the imperfectly known regions Scythia and
                  Britain, and followed rapidly down the stream of history to the later ages of the
                  discovery of America, of the art of printing, and of the use of gunpowder. I spoke
                  of the Indians and the Pilgrim Fathers, of King Philip and Captain Miles Standish,
                  of William Penn and Gov. Stuyvesant. At last, coming to the Revolution of 1776, I
                  enlarged upon the piety, bravery, and hardihood of my ancestors, and of the
                  superlative meanness, and overbearing tyranny of King George and the British
                  parliament. I went through the battles. It did, me good to do so; for as every
                  true patriot should do, I had imprinted them in my memory, from the first skirmish
                  at Lexington, to the awful and overwhelming defeat at New Orleans. And then, being
                  unable to keep my seat, I spoke of the influx of emigrants from Europe, and of the
                  mighty increase of our population, described our boundaries as including every
                  variety of soil and climate, and marked on the east and west by two vast oceans,
                  the space between which being greater than one could travel during a grand
                  revolution of the celestial spheres.</p>
               <p>Then I descended to particulars, and spoke of our commerce, and of wealth in
                  general; of banks and insurance companies, of canals and railroads, and of the
                  ships which sail completely around the world. Next I spoke of our common schools;
                  of our academies and colleges, where dead languages are learned, and touched upon
                  our means of defence against invasion, such as forts, standing armies, and ships
                  of war. I spoke, too, of our medical schools and our physicians, who, with some
                  difficulty, introduce us into the world, yet, by means of medicine, find none in
                  getting us out of it. Then, with a great deal of pride, I spoke of our laws,—of
                  common law which, though instituted beyond the memory of man, and for a different
                  people, yet, by stretching a little now and then, answers well enough; and of
                  statute law enacted by the wisest and richest of our citizens, whose successors
                  meet yearly to frame new laws, that they may keep up with the changes in public
                  sentiment and of circumstances. This naturally led me to speak of judges,
                  sheriffs, esquires, constables, deputies, and watchmen, whose business it is to
                  see that the laws are not violated; and then of that honorable, ancient, learned,
                  benevolent, and highly useful class of citizens, the lawyers. Then I spoke of our
                  theatres and mad houses, and blind and orphan asylums, and poor houses and watch
                  houses, of prisons and penitentiaries and their cells, of daggers, pistols,
                  swords, rifles, bayonets, and cannon; of our churches and cathedrals and brothers;
                  of fetters and handcuffs, iron collars, iron prongs, and iron balls with their
                  chain; of whips and whipping-posts, of branding irons, of gallows and
                  bloodhounds.</p>
               <p>Most of our residence on the island, thus far, had been during the rainy
                     reason,<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7230-00000019"/> when the winds were high, and
                  when, for several days and nights, it thundered and lightened without
                  intermission. At these times the natives kept housed, though they neglected not to
                  go out and bathe were the waves dashing ever so high, and even among the trees,
                  and having a plenty of provisions in store, and a sufficient number of fruit trees
                  reserved near by loaded with fruit, they passed their days in a species of
                  pleasing inactivity, engaged in some trifling games and attending to trials of
                  skill among the children, orators, and athletæ. For this reason we had only made
                  little journey into the woods, and had not visited the other parts of the island,
                  though often pressed to do so. At last the rainy season was fairly over, if we
                  except an occasional cloud passing over during the middle of the day, at which
                  time, being heavily charged, it burst on the windward side of the island with such
                  violence as to raise us to our feet. However, at length the sky continued ever
                  fair, and accordingly my comrades and myself, Ivy, Ethillon, Gambia, and several
                  other natives set out Monday morning, March 25th, 1839.</p>
               <p>Observing in this place that I have mentioned the day of the week, it strikes me
                  that I ought to say that, although the natives paid no attention to the Sabbath,
                  we ourselves regarded it, and I took upon myself to offer some remarks and perform
                  some ceremonies suitable to the day, which my comrades received in good part, and
                  which many of the natives attended. I might remark, that the natives observed
                  every twenty-eighth day, or thereabouts, in fasting and meditating, as a mourning
                  for the dead, but as they made use of some skeletons both in their private rooms
                  during the morning and evening, and in their assembly room, addressing the same in
                  a speech, which was an occasion for them to offer the imperfect and crude notions
                  they entertained as regards the awful mystery of their existence, of which they
                  neither knew or professed to know anything, though they spent a great deal of time
                  in talking about it, I feel justified in giving the matter only a passing notice,
                  as well as the music and songs at the conclusion of the day, for we have
                  heathenism enough at home.</p>
               <p>Falling into a path beyond the garden, we made directly for the highlands, and
                  passing through a grove of cinnamon and allspice trees reached a bold hill which
                  overlooked the sea, just as the sun was beginning to rise.</p>
               <p>There were evident traces of the late storms, which, this year, had been unusually
                  violent. Some large trees had been splintered by the lightning, and many small
                  fruit trees were bent down and their fruit despoiled, or lying on the ground half
                  buried in the gravel and sand. Indeed, the earth was, in many places, entirely
                  covered with decayed fruit, out of which sprung clusters of young trees from the
                  seed thus planted. But a new series already shone upon the trees, and yet mixed
                  with blossoms, promising another neglected harvest. On several occasions, although
                  in the woods, we saw places where swamps formerly lay, having been filled up with
                  dirt from neighboring hillocks, but this must have been done hundreds of years
                  previous, for large trees stood upon the later soil; and, in fact, the natives
                  pointed out these labors to us, and showed us also during our journey, certain
                  places where the sea used to set back and formed bayous and stagnant swamps, but
                  now, having been long filled up, glades and trees occupied the places.
                  Nevertheless, at times the sea re-opens these old beds, or wears away some
                  crumbling shore, and leaves its waters, at low tide, to stagnate in depressed
                  places where vegetation is rank, engendering pestilential vapors, but no sooner
                  are these discovered, than the natives turn out in a mass and labor till the
                  waters are restrained within their proper boundaries. Upon such enterprises I pass
                  my approbation.</p>
               <p>In one place, as we traveled along by the clifts, at the foot of a high hill, I
                  noticed, where the earth had been gullied out by the torrents, several lumps which
                  I took to be silver, but not having time to examine further, I determined to visit
                  the place at a future day. And it is well enough to add now, that after we
                  returned, Mr. Squire and myself came to this spot and examining the ground all
                  around the hill, and particularly on the top, where we dug up the earth several
                  feet, and came to a mass of solid silver which was so pure that, when cut out with
                  a chisel, it could be immediately coined into money. This we kept to ourselves,
                  and when a proper time came we made a judicious use of the discovery.</p>
               <p>After we had travelled about two hours we descended through the passes among the
                  hills into a circular valley, with a clear stream running through its center. Here
                  we found another community of the natives, with edifice gardens and rude
                  improvements such as I have described as belonging to the one where we resided.
                  The natives were highly elated at our appearance, and gathered from all quarters
                  singing and running, and to me in particular paid a great deal of attention, for,
                  having learned that I was the Captain of the others, they concluded I was their
                  superior, which, perhaps, with some reservations, was correct enough. After
                  tarrying till the middle of the afternoon, in order that we might travel in the
                  increasing shadows of the forest, we again set forward. My spirits were quite high
                  as I walked along partly by myself, because I clearly perceived that I was held in
                  high esteem; and I have seldom been more elated on eating a meal of good victuals
                  than I was on that occasion. Such instances of vanity I know do not much recommend
                  me, and might be suppressed, but my book were certainly imperfect if I did not
                  make the reader acquainted with some of my failings. Therefore it was with a great
                  deal of pleasure that I joined with my companions in remarking upon the riches of
                  the forest. At almost every step we passed large mahogany trees, growing upon the
                  hills and along the hill-sides and in the valleys. Spice, pepper, cinnamon, clove
                  and nutmeg groves, succeeded each other, and either the coco or banin could be
                  seen wherever we stood. As regards the minor fruit trees I have already remarked
                  that they were abundant—and it was with difficulty that we refrained from
                  selecting some remarkably large and fine oranges, custard apples, or India plums,
                  as the case might be, and continually regretted, as we passed along, that we must
                  leave unvisited and un-plucked a bought, at a little distance, bending with green
                  and gold. However, the birds, which were in great numbers, might take their
                  choice, and so also might the deer and rabbits and several other little animals,
                  one in particular, which is only found in this island, so far as my reading in
                  Goldsmith's Animal Nature serves me, and in this place needs a description; This
                  was a quadruped about the size and shape of a lamb, with feet like a rabbit and
                  teeth like a man. It had neither hair nor feathers, but had a skin perfectly white
                  and smooth, and comparable to a first quality kind glove. On the top of its head,
                  commencing at the place where the back bone is joined to the skull, is a loose
                  covering or double skin extending over to the eyebrows, and very closely
                  resembling a hood, at the top of which the ears are set. This hood is of a deep
                  scarlet in the male, and of a beautiful green in the female. On each of the sides
                  of this animal arose seven spots of plushy fur, about half an inch high, of the
                  size of a lady's little finger nail and corresponding with the hoods in color,
                  that is, being scarlet or green.</p>
               <p>Towards the close of the day we came to the greatest elevation on the island, a
                  spot mostly destitute of trees, and which was, as we afterwards determined, 2040
                  feet above the level of the sea. Here the natives conducted us to what was,
                  apparently, and what really was in ancient times, the crater of a volcano. The
                  sides were precipitous, and around the top jutted over in such a manner as to make
                  it almost impossible for a persons to descend otherwise than by falling, much less
                  to ascend if he were below. The distance across was about 350 feet, and the depth
                  about 600 feet, with a small irregular valley at the bottom covered with rocks and
                  some kinds of vegetation, and, along the sides, a certain luxuriant creeping vine,
                  with immense leaves, climbed from rock to rock. On looking closely I perceived
                  that the precipitous sides of this crater had been once walled up and that the
                  projecting edges were also of mason work.</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7230-00000020"/>
               <p>The natives informed us that formerly the island abounded with spiteful and
                  poisonous serpents, but, this pit having been walled up in the present manner,
                  they were caught and thrown in. Upon this, we looked over and beheld on the
                  eastern side of the pit, where the sun yet shone, such a vast quantity of snakes
                  as might justly arouse the reader's suspicion were I to compute, what I supposed
                  to be their number. It would be but a disgustful picture were I to relate how, on
                  seeing us, they started up, as though they would, if they could, do something
                  terrible. Among them I noticed the Camoudi, which ordinarily grows to thirty feet
                  in length, but here I saw a pair over seventy feet, and which in places under the
                  line grows even larger, and by the hapless traveler is sometimes mistaken for a
                  fallen tree. There was the Star eye, or, as he is called in South America, the
                  bush-master; for, though wearing every lovely color, yet he is so vindictive that
                  man and beast fly before him and he remains entire lord of the forest. I noticed,
                  too, the whip-snake, of a beautiful green; the labari, which kills in a few
                  minutes, and is the most deadly of all snakes; the hooded serpent, common in
                  India, extremely poisonous: also that curious reptile, called the two-headed
                  devil, described by Humboldt, or some one else, which has a head at each
                  extremity; and others, "too numerous" indeed, for me to mention. As I stood
                  watching them I could not help comparing this den in the center of the island to
                  the human heart, when it is beheld by the light of the gospel, though I refrained
                  from expressing myself thus. We did not tarry long in this place, for we felt the
                  noxious vapor rising as the sun began to descend, and, entering upon an
                  unfrequented path, we walked rapidly that we might reach a shelter before the dews
                  began to fall. Let me anticipate a little by stating that, when I came to have
                  power on the island I caused great quantities of combustibles to be thrown into
                  this den and then set on fire, by which means these serpents were entirely
                  consumed. A little after dark we came to an arm of the sea, and presently to
                  another community, where we were to tarry for the night. After we were served with
                  excellent food, though with no meat, which I regretted, for I was tired, Ethillon
                  and Gambia entered into a discussion with some other natives on the subject of
                  free-will, or fore-ordination, but they used no other arguments than such foolish
                  and thread-bare ones as are common with us, as: If I am to eat this orange, I am
                  to eat it; and if I am not to eat it, it is utterly impossible that I should eat
                  it; and, on the contrary, nonsense! stuff! if you chose to move across this room,
                  who or what is to hinder you? therefore—&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.; but let me
                  remark that, although there is naturally some obscurity in this subject, I am told
                  that Edwards, in his work "On the Will," has settled the whole matter on the
                  modern Presbyterian ground, and overthrown everybody except himself. Seeing that
                  they were likely to dispute till very late, we went to bed, but were awakened
                  several times by their loud talking.</p>
               <p>As soon as the day began to break we set out, and, walking pretty briskly, crossed
                  a spur of the interior highlands, and, a little after sunrise, came to the ocean.
                  Here, instead of a beach, was an iron-bound shore of basaltic rock, over three
                  hundred feet in height, which, though not so high as in some of the Hebrides I had
                  visited, where, in one place, there is a perpendicular wall, rising out of the sea
                  to the height of one mile, yet was quite sufficient to astonish my companions who,
                  with awe and fear, gazed upon the heavy waves that dashed and curled backwards, or
                  roared among the fissures and caves which they had been excavating for six
                  thousand years. It appeared that the natives had some admiration for this shore,
                  since, as a sort of protection, they had set a railing for several miles, and the
                  path behind it was apparently traveled the most of any we had yet seen. There is a
                  remarkably large tree on this shore, standing back on a little eminence, and,
                  although it is surrounded by many tall trees, is itself so high as to overlook all
                  other prospects except one hill, and even this is apparently upon a level with its
                  branches. I regret that there was no measurement of its height, but I dare say it
                  exceeded three hundred feet, and that its body near the ground was not less than
                  seventy feet in diameter. Steps had been cut into the bark by which our ascent to
                  its branches was made easy; and there, some facilities, such as ropes and notches,
                  enabled us to mount almost to the top, where we found a little platform on which
                  we stood and viewed the prospect of woods and angry waters. This tree was a
                  species of tropical mulberry, and at the time of our visit it was black with
                  fruit.</p>
               <p>Although the heat was great we still continued our journey, enjoying the breeze
                  created by the great agitation of the waters. There was an innumerable number of
                  sea-birds flying between us and the waves, for they bred undisturbed in the
                  fissures of the rocks, and, as in the adjacent forest, there were sufficient
                  fruits for their sustenance, and a plenty of wild sea breeze in which they so much
                  delight, we looked upon them as being happy creatures—much more happy, said Mr.
                  Young, than thousands of human beings who, the moment he was speaking, knew not
                  where to got a morsel to eat or where to lay their heads. And whose fault is it? I
                  asked; is there not work? is there not land? Shall I toil all my days to help keep
                  up poor-houses? If men will not be industrious or skillful, whose fault is it? He
                  did not reply to me, but walked on repeating <emph>fault</emph> several times, and
                  then muttered all to himself: three thousand needle-women here, seven thousand
                  needle-women not far off, thirty thousand needle-women there, which made me think
                  his mind was a little ruffled.</p>
               <p>About 10 o'clock A.M. we reached the western point of the island where, behind a
                  grove of banins, but rising above it another edifice was erected. Here, being upon
                  a promontory, we had a fine view of the ocean, and we could trace almost the whole
                  extent of the southern shore of the island; nay, by the assistance of my glass,
                  even saw the port where we first landed. Here we tarried the remainder of the day
                  and till the next morning excellently well entertained; indeed, had the people
                  been our slaves we could not have been waited upon with more attention. And here,
                  in the afternoon, sitting in a pleasant room which overlooked a great extent of
                  ocean, I forgot, for the time, my wife, home, country, and even my principles, in
                  musing on this unrivaled location and on the pleasure he must necessarily enjoy
                  whose life is passed upon this promontory and in these woods. Mr. Norris and Mr.
                  Squire spent most of the time among the children and young men, and in walking
                  around from place to place, while Mr. Griffith sat in the kitchen, overlooking
                  those who were cooking and apparently meditating on some important matter. I could
                  never come to a clear understanding of this man, for he seldom spoke unless spoken
                  to or some particular subject was on hand, and yet he was never disagreeable, but
                  on the contrary was quite polite, begged pardon for this, presumed to be so bold,
                  and feared one robbed himself; and sometimes he would stand alone by the sea shore
                  tossing pebbles in his hand while a tear was in his eye, or would walk in the
                  woods, no one knew how far, and return weary and sweaty; however, towards the
                  last, he outgrew this in some degree and became more like a man of the world. I
                  had supposed that his being disappointed in love was the reason why he acted so
                  strangely, but having once heard a public speaker say that the reason why St. Paul
                  commanded woman to be silent in churches was because he had been crossed in love,
                  I have ever since avoided referring any eccentricity to this misfortune. Mr.
                  Young, with his particular friend, Gambia, examined what he was pleased to call
                  their library. For my part, perceiving that their literature and their handicraft
                  arts were inferior and extremely imperfect, I had very little curiosity in
                  undertaking any investigations concerning them. Instead, I meditated upon plans
                  for enlarging their knowledge in arts, mechanics and religion, and, in short,
                  sketched within my mind a scheme that should effect a radical change in the where
                  structure of their society.</p>
               <p>The next morning we set out on our return by the northern shore. Our<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000021"/> departure was deeply regretted, but I myself
                  promised to visit them again, and hinted that I might spend some considerable time
                  with, them since I was highly pleased with their location. This day we crossed
                  several streams which ran in torrents from the hills. I noticed several places
                  where building stone might be easily quarried, also a number of falls and rapids
                  where machinery could be put in operation. Called at two edifices at the foot of
                  the hills; one situated upon a beautiful lake. The weather being cooler we
                  traveled all day, stopped over night, and again set out at day-break. The face of
                  the country was slightly rolling, with a great many little brooks running through
                  the glades and forests. The soil was alluvial and the hills rising at some
                  distance to the south. In many places we could see large red flowers covering the
                  ground in every direction. Came upon several deer which, as usual, suffered us to
                  approach them. The banin here grows larger than in any other part of the island,
                  and the bread-fruit tree yields equally as much as when cultivated in gardens.
                  Eight o'clock, came again to the beach, and saw the iron-bound shore several miles
                  behind. Saw also, at a great height, the large mulberry-tree before mentioned.
                  Shortly after we came to another community, and in consequence of the heat,
                  tarried till towards evening, when we resumed our journey upon the beach. The
                  streams entering the ocean were shallow, and scarcely ankle deep. Night now set
                  in, but as there was a moon we were well pleased with our walk, and about midnight
                  arrived at the place whence we started. Thus, we made a circuit of the island,
                  which we computed to be eighteen miles long, and from two to seven miles broad,
                  though in our journey we had traveled much farther. In all, we found seven
                  communities, of 343 persons each, equal to a population of 3401 souls.</p>
               <p>The day after we returned, Mr. Young came to me and requested the use of my Bible,
                  as he had been so unwise as not to bring one with him from the ship. He said he
                  had taken it into his head to give it another thorough examination, for, he
                  confessed he had lived a long time in suspense as to what his duty might be
                  concerning it. Sometimes he said he had almost doubted whether it was not a series
                  of fictions composed by learned and philosophic priests, and deceived fishermen,
                  or later theologians who personated them, but since he had come across some
                  inculcations in the books of the natives resembling those found in the New
                  Testament, he wished to compare them together, and also, as he before said, to
                  ascertain clearly what his duty might be, for lately he had brought together some
                  facts and principles which had been detached in his mind, and he was pretty well
                  convinced that the Bible was a deeper and more comprehensive, nay a more
                  philosophical book than he had previously supposed.</p>
               <p>I was very glad to hear this, unsatisfactory as it was, and took upon myself to
                  give him directions how he ought to study the Bible; how he ought to take human
                  nature as it is, and to take nature herself as she really is, and I fancied that
                  he would not find God to be more cruel, at least, than nature; and she being a
                  demonstration every where present, he would thereby be led to entertain the idea
                  that the Deity manifests himself by means of the material universe, as a first
                  thought or proposition, and much more to the same effect, which he received with
                  attention.</p>
               <p>Some few days now passed, in which I was anxious to converse with him, and in
                  fact, one afternoon had commenced a series of explanations, when all at once the
                  drums began to toll in such a manner that we apprehended some one was dead; and in
                  this opinion we were soon confirmed, for going to the main entrance we saw the
                  natives collected together in great numbers, with a dead man in their midst. It
                  appeared that he was the oldest man among them, and had really calculated on dying
                  that day, and while standing, usually well, in the spot referred to, fell down and
                  instantly ceased to breathe. He was taken into an assembly room, and placed upon a
                  sort of bier which is used upon such occasions, where he lay during the day and
                  following night. About dawn the next morning, a number of natives began to busy
                  themselves in building a fire in a vacant space opposite the western tower, and
                  presently placed a large copper boiler over the flames. The dead man was then
                  brought out, and put in this vessel, and considerable water poured in; whereupon
                  fuel was added to the fire so that in a short time the water boiled violently.</p>
               <p>I must pass over this scene very briefly, because for me to enlarge upon such a
                  subject, or even to be minute enough to describe it correctly, would be very
                  distasteful to my mind, and I dare say would be so to every reader of sensibility.
                  During the forenoon, the greater part of the inhabitants of the island were
                  gathered around the boiling caldron; for runners had been sent out the moment the
                  man fell. Once I went near and had a glimpse of the corpse, but quickly retired.
                  By the middle of the afternoon the body was taken out and laid on some talipot
                  leaves. Shortly after, the flesh was stripped from the bones, which when cooled,
                  were strung upon wires so skilfully, that with little or no support the skeleton
                  could stand upon its feet. Then it was placed upon the speaker's platform in the
                  assembly room, when the whole body of the people came together to listen to the
                  funeral discourses. Ethillon was the principal speaker, and in an address to the
                  departed, told him of this and told him of that, how he would arise from one state
                  of life to another, as he had been raised from a shell-fish to human intelligence,
                  and that seeing many pleasant things before him, he was glad that he was dead, and
                  had left a world in which nothing more was to be learned. However, before he got
                  through, he seemed to doubt whether he had not been saying what was doubtful, for
                  he began to argue upon the immortality of the soul, and among other things, said,
                  that if death is an eternal sleep, then love and hope and beauty, and the stars
                  themselves are washed out when the dream of life is over; that eye glances and
                  hand pressures, and studies and researches into nature, and musings with one's
                  self, and contemplations upon the ocean, and the sighing of the winds, and sweet
                  smells, and bright colors, stars in pinks, and pinks in the grass, were only parts
                  of a distorted dream, that some huge being, no matter whether good or bad, in
                  whose head we were, had been dreaming, and waking up it was all over, and we never
                  would be dreamed again.</p>
               <p>During the delivery of this speech, and the previous performances, I was silent,
                  but several words such as Peor, Balim, Ashtaroth, Isis, Orus, and the dog Anubis,
                  were upon my tongue, and appropriate thoughts connected therewith, struggling for
                  utterance.</p>
               <p>At ten o'clock the skeleton was removed to a room where I knew several other
                  skeletons were deposited, when, at the same time, another skeleton crumbling into
                  dust, was taken apart, placed in a small box and buried under the banin opposite
                  the building. Thereupon the whole of the natives joined it a loud sounding hymn
                  accompanied with a peal from the drums. By this time it was dark, and the natives
                  lay down to rest on mats placed around the assembly rooms, kitchens, shops,
                  &amp;c., for I have mentioned above that the principal part of the inhabitants of
                  the island were present. Such is the manner, then, that these people disposed of
                  their dead; but they adopted another method occasionally, that is, previous to
                  boiling the body they skinned it, in order that they might get drum-heads, for I
                  have stated that they use human skins for this purpose. I fancy I see the
                  indignation of my reader rise at this stage of my narrative, as it naturally
                  should, and hence I am spared the invective which is almost enough to make me dash
                  my manuscript to the floor.</p>
               <p>Let me, however, state in this place, that the Nedeans, if we may believe them,
                  live to an extreme old age, that is, 343 years,(!) unless their lives are
                  abbreviated by accident, irregularity or intemperance; which is a very improbable
                  account, but I can vouch for the fact, that each one knew nearly the day of his
                  death, and instead<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7230-00000022"/> stead of lingering in
                  sickness, he dropped down in the midst of health, and ceased to breathe.</p>
               <p>The next morning, Gambia called in upon me, when we entered into a conversation
                  respecting death, but I do not think it worth while to repeat such crude views as
                  he entertained. Gradually we entered upon a subject which I had been long wishing
                  to introduce. I told him, that in our country, a man unites himself to a woman, by
                  whom he has one child, or more than one, and sometimes, though rarely, as many as
                  twenty-four, which they support by their united efforts, since they live separate
                  from the rest of world. Upon this, he made several inquiries, when I enlarged upon
                  those matters which we, with us, have agreed to call indelicate, though for what
                  reason I never could clearly apprehend, for we are mere clay, the dust beneath our
                  feet is the same, and when to this refuse, contemptible soil, we bring certain
                  portions of water, air, fruit and grain, we must speak of it with great
                  circumspection. As Gambia seemed much astonished at my relation, I concluded, that
                  he felt himself obliged, and accordingly, bluntly asked him how his people were
                  pro-created, and introduced into the world. Seeing my ignorance, and reflecting
                  from what I had told him, that it was a necessary consequence, he exclaimed, that
                  I should not be ignorant much longer, for at that very hour, another being was
                  about to commence its first stage of existence, in order that the place of the
                  deceased might be filled.</p>
               <p>He then led me into a remote room, on the eastern side of the building, where
                  several natives had already collected. In the middle of the room, was a bath,
                  heated to 125° Shortly after we arrived, one of the natives entered this bath,
                  when the strictest silence was enjoined. In precisely 17 minutes and 2 seconds,
                  which was noted by a water-clock, a bubble rose to the surface of the water, and
                  bursting, left a blue speck, which immediately changed to crimson, and then to
                  orange. In 1 minute, another bubble arose, in 3 minutes, 3 bubbles, and five
                  minutes after, several hundred bubbles in quick succession. Forty minutes after
                  the bath was entered, one of the natives approached, and transferred the matter
                  thus collected into a small concave vessel, holding water at a temperature of 96°,
                  and placed it in the casement where the sun was shining. Then the native emerged
                  from the bath, with a serene countenance. It was some time after this, before I
                  thought of making an important inquiry, that is, whether the said native had
                  previously come in contact with any other person, or, in other words, whether any
                  such relation as the sexes really existed among them, although quite unapparent to
                  my observation; but by this time, things had taken a different turn on the island,
                  so that I could obtain but partial satisfaction, even if I desired it; still I was
                  led to conclude that male and female did really exist. Yet in such extreme
                  secrecy, that the natives themselves almost avoided adverting to it. It is proper
                  in this place, to give the result of our observations on this subject, mostly made
                  after we had constructed some philosophical apparatus for chemical tests, &amp;c.;
                  but it is due to Mr. Young to say, that the following formula is the result of his
                  more correct experiments.</p>
               <p>The ovum may be collected, and the process carried on through any season, but it
                  is seldom attempted during the rainy one. On each of the first fifteen days, at
                  morning, noon, and evening, it is sprinkled with distilled water, by a person who
                  previously, had apparently been wholly disconnected with the transaction, and who
                  from that time took charge of the whole matter. The ovum has now increased from
                  four to eight ounces; taking from the water and atmosphere, 70 parts of oxygen, 17
                  of nitrogen, and 13 of hydrogen. On the 16th, 17th and 18th days, it turns black,
                  but otherwise remains unchanged. Water having been withheld from the 15th, it is
                  now again applied, when it changes to a blueish white. On the 19th and 20th, it
                  takes 50 of carbonic acid, 30 of nitrogen, 15 of nitrogen, 4 of phosphorus and 1
                  of ammonia. Water is now withheld for ten days, and the changes which subsequently
                  arise are referable wholly to the atmosphere. The temperature of the room varies
                  little from 96° On the 21st, 22d, 23d, and 24th, it absorbs pure oxygen, and
                  assumes a bright lively color approaching to pink. It is now transferred into
                  another and larger vessel, with a hollow bottom connected with the upper part by
                  several small holes. Its weight is 33 ounces troy, is oblong in shape, as white as
                  snow, and covered with an extremely thin net-work. If touched with the finger
                  between the 25th and 30th day, it sinks into a putrid mass.</p>
               <p>On the 25th day, a dim line is perceivable, which is the spine in the exact
                  similitude of a serpent, that is, as I imagined, the head of which being the
                  medulla oblongata, but this resemblance ceases, when its pia mater a few hours
                  afterwards commences knitting around it. Vermicular motion is now faintly
                  perceivable, when water is again added, and also albumen of eggs, milk of coco,
                  rice water, cane juice, and pineapple juice in infinitesimal quantities, which
                  nutriment is ever afterwards administered. From the 30th, to the 35th, it takes
                  oxygen, and throws off carbon. On the 36th, it takes oxygen, and with the carbon
                  expels 2 equivalents of uric acid, 5 of volatile alkali, and 3 of phosphorus. The
                  temperature of the room is reduced to 90°, but the fœtus is at 101.5. On the 35th,
                  the spinal marrow sends out a fine stem, at the extremity of which the heart takes
                  the shape of a little eye, with a pulsation barely distinguishable.</p>
               <p>No particular change takes place in the treatment, or chemical manifestations,
                  till the 50th day, when the outlines of the human form, are perceivable. On the
                  54th, the medulla oblongata branches out into a cloudy ball, full of crooked
                  seams, or of convolutions, which in three hours is covered with a pia mater, and
                  three hours afterwards, with a dura mater. For seven days the brain is to be seen
                  through these membranes of a beautiful purple, and beating alternately with the
                  heart, but on the next day the skull begins to form, and resembles the white
                  lining of an egg shell, The human countenance is now clearly marked, covered with
                  a close veil. It weighs 38 ounces troy, and is transferred to a species of cotton
                  pallet. The room is darkened, and two degrees of heat are withdrawn. The attendant
                  is relieved a short time every six hours.</p>
               <p>From the 56th to the 60th, the liver and lungs appear. During the 61st, 62d, 63d,
                  64th, and 65th, the stomach and intestinal parts are formed, and on the 70th the
                  ossification of the bones commences. The form is now clearly defined, and the
                  abdomen entirely closed. The arms, however, are folded and joined to the body, and
                  the legs firmly doubled up in a squatting posture. On the 74th, the muscles begin
                  to attach themselves, which is made apparent by motions resembling slight
                  convulsions. On the 78th and 79th, the nerves fall into their places. On the same
                  day, towards midnight, the chest rises, and the face indicates the existence of
                  pain. The nutriment previously administered, is still continued, but in such
                  abundance as to drip from the body. On the 80th, the arms are loosened, and drop
                  carelessly by the side. From the 80th to the 85th, the body is quiet, not stirring
                  ot'tener than once in 8 hours. After this, life struggles for the mastery the legs
                  stretch out and kick, the arms are tossed upward, and sometimes the body turns
                  entirely over. The latter part of the 88th, and the whole of the 89th, include
                  hours of great apparent distress. At such times, death may ensue, but this is of
                  rare occurrence. At last, on the 90th day, it tears the veil from its face with
                  its own hands, it gasps, air enters its lungs, its first respiration is made, it
                  cries, and the child is born. With great joy, the person who has constantly
                  attended it, wraps it in a garment, and carries it away, and afterwards devotes
                  much time in supplying the wants of its body, and in developing the powers of its
                  mind.</p>
               <p>As to the causes of these changes, or, as to the manner in which air, water, and
                  nutriment are decomposed, and such parts taken up as are necessary, and such parts
                  thrown off as are useless, I can give no account whatever. No more can I explain
                  how chickens are produced from eggs, snakes and worms from hair, or fish from
                  spawn. How fat is elaborated from substances which contain<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000023"/> none, how vegetables are converted into fibrine,
                  and fibrine into blood and nerves, or how the nerves themselves are a link between
                  spirit and matter, are mysteries which no one has pretended to solve. Reasonably,
                  therefore, it cannot be expected that I should solve the greatest problem, when
                  the combined knowledge of mankind has failed to solve the least. It now only
                  remains that I should give the anatomy of the interior organs of this body, which
                  is as follows:—</p>
               <p>The lungs are twice as large as they are in us, although they are divided in the
                  same manner, and almost encompass the heart and liver. The pleura, by which they
                  are separated and enclosed, is of course larger, and is thicker and stronger. As
                  regards the divisions of the heart, the action of the atmosphere upon the impure
                  blood in the lungs, and the secretion of bile by the liver, they are the same as
                  in us. There are, however, three stomachs, situate one above another, the first
                  considerably smaller than ours, the next one smaller than this, and the third half
                  the size of the first. The first stomach alone secretes the gastric or digestive
                  fluid, and in some degree it performs the office of assimilation. The chyme then
                  passes into the second stomach, where the secretions commence, and where the
                  capillaries take up the chyle which is destined to supply the waste of the body.
                  The third stomach, occupying the place of our bowels, performs the same office in
                  a less and inferior degree, but its chief function is quite different, for it is
                  lined with the termination of tubes or large capillaries which carry the
                  innutritious or refuse matter to the surface, that is, to those longitudinal
                  openings before mentioned. These openings mostly lie in the abdomen and along the
                  flanks and back. Some of the principal arteries send out excretory capillaries in
                  the shape of feathery stems, but their terminations are scarcely perceivable by
                  the naked eye. Now, instead of the lower intestine, there is a bundle of these
                  ducts, which separate directly, and terminate at the lower part of the body in
                  three hundred and forty-three fissures. Immediately below the last stomach and
                  directly over the pelvis, occupying with the stomach the place of the colon and
                  convolved intestines, are two small glands, of the size and shape of an almond,
                  and which are supposed to be the seat of social feeling and good nature. Those are
                  connected with another organ by four double and twisted cords, lying across the
                  back-bone, which resembles in texture a leather apron, but of a triangular form,
                  and folded upon itself like a three cornered handkerchief when the two acute
                  angles are doubled over upon the right angle of the opposite folded corner. This
                  organ is called the hippogriff, and is universally supposed to be the seat of 18,
                  5, 16, 18, 15, 4, 21, 3, 20, 9, 15, 14. Out of this organ issue seven pair of
                  duets, which terminate in large fissures below the second pair of false ribs,
                  while at the same time two biliary duets run along each side of the back-bone, and
                  connect, one with the left lobe of the liver, and the other with the vena cava.
                  One other organ remains to be described, viz.: a muscular ball, of the size and
                  form of a small hen's egg, suspended from the lowest point of the lower stomach by
                  a muscular cord, three inches and eight lines in length, and as no use has been
                  assigned to it, it is conjectured that it corresponds with a balance wheel, or a
                  pendulum lever, in machinery, by which all the other parts are regulated, and
                  hence, that this ball is the center of life. But this is a mere supposition.</p>
               <p>Having now got through with these abstruse matters, I return to the continuation
                  of my narrative.</p>
               <p>As I noticed that Mr. Young spent much of his time in reading the Bible, I took
                  occasion to ascertain his opinion of it. He said he was favorably impressed with
                  the greater part, though he could not reconcile several accounts with God's
                  goodness, but I was so happy in many of my explanations that he was convinced he
                  had but imperfectly considered the constitution of nature as connected with moral
                  government. At last he expressed himself willing to believe, although not clearly
                  understanding everything, and to leave these dark places to be upheld by faith;
                  and he said himself if God really did reveal himself to man, as he had no reason
                  to doubt, one must naturally conclude that it would be agreeably to the highest,
                  not the lowest, capacity of mankind, and it might be supposed to be a matter as
                  hard to understand in all its parts as Newton's Principia, to say the least, which
                  requires study and close thinking; and this led him to remark, incidentally, that
                  ignorant and unlearned preachers are unsafe guides, which was good Presbyterian
                  ground, but still he thought them quite useful among the lower orders, who
                  otherwise might think religion too deep for them, and finally he added, with as
                  much sense as ever fell from his or any other man's lips, that the greatness and
                  obscurity of the religious subject showed the absolute necessity for the exercise
                  of faith, without which one would be like a child who stops in his obedience till
                  he can understand his father's views, and enter into all his reasonings of why and
                  wherefore.</p>
               <p>Several weeks after this he told me that he had come to the conclusion to be
                  baptized by immersion, and when I expressed surprise at this, he said he was
                  clearly of opinion that it was the apostolic method. Thereupon we entered into a
                  long argument on the word bapto, running out into baptizo, baptisma, baptismos,
                  and mergo, submergo, abruo, aqua, abluo lava, and ranio, raniomai, rantizo,
                  rantismos, rantisma, ranter, rantis, and then spoke of "much water being there,"
                  although so many people needed it to drink, and "going down into," "and coming up
                  out of," &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., but instead of convincing each other,
                  I grieve to say we came near losing our tempers. At last, he grieved me
                  exceedingly by requesting me to immerse him, and declared that if I refused,
                  either Mr. Squire or some one of the natives should perform the ceremony instead.
                  Making a virtue of necessity, as the saying is, I complied, July 28th, 1839.</p>
               <p>We now held meetings regularly every Sunday, in the large Assembly Room, I myself,
                  unworthy as I was, leading in the services. I selected the portions of Scripture
                  to be read with the view of favorably impressing the minds of the natives, and
                  expatiated upon the prophecies from Abraham down through a long series of years,
                  in what I then looked upon as an impressive manner. From Mr. Young I had little
                  assistance, though I always called upon him to speak, but it was with fear that I
                  listened, not knowing but that the next moment he would present some unsound
                  doctrine. Indeed my fears were not always ill founded, for often, instead of
                  referring to the Word itself to prove the truth of our religion, he wandered off
                  into scientific regions and the realms of nature for proofs of the reasonableness
                  of the commandments, and for analogies in the birth, temptations, sufferings, and
                  death of Jesus Christ. It seemed to me that he was little acquainted with the
                  Scriptures, and that, above all, his ideas were not very well fixed as regards
                  what makes a true Christian; for I could scarcely make him assent that it is
                  through the mysterious influences of the Holy Spirit that one is truly called. He
                  was too much like many in our own country, who think that it is by their reason
                  they are to understand and receive the terms of salvation. However, I always made
                  it a point to add something after he concluded, by which, in a very brotherly way,
                  I overthrew the fallacies and unsound doctrines he advanced. Mr. Squire, on the
                  contrary, though an unlearned man, made remarks to which no Christian could
                  object. It is true he dealt mostly in quotations of Scripture verses and phrases,
                  not always exactly connected, or which had reference to that which preceded, and
                  that he was a little discursive, and slightly tedious; "but as he had a loud
                  voice, and a fine tone, by which one word ran rapidly into another, the natives,
                  with their imperfect knowledge of English, looked upon him as superior to either
                  of us as a speaker; and Mr. Norris listened with his mouth partly open as though
                  Whitefield were speaking before him.</p>
               <p>Our religion being thus recommended to the natives, they began to take great pains
                  to understand it, and accordingly several copies of the Bible were made into the
                  Nedean tongue; and it was at the conclusion of the second rainy season,<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7230-00000024"/> that I had high prospects of the
                  conversion of the whole island. Indeed, those natives whom I have mentioned by
                  name, Ivy, Ethillon, and Gambia, with six others, were converted and baptized, and
                  joined with us in the organization of a church, named the 1st Presbyterian Church
                  of Nedea. In the other communities there was also a considerable feeling, and
                  several in each place united by my advice into churches, of the 2d, 3d, or 4th
                  Presbyterian Churches, as the case might be. Nevertheless, there seemed to be an
                  opposing influence, by which the 'great body of the natives kept back;' and
                  whether it was their depravity, or Mr. Norris, or Mr. Young, I know not, Still, on
                  the whole, we Were encouraged, and referred their backwardness to their Ignorance
                  of the subject, which we strove to dissipate. I must say in connection, and it is
                  with great grief that I make the statement, that Mr. Young refused to join the
                  church, because, as he said, he was opposed to all ecclesiastical bodies, and in
                  particular to all creeds, not thinking that they who are opposed to creeds settle
                  down in some belief, which of itself is a creed, whether written or unwritten; and
                  hence none but a skeptic can be Without a creed. Once or twice, when I was
                  receiving in members, and was reading over the confession of faith, which I had
                  perfectly remembered, and put in writing, and pronounced on the occasion, "thus
                  you believe," and "thus you believe," I detected a lurking smile on his
                  countenance, which, at the time, I confess it with more ingenuousness than
                  prudence, made me hate him with extreme hatred, and yet look upon him With grief
                  and pity.</p>
               <p>Thus it was that the breach I have referred to grew wider and wider. Still his
                  conduct towards me was always gentlemanly; he saluted me with a pleasant good
                  morning, and usually made some agreeable remark when we met, and so continued,
                  unless our differences in religion were called up, when some sarcastic or pithy
                  remark from his lips, aroused my bad feelings. I find in my journal several
                  conversations held with him about this time, out on looking them over, I think it
                  better to omit them altogether; an example, I am proud to say, which would benefit
                  the world, if followed by others more learned and talented than myself.</p>
               <p>At the conclusion of the second rainy season, and after we had lived on the Island
                  about fifteen months, as I was one day walking through a remote part of the
                  garden, I noticed a red soil beneath my feet, which instantly struck me might be
                  iron ore. Accordingly, I looked around and discovered that this earth extended
                  some little distance, whereupon I took a portion to the primitive copper forge,
                  and soon after had the extreme satisfaction of announcing to my companions and to
                  the natives the existence of a rich bed of iron ore. Now the natives had long
                  desired that this mineral might be found among them, and upon their wishes being
                  thus realized, they were highly pleased. The news quickly spread to every place on
                  the island, and that part of the garden where the ore lay was torn up and trampled
                  down by the many visitants. The discovery of a gold mine at the same time would
                  have been received with indifference, so little did they understand in what wealth
                  really consists. I know that there, are those disposed to ridicule the idea, that
                  real wealth exists in gold and silver; but here again I know the ground on which I
                  stand, for let men say what they will about gold not being good to eat or to wear,
                  it is a fact nevertheless, that it can be always exchanged for any kind of
                  possession, even for so abstract a thing as honor. Let me ask in turn what is land
                  good for? Can it be eaten or worn? Yes, gold is the foundation of all wealth; and
                  I venture to affirm, broad though the affirmation be, that the nation which has it
                  not is poor. It is true, however, that at that time iron was properly to be held
                  in high esteem by these people; but it is to civilized, not to savage nations,
                  that social maxims are applicable.</p>
               <p>A meeting was called to take into consideration the best plan for making a
                  practical use of this discovery, when, upon my representation, they were clearly
                  of the opinion that a furnace should be immediately built for smelting the ore, It
                  was proposed that every person on the island should contribute a certain
                  proportion of labor, which would entitle him to the benefits arising from the
                  works. But this I strongly opposed, not violently, but artfully, for I represented
                  that such an enterprise could not be carried on where many were engaged as
                  partners; and that as it was probable the garden would in a great measure be
                  destroyed, and the principal labor and care fall upon those to whom the garden and
                  edifice belonged, it would be better for them to be supplied with provisions from
                  the other communities, for which they could be paid in iron. This being assented
                  to, we took upon ourselves the erection of the furnace, which was a work of very
                  great magnitude, since there was no such thing as axe, saw, or chisel on the
                  island. This plainly was a difficulty first to be overcome, and we set about
                  manufacturing an axe from such pieces of iron taken out of the boat as had not
                  been used up, and finally succeeded, but it was a poor tool, for it scarcely
                  weighed two pounds; and although we had made it tolerably hard, it was after all
                  so soft that its edge turned a dozen times a day. With this tool, then, we
                  commenced, if I might say so, the great work of civilization. We cut down several
                  trees suitable for posts, beams, rafters, &amp;c., and hewed them to the proper
                  dimensions. Meanwhile a large group of natives was engaged in quarrying stone on
                  the bank, and fortunately on the very spot where we proposed to erect the furnace.
                  Another group set about moulding brick, which being laid in the sun, and properly
                  attended to, were burned very hard in eight or ten days. The coppersmiths all the
                  while attempted to extract some considerable quantity of iron from the ore; and
                  after spending some few months, really succeeded in obtaining about one hundred
                  pounds very well refined, which they worked into bars, Mr. Young now acted a noble
                  part, for seeing the immense difficulty which lay before us in our attempts to
                  change the iron into steel, and remembering the exact amount of carbon necessary
                  to be united with the iron, went into the little shop and gave such directions as
                  enabled the natives, in a short time, to produce carburet of iron, or cast steel,
                  which was so indispensable in our prospective operations. We now made axes, saws,
                  chisels, augers, &amp;c., whereupon our work progressed rapidly.</p>
               <p>In three months we raised a large chimney, and around it the frame of a suitable
                  building, but here came to a stand for want of boards to inclose and preserve our
                  works. In order to supply this deficiency, I represented that it was necessary to
                  build a saw-mill, and that there was a suitable seat about two miles up the
                  stream. After some opposition the proposition was assented to, and we removed with
                  our tools and forces to the woods, where in about two months we built a dam above
                  some rapids, and raised the frame of the saw-mill.</p>
               <p>Again, I am grieved to say, that my countrymen, with the exception of Mr. Squire,
                  lent me little or no assistance in these or in subsequent enterprises. I was
                  frequently up before light, when I went round to the rooms of such as were to work
                  that day, and often spent a good hour in getting them out, for they begged for a
                  little more slumber, they were so tired, they said, and two or three were in the
                  habit of wishing they had never seen me; but this was to have been expected, and
                  affected me little. After breakfast I hurried to the brick-yard or quarry, or to
                  the woods, where they were getting out timber, or wheeling dirt for the dam.</p>
               <p>It may be proper or improper, according as the reader estimates me, that is as a
                  vain or a plain-speaking man, for me to describe myself as I appeared at this
                  juncture. However, let him conceive me in my shirt and pantaloons, and in a loose
                  cotton garment, somewhat like a morning gown, of native manufacture, also cloth
                  slippers of a red color; the gold chain of my gold watch running around my neck,
                  and terminating in the fob of my pantaloons, my hair well trimmed, and my face
                  well shaven. Conceive me, too, as I step from stone to stone, or from timber to
                  timber, or in great haste writing some directions for workmen laboring in another
                  place, or making calculations on a talipot leaf, and<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000025"/> ever and anon giving the cheerful cry of "Come,
                  boys! come, boys!" while at the same time the fifteen hundred workmen look upon me
                  as their superior in skill, energy, and strength. I ought to add to this, that on
                  my left cheek I have naturally a deep red spot, of the size of a twenty-five cent
                  piece, which, though I once looked upon as a disgrace, I have come to consider as
                  indicating nothing un-amiable. Now, really, why should I make such a remark as
                  this? But as regards my superiority to the natives, I will say that frequently two
                  of them, and sometimes three, were unable to move a stone or hewed stick, when I
                  alone took hold, and with ease moved it to the required place. Or when some one
                  was chopping off a large log, and had stopped to look at his bungling work with a
                  species of despair, I was wont to take the axe into my own hands, and chopping out
                  a clean calf, threw off large smooth chips to the admiration of every one near by;
                  and if there is any kind of farm work in which I can excel it is in chopping; for
                  this day I can chop and put up my two cords, though I grant it is a species of
                  emulation upon which no man who values himself for his intellect ought to enter.
                  Still it is an honor for a man to know how to take hold of any kind of work,
                  though to be forced to do so for a living, is quite another matter. Now a few
                  words as regards Mr. Squire. He also was well acquainted with most branches of
                  industry. However, being of rather light frame, though very tall, and of an
                  ingenious turn of mind, he seldom took hold where much strength was required. But
                  he was an invaluable assistant in contriving and inventing; he understood the use
                  of almost all kinds of tools; he could weld iron, joint a board, lay out a frame,
                  turn brass, iron, or wood; and, in short, if we except a hasty temper, he was as
                  much of a genuine Yankee as one will find in all New England.</p>
               <p>Mr Young never came near the saw-mill, unless when walking through the woods he
                  chanced to approach us. Mr. Griffith sometimes assisted me, but behaved rather
                  coldly, though as I have said before, he took but little apparent interest in any
                  thing. As for Norris, he came around frequently, but never to assist in any kind
                  of work. He spent his time in the garden, and in walking about the island with Mr.
                  Young. Once as I was busily engaged, I saw him stand laughing at me with a
                  sneering cast of countenance, and when I inquired why he was so pleased, he said
                  he was considering how easily I kept my slaves in subjection. I felt myself
                  insulted by this remark to such a degree, that I confess I seized a brush and took
                  after him, when nothing but his flight saved him a thrashing-unless I got one
                  myself.</p>
               <p>I began now to have some difficulty with the natives because they became tired of
                  working on so long a job, without any clear idea of what the fruits of their
                  industry were going to be. I did not blame them much since their regular habits
                  were hereby interrupted. The hours of work were from daylight to nine o'clock, A.
                  M., and from four o'clock, P. M., to twilight, and sometimes to ten o'clock, when
                  the moon was full. Those who worked on the saw-mill usually slept in the woods
                  under talipot leaves, and only returned to their homes on Saturday night, their
                  food meanwhile being brought to them by the boys; but this course impaired their
                  health and occasioned dissatisfaction. One day I was several times addressed by a
                  diminutive term which some of my comrades had undoubtedly put in circulation, well
                  knowing that the natives did not understand the contempt thereby intended, and
                  which was, I regret to say, "Old Granny," but when they saw that I was offended,
                  they asked my pardon, and I heard it no more. However, by perseverance, the mill
                  was completed, and I had the satisfaction of hoisting the gate myself, and sawing
                  through a ten foot log.</p>
               <p>Dec. 16th, 1841.—The natives now took heart, and well knowing how I had carried on
                  the work through every discouragement, looked upon me with increased respect and
                  upon my companions with a species of disapprobation. A sufficient quantity of
                  lumber was now sawed out and rafted down to the furnace, which in a few days was
                  comfortably enclosed.</p>
               <p>The rainy season now commenced again, but we had sufficient in-door work laid out,
                  to keep us busy, that is, to put the furnace in operation. But another great
                  difficulty now arose mountain high, so to speak, and at one time, almost made me
                  conclude I would abandon the whole enterprise. We must needs have bellows to
                  complete our blasting works, and for this some kind of leather was indispensable.
                  When I proposed killing a dozen deer or so for this purpose, the natives all arose
                  in opposition and declared that they could consent to nothing of the kind. They
                  offered us, however, a plenty of human skins, which, of course, we refused to
                  touch. Our works were now brought to a stand, and several weeks were spent in this
                  frivolous matter; but at last our comrades induced them to give their 'consent, or
                  rather that they would not oppose us; and accordingly, I and Mr. Squire, one
                  morning with hammers in our hands, killed eleven deer by knocking them on their
                  foreheads. We then skinned them, but we took their carcasses into a certain cave
                  where we preserved them with salt, and afterwards hung them up to dry, so that at
                  last we tasted of meat once more. The skins we tanned, and by the time we were
                  ready to use them, stretched them upon the bellows frame where they did excellent
                  service. Now, although we had slain these deer in the quietest manner possible,
                  out of respect to the natives, and so that the other deer had not the least sight
                  or smell of their dead companions, yet after this, the natives over the whole
                  island complained that a deer could no longer be approached, and that on seeing a
                  human being he fled with the utmost speed into deep woods, or to the inaccessible
                  crags and cliffs of the mountains. But this was of no consequence.</p>
               <p>March 12th, 1842.—We blew our first blast in the furnace, and thus continuing for
                  twenty-seven successive days, we turned out fifty-five tons in pigs and blooms.
                  This being done we began to melt for castings; and having previously made a
                  variety of patterns, we cast kettles, stoves, the several parts of a steam-engine,
                  and rolling-mill, and much mill gearing, and afterwards, a peal of bells, besides
                  several small articles of great use and convenience. The natives soon began to see
                  what sort of man I was, and what was a greater consequence, began to realize that
                  a little labor and energy are necessary for the accomplishment of any work of
                  value. Nevertheless there were a few young men with whom I had difficulty, even
                  previous to this I had much to do to keep them within bounds, for they refused to
                  go off into the woods to help build the dam. They said that I could come here and
                  go there, that if there was any thing good to eat in a certain place, I was sure
                  to be on hand, that I never once slept in the woods, but always returned at a
                  seasonable hour, and they frequently added they could not see why I should fare so
                  much better than those' who did all the work. Now whether these things were true
                  or, false, I shall not stop to confess or disclaim, but it is very well understood
                  that a manager has advantages over those who merely labor, and this is certainly
                  proper, for he bears the same relation to them that a man does to a beast, and
                  knowing that such a state must necessarily exist, I made little or no reply, save
                  by a smile or a good-natured banter, which goes a great ways towards quieting such
                  spirits. However, it was found important to keep these discontents in subjection,
                  and to this end three of the oldest and most respectable of the natives were
                  directed to reprimand these young men, which species of punishment at that period,
                  being equal to an arrest or imprisonment; with us, had, for a time, the desired
                  effect.</p>
               <p>The demand for our castings now became very great. All the other communities asked
                  to be supplied with them, but it being evident that we could not furnish them
                  gratis, the question quickly arose, how much, and in what way they were to pay us?
                  My mind had already solved this query; for I had thought it over for many months,
                  that is, we ourselves would build a railroad to the western<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000026"/> extremity of the island, and we would take pay for
                  our castings in labor. After getting this plan completely matured, I made the
                  proposition, and showing the natives the advantages which must necessarily arise
                  both to themselves and the rest of the island, increasing the means of
                  communication, transportation, &amp;c., they united in one voice that the railroad
                  should be built. Mr. Young, who was in the room, at this stage of the proceedings,
                  got up and went out, and afterwards remarked that he could not bear to see the
                  people led so easily into a work of that kind, but it was of no use for him to say
                  any thing, and he preferred to retire by the sea shore and meditate on the folly
                  of mankind. I thought it would have been better had he meditated on his own folly
                  in contriving plans to destroy my influence and blast my character, or, indeed,
                  meditate on his counterfeit religion.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the natives of the other communities were duly notified of our
                  designs, and that they must be ready to cut timber, excavate, drill, &amp;c., and
                  we immediately entered upon the work. After much solicitation, Mr. Young consented
                  to survey the ground, not, he said, because he was in favor of the enterprise,
                  but, seeing we were determined upon it, he could save us a thousand mistakes,
                  which he foresaw would arise did he refuse; but although he did his work
                  faithfully, and listened to all my suggestions while I traveled with him as
                  assistant engineer, yet I could seldom get him to speak a word, and sometimes he
                  stood stock still when it was evident the road must go through a banin or coco
                  grove, looking around and sighing, and when I offered a penny for his thoughts, he
                  took up the chain and traveled on, and not a word fell from his lips. I was
                  grieved at this; however, I soon forgot it; still, continual dropping wears away
                  the stone.</p>
               <p>It was about this time that I introduced one of the master machines of
                  civilization, that is, paper money. Mr. Squire executed some copperplate
                  engravings which were printed upon notes that promised to pay a certain number of
                  pounds of castings to the bearer, and although they were at first looked upon with
                  suspicion, yet when it was seen that the castings were always ready when they were
                  presented, the natives came to look upon them as quite convenient. Shortly after,
                  Mr. Squire and myself chiseled out several hundred weight of the silver
                  before-mentioned, and, indeed, exhausted the mine, when we coined it into dollars,
                  halves, quarters, dimes, and half dimes, and frequently took occasion to redeem
                  our bills in ready money, which, becoming now to be understood, passed quickly
                  from hand to hand, and was looked upon as possessing a real value. It was thus I
                  established a bank, and blessed the natives with a mixed currency, such as has
                  made the people of the United States, and some countries of Europe, so extremely
                  happy. It is true that I disguised my approaches, for I well knew that mankind are
                  suspicious, and I well knew, too, that they arc not fit to manage their own
                  affairs, notwithstanding they really think they do so by electioneering and
                  voting. And I knew very well too, that as society on the island was passing into
                  the civilized state, everything would run to destruction unless there was a Great
                  Regulator, that is a Bank, which, through the power of money, takes hold of
                  society as galvanism does of a corpse. Thus fortifying the new order about to be
                  established, I looked forward with joy and exultation.</p>
               <p>The furnace was now in blast every day, and we cast rails, car wheels, axles,
                  &amp;c., continually. The mechanics were constantly engaged in building carriages
                  and cars, and in keeping our vast machinery in order, for since I pushed
                  everything to the utmost, something gave way almost every hour. Nor did night even
                  restore silence. From nearly every part of the island, was it ever so dark, the
                  fire of the furnace was seen rising upwards, and if the wind was favorable, the
                  sound of the mighty trip-hammer, run by a steam engine, was heard at all hours in
                  the remotest places. Now, as I was the chief superintendent of these works, I had
                  scarcely a moment's spare time. I was up at all hours of the night, and seldom
                  slept more than five hours in twenty-four. Some days I walked the whole length of
                  the line of work, that is, to the extreme western point of the island and back
                  again, by sundown, then spent the greater part of the night in moulding some
                  delicate pattern, and yet was in excellent health and spirits. The turbulent young
                  men again gave me great trouble, and I was forced to dismiss ten or fifteen as
                  wholly irreclaimable on account of idleness and bad habits, and what they did,
                  thought and said is too degrading to be repeated.</p>
               <p>In about four months the natives paid up for their castings, and then, as they
                  were willing to work on till the road was completed, we paid them every estimate
                  day in bank bills, which, as I have said above, passed readily. Some of the
                  natives now thought their health would be improved should they wear some clothing,
                  for, being exposed to the heat by day, and to the dews by night, they were
                  attacked with divers diseases, particularly by the tropical fever and ague, which
                  was occasioned by the dews, as I myself afterwards experienced, for it is very
                  copious, and out of it is generated a noxious vapor which adheres to the skin as a
                  thin scurf or slime, penetrates the pores and enters the lungs, where it adheres
                  to the sides of the cells as a gummy mucus, producing deep-seated colds, and,
                  finally, a wasting of the body not unlike consumption. Clothing, therefore, was
                  very proper, and upon this hint I enlarged the cotton fabric establishment, and
                  sought out several ingenious natives to cut and sew, whereby those who wished were
                  supplied; and, presently, as the customs and genius of civilization came to
                  exercise the greater influence, those engaged in other occupations dressed
                  themselves also, the main style being a flowing shirt, or simply a pair of
                  trowsers, and this went on till the tailors, by practice, came to excel, when they
                  aimed at grace and beauty, and added tassels, fringes, buttons, and bells, and
                  finally, it was accounted indecent not to cover the body with some kind of
                  apparel. Thus a new branch of industry was opened, and as I, the superintendent of
                  the railroad, had this monopoly in my hands, I made it go far towards paying for
                  the labor which was performed.</p>
               <p>I ought to add, that all along the line of the works I caused small houses or
                  shanties to be erected for the accommodation of the workmen, where they lived week
                  in and week out, not in elegance or ease it is true, but in rather a rough way,
                  and where they contracted some sad habits, heaven knows how; still I pushed the
                  road forward, and finally had the extreme happiness to see it completed, though I
                  can never recount with what anxiety, I might add pleading and exhortation, and
                  immense labors and watchings in counteracting the pernicious influence of Young,
                  Griffith, and Norris, and the idleness and indifference of the natives
                  themselves.</p>
               <p>The road was 18 miles in length, and, for almost any country, might have been
                  called a grand if not a stupendous enterprise. There was a tunnel of eight rods
                  through the solid rock, whence the track issued upon the iron-bound coast, and
                  altogether cost one million six hundred thousand dollars, over and above the
                  amount which was due on castings, which, per ledger face, was $28,200 15, for the
                  payment of which I issued bank bills, having, at the same time, specie on hand for
                  their redemption, as well as much other paper in circulation, to the amount of
                  $18,542 24.</p>
               <p>July 1st, 1843, we gave notice that the ears would run through to the west end of
                  the island on the 4th inst., and I spent the greater part of the night preceding
                  the memorable day in the engine house with the engineers, oiling, screwing, and
                  unscrewing, for the locomotive was with difficulty put in operation. About
                  daybreak a company of young men gathered in the depot making unseemly noises, but
                  let me pass over them.</p>
               <p>At sunrise the bells rang and the cannons roared, the doors were opened, the
                  locomotive came forth glittering with polished steel and brass, and seeming like
                  an intelligent creature. Mr. Squire being the principal engineer ran it up the
                  track half a mile, then backed down to the passenger cars. Of these, there were<pb
                     n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7230-00000027"/> three in number, entitled in large
                  letters "Pacific and Jackson forge transportation Co." Ivy, who had been appointed
                  conductor, ran along opening the car doors and crying with appropriate haughtiness
                  "All aboard, gentlemen! <emph>all</emph> aboard!" Again the bells rang and the
                  cannons roared. The natives crowded in, when Mr. Squire let on the steam, and away
                  we went in fine style. From the hindermost car floated the Star Spangled Banner,
                  and over the locomotive, as taking the precedence, the Nedean colors, whose device
                  was a banin tree surrounded by waves, and underneath, these words: "The Island of
                  the Sea adopted of American Liberty and Christian civilization." We passed by the
                  saw mill, which, for occasion, was in full play, and shortly arrived at the Depot
                  of the first community, where two other passenger cars were attached, and away we
                  went again. Passing through the tunnel we flew along the iron-bound shore. Here
                  was wild and romantic scenery. Thousands of sea birds were started from their
                  dwellings, and the sea roared and threw up clouds of mist. We were now near the
                  termination of the road. We went through a pass in the hills, and descending from
                  a considerable elevation, came in sight of the edifice. How the alarm triangle
                  echoed among the hills! and with what exultation did we pass the assembled
                  multitudes!</p>
               <p>A fine dinner was served up in the grove, over which, as a matter of course, I was
                  called to preside. Several toasts were drank and one being complimentary to
                  myself—but let me not repeat it—indeed for want of room, I must pass to other
                  matters, and it is enough to say, that we returned in good season, and though we
                  run off the track without doing much injury, or any blame attaching to any one,
                  every body was highly delighted and exalted in anticipations of the blessings
                  which the road would confer upon themselves and distant generations!</p>
               <p>About this time the management of the bank and furnace began to attract attention,
                  for in the natural progress of things, the people had become jealous, and I was
                  called upon to give an account of the business I had transacted from first to
                  last. I was glad this requisition was made, because I was ready to show that the
                  bank and furnace had made money, and at the same time, the people too. This I did
                  to the satisfaction of every one, excepting some few, who cried out that my
                  conclusion was a juggle and a cheat, but they made little impression. Gambia made
                  speeches in my favor, in which he granted some things, but where much work was
                  done lesser evils would arise, that is apparent evils, and if one were to look
                  around him, he would see such improvements effected in a short time, as they
                  themselves would never have been able to introduce, which course cemented the bond
                  of friendship that had existed between us. Thus by his influence I was entirely
                  exonerated, and was enabled to carry out the plans which I had proposed to
                  execute. The Bank now became regularly organized, having Stockholders, Directors,
                  President and Cashier, clerks, &amp;c. A suitable building was erected in a grove
                  near the edifice, here at the usual hours we did such business as is usually
                  transacted in such establishments, and whence issued to every part of the island,
                  invisible cords and bands which were finally destined to bring all classes to one
                  common want, that is the want of money.</p>
               <p>I must remark in this place that for want of room, I have been forced to omit the
                  particulars of many things, as, how we put such and such machinery in operation,
                  how we manufactured powder and paper, how we laid corner stones and proceeded with
                  durable walls, how disappointments, vexations and losses arose, but the
                  intelligent reader must supply these lapses, and imagine that we rose in the
                  morning as other folks do, and planned, twisted, scolded, congratulated, labored
                  &amp;c. &amp;c., much as is the case in new villages and plantations on our
                  western borders.</p>
               <p>The railroad being now completed the natives led an easy life, and the island
                  enjoyed a high degree of prosperity. But there was an evil, if we may call it an
                  evil, now existing, which was, the natives had somehow got the notion that labor
                  was disgraceful. They saw clearly enough that those who had worked the hardest,
                  had become dull of apprehension, or that originally they were so, for still they
                  were willing to hire themselves out for money, and that they were looked upon by
                  the great majority as persons to be both pitied and abused. However their number
                  was quite small and daily growing less, the greater part living in an idle state,
                  so that the kitchen work became repulsive, and even the gardens were poorly
                  attended. When a moment's assistance was required, and a dozen men were standing
                  by, no one was inclined to stir a step unless addressed by name, then we could see
                  with half an eye, that when the assistance was obtained, it was from a lazy man.
                  This notion, that is, that labor is disgraceful, becoming prevalent, and being
                  also one of the first and main ideas of the civilized man, I saw with joy that a
                  revolution was inevitably approaching. Let it not be said that I am either a foot
                  or knave thus to rejoice in this state of things. There is deep philosophy in
                  every thing appertaining to the foundations of a true state of society, and it may
                  be presented in a few words. Civilization, the highest state to which man can
                  attain, can only be established by one class being placed above another, and this
                  for the wise reason, that the majority who are lowest in the scale may continually
                  strive and exert their powers to excel, for where all classes are on a level, and
                  enjoy equally the comforts of life, there is no incentive to competition; and
                  consequently all exist in a state of depressed mediocrity.</p>
               <p>An event now naturally transpired which is worthy of note. Two of our young men,
                  one night, went over to the nearest community, and skulked about till all were
                  abed, when they went from room to room and picked the sleepers' pockets of what
                  paper and silver money they could find. Some of the bills being marked in such a
                  manner that they were easily identified, the thieves were detected in a very few
                  days. This event produced great commotion. I saw several tears shed; a new class
                  started up against me; they declared that such a thing as thieving had been
                  unknown for ages, and now—but for want of room I cannot insert their upbraidings.
                  I was sorry, it was true, sorry within myself, really and positively, and yet I
                  was glad, joy mingled with my sorrow, and I determined to carry out the grand
                  principles by which civilization, even by which the universe is governed, that is
                  by antagonisms, and set still other screws in motion, to speak in a figure, while
                  I would give another turn on those already entered. In a few days I caused several
                  dozen door locks to be thrown into market, and finding these sell, a locksmith
                  establishment went immediately into successful operation.</p>
               <p>Of the first Presbyterian church, in which I was most particularly interested, I
                  must say a few words. Every Sunday we had preaching, sometimes by myself, but more
                  frequently by Gambia, who, though not clearly apprehending the whole creed,
                  entered into the Calvinistic spirit with such energy, that his discourses were
                  lovely. Our members increased rapidly, and on communion day, when over one hundred
                  sat down at the table, my soul was elevated to the seventh heaven. On Thursday
                  evening we had prayer meetings for the conversion of the heathen, and on the first
                  Monday evening of each month took up contributions to assist the home mission. How
                  goodly are the tabernacles, O Jacob!</p>
               <p>One Sabbath afternoon, Mr. Young came into my room, and taking my hand in a,
                  friendly way, helped himself to a seat. I was somewhat vexed at his breaking in
                  upon me, for I loved to observe the day, although at that instant I had forgotten
                  myself a little, and was writing; however, I overcame my scruples, and we entered
                  into conversation. The object of his visit presently became manifest, for he said
                  he had been informed on good authority that I had said he had no religion, and was
                  little better than an infidel. If I had made any such assertion he wanted to know
                  it, but if I had not, he wished I would disclaim it, for his feelings were very
                  much hurt. In reply, I told him that I did not remember making any such
                  observation, and in fact not knowing what he really did believe, though he might
                  be judged by his fruits, I was not competent to make any such statement<pb
                     n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7230-00000028"/> ment. Still, perhaps, his backwardness in
                  the cause of religion might have given occasion, and many times one says idle
                  things. He said he knew he came far short of his own standard, that he went astray
                  continually, still what little he might have strength to accomplish, he thought
                  should not be berated by one who is a Christian simply because he could not agree
                  with him in some minor points. I said then, to speak plainly, that he had taken
                  only one step in the Christian path, and even that one, namely baptism, was not
                  correct, though it might answer. I had neither time, patience, not inclination to
                  go over this ground again, and besides he had not only neglected, but refused to
                  join a church of professing Christian the only one, too, within a circuit of ten
                  thousand miles, and had only once partaken of the Sacrament; and if he called
                  himself a Christian, I was very going into" and Newell, a good much mistaken as to
                  what the Gospel requires.</p>
               <p>In reply, he touched upon primitive baptism, not forgetting "going into" and
                  "coming out of," something he said about Messrs. Judson and deal about toleration,
                  and popery not being dead, a vast sight about creeds, and finally that the true
                  church was not to be tied to forms and traditions, and old opinions; and he was
                  not certain but that many who had never been inside a church—. But again want of
                  room compels me to be brief.</p>
               <p>I told him I was not going to dispute with him, but recommended him to study his
                  copy of the Bible, for he had written one out with his own hand; and moreover, I
                  told him that he could never be a true heir of heaven, at least I doubted it very
                  much, While he continued supporting a heathen state of Society, and in opposition
                  to the civilization of his native land. This I called settled. Upon this he rose,
                  and going to the lattice, stood some little time without speaking; and whether it
                  was the wind among the trees, or some little insect, or his own lips, that uttered
                  a very faint whistle, I cannot say, but presently he resumed his seat, and said
                  that on that subject we were farther apart than 61 Cygni is from the centre of the
                  earth's orbit, if contrary opinions may be compared in such a manner. He said he
                  understood my doctrine of antagonisms or contraries, and what was more, he
                  admitted it to be every way sound and correct,—society should be based upon
                  antagonisms, but these antagonisms should not be sought after in a devilish state
                  of society,—his very word, where every man's interest at the bottom of his heart
                  is opposed to his neighbor's, for they already exist in our nature; and it is our
                  duty—here he spoke with insolence—to seek the most favorable social circumstances
                  in which the contraries of our nature may be fairly and evenly balanced against
                  each other. Then, said he, you have such a result as arises from the centripetal
                  and centrifugal forces, such as we see where the negatives and positives of
                  electricity and chemistry combine, nay, such as we see through the sexes of
                  plants, flowers, animals, and men</p>
               <p>To this I replied that civilization is the state of society God himself has
                  appointed, or at least permitted, which is pretty much the same thing; and I told
                  Mr. Young that if new were disposed to batter down that, he was assuming an awful
                  responsibility. I bid him beware of any such undertaking, or he might expect the
                  withdrawal of what little spiritual light had been given him.</p>
               <p>He said he was sorry he saw he must stand alone, but he felt bound to act as his
                  reason plainly dictated, and if he was wrong why he could not help it, but—Reason!
                  said I to Mr. Young, you have forgotten yourself, or have never learned that it is
                  to the Spirit, to the Comforter you are to look for light and assistance; and now
                  I hear you talking of reason, a light barely strong enough to lead a man to
                  destruction. Where is your faith, Mr. Young? Where is the love which late you
                  felt? Mr. Young looked rather pale, as thus I overturned his support; his lips
                  quivered, he attempted to speak, or it might be struggled not to speak, and went
                  out at the door, but turned presently, and with a sickly smile on his face,
                  remarked that he was sorry we agreed no better; then dismissing the subject tacked
                  of something else, and shortly after went away.</p>
               <p>The very next day I was informed that a new church was about to be established,
                  under the name of Christ Kindles, or Christ Lovers, having neither creed nor
                  discipline further than the Word itself, and of course that Mr. Young was the
                  principal leader. I could not be much displeased with this, for I saw in it the
                  germs of several other denominations, and I saw, too, in the midst of turning and
                  overturning, that the original church, the one to which I belonged, must be styled
                  the orthodox, and the others the heterodox, whence would spring Seceders, Arians,
                  Universalists, Campbellites, and Mormons, perhaps, for there is no end to these
                  divisions.</p>
               <p>All this was well enough, and the affairs of the island would have settled down
                  here, had not a gang of young men become so rude and lawless, as to make even a
                  casual meeting with them in an unfrequented place quite unpleasant, for they were
                  under no restraint, and had acquired a malicious and mischievous disposition,
                  which was annoying. What was worse, or in another view, what was better, they had
                  no particular friends, all classes were equally the subjects of their pranks. My
                  blood ran cold when I met them even in a public walk, for I knew they would insult
                  me; I knew they would stand after I passed,—perchance they would throw something
                  at me. But the best course I could take with them was to appear glad to see them,
                  and to treat them in a very friendly manner, although they deserved it so
                  little.</p>
               <p>For several weeks I had noticed Mr. Griffith and Young, and occasionally Norris,
                  in the furnace and workshops inspecting moulds, dies, and stamps, but they let out
                  not a word, though they were thick enough together. After a while, I came across a
                  miniature forge in a retired room, and in another room near by, heaps of plaster,
                  punches, matrices, gravers, &amp;c., which made me suspect they were entering upon
                  the counterfeiting business. I determined to keep my eye on them; but one morning
                  they surprised me by issuing a semi-weekly newspaper, called "The Pacific Aurora."
                  It was a very small sheet, and looked rather yellow, but all things considered,
                  was well executed, and the editorials were "quite spicy." Everybody was vastly
                  delighted with it, and by the appearance of the fifth number, the demand was so
                  great that thereafter it was issued daily.</p>
               <p>I was pleased with this evidence of their coming to their senses, and to show that
                  I could return good for evil, I caused the cars to run through with their mail by
                  the break of day. Then it was pleasing to see men reading the papers, not in a few
                  places, but wherever one might go, or grouped together discussing some topic which
                  the editor had presented; and nothing but politics were wanting to make the papers
                  highly entertaining, and life on the island an existence of pleasing excitement,
                  but politics, we had before long to our entire satisfaction.</p>
               <p>I have just mentioned the insubordination of the young men, and have spoken of
                  Norris as giving them encouragement in their ways, but about this time he began to
                  reform; he took to studying, and being assisted by Young and Griffith, led, for a
                  time, a harmless life; not so with the young men, they had grown from bad to
                  worse, and no one was shielded from their insults. And besides this, the school
                  having been very improperly neglected during the progress of, the public works, a
                  brood of young boys were coming on which promised to be unmanageable in the
                  highest degree. Already it was found impossible to confine them in school; several
                  strong measures were attempted, but things falling into confusion, the school
                  languished with a few poor sickly little boys, while their larger companions
                  roamed through the woods, or hung on the skirts of the dissolute gang, whose
                  pernicious examples they were striving to imitate. Several meetings were held, and
                  plans adopted to keep the young men in check; and for a short time they behaved
                  very well, but presently their good resolutions slipped from them, and one might
                  hear them in the depths of the night, giving way to their innate impulses by
                  yelling, racing, and otherwise disturbing those<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000029"/> who desired to be at peace. They had worked very
                  well on the furnace and railroad; and could work still if they were of a mind to,
                  But this they seldom did, and it was often thrown up by my enemies that their
                  bodies had grown disproportioned by carrying timber and stone, which was true
                  enough, let the cause be what it might be; and I had noticed too with disgust,
                  that their bellies had enlarged, and the lower part of their bodies become gross
                  and huge. In a standing crowd, they leaned upon my shoulder and sent foul breath
                  into my face, and they would come into my room, and with the utmost impudence seat
                  themselves, and address me in a familiar manner, asking me familiar questions; if
                  I remarked I was busy, or did not wish to see company, or even if I requested them
                  to retire, it was of no use, and I was often actually forced to lead them out of
                  the room; but this gave great offence, and thus, as I said above, they grew from
                  bad to worse.</p>
               <p>All at once it was reported with great consternation that these young men had
                  taken to eating meat, and it seemed to have come about in this wise, that is, not
                  taking their regular turn in doing the kitchen and other work which they had been
                  used to, there were many murmurs, particularly from the cooks, who being of the
                  younger class, felt the burden fall heavily upon them, and hence these young men
                  absented themselves whole days from the tables, and, lived in the woods, for they
                  had not lost all shame, and at last, it seemed that fifteen or twenty collected
                  together and killed a deer, after running him down, and roasting the flesh by a
                  fire, ate it with great voracity. It was reported that their manner of devouring
                  it was dreadful to behold, which meant, I suppose, that being hungry, and coming
                  to the natural food of mankind, they were, as one would say, a little piggish.
                  "Dreadful to behold!" Children, women, and weak men, are always seeing sights
                  dreadful to behold. One can never truly be a man till he becomes familiar with
                  hard sights. Our birth and our death are <emph>dreadful</emph> to
                     <emph>behold,</emph> and we ought not to be alarmed if during our lives we see
                  somewhat which corresponds with the two most important events in our existence.
                  However, this custom of a few young men soon became more general than the natives
                  were willing to acknowledge, and when we saw a fire by night among the hills, we
                  knew well enough what was going on.</p>
               <p>During the rainy season of 1842 and 3, the cooking and attendance became so bad
                  that I determined on keeping house myself, and accordingly when fair weather came,
                  I selected a fine site on the railroad and near the centre of the island, where. I
                  caused a neat and comfortable bamboo house to be built, whither I, Mr. Squire,
                  Gambia, Ivy, and several other natives removed, and had every thing to our notion.
                  Shortly after we built two other houses for our better accommodation, when we
                  began to conceive the idea of building up a town, which we afterwards did. I laid
                  out grounds for cultivating rice, maize, and for the rearing of fruit trees, but
                  continually felt the inconvenience of being without laborers, for the natives
                  refused to work for money; still, when the crops were suffering, those who were
                  best disposed, came up in a body, and did every thing necessary to be done, and
                  this they did, they said, for love, which made no difference to me, though of
                  course I thanked them to the best of my ability, still the want of regular
                  attendance was a serious evil, which was not overcome till some time afterwards. I
                  often wished there was some island near at hand inhabited by black people, or
                  those, even, who had the national peculiarity of red or white hair, or who were
                  supposed to be inferior in intellect, for either of these reasons would have been
                  sufficient for enslaving them; but unfortunately we were unable to carry out this
                  branch of civilization, or this feature of patriarchal existence.</p>
               <p>Things now becoming very unsettled, a few of the principal inhabitants held a
                  secret meeting, and resolved best to call a convention to take into consideration
                  the evils of the times, and to frame some laws for the better ordering of the
                  island. But the next day after the notices had been posted, the Aurora came out in
                  a highly incendiary article, which took such extreme ground as was not only
                  alarming but highly reprehensible. This article was headed, "Down with the
                  Lawyers." It commenced by abusing me and attaching to my measures and policy all
                  the evils that afflicted the people. Sneers were thrown upon the railroad, which
                  for good reason wanted business, underrated the furnace, and defined the bank as a
                  swindling institution. It concluded by pompously calling upon the honest,
                  virtuous, and yet uncorrupted, to step forward, and to save their innocence, to
                  refuse to acknowledge the currency, and to return, before it should be too late,
                  to the happy way of life they had so unfortunately abandoned.</p>
               <p>This article grieved me exceedingly, since I had done so much, and reflecting that
                  it probably came from Mr. Young, I was highly indignant. Accordingly I put a
                  bamboo cane under my clothes, and proceeded to the office with intentions better
                  than my temper. Forcing my way through a crowd of idlers I reached Mr. Young's
                  desk and demanded if he was the author of the said article. He said he was not,
                  but Ethillon immediately answered that he wrote it, and moreover that he would
                  neither cease to speak or to write in the same manner, till the evils of which he
                  complained were remedied. "Very well," I replied, and departed.</p>
               <p>Since there was so much opposition to the convention, the call was countermanded,
                  though a great many were still in favor of it, and failed not to advocate, it on
                  all occasions; and thus the people came to be politicians, to think and to talk,
                  and afterwards to vote, which are accounted the greatest privileges man has ever
                  enjoyed.</p>
               <p>About this time I formed the plan of building a small sloop for the defence of the
                  island, and actually got out the principal part of the materials, but finding so
                  many obstacles in the way, the work was abandoned. This I call one of my foolish
                  actions, for to suppose, or for myself to represent that I never do foolish things
                  would be untrue. I am fallible with common men, passionate at times, somewhat
                  headstrong, and yet on the contrary, could I permit myself to enumerate my
                  beneficent and praiseworthy deeds—but want of room again admonishes me that I
                  cannot make such reflections.</p>
               <p>Another circumstance transpired at this juncture, detailed in my journal, which,
                  on the whole, I think better to suppress.</p>
               <p>After these humiliations I did not carry my head quite so high, and it was several
                  months before I made any efforts to carry out my plans, for I looked upon the
                  treatment I had received as being instigated by malice and envy, and confined my
                  attention so exclusively and in such a straight-forward manner to the bank,
                  furnace, and factories, that in a short time I regained all my influence. But this
                  was more particularly because the seed I had sown was beginning to bear fruit. All
                  that the friends of anarchy could now do availed them nothing. Every day showed an
                  increased necessity for municipal regulations—every day silently, yet imperiously,
                  demanded the immutable laws which I stood ready to promulgate. To enact and
                  execute these laws a government and constitution were necessary. Petty thefts,
                  riots, and continual irregularities called for strong measures. What is a district
                  or country without magistrates, judges, lawyers, and constables? Nothing.</p>
               <p>Things had arrived at such a pass that all the young men and some of the adults,
                  among one-third of the whole population, refused to perform the labor necessary
                  for their subsistence, some more than others, it is true, and by consequence heavy
                  burdens fell upon such as were willing to support them. It is true the young men
                  would work a few days when they wanted clothing, or some article of finery which
                  was for sale, but when I told them that man was made to, work as long as he lived,
                  they took up their goods and snapped their fingers at<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000030"/> me in a manner exceedingly disdainful. Nor did they
                  take any pains to store their minds with useful knowledge, as every young man
                  should do, who is born to labor, that he may not lose those natural graces which
                  so much become his superiors; on the contrary, intellectual pursuits begun to be
                  held in contempt, and as for religion, it was seldom they went to church, or gave
                  any evidence that they were possessed of precious immortal souls. Here I must
                  venture the remark which often ran in my mind at that time, namely, that an
                  illiterate and vulgar companion is more disgusting than a refined and educated
                  villain. From all these considerations, then, it was evident to reflecting minds
                  that their society was verging upon the abominations of the most benighted heathen
                  lands.</p>
               <p>This, properly, is the place to state that many of the natives were taken sick
                  with disease which to them were previously unknown, such as fevers, fever and
                  ague, lived and lung complaints, catarrhs, fever sores, colics, inflammations,
                  &amp;c., of which some died. It was thought proper to bury them in the manner of
                  civilized people, and the Aurora every week noticed one or more of these events
                  under the head of "obituary." Upon this the people became alarmed, and knew not
                  what to do; my enemies aroused their superstitious terrors, and some of my friends
                  privately informed me that I would do well to look to my personal safety.
                  Transition periods of society are always dangerous.</p>
               <p>At last, a Convention was called, and a committee appointed. I, of course, was
                  chairman of said committee, and was directed to draft a suitable constitution.
                  Accordingly, I took that of the foundation of our government for a model, and
                  assuming in the first sentence that all men are born free and equal, went on to
                  say, that being in the progressive order of human events and activity, called upon
                  to disconnect ourselves with old associations, it was proper to state the reasons
                  for such disconnection, &amp;c., &amp;c. Then I drew up the articles of
                  confederation between the several communities or districts, which combination I
                  entitled "The United Districts of Nede," and gave to each freedom, jurisdiction,
                  and rights.</p>
               <p>Then I drew up bills for several penal laws, such as theft, burglary, robbery,
                  arson, treason, piracy, murder, and the like. It is true some of these crimes were
                  unknown, but a just and wise law-giver will take pains to provide for the
                  punishment of such crimes as the people may at some future time commit, or such
                  crimes as human beings have been guilty of from the earliest ages. I provided for
                  a President and Vice-President, for Secretaries of State, Treasury, War, &amp;c.;
                  for Collectors, Commissioners, and Supreme Judges; for the establishment of a
                  national mint, a shot tower, and for postal regulations, and all other things
                  necessary for the formation of a free and independent government. I was careful in
                  framing the international laws, corresponding to what with us are called our
                  "State's Rights," and also those for the arrest of fugitives who might break a law
                  in one district and fly to another where no such law existed, always providing for
                  their surrender. This difficulty, or multiplicity of legislation, I might have
                  avoided by bringing them all under one general and particular government, but I
                  chose rather that each district should make its own statute and municipal laws,
                  for such must needs be the case in order that their government should be the same
                  as ours, and indeed this is a legislative system of harmony in the midst of
                  diversity which is past human improvement.</p>
               <p>Pursuant to adjournment the Convention re-assembled, and expressed themselves
                  satisfied with the Constitution, for they saw that it was exactly what they
                  wanted. They were going to adopt it immediately, but when I represented to them
                  the evils of hasty legislation, they agreed to discuss the matter four weeks,
                  corresponding to the four months in our case, which was going upon fair grounds.
                  Thereupon the friends of anarchy and the writers in the Aurora commenced their
                  attacks on every article. They ridiculed the whole idea, wrote parodies, presented
                  what they called arguments, and slandered myself, I verily believe more than the
                  villains ever did Alexander Hamilton. Whatever morning I took up the paper it was
                  full of lies, but it was fortunate that at this juncture we completed our
                  arrangements for establishing a newspaper also, which we issued under favorable
                  circumstances, and named "The Constitution Star." I myself wrote the heaviest
                  articles, though Gambia was the ostensible editor, and we replied to their attacks
                  with suitable arguments, parodies, squibs, and invectives. Thus we came to have
                  two parties, each of which was clearly defined and effectively organized—one
                  advocating the Constitution and its appendages of laws and government, called the
                  Constitutional Party, and the other advocating simple justice with no written
                  code, which was the case; before we arrived, and called the Democratic Party. You
                  may be sure we had high times. The excitement was great. Politics, the noblest
                  science, was the business of all men. The Aurora called names and made
                  ungentlemanly allusions; the Star replied with more justice than dignity; the
                  Aurora entitled me an animal with very long ears; the Star rejoined that the
                  editors of the Aurora were sons of the females of a domestic animal, and unfit to
                  breathe, when the Aurora descended so low that we could descend no lower, and
                  treated them with silent contempt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Norris entered upon the newspaper war, and wrote something about the state of
                  the island before I commenced my improvements. He illustrated his subject with
                  such sea phrases as a ship stored with provisions, plenty and wholesome, calm
                  seas, piping breezes; and reefs, breakers, squalls, flying top-sails, broken
                  cables, and lost anchors, and much more to the same effect, which made me respect
                  the improvement he had made, while, of course, I despised his principles. However,
                  the Constitution party gained ground daily, which so enraged the Aurora writers
                  that they published articles of a shameful character, so much so, that it was
                  hinted to them they were liable to a personal chastisement. This made them raise a
                  great ado, such a great one, that on this account and the excitement which
                  preceded it, I have contracted a disgust for political papers, though I am forced
                  still to read them, if I would acquire a knowledge of passing events. For instance
                  I would like to inquire what kind of language is this which appeared in the
                  Aurora. "The ways of Providence are mysterious, and certainly past finding out;
                  but were one to decide agreeably to human foresight and intelligence, those five
                  men had better been swallowed up by the waves, than to have landed upon this
                  island." Again, "Especial Providence cannot be looked for in these later days,
                  else we might invoke lightning, or some casualty by which our evils may be
                  averted." Again, "poverty, immorality, and crime of every nature and name, and
                  disease, anguish, and death, disappointment, shame, and infamy, and deformity, and
                  idiocy, and madness, and the deepest despair, and the bitterest griefs, are
                  continually thrown up by the dark and foul sea of civilization."</p>
               <p>To this I must say, as I said in the Star: 1st. That Infidelity assumes a thousand
                  shapes and deceives in a thousand ways. 2d. History is black with accounts of
                  ingratitude to the good; there never yet lived a benefactor but was branded with
                  infamy—he endured hardships and privations, immense labors, ridicule and
                  contempt—often, imprisonment and death. And 3d. Every age hears howls and yells
                  against society; the historian hears it in Jerusalem from the Essenes, at Rome
                  from the Agrarian, at Paris from Rousseau and Eugene Sue, and at Lanark from
                  Robert Owen.</p>
               <p>At the end of four weeks the convention re-assembled. We met the most violent
                  opposition. A few heedless and poetical men recanted, but they made no great
                  impression. The wise and reflecting saw the absolute necessity for some restraint;
                  the constitution was thoroughly examined, amended, and, after a long struggle,
                  adopted by a great majority. The result was a cessation of hostilities. Many who
                  had been foremost in the opposition relented, and, like good citizens,<pb
                     n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7230-00000031"/> submitted to the will of the majority.
                  But, there was a gang of about 180, headed by Young, Griffith, Norris and
                  Ethillon, who were uncompromising, and expressed their determination to live under
                  their own jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>Then came the election for President, Governors, Representatives, Judges,
                  Sheriffs, &amp;c., and, as the salaries were something of an object, there were
                  many candidates in the field. Gambia and I were the Presidential candidates, but
                  he constantly declined though he did not positively refuse. For my part I did not
                  desire office of any kind—I preferred the sweets of private life; but as so many
                  of my friends insisted on supporting me, I consented to run. We had a hot election
                  and I was chosen by a majority of three votes. I was sworn into office March 4th,
                  1844, and, on the same day, delivered my inaugural address, which I look upon as
                  the best of all my written performances. But it is too long to be inserted in this
                  place, as it is closely written upon forty-four pages.</p>
               <p>The peace and tranquillity which succeeded my election silenced my opponents,
                  while I used my utmost endeavors to induce a state of prosperity. It was, of
                  course, found necessary to have a capital, and, as I had anticipated, the location
                  in which I had for some time resided, was selected for the seat of government. A
                  great number of names being proposed, that of Washington was finally adopted, and
                  it was laid out two and a half miles square, one quarter of the territory of
                  Washington, D.C., and into lots of different sizes, according to location, all of
                  which were sold in one day. A two story capitol was built during the summer,
                  principally of bamboo and sun-dried brick, and, by the time Congress met, Dec.
                  5th, was completed.</p>
               <p>At the same time the people adopted the isolated instead of the combined
                  household, and, in less than four weeks, more than one hundred and fifty dwellings
                  and shops were erected on Connecticut avenue, the name of the principal
                  thoroughfare, and adjacent streets. As soon as possible we built a jail, which was
                  one story high, thirty-two by forty-two, with six cells in the cellar, and we
                  furnished it with fetters, hand-cuffs, and straw-beds. This being done, eight of
                  the turbulent young men were caught, brought before the Grand Jury, bound over,
                  and found guilty. Six were sentenced to two months' imprisonment on bread and
                  water, and the other two were put under one hundred dollar bonds. We also built a
                  poor-house, eighty by sixteen, one story high, and, though rather shammily
                  constructed, it was received by the Commissioners, when those who had become
                  diseased and refused to join the rebels because they were ashamed to live upon
                  them, were sold to Mr. Squire, who agreed to support them for a weekly sum, with
                  the privilege of obtaining from them what work he could.</p>
               <p>A more radical and important change took place as regards real estate. The
                  wood-lands were sold for the support of government, and those who were richest
                  became the principal purchasers. Private country residences arose on every hand,
                  many were beautifully situated upon the hills and in the midst of extensive
                  landscapes. The office-holders became possessed of the plantations, for they had
                  the first choice, and built themselves nice country-seats. Thus all the land on
                  the island, except that belonging to the rebel community, became private property.
                  The poorer sort of persons bought from one to three acres each, which, being
                  cultivated with industry, yielded decent living to the household. Now since there
                  were no females among them, this term "household" must be understood as applying
                  to a group of three or more persons, who voluntarily united together that they
                  might have each other's society and assistance. And here I will say that all along
                  I have spoken of the Nedeans as being masculine, using the words his, him,
                  &amp;c., which ought to be taken as relative rather than personal pronouns. In the
                  third year of my administration the individual and isolated system became fully
                  established, and a stranger would have found it difficult to imagine that the
                  people had been born and brought up in the savage state. I was frequently amused
                  and instructed—nay, the world thereby was admonished with the fact that those who
                  had good intellects naturally took the highest place in society, and those who
                  were naturally dull sank to the rank of wood choppers and day-labours; as, for
                  instance, one who had good perceptives and reflectives was sure to be a lawyer,
                  physician, or preacher,—or who had good perceptions only, was a merchant,
                  tradesman, or artisan; but those whose foreheads were cramped and low, whether so
                  naturally or shrunken to that state through extreme labors, and who loved present
                  enjoyment better than prospective advancement at the expense of plain food and
                  self-denial, lived, as we say, from hand to mouth, and were frequently the dupes
                  of the crafty and designing.</p>
               <p>The northern side of the island being the most fertile, was the thickest settled;
                  and in one region, known as Flower Valley, about seven miles from the Capitol, a
                  village sprung up called Hamiltown, and became the seat of the principal
                  manufacturing establishments. It was located at the foot of the interior range of
                  hills, out of which a large stream fell into the valley, affording sufficient
                  water-power-and, overlooking the ocean and a great extent of farming scenery, was
                  by far the most pleasant and business town on the island.</p>
               <p>As regards the popularity of my administration it may be inferred from the fact
                  that, in the fall of 1847, I was re-elected by an increased majority! and
                  thereupon I congratulated myself that I had been instrumental in giving to the
                  poor Islanders the result of the experiments of a thousand nations, made during
                  the long period of six thousand years, and which, such a small number by
                  themselves would, perhaps, never have attained.</p>
               <p>Of the general prosperity of the island, of the public works, of the villages,
                  hamlets, and multitudes of farmhouses, and of the submission and order of the
                  young men who had given so much trouble, the Aurora newspaper scarcely deigned to
                  take any notice. It mentioned them it is true, but concluded with some such
                  thought as this, which I quote from an article on my second inaugural: "The
                  sceptre of civilization is now held by paws; which daily shrink into a slimy
                  softness."</p>
               <p>The church of which I was a member became very popular, and a house was erected
                  and furnished in a very elegant manner, which occasioned the Aurora to throw out a
                  query as regards the difference between it and a Roman Catholic church. In the
                  course of time two or three other churches were organized, to which some of our
                  members withdrew, but upon their own responsibility for we refused them letters,
                  simply because they said we were too proud—foolishly imagining that decency and
                  respect in those who stand highest in society is pride and ostentation. These are
                  they who measure themselves by themselves.</p>
               <p>I am now come to that point in my narrative, in which it is necessary to give an
                  account of a remarkable physical change which took place in the persons of the
                  natives, and which I am afraid the reader will find difficult to credit; still I
                  have hopes that as I have shown myself decidedly in favor of order, law, and
                  religion, he will take the following statement as every way worthy of being
                  believed:—</p>
               <p>March 23d, 1848.—Early in the morning I was awakened by the sound of many voices
                  in the street, and springing out of bed, not knowing but the people had revolted,
                  I went to a front window and saw in the twilight a company of persons assembled
                  before a house of one of the clerks of the treasury department. While I was
                  dressing myself, one of my friends, a native, came into my room, and with
                  confusion on his countenance, told me that during the night the clerk above
                  referred to was taken violently ill, and alarmed the whole neighborhood with
                  piercing screams. The most skillful physicians were called in, and every remedy
                  applied that their ingenuity could devise, but without the least alleviation. All
                  at once he pleaded with the company to withdraw, and requested only one physician,
                  whom he named, to remain. It appeared that immediately after, although the
                  particulars could not be exactly ascertained, the lower part of<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC7230-00000032"/> his body burst forth into that condition peculiar
                  to a female, as also the chest into that elevation common with the sex. At this
                  instant Her pains ceased, and at the last report she had fallen into a sweet
                  slumber.</p>
               <p>The natives were perfectly well informed as regards the nature of this
                  transformation, both from the sexes of animals, and our own account of ourselves,
                  and each one apprehending that he himself might at any moment be attacked in a
                  similar manner, the whole population was in a state of anxiety and alarm. But as
                  that day and the succeeding one passed off as usual, quiet was gradually restored.
                  On the third day after this event, I dressed myself with unusual care, and stepped
                  over to the house to witness myself this interesting person. She was sitting in an
                  easy chair, in a dress of loose pink cotton, and when I entered her face became
                  red with blushes. But as I seated myself with composure, and commenced a
                  conversation on ordinary topics, she became self-possessed, and at once manifested
                  the tact and grace of her sex. It may be thought impossible, yet nevertheless it
                  is true, that in the short time which had elapsed since her transformation, her
                  features had undergone a total change; rigid lines, embrowned complexion, and
                  everything harsh and irregular had disappeared, and she sat before me the most
                  beautiful woman that, with one exception, I had ever beheld. With a politeness
                  that, might take the name of propriety, I withdrew, without adverting in the most
                  distant manner to the change she had experienced, and walked by myself some time,
                  revolving in my mind such thoughts as ought not to be communicated.</p>
               <p>Seven days after this event, one of the merchants was attacked in the manner above
                  narrated, and after enduring the utmost pain for an hour and a quarter, at once
                  became a man, perfectly formed, and every way sound, except as regards the effects
                  of the spasms of pain. A beard immediately began to grow; and it was observed by
                  every one that when he got out, he trod the street with a prouder step, and more
                  independent air.</p>
               <p>It may not be superfluous to add in this place, that in less than ten days after
                  this occurrence, this merchant sought the society of the female above mentioned,
                  and frequently thereafter visited her with her approbation. In a short time I
                  myself was called upon to perform the marriage ceremony for these persons. This
                  event was further indicated by a change in the plate of the bank bills, for
                  several female figures were engraved, which so represented then less secret
                  charms, that our paper money was in great request.</p>
               <p>After this, scarcely a day passed in which some native was not attacked, and in a
                  short time became either male or female. And it was not long before they were
                  enabled to decide which sex had all along lain within them in embryo, though what
                  the indications were by which they determined, I did not learn, for about the same
                  time the affairs of the State took such a turn as to demand all my attention; and
                  finally, at the end of six months, more than seventeen hundred became thus
                  distinguishable as men and women. I am pleased to remark that the females were,
                  without exception, apparently from seventeen to twenty-five years, of age; and if
                  I were not a married man, I would take this occasion to describe the peculiar
                  style of beauties which were thus developed, still I think there can be no
                  impropriety in my saying, that they excelled in grace, elegance, archness,
                  roundness, vivacity, and attraction, or in whatever else adorns a female, either
                  in my own country or in Spain. Whether this superiority arose from their new
                  existence, as in a first age of the world, or from centuries of spare vegetable
                  diet, or from the former state of society, or, from the very joy they had in this
                  new existence, or whether it was from all these causes combined, I leave others to
                  decide. As regards the men they appeared to be from eighteen to thirty-six years
                  of age, and if afterwards they had not rejected the greatest blessings they were
                  capable of enjoying, I should be tempted to offer much in their favor, but as
                  affairs terminated, I am not disposed to say anything for or against them. It is
                  frequently the case during the life of a man, that his heart becomes so bitter
                  towards classes or individuals, either justly or unjustly, that he is continually
                  tempted to berate even their merits; and I have always accounted it magnanimous
                  under such circumstances if he pass them by with indifference or silence.</p>
               <p>One day I was astonished on being informed that Mr. Young was married to a lady
                  universally conceded to be the greatest beauty on the island, and particularly as
                  I had for some time been thinking of soliciting her hand myself; that is, in case
                  it should appear very improbable whether I should ever return to my native
                  country. Shortly after, Mr. Griffith, and even Norris, took themselves wives, that
                  is, they Were actually married, promising to protect, love, cherish, &amp;c.,
                  which surprised me, since men of their principles are fond of having women in
                  common. It was frequently reported that they had things very nice, and that they
                  pretended to be extremely happy; but what kind of lives they really led,—whether
                  they were cross and whipped their wives, or were, on the contrary, subject to
                  them, I never correctly learned, or if I did, failed to remember.</p>
               <p>I now return to governmental affairs, and my own personal history, hoping I shall
                  conclude what I have to say without another digression. I have already remarked
                  that I was re-elected to the Presidential, chair, by an increased majority, which
                  is sufficient to show that my administration was popular. But I have to confess
                  that in my private life I would have been more beloved, had I been more
                  condescending and familiar. But as every one has his failings, I had mine, and I
                  did not trouble myself because I was not perfect; nay, rightly considered, it does
                  not become the chief magistrate to descend to a level with the vulgar; he ought to
                  be dignified, and to retire within himself, even if it be contrary to his
                  disposition, for this he owes to the sacredness of his place, and the greatness of
                  his country. In this respect the Secretary of State, Mr. Squire, quite outdid me,
                  for he carried himself very loftily, and would seldom speak to a common man,
                  except on business. I had not expected him to turn out in this manner, but it
                  seems that the importance of his station puffed him up to an astonishing degree,
                  and almost completely changed his character. He dressed very genteelly, though
                  perhaps a little affectedly, and was always known by enormous shirt ruffles, which
                  were usually stained with bang juice, for since there was no tobacco on the
                  island, we chewed this as a substitute; and surprising as it may seem, he was
                  looked upon as a model by those who consulted the latest fashions.</p>
               <p>In order that the reader may gather more extended ideas of the society we
                  established, I copy several notices from the Star, since, when one takes up a
                  paper from Calcutta, New Holland, or the Sandwich Islands, he, reads such
                  documents with full as much interest as he does the editorial or selected
                  matter.</p>

                  <head>STARTLING INTELLIGENCE.</head>
                  <p>Our city is in a state of the most interesting excitement in consequence of the
                     lady of Mr. Vano, merchant, giving birth to a daughter this morning' at
                     sunrise, at their beautiful residence head of Connecticut Avenue. It had been
                     previously supposed by the lady, and has been generally understood, that this
                     is an event of a highly dangerous and distressing character; and, indeed, from
                     report, must be so in America; but now, in the person of one of our own race,
                     has been proved to be neither painful nor alarming.</p>
                  <p>It is not proper, we believe, to make any particular disclosures, but it is
                     certainly due to the ladies to state that this matter has been looked upon with
                     too much apprehension. Still, whether they may not in time, on account of diet,
                     dress, and sedentary habits, dread its approach, is, perhaps, not quite so
                     certain. At the hour of our going to press, 6 o'clock, P.M., the lady is
                     dressed, and, except<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7230-00000033"/> cept being a
                     little pale, is apparently as well as ever. The little stranger is very quiet,
                     and, during the afternoon, was called upon by the greater part of the
                     inhabitants of the city.</p>

                  <head>CORONER'S INQUEST.</head>
                  <p>Coroner's Inquest was held last evening on the body of a young man named Odin
                     Du Molin. He was found lying on a bed of rice straw in a deserted shed attached
                     to the Webster Coffee House. He had formerly been engaged in Prim &amp; Co.'s
                     store, as book keeper, but about three months since was dismissed to make room
                     one of their apprentice clerks. He was a fine penman, and had a thorough
                     knowledge of both languages. It seems that having endeavored to obtain a
                     situation in several places, but without success, he became ashamed to solicit
                     a place, and lived in great despondency, till about six weeks since he took to
                     drinking, which threw him into fits of delirium tremens. In this state he died,
                     and was hurried, unprepared, to the Eternal Bar.</p>
                  <p>Upon a post-mortem examination by Drs. Stork and Gimblet, it appeared that the
                     three stomachs were in a collapsed state for want of food, and that their coats
                     were inflamed and covered with purple pimples, which, being punctured, gave an
                     odor of ardent spirits. His brain, for the most part, presented a natural
                     appearance, though some of the blood-vessels were partly empty. Spirits,
                     however, were not detected in this organ. <emph>Verdict: That the deceased came
                        to his end by too much liquor and too little food.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the second instance of this kind, and calls loudly for the
                     establishment of an Intelligence Office, such as is common in American cities,
                     where persons out of employ, and employers in need of assistance, make
                     arrangements, through the keeper of the Office, advantageous to each other.</p>
                  <p>We hope the fate of this unfortunate young man will prove a warning to others,
                     that they may abstain from the intoxicating draught "which biteth like a
                     serpent and stingeth like an adder," and which makes them useless members of
                     society here, and subjects of Divine Judgment hereafter.</p>
                  <p>He will; be buried this afternoon in the new Potter's Field which the
                     government has gratuitously fenced out of Thorn Valley, on the President
                     Mountain road.</p>
                  <p>We are informed that the person, who is now a young lady, and who, agreeably to
                     the ancient state of nature, was destined to be his secret bosom companion, has
                     visited his remains. For some time she had been aware of this fact and was on
                     the point of revealing herself to him as such, but in consequence of her
                     transformation into a grosser state, and the modesty or shame connected
                     therewith, she forbore, and with extreme pain saw his destitute and forlorn
                     condition. This was extremely unfortunate, since she was possessed of
                     considerable money, earned before her transformation; and also because he died
                     without suspecting there was a single person living who held him in esteem. It
                     is idle for young people any, longer to wait for a reciprocal and natural
                     attachment, as in days gone by; our impulses, in matters of the heart, can no
                     more be depended upon, and we must be content to select our partners as
                     interest or fancy may dictate. It is useless to deny that the question does not
                     arise in our minds whether. we have not lost more than we have gained by being
                     deprived of the certainty, that we are living with the one created for us;
                     still, it is as useless to complain of the consequences of, the condition which
                     have, in a manner, forced themselves upon us. One consolation, however, must
                     remain, and of which Nature and Revelation assure us, that in a future state we
                     shall find our true companion, and love, at the fountain of love, the proper
                     object forever.</p>

                  <head>SUICIDE.</head>
                  <p>It is our painful duty to announce that our fellow citizen, Rev. Choy Y. Fox,
                     committed suicide, in his own room, some time before 11 o'clock, last evening.
                     His hired man, Lonvin Morning, had knocked several times during the evening,
                     that he might get his orders for the following day, but as he received no
                     answer, as a light was constantly burning, he entered, and found his master
                     lying across the bed's foot, with his throat cut from ear to ear. The first
                     impression of the neighbors, who entered upon morning outcry, was, that he had
                     been inhumanly murdered, but a note being found on his table, written in his
                     own hand, reveals the appalling fact, that in a state of temporary insanity he
                     had committed suicide. The note is as follows:</p>

                                 neither in heaven or hell. In a few hours I shall be at rest. I did
                                 believe in what I preached; I was in earnest to save souls, but I
                                 see by means of social improvement, that mankind not only here on
                                 this island but elsewhere, is lost the moment he is born, and there
                                 is no help for him; for he will not listen to the words of the
                                 Savior, and I myself, will not have him to reign over me. On the
                                 verge of the grave, I see clearly.—I see that Hell is here in this
                                 world, and not in another, and that it is the Devil which makes us
                                 fear to die. I see him now, he would persuade me that I am rushing
                                 into everlasting destruction—but in vain. Death is an angel of
                                 blessedness which is ready to conduct me from the horrible abyss of
                                 this world. I shall sleep sweetly, sleep in the land of darkness,

                                 eyer-to-be-adored Mysa. On the brink of the grave it is not a sin
                                 to love too well,—it is not improper to recall a beloved image,—not
                                 immodest to fancy she is in my arms. Seven times have I kissed her
                                 lips, and a thousand times have I gazed into her eyes, which is the
                                 only light of heaven I leave behind me. It is true that she has
                                 kissed me also, that her breath has expelled the blood from my
                                 cheek, that her arm has encircled me, and that I have held her
                                 happy hand in mine. I am distracted by the thought, that I must
                                 leave her,—but I am called hence,—I may not tarry in this
                                 world,—shame and pain, and premature old age, surrounded by a sea
                                 of crime and poverty, and wrong, await me,—and I shall presently be

                     undoubtedly superinduced the above state. Many people are alarmed on account of
                     this lamentable occurrence; and we are sorry to say, make it the basis of
                     renewed objections against our excellent religion, or, at least, against the
                     new state of society. It ought to be understood, that religion is a matter
                     entirely distinct from social or political institutions, and should never be
                     confounded; for these are of an external and transient nature, while the former
                     is internal, and has its source in the heart.</p>
                  <p>The funeral will be attended the day after to-morrow, at the 2d Presbyterian
                     Church, Hamilton street. Rec. Grig will preach on the occasion, from the
                     following text:—"Lover and friend thou hast put far from me, and mine
                     acquaintance into darkness." (<title>Psalm</title> 88: 18.)</p>

                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>With each year of my administration the people increased in prosperity, for
                     many acquired great riches, and at last, I was so extremely happy as to look
                     around me, and find my work accomplished. Nevertheless, it was at this very
                     time that my enemies redoubled their energies, for the avowed purpose of
                     overthrowing the government, and as they lived almost entirely on the
                     spontaneous productions of the island, they devoted their whole time to the
                     accomplishment of their object. They said, that they had waited and forborne,
                     and every one was beginning to be satisfied, that the combined order which had
                     been abandoned contained within itself the source of every enjoyment proper for
                     man. I tried to get them indicted by the Grand Jury, either as guilty of
                     treason, or as aliens, and of a foreign power, interfering with our Domestic
                     Institutions. Failing in<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7230-00000035"/> this, I
                     caused them to be harassed in divers ways, well understood by politicians, and
                     in this I was justifiable, for we were right, and they were wrong. No class of
                     men has the right, human or divine, to attack an existing government, for
                     governments, good or bad, are sacred institutions, and woe to him who shall
                     attempt to destroy them. For a long time the Aurora was filled with articles on
                     the Wealth of Nations, Political Justice, and the Rights of Man, and proceeding
                     step by step in their abstract propositions, came to conclusions most
                     abominable. It will be scarcely believed, that they maintained, that an
                     enlarged sense of justice ought to supersede a dependence upon written laws;
                     that it is really safer to trust to adjudication agreeably to man's natural
                     sense of justice, than to that which if founded upon legislative enactments,
                     for the reason, that it is impossible to anticipate what cases may arise, but
                     when a decision is had upon exact merits, it cuts through all doubts, quibbles,
                     and ambiguities. This is to assume, that man is a perfect being, who can be
                     governed by abstract principle like the angels of heaven, a stupendous error,
                     which many in our own country have the superlative folly to maintain.</p>
                  <p>One morning Gambia called upon me, and said he Was convinced the government
                     party was wrong, and hence it was his duty to oppose it. At first, I supposed
                     he was against executive patronage, and a bank, and that he would oppose the
                     aliens; but when he informed me, that it was the aliens themselves he proposed
                     to unite with, I am sure my countenance fell, and I could make no other reply,
                     than many times to repeat, "Very well." He said a good deal about anarchy
                     really existing, where law, and not justice predominates, which stuff so
                     enraged me, that I put my hand in my bosom, but instantly refrained, and after
                     a little, rising as though to hid him good morning, he departed, but no one can
                     imagine with what regret I stood by my window, and saw him cross the street and
                     pass away.</p>
                  <p>The same day the Aurora was brought into the House of Representatives, as was
                     usual when Congress was sitting, and soon attracted great attention, by a
                     notice to the effect, that they were ready to attack the usurpation, and they
                     hoped in a few months to witness its downfall. At the same time they referred
                     to a universal dissatisfaction existing among the people, as the basis of their
                     efforts. In another part of the paper a notice was inserted of a series of
                     meetings, to be held in different places, commencing that day in the Capitol
                     itself.</p>
                  <p>I now caused a member who loved me, both because he did, and because he had
                     borrowed money of me, something like $52,00, and who always held himself in
                     readiness to comply with my wishes, to propose a law corresponding with the
                     celebrated Alien and Sedition Law, of our own country, a severe, but salutary
                     measure, but found it would not do. Several speeches were made, in which it was
                     considered whether it was best to put them down or not, when Mr. Squire, who
                     was sitting in the gallery, interrupted the proceedings, by remarking that the
                     President ought to call out the militia. One of the members, who was unfriendly
                     to Mr. Squire, requested the Chair to call him to order. Thereupon, a
                     disgraceful scene occurred, which I had thought of suppressing, but as
                     accidents happen in the best of families, as they say, I will report it. Mr.
                     Squire skipped over the benches, and few down stairs. Then planting himself
                     before said member, lie asked him the meaning of such language, and demanded an
                     explanation. The member said he would not be insulted, and he wondered that the
                     members could sit still, while there was such a gross violation of order. The
                     speaker then called him to order, but he declaimed so loudly, and in such a
                     foolish manner, that the Sergeant-at-arms was bidden to take him into custody.
                     Upon this, he mounted one of the desks, and drawing his pistols, which I was
                     ashamed to see, defied any one who would approach him. When I saw that every
                     one was afraid of him, I took my sword cane in my hand, and drawing near, spoke
                     to him in an under tone, that he ought to be ashamed of himself. However, he
                     began to level his pistol at me, when I sprang forward, knocked his pistols
                     into the air, and seizing his leg, dragged him to the floor. Then, I boxed his
                     ears, tore off his ruffles, took him by the collar of his coat, pulled him out
                     through the front door, and let him slide down the steps. I watched him through
                     the key-hole, till I saw him gather himself up and go away. Now, the reader
                     might suppose, that a scene of this character were very unlikely to occur had
                     not affrays very similar taken place somewhere else.</p>
                  <p>When Congress adjourned at noon, it was reported that Gambia had given notice
                     in the morning, that he would distribute his property to the poor, and that
                     accordingly at his farm, about a mile distant, he had bestowed 800 bushels of
                     rice, 700 bushels of maize, and other provisions of considerable value. His
                     money he gave away also, and thus dispossessing himself of all his, property,
                     acknowledged himself a member of the community.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon Congress met, and adjourned on account of a foot-race which
                     was to take place. This concluded about five o'clock, when a band of natives,
                     mostly the seditious, came through the hills with music playing and colors
                     flying. When they passed the palm distillery, whose lofty chimney sent forth a
                     column of black smoke, they groaned seven times. It was then I saw by the looks
                     of the people, even of the citizens, that they had become excited, and I gave
                     up all hope, for in my own country, I had witnessed at least one political
                     revolution, and knew perfectly well what to expect from the blind multitude
                     under such circumstances. Still I was determined to maintain my ground, to
                     stand fast by my principles, while I had a breath of life remaining. I stepped
                     into the refreshment-room in the basement of the Capitol, and took a little
                     weak wine. Then with a few of my friends, I mounted to the roof where we
                     overlooked the multitude. Gambia was the principal speaker on this occasion,
                     and although I could not hear him, I read his speech next day in the Aurora,
                     the number containing it now lying before me. If I thought that one-half of my
                     readers would not skip it, I would certainly insert it in this place, since it
                     is frequently necessary to let an opponent speak for himself, that he may
                     furnish his own refutation. But speeches are so common with us, as to be read
                     only by men of inferior minds, as is instanced by the fact, that I have heard
                     some whose opinions I value, say that they ask one dollar for reading the
                     President's message, and fifty cents for the Governor's, indicating a
                     reprehensible indifference I grant, but with all my prejudices, I have nothing
                     to say in favor of any long-winded speeches.</p>
                  <p>But to return. Several of the principal gentlemen declared themselves against
                     the government, and two members of Congress. This was as I had expected, and I
                     was sick. However, Congress met the next day, and still continued to meet; and
                     still the Capital was a well populated town, for the inhabitants of cities and
                     towns are usually too much in love with their way of life to become really
                     revolutionary. They may clamor, and form mobs, and blow their foul breath in
                     each other's faces, but presently they sink back to their shops and hovels,
                     till another rout is raised, then they rush out again.</p>
                  <p>It was now suggested that our differences might be settled by diplomacy, and as
                     we all favored this idea, we notified our adversaries to appoint a person whose
                     powers would correspond with Minister Plenipotentiary. To this they assented,
                     and three days afterwards Mr. Norris, as Minister, and Mr. Young, as Secretary,
                     came over, on foot, and took lodgings at the Armstrong Hotel. I make bold to
                     transcribe the correspondence which took place, in order that the reader may
                     judge for himself how willing we were to grant anything consistent with,
                     national honor, for this is a quality equal to, or more important than, private
                     virtue, and how unreasonable they were in all their demands.</p>

                     in answer to the communication from the Secretary of State of the 8th inst.,
                     begs leave to make the following demands: 1st. That the government abandon its
                     position which every day is throwing up reefs and bars to wreck the unskillful
                     mariner." 2d. That it govern by justice and not by law, which breeds a shoal of
                     pirates, called lawyers, and a hungry fry of sharks called office-holders,
                     which consume the stores of industry without rendering the value of a herring;
                     and 3d. That it return to that point of the compass whence it has shifted, and
                     there be guided by the North Star of Nature.</p>
                  <p>The undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to the Secretary of

                  <p>The undersigned, Secretary of the United Districts of Nede, is surprised at the
                     contents of his Excellenza's note of the 10th inst., and begs leave to say that
                     not one of his demands will be executed. If his government can listen to no
                     more reasonable terms, it is but proper to say that further communication will
                     be unnecessary. For one power to demand of another the surrender of its
                     political existence, is a piece of impudence equalled only by Frederick the
                     Great, and is sufficient provocation to arouse immediate hostilities to be
                     waged by the utmost exertion of the power of the Republic, but the undersigned
                     is willing to suppose that this could only have arisen in ignorance of mutual
                     rights and privileges, or from some other cause unknown to the undersigned.</p>
                  <p>The President has directed the undersigned to say that there is a desire on the
                     part of the Nedean Government to make such concessions as shall be
                     advantageous, and yet not injurious to either power, in view that the
                     Communitists will not see themselves outdone in generosity and in disinterested
                     characteristics. Indeed it is but just, if the Nedean Government resign any of
                     its rights that the Communitists resign corresponding ones also. Hoping that
                     the peace of both powers may be preserved to the end, that they may enjoy the
                     benign smiles of Providence,</p>

                  <p>The undersigned, Minister from the only safe harbor of Nede, in reply to Mr.
                     Squire's note of the 11th inst., thinks it impossible to work the diplomatic
                     ship against such a head wind as his Excellenza has raised. He would notice the
                     impropriety of using the term government in connection with his situation, for
                     he acknowledges no government, and hopes he never may acknowledge one. He would
                     remark also that the phrase "Powers" is, if not absurd, ridiculous, which, with
                     the other objectional expressions, he hopes may be avoided.</p>
                  <p>As regards the amicable arrangement of existing difficulties, the undersigned

                     the 11th inst. will be entertained.</p>

                  <p>The undersigned, Secretary of the United Districts of Nede, in reply to his
                     note of the 12th inst., thinks it inconsistent for one who styles himself
                     Minister Plenipotentiary to deny that he does not represent some power or
                     nation. Nevertheless the slightest wish of his Excellenza shall be gratified.
                     The undersigned has communicated to the President and his Cabinet the
                     willingness of Mr. Norris's people to surrender certain unstipulated rights if
                     the Nedean Government resign the exercise of corresponding immunities, and
                     Accordingly the following proposition is submitted for his Excellenza's
                     contemplation:—</p>
                  <p>If the Community orators, and prints, diurnal, periodical, miscellaneous, and
                     mixed, will cease in their endeavors to overthrow the Nedean Constitution and
                     Government, the officers of said Government will bind ourselves by the most
                     solemn and awful oaths to refrain from intermeddling or interfering with any
                     course, policy, or measures which the Communitists may think proper, just, or
                     beneficial to adopt or establish; but with the express proviso that no member
                     or members of said Community do speak or write anything against the Government
                     of the United Districts of Nede, either by means of pen, paper, stick, leaf,
                     finger, bark, sand, soil, stone, wood, hieroglyphic, or eipher; in Greek,
                     Latin, Hebrew, Syriac, Sanscrit, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, German,
                     Icelandic, Danish, Arabic, Russ, Celtic, Chaldee, Persian, Hindostan, Chinese,
                     Cherokee, or any other language, and by any means whatsoever. It is hoped that
                     concessions which are thus both liberal and easy of execution will meet with
                     his Excellenza's approbation.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary of State would avail himself of this opportunity to agree with
                     Mr. Norris as regards his ideas of distinguished consideration.</p>

                     him with hot shot, till he hauls down his colors.</p>

                  <p>The undersigned Secretary of State of the United District of Nede, is clearly
                     of the opinion, that the pending negotiations should be broken off. When a
                     minister's instructions are such as to preclude his acting with any latitude,
                     his situation must be embarrassing, and in his Excellenza's case, it must be
                     doubly so, since he is forced to act contrary to his inclinations. It is to be

                     government not only mild, but peaceable, not only peaceable, but neutral; and
                     contribute much towards bringing about those measures which aught, if possible,

                  <p>This negotiation was one of the last official acts of the government. Congress,
                     however, endeavored to conciliate them, by passing a Liquor Law to the effect,
                     that all manufacturers of ardent spirits, or those even, who supplied the
                     distillery with materials for distilling, should be held responsible for all
                     losses of time, riot, disturbances; even for crime, which should arise either
                     directly or indirectly, through the use of liquors,—on the principle that every
                     business ought to support itself;—and though this at once put a stop to the
                     manufacture of the article, still it was too late. They cried, that if the law
                     had been seasonable it had been well; and they looked upon us, as the people
                     lately looked upon a certain European King, who was willing to concede any
                     thing, when he was ready to flee, if he might retain his crown, and as I am
                     afraid, they will look upon another king before long, that is, his successor,
                     who has seated himself in his place by the mere force of impudence. Congress
                     soon after adjourned with the country in debt, which the Star failed not to
                     represent as a national blessing. At the same time, the Seditious redoubled
                     their efforts. They held two or three meetings every day, new orators sprung up
                     among them, and names, no one had heard before, were in every mouth. The Aurora
                     was scattered every where; it poured out torrents of abuse, it exulted at every
                     mistake, magnified every error, acknowledged neither harmony nor dignity in the
                     government, and in short did all that could be expected from malignity and
                     advantage. In less than three months, over two thousand renounced the
                     protection, of the government,—even those on whom I had proposed to rely,
                     deserted me. Those which remained were gentlemen and clerks, who estimated
                     themselves so highly, who dressed so extravagantly, and were so indisposed to
                     serious employment, that they accelerated my ruin. The two thousand, above
                     mentioned, instigated by no good motives, to say the very least, with what
                     bills they had, or could borrow, commenced a, run on the bank. We pretended to
                     count out specie as fast as we could, but pretty soon the alarm spread, when
                     every one who had even a twenty-five-cent note brought it in. At last, after
                     paying out five-cent pieces for three days, and taking our own time to count
                     them, that our friends, if we had any, might borrow back the specie, if
                     possible; we were forced to suspend. Immediately, the bills fell 50 cents on
                     the dollar, and shortly after all notes on the Pacific State Bank, were good
                     for nothing. Then came a time of real distress, a warning for people never to
                     oppress a bank, the safeguard of property, and indirectly, of liberty.</p>
                  <p>Every thing now went to wreck. To be sure there was as much money as ever in
                     the hands of the people, but it was possessed mostly by the Seditious, and its
                     Great "Regulator being destroyed, the little in circulation among those of the
                     government party, increased its value. This forced me to go on the credit
                     system, even for the supply of necessaries for my household. Government, too,
                     adopted this plan, but at last, it was evident that it could never pay its
                     debts, and it became bankrupt. This was a finishing blow, and I abdicated the
                     chair, February 28, 1850.</p>
                  <p>Then the Revolution was completed. Hundreds quit their dwellings every day, and
                     repaired to their former places of abode. Some parts of the island which had
                     been thickly populated, became desolate. I reasoned, entreated, begged, prayed,
                     implored, did every thing but kneel, to induce them to reflect upon their
                     rashness. I was thankful if they even listened, while they went the downward
                     road. At last, I gave up, and thenceforward" refused to speak. I had believed
                     in total depravity, but I had thought it a shallow stream, I had not calculated
                     upon its depth. Hereafter, let no one felicitate himself upon reforming
                     mankind, when they think they are reformed already.</p>
                  <p>By May day, 1850, Mr. Squire and myself were the sole inhabitants of the
                     capital. Frequently, some days passed in which we saw no one but ourselves. We
                     cultivated a small piece of ground in a retired place, and came near dying from
                     having nothing else to do. June 25th, I had a first attack of the equinoctial
                     fever and ague. The natives hearing of this came up, and insisted on our living
                     with them; they said they would treat us as well as they could, and we need
                     never lift our hands to do an hour's work; and this pleased us, though we were
                     by no means of idle habits, but we value our principles, and rather than
                     abandon them, we wished our right hands might—rash expressions ought to be
                     omitted. From this I went into a melancholy state, and I used to sit for hours
                     in the empty speaker's chair in the House. At last the natives came in a body,
                     and carried me to my old quarters, and providing me with every thing needful, I
                     recovered, and was as acute and as serene as ever.</p>
                  <p>Seeing that the natives were quite friendly, I requested them to build us a
                     vessel, that we might return to our country. Complying with this, they placed
                     themselves under my direction, and in a few months had a schooner ready for
                     sea. This they were enabled to do so soon, because, as I have elsewhere stated,
                     I had caused ship lumber to be prepared, and as it had lain several years
                     protected from the weather, every thing was ready, and only required to be put
                     together. I hastened our departure. The natives prepared all manner of fruits,
                     and provisions for our voyage, and with great cheerfulness brought aboard the
                     money which had lain around in different places, and in addition, shipped about
                     thirty-six tons of bar iron-as ballast, which we afterwards turned to good
                     account.</p>
                  <p>Dec. 17. Being the last Sunday we spent on the Island. I was constrained to
                     attend church, since the body to which I belonged had, for a short time, and I
                     suppose for the sake of peace, become incorporated into the Native Church, the
                     Christ Kindles, or Christ Lovers, a name first made use of by Mr. Young. I must
                     confess it was very pleasant to hear the bell ring at 9 o'clock, and to see
                     every one about me dressed in clean garments, and then at the ringing at
                     half-past 10, to behold the greater part of the community proceed to the
                     church, which we ourselves had erected in the grove. Those who had wives walked
                     by their sides, and carried their infants, if they had any, though of these, as
                     yet, there were only about sixty on the whole island, and then after these,
                     those who remained unsexed, being some ninety in number, and paired agreeably
                     to their ages and tastes, and by the time the bell ceased tolling, to seat
                     themselves, friend by the side of friend; and what one might suppose male, by
                     the side of female, married and unmarried, attraction being the only thing
                     considered, and shame and impropriety not being taken into account. Mr. Squire
                     and myself followed last, and not having been to church for some months. I
                     walked along the wet gravel path, much more reconciled to the natives than I
                     had been for several years. When I entered, the minister would have me take a
                     seat by his side, but I declined, and was content to sit below the pulpit in
                     view of the whole congregation, a remarkable sight, and well worth describing;
                     but I cannot permit myself to extend my narrative. Again I was pleased, and
                     felt how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity, when, after a
                     prayer which Was rather short, a hymn was read out of Watts himself, and
                     immediately after sung, by the whole congregation, led by home competent
                     singers, to the tune of Dundee. During the rest of the, services of the day,
                     they sang China. Windham and Old Hundred, and in a manner which exactly
                     accorded with my motions of sacred music; nor am I ashamed to confess this,
                     notwithstanding the genial rage for the improvements of Lowell Mason, and other
                     folderols in our home churches. Neither did they make use of fiddle, flute, or
                     tambourine, but simply sang with the voice nature gave them—bringing tears into
                     my eyes, even now as I think of it, considering how we are overrun with trash
                     at home, being for the reason, as I suppose, that having departed from the true
                     standard, we know not where to stop in our innovations.</p>
                  <p>But now, having said thus much in favor of their worship. I must stop; for many
                     of the sentiments which were dispersed through the sermon, made me feel as
                     though I were in an improper place or as if I sat on a bed of nettles; as any
                     one else who loves the truth would have imagined, had he listened to such an
                     impious blasphemy as follows:—</p>
                  <pb n="72-73 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7230-00000038"/>
                  <p>Moses was undoubtedly a holy man, and a wise law-giver, such as the age of the
                     world in which he lived required; but the present times, or periods of greater
                     refinement, greater knowledge, and more comprehensive ideas of benevolence,
                     demand a spirit different from what he sometimes manifested. David excelled in
                     strains of adoration, and humble and heartfelt thanksgiving, and it may be
                     doubted whether it is possible for the human heart to feel its dependence upon
                     the Lord in a degree equally natural and affecting; nevertheless it grieved the
                     preacher to say, that he did and said many things unworthy of imitation. The
                     Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others, though breathing strains of the highest
                     moral character, and approaching, as one might say, to a contact with divinity
                     himself, yet do present in common many traits of vindictiveness and revenge
                     quite opposed to the spirit of a true and undefiled religion; and he added,
                     that although some of his hearers were disposed to be blind in a very strange
                     manner as regards these things, he thought such blindness rather opposed than
                     favorable to a high development of real piety. However, when he came to speak
                     of Christ, he represented him as a perfect character, and as one in whom these
                     objectionable features entirely disappear; neither gall nor bitterness were
                     found in him; his love was strongest when the object of it was weakest; and he
                     was worthy of all adoration, and of the highest praise, so long as the human
                     tongue could speak. Such a character must necessarily be admired by all
                     intelligent creatures in every part of the universe, for he was truth indeed.
                     Notwithstanding this high eulogium, I suspected it was given him at the expense
                     of his divinity, for the remark was incidentally made, that his authority
                     rested more upon his life of meekness, self-denial, and love for the human
                     race, than upon his miracles; for it is possible for spirits of evil to do
                     miraculous things, but it is not they who proclaim liberty to the captive, or
                     who cry Blessed are the pure in heart.</p>
                  <p>The devil will find such churches wherever they are; and I doubt not that by
                     this time the Christ Kindles have fallen upon one another.</p>
                  <p>Dec. 19.—Every thing being ready, we put to sea; Mr. Griffith, Young, and
                     Norris stood on the shore, and after all that had passed, I saw tears drop out
                     of their eyes. Their wives were by their sides, and Mr. Young held a baby in
                     his arms; and from the appearance of things, I judged that Griffith and Norris
                     would soon have their own arms filled also.</p>
                  <p>Such of the natives as remained unsexed, followed us two or three miles,
                     swimming and running around the schooner. At last we bade them adieu, and
                     turning to the island, as I stood with the rudder in my hand, I watched it till
                     it finally sank into the sea. Were I disposed to enlarge, I might give an
                     entertaining account of our passage to the South American coast, in which I
                     should speak highly of Mr. Squire, both as a skillful mariner, and as a
                     cheerful companion; but as all that I can now add to these pages will be
                     accounted an appendage, I hasten to a conclusion.</p>
                  <p>Jan. 25,1851.—We arrived at the port of Callao, and the same day reported
                     ourselves to the authorities. We visited the city of Lima, seven miles distant,
                     and called upon several American and English merchants, who were kind enough to
                     give us bills on London and New York for our specie. We sold our schooner and
                     the iron in the hold as she lay, and took passage in the Matilda, Captain Heavy
                     sides, bound for London. April 25th, we touched at Rio Janeiro, where we
                     transferred ourselves to the Florida, Captain Nickerson, ready to sail for
                     Philadelphia. We had a boisterous passage, but at last came in sight of our
                     native land, Cape May, June 3d. As the winds were contrary, we got aboard a
                     light steamer, and on the evening of the same day, took tea at the United
                     States Hotel, happy at having escaped, a thousand dangers both by sea and land.
                     Immediately afterwards we entered the night train of cars for New York, and
                     upon our arrival at this place, stepped into a car going eastward, and the next
                     day, June 5, I entered my own door. I saw at a glance as my wife came forward,
                     that every thing was well, but the recollection of the tender emotions which
                     agitated our bosoms, compels me to bid the reader an affectionate farewell.</p>

            <p>THIS volume comprises the observations made during Mr. GREELEY'S recent European
               tour, on Society, Manners, and Customs, Arts, Literature, Agriculture, Foreign
               Politics, and a great variety of other attractive and exciting topics.</p>
            <p>It has copious notices of the Great Exhibition, or World's Fair in London; complete
               descriptions of the Cultivation of the Soil in different countries; brilliant
               criticisms of the Works of Art in the Great European Capitals; and graphic Sketches
               of Public and Domestic Life in London, Paris, Rome, &amp;c., written in the frank,
               straightforward, piquant style, for which Mr. GREELEY is widely celebrated.</p>
            <p>A more authentic, instructive, and amusing Book of Travels has probably never been
               issued from the American press. The vast amount of information which it contains is
               presented in such a lively and off hand manner, that the perusal of the volume
               becomes as interesting as a novel.</p>
            <p>Who ever would obtain a fresh, daguerreotype view of the present state of England,
               should not fail to make himself acquainted with its contents. Even the discussion of
               the dryest topics, which it sometimes takes up, is enlivened with such frequent
               flashes of humor, and pervaded with such genial and sparkling vivacity, that no one
               who commences the volume can lay it down without finishing its perusal.</p>
            <p>We confidently anticipate a very extensive circulation for this work throughout the

               <p>We have perused Horace Greeley's "Glances at Europe"—the best series of Letters
                  that have been written in many years.—<title>Albany Evening Journal.</title>
               </p>
               <p>The author has presented a vivid daguerreotype of the districts traversed, and of
                  the incidents which came under his observation, and has expressed his opinions in
                  regard to national characteristics and aptitudes with a boldness, originality and
                  correctness, which show that they were not based upon a few days' personal
                  observation, but founded in an intimate knowledge of the social and political
                  history of those nations.—<title>Washington Union.</title>

               <p>They are spirited, entertaining, characteristic and

                     spirit.—<title>Boston Post.</title>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Greeley's Letters are not deficient in life, and spirit, and interest. His
                  remarks on the Great Exhibition particularly valuable; for being one of the
                  judges, his opportunities for seeing and knowing were extra good.—<title>Boston

               </p>
               <p>We can only say that it is written in the peculiarly racy and interesting style of
                  the author, who appears to have improved the opportunities which his position and
                  the force of circumstances have afforded him for seeing all that could profitably
                  be seen during his belief sojourn in Europe.—<title>Cincinnali Gazette.</title>
               </p>
               <p>We regard Mr. Greeley's book as entitled to a high rank among the best books
                  illustrative of the present condition of the European people; and we purpose, at
                  an early period, to by before our readers some parts of his sketches hoping they
                  will be tempted to became owners of the whole.—<title>Buffalo Daily

               <p>Mr. Greeley's constant comparison of what he observed with the state of things in
                  his own country, which implies more general intelligence than most travellers
