Yet will you not know, any more than the Custo~m.&#xD;

makes anonymous restoration of defrauded dues, whose&#xD;
conscience it is from which this poor acknowledgment&#xD;
is drawn. It is, you may be sure, a very sincere one,&#xD;
couphd with the single misgiving that~my little "Com-&#xD;
edy" will scarcely prove half so agreeable to you, a~&#xD;
yours has ever been to me. Nevertheless, you excellent&#xD;

and look not the gift-horse too narrowlyly in the mouth..&#xD;

the mirth has fairly subsided from the muscles of my&#xD;

matters that affect the humorous, and hardly a proper&#xD;

indeed, I propose nothing of the kind. The title chosen&#xD;

PROEM4&#xD;
WE were nine of us, packed' snugly enough in a elo~e&#xD;
stage, and on the high road from Madison, in Georgia,&#xD;
to Montgomery, in Alabama. The night was d~rk, and&#xD;
the rain falling. The roads were bad, "and the ddver'&#xD;
aS d~unk as the least reasonable desperate could desire&#xD;
under the circumstances. Everybody has an idea, more&#xD;
or less vivid, of a dark and rainy night; most persons&#xD;
can form a notion ~of the drunken driver of a stage..&#xD;
coach-a swearing, foul-mouthed fellow, pestilent, full&#xD;
of conceit and insolence, fully conscious of his power&#xD;
over his nags and passengers, and with jwst ~easui&#xD;
enough left to desire to use his poker so as to keep all&#xD;
parties appreh~nsive--his horses of the whip, and hi~&#xD;
passengers of an upset. But if you know nothing of &amp;amp;&#xD;
Georgia 'road in bad weather, at the time I speak of,&#xD;
you can form but an imperfect ides of the nervous&#xD;
irritability of the nine within our vehicle that night, as,&#xD;
trundling through bog a~d through brier, over stump&#xD;
and stone, up hill and down dale-as desperate a chase,&#xD;
seemingly, as that~of the Wild' Horseman of Burger-we&#xD;
mo~ently cursed our fates, that had given us ever to such&#xD;
a keeping and such a progress. We could not~ee each&#xD;
other's faces, but w~ could hear each otherss words,. and&#xD;
feel each other's hips and elbows.&#xD;

upon the nearest solid object.&#xD;
"She~rights !" said one.&#xD;
"Eh! does she? I'm glad of it," was the reply of&#xD;

my head to get back fairly upon its shoulders."&#xD;
There was a release of the victim and an apology.&#xD;
Xndeed, there were several apologies necessary. We&#xD;
were niornently .n~akirig free with the arms and sides&#xD;
and shoulders of our neighbors, under the impulse of a&#xD;
sudden di'~ad' of the upset, which it is wonderful how&#xD;
we continued to escape. 'We compared notes.. Our&#xD;
apprehensions were general. The ~'driver ~as appealed&#xD;
to; we ~howled to him through the pipes of a Down&#xD;
Easter, entreating him to drive more gently.&#xD;
"Gently, ~ 'hanged !" was 'the horrid answer, fol-&#xD;
lowed up by a tremendous smack' of the whip. Away&#xD;
went the horses at a wil4er rate than ever, and we were&#xD;
left, without~ ~hope or consolation, to all sorts ofimagin-&#xD;

and no esca~p~." We could only brood over our terrors,&#xD;

Our. very.efforts to conceal our fears sufficiently betrayed&#xD;
them to all who were cool enough ~o imake the discovery.&#xD;
But seIf~esteem was reassured by the general sympathy&#xD;
of most of our comrades. There were variou~ emotionS&#xD;
among us-the modified exponents of the one in com-&#xD;
mon-modified according to age, temper, and education.&#xD;
Our various modes of showing them made us altogether.&#xD;
a proper group for dramaticcontrasts. We could have&#xD;
played our parts, no doubt very decently, upon any&#xD;
stage but that. We could have strutted. manfully, and&#xD;
shown good legs, but scarcely upon board~ which&#xD;
creaked and cracked as with convulsions of thefr own,&#xD;
as we hurried headlong up the heights,. or rushed whiz-&#xD;
zing'~ through the mire. And 'we should have had&#xD;
variety enough. fot character. Our nine passengers&#xD;
might have represented as many States. Never was&#xD;
there a more grateful diversity. There was a school..~&#xD;
master from Massachusetts. Whither, indeed, does not&#xD;
Massachusetts send her schoolmasters, teaching the&#xD;
same eternal notion of. the saintly mission of the Puri~&#xD;
tans, and the perfect virtues, of their descendants? The&#xD;
genius of that State was certainly born a pedagogue,&#xD;
with birch in one hand and horn-book' in 'the .other ~&#xD;
There was a machinist from Maine, a queer, quaint,&#xD;
shrewd, knowing, self4&amp;amp;ught Yankee, who had lost' half&#xD;
his fingers in experimenting with his own machines, and&#xD;
who was brim-full of a new. discovery which is~to secure&#xD;
us that "phuloso~her's stone" of the nineteenth century&#xD;
.-perpettial motion! The principle of our machinist&#xD;
seemed to lie in the amiable good-nature with which&#xD;

his political idolatry. We had a Pennsylvanian, who:&#xD;
seemed to reel as if all the sham~' of State repudiation&#xD;

who' appeared to deplore nothing so much as that he~&#xD;
could not claim more than the merit of a single vote in&#xD;
the glorious business of defying the foreign creditor of&#xD;
the union Bank. The encounter between these two&#xD;
parties-the humbled and responding tone of the one,&#xD;
contrasted with the exulting and triiu~iphant convictions&#xD;
of successful right in the othei~'-furnished picture of&#xD;
opposites that wa~ perfectly delightful. The leading&#xD;
idea which troubled our Virginian was, that Tykr was&#xD;
t6' be the last of the Presidents which' his State would&#xD;
furnish to the Union; while the South Carolinian, with&#xD;
whom he seemed intimate, consoled him with the assur-&#xD;
'ance that his regrets were idle, as the Union would not&#xD;
much longer need a President. He indulged in the&#xD;
favorite idea that a dissolution was. at hand. "The&#xD;
Union," said he, answeredd the-purposes of the time.&#xD;
It has survived its uses." Our Georgian,' on the con.-&#xD;
tiary, was for the extension of 'the confederacy by the&#xD;
in~corpo'ration ~of as many new States south of us as we&#xD;

his way to Texas, provided with his rifle only, in. order&#xD;
to 'be in the way to help in the' matter of annexation.&#xD;
Then we had a North Carolinian, a lank-sided fellow~&#xD;
from Tar Rivrn'~ Who slept nearly all the way, spite of&#xD;
toss. and. tumble, talked only (and constantly) in his&#xD;
&#xD;
~sleep, and then ~hie~y upon the Wotible of looking aft~r&#xD;
his own affairs. Ou~r n.intk man ~was a broth of a hey&#xD;

How could, I complain &amp;amp;fter the, last suggestions-&#xD;
cbmpl'ain of a man who felt his own misfortune with&#xD;
such a proper conscience! The schoolmaster had some-&#xD;
thing to say. His tone ~was exceedingly indignant, but&#xD;

My amiable recognition of his bulk seemed to have won&#xD;
hi~ affe~tioas, if, indeed, his great size and my unavoid-&#xD;
able neighborhood did not suff ciently account' for them.&#xD;
His great fat haunches nestled most lovingly against&#xD;
me, threatening 'to overlap me entirely, while his huge&#xD;
arm encircled~ my neck with an embrace which would&#xD;
hava honored that of the Irish Giant. It was 'fortunate&#xD;
that we had no such sulky scoundrels within the stage&#xD;

"Pshaw'!" exclaimed the Georgian. "Go ahead,&#xD;

rw reason yoiv should hold me up to make me say so."&#xD;

see; though, n~ay-1o, a little too quick on trigger."&#xD;
~Agripe. of'~ the extended fists followed in the dark,&#xD;
and the Tennesseean proceeded.&#xD;
"The sarcumstance that I am going to tell you tuck&#xD;
place in one of the western counties of Georgia, not&#xD;
many years ago, and there's many a person living who&#xD;
can jest now lay their fingers on the very parties. I've&#xD;
seen some of them myself0 You must take the thing&#xD;
for its truth more than for its pleasantry; for, about&#xD;
the one I can answer, and about the other I'm as good&#xD;
as nobody to have an opinion. I'm not the man to&#xD;
make folks laugh, unless it's at me, and then ItI'm jest&#xD;
as apt to make them cry~, too; so you see I'm as good&#xD;
as comedy and tragedy both, to some. But, as I con~&#xD;

my mouth; and ef so be-"&#xD;
We silenced these preliminaries viva voce; and, thus&#xD;
arrested, our Tennesseean left off his faces and began.&#xD;
In a plain and direct manner, 'he related the occurrences&#xD;
~hioh will be fot~nd in the following chapters. He was&#xD;
n4 hutnorist, though he ~uffered' us all to see in what&#xD;
the humorous susceptibilities of his story lay. It was&#xD;
the Qddity of~ the circumstances, rather than their hu-&#xD;
morr that held out the 'attraction ~for me; and Ii cc~uld&#xD;
readily perceive how, without confounding comedy with&#xD;
the merely humorous and ludicrous, the materials' thus&#xD;
&#xD;
xxii&#xD;
&#xD;
thrown together might, by a dext6rous hand, be con-&#xD;
verted to the purposes of the stage. The story illus~&#xD;
rates curiously the variety and freedom of character&#xD;
which we find' everywhere in our forest country, where&#xD;
no long-established usages subdue the fresh and eager&#xD;
impulses of originality, and where, as if in very mockery&#xD;
of the conventionalities of city life, the stranAest eccen-&#xD;
tricities of mood and feeling dispfry themselves in a&#xD;

A GEORGIA BREAKFAST.&#xD;
L1~T us start fairly, and not -on ~n empty stomach.&#xD;
Reader, we begin with a Georgia breakfast.'. We ~ar~&#xD;

which, surVeyed from the proper point bf view, there is&#xD;
nothing barren. You a~e not to suppose thesettlement '~&#xD;

that of the neighboring settlements among which it&#xD;
harbors. 'The spot, though undistinguished by sur-&#xD;
prising scenery,' is a very lovely one, and not unfre-&#xD;
quent in the middle country of the Atlantic Southern&#xD;
states. It presents a pleasing prospect under a single&#xD;
glance of the eye, of smooth lawn, and gentle acclivity,&#xD;
and lofty forest growth. A streamlett, or Iiranch,~as it&#xD;
is here called, winds .along~ murmuring as it goes, at the&#xD;
foot of~ ~ gentle eminence which is crowned with a luxu-&#xD;
riant wealth of pine and cedar. Looking up from this&#xD;
'spot while your steed, drinks, you behold, perched on&#xD;
'another gentle swell of ground, as snug~and handsome&#xD;
an edifice as our forest country usually affords; none&#xD;
of your overgrown ambitious establishments, but a trim&#xD;
tidy dwelling, consisting of a single story of wood upon&#xD;
a brick basement, and surrounded on three sides by a&#xD;
most glorious piazza. The lawn slopes away, for several&#xD;
hundred yards, an. even and very gradual descent even&#xD;
to 'the road; a broad tract, well sprinkled with noble&#xD;
trees, oaks, oranges, and cedars; with here and there a&#xD;
clump of towering pines, under which' steeds are grazing,&#xD;
in. whoSe slender and symmetrical forms, clean legs, and&#xD;
glossy skins, you may discern instant signs of those&#xD;
superior foreign breeds which the Southern, planter so&#xD;
much' affects. The house; neatly painted white, with&#xD;
green blinds and shutters, is kept in admirable trini; and,&#xD;
from the. agreeable arrangement' of trees and' shrubbery,&#xD;
it would.seem that the place had been laid out and was&#xD;
tenan.ted by those who brought good taste and, a be-&#xD;
coming sense of the beautiful to the task. There was&#xD;
nogreat exercise of.. art, itv is true. That is nQt pre-&#xD;
tended. 'But nature was not suffered to have her own&#xD;
way. entirely, was not suffered to overrun the face of'&#xD;
the land with her luxuriance;, nor was man so savage&#xD;
as to strip her utterly of all h~r graooful deoorations-&#xD;
a crime which we are too frequently called upon~ to de-&#xD;
plore and to denounce, when we contemplate the habita-&#xD;
tions even of the wealthy among our people, particularly&#xD;
in the south, despoiled, by barbarity, of all their shade-&#xD;

trees, and denuded of all the grace and softness whieli&#xD;
these necessarily confer upon the landscape. Here, the&#xD;
glance seemed, to rest satisfied with' what it beheld,. and.&#xD;
to want for nothing9 There might be bigger h6iises,&#xD;
and loftier, structures, of more ~mbitiou~ design and&#xD;
more commanding proportion~; but' this was certainly&#xD;
very neat, and.very much in its place. Its ~white '&amp;amp;ut~&#xD;
lines caught your eye, glinting through openings of' the'&#xD;
forest, approaching by the road on either hand; for&#xD;
some distance' before you drew nigh, and with' ~ucii ui:&#xD;
air' of peace and sweetness,' that you were' insensib'1y~&#xD;
prepared to 'regard its inmates as very good and welh&#xD;
bred people. :Nor are we wrong in these conjectures.,&#xD;
But of this hereafter. At this moment, you ina1y see&#xD;
avery splendid iron-gray charger, saddled, an&amp;amp; fastened~&#xD;
in the shade, some twenty steps from the dwelling.' 'Lift"&#xD;
your eye to the piazza, and you behold the owner. 'A"&#xD;
finer-looking fellow lives not in the country. Tall,' ~elV'&#xD;
made, and muscular, he treads the piazza like a prince.&#xD;
The freedom of carriage which belongs to the gentlein~n&#xD;
in our forest country is inimitable, is not to be acquired&#xD;
by art, and 'is due to' the fact that 'they suffer from no&#xD;
laborious occupation, undergo no drudgei~y, 'and ~are~&#xD;
subject to no confinement, which, in childhood, conti~aet'&#xD;
the shoulders into a stoop, depress the spirits, 'enf~eble&#xD;
the energies, and wofully impair the 'freedom and 'ele-&#xD;
gance of' the deportment. 'Constant exercise on foot&#xD;
and horseback, the fox hunt and the chase; these~ with&#xD;
other sylvan sports, do wonders for the pk~isique, the&#xD;
grace and the bearing of the country gentleman of the&#xD;
South. The ~ers6n before us is one of'the noblest spe-'&#xD;
cimens of his class. A frank and' handsome countenance,&#xD;
with a skin clear and inclining to the 'fl~rid'~ a' brig'lit,&#xD;
martial blue eye; a full' chin; thick, massive locks~ ~of&#xD;
dark brown hair, and lips 'that express a rare ~etness,'&#xD;
and only do not smile, sufficiently distinguish his~ peeu.&#xD;
liarities of face. His dress is, simple, after an ordinary&#xD;
fashion of the country, but is surprisingly neat and be-&#xD;
coming. A loose blouse, rather more after the Choctaw&#xD;

of his shape. His trousers are not so~ loose as to con~&#xD;
ceal the fine muscular developments of his lower limbs;&#xD;
nor: does his loose negligee neckcloth, simply folded&#xD;
about the neck, prevent the display of a column which&#xD;
admirably sustains the intellectual and massive head&#xD;
which crowns it, and which we now behold uncovered.&#xD;
Booted and 'spurred, he appears ready-for a journey,&#xD;
walks the piazza with something of' impatience in his&#xD;
manner, and frequently stops to shade his eyes from the&#xD;
glare, as he strains them in exploring the distant high-&#xD;
way.. You see that 'he is~ young, scarcely twenty-two;&#xD;
eager in his impulses, restive under restraint, and better&#xD;
able to endure and struggle with the conflict than to&#xD;
wait for:it~ slow approaches'. Suddenly he starts. He&#xD;
turns to a call from within, and a matron lady appears&#xD;
at ~the entrance of the dwelling, and joins him in the,&#xD;
piazza. He tiu'ns to her with respect and fondness. She&#xD;
is~ his mother; a statelyy dame, with features like his&#xD;
own; -a manner at once easy and dignified'; an eye&#xD;
grave, 'but benevolent; and a voice whose slow, 'subdued&#xD;
accents' possess a rare sweetness not unmingled with&#xD;
command.&#xD;
* "'We need wait for Miles no longer, my son," was&#xD;
the remark of the old lady. "lie surely never meant&#xD;
to come to breakfast. He knows our hours perfectly;&#xD;
and knows, moreover, that 'we old people, who rise with&#xD;
the fowls, do 'not relish any unnecessary delay in the&#xD;
morning meal.".&#xD;
" Well, mother, have it in, though I certainly under~&#xD;
stood John that he would be here to breakfast."&#xD;
"Most probably he did not understand himself."&#xD;

"Ay, indeed! but whose breakfast; his or mine?&#xD;
Did lie say he would come to breakfast with me, or&#xD;
after he had eaten his own ?"&#xD;
"He no say."&#xD;
"Why did I send that fellow !" muttered the youth&#xD;

homespun, with a Aean white apron. The aged lady&#xD;
herself wears an apron, that seems to indicate her own&#xD;
readiness to share in the labors of the household. ' And&#xD;
now for the breakfast. .A Georgia, indeed a Southern&#xD;
breakfast, differs in sundry respects from ours at the&#xD;
North, chiefly, however, in the' matter 'of breadstuffs.&#xD;
In this respect our habits are more simple, particularly&#xD;
in the cities. 'In the South, there is a variety; and&#xD;
these are valuable chiefly in proportion to their warmth.&#xD;
.llominy itself is a breadstuff; a 'dish that our mush~ but&#xD;
poorly represents. -It is seldom eatable out ofa Southern&#xD;
household. Then there are' wafiles, and rice cakes -and&#xD;
fritters, and other things of like description, making&#xD;
a variety at o~nce persuasive to 'the palate and n&amp;amp;t :'hurt~&#xD;
ful to health. These were 'all in 'lavish array at the&#xD;
table of the widow Hammond, for such is the name of&#xD;
the excellent lady to whose 'breakfast board ~we are&#xD;
self..invited. The breadstuffs had their corresponding&#xD;
variety of meats. A dish of broiled partridges; a steak&#xD;
of venison, and a vase of boiled eggs, furnish an a~ple&#xD;
choice for a Spring breakfast, and take from us all&#xD;
motive to look farther. Coffee for her son, 'and tea for&#xD;

i~ suggestive of a pitcher of foaming buttermilk that&#xD;
stands at the extremity. Why look further into the&#xD;
catalogue?&#xD;
For a while the parties ate in silence, or rather they&#xD;
did n6t eat; one of them, at least, seemed to need an&#xD;
appetizer. Ilandall Hammond took several things on&#xD;
his plate at the suggestion of his mother, but he merely&#xD;
tasted of them. The, partridge was sorely gashed at&#xD;
th~first stroke, but the morsel taken from its breast lay&#xD;
upon the fork unswallowed. The youth seemed more&#xD;
disposed to exercise his ingenuity in balancing his spoon&#xD;
upon the. edge of his cup; a feat which, having suc-&#xD;
ceeded in, he abandoned for the more difficult experi-&#xD;
ment of standing the egg upon its point, as if to solve&#xD;
the problem whioh Columbus submitted to the Spanish&#xD;
doctors. The mother watched with some anxiety these&#xD;
movements of her son.&#xD;
"You do not eat, Randall."&#xD;
"No," he said, "I have somehow no appetite;" and&#xD;
he pushed away his plate as he replied9&#xD;
"You have eaten nothing,; shall I send you another&#xD;
cup of~coffee?",&#xD;
"Do so5 mother ;~ I am thirsty, though I cannot eat."&#xD;
The cup was replenished. The, mistress dispatches&#xD;
the servant~girl or~ a mission tJ the kitchen, and then,&#xD;
after a preliminary hem or two, she - addressed her son&#xD;
in accents of considerable gravity, though so, coupled&#xD;
with fondness as to declare the tendexb interest which&#xD;
she had,, in~her subject9&#xD;
"My son, you well know the regret which I feel at&#xD;
your going to this hQrserace."&#xD;
~' But IC must go, mother. ~'&#xD;
"Yes, I i4rlderstand that. You must go, as you l'~ave&#xD;
promised to do so, and I suppose it's quite unreasonable&#xD;
on my part to desire that you should not comply with&#xD;
what is customary among your assocki4es. I can be-&#xD;
lieve, also, that horseracing is a very different thing,&#xD;
nowadays, from what it was twenty years ago in&#xD;
Georgia."&#xD;
&#xD;
"0 yes, indeed; a very different thing !"&#xD;
"I hope so; I believe so! If I 'did not, 'Randall,&#xD;
nothing should persuade me to give my consent to your&#xD;
exposing yourself to its dreadful influences."~&#xD;
"You need fear nothing on ray account,'mQther."&#xD;
"Ah! my son ;-that is being' quite too bold; persons~.&#xD;
who are thus' strong in their own belief are' always in&#xD;
danger. But, I trust, you have heard me too frequently&#xD;
on this subject; I trust you feel how deeply I should&#xD;
suffer, did I, suppose that'you could run a horse, or risk&#xD;
a dollar, in such a practice; to be misled by the per-&#xD;
suasions of others, or your own natural tendenciess"&#xD;
"But, why do you think I have any such tendencies,&#xD;
mother ?"&#xD;
"Why have you spent so large an amount on. these&#xD;
foreign horses ?"&#xD;
"For the sake of stock, mother. I have an eye to&#xD;
the merits and the beauties of the horse. I know his fine&#xD;
points. I love to look upon them. I know no spectacle&#xD;
more beautiful than a group of these beautiful creatures,&#xD;
wheeling and dashing over the lawn; and as a captain of&#xD;
cavalry, I must be well mounted myself.' Beyond this&#xD;
desire, I do not see that I ~have any natural tendencies&#xD;
that should occasion your fears."&#xD;
"These tendencies come from this very passion for&#xD;
horseflesh."&#xD;
"But with me~ mother, it is no passion."&#xD;
"Alas! my son, I know better; all passions begin very&#xD;
modestly. That you have the tendency is enough for,&#xD;
me, and, at the risk of giving you 'pain, I must repeatt&#xD;
what I have said before, that you inherit~ this 'passion&#xD;
from your most unhappy father."&#xD;
"'No more of that, mother, I entreat you."&#xD;
"Nay, iRandall, but there must he more~ of ft.~ It&#xD;
is needful'for your' safety that I should remind you that&#xD;
your father lost his life and fortune both by this hisane&#xD;
and.dangerous. passion. What remains to us of former&#xD;

perament; hi~ hopeful confidence in himself; his eager&#xD;
will; his lavish expenditure, and his passion for horses."&#xD;
"But, dear mother-2'&#xD;
"Restrained only, as I trust, my son, by the constant&#xD;
lessons of. your. mother."&#xD;
"And by the love I bear her."&#xD;
"I believe it, Randall; it is God's blessing that I do&#xD;
believe it; otherwise, this would b~ to me a moment of&#xD;
the dreariest hopelessness of, heart. Promise me, dear&#xD;
son, that y6u will neither run a horse; nor bet upon a&#xD;
horserace."&#xD;
"Promise, mother !"&#xD;
"'Nay, I ask no promise; I will only pray, Randall,&#xD;
that you will never for a moment forget how much the&#xD;
small remiiant' of your mother's life depends upon the&#xD;
heed you give to these lessons of her fears and sorrows.&#xD;
Let me not mourn the fate of an only son, as I must&#xD;
always mourn that of a husband."&#xD;
The youth passed his arms about her, and kissed her&#xD;
tenderly. They had both risen from the table, and they&#xD;
now approached the piazza together.&#xD;
"There is another subject, Randall, about which I&#xD;
wished to speak with you, but my heart is quite too full&#xD;
just now. I must keep it for another time. It relates&#xD;
to this young lady, Miss Foster."&#xD;
The youth colored deeply. The flush~ did not escape&#xD;
the penetrating eyes of' the mother. She did not seem&#xD;
to obserVe it, however, but continued with rare quietness&#xD;
of manner to remark:&#xD;
"They tell me that you are pleased with her."&#xD;
"Who tells you ?"&#xD;
"No matter. Enough, that I hear also that she is a&#xD;
maiden of singular levities, of bold, masculine~ habits."&#xD;
"0 mother! who could have told you this? What a&#xD;
scandalous story!"&#xD;
"What! has she not some singular habits ?"&#xD;
"Some slight eccentricities, perhaps; something in.&#xD;
thought' and manner more free and confident than is&#xD;

common to the uneducated girls of the country', and.&#xD;
which they accordingly censure-but-"&#xD;
"Well, another time for this, my son. There oomes&#xD;
Henderson"&#xD;
The youth was not unwilling to waive the subject.'&#xD;
His eyes were eagerly fixed upon the highway,' where a&#xD;
horseman now came in sight.&#xD;
"Ay, there he is at last, riding like the high~sh6riff,&#xD;
as who but he! Should he want breakfast, now, mo-&#xD;
ther ?"&#xD;
"He can have it in a moment; but, unless I. am&#xD;
greatly mistaken, he has considered his wants of that&#xD;
sort some time ago."&#xD;
A few moments sufficed to determine the doubt.&#xD;
The new-com~r cantered rapidly down the road, and&#xD;
was soon within the inclosure.&#xD;
"Well, Randall, are you ready ?" he cried, as he&#xD;
alighted from his horse. The bridle was thrown to 3&#xD;
servant, and Henderson ascended to the piazza, where&#xD;
he shook hands with mother and son.&#xD;
"Ready," said Hammond, "and have been this hour.&#xD;
What has kept you? Why did you' not come to break~&#xD;
fast?"&#xD;
"For' the best of reasons. I overslept myself."&#xD;
"'Then you have breakfasted, Henderson ?" asked the&#xD;
old lady.&#xD;
"0 yes, ma'am. I wouldn't keep you waiting;&#xD;
though I sent word by John that 'I would take coffee&#xD;
with you."&#xD;
"And a pretty tale he made of it. We waited for&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"I'm sorry-" he began to apologize, but the old&#xD;
lady silenced him gracefully, and then took her de~&#xD;
parture, leaving the young men together.&#xD;
"So, you overslept yourself, Miles ?" was the remark&#xD;
of Hammond. "Something singular for you. Where&#xD;
was you last night ?"&#xD;

suspicion directly to the eye of the other. The answer&#xD;
was somewhat hesitatingly delivered.&#xD;
"Where was I'? Oh! at Mrs. Foster's."&#xD;
"Ah 1" was the significant exclamation of Hammond,&#xD;
and a pause ensued between the parties. The tone with&#xD;
whi~h the exclamation was uttered was subdued, the&#xD;
word seemed to escape the lips of the speaker involun-&#xD;
tarily, and a keen eye might have detected a slight&#xD;
contraction of the muscles of his brow.~' But this passed&#xD;
away in a single moment, and putting his arm within&#xD;
that of his guest, with a glance behind him to the&#xD;
breakfast-room, Randall Hammond led his companion&#xD;
down, the steps, and they walked away in silence to some&#xD;
distance in the park.&#xD;

CHAPTER IT.&#xD;
THE FRIENDS.&#xD;
THE new-corner, whom we are already taught to know&#xD;
as Miles Henderson, was tall of size' and graceful of per-&#xD;
son. In these respects, he resembled hi~ companion;&#xD;
though it needed no second glance of the spectator to&#xD;
discover the superiority, in all thtit regards bearing and&#xD;
general manner, in the person and carriage of the latter.&#xD;
Henderson was a fine, sprightly, and rather sensible&#xD;
fellow, but scarcely so courtly, so well-bred, and welL.&#xD;
looking as Randall Hammond. Still, there were those&#xD;
by whom the former was preferred. 'He was more frank&#xD;
and less commanding, as a character; more' accessible,&#xD;
and accordingly more agreeable to the many, than the&#xD;
man of superior will and. general endowments. It does&#xD;
not need, however, that we should strike~ the balance,&#xD;
just at this time, between them. Such proceeding will&#xD;
serve liereafter. Enough for us, that the two are most&#xD;
excellent friends; true, whole-souled, and confiding;&#xD;
with neither doubt nor distrust of any' kind between&#xD;
them; ready to share their resources,' ~ind to peril life,&#xD;
if need be, in behalf of each other.~ And such had&#xD;
been their tenns of relationship from boyhood. They&#xD;
had few other associates to divide their sympathies or&#xD;
provoke jealousies between them. 'Both of them were&#xD;
the on&#xD;
were' e~ us widowed mothers; and both of them&#xD;
~i respect to the wishes of their&#xD;
parents. They were not absolutely faultless, but 'very&#xD;
good fellows, as the ~world goes; the one being supposed&#xD;
to have a very decided will of his own; the' other of&#xD;
having a tendency to good-fellowship of every kind,&#xD;
without losing his equilibrium, in the license which good-&#xD;

&#xD;
fellowship among young men is supposed to engender.&#xD;
We may state, at the beginning, that, on the occasion&#xD;
of their present meeting,~ there was something more of&#xD;
shyness and reserve in their mutual hearing, cordial and&#xD;
frank as 'it really appeared, than had ever distinguished&#xD;
it before. The secret of this, of which each was duly&#xD;
conscious, will be shown as we proceed. They had got&#xD;
to some distance from the dwelling, when, somewhat&#xD;
abruptly, Randall resumed the conversation with an&#xD;
inquiry.&#xD;
"So you dined at Mrs. Foster's yesterday, Miles ?"&#xD;
"No. I got there in the afternoon. I went down&#xD;
to the village to see Ferguson~about that land business,&#xD;
and took the good lady in my way home."&#xD;
"'By going four miles out of the way," said the other,&#xD;
drily.&#xD;
"You're right, ~andall," answered the other frankly,&#xD;
while a slight flush tinged the cheek of the speaker.&#xD;
"You're 'right; but I reckon it's only what you'd have&#xD;
done yourself."&#xD;
To this nothing was answered. A moment's pause&#xD;
ensued, when Hammond resumed.&#xD;
"Was that foolish fellow, Barry, there ?"&#xD;
"No! not then; but I gathered that he had been,&#xD;
during the morning, from something that passed between&#xD;
Geraldine and her mother-"&#xD;
"Ah! What?"&#xD;
"Why, as far as I could guess, Geraldine had been&#xD;
rather sharp upon him, in some of her answers; and&#xD;
her mother was' quite displeased in consequence. She&#xD;
gave Geraldine a lecture as long as one of Brother&#xD;
Peterkin's, particularly when his dinner has been a good&#xD;
and comforting one; a~id Geraldine-&#xD;
"Mindc~d it quite as little as my roan horse does the&#xD;
snafile. But how often, Miles, you name her in the&#xD;
space of a sentence!"'&#xD;
"Name her! How often! Who ?" ~The response&#xD;
was stammeringly made.&#xD;
"Who, but Geraldine Foster? In a single half sen-&#xD;

tence, I think, you contrived to bring in her name at&#xD;
least half a dozen times."&#xD;
"Nay, Randall, you're joking. But once,~ 'pon my&#xD;
honor !"&#xD;
"Pawn nothing, or you lose. The offence is not&#xD;
hanging, unless agreeably. The name' is one to be&#xD;
repeated. It is a sweet and musical one."&#xD;
This was said good-humoredly, a slight smile lighten-&#xD;
ing pleasantly the otherwise grave face of the speaker.&#xD;
His companion discovered a something significant in the&#xD;
look and speech, was himself slightly confused, and con-&#xD;
cealed it in silence. Hammond quietly turned full upon&#xD;
him, and, laying his hand with affectionate emphasis&#xD;
upon his shoulder, thus addressed him&#xD;
"Look you, Miles, old fellow, there is one small ki~ot&#xD;
between us which remains to be untied."&#xD;
"Knot between us, Randall ?"&#xD;
"Yes; and the sooner we take it between our fingers,&#xD;
the more certain are we to escape the necessity of put-&#xD;
ting our teeth to it. We are here by ourselves, and a&#xD;
few moments more-"'&#xD;
"But, have we time, Randall ?"&#xD;
"Time! Yes; we neither of us care much for the&#xD;
race; we shall lose bu~ little."&#xD;
"But little, in truth. The horses I hear of are only&#xD;
common ones. There is 'Vose's gray, pretty good a~t&#xD;
a quarter; and Biggar's young filly out of 'May&#xD;
Queen;' and the old horse '1~ob,' of Joe Balob, which&#xD;
you know was never of much. account; and Barry, I&#xD;
understand, means to run his 'Fair Geraldine,' of which&#xD;
he brags so much; and-"&#xD;
"Enough of your catalogue," said the othei, with a&#xD;
smile: "I perhaps know quite as much as yourself with&#xD;
regard to the horses likely to be upon the ground; for&#xD;
Tom Nettles was with me yesterday, and he has all the&#xD;
news. The race, he agrees, will be no great shakes, so&#xD;
that, if we lose some of it, we lose nothing-~"&#xD;
"Yes, but Randall, Geraldine will be there early, and&#xD;
without any male attendance. In fact, I promised her&#xD;

to be on the ground at the beginning, in order to let&#xD;
her know all about the horses. She is full of it, and&#xD;
is prepared to bet a world of gloves, and purses, and&#xD;
handkerchiefs. She expects you there early also. She&#xD;
told me, indeed, that you had promised' her-"&#xD;
"Ah! she remembered it, did she?-well 1" after a&#xD;
moment's pause; "we 'shall still be there in season,;&#xD;
what I have to say won't take many minutes. The chief&#xD;
difficulty was to get up the resolution to say it at all,&#xD;
Miles."&#xD;
"The resolution, Randall? Why,' what can it be ?"&#xD;
"Can't you guess ?" replied the other, fixing his&#xD;
eyes 'keenly upon those of hi~ companion. The orbs of&#xD;
the latter sunk beneath the scrutiny.&#xD;
2' I see that yoi~ know. Let us sit here, Miles."&#xD;
They were now beneath a magnificent' cluster of oaks,&#xD;
covering five or more acres of ground, and looking forth,&#xD;
from a noble eminence, on lawn 'and field, and plain,&#xD;
"and high road, that stretched away below. Sylvan&#xD;
seats, manufactured rudely, but not without a native&#xD;
ingenuity, ont of wands of hickory and elm, into Gothi4~&#xD;
and fantastic forms, were conveniently distributed for&#xD;
the lounge, while great streamers of di'ooping gray&#xD;
moss festooned the outstretching arms of the several&#xD;
trees with a drapery not less appropriate than natural.&#xD;
Hammond pointed his companion to one of these seats,&#xD;
while he took another close beside him. An incon-&#xD;
venient pause followed ~f a few moments, which was&#xD;
finally broken by the strong will of the former, which&#xD;
was of that fearless and' frank character that could&#xD;
soon shake itself free of all feelings of social awkward-&#xD;
ness when resolved on the performance of a duty. His&#xD;
hand again rested kindly on the shoulders of Hender-&#xD;
son, as, looking him affectionately .in the face, he thus&#xD;
proceeded to unfold the matter which troubled him.&#xD;
"Miles, old fellow, it won't do, after so many years&#xD;
of close and brotherly communion; years when 'we were&#xD;
all in all to each other, and seemed to live for nobody&#xD;

beside; I say, it won't do for us now to suffer any mis-&#xD;
trust or misui~derstanding.to grow up between us."&#xD;
"Surely not, Randall !-I wouldn't for the world !~-&#xD;
But wha1~ mistrust--'what misunderstanding ?"&#xD;
"Hear me, Miles; mistrusts and misunderstandings&#xD;
grow very naturally and very silently between friends&#xD;
from the slightest beginnings. There's no seeing them&#xD;
at first, unless, the heai~t is watchful of itself, and even&#xD;
then. they are apt to be let alone to grow apace, as all&#xD;
ill weeds do, unless the heart is properly jealous of itsdf.&#xD;
Now, it may be that my heart is equally mistaken in&#xD;
its suspicions of itself and of yours-"&#xD;
" Of miiie, Randall ?"&#xD;
"Yes! I have reason to believe that there has been&#xD;
a slight falling off between us ever since Geraldine&#xD;
Foster returned to the neighborhood."&#xD;
"Randall!" said the other, reproachfully.&#xD;
"It is even so, Miles; but it must not be so an~&#xD;
longer. ,For this reason, I have determined to speak out&#xD;
plainly before the weed grows too strong for the plough-&#xD;
share. We were friends from boyhood until now, and&#xD;
your friendship has been, and I trust will continue&#xD;
to be, quite as precious to me as~ any love of woman.&#xD;
We must continue to be friends, Miles, even, though we&#xD;
should both of us love Geraldine Foster."&#xD;
The other clasped hi~ hands together, as if with&#xD;
a stidden anguish.&#xD;
"Ah, Randall !-J did fear it; 'I did !"&#xD;
"It is unfortunate, Miles, that such is the case, but&#xD;
it is no longer to' be feared, and it need not be fatal to&#xD;
our friendship. I can love Geraldine with all the passion&#xD;
of a Georgian's heart; but, Miles, I can love you too,&#xD;
and I will love you to the last. To be sure of this, we&#xD;
have only to understand each other. There must be no&#xD;
doubts, no 'mistrusts,. no suspicions between us. You&#xD;
love her; you will seek her; you will try to win her&#xD;
love if you can; and for this I shall afford you every&#xD;
proper opportunity, not hesitating to avail myself of&#xD;
the chances that seem to encourage me. Thus far, we&#xD;

&#xD;
have both sought her without interference of each other.&#xD;
We will continue to do so. It is the instinct of a&#xD;
true friendship which has compelled this forbearance.&#xD;
I frankly admit to you that, as yet, she has given me&#xD;
no proofs that she cares one straw for me more than&#xD;
for another. If you can say that you have been more&#xD;
fortunate, speak it out, Miles, like a man, and I pursue&#xD;
her no longer; I leave the field entirely to yourself."&#xD;
"You are a noble fellow, Randall, and deserve, the&#xD;
girl; which I don't. I could no more have mustered&#xD;
the heart to talk of it to you, as you have just done to&#xD;
me, than I could have found wings to fly; yet I felt that&#xD;
that was the only way. I do love her, as you say;&#xD;
but I must own that, like yourself, I have had* no&#xD;
encouragement. But no more does she seem to show&#xD;
favor to others. She has several suitors, you know ?"&#xD;
"Yes! but none, I think, that either of us has need&#xD;
to fear. You, at least, are the only person whose&#xD;
chances disquiet me. She has the sense to perceive&#xD;
your worth-to respect you-"&#xD;
"I don't know that," was the somewhat sullen an-&#xD;
swer, with a discontented shake of the head ;~ "she&#xD;
treats me mighty scurvily, at times. You know her&#xD;
way!"&#xD;
"Yes; but I know it is her way, which shows itself&#xD;
to all others as it shows itself to you, though each&#xD;
person naturally thinks himself the worst treated of&#xD;
all. She is a tyrant,' knows her power, and is but&#xD;
too fond of abusing it; but she is a noble creature, neyer-&#xD;
theless, with all her faults."&#xD;
"A beautiful creature, Randall !"&#xD;
"I don't speak so much of her beauty, Miles, though,&#xD;
as you say, she is very beautiful; but she is a genuine&#xD;
creature. $he is wrong frequently, ana says and does&#xD;
wilful and mischievous things; but I do not think she&#xD;
has any cunning, which I look upon as fatal to ~ll the&#xD;
beauty that woman could possess. She' speaks, and&#xD;
thinks, and feels, very much as if a feeling and honest&#xD;
heart was in her bosom, which had not yet been tortured&#xD;
&#xD;
out of shape and nature by the tricks of society and&#xD;
the teachings of other -women. It is this for which I&#xD;
love her chiefly, and which reconc4es me to so much of&#xD;
her eccentricilies and wilfulness. I suppose she treats&#xD;
you only as she treats me and all others. The truth is~&#xD;
she not only feels her power, and is rash because of&#xD;
her own impetuous spirit, but she has learned to distrust&#xD;
the professions and attentions of gentlemen. She has&#xD;
met with flatteries ,and flatterers at Savannah and&#xD;
Charleston, and has learned .perhap~ to despise them,&#xD;
not because she did not like attention and homage, but&#xD;
that she required them to be interesting as well as&#xD;
supplant. It is the insipidity of beaux, rather than&#xD;
their devotion, that her bold min~I, which resents the&#xD;
commonplace, has learned to distrust and to contemn.&#xD;
Fortunately, you and I are no' beaux, Miles; but she&#xD;
has yet to discover what we are. That she will find&#xD;
out, if time be allowed her, I make no question. I&#xD;
confide in her sincerity of mind; in what seems the&#xD;
very wilfulness of her heart; in its warmth, its impulse,&#xD;
and the shrewd good sense, which is quite as apparent&#xD;
to me in her conduct as her eccentricities."&#xD;
"Ah! Randall, you need to fear nothing," 'was the&#xD;
somewhat responding answer of the other; "I'm think-&#xD;
ing she already&#xD;
else."      y sees you with kinder eyes than anybody&#xD;
"Scarcely, Miles; for I am not taking the course&#xD;
to win her affections suddenly. I confess to some policy&#xD;
in this respect. She would rate me with the rest, if I&#xD;
sought her like the rest. I must approach her as &amp;amp; man,&#xD;
and not as a schoolboy."&#xD;
"You were always a man, Randall, even when a&#xD;
schoolboy."&#xD;
"I'm not sure, Miles, that you pay me any compli-&#xD;
ment in this opinion. My consolation is that it is not&#xD;
just. Your mannish schoolboys are usually destroyed&#xD;
by their precocity. Still, if I can persuade Geraldine&#xD;
that I am a man now-&#xD;

"Nay, nay, Miles; I must have none of this de-&#xD;
spondency. You must pursue your chase with as much&#xD;
hope and ardor as decision. As I have said already,&#xD;
I am not taking the usual course for success, and there&#xD;
is one evil influence particularly at work against me."&#xD;
"What is that?"&#xD;
"iler stepmother's dislike to me, which flows natu-&#xD;
rally from the slights which she complains of at the&#xD;
hands of my mother. My mother, who comes from an&#xD;
old stock, and a very proud one, dislikes the obtrusive&#xD;
and bad manners of Mrs. Foster. It is not that she is&#xD;
of humble origin, but that she is pert and presuming,&#xD;
and has made several efforts, without success, to find&#xD;
her way to my mother's intimacy. Besides, Mrs. Foster&#xD;
evidently inclines to this little fellow, Barry, who treats&#xD;
her with a degree of deference which amounts to syco-&#xD;
phancy, and who, besides, has the prospect of much&#xD;
greater wealth than either of us could possibly hope to&#xD;
acquire. The stepmother must have succeeded before&#xD;
this, had it not been for the native good sense and the&#xD;
strong will of Geraldine. Yet she may at last-"&#xD;
"Who, Geraldine? Never! She despises Barry."&#xD;
"Very likely; indeed, I know she must; but that&#xD;
don't materially impair his chances, should circumstances&#xD;
fibvor him. Many a passionate woman, taken in the&#xD;
lucky moment, has married the object of her loathing.&#xD;
This is woman's weakness. But we needn't linger in,&#xD;
this discussion. I have made a clean breast of it. You&#xD;
have done the same. What next? Why, that we should&#xD;
pursue our objects, Miles, as we have always pursued&#xD;
them, with candor, with mutual sincerity and love.&#xD;
Fair play between us will always keep us friends, let&#xD;
who will get the lady."&#xD;
The cordial gripe of their hands which followed was&#xD;
as an oath between them. Much more was said, which&#xD;
it does not concern us to repeat. A few n~oments&#xD;
found them mounted, both on blooded steeds of the&#xD;
best breeds in the country, and on their way to the&#xD;
&#xD;
country race-course, not yet famous in the sporting&#xD;

after an ancient tribe of Indians, all of whom are&#xD;
extinct.&#xD;

44          AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
IIILIJABEE RACE-COURSE.&#xD;
TN the more thinly settled regions of the South and&#xD;
West, a thousand sports are resorted to, to compensate&#xD;
the want of society, and to supply equivalent pleasures&#xD;
for those of a great city. On public days, the villages,&#xD;
or hamlets rather, are always crowded with people.&#xD;
The County Court brings together hundreds who rejoice&#xD;
that they have no business within its precincts; while&#xD;
on days of sheriff and public sales, other hundreds&#xD;
appear within sight of the auctioneer's hammer, who&#xD;
have neither meanS nor wish to buy. Muster-day calls&#xD;
forth its hosts in addition to those who come for training;&#xD;
and Charity, availing herself of the popular need, opens&#xD;
her frequent fairs for philanthropic purposes, relying&#xD;
on the universal desire for society to persuade into use-&#xD;
less expenditure those whom it would not be easy to&#xD;
tempt to a benevolence for its own sake. Saturday, in&#xD;
these regions, is almost as much a holiday with the&#xD;
full-grown farmer as it is with the schoolboy, ~nd usually&#xD;
takes him to the nearest place of gathering, which is&#xD;
usually a grocery, under the pretence of laying in the&#xD;
supplies for the week; but really with the no less human&#xD;
motive of procuring ~those, social excitements which do&#xD;
flGt always result in the elevation of his humanity.&#xD;
Here, he rewards the patient labor of five days at the&#xD;
plough with potations which exhaust much more cer-&#xD;
tainly than any labor. He calls for his quart of&#xD;
whiskey, which he shares with comrades, who find&#xD;
similar supplies, and, towards evening, he may be seen&#xD;
trending homewards, balancing himself with no little&#xD;
difficulty upon his steed, with a jug well filled, hanging&#xD;
&#xD;
in one end of a sack across his saddle, the other end&#xD;
being stored with such supplies as will soothe the appre-&#xD;
hended anger of his spouse. It is not infrequently&#xD;
the case that, overtasking his capacity, he imbibes too&#xD;
many potations for his equestrianship, and man, jug,&#xD;
and saddle find their way into ditch or thicket, while&#xD;
the unincuinbered horse gradually crops his way home.&#xD;
This, fortunately, is but an occasional history now.&#xD;
There wasa time when it was much more frequent, and&#xD;
associated with other practices-.the brutal scuffle, the&#xD;
vindictive fight, the blasphemous language, which left&#xD;
our hopeful humanity but little of which it could really&#xD;
boast. Happily, this period is one of which the memory&#xD;
grows daily more and more imperfect. The sports of&#xD;
the people of the South and West, even along the border&#xD;
settlements, are of a more grateful character. The&#xD;
horserace is that which more nearly resembles those of&#xD;
the past, since it necessarily brings into most decided&#xD;
activity the animal tendencies of the people. It is here&#xD;
that the great masses prove their affinity with the an-&#xD;
cient Saxon family of Bull!' The picnic and the fishing-&#xD;
party will suffice for girls and boys in the season of&#xD;
romance, which is one simply of mutual confidence and&#xD;
hope; but the turf for all parties, at all seasons. It is*&#xD;
here that all meet as upon a common ground, and amidst&#xD;
a thousand inequalities of wealth and life, sho~w and&#xD;
condition; no one thinks so much or so meanly of him-&#xD;
self as to be absent. Few think of themselves at all,&#xD;
at such a period. The horserace commends itself to the&#xD;
great body of the forest population more than any other&#xD;
amusement. It i~ an image, in some degree, of war. It&#xD;
appeals particularly to a people scarcely one of whom&#xD;
fails to keep, and not one of whom is une~iual to the&#xD;
most excellent management, of a horse. Commend us,&#xD;
accordingly, to the Southern turf. Here, the sport is&#xD;
not an affectation. It is enjoyed with a zest. Here&#xD;
life and nature speak out in all their varieties of cha-&#xD;
racter. The dullest peasant looks animation as the sleek&#xD;
courses wind beneath his sight. His eye becomes bright&#xD;

and knowing. He looks at head, heels, and neck, with&#xD;
the eye of a connoisseur. He feels the breast and&#xD;
shoulders knowingly. He adopts his favorite, and then&#xD;
shouts his preference in defiance to all corners. He is&#xD;
ready with or for a banter. He is prepared to stake&#xD;
his earnings of a year upon his judgment. His greasy&#xD;
pocketbook lies ready in his grasp. His bales of cotton&#xD;
are'. folded up in tens, and twenties, and' hundreds, wait-&#xD;
ing deliverance or companions in bondage. He is no&#xD;
longer a person of drooping and grave aspect, drowsily&#xD;
going forward as if 'without hope or purpose. He is&#xD;
no~w allj life, eager for opposition, and confident of suc-&#xD;
cess. Nor is it the' inferior taste and understanding&#xD;
only to which the announcement holds forth temptation.&#xD;
Edttcation here is not construed to assume the total sub-&#xD;
jection of -the animal nature, and the elevation of the&#xD;
moral at the expense and sacrifice of the passions.&#xD;
The excitement which arises from the contemplation of&#xD;
the bold, the fleet, the strong and energetic, is supposed&#xD;
to be clearly consistent, within certain limits, with the&#xD;
laws of refinement and civilization; and the young dam-&#xD;
sel, who will prattle sentiment with you by the hour,&#xD;
quoting freely and understandingly from the pages of&#xD;
Moore and Wordsworth, yet bounds at the tap of the&#xD;
drum which warns the courser to depart, and glows at&#xD;
the progress of the contending floods; her soul as much&#xD;
excited' at what she sees as the young dragoon for the&#xD;
first time jingling his spurs in the heady tempest of&#xD;
the fight.&#xD;
But a glimpse at the race-course of Hillabee itself&#xD;
will afford us a much better idea of the scene, as it&#xD;
ordinarily appears, than we' could possibly convey by&#xD;
any process of generalization. The ground is chosen&#xD;
in ~ pine barren, which, being entirely level, and free&#xD;
from ridge or inequality for a space of several miles,&#xD;
z'enders it siiitably firm and hard for the required pur-&#xD;
pose. The trees are cleared aWay, leaving a spacious&#xD;
amphitheatre something more than a mile in circumfer-&#xD;
ence. 'Within this space 'the course is laid out in a&#xD;
&#xD;
circle, and designated by ditches running parallel, with&#xD;
a track of eighty feet between them. The 'original&#xD;
forests surround the whole; a 'deep green girdle of mas-&#xD;
sive pines, at whose feet have sprung up, ~t~king the&#xD;
place of those which have been ~radie~ted from the&#xD;
outer edges of the course, a narrow belt, of scrubby oaks.&#xD;
Among these, you see numerous carts ~and wagons.&#xD;
These contain supplies of food and liquor. Here are&#xD;
ginger-cakes and cider, of domestic mangfa~ture. Here&#xD;
are cold baked meats in abundance, ham and "chicken&#xD;
fixings," mutton and pork, spread upon long tables of&#xD;
rough plank, and waiting for customers. On one~hand,&#xD;
you see rising 't~he smokes of a 6ar6acue; a steer is&#xD;
about to be roasted entire above a huge pit, over which,&#xD;
by meaiis of a stake, he hangs suspended. Steed8 arp&#xD;
fastened in every thicket, and groups of saddles lie&#xD;
beneath every tree. Their owners are already scattered&#xD;
about the turf, while hundreds of negroes are ready,&#xD;
within and withoutthe circle, pushing forward wherever&#xD;
there is promise of novelty, and anxious to emulate their&#xD;
betters in perilling every sixpence in their possession&#xD;
on the legs of their several favorites. There 'is a yet&#xD;
greater attraction for these in the huge whjte tent,&#xD;
spread at one extremity of the area; over which hang,&#xD;
in greasy and tattooed folds, the great stripes and stars&#xD;
of the nation. The attraction here is a novelty. It is&#xD;
a company of circus-riders. Their steeds, gayly capa-&#xD;
risoned, have already gone in clamorous' procession over&#xD;
the course to the sound of music; 'a thousand negroes&#xD;
have followed at their heels. Their exercises begin at&#xD;
the closing of the races, which cannot possibly taker&#xD;
place before the afternoon. The internal to these ~is&#xD;
one of the most trying anxiety; to be soothed in part&#xD;
only by the events of the race. For this, the prepara-&#xD;
tions are actively in progress. A glance at the opposite&#xD;
extremity of the ring, where the "judges have a rude&#xD;
but elevated structure, not unlike a Chinese pagoda,&#xD;
shows us a handsome 'sprinkling of other visitors, on&#xD;

in the progress of the day than arises from simple&#xD;
curiosity. There are the sportsmen, the jockeys, the&#xD;
owners of horses, their admirers, riders, and those who,&#xD;
in some way, look to the future with some selfish con..&#xD;
sideration. They dart about in' large survey, or crowd&#xD;
in groups around some favorite steed or speaker. There,&#xD;
you may see a dozen around the drum, whose office it&#xD;
is to give the signal which sets horse and man in motion;&#xD;
and not far distant, you may behold the amateur fifer tha~t&#xD;
perambulates merrily' by himself, discoursing through&#xD;
his instrument, somewhat imperfectly, of Robin Adair&#xD;
and Roslyn Castle. Others, again, are more busily&#xD;
and officially'employed. They. are weighing steed and&#xD;
rider, measuri~ig the track, taking down bets and entries,&#xD;
and, altogether, looking and behaving as if the next&#xD;
movement of the great globe itself dep~bnded upon the&#xD;
wise disposition which that moment should make of their&#xD;
affairs.&#xD;
Looking I3eyond this circle, and the prospect is equally&#xD;
encouraging. The eye naturally falls first upon the&#xD;
imposing cortege of the higher classes. Here you per-&#xD;
ceive, in coach, carriage, barouche,' and buggy, that the&#xD;
upper ten thousand are tacitly permitted by the multi-&#xD;
tude to form a little community to themselves. The&#xD;
vehicles crowd together, as if in sympathy, the carriage-&#xD;
~poles interlacing; the horses withdrawn and fastened&#xD;
in the shade of neighboring thickets. Here, seated in&#xD;
their carriages, appear the ladies, as various in their&#xD;
ages as in their separate style of beauty. They form&#xD;
close compact knots, or circles, according ~o the degrees&#xD;
of intimacy between them, and jealously force out all&#xD;
intruders ; 'leaving such avenues only as will permit the&#xD;
approach on horseback of their several attendants and&#xD;
gallants. Showily and richly dressed, and, surrounded&#xD;
by tljese dashing gentry of the other sex, all well mounted&#xD;
and eager to show' their horsemanship, they give to the&#xD;
scene a gayety and brilliance which wonderfull$r add to&#xD;
its life and animation. Their gallants whirl around&#xD;
them with anxious attentions; now fly off to ascertain&#xD;
&#xD;
the course &amp;amp;f events, and now dash ~back, at full speed,&#xD;
to report progress. They describe and designate the&#xD;
horses to the, ,~elighted fair ones, direct them in their&#xD;
~ choice of favorites, and Jose to them glove and ribbon&#xD;
with the happiest gallantries. You i~ay. note th~ em~&#xD;
blems and badges upon each fair bosom; these. are white&#xD;
and pink, and red and green; they designate the colors~&#xD;
of the selecte~t horses; 'and beauty, in this way, does&#xD;
not feel mortified at being made tributary to the 13 east.&#xD;
The numerous multitude, if less attractive in~&#xD;

imposing. A. glance to the right coi~fines the eye to&#xD;
a crowd in the midst of which a wagon appears~ sure&#xD;
high ed by a r~d streamer which waves tWenty feet&#xD;
froni the peak of a pine sapling. The' shaft is&#xD;
rigidly held in its perpendicular by the. embrace of a&#xD;
group of barrels, from one of which the more abstemious&#xD;
may obtain a draught of domestic, cider or' switchel;&#xD;
while from another, the stronger head imbibes his mo~&#xD;
dicum of whiskey or apple brandy; a poor Western&#xD;
apology for Irish poteen, which, after the first season,&#xD;
our Patrick learns to swallow with something of the&#xD;
relish with which he smacked his lips upon the brown&#xD;
jug in his' native island. Other wagons and flags appear~&#xD;
each in the nn~rgin of the thickets, sheltered by .it~.&#xD;
shade, yet not hidden from the eyes of the thirsty and&#xD;
hungi~y citizen. They divid~ themselves, according to&#xD;
their experience, between the several wagons; and it's-&#xD;
"Ha, Uncle Billy, and what 'have you got~ for a dry&#xD;
throat to-day ?" Or-.&#xD;
"Thar you ar', Daddy Nathan, as bright as a bead&#xD;

"Yes, Joel, my son,, and it's J tha1~s never too olil&#xD;

Then comes the rugged wit' in; answer, fashioned&#xD;
after ,the same model; a mild, good-'hu~6red banter;&#xD;
ending'with a summons to' the boys, to "come up to the&#xD;
rack," and try the peach or apple 'brandy, the whiskey&#xD;
or the 'cider, each according to his taste, of the uncle&#xD;
or the daddy.&#xD;
"Whose treat ?" demands 'two or three in the same&#xD;
breath.&#xD;
"Who's~but Joel Norris's?" or Pete Withers's, or Ben&#xD;
Climes's, or some other well-known boy.of the masses,&#xD;
whom, they have' learned' to reverence for that equal&#xD;
freedom of" hand which enables thein~ with just the&#xD;

meeting, leads 'to the drinking; the drinking to the bet-&#xD;
ting; and they pait, or group themselves together,&#xD;
busy, from the moment in which they appear upon 'the&#xD;
add; much more earnest in the pursuit of fun than in&#xD;
the prosecution of their daily tasks.&#xD;
He 'must be of difficult taste, indeed, whom such a&#xD;
theatre will fail to satisfy. Yonder, upon the grass, sit&#xD;
a cluster of rustic damsels. 'They are only spreading&#xD;
their baskets of cakes, gunjas~ as they call 'them, and&#xD;
boiling huge vessels of 'coffee, Beyond them, at a&#xD;
little distance, a~pc'ar others of the sisterhood, busy in&#xD;
preparing their tables With, plate; knife, and fork. To-&#xD;
wards noon you will see them smoking with hot dishes,&#xD;
and well surrounded by hungry gamesters.' Cards and&#xD;
dice already begin to 'interest other parties, thai 'crouch&#xD;

and' the more ~personal matters of "poker" and "old&#xD;
siedge"'rensler many an ardent spirit momentarily in-&#xD;
&#xD;
different to. the a~pproa~,hing. horserace, upon which he&#xD;
has no sixpence left to stake. You will see, him ~stai~t&#xD;
to his feet: as the shouts of the crowd without, and&#xD;
the rush of the horses, announce ~the approach of the&#xD;
contending steeds; but 8 glance suffices ~ and, satisfied&#xD;
that he neither wins nor ~1oses by the event, he sinks&#xD;
down upon the turf or log, and renews the gam~ of&#xD;
"brag" with fresh noncl~aldnce and audacity.&#xD;
Look, now~ at the ring forming within the wood, where&#xD;
an eager ci~'cle. encourage two rivals to a stand-up&#xD;
wrestle. .They are stripped to the buff; the br~ad br~as~,&#xD;
and full, rigid muscle, promising a noble struggle. They&#xD;
approach with equal deliberation and gob4-humor, and&#xD;
the hug is fairly taken.. They pause, and each lifts the&#xD;
other from his feet.; and now they bend to it and wave&#xD;
to and fro,' like tail saplings~ shaken adversely by eapri-&#xD;
cious winds; now yield, now recover; a stein,' close&#xD;
issue, very doubtful to the bystanders, who~ soon for~&#xD;
getting their individuality, unconsciously follow the&#xD;
wrestlers in all their contortions, and, before they know&#xD;
where they are, glide frito the ring and into the, em-&#xD;
brace of welhniatched. opponents, with ~w'hom they tug&#xD;
and tumble about without a single word of preliminary.&#xD;
In the shade of yonder avenue~ you see a couple at-&#xD;
'tended by their admiring followers, coats and shoes cast&#xD;
off, hands clasped, and about to dart forward in a foot-&#xD;
race of a hundred yards. Beyond them, still 'farther in&#xD;
the 'wood, you are called upon to witness, a trial of skill&#xD;
between the crack rifles of two adjoining counties, of&#xD;
whom their respective friends have been boasting for&#xD;
several seasons. They have now, for the~ first time,&#xD;
been brought together. A race-turf, like that of lila-&#xD;
bee, will assemble the best fellows of several counties&#xD;
upon extra~rd~inary occasions. They have planted a&#xD;
dollar at eighty yards. Could a shilling be seen ~t&#xD;
that distance; the smaller coin had been preferred&#xD;
And thus the field is laid off and divided. Thus the&#xD;
parties group themselves throughout the day, except&#xD;
when the race is of peculiar interest, when all ~rnall&#xD;

"A short horse is soon curried."&#xD;
"Are you man enough, Ned Ramsey, to curry a long&#xD;
one ?" cried one from the crowd, who now pressed for-&#xD;
ward and appeared amid the ring. His presence caused.&#xD;
a sensation. It was well calculated to do so. He was&#xD;
small of person; a lively, dapper-looking person, seem-&#xD;
ingly of gentle birth and of occupations which implied&#xD;
no labor ;-a smooth, pale cheek, and a bright, restless&#xD;
black eye. His hair was long, and fell from under a&#xD;
green cloth cap, from which hung a gay green tassel;&#xD;
and several great rings might be seen upon his fingers.&#xD;
But the rest of his equipment was what fixed every eye.&#xD;
It consisted of a close-fitting jacket, with a short tail,~&#xD;
like that of a light dragoon, and small-clothes, all of&#xD;
scarlet, after the fashion of an English jockey, and his&#xD;
white-topped boots completed the equipment. The habit'&#xD;
had been copied from an English print; and a good leg,&#xD;
and rather good figure, though petit, had justified, in&#xD;
the eye of vanity, the strange departure from all the&#xD;
customs of the country.&#xD;
"It's Captain Jones Barry," ~sa~ one of the specta-&#xD;
tors, in an under tone, to another who had ii~ade some&#xD;
inquiry: "He's rich enough to make any sort of fool~&#xD;
ofrhimself and nobody see the harm of it." At the&#xD;
same moment, it could be seen that Ned Ramsey ex-&#xD;
changed significant looks with the well-dressed* stranger,&#xD;
who had been his shadow through the morning, as if&#xD;
disposed to say, "This is our man."&#xD;
"I say, Ned Ramsey," cried Barry, "are you man&#xD;
-enough to curry a large horse? I've seen your nag;~&#xD;
she's a pretty creature,' that's true; but I know some-&#xD;

death on her. 'Twon't take much to bury me, that's&#xD;
true; but what thar is-"&#xD;
"There! can you roll out against that ?" asked Barry,&#xD;
as he laid a fifty dollar note upon his palm.&#xD;
"~Tw~ll go hard to drain me dry, but I ain't to be&#xD;
bluffed, neither; and though it takes from what II put&#xD;
away to pay for .the nag, here's at you!" and the re-&#xD;
quired amount was brought forth; but this time it came&#xD;
from a side pocket, in the coat of Ramsey, who, it was&#xD;
observed seemed to find some difficulty in detaching it&#xD;
from its 'place of security. Lazy Jake Owens was not&#xD;
insensible to this demonstration. It seemed to open to&#xD;
him new views of the case, and he now proceeded to re-&#xD;
examine the strange animal upoii which so good a judge&#xD;
as Ned Ramsey had so much to peril. But the new-&#xD;
corner, whom we' shall know hereafter as Squire Barry,&#xD;
was not similarly impressed with the proceeding.&#xD;
"Too much," said he, "for 'Crazy Kate,' Ned Ram-&#xD;
sey! I have a nag of my own, as nice a little bit of filly&#xD;
as is on the ~ground to-day.' I ~reckon you never saw&#xD;
or heard of her. Her name was 'Betsey Wheeler,' a&#xD;
crack mare of this county, and her sire was a New Or-&#xD;
leans horse, whose i~me I now forget."&#xD;
"I know the mar you speak of," answered Ramsey,&#xD;
looking up, but without appearing to discover the man&#xD;
Burg, who stood behind Barry, ~and to whom he had&#xD;
* spoken of this same mare an hour before in terms of e~&amp;amp;-&#xD;
- feeding admiration. "The mar', 'Betsey Wheeler,' was&#xD;
famous at a hunt. I can't say for the filly; I don't&#xD;
know that I ever seed her. But you can tell me what&#xD;
about her, Squire ?"&#xD;
"She's mine, ~and I believe in her; I believe in her&#xD;
against your 'Graystreak,' there: that I do !"&#xD;
"Well,, Squire, you have a right to 'believe in your&#xD;
nag; she's ~your own, and you know her., 'Gray-&#xD;
streak~s' mine, though not quite paid for yit, and I've a&#xD;
notion that i've a right to believe in her; she's got the&#xD;
heels to believe in. But what's the use of believing&#xD;
when every picture (bank-note) that ~you have has got its&#xD;
&#xD;
fellow already? If you was to go your belief ~'ery&#xD;
strong, I couldn't say a word agin it !"&#xD;
"What say you to another fifty ?"&#xD;
"It's tough, but let's see your filly; if she's much like&#xD;
her dam," hesitating.&#xD;
"What! scared, old fellow ?"&#xD;
"No! not exactly seared, but a little dubious! I&#xD;
know'd the dam; she was a. clean-heeled critter."&#xD;
* Looking up, he pretended to discover 'Burg, the for-&#xD;
mer owner of the filly, for the first time. "Ah!" said&#xD;
he, "Burg, you're a keener." Barry looked gratified..&#xD;
He exulted in the notion that he had bluffed the bully;&#xD;
and Ramsey walked forward, with a side-long air,&#xD;
switching .his whip as he went with the manner of a&#xD;
man half discomfited. lie was pinned suddenly by Lazy'&#xD;
Jake Owens, who had just returned from a reinspection&#xD;
of "O-raystreak."&#xD;
"Ned," said the latter in a whisper, calling him&#xD;
aside, "I see your game! We've got but three V's on&#xD;
this brush; if you'll let me~ I'll take the fence and say'&#xD;
quits ?"&#xD;
"What, hedge ?" said Ramsey; " no you won't !"&#xD;
do as you please; but, if this bet's to hold, you don't&#xD;
Jones Barry."&#xD;
"You'll not put your' spoon into my dish, Jake ?"&#xD;
"I w6n't be dished myself if Ican help it."&#xD;
"Well! I'll let' you off, if you'll let your nag run.&#xD;
Keep your tongue, and you may keep your. V s."&#xD;
"It's a bargain-mum's the word !"&#xD;
"Do you know this filly, Jake ?" said Ramsey, half&#xD;
aloud, as 'he saw Barry approaching.&#xD;
"A nice critter to the eye, but I never seed her run.&#xD;
Her dam was a beauty for a n;iile stretch or so."&#xD;
"There she stanAs !" cried Barry; "'I'll back her&#xD;
against the field for any man's hundred."&#xD;
"I'll take you I" quickly responded the stranger, who&#xD;
was Ramsey's shadow.&#xD;
"Who's he ?" inquired Ramsey, in a whisper of Barry&#xD;
himself.&#xD;

"I don't know him at all," answered. Barry. "But&#xD;
I reckon he'll show hi~ money."&#xD;
"I'm ready to cover, sir," was the remark of the&#xD;
stranger, showing his money just as if he had heard the&#xD;
whispered reply of Barry to Ramsey. The bet was&#xD;
taken down, and the bill covered in the hands of a third&#xD;
person. Ramsey did not linger to behold these pro-&#xD;
ceedings, but occupied himself in a close' examination of&#xD;
]3arry's filly. The eye of the latter, with an exulta-&#xD;
tion which it could not conceal, beheld the grave ex~res~&#xD;
sion in that of the jockey. He saw the head of the&#xD;
latter'shaken ominously.&#xD;
"Isn't she a beauty, Ramsey? I call hei the 'Fair&#xD;
Geraldine,' after the most beautiful lady in the world."&#xD;
"You're right, to pay the filly such a compliment.&#xD;
She's the most sweetest little critter! Will you sell her,&#xD;
squire ?"&#xD;
"Sell 'her; no! not for any man's* thousand dollars."&#xD;
'~ You'll not get' t4at, I reckon. But she's got the&#xD;
heels; that's cla'r! she'll run 1"&#xD;
"Will she? well! Can she do 'Graystreak?'"&#xD;
"N-o! I don't exactly think she can."&#xD;
"You don't?' well! Can 'Graystreak' do her ?"&#xD;
"Y-&amp;amp;s! I reckon."&#xD;
"You reckon? well! If such is your reckoning, I sup-&#xD;
pose you're ready to match your mind with your money.&#xD;
What'll you go, on the match?"&#xD;
"Well, squire, you see I'm quite clear up. 'Bating&#xD;
what I've put aside to pay for 'Graystreak,' I don't&#xD;
suppose I've got more than a single Mexican or~ two.&#xD;
I might raise three, or, prehaps, five upon a pinch; but&#xD;
I shouldn't like to go more."&#xD;
"2Be it five, then," said Barry, eagerly; and the seem-&#xD;
ingly reluctant 'pieces were fished up to the light~ out' of&#xD;
the assorted contents of the deep pockets of the jockey.&#xD;
"Now," said Barry, tauntingly; "what's the value' of&#xD;
a horse, if you're afraid to risk on her? You say you've&#xD;
got money to pay for 'Graystreak?' How much did you&#xD;
give for her ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
~C Oh! that's telling, squire."&#xD;
"Well, I don't care to know; but how much have&#xD;
you made up towards paying.&#xD;
"Well, a matter of seventy-five or eighty dollars left."&#xD;
"Which might be a hundred. But whatever it 10, N"ec~&#xD;
Ramsey, I'm clear that if~you valued the heels of your&#xD;
horse at all; if, indeed, you were not frightened, you'd&#xD;
see it all covered before&#xD;
course."                you'd be bantered off the&#xD;
"Squire, you're a little to~ hard upon a fellow," wa~&#xD;
the so~e~hat deprecating reply.&#xD;
"Oh! it's the turn against you, then, Ramsey," was&#xD;
the retort Jf Barry. "You had the laugh and banter:&#xD;
against everybody before. Well! you can taste the feel-&#xD;
ing for yourself. Now, if you're a man, I banter you to~&#xD;
empty yotir pockets on the match; every fip down; an&amp;amp;&#xD;
I cover ~it, fip for fip, and eagle for e~gle. I'm your&#xD;
man, Ramsey, though you never met with him before."&#xD;
It w~s with the air of the bully, desperate with&#xD;
defeat' and savage with his apprehensions, that ~Ramsey&#xD;
dashed his hands, into his bosom, drawing forth, as he&#xD;
replied, a pocketbook which' had hitherto been un-&#xD;
shown-&#xD;
"I'm not to be bantered by any man, though 1. lose&#xD;
every picayune I have in the world. 'I'm a poor man,&#xD;
but, make or break, thar goes. NQ man shall bluff me~&#xD;
off the track, though the horse runs off her legs. Thar,&#xD;
squire, you've pushed me to the edge of the water; and&#xD;
now I'll go my death on the drink. Thar! Count! Ef&#xD;
my figuring ain't out of the way, thar's one hundred&#xD;
and five dollars in that heap !"&#xD;
"That's the notch," said a bystander, as the bills&#xD;
were counted.&#xD;
"Covered I" cried Barry, with. a look of exultation.&#xD;
He had obtained a seeming victory over the cock of the&#xD;
walk. The more sagacious "Lazy Jake Owens," how-&#xD;
ever, muttered to himself, with the responding air of&#xD;
one who was compelled to acknowledge the genius of&#xD;

"A mighty clever chap, that Ned Ramsey, by the&#xD;
hokey V~ His mar' is paid for this day, if he never paid&#xD;
for her before."&#xD;
Barry~ cook-sure, of the result, now slapped his pocket-&#xD;
book with the flat of his hand, as he lifted it over his&#xD;
head, and cried to the circle around him:&#xD;
"There is more money to be had on this match,&#xD;
gentlemen. Here 'are a couple of bran new C's (hun-&#xD;
dreds) ready for company. Who covers them against&#xD;
the 'Fair Geraldine?'"&#xD;
The stranger, the distant shadow of Ramsey, again&#xD;
modestly approached with two similar bank-notes al-&#xD;
ready in his hands. The bets were closed.&#xD;
"I must find out who that stranger is," muttered&#xD;
Ramsey, in the hearing of Lazy Jake Owens and Barry.&#xD;
The latter did not seem to hear or to attend to him;&#xD;
but, as he walked away, Lazy Jake whispered to Ram-&#xD;
sey:&#xD;
"If so be you ain't pretty well knowing to each other&#xD;

The latter simply drew down the corner of his eye,&#xD;
in a way that Lazy Jak~ understood, and the parties&#xD;

WE left our' two sworn friends on the road, rushing&#xD;
'3    f&#xD;
forward, at a pleasant canter, foi~ the race-course. They&#xD;
were within a mile of it, when they were joined by one&#xD;
who came forth suddenly from a private avenue through&#xD;
the woods, which conducted to his homestead. The&#xD;
parties at once recognized each other as old acquaint-&#xD;
ances. The stranger was a goodlooking person of thir-&#xD;
ty; not exactly one whom we should call a gentleman,&#xD;
but a frank, hearty, dashing, good companion, such as&#xD;
one likes to encounter at muster-ground or hunting-chib.&#xD;
He was, simply dressed. in the habits of~ the conutry;&#xD;
not those of the plain farmer, nor those of the profes.-&#xD;
sional man. A loose, open hunting-shirt of blue home-&#xD;
spun, with ~a white fringe, was not considered a habit too&#xD;
picturesque for the regiQn, and it sat becomingly upon.&#xD;
the large frame, and corresponded with the easy and&#xD;
not ungraceful 'carriage of the wearer. Tom Nettles&#xD;
was a character, but not ,an ~obtrusive one; a i~nan, and&#xD;
not a caricature. He loved fun, but it came t6 him&#xD;
naturally; was something of a practical joker, but his&#xD;
~;   merriment seldom left a wound 'i~ehind it; his, eyes were&#xD;
L    always brightening, as if anticipating a good thing, and&#xD;
they did not lose this expression even on serious occa-&#xD;
sions. Tom Nettles was much more likely to go into a&#xD;
fight with a 'grin on his visage' than with any more ap..&#xD;
proptiate countenance. But let him speak for himself.&#xD;
F "Good morning, Miles; good morning, Hammond;&#xD;
you're on the road something late, are 'you not ?"&#xD;

"Something late? No! We are soon enough, I&#xD;
fancy."&#xD;
"Quite SOQII enough for the race," said the other;&#xD;
"but Jones Barryrode by my house two hours ago, and&#xD;
stopped long enough to tell 'me that' he was to be on the&#xD;
ground early to see Mi~ss Geraldine Foster. He said&#xD;
you had both made the same 'promise, and he was ient to&#xD;
have the start of y~u. He seems to think it a rule in&#xD;
love matters, as in a barber-shop, first come first served,&#xD;
and the first comer always the best customer." Randall&#xD;
Hammond smiled, but said nothing; while Miles Hen-&#xD;
derson, taking. out his watch,. looked a little anxious as&#xD;
lie remarked:~&#xD;
"'We are later than 'I tbeught for."&#xD;
"Soon enough, Miles,~' said Hammond, assuringly.&#xD;
Nettles continued&#xD;
"But you should see the figure Barry has made, of&#xD;
himself. He's. dressed, froi~head to foot, in scarlet, and'&#xD;
pretends that it's the right dress for a man that means&#xD;
to run his own horse.. lie says it's the dress of one of&#xD;
the ~Englis'h noblemen-I / forget his name-who has'&#xD;
grown famous on the turf. He owns, you know, that&#xD;
clever little filly of 'rBetsey Wheeler,' that belonged to&#xD;
Burg Fisher. ~The dam was a good thing, and the filly&#xD;
promises to be something more, if Barry don't spoil her&#xD;
with his notions;. and he's full of them. He means to&#xD;
~un the filly to-dq, and has~~ christened her the 'Fair&#xD;
Geraldine,' after a young h~dy you know, both of you,&#xD;
N   I reckon. But, though he may get the lady, 'if he's not&#xD;
wide awake he'll be chiselled in the race; for Ned Ram-&#xD;
sey is out, with his eye set for game, and he's too old a~&#xD;
hand at the game not to do a, young, 'foolish fellow like&#xD;
Jones Barry, with mighty little trouble."&#xD;
The friends allowed. 'their companion to talk. He was&#xD;
a person to use the privilege. They interposed a "'no"&#xD;
or "yes," ~t'. intervals,. and this. perfectly satisfied him.&#xD;
Hammond, meanwhile, was good-humored in his replies,&#xD;
and quite at his ease. It was not so with Henderson.&#xD;
Re referred to hi~ wat&amp;amp;IL. repeatedly, and more than&#xD;
&#xD;
once made a movement for going forwards at a pace&#xD;
more rapid than that into which they had fallen aftt~r&#xD;
Nettles had joined them.' But. his companions, on the&#xD;
contrary, seemed 'both equally determined not to second&#xD;
the movement. Whey hung 'back, and, Hammond point-&#xD;
edly said-.&#xD;
"Don't hurry, Miles. This good little fellow, Barry,&#xD;
attaches so much importance to hi~ being first' in the&#xD;
field, that it would be cruel to disturb his prospects."&#xD;
Nettles smiled, lie understood the speaker, and knew&#xD;
equally well his character and that of his companion.&#xD;
"If being in' a hurry," said he, "' would win ..a lady,&#xD;
then Barry's the boy f~r conquest. But there's the&#xD;
mistake. It's my. notion' that it's the last 'coiner that's&#xD;
most likely to do the safe business~ and not the first. A&#xD;
young girl likes to look about her. She soon gets used&#xD;
tQ one face and the' talk of one man, and likes a change&#xD;
that's 'something new.. I wouldn't be. too late; I wouldn't&#xD;
stay off till the very last hour.; wand I'd .always be near&#xD;
enough to be seen and heard' of now and then; nay, I'd&#xD;
like to "be caught sometimes looking 'in the direction of&#xD;
the lady; but then I'd make it a rule never to be too&#xD;
soon or too frequent. It's most important of all things&#xD;
that a man shouldn't be too cheap.1 Better 'the girl&#xD;
should say, 'I wonder why he don't come,' than 'I won-&#xD;
der why he does.'"&#xD;
Our philosopher of the piny wood~ might have gone&#xD;
on for a ~ longer stretch, had he not been 'inter-&#xD;
rupted by an event' that gave a new direction to the&#xD;
party. 'They had 'reached a bend 'in the road which&#xD;
gave them glimpses of another which made a junction&#xD;
with it, and not fifty yards off they discovered the. car~&#xD;
riage of Mrs. Foster coming directly towards theme&#xD;
They at on.pe' joined it and made their respects, Miles&#xD;

70           AS GOOD AS A COMEDY OR~&#xD;
an ill-bred, pretentious woman, who had succeeded the&#xD;
mother of Geraldine in the affections of her father, at a&#xD;
time when his feeble health and the impaired condition&#xD;
of his intellect rendered him too anxious for a nurse to&#xD;
be" too scrupulous about a companion. He had raised&#xD;
her from an humble condition to one which she was ill&#xD;
calculated to fill; and, with the ambition to be some-&#xD;
body, she determined to carry her point by audacity&#xD;
rather than by art, She was a bold,'forward beauty in&#xD;
her ~routh; was a bolder woman now, still pleasing in&#xD;
her face, but no longer a beauty; a woitian given to&#xD;
petty scandals, and satisfied with petty triumphs; en-&#xD;
vious of the superior, malicious~ where opposed, and in-&#xD;
solent when submitted to. What was defective or cen-&#xD;
surable in the manners of her step-daughter was dearly&#xD;
referable to. the evil influence of this woman, and the&#xD;
d~uhtful training of the distant boarding~sChool to which&#xD;
she had been confided at. a very 'early period of her life.&#xD;
That she was 'not wholly'spoiled by these unfavorable&#xD;
influences, was due wholly to the native excellence of&#xD;
her, mind and heart. She was a passionate, 'selfwilled&#xD;
damsel; not easily rendered submissive in conflict; ca-&#xD;
pricious 'in her tastes, yet tenacious of her objects;&#xD;
delighting in the exercise of power, without any d~flnite&#xD;
idea' of its uses or value'; and by no means insensible to&#xD;
those p personal charms which, indeed, were beyond all&#xD;
question; even of the hostile and the jealous. But, in&#xD;
opposition to these evil characteristics, 'she was magnani-&#xD;
mous and generous; her heart was peculiarly susceptible&#xD;
~ treatment and impressions of kindness. If her tastes&#xD;
were capricious, they at least were always directed to&#xD;
objects which were delicate and noble; if she was pas-&#xD;
sionate, it was when roused by sense of wrong or sup-&#xD;
posed injustice; if she was slow to submit' in conflict, she&#xD;
was' never long satisfied with a victory, which a calmer&#xD;
judgment taught' her was undeservedly won, and she&#xD;
knew how to restore the laurels which she had 'usurped,&#xD;
with a grace and ~ti sWeetness that amply compensated&#xD;
the injustice. Her mind was vigorous 'and active, and&#xD;
&#xD;
THB TEN~ES8EEA~'8 STORY.           71&#xD;
this led to her frequent errors; for it was a mind un-&#xD;
trained, and steadfast and tenacious of a cause which, it&#xD;
was yet to discover, was not tb~at of truth and justice.&#xD;
She was a creature, indeed, of many contradictions; a&#xD;
wild, high-souled, spiritual, but capricious creature; the&#xD;
very ardor of whose temperament led her into tumultuous&#xD;
sports of fancy, such as only shock beyond forgiveness&#xD;
the staid and formal being to whom there is but one&#xD;
God, whose name is Fashion'; but one law, the record of&#xD;
which is found only in what my neighbor thinks.&#xD;
Randall Hammond was by no means insensible to her&#xD;
faults; but he ascribed them 1~o the proper cause, He&#xD;
felt that she was a, character; but a character ~whic~h&#xD;
could be shaped, by able hands, into that of a noble&#xD;
woman ~nd a faithful wife. He looked upon her with&#xD;
eyes of such admiration as the Arabian casts upon ~the&#xD;
splendid colt of the desert, whom he knows, once sub,'&#xD;
dued by his art, he can manage with a whisper or a~&#xD;
silken cord. But he strove-as earnestly as the Arab&#xD;
who conceals his purposes, and scarcely suffers the ani-&#xD;
mal whom he would fetter to see the direct purpose in&#xD;
his eye---to keep his secret soul-hidden from the object&#xD;
of his admiration. He was not unwilling that'she should&#xD;
see that she had awakened in his bosom an -interest, a&#xD;
curiosity, 'at least, which broug~it him not infrequently.&#xD;
to her presence, but he strove, with all the ~success of a~&#xD;
man who has a will sufficiently 'strong to subdue 'and&#xD;
restrain his passions, to guard his eyes and 'his tongue&#xD;
so that the depth of . his emotions could not easily, or~&#xD;
at all,' be fathomed. It is sufficient here to say that&#xD;
Geraldine Foster was not insensible to his superiority.&#xD;
She had very soon learned to ~distinguish and~ to dis-..&#xD;
critninate between her several suitors; but the bearing&#xD;
of Hammond, though studiously respectful, in some de-~&#xD;
gree piqued her pride. If a suitor, he was not~ a ser-.&#xD;
~rant. If he spoke to her earnestly, i~ was the woman,&#xD;
and not 'the angel he addressed. '~This reserve seemed&#xD;
to betray a caution which no maiden likes to detect in I&#xD;
the approaches of her h~ver, and seemed to implyade-&#xD;

ficiency of that 'necessary ardency and warmth' which&#xD;
was, in truth, the very last want which could be charged&#xD;
upon this gentleman. Mrs. Foster first insinuated this&#xD;
doubt into the bosom, of her step-daughter, and the feel..&#xD;
ing of the consciously underbred woman made her stu-&#xD;
-dious~ in keeping up the suspicion. She was not satis-&#xD;
fied with the superior rank of Hammond's family; was&#xD;
mortified at the coldness and distance of his mother,&#xD;
whom she well knew to have been intimate with the first&#xD;
wife of Mr. Foster; and, though the peculiarly respect-&#xD;
ful' deportment of Hammond himself left her entirely&#xD;
without occasion for complaint, the very rigor of hi~&#xD;
carriage, the studious civility of his deportment, by re-&#xD;
straining her freedom with his own, was a check upon&#xD;
= that vulgar nature which is never satisfied till it can&#xD;
subdue the superior nature to its own standards. ,Mrs.&#xD;
Foster could say nothing against Randall Hammond;&#xD;
but -she could not conceal her preference for all other&#xD;
suitors. Miles Henderson was decidedly a favorite ; ~but&#xD;
there was a charm in the idea that Barry's fortune could&#xD;
positively "buy the Hammonds out and out," that in-&#xD;
clined the scale of her judgment greatly in behalf of the&#xD;
latter. IBut we are at the course, the horses are' taken&#xD;

"Dear me, Captain Barry," exclaimed Mrs. Foster,&#xD;
"how splendidly, you are dressed !"&#xD;
"Is that your uniform in the mi1i1~ia, Captain Barry ?"&#xD;
was the demand of Geraldine. -&#xD;
"l2hey'd set him up for a scarecrow, if it was," said&#xD;
Nettles; "and he'd have to treat as long as the liquor&#xD;

"0 hush, Nettles; you're always with your joke 'at&#xD;
everything and everybody. I Wonder what there- is in&#xD;
my- clothes for you to laugh at-?" - -&#xD;
"Not much, .1 grant you, while you're in 'em," was&#xD;
the reply. - "But answer Miss Foster. She' wants to&#xD;
know what uniform it is you've got 'on."&#xD;
"Oh! ifs no uniforgi, Miss Geraldine. This is the&#xD;

* "0, Mr. Nettles 1" exclaimed the maternal lady.&#xD;
~ Nor is the advantage wholly 'in the color," con-&#xD;
tiniled. Nettles, with gr&amp;amp;aV gravity. "The cut of the&#xD;

wlia~ us&amp;amp;to make ot~ that little pigeon-tail depe~nd~nee&#xD;
in. the rear. I can scarcely suppose it meaiit to be orDa-&#xD;

All eyes followed the direction, thus' given them, and&#xD;
one of' Barry's own hands involuntarily clutched the&#xD;
little puckered peak which stuck out in the most comical&#xD;
fashion above his hips. Barry~ began to suspect that he&#xD;
was laughed at,~ and Mrs. Foster interposed, to change&#xD;

"That I. do, iVirs. Foster; I have pretty nigh five&#xD;
hundred on his heels, and I'll trust to no rider but my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
*"' Well, that's right; that's what I call manly,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Foster.&#xD;
"Y6u have certainly a very beautiful creature, Cap-&#xD;
tairi Barry," was the remark of Geraldine, turning from&#xD;
a~ somewhat subdued conversation with Henderson, to&#xD;
which, Hammond was an almost silent partner. "You&#xD;
gentlemen," continued the fair~ girl, "are to teach me&#xD;
how I am to bet. That is, you are tQ. give me your&#xD;
opinions, which I shall follow as I choose. See, I have&#xD;

"Yes! and certainly Captain Barry rides a very&#xD;

"She has the logs of an. angel," said Barry.'&#xD;
"Better if 'she had its wings, I should think,"~ w~s the&#xD;
immediate remark of Geraldine.&#xD;
"Very good, very excellent,' Miss "G&amp;amp;aldine; cer-&#xD;
tainly, for a race, the swings *of an angel might be 'of&#xD;

them, Her legs will answer.".&#xD;
'"Should she lose, Barry, y6iu'il have to change l~er&#xD;
name.' Do you know the name of 4hi~ beautiful' crea-&#xD;

"0, yes'! I have heard how greatly I am honored'&#xD;
and, in truth, I shall ~feel quite unhappy if she does not&#xD;
win. 'I must certainly, at all hazards, 'bet upon my&#xD;

"You may do it boldly !" said i3arry; with . confi.&#xD;
dence; "I'll ins~fre your losses."&#xD;
"Who'll insure you, Barry? 'Your chances will de-&#xD;

"And where's this 'Graystreak?'"&#xD;
The animal was only at a little distance. The pro-&#xD;
prietor, the renowned Ned Ramsey, was busy, at the&#xD;
inomen1~, in preparing her for the course. The eyes of&#xD;
the party were directed to the beautiful creature in ad~&#xD;
miratjon. She shipped to the sun finely; as if clad in&#xD;
velvet. Her clean liinbs,~Wiry and slender; the spirit in&#xD;
lw~r eye, and the airy life in all her action, at once fixed&#xD;
the regards of so good a judge as Nettles. Nor was&#xD;
Randall Hammond indilferont' to the beauty of her form,&#xD;
and the promise in her limbs.&#xD;
"Thisfool and his money have parted !" said Nettles,&#xD;
in a whisper to Hammond. "Your horse is the only one&#xD;
that can take the legs from this filly, and it wotild give&#xD;
him trouble!"&#xD;
The answer of Hammond was unheard, as they reap-&#xD;
proached the carriage where the ladies sat.&#xD;
"Well, gentlemen 1" said Geraldine, impatiently; "I&#xD;
am~ eager to be busy. Come, let me have your judgment.&#xD;
What horse shall I adopt as myfavorite ?"&#xD;
"Are you not fairly committed to your namesake ?"&#xD;
asked Hammond, with a quiet manner; his eye, how-&#xD;
ever, looking deeply into hers. She answered the gaze&#xD;
~y dropping hers; replying quickly, as she did so :-&#xD;
"No indeed! the 'compliment to me must not 'be&#xD;
made to lose my money or discredit my judgment. For&#xD;
sur~, Captain IRarry~himseif-'lias no such design to injure&#xD;
me. But I ~Io fancy the beauty of:hi~ horse, and if you&#xD;
think her fleet, Mr. Hammond-"&#xD;
Shepansed:-&#xD;
"The 'Fair Geraldine' is doubtless a very fleet, as she&#xD;
a very beautiful creature !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"But," said Nettles, finding that Hammond hesi~&#xD;
tated, "that strange mare you see yonder undressin&#xD;
is sure to beat her."&#xD;
"Sure to beat her !" exclaimed Barry, who drew nigh&#xD;
in season to hear the' last words. "What'll you go on&#xD;
the word?"&#xD;
"Horse, house, lands, ox, ass, and everything that is&#xD;
mine 1"&#xD;
"Nay, nay! to the point; look to your pocketbook !"&#xD;
"Well, if you will have it, we'll say a hundred on&#xD;
the match; '~raystreak' agaitist ~ny horse in the field,&#xD;
unless hammond runs his 'Ferraunt,' arid then 'Fer-&#xD;
raunt' against the field!"&#xD;
"'Ferraunti' " said Barry ; ' "that, the large iron&#xD;
gray he rides. Why, he came on him !" looking ~to&#xD;
Hammond inquiringly. The latter had yielded hi~ horse&#xD;
to his groom, and was now sitting on the box of~ the&#xD;
carriage, the driver being withdrawn to look after his&#xD;
horses. "Fefraunt" was already groomed, and resting&#xD;
in the shade at. a little distance under~ the charge of the&#xD;
servant. The finger of Nettles pointed where he stood.&#xD;
The eye of Gerahilne at once followed ~he direction of&#xD;
his finger, and while 2 Barry and Nettles arranged their&#xD;
stakes, and withdrew to look at "Ferraunt," a short&#xD;
dialogue, not withoiit its interest, took place between&#xD;
herself and Hammond.&#xD;
"Is your horse2 so very fleet, Mr. Hammond, as Mr.&#xD;
Nettles says heis?"&#xD;
"He 'has the reputation of being a very fast horse,&#xD;
Miss Foster; indeed, he is probably the fastest on the&#xD;
ground."&#xD;
"Well; you mean to run him, of course&#xD;
"Why of course ?"&#xD;
"Oh, why not? To own a race-horse, indeed, 'seems&#xD;
to imply racing. What is the use of him otherwise ?"&#xD;
"One may love to look at a beautiful animal with-&#xD;
out seeking always to test his speed;. at all events,&#xD;
without seeking to game with it."&#xD;

"To game! Is not that a harsh expression, Mr.&#xD;
Ilamrnond3" :.&#xD;
Perhaps it- is, since gentlemen have not often the&#xD;
of gain when they engage in this amusement. It&#xD;
~ioble and beautiful exercise of a beautiful animal&#xD;
that they practise this recreation, and not for its profits."&#xD;
"Well; and gi~u could have no eye to the gains,&#xD;
Mr. Hammond ?"&#xD;
"No. But how small is the proportion of gentlemen,&#xD;
go~rned by such principles, to those who usually col-&#xD;
lect at a sceiw and on an occasion like this! ~What a&#xD;
greedy appetite for gain d6es it provoke among thousands&#xD;
who have no other object, and find no pleasure iti the&#xD;
exquisite picture of the scene-in the glorious conflict&#xD;
~f rival blood and temperament-in the wild grace of&#xD;

can ~afford to win or lose. If they win, they acquire&#xD;
certain~ appetites from success, which usually end in&#xD;
Vheir:iruin.; ami if they lose-though more fortunate in&#xD;
doing. so, as they ~are probably made disgusted with the&#xD;
pursuit.~~z~they yet rob their families of absolute neces-&#xD;
saries, in this miserable search after a diseased luxui~y&#xD;
for themselves."&#xD;
"I confess I am no philosoPher, Mr~ Hammond. I&#xD;
don't see things in the ,same light with yourself, and&#xD;
can, scarcely believe in such dreadful consequences from&#xD;
a spectacle that is really ~o fine and 'beautiful."&#xD;
"Oh," said Mrs. Foster, interposing, sneeringly; "oh,&#xD;
Mr. Hammond, you get all those queer notions from&#xD;
your mother.'&#xD;
"You will permit me to respect the woman of my&#xD;
* opinions, M~s~ Foster?" with a respectful but measured&#xD;
bow.&#xD;
"Oh, surely. She's an excellent woman, and I re-&#xD;
spect her very much; but her notions on this subject&#xD;
&#xD;
are very peculiar, I thinks though, in her case, natural&#xD;
enough."&#xD;
This was said with .a degree of significance which did&#xD;
not suffer' Hammond to misunderstand the speaker. His&#xD;
face was instantly and deeply suffused with crimson, as&#xD;
he felt the allusion to the fate of his 'father. His head&#xD;
was, for the moment, averted from the speaker.. In&#xD;
that moment, the malicious woman whispered to her step-&#xD;
daughter, "At him again. I know where the shoe&#xD;
pinches."&#xD;
A slight expression of scorn might have been seen to&#xD;
curl the lips of Geraldine. A pause ensued, which was&#xD;
at length broken by Jianunond, who drew her attention&#xD;
to a showy procession of the pied horses, the calico&#xD;
steeds of the circus company. Some comment followed&#xD;
on the performances of the troupe, when the young lady,&#xD;
in the most insinuating manner, resumed, with Hammond,&#xD;
the subject of his own horse.&#xD;
"But, Mr. Hammond, though you inveigh against&#xD;
racing as a' practice, you can have no objection to run-&#xD;
ning your horse, upon occasions, onOe in a way, as much&#xD;
for the satisfaction of your friends as with any 'other&#xD;
object. Now, I am quite pleased with your dark-look-&#xD;
ing steed. What do you call him ?"&#xD;
"'Ferraunt.'"&#xD;
"Ah! his name indicates his color. He seems to me&#xD;
a military horse.&#xD;
"I got him chiefly as a'charg&amp;amp;r.'~&#xD;
"Oh, yes; I forgot; you are a colonel 'qf militia.&#xD;
But, for a charger, you need an animal at once high-&#xD;
spirited and gentle."&#xD;
"He is both. That, indeed, Miss Foster, is the ch~&#xD;
racer of all high-blooded animal's. The rule holds good&#xD;
among men. The' most gentle are generally the 'most&#xD;
high-spirfted~at once the most patient and the most&#xD;
enthusiastic. The race-horse, next to the mule, makes&#xD;
the best plough-horse.".&#xD;
"But that is surely a contradiction ~ the' mule' being&#xD;
the most 'dogged, stubborn, slow-.-"&#xD;

a contradiction, as you say, to employ animals so utterly&#xD;
unlike for the same purposes, and to find them nearly&#xD;
equally good, it is one that we may, and perhaps must&#xD;
reconcile, on the principle that finds a sympathy in, ex-&#xD;

"Mr. Hammond, it seems to me that all this is per-&#xD;

playful smile and arch manner accompanied this remark&#xD;
of. the young lady. "But I am as perversely resolved&#xD;
Wat you shall not escape. Now, then, let me hear from&#xD;
you. iDo you not intend that 'Ferraunt' shall run to-&#xD;

Jones Barry, who had just that moment reappeared&#xD;
with, Nettles. "I'm not afraid of your 'Ferraunt,'&#xD;
though Nettles tells me he's good against all thjs cro*d.&#xD;
I'm willing to try him. I don't believe in your foreign&#xD;

you never hear anything said in their favor, and you&#xD;
never see anything they do. Now, your 'Ferraunt'&#xD;
comes of good stock, but he's awkWard-"&#xD;
"Awkward !" said Nettles; "ah! Barry, if you could&#xD;
only dance as well."&#xD;
"Well, I'jn willing, to see him dance; and, if Col.&#xD;
Hammond chooses, I'll go. a cool hundred on the 'Fair&#xD;
Geraldine' against him. There's a banter for you."&#xD;
"I won't run my horse, Mr. Barry."&#xD;
"What, bluffed off so soon ?" said Barry, coarsely.&#xD;
"Gail i~ 'what you will, Mr. Barry; I don't run&#xD;
horses."&#xD;
~" But, Mr. Hammond, if you are content to underlie&#xD;
his challenge, you surely will not be so uneourteous&#xD;
as 'to refuse mine. The 'Fair Geraldine' against 'Fer-&#xD;
&#xD;
raunt,' for a pair of gloves. I must maintain the reputa~&#xD;
tion of my namesake."&#xD;
"The ~ Fair Geraldine' must excuse me, if my cour-&#xD;
tesy will not suffer me to accept her challenge.&#xD;
"What? ~you pretend that your horse must beat ?"&#xD;
"I know it, Miss Foster."&#xD;
"And what if I say that I don't believe a ivord of&#xD;
it? that I equally know that the 'Fair Geraldine' is the&#xD;
fastest horse? and I defy you to the trial? There, sir,&#xD;
~yglove'against yours."&#xD;
This was all' sweetly, if not saucily said. The eyes&#xD;
of Hammond were fixed gratefully upon the speaker;&#xD;
but he shook his head.&#xD;
"You must forgive me, if I decline the trial in the&#xD;
case of my horse. Bat, if you will permit me, I cheer-&#xD;
'fully peril my , glove against your favorite in behalf of&#xD;
'Graystreak,' yonder.&#xD;
"No, no, sir; your horse, your 'Ferraunt.'"&#xD;
"You can't refuse,~ colonel," said Barry.&#xD;
"No, Randall !" said Henderson.&#xD;
"Impossible !" cried Nettles; who was anxious to see&#xD;
'Ferraunt' take the field."&#xD;
"A lady's challenge !" cried Mrs. Foster; "chivalry&#xD;
forbids that you refuse."&#xD;
"I am compelled to do so, Miss Foster. 'It would&#xD;
give me pleasure to comply with your wishes, but I never&#xD;
run my' horse, or any horse; I never engage as a prin~&#xD;
cipal in racing of any kind."&#xD;
Nettles and Henderson both drew Hammond aside to&#xD;
argue the matter with 'him. They were followed&amp;amp; by&#xD;
Barry, who 'was in turn followed by the jockey, Ramsey.&#xD;
Nettles had his arguments, which were urged in vain;&#xD;
and, when 'Henderson dwelt on the claims of the lady,&#xD;
Hammond replied, somewhat reproachfully:&#xD;
"Yo~&amp;amp; know, Miles, that I shouldn't run a horse; were&#xD;
all the fair women in~the world to plead."&#xD;
"Well,'.' said Barry, "what a man won&#xD;
pleading, he may do for bantering. ' here do for&#xD;
I'm     for. 'that,&#xD;

"I must decline, Mr. Barry; I'm no racer, and will&#xD;
not run my horse; but, let, me assure you, sir, that your&#xD;
mare, though a very clever thing, could not hold her&#xD;
ground for a moment against him."&#xD;
"IF~asy bragging," said Ramsey, with a chuckle,&#xD;
"when there's no betting."&#xD;
"And as easy to lay a horsewhip over a ruffian's&#xD;
shoulder, sir, when he presumes where ~he has no busi-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
Ramsey~ disappeared in an instant; a roll of the drum&#xD;
followed, giving notice of the approaching struggle;&#xD;
and the desire to see "Ferraunt" on the ground, gave&#xD;
place, among the few, to the more immediate interest&#xD;
which belonged to the known competitors. Barry in-&#xD;
stantly hurried off to his groom and stable; Nettles&#xD;
sauntered away to the starting-post, while Henderson&#xD;
and Hammond returned to the carriage. The latter&#xD;
felt that the manner of Geraldine was changed. Her&#xD;
eye met his, but there was a coldness in the glance,&#xD;
which his instinct readily perceived; but, true to his&#xD;
policy, he suffered it to pass unnoticed; was respectful&#xD;
without being anxious, and attentive without showing&#xD;
too much solicitude.&#xD;
"You," said Geraldine to Henderson, "you, too, I&#xD;
am told, ride a fine and fleet, horse; do you not intend to&#xD;
run him?"&#xD;
"If Miss Foster desires it."&#xD;
"Of course I desire it! What do you call your&#xD;
horse?"&#xD;
"Sorella I"&#xD;
"Sorella! a pretty name. Well, how does she run?&#xD;
Is she fleeter than my namesake ?"&#xD;
"What ~ay you; Randall ?"&#xD;
"Oh, do~i't ask him! He will say nothing that'll please&#xD;
anybody. What's your opinion ?"&#xD;
" That '$orella' is too much for the 'Fair Geraldine!'"&#xD;
"I'll not believe it; and I transfer to you the chal-&#xD;

lenge that your friend scorned, or feared to take up.&#xD;
Which was it, Col. Hammond ?"&#xD;
"Let us suppose feared, Miss Foster I" replied Ham-&#xD;
mond, gently, and with a pleasant smile.&#xD;
"I don't know what to make of you, Col. Hatrrmond.&#xD;
I wish I could make something of you. But I despair;&#xD;
I'll try no longer !"&#xD;
"That you should have even tried, Miss Foster, is a&#xD;
satisfaction to my vanity."&#xD;
"Oh, don't indulge it. Tt was not to give youany&#xD;
pleasure, I assure you, that I thought to try at all; only&#xD;
to please my fancy, and-"&#xD;
"Still, I am gratified that I should, in any way, have&#xD;
contributed to this object."&#xD;
"Nay! you are presuming; you torture everything I&#xD;
say into a compliment to yourself. But, hear me! if you&#xD;
won't run your horse yourself; let me run him. iii&#xD;
ride him. I'm not afraid. I'm ambitious now of taking&#xD;
the purse from the whole field, and snapping my fingers&#xD;
at their Crazy I(ates and Graystreaks, and even their&#xD;
Geraldines. Geraldine against Geraldine. How will&#xD;
~r. Barry like it, I wonder; and that, too, at the cost&#xD;
of his hundreds. Cool hundreds, I think, he calls them;&#xD;
cool, I suppose, from being separated from their compan-&#xD;
ions. Well! will you let me ride your 'Ferraunt?'"&#xD;
"If you will suffer me to place him at your service&#xD;
when at home, Miss Foster I"&#xD;
"No, no! I want a race-horse, not a saddle-horse; I&#xD;
want him here, not at home. Don't suppose I'm afraid&#xD;
to run him. I'~n as good a rider, I know, as almost&#xD;
any on the ground, and---But say! shall I have him ?"&#xD;
"I dare not, Miss Foster; for your own sake, I dart,&#xD;
not. But I feel that you are jesting only--".&#xD;
No, indeed! I'm as serious as I ever was. I don't&#xD;
know what you mean When you say you dare not, unless,&#xD;
indeed, you think-"&#xD;
"Oh !don't ask Col. Hammond any favors, my child,&#xD;
he's so full of notions !" the step-mother again interposed,&#xD;
maliciously. GerNdine threw herself back in the car-&#xD;

riage with an air of pique, and Henderson looked at&#xD;
his friend commiseratingly, as if to say " You've done&#xD;
for yourself, forever !" The other seemed unmoved,&#xD;
however, and preserved the utmost equanimity. There&#xD;
was another roll of the drum; at this signal, Henderson&#xD;
held up a blue ribbon to Miss Foster, who drew from her&#xD;
reticule a crimson cockade with which the ingenious Mr.&#xD;
Jones Barry had provided her. This she fastened to her&#xD;
shoulder, acknowledging her sympathy with the colors&#xD;
of her namesake. Henderson, in another moment, disap-&#xD;
peared, glad to have an excuse, in the~command5 of the&#xD;
lady, for showing off to advantage his equally fine horse&#xD;
and person.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
THE RACE.-~CROSS PURPOSE$~&#xD;
OuR preliminaries 'are all adjusted, and the moment&#xD;
approaches;for. the conflict. The eyes of all' are n&amp;amp;w&#xD;
directed to the central point from which, at the tap of&#xD;
the drum, the 'coiitending horses ~re:to start. The card-&#xD;
players desert their' log beneath ' the shade-trees, the&#xD;
greasy pack being thrust hto the 'pdcket of one of the&#xD;
company till the more immediate object of interest~ is&#xD;
over. The rifle-shooters 'lean' their implements against&#xD;
a tree, a~id seek the common point of attraction.. The&#xD;
cooks leave their seething-vessels; the negroes hurry&#xD;
from their 'horses ;" all parties,' high and 'loW, big and&#xD;
little, crowd upon the track; pressing upon the ropes that&#xD;
guard the little space assigned to the running animals,&#xD;
and crowding absolutely upo~t their heels.' The scenes&#xD;
that we have Witnessed, in a few striking 'instances&#xD;
already, are in: progress on a smaller scale everywhere.&#xD;
Bets are freely offered and taken, now that the' horses&#xD;
are uncovered and in sight. The flrst1anirnal 'that stripped&#xD;
for the 'examination of the judges, was a large horse of&#xD;
Jones Barry's,~ called "Glaucus,"' a great..limbed beasi~,&#xD;
that proniised much more endurance than speed, and yet&#xD;
had the look of' being too heavy to endure his own&#xD;
weight beyond a reasonable distance. 'his. chances lay&#xD;
in the faet that the race in ivhich he 'was to run~was but&#xD;
a singh~ 'mile, and his less were quite' sufficient for that.&#xD;
Yet "' Giancus"' did"'n~t seem much of a favorite.'&#xD;
"An elephant!" cried; one.&#xD;
"'Looks more likes a gin-horse than a race-horse,'~' said&#xD;
another.&#xD;

fleetness. She was, in truth, a very vulgar-lp9king beast,&#xD;
singularly tinmeriting the, appellation of "'Crazy," as&#xD;
no creature could possibly have looked, more tame.. Her&#xD;
hair was coarse, confused,' and rough,, as if shedding;&#xD;
her mane was matted, and an occasional cockle-burr&#xD;
could be seen hanging among the bristles; }ut all these&#xD;
signs were regarded rather as the 'cunning devices of&#xD;

at all indicative of her qualities of speed and 'bottom.&#xD;

contrast which the Mississippi mare presented to the&#xD;

of a shout in her favor. "Graystreak" was the' model&#xD;

but possessed of immense capacit~~ great nmscnlar power,&#xD;

characteristics of high blood, speed, and"great ~endurance.'&#xD;
Her skin was glossy, her eye bright and steady;'and ~he&#xD;
showed, in her: movement, so perfect a union 'of spirit&#xD;
and docility, that you felt, at a glance, that her training&#xD;
had done full justice to her blood. There was no r~sist-&#xD;
ing the impression which she made. Barry himself felt&#xD;
it,but he relied upon the known cunning of Laq Jake&#xD;
Owens, and was confident that still greater merits la~&#xD;
beneath the unkempt, uncomely aspect of "Crazy Kate.'&#xD;
Lazy Jake himself seemed as confident as ever; feeling&#xD;
sure in the private engagentent with Ned Ramsey, 'Which&#xD;

"You have 'now a good view' of the horses that are to&#xD;
run, Miss Foster," wi~is the remark of Hammond, van-&#xD;
turing to arouse the damsel from something like a reverie.&#xD;
"They have already examined them, and weighed the&#xD;
riders. In a few' moments, they will mount and, be~&#xD;
ready for' a start. Suffer me to throw back, the top of&#xD;
your barouche, when you can rise and see the whole ~field&#xD;
at a glance."&#xD;
"Oh! do so, Mr. Hammond, if you please.' Where&#xD;
do you say I shall 'look?" Geraldine eagerly rose as&#xD;
she spoke, and while Hammond threw back the top of&#xD;
the carriage, she scrambled forward upon the seat' beside&#xD;
him, using his shoulder with the utmost indifference'&#xD;
during the proceeding.&#xD;
"Your favorite 'does not run this race, which i~ ~con-&#xD;

"Fine feathers make fine birds, you would say,&#xD;

"Exactly: but this poor beast is carefully disguised&#xD;

"Your 'Ferraunt' excepted?" said the l~idy, slyly.&#xD;
"My 'Ferraunt' probably - excepted," was the. some-&#xD;
what grave reply.&#xD;
"I wish you would run that horse, Mr, Hammond.&#xD;
For my sake you might."'&#xD;
This was said in somewhat lower tones than usual.&#xD;
"For your sake, Miss Foster, I would do much;' but&#xD;
there is a reason-but, hark! they are preparing' for the&#xD;
start. You see that rider with the scarlet jacket. lie&#xD;

You se~ there are several horses in front, with different&#xD;

She adopted th~ suggestion; rose to the prescribed&#xD;
elevation, he keeping his place on the floor of the car-&#xD;
riage, while her hand rested, as if unconsciously,' upon&#xD;
his shoulder. In this manner, shading her eyes with the&#xD;
other hand, 'she directed her gaze upon the points to&#xD;
w~iich he severally drew her attention.&#xD;

at their heels. Soon, however, the position of the parties&#xD;
fluctuated. "Flourish" made a dash, and ~nugher1~ail&#xD;
in the face of "Glaucus ;" "Nabob" went forward till&#xD;
he locked him, and was, in turn, passed by "Crazy&#xD;
Kate ;" the Mississippi mare breezi~ig up with a gradual&#xD;
increase of velocity, evidently under the mo~t adroit&#xD;
management of' rein. "Glaucus" struggled bravely&#xD;
against this new adversary, and made a desperate push,&#xD;
which succeeded in throwing "Flourish and Nabob" out&#xD;
of the lead; but" Crazy Kate" still kept ahead, utEtil&#xD;
her backers began to shout their exultation, when, to&#xD;
their consternation, the Mississippian flared up tinder a&#xD;

and swiftly as an arrow from 'the bow. Sh&amp;amp;' passed the&#xD;
string just a quarter of a length in advance, of :~ Crazy'&#xD;

many links of the same chain, so' equally close did they -&#xD;
maintain their relationship at the termination of' the&#xD;
brush. The other horses were considerably in the rear.&#xD;
The race was to the Mississippian, and the flat&amp;amp; were feel-&#xD;

that what he said was little heeded, he hurried away to,&#xD;

Henderson, some time before., He now took the latter'&#xD;
aside, and said to him.'-&#xD;
"You are too heavy to ride 'Sorella' yourself, .Miles,&#xD;
and can venture little against this 'Mississippi filly. I&#xD;
think that 'Sorella' can heat her in the long ~ but&#xD;
only under a first -rate rider~ Now, do you go over&#xD;
with me to the wagon of old Nathan Whitesides, ~whoxn&#xD;
I see here, and we will get his son, Logan, to ride for&#xD;

THE horses entered were but four in number. Th~s~&#xD;
were, 912~ Mississippian, "Graystreak," "Crazy Kate,"&#xD;
the "Fair Geraldine," and "Sorella." The former was&#xD;
now decidedly the favorite of the field, and odds were&#xD;
given in her behalf. Numerous bets were offered an4&#xD;
taken, arid the excitement on the turf was great, and&#xD;
momently increasing. The "Fair Geraldine" had her&#xD;
backers, and so had "Crazy Kate" anct "Sorella." Bu~&#xD;
the latter was little known among the regular jockeys;&#xD;
and, though a symmetrical and welkshaped animal, there&#xD;
were none of those salient characteristics in her appear-&#xD;
ance which are apt to take the spectator. It was seen&#xD;
that she was fleet; arid that she was rather bony, seemed&#xD;
to promise something for her hardihood. Ned Ramsey&#xD;
noticed her with some anxiety; and the watchful Lazy&#xD;
Jake Owens observed that he had a whisper e~ pas8crnt&#xD;
for the gentlemanly stranger who .had~ so freely taken t~ie&#xD;
offers of Jones Barry. But neither Ramsey nor the&#xD;
stranger declined any banters~ against "Graystreak ;"'&#xD;

hundred more.&#xD;
The examination of the horses showed them off to&#xD;
great advantage. "Graystreak" looked sleek, quiet,&#xD;
and confident, as before. "Sorella" was a meek animal&#xD;
also, with just such a twinkle of the eye as shows that&#xD;
there is no lack of spirit, with all the meekness. But&#xD;
the "Fair Geraldine" stripped to the survey with all the&#xD;
consciousness of a proud and petted beauty. She was&#xD;
restive and bright; a little too anxious and impatient,&#xD;
and carried her head with a toss which was not unworthy&#xD;
of her lovelier namesake. Her appearance compelled&#xD;
the admiration of all; and many were tempted to bet&#xD;
upon her beauty, who did not consider her heels. Her&#xD;
rid~r no*~ was Jones Barry himself. , He was really&#xD;
not satisfied, that Sam Perkins 'had 'not done justice to&#xD;
"Glaucus;" but, whether satisfied or not, nothing could&#xD;
possibly have prevented, him from doing as the Earl of&#xD;

~" Your favorite is ready for the race, Miss Foster!&#xD;

Geraldine, with Some interest.&#xD;
"Yes! I knew that' Sorella' would need every advan-&#xD;
tage in a contest with the Mississippi filly, and that l~Iiles&#xD;
was quite too heavy to run her successfully himself."&#xD;
Unconsciously, 'the girl looked pleased. 'Hamgiond&#xD;
saw the expression, and mused upon it; particularly as&#xD;
a querulous exclamation, at that moment, dropped from&#xD;
the hostile step-mother. But the proceedings of the&#xD;
course drew all eyes thither. All were saddled, the word&#xD;
was given, and away they went, like&#xD;
heroes, into battle.             so many ambitious&#xD;
The start was .a successful one. The four~ horses&#xD;
seemed to jump off together, running side by side. for&#xD;
a while, as if delighting in the line and order of a platoon&#xD;
charge. But soon the "Fair Geraldine" led o1~ taking&#xD;
the track for a quarter of a' mile; "Crazy Kate" laying&#xD;
herself close behind, and "Graystreak" and "Sorelia"&#xD;
seeming to find their amusement in driving the two before&#xD;
them. Before the mile was two-thirds traversed, how-&#xD;
ever, "Crazy Kate" showed symptoms of lagging, and&#xD;
"Sorella" dropped her with a bound, making even' play&#xD;
between the "Mississippian" and the "Fair Geraldine~g'&#xD;
The latter continued well on, not needing any urgency&#xD;
of her rider, until the clattering heels ~of "Soreila"&#xD;
and "Graystreak," ji~st at her haunches, impelled her&#xD;
to an effort. She bridled up at this forwardness, and a&#xD;
slight smack of the whip shocked her into a still more&#xD;
indignant determination to leave all vulgar compsi~nion-&#xD;
ship behind. She went off with a rocket-like impulse,&#xD;
but without obtaining her object. It was now evi~&#xD;
dent that the "Mississippian" was resolved to cut&#xD;
her off from her triumph, and her rider Was seen to&#xD;
apply the thong smartly to her sides. She passed, ac~&#xD;
cordingly, between "Sorella" and the object ~of her am~&#xD;
bition, and the next moment found her, lock a~nd lock, in&#xD;
affectionate embrace with the high-spirited and, aristo-&#xD;
cratic beauty. Yainly did the latter try to shake her off.&#xD;
All her efforts only served to keep the two in this position,&#xD;

a rush between them, and flinging the dust .h~ both their&#xD;

between the lifted heads Qf the two emulous competitors.&#xD;
"Crazy Kate" darted into the allotted 'limits quite in&#xD;
season to saye her distance, having reserved her ~&#xD;
for another brush.&#xD;
Thp race was a beautiful one. Th~. several merit~ of&#xD;
the first three horses were now fully displayed, though&#xD;
the extent of their powers of endurance could only b~&#xD;
conjectured. They 'had evidently 'been ridden with a&#xD;
dQe regard to their qualities; and the ~ompe~titiPn was&#xD;
such as to maintain the excitement of the multitude, and&#xD;
to keep tlie~ in suspense till the very last moment. A&#xD;
~s1~awl night ha1ve ~lapped them at ,several points in the&#xD;
race; and an eli of ribbon might have circled them as&#xD;
they darted 'beneath the string.' It was clear that judg-&#xD;
ments' were to be revised. "Sorella" had been under-&#xD;
v&amp;amp;lued. ' "Crazy Kate" looked better than ever, and&#xD;
her rider s known to be a ~rst-rate jockey; and "Gray-&#xD;
streak" was under the 'teaching of the ve~ry Machiavel of&#xD;
the Georgia ~uf~ The "'Fair Geraldine"i'ad behaved too&#xD;
~han. lsomely to have lost any of her supporters; and,&#xD;
whether "Graystreak" had yielded the heat through&#xD;
policy, or actually lost it in spite 6f all his efforts, was a&#xD;
very doubtful question, even among the knowing ones.&#xD;
There was a whisper that she. seemed to complain in one&#xD;
of her pins; but Tom. Nettles, who examined her closely,&#xD;
made no such discovery. Ned Ramsey showed anxiety,&#xD;
however, and this was seen by "Lazy Jake Owens," aN&#xD;
w~ll as INettles. His personal care of Jiis horse was ex-&#xD;
~rrq4a~ry, ~nd his efforts to enable her to recover and cool&#xD;
off, without effort, were so many studies for the ~youthful&#xD;
~~i~eys whq were crowding about a~d emulous of his re-&#xD;
nown. Jonas Barry was by no means dissatisfied with&#xD;
the 4oings of his mare. She did not seem. uneasy or&#xD;
distre~s~4;'~PQlCd ~ff naturally and 500fl, and was ready&#xD;
fbr the ~econd trial in the shortest possible space. But,&#xD;
&#xD;
to have seen the affectionate care of "Sorella," which&#xD;
was taken by her gypsy rider-how, in addition to the&#xD;
usual stripping and rubbings, he wound his a~xns about&#xD;
her neck, kissed her as if she had been a sweetheart, and&#xD;
whispered all sorts of pleasant nonsense in her ears; axj~id&#xD;
how the filly turned to him with a knowing gesture; and&#xD;
how, when he stooped to rub her legs, her n6se rested.npon&#xD;
~s his shoulders with a sort of human ititerest, which drew&#xD;
~; crowds about the two in unaffected admiration I jtreal-&#xD;
ized, in some degree, the stories that we hear of the&#xD;
Arabian and his favorite steed. Logan Whitesides had&#xD;
first had his ambition lifted by his employment in the&#xD;
ining of "Sorella." She was a first-love to him, and&#xD;
it would have come nigh to break his heart had he' not&#xD;
achieved the victory.&#xD;
'And so 'Sorella' has really won the victory?" said&#xD;
Geraldine to Hammond, as he returned to the ~carriage&#xD;
after a brief interview with Mil~s Henderson.&#xD;
"The heat only-a third of the victory, Miss Foster.&#xD;
They are now preparing fox' the second trial."&#xD;
"You are a witch' in horses, Mr. ilammond.' But&#xD;
pray what did you say in that short whisper which I saw&#xD;
you give to Mr. Henderson and his gypsy boy ?"&#xD;
Hammond laughed as he' replied&#xD;

"I don't understand you-lose!"&#xD;
"That is, not attempt to win, but suWer it to .b~ taken&#xD;

"And why, pray ?"&#xD;
"That her strength in the third heat should not be&#xD;
perilled by an undue effort in the second; when, as most&#xD;
of the other horses will put forth their best ability, she&#xD;
might probably peril herself for nothing."&#xD;
"I see, I see! But why lose to the 'Mississippian?'&#xD;
You say nothing of my namesake !"&#xD;

which grated offensively on th~ ears of the person ad-&#xD;

the p~ep~rati6ns f~r the second heat enabled him to&#xD;
divert the converSatiQfl to a~riothe'r channel. i~t the sig-&#xD;

seat of the carriage, an eager spectator of the 'issue. The&#xD;
word~ was given, and the start was again beautiful; the&#xD;
four steeds seeming to lap each other, whirling &amp;amp;wa~y for&#xD;
a while, in a sort of linked movement, which' showed&#xD;
them all as if locked together in mutual relationship.&#xD;
"Crazy Kate" and "Geraldine" were soon again in the&#xD;
lead, as if by mutual consent between "Sorella" and&#xD;
"G~aysti~eak ;" 'swinging forward by the groups of spec-&#xD;
tators, 'the' wagons audi the tables, east and west, 'as. if&#xD;
waltzing with wings at both feet and shoulders. Merrily&#xD;
did they glide away, leaving a space of thirty feet or&#xD;
more b~twe~n their competitors, who appeared perfectly&#xD;

the ~rst mile and better, they suffered the game to be&#xD;
played by other bands, only piping moderately to the 'uw&#xD;
sic. But soon the "'Mississippian" began t~ grow restive&#xD;
under restraint, and to put forth a much more arnbitiou~&#xD;
leg than he had hitherto shown. He lifted away from&#xD;
"$orella~" and was soon upon the heels of the two ahead.&#xD;
A few bounds enabled him to separate the links between&#xD;
them, and to throw himself 'towards the back stretch of&#xD;
the second mile, between "Crazy Kate" and her i~iir&#xD;
conipetitor. "Sorella" made a similar push forward,&#xD;
and soon overcame the, space ~ihich kept her from the&#xD;
embrace of "Crazy Kate' ;" but' whether it was that the&#xD;
latter was less tempting than the beauty with the beauti~&#xD;
ful name, she did not prolong the te~te-a-t6te with her,,&#xD;
but hurried forward to ~ more select meeting with the&#xD;
"Fair Geraldine;" perhaps it was a feelingof sympathy~&#xD;
which, at this moment, prompted the latter to 'forego h~&#xD;
exertions, and loiter for the coming up' of one who sought&#xD;
her so closely. Meanwhile, the ambitious maid of Mis~&#xD;
sissippi darted ahead of all opponents, and, with so few&#xD;
tokens of civility, as to provoke the emuiou~ efforts of&#xD;
the two nearest riders. Jones Barry w~is seen to apply&#xD;
the whip with unlind severity of hand, to the tender&#xD;
flanks of his favorite; while the gypsy boy who rode&#xD;
"Sorella" appeared to urge her forward with the utmost&#xD;
seeming anxiety, but without the use of any"weap'on. It&#xD;
was now perceived that the "Fair~Geraldine," as if under&#xD;
a feeling of degradation, no longer lifted a hopeful and&#xD;
exulting head, nor tossed pridefully her luxuriant mane.&#xD;
That she began to droop was evident to the spectators,&#xD;
while the repeated' strokes of the lash, from her rider,&#xD;
betrayed his own consciousness of 'a~~ fact which he was&#xD;
quite unwilling to believe. ~These exertions still gave&#xD;
her headway for awhile, but it was, at the expense, of her&#xD;
heels. She gradually relaxed after' 'these efforts, and&#xD;
soon had the fortificationn to fincL" Sorella" quietly work~&#xD;

his game, now looked upon it that she shared the ex-&#xD;
haustion of "geraldine," and were quite deceived by the&#xD;
arts of her rider. Even Ramsey himself counted upon&#xD;
him as a horse "done brown ;" and whispered to Lazy&#xD;
Jake Owens that the race was won. But Lazy Jake was&#xD;
no slouch at an opinion either, in the matter of horse-&#xD;
flesh; ~and he answered, in the common proverb of war-&#xD;
ring in the South: "Don't whoop before you're out of&#xD;
the wood." But this heat was decided. The "Mississip-&#xD;
pian~' had shown the cleanest heels, taking the track from&#xD;
all. It was observed that "Sorella," after once or twice&#xD;
yielding the lead to the "Fair Geraldine," now changed&#xD;
the figure~ entirely, and hastened forward so as to throw&#xD;
herself within a few decent bounds of "Graystreak," as&#xD;
the latter passed in under the string, the final victor of&#xD;
the heat. The native spirit of" Geraldine" did not suffer&#xD;
her to fall behind very far, though it was evident to all&#xD;
good judges that the game with her was u~ for the da~r;&#xD;
while "Crazy Kate" enjoyed to herself the Irishman's&#xD;
fun of driving all the rogues before her. Of the three&#xD;
winning horses, "Sorella" was the only one who hadbeen&#xD;
economized, and the excellence of her jockey enabled&#xD;
her to keep' this important fact a secret.' A couple of'&#xD;
lengths between her and "Graystreak, and twice the&#xD;
number between her and "Geraldine," left the minds of&#xD;
th&amp;amp;miiltitude still in that condition of doubt in regard&#xD;
to ~'the future which makes equally the interest of race&#xD;
and story. The betting parties were still hopeful; for,&#xD;
even where their favorites had not won, they came so&#xD;
near it, with the exception of "Crazy Kate," as to leave&#xD;
nothing certain in the chapter of coming events.&#xD;
Well rubh~ed and' groomed, three' horses showed them-&#xD;
selves for the third' time upon the track. "'Crazy Kate"&#xD;
has withdrawn in dudgeon, in consequence of the mani-&#xD;
fest neglect with which her companions have treated her&#xD;
performances. Her backers have sullenly yielded up&#xD;

while Ramsey, and the unknown gentleman, have been&#xD;
reminding numerous persons of certain fi4~es, tens, t~&amp;amp;n-&#xD;
ties, and hundreds-including our, friend Jones Bar4ry-.-&#xD;
which they unwisely perilled on the heels of .a fem~nin~&#xD;
creature avowedly non eompo8. This pleasant little&#xD;
episode greatly relieved th~ otherwise tedious interval&#xD;
between the second and the last heat. The "Fair Gerald-&#xD;
ine" seemed to have recovered her fQrrner spirits, as she&#xD;
came once more upon the turf; and, with the word "Ge,"&#xD;
she led oW, "solitary and alone," as she had been&#xD;
ambitious to do on all previous occasions. But, &amp;amp;fte~i'&#xD;
the first half mile, both the "Mississippian" and "3orella"&#xD;
seemed disposed to make play., and to show that both&#xD;
had heels of wing and steam when the exigency was&#xD;
at hand. It was clear, however, that the two latter&#xD;
waited for each other. They knew the real adversary,&#xD;
and knew exactly when to terminate that deference for&#xD;
the beauty who now led them which, it was evid&#xD;
had yielded r4laer througE policy than   ent, they&#xD;
admiration~ A8&#xD;
the first mile was overcome, they gradually swalloy~red&#xD;
space, taking the wind completely out of the sails of&#xD;
"Geraldine," passing On each side of her, and closing&#xD;
up,, as if an~i~us for the track. Barry at once put on&#xD;
steam with a heavy hand, but no application to the&#xD;
flanks, in the case of one so tender, could possThly fur-&#xD;
nish the legs with the proper facility for fligiw. The&#xD;
beauty wanted age for endurance. "Send me no more&#xD;
boys," said Napoleon to the government at home: "they&#xD;
only fill the hospitals."' The tender years of" Gerald-&#xD;
me," her delicate training, were adverse to her soldier-&#xD;
ship. Fan~ous at a charge, she cou1~d not stand the&#xD;
campaign. The two veterans, better fortified by muscle&#xD;
and training, of better bottom and not less speed, soon&#xD;
forged ahead, and left her painfully to struggle up the&#xD;
hill alone. "Graystreak" was evidently girdling up&#xD;
her loins for the last great effort. She felt the necessity&#xD;
of putting all her soul into her heels, as she felt that ~she&#xD;
had a sterling customer beside her, one who took a deep&#xD;

shot, and, loved long reckonings. There were bone, and&#xD;
muscle, and speed, to be overcome, and she had a pride&#xD;
and reputation at stake, to say nothing of the hundreds&#xD;
which our friend Jones Barry no doubt found cool' enough&#xD;
by this time. There was evident mischief in the "Missis-&#xD;
rnppian." Her rider glared round, in his whit~ uniform,&#xD;
at the queer little gypsy rogue who kept tenaciously&#xD;
with him, neck and neck, as if measuring their mutual&#xD;
strength for the last great struggle. It was neck or&#xD;
nothing with them both. Both were resolute to do, or&#xD;
die. The gypsy rogue seemed to crouch, at moments,&#xD;
in his saddle, as if to take the leap of a cougar on the&#xD;
fox, and his heels would sink slightly into the sides of&#xD;
his creature, as if embracing her with a love which found&#xD;
all its pleasures in hers. Side and side they rode, un-&#xD;
til, in the eyes of the distant spectators, they seemed to&#xD;
resolve themselves into a single man 'and horse. The&#xD;
struggle was desperately close. It was your purse or&#xD;
mine, as they darted eagerly towards the last quarter&#xD;
stretch, leaving the wind behind them, and seeming' to&#xD;
whiz along through air, as a bullet from the cannon.&#xD;
"The bravest held his breath for a time." The multi-&#xD;
tude pressed forward along the track. Mouths were&#xD;
open wide with expectation; eyes dilating beyond their&#xD;
orbs, with' delight and anxiety.&#xD;
"How beautiful 1" exclaimed Geraldine Foster, as she&#xD;
grasped the arm' of Hammond.&#xD;
"Beautiful!" said Hammond, naturally enough, as&#xD;
he gazed into her eyes. We dare not look with him while&#xD;
the struggle is thus at its height. The jockey on "Gray-&#xD;
streak" now made tremendous efforts; his eye fixed on&#xD;
the stubborn little, gypsy, a~ if to note the opening for&#xD;
an advantage. Neck and neck they still clung together,&#xD;
and but a few more bounds were necessary to the final&#xD;
~chievemei~t~ "Wliitejacket" gathered himself up for the&#xD;
last~issue, and, rising in his stirrups, with the whip keen-&#xD;
ly and rapidly administered, he raised the head of&#xD;
"Graystreak" for the final bound beneath' the line.,&#xD;
But "Nojacket," our little gypsy, knew'his moment 'also.&#xD;
&#xD;
He gave no whip; he rose' not in the saddle; but ciouch-&#xD;
ing, rather, and clinging upon her neck, he whispered a&#xD;
word, a single word, in the ear of "Sorella," and the&#xD;
noble Arabian went out of the lock in a way to make&#xD;
an arrow wonder. By a single head, she passed ahead&#xD;
of her resolute competitor; and, as her ~triumph was be-&#xD;
held, the big, swollen heart of the multitude relieved&#xD;
itself by a shout that shook the field. Then our gypsy..&#xD;
jockey dropped from his creature, and seized her about&#xD;
the neck, kissing her once more as passionately as the&#xD;
lover, for the first time successful. He felt the triumph&#xD;
as much more precious than he did the "cool. hundred,"&#xD;
one of the several that had been transferred on this oc-&#xD;
casion from the pockets of the wealthy J7ones Barry to&#xD;
those of other people, with which' Miles' Henderson&#xD;
rewarded him for his riding. Then might the multitude'&#xD;
be seen following, the horses-horse and rider-with ex-&#xD;
ultation and 'admiration. Our gypsy' was, next to his&#xD;
horse, the wonder of the field. The' boys scampered&#xD;
after him as their hero, while the negroes, everywhere&#xD;
exclaiming as he came, pointed him out to their grinning&#xD;
companions, as "Dat little Login Whitesides; da's a&#xD;
debjAe hese'f~, for ride !" Glory is a thing of 'various&#xD;
complexions; and our little friend Logan 'was quite as&#xD;
well satisfied, no doubt, with the negro form of compli..'&#xD;
ment, as with that which issued in rounded periods from&#xD;
more polished lips. Let us now look to other parties.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE GANDER TOURNAMENT.&#xD;
THE. exc~ilent lady, Mrs. Foster, was quite dissatisfied&#xD;
at the result of the race.' Perhaps she might have been&#xD;
still more so, had the victory been obtained by" Fer-&#xD;
'raunt," instead of "Sorella;" by the horse of Hammond&#xD;
in place of' that of his friend. She did not conceal her&#xD;
mortifi-cation, which vented itself in expressions of strong&#xD;
sympathy with Jones Barry, even in the presence of his&#xD;
conqueror. 'He, however, either was, or affected to be,&#xD;
wholly indifferent to the result. He had. various excuses&#xD;
for the defeat,' which he could- ascribe to any and every-&#xD;
thii~g, always excepting his mare's ability and his own&#xD;
riding.&#xD;
" I'll go you a thousand any day, Miles Henderson,&#xD;
on 'Geraldine,' against 'Sorella.' I know what- 'my&#xD;
mare can do. But she wasn't groomed properly. That&#xD;
little rascal Sam Perkins would give her w~t~r, though&#xD;
I told him not; and lie girt her ~n so tightly, that the&#xD;
poor thing could hardly draw a decent breath."&#xD;
"And you're a little too heavy for your mare, Barry,"&#xD;
added Nettles; 'who, having pocketed a clever share of&#xD;
the money of the other, could afford to do the amiable.&#xD;
"There's something in that," was the admission of&#xD;
- Barry. "2But, Tom, didn't I ride her beautiful ?"&#xD;
"You can ride," was the liberal acknowledgment of&#xD;
the other, with just the sort of emphasis and look, in&#xD;
the right place, to render the admission satisfactory.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Henderson and Hammond had both been&#xD;
conversing with the' ladies; though the latter could not&#xD;
but perceive that Geraldine manifested, in his case,&#xD;
a more than usual degree of reserve and distance. He&#xD;

"It's true, by the pipers! here's the advertisement;&#xD;

These two worthies at ~on~e proceeded with proper&#xD;

Barry employed, as the rider of "Glaucus," the' little&#xD;
gypsy, who had lifted "Sorella" so handsomely over&#xD;
the track ~ and the result was an improvement in the&#xD;

those who are more perfect in the history of the stud.&#xD;
It is enough that we say that the day continued one of&#xD;
.great excitement to the close. Some small winnii~gs, at&#xD;
the winding up, served somewhat to consoTh Barry for&#xD;
his heavier losses; and he ~was rendered particularly&#xD;
happy, as Torn Nettles introduced him to a 'couple&#xD;
of the chief men of the circus, by 'whom he was in-&#xD;
vited into the hippodrome itself, and permitted, while&#xD;
yet the' day lasted, to behold the vacant scene upon&#xD;

was destined so shortly to swallow his own head might&#xD;
very naturally desire tohave all the interval to himself,&#xD;
that he might~ prepare himself for the' impending ~atas-&#xD;
trophe. 'Here, ~a table being spread e~tempore, some&#xD;
cold baked meats were brought forth from a' curtained&#xD;
interior; and, with the help of a ham and a loaf, iyhich&#xD;
Nettles gathered from the booths of on'e of his acquaint-&#xD;
ance, and a stout quart-decanter of' French brandy,&#xD;
which the equestrians h~d brought with them, Jones&#xD;
Barry was very soon 'reconciled to the absence of the&#xD;

ladies. The decanter was soon emptied and repler~isl~ed,&#xD;
and thisin time disappearing, the place was occupied&#xD;
by a couple of bottles of tolerable wino. Nettles was&#xD;
fond of strong drink, but he bad oni~ of those indurated&#xD;
heads which could bear* any degree of soaking without&#xD;
betraying their owners. Jones I3arry was much less of&#xD;
~t veteran, :though he loved good liquors, after a gentle-&#xD;
manly fashion. J~nough, however, that, before he left&#xD;
the table, he had become c4ptious and somewhat unruly;&#xD;
and it was only by adroit management that Nettles&#xD;
could conduct him' out of 'the taberuade, so ~as to afford&#xD;
to the manager an opportunity for preparing for the&#xD;
performance of the nights In the open air, Barry was&#xD;
more manageable, though it required an additional 'sup~&#xD;
ply of stimulus to keep his stomach from entire suhjii-.&#xD;
gaiion to the hostile power which he had thrown into&#xD;
the territory. Nettles was not unwilling to indulge&#xD;
him.' lie was a fellow of fun, and found his capital in&#xD;
this excellent subject. He had set out to enjoy a spree,&#xD;
and he was resolved to make a night of it. An hour's&#xD;
wandering about the encampment, f~r such had ~he race-&#xD;
course at ilillabee become for the occasion, and there&#xD;
were a thousand ways for getting up and' letting off&#xD;
steam, to employ the slang phraseology, of the region.&#xD;
Wagons were to be upset, drunk en men stripped, the tails&#xD;
and manes of horses cropped; these, with other practices,&#xD;
in which the humorists were quite as "rough as ready,"&#xD;
'servedtobeguiletheinterval between thecloseofthe'&#xD;
race and the opening of the circus. But it wa~ the&#xD;
fortune of Jones Barry to make himself conspicuous.&#xD;
in a more important enterprise. The wanderings of our&#xD;
companions in search of adventures led them, with a&#xD;
crowd of otjiers, to an amphitheatre, 4out three hun-&#xD;
dred yards from the race-course, where they witnessed&#xD;

less you, contrive some process for making him a gentle-&#xD;
man; and there is no question but that,, as he has a&#xD;
natural appetite for recreation and pleasure, if you do&#xD;
not contrive for him such as will not be unacceptable to&#xD;
the Deity, the devil ~will m6re liberally provide with&#xD;
such as will make the man acceptable only to himself.&#xD;
aander-pulling, accordingly, is one of those sports&#xD;
which a cunning devil has contrived to gratify a human&#xD;
beast It appeals to his skill, his agility, and strength;&#xD;
and is therefore in some degree grateful to his pride:&#xD;
but, as it exercises these qualities at the expense of his&#xD;
humanity, it is only a medium by which his better qua-&#xD;
lities are employed a~ agents for his worser nature.&#xD;
Gander-pulling has been described as a sort of tourna-&#xD;
ment on~ horseback; the only difference is that the&#xD;
knight has a goose for his opponent, instead of a per-&#xD;
son like himself. The man is mounted on horseback,&#xD;
while the goose is mounted 'upon poles. ~These poles,&#xD;
or saplings, are thrust firmly~ into the ground, some&#xD;
twelve feet apart; but they are united' by a cord at the&#xD;
top, which hangs loosely; while, pendent from the ex-&#xD;
tremity, the living gander is fastened by the legs.&#xD;
Here he swings his head; hanging downwards just above&#xD;
the path, 'between the two~ saplings, and just high&#xD;
enough to be within ~reach of the man on horseback.&#xD;
The achievement of the rider is to run his horse; at fall&#xD;
sj~'eed, at the 'bird, and, gr~spi~g~ him by the neck, to&#xD;
wring his hea4 off as he passes on~ This is not so easy&#xD;
a performance. The neck of the' gander has been pre-&#xD;
viously stripped of; all its feathers, and has then been&#xD;
thickly coated with grease or oil. Nothing can be made&#xD;
~moro slippery; and, shining and warming in the sun,&#xD;
the glitterhig ~neck of the unhappy bird looks like that&#xD;
of a young boa, for the first ~time practising from the&#xD;

two hundred feet in 'diameter; which circuit the~ rider&#xD;
must necessarily make before reaching the goose, 'st~rt-&#xD;

He is not a post which is properly watched by judges.&#xD;

in twenty yards of the game. ' Thus guarded, the vic-&#xD;
tim is not so easily decapitated. It is only the expe-&#xD;
rienced horseman, and the experienced sportsman, who&#xD;
can possibly succeed in the endeavor. Young beginners,&#xD;
who look on the achievement as rather easy, are con-&#xD;
stantly baffled; many find it 'impossible to keep' the&#xD;
track; many lose the saddle, and, even where they suc-&#xD;
ceed in passing beneath the saplings' without disaster,&#xD;
they either fail altogether in grasping the goose, which&#xD;
'keeps a constant fluttering and screaming; or, they find&#xD;
it impossible to retain 'their grasp, at full speed, 'upon&#xD;
the greasy and eel-like neck and head which they have&#xD;
seized. Meantime, their failure is by no means sauce&#xD;
for the gander. 'The tug,. from which he at 'length&#xD;
escapes, makes him feel excessively uncomfortable while&#xD;
it lasts. The oil without does not protect him' from~ se-&#xD;
vere sore-throat within. ' His voice becomes hoarse, with&#xD;
screaming; and, long before his head is fairly off, he&#xD;
has lost those nicer sensibilities which teach him exactly&#xD;
how the event took place. The beating and bolting; ~f&#xD;
the horses, the emptying of the saddles, the failures of&#xD;
the pullerss," the 'screams, and wild wixrg-flapping of&#xD;
the bird-these constitute the glory of the entertain-&#xD;
ment; every point in the ~tilting being watched with&#xD;
eager anxiety, and announced' with screams and yells&#xD;
from the multitude, which form no bad echoes to the&#xD;
cries of the' goose.&#xD;

time in~ progress, when Nettles and Jones Barry drew&#xD;
i~igh. The moment the latter beheld the scene, he at&#xD;
once declared himself the man to. take the gander's head.&#xD;
Nettles w~ very far from discouraging him from an ad-~&#xD;
venture which promised fun; the more particularly as&#xD;
his .companion, if not absolutely drunk, was, as they&#xD;
phrase it in Mississippi, "in a state of betweenity,' 'i. e.&#xD;
neither drimk nor sober. A dozen had already tried&#xD;
their hands~ without success; but, evidently, to the per-&#xD;
fect disquiet of the gander. There he swung aloft; his&#xD;
wings flapping furiously at intervals, and., every now&#xD;
and then, his throat pouring forth a sharp sudden scream,&#xD;
the nioment he become conscious of a horse in motion.&#xD;
Barry fixed his eyes upon the shining neck, and shook&#xD;
his hands at the bird, the fingers spreading out, like&#xD;
claws as lie pried to the victim: "Here's the claws&#xD;
that'lJ have you off~ my beauty! You're shining there&#xD;
for me! Who goes a JZ" against Jones Barry? Who, I&#xD;
say? ]iiet him show himself, and be -&#xD;
It is to the credit of Nettles that, though willing to&#xD;
see the fun, he would not suffer his companion to be&#xD;
fleeced. He interposed, that his bets should be trifles&#xD;
only, though, in this friendly interposition, he incurred&#xD;
the deni~nei~tions of the person whom he saved. Al-&#xD;
ready had he paid for his "matriculation," and little&#xD;
Logan White~ides was dispatched for "Glaucus ;" for,&#xD;
though fuddled, Barry was not prepared to employ the&#xD;
"Fair Geraldine," his favorite, for such ignohie pur-&#xD;
poses.&#xD;
"iLurrah for Jones Barry," said Ben Burg; "lie&#xD;
ain't tQo proud to jin~ in the pleasures of the poor&#xD;
man!'~'&#xD;
"Lt'e's jest drunk enough for any sort of pleasure,&#xD;
poor ar rich," was the comment of Lazy ~Jake Owens.&#xD;
"I'll lay you a quarter, Jake," said Burg, "that&#xD;
he'll take the, gander."&#xD;
"That'll be because he's near kin to him, then."&#xD;
"If he do~," said a third, "it'll be owing to his,&#xD;
liquor, lie couldn't do it sober."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Shall we go a quarter on him ?" said Burg'; a con-&#xD;
scientious feeling prompting him to vindicate, to this&#xD;
extent, the ability of a person from whom he had con-&#xD;
trived to borrow a couple of half eagles but a few hours&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"Make it a half'~, Burg."&#xD;
"D~o-n-e !" said the latter, ~rather slowly.&#xD;
The vulgar look with respect, even while they sneer,&#xD;
at the doings of those above them in 'fortune or position.&#xD;
It was the fortune of Jones Barry to provoke a sensa-&#xD;
tion always among this clasr~ of people. They watdied&#xD;
and waited his movements. ,The gander obtained a&#xD;
brief respite, while the boy went for "Glaueus".-..&#xD;
settled down into, a droopii~g quiet, and hushed for a&#xD;
period his screams. Our sprightly little gypsy was&#xD;
not long before appearing with the horse. He was&#xD;
ready saddled and bridled for the heat, and' it was with&#xD;
more ambition than agility that our hero contrived to&#xD;
vault into' the seat. Then it wa~ that the uproar grew.&#xD;
~" Hurrah for Barry !" cried Nettles, at the top of his&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"Who goes a picayune against'Barry ?"&#xD;
"Done, with you, 'Squire Nettles."&#xD;
"And here's another! lie's no niore the chap to take&#xD;
off a gander's head than I am to put 'it on."&#xD;
"Hurrah for .Lhe captain !" cried Burg.'&#xD;
"You may hurrah till your throat aches, but that&#xD;
goose will never catch that gander," was the unseemly&#xD;
echo of Lazy sake Owi~ns.&#xD;
A hundred 'voices joined in tlie s~iouting. The boys&#xD;
rolled, and roared, and tumbled, throwing the dust up&#xD;
fifty fee.t in air, as the knight of the goose prepared&#xD;
to make his passage at arms. The men with the flails&#xD;
did not need to use their hickories. J3arry came~ on at&#xD;
full speed, and, amidst shouts of congratulation, he kept&#xD;
his horse steadfast along the track, aiid through the sap~&#xD;
lings, from whose united tops the gander was suspended.&#xD;
The bird flounced and shrieked, flapping hi~ wingss With&#xD;
immense violence. Barry, dropping his bridle in 'his&#xD;

horse passed instantly from under him, and, for a mo-&#xD;
zuant, he hung in air, the wings of ~the gander playing&#xD;
the devil's tattoo rather rapidly upon his face, breast,&#xD;
and shoulders. It was but for an instant, hoWever. The&#xD;
cord, calculated to sustainn one goose only, broke under&#xD;
de4de weight, and down came the pair together, the&#xD;

The gan&amp;amp;er had revenged himself on our luckless&#xD;

his wings had been busy, from the first moment of their&#xD;
encounter and fall, to that when the parties were sepa-&#xD;
rated, and chiefly upon the face of our hero. iRis cheeks&#xD;
were scraped rather than scratched; his nose and mouth&#xD;
were bleeding. his ~shirt bosom was equally. torn and&#xD;
soiled, and his hair was lifted in as much disorder as&#xD;
was Job's when he beheld the vision of the night.&#xD;

while little T~ogan Whitesides ran after and recovered&#xD;

"No,~ I think not," said he. "Goose, eh! Nettl~s;&#xD;

quential reply; in which, however, Kettles detected the&#xD;
latent meaning.&#xD;
"Yes," said he, "and ate very heartily, both of us;&#xD;
why should we want the goose ?"&#xD;
"Shall we go, Tom'?" asked Barry, sobering by de~&#xD;
grees, and feeling rather shain4a~ced.&#xD;
"No !" said the other ; "here's Meredith's wagon.&#xD;
He keeps good liquor; we'll take a consoler" And they&#xD;
went aside together to the wagon, where they both ob-&#xD;
tained an apple~toddy~ the saccharine pr6peii~ty being&#xD;
derived from the best mountain honey, while the apple~&#xD;
brandy was as good as ever filled up the corn~rows. ~,t&#xD;

and the two returned, to the gander-tournament together.&#xD;
The game was already resumed and in full blast. Three&#xD;
or four assailants had been baffled. IRut they usnailly&#xD;
came up a second and a third time to the scratch. The&#xD;
only discouraging circumstance which finally arrested&#xD;
their efforts being the repeated. charges for new entries.&#xD;
Th~e gander Was on~ of fortunate fates; his owner was&#xD;
delighted to perceive that the.. instincts of the bii4d&#xD;
enabled him to a~~icipate the moment of danger,. and to&#xD;
exercise his most rapid movements, j~i~t as the grasp&#xD;
was made upon his neck. He eluded several fingers;&#xD;
but some clutched him,. and the "scrag" paid severely&#xD;
from the jerk which followed, ev~n though it finally&#xD;
slipped from the gripe of the enemy. But Ins voice&#xD;
was suffering, and his action was greatly diminiske4~&#xD;
It was then that Kettles found himself plucked by the&#xD;

off that head thar, ef 'twas never done afore."&#xD;
Nettles found it no ditlicult matter to persuade Barry,&#xD;
and almost the next assailant of the goose was our&#xD;
urchin. lie certainly looked less like one to "ease off&#xD;
the head" than those who had 'preceded~ him. He&#xD;
was the smallest of all the adventurers; rode squat, with&#xD;
a stoop, doubling up. like a frog or monkey on the leap.&#xD;
But if he lacked in size, he was possessed of rare agili-&#xD;
ty. He was all wire and 'spring; and, a Thot not gene-~&#xD;
rally known, he had been trained to the sport in another&#xD;
county, and when much younger. His ability in riding&#xD;
we have 'already seen. Nettles was a ju~lge of boys as&#xD;

"I'll. do that same," cried Lazy Jake Owens, and&#xD;
there were other customers for similar amounts. Net-&#xD;
tles soon found that he had nearly a hundred. upon the&#xD;
fate of the gander. It was not long in suspense.&#xD;
Go ahead, Logan 1" was the cry of Nettles.&#xD;
The boy obeyed him. The '.boys rushed after their&#xD;
hero with a shout. He himself shouted, and the de-&#xD;
scending flails of the men of hickory scarcely grazed&#xD;
the haunches of the fleetly-hurrying "Glaucus." In a&#xD;
moment, he had reached the foot of the scaffolding from&#xD;
the top.. of which hung ~the victim. The bird uttered&#xD;
tremendous screams, and flapped his wings wide and&#xD;
heavily. Then' could the gypsy boy b&amp;amp;seen to crouch,&#xD;

head, windpipe, and all of the gander but his body;-&#xD;
the segregated throat continuing -to pour scream upon&#xD;

the bird in triumph over his own. The field shook with&#xD;
the uproar of it~ejoicing, and little Logan Whitesides pro-&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
HOW THE HERO OF THE CIRCUS MAY SWALLOW HIS OWN&#xD;
OR HIS NEIGHBOR'S HEAD.&#xD;
- ALTOGETHER, the events. of* the day had not tended&#xD;
to soothe. the humors nor satisfy the self-esteem of Mr.&#xD;
Jones Barry. The 'first excitement over, by which&#xD;
even the defeated may be temporarily sustained, he&#xD;
began to reflect~ upon his losses. His favorite mare had&#xD;
been discredited; and though "Glaucus" had retrieved in&#xD;
the sweepstakes the honor which he might have been&#xD;
supposed to have forfeited in the first races, * this&#xD;
could in no respect compensate for the defeat of the&#xD;
' Fair Geraldine," coupled as was this defeat with the&#xD;
loss of several "cool hundreds." It was in due degree&#xD;
with the increasing soberness of Barry, that he began&#xD;
thus moodily, to meditate events. The conflict with the&#xD;
gander, which had left him with a head and neck quite&#xD;
as sore as his moral feelings, had somewhat subdued his&#xD;
vanity; and he really began to think, as people had&#xD;
long since begun to say, behind his back, that he had&#xD;
been making a great fool of himself. Reflections such as&#xD;
these, were they allowed to continue, would probably&#xD;
almost always result in the improvement of the indi-&#xD;
vidual. But, in the case of weak persons, who have been&#xD;
Nacdustomed to avoid and escape such reflections, and&#xD;
whom fortune and circumstances enable to do so, ~t is&#xD;
scarcely possible for such a mood of mind to continue long.&#xD;
There are always some good-natured friends in every&#xD;
fooPs circle, to 'assist in keeping him a fool; and, by&#xD;
interposing at moments when self-esteem is beginning&#xD;
to be rightly humbled, they succeed in silencing the&#xD;
officious monitor, either by well'.sugared falsehoods and&#xD;
&#xD;
specious flatteries, or by doing what, our excellent sports..&#xD;
man, Tom Nettles, conceived it proper for him to do on&#xD;
the present occasion.~ He saw, as the effects of theapple-&#xD;
toddy subsided, that Jones Barry was about to sink into&#xD;
sullenness, which he regarded as a sort Of stupidity; and&#xD;
he knew but one specific in all such cases, and that&#xD;
Was to repeat the dose which had been found already&#xD;
so effectual; they stopped, accordingly, at a wagon on&#xD;
which they saw co&#xD;
barrel and were nspicuous a pine sa;pling above a&#xD;
soon gratified with the beverage they&#xD;
sought. The spirits of Barry rose with the draught.&#xD;
The effect was so pleasant that another was called for,&#xD;
and, by the time that the two had reached the entrance&#xD;
of the hippodrome, our brave gander-puller avowed&#xD;
himself as expert a rider on double horses as any fellow&#xD;
in the circus.&#xD;
"It's true I've never seen 'em,, Tom," said he, "but&#xD;
I've heard of them often enough. Joe Smith used to&#xD;
tell me of what he'd seen in Savannah and Augusta.&#xD;
Now, Joe used to say of my riding, I was fit to be ii~&#xD;
the circus. For a cool hundred now, I'd ride against&#xD;
the crack fellow of this company, who, I suppose, is7 n~&#xD;
great shakes, and by -, if they~ give me a chance&#xD;
to-night, I'll challenge the whole kit and boiling 6f&#xD;
em.&#xD;
"Oh, you be k-----d, Barry," said the other, irre~re-&#xD;
rently: "you are the greatest brag I ever heard. Ib@&#xD;
yourself alone, and don't be trying to be everything.&#xD;
You're quite enough as you are. You are a good-look-&#xD;
ing little fellow."&#xD;
"Little !". exclaimed Barry: "By gracious, Nettles,&#xD;
I'm as good a man as you are, any day."&#xD;
"So you are, but not as big !"&#xD;
"Little! But I don't suppose you' meant any insult,&#xD;
Nettles, for you said 'good-looking too.'"&#xD;
"So I did! :1 say; you're a devilish good-looking&#xD;
little fellow; you're rich; and have everything you&#xD;
Want. You can ride, though you~'~e, quite too heavy&#xD;
for 'Geraldine.'&#xD;

"Yes, little and not light. You see, you're a sort&#xD;

"You're iiiighty plain spoken, Tom."&#xD;
"Why yes; friends have a privilege, you know."&#xD;
".0 yes-fo be sure; but look you, Torn, I feel mon-&#xD;
strous like licking the best friend in the world, when he&#xD;

"Well, you don't lick me, for two' reasons; the first is,&#xD;
that I won't let you, and the next is, that you won't let&#xD;

"Agreed," said the other; and, as they rolled over&#xD;
to the opposite side of the road, amid a confused assem~&#xD;
blage of carts, carriages, and wagons, the unsteady&#xD;
gait of Barry showed but too certainly that the apple-&#xD;
toddy had been already too potent for his perpendicu-&#xD;
lar.&#xD;
"Ride!" said he. "By gracious, Tom, I could strad-&#xD;
dle a barrel of peach, and make it streak away as fast&#xD;
as them circus fellows make their horses."&#xD;
~Humph! If you go on at this rate, your swallow&#xD;
will be as good as the clown's, who means to take in his&#xD;

"The apple, then, witha bed of honey for it to dream&#xD;

liquors, if I can help it."&#xD;
"What!" cried the other, with a grin; "afraid!&#xD;
&#xD;
Tom Nettles; afraid of two liquors! h{alloo ! 'there, old&#xD;

peach and apple; who's afraid? Equal parts, old still,&#xD;
and no slow charcoal dropping. Ease my eye, quickly;&#xD;
it's strained by the heavy sunshine."&#xD;
Barry was becoming pleasantly perverse, and was&#xD;
in the very humor for all sorts of cross purposes.&#xD;
When conducted with some difficulty by hi~ friend,&#xD;
they entered the amphitheatre where they had' taken&#xD;
their dinner that day. The scene was now changed as&#xD;
if by magic. The place was thoroughly lighted, a per-&#xD;
fect\ blaze of splendor, which showed, conspicuously&#xD;
clear, the remotest parts of th~ pavilion. The~ seats,.&#xD;
which encircled three-fourths of the area, were o~ceupied&#xD;
almost entirely. Our two friends were compelled to&#xD;
take places on the lowest bench, and within a foot of&#xD;
the small rim of earth which had been heaped up around&#xD;
the ring, rather as a mark than a barrier. There w~s&#xD;
no fence to keep the spectators from. the track, and to&#xD;
check the erring vaultings of a. vicious horse 'and an&#xD;
inferior rider. The seats were divided into two great&#xD;
and equal sections, one assigned to the whites and the&#xD;
other to the blacks. They were raised' (a rude scaffolding&#xD;
of plank) to the 'very eVes of the tent, and the heads of&#xD;
the visitors were in close neighborhood with the shaking&#xD;
canvas., Hundreds of showy damsels, with ribbons&#xD;
and feathers flying, might be seen, all impatience and&#xD;
'sunny smiles, their several gallants being eager in d&amp;amp;&#xD;
scribing what they knew, and what they anticipated.&#xD;
Many of these had come, a great distance to. the sports&#xD;
of ilillabee; as, in ancient times, they flocked to the&#xD;
amusements of the tournament; and for the same rea~&#xD;
Son, the equal desire for recreation and niwelty, and&#xD;
the want of great cities, which afford these habitually.&#xD;
The dress circle was ~tninently well filled. The girls&#xD;
and boys had crowded in from all parts of the country.&#xD;
Ancient ladies, who had heard vague tidings of the cir-&#xD;

their youthful days, came hither to revive old memories,&#xD;

The farmer was 'curious to see the reality of those spec-&#xD;
tacles of which great pictures had already been made&#xD;
to ack~rn. his hamlet, and jockeys naturally came wher-&#xD;

Tom Nettles made their appearance, and scrambled to&#xD;

comical fellow, the clown. '~' Buried in a grotesque and&#xD;
monstrous Egyptian mask, hi§ face thoroughly concealed~&#xD;
and so artfully that its location could not exactly be de~&#xD;

and Eollow apartment below the ground. JLLis antics&#xD;
were~ inaescribable. His jugglery albne must demand&#xD;
our attention, asit somewhat involved one of our acquaint-&#xD;
ance. 'It happened that the scene required our clown&#xD;
to' take wine with an African magician. He was me-&#xD;
mently expecting him, and he was proceeding to show&#xD;

finally "swallow his soul."&#xD;

like to ~try it ?" said he, and he very courteously pre-&#xD;
sented it to our two friends. Barry saw, as he fancied,&#xD;
some of the fine cognac of which he had partaken freely&#xD;
in that very place, on that very day; and, being exceed.&#xD;
ingly thirsty, he innocently and incontinently ex-&#xD;
claimed-&#xD;
"I don't care if I do-thank you !" Speaking thus,'&#xD;
he rose and put forth his hand; but, by an adroit move-&#xD;
ment, throwing the long bunch of streamers- from his&#xD;
fool's cap full in the face of our hero, the clown gulped&#xD;
down the beverage himself, exclaiming-&#xD;
"Perhaps you'll wait till you can get it !"&#xD;
The audience roared with delight. Furious~ at his&#xD;
disappointment, and the ridiculous figure 'which he cut,&#xD;
Bari"y at once mounted the clown; and, at the first&#xD;
grasp, tore away what seemed to be the entire head and&#xD;
neek of the unfortunate jester. With this terrible evi-&#xD;
dence in his clutches, he looked around him aghast,&#xD;
scarcely daring to guess the extent of 'his achievement.&#xD;
The clown, meanwhile, had retreated at the first 'assault,&#xD;
and before Barry could recover his wits and equilibrium,&#xD;
for he' could not well anticipate a renewal of the conflict&#xD;
from one whose entire caput he carried in his hand, the&#xD;
mountebank, squatting low, darted between the legs of&#xD;
our hero; who had,' in some measure, straddled the little.&#xD;
circuit of earth by which the ring was circumscribed.&#xD;
The face of Barry was to the audience, and the' ass~u1t&#xD;
of the clown surprised him. lie was lifted from his feet&#xD;
before he apprehended danger; a~d his assailant, rising&#xD;
under hi~ burden, which he did not seem 'to feel, trotted&#xD;
with him quite 'across the arena. Barry 'was thus. car-&#xD;
ried forward horizontally, his head addressh~g the white,&#xD;
and his heels the negro portion, of the assembly.&#xD;
"Tom, Nettles-Tom !" was all that the poor fellow&#xD;

could articulate, but he screamed and kicked tremen-&#xD;
dously. 'His efforts were wasted on the air. The clown&#xD;
had only attained his great flexibility by exercises which&#xD;
had imparted~ thd, most wonderful power to his muscles,&#xD;
and' Barry was but a child in his grasp. His 'struggle&#xD;
only increased the fun. The audience shrieked and&#xD;
howled with delight, in proportion to the futile efforts of&#xD;
the captive ; and when they beheld the captor hurry&#xD;
with his prey to the negro side of the house, and saw&#xD;
him pitch the unfortunate gentleman headlong into the&#xD;
arms of a great fat negro wench, one of the most enor-&#xD;
ineus in the assembly, who sat trickling with oleaginous&#xD;
sWeat, 'on the third tier, one would have thought the&#xD;
whole pavilion would have come down with the delirious&#xD;
shouts of the multitude.&#xD;
"Here's an abolitionist for you, mother Possum-fat !"&#xD;
cried the clown, as he plumped poor Barry into her&#xD;
embrace.&#xD;
"1 no want 'em I" cried the woman, shuffling herself&#xD;
free from the burden. Barry, rolling out of her lap, con-&#xD;
tinued to roll down the successiVe tiers, until h~ came&#xD;
plump into the soft bed of sand and sawdust, which had&#xD;
been prepared for a very different animal. Furious with&#xD;
rage, h~ rose to his feet, and, seizing a pole with which&#xD;
one of the equestrians had been balanciyig, he darted&#xD;
headlong at the offending clown.&#xD;
"Hurrah, red-jacket! Hurrah, clQwn !" were the&#xD;
several cries of the audience. "Hurrah, Captain !"&#xD;
was the more cordial shout of, recognition and encour-&#xD;
agement from those who personally knew our hero:&#xD;
"that's being into him with a long pole, indeed !"&#xD;
But the clown had no idea of meeting such an enemy,&#xD;
armed in such a fashion; and, eluding the tremendous&#xD;
blow and thrust with which Barry addressed his ribs,&#xD;
he vaulted clear over the shoulder of the latter and dis-&#xD;
appeared behind the screen which sheltered the actor~&#xD;
from the audience. His enemy thus out of sight, the&#xD;
fiiriovts eh~1pioD proceeded to wreak his vengeance upon&#xD;
K the inanimate objects around him. The ~scene in which&#xD;
&#xD;
the clown was to have tricked the African magician&#xD;
out of his soul was a most exquisite garden of Bagdad.&#xD;
There were stands of beautiful flowers, vases of great&#xD;
magnitude, statues, and several rich things by way of&#xD;
ornament and decoration, which, seen through the me-&#xD;
dium of distance, or by the aid of flickering lights,&#xD;
* looked to be very precious. There ~was also a sort of&#xD;
close bower, a framework draped with silk, in which&#xD;
the cunning clown had placed a sleeping beauty. She&#xD;
was not the smallest part of the temptations with which&#xD;
the soul of the magician was to be entrapped. Barry,&#xD;
with his pole, had already thrown down one or two of the&#xD;
wooden flower~vases, with their precious contents, and&#xD;
his~pole now descended upon the bower, which a~ single&#xD;
stroke served to precipitate to the ground. To the sur-&#xD;
prise of the assailant, not less than the assembly, up&#xD;
sprang from the ruins a most beautifully dressed damsel;&#xD;
young, pretty, and habited like a Sultana. It was for-&#xD;
tunate, indeed, that the~ weight of the pole had not&#xD;
fallen upon her. But it has grazed sufficiently close to&#xD;
arouse all her fury; not Waiting an instant, she darted&#xD;
upon oui?' hero, and, drawing the little stiletto which she&#xD;
wore as a part of her Oiiental costume, he might have&#xD;
been made to pay seriously for his frolic; for the rage&#xD;
of the woman was apparent in her closely, set teeth and&#xD;
her flre~gleaming eyes. But Barry seized her arm, ~~as&#xD;
she struck, and dropping his pole stood only on the .de-&#xD;
fensive~ The farce began to look greatly like tragedy.&#xD;
The enraged woman now shrieked and struggled. fler&#xD;
husband rushed out from the interior, armed with an&#xD;
axe. The clown again made his appearance, followed'&#xD;
by the whole troupe, each seizing whatever weapon oWered&#xD;
as he came. There were sailors, and Turks, and magi-&#xD;
cians, and~ even little Cupid's urchins, ;two~ feet high,&#xD;
whom papa and mamma were thus assiduously training&#xD;
in the way they should not go. These all confronted&#xD;
our unlucky jockey with 'the most ~tincomprornising fury&#xD;
in their looks,. 'Re had spoiled the proceedings, throwrL&#xD;
the assembly into' the most admired disorder, and it wa~~&#xD;

justice only that doomed him t6 a condign punishment.&#xD;
I3nt, if they were formidable, Barry now no longer&#xD;
stood alone. Tom Nettles was by his side, and the&#xD;
long pole which Barry .had discarded Was in his grasp9&#xD;
"Hillabee boys," he cried aloud, "bring out your&#xD;
hickories!".&#xD;
Twenty vigorous youngsters sprang out at the sum-&#xD;
nions, and ranged themselves on the side of the ama-&#xD;
teurs. Great clubs of knotted hickories were already&#xD;
flourishing high; and, forgetting his ia~te danger, Jones&#xD;
Barry already felt that he was a hero. He still main-&#xD;
~tained his grasp upon the 'Sultana, and seemed disposed&#xD;
to carry her oW as the captive to his bow and spear,&#xD;
when the cool voice of Nettles commanded him to let&#xD;
her go. He did so; and the sleeping beauty, now wide&#xD;
awake, darted into the arms of the magician, who was&#xD;
her husband,.upon whose bosom she sobbed convulsively,&#xD;
as ata providential escape from~a great danger. Thus&#xD;
the parties stood, i-confronting ~each other.; both looking&#xD;
firm and fierce enough, and threatening trouble. Not&#xD;
only did the "whole troupe of equestrians range them-&#xD;
selves for hat'tle under the' leadership of ~he clown, but&#xD;
'one of the horses coolly marched in, covered with&#xD;
panoply, and, thrusting his head over that worthy's&#xD;
shoulder,' seemed to promise him sufficient hacking, and&#xD;
in truth looked very formidable. lilt was a scene; the&#xD;
clown, as a matter of course, opposed himself to Barry,&#xD;
who, armed with a pole, looked aghast at the twofold&#xD;
conflict before him, in the threatening aspect of both&#xD;
horse and rider. But Nettles fortunately knew Ahe head&#xD;
meii of tlie~ company. lie said-&#xD;
~"My friends~ this is altogether a mistake, which I&#xD;
easily explain, and, I trust, easily reconcile. There's&#xD;
no fun infighting, though we're by no means afraid, as&#xD;
you may' see, to meet any number of men or horses.&#xD;

cises as before. In the, mean time,. Mr. Barry' and my~&#xD;
self will retire with the manager 'here, and we'll adjust&#xD;
the difficulty in private together." A suggestion so&#xD;
politic was acceptable to all parties, though, onee on the&#xD;
ground, the iillabee boys did not relish the idea of, re-&#xD;
turning without having done something glorious 'by way&#xD;
~of showing how well their destructive faculties had been&#xD;
developedd. Barry was a little scrupulous about entering&#xD;
the mysterious sanctum to which the' clown and, the Sub&#xD;
tana had retired, but, having great confidence in Nettles,&#xD;
and being assured by the great coolness and confidence&#xD;
of the latter, h~ followed him and the manager into the&#xD;
place of retreat., Here he found himself amidst a motley&#xD;
group. Horses- were staring them in the face on all&#xD;
hands. Some of the equestrians were already mounted~&#xD;
Here, in one corner was a trunk and box;' there a~ table&#xD;
and chair; and there a chest;~ and there a 'bundle; and&#xD;
there the uniform of a giant;' and there the dozen&#xD;
masks and jackets of the clown. There, to~, re~&#xD;
covered from~ the dust and danger of the arena, ~was&#xD;
the unlucky colossal, mask. and headdress which our&#xD;
hero had torn 9ff from his enemy at the first encounter.&#xD;
Nettles walked in with the air of a man perfectly at&#xD;
home.&#xD;
"And now," said he, "IDiavolo," agdre~sing the&#xD;
clown, "let us begin the work of peace, as you begun&#xD;
the war. Prepare us one of those excellent brand&#xD;
cocktails with which you tempted toy friend to despe..&#xD;

shaken; eyes 'glistened and,' with the consent of the&#xD;
r~agician, his lovely Sultana freely bestowed the' kiss of&#xD;
peace upon our hero'. Th~ example was gratuitously&#xD;
followed by the clown, whose embra,.ce and, salutation&#xD;
were distinctly stamped ~pon the front of Barry, in&#xD;
unequal decorations of verxiiiUon and buri~t cork. 1Their&#xD;
embraces' ~eemed to affect the dextrous Torn Nettles&#xD;
with a serious delight.&#xD;
+f' How beautiful," said he, " is it to 1~ehold' brethren&#xD;
thus dwelling in amity together! What a spectacle!&#xD;
It is necessary that the audience should see it; that&#xD;
they~ should see that this is, no mockery; but that the&#xD;
foes' have freely exchanged forgiveness. 'Another&#xD;
draught from         t,. gentlemen," said he, address~&#xD;

Rarry had no scruples about the dram, but he. rather&#xD;
~hung back at the prQposal ~for the' embrace in public.&#xD;
His 'reluctance disappeared with the draught. He&#xD;
swore that Diavolo was the best fellow in the world,&#xD;
and made the finest cocktails; and, with an arm about&#xD;
eaph other's waist, each bearing a cocktail in liatid, they&#xD;
enwrged from th~ canopy into the' area, and drank to&#xD;
each ~ther, and th~ audience. If war exulted 'in the&#xD;
previous sA~ene, philanthropy was proportionally happy&#xD;
now. The audience were ravished. The old ladies&#xD;
wept. The 'old men thought it just as well,; and the&#xD;
negrpes were perfectly well satisfied; wondering only a&#xD;
little 'to behold.a man drinking with such~ 'a capacious&#xD;

~All, seemed' perfectly well satisfied but young iillabee,&#xD;

"'There's a drop yet in the bucket,'. whispered the&#xD;
cloii to his new comrade. The hint was not lost upon&#xD;
]~arry~, He returned to the sanctum, where he found&#xD;
'his friend: Tom Nettles. There thpy remained till the&#xD;
perfornnrieeswere ovei',~nd the c~owd'departed~; when&#xD;
&#xD;
they were invited to a hot supper with 'the~ t~oup~; in&#xD;
the great area of the pavilion. The invitation was not&#xD;
to be disregarded. The equestrians lived well;, and&#xD;
Barry and his' friend were both hungry. But, were it&#xD;
not so, the wishes of the 'latter would. scarcely have had&#xD;
any weight upon our delighted hero. He kad been the&#xD;
hero of the night, though after a ~ornewhat~ doubtful&#xD;
fashion,. it is true.; hut he had been. conspicuous,. and&#xD;
had come out of the scene with applause. Of course7&#xD;
he could not doubt that it was his appearance which&#xD;
was so warmly welcomed when he had come forth in&#xD;
the embraces of the clowns The~ clapping and shouting&#xD;
seemed to him the most grateful sounds' to which he&#xD;
had ever listened; and the brandy cocktails were, the&#xD;
most delicious of mortal beverages. It was a night of glo-&#xD;
rification. The supper-table was spread. His friend was&#xD;
placed on one side of the manager; he occupied the&#xD;
other. Beside him, sat the lovely wife of the magician,&#xD;
whose graciousness never even provoked the frowns of&#xD;
her mysterious lord. At first, Jones Barry felt a little&#xD;
squeamish on this subject. When she gazed so tenderly&#xD;
in his eyes, and suffered her finger to rest so impres..&#xD;
sively on his 'wrist, ~he felt a dubhrnsness, and looked ~&#xD;
his doubts at the husband. But he knew not the indif-&#xD;
ference of professional magic to those mortal subjects.'&#xD;
The latter saw everything without'~ discomposure; and,,&#xD;
after a little turn of hesitation and doubt, our hero de-&#xD;
'livered himself up, soul and body, to all the intoxica-&#xD;
tion of a conviction that he had won the heart of this&#xD;
most beautiful of all the creatures of Faery. They&#xD;
'drank together,, and whispered together. The hours&#xD;
waxed late.' Barry sang a comic song, at the instance&#xD;
of Nettles, and, at the conclusion, was more delighted&#xD;
than astounded; as his' Sulana, throwing her arms&#xD;
about his neck, and seating herself in his lap, in the&#xD;
face of all the assembly, called him the finest little f'el-&#xD;
low in the world. He did not know how he. should re-'&#xD;
compense such 'devotion, but by forcing a great ring from'&#xD;
his upon her finger. She coyly' suffered him, in a mo~&#xD;

ment after, to transfer the diamond breastpin from his&#xD;
to herbosom. He put it there himself; and all this&#xD;
the magician saw without seeming to regard it as in any&#xD;
wtse improper. The next morning, Barry found him-&#xD;
self where he had supped, sleeping upon one of the&#xD;
benches, with a bundle of straw under his head, and&#xD;
one of the horse-cloths, green and scarlet, spread above&#xD;
his body. Tom Nettles, as he opened his byes, was to&#xD;
be -seen standing with the manager at ~a little distance,&#xD;
and mixing a couple of rosy anti-fogmatics.&#xD;
.1'&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE HUMORS OF THE CIRCUS.&#xD;
BARRY was not the man to suffer from headaches;&#xD;
but his stomachh was one that needed to be fortified by&#xD;
tonics. The sight of his friend, when he discovered the&#xD;
occupation in which he was engaged, fully arcaised him.&#xD;
He was on his feet in an instant, jerking up his trousers,&#xD;
and approaching Nettles with the haste of a person who&#xD;
fears that he may come too late. But there were some&#xD;
particulars in which Nettles never abandoned his com~&#xD;
panion. He was emphatically what young people call&#xD;
"a good. fellow," and good fellowship implies the neces-&#xD;
sity of assisting your friend and facilitating his ready&#xD;
attainment of all desirable indulgences. In making an,~&#xD;
anti-fogmatic for himself, he had not forgotten his com-&#xD;
rade. There was a huge vessel before him, where the&#xD;
beverage stood in waiting, and Tom, Jones Barry,- and&#xD;
the manager of the amphitheatre, were soon engaged in&#xD;
a hob-a-nobbing match that didn't stop at a single stoop.&#xD;
Barry declared himself quite happy. He had enjoyed&#xD;
a pleasant dream of the magician's wife, and he natu-&#xD;
rally inquired after her.&#xD;
"Look in," said Tom ~Nettles, with a smirk to the&#xD;
manager which Barry did not perceive, while he point-&#xD;
ed the latter to the sanctum where the reconciliation&#xD;
had taken place the night before. Without a moment's&#xD;
hesitation, our little h~ro followed the finger, and found&#xD;
himself in the lady's dressing4oom, he~ toilet only her.&#xD;
gun, and ~he, in the most loose undress in the world,&#xD;
employed before the broken mirror which hung from one&#xD;
of the uprights of the tent. Barry was astounded,&#xD;
and would have started back; but she saw him in the -&#xD;

glass, and, wheeling round, at once summoned him,&#xD;
though in the very sweetest accents, to approach.&#xD;
"You are just in time," said she; "I wanted some-&#xD;
body to lace my jackets.&#xD;
"Jackets 1" exclaimed Barry, aghast.&#xD;
"Yes, to be sure! Come now, you're a nice little&#xD;
fellow, I know. Let me 'see-you have small fingers.&#xD;
Show yourself diligent, and help me to fix myself.&#xD;
That man of mine never gives me any assistance.&#xD;
There he sleeps. Look at him. He will snore till noon,&#xD;
and never fairly wakens till it's time to dres~'for the&#xD;
performance."&#xD;
She pointed to the end of a wagon that appeared&#xD;
under a corner of the* tent, from which, sure enough,&#xD;
the ears of ~Barry detected a very decided snore. But&#xD;
thi~ did' not encourage him. He was utterly astounded&#xD;
at the new duty required at his hands. In all his ex-&#xD;
perience, he had never before laced a woman's corsets&#xD;
-or unlaced them; and he scarcely knew how to under-&#xD;
~'tand the Sultana. But seeing his hesitation, Sultana-&#xD;
like, she stamped her little foot, and repeated her orders.&#xD;
She did not leave' him long doubtful that she was in&#xD;
earnest.&#xD;
"Come," ~aidNshe, "what do you wait for?' Is it&#xD;
because ,you're bashful? Well! at ~o~r age!; But you&#xD;
needn't be, here! We know a thing or two! we've no false&#xD;
modesty heri~, I assure you. A leg's a leg, with us. We&#xD;
talk plainly, and are not the worse for it. We don't&#xD;
make a fuss about shadows as long as we keep the sub-&#xD;
stance; and indeed, it's only those who have lost the sub-&#xD;
stance that do. Come, stir yourself, and there's a kiss&#xD;
to begin with, by way of recompense.&#xD;
A few momei ts found our hero awkwardly busy with&#xD;
the waist of the Sultana. While thus engaged, the&#xD;
manager and Tom Nettles came in.&#xD;
~' That woman,'~ said the manager aloud, "has tire&amp;amp;&#xD;
out every member ' of ~the troupe in lacing her. She&#xD;
will have her waist brought within the narrowest com-&#xD;
pass, and she breaks her cords daily in trying to make it&#xD;

smaller. There's not a hand among us that she has&#xD;
not made sfre in the abominable work, and now she&#xD;
takes to our visitors."&#xD;
"And why not ?" said the Sultana, with the air of the&#xD;
orient~ "Is he not rewarded? It- is not often he is&#xD;
permitted. to study a good model." .&#xD;
"A little too round, madame," said the manager.&#xD;
"Too round !" screamed the Sultana.&#xD;
"Not a bit," said Tom Nettles, coolly interposing to&#xD;
span th~ waist. "An exquisite union of symmetry and&#xD;
strength."&#xD;
"Strength !" demanded madame.&#xD;
"Yes, to be sure; strength is necessary to grace, even&#xD;
in a woman. It's the mistake of too many of the 8ex&#xD;
that an air of feebleness is supposed to imply delicacy.&#xD;
It is rather the reverse. II wish to see vigor with grace-;&#xD;
and a woman ought to seem as capable of a fine wrestle&#xD;
as of a fine sentiment."&#xD;
"I've a great mind to trip your heels for that," said&#xD;
the Sultana, pertly.&#xD;
"And if I am to take a fall, I should wish for. no&#xD;
worse embrace than yours. But I lea~~e Barry to the&#xD;
danger. He's a better wrestler than myself', and it&#xD;
strikes me that his lacing begins to look much more like&#xD;
hugging. Beware, Jones, or I'll tell your sweetheart."&#xD;
Barry blushed to the roots of his hair.&#xD;
"Has he a sweetheart? Is he in love?" demanded&#xD;
the Sultana.&#xD;
"The danger is that he is in love with m1pre 'than he&#xD;
can manage. Yesterday he loved but one woman.&#xD;
What lessons you have taught him, since that time, may&#xD;
be guessed from the way he performs the present opera..&#xD;
tion. His lacing~ is very like embracing;, and, if he&#xD;
goes on at this rate, he'll be for a wrestle in earnest."&#xD;
"And if he is," said the magician, suddenly thrusting&#xD;
his head upward from the tail ~of the wagon, "I'll en~&#xD;
gage that Nell can throw him, or any man in company9"&#xD;
"Nell! Oh, you wretch I" cried the Sultana.&#xD;
"Nell!" She was Madame Zerlina, in the bill of. the&#xD;

"Ay, Nell, bring it yourself."&#xD;
The wife ~eized a tumbler that stood on a chest beside&#xD;

away the nest moment to her, magician, without seeming&#xD;

had been confided to hi~ care.&#xD;
"There~ you!" she cried, thrusting the drink into his&#xD;
clutches.&#xD;
"Jsn't~ she a beauty ?" said the magician, with a leer&#xD;
to Barry, as he took the liquor. Barry could only&#xD;

you done new. There !" she exclaimed, wheeling about&#xD;
and grasping the unsuspecting Barry in her arms, giv-&#xD;
ing 1dm an embrace, before releasing him, that half took&#xD;
away his breath. "There, that's your reward. lit isn't&#xD;
often a fine woman bestow~a scjueeze upon hersweetheart,&#xD;
and IL only do. it now to show you what your friend&#xD;
~neanswheii lie says that the beauty of a woman means&#xD;
vigor as well~ aa grace. If you'd like, to try the wrestle&#xD;
after the squeeze, say the word, and I'm ready for you.&#xD;
"And I'll go a hundred on Nell against the field,"&#xD;
cried the husband, from~the wagon.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, beast there, with your' Nell," cried the heroine,&#xD;
indignantly. "I've done everything, I've even thrashed&#xD;
him, to teach him good manners, but it's so much love&#xD;
and labor thrown away."&#xD;
"But how about the wrestle? Who t~kes me up ?"&#xD;
demanded the husband. The Sultana herself looked&#xD;
'about her with the eye of a challenger. She was still&#xD;
only dressed in part, and her fine bust and figure af-&#xD;
forded not a bad idea of Ole~patra. Her breasts seemed&#xD;
breaking through the very partial restraints upon 'them,&#xD;
and her arms, partly bare, were adniirably white and&#xD;
rounded, revealing that equal union of muscular and&#xD;
flesh development which crowns the person with&#xD;
strength, without lessening its beauty.-. By this time,&#xD;
however, the admiration of Jones Barry had in some&#xD;
degree given way to misgivings and apprehension. His&#xD;
sense of the beauty of the woman was somewhat im-&#xD;
paired by his disquiet at her boldness. The privileges&#xD;
to which he had been admitted had certainly shown no&#xD;
warmth or feeling ~n her part, and, in fact, she' had&#xD;
treated him rather like a boy than a man. He was'&#xD;
awed and abashed, by her manners, rather than de-&#xD;
lighted with her charms; and the single squeeze which&#xD;
she had so gratuitously bestowed upon him was quite&#xD;
sufficient to satisfy him, without desiring the wrestle.&#xD;
He accordingly ~aid~ nothing, while Nettles, with exem-&#xD;
plary 'coolness, quietly remarked that "he, perhaps,&#xD;
should have no serious objection to the trial, could he&#xD;
be sure of fair play, but as he had never found that&#xD;
from a woman yet, he was not disposed to incur any un~..&#xD;
necessary risk "&#xD;
By this time one of the subordinates made his ap-&#xD;
pearance, announcing breakfast in the amphitheatre..&#xD;
Nettles gallantly assisted the lady in completing her&#xD;
toilet, and this affair adjusted, he gave her his army&#xD;
and conducted her into the temple.. He was fiAlewed&#xD;
by Barry, who felt nothing hut envy at~ th~ ease and&#xD;
readiness with which his friend performed the duties of'&#xD;
the courtier. The" equestrians played the part of ho5ts&#xD;

with great liberality and good-humor, and the meal lin.&#xD;
geared for more than an hour, in which, while the cates&#xD;
were various and ample, they constituted hut a minor&#xD;
portion of the attraction. The coolness, readiness,&#xD;
great resource, experience, and anecdote of these per-&#xD;
formers furnished an unfailing subject of wonder to&#xD;
Barry. They seemed to know' everything about the&#xD;
world, and some of them seemed quite at home on the&#xD;
subject of books. Zerlina, our Sultana, or "Nell," as&#xD;
the magician, her husband, persisted' in calling her,&#xD;
was quite a dabbler literature. She was read in the&#xD;
dramatic poets~ and had an ambition for the stage,&#xD;
which some mysterious influence prevented her from&#xD;
seeking to gratify. She made frequent exhibitions, at&#xD;
the entreaty of Nettles, of her pow ers, while reading&#xD;
favorite passages, and thus increased the degree of awe&#xD;
and admiration which Barry already entertained for&#xD;
he~r. Her civiliti'es were somewhat less free than they&#xD;
had been the night before, but they were still such as&#xD;
a matronmight readily bestow upon a moderately grown&#xD;
boy. Poor Barry, though pleased with much of this&#xD;
sort of petting, was yet humbled by it! and it was with&#xD;
something of a feeling of relief that he received a hint&#xD;
from 'Nettles that it was time to depart. The troupe&#xD;
were to exhibit another night at ilillabee, as the mul-&#xD;
titude, though diminished, was still sufficiently large to&#xD;
compensate the performance. There were extemporary&#xD;
races throughout the day, but generally with common&#xD;
horses. To these neither Barry nor Nettles greatly&#xD;
inclined, and their;separation from their hosts of the hip-&#xD;
podrome was pretty much a leave-taking of the field.&#xD;
Nettles had known the manager, the magician, and the&#xD;
fair~Zerlina, some time before, and they parted as old&#xD;
friends. The Sultana' squeezed Barry's hands with a&#xD;
frank earnes4fless, as she bad&amp;amp;him good-by, telling him&#xD;
he was a nice fellow, and she should always remember&#xD;
him by his gifts, pointi~ig to his ring and breastpin.&#xD;
was with a twInge that our hero heard this speech.&#xD;
He thought sulkily of the half-maudlin tendei'ness of&#xD;
&#xD;
the. night before, in .w~tich he had heen beguiled of&#xD;
jewels that he would - prefer to see on very different&#xD;
fingers. The thoughts of Nettles, in some degree, took&#xD;
the same direction with his own. As they rode together'&#xD;
homeward, and when~they had fairly emerged from con-&#xD;
tact with the multitude, the former, with a quizzical&#xD;
smile, said to Barry-&#xD;
"I say, Jones, what the d-l would your sweetheart,&#xD;
the fair Geraldine, have said, could sh~ have seen&#xD;
you sitting in the lap of our INelly, eh?"&#xD;
"I didn't sit in her lap, Tom; she sat in mine.&#xD;
"So much the better for the sight! What would&#xD;
she have said, or what could you have said, had she&#xD;
suddenly plumped in upon you when Nelly was in your&#xD;
lap, her arm about your neck, and giving you that smack&#xD;
of the lips, which seemed to you like twine from heaven?&#xD;
You got drunk almost instantly after it. You hugged&#xD;
her like a hero, until she' couldn't stand it any longer,&#xD;
and broke away, as if she feared some harm~frona her&#xD;
magician husband."&#xD;
"Oh! I didn't, Tom. Now don't you be telling' that&#xD;
nonsense about."&#xD;
"flow can I help it, Jones, my good fellow? The&#xD;
joke is quite too good to be lost. For the one smack,&#xD;
the moment you had tasted it, you gave her *a dozen,&#xD;
till she gave in and cried "nough! 'nough!' as fervently&#xD;
as the fellow whose sockets are filling fast with sand&#xD;
from his enemy's fingers; and such a squeeze about the&#xD;
body that she fairly heaved again, though pretty well&#xD;
used to tight bracing."&#xD;
"Never, Tom; never&#xD;
"But it's a true bill, Jones. Then, you sung a co-&#xD;
mic song; and, in trying to get on the table for a Vir-&#xD;
ginny reel, you slipped over into the sawdust, an'd 'lay&#xD;
there with a gurgle in your throat, as if you were try-&#xD;
ing to drink and sing at the same moment. You don't&#xD;
know, I suppose, who laid you out upon the benches?"&#xD;
"No, Tom, Ii don't."&#xD;
"Who, but Nell and myself? She took your arms,&#xD;

good for you. You'll make a bad husband. And I&#xD;
can't~think of suffering her to marry in the dark. She&#xD;
must know-."&#xD;
"Tom, my dear fellow. Honor bright! But, I see&#xD;
you're onlyjoking."&#xD;
"Joking,'.indeed! No! no! There's only one thing&#xD;
that will prevent me from interfering, and that is-"&#xD;
He paused.&#xD;
"Eh! What?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"That there's no sort of use for it, as there's no sort&#xD;
of danger that she'll ever marry you.~~&#xD;
"And why not, I wonder ?"&#xD;
"Why not! When you prefer to stay here at a&#xD;
horserace, to seeing her home. When you let her go&#xD;
off under the escort of your rivals, while you go a gan-&#xD;
'der-pulling. When the circus is more grateful to you&#xD;
than her company; and when, not content with the&#xD;
performances of other people, you take another man's&#xD;
wife into your lap, and-"&#xD;
"But, Tom, she don't know; she won't know-"&#xD;
"These things are sure to leak out; and when it's&#xD;
known that you gave this pretty woman your ring and&#xD;
breastpin, and promised to remember her as long as you&#xD;
lived-"&#xD;
"No, I'll be k----d if I did."&#xD;
"And I'll be k-------d if you didn't !" responded the&#xD;
tormentor.&#xD;
"Tom, by the blazes, you're no friend of mine, or&#xD;
you wouldn't talk so. But, I know you of old. You&#xD;
only do it to worry me. You won't blab."&#xD;
"Well, suppose I don't? What chance do you stand&#xD;
with the fair Geraldine when you neglect her so, and&#xD;
when you have such chaps as Ran. Hammond and Miles&#xD;
Henderson against you?"&#xD;
"I don't care a curse for Hammond. She shows him&#xD;
less favor than all the rest. She's cross to him; and,&#xD;
for that matter,, it don't seem to me that he cares a&#xD;
curse for her."&#xD;
"Don't you believe it !"&#xD;
"Well! let him come. It costs nothing, and it comes&#xD;
to nothing. She don't care for him."&#xD;
"I'm not so sure of that !''&#xD;
"She don't show it, at least. She's more shy of&#xD;
him, by far, than she is of me or Henderson."&#xD;
"The shyness is in his favor. Was Nelly shy of you?&#xD;

all his opportunities with others; and, indeed, to f&amp;amp;r~go&#xD;
them wholly on occasion, giving way to~ the advances&#xD;
of those who were notoriously his rivals. Mrs. roster&#xD;
was greatly at a 1o~s,'for a whule,~to underste~nd- th~ policy&#xD;
of this seeming indifference; but her instincts eriaNed&#xD;
her to discover the truth, which her reasoning faculties&#xD;
never could have attained; the more particularly as she&#xD;
found that Geraldine iFoster,. flattered by the cons~an4&#xD;
devotion of her suitors, was. somewhat piqued by 'the&#xD;
dignified refusal of Hammond to engage in the corn on&#xD;
struggle. With a vulgar policy, ;tlie mother's - object&#xD;
now -was. to' impress upon our heroine -an idea cC the&#xD;
arrogance of Hammond; his- -pride, which refused the -&#xD;
ordinary civilities which all lovers are prepared to be~&#xD;
stow; and an insolent con~eiousne8s of superiority, which&#xD;
made him always anxious to deny the service which ~gal-&#xD;
lantry, and a sincere affection, would be only too -happy&#xD;
to perform. - His - refusal to run his horse at HilIa~bee,&#xD;
as we have seen, was oite of the instances- -whih- ~Ee&#xD;
found to produce the desired impression upon the mind&#xD;
of her prot6g&amp;amp; - To a. certain extent she had succeeded&#xD;
'in producing this impression. The proud and haughty&#xD;
spirit -of Geraldine Fester, conscious of her~ charms, -and&#xD;
accustomed to the devotion of the other sex, and the&#xD;
envy of. ~ier own, was -mortified at the: little seeming&#xD;
power which she possessed over - almost the only ~i8fl&#xD;
whom she had -ever really desired to subdue. She, felt&#xD;
his strength, hi~ superiority. Her attention, when-he.&#xD;
spoke, acknowledged it; her anxiety for l~is- eoniingde..&#xD;
dared it, even to herself; and the ~growing feeling~9f&#xD;
her dependence upon him made his apparent ind-ifferei~ce--&#xD;
only the more offensive to her vanity and-~painfu1 to her&#xD;
heart.' The step-mother had worked, not unsuccessfully,&#xD;
upon these feelings; hut Geraldine was 'so much- a crea-&#xD;
ture of ~mpulse that the work of months might be undone - -&#xD;
in a moment.- A. -happy accident~-might bring -the-lovers&#xD;
together in explanation, and mutual sympathies, sh.dden~&#xD;

favoring circumstances, might render the deterniined -&#xD;

I~62         A8~ GOOD A0 A CQMDDY: OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Foster brooded over other schemes for 'fomenting&#xD;
anew the displeasure of her step-daughter.&#xD;
"Foster Lodge" was. a place of considerable beauty.&#xD;
The immediate approach to it was through a broad&#xD;
avenue, itearly a mile in length, guarded and overshad~&#xD;
owed from each side by the sta1~eliest elms~ and oaks.&#xD;
The dwelling stoodnpon a genfle eminence, with a broad&#xD;
and sweet1y~sloping. lawn of green on each side' of the&#xD;
avenue, extending nearly to the public road. The&#xD;
house ~was half shaded by great trees, a modest dwell-&#xD;
ing of two stories, with a piazza 'fronting' the avenue,&#xD;
the~ roof of which, concealed by a parapet, was sustained&#xD;
by six great columns, tht4 rose upmajestically from the&#xD;
basement~to the upper story.&#xD;
Dinner was in waiting when the parties arrived.&#xD;
11am and turkey smoked ~upon the board, and there&#xD;
were birds. and fowl, 'eggs and milk, &amp;amp;nd the usud va-&#xD;
riety of vegetables, so certain to be found in ally good&#xD;
farmsteads. Mrs. Foster was an economist. She 'was&#xD;
a; farmer's daughter; a poor' one too; and had been&#xD;
early taught in lessons Qf thrift and painstaking. These&#xD;
~he had not Lorgottenin her improved fortunes. in-&#xD;
deed, they were her virtues. Her estates thrived~ in&#xD;
her hands; and, if not' a good tutor for the daughter,&#xD;
she was a very good nurse of her property. ~This was&#xD;
ample, if' not~ large. It wasp the misfortune of Mrs.&#xD;
Foster that, she did' not esteem it ample. This was one&#xD;
of her reasons for preferring' Jones Barry to either of&#xD;
her present guests. 'The fact of his greater wealth, and&#xD;
"   that~ feebler 'character ~hich made him subservient to&#xD;
',   Mrs~. Foster's humors, were the chief sources 'of that.&#xD;
favor'Which he had found in the good lady's sight.&#xD;
Dinner' passed off' pleasantly.' Hammond continued&#xD;
in the same ~humor which 'had accompanied him from&#xD;
the race-course. II~yen Mrs. Foster, herself, was 'some-&#xD;
~times compelled to'smile at his 'sallies; and' when she&#xD;
did not,' it 'was only from the annoying conviction that&#xD;
they were rapidly 'undoing all her work. lIt was night&#xD;
befQI~e the party rose from table,~ and a short interval&#xD;
&#xD;
was afforded for promenading in. thQ piazza, before t~a&#xD;
was set. This was tWiowed by, music. Gcraldine &amp;amp;an~&#xD;
and played like. aii angel; this, at lea8t, was the ~opew~&#xD;
mouthed deelarati~n of Jones Baxry, in her oWz~ hiing,;&#xD;

rich and ~tolerably well-triPned voices.~ , ~Chey ~cc&amp;amp;rn~&#xD;
pau~ied the lady; while; at intervals, 'they r~sun~d, the&#xD;
conversation, either with hei~self ~or' the ~&#xD;
lit was, eleven o'clock before any of the party seeni~ed&#xD;
to suspect the Iiight of Time, a~d then they were vniy&#xD;
apprised of the fact by hammond rising '~t~ take Iii~&#xD;
leave.&#xD;
"But why.ndt stay all night?" wa&amp;amp;. the fr~an~ 'dew&#xD;
mand of Geraldine. Mrs. Foster addressed the same&#xD;
inquiry to Henderson. The latter looked to Harnm~ind&#xD;
entreatingly; but, true to his policy, he declared the&#xD;
necessity for being at homie early in the morning; 'a~n4&#xD;
he had' promised bis mother, who wodd sit, i~p and e~&#xD;
pect him, to return that nighL. lie had five wiles' to&#xD;
ride.&#xD;
"But 'you, Miles," said he to his friend,, '~ you' need&#xD;
not ride. You can stay."&#xD;
This speech again worried 'both mother and daughter.&#xD;
It seefoed strange that one ~ really loved a. lady&#xD;
should encourage a rival, to keep possession of her ear;&#xD;
and should give him ~opportunities. But Jl~nder~eu&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
TOUGHNESS OF THE TENDER GENDER.&#xD;
&#xD;
WE must skip, without notice, the events of several&#xD;
weeks, in which but little apparent prQgress was made&#xD;
on any hand. The parties met frequently, now at&#xD;
church, now at evening assemblages~~of friends and still,&#xD;
as before, very frequently at the dwelling of 'our hero-"&#xD;
me. Randall Hammond eontinue4~ his policy, though&#xD;
with a misgiving, which gradually increased with the&#xD;
increase of his passion; and an eye less anxious, and ~&#xD;
mind less excitable than that of Geraldine's, would have&#xD;
readily detected, at particular moments, the proofs~ of&#xD;
this strengthening interest. But what with her own&#xD;
feelings engaged in the issue, and the continued an4&#xD;
perverse hostility of Mrs. Foster 'to the claims of our&#xD;
hero, she was kept in the same dogged mood towards&#xD;
him in which we have beheld, her while 'taking the&#xD;
strange vow' recorded, in the preceding chapter.. He&#xD;
saw and felt the influence, but was without any means&#xD;
to meet and to contend with it; unless by the exercise&#xD;
of the same patience which he had hitherto displayed,&#xD;
and the unwearied exhibition of those talents and '~e~&#xD;
source's which had rendered him still agreeable in her&#xD;
eyes in the teeth of all her prejudices. His mother, it,&#xD;
may be mentioned in this place, had expressed h~r&#xD;
doubts of the propriety of his seeking in marriage the&#xD;
hand of Geraldine Foster. Of the young lady~herself,'&#xD;
~the venerable dame knew nothing, except from hearsay;&#xD;
and rumor rather exaggerated defects than acknowledged&#xD;
virtues. The objections of Mrs. Hammond lay' tQ the&#xD;
step-mother, whom she knew as a pert housekeeper em~&#xD;
played in a neighboring family, when she wasproirioted&#xD;

168         AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
by Foster, then sinking with ai feeble constitution, and&#xD;
"equally feeble mind, into imbecility. She regarded&#xD;
her influence over the stepdaughter as vicious and dan-&#xD;
gerous, and, whatever might be the individual endow-&#xD;
ments of the girl, she insisted upon their abuse and per-,&#xD;
version in the hands of such a guardi~in. We have seen&#xD;
that she is' right in some measure; but she overrated&#xD;
the influence of the one, and underrated the powers of&#xD;
resistance of the other.. The girl, in reality, in many&#xD;
'respects, controlled the won~an. The latter, conscious&#xD;
of low birth~ and 'inferior education, though naturally&#xD;
clever, was submissive to the daughter in most social&#xD;
respects; and it was only where the latter was necessa-&#xD;
rily diffident, as in the case of her affections, that she&#xD;
exercised~ any influence over her sufficiently powerful&#xD;
to baffle 'the impulses of her own judgment. In affairs&#xD;
of the heart, or, rather, where young persons are called&#xD;
upon to decide between two or more faVorites, the adroit'&#xD;
suggestions of third" parties hav0 always more or less&#xD;
weight. The mind distrusts itself but too frequently&#xD;
whei~ the affections, are busy with its decisions; and it is&#xD;
because of this fact, that we find so many of that perni-&#xD;
cious class called match-makers in the world. They&#xD;
interpose when the will of the interested person is at&#xD;
fault. They profess friendship, and it is at, such a time&#xD;
i~hat the poor heart longs for such a succor. They in-&#xD;
sinuate doubts, or suggest motives,~ and determine the&#xD;
scales, for or against a party, by 'such arguments or in-&#xD;
nuendoes as are most likely to influence the feeble nature&#xD;
which relies upon. them. Mrs. Foster's hold upon Ge-&#xD;
raldine, in this matter, lay in the morbidly active pride&#xD;
of the damsel. This she contrived to goad and irritate&#xD;
by ~daily 8t~ggestionS, in which the most innocent move-&#xD;
ments of! Hammond were perverted. ~The fear of Mrs.&#xD;
JJammond,'~with regard to her influence upon Miss Fos-&#xD;
ter, went still farther. She dreaded lest she should&#xD;
govern her in all respects; lest she should have tutored&#xD;

have made her equally selfish and presumptuous with&#xD;
herself; coarse in her aims, narrow in her opinions;&#xD;
jealous of the worth which she never sought to eiwilate;&#xD;
and ambitious of society, not for its real advantages of&#xD;
mutual training and attrition, but for its silly dispTh~ys&#xD;
and petty ostentatious.&#xD;
We need not repeat that, in these apprehensions, Mrs.&#xD;
Hammond labored under error; but she did not the less&#xD;
entertain them. A long and serious conversation with&#xD;
her son, the day after his return from the races at Hil-&#xD;
labee, was devoted to this subject. Tn this conversation,&#xD;
she freely declared her objections to the n~iatch with such&#xD;
a person, related all that she had 'heard of Geraldine,&#xD;
and told her son all that she knew of the step-mother,&#xD;
concluding with an earnest entreaty that he would lodk&#xD;
in some other quarter for the exercise of his affections.&#xD;
She was even good enough to mention the names of two&#xD;
or three young' ladies of their acquaintance, whose&#xD;
charms were considerable, and against whom there lay&#xD;
no such objections as she entertained for Miss Foster.&#xD;
But the son, though grateful for this counsel, as frankly&#xD;
told his mother that it fell upon unheeding senses; that&#xD;
he was really and deeply attached 'to Geraldine,; that&#xD;
he was not blind to her faults, ~nd knew her 't6 be&#xD;
equally proud and eccentric; but her pride, he said,&#xD;
arose from a high spirit, sensible only of right purposes,&#xD;
and her eccentricities were the growth of a superior&#xD;
'intellect, under an 'irregular education, and were due in&#xD;
some degree to a consciousness of independence,' falsely&#xD;
founded, perhaps, of the circle in which she moved.&#xD;
Like other lovers, Hammond expressed the opinion that&#xD;
her eccentricities would. certainlyy be cured by marriage,&#xD;
particularly under the admirable domestic system which&#xD;
he was prepared to establish. For the s~tep-mother, he&#xD;
had nothing to say. He had certainly ~no defence to&#xD;
offer. She was pretty much the woman that hi~ mother&#xD;
had described her. Besides, she was evidently hostile&amp;amp;&#xD;
to himself. But her' influence over her step-daughter&#xD;
was nothing. If' exercised in any way, it was, only iii&#xD;

opposition. to himself', and he could readily understand&#xD;
how she might operate successfully .by artifices, pa~rticu-&#xD;
larly in dealing with' a person who was herself truthful&#xD;
and unsuspicious, where, she might never attain any in-.&#xD;
fluence t~y open authority. lie continued, by repeating&#xD;
the assurance to his mother that he felt too much in-&#xD;
terested in the lady to forego his attentions, but that he&#xD;
should watch her conduct narrowly, and not risk his peace&#xD;
upon any object to whom such objections could apply&#xD;
as those which she had urged. lie concluded by ex-&#xD;
pressing his desire that his mother would visit Mrs.&#xD;
Foster, and see the young lady for herself. There was&#xD;
no good reason why she should not do so. it is true&#xD;
she did not like Mrs. Foster, but if people, visited only&#xD;
those whom they liked, society would be almost empty&#xD;
of individuals. Mrs. Foster had called upon her, and&#xD;
had invited her to her ho~ise. True, she might remem-&#xD;
ber her as a pert housekeeper, but she was now a house-&#xD;
holder ; .and if pert in this capacity, it was a fault which&#xD;
could be charged upon a thousand others. At all events&#xD;
Mrs. Foster was no worse than her neighbors, so far as&#xD;
the world was permitted to see. And to recognize her&#xD;
as everybody else 'did, would in no degree impair the&#xD;
ancient position which Mrs. Hammond held in the pub-&#xD;
lic esteem. If any other reason were wanting, it was&#xD;
undoubtedly to be found in the probability of her son&#xD;
establishing an alliance' with this very family, when,&#xD;
as a matter of course, all difference of relative position&#xD;
must be overthrown forever.&#xD;
The worthy old lady sighed as she acknowledged the&#xD;
truth of these reasoning, and prepared to submit to&#xD;
them._~At an early day her' carriage was ordered, and&#xD;
Mrs. Foster *was confounded when she heard that the&#xD;
equipage of the stately old lady was in 'progress u~ the&#xD;
avenue. This was a triumph to her vanity which would&#xD;
have been eminently grai4fied, but that it seemed to&#xD;
operate against her project of marrying her daughter to&#xD;
Barry. One of her. favorite topics of denunciation,&#xD;
where Hammond. was concerned, was his own and his&#xD;
&#xD;
TR~fl T~LNNESSEEANS STORY.      101.&#xD;
mother's arrogance; ~and the rt~glect of the' latter to&#xD;
return her visits was an argument for, the truth of her&#xD;
assertions. I3ut neither Geraldine nor herself was in-&#xD;
sensible to the compliment paid by this visit. Mrs.&#xD;
Hammond was at the very head of society in that .iieigh..'&#xD;
boyhood. 11cr position was unquestionable. Hers was&#xD;
one of the oldest families; i~nd the dignity which she&#xD;
maintained, along with the virtues of benevolence and&#xD;
hospitality.-.-.to speak of ho other of the Christian ~hari-&#xD;
ties-all of which were eminently conceded to her, ren-&#xD;
dered her quite as much beloved as respected. it had&#xD;
been rather injurious to Mrs. Foster's pretensions in&#xD;
society, that Mrs. Hammond had not recognized them.&#xD;
TIiat she did so now, at this late, day, was undoubtedly&#xD;
something gained ; but the perverse pride in her heart&#xD;
prompted a feeling of resentment at the visit so long&#xD;
deferred, and she suddenly exclaimed to Geraldine-.-~&#xD;
"We won't see her. She has taken her time about it,&#xD;
and we will take ours. Let Ch~ra go and tell 'her we&#xD;
are not at home.''&#xD;
"No, indeed, mother! that won't d~. You will gain&#xD;
nothing by it; for people will only say~ you. hate done&#xD;
it for spite. Mrs. Hammond is not a woman to be&#xD;
slighted. However we may feel her neglect of us, she&#xD;
is a lady of worth and character; and I can't thitik of&#xD;
showing her 'any resentment. Besides, I feel none. I'&#xD;
remember her when she used to visit my own dear 'mo-&#xD;
thor, though I was but a child; and I have' heard father&#xD;
speak of her as his friend, when he needed, friendship.&#xD;
Indeed, I have heard that she lent him a large sum of&#xD;
money to save his mills; and, in 'the settlement of' the&#xD;
afthirs of the estate with Lawyer Griffin, I see the re~&#xD;
payment only took place the year before my father died~&#xD;
No! she has had some reason, I suppose,. for keeping&#xD;
away, and that' she comes now shows that these reasons&#xD;
exist no longer. We must see her. I feel nothing but&#xD;
respect for' Mrs. Hammond."&#xD;
This was said in a way to silence opposition. But&#xD;
the step-mother had the last word, framed in a fashion&#xD;

&#xD;
that she had been too much accustomed to employ of&#xD;
late to forego very readily.&#xD;
"It's just as you will, my dear. You have very&#xD;
good reasons for what you say ;~but I rather think that&#xD;
ifyour heart did not incline so much to seeing the son,&#xD;
your reasons wouldn't be half so good for seeing the&#xD;
mother. Take care now.; I see what's coming. You&#xD;
will be overawed by the consequential old woman, until&#xD;
you submit~to the consequentitd young man, and then&#xD;
good-by to all your freedom. I know you, Geraldine&#xD;
Fos1~er; you'll be imposed upon by the high heads of&#xD;
these people,. until you forget all your resolutions."&#xD;
"And I tell you, mother~, that' you know nothing&#xD;
about~ Geraldine Foster, if you think she is to be im-&#xD;
posed upon by a~nybody. I am-"&#xD;
"Well, hush now, before the old witch hears you.&#xD;
She's coming into the parlor now."&#xD;
Geraldine muttered something about the improper&#xD;
use of the epithet old witch, and Mrs. Foster sniggered&#xD;
at the rebuke. The affairs of the toilet proceeded in&#xD;
silence,~ and the daughter was the first who was ready&#xD;
to descend.&#xD;
"She shall wait for me," said the mother, proceeding&#xD;
very leisurely. Geraldine left the room, and descended&#xD;
to th~ parlor. She felt a little awe, certainly~ as she&#xD;
entered the rotm and encountered the tall, stately form&#xD;
of the venerable woman, with her dark dress, and her&#xD;
formal mob cap. But the benevolent manner, and the&#xD;
sweet tones of tjie old lady's voice reassured her.&#xD;
"I know you, my child, by your dear mother. She&#xD;
was my intimate friend. She Was a kind and loving&#xD;
person. You have her eyes and. mouth. Your fore-&#xD;
head and nose are your father's, and you are tall, like&#xD;
your father also. Your. mother was rather short, but&#xD;
she ~as so ~reli made that she did not seem so, unless&#xD;
when standing close to others. If you have her heart,&#xD;
my child, as you certainly have all her beauty.-"&#xD;
The old lady squeezed the hands of the girl,, but&#xD;
failed to see the humid witnesses which were gathering&#xD;
&#xD;
* in her eyes. Those of the speaker were already wet.&#xD;
The sympathies of the two were becoming active, ;and&#xD;
Mrs. Hammond had already reproached our heroine&#xD;
with having failed,, since her return home, after a lapse&#xD;
of several years, to seek out one of her mother's most&#xD;
intimate friends; and Geraldine, who had been kept&#xD;
from doing so only by the perverse influence of her step-&#xD;
mother, was awkwardly seeking to aecouiit and apolo-&#xD;
gize for the neglect, when the door was flung wide, and&#xD;
Mrs. Foster sailed into the room, blazing in her best&#xD;
silks; and making as formidable a show of trinkets as&#xD;
if she were the belle of the, evening. At her appear-&#xD;
ance, the whole manner of Mrs. Hammond seemed t~&#xD;
change. She drew up to her fullest height her tall&#xD;
erect person. Her eye assumed a severe simplicity of&#xD;
gaze, which entirely changed its 'expression; and her&#xD;
reception of the new-coiner, Geraldine could .not but&#xD;
remark, was singularly unlike that which had met her&#xD;
appearance. The' truth is, the absence of simplicity,&#xD;
the obtrusive ostentation of Mrs. Foster's manner, a&#xD;
mixture at once of dignity and assumption which. was&#xD;
neither confidence nor ease, brought out, all the native&#xD;
superiority of her. visitor, Besides, she. remeitibered&#xD;
her as the usurper, foisting herself by cunning upon&#xD;
the weakness of a dying man, and succeeding to a posi-&#xD;
tion in society for which her training and education&#xD;
had not prepared h.er. The first meeting between the&#xD;
two, already prepared to be belligerents, was productive&#xD;
of impressions which strengthened their mutual dislikes&#xD;
and distrusts. Mrs. Foster was boisterous and con-&#xD;
fident; talked recklessly, as if her purpose had 'been to&#xD;
show nothing but scorn Qf all the usual modes~ of think-&#xD;
ing and feeling, all the forms and manners, which 'her&#xD;
.guest had been wont to hold in reverence. The deport-&#xD;
ment of Mrs. flammond was the reverse of this; but.&#xD;
it was so full of a dignity jealous of assault, and reso-&#xD;
lute against intrusion; so cold in its stateliness, so steru&#xD;
in its simplicity, that ouP heroine, though vexed at the&#xD;
bearing of her" step-mother, was not less chilled and&#xD;

&#xD;
offended by that of her visitor. We need not detail the&#xD;
progress of the interview. The call was a very short&#xD;
one, and the parties separated mutually dissatisfied.&#xD;
Mrs. Hammond, chafed with the impertinence ~of Mrs.&#xD;
Foster, and disposed to see in Geraldine (who had been&#xD;
very quiet) nothing but the susceptible creature whom&#xD;
the step-mother had fashioned in all respects to resem-&#xD;
ble herself; while the latterthough not exactly satisfied&#xD;
with herself, was yet confirmed in all her grudges and&#xD;
ancient hosLilities, as she felt the cold supremacy of&#xD;
that bearing which she had bullied, without being able&#xD;
to forsake or overcome.&#xD;
"There," said she to Geraldine, when her visitor, had&#xD;
been bowed down the steps; "there you have her in full;&#xD;
the queen of Sheba, with her head in the clouds and&#xD;
her fs~et among the stars. She's as proud as Lucifer.&#xD;
You'd have a fine chance with her as a mother-in-law.&#xD;
She'd rule you with a rod of iron. Do you smile, it's a&#xD;
look; do you laugh, it's a scold; would you dance, it's a&#xD;
sermon; and so day by day, until you're broken down&#xD;
with the sulks and sours: no milk could keep sweet&#xD;
long under that face of vinegar."&#xD;
Geraldine was silent. She, too, had been disappointed&#xD;
the visit. She could see that there was something&#xD;
wrong in the carriage and language of her mother; but&#xD;
unfortunately, her ear had become too much habituated&#xD;
to the modes of speech and thinking of the 'latter to&#xD;
feel, in full force, the improprieties of her conduct; and&#xD;
she regarded the stern deportment of Mrs. Hammond as&#xD;
totally unprovoked by~anything that had taken place.&#xD;
She was quite, ignorant of that past history of the step-&#xD;
mother which their visitor knew too well, and it was&#xD;
really in some degree as the sincere friend of Geral-&#xD;
dine's own mother that the soul of the old' lady revolted.&#xD;
~t her substitute. But this the young lady was, yet to&#xD;
learn. She, as we have said, was silent; while Mrs~&#xD;
Foster ran, on in a strain cunningly calculated at once&#xD;
to express her own hostility and to alarm the fears of&#xD;
Geraldine. She painted the tyrannical mother of Ham-&#xD;
&#xD;
mond subduing all the spirit of his young wife, of any&#xD;
wife whom he should bring home; restraining all her&#xD;
innocent desires, chiding her sentiments, and keeping&#xD;
her in such a bondage to her antiquated notions, as&#xD;
would effectually quell all her sweetest impulses, and&#xD;
embitter all her youth with the mere caprices of author-&#xD;
ity. From the mother she passed, by a natural tran-&#xD;
sition, to the son. He was the true child of his&#xD;
mother; cold, 'stern, unbending, despotic. She was&#xD;
eloquent on this theme; she recalled and dwelt upon,~&#xD;
with perverse ingenuity, every incident that could serve&#xD;
for its illustration,' and it was only when she broke down&#xD;
with utter exhaustion that she ~was content to stop.&#xD;
Poor Geraldine said nothing. She was certainly im-&#xD;
pressed by what she heard. The speech of Mrs. Foster&#xD;
was not without ingenuity. Yet the girl thought of&#xD;
Hammond with kindly feelings. lit was only when her&#xD;
temper was roused that she was' disposed to side com-&#xD;
pletely 'with 'her cunning and dishonest counsellor.&#xD;
Somehow, she could not concur with her now, even in&#xD;
respect to the stately mother. Though chilled to the&#xD;
heart by the progress) of the interview, she yet remem-&#xD;
bered the sweetness with which-it had begun.&#xD;
How different had been the deportment of the 'old&#xD;
lady before her step.moth'er made her appearance t&#xD;
How kindly had she spoken; with what affectionate re-&#xD;
membrance did she seem to dwell on the personal appear-&#xD;
ance and the virtues of her mother; , surely, she&#xD;
had seen the gathering tears in her soft blue' eyes at&#xD;
the very moment when she felt thatcher own were filling.&#xD;
Whence, then, the change.~ how could the appearance&#xD;
of her step-mother have effected it? T~iere was a nays-&#xD;
tery in this, and' the aroused heart of Geraldine brooded&#xD;
over it; and~ daily, with an increasing pleasure, did she&#xD;
remember The' sweet words and the sad tears which the&#xD;
mother of Hammond ha'd shared with herself when the&#xD;
two were alone together. '&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
SOME TALK OF MARRIAGE.&#xD;
BUT an event was now at hand which was calculated&#xD;
to divert the thoughts of Geraldine Foster into other&#xD;
channels. Her seventeenth birthday was approaching,&#xD;
a period of immense importance to all young damsels.&#xD;
It was destined to be regarded as such in the present&#xD;
instance.. Already, for more than a month previous,&#xD;
the rumor had gone abroad through the neighboring&#xD;
country, of a great fete to be given at the "Lodge."&#xD;
Supplies for the occasiofl were already making their&#xD;
appearance. Wagons from Savannah and Augusta,&#xD;
ladei~ with good things, were seen arriving, and public&#xD;
expectation was on tiptoe for the event. In due season&#xD;
our young men were all honored with invitations to the&#xD;
birthday f~te9 Mrs. Hammond was also included in&#xD;
this compliment, though Mrs. Foster was pleased to say,&#xD;
while her step-daughter was penning the invitation, that&#xD;
she knew "very wet that the haughty old hag would&#xD;
never come again." She was mistaken, as we shall see&#xD;
hereafter. Th&amp;amp;truth is, as regards herself and her own&#xD;
feelings, it neVer would have been the wish of Mrs. Ham-&#xD;
mond to darken the doors of a lady like Mrs. Foster,&#xD;
for whom she could never feel esteem; but the case was&#xD;
~altered in respect to Geraldine. She regarded the&#xD;
latter as the innocent, though perhaps misguided child&#xD;
of a very dear friend, 'and~ on this account alone she&#xD;
was prepared to treat3 her with solicitous considera-&#xD;
tion. There was yet a better reason. Mrs. Hammond&#xD;
had now satisfied herself that the affections of her son&#xD;
were really engaged to the maiden; too deeply engaged,&#xD;
indeed, to render prudent any farther exhortations and&#xD;
&#xD;
warnings on her part. She resolved, therefore, instead&#xD;
of discouraging with a vain importunity his pursuit of&#xD;
the object, to yield herself to his cause, and contribute,.&#xD;
as far as it would be becoming in her, to the promotion&#xD;
of his wishes. She distinguished, accordingly, between&#xD;
the girl and the silly step-mother; and, while.revolting at&#xD;
the offensive frivolities and forwardnesses of~the latter,&#xD;
was prepared to take the other, as the future wife of her&#xD;
son, to her most affectionate embraces. This determi-&#xD;
nation led her to accept an invitation which she other~&#xD;
wise might have treated With indifference. It must not&#xD;
be supposed, however, because we find Mrs. iEoster speak..~&#xD;
ing in offensive terms of Mrs. Hammond, that the visit&#xD;
of the latter had been disagreeable to her, or that she&#xD;
had failed in returning it. Thj~ was very far, from being&#xD;
the case. While she disliked to meet with the old lady,&#xD;
from a real feeling of inferiority, and 'from a painful con-&#xD;
sciousness that Mrs. Hammond knew more of her real&#xD;
history than anybody else; she yet felt the importance,&#xD;
in a social point of view, of appearing to maintain an&#xD;
intimacy with one of a .i~nk so unquestionable. She&#xD;
soon, with Geraldine, returned the visit in which she had&#xD;
behaved with so mueh insolent familiarity; and was re-&#xD;
ceived with the sweet benignity, mingled with&#xD;
dignity,.&#xD;
which so becomes a well-bred lady in the character of a&#xD;
hostess. Geraldine could not but feel the superiority of&#xD;
bearing in this venerable representative of a passing age,&#xD;
to that to which she was accustomed* and~ could scarcely&#xD;
reconcile the gentleness and meekness of the old iady'~&#xD;
manner and tone with~ that which was so commanding&#xD;
in her carriage and so irnpressiye in what she uttered.&#xD;
True to her decision, and regarding the possible relation&#xD;
in which the maiden might yet stand in regard tQ her&#xD;
son, Mrs. Hammond was particularly anxious to please her&#xD;
younger visitor.. While the three ladies traversed the gar-&#xD;
den, which was a very ample and ~eautiful Qne, she loiter-&#xD;
ed with the younger of the three, and again renewed the&#xD;
subject of her intercourse with her mother. The garden&#xD;
itself afforded a sufficient reason for recalling the ~ubjeot.&#xD;

168&#xD;
&#xD;
AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Hammond's taste for flowers had been greatly in-&#xD;
flueneed by the superior sympathies, for these lovely&#xD;
creations, of the first Mrs. Foster; and it waS in the&#xD;
power of the former to indicate to Geraldine a fact, of&#xD;
which she was now for the first time made conscious,&#xD;
that the garden at the "Lodge" had been laid out&#xD;
exactly of the size and plan of that which she now ex-&#xD;
amined. Its fate, how ever, had been very different.&#xD;
While the latter was blooming in full perfection and&#xD;
variety, the former had grown into a waste with weeds.&#xD;
Geraldine only resolved to make amends to the memory&#xD;
of her mother by restoring her favorite fruits and flowers.&#xD;
The judicious manner of Mrs. Hammond, the equal&#xD;
delicacy and adroitness with which she had again man-&#xD;
aged to speak to the young girl of her mother, and to&#xD;
show the tender. int?~rest which she herself felt for her&#xD;
memory, were by no means thrown away upon the&#xD;
daughter, who was sensibly touched, as well by the&#xD;
manner as by the matter of her venerable hostess. Mrs.&#xD;
Foster beheld this with some~ disquiet, and more than&#xD;
once contrived to divert the conversation to other and&#xD;
far less interesting topics. She herself was treated&#xD;
'with the greatest deference, Mrs. Hammond being at&#xD;
pains, for the sake of the ward, to treat the guardian as'&#xD;
if she fully deserved to be such a custodian. At the end&#xD;
of an hour, the visitors were prepared to depart, and&#xD;
Randall Hammond made his appearance just in time to&#xD;
see the ladies to the carriage.&#xD;
A few days after came the invitation to the f~$te.&#xD;
"You will go, dear mother, will you not ?" was the&#xD;
inquiry of Hammond, uttered in pleading accents. She&#xD;
was disposed to plague him, and expressed herself&#xD;
doubtfully.&#xD;
"' I don't know. II am old~ These night parties are&#xD;
not good for me, and I don't enjoy them."&#xD;
"But, for my sake, mother."&#xD;
I' I don't~ know but that, for your sake, I ought to&#xD;

of the step-mother. I'm only going to propose now, to&#xD;
get my answer; I don't seethat I've the least chance&#xD;
or hope. She treats me civilly, and Mi's. Foster is a&#xD;
great deal more kind to me than she is to you; but,&#xD;
after all,' though I try hard to find a meaning' in this&#xD;
civility, 'it amounts only to this, that I 'don't behave&#xD;
amiss, and the attention' ef &amp;amp; young fellow is never dis.&#xD;
agreeable to a miss. But the suspense and anxiety vex&#xD;
me,' aud'so I'm going to make an end of it, and either&#xD;
make the spoon or spoil the horn."&#xD;
"With such feelings, Miles, I should not prcpoae;&#xD;
but 'the subject is one which I dare not undertake to&#xD;
counsel you upon. You will, of course,. do as you&#xD;
~"Oh!' I'm sworn to give in this paper. There may&#xD;
be more hope than I have reason for; A man, who is&#xD;
really in love, can't always seehis chances for himself;&#xD;
and. GeraldinC Foster is 'the first and only woman I've&#xD;
eve)! seen that I really wished to marry.' I'll try her,&#xD;
at 'all events'; and if'nothi'ng better comes of the trial, it&#xD;
will at once put an end toiny anxiety."&#xD;
"Be it so, ;Miles.~ You hear' 'what I tell you. I&#xD;
prepare no letter. I'll leave it to circumstances&#xD;
to determine. If opportunity offers, and she seems fa~&#xD;
vorable, 'ten to one that I shall declare myself. If not,&#xD;
I have only to keep quiet and wait a better, season."&#xD;
"Yes; but you may wait too long. 'Spose she takes&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"My dear Miles, she couldn't take a better fellow.&#xD;
Next to myself, I should rejoice to see you in possession&#xD;
'of' the' prize.".&#xD;
~tBut suppose, seeing no ehanee of you, 'and tired of&#xD;
waiting, she takes this beauty, Barry ?"&#xD;
"Then he's ~welcome"to her, and she wouldn't be the&#xD;
woman "for me. I ~ho~ld rejQice in' my escape."&#xD;
"Randall, you're a cursed Bight too proud.','&#xD;
"No, Miles, I only put' .a proper value upon a wife.&#xD;
The girl who is in' sttch' haste to get a husband as to&#xD;
&#xD;
marry any that offers rather than lose a chance is worth&#xD;
no man's having."&#xD;
"I don't know but you're right."&#xD;
While upon this fruitful subject, let 'us pass from the&#xD;
two friends to another of 'the parties' to our story, WhOsQ&#xD;
feelings, about this period, were similarly' concerned&#xD;
with the fair Geraldine, and the approaching festivities..&#xD;
Sunday was usually 'chosen' by our excellent acquaint-&#xD;
ance, 'Jones Barry, for his dinners. 'He was then apt&#xD;
to call in~his acquaintance, to see his' friends, and make&#xD;
a day 'of it. He never denied, himself on the~e 4ays.&#xD;
He was a bachelor, a man of wealth, and enjoyed a cer-&#xD;
tam degree of impunity. He at least assumed that&#xD;
one, whose behavior was so uniformly good during the&#xD;
week, should be permitted his 'enjoyments on the Sab-&#xD;
bath. ~Of course, we quarrel with no man for his opi~~&#xD;
ions. We are' indulgent, and only propose to show his&#xD;
practice under them.&#xD;
Jones Barry had a cleverish cook, who could make&#xD;
mock turtle to perfection, and dress a haunch of venison&#xD;
to the equal~ satisfaction of epicure and hunter. He&#xD;
loved good things, and never stinted himself at any time;&#xD;
but it was' on Sunday that he' particularly laid himself&#xD;
out to be happy. The first day of the week had come&#xD;
in which the birthday fete of Miss Foster 'was' to be&#xD;
celebrated. He had several guests that day, and an&#xD;
excellent dinner. There was our old friend, Nettles,&#xD;
among the former, ~o whom one end of the table was&#xD;
assigned. Joe Blake; Dick Moore, and Tom Lechmere&#xD;
formed the rest of the company. The dinner passed off&#xD;
gloriously. When the cloth was 'rein oved, the host;&#xD;
raising his glass, cried-&#xD;
"Fill, gentlemen, and 'drink to the health of'the f~iit&#xD;
Geraldine."&#xD;
"Lady or filly ?" inquired Nettles.&#xD;
"Oomne, Tom, don't be disrespectful. She may yet&#xD;
be my wife."&#xD;
Nettles repeated the question.&#xD;
"Lady or filly, Jones?"&#xD;

"You're a beast," cried Barry; "drink before I send&#xD;
the bottle at your head."&#xD;
"t~o nothing of the kind, I beg, until you've emptied&#xD;
it at least. j3ut still let me ask. I drink, you see; for&#xD;
it matters' not much to your friends whom you marry;&#xD;
but, whi~h is it~J~nes? We kn6w you love the lady, at&#xD;
least you say so~ a~d it's very certain to everybody that&#xD;
you. really by the mare., Now,, if a I~oman emperor&#xD;
made ,one of lAs mares a divinity,, and fed. it ou silver&#xD;
crowfoot and golden ears, handsomely cracked,, in a&#xD;
iuiarbie basin, there's no reason why a Georgia planter&#xD;
shouldn't promote his filly by marriage."&#xD;
"Psha~! that's all nonsense about the Roman em.&#xD;
peror."&#xD;
"True, every bit of it, except that I have ~ny doubts&#xD;
about the gender of the beast.' But tell us truly. Out&#xD;
with it like a man. Are you to be married to the fair&#xD;
"To the lady, perhaps."&#xD;
"Not exactly, 'but so nigh there's no fun in it."&#xD;
, "AhI then you have prQposed, Jones?"&#xD;
"No-~-not to Geraldiue herself, but the mother goes&#xD;
for me.&#xD;
"But 'that's not the daughter.",&#xD;
"It'.s something towards the election."&#xD;
"Don't believe a word of it, Jones," answered the&#xD;
reckless Nettles. "It's like your racehorse 'calculations.&#xD;
You'll be beaten when you're most certain.~~&#xD;
"And who's tobeat me, do you think ?"&#xD;
"Why Ran. ~~~mond, to be sure."&#xD;
"He! he stajids no more chance than my grandmother.&#xD;
Why, Mrs. Foster hates him as she does ~Olson.~~&#xD;
"What of that? I can tell you she wouldn't hate him&#xD;
long, if he was willing to marry her insteadof the daughter.&#xD;
But her hate don't hurt. ' That girl has a will of her&#xD;
own, if ever woman had; and Madam Foster's dislikes&#xD;
won't ~help your likes, I can tell you."&#xD;
"She as good as tells me I'm sure of ~Geraldine."&#xD;

"Do you really think so, Torn?' You are"a judge."&#xD;
"You do-only you keep it always too near 'your o*n&#xD;

"There it is-Blake, hand that bottle to the ox.".&#xD;
"Ox! well, I suppose it is because 'I'm an ox that&#xD;
you offer me ahorn."&#xD;
"Take two of them, that you may be~ finished."&#xD;
"But I'll not finish there."&#xD;
"'Go ahead!"&#xD;
"Well, as I was saying, I like you and your dinners&#xD;

you have too great fondness for women of the circus.&#xD;
"Tom! Tom!. mum! Honor bright, old fellow."~&#xD;

the rest.&#xD;
"Another time, boys, another time. 'Let's see, wh&amp;amp;re&#xD;

"Hera's to Ran. Hammond; a stiff fellow, perhaps,&#xD;
but a real man and a true gentleman."&#xD;
Jones Barry gulped and swallowed ~with the rest.&#xD;

of anything Ran. Hammond can do in this affair."'&#xD;

THE DIRTUDAY FETE.&#xD;
TPE decision 9f' Miles Henderson was precisely that&#xD;
of Jones Barry. He had preparedd himself, under the&#xD;
special instructions of Mrs. Foster, to make his propo-&#xD;
sals to the fi~~r Geraldine, on the occasion of h~r birth-&#xD;
day. That excellent lady, the step-mother, had seve~'ai&#xD;
private conferences with this faVored suitor, without the&#xD;
knowledge of' the young lady. In these conversations,&#xD;
she particularly encouraged his hopes, and enjoiii~d'&#xD;
upon him the experiment during the progress of the&#xD;
festivities. She did not tell him upon what she 'had&#xD;
based her calculations of success, ~robab~y with~ some&#xD;
just apprehensions In regard to his ~~udence ; but she&#xD;
might 'have trusted him; for, 'in all' his revelations to&#xD;
his cOmpaniotis oVer the bottle, he never yiel4~d' up&#xD;
hjs secrets entirely. lie still kept something to him-&#xD;
self, following the eounsel:&amp;amp;f' Burns-.-.-which 'even iL~om&#xD;
Nettles, who wormed a good deal out of him without&#xD;
Seeming to ~design? it, could never sticceed in extracting&#xD;
from his tongue., lit is probable that the calculations&#xD;
of Mrs. Foster were not remarkable for their profundity;&#xD;
yet they might have been sufficient, for all that, fo~r&#xD;
the purpose she had in coi~tempk1tion." Sh~ probably&#xD;
designed nothing more than so to vex the ~apricious&#xD;

&#xD;
only gave more life to the proceedings. The drum be-&#xD;
came, in a little time, too useful for dismission.&#xD;
Mrs. Hammond arrived at an early hour. Her son&#xD;
did not then accompany~ her. He was governed in this&#xD;
delay by motives 'which we may conjecture from what&#xD;
we have heard him say, on a previous occasion, to his&#xD;
friend Henderson. It was his policy not to seem too&#xD;
anxious. His mother's motive' for coming early was&#xD;
that she might not 'stay late. She did not come seek-&#xD;
ing amusement, and she designed returning home before&#xD;
the day was out. It was in compliment to the lady,&#xD;
who might yet be her son's wife, that she came at all.&#xD;
She was received respectfully by Geraldine, and civilly&#xD;
enough by Mrs. Foster. The latter was too greatly in&#xD;
her glory not to seem amiable that day. Her vanity&#xD;
was in full exercise, to enable her to play her part with&#xD;
suavity and grace.-&#xD;
Of course, we cannot pretend to describe the persons.&#xD;
'present. They were very numerous, not less than two&#xD;
hundred and fifty having been invited. All, certainly,&#xD;
did not attend; but there were some who came without&#xD;
being conscious of the necessity of being asked; and&#xD;
these were usually the most conspicuous and active ~n&#xD;
their attentions to themselves and one another. 04r&#xD;
amiable friend Miles Henderson, and our humorous&#xD;
friend Jones' Barry, arrived at the same moment; the&#xD;
latter accompanied by his Mephistopheles, Tom Nettles.&#xD;
It was with a slight shade upon her brow that Geral-&#xD;
dine observed that Henderson came alone. She had&#xD;
looked, as a matter of course, that hammond would ac-&#xD;
company Henderson. Her mother saw the expression&#xD;
in her countenance, and. remtuirkecl,. in- an under tone, as&#xD;
Miles rode up-.-.&#xD;
"So, his friend's not with him. I doubt if he comes&#xD;
at all. His pride would scarcely al-low him to do any-&#xD;
thing which seemed to do us honor."&#xD;
"But his ,piother's here," whispered Geraldine.&#xD;
"To spy out the poverty of the land, and to go home&#xD;
and. sneer. We haven't such a display of plate as~ the&#xD;

Hammonds can set out; and she will have her say about&#xD;
the difference between old times, when she was every-&#xD;
body, and now when other people want to be some-&#xD;
body."&#xD;
"Mother, you are too harsh 1"&#xD;
"Too harsh! Well, you can make up for it by being&#xD;
too tender! We'll see yet if the soft lie~art of the&#xD;
woman proves too weak for the arrogant pride of the&#xD;
man."&#xD;
The daughter felt the imputation, and turned away&#xD;
with an expressive smile upon her lips. The mother&#xD;
knew the meaning and the value of that smile, and she&#xD;
was satisfied. Pride was the weakness of Geraldine;&#xD;
and upon this characteristic the cunning woman played.&#xD;
She knew that while she kept this feeling sore and&#xD;
irritable, her schemes were in no danger; and she knew&#xD;
enough of Hammond's character, and suspected enough&#xD;
of his policy, to believe that he would be more likely to&#xD;
increase this irritability of her daughter's mood than&#xD;
to soothe or overcome it. We shall see whose politics&#xD;
were the wisest.&#xD;
The greater portion of the company having arrived,&#xD;
the grounds began to be filled with groups, detaching&#xD;
themselves from the mass, each for the gratification of&#xD;
his or her peculiar sympathies. Some of the younger&#xD;
damsels might be seen swinging or skipping rope under&#xD;
the shade-trees, with a fair sprinkling of dapper young&#xD;
lads to devour, with greedy looks of love, their several&#xD;
movements and devices. Here and there; along the&#xD;
avenue, might be seen a whizzing ball, in the hurling&#xD;
of which the youngsters were the performers, and the&#xD;
ladies were lookers on; while tables, spread convenient-&#xD;
ly, offered cakes and lemonade as refreshments to the&#xD;
languid and exhausted. But anon, the drum gave the&#xD;
gratuitous signal, and the clarinet and violin led the&#xD;
way for a procession. The swing and rope were aban~&#xD;
doned in a moment, the ball received its last cast. The&#xD;
youth of both sexes came together, and paired off, by a&#xD;
very natural movement, which showed how sympathetic&#xD;
&#xD;
were the instincts of both parties; and away they&#xD;
march in a procession which led through a beautiful&#xD;
avenue of oaks and cedars.. It was at this moment, and&#xD;
while our young friend Jones Barry, being plucked'&#xD;
by the* sleeve by Mrs. Foster, was breaking away from&#xD;
the society of Tom Nettles, and rushing forward to&#xD;
offer his arm to Geraldine, that Randall Hammond. was&#xD;
seen suddenly to glide from under a clump of shade-&#xD;
trees, near the avenue, and anticipate his intentions.&#xD;
Geraldine certainly did not, in her countenance, reflect&#xD;
the spite which was apparent in the visage of the mo-&#xD;
ther, at this moment, to Tom Nettles, who muttered to&#xD;
himself with that sort of grin and chuckle which the&#xD;
man of mischief puts on when he sees sport.&#xD;
"It sticks, old lady, does it? and so it should. Ran.&#xD;
Hammond is the lad to conquer both of you."&#xD;
his sneer and feeling did not prevent him from play-&#xD;
ing the gallant with the very lady whose vexation had&#xD;
so much pleased him. While the anger was yet quiver-&#xD;
ing on her lip, he drew nigh, and, with the sweetest&#xD;
smile in the world, and the nicest compliment, he&#xD;
tendered her his arm; which, as he was a most comely&#xD;
person and a moderately young bachelor, the judicious&#xD;
lady at once frankly accepted.&#xD;
"Really," said he, "Mrs. Foster, you are in every&#xD;
respect fortunate. The day is just the day for such a&#xD;
fete, and it is no discredit to the company to say that'&#xD;
it is worthy of your arrangements. I need not say that&#xD;
they are worthy of any company.&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Nettles, you overwhelm while you delight&#xD;
me&#xD;
"True in every respect, my dear madam. I never&#xD;
saw so excellent and large a collection of fine people&#xD;
before in the county. I could scarcely have thought,&#xD;
indeed, that the county could boast of so many fashion-&#xD;
able-looking people.'.'&#xD;
"Nor does it, Mr. Nettles 1" answered the lady, with&#xD;
a delighted smile. "In some instances, I have gone out&#xD;
of the county for my guests."&#xD;
"That explains it," said he, quietly, as if assured&#xD;

and satisfied. "Miss Foster," he continued, "is a beau-&#xD;
tiful creature. They would make a noble couple."&#xD;
The motion of his hand was in the direction of Geral-&#xD;
dine and Eammond, who were just wheeling out of sight&#xD;
in a turn of the avenue. The remark, which he well&#xD;
knew was wormwood to his hearer, remained unanswered.&#xD;
Kettles was a man to dash his bitter usually with some&#xD;
sweet; though, perhaps, the bitter was apt, finally, to&#xD;
preponderate.&#xD;
"But it is the ~nisfortune of young persons, who have&#xD;
no guardians sufficiently their seniors to command their&#xD;
veneration, to be perverse in such matters. I should&#xD;
fear that Miss Foster is too decidedly your companion&#xD;
to be sensible of your authority."&#xD;
"There is some truth in what you say, Mr. Nettles,&#xD;
though, as her proper guardian, I ought not to confess&#xD;
it. But, the fact is that, when I yielded to the entrea-&#xD;
ties of Mr. Foster, I was but a child myself."&#xD;
The words passed through the brain, but did not find&#xD;
their way to the tongue of Nettles: "Pretty well grown,&#xD;
and honestly twenty~eight, if old grandmother Crowell&#xD;
knew anything about it." He did not suffer any pause&#xD;
for reflection, as he answered"-.&#xD;
"The county proverb is a true one, I'm afraid, Mrs.&#xD;
Foster."&#xD;
"What proverb, Mr. Nettles ?"&#xD;
"That which says that the mothers are only the elder&#xD;
sisters of the daughters, and that the widows are always&#xD;
in the way of the virgins !"&#xD;
"But you don't believe it, Mr. Nettles ?"&#xD;
"At this moment, I have every reason to do so;&#xD;
and the 'grateful lady was not unconscious of the slight&#xD;
contracting pressure upon her own of the arm in which&#xD;
it rested. The thought irresistibly forced itself upon&#xD;
her--.&#xD;
"How strar~ge that Mr. Nettles shouldn't have thought&#xD;
of a wife. Certainly, it's high time for 'him to do so, if&#xD;
he ever means to get one."&#xD;
Nettles was a famous mocker, but we must follow the&#xD;
&#xD;
company rather than the conversation. The procession&#xD;
continued through most delightful groves, all the way&#xD;
to the mill-seat of Gushlynn. On the route, the young&#xD;
people sported like so many kids. Conspicuous among&#xD;
these was Jones Barry; who, playing his antics directly&#xD;
in the sight of Geraldine Foster, might, if he had been&#xD;
sufficiently observant and sagacious, have seen upon her&#xD;
countenance a scorn quite as expressive as that with&#xD;
which Michal saluted David when she saw him dancing&#xD;
along tha highways.' Geraldine, in respect of pride, was&#xD;
no bad representative of Saul's daughter. Barry was&#xD;
the centre of a bevy of fat girls, whose dimensions some-&#xD;
what reminded him of the barkeeper's daughter, whom&#xD;
Nettles had counselled him to choose for a wife. It was&#xD;
evident that he was not less a favorite among them,&#xD;
because he consented to play antics in their eight. He&#xD;
might have had his choice among them, without leaving&#xD;
the rejected any better satisfied, or worse off.. Miles&#xD;
Henderson revolved near Geraldine, but as an escort to&#xD;
one of the Baileys, a quiet, dignified girl, one of the&#xD;
three or four whom Mrs. hammond 'was~ not unwilling&#xD;
that her son should espouse. The procession passed&#xD;
forward, the music still vibrated along the groves, and&#xD;
soon the groups began to arrive at the beautiful place&#xD;
chosen for the picnic, the fine park of open pines which&#xD;
spread along at the foot of the falling waters of Gush-&#xD;
lynn. This was an abandoned mill-seat, the great dam&#xD;
and floodgate of which were still' maintained in repair;&#xD;
the former being a broad carriage-track, overgrown on&#xD;
each side and perfectly shaded by great evergreens,~ the&#xD;
water-oak, the cedar, and several other trees; while the&#xD;
floodgate afforded a pretty and picturesque fall of water,&#xD;
whose torrents were always making a pleasant murmur&#xD;
for the groves. Above the dam lay an immense sheet&#xD;
of several thousand acres, several feet deep, of water;&#xD;
while below, the falling surplus found its way, after&#xD;
passing the wreck of the old mill-house, into a sweet little&#xD;
lake, which was sufficiently deep for midsummer bathing.&#xD;
This too was surrounded by an ample shade of evergreens,&#xD;

&#xD;
and the tot~t ensemble presented one of those lovely pictures&#xD;
of united elevation, water, and shade-tree which, after all,&#xD;
present the most durable materials for the landscape&#xD;
painter. Here' then, along the mill-dam, in the shade of&#xD;
the pine woods below, and at intervals around the reserve&#xD;
and the lakelet Qf discharged waters, our company dis-&#xD;
persed themselves, each after hi~ own fashion seeking&#xD;
pleasure. Here again the swing was found, as well of&#xD;
rope as of great grape-vines on which the young dam-&#xD;
sels reclined, and in which they were rocked occasionally&#xD;
by the eager hands of the dutiful young men. Here,&#xD;
too, the ball was again put in requisition among the&#xD;
more athletic, who darted tifrough the wide green&#xD;
avenues in graceful flight, or hurried in pursuit, with&#xD;
good-natured fury. Some of the young ladies did not&#xD;
scorn to engage in the play, though it was observed&#xD;
that all who did so had previously taken the precaution&#xD;
of wearing short frocks and ample pantalettes. These&#xD;
nice little appendages of the petticoats, it wa~ perhaps&#xD;
censoriously remarked by some of the elder maidens,&#xD;
were worn quite gratuitously by several who in no other&#xD;
way could be suspected of being still in miniature girl-&#xD;
hood. But this matter does not concern us. 'It may&#xD;
be well, however, to state that geraldine, whatever&#xD;
might have been the imputations upon her eccentricity,&#xD;
was not seen to participate in any of these wilder exer-&#xD;
cises, though her excellent step-mother frequently urged.&#xD;
it upon. her, and stoutly seconded the entreaties of our&#xD;
friend Barry, who challenged her to a. match. at rope4&#xD;
skipping. That the eye of Hammond and his mother&#xD;
were bGth upon her, all the while, with some curiosity,&#xD;
did not discourage Mrs. roster from her object. On&#xD;
the contrary, somewhat stimulated by seeing that they&#xD;
watched the daughter, she was more than ever anxious&#xD;
to persuade her to. the exhibitions of the hoyden. We&#xD;
have already some knowledge of her policy. It did not&#xD;
succeed in thi"s instance, even though, stung by refusal,&#xD;
she said bitterly, as she turned' away from the girl:&#xD;
"Well, you are perhaps right. 1 see that the Queen&#xD;
&#xD;
of Sheba, and her ~wise Solomon, are both watching you.&#xD;
They would never countenance, I suppc~se, any such in~&#xD;
nocent practices."&#xD;
The high-spirited girl was half tempted to whirl away&#xD;
upon the rope, or to seize, and wing, and pursue. the&#xD;
ball,. as she heard this imputation upon her courage; but&#xD;
she too had her reflections, and prudently forbore.&#xD;
Indeed, she now began to feel, not only that she had&#xD;
something at stake, but that her stepmother was neither&#xD;
the most wise nor the most disinterested of counsellors.&#xD;
Barry, sustained by her guardian, she began to feel was&#xD;
something of a bore; and she was conscious of a purpose,&#xD;
which she now perforce maintained, which would suf-&#xD;
ficiently try the sense of propriety as well in Hammond&#xD;
as his mother. But of this hereafter. It is certain&#xD;
that she refused to do the graces on the skipping-rope,&#xD;
or the fairies in pursuit of the flying ball. She con~&#xD;
ducted herself with a demureness which, while it vexed&#xD;
her mother, was quite satisfactory to other parties; and&#xD;
Mrs. Hammond returned home, at an early hour in the&#xD;
day, much better reconciled 'to the 'object of her son's&#xD;
admiration than she was before she came.&#xD;
Meanwhile, the business of the day proceeded with&#xD;
pleasure, as it had begun. Dinner was spread under&#xD;
the shade of the great trees; a well-considered repast,&#xD;
in which the provision was ample, and in good taste.&#xD;
In this matter, Mrs. Foster received no small assistance&#xD;
from her daughter, who had brought to her knowledge&#xD;
the refinements of the ancient and elegant city of Savan-&#xD;
nah. When one of the plain country ladiesof the past&#xD;
generation beheld, for the first time, a display of silver&#xD;
forks, and silver fish and butter-knives, she exclaimed,&#xD;
with looks of genuine apprehension,. "'.1 reckon the&#xD;
widow must have 6roke Savannah !*"&#xD;
The fruits of the West Indies had been brought to&#xD;
grace the repast. There were. 'oranges and lemons,&#xD;
plantains and bananas; pineapples and cocoanuts. There&#xD;
were preserved fruits and foreign cordials, and a very&#xD;
generous supply of champagne; a beverage which most&#xD;

&#xD;
effectually entrapped, to their overthrow, sundry per-&#xD;
sons who had never drank any beverage of similar&#xD;
flavor more grateful than "persimmon beer." Our&#xD;
friend, Jones IBarry, through. the agency of Mrs. Foster,&#xD;
was a conspicuous person in the order of the exercises.&#xD;
lie was rather a volunteer, when the champagne-corks&#xD;
were to be sprung, his whole soul being surrendered to&#xD;
the happiness of seeing the young ladies start with sur-&#xD;
prise at a sound which was so unwanted from such a&#xD;
source. We must add that his practice was scarcely so&#xD;
innocent when he busied himself in decoying the same&#xD;
simple damsels to such free draughts of the liquor as&#xD;
rendered them scarcely less ridiculous than himself.&#xD;
That mischievous creature, Tom. Nettles, was busy,&#xD;
however, in playing upon Barry the same game which&#xD;
he played upon the girls, and he watched with no little&#xD;
pleasure the uncertain strides which the latter took&#xD;
among the several groups which he haunted, while his&#xD;
voice equally increased in thickness and rapidity. These&#xD;
ludicrous proceedings, however, were about to ufxdergo&#xD;
a change. Tliere is scarcely any human pleasure, as&#xD;
we know which can be considered certain for three&#xD;
hours together. Our hero, Barry, in the midst of his&#xD;
merriment, suddenly remembered that he had a serious&#xD;
business before him; a look and a whisper from Mrs.&#xD;
Foster drew his attention to Geraldine, who had wan-&#xD;
dered off with Miles Henderson to the ancient mill-site,&#xD;
and was now to be seen at the extremity of one of the&#xD;
remaining beams - or sleepers. The torrent ran at&#xD;
considerable depth below.- Beside her, stood Miles&#xD;
Henderson. He seemed abQut to leave her; and, with&#xD;
the words, "Now's your time," Mrs. Foster left Barry&#xD;
to pursi~e his purpose.&#xD;
'-Barry, who was a creature of simple impulses, imme-&#xD;
diately started away, and, in his passage up the mill-&#xD;
dam, met Miles Henderson returning alone. Poor&#xD;
Miles had giveh in his petition, but without waiting or&#xD;
seeking for a present answer. He only implored that&#xD;
Miss Foster would read his billet at the first opportu-&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE TE~1NESSEI~AN' S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
189&#xD;
&#xD;
nity, and communicate her reply as soon as possible.'&#xD;
He muttered something about anxiety an&amp;amp; suspense; but&#xD;
he was rather unintelligible to himself, and he could not&#xD;
trust himself to be more explicit. He was crossing the&#xD;
mill-bank quietly, without seeking to attract attention,&#xD;
and was just about to descend to th~ plain, when Barry&#xD;
appeared below. The latter, however, perceiving the&#xD;
object whom he was pursuing to be still lingering at&#xD;
the end of the great sleeper which crossed the chasm,&#xD;
one end resting upon the bank and the other upon the&#xD;
opposite foundations of the mill-house, proceeded to take&#xD;
the shortest route for reaching her, and, instead of keep-&#xD;
ing the bank, he darted aside, and was in a few moments&#xD;
seen upon the sleeper. The height was a dizzy one, and&#xD;
so was the head of the daring suitor. Miss Foster, seeing&#xD;
his approach, hastily thrust the note of Henderson into&#xD;
her bcsom. At this moment, and when he was half&#xD;
way across the passage, he begati to fumble in~ his own&#xD;
bosom, and before he or anybody could conjecture his&#xD;
peril, he toppled suddenly, lost his balance, and went over,&#xD;
kicking and floundering with ineffectual struggles, into&#xD;
the boiling waters below. Fortunately, they were deep&#xD;
enough to break his fall, which was some twelve or fifteen&#xD;
feet, and he disappeared, headforemost, in the petty gulf.&#xD;
Geraldine screamed aloud, for she saw the accident&#xD;
instantly, and the scream was echoed by a dozen other&#xD;
pretty damsels on the opposite side. It required but afew&#xD;
moments to make the event known among the crowd,&#xD;
and twenty seconds had not elapsed before Tom Nettles&#xD;
and Randall Hammond had made their way to the edge&#xD;
of the lake, where Barry was now struggling with very&#xD;
ineffectual efforts, his wine being diluted, seemingly, to&#xD;
the entire defeat of his energies, by the disproportionate&#xD;
quantity of the inferior liquid which he had swallowed&#xD;
after it perforce. A couple of long-pointed poles hap~&#xD;
pened to be convenient, and were seized in the same&#xD;
instant by Hammond and Nettles. With these they&#xD;
fished the poor fellow up by his clothes, to the bank,&#xD;
the mischievous Nettles contriving, more than once,&#xD;

&#xD;
by seemingly awkward movements, to thrust him down&#xD;
into the lake just when he expected to be out of it. It&#xD;
was in vain that Hammond honestly labored to get the&#xD;
gallant upon his legs. It happened, unfortunately for&#xD;
Barry, that his head lay nearest to Nettles; and the&#xD;
wi~ful agitation of the latter, with his pole thrust into&#xD;
the breast of ]3arry's coat, succeeded in giving him seve-&#xD;
ral severe dips before he was finally extricated.&#xD;
"Whoo! Tom! What the devil, man! would you&#xD;
drown me in a mill-pond ?"&#xD;
"N Jones, my dear fellow; but I'm quite nervous&#xD;
at your situation-quite."&#xD;
And, as he spoke, the head of the unfortunate took&#xD;
another plunge, at the very moment when Hammond&#xD;
was drawing him ashore by the leg. He came forth&#xD;
looking aghast, shook himself like a water-dog, and it&#xD;
was then seen, for th&amp;amp; first time, that he held a letter&#xD;
ch~sped in his hand.&#xD;
Why, Jones, what have you got there 2" demanded&#xD;
Nettles.&#xD;
"A letter !" and, with the words, he cast his eye up&#xD;
to the head of the mill-seat, as if still looking for Ge-&#xD;
raldine. But she was no longer in sight.&#xD;
"A letter! Where the deuce did you get it 2-at&#xD;
the bottom of the lake 2"&#xD;
"IDon't ask me, old fellow. I'm no better than a&#xD;
heathen icicle. I'm chilled to the heart. Get me into&#xD;
the bushes, and bring me a bottle of champagne."&#xD;
"A good brandy~toddy would be better," said the&#xD;
&amp;amp;ther, while he hurried off. Hammond then conducted&#xD;
him into the woods, while he summoned his servant to&#xD;
go off for fresh clothing.&#xD;
"Won't you go home yourself', Barry ?" demanded&#xD;
Nettles, when he returned, having first administered his&#xD;
drink.&#xD;
"No; I feel' better now.' I shall be dry soon. Here,&#xD;
Tony-[to the boy in waiting]-kindle up a fire, and&#xD;
l~et me know what the natural feeling of dry breeches&#xD;
is. What ad     daffairitis!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Dreadful!" said Nettles. "But that l~tter,~&#xD;
Jones 2"&#xD;
"Oh! if you must see it, there it is."&#xD;
Nettles, reading the address-&#xD;
"To Miss Geraldine. Foster," &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
At these words, Hammond disappeared, leaving the&#xD;
two friends, together. It was night when they showed&#xD;
themselves again, Barry looking as happy as if nothing&#xD;
had happened, and ready for all the grateful intricacies&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
TIlE EVENING OF THE DAY.&#xD;
MRS. FOSTER was greatly discomfited at the disaster&#xD;
of her favorite. She contrived, however, to keep her&#xD;
countenance; an effort of which her daughter was not&#xD;
capable. She, as well as most of the young damsels, as&#xD;
soon as it was discovered, that Barry was in no danger,&#xD;
laughed outright at his predicament, and were extremely&#xD;
amused and interested at the way in which he was fished&#xD;
out of the pond; the particular part taken by Nettles in&#xD;
this delicate operation being very intelligible to most of&#xD;
them. His disappearance in the bushes was followed&#xD;
by a movement of the whole party. The day had passed&#xD;
with great satisfaction to most of the company, and even&#xD;
*     this accident did not materially abate the general satis-&#xD;
faction. The dinner was excellent; the cates, wands,&#xD;
the wines and dessert, in especial, were equally new and&#xD;
grateful to the popular palate; and it was with height-&#xD;
ened feelings of enjoyment, and heightened expectations&#xD;
also, that the guests listened to the signal of the drum,&#xD;
which 'announced the return to the homestead. With&#xD;
flying colors and triumphant music, the gay cavalcade&#xD;
moved forward; but in order very different from that&#xD;
in which they came. There was now more life and im-&#xD;
pulse, and less formality. People are more at home&#xD;
usually after the wine and walnuts; and the chatter was&#xD;
incessant, the laughter wild, and not a few pranks and&#xD;
petty excesses were practiced on the return route among&#xD;
the younger people. Hammond did not now escort Miss&#xD;
Foster. He left that pleasant duty to other gallants,&#xD;
of whom the fair damset had a liberal supply. Hender-&#xD;
son also kept aloof, feeling quite too anxious and too&#xD;
&#xD;
much interested in the result of his application to risk&#xD;
himself near the person who held his fate in her harad8.&#xD;
The return of the party was happily timed to bring.them&#xD;
into the grounds about the "Lodge," just aboutdusk. A&#xD;
fairy scene greeted the eyes of the guests as they now&#xD;
drew nigh. A hundred altars seemed tc~ f~arr~e, at in-&#xD;
tervals, among the trees and along the great avenue.&#xD;
Here rude elevations had been made of ch~y and sand,&#xD;
upon which piles of dry combustible pine had been accu-&#xD;
mulated, and which were now all blazing brightly, in&#xD;
sharp, upward-darting tongues of fire. The rich illuini~&#xD;
nation lighted up the scene less softly and brightly, ir~&#xD;
deed, but even more picturesquely than the moonshine;&#xD;
and the happy groups wandered through various path-&#xD;
ways over which the blazing brands cast a rich, red lustre,.&#xD;
that eminently enlivened the rude forests, and made the&#xD;
particular trees stand forth, each like a frowning giant&#xD;
The admiration of the company was unanimous, and&#xD;
Mrs. Foster exulted in a triumph which she did not&#xD;
inform any of her guests was due wholly to the fancy&#xD;
of her step-daughter. For that matter, the entire scheme&#xD;
of the day belonged to the latter. All that was fanciful&#xD;
and picturesque in the design originated in her taste and&#xD;
invention. Tea was served, as the party wandered&#xD;
among the trees in the park. The tables which had&#xD;
borne lemonade and cakes in the morning, were now&#xD;
covered with hissing urns and fairy-like cups of china;&#xD;
and here the pledges for partners were given f~r the&#xD;
dances which were to follow, After the pleasant fashiQri&#xD;
of the peasants in the south of Europe, gay squadrons&#xD;
prepared to dance under the shade-trees, and by the&#xD;
light of the pine-blazing altars. Others, more consi-&#xD;
derate of domestic forms and health, prepared to occupy&#xD;
the great hail, the parlor, and piazza of the dwelling-&#xD;
house. The music was already in full discourse, and&#xD;
the groups whirling in the dance, when Nettles and&#xD;
I3arry made their appearance. The latter had been for-&#xD;
tunate, taxing the full speed of his horse "Glaucus;"&#xD;
the "Fair Geraldine" being in too great esteem to be&#xD;

&#xD;
used for common purposes, in getting from home a fresh&#xD;
supply of snugly-fitting garments. His long-tailed blue,&#xD;
and shining gold buttons, made a conspicuous figure in&#xD;
the assembly, particularly when contrasted with his pan-&#xD;
taloons, of the most delicate velvet buff. Mrs. Foster&#xD;
saw his return with delight. The good lady had begun&#xD;
to b~ apprehensive of the game. She was afraid that&#xD;
the ridiculous attitude in which he had been placed, his&#xD;
somerset from the sleeper' into the lake, and the un-&#xD;
happy floundering which followed there, had disgusted&#xD;
her daughter. She was also by no means a satisfied&#xD;
spectator of the frequent, though brief and broken&#xD;
sketches of conversation which had taken place between&#xD;
Geraldine and Hammond. The reappearance of Barry,&#xD;
restored in appearance, and looking rather attractive,&#xD;
was refreshing. She drew him privately into an inner&#xD;
room, and, while she served him with a dish of tea from&#xD;
her own hands; she could not forbear breaking forth&#xD;
"Really, Barry, how could you make yourself so ridi-&#xD;
culous ?"&#xD;
"Ridiculous I" he exclaimed, sipping the beverage;&#xD;
"I ridiculous, ma'am?"&#xD;
"Such a ridiculous 'situation, I mean&#xD;
"Perilous, you mean&#xD;
"Yes! it was perilous. But how did you come to&#xD;
fall? What carried you out on that sleeper ?".&#xD;
"I reckon the champagne had something to do with&#xD;
it; champagne and love together."&#xD;
"Love?"&#xD;
"To be sure! What else? Wasn't Miss Geraldine&#xD;
at one end of the log, and alone? Didn't you give me&#xD;
the hint, and wasn't this the letter?"&#xD;
Here. he showed the luckless epistle, which, full of fiery&#xD;
virtue, might be supposed to have been well tempered&#xD;
by its subsequent saturation, like a hissing blade of Da-&#xD;
mascus in the sacred waters of the Baraddee. Mrs.&#xD;
'Foster seized the neatly-folded epistle in her hands.&#xD;
"Give it to me! I will deliver it myself, this very&#xD;
&#xD;
night. Meanwhile, do you go out and make yourself&#xD;
agreeable with the young ladies. Don't be too particular&#xD;
with Geraldine. Only let her see you, and see that~you&#xD;
can make yourself agreeable to others. Dance with that&#xD;
Miss Berrie; flirt as much as you can with Miss Dooly.&#xD;
Either of them would be glad to snap you up. Let her&#xD;
see that! There's several others, Miss Higbee, Ellen&#xD;
Mairs, and Sophronia iRicketts, all of whom will be 'glad&#xD;
to have you 'squire them. Only don't be rash, don't&#xD;
venture any strange thing, and all will go right. I'll&#xD;
deliver the letter !"&#xD;
"Well! I thank you very much, for I was beginning&#xD;
to feel quite squeamish about it. I'm a little afeard that&#xD;
Hammond's getting on rather fast!"&#xD;
"He! never fear. He has dropped too many stitches&#xD;
for him to take up in a hurry. Will you have some more&#xD;
tea ?"&#xD;
"I shouldn't care if I had something stronger."&#xD;
"Oh! you mustn't think of any such thing now. I&#xD;
can give yo~i stronger tea."&#xD;
"Well; if there's nothing better."&#xD;
"Taste that," said the hostess, spooning him from a&#xD;
cup which the servant handed; and the scene was a&#xD;
good one for the painter. Barry, like an overgrown&#xD;
boy, sitting back in his chair, while the fair widow-by&#xD;
no means old or uncomely-.cuip and saucer in one hand,&#xD;
and spoon in the other, fed him with the smoking&#xD;
beverage.&#xD;
"Prime !" said he, with an air of satisfaction. Then&#xD;
taking the cup, he dashed it off with something less of&#xD;
appetite than resolution; and, abruptly darting from&#xD;
the chamber, hurried' out to seek a partner. Mrs.&#xD;
Foster followed him with eager interest, and was at&#xD;
length pleased to see him sprightly whirling it with~ the&#xD;
bouncing Rebecca Floyd~ It was with no dissatisfac-&#xD;
tion. that she beheld Miles Henderson dancing with&#xD;
Geraldine. It was somewhat strange that she enter-&#xD;
tamed no 'such fears of this young man as of his friend.&#xD;
He was quite a wcirthy and a very lovable person; tall,&#xD;

graceful, good-looking, very amiable, and tolerably well&#xD;
off in point of fortune. But, somehow, these qualifica-&#xD;
tions never occasioned a fear; though they were in all&#xD;
respects, but that of fortune, very far superior to any&#xD;
of the possessions of her favorite, She kept the couple&#xD;
in sight till the dance was over; and then hurriedly&#xD;
summoned Geraldine, in a whisper, to the inner room,&#xD;
but not before Hammond had succeeded in engaging&#xD;
her for the country dance that followed; the silly and&#xD;
highly objectionable custom of 'securing partners for&#xD;
many dances ahead, not then prevailing as it does now-.&#xD;
certainly not "in these diggings." When the two were&#xD;
safely together in the snug little apartment, where&#xD;
Barry but a little while before had sipped his tea,&#xD;
Mrs. Foster, with a very triumphant air, thrust the&#xD;
letter of that worthy into the hands of the young lady.&#xD;
"There! There's something for you."&#xD;
"What's this ?"&#xD;
"An offer!"&#xD;
"Indeed! Here's a pair of t~em, then, I suppose,"&#xD;
said the maiden, somewhat coolly, as, for the first time,&#xD;
she took from her bosom the billet of our friend, Hen-&#xD;
derson. "First come, first served," and she proceeded&#xD;
to break the seal of the latter.&#xD;
"Who's that from ?" asked the step-mother, with&#xD;
some anxiety.&#xD;
"Miles Henderson. He gave it me at the mill."&#xD;
"Oh, well.!" and the good lady seemed relieved as&#xD;
the daughter proceeded in its perusal. This done, she&#xD;
laid it quietly on the table; Mrs. Foster taking it up&#xD;
and going over it as soon as she had laid it down. The&#xD;
perusal of Jones IBafry's declaration followed, on the&#xD;
part of the person to whom it was addressed, and Mrs.&#xD;
Foster watched Geraldine's countenance with increas-&#xD;
ing curiosity, while pretending to examine Henderson's&#xD;
letter. But she gathered nothing from the face of our&#xD;
heroine. She read the one epistle, as she had done the&#xD;
other, with a singular calm, amounting to indifference;&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TENNESSEBAN'S STORY.        197&#xD;
and, handing it ~to the mother, begged her to take care&#xD;
of both.&#xD;
"But what will you say? What are you going to&#xD;
do? You accept?"&#xD;
"There's no hurry! I'm not in the humor now to&#xD;
think of these things. The gentlemen deserve that I&#xD;
should think of their offers respectfully."&#xD;
"Oh, certainly! But Barry ?".&#xD;
"Mr. Jones Barry must learn to wait as well as his&#xD;
neighbor," was the quiet reply; and at that moment&#xD;
Geraldine was relieved from further questioning by the&#xD;
entry of Miss Betsy Graystock, who bounced in to say&#xD;
that Mr. Randall Hammond was looking for his partner,&#xD;
the country dances being about to begin. It was with&#xD;
some chagrin that Mrs. Foster saw the promptness with&#xD;
which her prote1g~1 hurried out after this notice; and her&#xD;
disquiet increased as she watched the couple through&#xD;
all the mazes of the dance that followed. It wa~ her&#xD;
endeavor to keep these parties continually in sight,&#xD;
while they remained together; but this was not alto-&#xD;
gether possible, consistently with her cares and duties&#xD;
as hostess. Her attention was finally called off to some&#xD;
domestic arrangements; and, while she was engaged in&#xD;
the inner room, the dance ceased. Returning to ibok&#xD;
after her charge, as soon as the confusion of shifting&#xD;
groups could Possibly allow, she was a little displeased&#xD;
and distressed to find that they were now nowhere in&#xD;
sight. It was not her policy to afford to Hammond.-.&#xD;
whose influence over Geraldine she really began to ap-&#xD;
prehend-any unnecessary opportunities; and, Seizing&#xD;
Barry by the arm, she sent him off, with~a whisper, to&#xD;
look for Geraldine in one direction, while she set off&#xD;
herself, in another, to detect the whereabouts of her&#xD;
supposed companion.&#xD;
Hammond, meanwhile, had readily persuaded Geral-&#xD;
dine to a promenade under the shade-trees along the&#xD;
avenue. They were not alone in this measure. - The&#xD;
gay groups, most of them, after dancing, had taken a&#xD;
similar direction ; and, as the night was pleasant, they&#xD;

might be seen straying ~away through the various groves,&#xD;
glimpsing here and there through the prolonged vistas,&#xD;
their white garments gleaming spiritually under the&#xD;
flickering lights from the numerouS blazing pyres of&#xD;
pine wood, which the watchful care of the negroes in&#xD;
attendance from time to time supplied with fuel. The&#xD;
search of Barry and Mrs. Foster was not an easy one,&#xD;
to examine these various groups and trace out the par-&#xD;
ticular couple among the scattered flocks that wound&#xD;
about capriciously in every turning of the wood. It&#xD;
was still ~more difficult, when the object of Hammond-.&#xD;
perhaps not unobserved byl4s companion--~was tempo-&#xD;
rary seci~oy and seclusion. lie led~her away from all&#xD;
other sets, and, in the doubtful light of a half-decaying&#xD;
pile, and under the friendly shadows of a venerable&#xD;
~ak which had lived long enough to know how to keep&#xD;
secrets, and was probably too deaf to hear, our hero&#xD;
made his declaration. He spoke in warm and touching&#xD;
language, evidently with a ~full and feeling heart, but&#xD;
~tili in accents of a firm and dignified character. The&#xD;
imperfect light did not suffer him to perceive the emo-&#xD;
tion which his proposals occasioned on the cheeks of&#xD;
the damsel ;~ but he felt her hand treuible in his, and&#xD;
her reply wa~ slow. For some moments, indeed, a pro-&#xD;
found silence followed his speech, and his heart began&#xD;
to sink with a feeling of dread and disappointment, for&#xD;
which, it must be confessed, he found himself very im-&#xD;
perfectly prepared. But, with some abruptness in her&#xD;
maimer, a8 if her reply was the result of a real effort,&#xD;
an~ was, indeed, foreign to the genuine feeling which&#xD;
wa~ at her heart, she somewhat surprised him by say-&#xD;
"I am honored, Mr. Hammond, by your offer,&#xD;
and&#xD;
There was, a pause, when she again began-&#xD;
"You have heard, no, doubt, Mr. Hammond, that I&#xD;
ama very thoughtless, a very whimsical, a very capri-&#xD;
cious, a very eccentric girl, and, in truth, I am so. I&#xD;
have been very foolish, and my foolish resolutions some-&#xD;
&#xD;
times trouble me, as they do in this instance. But the&#xD;
kind and complimentary declaration which you have&#xD;
made reminds me of one* of my own, and I am half&#xD;
ashamed~ to tell you what it is."&#xD;
"Indeed 1' But, dear Miss Foster, you cannot doubt&#xD;
that I will be the most indulgent of all judges~---"&#xD;
"Oh, surely, as far as it is possible; but yo~ir de-&#xD;
claration makes you an interested one, and my resolve&#xD;
concerns this very declaration."&#xD;
"Indeed !" with an air of some surprise&#xD;
"Yes, indeed !" and there was now some little pique&#xD;
mingled in with the lady's embarrassment; "but it&#xD;
concerns not only your proposals, sir, but those of other&#xD;
persons9 You must 'kn9w, sir, and I do not mention&#xD;
the fact except from the necessity of the case, that&#xD;
yours is the third offer of marriage whidi I have had&#xD;
to-day."&#xD;
"Then, Miss Foster, I am to understand that I am&#xD;
too late ?" This was said rather proudly.&#xD;
"Not so, Mr. lianimond. You are, on the contrary,&#xD;
rather quick. I have as yet determined on neither,&#xD;
and a rash resolution-a 'foolish vow-makes it impos-&#xD;
sible that I should determine directly. [-I have been&#xD;
very foolish, sir."&#xD;
The poor girl seemed really very much embarrassed.&#xD;
Her sympathies were all with Hammond; but her pride&#xD;
had been committed, and it was still~ watchful~and re-&#xD;
sentful. Hammond perceived and felt for her embar-&#xD;
rassment.&#xD;
"If I knew what to say or what to do 1" said he.&#xD;
"If I could only conjectur9 the cause of your embar-&#xD;
rassment !"&#xD;
And he hesitated. The pride of the girl came' to&#xD;
her relief.&#xD;
"I have been very foolish, no doubt; but that is no&#xD;
reason why I should be cowardly. I must risk the re-&#xD;
proach of being whimsical and* ridiculous; but you shall&#xD;
know all. Mr. Hammond, your horse 'Ferraunt' is, you&#xD;
tell me, the fastest horse in the country ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
Her companion was confounded. This question,&#xD;
seemingly so absurd, was put with all imaginable se-&#xD;
riousness; nay, with something like a vehement earnest-&#xD;
ness, while the speaker looked directly up into the face&#xD;
of the person she addressed, as if anxiously awaiting&#xD;
his answer. He was bewildered.&#xD;
"Really, Miss Foster, you surprise me. What can&#xD;
the speed of my horse have to do with the matter?"&#xD;
"A great deal-a great deal. Only tell me, is it&#xD;
not so? Is not 'Ferraunt' the fastest horse in the&#xD;
country? In short, can't he beat Mr. Henderson's&#xD;
Sorella,' and the 'Geraldine,' my namesake, of Mr.&#xD;
]3arry's?"&#xD;
"Such is my opinion. Nay, without an accident,' I&#xD;
am very sure of it. ' But really, Miss Foster, you must&#xD;
again permit me to express my surprise at the ques-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"Oh, .1 know that you think me very ridiculous, and&#xD;
I am so-I am so," answered the girl, now laughing&#xD;
playfully and wildly, as if with a heart fully relieved of&#xD;
a burden.&#xD;
"Forgive me, sir, I am but a child; seventeen only,&#xD;
to-day. Forgive ire; but will you spare me tonight?&#xD;
Suffer me to convey to you my answer in writing."&#xD;
She gave him her hand as sh~ spoke. He seized and&#xD;
conveyed it to his lips, and the action was in noways re-&#xD;
buked.' Bu~ it was witnessed. Mrs. Foster broke in, at&#xD;
this moment, with "Geraldine, Geraldine! my daughter,&#xD;
you are wanted."&#xD;
"I am with you, mother ;" and she whirled away&#xD;
with the intruder, who had barely time to say, "What&#xD;
do I see, Geraldine ?" when Jones Barry came up to&#xD;
entreat the hand of the latter for the next cotillion, and&#xD;
to relieve her from the necessity ~of answering a very&#xD;
awkward question.&#xD;
&#xD;
200&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
THAT LAST DRINK AND DANCE~ AND WHAT CAME OF IT.&#xD;
WE must premise that, when dispatched by Mrs.&#xD;
Foster in search of Geraldine, Jones Barry did not&#xD;
proceed directly upon ~his mission. He was diverted&#xD;
from this object by his friend Tom N~ettles, who ap-&#xD;
peared to have been seeking, and who, seizing' him by&#xD;
the arm, drew him to the rear of the building with a&#xD;
look and manner of very mysterious confidence.&#xD;
"Jones," said he, "champagne is an excellent crea-&#xD;
ture, and so is sherry. I like them very well in their&#xD;
way. But they seem to me, in comparison with our&#xD;
good old Georgia~ drinks, like the dessert to the solid&#xD;
feast. The nuts are good, the raisins, cakes, and al-&#xD;
monds; but, after all, my boy, give me a genuine haunch&#xD;
of venison, a good smoking ham, and a fat turkey, or a&#xD;
pair of ducks. So with these wines. I acknowledge&#xD;
champagne to be a fiery, well-bred gentleman; but he&#xD;
is too uniformly genteel and delicate. I want more&#xD;
solid argument than he can give me, and so I turn,&#xD;
when I can, to a sober whiskey-punch, a brandy eock~&#xD;
tail, or a peach or apple toddy."&#xD;
"But you can't get any of them here," said Barry,&#xD;
eagerly.&#xD;
"Can't I? Leave Tom Nettles alone for finding out&#xD;
where the weasel sleeps. This fellow Abram, who&#xD;
serves as a sort of major-domo in the widow's house~&#xD;
hold-lBy the way, Jones, the widow would suit u&#xD;
better than the daughter; she's ~a better armfull. Don't&#xD;
you think so&#xD;
"She looks well."&#xD;
"Ay, aDd would wear well, old fellow."&#xD;
&#xD;
201&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7769-00000102"/>&#xD;
"She would, indeed."&#xD;
"Think of it. It's worth a thought."&#xD;
"It's too late now."&#xD;
"What! are you engaged to the daughter?"&#xD;
"I suppose you may say so. It's as good as that.&#xD;
I've handed in the letter."&#xD;
"P-h-e-w! Don't halloo till you're out of the wood."&#xD;
"But to the liquor. Abram&#xD;
"Oh, Abram: yes! Well, that Abram's a fellow&#xD;
after one's own heart; and, whether you marry the&#xD;
daughter or the widow, I hope you'll give him to me.&#xD;
reeling the want of the stronger spirit, I said to him:&#xD;
'Abram, this~'~ is a pleasant fellow, this champagne, to&#xD;
say a word to at coming and at parting, but he don't&#xD;
seem to answer so well through a long visit. Now,&#xD;
haven't you something in the shape of a plain, homely,&#xD;
sensible old Georgia drink, that won't foam, and hiss,&#xD;
and sparkle when you speak to it?' Upon which the&#xD;
fellow whispers to me: 'Old master had a jimmyjohn&#xD;
of mighty fine peach in the garret, and, since he's gone,&#xD;
we never uses it.' 'Abram,' says I, 'your master was&#xD;
a sensible man when alive, and I hope was sensible&#xD;
enough when he died to go to a place of good spirits.&#xD;
God bless him, and us. Abram, my lad, can you get&#xD;
us a look at that jimmyjohn?'"&#xD;
"'Well?" demanded Barry, somewhat eagerly.&#xD;
"Well!' Here it is, and here's Abram, and here's&#xD;
a few fellows like yourself, ready to take a toss at the&#xD;
tankard."&#xD;
They had now reached an apartment in the basement&#xD;
of the building, where a few rude tables sustained a&#xD;
world of crockery, cups, plates, and glasses, such. as had&#xD;
already been used above stairs. On one of these tables&#xD;
stood the ancient demijohn, covered with ~antique dust&#xD;
and honoring ~cobwebs. Honey, water, cups, and&#xD;
tumblers were in readiness, and nothing was to be done&#xD;
but drink. Even the beverage-a sufficient quantity-&#xD;
had been mixed in anticipation by the judicious Nettles,&#xD;
and the beaker, that was thrust into Barry's grasp,&#xD;
&#xD;

202         AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,                                 TRE TENNESSEEAN'S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
203&#xD;
&#xD;
glittered to the brim, with equal strength and sweet~.&#xD;
ness. In the taste of the sweet, he did not recognize&#xD;
the potency and excess of the strength, and it was'with&#xD;
a royal mind that he now broke away from the group&#xD;
of drinkers to continue his search after Geraldine. We&#xD;
have seen at what moment and under what circum-&#xD;
stances he found her. As he left Nettles and his&#xD;
companions, a loud laugh attested the conspira~~y.&#xD;
"Lie has it," cried Nettles.&#xD;
"A most mortal shot," said' Dick.&#xD;
"It'll floor him, sure;" said Ned.&#xD;
"'Twould floor a~ bullock," muttered Peter; and,&#xD;
with these calculations, th&#xD;
their ~rictim. with a view ey all scattered in pursuit of&#xD;
to watching the results.&#xD;
Meanwhile, unsuspicious of danger, and with a con-&#xD;
fidence in himself gradually increasing as the peach&#xD;
began to "blossom"' in his veins, Jones Barry led his&#xD;
partner triumphantly to the hail, where the dancers&#xD;
were rapidly assembling from all quarters. The coin-&#xD;
pany had begun to thin; the hour was becoming late;&#xD;
the old people had pretty much departed, except those&#xD;
inveterate appetizers who will wait through the tedious&#xD;
rounds of dancing in which they do not share, in order&#xD;
to partake of the supper, in which they never fail to&#xD;
insist upon something more than, their share. It is not&#xD;
every day, with these, that Paddy' kills hi~ favorite&#xD;
cow, and they make the most of the event when he&#xD;
does. There they sat or stood about the room, wait-&#xD;
ing anxiously the close of the last cotillion. Mean-&#xD;
while, the music sounded merrily, and the dancers&#xD;
began to vault and whirl. Jones Barry and Geraldine&#xD;
found themselves confronted by Tom Nettles and Polly&#xD;
Ewbanks-Polly being the most portly of all the fair&#xD;
people assembled-as ignorant of the dance as a horse,&#xD;
and as clumsy as an elephant. But IPolly had a rather&#xD;
pretty face, and though she felt doubtful of the sort of&#xD;

ming motion, like a great Dutch galliot in a heavy,&#xD;
swelling sea, Polly went to and Cro, very imperfectly&#xD;
steadied by the arm, and hand, and counsels of her&#xD;
partner. "Why the deuce," was the thought of Barry,&#xD;
"did Tom Nettles choose such a woman for his partner,&#xD;
when so many so much more comely and compatible&#xD;
could be had?" But Tom had his reasons. There was&#xD;
mischief in his eye, only perceptible, however, to his&#xD;
comrades, one of whom was in the same 'set with our&#xD;
couple, while the others were eagerly and anxiously&#xD;
looking on. But Jones Barry had neither the time,&#xD;
nor was he in the mood, to make reflections. The&#xD;
peach began to poach upon the territories' of his brain.&#xD;
He leaped high, he vaulted, whirled, wheeled, clapped&#xD;
his hands, and at length seemed about to reach that con-&#xD;
dition of extase in which certain virgins under religious&#xD;
inspiration have attained, by whicli they can stand upon&#xD;
the air and dance upon nothing, without the aid of any&#xD;
unseemly ornaments about the neck. Geraldine began&#xD;
to be disquieted; but her situation admitted of no ex-&#xD;
trication. She felt its annoyances the more as she&#xD;
beheld, at a little distance, the grave, sedate, and cir-&#xD;
cumspect eye of. Randall Hammond fixed upon the&#xD;
proceedings. IBut the confusion grew. First, there&#xD;
was some ~little ~awkwardness in Tom Nettles himself.&#xD;
lie wheeled to the right when he should have gone left,&#xD;
and when the figure called him to cross over, he sent&#xD;
his partner into the arena. She was constantly blun-&#xD;
dering; but this Jones Barry was now becoming too&#xD;
happy to perceive. Though a very fair dancer himself,&#xD;
his errors soon became apparent. Yet he was correct-&#xD;
ing Nettles all the while&#xD;
"Wrong,, Tom; to the right about! *Now we go!&#xD;
how it bja~es! Whoop! She flies! Glorious, Tom;&#xD;
eli ?" and he strove, while speaking,. to bestow a $igrki-&#xD;
ficant look with those eyes which were momently be-&#xD;
coming more and more small. Round. he went, whirling&#xD;
hi~ partner with him. Round went Tom Nettles, with&#xD;
hi~ nearly round partner, her enormous sides seeming to&#xD;

Jones Barry; but down he went, his. legs passing com~&#xD;
pletel~ from under him, and bet~e~n :the' uplifted,'feet&#xD;

rous friend, Nettles, had bestowed, him, and had him&#xD;
borne to a corofortablechamber. He himself seemed to.&#xD;
have been unconscious of the transition. it is the tradi-&#xD;

words spoken by him, when disturbed, for removal, were&#xD;
the same 'which he had last spoken in the ball-room:&#xD;
"Back to back, Miss I'oliy." ~The next day at ~' late&#xD;

said the Widow, slyly.&#xD;
"IL~1each, oh! I' do recollect drinking a little with&#xD;
Nettles. By the way,. Mrs. Foster, a little of that stuff&#xD;
it's a fine old liquor,, wouldn't be amiss.&#xD;
"On the principle," retorted the widow, "so well&#xD;
known~among yow gay young men, that the hair of the&#xD;
dog is always good for the bite."&#xD;
"Ah !" said the offender, "I'm afraid you know every-&#xD;
thing, Mrs. Foster. You're quite too knowing; yes, you&#xD;
are!"&#xD;
"We. know enough to be indulgent, Mr~ Barry.&#xD;
What say you to the peach ?"&#xD;
His assent was not, hard to obtain, and while Mrs.&#xD;
Foster compounded the peach toddy with honey, she&#xD;
gave' him th~ gratuitous information that " poor dear&#xD;
Mr. Foster was quite fond of his peach~dram. I made&#xD;
it f~r him regularly twice a day, Mr. Barry; once about&#xD;
this hour, and once just before he went to bed."&#xD;
~"~hat a dutiful wife !" was the reflection of Barry,&#xD;
as he heard these words, and followed the graceful move-&#xD;
ments of the ~widow. He remembered the words of Net-&#xD;
ties: "Not a bad armful, indeed,!" His further reflec-&#xD;

she' had administered the tea the evening before, but&#xD;

"It's the very~ thing. Ah !' you know the way to a&#xD;

The answeri~ 'to this compliment was arrested by the&#xD;
suddezi entrance of Geraldine.&#xD;
"You here, Mr. Barry ?".&#xD;
"I'm never anywhere else !" said he, quite gallantly.&#xD;
How are you this morning, Miss Geraldine?"&#xD;
"1 should rattler ask after your health !" was her&#xD;
quiet but sarcastic answer. "You were in the chapter&#xD;

"Much~ better, I thank you'! If my heart were only&#xD;

siniple 'but'r~spectful one. It declared the re~olutiou of&#xD;
the lady, and forbore all expression of feeling or opin-&#xD;

read it, and 'mentioned that he had also received an&#xD;
answer to his application, the purport of which was the&#xD;
same. He did not show the letter, however, and it was&#xD;
with a secret pleasure that, he remarked a material&#xD;
difference in the style and wording of the two letters.&#xD;
While tha~t to Henderson merely declared her determina-&#xD;
tion, in simple terms, as if written without an effort,&#xD;
showing the writer .to be comparatively indifferent to&#xD;
the feelings: which she might provoke, that to himself&#xD;
w~s distinctly apologetic in its tone. While her requi-&#xD;
sition wa~ precisely the same in both the letters) she&#xD;
was here prepared to show something like a regret that it&#xD;
had been made. "I deem it. right to say," was the&#xD;
language in one place, "if only in justice to myself,&#xD;
that it is rather in obedience to a resolution, perhaps&#xD;
rashly made, bmt' which I must 'still hold inviolate, that&#xD;
I attach so 'singular a condition and qualification to my&#xD;
as5ent~ particularly Where, as in the present instance,&#xD;
the application, as I am well aware, does me' so much&#xD;
honor..&#xD;
~This may have 'been ironically said, bnt it was more&#xD;
grateful to the self-esteem of Hammond to fancy other-&#xD;
wise: and though vexed and'wondering at the absurdity&#xD;
of the requisition, it was somewhat grateful to discover&#xD;
such a decided difference in the language employed in&#xD;
'Henda~son's letter, and'his own. Besides, he recollected&#xD;
with feelings of satisfaction the inquiries which the&#xD;
young lady had made the night previously as to 'the speed&#xD;
of his horse. All this made it sufficiently apparent to&#xD;
his vanity 'that she desired his suoc~ss; and yet" the re-&#xD;
quisUion was not the less offensive to all his ideas of&#xD;
propriety.&#xD;
"To 'choose her husband according to the legs of his&#xD;
hQrse !" said Henderson, with praiseworthy indignation.&#xD;
"It is astoni~hirig I there is some mystery~about it,"&#xD;
'said Hammond.&#xD;
&#xD;
"To put us on the same footing with that 'silly&#xD;
creature, Barry !" exclaimed the one.&#xD;
"The mother is at the bottom of it," responded the&#xD;
jher&#xD;
"What is to be done ?" cried Hendersot~. "I'll 'be&#xD;
d-~---~--d if I'll run a race to get 'a wife. If it's in&#xD;
the heels of my horse that she's, to' find my merits, I&#xD;
shall be at a loss where to look' for hers."&#xD;
"Very well said, Miles, and quite spirited. .' ~nt,' as&#xD;
you s~y, what's' to be done? that's the' question. Now~&#xD;
I'll tell you what I think. I ~propose to: go and 'see&#xD;
Miss Foster in person, and to talk the matter over with&#xD;
her, showing all the absurdities of this requisition, and&#xD;
the ridiculoi~sness of the position' into which 'it' will&#xD;
throw all pai~ties. I think she may be persuaded to&#xD;
hear reason, for Lam disposed' to think that the whole&#xD;
affair originated with the step-mother. What she pro-&#xD;
poses to effect by it, uiiless it be merely' to astonish' the&#xD;
natives-.--a thing grateful 'enough to her silly vanity-.!.&#xD;
it is impossible for me to conjecture. Now, without&#xD;
pressing IVliss Foster on my own. account,. I propose&#xD;
simply to argue the matter with her; to show her how' it&#xD;
will appear to the public; and endeavor to impress upon&#xD;
her how uncertain will be the securities of domestic&#xD;
happiness where the tie is based upon such &amp;amp;~rnditions.&#xD;
What think you, Miles? Such was my purpose before'&#xD;
you came.&#xD;
"Has your mother heard 'of it-have you told'her ?"&#xD;
"No; and I don't mean ~o tell her; for I know that&#xD;
she would at once require me to withdraw my proposals.&#xD;
She would' never forgive~ Geraldine for what she would&#xD;
regard as an insult."&#xD;
"And so do I consider it. Bat, as you. say, sh~ may&#xD;
be led by that woman, her step-mother; who is a~ mi~~&#xD;
chieyous as a~ young puppy. I don't know' but your&#xD;
.plan is the right 'one. You go to her. You. can talk&#xD;

but that quiz, could afford no consolation. The ~nys~-&#xD;
tery was entirely beyond his' solution. 1ie~ thought the&#xD;
affair comical "in high degree, and concluded that the&#xD;
principle once adopted-that of running a race for a&#xD;
wife-~Would completely revolutionize the concerns of&#xD;
marriage.&#xD;
"It would certainly discoixrage me from the attempt&#xD;

"But I did not mean anything of the sort, sir."&#xD;
"Then, permit me to say, the case becomes still&#xD;
'more perilous for yourself, if less offensive to the suitor;&#xD;
since, if you have a choice, you wilfully subject it to all&#xD;

"By no means, Miss Foster. The passion may b~&#xD;
as warm and active as it should be-the love unquench-&#xD;
able and enduring; but the sense of propriety no less&#xD;
tenacious, and the wholesome laws of principle too&#xD;
stubborn to give way to any impulses of the heart Un-&#xD;
less they are found justUled by virtue."&#xD;
"Is it possible, Mr. Hammond, that the affecti~us&#xD;
should be warm or devoted where the individual refuses&#xD;
to peril his horse to obtain them 7"' -'&#xD;
"I&#xD;
Foster, ~peril my life for this hand, rn~ dear Miss&#xD;
should occasion require it; but have you for-&#xD;
gotLen that most famous passage in the history of&#xD;
chivalry, when the imperious beauty, conscious of her&#xD;
power upon the heart of a noble knight, threw h'~er glove&#xD;
into the amphitheatre at the moment when ,~n angry&#xD;
lion was stalking over it, and motioned to the brave&#xD;
cavalier to restore itt?"&#xD;
"And he?"'&#xD;
"Obeyed her, braved -the lion, recovered the glove,&#xD;
and restored it to the lady."&#xD;
"Well! Was it not nobly done ?-"&#xD;
"Perhaps! In those days stich -follies had a signifi~&#xD;
cance and merit which they do not possess now. But&#xD;
there is a sequel to the story."&#xD;
"Pray tell it."&#xD;
"The knight who braved the lion for the lady, from&#xD;
that moment yielded the lady t6 other knights. He&#xD;
turned away from the reckless beauty who ~euld peril&#xD;

the life of her lover only to exhibit her power over him;&#xD;
and the world applauded the desertion, and the beauty&#xD;
was abandoned by all other knights."&#xD;
The pride of the maid was touched.&#xD;
"In this fable, Mr. Hammond, I am to behold a&#xD;
warning, I suppose."&#xD;
"A truth-a principle-is a warning, Miss Foster,&#xD;
to all mankind. In proposing for your hand, I was&#xD;
prepared to let you see into my whole . nature-my&#xD;
feelings, opinions, and the principles by wbich I am&#xD;
governed. I am now dealing with you with the frank-&#xD;
ness of one who hopes to find a wife in the woman with&#xD;
whom he speaks. I speak with you unaffectedly. I&#xD;
would peril my life for you in the moment of necessity,&#xD;
and joy to do so. I might peril it, as a proud man, at&#xD;
your mere requisition, or your caprice; but it would be&#xD;
also at the peril of my esteem for you. There is no&#xD;
peril in bestriding a blooded horse, and engaging in the&#xD;
contest you propose; but it endangers self-respept, it&#xD;
offends public opinion, it degrades the suitor, as it ad-&#xD;
miTts no difference-except, perhaps, as a jockey-be-&#xD;
tween him and his competitors, and-"&#xD;
He paused.&#xD;
"Go on, sir."&#xD;
"I almost fear, Miss Foster."&#xD;
"Nay, sir, you have spoken with little fear, thus far.&#xD;
You may surely finish."q&#xD;
"I will! It is only right that I should show the dan-&#xD;
ger to yourself. It puts the lady in the attitude of one&#xD;
whose standard depends upon her caprice and whims,&#xD;
rather than her principles.&#xD;
"You speak plainly-certainly without fear."&#xD;
"My dear Miss Foster, I have perilled all my life in&#xD;
the offer I have made you of my hand. I have every-&#xD;
thing at stake which is precious. Pardon me, if this&#xD;
consideration makes me bold, where love, ~alone, would&#xD;
only make me humble. We are both young, but you&#xD;
much younger than myself.. You have seen the world&#xD;
only through the medium of other eyes. It is easy&#xD;
&#xD;
with the young to err, and seeing thus, to see falselyy&#xD;
even in the most important interests. I should almost&#xD;
be disposed to think that, in making this requisition,&#xD;
against which I beg most respectfully to protest, you&#xD;
have obeyed any but your own impulses~ Let me en-&#xD;
treat you to reverse it."&#xD;
"IReally, Mr. Hammond, you attach a singular im-&#xD;
portance to a horserace."&#xD;
"Surely, not so much as you, Miss Foster, when you&#xD;
are willing to risk all your own happiness upon it."&#xD;
"It is your pride, sir."&#xD;
"It is, but I trust not an improper pride."&#xD;
"I don't know, sir; but my pride too is concerned.&#xD;
You have been told that I have made a vow. I have&#xD;
said, to you, that I felt it to be rash, and feared that it&#xD;
was foolish, but the resolution was taken. I will not&#xD;
now say whether I do or do not regret it. Enough,&#xD;
that it is unchangeable."&#xD;
"Do not say this, I entreat you, Miss Foster; for my&#xD;
sake! I entreat-~--But no! To you I may be nothing.&#xD;
For your own sake, then~for your future peace, and&#xD;
happiness, and hope-do mit peril everything on a re-&#xD;
solution so utterly unmeaning and without obligation.&#xD;
It needs but little effort of wisdom to show that truth,&#xD;
propriety, common sense, all agree to absolve you from&#xD;
such a vow. Beware how you persist! lit will be fatal."&#xD;
He rose as he spoke.&#xD;
"Do you threaten, Mr. Hammond ?"&#xD;
"Warn! Warn only."&#xD;
"I thank you for your warning, sir; but I doubt&#xD;
whether it is due more to your notions of principle than&#xD;
to yo~.ir own feelings of pride, and-"&#xD;
"My pride, Miss Foster! You do not know or un-&#xD;
derstand me. I spoke not for myself in this matter,&#xD;
but for you. Not with regard to him who should be&#xD;
fortunate enough to secure this har~d, but in regard to&#xD;
the happiness of that heart which you will permit me&#xD;
to say, I believe to be more misguided than wilful. The&#xD;
conditions which you couple with this hand~will, I fear,&#xD;

He took her hand as he ~poke. His eyes were fixed&#xD;
upon hers imploringly, with an expression of the deepest&#xD;
interest in her reply. Hers sunk beneath them. The&#xD;
struggle in her heafr was great, but the whisper of the&#xD;
evil genius was still i~i her ears.&#xD;
"It is his pride~ that speaks, anti, you must humble it,&#xD;
if you would not have him your master. He will not&#xD;
give you up. He will yield to your terms, when once&#xD;
he finds that he cannot command his own."&#xD;
She faltered forth a renewal of her resolution. Then&#xD;
he rose,, released her hand, and said.-.&#xD;
"I leave you, Miss Foster; of my determination on&#xD;
this subject you will permit me~ to write hereafter."&#xD;
lie was gone, and she hurried to her chamber and&#xD;
flung herself in a fit of weeping upon her bed. The&#xD;
mother would have consoled her, but in vain.&#xD;
"You have destroyed me !" was all she said. "lie&#xD;
will 7iever come again."&#xD;
"Aiid if he doesn't," was the elegant response of the&#xD;
mother, "there's as good fish in the river as evc~r came&#xD;

110W THE RACE WAS RUN, HOW THE RACE WAS WON, AND&#xD;
WHAT HAPPENED THEREUPON.&#xD;
"SHE may whistle for it! I'll never marry a wo-&#xD;
man who chooses me on the score of my mare's legs&#xD;
and bottom."&#xD;
Such was the elegantly-declared resolution of our&#xD;
now thoroughly indignant Miles Henderson, when&#xD;
Hammond reported how ill he had sped in his mission&#xD;
to Geraldine.&#xD;
"She certainly pays us no compliment."&#xD;
"Compliment! She* treats us as if one man was&#xD;
just the same to her as another. Who'd marry a wo-&#xD;
man on such terms? What man who values his happi-&#xD;
ness at all will take a wife who don't prefer him to all&#xD;
other suitors ?"&#xD;
"Miles ?"&#xD;
"Well, Ran. ?"&#xD;
"Geraldine does express this preference."&#xD;
"How?"&#xD;
"She knows very well that 'Sorella' can beat Barry's&#xD;
filly. She has done so. Now, it seems to me that this&#xD;
must have been in the recollection of Geraldine when&#xD;
she made the requisition."&#xD;
"Yes, but 'Ferraunt' can beat 'Sorella.'"&#xD;
"True, perhaps; but if you will engage in. the con-&#xD;
flict with Barry, I'll decline it. I'll leave the field to&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"No, no, Ran.; that won't do. I sha'n't run at&#xD;
all. If the lady don't like me sufficiently to answer&#xD;
'Yes' at once, we're quits. I wouldn't have her now&#xD;

on any terms.' I think she has treated us most out-&#xD;
rageously."&#xD;
"I'm disposed to think her foolish and vexatious&#xD;
mother's at the bottom of it all, though what she pro-&#xD;
poses to gain by it, I do not exactly see; yet a thought&#xD;
strikes me. It's very clear that Mrs. Foster has all&#xD;
along preferred Barry to either of us. Now, if we&#xD;
withdraw from the field, he walks the course and takes&#xD;
the purse. This, perhaps, will be just the thing that&#xD;
the mother hopes for. That she has blinded Geraldine'&#xD;
by some artifice, is very possible. Now, I'm 'not will-&#xD;
ing that' the mother should be 'gratified. I'm disposed&#xD;
equally to balk her and to punish Geraldine. 'I feel&#xD;
something of your indignation; and, though' I'm sure&#xD;
she prefers either of us to Jones Barry, yet I fear she&#xD;
presumes upon what she thinks our passion for her, to&#xD;
coerce us With this humiliating. condition. 'She seems&#xD;
to take for granted that we caiuiot but yield, howeVer&#xD;
little we may 'relish doing so."&#xD;
"What's your plan ?"&#xD;
"To accede to her conditions."&#xD;
"How, accede 1"&#xD;
"Yes, apparently at least. We'll write her to that&#xD;
effect, see Barry, mane the arrangements for the race,&#xD;
and get all things in readiness."&#xD;
" Well !"&#xD;
"It will be easy to throw Barry out-to beat him&#xD;
after the first mile-and thus defeat the calculations of&#xD;
'the mother."&#xD;
"Well!"&#xD;
"We agree that the wedding takes place the very&#xD;
day of the race. Let them have the company, let&#xD;
~them get the parson, let them make the feast, and let&#xD;
"~Vell! well!"&#xD;
"Ride off as*e came, leaving them to eat the supper,&#xD;

"They deserve it! What think you'?"&#xD;
"It's a sentence! They shall pay the forfeit. The&#xD;
idea is capital. It'll be a lesson to such people here-&#xD;
after."&#xD;
"Then let us proceed about it. What we do We&#xD;
must do quickly, so that the thing shall not be bloWn&#xD;
unnecessarily abroad I shall keep it from my mother&#xD;
if I can; at all ~vents, I must keep from her that I&#xD;
mean to put in for this prize. To do this, I'll go home&#xD;
with you, and we'll write and work from your house.&#xD;
To Barry we must sond to-niorrow~ and have the race&#xD;
early next week."&#xD;
The arrangements, as devised, were all made. Barry&#xD;
was invited to an interview, and readily came into the&#xD;
arrangements somewhat disappointed, however, to ~nd&#xD;
'so prompt an acceptance of the conditions, in spite of&#xD;
the confident predictions of. Mrs. Foster. That good&#xD;
lady 'was quite as much confounded as anybody else;&#xD;
but she made the best' of a bad bargain. She encour-&#xD;
aged Barry to hope; and it was with a confident face&#xD;
jhat she could now say to her daughter-.&#xD;
"You see? 'Tis as I told y6u~-yon have only to be&#xD;
firm, and he submits. This is the way with men, always.&#xD;
Women yield too readily. Let them only stick out to&#xD;
the last, and they'll rule in the end."&#xD;
Meanwhile, the affair got abroad, and was the cause&#xD;
of no little excitement. The subject is one which still,&#xD;
to this day, interests the people of t~,he surrounding&#xD;
country. They call it the "race for a wife." Of&#xD;
course, it was the crowning event iti the 'history of&#xD;
Geraldine Foster's eccentricities. They little knew&#xD;
how small was the share of the poor girl in the~ pro-.&#xD;
ceeding. Nettles was delighted with th~ affair. Its&#xD;
novelty charmed him. He did not exactly expect that&#xD;
Hammond would have engaged in the contest, for he&#xD;
had quite as high an opinion of that gentleman's pride&#xD;
of character as was entertained by Mrs. Foster; ~but he&#xD;
said nothing against it. He told Jones Barry, however,&#xD;
that the game was all up with him; that the "Fair&#xD;

Geraldine" stood no chance against either the heels of&#xD;
"Ferraunt" or " Sorella." "But," he continued, "I&#xD;
shall be glad to see you beat, for reasons ready&#xD;
given you. This girl is not the girl for you. Better&#xD;
the step-mother, Mrs. Foster. She's neither old nor&#xD;
ugly, and ~he knows what good living is. Besides,&#xD;
she's a widow, whose gratitude to the man that will&#xD;
take her off her own hands will make her tolerably sub-&#xD;
missive. IBut, 'better still, the fat girl, ,Susannah, at&#xD;
hiram Davy's. corner. She's the good creature, the&#xD;
sweet laughing armful of happiness, all fat and good-&#xD;
humor. Even Polly Ewbanks, whom you overthrew at&#xD;
the ball, would be more suitable, and, for that matter,&#xD;
she evidently likes you."&#xD;
"Don't speak of her, the cow! I'll never forgive&#xD;
her for that tumble, She threw me, thrusting her ele-&#xD;
phant legs between mine, just when I was caz~orting."&#xD;
"The boot's on t'other leg, Jones. It was you that&#xD;
thrust your pegs in the wrong direction, and you did&#xD;
the mischief. In' truth, Jones, I'm afraid it was more&#xD;
design on your part than accident."&#xD;
"I swear to you, Torn, I never designed anything;&#xD;
but I'm willing to confess that that 'peach' was quite&#xD;
too much for me, after the sherry and champagne."&#xD;
"Not a bit of it; but there was a sort of destiny&#xD;
that~made you and Polly Ewbanks fall together; and,&#xD;
mark my words, I prophesy that, if ever you marry,&#xD;
it'll be one Qf the three-Polly Ewbanks, Sukey Davy,&#xD;
or the widow Foster-and I don't care much which;&#xD;
though Sukey or Polly, either, ,would make you the&#xD;
best wife. It's very certain that if Geraldjne Foster&#xD;
is to be got by running only, you stand no chance&#xD;
against 'Ferraunt' and 'Sorella.'"&#xD;
lVl7rs. hammond at length heard Qf the terms of the&#xD;
conflict, and was shocked at its monstrosities. She at&#xD;
once appealed t~5 her son in the earnest language of a&#xD;
mother, to avoid any such competition. He answered&#xD;
her evasively but satisfactorily, in calm but earnest&#xD;
language.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Fear nothing, mother; there is no prospect of my&#xD;
ever being united' with Miss Foster."&#xD;
And here the matter rested until the day appointed&#xD;
for the trial. The three competitors had, itt their&#xD;
separate answers, agreed upon the terms. They had&#xD;
also-using a discretion which had been conferred upon&#xD;
them-concurred in entreating that t~e da~ of the race&#xD;
should be that of the wedding also. The coinpaiiy were&#xD;
accordingly invited, and the fleverend Timothy Bind-'&#xD;
well, of the Presbyterian Church, was entreated to be&#xD;
present, and made his appearance in his robes of office&#xD;
at the appointed hour. He was one of those to. whom&#xD;
it was always agreeable to bring the young together in&#xD;
the blessed ties of marriage, particularly where the&#xD;
wedding-supper was apt to be good, and the marriage-&#xD;
fee a liberal one. his ~xpeetations, on the present'&#xD;
occasion, were of superior magnitude. It was observed&#xD;
as an evil sign by Geraldine that *Mrs. Hammond;&#xD;
though invited, was noV pi'esent when the company was&#xD;
assembled. She remarked this to her mother, as some-&#xD;
thing omii~ou~; but the latter had her answer.&#xD;
"Oh! she no doubt feels as bitter about it as she&#xD;
can. If her pride could have ruled her son in such a&#xD;
matter, he had neVer consented to the terms."&#xD;
"I hardly think that he will consent now."&#xD;
"How! When we have it in black and white, under&#xD;
his hands? But dress, my child"-this conversation&#xD;
took place in Geraldine's chamber-" dress, so as~t6 be&#xD;
quite in readiness. I'll send Rachel up to help you~"&#xD;
"Send no one! I'll ring if I want her."&#xD;
The* mother left the room, and the poor girl, as if&#xD;
with a presentiment of the mortification w Which she&#xD;
was destined, sank down listlessly before the window,&#xD;
looking out upon the long avenue up which the c'om~&#xD;
petitors were to ascend. How bitter were her reflec-&#xD;
tions at this moment! How sh&amp;amp; deplored the readiness&#xD;
with Which she had given ear to her mother's counsels!&#xD;
and with what warning solemnity did the words and&#xD;
looks of Hammond, in their last interview, whefi he&#xD;

came to expostulate, rise to her recollection! She&#xD;
probably would not have been dressed but for the re-&#xD;
appearance of Mrs. Foster, who insisted upon her&#xD;
immediate preparations. She assisted her in making&#xD;
her toilet, taking care all the while so to speak as to&#xD;
fortify the pride of the damsel, and excite her spirits&#xD;
through the agency of her vanity. Pale, but-in the&#xD;
language of Mrs. Foster-" beautiful as an angel," the&#xD;
devoted girl was at length prepared for the conflict and&#xD;
the company. Meanwhile~ let us look after the several&#xD;
claimants for her hand.&#xD;
We need not detail the preliminaries, important to&#xD;
the parties, but not so to us, which were duly arranged&#xD;
among themselves. Time, place, distance, the signal&#xD;
for the start, were 'all agreed upon; and at the proper&#xD;
minute the several competitors, each attended by his&#xD;
friend, appeared upon the ground. Tom Nettles offici-&#xD;
ated on the part of Jones Barry, who' had i~ fact be-&#xD;
come a sort of dependent upon the superior judgment of&#xD;
that humorist, and never failed to seek him on every&#xD;
emergency. Henderson and ilammond were attended&#xD;
by two young men, whom it is not important to introduce&#xD;
more especially to c~ur readers. The word was given,&#xD;
and the three steeds leaped off most beautifully together,&#xD;
but had not~run a hundred yards before the "Fair Geral-&#xD;
dine," as if fearing the loss of her good name in such&#xD;
'formidable rivalry~, or frightened by some unusual object&#xD;
along the roadside, suddenly bolted into the woods, tak-&#xD;
ing' rider through bush and through brier, a formidable&#xD;
chase, which, but for his frequent practice as a fox hunter,&#xD;
'would have certainly endangered his neck. When the&#xD;
unfortunate Barrysucceeded in reining in his capricious&#xD;
beauty, who seemed disposed to emulate her namesake,&#xD;
he found l~is competitors clean gone out of sight, and&#xD;
himself hopelessly distanced. Tie gave up the, chase&#xD;
entirely, and, cantering out into the open track, came&#xD;
forth just as ~Nettles, and the two other bottle-holders,&#xD;
were riding forward to the "Lodge." lie joined them,&#xD;
and, putting~ the best air upon his defeat possible, he&#xD;
&#xD;
told them how it happened. The two friends of Ham-&#xD;
mond and Henderson condoled with him like men of&#xD;
proper gallantry; but Nettles openly congratulated him&#xD;
upon the event.&#xD;
"The hand of fate is in it, Jones. You are destined&#xD;
for Polly Ewbanks, Sukey Davy, or the widow. I'm&#xD;
glad of it. This jade is too high-necked for you, and&#xD;
would have ruined you forever as a good fellow."&#xD;
Thus talking, they wheeled into the avenue. Mean-&#xD;
ivhile, let us hurry to the "Lodge," 4~nd see how things&#xD;
are working there. Geraldine had not long descended&#xD;
to the parlor, and was in the midst of salutations and&#xD;
congratulations innumerable and inconceivable, when&#xD;
the cry rose from the piazza-." They are coming! 'They&#xD;
are coming!" This occasioned a rush. The bride was&#xD;
deserted, and with a strange sinking of the heart, she&#xD;
crouched, rather than reclined, on the sofa, leaving it&#xD;
to others to report the conflict, which she no longer&#xD;
had the courage to behold. Mrs. Foster was the first to&#xD;
bounce into the piazza as she heard the cry. Parson&#xD;
iI3indwell placed himself along-side of her, and the seve-&#xD;
ral groups, according to relationship or intimacy, ranged&#xD;
themselves in near neighborhood. The banisters were&#xD;
thronged, two long benches were filled with crowding&#xD;
forms,' and several stood. upon chairs dragged for the&#xD;
purpose from the parlor. Poor Geraldine hearkened&#xD;
breathlessly to the murmurs and the cries from without.&#xD;
"The sorrel has it!" cried one.&#xD;
"And now the iron 'gray !" cried another.&#xD;
"But where's Barry? Where's Barty ?" was the&#xD;
impatient inquiry of Madam Foster.&#xD;
"Distanced!" was the answer from one of the party,&#xD;
"as I always said he would be."&#xD;
It was evident there were but tWo horsepien, ~nd these'&#xD;
were Hammond and Henderson.~ The race was evidently&#xD;
a close one. Approaching in front, the spectators could&#xD;
see no inequalities in their speed, and opinion was kept&#xD;
in a constant state of fluctuation as they advanced.&#xD;
"Now they come! They coma with a rush!"&#xD;
&#xD;

"The sorrel has it !"&#xD;
"No,,' Ferraunt I'"&#xD;
"It's hard to say which!"&#xD;
"They come! They come&#xD;
At these words, Geraldine could bear the suspense 'no&#xD;
longer. She darted to her' feet, rushed to the door-way&#xD;
just in season to behold the two horses, lock and lock,&#xD;
wheel before the entrance; while the riders, waving and&#xD;
kissing their hands to the company, and bowing their&#xD;
heads, darted away at the same speed in the opposite&#xD;
avenue leading up the road, and were lost to sight in&#xD;
a moment.&#xD;
"What does that mean ?" demanded the parson.&#xD;
"They are off!" said another. "But who won&#xD;
"The iran gray! Hammond was ahead by a neck."&#xD;
"It was close work; neck and neck, and hard to say&#xD;
which had it till the last moment. Then it was that&#xD;
Ran. Hammond's horse came out a neck ahead."&#xD;
such was the verdict, gravely delivered, of those who&#xD;
had most closely watched the cohfliot. But where were&#xD;
the competitors? Where was he who had triumphed,&#xD;
an&amp;amp; to whom the trembling prize was to be awarded?&#xD;
Geraldine did tremble, but it was with a joy which spoke&#xD;
out in her bright eyes, and played in a sweet smile upon&#xD;
~ier pouting lips. But why did not Hammond appear?&#xD;
What could be the meaning of that reverential bow, that&#xD;
wave of the hand, asthe riders continued on their course;&#xD;
and of the long delay Which followed? Meanwhile,&#xD;
Barry and Nettles, with their companions, made their&#xD;
appearance. The misfortune of the former was soon&#xD;
explained; and, in her grief and vexation, Mrs. ~Qster&#xD;
drew him in with her to the well.krwwn little room where&#xD;
he had sipped his tea and toddy at her hands, tQ~reproach&#xD;
him, as W0i1 as she could, for his accident and defeat.&#xD;
lThre he could not help 'the reflection forced upon him&#xD;
by Nettles, that there was really something quite lov-&#xD;
able in the widow. It was while they sat together that&#xD;
Geraldine rushed into the chamber, her face red, her&#xD;
eyes dilating in anger, her whole appearance that of in-&#xD;

dignation almost rising into fury. She held a crumpled&#xD;
paper to her mother, which had once been a neatly-folded&#xD;
billet.&#xD;
"' See to what I am brought b~r your counsel!"&#xD;
The mother read. The note was from Hammond to&#xD;
Geraldine. It ran thus :~&#xD;
"Mr. Hammond presumes that curiosity, as to the&#xD;
respective speed of his and other horses, alone, prompted&#xD;
the singular requisition of Miss Foster, and that she had&#xD;
no serious design of making such performance the con-&#xD;
dition of a 'solemnity so vital' to her happiness as~ that of&#xD;
marriage. Mr. Hammond has done his 'best to graitify&#xD;
'her curiosity, and should be sorry to avail himself of'the&#xD;
result to~the prejudice of Miss Foster. He accordingly&#xD;
begs leave to release her from' anysupposed obligations.&#xD;
'to himself.".&#xD;
"Thsgraced! Insulted!~ ~Qh that I 'were a 'manl&#xD;
That I :had a friend! a brother!" 4&#xD;
The 'widow :pushed Barry, and, ~as Geraldine~ paced&#xD;
the chamber 'with fa&amp;amp; averted, she contrived to whis-&#xD;
per him. ~'He' at once started forwards 'art ~the repeated&#xD;
words-.&#xD;
"That Iwere a man! That I had a brother! 'an&#xD;

"Give me thi~ hand, Miss Geral4ine, and 'I pill "be&#xD;

"Will you kifihim, kill him' ?" she demanded, turning&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
"Who ?"&#xD;
"Who but Randall Hammond? He has degraded&#xD;
me before ~all 'these people. Kill him, and you shall&#xD;

AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
FIST~L5 FOR TWO- j~HE DUEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jorn~s BARRY was greatly elevated by his new com-&#xD;
mission. His vanity was~ immediately tickled by' being&#xD;
adopted as the champion of the fair. He, had heard&#xD;
something of the days and institutions of chivalry, and&#xD;
he felt all over knight-errantish. It was not that he de-&#xD;
sired to shed blood, for he was, in fact, rather a kind-&#xD;
hearted creature; but to be somebody, and to be moving&#xD;
always conspicuously in some one's eyes, was sufficiently&#xD;
grateful to make 'him lose' sight of all other matters.&#xD;
Full of fight, he hurried at once to Tom Nettles, to whom&#xD;
he laid bare all the particulars of his situation.&#xD;
"It's d-~d strange V' said Nettles; '.' and yet I&#xD;
don't know. To touch a woman on that point is to run&#xD;
into the quick with a rusty gimlet. I suppose, since&#xD;
you've pledged yourself to the lady, you'll have to chal-&#xD;
lenge; but Ran. Hammond Will blow you into splinters.&#xD;
He's a dead shot at a shingle."&#xD;
"A shingle's not a man; and I can shdot too. The&#xD;
question is, Tom, will you see to this business for me&#xD;
"Oh, certainly 1"&#xD;
'"Well, ride over to Hammond this morning, make&#xD;
the arrangements, and, after that,' come and give me&#xD;
some practice at the distance."&#xD;
"Very good. I'll rida round to your house from&#xD;
Hammond's in time for diiiner, and we'll make a night&#xD;
of ~t. 'It's no time for ~practice after dinner, so we'll&#xD;
leave that for uiext morning at, sunrise.&#xD;
This being agreed on, Nettles at once proceeded with&#xD;
the challenge, which was peremptory, to Hammond. It&#xD;
must, not be forgotten that the bearer of this letter was&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
a great admirer of Hammond. Nettles only amused&#xD;
himself ~with Barry, and did not respect him.&#xD;
"Why, Nettles 1" said Hammond, "how can I go out&#xD;
with this foolish fellow? The thing is ridiculous. He&#xD;
is the laughing-stock of the country. A goo&amp;amp;meaning;~&#xD;
harmless creature enough, but one whom f should be&#xD;
sorry to think of raising to my level. As a general rule,&#xD;
I have resolved to fight 'anybody that makes a demand&#xD;
on me, if only to prevent annoyance from persons who are'&#xD;
always to be 'found anxious to make for themselves a&#xD;
capital of courage out of your reluctance. But I should&#xD;
be afraid of the ridicule 'which would' attach to a formal&#xD;
combat with one so utterly silly and ridiculous as Barry."&#xD;
"Well! there'e some danger of that, I confess; but&#xD;
we'll keep the thing as quiet' as possible."'&#xD;
"You can't keep it quiet. His vanity will never suf-&#xD;
fer him to sleep until he succeeds in making everybody&#xD;
know that he is a champion for the lady."&#xD;
* "Some~ danger of that; but the truth is, IRan., the&#xD;
fellow is resolved on it; and when that's the ease he can&#xD;
annoy you quite as effectually, and perhaps make' the&#xD;
ridicule much more successful, than it would be if you&#xD;
were to meet him. If you say you won't meet him, why,'&#xD;
I shall give up the business; but, in his present temper,'&#xD;
he'll only seek somebody else, who will be very apt to&#xD;
follow it up, ,and vex you into' it at last. Now, I have&#xD;
a plan by which' to shift the ridicule to the proper&#xD;
shoulders." '&#xD;
He whispered his scheme to Hammond, who heard&#xD;
him with a dubious shake of the head.&#xD;
"If I am to go out," said he, "I should prefer to do&#xD;
so with a serious resolution. I should never wish to&#xD;
trifle in such'nlattrs."&#xD;
Nettles had his 'arguments, and, without being con-&#xD;
vinced, Han~~mond consented that his decision should&#xD;
be referred to Miles' Henderson, whoni 'he' made 'his&#xD;
sense-keeper, as well as friend, on the' occasion. The&#xD;
two rode ~over~ together 'to Henderson's," and 'the 'whole&#xD;
affair was submitted to him. Hammond, as, in duty&#xD;

* bound; put himself in the hands of his friend, and the&#xD;
subtle Nettles found it much' more easy to impress the&#xD;
latter than the former with the propriety of his scheme,&#xD;
whatever that may have been. At present, its purport&#xD;
is concealed from us. Henderson, indeed, was greatly&#xD;
tickled' with it, and Hammond,. still doubting,. was corn.-&#xD;
pelled to submit.&#xD;
"it'll be rare ~port,~R~n. We shall have the laugh&#xD;
to ourselves.~ Let him get the lady if, he can, but, at&#xD;
all events~ gfte him a mighty bad scare. I know Jones&#xD;
well. ile's got as soft a heart as arxylody in the worid~&#xD;
with all his 1 luster and conceit, and if we don't make&#xD;
him run. f~r it, my name's not Nettles."&#xD;
Hammond, it iau~t be confessed, did not altogether&#xD;
relish the cool and philosophical manner with which the&#xD;
other was prepared. to consign the lady to the arms of&#xD;
her champion. lie still felt a deep sympathy with Ge-&#xD;
raldine, though sh~ had greatly mortified his pride, and&#xD;
it was only with the conviction that her conduct had&#xD;
been dictated by a total indifference to his claims, that&#xD;
he was reconciled to yielding her up without.~ farther&#xD;
struggle His' mind was distracted by lurking doubts&#xD;
of this same indifference, and was continually recalling&#xD;
the numerous little instances in her conduct which had&#xD;
encouraged 'him in the belief that she really had a pre-&#xD;
ference for him~; but these impressions he had been&#xD;
comiielled to discard, however unwillingly, in the more&#xD;
recent events which we have described. But her&#xD;
beauties were more deeply engraved upon~ his imagina-&#xD;
tion than he had been willing~ to believe, and he now&#xD;
listened to her final surrender with a secret sense of'&#xD;
pain, of which he was thoroughly ashamed. The plan&#xD;
arranged between Nettles ~and ilenderson for the duel&#xD;
was such as he could not approve of, and he only sub-&#xD;
mitted to it as one accustoms himself, in such cases, to&#xD;
submit to the conclusions of his friends, evei~ where he&#xD;
deems them unwise. it is a matter of punctilio which&#xD;
decides many such affairs, in defiance of the deliberate&#xD;
judgment of nearly all the parties. But upon this head&#xD;

THE TENNESS1~EA~'S STORY.&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
we need not dila~te. Enough that Nettles went off with&#xD;
an acceptance of his challenge. In three days the par-&#xD;
ties were to meet. Time, place, distance, and all' ~he&#xD;
particulars. were fully agreed on between the two&#xD;
seconds, and they proceeded-one of them, at least.-.&#xD;
to put their principals in training. Barry, not a bad&#xD;
~hot before, was practiced every day; at frequent periods,&#xD;
until he could snuff a 'candle.&#xD;
"You're now as good a shot," ,said Nettles, "as'you&#xD;
need be; you can snuff a candle at ten paces.~~&#xD;
"Ain't that famous shooting ?"&#xD;
"Yes; but I've seen Ran. Hammond divide a firefly&#xD;
upon the wing!"&#xD;
Nettles had his own mode of encouragement, truly,&#xD;
and possessed the art, in high degree, of warming and&#xD;
cooling his patient in the same instant-as in Russia,&#xD;
they tell us, a fellow is taken smoking out of the&#xD;
vapor-bath and rolled over and lover in a mountain of&#xD;
snow-and all with the' view to reactions Nettles was&#xD;
never more happy than when he could exercise the&#xD;
nerves of our friend Barry with such pleasant ' contra-&#xD;
dictions. As soon as the duel had been determined&#xD;
upon, and the preparations made, Jones Barry' pro~&#xD;
needed to report progress to the lady whose battle he&#xD;
espoused. Mrs. Foster, we are pleased to state, was&#xD;
now entirely opposed 'to the affair; but Geraldine's&#xD;
anger continued. She had few words; but these 'were&#xD;
all vindictive and wrathful. She'thanked Barry for&#xD;
his zeal, and renewed the assurance that, with the Thil&#xD;
of Hammond, he should have her hand. Nothing was&#xD;
said of ~his own fall;' but, of course, in that event, the&#xD;
hand could be of no use' t'o him. Before the parties&#xD;
separated, Geraldine drew h~m aside.&#xD;
"Mr. Barry, I must be present at this meeting.".&#xD;
"You, Miss Geraldine?"&#xD;
"Yes,' I must see it. I must 'see him fall !"&#xD;
"But how? We have but two friends on each side&#xD;
present."&#xD;
"I care nothing for your fantastic forms.. I must be&#xD;

"Oh! It's strange, it's unreasonable, it's unnatural.&#xD;
F know all that But I must and will be there. Tell&#xD;
me, will you arrange it?"&#xD;
His answer was a compliance, and he kept hi~ word.&#xD;
Concealed in a neighbo~ring.c~pseGeraldine Foster was&#xD;
present when the duel took place. ~he had contrived&#xD;
to get away from the "ILodge" without her mother's&#xD;
knowledge9 The place of meeting was at a spot, about&#xD;
three miles off from it, well known to th'~ combatants of&#xD;
the neighborhood as "2Pistol Quarter." flere, on a&#xD;
pleasant afternoon, not ten days after the equestrian&#xD;
contest for our damsel, the same parties met to decide&#xD;
a more formidable issue. The preliminaries for a duel&#xD;
are n~ually very much alike in all cases, and ~they were&#xD;
not departed from in the present instance. Nettles, for&#xD;
once in his life, seemed thoroughly serious. Lie pro-&#xD;
ceeded to~ hi~ duties with the air of a man who antici-&#xD;
pated the worst, To Barry he said, while placing him-&#xD;
* "You look quite too fierce and vindictive, Barry.&#xD;
I am afraid you have bloody feelings. I trust you 'will&#xD;
ke satisfied with winging him only9"&#xD;
"I am Sworn to kill him," was the stern response.&#xD;
"Then God have mercy on his soul and yours! Should&#xD;
be entertain a like feeling, you will both be at 'Cedar&#xD;
Mount' (the' graveyard) before to-morrow night."&#xD;
Thus saying, he placed his man, and after the lapse&#xD;
of a Cew seconds, the signal words were given: one---~&#xD;
two-.~three!. The sharp fire followed, almost instantane-&#xD;
'.~ ously. For a moment, both parties appeared erect, but,&#xD;
on a sudden, Hammond was seen to totter and" to fall&#xD;
right forward.&#xD;
"The bullet i~ through his heart!" was 'the hurried&#xD;
'speech; of Nettles to his principal. 'To your horse, at&#xD;
once, Jones, and be off as fast as Heaven will let you.&#xD;
It's all over with him."&#xD;

"You've done that same !"&#xD;
"Oh! God have mercy! I'm a murderer!"&#xD;
"IBegone!" and with the words he pushed the paTh&#xD;
and conscience-stricken ~wretch from the ground,~ helped&#xD;

TH1~ GHOST OF A BUGGY.&#xD;
AT this stage of our story, it is just as well that we&#xD;
shoul~1 suffer our Tennessean to .put in.* It is here&#xD;
that he claimed to be privy himself to the affair; 'and,&#xD;
though we despair wholly of being able to give his lan-&#xD;
guage exactly, and certainly shall not attempt to con-&#xD;
vey the slightest idea of his 1~one and inann0r, yet, as a&#xD;
witn~sg on the stand, we conceive it only right that he&#xD;
should speak to those parts of our narrative which he&#xD;
himself beheld. "Tom hadn't forgot," said he, "that&#xD;
when the Ingins in Florida, this Powell, and Wild Cat,&#xD;
and Tiger Tail, and twenty more smart red skins, was&#xD;

Hickory swore a most stupendous oath that Tennessee&#xD;
could find the boys who could clean them out. I reckon&#xD;
I was among the first of the volunteers that turned out&#xD;
when the Gov'nor said we was wanted. I won't tell&#xD;

know, as I said before, that the Tennessee boys didn't&#xD;
do better than other people. Fighting we had, and&#xD;
fight we did, whenever there was a chance for it; but,&#xD;
Lord bless your souls, there was no more seeing your&#xD;
inimy till his bullet was in your gizzard, than there was&#xD;
swallowing it afterwards with a goo~l dige9fion. And&#xD;
when you did see the red skin, it was on a smart gallop,&#xD;

to dross, belly-deep all the way, before you could get&#xD;

We ~Ju~rge4 with. &amp;amp;'big shout into the hammocks-the&#xD;

us over, n~an afte~ man, as they run from tree to tree,&#xD;

when 1 and twenty others was. wading through a good&#xD;

front, where the ingins harbored, and jest when they&#xD;
were blazing away their hottest, who should ~we see,&#xD;
ahead of us all, but a man rather under the middle size&#xD;
-.--a white man-as ragged as a gypsy, without any hat,&#xD;
land with an old musket in his hand, pushing across,&#xD;
shouting hi~ best, and full in the face of the fire of the&#xD;
red skins? Jest then, when we were all beginning to&#xD;
feel squeainish~ he was going ahead, and whooping, with~&#xD;
Qut a bit of scare in. him. Well, that encouraged us.&#xD;
We saw the Ingins aim at him, and I reckon his rags&#xD;
had the marks of more than a, dozen bullets; but he&#xD;
didn't seem to mind 'em, and they sartainly never one&#xD;
of thorn troubled him. Away he went, shouting and&#xD;
shaking hi~ musket, and away we went after him, and&#xD;
away the Indians went before us all. We drove 'em,&#xD;
and got the victory. We picked up some scalps, but&#xD;
nothing to speak of, and lost some good fellows. But&#xD;
I tell you that ragged volunteer went ahead of us all,&#xD;
and he was this same Jones Barry, about whom I've&#xD;
been telling you this long story. lie had run all the&#xD;
way from Georgy into Florida after killing Hammond,&#xD;
without knowing much where he went. Never in his&#xD;
life had any rm~n so bad a scare. lie had run, as I&#xD;
may say, into the arms of the Ingins, without hearing&#xD;
their rifles; and I do believe, as I am a free white man,&#xD;

that he scared them a gr~at deal worse than our whole&#xD;
Tennessee regiment. For, look you, he was a man to&#xD;
sca e people. He was, as J tell you, in rags from head&#xD;
to foot. He had been living among the briers, run-&#xD;
ning into, them almost at -every sound. He had no&#xD;
covering for his head. His eyes were bloodshot; his&#xD;
Lace scratched over, and bleeding-on all 8ide~; and his'&#xD;
hair had~grown ha;lf white in twenty days. He looked&#xD;
for all the world like a madman. He was a madman;&#xD;
and, though he fought with us, and, marched with us,'&#xD;
and did everything pretty much as he saw u~ do, yet&#xD;
his seflses, I'm mighty sur~e, were, all the time; more&#xD;
than a hundred miles away. Somehow, the poor fellow&#xD;
got in with me. We marched together and slept to-&#xD;
* gather. I reckon he saw that I was a good-natured&#xD;
chap, and so he tuk to me. I soon saw that he was&#xD;
miserable-that there was a scare that was gnawing in&#xD;
him all the time-and after awhile I found- out that he&#xD;
was haunted constantly by the ghost of -Randall 11am-&#xD;
mond. One night he ran out of the tent with a terrible&#xD;
fright. Another time, when standing with a -sentry, he&#xD;
fired his ~iece~ and gave the alarm to the whole army.&#xD;
Then he'd. fall upon his knees and bog for mercy, and&#xD;
cover his eyes with his hands, as if to shut out some&#xD;
frightful thing he - couldn't bear to look upon~ Some-&#xD;
times he'd run into the hammock at midnight, tiever&#xD;
fearing the Ingins, though we all thought it as much as&#xD;
one's life was worth to go near it. - It was the dead he&#xD;
was afraid of all- the time. Now, there was a sodger-&#xD;
among the rig'lars to whom Jones Barry one night made&#xD;
confession and eased his heart of all its secrets. But&#xD;
it didn't ease him of his misery. The soldier came -to&#xD;
me and told me all, and I ax'd Barry; but then he was&#xD;
shy, and swore that he never told the fellow any such&#xD;
thing. - But it wasn't more than twenty~f'our hours-after,&#xD;
when-he come to inc and said-&#xD;
"-'I can't stand it much longer. I'm- almost crazy&#xD;
now. Ran. ilanimond comes to me every night. I'm&#xD;
his murderer, and he will have my blood. I must go&#xD;

back to ,Georgy, and stand trial. I'll go and give my-&#xD;
self up.&#xD;
"'Well,' says I, 'nay poor fellow, if you'll only wait&#xD;
till we're mustered out of service, I'll go along with.&#xD;
~OUi I'm sorry for you, and I don't think you're so&#xD;
much to blame. You've got a heart a little too tender;&#xD;
o~id as you killed your man in a fair fight, I don't see&#xD;
as how he should haunt you. He had as much chance&#xD;
at you, as you at him."&#xD;
"'Yes! but I thirsted for his blood, and he never did&#xD;
me any harm.' lie was a good man too! I must go&#xD;
back. I will deliver myself. I see him every night,&#xD;
covered with~blood, and beckoning me, with his hands,&#xD;
to come. It's he leads me into the hammock and there&#xD;
leaves me. I must go back and give mself&#xD;

"'Well, only wait till we're mustered out, and I'll go&#xD;
wi1~h yow'&#xD;
"He promised and did wait, and I kept my word. As&#xD;
soon as I got my discharge, I said~to Barry, 'I'm ready.'&#xD;
We bought a pair of stout Seminole ponies, on a credit&#xD;
from our commissariat, and w~nt off like gentlemen sob&#xD;
dier~. I mustn't forget to tell you that he killed the&#xD;
mare that he made so much brag about, the 'Fair Ge-&#xD;
raldine,' in. his run from Georgy, and tuk it on foot as&#xD;
soon as he got near the Ingin country. ,How he lived,&#xD;
God only knows, for I never saw a poor innocent eat&#xD;
so little. But I encouraged him, and made light of&#xD;
his mischief; and by little and little he began to im-&#xD;
pr6ve~ We got him seine new clothes as soon as we&#xD;
struck- the settlement; wand, I think, when he got them&#xD;
on, his appetite came~ back a little to' him. One night,&#xD;
the first night after we crossed the Georgy line, lie ate&#xD;
a pretty good supper of bacon and eggs. I think-'twa~&#xD;
all oWitig to his clothes. But that very night he gave&#xD;
me and the wh&amp;amp;le house a most -outrageous scare. He&#xD;
broke out in his night-shirt, and dashed out of the room,&#xD;
and down the stairs into the hall, where he squatted&#xD;

&#xD;
under the table. We -slept in the same room, ~nd as&#xD;
soon as I could slip on my breeches I made after him.&#xD;
He swore that the ghost of Hammond sqn~tted down at&#xD;
the foot of the bed, and looked over into his face, though&#xD;
he tried to cover with the quilt. 'I told him 'twas the&#xD;
hot supper that gaveAhim the nightmare, and I 'm~de&#xD;
him take a pretty deep swallow of apple-toddy, that the&#xD;
landlord made for us, after we routed him up with ~uoh&#xD;
a scrimmage. Well, so we went; now better, now ~worse;&#xD;
now calm, and now stormy, till we got ~pretty nigh his&#xD;
county, where all' these things took place. Then his&#xD;
scare came back to him, then his heart failed him; and&#xD;
just when the ghost stopped troubling him, he began to&#xD;
be troubled by the fear of the lavr~ But I said to him-&#xD;
"'Be a man. You've come so far, see it out. Better&#xD;
be hung and have it over, than to be scared to ~1eath&#xD;
every night.'&#xD;
"He groaned most bitterly, but he said, ' You'reright!&#xD;
I can't stand to suffer as 'I have suffered. I'm only&#xD;
twenty-six; and look, my head's half whites! Pm an old&#xD;
man in the feel as well as in the look. The ghost of&#xD;
Ran. Hammond has done me worsa 't'han my pistol ever&#xD;
did him. He's given me a hell upon earth, iso that I&#xD;
can't believe there's any half so bad for ixie hereafter.&#xD;
Go ahead!'&#xD;
"And so ~we went forward. It was a most. sweet and&#xD;
beautiful afternoon when we came into the'very' neigh-&#xD;
borhood of all these doings. We :had -passed several&#xD;
places that were famous in his recollection. There was&#xD;
Hullabee racecourse, where they had the ~gander-pulling,&#xD;
and the circus, and 'soon we drew nigh to 4he groat&#xD;
avenue leading to the 'Lodge,' where the y&amp;amp;ung lady&#xD;
lived that had been the cause of all the iuischidf~ / But&#xD;
it wasn't 'there that Barry wanted 'to go. The ~flmt&#xD;
place he wished, to strike for was the' farm of his 'friend&#xD;
Nettles, and we 'Were only 'a half a mile from ~it, acoord-&#xD;
ing to Barry's calculations, when we came, ~bya sudden&#xD;
turn in the road, upon a buggy dra~Vn by a splendid&#xD;
&#xD;
horse, and carrying two people. ~On~e of them 'was a tall&#xD;
and noble-looking gentIeman~ and the '6th~ ~was a most&#xD;
beautiful lady, perhaps about the most beautiful' I ever&#xD;
did see. They were coming right towards us at a 8mart&#xD;
trot~' and, the moment Barry laid eyes fairly. iip6n~ them,&#xD;
he turned pale as death, and dashed his horse into the&#xD;
bushes and off the road. I followed after him as soon&#xD;
as I could get a chance, but not till I had taken a good&#xD;
look at the strangers that seemed to frighten him so&#xD;
much. They rode by in a minute, and the gentleman&#xD;
gave me a civil bow as he passed. Then I pushed into&#xD;
the woods after Barry. I found him off his horse and&#xD;
hiding in the bushes, all over covered with a sweat, and&#xD;
trembling like a leaf in the wind.&#xD;
"'Why, what on airth,' says II, 'is the matter now?&#xD;
What has, scared you so?'&#xD;
"'Didn't you see him?'&#xD;
"' 'Who?"&#xD;
"'Hammond! 'Twas his ghost in the buggy!' -&#xD;
"'And what has his ghost to do in a buggy, I wonder?&#xD;
and who ever saw the ghost of a buggy before?' said II.&#xD;
'I don't believe much in. such a notion, and if that was&#xD;
Hammond's gho'~st, I wonder what woman's ghost it was&#xD;
sitting along-side of him. If woman ghosts are so&#xD;
pretty, I shouldn't be much afraid of 'em myself.'&#xD;
"'Woman!' said Barry, mightily bewildered. 'Was&#xD;
there a woman with him?'&#xD;
"'Yes, as surely as there was a buggy and ~ man.&#xD;
Now look you, Barry; if that was Hammond in the&#xD;
buggy, he's just as much alive as you and me. The&#xD;
chance is, after all, that ybu only wounded him, aud&#xD;
you and your friend took a mortal scare too soon'&#xD;
"'No! no!' said he, very mournfully; 'haven't I&#xD;
seen him almost every night? hasn't he followed me&#xD;
everywhere ?-into the woods, into the swamps, into the&#xD;
hammock of the Ingins? and aiii't my head gray with his&#xD;
coming?'&#xD;
"'I don't know,' says I; 'but if that was fiammond&#xD;
in the hu~gy, he's no ghost; and it's your conscience&#xD;

on the grass' just where lie had fallen, his bo&#xD;

upon him wUh acry which betrayed the wild&#xD;
of personal sufibring.&#xD;
"I have, stain him-I have slain him! 'Spe~&#xD;

&#xD;
take me with you, Hammond! At this moment, I am&#xD;
yours only! I loved you only ~from the first !"&#xD;
~Nettles winked to the prostrate man, and made certain&#xD;
motions which, strictly construed, might be supposed to&#xD;
mean, "Take h.er at her word, marry her on the spot ;"&#xD;
and the looks and signs of' Hendersn, now thoroughly&#xD;
cured of his passion, were equally significant to tHe same&#xD;
effect. But Hammond was superior to the temptation.'&#xD;
"Nay, Geraldine, you are deceived. I am in no dan-&#xD;
ger; indeed, I am unhurt."&#xD;
She started as if to rise, but he now restrained her,&#xD;
and, koking to his friends, motioned their departure.&#xD;
"What does this mean.?" she demanded.&#xD;
~" Hear me patiently, Geraldine, and let me plead in&#xD;
turn for your forgiveness. ~t ~neans a foolish hoax, in&#xD;
,which nobody ever dreamed that you would be a party.&#xD;
I am unwounded, :and the ~object has been simply to&#xD;
scare the foolish person who, without provocation, has&#xD;
sought my life."&#xD;
'~' Without. provocation, Mr. Hammond? Do you&#xD;
forget the cruel insult you put upon me? Was it no&#xD;
provocation .to shame a young maiden before all her&#xD;
friends and people? Oh, Hammond, how could you do&#xD;
me so~..-you, for ~hom. I showed but too much prefer-&#xD;
ence from the beginning, in spite' of all that my ~mother&#xD;
would say ?"&#xD;
~" Will you suffer me to repent, Geral'dinQ.-~o make&#xD;
amends ?" And, by this time; the arm of the leader&#xD;
was rotjnd about her waist, and his lips were pressed&#xD;
npqn hers, and alone in that haunted ~wood, famous for&#xD;
its' many murders, the. twO were .belrothed with all the&#xD;
dearest'promises of love., We need not follow the pro-&#xD;
gre~s ~of. the scene. Enough t~. say that the persons&#xD;
whom Ba1rry and his friend, from 2Tennessee encountered&#xD;
in the ~buggy, were Mr. and 'Mrs. Hammond~ They&#xD;
had been filly' three months married, and were living&#xD;
very cofrifo~tably' together at the residence of 11am-&#xD;
mond's mother; while Mrs. Foster, vexed to the heart,&#xD;
was chewing the cud of disappointment at the "Lodge"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TENNESSEEAN' S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
245&#xD;
&#xD;
alon&amp;amp; All these facts were gathered from~ Torn Net-&#xD;
tles, who very frankly declared his agency ~n the pro-&#xD;
ceedings.&#xD;
"I'm blowed," said the Tennesseean, "if I was&#xD;
Barry, if I wouldn't have, a real fight~ on the' strength&#xD;
of it, and I'd make you my mark, my man."&#xD;
But Barry himself shook his head.&#xD;
"I've had enough of killing," said he.&#xD;
"I can. ~put you in the way of something better,," 8aid&#xD;
Nettles.' "Folly E'wbanks. is still alive, single, and fat&#xD;
as ever; Sukey Pavy still' keeps the bar at 'the old man's&#xD;
cOrner; and' Mrs. Fosterlooks as well as I have eyer&#xD;
seen her, and 'keeps. a most excellent table. I'm will~rig&#xD;
to make amends; Joiies, for' what harm I"re done you,&#xD;
by doing you finally 'for better or 'worse.' Now, 'if&#xD;
there's a man to manage either of these three pre.tty~&#xD;
pieces of mortality, I'm' tLai~ person. Shall it be 'hack&#xD;
to back, Mjss' ]?olly.-~-'"&#xD;
"Hush,' you Satan' !'-"&#xD;
"Or, 'Is it to your liking, sir'?'&#xD;
" Devil !"&#xD;
"Or, 'Is it more. of the honey or more of the 'peach,&#xD;
dear 1Jh'~ Barry?'"'&#xD;
The Tennesseean lingered a week among, his. new&#xD;
friends, and became so much enamored of Nettles that&#xD;
he asked him home with him. But the latter, born for&#xD;
the use of his neighbors, had a eommission~in hand 'for&#xD;
Barry that was somewhat urgently pressed. His hints&#xD;
~had not been' wholly thrown away~. and Barry, among&#xD;
his latter-day reveries, was frequently and pleasurably&#xD;
entertained by the recollection of tha~t ou~ of tea~' and&#xD;
that bowl of toddy, by which the widow Foster had re~&#xD;
freshed him in the'little baok room of her domicik He&#xD;
remembered her round, well;proportior~edi figure, the&#xD;
sw~ect. smile upon her face, the pleasant' sparkle in her&#xD;
eye, and the grateful beverag~ in her hand;~ and 'he so&#xD;
earnestly pressed his ruminations and convictions on hi~&#xD;
friend Nettles, that the latter posted off one pleasant&#xD;
afternoon to the "Lodge," and did not return home&#xD;

~unti ~the nest day. He was; as usual, received ia~ the&#xD;
kindest ni~nner. by the widow.. He had always been&#xD;
solicitous of her favor, on the score of his just apprecia-&#xD;
tion of her'dinners and eVening, p~irti&amp;amp;s. If Nettles had&#xD;
~ Wea~kne8S at all, it lay in. his passion for the creature&#xD;
comforts. He had always~ taken care to please her&#xD;
accordingly, and she was always glad to welcome him.&#xD;
He was a good eoinp~anion, who picked up all the scandal&#xD;
going, and was. ever ready for any mischief. We~will&#xD;
suppose that, when the hour came foir the evening meal,&#xD;
he found ~nd ~enjoyed a delightful supper. The widow&#xD;
was unusually 'fresh ami attractive.. She had stolen off&#xD;
soon after his arrival, leaving him to adjust ihis six-feet&#xD;
upon the sofa, while she consulted her toilet.' She re-&#xD;
~turned. ju~st as he 'was emerging from his 8iesta, looking&#xD;
1ike~ Cleopatra, except that 'her dimensions were not so&#xD;
great, ~her skin: so dark, nor 'her 'jewels quite so magni-&#xD;
ficent as those of that famous queen of Egypt..&#xD;
"Really, Mrs. Foster, you grow younger and more&#xD;
fascinating ever5r time I see you."'&#xD;
These gallant words accompanied a graceful taking&#xD;
and s~n&amp;amp;eiing of the fair 'l&amp;amp;dy's hand. "' There is one&#xD;
thing, however, which I think faulty about you."&#xD;
"Faulty 1" in ~onsternation.&#xD;
"Yes, faulty I 'and ',the fault is in, your mind, your&#xD;
'feelings, ~your thoughtss, your 'sentiments."&#xD;
'A'1nd~ed, Mr. 'Nettles V' bewildered.&#xD;
"' Yes; 'madam! it consists in your contentment; in'&#xD;
that cold disdain oi' humanity~; in that scornful indiffer-&#xD;
ence~~to my sexy which makes you willing to sacri~ce. this&#xD;

foolisk virgins thut were unprepared at the coming, of&#xD;
the bridegroom."&#xD;
"Yes, sir! but 'even were I to allow that, there is still&#xD;
another difficulty. The' bridegroom does not happen ~so&#xD;
frequently in a~ widow's chances that she can change&#xD;
her solitary condition when she pleases; and, unless&#xD;
there is a prospect Df his coming, what's the- policy of&#xD;
her admitting that she finds her solitude unpleasant?"&#xD;
"Mrs. Foster, many a man would WOO if the lady&#xD;
would only coo; but men, you are aware, are naturally&#xD;
modest."&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Nettles!"&#xD;
"They are, madam! they are! It is the woman al-&#xD;
ways that is' the tempter, and naturally enough. If we&#xD;
put a very high estimate on her value, we are apt to.&#xD;
feel that 'we fall ~below it, and we approach her rather&#xD;
with a sense of her superior, merits and position than of&#xD;
our passion, though it may burn us up all the while.&#xD;
Now, a case happens at this moment to my knowledge,&#xD;
and I must say that' you are interested in it.".&#xD;
"Me,'sir!"&#xD;
"Yes, Mrs. Foster, you! I know a gentleman who&#xD;
feels for you a' most profound passion, but who dares&#xD;
riot-&#xD;
"Nay, Mr. Nettles! what have you ever seen about&#xD;
me that should repel or discourage any gentleman ?"&#xD;
and the lady smoothed down the folds of her dress, and,&#xD;
smiling sweetly, inclined somewhat to the speaker.&#xD;
"The beautiful crocodile !" thought ~Nettles, to him-&#xD;
'self; " she evidently suspects me of being %this bashful*&#xD;
gentleman. What ~a harpy !"&#xD;
But, though thus thinking, he never~suffered his eyes&#xD;
to breathe any but an expressionn of tender interest and&#xD;
regard~ Still, fearing that she might assume too much,&#xD;
as Nettles never deceived himself in" the opinion tha't he&#xD;
was a very personableinan. and likely to prove quite too&#xD;
attractive for most women, he hurried'forward ;t~ a full&#xD;
revelation of his object, and of the' person in whose be-&#xD;
half he came. He had his own way of doing this.&#xD;

"Mrs. Foster," said he, gravely, "you have certainly&#xD;
shown yourself to be the most remarkable of women. I&#xD;
have seen 'you. for six months working busily to procure&#xD;
for another the devotion which was all the while over-&#xD;
flowing £er yourself."&#xD;
"Really, Mr. Nettles, you speak pa~ables. What&#xD;
are you driving at ?"&#xD;
"Let me explain. ~ou 'will do me the justice to&#xD;
admit that if anybody knows the people of this county,&#xD;
man woman, hoyden and hobby-de-hoy, 'i~ is myself."&#xD;
"Granted, sir!"&#xD;
'~ "Some of these have been accustomed to consult me&#xD;
'~ in the most important matters. Among these persons&#xD;
is my friend Jones Barry. You partially took him out&#xD;
of ~my hands, but you played your hands badly. You&#xD;

in love with Miss Geraldine-~"&#xD;
"Don't speak of that young lady in my hearing, I beg&#xD;
you, Mr. Nettles !"&#xD;
"Pardon me; but I can't. help it; it's necessary to&#xD;
what I've .got to 'say. But I'll not 'dwell upon it. Well,&#xD;
a~ I tell you, at the very time that you were doing your&#xD;
best, against nature and yourself, to force this belief 'into&#xD;
biB heart, the 'poor fellow was devotedly attached to an.-&#xD;
'other."&#xD;
"'Indeed! You surprise me, sir."&#xD;
"Such wa~ your powerful influence&amp;amp; over him, that&#xD;
'you could persuade him to 'anything; and, yielding to&#xD;
your seeming wishes and opinions, he 'professed attach-&#xD;
ment to your step-daughter, while his heart was all the&#xD;
time ready to burst with a; passion for yourself."&#xD;
"For me, sir? Jones Barry fond of me&#xD;
"To devotion-ito distraction; and how you 'could be&#xD;
so blind. as not to have seen it, passes my iii~agination.&#xD;
How soften has he consulted witk me on this very' sub-&#xD;
ject!' How oftenha~e I told him, C Come out hue' a man,&#xD;
'and tell her what you feel!' His' only answer was:&#xD;
'No! "She doesn't think of me. ft's evident she thinks&#xD;
only of the marriage of *Geraldine. She will never&#xD;
&#xD;
'marry again. Her heart's in the grave with Foster!'&#xD;
Then he would weep, and say: 'I must marry Geraldine,&#xD;
if it's only to be near to her!"'&#xD;
"Poor Jones! and how he concealed it!"'&#xD;
"Concealed it? No, madam, it was only from 7/0U7&#xD;
eyes that he concealed it. It Wasn't his art in hiding;&#xD;
* it was your blindness in' not seeing. Why, the night of&#xD;
the fete, he said to me that, when you fed him with tea&#xD;
from the cup, while he satinn a chair in your little back-&#xD;
room, he thought he should overflow with delight, and&#xD;
the next day, when you mixed him some peach toddy, he&#xD;
said, 'coming from your hands, it was the most delicious&#xD;
dram that ever his lips had tasted.'"&#xD;
"Dear Jones, and he felt all this?"'&#xD;
"All this, and was silent!"&#xD;
"And I was doing n~iy best 'to force him upon ~one&#xD;
who didn't care a straw for him."&#xD;
"Suicidally, as I called it; for, aslsaid to him, you&#xD;
are evidently made. for' each other."&#xD;
"You said that, Mr. Nettles? Ah! you're a sharp~&#xD;

"Says I,," Barry! Foster is young and lovable.&#xD;
She's scarcely older tha r step-daughter. She's un-&#xD;
selfish. She sees that you are the man to make G~ral-&#xD;
dine happy, because she, feels that you would make her-&#xD;
self so; and she ought~ not to be permitted to sacrifice&#xD;
herself. Go to her, tell her the truth, lay your whole&#xD;
heart open to her, and my life on it, she will then dis-&#xD;
cover what, perhaps, she does not yet see, that you&#xD;
have taken a deeper hold on her own heart than she&#xD;
has, any idea. At her, like a man ~ and,' if she be the&#xD;
tender-hearted woman that I think her, she will not~&#xD;
reject you.'"&#xD;
The widow sighed deeply. "But he did not 'follow&#xD;
your counsel?"&#xD;
"He 'did not believe me. His fears ~bhin4ed him.&#xD;
He worshipped, you too devotedly. Had he felt, a weaker&#xD;
passion, he would have been more bqld. But his heart&#xD;
failed him, and he would have 'suffered himself to~ be&#xD;

&#xD;
srhot; nay, don't I know that* he weiat out fully expect~&#xD;
ing to be killed by Hammond's bullet, even hoping it,&#xD;
that he might no longer be kept in such miserable&#xD;
anxiety ?"&#xD;
"Poor, poor fellow!"&#xD;
"And now, that he knows my object in coming here,&#xD;
he is onthorns of misery. His, horse is already saddled.&#xD;
iTh li&amp;amp;s~raised all ~the ready money he can, and, the mo-&#xD;
ment he gets my report, if it's unfavorable, he'll set off&#xD;
to join his fat'friend in Tennessee. He will sell out, and&#xD;
leave Georgia forever. He even talks of joining the&#xD;
regular army, hoping to be killed in the first engage-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"But he' must never do 'it."&#xD;
"It will depend on you. He is at' my house waiting.&#xD;
I have agr~edithat, if I am successful, I am t6 wave a&#xD;
white handkerchief, and if not, a red one, just as I get&#xD;
in the avenue. His mind's in a most awful state, and&#xD;
it'd for you, my dear Mrs. Foster, to' determine his&#xD;
fate."&#xD;
"Oh! Mr. Kettles, you see ~oo deeply into the hearts&#xD;
of us poor women to doubt what must 'be 'my answer.&#xD;
Poor, dear Barry, I always was fond of him. But I&#xD;
never thought he had any feeling for me, and so I tried&#xD;
'only to get for' him' that disobedient girl."&#xD;
"What blindness! And so&#xD;
"'Oh !' you do with me what you please, Mr. Nettles.&#xD;
It's a wonder' you never married yourself. You're&#xD;
single only because you never wished to be otherwise."&#xD;
"' Ah! you flatter me, Foster! But I must ,resign&#xD;
my hopes and wishes to ethers. I live for myfriends&#xD;
only. But, in giving. them up, I have' my consolation;&#xD;
and when carrying off the heart of a lady to.~nothcr, I&#xD;
am privileged, as a matter of course; to take her ~kisses&#xD;
fom' myself.~"&#xD;
The' widow 'did not struggle seriously against the&#xD;
spoliation"~which followed this pretty speech.&#xD;
Barry will be the happiest man alive."&#xD;
"But have you' a white handkerchief with you? I&#xD;
&#xD;
see that you use4a red one," demanded the provident&#xD;
widow.&#xD;
"Indeed I have not !" said Nettles, feeling in. his&#xD;
pockets, and looking disquieted.&#xD;
"Take mine, dear Mr. Nettles. Poor Barry, he&#xD;
must not be suffered to throw himself away !"&#xD;
* How Nettles chuckled as he left the "Lodge !" In&#xD;
'less than a month, the widow became Mrs. Barry. We&#xD;
have no reason to suppose that her husband repented&#xD;
the proceeding, and we know that Nettles did not. He&#xD;
usually took his Sunday dinner at the "Lodge," and&#xD;
was master of ceremonies on all occasions. He himself&#xD;
never married. Why should he, when he could so easily&#xD;
persuade his friends to do so? Miles Henderson, in&#xD;
the course of the year, was caught by Henrietta Bailey,&#xD;
one of the girls of whom Mrs. Hammond thought so&#xD;
much; and he lived sufficiently happy with her to feel&#xD;
no repinings at the sweet and singular affection which&#xD;
existed between Hammond and his wife. lie, it is true,&#xD;
remained the master, but she exercised, though she did&#xD;
not assert, all the authority of the mistress.' There&#xD;
has been no duel at "Pistol Quarter" since the famous&#xD;
affair that terminated the tragic part of our comedy.&#xD;
THE END.&#xD;
