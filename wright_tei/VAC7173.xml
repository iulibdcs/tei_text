            <head>TO J. S. REDFIELD, ESQ.</head>
            <p>MY DEAR SIR:—The deified heroes of the Norse mythology are believed to spend their
               afternoons in drinking something stronger than lemonade out of their enemies' skulls,
               and some ill-natured persons, seizing on the idea, have declared that publishers use
               the skulls of their authors as drinking-cups, in the same manner. For my own part, I
               discredit the assertion—as far as my relations with yourself enable me to judge; I
               suspect that the time has gone by when Napoleon's health was drank as "a friend of
               literature," because he had shot a bookseller; and I give you unlimited permission to
               use my skull, in the Norse fashion, provided that you wait until "in death I shall
               calm recline," when I shall have no further occasion for it. In such case, the least
               you can do will be to drink my memory, "in solemn silence"—the beverage being
               whiskey-punch, as a delicate compliment to my country.</p>
            <pb n="iv-v (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7173-00000003"/>
            <p>Seriously speaking (or writing), however, I take leave to dedicate this volume to
               you, with the solemn assurance that my doing so must not be taken as—a Bit of
               Blarney.</p>
            <p>The book is Irish—to all intents and purposes, and is put forth with the least
               possible pretence. It contains Legends—familiar to me in my youth; Stories, which,
               more or less, are literally "founded upon facts;" recollections of Eccentric
               Characters, whose peculiarities it would have been difficult to exaggerate;—and
               Sketches of the two great Irish leaders of the last and present century, Grattan, who
               won National Independence for Ireland, and O'Connell, who obtained Emancipation for
               the great majority of his countrymen. The Sketch of the great Agitator has extended
               almost to a biography—but I knew the man well, and write of him on that knowledge. In
                  <emph>this</emph> volume he is certainly entitled to a niche, having been the
               greatest professor of "Blarney" these later days have seen or heard.</p>

                  <head>BITS OF BLARNEY.</head>
                  <p>How many have heard of "Blarney," and how few know how and why this appropriate
                     term has originated! How could they, indeed, unless they had made a pilgrimage
                     to the Castle, as I did, in order to manœuvre Tim Cronin into a narration of
                     its legends?—They may go to Blarney, whenever they please, but the <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">genius loci</foreign> has vanished. Tim Cronin has been
                     gathered to his fathers. By no lingering or vulgar disease did he perish; he
                     died——of a sudden.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely any part of Ireland has attained more celebrity than the far-famed
                     village of Blarney, in the country, and near the city of Cork. At Blarney may
                     be seen the mysterious talisman, which has the extraordinary power of
                     conferring remarkable gifts of persuasion on the lips which, with due reverence
                     and proper faith in its virtues, invoke the hidden genii of The Stone, to yield
                     them its inspiration. The ceremony is brief:—only a kiss on the flinty rock,
                     and the kisser is instantly endowed with the<pb n="10-11"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000006"/> happy faculty of flattering the fair sex
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad libitum,</foreign> without their once suspecting
                     that it can be flattery. On the masculine gender it is not less effective.
                     Altogether, it enables the kisser, like History, <q>
                        <l>"To lie like truth, and still most truly lie."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Immortal poesie has already celebrated the locality of Blarney. The far-famed
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chanson,</foreign> written by Richard Alfred
                        Milliken,<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                     and called "The Groves of Blarney," has been heard or read by every one:—in
                     these later days the polyglot edition, by him who has assumed the name of
                     Father Prout, is well known to the public. There is an interpolated verse,
                     which may be adopted (as it sometimes is) into the original <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">chanson,</foreign> on account of the earnestness with which
                     it declares that <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"The stone this is, whoever kisses,</l>

                     </q> Blarney Castle is surrounded by the Groves mentioned in the song. It
                     stands four miles to the northwest of "the beautiful city called Cork," and, of
                     course, in the fox-hunting district of Muskerry. All that can now be seen are
                     the remains of an antique castellated pile, to the east of which was rather
                     incongruously attached, a century ago, a large mansion of modern
                     architecture.</p>

                  <p>The Castle stands on the north side of a precipitous ridge of limestone rock,
                     rising from a deep valley, and its base is washed by a small and beautifully
                     clear river called the Aw-martin. A large, square, and massive tower—a sort of
                     Keep,—is all that remains of the original fortress. The top of this building is
                     surrounded with a parapet, breast-high, and on the very summit is the famous
                     Stone which is said to possess the power, already mentioned, of conferring on
                     every gentleman who <emph>kisses</emph> it the peculiar property of telling any
                     thing, in the way of praise (commonly called flattery), with unblushing cheek
                     and "forehead unabashed." As the fair sex have to receive, rather than bestow
                     compliments, the oscular homage to the Stone conveys no power to
                        <emph>them.</emph> From the virtues which it communicates to the masculine
                     pilgrims, we have the well-known term <hi rend="i"/>blarney and <hi rend="i"
                     />blarney-stone.</p>
                  <p>The real Stone is in such a dangerous position, from its elevation, that it is
                     rarely kissed, except by very adventurous pilgrims of the Tom Sheridan class,
                     who will <emph>do</emph> the thing, and not be content<pb n="12-13"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000007"/> with saying they have done it! The stone which
                     officiates as its deputy, is one which was loosened by a shot from the cannon
                     of Oliver Cromwell's troops, who were encamped on the hill behind the Castle.
                     This stone is secured in its place by iron stanchions, and it is this that the
                     visitors kiss, as aforesaid, and by mistake. The Song, it may be remembered,
                     speaks of the Cromwellian bombardment of the Castle: <q>

                  <p>When Sir Walter Scott was in Ireland, he visited Blarney, accompanied by Anne
                     Scott, Miss Edgeworth, and Mr. Lockhart. A few days after he was there, it was
                     my fortune to tread in his steps to the same classic shrine.</p>
                  <p>The barefooted and talkative guide who <emph>would</emph> accompany me over the
                     Castle, thus described "the Ariosto of the North," and his companions:—"A tall,
                     bulky man, who halted a great deal, came here, with his daughter and a very
                     small lady, and a dash of a gentleman, with a bright keen eye that looked here,
                     and there, and everywhere in a minute. They thrust themselves, ransacking, into
                     every nook and cranny that a rat would not go through, scarcely. When the lame
                     gentleman came to the top of the Castle, wasn't he delighted, and didn't he
                     take all the country down upon paper with a pencil, while one of us sang 'The
                     Groves of Blarney.' He made us sing it again, and gave me a crown-piece, and
                     said that he'd converse a poem on the Castle, himself, may-be!"</p>
                  <p>While I am thus gossiping, I am neglecting Tim Cronin, "the best story-teller"
                     (to use his own words) "within the whole length, and breadth, and cubic
                     mensuration of the Island."</p>
                  <p>After my visit to Blarney Castle, I met this worthy. I had struck from the
                     common path into that which led through the Rock Close. This valley is divided
                     into several fields, all of which are extremely fertile, except that
                     immediately washed by the waters of the lake. It was now far in the summer;
                     and, although the mowers<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7173-00000008"/> had to cut
                     down the rich grass of the other fields, there was scarcely a blade upon this.
                     It was as smooth, green, and close-shaven as the trim turf before a cottage
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ornée.</foreign> While I was remarking this, I was
                     startled by a sudden touch upon the shoulder, and, turning round, I found
                     myself <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vis-à-vis</foreign> with a Herculean-built
                     fellow, who doffed his hat, with a sort of rude courtesy, made an attempt at a
                     bow, and, before I could say a word, struck into conversation.</p>
                  <p>"Wondering at this meadow being so bare, I warrant you, sir?"</p>
                  <p>I confessed that it had surprised me.</p>
                  <p>"Didn't know the why nor the wherefore of it, may-be? It's Tim Cronin—and
                     that's myself—that can tell you all about it, before you have time to get
                     fat."</p>
                  <p>I ventured to exhibit my ignorance, by asking who Tim Cronin might be?</p>
                  <p>"Faith, sir, you may know a great deal of Latin and Greek—and 'tis easy to see
                     that the College mark is upon you—but you know little of <emph>real</emph>
                     literature in old Ireland, if you don't know <emph>me.</emph> Not know Cronin,
                     the renowned Philomath, that bothered the Provost of old Trinity in
                     Algebra—from the Saxon <foreign xml:lang="ANG">al,</foreign> noble, and the
                     Arabic <foreign xml:lang="ARA">Geber,</foreign> the philosopher? Never once
                     heard, perhaps, of the great Cronin that does all the problems and answers, for
                     the Lady's Diary, in mathematics—from the Greek<foreign xml:lang="GRC"
                        >mathema,</foreign> instruction? Nothing like getting at the roots of
                     words—the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">unde derivatur?</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>Even at the hazard of appearing as an ignoramus in the eyes of Mr. Cronin, I
                     was fain to admit that I had not previously heard of his name and erudition. I
                     ventured to intimate, as a sort of half-apology, that I was a stranger in that
                     part of the country.</p>
                  <p>"Strange enough, I'll be bound," said he, with a shrug of the shoulders. "Know,
                     then, that I am that same Tim Cronin,—'our ingenious correspondent,' as the
                     Mathematical Journal calls me, when it refuses one of my articles, 'from want
                     of space,'—bad luck to 'em, as if they could not push out something else to
                     make room for me. Curious, sir, not to have heard of me, that keeps one of the
                     finest academies, under a hedge, in the Province of Munster! Just sit down on
                     the bank here, and I'll soon enlighten you so, about that good-looking lake
                     before your two eyes, that I'll be bound you won't forget me in a hurry."</p>
                  <p>Complying with the request of this august personage, I had the satisfaction of
                     listening to his legend, thus:</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7173-00000009"/>
                     <head>LEGEND OF THE LAKE.</head>
                     <p>ONCE upon a time, and there was no lake here, at all at all. In the middle
                        of the place where that lake is, there stood a large castle, and in it dwelt
                        an unbaptized giant—it was before blessed Saint Patrick came into the
                        country, Heaven rest his soul—and this giant had martial rule over all the
                        country, far and near.</p>
                     <p>In his time, the Aw-martin, nor any other river, did not flow near us.
                        Indeed, though there was plenty of wine in the Castle, there was a great
                        want of water. This was very inconvenient for the ladies—the fellow had as
                        many wives as a Turk—because they were always wanting to wash their clothes,
                        and their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their well-shaped bodies;
                        and, more than that, they could not make themselves a raking cup of tea, by
                        any means, for the want of good soft water. So, one and all, they sent a
                        petition to the giant, praying that he would have the kindness to procure
                        them a well of water. When he read it, he made no more ado but whipped off
                        through the air—just like a bird of Paradise—to his old aunt, who was a
                        fairy, and had foretold that, some day or other, water would be the death of
                        him. Perhaps that was the reason that he always took his liquor neat.</p>
                     <p>Well, he told her what he had come about, and after a world of entreaty—for
                        she had a foreboding that something unfortunate would come of it—the old
                        fairy put a little bottle into his hands. "Take this," said she, "and drill
                        a hole in the rock at the foot of the Castle barbican, where the sun throws
                        his latest ray before he sinks into the west. Make a stone-cover for the top
                        of it—one that will fit it exactly. Then pour the water from this bottle
                        into that hole in the rock, and there will be a well of pure water, for the
                        use of yourself and your family. But, when no one is actually taking water
                        out of this well, be sure that the close-fitting stone-cover is always left
                        upon it, for it is the nature of the liquid to overflow, unless it be kept
                        confined."</p>
                     <p>He gave her a thousand thanks, and home he went. The first thing he did was
                        to drill a hole in the rock (and he did not find <emph>that</emph> a very
                        easy job), then to fit it with an air-tight stone-cover, and, lastly, to
                        pour in the water out of the little bottle.</p>
                     <p>Sure enough, there immediately bubbled up an abundance of bright, clear, and
                        sparkling water. The giant then assembled all his family, and told them how
                        the stone-cover must always be kept over the well when they were not using
                        it. And then his wives agreed that, as they had been so anxious to get this
                        water, one of them, turn about should sit<pb n="18-19"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000010"/> by the well, day and night, and see that no
                        one left it uncovered. They were content to submit to this trouble, rather
                        than run the risk of losing the water.</p>
                     <p>Things went on very well for some time. At last, as <emph>must</emph> be the
                        case when a woman is to the fore, there came a tremendous blow-up. One of
                        the giant's ladies was a foreigner, and had been married, in her own
                        country, before she fell into his hands. Mild and pale she always was,
                        pretty creature! lamenting the land she had left and the lover she had lost.
                        It happened, one day as she sat by the well, that an old pilgrim came to the
                        gate, asked for a draught of water, in God's name, and held out his pitcher
                        for it. Her thoughts were far away, never fear, but she had a tender heart,
                        and she raised the cover from the well to fill his vessel. While she was
                        doing this, the pilgrim pulled off his gown and his false beard, and who
                        should he be but her own husband! She sprang off her seat towards him, and
                        then, faint with joy and pale as death, she sank back into the oaken chair
                        on which she had been sitting, as the guardian of the well. A bird never
                        flew through the air faster than <emph>he</emph> flew towards
                           <emph>her.</emph> He seated himself beside her in the chair, held her
                        lovingly in his arms, kissed her cheeks and lips twenty times over, called
                        her all manner of fond names, and sprinkled her with water until the fresh
                        color came again into her face, and the warm life into her heart.</p>
                     <p>All this time the well was left uncovered, and the waters rose—rose—rose,
                        until they surrounded the Castle. Higher and higher did they rise, until, at
                        last, down fell the gates, and then the stream rushed in, drowning every
                        living soul within the place, and settling down into the very lake that we
                        sit by now.</p>
                     <p>The moral of the story is, that the lady and the pilgrim escaped—for the
                        oaken chair supported them and floated them until they safely put their feet
                        on dry land. All the rest perished, because they had willingly consented to
                        live in sin with the giant; but this one lady had been kept there entirely
                        against her will. The two thanked God for their escape, and returned to
                        their own country, where they lived long and happily. It had been the
                        giant's pride to put all his best jewels on whoever kept watch over the
                        well, in order that all who passed might notice them and pay respect to his
                        wealth. As this lady had them all upon her when the Castle was swallowed up,
                        she and her husband had money enough, out of the sale of them, to keep them
                        in a very genteel way of life at home. Some people say that, at times, the
                        walls of the drowned Castle can be seen through the waters of the lake,—but
                        I won't swear to the fact, as I never noticed it myself.</p>
                     <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                     <p>Such was Tim Cronin's account of the formation of the lake—a version more
                        pleasant than probable. I ventured to inquire how the meadow next the<pb

                        all the others bore such luxuriant grass and grain? Mr. Cronin asked me,
                        whether I saw a gray rock on the left, with three pines on its summit. I
                        noticed them, as required. "Then," said he, "look well at the place all
                        around, and I shall tell you another story or two about Blarney."</p>
                     <p>Thus admonished, I took a closer survey of the place. The rock rose with a
                        gentle swell in the distance, but its front was so precipitous as to be
                        nearly perpendicular; and it was thickly covered with ivy, tangled like
                        network, with which were mingled wild honeysuckle, dog-rose, and other
                        parasites. There was a sort of rugged entrance at its base, over which the
                        wild-brier and honeysuckle had formed a natural arch. Except this, the rock
                        had a commonplace aspect.</p>

                     <head>THE LEGEND OF CORRIG-NA-CAT.</head>
                     <p>WE call that rock by a strange name—from a strange circumstance, said
                        Cronin. Upon the top, some hundreds of years ago, there stood a castle,
                        belonging to the old Kings of Muskerry. Some cousin of theirs lived in it
                        with his family, and was as happy as the day is long. How it happened, never
                        could be ascertained; but happen it certainly did, that, one night, castle
                        and people and all suddenly disappeared. I misdoubt that there were bad
                        spirits at work. However, the general belief is, that the rock opened and
                        swallowed all up, and that the lord and lady are kept there, spell-bound, as
                        it were, in the shape of cats. From this, the rock is called Corrig-na-cat,
                        or the Cat Rock. 'Tis a mighty pretty derivation.</p>
                     <p>Whether the castle were swallowed up in that manner, or not, strange sights
                        have been seen, by the light of the full moon, about that place. There is a
                        little green spot on the brow of the hill, where there is a fairy-circle; on
                        that spot sweet music has been heard by night, and the good people (as well
                        as the fairies) have been seen dancing on the green turf, dressed in green
                        and gold, with beautiful<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7173-00000012"/> crowns
                        upon their heads, and white wands in their little hands. Ah, sir, you may
                        smile, but that's the belief in this part of the country, and he'd be looked
                        upon as no better than a heathen who'd venture to say a word against it.</p>
                     <p>My grandfather, although a trifle given to drink, was as honest a man as
                        ever broke bread. One summer night, while he lay in bed, between asleep and
                        awake, he heard a strange deep voice speak to him. It said, "The words of
                        fate! heed them. Go, at midnight, to Corrig-na-cat; take with you a box of
                        candles and a hundred fathoms of line; fasten one end of the line to the
                        tree that grows just outside the mouth of the cave, and, tying the other end
                        round your waist, boldly advance with a pair of lighted candles in your
                        hands: the use of the line is, that you may roll it up as you come back, and
                        not lose your way. Keep to the right-hand side, and go on until you come to
                        a large room with two cats in it. In the room beyond that, there is as much
                        gold as would buy a kingdom. You may take with you a bag to carry away as
                        much of it as you please; but, on your peril, do not touch anything else;
                        your life will not be worth a brass sixpence, if you do."</p>
                     <p>You may be sure, sir, that this piece of information astonished my
                        grandfather. But he was a sensible man, and, doubting whether two heads
                        would be better than one in such a serious matter, nudged my grandmother
                        with his elbow, to know if she was awake. She slept—sound as a top; so he
                        let her sleep on. He was rather too knowing to let <emph>her</emph> into the
                        secret. He thought over all that he had ever heard of Corrig-na-cat; he
                        called to mind how his mother had always said that our family were the real
                        descendants of the lord and lady of the castle. He began to fancy that this
                        was some great oracle that had come to visit him, in order that
                           <emph>he</emph> might break the spell that kept the castle and its
                        inhabitants closed up in the rock. Indeed, he was very much perplexed, but
                        determined to wait a bit, and carefully keep his own counsel.</p>
                     <p>A warning from the world of spirits is worth nothing, if it is not repeated.
                        The next night, my grandfather again was cautioned to listen to the words of
                        fate. The third night the visitation was repeated. He knew, then, that the
                        thing was no feint; and on the fourth night, he stole out of the house to go
                        on the adventure.</p>
                     <p>It was as pitch dark as if light had never been invented. He took the
                        hundred fathoms of line, the box of candles, a sack to bring home a supply
                        of gold, and a good-sized flask of strong whiskey. When he reached the rock,
                        his heart began to fail him. The night was so still that he could hear the
                        beating of his heart—thump, thump, thump, against his breast. He could hear
                        the bats flying about, and he could see the owls looking on him with their
                        great, round, brown eyes. Swallowing most of the<pb n="24-25"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000013"/> contents of the flask at one pull, he found
                        his spirits wonderfully restored, and he pushed forward to the mouth of the
                        cave. He fastened one end of the line to the tree; he said an <foreign
                           xml:lang="LAT">Ave</foreign> or two—for we are all of us a pious
                        family—he drained the flask, and then he dashed forward.</p>
                     <p>The way was as straight as an arrow for about thirty yards, but, after that,
                        it took as many turnings and twistings as a problem of Euclid in the sixth
                        book, and branched out into many directions. My grandfather followed on the
                        right-hand side, as he had been told, and soon found himself at the gateway
                        of an old hall. He pushed open the door, and saw that there were doors upon
                        doors, leading off to many a place. He still kept to the right, and in a few
                        minutes found himself in a state-chamber. Pillars of white marble supported
                        the roof, and, at the farthest end, the hall opened into an apartment,
                        through which there beamed a soft and beautiful light, as if it came from a
                        thousand shaded lamps.</p>
                     <p>Here was the end of his journey. A carved mantel-piece of white marble was
                        over the fireplace, and there lay two beautiful white cats, on
                        crimson-velvet cushions, before the fire. Diamonds and rubies, emeralds and
                        amethysts, pearls and topazes, were piled on the ground in heaps, and
                        ceiling and walls were covered all over with them, so that rays of light
                        gleamed down upon him, wherever he looked.</p>
                     <p>There was no living thing in the room with my grandfather but the cats. The
                        creatures had golden collars, embossed with diamonds, round their necks; and
                        to these were fastened long gold chains, which just gave them liberty to
                        move round the room, being fastened to the walls, one at each side, by
                        golden staples. He noticed that the animals steadily kept their eyes upon
                        him, and appeared to watch every motion of his.</p>
                     <p>My grandfather passed on into the inner room. The gold lay on the floor like
                        wheat in a miller's store. He filled his sack with the coin to the brim,
                        until, though he was said to be the strongest man in the whole barony, he
                        had some difficulty in lifting it. As he passed through the room in which
                        the cats were, he paused for a moment, to have a parting glance at all the
                        treasures he was leaving. There was one golden star, studded with diamonds
                        as big as walnuts, and blazing like a lamp, hanging down before him from the
                        ceiling. It was too tempting. He forgot the advice not to touch anything but
                        the gold in the inner room, and reached out his hand to seize the sparkling
                        prize. One of the cats, who had eagerly watched his motions, sprang forward
                        as he touched the jewel, and quick as a lightning-stroke, hit out his right
                        eye with a sharp dash of his paw. At the same moment, an invisible hand
                        whipped off the sack of gold from his shoulders, as if it were only a bag of
                        feathers. Out went all the<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7173-00000014"/> lights.
                        My grandfather groped his way out as well as he could, by the help of the
                        guiding-line fastened to his wrist, and cursed his greediness, that would
                        not be content with enough. He got home by day-break, with only one eye in
                        his head, and that, without meaning to joke on his misfortune, was the
                           <emph>left</emph> one.</p>
                     <p>Next day he sent for the priest, and told him what had happened. My
                        grandmother said that all the misfortune was owing to <emph>her</emph> not
                        being in the secret. The priest said nothing. Before long, all the country
                        heard of the story, and half the country believed it. To be sure, as my
                        grandfather was rather addicted to liquor (and there was a private still, in
                        those days, in almost every corner), it was a chance that he might have
                        dreamt all this:—but then, there was his right eye absent. There were some
                        malicious people, indeed, who hinted that he fell over the cliff, in a
                        drunken fit, and that his eye was scratched out in that manner. But it would
                        ill beseem me to make a story-teller of my dead-and-gone grandfather, and so
                        I maintain the truth of his own statement. If it is not true, it deserves to
                        be.</p>
                     <p>In this conclusion I fully agreed, and the Philomath, proud of the display
                        of his legendary lore, and happy on having fallen in with a patient and
                        willing auditor, next proceeded to acquaint me with the accredited legend of
                        the meadow next the lake. As before, I shall endeavor, in repeating it to
                        adhere to the very words of my informant.</p>

                     <head>LEGEND OF THE ROCK CLOSE.</head>
                     <p>ABOUT a thousand years ago, or so—but, of course, <emph>after</emph> this
                        lake was formed, to fulfil the old fairy's prophecy, that the giant would
                        come to his death by water—there was a man who owned all the fields in the
                        Rock Close. He was a farmer—a plain, honest man. Not long after he had
                        purchased the place, he noticed that, though this very field we are now
                        sitting in had the same cultivation as the others, it never gave him any
                        return. He had no idea of having a meadow look like a lawn in front of a
                        gentleman's country-house, and lost no time in speaking about it to his
                        herdsman, a knowledgeable man, who said it might be worth while to watch the
                        place, for, although he often saw the blades of grass a foot high at night,
                        all was as closely shaved as a bowling-green in the morning. His master, who
                        was one of the old stock of the Mac Carthies, thought there was reason in
                        what he said, and desired him to be on the watch, and try to find out the
                        real facts of the matter.</p>
                     <p>The herdsman did his bidding. The next morning he told Mac Carthy that he
                        had hid himself behind an old gateway (you may see the ruins of it<pb
                           n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7173-00000015"/> there to the left),—that, about
                        midnight, he had seen the waters of the lake very much disturbed,—that six
                        cows came up out of the lake, and set to, eating all the grass off the
                        field, until, by daybreak, they had made it as smooth as the palm of my
                        hand,—and that, when the day dawned, the cows walked back into the lake, and
                        went down to the bottom, as much at their ease as if they were on dry
                        land.</p>
                     <p>This was strange news for Mac Carthy, and set him quite at his wits' ends.
                        The herdsman was a little man, with the heart of a lion, and he offered to
                        watch again on that evening, to seize one of the cows, and either put it
                        into the pound, or go down into the lake with it, and make a regular
                        complaint of the trespass. Aye, and he did it, too. At dusk he went again,
                        hid himself, as before, and waited to see what would happen.</p>
                     <p>The six cows came up out of the lake, as before, and nibbled off the grass,
                        until the field was quite smooth. They could not get into any other field,
                        because they were surrounded by high, quickset hedges, and I have noticed
                        that cows are not very fond of taking flying-leaps.</p>
                     <p>Just at dawn, as the last cow was passing by him, on her return to the lake,
                        the herdsman made a dart at her tail, and took a fast hold of it. The cow
                        walked on, as if nothing had happened, turned her head, winked one of her
                        large eyes at him in a knowing manner, and the herdsman followed, still
                        holding the tail.</p>
                     <p>Down dashed the beast into the waters—but the herdsman still kept his grasp.
                        Down they went—deep, deep, to the very bottom of the lake. Sure enough,
                        there was the giant's castle, that had been drowned centuries before. A
                        little boy was in the court-yard, playing with a golden ball. All round the
                        yard were piles of armor—spears and helmets, swords and shields,—all
                        ornamented with gold. Into the court-yard dashed the cows, and with them
                        went the bold herdsman.</p>
                     <p>Out came a lady, richly dressed up in velvets and jewels, and her eyes as
                        bright as the sunbeams that dance on the wall on the morning of Easter
                           Sunday.<ref rend="super" target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002">*</ref>
                        She carried a golden milk-pail in her hand. Loud and shrill was her cry when
                        she saw the herdsman.</p>
                     <note place="foot" xml:id="note_002">
                        <p><ref target="#return_002">*</ref>There is a popular belief in Ireland

                     <p>I should have told you that, as they were going down, the cow whispered to
                        him, "I want to speak a word with you, in confidence."—"Honor bright," said
                        the herdsman.—"I think," said the cow, "that I'd like to graze on that
                        meadow of your master's, by day as well as by night, for the grass is mighty
                        sweet, and I don't think it agrees with my digestion to be driven up and
                        down the lake as I am. If I<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7173-00000016"/> stand
                        your friend now, will you go bail that the master will never put me into any
                        other field but that?"—The herdsman answered, "I'll promise you, by the holy
                        poker, and that is as good as if I was to swear by the blessed mud."—"Then
                        my mind is at ease," says the cow. "For the life of you, don't let go my
                        tail, whatever you may hear and see."</p>
                     <p>When the young lady shrieked with surprise at seeing a herdsman in that
                        place, out rushed a whole regiment of soldiers, with their cheeks as red as
                        the kitchen-fire five minutes before the dinner is done, and the looks of
                        them as fierce as if they were in the heat of battle—a little fiercer,
                        may-be.—"Oh, that villain!" says the lady, pointing to the herdsman.—"Come
                        here, and be killed," shouted the dragoons. But the herdsman knew better.
                        "Send your master to me," says he, as bold as brass. "I always like to do
                        business with principals."</p>
                     <p>They wondered, as well they might, at the fellow's impudence, but they
                        thought it best to call out their master. He came, with a golden crown upon
                        his head, and a purple velvet cloak on his shoulders, and a beautiful pair
                        of Hessian boots on his feet.—"I demand justice," said the herdsman, "for
                        the trespass that your cows have been committing on Mac Carthy's field; and
                        I seize this cow until the damage be ascertained and made good.'</p>
                     <p>He was firm as a rock, and neither coaxing nor threatening could make him
                        yield as much as a pin's point. He stood upon his right, and they could not
                        get him off it. The cow had been seized in the very act of trespass, and all
                        they dared do was to tempt the herdsman to surrender her. He knew better. At
                        last the master of them said, "We must compromise this little matter. Leave
                        the cow here, make out your bill for damage, and if I don't pay it to you
                        either in sterling money, or notes of Delacour's bank at Mallow, or Joe
                        Pike's in Cork, you can have your remedy at law, and summon me, on a
                        process, before the Assistant Barrister and the bench of Magistrates at the
                        next Quarter Sessions."—But the herdsman knew better than that, and said
                        he'd prefer leaving matters as they were. "A cow in the hand"—says he. Then
                        the master of them said, "Take that golden ball that the child has, and
                        leave us the cow."—"Hand it over to me," says the herdsman.—"Come for it,"
                        said they, in the hope that he'd leave the cow.—"I've a touch of the
                        rheumatism in my knee," says he, "and 'tis ill-convenient to move the
                        limb."—With that, they handed him the ball, and, as soon as he saw that it
                        really was gold, he put it into his breeches pocket, and said it was not
                        half enough.</p>
                     <p>Then they began to whisper among themselves, and he could hear them
                        proposing to get out a bloodhound—one of the breed that the Spaniards had to
                        hunt down the Indians in America—and he thought it full time to make himself
                        scarce. So, hey<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7173-00000017"/> whispered to the
                        cow:—"My little cow," said he, "I'd like to go home." The cow took the hint,
                        like a sensible animal as she was, and stole backward through half the lake
                        before they missed her. "If we get safely back on dry land," says she,
                        "neither you nor any one else must swear in my presence, for the spell is
                        upon me, and then I shall be obliged to return to the lake."</p>
                     <p>Just then the hound was slipped, and he cut through the water like a
                        dolphin. But the cow had the start of him, by a good bit. Just as she set
                        her foot on land, the dog caught hold of the herdsman, and his bite tore
                        away part of the skirt of his coat. Indeed, it was noticed for some days
                        that the herdsman declined sitting down, just as if he had been newly made a
                        Freemason, so I won't say that the dog did not bite more than the
                        garment.</p>
                     <p>Mac Carthy had been cooling his heels on the bank of the lake all the while
                        that the herdsman was away, and glad enough he was to see him come back, in
                        company with the little cow. The herdsman told him all that happened, and
                        handed him the golden ball, which, people say, is in the Jeffreys' family to
                        this day. The hound runs round the lake, from midnight to sunrise, on every
                        first of July, and is to run, on that day, until his silver shoes are worn
                        out,—whenever that happens, Ireland is to be a great nation, but not until
                        then.</p>
                     <p>The field was not visited any more by the cattle from the lake, for their
                        master, below there, thought that though gratis grazing was pleasant enough,
                        it was not quite so pleasant to have the cows impounded for trespass. From
                        that time, never another field in all Munster gave such produce; sow it, or
                        sow it not, there was always a barn-full of grain out of it. About half an
                        acre of it was kept under grass, and on that the cow from the lake had
                        constant feeding.</p>
                     <p>In due season, the cow had young ones—the same breed that we now call Kerry
                        cows—those cattle, small in size, but good in substance, that feed upon very
                        little, yield a great deal of milk, and always fetch the best of prices.</p>
                     <p>Mac Carthy was in a fair way of making a little fortune out of that cow of
                        his, she gave such a power of milk, but that, one day as a nag of his was
                        leaping over a hedge into the pasturage where the cow was, Mac Carthy burst
                        out with a rattling oath. The moment the words left his lips, the cow cocked
                        her ears, winked her eye knowingly at him, gave her tail a toss in the air,
                        and made one spring down into the lake. The waters closed over her, and that
                        was the last that mortal eye ever saw of her.</p>
                     <p>From that time forth the field was again visited by the cattle from the
                        lake, and that's the reason why it is as smooth as you see it now. It is
                        supposed that so it will continue until somebody has the bold heart to go
                        down again and make another seizure for trespass.</p>
                     <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7173-00000018"/>
                     <p>Mr. Jeffreys, hearing a great deal of the treasures which are said to be at
                        the bottom of the lake, laid out a power of money in trying to drain it. But
                        it filled faster than the men could empty it. They might as well think of
                        emptying the Atlantic with a slop-basin.</p>
                     <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                     <p>Having thanked Mr. Tim Cronin, Philomath, for his legends, I took the
                        liberty of asking if he believed them? "Well," said he, "that same question
                        is a poser. If I am pressed on the point, I must admit that I do not believe
                        them <emph>entirely;</emph> but, when I meet curious gentlemen, I am proud
                        to tell them these stories—particularly when they invite me to spend the
                        afternoon with them at the little inn at the foot of the hill beyond
                        there."</p>
                     <p>The hint was taken—as far as enabling him, as he said, to partake of his own
                        hospitality, for my own time was limited, as I had to return to dine in
                        Cork. Thus, I was unable to judge whether Mr. Cronin was as conversable
                        after feeding-time as before it. He died some two years ago, I have been
                        told, and it will be difficult to meet with a Cicerone so well qualified to
                        describe and illustrate Blarney Castle and its dependencies.</p>

                  <head>CON O'KEEFE AND THE GOLDEN CUP.</head>
                  <p>IN Ireland, as in Scotland, among the lower orders, there is a prevalent belief
                     in the existence and supernatural powers of the gentry commonly called
                     "fairies." Many and strange are the stories told of this mysterious and much
                     dreaded race of beings. Loud and frequent have been the exclamations of
                     surprise, and even of anger, at the hard incredulity which made me refuse, when
                     I was young, to credit <emph>all</emph> that was narrated of the wonderful
                     feats of Irish fairies—the most frolicksome of the entire genus. The more my
                     disbelief was manifested, the more wonderful were the legends which were
                     launched at me, to overthrow my unlucky and matter-of-fact obstinacy.</p>
                  <p>I have forgotten many of the traditions which were thus made familiar to me in
                     my boyhood, but my memory retains sufficient to convince me to what
                     improbabilities Superstition clung—and the more wonderful the story, the more
                     implicit the belief. But in such cases the fanaticism was harmless,—it was of
                     the head rather than of the heart—of the imagination rather than the reason. It
                     would be fortunate if all superstitions did as little mischief as
                        <emph>this.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7173-00000019"/>
                  <p>It is deeply to be lamented that the matter-of-factedness of the Americans is
                     not subdued or modified by any—even the slightest—belief in the old-world
                     superstitions of which I speak. Of fairy-lore they cannot, and they do not,
                     possess the slightest item. They read of it, as if it were legendary, but
                     nothing more. They feel it not—they know it—they are, therefore, dreadfully
                     actual. So much the worse for them!</p>
                  <p>Having imbibed a sovereign contempt for the wild and wonderful traditions which
                     had been duly accredited in the neighborhood, time out of mind, I never was
                     particularly chary in expressing such contempt at every opportunity. When the
                     mind of a boy soars above the ignorance which besets his elders in an inferior
                     station, who have had neither the chance nor the desire of being enlightened,
                     he is apt to pride himself, as I did, on the "march of intellect" which has
                     placed him superior to their vulgar credulity.</p>
                  <p>Many years have passed since I happened to be a temporary visitor beneath the
                     hospitable roof of one of the better sort of farmers, in the county of Cork,
                     during the Midsummer holidays. As usual, I there indulged in sarcasm against
                     the credulity of the country. One evening, in particular, I was not a little
                     tenacious in laughing at the very existence of "the fairy folk;" and, as
                     sometimes happens, ridicule accomplished more than argument could have
                     effected. My hosts could bear anything in the way of argument—at least of
                     argument such as mine—they could even suffer their favorite legends and
                     theories about the fairies to be abused; but to <emph>laugh</emph> at them—that
                     was an act of unkindness which quite passed their comprehension, and grievously
                     taxed their patience.</p>
                  <p>My host was quite in despair, and almost in anger at my boyish jokes upon his
                     fairy-legends, when the village schoolmaster came in, an uninvited but most
                     welcome guest. A chair was soon provided for him in the warmest corner—whiskey
                     was immediately on the table, and the schoolmaster, who was a pretty constant
                     votary to Bacchus, lost no time in making himself acquainted with its
                     flavor.</p>
                  <p>I had often seen him before. He combined in his character a mixture of
                     shrewdness and simplicity; was a most excellent mathematician and a good
                     classical scholar—but of the world he knew next to nothing. From youth to age
                     had been spent within the limits of the parish over which, cane in hand, he had
                     presided for more than a quarter of a century,—at once a teacher and an oracle!
                     He was deeply imbued with a belief in the superstitions of the district, but
                     was more especially familiar with the wild legends of that rocky glen (the
                     defile near Kilworth, commonly called Araglin, once famous for the extent of
                     illicit distillation carried on there), in which he had passed away his life,
                     usefully, but humbly employed.</p>
                  <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7173-00000020"/>
                  <p>To this eccentric character my host triumphantly appealed for proof respecting
                     the existence and vagaries of the fairies. He wasted no time in argument, but,
                     glancing triumphantly around, declared that he would convert me by a
                     particularly well-attested story. Draining his tumbler, and incontinently
                     mixing another, Mr. Patrick McCann plunged at once into the heart of his
                     narration, as follows:</p>
                  <p>"You know the high hill that overlooks the town of Fermoy? Handsome and
                     thriving place as it now is, I remember the time when there were only two
                     houses in that same town, and <emph>one</emph> of them was then only in course
                     of building! Well, there lived on the other side of Corran Thierna (the
                     mountain in question, though <hi rend="i"/>Corrig is the true name) one of the
                     Barrys, a gentleman who was both rich and good. I wish we had more of the stamp
                     among us now—'tis little of the Whiteboys or Ribbonmen would trouble the
                     country then. He had a fine fortune, kept up a fine house, and lived at a
                     dashing rate. It does not matter, here nor there, how many servants he had; but
                     I mention them, because one of them was a very remarkable fellow. His equal was
                     not to be had, far or near, for love nor money.</p>
                  <p>"This servant was called Con O'Keefe. He was a crabbed little man, with a face
                     the very color and texture of old parchment, and he had lived in the family
                     time out of mind. He was such a small, dwarfish, deeny creature, that no one
                     ever thought of putting him to hard work. All that they did was, now and again,
                     from the want of a better messenger at the moment, or to humor the old man, to
                     send him to Rathcormac post-office for letters. But he was too weak and feeble
                     to walk so far—though it was only a matter of three or four miles; so they got
                     him a little ass, and he rode upon it, quite as proud as a general at the head
                     of an army of conquerors. 'T was as good as a play to see Con mounted upon his
                     donkey—you could scarcely make out which had the most stupid look. But neither
                     man nor beast can help his looks.</p>
                  <p>"At that time Rathcormac, though 'tis but a village now, was a borough, and
                     sent two members to the Irish Parliament. Was not the great Curran, the orator
                     and patriot, member for Rathcormac, when he was a young man? Did not Colonel
                     Tonson get made an Irish peer, out of this very borough, which his son William
                     is, to this very day, by the title of Baron Riversdale of Rathcormac? Does not
                     his shield bear an open hand between two castles, and is not the motto, 'Manus
                     hæc inimica tyrannis'—which means that it was the enemy of tyrants? Did not the
                     Ulster King of Arms make the Tonsons a grant of these arms, in the time of
                     Cromwell? But here I have left poor little Con mounted on his donkey all this
                     time.</p>
                  <p>"Con O'Keefe was not worth his keep, for any good he did; but, truth to say, he
                     had the name of being<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7173-00000021"/> hand and glove
                     with the fairies; and, at that time, Corran Thierna swarmed with them. They
                     changed their quarters when the regiments from Fermoy barracks took to firing
                     against targets stuck up at the foot of the mountain. Not that a ball could
                     ever hit a fairy (except a silver one cast by a girl in her teens, who has
                     never wished for a lover, or a widow under forty who has not sighed for a
                     second husband—so there's little chance that it ever will be cast), but they
                     hate the noise of the firing and the smell of gunpowder, quite as much as the
                     Devil hates holy water.</p>
                  <p>"Tis reckoned lucky in these parts to have a friend of the fairies in the house
                     with you, and that was partly the reason why Con O'Keefe was kept at
                     Barry's-fort. Many and many a one could swear to hearing him and 'the good
                     folk' talk together at twilight on his return from Rathcormac with the
                     letter-bag. My own notion is, that if he <emph>had</emph> anything to say to
                     them, he had more sense than to hold conversation with them on the high road,
                     for that might have led to a general discovery. Con was fond of a drop, and,
                     when he took it (which was in an algebraic way, that is, 'any
                        <emph>given</emph> quantity'), he had such famous spirits, and his tongue
                     went so glibly, that, in the absence of other company, he was sometimes forced
                     to talk to himself, as he trotted home.</p>
                  <p>"One night, as he was going along, rather the worse for liquor, he thought he
                     heard a confused sound of voices in the air, directly over his head. He
                     stopped, and, sure enough; it was the fairies, who were chattering away, like a
                     bevy of magpies; but he did not know this at the time.</p>
                  <p>"At first he thought it might be some of the neighbors wanting to play him a
                     trick. So, to show that he was not afraid (for the drink had made him bold as a
                     lion), when the voices above and around him kept calling out 'High up! high
                     up!' he put in his spoke, and shouted, as loud as any of them, 'High up! high
                     up with ye, my lads!' No sooner said than done. He was whisked off his donkey
                     in a twinkling, and was 'high up' in the air, in the very middle of a crowd of
                     'good people'—for it happened to be one of their festival nights, and the cry
                     that poor little Con heard was the summons for gathering them all together.
                     There they were, mighty small, moving about as quickly as motes in the
                     sunshine. Although Con had the reputation at Barry's-fort of being well
                     acquainted with them all, you may well believe that there was not a single face
                     among the lot that he knew.</p>
                  <p>"In less than no time, off they went, when their leader—a little morsel of a
                     fellow, not bigger than Hop-o'-my Thumb—bawled out, 'High for France! high for
                     France! high over!' Off they went, through the air—quick as if they were on a
                     steeple-chase. Moss and moor—mountain and valley—<pb n="42-43"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000022"/> green field and brown bog—land and water were
                     all left behind, and they never once halted until they reached the coast of
                     France.</p>
                  <p>"They immediately made for the house (there it is called the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">château</foreign>) of a great lord—one of the Seigneurs of
                     the Court—and bolted through the key-hole into his wine-cellar, without leave
                     or license. How little Con was squeezed through, I never could understand, but
                     it is as sure as fate that he went into the cellar along with them. They soon
                     got astride the casks, and commenced drinking the best wines, without waiting
                     to be invited. Con, you may be sure, was not behind any of them, as far as the
                     drinking went. The more he drank, the better relish he had for their tipple.
                     The 'good people,' somehow or other, did not appear at all surprised at Con's
                     being among them, but they <emph>did</emph> wonder at his great thirst, and
                     pressed him to take enough—and Con was not the man who'd wait to be asked
                     twice. So they drank on till night slipped away, when the sun—like a proper
                     gentleman as he is—sent in one of his earliest beams, as a sort of gentle hint
                     that it was full time for them to return. They had a parting-glass, and, in
                     half an hour or so, had crossed the wide sea, and dropped little Con ('pretty
                     well, I thank you,' by this time) on the precise spot he had left on the
                     evening before. He had been drinking-out of a beautiful golden cup in the
                     cellar, and, by some mistake or other, it had slipped up the sleeve of the
                     large loose coat he wore, and so he brought it home with him. Not that Con was
                     not honest enough, but surely a man may be excused for taking 'a cup too much'
                     in a winecellar.</p>
                  <p>"Con was soon awakened by the warm sunbeams playing upon his face. At first, he
                     thought he had been dreaming, and he might have thought so to his dying day,
                     but that, when he got on his feet, the golden cup rolled on the road before
                     him, and was proof positive that all was a reality.</p>
                  <p>"He said his prayers directly, between him and harm. Then he put up the cup and
                     walked home, where, as his little donkey had returned on the previous night
                     without him, the family had given him up as lost or drowned. Indeed, some of
                     them had sagaciously suggested the probability of his having gone off for good
                     with the fairies.</p>
                  <p>"Now, does not my story convince you that there <emph>must</emph> be such
                     things as fairies? It is not more than twenty years since I heard Con O'Keefe
                     tell the whole story from beginning to end; and he'd say or swear with any man
                     that the whole of it was as true as gospel. And, as sure as my name is Patrick
                     McCann, I <emph>do</emph> believe that Con was in strange company that
                     night."</p>
                  <p>I ventured to say to Mr. McCann that, being yet incredulous, I must have better
                     evidence than little Con's own declaration.</p>
                  <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7173-00000023"/>
                  <p>"To be sure you shall," said he. "Was not the golden cup taken up to
                     Barry's-fort, and to be seen—as seen it was—by the whole country?"</p>
                  <p>I answered that, "Certainly, if the cup is to be seen there, the case is
                     materially altered."</p>
                  <p>"I did not say that the cup <emph>is</emph> at Barry's-fort," said McCann,
                     "only that it <emph>was.</emph> The end of the story, indeed, is nearly as
                     strange as the beginning.—When Con O'Keefe came back from his wonderful
                     excursion, no one believed a word of what he said; for though it was whispered
                     that he was great with the fairies, yet, when the matter came tangibly before
                     them, they did not credit it. But Con soon settled their doubts; he brought
                     forward the cup, and there was no gainsaying <emph>that</emph> evidence.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Barry took the cup into his own keeping, and, the name and residence of
                     the French lord being engraved upon it, determined (as in honor bound) to send
                     it home again. So he went off to Cove, without any delay, taking Con with him;
                     and, as there luckily was a vessel going off to France that very day, he sent
                     off little Con with the cup and his very best compliments.</p>
                  <p>Now, the cup was a great favorite with the French lord (being a piece of family
                     plate, given to one of his ancestors by one of the old kings of France, whose
                     life he had saved in battle), and nothing could equal the hubbub and confusion
                     that arose when it was missing. His lordship called for some wine at dinner,
                     and great was his anger when the lackey handed it to him in a glass, declaring
                     that they could not find the golden goblet. He threw glass, and wine, and all,
                     at the servant's head—flew into a terrible passion—and swore, by all that was
                     good and bad, that he would not take anything stronger than water until the cup
                     was on the table again; and that, if it was not forthcoming in a week, he'd
                     turn off every servant he had, without paying them their wages, or giving them
                     a charácter.</p>
                  <p>"The cup was well searched for, but all to no purpose, as you may suppose. At
                     last, the week came to an end—all the servants had their clothes packed up, to
                     be off in the morning. His lordship was getting dreadfully tired of drinking
                     cold water, and the whole house was, as one may say, turned topsy-turvy, when,
                     to the delight and admiration of all, in came Con O'Keefe, from Ireland, with a
                     letter from Mr. Barry and the cup in his fist.</p>
                  <p>"I rather think they welcomed him. His lordship made it a point to get
                     'glorious' that night, and, as in duty bound, the entire household followed his
                     example, with all the pleasure in life. You may be certain that Con played away
                     finely at the wine—you know the fairies had made him free of the cellar—so he
                     knew the taste of the liquor, and relished it too. There can be no doubt that
                     there was a regular jollification in the château that night.</p>
                  <p>"Con remained in France for a month, and was<pb n="46-47"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000024"/> perfectly in clover, for, from the lord to the
                     lackey, every one liked him. When he returned, he had a heavy purse of gold for
                     himself, and many fine presents for his master. Indeed, while the French lord
                     lived, which was for fifteen good years longer, a couple of hogsheads of
                     excellent claret were annually received at Barry's-fort, as a present from him,
                     and there was no wine in the country to equal it. As for Con O'Keefe, he never
                     had the luck to meet the fairies again, a misfortune he very sincerely
                     lamented. And that's the whole story."</p>
                  <p>I asked Mr. McCann, whether he really believed <emph>all</emph> of it? That
                     worthy replied in these words:—</p>
                  <p>"Why, in truth, I must say, some parts of it require rather an elastic mind to
                     take in; but there's no doubt that Con <emph>was</emph> sent over to France,
                     where, it is said, there was a great to-do about a golden cup. I am positive
                     that Mr. Barry used to receive a present of claret, every year, from a French
                     lord, for I've drank some of the best claret in Ireland from Mr. Barry's
                     cellar. If the tale <emph>be</emph> true—and I have told it as I have heard Con
                     O'Keefe tell it, especially when overcome by liquor, at which time, the truth
                     is sure to come out—it is proof positive, that there have been fairies in this
                     neighborhood, and that within the memory of man!"</p>
                  <p>Such a logical conclusion was incontrovertible, especially when enforced by a
                     facetious wink from the schoolmaster; so, I even left matters as they were, and
                     listened with all proper attention to other stories in the same vein, and to
                     the same effect. If the narrator did not credit them, most of his auditors did,
                     which amounts to much the same in the end. Some other time, perhaps, I may be
                     tempted to relate them.</p>

                  <head>LEGENDS OF FINN MAC COUL.</head>
                  <p>THERE is a similarity, all over the world, between the popular legends and
                     traditions of different nations. They are reproduced, with slight differences
                     of circumstance and costume, to suit each new locality. For example, the Maiden
                     Tower at Constantinople, actually built by the Emperor Manuel, centuries ago,
                     for the purpose of a double communication—with Scutari, on the Asian side, and
                     with the point of coast occupied by the Serai Bournou on the Asian. Whenever
                     the hostile visit of a Venetian fleet was anticipated, a strong iron chain used
                     to be drawn on both sides, across the entire breadth of the strait. Respecting
                     this are several legends, all of which have their prototypes in the West.</p>
                  <p>The generally received account has appropriated it as the place in which, for
                     safety, a damsel was held in close retirement until the fatal time named in a
                     prediction should have passed away; but a serpent, accidentally brought up in a
                     basket of fruit, caused the maiden's death. Here is a striking illustration of
                     the similarity between the legends of the East and those of the West. In the
                     Third Calendar's Story, in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments (which have
                     charmed all of us in youth, and rarely fail to delight us when we return to
                     them in maturer years), the whole interest turns on an incident of the same
                     character. Both stories appear deeply imbued with that fatality which forms the
                     distinguishing feature in Eastern belief and practice. Near Bristol, also, are
                     the remains of a tower, called Cook's Folly, erected to be the dwelling-place
                     of a youth of whom it had been predicted that (like the heroine of the Turkish
                     legend) his life would be in peril from a serpent until the completion of his
                     eighteenth year. The dangerous time had nearly expired, when the youth died
                     from the venomous bite of an adder, which had been accidentally conveyed to his
                     isolated abode in a bundle of fagots.</p>
                  <p>In the south of Ireland, on the summit of a mountain called Corrig Thierna (the
                     Chieftain's Rock), is a heap of stones which, if there be truth in tradition,
                     was brought there to build a castle in which was to dwell a son of Roche,
                     Prince of Fermoy, of whom it had been predicted that he would be drowned before
                     his twentieth year. The child, when only five years old, fell into a pool of
                     water which had been collected, on the top of the mountain, to make mortar for
                     the erection of the tower, in which it was intended he should be kept "out of
                     harm's way," until the perilous period had elapsed. The child was drowned. In
                     each case, the prophecy<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7173-00000026"/> appears to
                     have brought about its own fulfilment. There is a moral in these old
                     traditions, did we but know how to seize and apply it.</p>
                  <p>Washington Irving has localized several legends as American, but his Rip Van
                     Winkle has been traced to a German origin, and many of his other legends appear
                     to be old friends in a new attire. Who can say whence any traditional stories
                     are derived? Some years ago, a supplement to the Thousand-and-One Nights,
                     containing an Arabian tale called the Sage Heycar, was published at Paris, and
                     the translator noted the curious fact that this Oriental story contained many
                     incidents exactly similar to passages in the life of Æsop: such as sixteen
                     pages of details of a visit made by Heycar to the court of Pharaoh, which are
                     the same, word for word, with the account of the like visit made by Æsop. So,
                     too, the challenge which Pharaoh sent to the King of Abyssinia, demanding him
                     to build a palace in the air, and the ingenious means to which Æsop had
                     recourse, are transferred to Heycar. Even the fables of Æsop, the Phrygian,
                     have been claimed for Lokman, the Arabian philosopher, and now the very
                     incidents of his life are taken from him by Heycar.</p>
                  <p>The Coventry legend of Lady Godiva is claimed by the Arabians. In Von Hammer's
                     new Arabian Nights is the story called Camaralzeman and the Jeweller's Wife,
                     founded on an incident precisely similar to that in which the English heroine
                     appears.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, it is impossible to ascertain what co-incident mythology connects
                     the East and the West. We know not what relation Thor of Scandinavia may have
                     with Vishnu of Hindostan. The oldest English and Irish stories appear to have
                     corresponding legends among the Celts, Danes, Scandinavians, and Normans, and,
                     again, these have wandered either to or from the East. Even such thoroughly
                     English stories as Tom Thumb, Jack the Giant Killer, and Whittington and his
                     Cat, are claimed as aboriginal in foreign countries. The Wise Men of Gotham,
                     one of the oldest English provincial legends, is given, nearly verbatim, in one
                     of the German popular stories, collected by the Brothers Grimm, and its
                     incidents may be found in the Pentamerone (in the story of Bardiello), but has
                     been translated from the Tamul tongue, which is a dialect of Southern India, as
                     the "Adventures of Gooroo Noodle and his Five Disciples."</p>
                  <p>The Germans are very fond of legendary lore. Like the Irish, they have their
                     cellar-haunters, who invariably tap the best wine, and make themselves merry
                     with whatever the cellar and larder can supply. Like the Irish, too, they have
                     traditions of gigantic dwellers in the land, in days gone by, and they
                     re-people the Hartz with men of enormous stature and strength, capable of
                     daring and doing<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7173-00000027"/> any thing, yet who
                     differ from the Genii, in the Arabian Tales, who are spoken of as possessing
                     supernatural powers, while the giants of Western tradition, having nothing
                     remarkable, except their size and strength, and so far from being endowed with
                     more than human powers, may be noticed, on the contrary, as being slow-witted
                     and rather dull of comprehension,—for, like most very tall people of the
                     present day, their upper story is unfurnished. Such were Finn Mac Coul, and his
                     great rival, Ossian, neither of whom can be named as remarkably bright "boys."
                     There are a few instances of this which may be worth recording. For
                     example:—</p>

                     <head>FINN AND THE FISH.</head>
                     <p>IN the good old times, "when Malachi wore the collar of gold, which he won
                        from the proud invader," no Irish hero was more celebrated than Finn Mac
                        Coul. What cabin is there, from the Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear, which is
                        not full of his glory?</p>
                     <p>Finn Mac Coul was famous for his strength of mind and body, for his wisdom
                        and his might. The Saxons fled before him when he unfurled Ireland's ancient
                        banner—which bore the poetical name of The Sunburst—and thousands arrayed
                        themselves around it; mountain and vale, plain and tarn, hall and bower,
                        were full of the glory of his graceful deeds of gentle courtesy. His mighty
                        mind was suitably lodged, for he was tall as one of the sons of Anak, and
                        might have passed for own brother to him of Gath.</p>
                     <p>Before relating any of his wonderful bodily achievements, it may be as well
                        to mention the mysterious manner in which his wisdom, like a tangible
                        revelation, fell upon him.</p>
                     <p>In the ancient days of Ireland's glory, the province of Munster was a
                        Kingdom, and was called Momonia. One of the Mac Carthy family had<pb
                           n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7173-00000028"/> sovereign sway. He was a
                        good-natured, soft-hearted, fat-headed sort of neutral character—one of that
                        class, still too common in Ireland, known by the apologetic <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">sobriquet</foreign> of "nobody's enemy but his own." He
                        kept open house for all comers, and the effect of his undiscriminating
                        hospitality was, that, a monarch in name, he was next to a pauper in
                        reality, living, as the saying is, quite "from hand to mouth." This he could
                        have borne, for, like the eels, he was used to it, but the empty state of
                        his exchequer rendered him unable to pay for the military services of his
                        subjects, and the result was, that his dominions gradually fell into a state
                        of partition among his brother monarchs of greater power, richer treasury,
                        and smaller hospitality.</p>
                     <p>It happened that one of these, named Mac Murragh—an ancestor of him whose
                        daughter's frailty led to the subjugation of Ireland by Henry II.—ruled over
                        Leinster, while poor Mac Carthy was enjoying nominal empire over the rich
                        plains of Munster. Mac Murragh was ambitious. He saw what an easy prey
                        Momonia might be. He wished to feed his herds upon that beautiful tract of
                        land intersected by the river Suir, which even yet is called "The Golden
                        Vale," and he declared war to the knife against King Mac Carthy.</p>
                     <p>It happened that Mac Carthy was fully aware of the value of the golden
                        vale—indeed, it was the very pride of his heart. He determined to resist his
                        foe, as best he could. But before taking up arms, on the defensive, he
                        resolved to have recourse to other than mortal aid.</p>
                     <p>It was some time before the avatar of Saint Patrick—that redoubted patriarch
                        whose mission it was to teach the benighted Irish the benefits of religion
                        and the blessings of whiskey. Therefore, under King Mac Carthy, Druidism was
                        the "established church." One of the most ancient Arch-Druids in Munster
                        resided in a cave near Mitchelstown, dug by his own hands in one of the
                        Galtee Mountains, and to him, in this emergency, King Mac Carthy betook
                        himself for advice and aid.</p>
                     <p>The Arch-Druid was noted, far and near, as an interpreter of dreams, a
                        diviner of auguries, an unraveller of mysteries, and a reader of prophecies.
                        Common rumor declared that he was master of enchantments,—that the thunder
                        rolled and the lightning flashed at his command,—that he had communion with
                        spirits from another world, and could compel them to obey his bidding.</p>
                     <p>After the performance of many rites and ceremonies, some penance and much
                        prayer, the Arch-Druid asked the King of Munster whether he knew that part
                        of the West which we now call Mayo? Mac Carthy replied that he ought to know
                        it, for he had been brought up there. "Then," said the Arch-Druid, "thither
                        we must go. For in one of the rivers which run through that district, by
                           the<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7173-00000029"/> foot of a lofty mountain,
                        there is a salmon, which, if caught, cooked, and eaten, will bestow long
                        life and health, wisdom and valor, success in arms and love, upon him who
                        eats it."</p>
                     <p>The King thanked the Arch-Druid for his information, and gave him a liberal
                        largess, when he added that in the book of the future it was written that
                        this wonderful fish was predestined to be caught by his own royal hands.
                        This put him into excellent spirits, and he proposed to the Arch-Druid that
                        they should "make a night of it," which they did, upon mead or
                        metheglin—for, in those days, whiskey had not been invented.</p>
                     <p>The next day they set off on their fishing-tour. The way was long, the roads
                        bad, and travelling rather dangerous. But, seating themselves on the
                        Arch-Druid's cloak, its wizard-owner muttering a few cabalistic words,
                        forthwith they were wafted, men and cloak, through the air, on the swift
                        wings of the wind, to the precipitous ridge of hills surrounding the lofty
                        rock now called Croagh Patrick. The cloak and its two passengers finally
                        dropped down on the bank of the river of which the Arch-Druid had
                        spoken.</p>
                     <p>They followed the course of the stream through one of the most fertile
                        valleys that sunshine ever glanced upon, until they reached a dark cavern
                        where the struggling waters sink suddenly into the earth. No one has yet
                        been able to ascertain whither the stream finally goes—whether it again
                        rises to the earth—whether it runs through a subterranean channel, or is
                        sucked in to quench the Phlegethon of this world's central fires. No one
                        knows—nor would it much matter if he did.</p>
                     <p>Close by the mouth of this cavern is a dark, deep hollow, over which the
                        gloom of eternal night ever seems to rest, and into which the stream falls
                        before it sinks into the abyss, whirling in foaming eddies, warring as in
                        agony, and casting up a jet of spray into the air. Loudly the waters roar as
                        they fall on the rugged rock beneath—they are whirled round and round,
                        until, at regular intervals, they descend into the yawning gulf beneath.</p>
                     <p>In this pool, among thousands of fishes, of all sorts and sizes, was the
                        Salmon of Knowledge, the possession of which was to make King Mac Carthy
                        amazingly wise, and irresistibly mighty. By this pool he sat, in company
                        with the Arch-Druid, day after day, for a whole month, until their patience
                        was nearly, and their provisions wholly, exhausted. They had sport enough to
                        satisfy Izaak Walton himself, for they were perpetually catching fish. There
                        was a little hut hard by, and in it the King and the Arch-Druid alternately
                        officiated as cook. Still, though he was latterly on a fish diet, the King
                        grew never the wise. He got so tired of that kind of food that historians
                        have gone the length of asserting that even a Hoboken turtle-feed<pb
                           n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7173-00000030"/> would have had no charm for his
                        palled appetite. Amid the finest fish that Royalty ever feasted upon, he
                        sighed for the white and red of his own fine mutton from the green fields of
                        Munster.</p>
                     <p>To add to his misfortune, though he wanted only one salmon, fish of all
                        sorts <emph>would</emph> hook themselves on to his line. There was perpetual
                        trouble in taking them off the hook. They determined to judge of the salmon,
                        as Lavater did of men, by their looks. Therefore the fat and plump fish
                        obtained the dangerous distinction of being broiled or boiled, while the
                        puny ones were thrown back, with the other fish, into the water.</p>
                     <p>Thus it happened that, one evening at dusk, a lank, lean, spent salmon
                        having been caught, they did not think it worth cooking, and the King took
                        it up to throw it back into the water. He did not cast it far enough, and
                        the poor fish remained on the bank. It was quietly wriggling itself back
                        into its native element, when it was espied by a little boy who had a
                        special taste for broiled fish. He seized it, took it home, made a fire, and
                        set about cooking it.</p>
                     <p>This youth was the famous Finn Mac Coul:—but he was not famous
                           <emph>then.</emph> He had fled from the South, from some enemies of his
                        family, and, being hungry, the salmon, poor and lean as it seemed, was
                        better to him than nothing.</p>
                     <p>The fire being red, he put the salmon upon it. The poor fish, not quite
                        dead, writhed on the live coals, and the heat caused a great blister to
                        swell out upon its side. Finn Mac. Coul noticed this, and, fearing that the
                        fish would be spoiled if the blister were to rise any more, pressed his
                        thumb upon it. The heat soon made him withdraw it. Naturally enough, he put
                        it into his mouth to draw out the pain. At that moment, he felt a strange
                        thrill throughout his whole frame. He was suddenly changed in mind. The
                        moment that thumb touched his lips he had increase of knowledge.
                           <emph>That</emph> told him that he could do no better than devour the
                        salmon. That done, he was a changed Finn—a new and enlarged edition, with
                        additions; quite a tall paper copy.</p>
                     <p>That night, Finn Mac Coul quietly strayed down to the cavern, and found the
                        King and the Arch-Druid at high words. His majesty had dreamed, in his
                        afternoon nap, that the Salmon of Knowledge had been on his hook, and that
                        the Arch-Druid had coaxed it off, and privily cooked and eaten it. Finn told
                        him that the Arch-Druid knew that the salmon could be caught only by a
                        King's hand, but had intended, even before they left Munster, to cook and
                        eat it himself, and then to usurp the crown. The Arch-Druid, who had a
                        conscience, had not a word of explanation or excuse. The King immediately
                        ran him through the body, and engaged Finn (who, by this time, had shot up
                        to the height of twelve feet) to lead his armies against the invading King
                           of<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7173-00000031"/> Leinster, and the result was
                        that, so far from conquering Munster, and appropriating the Golden Vale,
                        King Mac Murragh was obliged to pray for pardon, and to pay tribute to King
                        Mac Carthy, who thenceforward, with the aid of Finn Mac Coul's strength of
                        mind and body, was the most powerful of all the monarchs of Ireland.</p>

                     <head>THE BREAKS OF BALLYNASCORNEY.</head>
                     <p>CONTEMPORARY with Finn Mac Coul, was the renowned giant, called Ossian.
                        There has been a question whether he were Scotch or Irish. But as Ossian
                        certainly came all the way from Scotland to compete with Finn Mac Coul, it
                        is not likely that they were countrymen.</p>
                     <p>That contest—it was of the description given by Ovid of what took place
                        between Ajax and Ulysses. Go to that wild and beautiful district near
                        Dublin, that patch of mountain scenery, so splendid and romantic, known as
                        the Breaks of Ballynascorney and learn, as I did, what tradition now reports
                        of the contest between Ossian and Finn Mac Coul.</p>
                     <p>A mountain road winds through these Breaks, like a huge snake. By the
                        road-side there stands a tremendous rock of granite—perfectly isolated. Many
                        such are to be seen scattered over the island, and the general belief is,
                        that each column-stone marks the spot where some noted warrior had fallen in
                        the old contests between the Irish and their Danish invaders. A different
                        legend belongs to <emph>this</emph> rock.</p>
                     <p>The day had been beautiful—one of those brilliant days of softness and balm
                        so prevalent in Ireland. The noontide sun may have been a little too
                           sunny,<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7173-00000032"/> but this could be
                        remedied by reposing in the pleasant shadow of some of the lofty cairns
                        which abound in that place. The day gently glided on, until, when a
                        summer-shower made the heath glitter with its diamond drops, we sought
                        shelter in a rustic cabin by the wayside.</p>
                     <p>No one was within, but an old woman, remarkably talkative. She paid us a
                        world of attention—insinuated a world of compliments on the beaming beauty
                        of the fair lady who accompanied me—would "engage that one so pretty was not
                        without a sweetheart," and, with a smile at myself, "would not be long
                        without a husband"—hoped that she "would be happy as the day was long, and
                        live to see her great-grand-children at her feet,"—was certain she was an
                        Irishwoman, "for she had the fair face, and the small hand, and the dark
                        blue eye, and the long black lash, and the bounding step," and prophesied
                        more good fortune than (to one of the party, at least) has yet been
                        fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>This old woman was a good specimen of a shrewd Irish peasant. Her
                        compliments were insinuated, rather than expressed; and, <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">malgré</foreign> the brogue, I question when more delicate
                        flattery—pleasant, after all, to one's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">amour
                           propre</foreign>—could be more dexterously conveyed in the circles which
                        we call brilliant. This tact in the matter of compliment appears
                        intuitive.</p>
                     <p>Allusion having been made to the granite column in the neighborhood, our
                        hostess asked whether we should like "to know all about it." The answer was
                        in the affirmative, and then—happy to hear the tones of her own voice, proud
                        of giving information to persons above her own station, and in pleased
                        anticipation of a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">douceur</foreign>—she told us a
                        legend which, as she was rather prolix, I shall take leave to give you in my
                        own words.</p>

                     <head>FINN MAC COUL'S FINGER-STONE.</head>
                     <p>FINN MAC COUL went hunting one day on the Curragh of Kildare. His sport was
                        indifferent, for he brought down only a leash of red deer, and a couple of
                        wolves. He came back to his house, on the hill of Allen, in such bad
                        spirits, that his wife asked him what was the matter, and said that, no
                        doubt, he would have better sport another time. Heaving a deep sigh, he told
                        her that it was not his bad sport that annoyed him, but that news had that
                        morning reached him that Ossian, the Scotch giant, was coming over to
                        challenge him to a trial of strength, and if he lost the day—for he could
                        not decline the contest—his credit, and the credit of Ireland, would be gone
                        forever.</p>
                     <p>At this news, Finn's wife became as low-spirited as himself. They sat by the
                        fire, like Witherington, "in doleful dumps," and their thoughts were the
                        reverse of happy.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly, the lady—for the life of me I cannot bring myself to designate her
                        as plain "Mrs. Mac Coul"—asked her disconsolate lord and master at what time
                        Ossian was expected to arrive? Finn told her that the Scottish Hercules had
                        intimated his intention of paying his visit at noon on the following lowing
                        day. "Oh! then," said she, brightening up, "there's no need to despair.
                        Leave all to me, and I'll bring you through it like a Trojan. A blot is no
                        blot until 'tis entered." This remark, showing at once her philosophy and
                        her knowledge of back gammon, was very consolatory to Finn Mac Coul who,
                        like men before and since, was rather under what is called petticoat
                        government. His mind was relieved when his wife saw daylight.</p>
                     <p>After breakfast, the next day, Finn (by his wife's direction) went into a
                        huge child's-cradle, a feat which he had some difficulty in accomplishing.
                        There he lay, crumpled up uneasily, while she kept busy in the kitchen,
                        baking some cake or griddle bread.</p>
                     <p>By-and-bye, up came Ossian, who knocked at the door, and civilly inquired
                        whether Finn Mac Coul lived there, and if he were at home? "No," said his
                        wife, "he's gone to the fair of Bartlemy; but I am his wife, and, perhaps, I
                        can answer for him."</p>
                     <p>"What!" said Ossian, "did not he hear that I, Ossian of Scotland, was coming
                        over for a trial of strength with him? I hope he does not mean to skulk.
                        Wherever he may be, I shall not return home until I <emph>see</emph> him,
                        and until he <emph>feel</emph> me."</p>
                     <p>When the wife found that Ossian was too far North to be put off by a "not at
                        home," she put the best face on it, welcomed him to Ireland, hoped he had a
                        pleasant passage, and that the tossing on<pb n="66-67"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000034"/> the salt-water did not disagree with him,
                        invited him into the house, and said that Finn would soon be back, and ready
                        to indulge him in any way he pleased.</p>
                     <p>Ossian sat down by the fire, quite at his ease. He had a great conceit of
                        himself, and was, indeed, the strongest man in Europe at that time. He
                        noticed the large cakes that were baking in the oven, each of them taking
                        two stone weight of flour, and asked why she made them of such a size. "They
                        are for that little creature in the cradle, there," said she, pointing over
                        her shoulder to Finn. Then Ossian looked round, and noticed the cradle, with
                        Finn in it, and a night-cap on his head, and tied under his chin, and he
                        pretending to be fast asleep all the time.</p>
                     <p>Astonished at the immense bulk, Ossian called out, "Who's there? What man is
                        that in the cradle?" "Man!" said Finn's wife, with a pleasant little laugh,
                        "that's our youngest child. I am weaning him now, and I sometimes think the
                        fairies have overlooked him, he's so dwarfed and small, and does not promise
                        to be half the size of his father and his brothers."</p>
                     <p>Ossian never said a word to that; but he could not take his eyes off the
                        cradle, thinking, no doubt, if the undergrown baby was such a bouncer, what
                        must the father be.</p>
                     <p>By-and-bye, Finn's wife told Ossian that, as he had a long journey, and Finn
                        was staying out longer than she expected, he might as well take some
                        refreshment, without waiting for him. The cakes were nice and brown by this
                        time, and she asked him to break his fast with one of them. He took it, and
                        when he made a bite in it, he roared again with pain, for his two best front
                        teeth were broken. "Oh!" he cried out, "it is as hard as iron,"—and so it
                        might be, for she had put an iron griddle into it, and baked it with it in.
                        "Hard!" said she. "Why, that child there would not taste it if it were a bit
                        softer."</p>
                     <p>Then she recommended Ossian to wash the pain away with a sup of the finest
                        whiskey in the province; and she fetched a wooden <hi rend="i"/>piggin, that
                        would hold about a gallon to a gallon and a half, and filled it to the brim.
                        Ossian took a long pull at it; as much as a quart or so. Then Finn's wife
                        laughed downright at him for taking so little. "Why," said she, "the child
                        there in the cradle thinks nothing of emptying that <hi rend="i"/>piggin in
                        one draught." So, for shame's sake, and because he did not like to be
                        thought a milk-sop, Ossian took a little more, and a little more yet, until,
                        before long, the liquor got the better of him.</p>
                     <p>Now, this was the very pass that the good wife wished to bring him to.
                        "While his father is out," said she, "and I wonder why he is not home before
                        now, may-be you'd like to see the child there throw a stone, or try a fall
                        with you, or do any of the diverting<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7173-00000035"
                        /> verting little tricks that his father teaches him." Ossian consented, and
                        she went over to the cradle and gave Finn a shake. "Wake up, dear," said
                        she, "and amuse the gentleman."</p>
                     <p>So Finn stretched himself, and Ossian wondered at his black beard, and his
                        great bulk. "'Pon my word," said he, "you're a fine child for your age."
                        Then, turning to Finn's wife, he asked, "Has he cut any of his teeth yet?"
                        She bade him feel his gums. Then Ossian put two of his fingers into Finn's
                        mouth, and the moment they were there Finn bit them to the bone. Ossian
                        jumped round the room with pain. "Ah!" said Finn's wife, "you should see his
                        father's teeth; he thinks nothing of biting off the head of a two-shilling
                        nail, when he uses it for a tooth-pick."</p>
                     <p>By this time, Ossian was far from comfortable. But he thought he must put
                        the best face on it; so he said to Finn, "Come, my lad, let us see how your
                        father teaches you to wrestle."</p>
                     <p>Finn did not say a word, but grappled Ossian round the waist, and laid him
                        sprawling on the ground before he could say "Jack Robinson." Ossian picked
                        himself up, very sulkily, and rubbed the place that had come in contact with
                        the hard floor of the kitchen.</p>
                     <p>"Now," said Finn's wife, "may-be you'd like to see the child throw a stone."
                        And then Finn went in front of the house, where there was a heap of great
                        rocks, and he took up the very identical stone which now stands in the
                        Breaks of Ballynascorey, and flung it all the way from the hill of Allen. To
                        this day it bears the marks of Finn's five fingers and thumb—for his hand
                        was not like an ordinary hand—when he grasped it; and to this day, also,
                        that stone bears Finn's name.</p>
                     <p>Ossian was greatly surprised, as well he might be, at such a cast. He asked,
                        "Could your father throw such a stone much farther?"—"Is it my father?" said
                        Finn: "faith, he'd cast it all the way to America, or Scotland, or the
                        Western Injes, and think nothing of it!"</p>
                     <p>This was enough for Ossian. He would not venture on a trial of strength with
                        the father, when the son could beat him. So he pretended to recollect some
                        sudden business that called him back, post-haste, to Scotland, thinking he
                        never could get away half quick enough. And the stone remains where Finn
                        threw it, and, if you only go that way, any one on or near the Sigham
                        mountain will show you FINN MAC COUL'S FINGER-STONE.</p>

                     <p>IRISH Legends almost invariably remind me of the Field of Waterloo. When our
                        tourists rushed <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en masse,</foreign> to behold the
                        plain on which the destinies of Europe had been decided, they exhibited the
                        usual relic-hunting and relic-buying mania. Bullets and helmet ornaments,
                        rusty pistols and broken swords, buttons and spurs, and such things—actually
                        found on the battle-field—were soon disposed of, while of the tourists it
                        might be said, as of the host of Dunsinane, "The cry is still 'they come!'"
                        So, the demand exceeding the legitimate supply, the Belgian peasantry began
                        to dispose of fictitious relics, and a very profitable trade it was for a
                        long time. To this day, they are carefully manufactured, "to order," by more
                        than one of the hardware makers of Birmingham.</p>
                     <p>In the same manner, Irish legends having become a marketable commodity
                        (Carleton and Crofton Croker, Banim and Griffin, Lover and Whitty,<pb
                           n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7173-00000038"/> having worked the vein deeply),
                        people had recourse to invention instead of tradition—like George
                        Psalmanazar's History of Formosa, in which fiction supplied the place of
                        fact. Very amusing, no doubt; but not quite fair. More ingenious than
                        honest. Therefore, the Irish story I shall relate, if it possesses none
                        other, shall have the merit, at least, of being "founded on facts."</p>
                     <p>Fermoy is one of the prettiest towns in Ireland. It is not very remote from
                        that very distinguished Southern metropolis—of pigs and porter—known as "the
                        beautiful city of Cork." Midway between city and town lies Water-grass-hill,
                        a pretty village, located on the highest arable land in Ireland, and now
                        immortal as having once been the residence of the celebrated Father Prout.
                        Some people prefer the country-town to the crowded city: for, though its
                        trade be small, its society rather too fond of scandal, its church without a
                        steeple, and its politicians particularly intolerant, Fermoy is in the heart
                        of a fertile and picturesque tract, and there flows through it that noble
                        river, the Blackwater, honorably mentioned by Spenser, and honored in later
                        song as the scene where might be beheld <q>

                     <p>The scenery around Fermoy is indeed most beautiful tiful, and

                        Thierna—the Lord's rock, commonly spoken of as Corran—which, to such of the
                        inhabitants as have not seen greater elevations, appears a mountain entitled
                        to vie with what they have heard of the Alps, Appenines, or Andes.</p>
                     <p>Although Fermoy now contains fully seven hundred houses (exclusive of
                        stables and pigsties), and a population of nearly seven thousand souls, men,
                        women, and children—to say nothing of horses, oxen, sheep, mules, donkies,
                        cats, dogs, and such other creatures as have no souls—it was not always so
                        extensive and populous.</p>
                     <p>In every town a high traditional authority is constantly referred to as
                        "within the memory of the oldest inhabitant," and it may be stated, on this
                        antique authority, that, not much more than half a century since, Fermoy was
                        a very small and obscure hamlet, consisting of no more than one little
                        pot-house and half a dozen other mud-cabins, luxuriantly located, with some
                        ingenuity, so as to enjoy, front and rear, a <emph>maximum</emph> of the
                        morning and afternoon sunshine. These domiciles were ranged in a row, and
                        hence arose the figurative saying, "All on one side, like the town of
                        Fermoy." The energy, ability, and capital of one man (the late John
                        Anderson, who introduced mail-coaches into Ireland), raised the village of
                        Fermoy into a populous and thriving town, which, in 1809, was a merry
                        place—partly owing toy<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7173-00000039"/> the mirth
                        whose chief minister was Remmy Carroll, son of old Carroll, the piper.</p>
                     <p>As Remmy is the hero of my tale, it is only proper that I should describe
                        him. Irish parlance emphatically distinguished him as "a mighty clever boy,"
                        which did not mean a compliment to his capacity or acquirements, but was
                        simply a figure of speech to declare that this Hibernian Orpheus stood about
                        "six feet two in his stocking-vamps." Remmy Carroll's personal appearance
                        was not quite as <foreign xml:lang="FRA">distingué</foreign> as that of his
                        great contemporary, Beau Brummell. His coat, originally of blue frieze, had
                        worn down, by age and service, to a sort of bright gray, tessellated, like
                        mosaic-work, with emendations of the original substance carefully annexed
                        thereto by Remmy's own industrious fingers. The garment, like the wearer,
                        had known many a fray, and Remmy was wont to observe, jocularly, when he sat
                        down to repair these breaches, that then, like a man of landed property, he
                        was occupied in "taking his rents."</p>
                     <p>Care is not very likely to kill a man who can jest upon his own poverty.
                        Accordingly, Remmy Carroll was as light-hearted a fellow as could be met
                        with in town or country. He was a gentleman accustomed to live how and where
                        he could, and he was welcomed everywhere. It was mentioned, as an undoubted
                        fact, that where men of substance—rich farmers and thriving shopkeepers—had
                        been very coldly received by bright-eyed angels in petticoats, looks and
                        even words of encouragement had been extended to Remmy Carroll. The fair sex
                        are proverbially of a kind nature, especially towards young men, who, like
                        Carroll, have handsome features and jocund speech, lofty stature and winning
                        smiles, that symmetry of limb which pleases the eye, and that subduing
                        conversation which pleases the ear. What was more, Remmy Carroll knew very
                        well—none better!—that he was a favorite with the rose-cheeked Venuses of
                        Fermoy and its vicinity. It may be mentioned also—as <foreign xml:lang="ITA"
                           >sotto voce</foreign> as type can express it—that he was also perfectly
                        aware that he was a very personable fellow, what Coleridge has described as
                        "a noticeable man." Was there ever any one, no matter of what age or sex,
                        possessing personal advantages, who was not fully aware of the fact?</p>
                     <p>It would be tedious to expatiate very particularly upon the extent and
                        variety of Remmy Carroll's accomplishments. He followed the hereditary
                        profession of his family, and was distinguished, far and near, for his
                        really splendid execution on the Irish pipes—an instrument which can be made
                        to "discourse most excellent music," and must never be confounded with the
                        odious drone of the Scottish bag-pipes. Remmy's performance could almost
                        excite the very chairs, tables, and three-legged stools to dance. One set of
                        pipes is worth a dozen fiddles,<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7173-00000040"/> for
                        it can "take the shine out of them all" in point of loudness. But then,
                        these same pipes can do more than make a noise. The warrior, boldest in the
                        field, is gentlest at the feet of his ladye-love; and so, the Irish pipes,
                        which can sound a strain almost as loud as a trumpet-call, can also breathe
                        forth a tide of gushing melody—sweet, soft, and low as the first whisper of
                        mutual love. You have never felt the eloquent expression of Irish music, if
                        you have not heard it from the Irish pipes.<ref rend="super"
                           target="#note_003" xml:id="return_003">*</ref> It is quite marvellous
                        that, amid all the novelties of instrumentation (if I may coin a word) which
                        are thrust upon the patient public, season after season—including the
                        Jews'-harping of Eulenstein, the chin-chopping of Michael Boiai, and the
                        rock-harmonicon of the Derbyshire mechanics—no one has thought of exhibiting
                        the melodious performance of an Irish piper. If he confined himself to the
                        Irish melodies, and really were a first-rate performer, he could not fail to
                        please, to delight, to astonish. But, again I say, do not confound the sweet
                        harmony of the Irish with the drony buzz of the Scotch pipes.</p>

                        <p><ref target="#return_003">*</ref>This praise of the Irish pipes is by no
                           means exaggerated. The last performer of any note, in Fermoy, was an
                           apothecary, named O'Donnell, who certainly could make them discourse
                           "most eloquent music." He died about fifteen years ago. It was almost
                           impossible to listen with dry eyes and unmoved heart to the exquisite
                           manner in which he played the Irish melodies—the <emph>real</emph> ones,
                           I mean—not those which Tom Moore and Sir John Stevenson had "adopted"
                           (and emasculated) for polite and fashionable piano-forte players and
                           singers. There is now in New York a gentleman, named Charles Ferguson,
                           whose performance on the Irish pipes may be said to equal—it could not
                           surpass—that of O'Donnell.</p>
                     </note>
                     <p>Remmy Carroll's accomplishments were not limited to things musical. He could
                        out-walk, out-run, and out-leap any man in the barony of Condons and
                        Clongibbons; aye, or of any five other baronies in the county of Cork, the
                        Yorkshire of Ireland. He could back the most vicious horse that ever dared
                        to rear and kick against human supremacy. He had accepted the challenge
                        scornfully given to the whole world, by Big Brown of Kilworth, to wrestle,
                        and had given him four fair falls out of five, a matter so much taken to
                        heart by the said Big one, that he emigrated to London, where, overcome with
                        liquor and loyalty, he was tempted to enlist in an infantry regiment, and
                        was shot through the head at the storming of Badajoz some short time
                        after.</p>
                     <p>Remmy Carroll could do, and had done more than defeat Brown. He could swim
                        like a fish, was the only man ever known to dive under that miniature
                        Maëlstrom which eddies at the base of The Nailer's Rock (nearly opposite
                        Barnäan Well), and, before he was one-and-twenty, had saved nine
                        unfortunates from being drowned in the fatal Blackwater.<ref rend="super"

                        <p><ref target="#return_004">*</ref>There really was a person named Carroll
                           residing in Fermoy at the date of this story. He was of gigantic stature
                           and strength, with the mildest temper ever possessed by mortal man. He
                           was noted for his excellence in swimming and his remarkable skill as a
                           diver. Whenever any person had been drowned in the Black-water, (which
                           runs through Fermoy,) Carroll was sent for, and never quitted the river
                           until he had found the body. There is one part considered particularly
                           dangerous, opposite Barnäan Well, in which a large projection, called the
                           Nailer's Rock, shelves out into the water, making an under-current of
                           such peculiar strength and danger, that even expert swimmers avoid it,
                           from a fear of being drawn within the vortex. Many lives have been lost
                           in this fatal eddy, into which Carroll was accustomed to dive, most
                           fearlessly, in search of the bodies. It was calculated that Carroll had
                           actually saved twenty-two persons from being drowned, and had recovered
                           over fifty corpses from the river. When he died, which event happened at
                           the commencement of the bathing season, a general sorrow fell upon all
                           classes in the town of Fermoy, and for several weeks no one ventured into
                           the river. It was as if their guardian and safeguard had departed. In my
                           youth, passed on the banks of the Blackwater, there was a belief that
                           whenever one person was drowned in that river, two others were sure to
                           follow, in the same season.</p>

                     <p>No man in the county could beat him at hurly, or foot-ball. He was a crack
                        hand at a faction-fight on a fair day—only, as a natural spirit of
                        generosity sometimes impelled him, with a reckless chivalry, to side with
                        the weaker party, he had, more than once, been found magnanimously battling
                        against his own friends.</p>
                     <p>Yet more.—Having had the advantage of three years' instruction at Tim Daly's
                        far-famed Academy, Remmy Carroll was master of what a farmer, more
                        alliterative than wise, called "the mystery of the three R's:—Reading,
                        'Riting, and 'Rithmetic." He knew, by the simple taste, when the Potheen was
                        sufficiently "above proof." He had a ten-Irishman power of love-making, and
                        while the maidens (with blushes, smiles, and softly-similated angers) would
                        exclaim, "Ah, then, be done, Remmy!—for a deluder as ye are!" there usually
                        was such a sly intelligence beaming from their bright eyes, as assured him
                        that he was not unwelcome; and then he felt it his duty to kiss them into
                        perfect good-humor and forgiveness.—But I am cataloguing his accomplishments
                        at too much length. Let it suffice to declare, that Remmy Carroll was
                        confessedly the Admirable Crichton of the district.</p>
                     <p>He was an independent citizen of the world—for he had no particular settled
                        habitation. He was a popular character—for every habitation was open to him,
                        from Tim Mulcahy's, who lived with his wife and pig, in a windowless
                        mud-cabin, at the foot of Corran, to Mr. Bartle Mahony's two-story slated
                        house, on a three hundred acre farm, at Carrigabrick, on the banks of the
                        Blackwater. At the latter abode of wealth, however, Remmy Carroll had not
                        lately called.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Bartholomew Mahony—familiarly called "Bartle"—was a man of substance.
                        Had he lived now, he might have sported a hunter for himself, and set up a
                        jaunting-car for his daughter. But they<pb n="82-83"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000042"/> honest, well-to-do farmer had at once too
                        much pride and sagacity to sink into the <hi rend="i"/>Squireen. He was
                        satisfied with his station in life, and did not aspire beyond it. He was
                        passing rich in the world's eye. Many, even of the worldlings, thought less
                        of his wealth than of his daughter, Mary. Of all who admired, none loved her
                        half so well as poor Remmy Carroll, who loved the more deeply, because very
                        hopelessly, inasmuch as her wealth and his own poverty shut him out from all
                        reasonable prospect of success. He admired—nay, that is by far too weak a
                        word: he almost adored her, scarcely daring to confess, even to his own
                        heart, how closely her image was blended with the very life of his
                        being.</p>
                     <p>Mary Mahony was an Irish beauty; that most indescribable of all breathing
                        loveliness, with dark hair, fair skin, and violet eyes, a combination to
                        which the brilliant pencil of Maclise has often rendered justice. She had a
                        right to look high, in a matrimonial way, for she was an heiress in her own
                        right. She had ¥500 left her as a legacy by an old maiden-aunt, near
                        Mitchelstown, who had taken care of her from her twelfth year, when she left
                        the famous Academy of the renowned Tim Daly (where she and Remmy used to
                        write together at the same desk), until some eight months previous to the
                        date of this authentic narrative, when the maiden-aunt died, bequeathing her
                        property, as aforesaid, to Mary Mahony, who then returned to her father.</p>
                     <p>With all her good fortune, including the actual of the legacy, and the ideal
                        of inheritance to her father's property—with beauty sufficient to have
                        turned the head of any other damsel of eighteen, Mary Mahony was far from
                        pride or conceit. She had the lithest form and the most graceful figure in
                        the world, but many maidens, with far less means, wore much more showy and
                        expensive apparel. Her dark hair was plainly braided off her white brow, in
                        bands, in the simplest and most graceful manner; while, from beneath,
                        gleamed orbs so beautiful, that one might have said to her, in the words of
                        John Ford, the dramatist, <q>

                        usually satisfied, at that time, with a dress so quiet and so much the
                        reverse of gay.</p>
                     <p>But Mary Mahony's beauty required nothing to<pb n="84-85"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000043"/> set it off. I do not exaggerate when I say
                        that it was literally dazzling. I saw her twenty years after the date of
                        this narrative, and was even then struck with admiration of her matured
                        loveliness;—how rich, then, must it have been in the bud!</p>
                     <p>Mary, as Remmy Carroll said <emph>before</emph> he knew that he loved
                        her—for <emph>then,</emph> he never breathed her name to mortal ear,—was
                        "the moral of a darling creature, only t'would be hard to say whether she
                        was most good or handsome." Her hair, as I have said, was dark (light
                        tresses are comparatively rare in Ireland), and her eyes were of so deep a
                        blue that nine out of ten on whom they glanced mistook them for black. Then,
                        too, the long lashes veiling them, and the lovely cheek ("oh, call it fair,
                        not pale"), on which their silky length reposed,—and the lips so red and
                        pouting, and the bust whose gentle heavings were just visible behind the
                        modest kerchief which covered it,—and the brow white as snow (but neither
                        too high nor too prominent),—and the fingers tapering and round, and the
                        form lithe and graceful,—and the feet small and well-shaped, and the
                        nameless air which gave dignity and grace to every motion of this
                        country-girl! Oh, beautiful was Mary Mahony, beautiful as the bright image
                        of a poet's dream, the memory of which shadows he forth in the verse which
                        challenges immortality in the minds of men.</p>
                     <p>The <foreign xml:lang="FRA">contour</foreign> of her face was neither Roman,
                        nor Grecian, nor Gothic;—it was essentially Irish, and I defy you to find a
                        finer. The only drawback (for I must be candid) was that her nose had
                        somewhat—just the slightest—of an upward inclination. This, which sometimes
                        lent a sort of piquancy to what would otherwise have been quite a
                        Madonna-like face, only made her not too handsome; at least, so thought her
                        admirers. Lastly, she had a voice as sweet as ear ever loved to listen to.
                        No doubt, it had the distinguishing accents of her country, but with her, as
                        with Scott's Ellen, they were <q>

                     <p>IT was in the summer of 1809, that, for the first time since both of them
                        were children and schoolmates, Remmy Carroll spoke to Mary Mahony. Often had
                        he seen her at the dance, which without his aid could not be, but in which,
                        alas, <emph>he</emph> could not join—a dancing piper being almost as
                        anomalous as a hunting archbishop! Often had he admired the natural grace of
                        her movements. Often had he been struck by the bewitching modesty of mien
                        and motion which had the power of suddenly changing they<pb n="86-87"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000044"/> rakish, rollicking gallantry of her followers
                        (for she was a reigning toast) into a most respectful homage. Often had he
                        noticed her at chapel, whither she came to pray, while others flaunted and
                        gazed as if they had come only to see and to be seen. Often had he followed
                        her very footsteps, at a distance—for the very ground on which she trod was
                        hallowed to this humble lover—but never yet had he dared to hope.</p>
                     <p>The shortest way from Fermoy to Carrigabrick is by the banks of the
                        Blackwater, and this way, on Whitsunday, 1809, was taken by Mary Mahony and
                        a merry younger cousin of hers on their homeward route. There are stiles to
                        be crossed, and deep drains to be jumped over, and even a pretty steep wall
                        to be climbed.</p>
                     <p>Remmy Carroll, who knew that they would thus return home, had followed the
                        maidens afar off,—sighing to think, as they crossed the stiles, with a world
                        of gentle laughter, that he must not dare to think of proffering them any
                        assistance. With all his love—perhaps, indeed, because of it—he had hitherto
                        been careful to avoid the chance of even a casual notice from the subject of
                        his untold passion. <emph>She</emph> was wealthy, <emph>he</emph> was poor;
                        and, therefore, he shrunk from the object of his unuttered passion. Her
                        feelings towards him at this time were rather kind than otherwise. She knew,
                        what all the parish were unacquainted with, that Remmy devoted the greater
                        portion of his earnings, not only to the support port of a bed-ridden old
                        aunt, who had neither kith nor kin save himself in the wide world, but even
                        to the procuring for her what might be esteemed rather as luxuries than mere
                        comforts. Whatever might be the deficiencies in Remmy Carroll's wardrobe,
                        his old aunt never went without "the raking cup of tay" morning and evening.
                        Was it because she had noticed how carefully Remmy Carroll avoided her, that
                        the bright eyes of Mary Mahony rested upon him with some degree of interest,
                        and that she even liked to listen to and encourage her father's praises of
                        his conduct towards his aged relative, for whose comfortable support he
                        sacrificed dress—the natural vent for youthful vanity in both sexes?</p>
                     <p>Mary and her merry cousin went on, through the fields, until they reached
                        the most difficult pass. This was a deep chasm separating two meadows. A
                        deep and rapid stream flowed through the abyss, whirlingly pouring its
                        strong current into the Blackwater. The maidens lightly and laughingly
                        tripped down the steps which were rudely cut on the side of the chasm. It
                        was but a quick, short jump across. Hark!—a sudden shriek! He cleared the
                        wall at a bound—he dashed across the meadow—in one minute he was plunging
                        down the abyss. He saw that Mary's cousin had safely reached the other side,
                        where she stood uselessly wringing her hands, and screaming in an agony of
                        despair, while Mary (precipitated into the deep and swollen stream, her
                           foot<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7173-00000045"/> having slipped) was in the
                        act of being hurried into the eddies of the Blackwater. There was no time
                        for delay. He plunged into the stream, dived for the body, which had just
                        then sunk again, and, in less time than I have taken to tell it, had placed
                        his insensible but still lovely <emph>treasure trove</emph> on the bank
                        which he just quitted. The other maiden no sooner saw that her cousin had
                        been rescued than—according to womanly custom in such cases, I
                           presume—<emph>she</emph> immediately swooned away, leaving poor Remmy to
                        take care of Mary Mahony.</p>
                     <p>With the gentlest care he could employ, he exerted his best skill to restore
                        her, and, in a short time, had the inexpressible delight of seeing her open
                        her eyes. It was but for a moment; she glanced wildly around, and again
                        closed them. Soon the bloom returned to her cheek—and now she felt, though
                        she saw not, that she lay supported in the arms of Remmy Carroll; for, as he
                        leant over her, and her breathing came softly and balmily upon his face, his
                        lips involuntarily were pressed to hers, and the maiden, through whose frame
                        that stolen embrace thrilled, with a new and bewildering sensation, might be
                        forgiven, if, at that moment, she intuitively knew who had thus brushed the
                        dewy sweetness from her lips; might be forgiven, if, from that epoch, there
                        gushed into her heart a feeling more kind, more deep, more pervading, than
                        ordinary gratitude.</p>
                     <p>By this time, the pretty cousin had thought proper to recover; nor has it
                        yet been accurately ascertained whether, indeed, she had or had not beheld
                        the oscular proceeding which I have mentioned. Now, however, she hastened to
                        pay the feminine attentions, more suitable to the situation of a
                        half-drowned young lady, than those which Remmy Carroll had attempted to
                        bestow. He had the satisfaction, however, of carefully taking Mary Mahony
                        across the stream in his arms. Nay, before he departed, she had softly
                        whispered her gratitude; and in her tone and manner, there was that which
                        breathed hope to him, even against hope. Though he quitted them, he loitered
                        about while they remained in sight, and just as Mary Mahony was vanishing
                        through the stile which opened into her father's lands, she turned round,
                        saw her deliverer watching her at a distance, and she kissed her hand to him
                        as she withdrew.</p>
                     <p>From that hour the current of his life flowed on with a fresher bound—the
                        fountain of hope welled out its sparkling waters, for the first time, from
                        its depths. To the world—to no living soul, would he have dared to avow his
                        new-born feeling, that Mary Mahony might one day be his own. Within his
                        heart of hearts it lay, and with it was the consciousness, that to win her
                        he must merit her. <emph>How,</emph> he knew not; but the resolve is
                        much.</p>
                     <p>Three months glided on. Carroll continued to pursue his calling as a
                        music-maker, and not a wedding<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7173-00000046"/> ding
                        nor christening passed by, or, indeed, could pass by, without the assistance
                        of his "professional" powers. But he now became what a young and gay
                        Irishman seldom is—a hoarder of his earnings. He laid aside much of the wild
                        and reckless mirth which had made him, despite his poverty, the king of good
                        fellows. Remmy was, in many respects, above the generality of his class; for
                        he had got a tolerably good education; he was quick at repartee, and not
                        without a certain manly grace of manner; his conversation was never
                        garnished with expletives; he had a good voice, and could sing with
                        considerable effect; he was an adept in fairy lore and romantic legends; and
                        he was accustomed to retail news from the newspapers to a wondering
                        auditory, so that the marvel was how he could be "such a janius entirely."
                        Hence his popularity with all classes. But now, as I have said, he laid
                        aside all mirth that might involve outlay. His manners became sedate, almost
                        grave,—nay, if we dared to apply such high words to a man of such low degree
                        as an Irish piper, it might be added, that a certain degree of quiet dignity
                        became blended with his speech and actions. Like the wedding guest described
                        by Coleridge, he seemed "a sadder and a wiser man." Such a change could not
                        pass unobserved, and while one-half the circle of his acquaintance shook
                        their heads, and ominously whispered, "Sure the boy must be fairy-struck,"
                        the fairer moiety suggested that the alteration tion must have been produced
                        by Love, though even their sagacity and observation failed to ascertain the
                        object of his passion.</p>

                     <p>THE aim and the result of Remmy Carroll's newly-acquired habits of economy
                        and self-denial became evident, at length, when his appearance, one Sunday,
                        in the Chapel of Fermoy—it was the Old Chapel, with mud walls and a thatched
                        roof, which stood in that part of Cork Hill whence now diverges the narrow
                        passage called Waterloo Lane—caused a most uncommon sensation. It was
                        Remmy's first appearance, on any stage, in the character of a country-beau.
                        His ancient coat was put into Schedule A (like certain pocket-boroughs in
                        the Reform Bill), and was replaced by a garment from the tasty hands of
                        Dandy Cash, at that time the Stultz of Fermoy and its vicinity. This was a
                        broad-skirted coat of blue broadcloth, delicately embellished with the
                        brilliancy of shining gilt buttons, each not much larger than a half-dollar.
                        A vest of bright yellow kerseymere, with a double-row of plump
                        mother-of-pearl studs; a new pair of closely-fitting unmentionables,<pb
                           n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7173-00000047"/> with a liberal allowance of drab
                        ribbons pensile at the knees; gray worsted stockings, of the rig-and-furrow
                        sort, displaying the muscular calf and the arched instep; neat pumps, with
                        soles not quite half an inch thick, and the uppers made "elegant" by the
                        joint appliances of lampblack and grease (considered to <emph>nourish</emph>
                        the leather much better than "Warren's jet blacking, the pride of
                        mankind");—a well-fitting shirt of fine bandle-linen, bleached to an
                        exquisite whiteness, and universally looked upon as a <foreign
                           xml:lang="LAT">noli me tangere</foreign> of provincial buckism, with a
                        silk <emph>grinder</emph> "round his nate neck," and a tall Carlisle hat,
                        encircled with an inch-wide ribbon—such were the component parts of Remmy
                        Carroll's new costume. True it is, that he left a little too much to the
                        taste of Dandy Cash, the dogmatic and singularly conceited Snip; but still,
                        Nature had done so much for him that he appeared quite a new man, the
                        handsomest of the whole congregation, gentle or simple, and many a bright
                        glance fell upon him admiringly, from eyes which had looked scorn at his
                        chrysalis condition; and not a few fair bosoms fluttered at the thought,
                        "what a fine, handsome, likely boy is Remmy Carroll, now that he is dressed
                        dacent." He was not the first man whose qualifications have remained
                        unacknowledged until such an accident as fine apparel has brought them into
                        notice.</p>
                     <p>Mary Mahony was at Chapel on that Sunday when Remmy Carroll shone out, like
                        the sun emerging from behind a rack of heavy clouds. A casual looker-on
                        might have fancied that she was one of the very few who did <emph>not</emph>
                        mind Remmy Carroll. Indeed, she rather hung down her head, as she passed
                        him,—but that might have been to hide the blushes which suffused her face
                        when she met his eye. Her father, a kind-hearted man, who had a cordial
                        salute for every friend, insisted that they should not hurry away without
                        speaking to the piper. Accordingly, they loitered until nearly all the
                        congregation had left the chapel, and, among the last, Remmy Carroll was
                        quietly stealing away. Bartle Mahony accosted him, with a hearty grasp of
                        the hand, and warmly thanked him for having saved Mary's life, adding, "It
                        is not until now I'd be waiting to thank you, man-alive, but Mary never let
                        me know the danger she'd been in, until this blessed morn, when her cousin,
                        Nancy Doyle, made me sensible of the ins and outs of the accident. But I
                           <emph>do</emph> thank you, Remmy, and 'twill go hard with me if I don't
                        find a better way of showing it than by words, which are only breath, as one
                        may say."</p>
                     <p>Then Bartle Mahony slapped Remmy on the back, in a familiar manner, and
                        insisted that he should walk home with them and take share of their dinner.
                        "Don't hang down your head like a girl, but tuck Mary under your arm, and
                        off to Carrigabrick, where I follow in less than no time, with the heartiest
                           of<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7173-00000048"/> welcomes. Don't dawdle there,
                        man-alive, like a goose, but walk off like a man."</p>
                     <p>So through the town of Fermoy did Mary Mahony walk with Remmy Carroll—down
                        Cork Hill and King-street, and across the Square, and along Artillery-quay,
                        and by Skelhorne's paper-mill, and Reid's flour-mill, and then, on the
                        Inches, by the Blackwater. History has not recorded whether Mary did
                        actually take Remmy's arm—but it is conjectured that he was too shy to offer
                        it, deeming <emph>that</emph> too great a liberty—but it is said that it was
                        she who took the field-route to Carrigabrick, and, though she blushed deeply
                        the while, she did not make any very violent objection to his taking her in
                        his arms across that chasm, the passage of which, on a former day, had so
                        nearly proved fatal to her. If I said that, while performing this pleasant
                        duty, Remmy Carroll did <emph>not</emph> press her to his heart, I am pretty
                        sure that no one would believe me. Well, then, there <emph>was</emph> this
                        gentle pressure, but of course Mary Mahony believed he could not help it.—Do
                        you think he could?</p>
                     <p>They proceeded to Carrigabrick, but the short cut through the fields proved
                        the longest way round on this occasion. Bartle Mahony had reached the house
                        fully half an hour before they did, and yet he had gone by the road, which,
                        as every one knows, is nearly a mile round. They had exchanged few words
                        during their walk; it was not quite the lady's place to make conversation,
                        and Remmy's thoughts were all too deep for utterance. In the earlier stage
                        of love, passion is contemplative, and silence often has an eloquence of its
                        own.</p>
                     <p>Remmy Carroll had the good fortune to win the particular favor of Mr. Bartle
                        Mahony, who, as he was retiring to rest, kissed his fair child, as usual,
                        and emphatically declared that Remmy Carroll was "a real decent fellow, and
                        no humbug about him." He added, that as he had found his way to their
                        hearth, he must be a stranger no more. And it came to pass, thenceforth,
                        somehow or other, that Remmy paid a visit to Carrigabrick twice or thrice a
                        week. These visits were ostensibly to Mr. Mahony, but it usually happened
                        that Remmy had also a glimpse of Mary, and sometimes a word or two with her.
                        It came to pass that Bartle Mahony, at length, fancied that a dull day in
                        which he did not see his friend Remmy. Finally, as by a great effort of
                        ingenuity, and in order to have a legitimate excuse for having his favorite
                        frequently with him, Bartle Mahony announced his sovereign will and pleasure
                        that Mary should learn music. Accordingly, when Remmy next came, he
                        communicated this intention to him in a very dignified manner, and appointed
                        Remmy forthwith to commence instructing her. But Remmy could play only upon
                        one instrument, and the pipes happen to be so unfeminine, that he ventured
                        to doubt whether the young lady would quite<pb n="96-97"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000049"/> approve of the proposition. Having hinted
                        this difficulty to Bartle Mahony, that worthy was impressed with its force,
                        but, rather than relinquish his project, declared that, all things
                        considered, he thought it best that he himself should be the musical
                        tyro.</p>
                     <p>If the truth were known, it would have appeared that the poor man had no
                        desire to learn, and certainly no taste. But as Remmy Carroll, proud as he
                        was poor, had peremptorily refused the money offered as a substantial mark
                        of gratitude for having saved Mary Mahony's life, this was her father's
                        indirect and rather clumsy mode of rewarding him. Very magnificent were the
                        terms which he insisted on making with the piper: he could have been taught
                        flute, harp, violin, psaltery, sackbut, and piano at less cost. Very little
                        progress did the kind old man make, but he laughed soonest and loudest at
                        his own dulness and discords. However, if the pupil did not make good use of
                        his time, the teacher did. Before the end of the first quarter, Mary Mahony
                        had half confessed to her own heart with what aptitude she had involuntarily
                        taken lessons in the art of love.</p>
                     <p>It would make a much longer story than I have the conscience to inflict upon
                        you, to tell how Mary Mahony came to fall in love with Remmy Carroll—for
                        fall in love she certainly did. Perhaps it was out of gratitude. Perhaps it
                        might have been his fine person and handsome face. Perhaps, because she
                        heard every girl of her acquaintance praise him. Perhaps, because he was her
                        father's favorite. Perhaps, because they were so constantly thrown together,
                        and he was the only young man with whom she frequently associated. Perhaps
                        she loved him, because she could not help it. Why strive to find a reason
                        for woman's love? It is like a mighty river springing up one knows not
                        where—augmented one knows not how—ever sweeping onward, sometimes smoothly,
                        sometimes in awful rapids, and bearing on its deep and constant current,
                        amid weeds and flowers, rocks and sands, many a precious freight of hope and
                        heart, of life and love.</p>
                     <p>Fathers and husbands are so proverbially the very last to see the progress
                        which Love clandestinely makes under their roof, that it will not be
                        considered a special miracle, if Bartle Mahony noticed nothing of the game
                        which was in hand—hearts being trumps! Mary's merry cousin, Nancy Doyle,
                        quietly smiled at the flirtation, as "fine fun," but did not seriously see
                        why it should not end in a wedding, as Mary had fortune enough for both.</p>
                     <p>Winter passed away, and Spring waved her flag of emerald over the rejoicing
                        world. Mary Mahony was walking in one of her father's meadows, for Remmy
                        Carroll was expected, and he was now—though she blushed with a soft
                        consciousness—the very pole-star of her constant thought. He came<pb
                           n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7173-00000050"/> up, and was welcomed with as sweet
                        a smile as ever scattered sunshine over the human heart. They walked side by
                        side for a little time, and then, when the continued silence became awkward,
                        Remmy stated, for the maiden's information, what she knew very well before,
                        that it was very fine weather.</p>
                     <p>"True for you, Remmy," answered she: "see how beautiful everything looks.
                        The sunbeams fall upon the meadow in a soft shower of light, and make the
                        very grass look glad."</p>
                     <p>"It <emph>is</emph> beautiful," said Remmy, with a sigh, "but I have too
                        heavy a heart to look upon these things as you do."</p>
                     <p>"Surely," inquired Mary, "surely you've no real cause to say that? Have you
                        heard any bad news?"</p>
                     <p>"No cause!" and here the pent-up feelings of his heart found utterance: "Is
                        it no cause?—Oh, Mary dear—for you <emph>are</emph> dear to me, and I may
                        say it now, for may be I may never be here to say it again—is it no cause to
                        have a heavy heart, when I have nobody in this wide world that I can speak
                        to about her that's the very life of my life, while I know that I am nothing
                        to her, but one that she sees to-day and will forget to-morrow? Is it no
                        cause, when I know that the little linnet that's now singing on that bough,
                        has as much chance of becoming an eagle, as I have of being thought lovingly
                        of by the one that I love? Haven't I cause to be of a heavy heart, knowing
                        that I would be regarded no more than that little bird, if I were to try and
                        fly beyond the state I'm in, when I know that I am not many removes from a
                        beggar, and have been for months dreaming away as if I was your equal? You
                        are kind and gentle, and when I am far away, perhaps you may think that I
                        would have tried to deserve you if I could, and then think well of one who
                        loves you better than he loves himself. Oh, Mary Mahony! may God's blessing
                        rest upon you, and keep you from ever knowing what it is to love without
                        hope."</p>
                     <p>Overcome by his emotion—aye, even to tears, which flowed down his comely
                        cheeks—poor Remmy suddenly stopped. Mary Mahony, surprised at the unexpected
                        but not quite unpleasing matter of his address, knew not, for a brief space,
                        what answer to make. But she was a woman—a young and loving one—so she let
                        her heart speak from its fulness.</p>
                     <p>"May-be," said she, with a blush, which made her look more beautiful than
                        ever,—"may-be, tis a foolish thing, Remmy, to love without hoping;" and she
                        looked at him with an expressive smile, which, unfortunately, he was unable
                        to distinguish through the tears which were now chasing each other down his
                        face, as round and nearly as large as rosary-beads.</p>
                     <p>"It's of no use," he said, not perceiving the nature of her words; "it's of
                        no use trying to banishy<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7173-00000051"/> you from
                        my mind. I've put a penance on myself for daring to think of you, and it's
                        all of no use. The more I try not to think, the more I find my thoughts upon
                        you. I try to forget you, and as I walk in the fields, by day, you come into
                        my mind, and when I sleep at night you come into my dreams. Wherever I am,
                        or whatever I do, you are beside me, with a kind, sweet smile. Every morning
                        of my life, I make a promise to my heart that I will never again come here
                        to look upon that smile, far too sweet and too kind for such as me, and yet
                        my steps turn towards you before the day is done. But it's all of no use. I
                        must quit the place altogether. I will go for a soldier, and if I am killed
                        in battle, as I hope I may be, they will find your name, Mary, written on my
                        heart."</p>
                     <p>To a maid who loved as well as Mary Mahony did, there was a touching pathos
                        in the simple earnestness of this confession;—aye, and eloquence, too, for
                        surely truth is the living spirit of eloquence. How long she might have been
                        inclined to play the coquette I cannot resolve, but the idea of her lover's
                        leaving her put all <foreign xml:lang="FRA">finesse</foreign> to flight, and
                        she said, in a low tone, which yet found an echo, and made a memory in his
                        heart: "Remmy! dear Remmy, you must not leave me. If you go, my heart goes
                        with you, for I like you, poor as you are, better than the richest lord in
                        the land, with his own weight of gold and jewels on his back."</p>
                     <p>What more she might have said puzzles conjecture—for these welcome words
                        were scarcely spoken, when all further speech was arrested by an ardent kiss
                        from Remmy. Oh! the first, fond kiss of mutual love! what is there of earth
                        with so much of the soft and gentle balm of heaven?</p>
                     <p>There they stood, by the ruins of that old castle, the world all forgot.
                        There they whispered, each to each, that deep passion with which they had so
                        long been heart-full. The maiden had gentle sighs and pleasant tears—but
                        these last, Remmy gallantly kissed away. Very wrong, no doubt, for her to
                        have permitted him to do so, and, in truth, she sometimes exhibited a shadow
                        of resistance. There was, in sooth, <q>

                              <l>"A world of whispers, mixed with low response,</l>

                     <p>"And you won't think the worse of me, Remmy, for being so foolish as to
                        confess how I love you?"</p>
                     <p>"Is it me, life of my heart? not unless you say that it was foolish to love

                     <p>"Ah, Mary, I see that you are joking now."</p>
                     <p>"And you won't go as a soldier?"</p>
                     <p>"Not I, darling; let those who have heavy hearts, and no hope, do that
                        same."</p>
                     <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7173-00000052"/>
                     <p>Much more was spoken, no doubt. Very tender confessions and confidences, in
                        truth, which I care not to repeat, for such are of the bright holidays of
                        youth and love, and scarcely bear to be reported as closely as an oration in
                        the Senate, or a lawyer's harangue at Nisi Prius, in a case of Breach of
                        Promise. Such tender confessions and confidences resemble those eastern
                        flowers which have a sweet perfume on the soil to which they are native, but
                        lose the fragrance if you remove them to another clime.</p>
                     <p>At last, with many a lingering "one word more," many a gentle pressure of
                        the hands, and several very decided symptoms, belonging to the genus "kiss,"
                        in the sweet botany of love, Mary and Remmy parted. Happy, sweetly and sadly
                        happy (for deep love is meditative, rather than joyful), Mary Mahony
                        returned home. She hastened to that apartment peculiarly called her own,
                        threw herself on the bed, and indulged in the luxury of tears, for it is not
                        Sorrow alone that seeks relief in tears,—they fall for hope fulfilled as
                        truly, though less often, as for hope deferred. Weep on, gentle girl, weep
                        in joy, while you can. Close at hand is the hour in which, ere you have done
                        more than taste it, the sparkling draught of happiness may be snatched from
                        your lips.</p>

                     <p>ALIKE delighted and surprised at thus finding Mary Mahony a sharer in the
                        emotions which so wildly filled his own heart, Remmy Carroll returned to
                        Fermoy, in that particular mood which is best denoted by the topsy-turvy
                        description—"he did not know whether he stood upon his head or his heels."
                        He rested until evening at a friend's, and was not unwilling to have some
                        hours of quiet thought before he again committed himself to commerce with
                        the busy world. About dusk, he started with his friend for a farmer's, on
                        the Rathcormac side of Corran Thierna, where there was to be a wedding that
                        night, at which Remmy and his pipes would be almost as indispensable as the
                        priest and the bridegroom.</p>
                     <p>As they were passing on the mountain's base, taking the soft path on the
                        turf, as more pleasant than the dusty highway, a little lower down, Remmy
                        suddenly stopped.</p>
                     <p>"There's music somewhere about here," said he, listening.</p>
                     <p>"May-be it's only a singing in your head," observed Pat Minahan. I've known
                        such things,<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7173-00000053"/> 'specially if one
                        had been taking a drop extra overnight."</p>
                     <p>"Hush!" said Remmy, "I hear it again as distinctly as ever I heard the sound
                        of my own pipes. There 'tis again: how it sinks and swells on the evening
                        breeze!"</p>
                     <p>Minahan paused and listened. "Sure enough, then, there is music in the air.
                        Oh, Remmy Carroll, 'tis you are the lucky boy, for this must be fairy music,
                        and 'tis said that whoever hears it first, as you did, is surely born to
                        good luck."</p>
                     <p>"Never mind the luck," said Remmy, with a laugh. "There's the fairy ring
                        above there, and I'll be bound that's the place it comes from. There's
                        fox-glove, you see, that makes night-caps for them; and there's heath-bells
                        that they have for drinking-cups; and there's sorrell that they have for
                        tables, when the mushrooms aren't in; and there's the green grass within the
                        ring, as smooth as your hand, and as soft as velvet, for 'tis worn down by
                        their little feet when they dance in the clear light of the full moon. I am
                        sure the music came from that fairy-ring."</p>
                     <p>"May-be it does," replied Minahan, "and may-be it doesn't. If you please,
                        I'd rather move on, than stand here like a pillar of salt, for 'tis getting
                        dark, and fairies aren't exactly the sort of people I'd like to meet in a
                        lonely place. 'T was somewhere about here, if I remember right, that Phil
                        Connor, the piper, had a trial of skill with the fairies, as to who'd play
                        best, and they turned him into stone, pipes and all. It happened, Remmy,
                        before your father came to these parts,—but, surely you heard of it before
                        now?"</p>
                     <p>"Not I," said Remmy; "and if I did, I wouldn't heed it."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, then," said his companion, with an ominous shake of the head at Remmy's
                        incredulity, "it's all as true as that you're alive and kicking at this
                        blessed moment. I heard my mother tell it when I was a boy, and she had the
                        whole of it from her aunt's cousin's son, who learned the ins and outs of
                        the story from a faymale friend of his, who had it on the very best
                        authority. Phil Connor was a piper, and a mighty fine player entirely. As he
                        was coming home from a wedding at Rathcormac, one fine moonshiny night, who
                        should come right forenenst him, on this very same mountain, but a whole
                        bundle of the fairies, singing, and skipping, and discoursing like any other
                        Christians. So, they up and axed him, in the civilest way they could, if
                        he'd favor them with a planxty on his pipes. Now, letting alone that Phil
                        was as brave as a lion, and would not mind facing even an angry woman, let
                        alone a batch of hop-o'-my-thumb fairies, he never had the heart to say no
                        when he was civilly axed to do anything.</p>
                     <p>"So Phil said he'd oblige them, with all the veins of his heart. With that,
                        he struck up that fine,<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7173-00000054"/> ancient
                        ould tune, 'The Fox-hunter's Jig.' And, to be sure and sartain, Phil was the
                        lad that could play:—no offence to you, Remmy, who are to the fore. The
                        moment the fairies heard it, they all began to caper, and danced here and
                        there, backward and forward, to and fro, just like the motes you see dancing
                        in the sunbeams, between you and the light. At last, Phil stopped, all of a
                        sudden, and they gathered round him, the craturs, and asked him why he did
                        not go on? And he told them that 'twas dying with the drought he was, and
                        that he must have something to wet his whistle:—which same is only fair,
                        particularly as far as pipers is concerned.</p>
                     <p>"'To be sure,' said a knowledgeable ould fairy, that seemed king of them
                        all, 'it's but reasonable the boy is; get a cup to comfort him, the dacent
                        gossoon.' So they handed Phil one of the fairy's fingers full of something
                        that had a mighty pleasant smell, and they filled a hare-bell cup of the
                        same for the king. 'Take it, me man,' said the ould fairy, 'there isn't a
                        headache in a hogshead of it. I warrant that a guager's rod has never come
                        near it. 'T was made in Araglyn, out of mountain barley,—none of your taxed
                        Parliament stuff, but real Queen's 'lixir.' Well, with that he drank to
                        Phil, and Phil raised the little dawny measure to his lips, and, though it
                        was not the size of a thimble, he drank at laste a pint of spirits from it,
                        and when he took it away from his lips, that I mightn't, if 'twasn't as full
                        as 'twas at first. Faith, it gave Phil the boldness of a lion, that it did,
                        and made him so that he'd do anything. And what was it the <hi rend="i"
                        />omadhaun did, but challenge the whole box and dice of the fairies to beat
                        him at playing the pipes. Some of them, which had tender hearts, advised him
                        not to try. But the more they tried to persuade him, the more he would not
                        be persuaded. So, as a wilful man must have his way, the fairies' piper came
                        forward, and took up the challenge. Phil and he played against each other
                        until the cock crew, when the lot all vanished into a cave, and whipped Phil
                        away with them. And, because they were downright mad, at last, that Phil
                        should play so much better than their own musicianer, they changed poor
                        Phil, out of spite, into a stone statute, which remains in the cave to this
                        very day. And that's what happened to Phil Connor and the fairies."</p>
                     <p>"You've made a pretty story of it," said Remmy; "it's only a pity it isn't
                        true."</p>
                     <p>"True!" responded Minahan, with tone and action of indignation. "What have
                        you to say again it? It's as true as Romilus and Ramus, or the Irish Rogues
                        and Rapparees, or the History of Reynard, the Fox, and Reynardine, his son,
                        or any other of the curious little books that people do be reading—that is,
                        them that <emph>can</emph> read, for diversion's sake, when they've got
                        nothing else to do. I suppose you'll be saying next, that fairies
                           themselves<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7173-00000055"/> ain't true? That I
                        mightn't, Remmy, but 'twouldn't much surprise me in the laste, to hear you
                        say, as Paddy Sheehy, the schoolmaster, says, that the earth is round, like
                        an orange, and that people do be walking on the other side of it, with their
                        heads downwards, and their feet opposite to our feet!"</p>
                     <p>"And if I did say so?" inquired Remmy, who—thanks to his schooling from the
                        redoubtable Tim Daly—happened to know more of the Antipodes than his
                        companion.</p>
                     <p>"Faith, Remmy, if you did say so, I know one that would misbelieve you, and
                        that's my own self. For it stands to reason, all the world to a Chany
                        orange, that if people was walking on the other side of the world, with
                        their feet upwards and their heads down, they'd be sure to fall off before
                        one could say 'Jack Robinson.'"</p>
                     <p>To such admirable reasoning as this, Remmy Carroll saw it would be quite
                        useless to reply, so he allowed Minahan to rejoice in the advantage, usually
                        claimed by a female disputant, of having "the last word."</p>
                     <p>They proceeded to the farmer's, Minahan, as they went along, volunteering a
                        variety of particulars relative to the Petrified Piper—indulging, indeed, in
                        such minuteness of detail, that it might have been taken for granted that he
                        had, personally, seen and heard the matters he described.</p>
                     <p>It is to be feared that Remmy Carroll was but a so-so listener. He had no
                        great faith in fairies, and his mind was just then preoccupied with thoughts
                        of his own darling Mary Mahony. At last, Minahan's conversation ended, for
                        they had reached the farmer's house, where Remmy and his pipes received the
                        very warmest of welcomes.</p>
                     <p>You need not fear that I have any intention of inflicting a description of
                        the marriage upon you. It is enough to say that the evening was one of
                        thorough enjoyment—Irish enjoyment, which is akin to a sort of mirthful
                        madness. Perhaps Remmy was the only person who did not thoroughly enter into
                        the <hi rend="i"/>estro of the hour, for though successful love may
                        intoxicate the mind, it subdues even the highest spirits, and embarrasses
                        while it delights. There is the joy at the success—the greater if it has
                        been unexpected—but this is a joy more concentrated than impulsive. Its seat
                        is deep within the heart, and there it luxuriates, but it does not breathe
                        its secret to the world,—it keeps its treasure all to itself, at first, a
                        thing to be thought of and exulted over privily. Love, when successful, has
                        a compelling power which subdues all other feelings. The causes which
                        commonly move a man, have little power when this master-passion fills the
                        breast.</p>
                     <p>In compliance with the custom at all wedding-feasts in Ireland, the company
                        freely partook of the national nectar (by mortals called whiskey-punch),<pb
                           n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7173-00000056"/> which was as plenty as tea at an
                        ancient maiden's evening entertainment, where sally-lun and scandal are
                        discussed together, and a verdict is given, at one and the same time, upon
                        character and Souchong. Remmy, of course, imbibed a fair allowance of that
                        resistless and potent mixture, the boast of which is, that "there is not a
                        headache in a hogshead of it." Blame him not. The apostle of Temperance had
                        not then commenced his charitable crusade. How could mortal man refuse the
                        draught, brewed as it specially had been for him by the blushing bride
                        herself, who, taking a dainty sup out of the horn which did duty for a
                        tumbler, had the tempting gallantry to leave a kiss behind—even as "rare Ben
                        Jonson" recommends. What marvel, if, when so many around him were rapidly
                        passing the Rubicon of the cup, Remmy should have taken his allowance like
                        "a man and a brother"—no, like a man and a piper,—particularly, when it is
                        remembered that Love, as well as Grief, is proverbially thirsty. Still,
                        Remmy Carroll had not exceeded the limits of sobriety. He had drank, but not
                        to excess—for his failing was not in that wise. And even if he had partaken
                        too freely of the charmed cup, it is doubtful whether, with strong passion
                        and excited feeling making a secret under-current in his mind on that
                        evening, any quantity of liquor could have sensibly affected him. There are
                        occasions when the emotions of the heart are so powerful as to render it
                        almost impossible for a man, even if he desired it, thus to steep his senses
                        in forgetfulness.</p>
                     <p>Remmy, therefore, was not "the worse for liquor"—although he certainly had
                        not refrained from it. Minahan, on the other hand, who was quite a seasoned
                        vessel, most buoyant in the ocean of free-drinking, and to whom a skinful of
                        strong liquor was quite a god-send, had speedily and easily contrived to get
                        into that pleasant state commonly called "half-seas-over,"—that is, he was
                        not actually tipsy, but merry and agreeable; and as he insisted on returning
                        to Fermoy, though he was offered a bed in the barn, the trouble of escorting
                        him devolved on Remmy.</p>
                     <p>They left the house together, lovingly linked arm-in-arm, for Minahan then
                        had a tendency to zig-zag movements. The next day, Minahan was found lying
                        fast asleep, with a huge stone for his pillow, near the footpath, at the
                        base of Corran Thierna. It was noticed by one of those who discovered him,
                        that his feet were within the fairy-ring which Remmy had observed on the
                        preceding evening. But of Remmy himself there was no trace. If the earth had
                        swallowed him up, he could not have vanished more completely. His pipes were
                        found on the ground, near Minahan, and this was all that remained of one
                        who, so often and well, had waked their soul of song.</p>
                     <p>The whole district became alarmed; for, independent<pb n="112-113"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000057"/> dent of regret and wonder, on account of
                        Remmy's personal popularity, a serious thing in a country district is the
                        loss of its only Piper. At length, Father Tom Barry, the parish priest of
                        Fermoy, thought it only his duty to pay a domiciliary visit to Minahan, to
                        come at the real facts of the case, and solve what was felt to be "a most
                        mysterious mystery."</p>
                     <p>Minahan was found in bed. Grief for the sudden loss of his friend had preyed
                        so heavily upon his sensitive mind, that, ever since that fatal night, he
                        had been drowning sorrow—in whiskey. It was now the third day since Remmy
                        Carroll's disappearance; and when Father Tom entered the house, he found
                        Minahan sleeping off the combined effects of affliction and <hi rend="i"
                        />potheen. He was awakened as soon as could be, and his first exclamation
                        was, "Oh, them fairies! them thieves of fairies!" It was some time before he
                        could comprehend the cause of Father Tom's visit, but even when he did, his
                        words still were, "Oh, them fairies! them thieves of fairies! they beat
                        Bannagher, and Bannagher beats the world!"</p>
                     <p>A growl from the priest, which, from lay lips, might have been mistaken for
                        an execration, awoke Minahan to his senses—not that he was ever troubled
                        with a superfluity of them. He testily declared his inability to tell his
                        story, except upon conditions. "My memory," said he, "is just like an
                        eel-skin, your Reverence. It don't stretch or become properly limber until
                        'tis wetted." On this hint, Father Tom sent for a supply of Tommy
                           Walker;<ref rend="super" target="#note_005" xml:id="return_005">*</ref>
                        and after summarily dispatching a noggin of it, Minahan thus spoke:—</p>

                     <p>"'T was Remmy and myself, your Reverence, that was meandering home together,
                        when, as bad luck would have it, nothing would do me, being
                        pretty-well-I-thank-you at that same time, but I must make a commencement of
                        discourse with Remmy about the fairy people: for, your worship, I'd been
                        telling him before, as we went to the wedding of Phil Connor, who was
                        transmographied into a stone statute. Well and good, just as Remmy came
                        right forenent the fairy-ring, says he, ''Faith, I would not object myself
                        to have a lilt with them!' No sooner had he said the words, your honor, than
                        up came the sweet music that we heard the night before, and with that a
                        thousand lights suddenly glanced up from the fairy-ring, just as if 'twas
                           an<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7173-00000058"/> illumination for some great
                        victory. Then, the music playing all the while, myself and Remmy set our
                        good-looking ears to listen, and, quick as I'd swallow this glass of
                        whiskey—here's a good health to your Reverence!—a thousand dawny creatures
                        started up and began dancing jigs, as if there was quicksilver in their
                        heels. There they went, hither and thither, to and fro, far and near,
                        coursing about in all manner of ways, and making the earth tremble beneath
                        'em, with the dint of their quickness. At last, your Reverence, one of them
                        came out of the ring, making a leg and a bow as genteel as ould Lynch, the
                        dancing-master, and said, 'Mister Carroll,' says he, 'if you'd please to be
                        agreeable, 'tis we'd like to foot it to your pipes (and you should have seen
                        the soothering wink the villain gave as he said the words), 'for,' says he,
                        ''tis ourselves have often heard tell of your beautiful playing.' Then the
                        weeny little mite of a fairy fixed his little eyes upon Remmy, and, that I
                        mightn't, if they did not shine in his head like two coals of red fire, or a
                        cat's eye under a blanket!</p>
                     <p>"'I'm no player for the likes of ye,' says Remmy, modest-like. But they'd
                        take no excuse, and they all, gathered around him, and what with sootherin'
                        words, and bright looks, and little pushes, they complately put their <hi
                           rend="i"/>comehether upon him, and coaxed him to play for them, and then,
                        the cajoling creatures! they fixed a big stone for a sate, and he struck up
                           <hi rend="i"/>Garryowen, sharp and quick, like shot through a holly-bush.
                        Then they all set to at the dancing, like the blessed Saint Vitus and his
                        cousins, and surely it was a beautiful sight to look at. The dawny creatures
                        worn't much bigger than your middle finger, and all nately dressed in green
                        clothes, with silk stockings and pumps, and three-cocked hats upon their
                        heads, and powdered wigs, and silk sashes across their breasts, and swords
                        by their sides about the size of a broken needle. 'Faith, 'twas beautiful
                        they footed it away, and remarkable they looked.</p>
                     <p>"Well, your honor, <emph>he</emph> was playing away like mad, and they were
                        all capering about, male and faymale, young and old, just like the French
                        who eat so many frogs that they do ever and always be dancing, when one of
                        the faymale fairies come up to Remmy's elbow, and said, in a voice that was
                        sweeter than any music, 'May-be, Mister Carroll, you'd be dry?' Then Remmy
                        looked at her a moment, till the faymale fairy hung down her head, quite
                        modest. 'Well,' says Remmy, 'you <emph>are</emph> a nice little creature,
                        and no words about it!' She looked up at him, and her cheeks got as red as a
                        field-poppy, with delight at Remmy's praising her;—for faymales, your
                        Reverence, is faymales all the world over, and a little blarney goes a great
                        way with them, and makes them go on as smoothly as a hall-door upon
                        well-oiled hinges. Then, she asked him again if he did not feel dry, and
                        Remmy said he'd been to a wedding, and wasn't<pb n="116-117"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000059"/> dry in particular, but he'd just like to
                        drink a good husband to her, and soon, and many of them. So, she laughed,
                        and blushed again, and handed him a little morsel of a glass full of
                        something that, I'll be bound for it, was stronger, any how, than holy
                        water. She kissed the little glass as he took it, and he drank away, and
                        when he was handing her back the glass, his eyes danced in his head again,
                        there was so much fire in them. So, thinking that some of the same cordial
                        would be good for my own complaint, I calls out to Remmy to leave a drop for
                        me. But, whoop! no sooner had I said the words, than, all of a sudden, the
                        whole tote of them vanished away, Remmy throwing me his pipes, by way of
                        keepsake, as he dashed down through the earth with the rest of them. I dare
                        say he did not want to be bothered with the pipes, knowing that in the place
                        he was going to he could use those that Phil Connor had taken down before.
                        And that's all that I know of it."</p>
                     <p>Here Minahan, overpowered with grief and the fatigue of speaking,
                        perpetrated a deep sigh and a deeper draught, which exhausted the remnant of
                        the whiskey.</p>
                     <p>"But, Minahan," said Father Barry, "you certainly don't mean to pass off
                        this wild story for fact."</p>
                     <p>"But I <emph>do,</emph> your Reverence," said Minahan, rather testily. "Sure
                        none but myself was to the fore, and it only stands to reason that as one
                        piper wasn't enough for the fairies, they seduced Remmy Carroll away, bad
                        cess to 'em for that same. And, indeed, your worship, I dreamed that I saw
                        him last night, made up into a stone statute, like poor Phil Connor; and
                        sure there's great truth in dreams, entirely."</p>
                     <p>Father Barry, of course, did not believe one word of this extraordinary
                        story, but his parishioners did, and therefore he eschewed the heresy of
                        publicly doubting it. He contented himself with shaking his head, somewhat
                        after the grave fashion of a Chinese Mandarin in a grocer's window, whenever
                        this subject was alluded to, and this Burleigh indication, as well as his
                        silence, obtained for him an immense reputation for wisdom.</p>
                     <p>There was one of his congregation who shared, to the full, the good priest's
                        disbelief of Minahan's "tough yarn" about the fairies. This was Mary Mahony,
                        who was convinced, whatever had befallen Remmy,—and her fears anticipated
                        even the worst,—that he had not fallen into the hands of the fairies.
                        Indeed, she was bold enough to doubt whether there were such beings as
                        fairies. These doubts, however, she kept to herself. Poor thing! silently
                        but sadly did she miss her lover. She said not one word to any one of what
                        had passed between them on the memorable day of his disappearance. But that
                        her cheek grew pale, and that melancholy gently brooded in the deep quiet of
                        her eyes, and that her voice, always low, was now sad and soft as the
                           mournful<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7173-00000060"/> murmur of the widowed
                        cushat-dove, even vigilant observation could notice little difference in
                        her. Not a day passed without her father lamenting Remmy's absence, and when
                        he spoke approvingly of our vanished hero, tears would slowly gather in her
                        eyes, and her heart would swell with a sorrow all the deeper for
                        suppression. It was great consolation for her to find, now that he was gone,
                        how all lips praised the good qualities of Remmy Carroll. It is pleasant to
                        feel that one's love is not unworthily bestowed.</p>
                     <p>Meantime, the deportation of Remmy, by the fairies, became duly accredited
                        in Fermoy and its vicinity. If he had solely and wholly vanished, it might
                        have been attributed to what Horatio calls "a truant disposition;" but his
                        pipes were left behind him, circumstantial evidence of Minahan's narrative.
                        Mightily was this corroborated, a few months after, when Gerald Barry, the
                        priest's nephew, being out one day, coursing on Corran Thierna, discovered a
                        sort of cave, the entrance to which had been concealed by the huge rock
                        which lay close to the magic circle of the fairies! His terrier had run into
                        it, after a refractory rabbit, who would not wait to be caught, and, from
                        the length of his stay, it was conjectured that the cave must be of immense
                        extent. True it is, that no one harbored the audacious thought of examining
                        it; for what mortal <emph>could</emph> be so reckless as to venture into the
                        stronghold of the "good people,"—but the very fact of there being such a
                        cavity under the rock, dignified with the brevet-rank of a cavern, satisfied
                        the Fermoy folks that Remmy Carroll was within it, changed into a PETRIFIED
                        PIPER!</p>
                     <p>Some weeks later, Gerald Barry's dog again ran into the cave, and remained
                        there until the young man, unwilling to lose a capital terrier, dug him out
                        with his own hands; for neither love nor money could tempt any one else to
                        do such a fool-hardy exploit. He declared that the mysterious cave was no
                        cave, but only an old rabbit-burrow! All the old women, in and out of
                        petticoats, unanimously announced that it was clear ("as mud in a
                        wineglass," no doubt), that the cave <emph>had</emph> been there, but that
                        the fairies had changed the whole aspect of the place, to prevent the
                        discovery of their petrified victims; for, argued they, if they could make
                        men into marble statues, they certainly must possess the minor power of
                        making a cave look as insignificant as a rabbit-burrow. Logic, such as this,
                        was sufficient to settle the mooted point, and then it became a moral and
                        physical certainty, in the Fermoy world, that Phil Connor and Remmy Carroll
                        were petrified inmates of the mountain cavern!</p>
                     <p>When, some eighteen months after this, it was Gerald Barry's ill-fortune to
                        break his collar-bone by a fall from his horse, in a steeple-chase, there
                        arose a general conviction, in the minds of all they<pb n="120-121"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000061"/> Fermoy believers in fairy-lore, that
                           <emph>this</emph> was a punishment inflicted upon him by "the good
                        people," for his impertinent intrusion into their peculiar haunts.</p>

                     <p>SLOWLY, but surely, does the tide of Time carry year after year into the
                        eternity of the Past. As wave chases wave to the shore, on which it
                        breaks—sometimes in a gentle and diffusing ripple, sometimes into feathery
                        foam, if it strike against a rock—so does year chase year away into the
                        memory of what has been. It is the same with empires and villages, with the
                        crowded haunts of men, and the humble huts wherein the poor do vegetate. For
                        each and for all, Time sweeps on; carrying on its tide, amid many things of
                        little value, some with which are linked sweet and tender associations. To

                        with what <emph>is!</emph> How mournful the retrospect, in the generality of
                        cases! Hopes fondly cherished, alleviating the actual pains of life by the
                        promise of an ideal improvement; day-dreams indulged in, until they become
                        fixed upon the mind, as if they were realities; resolutions made, which the
                        heart found it impossible to carry into practice; sunny friendships in full
                        luxuriance, which a few hasty words, too quickly taken up, were to throw
                        into shade, at once and forever; love itself, which promised so much in its
                        glorious spring, grown cold<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7173-00000062"/> and
                        careless. Talk of the changes of a year!—look back, and recollect what even
                        a single day has given birth to; but, think not that there is always change,
                        or that all changes are for the worst. Sometimes the bright hopes will have
                        the glad fulfilment; the day-dreams, after passing through the ordeal of
                        expectation, which, when deferred, maketh the heart sick, will be happily
                        realized; the friendship on which we relied will have gone through the
                        trial, and have stood the test; the love will have proved itself all that
                        the heart had ventured to anticipate, and have thrown upon the realities of
                        life, an enduring charm, mingling strength and softness, including in its
                        magic circle, endurance as strong as adamant, and tenderness which subdues
                        even while it sustains. Aye, life has its lights and shadows; and, in the
                        circling course of time and circumstance, the shadow of to-day glides gently
                        on, until it be lost in the sunshine of the morrow.</p>
                     <p>Let us return to our story. Imagine, if you please, that six years have
                        passed by since the mysterious and unforgotten disappearance of Remmy
                        Carroll, our very humble hero. Many changes have taken place, locally and
                        generally. Fermoy, rapidly rising into opulence, as the greatest military
                        depôt in Ireland, still kept a memory of Remmy Carroll. Death had laid his
                        icy hand upon Mr. Bartle Mahony, whose fair daughter, Mary, had succeeded to
                        his well-stocked farm and his prudent accumulations, which, joined with her
                        own possessions, made her comparatively wealthy. But, in her, and in such as
                        her, who derive their nobility from God, fortune could make no change—except
                        by enlarging the sphere of her active virtues. In a very humble and
                        unostentatious way, Mary Mahony was the Lady Bountiful of the place. The
                        blessings of the poor were hers. Wherever distress was to be relieved—and
                        Heaven knows that the mournful instances were not a few—there did the quiet
                        bounty of Mary Mahony flow, scattering blessings around by that gentle
                        personal expression of feeling and sympathy, which the highly imaginative
                        and excitable Irish prize far more than the most liberal dole which mere
                        Wealth can haughtily bestow. Oh, that those who give, could know, or would
                        pause to think, how much rests on the manner of giving! Any hand can
                        dispense the mere <foreign xml:lang="FRA">largesse,</foreign> which is
                        called "Charity," but the voice, the glance, the touch of hearted kindness
                        soothes the mental pangs of the afflicted. In Ireland, where there are
                        countless calls upon benevolence, casual relief has been demanded as a sort
                        of <emph>right;</emph> but a kind word, a gentle tone, a sympathizing look,
                        makes the gift of double value. And where was there ever kindness and
                        gentleness to equal those exercised by Mary Mahony? She had had her own
                        experiences in sorrow, and was, therefore, well qualified to yield to others
                        that touching sympathy which most forcibly awakens gratitude. She had
                        suffered, and, therefore, she sympathized.</p>

                     <p>Her beauty remained undimmed, but its character was somewhat changed. If
                        there was less of the fire of earlier days, there was more of intellectual
                        expression, the growth at once of her mind's development into maturity, and
                        of the sorrows which had chastened her, as well as of the circumstances
                        which had thrown her thoughts into contemplation. At her age—she was barely
                        three-and-twenty—it appears absurd to talk of her loveliness having had its
                        peach-like bloom impaired. As Wordsworth says, <q>

                     </p>
                     <p>At first, after her father's death, when it was known in what a prosperous
                        state she had been left (and rumor, as usual, greatly exaggerated the fact),
                        she had been pestered with the addresses of various persons who would have
                        been happy to obtain a fair bride with her goodly heritage, but it was soon
                        found that she was not matrimonially inclined, so, by degrees, they left her
                        "maiden meditation fancy-free." Among her suitors were a few who really were
                        not influenced by interested motives, and sought to win her, out of their
                        admiration for herself. Gently, but decidedly, they were repulsed, and many
                        of them, who were much above her in wealth and station, were proud to be
                        reckoned among her warm friends at a later period. It seemed as if she could
                        not have made an enemy—as if she could not awaken unkind feelings in any
                        mind. Even scandal never once thought of inventing stories about
                        her,—goodness and innocence were around her, like a panoply.</p>
                     <p>Mary Mahony remained true to the cherished passion of her youth. It flowed
                        on, a silent and deep stream. None knew what she felt. None were aware of
                        the arrow in her heart, and her pain was the intenser for its concealment.
                        So wholly unsuspected was her secret, that when, immediately after her
                        father's death, she received Remmy Carroll's bedridden relative as an inmate
                        at her own residence, people only admired the charity which had led her to
                        succour the helpless. No one appeared to think, for they did not know, that
                        Remmy could ever have awakened an interest in her heart.</p>
                     <p>The destinies of Europe had been adjusted. The Imperial Eagle of France had
                        been struck down at Waterloo, when Napoleon and Wellington had met<pb
                           n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7173-00000064"/> and battled. After peace had been
                        proclaimed, the Ministry of the day proceeded to reduce the war
                        establishment, by disbanding the second battalions of many regiments. The
                        result was that some thousands of ex-soldiers wended home. Very many of them
                        were from Ireland, and came back mere wrecks of manhood—for the casualties
                        of battle, and the certainties of sharp hospital practice, are only too
                        successful in removing such superfluities as arms and legs.</p>
                     <p>In the spring of 1816, two or three persons might have been seen walking
                        down the main street of Fermoy. If there could have existed any doubt as to
                        what they <emph>had</emph> been, their measured walk and martial bearing
                        would have promptly removed it. They, indeed, were disabled soldiers. The
                        youngest might have numbered some eight-and-twenty years, and, though he was
                           <emph>minus</emph> his left arm, few men could be found whose personal
                        appearance was superior to his own.</p>
                     <p>They passed on, unnoticed, as any other strangers might have passed on, and
                        found "choicest welcome" in a hostelrie, "for the accommodation of man and
                        beast," at the lower end of the town. What creature-comforts they there
                        partook of I am unable to enumerate, for the bill of fare, if such a
                        document ever existed in that neat but humble inn, has not been preserved.
                        The sun had nearly gone down, however, before any of the peripatetic trio
                        manifested any inclination towards locomotion. At last, he, to whom I have
                        more particularly drawn attention, told his companions that he had some
                        business in the town—some inquiries to make—and would rejoin them in an hour
                        or two at the latest. He might as well have spoken to the wind, for they had
                        walked that day from Cork (a trifle of some eighteen Irish miles), and were
                        already fast asleep on the benches. Their companion wrapped himself up in a
                        large military cloak, lined with fur—whilom, in Russia, it had covered the
                        iron-bound shoulders of a captain in Napoleon's Old Guard. This completely
                        concealed his figure, and drawing his hat over his face, so as to shade his
                        features, he sallied forth, like Don Quixote, in search of adventures.</p>
                     <p>When he reached the Sessions House, at the extremity of the town, instead of
                        pursuing the high road which leads to Lismore, he deviated to the extreme
                        left, crossed the meadow-bound by the paper-mill, and found himself on the
                        Inch, by that rapid branch of the Blackwater which has been diverted from
                        the main current for the use of the two mills—illegally diverted, I think,
                        for it renders the natural course of the river a mere shallow, and prevents
                        a navigation which might be carried on with success and profit, from Fermoy,
                        by Lismore, down to the sea at Youghall.</p>
                     <p>Rapidly pressing forward, the Stranger soon came to the chasm which has
                        already been mentioned as that from which, some years since, Remmy
                           Carroll,<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7173-00000065"/> the piper, had
                        rescued Mary Mahony from drowning. He threw himself, at listless length, on
                        the sward by the gurgling stream, and gazed, in silence, on the fair scene
                        before him.</p>
                     <p>It was, indeed, a scene to delight the eye and charm the mind of any
                        beholder. Across the broad river were the rocks of Rathhely, clothed here
                        and there with larches and pines, those pleasant evergreens—before him swept
                        the deep and rapid waters—and, a little lower down, like a stately sentinel
                        over the fine country around, rose the tall and precipitous rock, on which
                        stood the ruins, proud in their very decay, of the ancient castle of
                        Carrigabrick,—one of the round, lofty, lonely towers, whose origin and use
                        have puzzled so many antiquaries, from Ledwich and Vallancey, to Henry
                        O'Brien and Thomas Moore, George Petrie and Sir William Betham.</p>
                     <p>With an eager and yet a saddened spirit, the stranger gazed intently and
                        anxiously upon the scene, varied as it is picturesque, his mind drinking in
                        its quiet beauty—a scene upon which, in years long since departed, my own
                        boyhood loved to look. And now, in the softened effulgence of the setting
                        sun, and the silence of the hour, the place looked more like the embodiment
                        of a poet's dream, or a painter's glorious imagining, than anything
                        belonging to this every-day world of hard and cold reality.</p>
                     <p>The Stranger gazed upon the scene silently for a time, but his feelings
                        might thus be embodied in words:—"It <emph>is</emph> beautiful, and it is
                        the same; only, until I saw other places, praised for their beauty, I did
                        not know how beautiful were the dark river, and the quiet meadows, and the
                        ivy-covered rock, and the gray ruin. Change has heavily passed over myself,
                        but has lightly touched the fair Nature around me. Heaven knows whether
                           <emph>she</emph> may not be changed also. I would rather be dead than
                        hear she was another's. The lips that my lips have kissed—the eyes that my
                        eyes have looked into—the hand that my hand has pressed—the form that my
                        arms have folded; that another should call them his—the very thought of it
                        almost maddens me. Or, she may be dead? I have not had the heart to inquire.
                        This suspense is the worst of all,—let me end it."</p>
                     <p>Thus he thought—perhaps the thoughts may have unconsciously shaped
                        themselves into words: but soliloquies may be thought as well as uttered
                        audibly. He rose from the damp sward, sprang across the chasm, proceeded
                        rapidly on, and in ten minutes was sitting on the stile, by which, in other
                        days, he had often parted from Mary Mahony—for, by this time, my readers
                        must have recognized Remmy Carroll in the Stranger.</p>
                     <p>How long he rested here, or with what anxious feelings he gazed upon the
                        house, just visible through the trees, I am not able to state,—but I can
                        easily imagine what a contention of hope and fear<pb n="130-131"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000066"/> there must have been in his heart. The
                        apprehension of evil, however, was in the ascendant, for, though two or
                        three half-familiar faces passed him, he could not summon courage to ask
                        after Mary and her father. At last, he determined to make full inquiries
                        from the next person he saw.</p>
                     <p>The opportunity was speedily afforded. A female appeared, slowly advancing
                        up the path. Could it indeed be herself? She came nearer. One glance, and he
                        recognized her, the star of his spirit—bright, beaming, and as beautiful as
                        Memory and Fancy (the dove-winged ministers of Love) had delighted to paint
                        her, amid the darkness and perils of the Past.</p>
                     <p>He sprang forward to meet her. There was no recognition upon her part. Nor
                        was this very wonderful—though the lover of romance might expect, as a
                        matter of course, that, from pure sympathy, the maiden should have instantly
                        known who was before her. Years, which had passed so gently over her,
                        softening and mellowing her beauty, had bronzed his face, and almost changed
                        its very expression. The dark moustache and thick whiskers, which he now
                        wore, his altered appearance, his military bearing,—all combined to make him
                        very different from the rustic, however comely, whom she had last seen six
                        years before.</p>
                     <p>Seeing a stranger advance towards her, Mary paused. He accosted her, with an
                        inquiry whether Mr. Bartle Mahony was to be seen?</p>
                     <p>"He is dead," said she. "He has been dead nearly six years."</p>
                     <p>Carroll started back, for the unwelcome news chilled him, and the
                        well-remembered tones struck some of the most responsive chords of his
                        heart.</p>
                     <p>"I am grieved to hear of his death. I knew him once. He was kind to me in
                        former days, when kindness was of value, and I came to thank him now. God's
                        blessing on his soul! He was a good man." There was a slight pause, and he
                        resumed, "Perhaps you can tell me, young lady, whether his daughter is
                        alive, and where she may be seen? The trifles which I have brought from
                        foreign countries, to mark my recollection of his goodness to me, perhaps
                        she may accept?"</p>
                     <p>"You are speaking to her," said Mary.</p>
                     <p>"My little presents are in this parcel," said Remmy. "They are relics from
                        the field of battle. These silver-mounted pistols were given to me by a
                        French officer, whose life I saved,—this Cross of the Legion of Honor was
                        hastily plucked from the bosom of one of his dead comrades, after a fierce
                        charge at Waterloo. Take them:—I destined them for your father from the
                        moment they became mine."</p>
                     <p>He placed the parcel in her hand.—One question would bring hope or despair.
                        He feared to ask it. He drew closer, and, as composedly as he could,
                        whispered into her ear, "Are you married?"</p>
                     <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7173-00000067"/>
                     <p>The blood flushed up into Mary's face. She drew back, for his questioning
                        vexed her, and she wished to get rid of the inquisitive stranger. She handed
                        him back the parcel, and said, "I hope, sir, that you do not mean to annoy
                        or insult me? If you do, there are those within call who can soon release me
                        from your intrusion. I cannot retain the presents which a mere stranger
                        tells me were intended for my poor father.—And, if I must answer your last
                        question, I am <emph>not</emph> married."</p>
                     <p>"Thank God!" was Carroll's earnest and involuntary exclamation.</p>
                     <p>People may talk as they please of the quick-sightedness of love. Mary
                        certainly had little of it, for she did <emph>not</emph> recognize her
                        lover, and, turning round, prepared to return home. Carroll gently detained
                        her, by placing his hand upon her arm.</p>
                     <p>"I pray your pardon," said he, "but I may not have an opportunity of again
                        speaking to you, and I have a word to say about a person whom you once knew,
                        but have probably forgotten. There was a poor, worthless young man, named
                        Carroll, in this neighborhood a few years ago. He was a weak creature, fool
                        enough to love the very ground on which you trod, and vain enough to think
                        that you were not quite indifferent to him."</p>
                     <p>"I do not know," said Mary, with a flushed cheek, and flashing eyes, "why
                        you should continue to intrude your presence and your conversation when you
                        see that both are unpleasant to me. I do not know why you should ask me
                        questions which a sense of common decency would have avoided. If I answer
                        you now, it is that my silence may not appear to sanction imputations upon
                        one over whom, I fear, the grave has closed—whom, be he alive or dead, it
                        was no dishonor to have known and have regarded. I did know this Carroll
                        whom you name, but cannot imagine how you, a stranger, can have learnt that
                        I did. It was his misfortune to have been poor, but he never was worthless,
                        nor could have been."</p>
                     <p>"One word more," exclaimed Remmy, "but one more word. Remmy Carroll, so long
                        believed to have been dead, is alive and in health—after many sufferings he
                        returns home, poor as when he left it, rich in nothing but an honest name.
                        He comes back, a disabled soldier, and he dare not ask whether, beautiful
                        and wealthy as you are, you are the Mary Mahony of other years, and love him
                        still?"</p>
                     <p>Mary looked at him with intent anxiety. The color which emotion had sent
                        into her face paled, and then rushed back in a quickened life-tide, mantling
                        her very forehead. Even then she had not recognized her lover!</p>
                     <p>"If he be indeed returned," said she, in a voice so low that Remmy did not
                        know whether the words were addressed to him, or were the mere impulse of
                        her thought, involuntarily framed into utterance,<pb n="134-135"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000068"/> "and if he be the same in heart—the same
                        frank and honest mind—the same true and loving spirit—the same in his
                        contempt of all that is bad, and his reverence for whatever is good—his
                        poverty is nothing, for <emph>I</emph> have wealth; and if his health be
                        broken, I yet may soothe the pain I may not cure. Tell me," said she, and
                        the words came forth, this time, freely spoken, as if she had determined to
                        be satisfied and to act, "tell me, you who seem to know him, though your
                        description wrongs him, where has Remmy Carroll been during all these long
                        years? Why did he leave us? Why did he not write to relieve the anxiety of
                        those who cared for him? Where is he now?"</p>
                     <p>What was the response? Softly and suddenly an arm wound itself around that
                        graceful form, warmly and lovingly fell a shower of kisses on the coral
                        beauty of those luxuriant lips.</p>
                     <p>Was she not angry—fiercely indignant? Did not her outraged feelings manifest
                        their anger? Was not her maidenly modesty in arms at the liberty thus taken,
                        and by a stranger? <emph>This</emph> was the crowning misconduct—did she not
                        reprove it?</p>
                     <p>No! for, in tones which thrilled through her loving heart, Remmy Carroll
                        whispered "Mary!—my own, true, dear Mary!" In the struggle (for Mary
                           <emph>did</emph> struggle at first) which immediately preceded these
                        words, the large cloak and the hat fell off, and then she recognized the
                        forehead and the eyes— then she knew him whom she had loved so well, and
                        mourned so long—then she threw her arms around his neck, in the very
                        abandonment of affection and delight—then she clung close and yet closer to
                        him, as if they never more must part—then, remembering how she was yielding
                        to the warm impulses of her nature, she hid her burning face in his bosom,
                        and then, when he embraced her again and again, she could not find words to
                        protest against the gentle deed.</p>
                     <p>Then, arm in arm, they walked into the house, and there Remmy's aged
                        relative, whose condition and sufferings had been so much improved and
                        alleviated by the kindness and bounty of Mary Mahony—simply because she was
                        Remmy's relative—was made happy by the presence of him over whom she had
                        shed so many bitter tears. Perhaps her happiness was augmented by perceiving
                        on what excellent terms the heiress and he were—perhaps her eyes filled with
                        pleasant tears, when Mary Mahony whispered into her ear "Minny, he will stay
                        with us now, forever, and will never leave us." Perhaps, too, the whisper
                        was not unheard by Remmy—and it would be a difficult point to decide whether
                        or not it were intended to reach <emph>his</emph> ear, as well as Minny's.
                        And then, all that both had to learn. There was so much to be told on both
                        sides. All that Carroll cared to know was this—that he loved, and that his
                        love was warmly returned. A thousand times,<pb n="136-137"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000069"/> that evening, and forever, did Mary exclaim
                        against herself for not having recognized him immediately, and a thousand
                        times smilingly aver, that, from his changed appearance and studied efforts
                        at concealment, the recognition was all but impossible. And then they sat
                        together, hand clasped in hand, eyes looking into eyes, until an hour far
                        into the night, talking of old times and present happiness, and future
                        hopes. And they spoke, too, of the good old man who had passed away, in the
                        fulness of years, into the far and better land. Old memories were revived,
                        brightened by new hopes. Oh, how happy they were! it was the very luxury of
                        love—the concentrated spirit of passion, purified by suffering, and tried by
                        absence—the repayment, in one brief hour, for years of doubt, pain, and
                        sorrow.</p>
                     <p>At last came the time to part; but with it came the certainty of a speedy
                        meeting. The next day, and day after day, until that arrived when holiest
                        rites made them man and wife, Remmy Carroll was to be found by the side of
                        his beloved Mary Mahony; and soon, when the news of his return were noised
                        about, crowds came to see him, and far and near was spread the announcement
                        that a wedding was on the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tapis.</foreign> General
                        was the surprise—general, too, the satisfaction, for the young people were
                        universal favorites, and time and circumstances had removed the principal
                        objections which even the worldly-minded might have raised to the union of
                        Mr. Bartle Mahony's daughter and heiress to one who, a few years before, had
                        occupied a position in society so much beneath her. It was universally
                        conceded that, in every sense, the match was extremely suitable and proper;
                        but Remmy and Mary did not require popular opinion to sanctify their
                        attachment. They were all in all to each other.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be supposed that Mary Mahony was allowed to continue ignorant
                        of the vicissitudes through which Remmy Carroll had passed. He told his
                        story, and <q>
                           <l>"She gave him for his tale a world of sighs."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be expected that of this tale some notice be here given. But, in very
                        truth, those who look for a romantic elucidation of the mysterious
                        disappearance, and prolonged absence, and unexpected return of Remmy
                        Carroll, will be greatly disappointed. The main incidents were simple
                        enough, and here they are.</p>
                     <p>It may be remembered that Remmy had acted as escort to Minahan, on their
                        return from that wedding at which the Piper had made his last professional
                        appearance. He had found some difficulty in piloting his companion along the
                        high road from Rathcormac to Fermoy; and, indeed, when they reached the
                        mountain, Minahan, in a fit of drunken obstinacy, <emph>would</emph> throw
                        himself upon the heathy sward,<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7173-00000070"/>
                        where, in a few minutes, he was fast in the gentle bonds of sleep. Remmy
                        Carroll, having accompanied him so far, did not like to leave him, and sat
                        down beside him to watch for his awakening, with the purpose, also, of
                        seeing that he fell into no mischief. But, after a time, from the combined
                        influences of the fresh air, want of rest, and what he had partaken at the
                        wedding, Remmy found himself quite unable to keep his eyes open. He was
                        conscious that sleep was creeping over him, and so, taking off his pipes,
                        for fear that he might injure them by lying upon them, he carefully placed
                        them upon the grass, beside him, and resigned himself to slumber.</p>
                     <p>On awaking, he found—to his excessive amazement—that he was lying "on the
                        sunny side of a baggage-cart," with his head reposing on the lap of a
                        soldier's wife. In reply to his inquiries, he was recommended to take it
                        coolly, and, at any rate, not to make any noise until they reached Glanmire,
                        about four miles from Cork, to which city he was informed that he was bound.
                        When the cavalcade of baggage-carts and soldiers reached Glanmire, he was
                        summarily acquainted with the novel information that he had been duly
                        enlisted as a recruit, and his informant—a fierce-looking, hook-nosed,
                        loud-voiced martinet of a Sergeant—asked him to put his hand into his
                        pocket, and <emph>that</emph> would satisfy him that he had regularly and
                        irrevocably become attached to the military service of "his Most Gracious
                        Majesty King George the Third." Accordingly, Remmy did as he was desired,
                        and in the pocket as aforesaid found a bright shilling, which certainly had
                        not been there on the previous night—more particularly, as tenpenny pieces
                        were the current coin in Ireland at the period. To Remmy's possession of the
                        solitary shilling, among a little handful of tenpenny and fivepenny pieces
                        (the sum-total realized by his performance at the wedding), the modern
                        Sergeant Kite triumphantly appealed in proof that he had been regularly
                        enlisted. It is needless to observe that, of this transaction, Remmy
                        Carroll—albeit the person chiefly concerned—had not the slightest
                        recollection. He appealed to one of the officers, and was told that, if the
                        Sergeant said he was enlisted, there could be no doubt of the fact, and that
                        his Majesty was fortunate in having obtained such a promising recruit, as
                        the regiment was on the eve of embarkation. His remonstrances, and denials,
                        and appeals, were in vain. The significant hint was added, that death was
                        the punishment usually awarded for desertion. So, making a virtue of
                        necessity—the more so, as he perceived that he was so strongly and
                        suspiciously watched that flight would have been useless—he had no
                        alternative but to proceed to Cork with the regiment, as cheerfully as he
                        could, and, in despite of himself, as it were, was duly attested,
                        magistrates not being very particular in those days. To all his<pb
                           n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7173-00000071"/> assertions, that he had not the
                        slightest recollection of having been enlisted, the reply was that, if he
                        could procure a substitute, they did not require his company—but to do this
                        was impossible.</p>
                     <p>In a few days, the regiment embarked for the Peninsula, and his friend, the
                        Sergeant, told him on the voyage, as an excellent joke, in what manner they
                        had trepanned him—namely, that, as the regiment was passing by the mountain,
                        early in the morning, en route for embarkation, one of the officers who rode
                        above the highway (for the road is literally cut out of and into the hill)
                        had noticed Remmy and Minahan asleep, and had remarked what an admirable
                        soldier the former would make; Minahan, it seems, was thought nothing of,
                        being, like Othello, "declined into the vale of years." The remark was taken
                        as a hint, and Remmy was removed, even as he was, fast asleep, to one of the
                        baggage-carts, with the least possible delay. The details of the transaction
                        had been executed by the Sergeant, who chuckled over this narrative, piquing
                        himself not a little on the dexterity of the trick.</p>
                     <p>Carroll was unable to write to Mary Mahony, on account of what had befallen
                        him, being afraid of his letter falling into other hands than her own. He
                        did write to Minahan, in the hope that, in that circuitous way, Mary might
                        obtain a knowledge of his misadventure. The letter, if ever posted, never
                        came to hand, and thus, for more than six weary years, Mary Mahony in
                        particular, with the inhabitants of Fermoy in general, was profoundly
                        ignorant of Remmy's fate.</p>
                     <p>It was fortunate that Remmy was of that easy temperament which takes the
                        world as it finds it, readily accommodates itself to circumstances, and
                        wisely acts on the sensible aphorism, "what can't be cured must be endured."
                        While he bitterly lamented his enforced absence from the girl of his
                        heart—just at the crisis, too, when he learned that he occupied an enviable
                        position in her affections—he knew that all the regrets in the world would
                        not bring him one furlong nearer to her. He determined to make the best of
                        his situation. In a short time he even came to like it. Good conduct, good
                        temper, and his ability to read and write, soon recommended him to his
                        superiors, and obtained his promotion to the rank of Sergeant. In this
                        capacity, he contrived to save a sum of money, which, in former years, he
                        would have considered quite a treasure, and which, at any rate, was
                        sufficiently large as to warrant its possessor against the imputation of
                        fortune-hunting, should he return to Ireland, find Mary Mahony unmarried,
                        and pay his addresses to her.</p>
                     <p>When the short peace of 1814 was made, the regiment in which Remmy served
                        returned to England, and Remmy made application for his discharge, and would
                        have purchased it if he could not<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7173-00000072"/>
                        procure it by other means. But immediately came the renewal of war, by the
                        return of Napoleon from Elba, and Remmy's regiment was one of the first to
                        return to the Continent. In the battle of Waterloo, Remmy received a severe
                        wound in the left arm, which rendered amputation necessary, after prolonged
                        and painful sufferings. At length, he was able to return to England, with a
                        handsome gratuity for his wound, and a respectable pension, which, with what
                        he had already picked up "in the wars," really made him quite a man of
                        independent means. His plea of poverty had been only a <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">ruse</foreign> to try the strength of the maiden's
                        affection. But, in her eyes, of much greater value than his hoard or his
                        pension was a testimonial of courage and character given him by his Colonel,
                        and especially countersigned by the Duke of Wellington, who had personally
                        noticed his conduct during the six years he had been in the service. Great
                        pride, be sure, had Carroll in handing over this precious document to Mary
                        Mahony. Many tears did she shed over the vicissitudes which had earned
                        it—but tears <emph>will</emph> flow from bright eyes, when there is a
                        handsome lover at hand to kiss them off.</p>
                     <p>The wedding followed, in due course. <emph>Such</emph> a wedding! that of
                        Camacho was a fool to it. Mr. and Mrs. Carroll, it is true, violated the
                        usage of Irish society (of their rank of life) by quitting the farm, on a
                        honeymoon excursion, shortly after Father Barry had united them "for better,
                        for worse," as it was fully expected that, according to the immemorial
                        custom among the extensive class which embraces all ranks from the wealthy
                        farmer to the poor peasant, the bride and bridegroom should have presided at
                        the nuptial feast, opened the post-prandial festivities by leading off the
                        dance, and finally gone through the loosening the bride's garters, and be
                        followed by the ceremonial of her "throwing the stocking." But, except
                        during the performance of the nuptial service, the company at Carrigabrick
                        farm saw little, on that day of days, of either Remmy Carroll or his fair
                        and faithful helpmate. Enough, however, for the gay bachelors to admire the
                        beauty (now bright with happiness) of the bride, while the Waterloo medal
                        and the Waterloo wound of our hero won him favor in the eyes and from the
                        lips of all the womankind who were "on their promotion." Despite the speedy
                        flight of "the happy couple," the rites of hospitality were duly celebrated
                        in their homestead, and, indeed, a general holiday was kept in the
                        neighborhood. The warmth of Irish hearts had its effervescence on that
                        occasion, and it wished an infinity of joy to Remmy Carroll and his
                        bride.</p>
                     <p>About this time, Minahan's character for veracity fell into disrepute, it
                        being pretty clear that Remmy Carroll was anything but a petrifaction—at
                        least Mary Mahony's testimony would go a great way to disprove
                           <emph>that</emph> imputation. But there ever are people<pb n="144-145"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000073"/> ple who will manfully maintain the
                        superiority of the ideal over the real, and a few of these, vegetating at
                        Fermoy, used to shake their heads when Remmy Carroll walked by, and, having
                        said, all along, that, beyond all doubt, some supernatural agency had
                        removed our hero, think themselves somewhat aggrieved in the unromantic
                        commonplace explanation of his enforced absence. To the hour of his death,
                        Minahan was ready to say or swear that <emph>he</emph> had told no more than
                        the truth—or an equivalent for the truth—and was wont to appeal, when in his
                        cups (which was whenever he had anything to put into them), to Carroll's
                        good fortune in proof of the advantageous influence of fairy favor. He had a
                        few semi-converts—who believed that Remmy Carroll was as much petrified as
                        Phil Connor. Indeed, without any very remarkable development of the organ of
                        marvellousness, I think so too.</p>
                     <p>It but remains to add that, in due season, Mr. and Mrs. Carroll returned to
                        their farm. Remmy never more played the pipes save for his own amusement (as
                        the Marquis of Carrabas' cat caught mice), and he and his wife lived happily
                        together, after their many trials. One of their family is settled in the
                        State of New York, and doing well.</p>

                     <p>THE year 1822 was remarkable for being what in Ireland was called "A
                        Whiteboy Year." Rents were only paid by compulsion. Tithes were not paid at
                        all. Wages were low. The price of food was high. The middleman system had
                        been on the increase, year after year, until the land and people were
                        crushed under it. The priests from the altar, and O'Connell, from the
                        tribune and through the press, earnestly argued the masses <emph>not</emph>
                        to rebel, no matter how great the aggravation, how intense the despair, and
                        the advice had great weight in most instances. Many causes combined to
                        render the peasantry ripe for revolt.—As, on one side, there were not
                        wanting men able and willing to act as leaders in any popular movement; so,
                        on the other, there was no lack of Government spies to fan the flame, to
                        cajole the peasantry into breaches of the law, and to betray those whom they
                        thus had duped.</p>
                     <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7173-00000077"/>
                     <p>The discontented and disaffected were principally concentrated in my native
                        county of Limerick. From time to time, the military force in that county had
                        been augmented, until, at the particular period in question (1822), there
                        were several regiments of infantry, and at least one of cavalry, on
                        harassing duty. What between still-hunting (for the manufacture of
                        mountain-dew was then in full operation) and man-hunting, the military had
                        full occupation day and night. Various pretexts were used, also, to weary
                        the military, by putting them upon a false scent, every now and then, so
                        that the service was particularly severe and fatiguing. Added to the
                        military array was the Constabulary force, introduced by the late Sir Robert
                        (then Mr.) Peel, while Secretary for Ireland, the members of which, after
                        his name, have obtained the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sobriquet</foreign> of
                        "Peelers." An active and efficient body of men these Peelers were, and are,
                        although the force, from its original establishment, has been unpopular in
                        Ireland—probably owing to its very activity and efficiency. Be this as it
                        may, it is undeniable that while the bulk of the Irish people, of all
                        classes, cordially have fraternized with the soldiery, they have ever
                        manifested a strong dislike to the police. This unfriendly feeling, too, has
                        sometimes been fostered by many who, from their station, might be expected
                        to entertain gratitude, and exercise courtesy, towards these protectors of
                        their lives and property.</p>
                     <p>Whiteboyism continued to increase, notwithstanding the strong military and
                        police force poured into the district. Detachments of infantry were
                        quartered in almost every hamlet—the cavalry, called "here, there, and
                        everywhere," upon true and false alarms, were dreadfully overworked. At
                        last, as a necessary matter of protection, two or three Peelers were
                        quartered in almost every respectable country house in certain disturbed
                        baronies. The whole county was in a dreadful state of alarm, excitement, and
                        activity. The newspapers, of course, were filled with reports and rumors of
                        all kinds, and the Whiteboy doings in the South of Ireland had even the
                        honor of being spoken of, in no very complimentary terms, in both Houses of
                        Parliament.</p>
                     <p>These Whiteboy movements, although not confined to one part of the county
                        Limerick, were remarked as chiefly occurring on that side which is bordered
                        by the county Cork. In a little time, they might be said to radiate from a
                        particular district, spreading into what, from its extent, has been called
                        "The Yorkshire of Ireland." As they increased, more troops were called in,
                        to subdue insurrection and enforce order. All this was in vain. A regular
                        guerilla warfare began to prevail, chiefly for the purpose of obtaining the
                        arms of the military and police.</p>
                     <p>It became no uncommon event for a sentry, at a country station, to be
                        quietly picked out by the<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7173-00000078"/> steady
                        hand and sure aim of a Whiteboy—the shot which gave his death being at once
                        the sole announcement and fatal evidence of the tragic deed. The service
                        thus became so desperate that there arose an evident reluctance, on the part
                        of the military, to continue on such alarming and perilous duty. Desertions
                        became frequent. On the other hand, the police doggedly did their duty. Of a
                        much higher grade than the ordinary rank and file of the army—for no man was
                        allowed to enter or remain in the force without an excellent character and a
                        certain degree of education—they had a high estimate of their duty, and a
                        stubborn determination to perform it. They knew, also, that the peasantry
                        hated them, and that even the thankless gentry, whom they protected, did not
                        bear any affectionate regard for them.</p>
                     <p>The Rifle Brigade was on duty, in the disturbed district, at the time which
                        I have mentioned. The officer in command was Major Eeles, an English
                        port-drinking officer of the old school, who had fixed his own quarters at
                        The Grove (near Ballingarry,) formerly the seat of Colonel Odell, the member
                        for the county, and remarkable as being the father of about twenty sons, by
                        one wife. The most fatiguing and unpleasant office which the soldiers had to
                        perform was that of night-patrolling. The laws of that time were
                        harsh—indeed, like all other Coercion Acts, they had been expressly framed
                        to put down the disturbances—and provided that the mere fact of a man's
                        being found out of his house, between sunrise and sunset, should be
                        punishable with seven years' transportation. This severe enactment put a
                        great check, of course, upon nocturnal predatory gatherings, but many an
                        innocent man suffered from the harshness of the law. A strong feeling of
                        hostility arose against the Rifle corps, for their activity in apprehending
                        the suspected. This was greatly augmented by what, under any circumstances,
                        might be considered an "untoward event." One of the peasantry had been met
                        on the high road after dark, and challenged by the patrol. Not giving a
                        satisfactory answer, his instant apprehension was ordered by the officer in
                        command. Attempting to escape, he was in the act of jumping across a deep
                        drain which divided the high-road from the bog, when a sergeant drew a
                        pistol from his belt and shot him on the spot.</p>
                     <p>The unfortunate man was <emph>not</emph> a Whiteboy. On the contrary, he had
                        steadily resisted the solicitations of many neighbours who were. He had seen
                        better days, and had received rather a good education. Knowing the peril of
                        joining the illegal combinations, and daring the danger of being considered
                        lukewarm in what was called "the cause of his country," he had kept himself
                        aloof from proceedings, which he did not approve of, but scorned to betray.
                        His family had been subjected, for months<pb n="156-157"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000079"/> past, to the severe privations which poverty
                        causes everywhere, but particularly in Ireland. His wife had been extremely
                        ill, and on her sudden change for the worse, his affection had naturally got
                        the worse of his personal fear, and he had ventured out, after dusk, to
                        solicit the aid of the nearest dispensary doctor, when, challenged by the
                        military, he sought safety in flight, and had met with his untimely fate as
                        I have described.</p>
                     <p>Those who know anything of the peculiar customs of the South of Ireland,
                        must be aware that the peasantry have especial delight in doing honor to the
                        dead. To celebrate a "wake" is, with them, a social duty. They usually take
                        that mode of testifying, in a merry mood, their grief for the departed. The
                        unfortunate victim of military impetuosity was carried to the nearest
                        public-house on the way-side, and when it was related how he had lost his
                        life, "curses not loud, but deep," most unequivocally indicated the popular
                        feeling that he was a murdered man. Nor was this feeling mitigated by the
                        "justifiable homicide" verdict of the Coroner's jury.</p>
                     <p>Entertaining such opinions, it was not likely that his relatives and friends
                        would solicit as a favor, at the hands of his slayers, "leave to keep the
                        wake." They did not ask it. Perhaps they had little fear that, in the
                        present instance, their ancient and time-honoured custom would be interfered
                        with. Accordingly, they <emph>took</emph> leave, and a numerous concourse of
                        the people assembled, after dusk, on the day of the inquest, in the cabin of
                        the deceased.</p>
                     <p>To one who loved the picturesque, the scene would have been interesting, for
                        it contained all variety of countenance, costume, and manner. But it
                        possessed an intenser and far deeper interest for him who had studied the
                        human heart, its passionate throes, its indignant feelings, its wild
                        energies, its strong convulsions, its lacerated affections. There lay the
                        corpse, a crucifix at its head and twelve mould candles on a table at its
                        feet. By the bedside knelt the widow—actually, by an unnatural excitement,
                        rendered temporarily convalescent by the sharp fact that she had lost the
                        husband of her heart. By the corpse, on the opposite side, sat their only
                        child, a lad of few years, apparently unconscious of the extent of the
                        calamity which thus early had orphaned him. A professional Keener (like the
                        "hired wailing women" of Scripture) was ranged on either side of the
                        deceased, awaiting a full audience for the similated grief, and now and then
                        muttering fragments of their intended Lament. Around the humble
                        apartment—for the peasant's cabin consisted of only a single room—were
                        ranges of stools, three deep, and here and there were deal tables, on which
                        were placed tobacco-pipes, and "the materials" for the refreshment and
                        enjoyment which, by a strange contrast with the awful occasion which called
                        them together, were considered indispensable.<pb n="158-159"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000080"/> Such a thing as a <emph>dry</emph> Wake would
                        indeed have been an anomaly, there and then.</p>
                     <p>The friends of the dead man dropped in stealthily, and at intervals—for
                        there was some uncertainty whether the military would permit such an
                        assemblage. Before long the room was crowded, all fear of being interfered
                        with gradually vanished, and the party, albeit assembled on a melancholy
                        occasion, soon glided into conversation, smoking, and drink.</p>
                     <p>There was no merriment, however, for the circumstances under which they met
                        forbade it—so early in the night. Their conversation was in a hushed tone.
                        The comparative stillness every now and then became positive when they
                        noticed the voiceless sorrow of the poor widow, as, pale and emaciated by
                        suffering of mind and body, she knelt by the dead, holding his clay-cold
                        hand, and, her eyes fixed upon his comely face, now pallid with the hue of
                        mortality, and placid in repose as that of a sleeping infant. At intervals,
                        there rose the melancholy and eloquent wail of the Keeners' wild poetry, in
                        the native language of the auditors, deeply impassioned, and full of the
                        breathing indignation which stirs men's minds to such a pitch of excitement
                        that they come forth from the listening fitted for almost any deed of
                        daring.</p>
                     <p>The Keen told how the dead man had won the hearts of all who knew him—how he
                        had excelled his companions in the sports of youth and the athletic
                        exercises of manhood—how, at pattern, fair, or dance, he still maintained
                        his superiority—how his was the open heart and liberal hand—how he had won
                        his first love, the pride of their native village, and married her—how, when
                        a shadow fell upon their fortunes, that loved one lightened, by sharing, the
                        burthen, the struggle, and the grief—how, amid the desolation, her gentle
                        smile ever made a soft sunshine in their home—how, a victim without a crime,
                        he had fallen in the noon of life—how there remained his young boy to
                        remember, and, it might be, one day to avenge his murder—how every man who
                        was present would protect and sustain the widow and the orphan of him whom
                        they had loved so well—and how, come it soon or late, a day would arrive
                        when expiation must be made for the foul deed which had sent an innocent man
                        to an untimely grave.</p>
                     <p>As the chief Keener chanted this Lament, in the expressive and figurative
                        language of their native Ireland, the hearts of her auditory throbbed with
                        deep and varying emotions—sorrow swelled into the deeper sense of
                        injury—wild indignation flushed the cheek of manhood—and hand was clasped in
                        hand with a fierce pressure, in well-understood pledge of sorrow for the
                        dead, hatred for his slayers, and stern resolve of vengeance.</p>
                     <p>About ten o'clock, the door slowly opened, and a tall man, apparelled in the
                        loose great-coat, or <hi rend="i"/>coat-a-more, which forms the principal
                        dress of the peasantry<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7173-00000081"/> in that
                        district, stood for some minutes on the threshold, an interested but
                        unobserved spectator. When he was perceived, many rose to offer him a seat,
                        which he declined, and soon all voices joined in a common cry of "Welcome,
                        Captain! A thousand and a hundred thousand welcomes!"</p>
                     <p>The stranger returned the salutation cordially and briefly, and advanced
                        gravely and slowly to where the dead man lay. He gazed upon the face for
                        some time, and then, laying his hand on that cold, pallid brow, said, in a
                        tone of deep, concentrated feeling,—"Farewell, John Sheehan! Yours has been
                        a hard fate, but better than remains for us—to be hunted down, like wild
                        beasts, and sent, after the mockery of a trial, from the homes of our
                        fathers, to a far-off land, where even the slavery they doom us to is better
                        than the troubled life we linger in, from which caprice or cruelty may hurry
                        us in a moment. Farewell, then; but, by the bright Heaven above us, and the
                        green fields around, I swear to know no rest until bitter vengeance be taken
                        for this most wanton and barbarous murther."</p>
                     <p>His cheek flushed—his eyes flashed—his frame trembled with strong emotion as
                        he sternly made this vow, and, when he ceased to speak, a deep "Amen" was
                        murmured all around by the eager-eyed men, who hung upon his slightest word
                        with as trusting and entire a faith as ever did the followers of the Veiled
                        Prophet upon the mystic revelations which promised them glory upon earth,
                        and eternal happiness in heaven! The widow, roused from the abstraction of
                        grief by this solemn and striking incident, looked the thanks which she then
                        had not voice to utter. When the Stranger laid his hand on the orphan's
                        head, and said: "He shall be my care, and as I deal by him may God deal by
                        me!" her long-repressed tears gushed forth, in a strong hysteric agony,
                        which was not subdued until her child was placed within her earnest embrace,
                        and kissed again and again—with the widowed mother's solacing thought, there
                        yet remained one for whom to live.</p>
                     <p>Turning from the corpse, the Stranger took his seat among the humble but
                        loving people in that lowly cabin. He was of large mould, with a bold, quick
                        glance, and an air of intelligence superior to his apparent station. It was
                        singular that his appearance among them, while it ardently awakened their
                        respectful attention, had chilled and checked the company. After a pause,
                        one of them ventured to hint that the first allowance of liquor had been
                        drank out, so that "there did not remain an eggshellful to drink the health
                        of the Captain." There was a murmur of applause at the remark. Thus
                        encouraged, another ventured to suggest that a fresh supply be provided, at
                        the general expense of the company—the gallantry of the men excepting the
                        fair sex from any share in the payment. The necessary amount was speedily
                        collected, and a supply of<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7173-00000082"/>
                        whiskey (which had not condescended to acknowledge the reigning dynasty by
                        any contribution to the excise duties) was procured from the next <hi
                           rend="i"/>shebeen—an unlicensed dépôt for the sale of "mountain dew,"—and
                        placed upon the table.</p>
                     <p>The stranger, who had appeared quite unobservant of this proceeding, and
                        who—on the principle that "silence gives consent"—had even been supposed
                        rather to sanction than condemn it, suddenly interrupted the hilarious
                        arrangements thus commenced. He started up and exclaimed—"Is it thus, and
                        always thus, that I am to find you?—the slaves and victims of your besotted
                        senses. Is there anything to be done? I look for the man to do it, and find
                        him sunk in drunkenness. Is a secret to be kept?—it is blabbed on the
                        highway, to the ruin of a good cause, by the man who suffers drink to steal
                        away his reason. When I lie down to sleep, I can dream of ruin only, for
                        this subtle devil can tempt the truest into a traitor. And now, with the
                        hour of triumph at hand—the rich hope of vengeance near fulfilment—there is
                        not a man among you, bound to me as you are, heart and hand, soul and body,
                        who would not surrender the victory and the vengeance, if he were only
                        allowed to drink on until he had reduced himself to a level with the
                        senseless brute. Give me that liquor."</p>
                     <p>His command was instantly obeyed, for he had rare ascendancy over the minds
                        of those who acknowledged knowledged him as their leader. Dashing the vessel
                        violently on the hard earthen floor, he broke it, and every drop of its
                        contents—the "fire-water" of the American aborigines—was spilled. "There,"
                        he cried, "who serves with me, must obey me. When a deed is to be done, I
                           <emph>will</emph> have obedience. When the deed is done—drink, if you
                        will, and when you will. But when service is to be performed, you
                           <emph>shall</emph> be sober."</p>
                     <p>Not a syllable of dissent—not a murmur of discontent fell from the lips of
                        those who heard him. Not a gesture—not a look—indicated anger at what he had
                        done.</p>
                     <p>"Mark me, my lads," he added. "I have arranged all beyond the chance of
                        defeat. I have contrived to turn the main strength of the soldiers on a
                        wrong scent four miles on the other side of Charleville. I have laid my
                        plans so that we cannot be disappointed, except through some fault of our
                        own. Let us on to Churchtown Barracks. The sergeant, by whose rash and ready
                        hand our friend has died, remains there with a handful of his comrades. He
                        was sent thither to escape us. Fools! as if, for those who have a wrong to
                        avenge, any spot can be too remote. Let us seize him, and give him the doom
                        he gave the innocent. If they resist, we can fire the barracks, and burn
                        them in their nest. But they will never be so mad as to offer resistance to
                        such a force as ours, when we tell that we want only that one man.<pb
                           n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7173-00000083"/> If they do—their blood be upon
                        their own heads. Who joins me? Who will follow to the cry of 'On to
                        Churchtown?' Now is the long-desired hour of revenge. Will any lag
                        behind?"</p>
                     <p>Every man present repeated the cry—"On to Churchtown!" Some of the women
                        also joined in it.</p>
                     <p>The Whiteboys and their leader left the cabin. An ancient crone, almost a
                        reputed witch, and certainly known to be by far the oldest woman in the
                        district, hobbled after them as far as the door, and threw her shoe after
                        them—"for luck!"</p>
                     <p>Many a "God speed them" was breathed after that company of avengers by young
                        and fair women. What Lord Bacon has called "the wild justice of revenge,"
                        and what America recognizes in the unseen but omnipotent incarnation of
                        Judge Lynch, was necessarily the rule of action when injured Right took arms
                        against tyrannic Might. Is it surprising that such should be the case? If
                        wrongdoers cannot always be rewarded, "each according unto his works,"
                        within and by the law, why should not their impunity be broken down by the
                        rational sense of justice which abides in the minds of men?</p>
                     <p>Forth on their mission, therefore, did the White-boys speed. Hurrying across
                        the bog, they reached a farm which was almost isolated amid the black waste
                        from which it had been indifferently reclaimed. They drew muskets, pistols,
                        and pikes from the turf-rick rick in which they had been concealed. Some of
                        them brought old swords, and scythe-blades attached to pike-handles (very
                        formidable weapons in the hands of strong, angry men), from hiding-places in
                        the bog itself. Stealthily, and across by paths unknown to and inaccessible
                        to the military, that wild gang, "with whom Revenge was virtue," pushed
                        forward for the attack on Churchtown Barracks.</p>

                     <p>STEALTHILY and in silence the Whiteboys proceeded to the scene of intended
                        operation. Not a word was spoken—not a sound heard, except the noise of
                        their footsteps whenever they got on the high road. As much as possible they
                        avoided the highway, the course which would the soonest bring them to the
                        appointed place. It would seem as if their leader had bound them together,
                        by some spell peculiarly their own, to yield implicit and unquestioned
                        obedience to his imperious will. It strongly illustrated the aphorism— <q>
                           <l>"Those who think must govern those who toil."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whoever knows how lively and mercurial is the<pb n="166-167"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000084"/> natural temperament of the peasantry in the
                        South of Ireland, must be aware of the difficulty of restraining them from
                        loud-voiced talking in the open air; but now not one of that large and
                        excited gathering spoke above his breath. Their leader commanded them to be
                        silent, and to them his will was law.</p>
                     <p>Who was that leader? The question involves some mystery which it may be as
                        well to unveil before proceeding with the action of this narrative.</p>
                     <p>Who, and whence was that leader? His birth would have secured him a
                        "respectable" station in society, if his wild passions, and the strong
                        pressure of Circumstance (that unspiritual god), had not so far <q>
                           <l>"Profaned his spirit, sank his brow,"</l>

                        the highest aims, was now directed no farther than to establish an unstable
                        dominion over a few wild, uncultivated peasants, who, like fire and water,
                        might be excellent servants, but with any opportunity of domination would
                        probably prove tyrannic masters. He who would rule the rude peasantry of
                        Ireland, must make up his mind to be governed by them in turn, whenever
                           <emph>his</emph> wishes and aims and actions fall short of
                           <emph>theirs.</emph> They will go with him while his desires and designs
                        run together with their own, but they will speedily leave him behind, or
                        force him with them, if they find him less eager than themselves. Even under
                        the regular discipline of the army the same may be observed. In battle an
                        Irish regiment cannot, or rather will not, understand any order to retreat.
                        They repudiate all strategy which even <emph>appears</emph> to withdraw them

                        restrictions of military discipline, what must it be when freed from that
                        coercion?</p>
                     <p>The leader of the Whiteboys in 1822—the veritable CAPTAIN ROCK, whom I have
                        introduced at the Wake of the slain John Sheehan—was no common man. His
                        birth had been respectable, his education good, his fortune had been ample,
                        his mind was affluent in varied and vigorous resources; he had formerly won
                        favor and fame from the world's opinion, and few men in any country could
                        compete with him in the personal advantages which spring from manly beauty
                        of form and feature, activity of body, and a strength of frame which
                        literally defied fatigue and over-exertion.</p>
                     <p>The father of John Cussen was "a gentleman of independent fortune," in Irish
                        parlance; that is, had succeeded to a pretty good estate, and would have<pb
                           n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7173-00000085"/> been in easy, if not affluent
                        circumstances, could he have realized any thing like the nominal amount of
                        his rent-roll. But there were two difficulties, at least. Irish estates have
                        had a fatal facility in becoming subjected to such things as mortgages,
                        which relentlessly absorb certain annual amounts in the shape of interest,
                        and Irish tenants have been apt to cherish the idea that they perform their
                        duty towards society in general, and themselves in particular, by paying as
                        little rent as possible. Still, though Mr. Cussen's property had gradually
                        come under the pressure of these two causes, it yielded an income sufficient
                        for his moderate wants. His children had died, one by one, in the very bloom
                        and promise of their youth, until, out of a numerous family, only one son
                        survived.</p>
                     <p>This youth, possessing a mind more active and aspirations more ambitious
                        than most of his class, disdained the ordinary routine of every-day life. It
                        was not difficult to persuade his father to permit him to go into the
                        world—the military and naval service, from its danger, being the only
                        profession which that doting parent positively forbade him to think of. The
                        lad, after wavering for some time, determined to become a surgeon, and
                        proceeded to pursue his studies in Dublin.</p>
                     <p>It would be tedious to narrate into what a circle of extravagance, while
                        thus engaged, the young man became gradually involved; it would be painful
                        ful to trace his downward lapse from folly to vice. Sufficient to say that,
                        by the time he received his diploma as a surgeon (having passed his
                        examinations with unexpected and even distinguished success), he had
                        contrived to involve himself so deeply that his paternal property had to be
                        additionally mortgaged to relieve him from heavy involvements. His father,
                        who might have repudiated the creditors' claims, admitted them, without a
                        murmur. Eager to snatch him from the haunts and the society by which he had
                        embarrassed his means and injured his health, and looking on the military
                        service as a good school of discipline, even if it were not free from peril,
                        his father overcame all personal scruples, forgave the past, and looking
                        hopefully at the future, successfully employed his influence to obtain for
                        him an appointment as surgeon to one of the regiments which, just then, had
                        been ordered to Belgium, as the re-appearance of Napoleon, and his
                        triumphant progress from Elba to Paris—his eagle "flying from steeple to
                        steeple until it alighted on the tower of Notre Dame"—had awakened the fears
                        and enmity of Europe, bringing once more into action <q>

                        </q> It was John Cussen's fortune to reach the scene of warfare in time to
                        witness the deadly struggle at Waterloo. But it was his hap, also, to do
                           more<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7173-00000086"/> than witness it. He
                        performed an act of heroism on the field, which not only gained him high and
                        merited praise, but had powerful influence upon his future prospects.</p>
                     <p>Military discipline very properly provides that the surgeons of a regiment
                        shall not take part in any engagement on the field. The lives of so many may
                        depend upon the skill of even a single surgeon that it would be
                        inconvenient, to say the best of it, if, when his aid were promptly
                        required, during an encounter, it were found that he had allowed his ardor
                        to carry him into the actual peril of the strife.</p>
                     <p>Cussen was sufficiently near to witness the greater part of the contest on
                        the day of Waterloo. It was not without difficulty that his quick Irish
                        spirit could control the almost overwhelming desire to plunge into the
                        middle of the contest—which, on that day, had more single encounters than
                        any since Poictiers and Agincourt. As he stood outside a tent which had been
                        placed for the use of the medical staff, in the rear of the British
                        position, he observed an English officer, on an unmanageable charger
                        (bearing him along with an impetuous speed, which, having received a severe
                        wound in the bridle-arm, he could neither control nor check), followed by a
                        French cuirassier, who had nearly overtaken him. Another moment and the
                        uplifted sabre would have struck the helpless man to the ground. Cussen
                        rushed forward, literally tore the Frenchman from his saddle, by main
                        strength, and, wresting the sword from his hand, gave him a death-wound.
                        Quick as thought, turning from the fallen foe and bounding forward with an
                        agility which he had acquired on his native hills, Cussen followed the swift
                        horse, and succeeded, by a strong and over-mastering grasp, in checking its
                        speed. In its rider, he recognized his own Colonel, whose life he had thus
                        doubly saved, and received a grateful assurance that his service should not
                        be forgotten.</p>
                     <p>Having dressed the Colonel's wounds, Cussen resumed his position in the
                        rear.—But inaction was terrible to one whose spirit had been awakened to the
                        excitement before him—for "quiet to quick bosoms is a bane." Nearer and
                        nearer became his involuntary approach to that part of the place in which
                        the contest was hotly proceeding. At last, unable any longer to resist the
                        passionate impulse, he mounted on one of the many war-steeds which were
                        wildly galloping over the battle-field, caught the eye of the officer whom
                        he had rescued, rushed forward to join the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >mêlée,</foreign> and bravely fought side by side with him, when the "Up,
                        Guards, and at them!" of Wellington urged on the soldiers to that last
                        terrific charge which shook the imperial diadem from the brow of the first
                        Napoleon.</p>
                     <p>A gallant deed, even though it violate the strict rules of military
                        discipline, is not considered a very heinous offence by any commander. So,
                        while his<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7173-00000087"/> Colonel hailed John
                        Cussen as preserver, the brief lapse of duty as a surgeon was forgiven, in
                        consideration of his chivalry as a soldier.</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                     <head type="sub">THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE.</head>
                     <p>THE war ended. Napoleon fell. St. Helena received the imperial exile. On
                        this lonely rock, far out in the Atlantic, the chained Prometheus suffered a
                        punishment worse than death—Sir Hudson Lowe being the vulture which
                        continually struck, to prey upon, his heart.</p>
                     <p>The conclusion of the war influenced the fortunes of others besides its
                        greatest victim. The battalion in which Cussen had served was reduced, and,
                        with many others, his occupation was gone. While yet uncertain what course
                        to pursue, he received an invitation from his late Colonel, very urgently
                        pressing him to visit the veteran at his country seat in Hampshire; and
                        thither he proceeded.</p>
                     <p>Cussen, it may here be stated, was what old crones (who are good judges of
                        such things, knowing "a hawk from a hernshaw.") would simply and
                        expressively describe as "a very personable man." He was in the spring of
                        early manhood. He had the advantage, whatever <emph>that</emph> might be, of
                        gentle blood; he had received a good education; he had distinguished himself
                        in the greatest battle of the age; above all, he had saved the life of the
                        gallant officer whose guest he was. What wonder, therefore, if, before he
                        had been quite a month at Walton Hall, the bright eyes of Miss Walton beamed
                        yet more brightly when they met his admiring glances.</p>
                     <p>The lady was young—not decidedly lovely, perhaps, but that most charming of
                        all charming creatures, a thoroughly English beauty. She might not
                        immediately dazzle, but she was sure always to delight. It was impossible to
                        see and not admire her. Besides, she had been largely endowed with intellect
                        by bounteous nature, and had also been well educated, carefully rather than
                        brilliantly. With an undeniable dash of romance in her character, she was so
                        pure in heart and thought, that the very novelty of <emph>such</emph> purity
                        threw such a spell of enchantment upon the fevered passion of John Cussen,
                        that literally, for the first time in his life, his soul was subdued into a
                        tenderness which contrasted strangely, but not unpleasantly, with the wild
                        tumults—rather of sense than soul—which, in former days, he had been wont to
                        dignify with the name of Love.</p>
                     <p>When he ascertained such to be the state of his own feelings, he became very
                        anxious to learn whether Alice Walton was affected in like manner.<pb
                           n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7173-00000088"/> Her impressions appeared to be
                        very much as he desired, for, kissing that fair cheek, which <q>
                           <l>"Blushed at the praise of its own loveliness,'</l>
                        </q> and whispering hope to her anxious ear, he proceeded to explain to her
                        father all that he felt—to solicit his sanction for the love which, but just
                        confessed to each other, had suddenly been matured by that confession into a
                        passion at once deep and ardent.</p>
                     <p>Alice Walton was an only child. What other result, then, can be anticipated
                        than the usual one—the favorable reception of the avowal made by Cussen?
                        Affection raises few difficulties where the happiness of the beloved is felt
                        to be deeply involved. It is questionable whether, on that evening, a
                        happier group could have been found anywhere within the limits of "merry
                        England." The old soldier, pleased with the opportunity of keeping his
                        gallant preserver with him while also securing the happiness of his
                        daughter;—the young man exulting in his conquest, proud of the personal and
                        mental endowments of his lady-love, and firmly resolving never to give her
                        any cause to repent having yielded to the trusting affection which her
                        guileless nature had formed for him;—the maiden herself, with the day-dream
                        of love making an almost visible atmosphere of joy around her heart, softly
                        yielded to glad and genial anticipations of a happy future. Well is it that
                        Woman's heart can thus luxuriate in imagination, for, in many cases, the
                        romance of their love is far brighter than the reality ever proves to
                        be.</p>
                     <p>Some arrangements which were to be made respecting his family property, and
                        a natural desire personally to communicate his favorable prospects to his
                        father, required that Cussen, now an accepted suitor, should proceed to
                        Ireland for a short time.</p>
                     <p>Imagine the parting. The endearing caresses—the gentle beseechings for full
                        and frequent letters—the soft promises as to faithful remembrances—the
                        whispers of that mutual affection upon which a few brief months would put
                        the seal—and the "Farewell," which, though dewed with tears, had not very
                        much of real sorrow in it, so sweetly did it realize the expressive lines of
                        the poet, of the parting, though sad, which <q>
                           <lg type="quotation">
                              <l>"Brought the hope that the morrow</l>

                           </lg>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Cussen arrived in Ireland just in time to see his father die, and to learn
                        that old involvements, and the early extravagance in which himself had
                        rioted, had reduced their estate to a nominal income. The greater part of
                        its produce had been swallowed up by interest payable to the mortgagees,
                        who, from time to time, had advanced money on the property. In this dilemma,
                        Cussen did, from impulse, what, had he acted simply on calculation only,
                        would have been<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7173-00000089"/> the very best
                        thing for him. Without loss of time, he frankly communicated with Colonel
                        Walton on this unpromising condition and aspect of his affairs and
                        prospects—assured him that, when he sued for his daughter's hand, he had not
                        the least idea that he was so near the condition of a ruined man—that his
                        father, when discharging the liabilities in which his early extravagance had
                        involved him, had never breathed a syllable of the price at which they were
                        to be swept away—that, almost beggared as he now was, he felt himself, in a
                        worldly point of view, anything but a match for Alice—and that, while, with
                        a breaking heart, he absolved her from the tender vows which she had made,
                        he still cherished a hope that even yet, pass a few years, he might be able
                        to achieve a position, by the exercise of his talents, which, once again,
                        would permit him, on a more equal footing than at present, to solicit a
                        renewal of their betrothal. The Colonel was brief and decisive. He thanked
                        Cussen for his frank and honourable conduct, assuring him that Alice, as
                        well as himself, fully appreciated his motives; declared that for his
                        daughter's sake, as well as his own, he was unwilling to relinquish the
                        intended alliance with his preserver and friend; and liberally gave the
                        kindest promises of such full and immediate assistance as would speedily
                        relieve the estate from its encumbrances—should it indeed be thought
                        expedient to retain it, the reversion of the invaluable Walton Hall property
                        inalienably belonging to Alice.</p>
                     <p>Before, by the fulfilment of this promise, Cussen's brighter prospects could
                        be realized, "the tenth wave of human misery swept" over his heart. There
                        came a sad reverse. I am acquainted with all the details, but they are too
                        melancholy to be related here. Let it be sufficient to say that Alice Walton
                        and her father met with a sudden and tragic doom. By an accident, the origin
                        of which was suspected, but never ascertained, their residence was consumed
                        by fire—father and daughter perishing in the flames. The estate passed, in
                        due course of law, to the next of kin, with whom Cussen had no acquaintance,
                        and upon whom he had no claim In due course of law, also, the mortgages on
                        Cussen's own property were foreclosed. He was a ruined man.</p>
                     <p>The cup of misery overflowed. Very bitter did Cussen find the draught. Hopes
                        blighted—the golden promise of his young manhood wholly destroyed—station
                        utterly lost—Poverty with her feet upon his hearthstone—all that made the
                        value of life swept away at once. Amid the maddening whirl of such
                        contending emotions as this desolation caused, no wonder if even his strong
                        mind and large frame bowed beneath the shock.</p>
                     <p>Months passed by, and bodily health was in a measure restored. But the mind
                        did not recover its elastic spring. Sunk in the torpor of despair, John<pb
                           n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7173-00000090"/> Cussen was a broken man. Then
                        came the reaction, after a time, and then he awoke to the sad reality of
                        life. Better far had he continued unconscious or despairing. He might have
                        been miserable, but he would have been unstained by guilt. Gradually, he
                        found a Lethe for his sad thoughts, by passing "the Rubicon of the cup." At
                        first, while this was being done in secret, the neighboring gentry made many
                        efforts to arrange his affairs, liberate him from his more pressing
                        pecuniary involvements, and give him the opportunity of realizing an
                        adequate income by the practice of his profession. Each proffered kindness
                        was rejected. He sat, another Timon, with his household gods shivered around
                        him.</p>
                     <p>This could not long continue—for man cannot live without society. By degrees
                        Cussen returned to the haunts and the companionship of man. Had he kept
                        within the pale of his own class, perhaps all might still have been well.
                        But a change had passed over and darkened his mind. He fancied that scorn
                        sat upon the lip and glanced from the eye of every one more wealthy than
                        himself, and thus Pride guided the arrow which Poverty barbed. He shunned
                        the society of those to whom, in all save wealth, he had been equal, at the
                        very least, and he found a consolation in the company of those who,
                        remembering his birth (and in no place is that memory so well retained as in
                        Ireland), would have considered him as their superior, even if, like them,
                        he had to till the earth for a bare subsistence. Thus, by a slow but certain
                        process of deterioration, John Cussen—once the pride of the order of fashion
                        and wealth in his native country—gradually became the associate of the
                        ignorant and excitable peasantry.</p>
                     <p>Mixing with these poor people,—then, as ever, dissatisfied with their
                        condition, and eagerly anxious for any change which seemed to promise better
                        days and brighter fortunes,—Cussen soon became thoroughly identified with
                        their feelings. Hating oppression, believing that the peasantry were greatly
                        wronged by absentee landlords, oppressive middlemen, and an exacting "Church
                        as by law established," he allowed himself to be seduced into the secret and
                        illegal association of the Whiteboys. The homage which they paid to his
                        birth and education, gave him more satisfaction than, at first, he ventured
                        to own, even to himself. His pride was soothed by finding himself yet looked
                        up to by any class. The energy of his character returned (in part), and
                        assuming strong and unquestioned command over the disaffected peasantry, he
                        became one of their most powerful leaders. Quick in mental resources,
                        superior in physical strength, his influence over his followers was very
                        great. Entire obedience was yielded to his commands, and (as in the present
                        instance, when he undertook to lead the attack upon Church-town Barracks)
                        his presence was deemed sufficient to insure the success of any enterprise,
                           however<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7173-00000091"/> daring. In all this,
                        however, it is scarcely doubtful that John Cussen's actions were those of a
                        man whose mind had lost its balance. Sorrow and suffering had touched his
                        brain, and perhaps <emph>this</emph> was the vent which prevented actual
                        insanity.</p>
                     <p>There was "method in his madness," however, for when he entered upon this
                        wild and secret career, he took care that the movements which he personally
                        guided should be remote from that part of the country in which he was best
                        known. He strictly forbade any of his troops to indulge in drink, whenever
                        their co-operation was required, and on all expeditions which he personally
                        led (chiefly for the purpose of obtaining fire-arms from the houses of

                        complete was the disguise, that none could recognize John Cussen as the
                        dreaded Captain Rock, who scattered terror wherever he moved.</p>
                     <p>The remarkable fidelity which the Irish peasantry make it at once a matter
                        of duty and pride to pay to their leaders against the law, was Cussen's
                        chief protection. His secret was well kept. None of the gentry of the county
                        had the slightest suspicion that Cussen, in whom many of them still
                        professed to take an interest, was in any way mixed up—far less as a
                        leader—with the Whiteboy movements which caused them so much alarm.</p>
                     <p>Such was John Cussen, whom we left leading a goodly company of Whiteboys to
                        the attack on Churchtown Barracks, a military position of much strength and
                        some importance.</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE ATTACK ON CHURCHTOWN BARRACKS.</head>
                     <p>THE Whiteboys, and their leader, reached Churchtown Barracks about midnight.
                        All was silent when they arrived, except the measured step of the sentinel.
                        Darkness covered all things as with a pall. But Cussen knew every inch of
                        the ground, and the darkness, instead of being an impediment, was rather
                        auxiliary to his purpose. He posted his men in a favorable position, and,
                        within ten minutes of their arrival, everything was ready, and every one
                        fully instructed as to his particular line of action, and was prepared for
                        the manner of the attack.</p>
                     <p>Churchtown Barracks, in the centre of a very disturbed district, had
                        formerly been the residence of a private gentleman. When life and property
                        had become insecure, afraid of the doom of Major Going, he had fled the
                        country. Major Going, who had been not only agent to the great Courtenay
                        estates (Lord Devon's), but also a magistrate, had made himself unpopular in
                        both capacities. He <emph>would</emph> have<pb n="182-183"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000092"/> the rent duly paid at the appointed day, and
                        he sometimes went out of his way, from excess of zeal, to show his vigilance
                        as a dispenser of justice, under the law. After many warnings, which only
                        made him more exacting and more severe, he was assassinated. His successor,
                        a gentleman named Hoskins, followed the same track—dignified by the name or
                        "the path of duty,"—and shared the same doom. Not without warning, for,
                        weeks before that doom was inflicted, he had heard even his own laborers
                        chaunt the Whiteboy doggerel— <q>

                     <p>The noon-day assassination of two such active magistrates, and the increase
                        of predial insurrection in the counties of Cork and Limerick, so
                        imperatively called for the allocation of a large and permanent military
                        force at places in or near the disturbed localities, that the Irish
                        Government gladly occupied Churchtown House, at a high rent, as temporary
                        barracks. For some months previous to the night when Cussen and his men
                        appeared before it, several companies of infantry, and two troops of
                        cavalry, had been stationed at Churchtown, whence, on the requisition of a
                        magistrate, detachments might be detailed for duty, in more or less force,
                        as circumstances might appear to require.</p>
                     <p>With the strategy of a clever leader, Cussen had contrived to render the
                        place comparatively defenceless, by having notices sent to the officer left
                        in command, that there was to be a midnight assemblage of Whiteboys on the
                        other side of Charleville, and that an attack, to obtain arms, was to be
                        made on a gentleman's residence not far beyond. A strong detachment of
                        infantry and cavalry was sent off, to arrest the midnight conclave, and to
                        defend the house which was to be the object of attack.</p>
                     <p>The notice which thus put the authorities on the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">qui
                           vive</foreign> came from a schoolmaster, who was deeply involved in the
                        conspiracy of the Whiteboys, and was also in the pay of Government, as a
                        spy. He had repeatedly given information to the military. It had been
                        remarked, however,—but more as a matter of curiosity than suspicion,—that
                        while they rarely gained any thing but fatigue from sallies made at his
                        instigation, they never had been successful, but that outrages were pretty
                        sure to be committed, at the same time, in a quarter opposite to that which
                        he had suggested. In truth, he was a Whiteboy to the backbone, and a traitor
                        to the authorities who employed him. But, like most of the peasantry of
                        Limerick county, he was so very plausible in manmer, stolid in countenance,
                        and impenetrable in well-acted simplicity of speech and act, that his
                           fidelity<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7173-00000093"/> was not distrusted by
                        the magistracy or the military. The police did not think well of him.</p>
                     <p>The military force at Churchtown was large enough to be under the command of
                        a Field Officer. On this occasion Major White, to whom that responsible post
                        had been intrusted, deemed the information sufficiently important to place
                        most of his men on active duty. There remained in the barrack a few
                        dragoons, a score of infantry, and one subaltern officer.</p>
                     <p>Hastily as Churchtown House had been converted into a military station, care
                        had been taken to make it assume something of a garrison appearance. A stone
                        wall had been erected all around the building, inclosing sufficient space as
                        a barrack-yard, in which the soldiers might attend drill, and go through
                        their exercises. This wall was somewhat more than breast high. As there was
                        a strong gate at each side, the place was considered quite able to resist
                        any Whiteboy attack. But, indeed, such an act of daring had never been
                        anticipated. Who could dream that those who dreaded the lion's paw would
                        voluntarily rush into his mouth?</p>
                     <p>Having arranged his men for the attack, Cussen did not long keep them
                        inactive. He gave the word, and a volley of slugs rattled against the
                        barrack windows. The alarm was as immediate as the attack was sudden. The
                        soldiers hastily snatched up their arms, hurried to the windows to observe
                        whence came the assault, and were "picked out" by the quick sight and sure
                        aim of the assailants, so that some were wounded in their very
                        sleeping-rooms. Moving before the lights in those apartments, the soldiers
                        were palpable objects to the armed men outside.</p>
                     <p>In a few minutes, the soldiers were arranged in the barrack-yard, startled
                        at the unexpected peril, and ready for defence. At that instant, while
                        awaiting the orders of their officer, a second volley was fired upon them,
                        and with fatal effect. The young subaltern on duty—bewildered by the
                        suddenness and manner of this attack—"lost his head," as the saying is, and
                        hurriedly gave the order to "Fire!" Becoming rather accustomed to the
                        darkness, the soldiers fancied that they saw their assailants outside,
                        partly concealed behind the <emph>front</emph> wall. Each soldier aiming at
                        what he imagined to be the head of an enemy, a straggling peal of musketry
                        followed. The soldiers shouted, and were about re-loading, when, with fatal
                        precision, a third shower of slugs and ball, from the Whiteboys, did
                        tremendous execution among them. The beleaguered soldiers even then had not
                        ascertained from what quarter destruction was thus fiercely poured in upon
                        them.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding, they bore themselves gallantly. Men who had faced death, in
                        its worst form, on the field of battle, a few years before, were not likely
                        to quail before such foes as they knew must now be before them. The suspense
                        was worse than the reality,<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7173-00000094"/> for
                        their ignorance of the number and position of their assailants, caused
                        doubts more dreadful than would have been the actual knowledge of an
                        ascertained peril.</p>
                     <p>With as little delay as possible, but still only at a venture, the soldiers
                        fired a second time. Their fire was immediately returned. By this time, six
                        soldiers were killed, and ten lay severely wounded on the ground. Their
                        officer—a gallant youth who had been at school six months before—was shocked
                        and surprised at seeing his men thus dropping around him, taken in a trap,
                        as it were, and shot at like so many marks. Feeling that it was madness to
                        remain in their exposed situation, and anxious to give his men a chance for
                        their lives, he ordered them to throw open the gates, and sally out to meet
                        their enemies face to face, and die—if die they must—in a contest of man to
                        man and hand to hand.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, the much-thinned military array, literally <q>
                           <l>"Few, and faint, but fearless still,"</l>
                        </q> divided itself—but the alarm and surprise were great when they found it
                        impossible to open either of the gates. In fact, aware that these gates had
                        been absurdly constructed and hung to open <emph>out of,</emph> instead of
                           <emph>into,</emph> the barrack-yard, and anticipating the attempt to pass
                        through them, Cussen had made one of his few preliminary preparations to
                        consist of the heaping huge masses of rock against them, so as to prevent
                        their being opened to allow egress to the besieged soldiers.</p>
                     <p>This disappointment drove the military to desperation. When another volley
                        from without struck down two more of them, the remnant of the party were
                        quite bewildered, and would have fled back into cover, on the <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">sauve qui peut</foreign> principle, if their officer, as a
                        last resource, had not ordered them to scale the walls, and boldly meet
                        rather than fearfully retreat from the imminent peril.</p>
                     <p>As with one impulse, rushing forward, they rapidly crossed the front wall.
                        Here was a new cause for wonder. They found that they had hitherto been
                        wasting their fire. Cussen, to baffle his opponents, had placed his men
                        behind each <emph>side</emph> wall, while, as a decoy, he had made them put
                        their hats on that in <emph>front.</emph> Thus, while the fire of the
                        Whiteboys was masked, that of the military was thrown away upon the range of
                        hats in front, which were easily mistaken for men behind the parapet. It was
                        a clever strategy.</p>
                     <p>When the soldiers dashed over the barrack-wall, they discovered the trick.
                        The Whiteboys then rushed round from their concealment. A struggle ensued.
                        Both parties were highly infuriated—one with triumph, the other with rage.
                        The contest, though destructive, was not of many minutes' continuance.
                        Desperate as was the bravery of the<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7173-00000095"
                        /> soldiers, the overpowering force and courage of their opponents were
                        resistless. The soldiers had no alternative but to demand quarter. At that
                        word, Cussen instantly gave orders that the contest should cease. Scarcely
                        any of his party had even been wounded, while, on the other side, the young
                        officer was the only one unharmed. The sergeant who had shot Sheehan (as
                        related in the first chapter) was mortally wounded, and lay in the
                        barrack-yard, writhing in agony.</p>
                     <p>By this time, the barrack had been set fire to, and the flames raged
                        fiercely. Dismayed, defeated, and surrounded by their opponents, the
                        soldiers were grouped together on one side. Some twenty or thirty Whiteboys
                        had gathered around the dying sergeant, watching his agonies with fiendish
                        joy. "In with him! in with him to the fire! Burn him—burn the murderer
                        alive!" were exclamations which burst from their lips, and made the doomed
                        man shudder as he heard. Cussen stood a little aloof from all; one might
                        have almost taken him for an unconcerned looker-on, as he carelessly stood
                        with his arms folded, a close-fitting skull-cap of dark fur upon his head,
                        and a narrow slip of crape concealing the upper part of his face. When the
                        Whiteboys seized the sergeant, with the avowed intent of casting him into
                        the flames, the young officer addressed Cussen, and earnestly entreated him
                        to prevent so dreadful a deed. "My men have fallen," he said, "but I do not
                        know why they were attacked. For the love of heaven, do not allow this
                        wretched man to suffer such a death, in cold blood. Besides, he has a mortal
                        wound. If they want his death, a few hours, at the farthest, will gratify
                        them. Do not let him perish thus."</p>
                     <p>Cussen answered: "My men came here for revenge upon that man, and I can
                        scarcely prevent their taking it to the fullest. He deserves his death.
                        Blood for blood! When he shot an innocent, unoffending man, as if he were a
                        dog, he drew this vengeance on himself. Still, it need not be pushed to the
                        extremity they call for. A life for a life is all that can reasonably be
                        required. But—what cries are those?"</p>
                     <p>Turning round, he saw that the flames had now reached the stables in which
                        the horses of the dragoons were. The poor animals were driven almost to
                        madness by fear, and their dreadful cries came shrilly and fearfully upon
                        the ear, filling with awe the breasts of those wild men, who, while human
                        agony appealed in vain, shuddered at this painful manifestation of deep
                        suffering by the brute creation. Help was out of the question, as the flames
                        spread too rapidly for assistance to be rendered. The poor animals were
                        literally burned alive, amid the loudly expressed pity of the beholders.</p>
                     <p>From this tragedy they turned to the wounded sergeant. He had breathed his
                        last while this scene<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7173-00000096"/> had engaged
                        their attention. They would not be cheated out of their revenge. With a yell
                        of triumph, they cast his corpse into the flames, amid a thousand
                        execrations.</p>
                     <p>They thus had accomplished their work. Cussen turned to the young officer
                        and said: "You are free; but you must pledge me your word that if you have
                        any personal knowledge of me, or think that you have, you will never take
                        advantage of it." This pledge the officer firmly declined giving. Cussen
                        paused for a few seconds, and replied that it did not matter: he would draw
                        off his men. Giving the word, they marched off in good order—were soon out
                        of sight, and the smoking ruins and diminished force remained as evidence of
                        that night's tale of ruin.</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE ATTACK ON ROSSMORE.</head>
                     <p>THE news that Churchtown Barracks had been burned down, and the greater
                        portion of its military defenders killed, spread, like wildfire, through all
                        parts of the kingdom. Magisterial and military inquiries did no more than
                        ascertain the facts, but the persons remained undiscovered. Many were
                        arrested on suspicion, but the actual perpetrators escaped. The policy used
                        was to collect them from distant points, so that domiciliary visits from the
                        patrols and the police in the neighbourhood where the outrage had been
                        committed found the peasantry within their own habitations. Thus suspicion
                        was diverted and detection almost impossible—except by treachery.</p>
                     <p>Viewed through the magnifying glass of public rumor, the affair at
                        Churchtown appeared very great. In the dearth of more interesting
                        intelligence, it was such an event as the wonder-workers of the Press
                        delighted to snatch up as an especial theme for record and remark. The
                        London newspapers especially gloated over it. Day after day their columns
                        were filled with "important particulars of the massacre at Churchtown, where
                        the Irish rebels, in overpowering numbers, killed a regiment of infantry<pb
                           n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7173-00000097"/> and two troops of cavalry, burned
                        the barracks to the ground, and barbarously threw the soldiers' wives and
                        children into the flames, in which they were all consumed by the devouring
                        element." The affray was repeatedly mentioned in Parliament, where the
                        changes rung upon it produced quite a <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >variorum</foreign> edition of horrors.</p>
                     <p>The Executive offered large rewards for such information as might lead to
                        the apprehension and conviction of the offenders. Though the required
                        knowledge was scattered among hundreds of the peasantry—hunger-stricken men,
                        who often wanted even salt to their potatoes—not one was found to enrich
                        himself by the "blood-money." Two descriptions of persons are held in utter
                        hatred and contempt in Ireland;—the man who, for lucre, turns from the
                        ancient faith of his fathers, and he who becomes a "stag" (informer) to save
                        his own neck, or gain the wages of treachery. Of the two, the informer is
                        considered more harshly than the apostate, who may repent, and in the
                        fulness of time return (even on his death-bed) to the faith he has forsaken;
                        but once that a man becomes a traitor to his colleagues, he does what cannot
                        be undone by any contrition, and may be punished, but cannot be atoned for
                        by Death. It is a strange condition of society, lamented by O'Connell,
                        Sheil, and others, that, in any cases, while the Irish peasantry would pity,
                        and even shield the murderer, (finding or making excuses for his crime,)
                        they will not, they cannot pardon or excuse the informer.</p>
                     <p>Up to this time, Cussen had escaped suspicion of any participation in the
                        Whiteboy proceedings. Latterly, whether from distaste for the low
                        companionship into which he had fallen, or from a desire to elude suspicion,
                        he had made a point of frequenting society of a better order. On one of
                        these occasions, while he was spending the evening at the house of Mr. F.
                        Drew, Drewscourt, near Charleville, (in which, by the way, the writer of
                        these Sketches was born,) the affair of Churchtown became a subject of
                        conversation. Cussen took no part in the dialogue, but when all had retired,
                        except Mr. Drew—a very shrewd but eccentric man—he spoke freely upon the
                        subject, and having drank rather more than was good for him, got thrown off
                        his guard so much as, in the excitement of the moment, to give a minute
                        account of everything which had passed on the memorable night in question.
                        With fearful energy he narrated all the details, and at the close, when he
                        told how the mutilated body of the sergeant had been cast into the flames, <q>
                           <l>"Even in his glance, the gladiator spoke."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The impression which his statement and his manner made upon his listener was
                        (as Frank Drew told me afterwards) that Cussen must have been a principal<pb
                           n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7173-00000098"/> cipal in the frightful scenes
                        which he so vividly described, or must have had his information direct from
                        an eye-witness and participant. As the communication had been unguardedly
                        made, and was protected by the seal of that confidence which exists between
                        guest and host, the suspicion never found words until after it was too late
                        to harm Cussen.</p>
                     <p>The Churchtown insurgents remained undetected. Emboldened by success, Cussen
                        determined to make a bold attempt to obtain arms. His followers strongly
                        urged him to obtain fire-arms by attacks on the houses of country gentlemen
                        who were known to have provided themselves with large means of defence.</p>
                     <p>Castletown Conyers (about three miles from Drews-court) was the country
                        mansion of a gentleman of large property, not far from the boundary of
                        Limerick county. Mr. Conyers, an old gentleman whose loyalty and fears were
                        on a par, was living, when the predial disturbances broke out, in a remote
                        part of the county, and, having incontinently taken fright, had applied to
                        the Government for protection, and had a corporal and six of the Rifle
                        Brigade quartered in his house as a defensive force. Thus garrisoned, the
                        place might be considered a stronghold;—for, in addition to the military
                        force, Mr. Conyers had procured two or three cases of Birmingham
                        fowling-pieces, a few kegs of powder, a large bag of flints (this was before
                        the general use of percussion caps), and a hundred weight of sheet lead, to
                        be cast into bullets.</p>
                     <p>This formidable supply of arms and ammunition had reached Castletown under
                        strong military escort from Limerick, and report spoke of it as even more
                        considerable than it really was. With these munitions of war, and the
                        soldiers and the servants of the house, Castletown was one of the most
                        formidable places the Whiteboys could have thought of attacking. Yet, with
                        that characteristic, but calculating boldness, which gave him eminence with
                        his followers, <q>
                           <l>"For those who THINK must rule o'er those who TOIL,"</l>
                        </q> Cussen determined to invest this fortilage. The arms and ammunition
                        were what he wanted, for no one could harbor enmity against the owner of
                        Castletown, a harmless, neutral character, whose house was open to the poor;
                        while his wife, a matron of the olden school (she was half-sister to Sir
                        John Fitzgerald, now M. P. for Clare), was beloved throughout the district,
                        for her kindness and charity.</p>
                     <p>Cussen well knew that his party, numerous but badly armed, would have but
                        small chance of success in an ordinary attack upon Castletown, well defended
                        as it was. He determined to win by strategy what he could scarcely gain by
                        force. He<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7173-00000099"/> usually preferred such
                        exploits as could be achieved rather by mental ingenuity than mere physical
                        effect. To figure as the contriver gratified him, and encouraged his
                        followers' belief that, no matter what the difficulty, his sagacity could
                        bring it through with success.</p>
                     <p>About a mile from Castletown, and yet more remote from other large
                        houses—for it was in a part of the country half-bog, half-mountain—was
                        Rossmore, the residence of Mr. John Shelton, owner of a considerable
                        property. Long confined to his chair by gout, which had deprived him of the
                        power of walking, he had not taken any part in the county proceedings, as a
                        magistrate. Nor, while other resident landlords were soliciting assistance
                        to protect their dwellings, had Mr. Shelton joined in the entreaty. Isolated
                        by habits and local situation, from the gentry of the district, he believed
                        that the Whiteboys would not obtrude on the obscurity of one who felt that,
                        as a good landlord, he did not deserve ill at the hands of any one. Of his
                        large family there were then residing with him a son aged about eighteen,
                        and two daughters some years older. As Mr. Shelton was my own uncle, I can
                        speak confidently as to the details which I give.</p>
                     <p>About ten o'clock, on a fine evening in March, 1822, the peaceful
                        inhabitants of Rossmore House were disturbed by a Whiteboy visit. The doors
                        were speedily forced in, front and rear. The helpless less household
                        offering no resistance, the intruders proceeded to make themselves quite "at
                        home." One division sat down in the servants' hall, threw wood and turf on
                        the fire, and commanded the trembling female servants to cover the long
                        table with provisions. Others ranged through the adjacent apartments in
                        search of arms. More loudly called out for young Charles Shelton. The plan
                        of Cussen was to take this lad to Castletown a prisoner, and threaten to
                        shoot him in sight of the garrison there, unless all the arms and ammunition
                        were given up. The two families were on such friendly terms, besides being
                        related, that Cussen made sure of Mr. Conyers making any sacrifice rather
                        than see his neighbor's son killed. But, in very truth, (as I afterwards
                        knew,) whatever Mr. Conyers might have felt, the military force at
                        Castletown would rather have permitted the murder than part with the means
                        of defence—the catastrophe at Churchtown being in their minds.</p>
                     <p>Charles Shelton, who slept in an upper and remote apartment, did not
                        immediately hear the tumult below. His elder sister, Alicia, who had high
                        spirit and much self-possession, heard the clamour—readily surmised the
                        extreme danger of her brother—hastily arose, throwing a shawl over her night
                        dress—ran to her brother's room, the door of which she locked, securing the
                        key—and then went down boldly to face the danger, if necessary.</p>
                     <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7173-00000100"/>
                     <p>While she stood near the door of the servants' hall, regarding what was
                        going on, but herself unseen, Cussen came in from the back-yard, having kept
                        aloof from the confusion until then. He was just in time. The frightened
                        servants, in compliance with loud demands for drink, had placed the
                        whiskey-jar upon the table. Knowing that success, and even safety depended
                        on such indulgence being abstained from, he broke the jar with the
                        fowling-piece he carried.</p>
                     <p>His men looked at each other, then at him, but his stern looks awed them.
                        One or two merely muttered a regret that "such prime stuff" should be
                        wasted.</p>
                     <p>Cussen then, as if anxious to avoid all chance of recognition, returned to
                        the back of the house. He wore a close-fitting skull-cap, with a slip of
                        crape in front, and could see whatever occurred. His followers were more or
                        less disguised, and all, except Cussen, had white shirts over their
                        garments—hence the name Whiteboy.</p>
                     <p>Perceiving the power of his leadership, Alicia Shelton determined not to
                        waste words or time in entreaties on the men, but to appeal at once to
                        Cussen. She managed to leave the house without being noticed—found Cussen
                        outside, leaning on his fowling-piece, in a thoughtful and abstracted mood.
                        To throw herself on her knees before him—to implore him for the love of
                        Heaven to save her brother's ther's life—was the impulsive action of a
                        moment. He turned away, not even looking upon her, and then—the present
                        peril giving her new energy and courage—she seized him by the coat-skirt and
                        earnestly said, "You want to take my brother to Castletown. There they will
                        see him torn to pieces before they will surrender their arms. You must know
                        that it will be an idle attempt. Then, in their disappointment, your men
                        will kill him. Save him—save my brother, if you have a human heart. I know
                        that you will do it, and I will bless you if you do."</p>
                     <p>She sank on the ground before him. He felt that she was speaking the truth.
                        Besides, he was moved by her entreaty. Raising her from the ground, he said,
                        in a kind and soothing manner, "Lady! I am afraid that we must have your
                        brother's company, but no harm shall reach him with my consent."</p>
                     <p>Her convulsive grasp still held him. Striving to extricate himself, he got
                        into the moonlight, and then, for the first time, he had a view of her
                        features. She was very handsome; and now, with her dark hair dishevelled,
                        her eager glance, her graceful attitude, her earnest tone, her light attire,
                        she looked a Pythoness.</p>
                     <p>Cussen gazed long and anxiously on the still kneeling suppliant. Some old
                        memory may have<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7173-00000101"/> passed through
                        his mind in that brief space—a wave in life's vast ocean. Perhaps some
                        resemblance of form, feature, or voice brought back a glimpse of bygone days
                        of happiness and love. There still was something tender in that troubled
                        heart. He passed his hands across his eyes, as if he would clear them from a
                        mist, and then with a gentle courtesy, as if they were in a ball-room,
                        raised Miss Shelton from the ground.</p>
                     <p>"Lady," said he, "whatever I can do to aid you, I will do. They have not yet
                        found your brother. If he be concealed, keep him so, and I will make some
                        pretext to draw off my men. They must have whatever arms are in the house;
                        but they shall be content with that."</p>
                     <p>Miss Shelton would have expressed her warm gratitude, but Cussen did not
                        wait to be thanked. He turned away then. While she yet lingered, with
                        clasped hands to heaven, he suddenly returned, politely raised his cap from
                        his head for a moment, took one of her hands in his, pressed his lips to it,
                        with the gallant air of a cavalier, and then withdrew. Almost before Alicia
                        Shelton had regained her own apartments, Cussen had given his men the word
                        to retire. He led them into the belief that the military and police were
                        approaching, and this made them hastily retreat and disperse, taking with
                        them all the arms in the house except a small pair of pistols which Captain
                        Shelton had picked up and brought away with him from Waterloo. They are now
                        in my own possession.</p>
                     <p>Before Miss Shelton had risen from her earnest thanksgiving for her
                        brother's safety, Captain Rock and his force had departed. She then ventured
                        into her father's room, from whence his bodily ailments did not allow him to
                        move, and was happy to learn that he had not heard the tumult which had
                        prevailed in the more distant part of the house. Thus terminated a night of
                        terror.</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE TRIAL.</head>
                     <p>MUCH alarm was created, through the county of Limerick, by the attack upon
                        Mr. Shelton of Rossmore. The neighbouring gentry argued from it, and not
                        without cause, that if a gentleman whose advanced years and bodily ailments
                        had kept him aloof from the actual exercise of his magisterial functions,
                        were thus singled out, there was little hope for escape for those who had
                        made themselves marked men, by determined and acknowledged resistance to and
                        denunciation of the Whiteboys<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7173-00000102"/>
                        Accordingly, zeal being now quickened by fear for personal safety, it was
                        resolved that neither trouble nor expense be spared to discover the persons
                        implicated in this last affair. Many circumstances tended to establish a
                        conviction that the leader of the Whiteboys must be some one greatly
                        superior to those whom he commanded. The brief conversation which had been
                        held with the officer at Churchtown, and Miss Shelton at Rossmore, almost
                        proved that one and the same person had commanded on both occasions,—that he
                        was a man of education and gentle bearing,—and that it was necessary, above
                        all, if the insurrectionary conspiracy was to be put down, to strike at him,
                        its life and soul.</p>
                     <p>Weeks passed by, and though many were suspected, and several taken into
                        custody by the police, no clue to the discovery of the veritable Captain
                        Rock was yet discovered. At last, one of the persons apprehended on
                        suspicion—faint-hearted as a weak woman, and far less faithful—let fall some
                        words which first excited suspicion against John Cussen. No notice appeared
                        to be taken of them at the time, but the prisoner, who was kept in solitary
                        confinement for some time, was gradually worked upon by promises of large
                        payment in the event of the conviction of the actual leader of the
                        Whiteboys. He vacillated between cupidity, and fear of his own personal
                        safety. At last, he <emph>stagged</emph>—that is, he gave some information,
                        on the solemn promise that his having done so should never transpire, that
                        he should not be required to give any evidence in public, and that he should
                        immediately be conveyed out of the country for safety.</p>
                     <p>At first, the magistrates hesitated to believe that John Cussen could be
                        concerned in the outrages which had spread alarm far and near, and directed
                        particular inquiries to be made respecting his habits, way of living,
                        haunts, occupation, and companions. They ascertained, from this scrutiny and
                        espial, the fact of his frequent absences from home at night; they obtained
                        proof of his having been seen, within the prohibited hours, in remote places
                        where outrages had been committed; and the conviction came upon their minds
                        that Cussen, and none other, was the much-dreaded and long-concealed Captain
                        Rock.</p>
                     <p>Orders were given to arrest him, and also to search his house. Among his
                        papers were found some documents which could scarcely have been in
                        possession of any but a leader of the disaffected. They were insufficient of
                        themselves, however, to fix him as such.</p>
                     <p>The police and the military, charged with the warrant to arrest Cussen,
                        received strict injunctions to avoid unnecessary violence. It was
                        anticipated, from his determined character and great personal<pb n="204-205"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000103"/> strength, that he would resist any attempt to
                        make him a prisoner. Contrary to expectation, he surrendered himself without
                        struggle or hesitation. He was found sitting tête-à-tête with old Frank
                        Drew, at Drew's Court,—the same to whom he had spoken so freely about the
                        particulars of the attack on Churchtown Barracks,—and when he heard the
                        measured tread of the military, as they came up the avenue, he paused in his
                        conversation, and exclaimed, "They have come for me."</p>
                     <p>In custody his deportment, equally devoid of effrontery and fear, was
                        apparently that of an innocent man, and impressed very many with the idea
                        that he was unjustly suspected. The magistrates, who knew better, but were
                        compelled to conceal the source of their information, even incurred some
                        blame, from public opinion, for having apprehended and detained him.</p>
                     <p>The difficulty was—how to prove that John Cussen was identical with Captain
                        Rock. In accordance with his compact with the authorities, the craven who
                        had given the clue had been quietly shipped off to England. The most liberal
                        offers were secretly made, on the part of the Government, to induce some of
                        the other prisoners to turn king's evidence, but without avail. They knew,
                        one and all, what share Cussen's had been in the Whiteboy movements; but
                        they were fullý aware, also, that to appear in evidence against him would,
                        in effect, be equivalent to the signing of their own death-warrant. They
                        continued faithful to him—and from higher motives, perhaps, than that of
                        personal fear. For he was a man who possessed the power of winning hearts,
                        and there were many—very many of his followers, who had become so warmly
                        attached to him that they would have laid down their own lives to protect
                        his from harm.</p>
                     <p>It was believed that Miss Shelton, if she was so minded, could have
                        recognized his figure, his features, and the very tone of his voice. She was
                        strongly urged to do so, in order "to promote the ends of justice;" but,
                        grateful for the service which he had rendered to her brother, and
                        remembering his personal courtesy to herself, she invariably declined doing
                        so, and, to avoid all compulsion or persuasion in the matter, was secretly
                        preparing to pay a visit to her elder sister, who had married an English
                        gentleman, and resided at Bath. On her repeated refusal to assist the Crown,
                        it was determined that, by means of a stratagem, she should be trepanned
                        into identifying him.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, Major Eeles, Captain Johnstone, and another officer of the
                        Rifle Brigade, made a morning-call at Rossmore, and, as if by accident,
                        asked Miss Shelton and her sister whether they would not like to see the
                        barrack at Ballingarry, which they had repeatedly promised to visit. A<pb
                           n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7173-00000104"/> party of six or seven was made up
                        on the instant. The horses were ordered out, and very soon the party reached
                        the barrack, in which Cussen was detained until his final removal to the
                        county-prison of Limerick. That such a person was there, was unknown to all
                        the visitors. Accompanied by some of the officers' wives, whom they knew,
                        the ladies from Rossmore entered the room occupied by Cussen, heavily ironed
                        and closely guarded. As they were passing through it, Cussen was purposely
                        provoked, by one of his guards, to speak loudly—angrily, indeed—to some
                        taunting remark. Alicia Shelton, recognizing the peculiar and unforgotten
                        tone, seized her sister's arm, with a sudden impulse, and exclaimed—"It is
                        the very man!" and would have fallen, but for support immediately
                        rendered.</p>
                     <p>Cussen started at her exclamation, looked at her, "more in sorrow than in
                        anger," rose from his chair, raised his hat, and courteously saluted the
                        party. Miss Shelton, who avoided a second glance at him, restrained her
                        feelings, and did not again open her lips; but what she had involuntarily
                        said, slight as it was, sealed his fate—and he knew it. So did the officers
                        who had planned the trick.</p>
                     <p>Government had directed that Cussen's trial should immediately take place.
                        This was before Alicia Shelton had been betrayed into a recognition of the
                        prisoner. She considered herself bound in honour not to give evidence to the
                        detriment of one who had conferred ferred a signal favour on herself. But,
                        on the night of the attack, Cussen had also been seen and heard by her
                        younger sister, whose bed-room window overlooked the back-yard, and who had
                        witnessed the occurrence between them. Not considering herself bound by any
                        personal ties of gratitude, and somewhat selfishly recollecting her own
                        alarm rather than her brother's secured safety, Susanna Shelton declared
                        that, for her part, she had no scruples in performing what she believed to
                        be an act of justice to society. In addition, two of Cussen's followers, to
                        save their own necks from the halter, promised, almost at the last moment,
                        to turn king's evidence—but as there was no certainty of their remaining in
                        the same mind, when put into the witness-box (or, rather, as it actually
                        was, upon the table in the Court), not much reliance was placed
                           upon<emph>them.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Assizes being several months distant, it was resolved not to wait, and a
                        special Commission was sent down for the immediate trial of all persons in
                        custody under the Insurrection Act. At the same time, a messenger from the
                        Castle of Dublin arrived at Rossmore with a <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >subpœna</foreign> to enforce the attendance of Miss Shelton and her
                        sister, as witnesses on Cussen's trial, and they were taken away to
                        Limerick, in a post-chaise, escorted by a troop of dragoons. Apartments and
                        all suitable accommodation had been provided for them at Swinburne's—<pb
                           n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7173-00000105"/> then the principal hotel in "the
                        fair city of the Violated Treaty."</p>
                     <p>The trial is not forgotten by those who were present. The court-house of
                        Limerick was crowded to the very roof. I am proud to say, as an Irishman,
                        that among that large audience, there was not even one female. Irish
                        propriety, by a conventional arrangement rather understood than expressed,
                        very properly prohibits the appearance of any of the fair sex in a Court of
                        Justice, except where necessarily present as a party, or called upon as a
                        witness. I write of what was the rule some thirty years ago—matters may have
                        changed since. On arraignment, Cussen pleaded "Not Guilty." After a long,
                        fatiguing, and nearly inaudible speech from Mr. Sergeant Goold—who had been
                        eloquent, but, in his old age, had become the greatest proser, for a small
                        man, at the Irish Bar—the evidence was gone into. The case had been
                        skilfully got up, but, though no moral doubt could exist as to the
                        prisoner's participation, if not leadership, in many Whiteboy offences, it
                        may be doubted whether the proofs would have sufficed for a conviction in
                        ordinary times. The two informers, on whose evidence much reliance had been
                        placed, told their story volubly enough, but when the usher's wand was
                        handed to them, that they might point at the prisoner in identification,
                        each shook his head and affected never before to have seen him.</p>
                     <p>Cussen's equanimity was undisturbed throughout the early part of the trial.
                        When Mr. Sergeant Goold, in stating the case, alluded to the attack on
                        Churchtown, the prisoner said that, in the copy of the indictment with which
                        he had been served, there was no charge against him save for certain
                        transactions alleged to have taken place at Rossmore, and he desired to know
                        whether it was purposed, or indeed whether it was legal, to state a case or
                        give evidence out of the record? There was considerable sensation at this
                        inquiry. The Judge replied that Counsel ought to confine himself to the
                        charge in the indictment, and admitted that the prisoner had exercised no
                        more than his undoubted right in checking the introduction of irrelevant
                        matter. The Crown Counsel had only to bow and submit to the opinion and
                        reproof of the Judge. The prisoner appearing disposed to speak again, the
                        Judge asked whether he had any more to say? "Only this, my lord," said he,
                        "that if it be my <emph>right,</emph> as prisoner, to check the introduction
                        of irrelevant topics, having a tendency to prejudice me with the jury, it
                        surely was <emph>your duty,</emph> as Judge, to have done so—particularly as
                        mine is a case of life and death."</p>
                     <p>This was a well-merited reproof, given with a certain degree of dignity, and
                        (for the Judge was a man of enlarged mind) did no injury to Cussen.</p>
                     <p>When Miss Shelton appeared on the table, Cussen<pb n="210-211"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000106"/> appeared startled, for he had been given to
                        understand that she had positively refused to appear against him—indeed, it
                        had been reported that she had even gone to England to avoid it. Compelled
                        to give her testimony, she detailed, in the plain and forcible language of
                        truth, under what circumstances she had-seen Cussen at Rossmore—what peril
                        her brother had been threatened with—what supplications she had made in his
                        behalf—how promptly the favour she had solicited had been granted—how kind
                        the prisoner's words and demeanour to herself had been. She took occasion to
                        add that her appearance as a witness was against her own desire. She was
                        then asked to turn round and say whether she then saw the person who had
                        acted as she had described. Not without great delay and hesitation—urged,
                        indeed, by an intimation of the personal consequences of her contumacy—did
                        she obey, but, at last, she did identify the prisoner, saying, "That is the
                        man who saved my brother's life, at my entreaty, and stood between myself
                        and outrage worse than death." Cussen respectfully acknowledged her evident
                        feeling in his favour by making her a low bow as she went down.</p>
                     <p>Her sister, who was cast in a coarser mould of mind and body, exhibited no
                        scruples, but gave her evidence with an undisguised antipathy towards the
                        accused. The missing links, supplied by her testimony, made up a strong
                        chain of evidence which, every one felt, it would be difficult for Cussen to
                        beat down, in any manner. It was expected, almost as a matter of course,
                        that he would trust to proving, by an <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >alibi,</foreign> the impossibility of his having been the person who was
                        present on the occasion referred to by the witness. Every one who saw him in
                        the dock, where his bearing was equally free from bravado and fear,
                        anticipated some very ingenious, if not successful defence. He very slightly
                        cross-examined the witnesses for the prosecution, and then only on points
                        which bore on his personal conduct. He declined availing himself of the open
                        assistance of counsel—though he had consulted eminent legal authorities on
                        various technical points, while in prison. But for the place in which he
                        stood, fenced in with iron spikes, and surrounded by the police, one might
                        have thought him merely interested, as a spectator, in the circumstances
                        evoked by the evidence, rather than one whose life depended on the issue.
                        Cool, deliberate, and self-possessed, he entered on his defence.</p>
                     <p>It was of the briefest;—only a simple negation of the charge—a denial that,
                        even with all probability of its being true, there was legal evidence of
                        such a breach of the law as involved conviction and punishment—a regret that
                        his identity should have been mistaken by the younger Miss Shelton, who, had
                        he really been the person at Rossmore, had never, even on her own showing,
                        been so<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7173-00000107"/> close to him as for her
                        to distinguish his features—an expression of gratitude to Alicia Shelton for
                        her evident disinclination to injure one who she believed had treated her
                        with kindness—a strong disclaimer of imputing wilful error to
                           <emph>her,</emph> though he considered her sister not free from censure
                        for her undisguised avidity in seizing upon every circumstance to convict
                        him—a reckless assertion that, come what might, he had outlived the desire
                        of existence, and was prepared for any fortune. Such was the substance of
                        his address, delivered in a manner equally free from bravado and dread. He
                        concluded by declaring that, already prejudged by public opinion (the
                        newspapers, from the first, having roundly proclaimed that he, and none
                        other, was or could be the true Captain Rock), and with the undue weight
                        given to slight and evidently prejudiced evidence, he felt that his prospect
                        of acquittal was small.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Sergeant Goold then arose to speak to the evidence for the Crown, and
                        was interrupted by Cussen, who asked the Judge whether, when no evidence was
                        called for the defence, the prisoner was not entitled, by himself or
                        counsel, to the last word to the jury? Mr. Sergeant Goold answered that the
                        Crown, in all cases, was entitled to the last speech, and appealed to the
                        Judge for confirmation of the assertion. Cussen again addressed the Judge,
                        and said that, in civil suits, the practice was certainly not to allow the
                        plaintiff the last speech when the defendant fendant did not call witnesses,
                        for he had himself been a juryman, in the other court, when such a
                        circumstance had occurred. The Judge's decision was that, if he pleased to
                        insist upon it, the counsel for the Crown might desire and exercise the
                        right of speaking to the evidence, even when, as in the present instance,
                        the accused had called no witnesses, nor even made a defence. But, his
                        Lordship added, perhaps under the circumstances, Mr. Sergeant Goold would
                        not exercise the right. Goold grumbled, and fidgeted, and muttered
                        unintelligible sentences about his duty, and finally, gathering up his
                        papers, quitted the Court in a huff, with the air of a person mightily
                        offended.</p>
                     <p>The Judge then summed up the evidence, and charged the jury very
                        minutely—dwelling, more than was anticipated, on the remote probability that
                        the younger Miss Shelton might have been mistaken as to the identity of the
                        accused. But, said he, even if she were so situated that recognition of his
                        person were even impossible, there is the evidence of her sister, given with
                        a reluctance which was creditable to <emph>her</emph> humanity, gratitude,
                        and womanly feeling, which undoubtedly declared that the prisoner in the
                        dock, and none but he, was the leader in the attack upon her father's house
                        on the night named in the indictment.</p>
                     <p>The jury retired, and after a long deliberation, returned a verdict of
                        "Guilty." Perhaps, of all persons<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7173-00000108"/>
                        sons in the court, the prisoner was apparently the least moved by this
                        announcement. His cheek did not blench, his lips quiver, nor his limbs
                        tremble. He was called upon to declare whether he had anything to say why
                        the sentence of the law should not be passed?</p>
                     <p>Cussen, drawing himself up to his full height, declared, in a sonorous
                        voice, which filled the Court, and in the same collected manner which had
                        characterized him during the whole trial, that nothing which he could say
                        was likely to mitigate the sharp sentence of the law. "I have had a fair
                        trial," said he, "as from the excited state of the country, and the fears
                        and feelings of the jury, I could reasonably expect. It is evident, from the
                        time they have spent in deliberating on their verdict, that some of the
                        jury, at least, had doubts in my favour. But," he added, "I make no
                        calculation upon that, for I am aware that you, my lord, even while you
                        comply with the formula of asking me whether I have anything to say against
                        my sentence, have no alternative but to pronounce it. For my own part, I
                        have faced death on the battle-field, too often and too boldly, to dread it
                        in any shape. And for the ignominy, I hold with the French philosopher,
                        whose writings your lordship is familiar with, that it is the crime, and not
                        the punishment, which makes the shame. My lord, I stand, as it were, on the
                        threshold of another world. My path is already darkened by the
                        fast-advancing shadows of the grave. Hear me declare, then, that even if I
                        were the Captain Rock whom your jury declare me to be, my death, nor the
                        death of hundreds such as I am, cannot and will not put an end to
                        disaffection arising from laws oppressive in themselves, and rendered even
                        more so by being harshly and partially administered. The spirit of the
                        people is all but broken by long-continued and strong oppression. Between
                        middlemen and proctors they have been driven almost into despair. Exactions,
                        for rent and tithes, press increasingly upon them. Whatever little property
                        they may have possessed has gradually melted away. Their cattle, under
                        distraint for rent, crowd the pounds. Their miserable cabins are destitute
                        of fuel and food. They feel their wrongs, and have united with the energy of
                        despair to avenge them. Cease to oppress these men, and the King will have
                        no better subjects. So much for them. A concluding word for myself. My lord,
                        I have not called evidence, which I might have done, to show that my general
                        character is that of a man indisposed towards bloodshed and cruelty. It may
                        be too late to hear them now—but for the sake of others I would stand before
                        the world as one who is not the blood-stained ruffian which the learned
                        counsel for the Crown has proclaimed me to be. I would tell
                           <emph>him,</emph> were he here, that whatever else I have done, I have
                        never been publicly branded by the Legislature as a liar. My lord, I have
                        done."</p>
                     <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7173-00000109"/>
                     <p>This bold attack on Mr. Sergeant Goold, who, three years before, had been
                        publicly reprimanded by the House of Commons for having prevaricated, when
                        giving evidence before the Limerick Election Committee, was received with
                        applause.</p>
                     <p>The Judge intimated that he was ready to hear evidence as to Cussen's
                        character, on which several gentlemen of high standing in the county came
                        forward and bore testimony greatly in his favour. The sentence of death was
                        then pronounced, with the usual formalities.</p>
                     <p>But Cussen's hour was not at hand. A memorial to the Government, from Alicia
                        Shelton, strongly setting forth the humanity which the convict had
                        manifested towards herself, was immediately forwarded. With it went a
                        petition, signed by several who had been interested with Cussen's conduct on
                        the trial, and believed that to execute their leader was the least likely
                        way of conciliating the Whiteboys. In due course, the Judge who had presided
                        at the trial was called upon to state his opinion. It was said that, viewing
                        the case as it came out in the evidence, and without touching on the
                        suspicion or presumption that Cussen had been guilty of other breaches of
                        the law, the report of the Judge was strongly in his favour. At all events,
                        the Government complied with the urgent solicitations in Cussen's behalf,
                        and commuted the sentence of death into transportation for life.</p>
                     <p>As Cussen had heard his death-doom without any apparent emotion, his
                        reception of the mitigation of punishment was wholly devoid of exultation.
                        He requested that the prison authorities would convey his thanks to Alicia
                        Shelton and the others who had interested themselves in his favour.</p>
                     <p>It was said that an intimation was made to him, on the part of the
                        Executive, promising him a full pardon if he would give them a clue to the
                        Whiteboy organization, which they greatly desired to put down. It was
                        reported, also, that, in his reply, he declared himself incapable of
                        betraying any confidence which had been reposed in him,—that family
                        circumstances must prevent his desiring to remain in Ireland, on any
                        terms,—and he trusted there was a Future for every man who desired to atone
                        for the Past. This was the nearest approach he ever made to an admission
                        that he had been involved in the Whiteboy movements. The "family
                        circumstances" to which he alluded consisted of his having been privately
                        married to a Miss Fitzgibbon, with whom he lived so unhappily, that even an
                        enforced residence in New South Wales appeared a lesser evil than to remain
                        with her in Ireland.<ref rend="super" target="#note_007" xml:id="return_007"

                        <p><ref target="#return_007">*</ref>The friend who has given me this
                           information respecting Mrs. Cussen, says that when she lived in Limerick,
                           not long ago, her means appeared ample. Her father, who had been a rich
                           cattle-dealer, grazier and farmer, near ———, had probably left her in
                           easy circumstances. He was a Mr. Fitzgibbon, and very little indebted to
                           education. He sent his daughter to a first-rate boarding-school, and
                           permitted her, when grown to womanhood, to invite her former perceptor
                           and a few more "genteels" to an evening party—the first ever given in his
                           house. The young lady was some what affected, and, to show her education,
                           used big words. Her father, who heard her say to the servant "Biddy, when
                           the company depart, be sure and extinguish the candles," inquired what
                           was the meaning of the word "extinguish." It means <emph>to put out a
                              thing,</emph> said she. In the course of the evening the pigs got upon
                           the lawn, which was over looked by the drawing-room window, and made a
                           terrible noise. Old Fitzgibbon, determined to be genteel among his
                           daughter's fine guests, went to the head of the stairs, and loudly called
                           out, "Biddy, go at once and extinguish the pigs from the front of the
                           house!"</p>

                     <p>This, however, did not transpire until some time after he had quitted the
                        country.</p>
                     <p>He was transmitted to the convict-ship at Cove, on board of which the
                        narrator of this story, then a lad, had the curiosity to visit him. Of
                        course, no conversation arose as to the question of his guilt or innocence.
                        When Cussen learned that his youthful visitor was related to Miss Shelton,
                        he manifested some interest, inquired after her health, begged she would
                        accept his thanks for the favourable manner in which she had given her
                        evidence, and said that she had strongly reminded him of a lady whom he had
                        formerly known, and whose death had led to the circumstances which had
                        brought him to his present position.</p>
                     <p>The impression which remains on my mind, after the lapse of so many years,
                        is very much in favour both of Cussen's appearance and manners. He was
                        neatly dressed, and looked very unlike what might have been
                        anticipated—considering that he was the veritable Captain Rock. His voice
                        was low—"an excellent thing" in man as well as in woman. There was no
                        appearance of bravado in his manner. The two turnkeys from Limerick jail,
                        who were in charge of him, spoke very highly of his gentle disposition and
                        uniform civility. They declared, such was their conviction of his truth,
                        that if, at any time, he had desired to leave them for a week, with a
                        promise to return by a particular day and hour, they were certain he would
                        not break his parole.</p>
                     <p>On reaching Spike Island, he was attired in the convict costume,—and the
                        humiliating livery of crime appeared a great annoyance to him for a day or
                        two. After that, he showed no feeling upon the matter. The "authorities" at
                        Spike Island, who were much prejudiced against him, at first, speedily came
                        to treat him with as much kindness as their rough nature and scanty
                        opportunities permitted them to show.</p>
                     <p>Within three weeks of his conviction, John Cussen was <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> for Botany Bay. During the voyage, a
                        dangerous epidemic broke out among the convicts and the crew. The surgeon of
                        the ship was one of the first victims. The commander, who had heard the
                        report of the trial at Limerick, recollected<pb n="220-221"
                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000111"/> lected that one of the witnesses had stated
                        how gallantly Cussen had fought at Waterloo, when an army-surgeon, and asked
                        his prisoner whether he thought himself capable, in the existing emergency,
                        of taking medical charge of the ship. Cussen replied in the affirmative, but
                        positively declined doing anything so long as he wore the convict-dress. His
                        desire being complied with, he was released from his irons, intrusted with
                        the care of the sick, and succeeded in mitigating their sufferings by the
                        remedies he applied. The disease was checked, so that the mortality was much
                        less than was expected, and this favourable result was mainly attributable
                        to Cussen's skill. On arriving in New South Wales, this was so favourably
                        represented to the authorities, that a ticket of leave was immediately given
                        to him. Proceeding up the country, he took a small sheep-walk, and was
                        getting on prosperously, when a party of bush-rangers attacked and
                        devastated his little place. He immediately devoted himself to a contest
                        with this predatory band—long the terror of the colony—and did not rest
                        until he had so completely routed them, that the leaders were apprehended
                        and executed, while the rest, one by one, came in and delivered themselves
                        up to justice.</p>
                     <p>The result was that, for this public service, Cussen received a pardon (the
                        only condition being that he must not return to Ireland), within two years
                        after his arrival in the Colony. He practiced for some time, as a surgeon,
                        at Sydney, and having realized about five thousand pounds, proceeded to the
                        United States. One of his first acts, after arriving in New York, was to
                        send to Ireland for the son of John Sheehan (the man who had been shot on
                        suspicion of Whiteboyism), now doubly orphaned by his mother's death. He
                        adopted him, in fulfilment of his promise at the Wake, as related in the
                        first chapter. His own wife and daughter, whom he had liberally supplied
                        with funds from New South Wales, declined rejoining him there or in America,
                        and were actually residing in Limerick a few years ago. Cussen eventually
                        settled in one of the Western States, where his capital at once enabled him
                        to purchase and cultivate a large tract of land. He has been heard of, more
                        than once, by those who knew his identity, as a thriving and influential
                        citizen, under a slightly changed name.</p>
                     <p>The fact that Cussen had led the attack upon Churchtown Barracks was not
                           <emph>positively</emph> ascertained for several years after his departure
                        from Ireland. In a death-bed confession, one of the party avowed it. To this
                        day, however, very many of the people in the County of Limerick, who were
                        well acquainted with Cussen, will not believe that he ever could have
                        participated in such a cold-blooded massacre. They appeal, in proof of the
                        gentleness of his nature, to the kind feelings which he exhibited during the
                        attack on Rossmore.</p>
                     <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7173-00000112"/>
                     <p>It is clear, at all events, that by the conviction of Cussen, the Whiteboys
                        lost a leader. The confederation was speedily broken up, for want of its
                        CAPTAIN ROCK. Nor, since that time, have the disaffected in Ireland been
                        able to obtain the assistance of any one so competent for command as was
                        JOHN CUSSEN. His successors, from time to time, have been bold, ignorant
                        men, at the highest not more than one degree above the peasantry whom they
                        contrived to band together as United Irishmen, Ribbonmen, or Whiteboys. The
                        peasantry were taught, too, that the redress of grievances is not likely to
                        be brought about by illegal confederations—that agitation
                           <emph>within</emph> the law, may virtually place them <emph>above</emph>
                        the law,—and that he who commits a crime gives an advantage to the
                        antagonist. This was the great principle which O'Connell always endeavoured
                        to enforce. We have seen the last of the Whiteboys, and I have told the
                        story of the undoubted CAPTAIN ROCK, the will-o'-the-wisp of Irish agrarian
                        disturbances.</p>

                  <head>A NIGHT WITH THE WHITEBOYS.</head>
                  <p>IN connection with the leadership of John Cussen, an incident occurred which
                     may be related here, as a sort of appendix to his own adventures. It is only a
                     trifle in its way, but illustrates the manner in which, even after he had
                     quitted the country, he was regarded by his former adherents.</p>
                  <p>About twelve months after the conviction and transportation of Captain Rock,
                     which eventually led to the breaking up of the Whiteboy organization—though,
                     here and there, a few branch Ribbon lodges remained—I was on a visit to my
                     uncle, the self-same owner of Rossmore, mentioned in the previous story, and
                     father of its heroine. Rossmore House is situated within a short distance of
                     Castle-town Conyers, and, by taking a short cut across the fields, this
                     distance might be reduced to a mile. Having spent the day at Castletown, I was
                     returning to Rossmore by the short cut, late in the evening—too late, indeed,
                     as I had been warned, from the chance of meeting some of the prowlers who
                     haunted the by-roads towards the small town. I had no fear, however, and though
                     it was after twelve o'clock, there was a beautiful full moon, which, as the
                        old<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7173-00000113"/> song says, "did shine as
                     bright as day." I had got on a narrow by-road which ran between two bogs, and
                     was speeding home with as little delay as possible. All at once, I heard the
                     dull heavy tramp of feet, in a measured tread, and thought that it probably was
                     the police-patrol taking its rounds. As some of the police were quartered at my
                     uncle's, I entertained no apprehension on account of being found out of doors
                     at an untimely hour, as my person was known to these peace-preservers. I walked
                     on, therefore, at my ease, loitering a little to allow myself to be overtaken,
                     in order that I might have an escort home.</p>
                  <p>The party came up, and when I turned round to recognize and speak to them, I
                     was considerably alarmed to find that I was in the midst of a large assemblage
                     of rough-and-ready countrymen, wrapped up in large blue <hi rend="i"/>coateens,
                     every man of them with a huge bludgeon in his hand. Knowing that the best plan
                     was to put as bold a front on it as I could, I accosted them with the usual
                     "Good evening, boys." They did not condescend to return the greeting, but
                     gathered together in groups, conversing in Irish, which I did not
                     understand—the acquisition of that ancient and sonorous language having been a
                     neglected branch of my education. From their vehement action, their constant
                     references to myself by gesture, and the repetition of my name, I perceived
                     that they knew who I was, and were speaking about me. Under such circumstances,
                     I thought, with Falstaff staff, that the better part of valour was discretion,
                     and I prepared to effect my escape from such unpleasant companionship, by
                     slipping off as quietly as I could.</p>
                  <p>The intention, however excellent, was not to be borne out in execution. Before
                     I had taken fifty steps, I felt two or three large, rough, hairy, sinewy hands
                     on the collar of my coat, and the cold muzzle of a pistol under my left car,
                     with a threat, strengthened by a tremendous oath, that, if I dared move one
                     inch farther, the contents of the pistol should be lodged in my brain. I did
                     not move, having a strong idea that the threat would be carried into
                     execution,—not a remarkably pleasant anticipation for any one, far less for a
                     lad of fourteen.</p>
                  <p>After some delay, a man, who appeared to be a kind of leader, asked me my name,
                     and whether I was not a nephew of "the old fellow at Rossmore." I said that I
                     was. "Then," said he, "you are the cousin of that fine young lady whose
                     swearing was the means of our Captain being sent across the sea?" I answered
                     that he was quite correct, and that I certainly was the lady's cousin. "Then,"
                     said he, "as we cannot lay hands on <emph>her,</emph> for she cut away to
                     England when the trial was over, for fear of our just revenge, I think we must
                     have <emph>your</emph> blood instead." As I had a very strong objection to
                     suffering, vicariously, even for a woman and a cousin, I remonstrated against
                     the design, alleging,<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7173-00000114"/> truly enough,
                     that it was hard I should answer for any one's sins but my own; that the lady,
                     as was well known, had given evidence against Captain Rock, under compulsion;
                     and that, after he was sentenced to death, she never rested until she had
                     obtained a remission of the sentence of death passed upon him.</p>
                  <p>What I said evidently made an impression on my audience—on such, at least, as
                     knew English. To the rest it was duly interpreted; after which, still leaving
                     me in charge of the hirsute giant with the great pistol, the party retired a
                     little way to hold consultation respecting me. This I knew, because the rough
                     gentleman, who held the pistol to my ear, grew a little communicative, telling
                     me that they had all been to the fair of Bruree, where they had indulged pretty
                     freely in strong liquors, and that he thought it likely, as they had made up
                     their mind to take my life, that they were then only deliberating in what
                     manner to carry out their intention. "It is an easy death enough," said this
                     Job's comforter, "to be strangled by a handkerchief, squeezed round the throat
                     to a proper tightness; it is as good a way as any other to put a man into a
                     deep bog-hole like that on the side of the road there; but," he added, "for
                     doing the thing genteelly, and making sure of quick work and little pain, I
                     certainly would prefer a pistol like this, with a decent charge of canister
                     ister powder, and a brace of bullets or a couple of slugs at the top to make
                     all right."</p>
                  <p>The conference by the way-side lasted so long, that I grew heart-sick with
                     anxiety. I could see, by their unrestrained movements, that some of the party
                     were disposed to wreak upon my person their revenge against my cousin, and that
                     some were recommending a milder process. Presently, the decision appeared to be
                     made—whatever it might be. The same man who had already spoken to me, came up
                     again, and with him the rest of that precious conclave. "My lad," said he,
                     laying his hand upon my shoulder, "Do you know what we have made up our minds
                     to do?" I answered, that I did not know. "Some of us," said he, "think that, as
                     you have met us to night, and may know some of us again, the best thing we
                     could do would be to put you out of the way at once. And some of us think, that
                     if we took your word, (though you're only a bit of a boy,) not to mention that
                     you have seen us, we might do worse than let you go home, though that home is
                     the nest which <emph>she</emph> came out of."</p>
                  <p>I fancied, from his manner, that I had not much cause to apprehend the more
                     deadly alternative; and, therefore, I answered, as boldly as I could, that I
                     was quite willing to give my word not to mention that I had seen any of them,
                     nor, at any time or place, attempt to recognize them. "While you are deciding,"
                     I added, "recollect that this suspense between<pb n="228-229"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000115"/> tween life and death is not the most pleasant
                     thing in the world. And, for God's sake," said I, "rather put this hairy
                     gentleman's brace of bullets through my head at once, than leave me shivering
                     another half an hour in the cold." There was a laugh at what I said; those who
                     did not speak English eagerly required it to be translated for them, and then
                     the laugh grew louder, for <emph>all</emph> enjoyed it. "Faith," said the
                     leader, "You're a bold lad to jest in that way, with the muzzle of a pistol
                     against your ear. Make your mind easy; we would not hurt a hair of your head
                     now. Go your way, and keep your promise. No matter when you meet any of us,
                     don't let on that you have ever seen us before. And if you should ever fall in
                     with bad company, in a by-way, on a night like this, just whisper '<hi rend="i"
                     />Barry More' into the ear of any of the party, and you may pass through them
                     as safely as if you were walking in a drawing-room." This said, I had to shake
                     hands, one by one, with each of the party; and they further insisted, with a
                     pertinacity which would not brook denial, that half-a-dozen of them should
                     escort me within a stone's throw of my uncle's house.</p>
                  <p>A few weeks after this rencontre, I saw a man at work in one of my uncle's
                     fields, who seemed not quite a stranger to me. I took care that the
                     recognition, if any, should come from him. Accordingly, though I made the usual
                     remark that it was a fine day, and asked some questions as to the prospects of
                     the crops, I did not seem as if I had ever seen him before. However, he had
                     less discretion, for he said, "That was a narrow escape you had, down by the
                     bog, that night, sir." I asked what he meant? "Oh!" said he, "I do not mind
                     talking to you about it now, for we have your word not to tell on us, and I
                     know very well—for we have friends in every house, who tell us what passes—that
                     not even to your uncle did you say a word about what happened that night. We
                     tried to frighten you a bit, sir, but you stood up better than we expected. I
                     had made up my mind, from the first, that not a hair of your head should be
                     touched; but it was not quite so easy to get the rest of the boys to my way of
                     thinking. They had not the cause that I had for wishing you well."</p>
                  <p>I told him, what was the plain truth, that I had no recollection of any
                     particular cause why <emph>he,</emph> more than any of the rest, should have
                     protected me. "Ah, sir," said he, "people who do a kindness forget it, if the
                     true vein be in them, sooner than those they do the kindness to. You may
                     remember, sir, that about ten years ago, when you were a child, the Master here
                     was very angry with me for having neglected my work, by which the Mistress's
                     garden was quite spoilt, and turned me off, when I had not the chance of
                     getting work anywhere else, and owed a quarter's rent for the little cabin and
                     potatoe garden, and was entirely broke, hand and foot,—aye, and almost heart,
                     too. At that time, sir, you were<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7173-00000116"/> to
                     the fore, with the kind word, which you ever had, to turn away the Master's
                     anger, and you got the Mistress to interfere; and when the Master took me on to
                     work again, it was yourself, sir, that ran down to my little cabin and told me
                     the good news, and sat down at the table, with the children, without any pride,
                     and eat the roasted potato and the salt, and drank the butter-milk out of the
                     same piggin with them. From that hour, sir, if laying down the lives of me and
                     mine would prevent injury to one hair of your head, we would have done it. And
                     that's the reason why your life was safe the other night, and they all granted
                     it when I told them the ins and outs of the story."</p>
                  <p>I saw little more of my champion, for I left that part of the country soon
                     after, and have not been there since.</p>

                  <head>VII. BUCK ENGLISH.</head>
                  <p>SOME eighty years ago, there appeared, in that city of Ireland which is called
                     "the beautiful,"<ref rend="super" target="#note_008" xml:id="return_008"
                        >*</ref> a remarkable character, generally known as Buck English. This
                     name—to which he answered—had been given him, it was said, on account of his
                     fashionable appearance, manners and pursuits, and because his accent clearly
                     indicated that he came from England. At all events, in the year 1770, Buck
                     English was a principal in the fashionable society of Cork—its observed of all
                     observers, its glass of fashion, if not its very mould of form.</p>

                  </note>
                  <p>Buck English had abundance of money, that great test and framer of
                     respectability, and spent it freely. No man knew whence it came. Inquiries had
                     been cautiously ventured upon by inquisitive people, but the only result
                     arrived at was that rarely, if ever, did any remittance reach him through a
                     banker. He frequently performed actions which might be called generous; but the
                     real objects for benevolence, he used to say, were those who struggled to
                     maintain appearances—who bore the arrow in their breast,<pb n="232-233"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000117"/> and did not complain—who would rather die than
                     ask for help; for, as there is no energy like that of despair, there is no
                     pride like that of poverty. Gratitude sometimes <emph>would</emph> speak out;
                     for parties whom his timely, unsought aid had rescued from ruin, meeting him
                     accidentally in public, could not be restrained from breathing blessings on the
                     benefactor whose name they knew not; and the occasional occurrence of such
                     things—which really were <emph>not</emph> got up for display—seemed to
                     authorize the conjecture that Buck English was bountiful in many other
                     instances which were not known. This belief, generally received, operated so
                     much in his favour, that many who would have probably disdained intimacy with
                     one whose personal history was unknown, and who, therefore, might be an
                     adventurer, did not hesitate to receive him at their houses—a concession which
                     others, of more unquestioned station and means, vainly endeavoured to obtain.
                     When stamped "sterling" by the select, no fear of his readily passing into
                     currency with all the rest.</p>
                  <p>Hence, the conclusion may be arrived at, that Buck English was what a facetious
                     friend calls a "populous character." He might have turned the sharp corner of
                     five-and-thirty, and did not look older, even at his worst. Now, whatever
                     five-and-thirty may be for a lady,—forcing on her, I fear, the brevet-rank of
                     "a certain age," with Byron's interpretation,—it is the very prime of manhood.
                     Thus, in this respect, Buck English was as fortunate as others. There was a
                     drawback, it must be confessed—for who can be perfection? This was the
                     circumstance of his possessing features which, except under particular
                     excitement, might be pronounced very ordinary. One might have excused the
                     compressed lips, the sallow cheek, and the sharp face; but the expression of
                     the eyes was not always favourable. It appeared as if they were almost always
                     anxiously on the watch. At times, when strongly excited, while the cheeks
                     remained colourless, and no word breathed from the lips, the passion which
                     created a heart-quake in the man did not allow its presence to be seen, except
                     that it made the eyes flash—conveying the impression that their possessor must
                     be rather dangerous under the influence of strong and deep emotions. It was not
                     often that such manifestations were allowed to become apparent, for Buck
                     English had powerful self-command.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the absence of what is called "good looks," he had succeeded in
                     gaining the favourable opinion of Mary Penrose, a young lady who had recently
                     succeeded to a very considerable property in the vicinity of Cork. Indeed, it
                     was somewhat more than merely her favourable opinion. I will even admit—on the
                     understanding, of course, that it remain an inviolable secret—that Buck English
                     had made a strong impression on the young lady's mind; so much so, that, at the
                     especial period<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7173-00000118"/> at which this
                     narrative introduces her, she was deliberating whether she should frankly admit
                     to him, or deny for a little time longer, that he was master of the heart which
                     fluttered—ah, how anxiously!—within the soft citadel of her bosom.</p>
                  <p>She had met him that evening at a <hi rend="i"/>rout (so they called their
                     fashionable parties in those days), and he had ventured to insinuate, rather
                     more boldly than on any previous occasion, how much his happiness depended upon
                     her. On the point of making a very gentle confession, (have you any idea how
                     admirably blushes can convey what language dare not breathe?) a movement
                     towards the retired part of the saloon in which they sat, apart from the
                     dancers, startled the lady, while the exclamation, "Mary Penrose!—where
                        <emph>can</emph> she be?" informed her that inquiries were being made for
                     her. So, withdrawing her hand from that of her suitor, and making an effort to
                     appear calm and unembarrassed, she awaited the advent of the lady who had
                     spoken. Presently came up her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chaperon,</foreign> a
                     woman of high birth and scanty means, who <emph>condescended</emph> to reside
                     with her. This personage—a mixture of black velvet and bugles, pearl-powder and
                     pretence—gravely regarding Buck English, whom she did not like (because she
                     thought it probable that he might succeed with Miss Penrose, and thereby make
                     her own occupation "gone," like Othello's) said, with a low courtesy, "I am
                     sure, sir, that, had you known what a pleasure you have been depriving Miss
                     Penrose of, you would scarcely have detained her here. Mary, my dear, only
                     think who had arrived!—who but your cousin Frank! He has been in the rooms half
                     an hour, and has been anxiously looking for you everywhere."</p>
                  <p>Before a reply was made the cousin made his appearance, and was received rather
                     formally by Mary. However, Frank Penrose was an Irishman and a lawyer, and
                     therefore not very likely to be put down or taken aback by a cold reception. He
                     was introduced to Buck English, but the greeting between the gentlemen was by
                     no means cordial. Buck English saw a rival; one, too, whom it was said Mary
                     Penrose's father had been desirous to have as a husband for his only child;
                     while cousin Frank, to whom the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chaperon</foreign> had
                     previously communicated the intimacy between the young lady and the dashing
                     stranger, saw at a glance that it would have been quite as well, perhaps, if he
                     had not left her so much in the way of becoming heart-stricken.</p>
                  <p>"Shall I lead you down to supper?" he said. "You know, Mary, that you and I
                     have a hundred things to talk about."</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry, Frank," she answered, "that I cannot take the arm which you offer
                     me gallantly. I had promised my partner, before you came, to avail myself of
                     the advantage of his escort. Madame, I have no doubt, will be happy under your
                     protection, and you can unburthen your mind to her."</p>
                  <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7173-00000119"/>
                  <p>Thus it happened that Mary Penrose retained the arm of Buck English, while
                     Frank was handed over to the dowager.</p>
                  <p>"Confound the fellow!" said he, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign>
                     glancing at his rival. "On what a very familiar footing he has established
                     himself with Mary. Can it be that she, who used to be so hard to please, is
                     smitten with such a face?"</p>
                  <p>"Very likely," said the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chaperon.</foreign> "It was not
                     the countenance, but the mind of Othello, that the bright Venetian was
                     enamoured of. When the manners are agreeable and the intellect quick, the
                     accident of a homely face speedily becomes of no importance. Perhaps it may
                     even help to throw a woman off her guard."</p>
                  <p>"It is a pity," continued Frank, "that I have delayed my return so long. I
                     thought that your letters had exaggerated, if not invented, the danger. Assist
                     me in deposing this gentleman, and my gratitude shall be more than a name. I
                     have always made so certain that Mary was to be my wife, that this
                     over-security had led me to neglect her. At all events, I can tell you that
                     this Mr. English shall not snatch such a prize from me without a struggle. I
                     confess I do not like him."</p>
                  <p>"Naturally enough. He is a rival, and apparently on the way to become a
                     successful one."</p>
                  <p>By this time they had reached the supper-table. Frank Penrose behaved with
                     distant politeness to Buck English, who, as usual, was the centre of
                     conversation versation. As the hour advanced, Mary said to her cousin, "Can you
                     tell me what o'clock it is, Frank? I have been so careless as to let my watch
                     run down."</p>
                  <p>Frank, with a smile, answered, "Two months ago I could have done so; but one of
                     the knights of the road met me in a lonely part of Kilworth Mountain, when last
                     I was going from Cork to Dublin, and relieved me of all care of purse or
                     watch."</p>
                  <p>There was a smile at the cool manner in which the young lawyer related his
                     loss, and then followed inquiry into the circumstances.</p>
                  <p>"A very commonplace highway robbery, I do assure you," said Frank. "All I have
                     to say is, that I was encountered, as I rode on a lonely part of the road, by a
                     gentleman who, taking me quite unprepared, put a pistol to my heart, demanding
                     my cash and other portable property. As I had a foolish desire not to part with
                     it quite so easily, I threw myself off my horse, and closed with my antagonist.
                     His pistol went off in the struggle, without doing me any injury, and I drew my
                     sword. My enemy, who proved himself a better master of that weapon than I was,
                     succeeded in disarming me; forced me to surrender money, watch, and a few
                     rings; mounted on my horse, and rode off, but speedily returned, with the
                     polite assurance that as he never saw a gentleman in distress without wishing
                     to relieve him, he trusted I would accept a<pb n="238-239"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000120"/> few pieces from him, as he presumed I did not
                     intend remaining on the bleak mountain all night, and he knew, from experience,
                     how disagreeable it was to be in a strange inn without money. He handed me five
                     guineas, kindly adding that, if I wanted more, <emph>his</emph> purse—alas! it
                     had been <emph>mine</emph>—was entirely at my service."</p>
                  <p>"Would you know the man again?"</p>
                  <p>"No. His face was partly covered with crape."</p>
                  <p>Supper ended, Miss Penrose and the rest of the ladies retired, escorted to
                     their carriages by the gentlemen, who then returned (it was the evil fashion of
                     the time) to drink their healths in a brimming bumper. One glass led to
                     another, with the usual result—the libations were not to the Goddess of
                     Concord. By accident, the name of Mary Penrose was mentioned, with a
                     congratulatory allusion to the good terms on which Buck English evidently was
                     with her. Frank Penrose started from his chair, and angrily declared that his
                     cousin's name should not be bandied about at a public table, and in
                     conjunction, too, with that of a person of whom no one knew anything, and who,
                     he could assert, was not acceptable to her family. He was about speaking
                     further, when he was pulled down by his friends, who strenuously urged him to
                     keep silent.</p>
                  <p>Buck English remained so quiet under the intentionally offensive allusion to
                     himself, that some of the company began to think him deficient in courage age.
                     The Irish way of answering an insult, in those days, was to throw a glass full
                     of wine in the offender's face, and follow that up by flinging the decanter at
                     his head. After a pause, Frank Penrose, whom nobody could restrain, repeated
                     the insult in other and harsher words. This broke up the party. As they were
                     leaving the table, Buck English leant across, and said, very quietly, "Mr.
                     Penrose, for the lady's sake, I would not mix up her name with a midnight brawl
                     in a tavern, but you are aware that your words must be withdrawn or atoned
                     for?"</p>
                  <p>"Take them as you please," said Penrose. "I stand by them."</p>
                  <p>"Then," answered the other, "I name Captain Cooper as my friend. Whom shall he
                     meet on your part, and where?"</p>
                  <p>Pausing for a minute, during which he considered his course of action, Penrose
                     said that in two days he expected a friend whose services he could command on
                     such a business, and hoped the delay would not be inconvenient. His antagonist
                     intimated his assent by a distant bow, and thus, in far less time than I have
                     been writing about it, was appointed a meeting for life or death. The outward
                     show of civility was maintained during the short time that they remained in the
                     room, though feelings of deadliest enmity rankled beneath that smooth
                     surface.</p>
                  <p>As they were retiring, Penrose and English<pb n="240-241"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000121"/> again were together, and the latter took
                     advantage of this contiguity to ask at what time his friend should call upon
                     Mr. Penrose's second?</p>
                  <p>"At ten on Thursday morning, at Daly's clubhouse."</p>
                  <p>"Very well, and for whom shall he inquire?"</p>
                  <p>"Let him ask for Mr. D'Arcy Mahon, the barrister."</p>
                  <p>At that name, English shrunk or swerved as from a blow.</p>
                  <p>"D'Arcy Mahon!" he repeated.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Penrose. "Have you any objection to the gentleman?"</p>
                  <p>"None."</p>
                  <p>On that they separated.</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>That evening, on returning home, Mary Penrose applied herself, in the solitude
                     of her chamber—the young heart's confessional—to serious thought upon that
                     beleaguered and endangered Sebastopol, the state of her affections. It was
                     evident that her cousin was piqued at the idea of her having a preference for
                     English, and that his arrival was likely to bring the affair to an issue. Mary
                     paused for some time in doubt as to the course she should pursue. She had a
                     regard for her cousin Frank; but she confessed to herself, with conscious blush
                     and sigh, that she had other and more cherished feelings for English. It is
                     proverbial how a woman's deliberations, in an affair of the heart, invariably
                     end; and so, having made up her mind in favour of Buck English, by far the most
                     delightful companion—although not quite the handsomest—fate had thrown in her
                     way, she retired to rest.</p>
                  <p>As she was unloosing the golden beauty of her luxuriant tresses, glancing now
                     and then at a flower given to her by <emph>him,</emph> and carefully put into a
                     water vase on her dressing-room table, Mary Penrose heard a faint tap at the
                     window. Withdrawing the curtain, she saw, in the pale moonlight, the face of
                     him who, even then, was occupying her thoughts. He held up a note in his hand,
                     which he placed upon the window-sill, and disappeared as suddenly as he had
                     come before her.</p>
                  <p>Opening the casement, she took the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">billet,</foreign>
                     and eagerly read it. In the strongest and most beseeching words, it urged her
                     to speak with the writer for a few minutes;—hinted that this would be the last
                     time they would ever meet;—and plainly declared that it related to an affair of
                     life-and-death emergency. The urgency of this appeal, as well as her natural
                     desire to see one in whom, now more than ever, she felt a deep interest,
                     prevailed, and Mary Penrose, throwing a large shawl over her hastily-adjusted
                     attire, quitted her chamber, silently proceeded down stairs, and opened the
                     hall-door, at which she found<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7173-00000122"/>
                     English waiting. Light of body and active of limb, he had found little
                     difficulty in ascending to Mary's window, by means of the thick ivy which
                     luxuriantly covered the front of the house, and his descent had been yet more
                     easily accomplished.</p>
                  <p>When alone with Mary in one of the apartments in which she had frequently
                     received him as a visitor, Buck English appeared overwhelmed by emotion.
                     Quickly recovering himself, he addressed her in this manner:—"I have to thank
                     your kindness, Miss Penrose, for thus giving me the opportunity of taking leave
                     of you. I am a dishonoured man, or shall be, and most publicly, too, if
                     to-morrow sees me near this place. After you had retired this evening, your
                     cousin Frank fixed a personal quarrel upon me, which I endeavoured to avoid by
                     acting and speaking with the greatest forbearance. I named the friend who would
                     act for me in a matter so unpleasant, and your cousin asked for a slight delay
                     until the arrival of the gentleman who would perform the like offices for him.
                     The person whom he named is D'Arcy Mahon,—one of the few men in this country,
                     under existing circumstances, who must not see me, because I have the very
                     strongest motives for avoiding him. Our meeting was fixed for Thursday, but I
                     have just heard of Mr. Mahon's arrival, not an hour ago, which is two days
                     earlier than Frank expected him."</p>
                  <p>"I need not assure you," said Mary, "how very much grieved I am that there
                     should be any difference ence between two persons whom I esteem so much—between
                     yourself and Frank. But I know that Mr. Mahon is a most honourable man, and
                     more likely to pacify than irritate any parties who are placed in his hands
                     with hostile feelings to each other."</p>
                  <p>"There lives not the man," replied English, somewhat haughtily, "who can say
                     that I have at any time shrunk from giving or seeking the satisfaction which,
                     in our strangely-constituted state of society, gentlemen must sometimes require
                     or grant. But it is impossible that I can meet D'Arcy Mahon—whose high
                     character I appreciate and esteem—on any terms, or under any circumstances,
                     without his instantly and fatally recognizing me as one whom he has met before,
                     under a darker and different aspect of affairs."</p>
                  <p>"You astonish and alarm me!" said Mary. "Will you not remove the veil from this
                     mystery?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said he, after some deliberation. "It is a sad confidence, but
                        <emph>you</emph> are entitled to it. You have heard of a person who is
                     generally known as Captain Spranger?"</p>
                  <p>Mary said that she certainly had heard of the terror of travellers, the head of
                     a band of highwaymen, who had infested the South of Ireland for the previous
                     two years.</p>
                  <p>"The same. That man, outlawed as he is, with a price upon his head, I have
                     reason to know is the younger son of one of the first commoners in England<pb
                        n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7173-00000123"/> land. Evil example and youthful
                     impatience of control alienated him from his friends early in life, and sent
                     him abroad upon the world, in different countries and among many grades of
                     society, but not always in companionship with those by whom he could profit, in
                     mind, body, or estate. At the close of many wanderings he found himself in
                     Ireland, and accidentally became the companion or guest of a party of
                     smugglers, who were banded together in the county of Waterford, and who, by
                     their audacity and success, had challenged the notice of the Executive.
                     Unfortunately, at the very period when the Englishman's love of wild adventure
                     had thrown him into the society of these smugglers—as it had often led him to
                     spend a night in a gipsy encampment—at that very time treachery had betrayed
                     the band, who were surrounded by a strong military force before they knew they
                     were in danger. To fight their way through this armed array, was what the
                     smugglers determined on at the moment. Unwilling to remain and be captured, the
                     chance-visitor of the night joined in the sortie, and made a dash for freedom.
                     Some effected their escape without hurt, a few were wounded, some were
                     captured. The Englishman was among the prisoners. The Assizes were at hand, and
                     as it was thought fit to make an example, as it is called, the trial of the
                     smugglers was hurried on. The evidence against the Englishman was conclusive.
                     He was found in armed array against the military, and in company with notorious
                     law-breakers. What could he do? Pride made him conceal his name, he was
                     indicted under that of Spranger (which he had never borne), was tried and
                     convicted. When brought up to receive sentence in the assize court of Clonmel
                     (where, for some reason, the trial took place), he thought he saw the
                     opportunity for a bold effort. Light, active and strong, he vaulted out of the
                     dock. The crowd instantly opened to conceal him, for there is a strong sympathy
                     for persons accused of such breaches against the revenue law as he was believed
                     to have committed. Even while he was crouching down in the midst of the crowd,
                     a great-coat, such as the peasantry wear, was thrown around him by one; another
                     bestowed upon him a cap made of fox-skin; and a third whispered him to keep
                     quiet, as, if he did not betray himself, his disguise was sufficient to defy
                     suspicion and detection.<ref rend="super" target="#note_009"

                     <p><ref target="#return_009">*</ref>Such an escape as this was actually made
                        from the dock, during the Clonmel assizes, by the bold and notorious Buck
                        English, who afterwards found his way into the first society in Cork city
                        and county. Indeed, the actual life of this man was parallel in many of its
                        leading points to that of "Paul Clifford," the hero of Bulwer's brilliant
                        fiction. The term "Buck" was usually bestowed on any fashionable bravo, in
                        Ireland, who wore dashing attire, and indulged in all sorts of extravagances
                        of expenditure and excess. There was "Buck Sheehy" of Dublin, as well as our
                        own "Buck English" of Cork. Indeed. there were sufficient of the <foreign
                           xml:lang="LAT">genus</foreign> in Dublin to form the majority of the
                        "Hell-fire Club," who once set fir to their club-room, and remained in it
                        until the flames actually burned the hair from their heads and the clothes
                        from their bodies. This was done to decide the punishments of a future
                        state! Most of the "Bucks" were men of family, education, and wealth.
                        Several peers were members of the community. At one time (the author of
                        "Ireland sixty years ago," relates) there were three noblemen, brothers, so
                        notorious for their outrages, that they acquired singular names, as
                        indicative of their characters. The first was the terror of every one who
                        met him in public places—the second was seldom out of prison—the third was
                        lame, yet no whit disabled from his Buckish achievements. They were
                        universally known by the names of "Hell-gate," "Newgate," and "Cripplegate."
                        There were two brothers, one of whom had shot his friend, and the other
                        stabbed his coachman. They were distinguished as "Kill-Kelly" and
                        Kill-coachy." This reminds one of the Irish traveller, who said he had been
                        to <hi rend="i"/>Kill-many and was going to <hi rend="i"/>Kill-more.</p>

                  <p>"Incredible as it may appear—but I perceive that you have already heard
                     something of this affair—Spranger remained in the court-house during the whole
                     day, while a strict out-of-doors' search was made for him, and finally walked
                     into the street, unchallenged, with the rest of the crowd, when the trials
                     ended. He was literally alone, unfriended, penniless, in a strange country. The
                     men who had supplied him, on the impulse of the moment, with the means of
                     baffling detection, kept their eyes upon, and speedily came in his way, giving
                     him the further ther aid of shelter and food. What need I more say than that
                     those men, who lived against the law, succeeded in enrolling their guest among
                     them. Recklessness and utter want, in the first instance, and the fear of being
                     given up to the Government in the other, were his motives. Coupled with this,
                     too, was a strong sense of injury at having been convicted, without crime, upon
                     appearances. Not then, but many times afterwards, did he feel convinced that
                     the Executive had brought him to trial only upon obvious and palpable facts.
                     But, long before he came to take this view of the question, he had become
                     leader of the band—now avowedly associated for plunder, smuggling having been
                     broken up, and the name and the daring of Captain Spranger are sufficiently
                     notorious throughout the country now.</p>
                  <p>"When he had completely identified himself with them, so as to obtain their
                     unquestioning obedience, Spranger availed himself of the privilege of sometimes
                     leaving them for a short time—continuing, however, to regulate their movements,
                     and participate in their gains—one of them always remaining with him to act as
                     his servant, but actually as an unsuspected channel of communication with the
                     band. Thus this captain of men beyond the pale of the law, has resided, at
                     different times, in the principal cities in the South of Ireland. His last
                     resting-place was here in Cork, where, under a name<pb n="248-249"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000125"/> rather given to him by common consent than
                     assumed by him, and with ample pecuniary means at his command, he contrived to
                     be received into the best society. But he had tired, long since, of the
                     ruffianly association which he headed. One hope remained—that of offering his
                     sword to one of the foreign States with whom he had formerly performed military
                     service, and thus resuming the condition to which he was born. But, while
                     taking measures to do this, he met, and became deeply enamoured of the
                     loveliest and most engaging of her sex, and delayed his departure—his
                     exile—from a reluctance to quit the heaven of her smiles. Perhaps he even
                     presumed to hope—to trust—that, under better circumstances, he might even have
                     ventured to hope that his suit would not have failed."</p>
                  <p>Here he paused, to mark how Mary had borne this relation. Her face was covered
                     with her hands—but he could hear that she was sobbing. He continued:—</p>
                  <p>"You know, Mary, I perceive, that he who relates this story is the same
                     Spranger whose name has made many a cheek pale, many a bold heart tremble.
                     D'Arcy Mahon was one of the counsel employed against me at Clonmel, and he
                     knows every feature of mine so well that he could not fail to recognize me. He
                     would identify me, also, as Captain Spranger. If I remain, he meets me
                     to-morrow. Shame, disgrace, perhaps even death would follow. 'T is true that
                     circumstances have made me what I am, but there is a Future, in action, for all
                     who are willing to atone for past misconduct. I go forth to try and regain the
                     position I have forfeited. Not in this country, nor yet in my own, can I hope
                     to do this. But there other lands where Reputation and Fortune may be won, and
                     in one of them I shall make the effort. To have known <emph>you</emph>—to find
                     this wasted heart capable, even yet, of appreciating the beauty and purity of
                     your mind, will console me in my long and distant exile. Farewell!"</p>
                  <p>He bent on his knee to take and kiss that delicate hand. Did it really linger
                     in his? He looked upon that face of beauty. Did those violet eyes smile upon
                     him through the dew which diamonded their long, dark fringes? He heard a low,
                     earnest whisper. Did it tell him to retrieve the past, nor doubt, while doing
                     so, of the due reward a loving heart will bestow? Did it softly say that he,
                     and none but he, should hold that hand in marriage? Did it entreat him to write
                     often—always hopingly? A long, long kiss on those ripe lips, on that damasked
                     cheek, on that fair brow, and Buck English was away, as suddenly as he had
                     come.</p>

                  <p>The morning after the interview between Mary and her lover, considerable
                     anxiety was caused in the minds of his acquaintance by the fact of his
                     disappearance, and the report that he had met with some fatal accident. His
                     horse had returned home riderless, and a hat and glove, known to have been worn
                     by him, were found on the banks of the Lee, about two miles from Cork, a place
                     where he was fond of riding at all hours. It was believed that he had been
                     drowned. The authorities took possession of and examined his effects, which
                     were never claimed. There was not one line of writing among them, giving the
                     slightest clue to his station in life, family, or identity. In a short time, he
                     passed out of the memory of most of those who had known him.</p>
                  <p>It was noticed that Mary Penrose appeared very much unconcerned at the loss of
                     one for whom she was believed to have felt some partiality. She was abused, of
                     course, by her own sex, (and the more so, as she was very handsome,) for being
                     "a heartless coquette." A few months later, when she had attained her legal
                     majority, and with it full possession of her property, she unequivocally
                     astonished her cousin Frank, by declining his proffered hand. Ere the year was
                     ended, her estates were in the market, and their purchase-money invested in
                     foreign securities. This done, Mary bade a long farewell to the land of her
                     nativity and the friends of her youth. Nor did any definite account of her
                     subsequent life ever reach Ireland.</p>
                  <p>In the fulness of time, there came rumours (which were credited) that somebody
                     very like Buck English had obtained rank and reputation in the German service,
                     and that, eventually retiring to a distant province of the Empire, he had
                     turned his sword into a ploughshare, and cultivated, with much success, a large
                     estate which he had purchased there. It was added that a lady, whose personal
                     description tallied with Mary Penrose's appearance, was the wife of this
                     person; that they lived very happily with their numerous children around them;
                     that their retainers and dependents almost adored them for their constant and
                     considerate kindness; and that, though they ever condemned crime, they united
                     in questioning whether he who committed it might not have been led into it by
                     Circumstance rather than Desire.</p>

                  <head>THE BARD O'KELLY.</head>
                  <p>FOR many years, an individual, calling himself "The Bard O'Kelly," wandered
                     through the South of Ireland, subsisting on the exacted hospitality and the
                     enforced contributions of such as happened to be so weak as to dread being put
                     by him into a couplet of satirical doggerel, and thus held up to public scorn,
                     as wanting in liberality. An Irishman, be it known, will not submit to an
                     imputation upon his generosity; rather than have <emph>that</emph> questioned,
                     he will give away his last sixpence, though the gift leave him without food.
                     O'Kelly was shrewd enough to know this, and like the ale which Boniface so much
                     praises in Farquhar's comedy, he "fed purely upon it"—in fact, it was meat,
                     drink, clothing and lodging to him.</p>
                  <p>Until he published his "poems," no one knew on what very slight grounds his
                     Bardship rested. His book—a thin, ill-printed octavo, called "The
                     Hippocrene,"—appeared, with a dedication, by permission, to "the most noble and
                     warlike Marquis of Anglesea," and underneath the inscription is the
                        quatrain,<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7173-00000129"/>

                  <p>The lake here alluded to, is that of Killarney. In the year 1791, O'Kelly wrote
                     what he called "a Poem" on the romantic scenery of Killarney. It was written,
                     but not published—recited by the bard, as the Iliad and Odyssey are said to
                     have been by "the blind old man of Scio's rocky isle,"—handed about in
                     manuscript among friends, like much of the verse of the present day, when
                     (because every third man is an author) hard-hearted booksellers refuse to
                     purchase valueless copyrights, or even to publish them, save at the sole
                     expense and risk of the writers.</p>
                  <p>So, in 1791, was written, not published, the Bard's "Killarney,"—a poem which
                     (as <emph>he</emph> was wont to speak of it) "has all the depth of the lake it
                     immortalizes, with the clearness, freshness, and sparkling flow of its waters!"
                     It may be thought a little egotistical for O'Kelly thus to praise his own
                     writings—but, surely, a man is the best judge of his own merit, and best
                     acquainted with his own talents. I put it to every man of sense—that is, to
                     every person who completely coincides with my opinion,—whether, if a man does
                     not think and speak well of himself, it can possibly be expected that any one
                     else will? No; O'Kelly's self-praise was only a flourish to remind people what
                     a genius they had among them—a Laputan flap to make the Irish world quite aware
                     of the fact of his immeasurable merit.</p>
                  <p>There was a rumour—but I hate scandal—that the Bard (being a poet, and lame to
                     boot, like the Grecian) had an ambition to be the new Tyrtæus of the Irish
                     Rebels, in 1798. He has been seen to smile, rather assentingly, at "the soft
                     impeachment," although, no doubt, while the insurgents were liable to
                     punishment, he had very <emph>capital</emph> reasons for denying it. While the
                     Civil War was raging, he went to the north-east of Ireland, and, his enemies
                     say, with rebellious designs. But his own assertion, <q>
                        <l>("And truths divine came mended from <emph>his</emph> lips,")</l>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7173-00000130"/> was, that the sole object of his
                     tour was to compose a poem on the sublimities of the Giant's Causeway. Such a
                     composition was written—for I have read it. But the greatest and best of
                     men—from Socrates down to O'Kelly—have been subjected to suspicion and
                     persecution, and it happened that when the Bard showed himslf in the north, he
                     was taken up by the King's forces, and summarily committed to prison on
                     suspicion that his visit was occasioned by a desire to discover a snug
                     landing-place, on the Antrim coast, for the French—who, at that time, were
                     about invading Ireland.</p>
                  <p>Bad news travels very quickly. It soon was noised about Kerry, that the Bard
                     had been taken up. As a story, like a snow-ball, increases as it travels, it
                     was even added that the Bard had been—<emph>hanged!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>On this, a wretch named Michael M'Carthy—a Macroom man was this Bathyllus to
                     the Hibernian Maro—constituted himself heir-at-law and residuary legatee to the
                     Bard's poetical effects, and, not having the fear of Apollo's vengeance before
                     his eyes, had the barefaced audacity to publish eight hundred and forty lines
                     of "Killarney," mixed up with certain versicles of his own, under the imposing
                     name of "Lacus Delectabilis."</p>
                  <p>The Bard O'Kelly heard of this audacious appropriation at the very hour when
                     his trial was coming on, and it took such effect upon his spirits that, to use
                     his own figurative language, he "did not know at the time, whether he was
                     standing on his head or his heels."</p>
                  <p>Brought for trial before a military tribunal, quick in decision and sharp in
                     execution, there was so much presumptive evidence against him, that he was
                     convicted without much delay, (his judges were in a hurry to dine,) and
                     sentenced to be hanged early the next day.</p>
                  <p>The emergency of the case restrung his shattered energies. Recovering the use
                     of his tongue, he made a heart-rending appeal to the Court Martial; narrated
                     the vile plagiarism which had been committed on his beautiful and beloved
                     Killarney; recited a hundred lines of that sonorous composition, and concluded
                     a very energetic harangue, by requesting "leave of absence," for a few weeks,
                     in order that he might proceed to Kerry, there to punish M'Carthy, for his dire
                     offence against all the recognized rules of authorship. He even tendered his
                     own bail for his reappearance to be hanged, as soon as, by performing an act of
                     signal justice towards the plagiarist, he had vindicated that fame which, he
                     said, was of more value to him than life.</p>
                  <p>The manner and matter of this extraordinary address—such as never, before nor
                     since, was spoken in a Court of Justice—were so extraordinary that the
                     execution of the sentence was postponed. When<pb n="260-261"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000131"/> the Civil War was over, the Bard was liberated.
                     "It was a great triumph for my eloquence," was his usual self-complacent
                     expression, in after life, when speaking of this hair-breadth escape. To this
                     day, however, there are some who hint that the Court considered him <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">non compos mentis</foreign>—too much of a fool to be a
                     traitor and conspirator—and were merciful accordingly.</p>
                  <p>When O'Kelly returned home, he did not annihilate M'Carthy in the body—he did
                     so in spirit: he lampooned him. Finally, the plagiarist made a public apology;
                     and an armistice was effected by the aid of copious libations of the
                     "mountain-dew," the favourite Hippocrene of Irishmen.</p>
                  <p>The Bard's trip to the Giant's Causeway gave him a wonderful inclination for
                     travelling. As itinerary rhyme-spinner, he continued to keep body and soul
                     together ever since, in a manner which nothing but the brilliant invention of a
                     verse-making Milesian could have dreamed of. Under the face of the sun no
                     people so keenly appreciate, and so undeniably dread, satire as the Irish do.
                     Few, it may be added, have greater powers in that line—and this without being
                     imbued with less good-nature or more malice than other people. They
                     particularly shrink from any imputation on their open-handed and open-hearted
                     hospitality. The Bard O'Kelly knew that this sensitive feeling was the blot
                     which he was to hit. And on the results of this knowledge, he contrived trived
                     to live well—to obtain raiment, money, lodging, food, and drink, during the
                     vicissitudes of about forty years.</p>
                  <p>He committed himself to a pilgrimage from place to place, through Ireland,
                     always fixing his head-quarters at the residence of some country gentleman.
                     Here he would abide for a week—a fortnight—or even a month, if he liked his
                     quarters, and thought his intrusion would be tolerated so long. During his
                     stay, his two horses, his son (for, being Irish, he had got married very soon),
                     and himself, always lived "in clover." His valedictory acknowledgment, by which
                     he considered that he repaid the hospitality extended to him, was a laudatory
                     couplet! If there were, or if there seemed to be, the slightest want of
                     cordiality in his reception or entertainment, he would immediately depart,
                     giving the delinquent to immortal infamy in a stinging couplet. When he had
                     written a few score of these rhymes he used to get them printed (ballad-wise)
                     on octavo slips of whity-brown paper, and each new page was added to its
                     predecessor, by being pasted into a sort of scrap-book. This collection he
                     called his "Poetic Tour," and he had only a single copy of it; and to this
                     which he promised to have printed in a regular book, at some future period,
                     every one who entertained him was expected to subscribe from a crown to a
                        guinea—<emph>subscriptions payable in advance.</emph> To this rule he had
                     permitted only one exception. This was<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7173-00000132"
                     /> early in the present century, when the Chevalier Ruspini, (a tooth and corn
                     extractor,) who travelled in Ireland as "Dentist to the Prince of Wales,"
                     subscribed, in the name of his Royal master, for fifty copies of the work; and,
                     on the strength of this, managed to dine, on three several occasions, with
                     O'Kelly—being the only instance on record of his Bardship having ever played
                     the host.</p>
                  <p>I knew O'Kelly personally, when I was a lad, having met him, for the first
                     time, at Drewscourt, in the county of Limerick, whither he came, purposely, to
                     remain one day <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en passant,</foreign> but did us the
                     honour of staying for a fortnight. He made his first appearance at dinner-time,
                     and his knife and fork were wielded as effectively as if he had not used them
                     during the preceding month. Until I saw O'Kelly feed, I had never realized the
                     description of Major Dalgetty's laying in "provend" not only to make good the
                     dinner he should have eaten yesterday, but to provide for the wants of to-day
                     and to-morrow. In the course of the evening he exhibited other manifestations
                     of industry and genius. He complained of labouring under a cold, which he
                     undertook to cure by a peculiar process. This was no less than by imbibing
                     about a dozen tumblers of hot and strong whiskey-punch, without moving from his
                     seat. This, he assured us, was "a famous remedy for all distempers; good,"
                     added he, "for a cure, and magnificent as a preventive." He condescended to
                     inform us that, well or sick, this quantity was his regular allowance after
                     dinner—when he could get it.</p>
                  <p>He was loquacious in his cups. The subject of the Royal visit to Ireland, in
                     1821, having been broached, O'Kelly produced a printed account of his own
                     interview with the monarch. This, he told us, had appeared in a newspaper
                     called the Roscommon Gazette, and it was not difficult to guess at whose
                     instance it had gained publicity. The account which he read for us was rather
                     an improved edition, he said, as his friend, the Roscommon editor, had
                     ruthlessly cut out some of the adjectives and superlatives. What he read was to
                     this effect, accompanied with his own running commentary of explanation and
                     remark:— <q>
                        <p>"'THE BARD O'KELLY AND THE KING.'"</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>"You see, gentlemen, that I put myself first. Genius (he pronounced it <foreign

                           xml:id="VAC7173-00000133"/> to His Majesty's taste, that his very first
                        inquiry, on entering the Vice-regal lodge, in Phœnix Park, was after that
                        honour to our country, our renowned Bard, to whose beautiful productions he
                        had subscribed, for fifty copies, many years ago.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>"Yes, gentlemen, he knew all about me. As he had inquired for <emph>me,</emph>
                     I thought I could not do less, in course of common civility, than indulge
                        <emph>him</emph> with the pleasure of a visit. But you shall hear:—</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"When the Bard reached Dublin, and heard of His Majesty's most kind and
                        friendly inquiries, he sent a most polite autograph note, written with his
                        own hand, to Sir Benjamin Bloomfield, announcing his own arrival, wishing
                        His Majesty joy on <emph>his,</emph> and requesting Sir Benjamin to appoint
                        a day, mutually convenient to the many important engagements of the Poet and
                        the Monarch, when an interview between these distinguished personages should
                        take place. With that true politeness and chivalrous courtesy which adorn
                        and distinguish the Bard, he notified that, the King being a stranger, the
                        Bard was willing to waive ceremony, and wait upon him, to present a copy of
                        his highly poetical poems, for fifty copies of which the Chevalier Ruspini
                        had subscribed, on behalf of His Majesty, when Prince of Wales.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>"Indeed, they were to have been dedicated to him, but, as yet, I have not had
                     but the one copy, which I have made up from the slips which have been
                     separately printed, from time to time. Kind gentlemen, reading always makes me
                     drouthy;—may-be, one of ye will mix a tumbler for me?—not too strong of the
                     water;—christen the spirit, but don't drown it. Ah, that will do! What a flavor
                     it has!</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"An answer was immediately sent by three servants in royal livery,
                        requesting, if perfectly agreeable to O'Kelly, that he would do His Majesty
                        the favour of a friendly visit, the next day at four o'clock.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>"So I sent word to say that I'd be with him punctual. The next day I dressed
                     myself very neat, put on my other shirt, gave my coat a brushing (a thing I
                     don't often do, as it takes the nap off the cloth), brightened the brass
                     buttons with a bit of chamois leather, went over the seams with a little
                     vinegar and ink, polished my boots, so that you'd see your likeness in them
                     like a looking-glass, had myself elegantly shaved, and to the King I went. But
                     you shall hear:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"To this proposition the Bard politely assented, and went to the Castle of
                        Dublin, at the appointed hour, the next day. There he sent his card to the
                        King, with his compliments; and Sir Benjamin Bloomfield immediately came
                        down the Grand Staircase, and, with a most gracious message from His
                        Majesty, handed him a fifty-pound bank-note, as the royal subscription to
                        his admirable poems.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>"I won't deny that the sight and touch of the money were mighty pleasant; but I
                     said nothing. It was a larger sum than ever I had at any one time before, for
                        <emph>my</emph> riches have always been of the head, rather than of the
                     purse. I put the bank-note into my waistcoat-pocket, fastened it safely there
                     with a<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7173-00000134"/> pin I took out of my cuff,
                     and then—mind, not until <emph>then</emph>—I told Sir Benjamin——But I'll read
                     it:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"O'Kelly (with that noble disregard for lucre which always distinguished our
                        eminently patriotic, poetic, high-minded, much accomplished, and
                        generous-hearted countryman) immediately told Sir Benjamin, that he would
                        rather relinquish the money than abandon the anticipated pleasure of a
                        personal interview with his Sovereign.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>"Mind—I had the fifty pounds snug in my pocket all the while. You may be
                     certain that I wouldn't have spoken that way <emph>before</emph> fingering the
                     cash.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"On this most disinterested and loyal determination having been mentioned to
                        His Majesty, he was so delighted with it, that he desired the Bard to be
                        ushered instantly into the Grand Hall of Audience. This was done, and there
                        the Most Noble the Marquis of Congynham had the honour of introducing His
                        Majesty to the Poet.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>"Wasn't it a grand sight! There was the King on his throne, and all the great
                     officers of State standing around him. In one hand the King held a sceptre of
                     pure gold, and the other was stretched out to receive my book. On his head he
                     wore a crown of gold, studded all over with jewels, and weighing half a hundred
                     weight, at the very least. On his breast, in the place where a diamond star is
                     usually represented in the portraits, His Majesty wore a bunch of shamrock, the
                     size of a cauliflower. Now you'll hear what occurred:—</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"Compliments being exchanged, the King descended from his throne, and had
                        the pleasure of introducing the Marchioness of Conyngham, and all the other
                        Ladies of the Bedchamber, to the Bard. His Majesty, then—returning to his
                        throne, and insisting that the Bard should occupy an arm-chair by his right
                        side—said, "Mr. O'Kelly"——"O'KELLY, without the <emph>Mister,</emph> if you
                        please," said the Bard," Your Majesty would not say Mr. Shakspeare or Mr.
                        Milton.' "True enough," said the King, "I sit corrected: I beg your pardon,
                        O'Kelly. I should have known better. Well, then, O'Kelly, I am quite sure
                        that I shall be delighted with your beautiful poems, when I've time to read
                        them." To this the Bard replied, "Your Majesty never spoke a truer word. I
                        believe they'd delight and instruct any one. At this intelligent, and most
                        correct observation, his Majesty was pleased to smile. He then added, "I'm
                        sorry to see, by your iron leg, that you are lame." O'Kelly, with that ready
                        wit for which he is as remarkable as he is for his modesty, instantly
                        replied, "If I halt in my leg, I don't in my verses, for <q>
                           <lg type="quotation">

                           </lg>
                        </q> It is impossible for words to describe the thunders of applause by
                        which this beautiful extempore impromptu was followed.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>'I knew, well enough, that something smart would be expected from a man like
                     me; so I went prepared with several impromptus, to be introduced when the
                     occasion would allow.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"His Majesty then said, "It is really remarkable that you, and my friend
                        Walter Scott, should both be lame." The Bard replied, "And Lord Byron also."
                        His Majesty then observed, "It is a wonderful coincidence—the three great
                        poets of the three kingdoms." At the request of the Marquis of Conyngham<pb
                           n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7173-00000135"/> ham, the Bard then made the
                        following extemporaneous epigram on the spot, off hand, on this interesting
                        subject: <q>
                           <l>'Three poets for three sister kingdoms born,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>"That's England, Ireland, and Scotland:— <q>

                  <q>
                     <p>"His Majesty was quite electrified at the ready wit displayed in this
                        beautiful impromptu, and took leave of the Bard in the most affectionate and
                        gracious manner. It is whispered among the fashionable circles, that O'Kelly
                        has declined the offer of a Baronetcy, made to him by command of the
                        Sovereign.'</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>"Indeed," said the Bard, in conclusion, "the King and me were mutually pleased
                     with each other. I'd have had myself made a Baronet, like Scott, but I have not
                     the dirty acres to keep up the dignity. 'T is my private notion, if the King
                     had seen me first, I'd have had ten times the money he sent me. Well, he's
                     every inch a King, and here's his health."</p>

                  <p>You may judge, from what he printed and what he spoke, whether the modesty of
                     the Bard was not equal to his genius. It is a fact, I understand, that he
                     actually made his way to an audience with George the Fourth; he must have
                     rather astonished his Majesty. In his later years the Bard fluctuated between
                     Cork and Limerick (in the last-named city of "beautiful lasses," he had a
                     daughter very well married),<ref rend="super" target="#note_010"
                        xml:id="return_010">*</ref> and, wherever he might be, was open to algebraic
                     donations of strong drink—that is, "any <emph>given</emph> quantity."</p>

                        In Lancashire, there is something like this in the familiar manner in which
                        the natives speak of "Wigan <emph>chaps,</emph> Bolton <emph>fellows,</emph>

                  <p>Such a fungus as the Bard O'Kelly could only have been produced in and
                     tolerated by a very peculiar state of society. Out of Ireland he would have
                     starved—unless he followed a different vocation. He was partly laughed at,
                     partly feared. Satire was his weapon. His manners, attire, and conversation,
                     would scarcely be endured now in the servants' hall; yet, even as lately as
                     twenty years ago, he forced his way into the company of respectable people—aye,
                     and got not only hospitality from them, but <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >douceurs</foreign> of wearing apparel and money. One comfort is, such a
                     person would have little chance in Ireland, now.</p>
                  <p>The Bard O'Kelly died about fifteen years ago, having lived in clover for more
                     than forty years, by<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7173-00000136"/> appealing to
                     the vanity or the fears of those whom he made his tributaries. Until he
                     published, in 1831, the world took it for granted, that even as <emph>he</emph>
                     said, he had some poetic talent. The list of subscribers to his volume had
                     between seven and eight hundred names, including ladies, peers of the realm,
                     and members of Parliament. The "Bard's" want of ability was companioned by want
                     of principle—for two, at least, of the poems which he published as his own,
                     were written by others. One, commencing, "My life is like the summer rose," is
                     the composition of R. H. Wilde, a distinguished American man of letters; and
                     another, beginning "On beds of snow the moonbeams slept," has been
                        <emph>conveyed</emph> from the early poems of a writer named—Thomas Moore.
                     There is cool intrepidity in pilfering from a poet so universally known as
                     Moore. When Scott visited Ireland, he was waited on by O'Kelly with the same
                     "extempore impromptu" he had inflicted on George IV., years before, and
                     (Lock-hart relates) compelled the Ariosto of the North to pay the usual
                     tribute—by subscribing to his poems.</p>
                  <p>There are scores of Irishmen now in New York, who were personally acquainted
                     with O'Kelly, and can testify to the accuracy—I might even say the moderation,
                     of my description of him.</p>

                     him—spoken to him—dined with him. The Father Prout, however, of real life was
                     very different from him of the Prout Papers. He was parish-priest of
                     Watergrass-hill, midway between the city of Cork and the town of Fermoy—a
                     locality known as the highest arable land in Ireland. Prout was one of the old
                     priests who, when it was penal for a Catholic clergyman to exist in Ireland,
                     picked up the elements of his education how he could, completed it at a foreign
                     university, and came back to Ireland, a priest, to administer the consolations
                     of religion to the peasantry of his native land. Sometimes, the Catholic priest
                     evidenced to the last, in conduct and manners, that his youth had been passed
                     in countries in which social civilization had extended further than in Ireland.
                     Sometimes, the learning and the polish which had been acquired abroad were
                     forgotten at home—as the sword loses its brightness from disuse—and, living
                     much among the peasantry, the priest lost a part of the finer courtesy of the
                     gentleman, and assumed the roughness of the bulk of his parishioners. Wherever
                     there was a resident Protestant landowner, the Priest of the olden time
                     instinctively formed friendly relations with him—for, at that time, the
                     priestly order was not invariably supplied from the peasantry, and tolerance
                     was more declared and practiced by members of all persuasions, in Ireland, at
                     that time than it is now. Prout was literally a "round, fat, oily man of God."
                     He had a hand small as a woman's, and was very proud of it. He had an
                     unconquerable spirit of good-humour, and it was utterly impossible for any one
                     to be in his company for ten minutes without feeling and basking in the
                     sunshine of his buoyant and genial good-nature. Of learning he had very little.
                     I do not know what his share might have been half a century before, when he was
                     fresh from Douay or the Sorbonne, but few traces were left in his latter years.
                     In the society of his equals or his superiors, Prout could keep up the
                     shuttlecock of conversation as well as any one, and in the fashion of the place
                     and class, but he was equally at home amid the festivities of a country
                     wedding, or the genialities of the hospitable entertainment which followed the
                     holding of a country Station at a rich farmer's domicile.</p>
                  <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7173-00000138"/>
                  <p>What the world has received as "The Reliques of Father Prout," owes nothing to
                     the little <foreign xml:lang="ITA">padrone.</foreign> He had a strong sense of
                     the humourous, and, when the fancy seized him, was not very particular how or
                     where he indulged it.</p>
                  <p>Prout, residing only nine miles from Cork, frequently visited that city, where
                     he had a great many acquaintances, at all times glad to see him. In one
                     Protestant family with which he was intimate, there were several very handsome
                     daughters, full of life and high spirits, who especially delighted in drawing
                     out the rotund priest. He had repeatedly urged them to "drop in" upon him, some
                     day; and when the spirit of fun was strong, early on a Sunday morning in June,
                     they ordered out the carriage, and directed their Jehu to drive them to
                     Watergrasshill.</p>
                  <p>Now, though that terminus was only nine (Irish<ref rend="super"
                        target="#note_011" xml:id="return_011">*</ref> ) miles distant, the greater
                     part of the way—certainly all from Glanmire—was terribly up-hill. The result
                     was that, instead of reaching Father Prout's about ten o'clock, as they had
                     anticipated, they did not draw up at his door until an hour and a half later,
                     and were there informed that "his Reverence had just gone off to last mass."
                     They determined to follow him, partly from curiosity to see in what manner
                     divine worship was performed in a Catholic chapel.</p>
                  <note place="foot" xml:id="note_011">
                     <p><ref target="#return_011">*</ref>Irish miles are longer than English, in the
                        proportion of 11 to 14. A traveller complained to the chaise-driver of the
                        narrowness of the way. "Oh, then," said the man, "why need you be angry with
                        the roads? Sure, we make up in the length for the scanty measure we get in
                        the width."</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>The chapel in which Father Prout officiated was by no means a building of
                     pretension. At that time the roof was out of repair, and, in wet weather, acted
                     as a gigantic shower-bath. The floor, then, consisted of beaten earth, which
                     was somewhat of a puddle whenever the rains descended and the winds blew. The
                     Cork ladies soon found the chapel, entered it, and (accustomed to the rich
                     churches of their own persuasion) gazed in wonder on the humble, unadorned
                     place of worship in which they stood. It may literally be said "in which they
                     stood," for there were no pews, no chairs, not even a solitary stool.</p>
                  <p>Presently the chapel began to fill, and "the pressure from without" gradually
                     drove the ladies nearer and yet nearer to the altar. At length Father Prout
                     entered in his clerical attire, and commenced the service. In Catholic churches
                     the priest officiates, during the early part of the service, with his face to
                     the altar, and his back to the congregation. Thus, it happened that Prout never
                     saw his Cork friends until the time when he turned round to the congregation.
                     Then he beheld them, handsomely and fashionably attired, standing up (for the
                     floor was too puddled to allow them to soil their<pb n="276-277"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000139"/> vesture by kneeling, as every one else did), the
                     gazed-at by all beholders, looking and feeling the reverse of comfortable.</p>
                  <p>Father Prout immediately looked at his clerk, Pat Murphy,—an original in his
                     way,—caught his eye and his attention, and gently inclining towards him,
                     whispered, "send for three chairs for the ladies." Pat, who was a little deaf,
                     imperfectly caught his master's words, and turned round to the congregation and
                     roared out, "Boys! his Reverence says, 'Three cheers for the ladies.'" The
                     congregation, obedient and gallant, gave three tremendous shouts, to the
                     surprise of the ladies and the horror of the priest. There was a good deal of
                     merriment when the mistake was explained, but to his dying day Father Prout was
                     reminded, whenever he visited Cork, of the "Three cheers for the ladies."</p>
                  <p>Pat Murphy, his clerk, was quite a character. He affected big words, and was
                     mortally offended whenever any one called him <emph>clerk</emph> or
                        <emph>sexton.</emph> "I pity the weakness of your intellectual
                     organization," he would contemptuously exclaim. "If you had only brains enough
                     to distinguish B from a bull's foot, you would appreciate my peculiar and
                     appropriate official designation. The words 'clerk' and 'sexton' are
                     appellations which distinctify the menial avocations of persons employed in
                     heretical places of worship. My situation is that of Sacristan, and my
                     responsible duty is to act as custodian todian of the sacred utensils and
                     vestments of the chapel."</p>
                  <p>Murphy had an exaggerated idea of the abilities of his principal, and stoutly
                     maintained that if the Pope knew what was good for the Church, he would long
                     since have elevated Father Prout to the episcopal dignity. His chief regret,
                     when dying, was, that he did not survive to see <emph>this</emph>
                     consummation.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes Pat Murphy would condescend to enter into a <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >vivâ voce</foreign> controversy with one of the "heretics," (as he
                     invariably designated the Protestants,) on the comparative merits of the rival
                     churches. His invariable wind-up, delivered gravely and authoritatively, as a
                     clincher, to which he would permit no reply, was as follows:—"I commiserate
                     your condition, which is the result of your miserable ignorance. Unfortunate
                     individual! out of the New Testament itself I can prove that your religion is
                     but a thing of yesterday. With you Protestants the Apostle Paul had not the
                     most distant acquaintance, whereas he corresponded with us of the Holy Roman
                     Church. You doubt it? Know you not that, from Corinth, he wrote an Epistle to
                     the <emph>Romans,</emph> and if the Protestants were in existence then, and
                     known to him, why did he not as well send an Epistle unto
                     <emph>them?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Father Prout was short and rotund. His Sacristan was tall and thin. Immemorial
                     usage permits the clerical cast-off garments to descend, like heirlooms<pb
                        n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7173-00000140"/> looms, to the parish clerk. Pat
                     Murphy, in the threadbare garments which erst had clothed the rotundity of
                     Father Prout, was a ludicrous looking object. The doctrine of compensation used
                     to be carried out, on such occasions, with more truth than beauty. The waist of
                     the priest's coat would find itself under Murphy's arms, the wristbands would
                     barely cover his elbows, and the pantaloons, sharing the fate of the other
                     garments, would end at his knees, leaving a wide interval of calf visible to
                     public gaze. On the other hand, by way of equivalent, the garments would
                     voluminously wrap around him, in folds, as if they were intended to envelope
                     not one Pat Murphy, but three such examples of the mathematical definition,
                     "length without breadth." On one occasion I had the double satisfaction of
                     seeing Father Prout, like Solomon, in all his glory, with Pat Murphy in full
                     costume. It happened in this wise:</p>
                  <p>There was pretty good shooting about Watergrasshill, and the officers of an
                     infantry regiment, who were quartered at Fermoy, at the period to which I
                     refer, had made Prout's acquaintance, while peppering away at the birds, and
                     had partaken of a capital impromptu luncheon which he got up on the moment.
                     Prout, it may be added, was in the habit of receiving presents of game, fish
                     and poultry from his friends in Cork, (the mail-coaches and other public
                     conveyances passing his door several times every day,) and as long as Dan
                     Meagher, of Patrick-street, was in the wine-trade, be sure that his friend,
                     Father Prout, did not want good samples of the generous juice of the grape. Of
                     course, he also had a supply of real <hi rend="i"/>potheen. Cellar and larder
                     thus provided for, Prout was fond of playing the host.</p>
                  <p>A great intimacy speedily sprung up between Prout and his military friends, and
                     he partook of numerous dinners at their mess in Fermoy Barracks. At last,
                     determined to return the compliment, he invited them all to dine with him at
                     Watergrass-hill. One of my own cousins, who happened to be one of the guests,
                     took me with him—on the Roman plan, I presume, which permitted an invited guest
                     to bring <emph>his shade.</emph> I was a youngster at the time, but remember
                     the affair as if it were of yesterday.</p>
                  <p>If there was any anticipation of a spoiled dinner, it was vain. Prout, who was
                     on intimate terms with all his neighbours for half a dozen miles round, had
                     been wise enough to invoke the aid of the Protestant rector of Watergrass-hill,
                     who not only lent him plate, china, and all other table necessaries, but—what
                     was of more importance—also spared him the excellent cook who, it was said,
                     could compose a dinner, in full variety, out of any one article of food. Each
                     of the officers was attended at table by his own servant, and Pat Murphy, in
                     full dress, officiated as servitor, at the particular disposal of Father Prout
                     himself.</p>
                  <p>The dinner was excellent,—well-cooked, well-served<pb n="280-281"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000141"/> served, and worthy of praise for the abundance,
                     variety, and excellence of the viands. There was everything to be pleased
                     with—nothing to smile at.</p>
                  <p>I beg to withdraw the last four words. There was Pat Murphy, in an ex-suit of
                     Prout's, looking such a figure of fun, that, on recalling the scene now, I
                     wonder how, one and all, we did not burst into a shout of laughter when he
                     first was presented to view. He looked taller, and scraggier, and leaner than
                     usual—his clothes appearing greater misfits than ever! Prout, who kept his
                     countenance remarkably well, evidently saw and enjoyed the ludicrous appearance
                     of his man. On the other hand, the man, taking on himself the duties of Major
                     Domo, ordered the other attendants about in all directions, muttering curses
                     between his teeth whenever they did not do exactly as he commanded. But
                     everything went off gaily, and Prout's rubicund face became redder and more
                     radiant under the influence of this success.</p>
                  <p>In the course of the entertainment, Father Prout, addressing his attendant,
                     said, "Pat, a glass of porter, if you please." The liquor was poured, and, as
                     it frothed in the glass, Prout raised it to his lips with the words, "Thank
                     you, Pat." Waiting until he had completed the draught, Pat, in a tone of
                     earnest remonstrance, said, "Ah, then, your Reverence, why should
                        <emph>you</emph> thank me for what's your own? It would be decent for these
                     genteels who are dining here, to thank me for the good drink, but you've no
                     right to do anything of the sort, seeing that the liquor is your own. It is my
                     supplication that you will not do so again; there is an incongruity in it which
                     I disrelish." We had some difficulty in not laughing, but contrived to keep
                     serious faces during this colloquy.</p>
                  <p>The liberality of the little Padre had provided us with three courses, and just
                     as Pat Murphy was in the act of relieving a noble roasted haunch of mutton,
                     before his master, by a dish of snipe, he happened to look out of the window
                     and see one of his own familiar associates passing along the street. Hastily
                     flinging down the dish, he threw up the window, and, kneeling down, with his
                     long arms resting on the still, loudly hailed his friend, "Where are ye going
                     Tom?" The answer was that a dance was expected in the neighbourhood, and at
                     which, of course, Pat would be "to the fore." Now, the said Pat, very much like
                     Ichabod Crane in figure, had a sort of sneaking desire, like him, to be
                     wherever pretty women were to be seen. "No," said Pat, "I do not anticipate to
                     be relieved in any thing like proper time from attendance here this evening.
                     His Reverence, who has been ating and drinking, with remarkable avidity, on the
                     military officers down in Fermoy, is hospitable to-day, and entertains the
                     whole squad of them at dinner. To see them <emph>ate,</emph> you'd think they
                     had just got out of a hard Lent. 'T isn't often, I dare say, that they get such
                     a feast.<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7173-00000142"/> There's the mutton sent by
                     Chetwood of Glanmire; and the poultry by Cooper Penrose of Wood-hill; and the
                     lashing of game by Devonshire of Kilshan-neck; and the fruit by Lord Riversdale
                     of Lisnegar—that is, by his steward, for 'tis little his Lordship sees of the
                     place that gives him a good six thousand a year;—and the barrel of porter from
                     Tommy Walker of Fermoy; and the wine from red-faced Dan Meagher of Cork; and
                     everything of the best. Depend on it, the officers won't stir until they have
                     made fools of all the provender. By-and-bye, that the poor mightn't have a
                     chance of the leavings, they will be calling for grilled bones, and devilled
                     legs and gizzards. No, Tom, my mind misgives me that I can't go to the dance
                     this evening. Here's the officers, bad 'cess to them, that are sedentary
                     fixtures until midnight."</p>
                  <p>This oration delivered,—and every one had been silent while Pat Murphy was thus
                     unburthening his mind,—he arose from his knees, closed the window, and resumed
                     his place behind Father Prout, with "a countenance more of sorrow than of
                     anger," calm and unconcerned as if nothing had occurred out of the ordinary
                     routine. At that moment, Prout threw himself back on his chair, and laughed
                     until the tears rolled down his cheeks, and thus encouraged, the company
                     followed his example, and laughed also. When the mirth had subsided, it was
                     almost renewed by the solemn countenance of Pat Murphy, grave rather than
                     severe—a sort of domestic Marius sitting, in sad contemplation, amid the ruins
                     of Carthage.</p>
                  <p>Father Prout had rather a rough set of parishioners to deal with. He could be,
                     and was, very much of the gentleman, but it pleased him to appear plain and
                     unpolïshed to those among whom his lot was cast. At times, when nothing else
                     would do, he would address them, in an exhortation, very much in the spirit of
                     Swift's "if you like the conditions, down with the dust!" At such times,
                     Rabelais, "in his easy chair," would have smiled, and Swift himself would have
                     hailed Prout as a congenial spirit.</p>
                  <p>I have a memorandum of one of these sermons. The object was to collect some
                     arrears of "dues" from certain non-paying parishioners, (constituting rather a
                     large portion of his congregation,) and I have been told that the discourse was
                     much to this effect: <q>
                        <p>FATHER PROUT'S SERMON.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Somewhere in the Scriptures it is written, that whoever gives to the poor lends
                     to the Lord. There are three reasons why I don't tell you exactly where this
                     may be found. In the first place, poor creatures that you are few of you happen
                     to have the authorized Douay edition, printed and published by Richard Coyne of
                     Dublin, and certified as correct by Archbishop Troy, and the other heads of the
                     Church in<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7173-00000143"/> Ireland—few among you, I
                     say, have <emph>that,</emph> though I know that there is not a house in the
                     parish without a loose song-book, or the History of the Irish Rogues. In the
                     second place, if ye had it, 'tis few of ye could read it, ignorant haythens
                     that ye are. And in the third place, if every man-jack of ye did possess it,
                     and could read it, (for the Church still admits the possibility of miracles,)
                     it would not much matter at this present moment, because it happens that I
                     don't quite remember in what part of it the text is to be found;—for the
                     wickedness of my flock has affected my memory, and driven many things clean out
                     of my head, which it took me a deal of trouble to put into it when I was
                     studying in foreign parts, years ago. But it don't matter. The fault is not
                     mine, but yours, ye unnatural crew, and may-be ye won't find it out, to your
                     cost, before ye have been five minutes quit of this life. Amen.</p>
                  <p>"He who gives to the poor."—Ye are not skilled in logic, nor indeed in anything
                     that I know except playing hurley in the fields, scheming at cards in
                     public-houses for half gallons of porter, and defrauding your clergy of their
                     lawful dues. What is worse, there's no use in trying to drive logic into your
                     heads, for indeed that would be the fulfilment of another text that speaks of
                     throwing pearls before pigs. But if ye <emph>did</emph> know logic—which ye
                     don't—ye would perceive at once that the passage I have just quoted naturally
                     divides itself into two branches. The first involves the <emph>giving;</emph>
                     that is, rationally and syllogistically considered, what ye ought to do. And
                     the second involves the <emph>poor;</emph> that is, the receivers of the gifts,
                     or the persons for whom ye ought to do it.</p>
                  <p>First, then, as to the giving. Now it stands to reason that, as the Scripture
                     says in some other place, the blind can't lead the blind, because maybe they'd
                     fall into the bog-holes, poor things, and get drowned. And so, though there
                     really is wonderful kindness to each other among them, it is not to be expected
                     that the poor can give to the poor. No, the givers must be people who have
                     something to give, which the poor have not. Some of ye will try and get off on
                     this head, and say that 'tis gladly enough ye'd give, but that really ye can't
                     afford it. Can't ye? If you make up your minds, any one of you, to give up only
                     a single glass of spirits, every day of your lives, see what it will come to in
                     the course of a year, and devote <emph>that</emph> to the Church—that is to the
                     Clergy—and it will be more than some of the well-to-do farmers, whom I have in
                     my eye at this blessed moment, have had the heart to give me during the last
                     twelve months. Why, as little as a penny a day comes to more than thirty
                     shillings in the year, and even that insignificant trifle I have not had from
                     some of you that have the means and ought to know better. I don't want to
                     mention names, but, Tom Murphy of the Glen, I<pb n="286-287"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000144"/> am afraid I shall be compelled to name you
                     before the whole congregation, some day before long, if you don't pay up your
                     lawful dues. I won't say more now on that subject, for, as St. Augustine says,
                     "A nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse."</p>
                  <p>Now, the moral of the first part being clearly shown, that all who
                        <emph>can</emph> give <emph>ought</emph> to give, the next branch is
                        <emph>to whom</emph> should it be given? The blessed text essentially states
                     and declares "to the poor." Then follows the inquiry, who's "the
                        <emph>poor.</emph>" The whole matter depends on <emph>that.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>I dare say, ignorant as ye are, some of you will think that it's the beggars,
                     and the cripples, and the blind travellers who contrive to get through the
                     length and breadth of the country, guided by Providence and a little dog tied
                     to their fingers by a bit of string. No, I don't want to say one mortal word
                     against that sort of cattle, or injure them in their honest calling. God help
                     them. It's their trade, their estate, their occupation, their business to
                     beg—just as much as 'tis Pat Mulcahy's business to tailor, or Jerry Smith's to
                     make carts, or Tom Shine's to shoe horses, or Din Cotter's to make potheen, and
                     my business to preach sermons, and save your souls, ye heathens. But these
                     ain't "the poor" meant in the text. They're used to begging, and they like to
                     beg, and they thrive on begging, and I, for one, wouldn't be the man to disturb
                     them in the practice of their profession, and long may it be a provision to
                     them and to their heirs for ever. Amen.</p>
                  <p>May-be, ye mean-spirited creatures, some among you will say that it's
                     yourselves is "the poor." Indeed, then, it isn't. Poor enough and niggardly ye
                     are, but you ain't the poor contemplated by holy Moses in the text. Sure 'tis
                     your nature to toil and to slave—sure 'tis what ye're used to. Therefore, if
                     any one were to give anything to <emph>you,</emph> he would not be lending to
                     the Lord in the slightest degree, but throwing away his money as completely as
                     if he lent it upon the security of the land that's covered by the lakes of
                     Killarney. Don't flatter yourselves, any of you, for a moment, that you are
                     "the poor." I can tell you that you're nothing of the sort.</p>
                  <p>Now, then, we have found out who should be the givers. There's no mistake about
                        <emph>that</emph>—reason and logic unite in declaring that every one of you,
                     man, woman and child—should give, and strain a point to do it liberally. Next,
                     we have ascertained that it's "the poor" who should receive what you give.
                     Thirdly, we have determined who are <emph>not</emph> "the poor." Lastly, we
                     must discover who <emph>are.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let each of you put on his considering cap and think.—Well, I have paused that
                     you might do so. Din Cotter is a knowledgeable man compared with the bulk of
                     you. I wonder whether he has discovered who <emph>are</emph> "the poor." He
                     shakes his head—but there is not much in <emph>that.</emph> Well, then, you
                     give it<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7173-00000145"/> up. You leave it to me to
                     enlighten you all. Learn, then, to your shame, that it's the Clergy who are
                     "the poor."</p>
                  <p>Ah! you perceive it now, do you? The light comes in through your thick heads,
                     does it? Yes, it's I and my brethren is "the poor." We get our bread—coarse
                     enough and dry enough it usually is—by filling you with spiritual food, and,
                     judging by the congregation now before me, its ugly mouths you have to receive
                     it. We toil not, neither do we spin, but if Solomon, in all his glory, was not
                     arrayed better than we are, instead of being clothed in vermin and fine linen,
                     'tis many a time he'd be wearing a thread-bare black coat, white on the seams,
                     and out at the elbows. It's the opinion of the most learned scholars and
                     Doctors in Divinity, as laid down before the Council of Trent, that the
                     translation is not sufficiently exact in regard of this text. And they
                     recommend that for the words "the poor," we should substitute "the clergy."
                     Thus corrected, then, the text would read "he who gives to the Clergy, lends to
                     the Lord," which, no doubt, is the proper and undiluted Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The words of the text are thus settled, and you have heard my explanation of it
                     all. Now for the application. Last Thursday was a week since the fair of
                     Bartlemy, and I went down there to buy a horse for this is a large parish, and
                     mortification and fretting has puffed me up so, that, God help me, 'tis little
                     able I am to walk about to answer all the sick calls, to say nothing of
                     stations, weddings, and christenings. Well, I bought the horse, and it cost me
                     more than I expected, so that there I stood without a copper in my pocket after
                     I had paid the dealer. It rained cats and dogs, and as I am so poor that I
                     can't afford to buy a great coat, I got wet to the skin, in less than no time.
                     There you were, scores of you, in the public houses, with the windows up, that
                     all the world might see you eating and drinking as if it was for a wager. And
                     there was not one of you who had the grace to ask, "Father Prout, have you got
                     a mouth in your face?" And there I might have stood in the rain until this
                     blessed hour (that is, supposing it had continued raining until now), if I had
                     not been picked up by Mr. 'Mun Roche, of Kildinan, an honest gentleman, and a
                     hospitable man I must say, though he is a Protestant.<ref rend="super"
                        target="#note_012" xml:id="return_012">*</ref> He took me home with him, and
                     there, to your eternal disgrace, you villains, I got as full as a tick, and
                     'Mun had to send me home in his own carriage—which is an everlasting shame to
                     all of you, who belong to the true Church.</p>

                  </note>
                  <p>Now, I ask which has carried out the text? You who did not give me even a poor
                     tumbler of punch, when I was like a drowned rat at Bartlemy, or 'Mun Roche, who
                     took me home, and filled me with the<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7173-00000146"/>
                     best of eating and drinking, and sent me to my own house, after that, in his
                     own elegant carriage? Who best fulfilled the Scripture? Who lent to the Lord,
                     by giving to his poor Clergy? Remember, a time will come when I must give a
                     true account of you:—what can I say then? Won't I have to hang down my head in
                     shame, on your account? 'Pon my conscience, it would not much surprise me,
                     unless you greatly mend your ways, if 'Mun Roche and you won't have to change
                     places on that occasion: <emph>he</emph> to sit alongside of me, as a friend
                     who had treated the poor Clergy well in this world, and <emph>you</emph> in a
                     certain place, which I won't particularly mention now, except to hint that 'tis
                     little frost or cold you'll have in it, but quite the contrary. However, 'tis
                     never too late to mend, and I hope that by this day week, it's quite another
                     story I'll have to tell of you all.—Amen.</p>

                  <head>IRISH DANCING-MASTERS.</head>
                  <p>FIVE-and-twenty years ago, when I left Ireland, the original or aboriginal race
                     of country dancing-masters was nearly extinct. By this time, I presume, it has
                     almost died out. Here and there a few may be seen, <q>
                        <l>"Rari nantes in gurgite vasto,"</l>
                     </q> but the light-heeled, light-hearted, jovial, genial fellows who were
                     actual Masters of the Revels in the district to which they respectively
                     belonged, are nowhere.</p>
                  <p>There used to be as much pride (and property) in a village dancing-master as in
                     a village schoolmaster, in my young days, and I have heard of "many accidents
                     by flood and field," caused by attempts to remove a dancing-master or a
                     pedagogue, of high reputation, from one district to another. In such cases, the
                     very abduction being the strongest possible compliment to his renown, the
                     person who was "enticed away by force," always made a point of offering no
                     resistance, and would passively and proudly await the result. Indeed, care was
                     always taken that such removal should be actual preferment, as, to ameliorate
                     his condition, the residence<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7173-00000147"/>
                     provided for him in the new village, township, or barony, was always better
                     than that from which he was removed.</p>
                  <p>As a general rule, the abduction, of schoolmasters was a favorite practice in
                     Kerry—where every man and boy is supposed to speak Latin<ref rend="super"
                        target="#note_013" xml:id="return_013">*</ref> —while stolen dancing-masters
                     did not abound in the neighbouring counties of Cork and Limerick. The natural
                     inference is that the County Kerry-men preferred the culture of the head, while
                     the others rather cared for the education of the heels.</p>
                  <note place="foot" xml:id="note_013">
                     <p><ref target="#return_013">*</ref>There are full grounds for this assertion.
                        Classical learning has flourished in Kerry (under a hedge) from time
                        immemorial. I recollect an illustrative anecdote. Two poor scholars who were
                        travelling through Kerry, came to a farm-house, when faint with hunger, and
                        foot-sore with walking; they went in, and modestly wanted "a drink of
                        water," which was given them. On leaving the house, where they had expected
                        something better than this scant hospitality, one of them exclaimed, "Ah,
                        Pat, that's not the way that a farmer's wife would trate a poor scholar in
                        our part of the world. 'T is the good bowl of milk she'd give him, and not
                        the piggin of cold water. She's a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">malus
                           mulier.</foreign>" The other responded, "say <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >mala</foreign>—it must be so to agree with the feminine <foreign
                           xml:lang="LAT">mulier.</foreign> Don't you know that <foreign
                           xml:lang="LAT">malus mulier</foreign> is bad Latin?" "Hold your tongue,"
                        was the answer: "whatever it is, it is only too good for a niggard like
                           <emph>her.</emph>"</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>To have a first-rate hedge-schoolmaster was a credit to any parish. To have
                     engrossed the services of an eminent <foreign xml:lang="FRA">maître de
                        danse</foreign> was almost a matter of considerable pride and boasting, but
                     to possess <emph>both</emph> of these treasures was indeed a triumph.</p>
                  <p>There was more pride, perhaps, in having a school-master of great repute—more
                     pleasure in owning a dancer of high renown. The book-man was never known to
                     dance, and the village Vestris was rarely able to write his name. Thus they
                     never clashed. One ruled by day, and the other had unquestioned sovereignty in
                     the hours between dusk and dawn.</p>
                  <p>Such a being as a youthful dancing-master I never saw—never heard of. They were
                     invariably middle-aged men, at the youngest; but professors of "the poetry of
                     motion," who were about seventy, appeared the greatest favourites. It was
                     dreaded, perhaps, that the attraction of youth and good dancing combined would
                     be too much for the village beauties to resist. On the same system, in all
                     probability, it was a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sine quâ non</foreign> that the
                     dancing-master should be married.</p>
                  <p>The Irish peasantry used to have a sort of passion for dancing. Hence the
                     necessity for a teacher. On stated evenings during the winter, no matter what
                     obstacles wet weather or dirty roads might present, a large company of pupils,
                     from the age of ten to forty years, would assemble, in some roomy barn,
                     possessing a smooth and hard floor of closely pounded clay, to receive
                     instructions in the saltatory art. Sometimes, when the teacher was ambitious,
                     he would flourishingly open the proceedings with what was called "a bit of a
                     noration,"—the oratory principally consisting of sesquipedalian words and<pb
                        n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7173-00000148"/> mythological allusions, being
                     composed by the schoolmaster—utterly unintelligible, but sounding largely, and
                     delivered in an <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ore rotunda</foreign> manner and with
                     "a laudable voice," as if the dancing-master really understood the words he
                     uttered. Not taking particular pains to follow "copy," and frequently putting
                     in words of his own when those written down for him had slipped out of his
                     memory, these orations were amusingly absurd. They invariably commenced with an
                     allusion to Miriam dancing before Moses, after the passage of the Red Sea, (on
                     which occasion, no doubt, was first heard "the piper who played before Moses,"
                     familiarly named in Irish colloquy,) and, passing down, through Homer and the
                     classics, always ended with a warm eulogy on the antiquity of the dance.</p>
                  <p>In those days, the favourite exhibitions were the jig, the reel, the hornpipe,
                     and the country-dance. The last-named was considered dreadfully genteel—too
                     aristocratic, in fact, for the multitude—and was learned and practiced (as
                     courting and kissing often are) on the sly! The reel was countenanced—and no
                     more. It was rather Scotch than Irish. Every one was expected to be able to go
                     that laborious piece of amusement called "The Sailor's Hornpipe,"—faint
                     vestiges of which are extant, to this hour, in nautical scenes,—as represented
                     on the stage. Words cannot describe the evolutions of this remarkable dance,
                     when exhibited with all the scientific tific varieties of which it was capable.
                     The shuffles, cross-shuffles, jumps, hops, leaps, cuttings, slides, and so on,
                     which were introduced, I am unable to describe. The manner in which
                     "heel-and-toe" was employed and varied, some abler historian may record.</p>
                  <p>That the hours passed away on swift pinions at these dancing academies, may
                     well be imagined. There was any quantity of flirtation at all times, and about
                     half the marriages in the country owed their origin to these <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">réunions.</foreign> It is creditable to the proverbial good
                     conduct of my country women, that loss of character rarely, if ever, resulted
                     from these free-and-easy meetings.</p>
                  <p>The real glory of the evening, however, was when the dancing-master, after a
                     world of solicitation, would "take the flure," in order to give his admiring
                     pupils a touch of his quality. On such an occasion, the door of the house would
                     be lifted off its hinges, and placed in the centre of the floor. Abandoning the
                     little <emph>kit</emph> (a small-sized violin) which was his companion at all
                     other exhibitions, he would allow a blind piper to "discourse most excellent
                     music," and, on the door, would commence that wondrous display of agility,
                     known, in my time, as "cover the buckle;"—a name probably derived from the
                     circumstance that the dancing-master, while teaching, always wore large buckles
                     in his shoes, and by the rapidity of motion with which he would<pb n="296-297"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000149"/> make his "many twinkling feet" perpetually
                     cross, would seem to "cover" the appendages in question. The great effort was
                     to exhibit all varieties of steps and dances, without once quitting the
                     prostrate door on which the exhibitor took his stand. The jumps the "cuttings"
                     in the air, the bends, the dives, the wrigglings, the hops—these were all
                     critically regarded by his audience, and sometimes rewarded with such
                     exclamations as "That's the way,"—"now for a double cut,"—"cover-the-buckle, ye
                     divel,"—"Oh, then, 'tis he that handles his feet nately." At the conclusion,
                     when he literally had danced himself almost off his legs, he would how to the
                     company, and—if he were very much a favourite, or had eclipsed all former
                     displays—one of the prettiest girls in the room would go round, plate in in
                     hand, and make a collection for him. How the ten-penny and five-penny bits
                     would tumble in, on those occasions—particularly if the fair collector could be
                     induced to announce, with a blush and a smile, that she would take an extra
                     donation on the usual terms, which meant that, for five shillings into the
                     plate, any gallant swain might brush the dew from her own coral lips, on that
                     occasion only and by particular desire. Can you doubt, for a moment, that the
                     likely "boy" who had been sitting by her side all the evening, making babies on
                     her eyes (as the saying is), and with his arm round her waist, just to steady
                     her in her seat, would jump up and fling his crown-piece into the
                     treasury—though the pecuniary sacrifice would probably involve his being
                     obliged to dispense, for a few weeks more, with "the new Carline hat" on which
                     his dandyism had set its mind, for his Sunday adorning!</p>
                  <p>It was difficult for "an outsider" to become a spectator of the peculiar modes
                     of teaching adopted and practiced by these masters. At a small extra rate, they
                     would undertake to give instructions in that "deportment," of which the late
                     Mr. Turvey-drop was such an illustrious exemplar. I never witnessed anything of
                     this sort, but have conversed on the subject with some who did. From what I
                     could learn, the whole course of tuition in this particular branch must have
                     been ludicrous in the extreme. Besides lessons in standing, walking, sitting,
                     and even leaning with grace and ease, more recondite points were considered.
                     Such were "how to slide out of a room backwards." (on the chance, no doubt, of
                     some of the rustics having to appear at Court, before Royalty)—"how to accept a
                     tumbler of punch from a gentleman," touching the liquid with her lips, so as to
                     leave a kiss within the cup, as Ben Jonson advises,—"how to refuse a kiss," and
                     yet not destroy the hope of its being accepted, a little later in the
                     evening,—and above all, "how to take a kiss," in the most genteel and approved
                     manner of politeness! These instructions, super-added to a lesson that was
                     called "the Grecian<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7173-00000150"/> bend" (which was
                     nothing less than a coquettish way of leaning forward, with the eyes cast down,
                     while listening to soft nonsense from a favoured swain), were peculiar and
                     private. The only way in which the male sex could obtain a glimpse at such
                     Eleusinian mysteries was by taking a recumbent position on the roof of the
                     house, carefully removing a small portion of the thatch, and using eyes and
                     ears in that situation to the best advantage. If detected by the irate maidens,
                     the spy would run a fair chance of a scratched face and well-boxed ears.</p>
                  <p>As might be expected, the country dancing-master sometimes had stupid and
                     refractory pupils. There was a common method of giving them instruction, which,
                     for its practical simplicity, may be worth relating. When the pupil would
                     persist in <emph>not</emph> recollecting which foot was to be used, at
                     particular periods, the dancing-master would take a rope made of twisted hay,
                     called a <hi rend="i"/>suggaun, and fasten it around one of the delinquent's
                     ankles. He would then take a similar bracelet of twisted willow, denominated a
                        <hi rend="i"/>gad, and put this on the other. Then, instead of directing the
                     pupil to the particular use or motion of the right leg or the left, he would
                     exclaim, "Rise upon <hi rend="i"/>suggaun," or "Sink upon <hi rend="i"/>gad,"
                     and in this manner convey his instructions beyond a possibility of mistake by
                     even the most stupid!</p>
                  <p>Of course, where there was large company of young people, full of life and
                     spirit, under pupilage to a not young instructor, a variety of practical jokes
                     would be perpetrated, at his expense, every now and then. They were almost
                     invariably of a good-natured kind. One, which might be considered as to "be
                     repeated every night until farther notice," generally came off towards the end
                     of the evening. A joyous, light-hearted damsel would suddenly start up, while
                     the music was playing, and, placing herself before the dancing-master, with
                     that particular description of curtsy called "a bob," silently challenge him to
                     dance with her. Now, under all circumstances, except actual inability to move,
                     the gentleman so challenged has nothing to do but pick up the gauntlet, and
                     "take the flure." Then, challenger and challenged would commence an Irish jig—a
                     dance so violent that, writing in the dog-days as I do, the very recollection
                     of it makes me feel as if the barometer was some two hundred in the shade. When
                     the damsel had pretty well tired herself, one of her fair friends would take
                     her place, and so on until a round dozen or so had had their turn. All this
                     time, the doomed victim of a man had to continue dancing—and the point of
                     honour was to do so, without giving in, as long as strength and wind lasted.
                     The company would gather round, forming a ring for the performers, and the word
                     would be, "On with the dance" (as it was, at Brussels, on the eve of Waterloo),
                     until, at last,<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7173-00000151"/> some male spectator
                     would pityingly dash into the circle, take the tired man's place, and permit
                     the breathless and exhausted victim to totter to a seat, gasping out a protest,
                     as he did, that he could have held out for half an hour longer, and wondered
                     why any gentleman should interfere with another gentleman's <hi rend="i"
                     />divarshun.</p>
                  <p>In the preceding story of "The Petrified Piper," mention is made of a
                     dancing-master commonly known as "Ould Lynch." He was an original, in many
                     respects, and, like many of his profession, was in a constant flutter of faded
                     finery and actual poverty. He was so much a character that my father took
                     rather a fancy to him, and had him often at the house, as a teacher of dancing,
                     in the well populated town of Fermoy. He had small chance of earning what would
                     keep life and soul together. But he was a quiet, unassuming man, better
                     educated than most of his class, and full of anecdote. One social virtue he
                     eminently possessed:—he was one of the best backgammon players I ever saw, and
                     (I speak it modestly,) was very fond of me as a pupil.</p>
                  <p>Lynch was a County Limerick man, on the confines of "the Kingdom of Kerry," and
                     informed me that, in the parish where he was brought up, the natives had a
                     passion for backgammon, and were wont, on high-days and holidays, to hold
                     tournaments (on their favourite game) with the inhabitants itants of the next
                     parish, in Kerry. Unfortunately, one day when a great trial of skill was
                     appointed to come off, it turned out that no backgammon box was forthcoming.
                     Both parties had contrived to forget it. To send for the necessary implements
                     would have been a waste of time, when the combatants had "their souls in arms,"
                     and were "eager for the fray." In this dilemma, a lad who had a decided genius
                     for expedients suggested a plan by which, without delay, their mutual wishes
                     could be realized. Under his advice, one of the meadows was fixed upon as the
                     scene of action. The turf was removed at intervals, so as to make the place
                     present the semblance of a backgammon board, and substitutes for men were
                     readily found in the flat stones and slates with which the ground abounded. The
                     great difficulty was—the dice! They could extemporize board and men, but how to
                     raise the bits of ivory? The lad was not to be baffled. He proposed that two
                     men, one selected from each party, should sit on the ditch opposite each other,
                     with "the board in the centre, with their respective backs turned
                        <emph>from</emph> the combatants, and, in turn, should call out the numbers,
                     as if they had been actually thrown by dice! This brilliant idea was acted
                     upon. A halfpenny was thrown up to decide who should have first play, and the
                     men on the ditch alternately called out, at will, any<pb n="302-303"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000152"/> of the throws which might have been actually
                     cast had the dice themselves been "to the fore."</p>
                  <p>Such primitive practice, I venture to say, had never before been applied to the
                     noble <emph>science</emph> of backgammon. I use the word advisedly, because,
                     with skill and judgment, what is called bad luck does not very materially
                     affect the game. The art is to conquer, despite bad throwing.</p>
                  <p>Lynch succeeded a worthy named Hearne—a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nom de
                        guerre,</foreign> his enemies averred, for the less euphonious one of
                     Herring. Whatever his name, the man was quite a character. He fancied himself a
                     poet, and was particularly fond of taking his favourite pupils aside to
                     communicate to them in a confidential manner, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto
                        voce,</foreign> the latest productions of his muse,—it being expected that,
                     a little later in the evening, the favoured individuals should delicately draw
                     him out and solicit him to a public recital of his verses. After a good deal of
                     pressing on their part, and a show of, resistance on his, (which every one
                     understood,) the little dancing-master would mount on a table, deliver a
                     flourishing preface in prose, and then go through the recitation, in a manner
                     which set description at defiance. At the conclusion of this feat, which was
                     duly encored, Hearne was wont to distribute copies of his composition printed
                     on whity-brown paper, and the tribute of a five-penny bit was expected in
                     acknowledgment of the same—simply, as he said, "to pay for the printing." He
                     had such a peculiar system of orthography—spelling the words by the sound—that
                     I venture, with all due diffidence, to put forward his claim to take precedence
                     of the interesting and worthy founders of the newspaper-nondescript, <title>The
                        Fonetic Nuz,</title> at which the Londoners laughed heartily a dozen years
                     ago. By some accident, I have preserved a copy of one of Hearne's poetical
                     compositions, in which his own mode of spelling is carefully preserved, and I
                     subjoin it as a curiosity,—a specimen of what emanated, some thirty years ago,
                     from one who belonged to the peculiar class (of which Grant Thorburn is the
                     head) worthy of being called The Illiterate Literati! <q>

                  <head>CHARLEY CROFTS.</head>
                  <p>IN the immortal "Maxims of O'Doherty," written by the late Dr. Maginn, mention
                     is made of a dinner at the late Lord Doneraile's, in the South of Ireland, in
                     which a reproof was administered to his Lordship's meanness in the article
                     of—tippling. He says, "My friend, Charley Crofts, was also of the party. The
                     claret went lazily round the table, and his Lordship's toad-eaters hinted that
                     they preferred punch, and called for hot water. My Lord gave in, after a humbug
                     show of resistance, and whiskey-punch was in a few minutes the order of the
                     night. Charley, however, to the annoyance of the host, kept swilling away at
                     the claret, on which Lord Doneraile lost all patience, and said to him,
                     'Charley, you are missing quite a treat; this punch is so excellent.' 'Thank
                     ye, my Lord,' said Charley, 'I am a plain man, who does not want trates; I am
                     no epicure, so I stick to the claret.'"</p>
                  <p>This free-and-easy gentleman, of whom I have some personal recollection,
                     belonged to a class of which, I suspect, he was the very latest specimen.
                     Charley Crofts, who had acquired no book-learning, because he was born to a
                     large landed property, was<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7173-00000154"/> of a
                     respectable family in the west of the county Cork, and, even in his decline,
                     was highly honoured by the multitude, as coming from "the good ould stock."
                     Brought up, but not educated, by his mother, Charley entered the world with
                     very flattering prospects. He had a good property, good looks, good temper, and
                     (what he most prized) good horses. Cursed with an easy disposition, he had
                     never learned how to utter the monosyllable "No," but had unfortunately learned
                     how to sign his name—his friends kindly giving him very frequent opportunities
                     of practicing that autograph, by obtaining it, across narrow slips of stamped
                     paper, ('yclept "bills" and "promissory notes") underneath the words
                        "<emph>Accepted, payable at the Bank of James Delacour, Mallow.</emph>" In
                     the long run, these autographs ruined him—as, bit-by-bit, all his property went
                     to meet the sums to which they pledged him, and Charley Crofts found himself,
                     at the age of thirty, without home or money. He had preserved one thing,
                     however—his personal character. He had committed a great many of the frailties
                     of his sex and youth, but the shadow of a disreputable or doubtful action never
                     rested on his name. He could proudly say, like Francis the First, after the
                     battle of Pavia, "All lost, except honour."</p>
                  <p>The result was that, in his poverty, he was as highly thought of as in his
                     affluence, and was ever a welcome guest in the first houses of his native
                     county.</p>
                  <p>Like the rest of his class, (I mean the estated Irish gentlemen of the last
                     century,) Charley Crofts had learned to drink deeply. He used to narrate, with
                     great glee, an incident connected with his entrance into vivacious habits. His
                     mother, having occasion to leave their country residence, in order to transact
                     some business in Cork, left her hopeful son in full possession of the house and
                     full command of the servants, for the fortnight she intended being absent.
                     Charley, who was then in his sixteenth year, determined that he would hold no
                     powerless sceptre of vice-royalty, and invited sundry acquaintances to visit
                     him, which they did. As a hogshead of fine claret was always on tap, there was
                     no difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of drink. One day, however, a
                     guest happened to express a desire to vary the post-prandial proceedings by the
                     introduction of a few bottles of port. Now, it happened that Mrs. Crofts
                     possessed (and was known to possess) some remarkably fine port wine, which she
                     carefully kept locked up, reserving it for "State days and holidays." Charley
                     had been left the key of the cellar, and, considering that his hospitality was
                     especially appealed to, by the hint about the port, went down and had a supply
                     brought up. That afternoon's performance went rather hard against the port.
                     Indeed, so much of it was drank that Charley Crofts was puzzled how to account
                     for it, without making full confession. A few days<pb n="308-309"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000155"/> after his mother's return, she asked him to
                     accompany her to the cellar, to provide a suitable location for a supply of
                     sherry which she expected from Cork. The first thing which attracted her notice
                     was the remarkable diminution in the stock of her valued and nearly unique port
                     wine. Catching her eye, Charley anticipated her inquiry, by remarking that, in
                     her absence, a remarkable thunder-storm had penetrated to the cellar and broken
                     a quantity of the bottled wine. Taking up two or three of the bottles, and
                     fully aware that it would be useless to repine or get angry over the mischief
                     done, she drew her hopeful son's attention to them, and only said, "A dreadful
                     storm, indeed! It has actually drawn the corks out of the necks of the bottles,
                     instead of bursting them in the usual way!"</p>
                  <p>For the last five-and-thirty years of his life, Charley Crofts may be said to
                     have literally <emph>lived all around.</emph> He had a number of tried friends,
                     who were glad to have him as their guest and boon companion, for a month at a
                     time. He could tell a good story, knew the private history of every family in
                     the county, was undoubted authority on horse-flesh and every subject connected
                     with the sports of the field, and could take any quantity of wine without its
                     apparently affecting him. Nature had endowed him with great muscular power,
                     immense physical strength, a temper which nothing could cloud, and a mode of
                     expression so terse as sometimes times to be almost epigrammatic. He was
                     exactly qualified for the shifting sort of life upon which he had fallen.</p>
                  <p>When I met him, the brighter portion of his career had passed. He was but the
                     wreck of what he once had been, I was assured by every one; but one may judge,
                     from the ruin, what the structure had been in its pride. Numerous anecdotes
                     were afloat as to his sayings and doings, but it is difficult to realize their
                     effect in our days, unless you could imagine the person on whom they were
                     affiliated. Though I fear that I shall fail in the attempt, I shall endeavour
                     to record two or three.</p>
                  <p>As a four-bottle man, who could drink every one else under the table, Charley
                     Crofts was not so much of a favourite with wives as with their husbands. They
                     knew, by experience, that with Charley Crofts in the van, a wet evening might
                     be looked for—in the dining-room.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wrixon, of Ballygiblin, near Mallow, (father of Sir W. Wrixon-Becher, who
                     married Miss O'Neill, the eminent actress,) had only a small hereditary
                     property when he succeeded to vast estates, on condition that he superadded the
                     name of "Becher" to his own patronymic. As plain Mr. Wrixon, with a small
                     property, he had lived unnoticed, but his circle of friends immensely increased
                     when he became Mr. Wrixon-Becher, and a man of "Ten Thousand a Year." Soon
                     after, he<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7173-00000156"/> married an English lady,
                     with some fortune, much pride, a fair share of beauty, and a decided abhorrence
                     of the drinking habits of her husband's friends. She had heard of, and had been
                     cautioned against, the vivacious enormities of Charley Crofts, and had actually
                     declared to her husband (in private, of course) that whenever Mr. Crofts took a
                     seat at her table, she would immediately relinquish hers.</p>
                  <p>One day, when Wrixon had been out with the Duhallow hounds, and the run had
                     been quick and long, the only man who was in with him "at the death," was
                     Charley Crofts, and under the circumstances—the rain beginning to fall heavily,
                     Crofts' place of sojourn being at least ten miles distant, and Ballygiblin at
                     hand,—Wrixon felt that he <emph>must</emph> invite Charley home, or rest under
                     the imputation of behaving in an unsportsmanlike and inhospitable manner.</p>
                  <p>So, he told Charley that half a dozen other good fellows were to take
                     "pot-luck" with him that day, and that he must insist on Charley's joining
                     them. Without any pressing or denial, the invitation was accepted.</p>
                  <p>Now, Charley Crofts knew, just as well as if he had been present when the
                     affair was discussed, how and why it was that, of all the houses in the barony
                     of Duhallow, the mansion of Ballygiblin was the only one to which he had not a
                     general invitation. Wrixon, the moment he reached home, turning over his
                     companion to the friendly custody of a mutual acquaintance, who was to form one
                     of the party that day, hastened to "his lady's chamber," where he found his
                     wife dressed for dinner, and (as her glass told her) looking remarkably well. A
                     few well-expressed and well-timed compliments on her appearance, a
                     congratulation or two on her exquisite taste in dress, a half-hint and
                     half-promise as to the killing effect of a set of pearl in contrast with her
                     ebon looks, and more "blarney" of the same sort, made the lady so very gracious
                     that the husband ventured to communicate under what circumstances he had been
                     compelled to invite Charley Crofts to her table. The lady took them, as they
                     sometimes do in French courts of justice, as "extenuating circumstances," and
                     consented to receive the dreaded Charley. This done, she found her way into the
                     drawing-room, where the guests waited upon her—the most subdued and quiet of
                     them being Charley Crofts. At first, with his grave air and grave attire, she
                     thought that he might have been a clergyman.</p>
                  <p>As the only stranger in the party, Charley had to escort Mrs. Wrixon to the
                     dining-room, to sit next her, to perform the duties of carving for her, to
                     supply her with a little of the small change of conversation. Nobody could
                     behave more decorously, more unlike the lady's fearful anticipations of the
                     dreaded guest. Now and then, when addressed by his friends, a quaint remark or
                     a satiric witticism would<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7173-00000157"/> make her
                     smile, and convince her that the dangerously seductive companionable character
                     of her guest had not been undeservedly obtained. On the whole, she had every
                     reason to think him very much of a gentleman, and graciously smiled on him when
                     she quitted the table.</p>
                  <p>"You have conquered her, by Jove," exclaimed Wrixon. "Not yet," said Charley,
                     "but in a fair way for it." The wine went round. The conversation branched off
                     into its usual channels, and settled, at last, upon a meet of the hounds which
                     was to take place on Mr. Wrixon's property, at which all the company present
                     would attend.</p>
                  <p>In the middle of the discussion, one of the footmen duly announced that his
                     lady was waiting for them, with tea and coffee, in the drawing-room.
                     Heretofore, in that house, such an announcement had always been a mere matter
                     of form. Not so now. Charley Crofts started up and proceeded to obey the
                     summons. "Nonsense!" they all exclaimed. "Don't turn milksop. No one ever goes
                     to tea or coffee in this house." "Say what you may," said Charley, "the lady
                     shall not have to complain of my want of politeness."</p>
                  <p>In the drawing-room, sooth to say, no gentleman had been expected, and Mrs.
                     Wrixon was taking a solitary cup of tea. She was an admirable musician, and was
                     playing "Gramachree" (that saddest of all Irish airs) just as Charley reached
                     the door. Now, music was among the things which he thoroughly understood and
                     appreciated, and the moment that he heard her exquisite execution on the harp
                     he paused, spell-bound, listening with rapt attention and delight, while the
                     pathos of the air drew tears from eyes all unaccustomed to the melting mood.
                     When she had concluded, she turned round, saw the effect which she had
                     produced, and (need I say it) was flattered at that proof of her skill.</p>
                  <p>Quickly recovering himself, Charley Crofts informed her that he had the
                     pleasure of accepting the invitation she had sent into the dining-room. Tea was
                     accordingly provided, and the conversation naturally fell upon music. Charley
                     happened to be a first rate flutist, and having mentioned in what a delightful
                     manner the flute and harp went together, either to accompany the voice or
                     without, Mrs. Wrixon sent for her husband's flute, and allowed him to show her
                     how correctly he had spoken. Presently, she even sang to the double
                     accompaniment, and her husband and his friends, curious to know how Crofts was
                     getting on, having now adjourned from their wine, found him thus engaged.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, in intervals of from three to five minutes, Charley Crofts had
                     gulphed down successive, and almost countless, cups of tea. Again and again had
                     the tea-pot been replenished—and emptied. At last, quite tired out, Mrs. Wrixon
                     said, half in sport, half in earnest, "I am sure, Mr. Crofts, that I never<pb
                        n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7173-00000158"/> gave you credit for being such a
                     determined tea-drinker. As my hand is rather tired, may I beg that you will
                     help yourself?"</p>
                  <p>"Madam," said Charley, with imposing gravity, "I am a plain man. I do not
                     prefer tea to other liquids. You were so good as to send for us to tea. I
                     always obey a lady's summons when I can, and came hither. I am accustomed, for
                     years past, to take a certain quantity of fluid after dinner. I care not what
                     that fluid may be, so that I have my <foreign xml:lang="LAT">quantum.</foreign>
                     Ale, punch, wine, or, as now, even this tea. I can help myself to the other
                     liquids, but tea has no flavor unless it be poured out by a lady's fair
                     hand!"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wrixon, perceiving that she was fairly caught, exclaimed, "Well, Mr.
                     Crofts, I think that I must leave you to take what you please in the
                     dining-room, but whenever you want a little music you can have it here, and I
                     only hope my husband will treat you so well that you will frequently give me
                     the pleasure of seeing you under this roof."</p>
                  <p>This was the manner in which Charley Crofts conquered Madam Wrixon, the proud,
                     high-bred lady. Good friends they continued unto her dying day, and Charley
                     would rather hear her play the harp, as she only could play it, (he fancied,)
                     than assist at the broaching of the finest pipe of claret that ever was
                     smuggled over from Bordeaux.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wrixon, albeit a man of unbounded generosity ity, had one
                        <emph>leetle</emph> drawback. He would give sumptuous entertainments; he
                     paid the chief expenses of the Duhallow Hunt; he indulged his wife in all
                     luxuries of attire and adornment; he had a passion for beautiful horses and
                     costly equipages; he was liberal in his charities; he acted as banker for many
                     of his poorer friends who were of the lackland genus; he seemed to fling money
                     away, though, indeed, he was by no means a spendthrift; but the one little
                     "blot" in his tables (I mean, in his character) was a feverish anxiety to
                     economize on such mere trifles as <emph>cream and butter!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>So it was, however. His friends were at once amused and rendered uncomfortable
                     by it. It interfered with the perfection of their tea and coffee, and always
                     prevented their taking a desired quantity of bread-and-butter. To allude to
                     this matter, to show the slightest consciousness of Mr. Wrixon's peculiar
                     idiosyncrasy, in this respect, was what his friends never ventured upon. They
                     were not the less anxious to have it removed.</p>
                  <p>They determined that Charley Crofts should be the amputator. The next day, at a
                     very early breakfast, preparatory to their taking the field with the
                     fox-hounds, a lively party assembled at Mr. Wrixon's table, in unexceptionable
                     red coats, enviable buckskins, irreproachable top-boots, and the ordinary
                     skull-caps covered with black velvet, which, from time immemorial, formed the
                     costume of the<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7173-00000159"/> members of the
                     Duhallow Hunt; "the most sportingest set of gentlemen," I once heard a peasant
                     say, "that mortial eyes did ever look upon."</p>
                  <p>The breakfast included all that should constitute the matutinal meal of a party
                     of keen sportsmen about to cross the country at break-neck speed—all, except
                     cream and butter, of which, as usual, there was a <emph>minimum</emph> supply,
                     very much short of what might be expected from a dairy of over twenty milch
                     cows. Charley Crofts, as this was his first visit, might be supposed to be in
                     ignorance of his host's feelings upon that point. At all events, he acted as if
                     he were.</p>
                  <p>The cream and butter were placed close by Mr. Wrixon—the supply for a party of
                     nine or ten consisting of a very small ewer-full of the former, and two or
                     three <emph>pats</emph> of the latter, each about the size of a penny-piece. As
                     if it were a matter of course, Charley, having put the needful quantities of
                     tea into his cup, filled it up with the entire contents of the cream-ewer, and,
                     at the same time, put all the butter upon his plate. Mr. Wrixon, startled by
                     such invasion of his favourites, feebly desired one of the servants to bring "a
                        <emph>little</emph> more cream and a <emph>little</emph> more butter."</p>
                  <p>By the time the fresh supply was on the table, Charley Crofts had emptied his
                     cup and eaten his toast. He lost no time in appropriating the prized articles,
                     as before, chatting away with his usual <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >nonchalance,</foreign> as if he had done nothing uncommon. Mr. Wrixon,
                     sitting like one astonied, watched the disappearance of the second supply, and
                     ordered a third replenishment, which went the way of the preceding. Rising in
                     his chair, he addressed the butler and exclaimed, "John, desire that
                        <emph>all</emph> the cream and butter in the dairy be brought up, I think we
                     shall have need of the whole of it." Turning to Crofts, he emphatically said,
                     "I have heard of eating bread-and-butter, but Charley, <emph>you eat butter and
                        bread.</emph>" By this time the laugh which arose gave him the pleasant
                     information that he was <emph>sold.</emph> From that hour he was as liberal
                     with his cream and butter, as he previously had been with every other article
                     in his mansion. He never was able to ascertain whether Charley Crofts had been
                     put up to the trick, or had simply hit the nail by accident.</p>
                  <p>Charley Crofts did not confine his visits to the gentry in his native county of
                     Cork. In the decline of his fortunes—indeed, as long as he was able to do
                     anything—he always was possessor of a gem or two in the way of horseflesh. For
                     many years, his income was almost wholly derived from the sale of horses, out
                     of which he obtained a large profit, and it was known that any animal which he
                     sold or vouched for might be depended on. In the way of business, having
                     disposed of a fine hunter to one of the family, who was sportingly inclined, he
                     had to pass a few days at the house of Mr. Lyons, of Croom,<pb n="318-319"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000160"/> in the county of Limerick. This old man had
                     acquired a vast fortune by following the business of a grazier, and had
                     invested large sums in the purchase of landed estates. His sons, determined to
                     cut a figure in the county, indulged in all manner of excess and extravagance.
                     At the time of Charley Crofts' visit, they issued cards for a splendid <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">déjeuner à la fourchette,</foreign> to which the leading
                     people of the district were invited. As Charley Crofts was on intimate terms
                     with everybody who had pretensions to notice, the Lyons family, in solemn
                     conclave assembled, determined that it would be a sagacious and politic move to
                     get him to officiate as a something between Major Domo and Master of the
                     Ceremonies at the intended festival. Desiring no better fun, he cheerfully
                     consented.</p>
                  <p>The attendance on the gala day was what the newspapers would describe as "full
                     and fashionable." Many went from curiosity, to see in what manner the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">parvenu</foreign> would attempt "to ape his betters"—<abbr>i.
                        e.,</abbr> themselves. Several attended, because they owed money to old
                     Lyons (who did a little in <emph>bills</emph> after abandoning
                        <emph>beef</emph>), and did not like to affront him by not accepting his
                     invitation. A good many went, because they had heard that "all the world and
                     his wife" would be present, and a jovial day might be anticipated.</p>
                  <p>Thanks to Charley Crofts' <foreign xml:lang="FRA">surveillance,</foreign> the
                     entertainment, well got up, went off admirably.</p>
                  <p>Among the more aristocratic guests was the Lady Isabella Fitzgibbon, sister to
                     that Earl of Clare who was the schoolfellow and friend most tenderly and
                     lastingly loved by Byron. At that time she was a fine young woman. She is now a
                     stern old maid—like the odd half of a pair of scissors, of no use to herself or
                     any body else. Lady Isabella affected to look down, with some degree of
                     superciliousness, upon the millionaire's hospitality. Having probably laid in a
                     good supply of mutton chops or beef steaks before she went out, she pointedly
                     neglected the delicacies of the season, which were abundantly supplied, and
                     merely trifled with a lobster-salad. Old Lyons, who had a great respect for
                     good feeding, and particularly for substantials, turned round to her, as she
                     sat by his side, the image of aristocratical
                     don't-care-a-pin-for-all-the-world-ativeness, and kindly said, "Ah, then, my
                     lady, why don't you take some of the good beef and mutton, the capons and the
                     turkeys, and don't be after filling your stomach with that cowld cabbage!"</p>
                  <p>The high-born <foreign xml:lang="ITA">dama</foreign> nearly fainted at what she
                     considered the vulgar good-nature of her host. Soon after, when she had
                     recovered from the shock, she said that she thought she would have a little
                     bread and butter. Immediately opposite her, and within reach of Old Lyons, was
                     a crystal bowl in which floated sundry little <emph>pats</emph> of that
                     delicious butter for which the county Limerick is famed. Lyons made several<pb
                        n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7173-00000161"/> vain efforts to spear one of these
                     with a fork, at last, finding that it was impossible to make the capture in
                     that manner, he raised up his coat-sleeve, tucked up the wrist-band of his
                     shirt, and plunging his hand into the bowl, with the exclamation, "Ha, you
                     little jumping Jennies, I am determined to have you now," secured two pieces of
                     the butter, which he triumphantly deposited on his noble guest's plate, with
                     the words, "There, my lady, when I took the matter <emph>in hand,</emph> I knew
                     I must succeed."</p>
                  <p>Charley Crofts departed this life some twenty years ago. The close of his
                     career was passed in Cove, where he lived upon an annuity provided by the
                     liberality of some of his former friends. His health had failed him, suddenly,
                     a few years before, and he who had been wont "to set the table in a roar," for
                     nearly forty years, subsided into a querulous valetudinarian. He published his
                     Autobiography, shortly before his death, and it deserves mention as one of the
                     dullest of its class, as far as I recollect, (it is a long time since I yawned
                     over it,) the subject matter chiefly consisted of fierce personalities directed
                     against sundry relatives who, he said, had cheated him out of his property.</p>
                  <p>To the very last, Charley Crofts could give graphic narratives of his former
                     career and companions, but the moment he attempted to <emph>write</emph> them
                     down, their spirit wholly evaporated.</p>

                  <p>THE history of Ireland's independence, from the rise of the Volunteers until
                     the treacherous sacrifice of nationality by the passing of the Act of Union—an
                     interval of twenty years, yet crowded with events and eminent characters—can
                     best be read in the lives of the illustrious men who asserted, vindicated, and
                     carried that independence. Looking back at the brief but brilliant period in
                     which they shone, truly did Curran speak of them, to Lord Avonmore, as men
                     "over whose ashes the most precious tears of Ireland have been shed."</p>
                  <p>Among this noble and gallant array of public virtue and genius HENRY GRATTAN
                     stands conspicuous and pre-eminent. To condense a memoir of him into the space
                     which I have here reserved would be a vain attempt. Let me sketch him in his
                     youth. The child, Wordsworth said, is father of the man, and this was
                     particularly true as regards Grattan.</p>
                  <p>Henry Grattan, stated by most of his biographers to have been born in 1750 (the
                     year in which Curran entered into earthly existence), was four years older, his
                     baptismal register in Dublin bearing date the 3d of July, 1746. His father, a
                     man of character<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7173-00000163"/> and ability, was
                     Recorder of Dublin for many years, and one of the metropolitan parliamentary
                     representatives from 1761 to his death in 1766. The well-known patriot, Dr.
                     Lucas, was senatorial colleague and opponent of the elder Grattan, who,
                     although nominally a Whig, was actually a Tory,—was the law officer of the
                     Corporation, which Lucas undauntedly opposed,—and on all essential, political,
                     and legislative points, sided with the Government of the day.</p>
                  <p>The Grattan family were of considerable and respectable standing in Ireland,
                     and Henry Grattan's grandfather and grand-uncles had enjoyed familiar intimacy
                     with Dean Swift and Dr. Sheridan. Henry Grattan's mother was a daughter of
                     Thomas Marlay, Chief Justice of Ireland, who almost as a matter of course in
                     those days, was to be found on the side of the Government, but administered
                     justice fairly, and on some few occasions showed a love for and pride in his
                     native Ireland. Grattan's mother was a clear-headed, well-informed woman. On
                     both sides, therefore, he had a claim to hereditary talent.</p>
                  <p>At ordinary day-schools, in Dublin, Henry Grattan received his education. John
                     Fitzgibbon, afterwards the unscrupulous tool of the Government and the scourge
                     of Ireland (as Lord Chancellor Clare), was his class-mate at one of these
                     seminaries. Grattan rapidly acquired the necessary amount of Greek and Latin,
                     and in 1763, being then 17 years old, entered Trinity College. Here, among his
                     friends and competitors, were Foster (afterwards Speaker of the House of
                     Commons), Robert Day, who subsequently adorned the Bench. In the University
                     there was particular rivalry between Fitzgibbon and Grattan; the first was well
                     grounded in classics and science, but almost wholly ignorant of modern
                     literature. Both obtained the highest prizes in the University,—Grattan getting
                     premium, certificate, or medal at every examination.</p>
                  <p>Before he had completed his twentieth year, Grattan had declared his political
                     opinions. They were patriotic—they were, Irish—they were opposed to the
                     principles and practice of his father, and strongly identical with those of Dr.
                     Lucas, his father's constant and bitter opponent. Lucas was a remarkable man.
                     He it was who, immediately after the accession of George III., introduced a
                     bill for limiting the duration of the Irish Parliament to seven years—the
                     custom being, at the time, that a new Parliament should be chosen when a new
                     monarch ascended the throne, and last during his lifetime. It took seven years'
                     perseverance to effect this change—upon which the English Cabinet thrice put a
                     veto. A fourth and final effort succeeded, the limitation being eight years. It
                     was Lucas who, following in the steps of Swift, boldly attacked bad men and bad
                     measures in the newspapers, and thus asserted<pb n="326-327"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000164"/> serted the Liberty of the Press—that which
                     Curran so earnestly desired to be preserved when, addressing his countrymen, he
                     said, "Guard it, I beseech you, for when it sinks, there sink with it, in one
                     common grave, the liberty of the subject and the security of the Crown." It was
                     Lucas who strenuously denied the right of a British Parliament to govern
                     Ireland, who asserted his country's right to legislative independence, who
                     insisted on her claim for self-government. For this, the law was strained
                     against him,—for this, Dublin grand juries ordered his writings to be publicly
                     burned by the hands of the common hangman—for this, a venal House of Commons
                     voted that he wrote sedition and was an enemy of his country—for this, the
                     Speaker was ordered to issue a warrant for his arrest and imprisonment in
                     gaol—for this, the Lord Lieutenant was solicited to denounce him by
                     Proclamation—for this, the Corporation of Dublin disfranchised him—for this, he
                     had to fly his country and secure life and comparative liberty by eleven years
                     of enforced exile. On his return, in 1760, that very city of Dublin from which
                     he had fled for his life elected him for one of its representatives, Grattan's
                     father being his colleague. As such, the elder Grattan, who was a courtier,
                     opposed the Septennial Bill.</p>
                  <p>Henry Grattan, a patriot from his childhood, ardently adopted Dr. Lucas' views
                     in favour of Ireland's independence. The result was that, in 1765-6, Henry
                     Grattan was at variance with his father. The death of the elder Grattan took
                     place in 1766, and it was then discovered how much he resented his son's
                     assertion of liberal politics. He could not deprive him of a small landed
                     estate, secured to him by marriage settlement, but bequeathed from him the
                     paternal residence of the family for nearly a century. Thus Henry Grattan had
                     to enter the world, not rich in worldly wealth, and with his soul saddened by
                     the marked and public posthumous condemnation by his father. No wonder that, as
                     he declared in one of his letters at the time, he was "melancholy and
                     contemplative, but not studious." No wonder that, solitary in the old home, he
                     should sadly say, "I employ myself writing, reading, courting the muse, and
                     taking leave of that place where I am a <emph>guest,</emph> not an
                        <emph>owner,</emph> and of which I shall now cease to be a
                        <emph>spectator.</emph>" His household Gods were shattered on his hearth,
                     and he sat, cold and lonely, among their ruins. Yet, even then, he dreamed that
                     fortune, smiling upon him, would enable his old age to resign his breath where
                     he first received it. Never was that dream fulfilled. Not even did he die <q>

                        </lg>
                     </q> but his spirit departed, fifty-four years later, in the<pb n="328-329"

                  </p>
                  <p>At the age of twenty-one, Henry Grattan went to London to study the law. At
                     that period, as at present, it is indispensable for every one who desires to be
                     admitted to the Irish bar, that he shall have "studied" for two years at one of
                     the Inns of Court in London. Perhaps this, as much as anything else, shows how
                     completely the English habit has been, and is, to treat Ireland as a mere
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">province.</foreign> Candidates for admission to the
                     Scottish bar are not required to pursue this <emph>nominal</emph> course of
                     study in another country. Nominal it is, for the requirement does not involve
                     the acquisition, in the most infinitesimal degree, of any knowledge of the
                     principles or practice of the law. All that is necessary is that the future
                     barrister shall have eaten twenty-four dinners in the Hall of his London Inn of
                     Court (three at each term) during two years, and a certificate of this
                     knife-and-fork practice—which is facetiously called "keeping his Terms"—is
                     received by the Benchers of the Queen's Inn in Dublin, as proof that the
                     candidate has duly qualified himself by study! There is no examination as to
                     his knowledge of law—two years in London, and a somewhat lesser amount of legal
                     feeding in Dublin, being the sole qualification for the Irish Bar!</p>
                  <p>In Michaelmas Term, 1767, being two months past his majority, Henry Grattan
                     entered his name, as student, on the books of the Middle Temple in London.
                     Although he intended to live by the practice of the law, he devoted little
                     attention to its study. Black-letter, precedents, and technicalities he cared
                     little for. The broad principles of jurisprudence attracted his attention; but
                     he mastered them, not as an advocate, but as a future law-maker. In fact,
                     nature had intended him for a politician and statesman, and his mind, from the
                     first, followed the bias which "the mighty mother" gave. As late as August,
                     1771, when he had been four years in the Temple, he wrote thus to a friend: "I
                     am now becoming a lawyer, fond of cases, frivolous, and illiberal; instead of
                     Pope's and Milton's numbers, I repeat in solitude Coke's instructions, the
                     nature of fee-tail, and the various constructions of perplexing statutes. This
                     duty has been taken up too late; not time enough to make me a lawyer, but
                     sufficiently early to make me a dunce." In the same letter he said, "Your life,
                     like mine, is devoted to professions which we both detest; the vulgar honours
                     of the law are as terrible to me as the restless uniformity of the military is
                     to you."</p>
                  <p>During the four years of his English residence, varied by occasional visits to
                     Ireland, Mr. Grattan's heart certainly never warmed to the profession which he
                     had chosen. The confession which I have just<pb n="330-331"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000166"/> quoted was made only a few months before he was
                     called to the Irish bar in Hilary Term, 1772. Yet he was a hard reader, a close
                     student, an early riser, and a moderate liver. To afford the means of enlarging
                     his library, he avoided expensive amusements and practiced a very close
                     economy. In November, 1768, these saving habits became matter of necessity
                     rather than of choice, when his mother died so suddenly that she had not time
                     to make, as she had purposed, a formal disposition of her reversion to a landed
                     property which she had meant to leave her son. It passed, therefore, to another
                     branch of the family, leaving Grattan such limited resources that it now was
                     necessary for him to follow a profession.</p>
                  <p>How, then, did Grattan employ his time in England? We have his own regretful
                     confession, that it was not, for the first four years, in the study of the law.
                     Shortly after his first visit to London, he lost one of his sisters; and deep
                     sorrow for her death, and a distaste for society, drove him from the bustle of
                     the metropolis to the retirement of the country. He withdrew to Sunning Hill,
                     near Windsor Forest, amid whose mighty oaks he loved to wander, meditating upon
                     the political questions of the day, and making speeches as if he already were
                     in parliament. Mrs. Sawyer, his landlady, a simple-minded woman, knew not what
                     to make of the odd-looking, strange-mannered young man, and hesitated between
                     the doubt whether he was insane or merely eccentric. When one of his friends
                     came to see him, she complained that her lodger used to walk up and down in her
                     garden throughout the summer nights, speaking to himself, and addressing an
                     imaginary "Mr. Speaker," with the earnestness of an inspired orator. She was
                     afraid that his derangement might take a dangerous character, and, in her
                     apprehension, offered to forgive the rent which was due, if his friends would
                     only remove her eccentric lodger.</p>
                  <p>Seventy years after this (in 1838) Judge Day, who lived to almost a patriarchal
                     age, and had been intimate with Grattan in London, wrote a letter, in which,
                     describing him at college, "where he soon distinguished himself by a brilliant
                     elocution, a tenacious memory, and abundance of classical acquirements," he
                     proceeds to state that Grattan "always took great delight in frequenting the
                     galleries, first of the Irish, and then of the English House of Commons, and
                     the bars of the Lords." His biographer records that this amateur Parliamentary
                     attendance had greater attractions for him than the pleasures of the
                     metropolis, and that he devoted his evenings in listening, his nights in
                     recollecting, and his days in copying the great orators of the time. Judge Day
                     also has remembered that Grattan would spend whole moonlight nights in rambling
                     and losing himself in the thickest plantations of Windsor Forest, and "would
                     sometimes pause and address a tree in<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7173-00000167"
                     /> soliloquy, thus preparing himself early for that assembly which he was
                     destined in later life to adorn."</p>
                  <p>Such was Grattan's self-training. So did he prepare himself for that career of
                     brilliant utility and patriotism which has made his name immortal.</p>
                  <p>Events of great moment took place in England during Grattan's sojourn there.
                     The contest between John Wilkes and the Government was then in full course,
                     leading to important results, and encouraging, if it did not create, the
                     publication of the fearless and able letters of Junius. At that time, great men
                     were in the British Senate, and Grattan had the good fortune to hear their
                     eloquence, to watch the deeds in which they participated. The elder Pitt, who
                     had then withdrawn from the Commons, and exercised great power in the Upper
                     House, as Earl of Chatham, still took part in public business. There, too, was
                     Lord North—shrewd, obese, good-tempered, and familiar. There was Charles James
                     Fox, just commencing public life, alternately coquetting with politics and the
                     faro-table—his great rival, Pitt, had not then arisen, nor his eminent friend
                     Sheridan, but Edmund Burke had already made his mark, Barrè was in full force,
                     as well as Grenville, and the great lawyers Loughborough and Thurlow had
                     already appeared above the horizon, while Lords Camden and Mansfield were in
                     the maturity of fame. Then, also, flourished Charles Townshend, who would have
                     deserved the name of a great statesman but for his mistake in trying to obtain
                     revenue for England by taxation of America. There was the remarkable man called
                     "Singlespeech" Hamilton, from one brilliant oration which was declared by
                     Walpole to have eclipsed the most successful efforts even of the elder Pitt. In
                     the Irish Parliament, too, which he always visited when in Dublin during the
                     Session, were men of great eminence and ability, with some of whom—Flood,
                     Hutchinson, and Hussey Burgh—not long after, Grattan was himself to come into
                     intellectual gladiatorship. In both countries, therefore, he became familiar
                     with politics and politicians. What marvel if he deviated from the
                     technicalities of the law into the wider field of law-making and
                     statesmanship?</p>
                  <p>How closely he observed the eminent persons who thus came before his notice,
                     may be judged from the character of Lord Chatham, which was introduced in a
                     note to "Barataria," (a satirical <foreign xml:lang="FRA">brochure</foreign> by
                     Sir Hercules Langrishe), as if from a new edition of Robertson's History of
                     America. Many persons, at the time, who looked for it in Robertson, were
                     disappointed at not finding it there. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Apropos</foreign>
                     of Langrishe; it may be added that he it was who said—that the best History of
                     Ireland was to be found "in the continuation of <title>Rapin,</title>" and
                     excused the swampy state of the Phœnix Park demesne by supposing that the
                     Government neglected it, being so much occupied <emph>in draining the rest of
                        the kingdom.</emph>

                  <p>Greatly admiring the nervous eloquence of Lord Chatham, it is evident that
                     Grattan's own style was influenced, if not formed by it. He could not have had
                     a better model. Grattan, out of pure admiration of the man, reported several of
                     his speeches for his own subsequent use. Writing about him many years later, he
                     said, "He was a man of great genius—great flight of mind. His imagination was
                     astonishing. He was very great, and very odd.<ref rend="super"
                        target="#note_014" xml:id="return_014">*</ref> He never came with a prepared
                     harangue; his style was not regular oratory, like Cicero or Demosthenes, but it
                     was very fine, and very elevated, and above the ordinary subjects of discourse.
                     He appeared more like a pure character advising, than mixing in the debate. It
                     was something superior to that—<emph>it was teaching the lords, and lecturing
                        the King.</emph> He appeared the next greatest thing to the King, though
                     infinitely superior. What Cicero says in his 'CLARIS ORATORIBUS' exactly
                     applies: '<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Formæ dignitas, corporis motus plenus et
                        artis et venustatis, vocis et suavitas et magnitudo.</foreign>' 'Great
                     subjects, great empires, great characters, effulgent ideas, and classical
                     illustrations formed the material of his speeches."<ref rend="super"

                           this crutch.</emph>"</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>Until he permanently and finally took up his residence in Dublin, Grattan was
                     greatly prejudiced in favour of England. In August, 1771, he wrote to a friend
                     that he would return to Ireland that Christmas, "to live or die with you," and
                     added, "It is painful to renounce England, and my departure is to me the loss
                     of youth. I submit to it on the same principle, and am resigned." At that time
                     he was twenty-five years old.</p>
                  <p>In his letters to his friends at this time, he commented on Irish politics so
                     forcibly as to show that he was a close observer. Alluding to the means used by
                     the Viceroy (Lord Townshend) to corrupt the legislature, he said, "So total an
                     overthrow has Freedom received, that its voice is heard only in the accents of
                     despair." This sentence very probably sugggested the concluding part of Moore's
                     beautiful lyric, "The harp that once through Tara's halls," <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Thus Freedom now so seldom wakes,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">The only throb she gives,</l>
                           <l>Is when some heart indignant breaks,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">To show that still she lives."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Early in 1772, Grattan was called to the Irish bar—not from any predilection
                     for the profession, but from the necessity of eking out his limited means by
                     the exercise of his talent. It is recorded that having gone the circuit, and
                     failed to gain a<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7173-00000169"/> verdict in an
                     important case where he was specially retained, he actually returned to his
                     client half the amount of his fee—fifty guineas. A man who could act thus, was
                     clearly not fitted for the profession, not destined to arrive at wealth by its
                     means.</p>
                  <p>At that time the rising talent of Ireland was decidedly liberal, and in favor
                     of progress. Grattan was thrown into familiar intimacy with this society, and
                     his own opinions were influenced, if not determined, by the Catholic spirit of
                     their avowed principles. Lord Charlemont, Hussey Burgh, Robert Day, (afterwards
                     the Judge,) Dennis Daly, and Barry Yelverton—men whose names are familiar to
                     all who have read the history of Ireland's later years of nationality—were his
                     familiar friends.</p>
                  <p>Grattan wished for the lettered ease of literary retirement, but his narrow
                     means did not permit him to live without labour. He said, "What can a mind do
                     without the exercise of business, or the relaxation of pleasure?" He took to
                     politics as a relief from the demon of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui.</foreign>
                     He attended the debates in Parliament. He said "they were insipid; every one
                     was speaking; nobody was eloquent." He had become a lawyer, as he sadly
                     confessed, "without knowledge or ambition in his profession." He would fain
                     have gone into retirement, but complained that, in his too hospitable country,
                     "wherever you fly, wherever you secrete yourself, the sociable disposition of
                     the Irish will follow you, and in every barren ren spot of that kingdom you
                     must submit to a state of dissipation or hostility." He said that his passion
                     was retreat, for "there is certainly repose, and may be a defence, in
                     insignificance."</p>
                  <p>He was destined for better things. He had married Henrietta Fitzgerald, who
                     claimed descent from the Desmond family, (actually from that branch of which
                     that Countess of Desmond, who died at the age of 162, was the foundress,) but
                     had, as her own dowry, the far greater wealth of youth, beauty, virtue, talent,
                     and devoted affection. The union was eminently happy. Mrs. Grattan became the
                     mother of thirteen children, and it is known that on many occasions, but
                     especially in the troublous times of 1798 and 1800, (the rebellion and the
                     betrayal of Ireland by her parliament,) Grattan frequently consulted and acted
                     on the advice of his wife, which invariably was to do what was right,
                     regardless of personal consequences. After his marriage, he went to reside in
                     the county Wicklow, where, almost from early youth, he had been enamoured of
                     the beautiful scenery, and even then spoke of Tinnahinch, which he subsequently
                     purchased, as a place which might be "the recreation of an active life, or the
                     retreat of an obscure one, or the romantic residence of philosophical
                     friendship." "Here," said his son, "he mused in when melancholy, he rejoiced in
                     when gay; here he often trod, meditating on his country's wrongs—her long,
                     dreary night of oppression; and here he first<pb n="338-339"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000170"/> beheld the bright transient light of her
                     redemption and her glory." Here, too, in the moments of grief he wept over her
                     divisions and her downfall. The place continues a family possession, and,
                     identified as it is with the name of Grattan, should never be allowed to pass
                     into the possession of any others.</p>
                  <p>Grattan's wife, highly gifted by nature, and with her mind cultivated and
                     enlarged by education, urgently pressed him to embark in political life. She
                     knew, even better than himself, what his mental resources were, how patriotic
                     were his impulses, how great his integrity, how undaunted his courage. She
                     interested his friends in his behalf, and, at last, on the death of Mr.
                     Caulfield (Lord Charlemont's brother), Grattan was returned to Parliament for
                     the borough of Charlemont, and on the 11th of December, 1775, in his thirtieth
                     year, Henry Grattan took his seat as member for Charlemont. On the fourth day
                     after he made a speech—a spontaneous, unstudied, and eloquent reply—and it was
                     at once seen and admitted that his proper place was in Parliament. From that
                     day the life of Grattan can be read in the history of Ireland.</p>
                  <p>What he did may be briefly summed up. He established the Independence of
                     Ireland, by procuring the repeal of the statute by which it had been declared
                     that Ireland was inseparably annexed to the Crown of Great Britain, and bound
                     by British acts of Parliament, if named in them—that the Irish House of Lords
                     had no jurisdiction in matters of appeal—and that the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >dernier resort,</foreign> in all cases of law and equity, was to the peers
                     of Great Britain.</p>
                  <p>For his great services in thus establishing Ireland's rights, the Parliament
                     voted him ¥50,000. He considered that this was a retainer for the future as
                     well as a mark of gratitude for the past, and henceforth devoted the remainder
                     of his life—a period of nearly forty years—to the service of his country.</p>
                  <p>Grattan's last act, as an Irish legislator, was to oppose the Union, which
                     destroyed the nationality <emph>he</emph> had made—his last act, as a public
                     man, was to hurry to London, in his seventy-fifth year, under the infliction of
                     a mortal disease, to present the petition in favour of the Irish Catholics, and
                     support it, at the risk of life, in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Grattan's great achievements were all accomplished in early life, while the
                        "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">purpurea juventus</foreign>" was in its bloom,
                     while the heart was in its spring. Great men, of all shades of political and
                     party passion have been eager and eloquent in his praise. Byron, speaking of
                     Ireland, ranked him first among those <q>

                  <p>Lord Brougham said that it was "not possible to name any one, the purity of
                     whose reputation has been stained by so few faults, and the lustre of whose
                     renown is dimmed by so few imperfections." After describing the characteristics
                     of his eloquence, he added, "It may be truly said that Dante himself never
                     conjured up a striking image in fewer words than Mr. Grattan employed to
                     describe his relation towards Irish independence, when, alluding to its rise in
                     1782, and its fall, twenty years later, he said, 'I sat by its cradle—I
                     followed its hearse.'"</p>
                  <p>Sydney Smith, in an article in the <title>Edinburgh Review,</title> shortly
                     after Grattan's death, thus bore testimony to his worth:—"Great men hallow a
                     whole people, and lift up all who live in their time. What Irishman does not
                     feel proud that he has lived in the days of Grattan? who has not turned to him
                     for comfort, from the false friends and open enemies of Ireland? who did not
                     remember him in the days of its burnings, wastings and murders? No government
                     ever dismayed him—the world could not bribe him—he thought only of Ireland:
                     lived for no other object: dedicated to her his beautiful fancy, his elegant
                     wit, his manly courage, and all the splendour of his astonishing eloquence. He
                     was so born, so gifted, that poetry, forensic skill, elegant literature, and
                     all the highest attainments of human genius, were within his reach; but he
                     thought the noblest occupation of a man was to make other men happy and free;
                     and in that straight line he kept for fifty years, without one side-look, one
                     yielding thought, one motive in his heart which he might not have laid open to
                     the view of God or man."</p>
                  <p>The man to whom tributes such as these were voluntarily paid, must have been a
                     mortal of no ordinary character and merit.</p>

                  <head>DANIEL O'CONNELL.</head>
                  <p>DANIEL O'CONNELL, at one period called "the member for all Ireland," was born,
                     not at, but near Derrynane Abbey, in Kerry, on the 6th of August, 1775, and
                     died at Genoa on the 15th of May, 1847. He had nearly completed his
                     seventy-second year. For nearly forty years of that extended period he had been
                     a public man—perhaps the most public man in Ireland. For at least a quarter of
                     a century his reputation was not merely Irish—not British—nor European—but
                     unquestionably cosmopolitan.</p>
                  <p>Fallen as we are upon the evil days of Mediocrity, it may not be useless to
                     dwell upon the conduct and the character, the aims and the actions, of one who,
                     think of him as we may, candour must admit to be one of the great men of the
                     age,—one of the very few great men of Ireland's later years.</p>
                  <p>"Some men are born to greatness—some achieve greatness—and some have greatness
                     thrust upon them." Daniel O'Connell stands in a predicament between the two
                     latter postulates. He certainly was the artificer of his own fame and power,
                     but, as certainly, much of it arose out of the force of circumstances. When he
                     launched his bark upon the ocean of politics, he may have anticipated
                     something—much of success and eminence, but he never could have dreamed of
                     wielding such complete and magnificent power as was long at his command. Strong
                     determination, great ability, natural facility of expression, the art of using
                     strong words without committing himself, and a most elastic temperament,
                     ("prepared for either fortune," as Eugene Aram said of himself)—all these
                     formed an extraordinary combination, and yet all these, even in their unity,
                     might have been of little worth, but for the admitted fact that circumstances
                     happily occurred which allowed these qualities a fair scope for development.
                     Many poets, I dare swear, have lived and died unknown—either not writing at
                     all, or writing but to destroy what they had written. Noble orators have lived
                     and died, "mute and inglorious," because the opportunity for display had never
                     been given. In truth, we may say, with Philip Van Artevelde, <q>
                        <l>"The world knows nothing of its greatest men."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the curse of Authorship that until the grave fully closes upon his ashes,
                     the fame of the writer is scarcely or slightly acknowledged. When the turf
                     presses upon his remains, we yield tardy justice to his merits, and translate
                     him, as a star, into the "heaven of heavens" of renown. But the Orator,<pb
                        n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7173-00000173"/> on the other hand, has
                        <emph>his</emph> claims admitted from the commencement—he may make his fame
                     by one bold effort—he may win admiration at one bound, and each successive
                     trial, while it matures his powers, increases his reputation. He lives in the
                     midst of his fame—it surrounds him, like a halo: he is the observed of all
                     observers,—he has constant motive for exertion—he breathes the very atmosphere
                     of popularity, and has perpetual excitement to keep up his exertions. Of this
                     there scarcely ever was a more palpable example than O'Connell. Originally
                     gifted with all the attributes of a popular if not a great orator, he advanced,
                     by repeated efforts, to the foremost rank, because the public voice cheered
                     him—the public opinion fostered him. Had he, for three or four years, spoken to
                     dull or cold audiences, the world would probably have lost him as an orator. He
                     might, indeed, have been a great forensic speaker, but of that eloquence which
                     placed seven millions of Irish Catholics in a situation where, without being
                     branded as rebels, they might openly demand "justice for Ireland," the chance
                     is, the world have known nothing. What man, before this man, had ever succeeded
                     in awakening at once the sympathy of the old and of the new world? Few men so
                     well out-argued the sophistry of tyranny. Far above the crowd must he be, who,
                     at one and the same time, affrighted the Russian autocrat by his bold
                     invectives, and was appealed to as the common enemy of misrule, by the unhappy
                     victims of the "Citizen-King"—who not only asserted the rights of his fellow
                     slaves in Ireland, but hesitated not, at all times and in all places, to
                     express his <q>

                  <p>O'Connell was often denounced as a "Dictator." What made him one? The exclusive
                     laws which kept him humiliated in his native land. The wrongs of Ireland made
                     him what he was, and Misrule carefully maintained the laws which made those
                     wrongs. Had Ireland been justly governed, there would not have been occasion
                     for such "agitation" as Mr. O'Connell kept up. If the "agitator" was indeed the
                     monster which he was represented to be, Misrule is the Frankenstein which made
                     him so. The wrongs of Ireland and the tyranny of evil government goaded him
                     into action, and gave him power. Misrule sowed the wind, and reaped the
                     whirlwind.</p>
                  <p>It has been strongly asserted, and as strongly denied, that a long line of
                     ancestry gave O'Connell an hereditary right to take part in the public affairs
                     of his native land, as if he, and all of us, did not inherit that right as an
                     heir-loom derived from the first principles of nature. The tradition of his
                     house was that the O'Connell family were entitled to rank among the most
                     ancient in Ireland, antiquarians<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7173-00000174"/>
                     having avowed that his surname was derived from Conal Gabhra, a prince of the
                     royal line of Milesius—that they originally possessed immense estates in the
                     county of Limerick, and removed to the barony of Iveragh, in the western
                     extremity of Kerry, where they enjoyed the almost regal office of
                     Toparchs;—that, in the time of Elizabeth, their then chief, Richard O'Connell,
                     made submission of his lands to the British crown;—that the rebellion of 1641
                     removed the sept O'Connell to the County Clare, by forfeiture (a certain
                     Maurice O'Connell it was who forfeited his property in the Civil Wars of 1641
                     and received the estates in Clare as a partial indemnity; his uncle, Daniel
                     O'Connell of Aghgore, in Iveragh, took no share in the Civil War, and thus
                     preserved his estate);—that the Clare branch of the family supported James II.,
                     and, on the triumphs of the Orange party, had to seek in foreign lands the
                     distinctions from which the Penal Laws excluded it in its own.</p>
                  <p>One of these, a certain Daniel O'Connell, who subsequently was created Count of
                     "the Holy Roman Empire," disqualified, by his religion, from holding military
                     or civil rank in his own country, entered the French service in 1757—when he
                     was only fourteen years of age. He served in the seven years' war—at the
                     capture of Port Mahon, in 1779, and was severely wounded at the grand sortie on
                     Gibralter in 1782—remained faithful to Louis XVI., until fidelity was of no
                     further use—emigrated to England—was there appointed, in 1793, Colonel of the
                     6th Irish Brigade—retained that command until the corps was disbanded—returned
                     to France, at the Restoration, in 1814—was there and then restored to his rank
                     of General and Colonel-Commandant of the regiment of Salm, and named Grand
                     Cross of the Order of St. Louis—refused to take rank under Louis Philippe—and
                     died in 1834, aged ninety-one, a military patriarch, full of years and honours,
                     holding the rank of General in the French, and being oldest Colonel in the
                     English service. Count O'Connell was grand-uncle to "the Liberator."</p>
                  <p>It may not be generally known that the military tactics of Europe at the
                     present day have emanated from Count O'Connell. The French Government resolved,
                     in 1787, that the art of war should be thoroughly revised, and a military
                     board, consisting of four general officers and one colonel, was formed for that
                     purpose. Count O'Connell, who then commanded the Royal Suedois (or Swedish)
                     regiment, was justly accounted one of the most scientific officers in the
                     service, and was named as the junior member of that board. The other members
                     soon discovered how correct and original were the views of their colleague, and
                     unanimously confided to him the <emph>redaction</emph> of the whole military
                     code of France. So well did he execute this important commission, that his
                     tactics were followed in the early campaigns of revolutionized France, by
                        Napoleon—and<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7173-00000175"/> finally adopted by
                     Prussia, Austria, Russia and England.</p>
                  <p>To Morgan O'Connell, father of "the Liberator," descended none of the property
                     originally held by the family. His elder brother, Maurice, succeeded to a large
                     portion, (that which eventually was bequeathed to Daniel,) and it had the
                     peculiarity of being free from all chiefry, imposts, or Crown charge—an unusual
                     thing, and occurring only in the instance of very remote tenure. This portion
                     was held under what was called Shelburne leases—renewable for ever, and first
                     granted <emph>before</emph> the enactment of the Penal laws, and therefore not
                     "discoverable;" that is, not liable to be claimed from a Catholic holder by any
                     Protestant who chose to claim them.</p>
                  <p>Daniel O'Connell's father became a petty farmer and a small shop-keeper at
                     Cahirciveen. At that time he was simply known as "Morgan Connell,"—there being
                     some to this day who wholly deny the right of the family to the prefix of "O."
                     The Irish proverb says: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">

                  </p>
                  <p>The same doubters have contended that the independence pendence realized by
                     Morgan O'Connell was gained, not by farming nor by shop-keeping, but by
                     extensive smuggling. But it was gained in some manner, and with it was
                     purchased a small estate at Carhen, within a mile of Cahirciveen, where his
                     years of industry had been passed, and not far from Derrynane. It was at Carhen
                     that Daniel O'Connell was born, on the 6th August, 1775—the very day (he used
                     to say) on which were commenced hostilities between Great Britain and her
                     American colonies.</p>
                  <p>Daniel O'Connell's grandfather was the third son of twenty-two children. He
                     died in 1770, leaving as his successor his second son, Maurice (John, the
                     eldest, having predeceased him). This gentleman was never married, and it was
                     on his death, in 1825, that the "Agitator" succeeded him as owner of the
                     Derrynane estate. Morgan O'Connell (father to the "Liberator") died in 1809,
                     and left two other sons, who are also handsomely provided for—John, as owner of
                     Grena, and James of Lakeview, both places near Killarney.</p>
                  <p>I trust that I have not travelled out of my way to give this sketch of the
                     descent of the family connexions of O'Connell. It shows that, at any rate,
                        <emph>he</emph> is not the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">novus homo</foreign>—the
                     mere upstart, without the advantages of birth and fortune, which he was often
                     represented to be. At the same time, no O'Connell need be ashamed of what
                     honest industry accomplished—that much of<pb n="350-351"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000176"/> the landed property which O'Connell's father
                     inherited, held by John O'Connell of Grena, was purchased from the profits of
                     his business as a farmer and general shop-keeper.</p>
                  <p>From the first, Maurice O'Connell, of Derrynane, attached himself to his nephew
                     Daniel, whom he educated. The earliest instructions in any branch of learning
                     which the future "Liberator" received, were communicated to him by a poor
                     hedge-schoolmaster, of a class ever abounding in Kerry, where every man is said
                     to speak Latin. David Mahony happened to call at Carhen when little Daniel was
                     only four years old, took him in his lap, and taught him the alphabet in an
                     hour and a half. Some years later, he was regularly taught by Mr.
                     Harrington—one of the first priests who set up a school after the repeal of the
                     laws which made it penal for a Roman Catholic clergyman even to live in
                     Ireland. At the age of fourteen he went abroad with his brother Maurice to
                     obtain a good education.</p>
                  <p>Seventy years ago, the policy, or rather the impolicy of English domination
                     actually prohibited the education of the Catholics within Great Britain and
                     Ireland. They were, therefore, either compelled to put up with very limited
                     education, or forced to go abroad for instruction,—rather a curious mode of
                     predisposing their minds in favour of the English laws. Mr. O'Connell was
                     originally intended for the priesthood, and was educated at the Catholic
                     seminary of Louvain, next at St. Omer, and, finally, at the English college of
                     Douay, in France. But, at that time, there were fully as many lay as clerical
                     pupils at that college.</p>
                  <p>At St. Omer, Daniel O'Connell rose to the first place in all the classes, and
                     the President of the College wrote to his uncle, in Ireland—"I have but one
                     sentence to write about him, and that is, that I never was so mistaken in all
                     my life as I shall be, unless he be destined to make a remarkable figure in
                     society."</p>
                  <p>The two brothers commenced their homeward journey on the 21st of December,
                     1793—the very day on which Louis XVI, was guillotined at Paris. During their
                     journey from Douay to Calais, they were obliged to wear the revolutionary
                     cockade, for safety. But, as good Catholics, they were bound to abhor the
                     atrocities perpetrated, at that time, by the Jacobins, in the sacred name of
                     liberty, and when they stood on the deck of the English packet-boat,
                     indignantly tore the tri-colour from their hats, and flung them, with all
                     contempt, into the water. Some French fishermen, who saw the act, rescued the
                     cockades, and flung imprecations against the "aristocrats" who had rejected
                     them. At the same time, when an enthusiastic Irish republican, who had
                     "assisted" at the execution of Louis, exhibited a handkerchief stained with his
                     blood, the young students turned away and shunned him, in<pb n="352-353"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000177"/> disgust and abhorrence. Not then, nor at any
                     period of his career, was O'Connell an anti-monarchist. It is said that, during
                     the trial of Thomas Hardy, at London, (October, 1794,) for high treason, he was
                     so much shocked at the unfair means used by the Crown lawyers to convict the
                     accused—means foiled by eloquent Erskine and an honest jury—that he resolved to
                     place himself as a champion of Right against Might, and identify himself with
                     the cause of the people. While he was on the Continent, that relaxation of the
                     Penal laws took place which allowed the Catholic to become a barrister. It is
                     probable that <emph>this</emph> was the immediate cause of his becoming a
                     lawyer. A young man of his sanguine temperament was likely to prefer the bar,
                     with its temporal advantages,—its scope for ambition,—its excitement,—its fame,
                     to the more secluded life of an ecclesiastic. Accordingly, I find that he
                     entered as a law-student at Lincoln's Inn, in January, 1794—eat the requisite
                     number of term-dinners there, for two years—pursued the same qualifying course
                     of "study" at King's Inn, Dublin, and was called to the Irish bar, in Easter
                     term, 1798, in the 23d year of his age.</p>
                  <p>The Rebellion was in full fling at the time, and (in order, no doubt, to show
                     his "loyalty" as a Catholic) he joined what was called "the lawyers' corps,"
                     associated to assist the Government in putting down revolt.</p>
                  <p>The period of his admission was singularly favourable. Catholics had just been
                     admitted to the Irish bar—to the minor honours of the profession; although it
                     was hoped, and not extravagantly, that, in time, all its privileges would be
                     thrown open to them. It was impossible to say what was Mr. O'Connell's ambition
                     at the time; however high, he could not have had a dream of the elevation which
                     he subsequently reached. He must have felt, however, that he had a wide field
                     for the exercise of his abilities. His ostensible ambition, for many years, was
                     to become a good lawyer. During what is called "the long vacation," and at
                     other periods when he could spare time, he resided a good deal with his uncle
                     in Kerry, where he pursued the athletic sports in which, almost to the close of
                     his career, he delighted to participate. On one occasion, while out upon a
                     hunting expedition, he put up at a peasant's cabin, sat for some hours in his
                     wet clothes, and contracted a typhus fever. In his delirium he often repeated
                     the lines from Home's tragedy of Douglas: <q>

                  <p>His son has preserved a letter, written in December, 1795, when he was in his
                     twenty-first year, in<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7173-00000178"/> which he
                     communicates his views to his uncle Maurice, of Derrynane. A passage or two may
                     be worth quoting, to show with what earnestness he devoted himself to the
                     career upon which he was then preparing to enter. He says, "I have now two
                     objects to pursue—the one, the attainment of knowledge; the other, the
                     acquisition of all those qualities which constitute the polite gentleman. I am
                     convinced that the former, besides the immediate pleasure which it yields,
                        <emph>is calculated to raise me to honour, rank, and fortune</emph> [how
                     prophetic were the young man's aspirations!]; and I know that the latter serves
                     as a general passport or first recommendation; and, as for the motives of
                     ambition which you suggest, I assure you that no man can possess more of it
                     than I do. I have, indeed, a glowing, and—if I may use the expression—an
                     enthusiastic ambition, <emph>which converts every toil into a pleasure, and
                        every study into an amusement.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>He adds, in the same honourable spirit, "Though nature may have given me
                     subordinate talents, I never will be satisfied with a subordinate situation in
                     my profession. No man is able, I am aware, to supply the total deficiency of
                     abilities, but every body is capable of improving and enlarging a stock,
                     however small, and, in its beginning, contemptible. It is this reflection that
                     affords me most consolation. If I do not rise at the bar, I will not have to
                     meet the reproaches of my own conscience. Indeed deed, as for my knowledge in
                     the professional line, that cannot be discovered for some years to come; but I
                     have time in the interim to prepare myself to appear with greater <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">éclat</foreign> on the grand theatre of the world."</p>
                  <p>As a barrister, he naturally took the Munster circuit, and here his family
                     connexion operated very much in his favour. In the counties of Clare, Limerick,
                     Kerry and Cork, he had relatives in abundance, and being, I believe, the first
                     Catholic who had gone that circuit, he naturally engrossed a considerable
                     portion of the business which the Catholics had previously, <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">ex necessitate,</foreign> distributed among the barristers of
                     a contrary persuasion. He succeeded, moreover, in establishing the reputation
                     of being a shrewd, clever, hard-working lawyer, and briefs flowed in so
                     abundantly, that he may be cited as one instance, amid the ten thousand
                     difficulties of the bar, of great success being immediately acquired. There was
                     nothing precarious in this success; he was evidently a shrewd, clever,
                     long-headed lawyer, and while the Catholics gave him briefs, because of his
                     family and religion, the Protestants, not less wise, were not backward in
                     engaging his assistance—not that they much loved the man, but that his
                     assistance was worth having, as that of a man with a clear head, a well-filled
                     mind, strong natural eloquence, and, from the very first, a mastery over the
                     art of cross-examining witnesses.</p>
                  <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7173-00000179"/>
                  <p>O'Connell's friends scarcely anticipated, from what his youth had been, the
                     success which met him on his first step into active manhood. He held his first
                     brief at the Kerry Assizes, in Tralee. Between a country gentleman named
                     Brusker Segerson and the O'Connells there long had been a family feud. Brusker
                     accused one of the O'Connell tenants at Iveragh, of sundry crimes and
                     misdemeanors, which judge and jury had "well and truly to try and determine."
                     Young O'Connell had his maiden brief in this case. Brusker, knowing the young
                     lawyer's inexperience, anticipated a triumph over him, and invited a party of
                     friends to witness the "fatal facility" with which the accused would be
                     worsted. But it happened not only that the accused was the acquitted, but there
                     was a general opinion, from the facts on the trial, that Brusker Segerson's
                     conduct had been oppressive, if not illegal. Brusker turned round to his
                     friends and soundly swore that "Morgan O'Connell's <emph>fool</emph> was a
                     great lawyer, and would be a great man." Henceforth he always employed
                     O'Connell—but with the distinct and truly Irish understanding that the
                     hereditary and personal feud between them should in no wise be diminished!</p>
                  <p>One of O'Connell's earliest displays of acuteness was at Tralee, in the year
                     1799, shortly after he had been called to the bar. In an intricate case, where
                     he was junior counsel (having got the brief more as a family compliment than
                     from any other cause), the question in dispute was as to the validity of a
                     will, which had been made almost in <foreign xml:lang="LAT">articulo
                        mortis.</foreign> The instrument was drawn up with proper form: the
                     witnesses were examined, and gave ample confirmation that the deed had been
                     legally executed. One of them was an old servant, possessed of a strong passion
                     for loquacity. It fell to O'Connell to cross-examine him, and the young
                     barrister allowed him to speak on, in the hope that he might say too much. Nor
                     was this hope disappointed. The witness had already sworn that he saw the
                     deceased sign the will. "Yes," continued he, with all the garrulousness of old
                     age, "I saw him sign it, and surely <emph>there was life in him at the
                        time.</emph>" The expression, frequently repeated, led O'Connell to
                     conjecture that it had a peculiar meaning. Fixing his eye upon the old man he
                     said,—"You have taken a solemn oath before God and man to speak the truth and
                     the <emph>whole</emph> truth: the eye of God is upon you; the eyes of your
                     neighbours are fixed upon you also. Answer me, by the virtue of that sacred and
                     solemn oath which has passed your lips, <emph>was the testator alive when he
                        signed the will?</emph>" The witness was struck with the solemn manner in
                     which he was addressed, his colour changed—his lips quivered—his limbs
                     trembled, and he faltered out the reply—"<emph>there was life in him.</emph>"
                     The question was repeated in a yet more impressive manner, and the result was
                     that O'Connell half compelled, half cajoled him to admit<pb n="358-359"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000180"/> that, after life was extinct, a pen had been put
                     into the testator's hand,—that one of the party guided it to sign his name,
                     while, as a salvo, for the consciences of all concerned, a living fly was put
                     into the dead man's mouth, to qualify the witnesses to bear testimony that
                     "there was life in him" when he signed that will. This fact, thus extorted from
                     the witness, preserved a large property in a respectable and worthy family, and
                     was one of the first occurrences in O'Connell's legal career worth mentioning.
                     Miss Edgeworth, in her "Patronage," has an incident not much different from
                     this; perhaps suggested by it. The plaintiffs in this case were two sisters
                     named Langton, both of whom still enjoy the property miraculously preserved to
                     them by the ingenuity of O'Connell; they were connexions of my own (Sarah
                     Langton, the youngest, was married to my cousin, Frank Drew, of Drewscourt),
                     and I have often heard them relate the manner in which he had contrived to
                     elicit the truth.</p>
                  <p>It is no common skill which can protect innocence from shame, or rescue guilt
                     from punishment. Nothing less than an intimate knowledge of the feelings of the
                     jury, and the habits and characteristics of the witnesses, can enable an
                     advocate to throw himself into the confidence of a jury composed of the most
                     incongruous elements, and to confuse, baffle, or detect the witnesses. There is
                     no power so strong as that of good cross-examination; and I never knew any man
                     possess that power in a more eminent degree than O'Connell. The difficulty is
                     to avoid asking too many questions. Sometimes a single query will weaken
                     evidence, while a word more may make the witness confirm it. Some witnesses
                     require to be pressed, before they bring out the truth—others, if too much
                     pressed, will turn at bay, and fatally corroborate every thing to which they
                     already have sworn. It is no common skill which, intuitively as it were,
                     enables the advocate to perceive when he may go to the end of his tether,—when
                     he <emph>must</emph> restrain. The fault of a young barrister is that <emph>he
                        asks too many questions.</emph> It is a curious fact, that, from the first
                     moment he was called to the bar, O'Connell distinguished himself by his
                     cross-examinations. If he was eminent in a criminal trial, he was no less so in
                     civil cases. Here he brought all his legal learning to bear upon the case, and
                     here, too, he had the additional aid of that eloquence which usually drew a
                     jury with him.</p>
                  <p>John O'Connell gives an anecdote which illustrates his father's success in the
                     defence of his prisoners. It had fallen to his lot, at the Assizes in Cork, to
                     be retained for a man on a trial for an aggravated case of highway robbery. By
                     an able cross-examination, O'Connell was enabled to procure the man's
                     acquittal. The following year, at the Assizes for the same town, he found
                     himself again retained for the same individual, then on trial for a burglary,
                        committed<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7173-00000181"/> mitted with great
                     violence, very little short of a deliberate attempt to murder. On this
                     occasion, the result of Mr. O'Connell's efforts rose a disagreement of the
                     jury; and, therefore, no verdict. The Government witnesses having been entirely
                     discredited during the cross-examination, the case was pursued no farther, and
                     the prisoner was discharged. Again, the succeeding year, he was found in the
                     criminal dock; this time on a charge of piracy! He had run away with a collier
                     brig, and having found means for disposing of a portion of her cargo, and
                     afterwards of supplying himself with some arms, he had actually commenced
                     cruising on his own account, levying contributions from such vessels as he
                     chanced to fall in with. Having "caught a tartar," whilst engaged in this
                     profitable occupation, he was brought into Cove, and thence sent up to Cork to
                     stand his trial for "piracy on the high seas." Again Mr. O'Connell saved him,
                     by demurring to the jurisdiction of the Court—the offence having been committed
                     within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and, therefore, cognizable only
                     before an Admiralty Court. When the fellow saw his successful counsel facing
                     the dock, he stretched over to speak to him, and, raising his eyes and hands
                     most piously and fervently to heaven, he cried out—"Oh, Mr. O'Connell, may the
                     Lord spare you—<emph>to me!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Here let me give my opinion, that the disqualification cation of his religious
                     tenets, which kept him in a stuff gown while his juniors in standing, and
                     inferiors in talent, were strutting about with all professional honour, was
                        <emph>not</emph> much detriment to O'Connell's advancement. Here was a man,
                     confessedly at the head of his profession, yet excluded from its honours by
                     unjust and intolerant laws—it became, therefore, a practice to consider him a
                     martyr for the sake of his religion, and he got many and many a brief because
                     such was the feeling. His disqualification as a Catholic gained him business as
                     a Barrister.</p>
                  <p>The Union failed to make Ireland happy—because the chains of the Catholics were
                     still allowed to gall them, instead, as Mr. Pitt contemplated, of being removed
                     with the least possible delay. George III. threw himself between Ireland and
                     justice. Relief was expected from Mr. Fox, and might, perhaps, have been
                     granted, but the death of that statesman, almost immediately succeeded by an
                     Anti-Catholic Ministry, sounded the knell to the hopes of the people of
                     Ireland. It was at this time that Mr. O'Connell came forward as a politician;
                     he had personal reasons for doing so, because, now being in the enjoyment of a
                     very excellent practice at the bar, he found numerous vexations arising from
                     the privileges enjoyed by men less talented, less qualified than himself, but
                     who enjoyed the advantages which religious and political "ascendency" gave
                     them.</p>
                  <p>The Catholics at last threw themselves into an<pb n="362-363"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000182"/> attitude of defence. O'Connell's first decided
                        step<ref rend="super" target="#note_016" xml:id="return_016">*</ref> was the
                     taking part in the proceedings of a meeting of Catholics, held in Dublin in
                     May, 1809. Then, for the first time for over a hundred years, Catholics
                     literally "spoke out." Their daring appeared to draw strength for their
                     despair. What was called "the Catholic Committee" was formed, and this,
                     strongly against O'Connell's advice, violated the law by assuming a
                        <emph>representative</emph> character. Lord Killeen (eldest son of the Earl
                     of Fingal, a Catholic peer), and some others of the leaders, were prosecuted by
                     the Government. They were defended by O'Connell, and Ireland then witnessed the
                     almost unprecedented circumstance of Catholic agitators being acquitted by a
                     Protestant jury in Dublin.</p>
                  <note place="foot" xml:id="note_016">
                     <p><ref target="#return_016">*</ref>O'Connell's first public speech was against
                        the Union. It was made on January 13,1800, at a Catholic meeting in Dublin,
                        in unequivocal condemnation of that measure. The resolutions that day
                        adopted were drawn up by O'Connell.</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>The Catholic Committee, however, became alarmed, and broke up. Then was formed
                     the Catholic Board, at which it was a matter of dispute whether Emancipation
                     might not be purchased by allowing the Crown to pay the Catholic clergy, and
                     giving the head of the Church of England a veto on the appointment of Catholic
                     bishops in Ireland. Feeble and vacillating, the greater portion of the Catholic
                     nobility held aloof from the struggle, in which O'Connell took the popular
                     side. Later in the day, Sheil entered the arena, and assumed an antagonistic
                     position.</p>
                  <p>The late Duke of Richmond (Viceroy of Ireland) put down the Catholic Board by
                     means of his Attorney-General Saurin. The members of that Board, as some small
                     acknowledgment for the services of their colleague, voted Mr. O'Connell a piece
                     of plate, of the value of 1000<abbr>l.</abbr> The Board being put down, the
                     Catholic cause would have fallen but for the intrepidity of O'Connell, who
                     assumed the leadership at once, and published a letter, continued annually for
                     a long time, in which he stated the wrongs of Ireland, with her claims for
                     relief, and suggested the mode of action. This annual message had the motto,
                     from Childe Harold, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l rend="ti-1">"Hereditary bondsmen, know ye not,</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Saurin is said to have seriously contemplated prosecuting O'Connell for
                     sedition because of this motto from "Childe Harold."</p>
                  <p>The Catholic Board was suppressed, it is true, but there remained a thousand
                     modes of action by which the spirit of patriotism might be kept alive in
                     Ireland. Aggregate and other public meetings were instantly held, and at one of
                     these Mr. O'Connell, in 1815, designated the Corporation of Dublin as a
                     "beggarly corporation." A member of that "beggarly" and bankrupt body took upon
                     himself to<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7173-00000183"/> play the bravo in its
                     defence. This man was a Mr. D'Esterre, and is understood to have had a promise
                     of patronage from the Corporation (in the shape of a good berth), if he humbled
                     the pride of O'Connell. It is more charitable than reasonable to hope that the
                     Corporation were not so ruffianly as to hold out this hope to D'Esterre,
                     because he was notoriously the best shot in Dublin; and yet, such "honourable"
                     assassination is exactly what such a body would reward, if they did not suggest
                     it.</p>
                  <p>D'Esterre paraded the streets of Dublin with a horse-whip in his hand, and
                     vowed vengeance against O'Connell. He did not meet him; but he afterwards
                     challenged him. O'Connell refused to apologize—met the challenger, and mortally
                     wounded him. D'Esterre, as I have said, was a crack shot, and O'Connell was
                     not; but it sometimes happens that the practiced duellist suffers the penalty
                     which he has inflicted upon others.</p>
                  <p>D'Esterre had been an officer of marines, and it has been stated, and always
                     believed, that he constituted himself the Champion of the Corporation, not only
                     in the hope, but with a direct promise of obtaining a lucrative appointment,
                     provided that he "silenced" O'Connell. The odds were five to one in his
                     favour—for he was cool and determined, and could snuff a candle with a pistol
                     shot at twelve paces. His skill, his coolness, availed not. At the first shot
                     he fell, and his death speedily followed.</p>
                  <p>Soon after, Sir Robert Peel (the then Irish Secretary) fastened a quarrel upon
                     Mr. O'Connell, who again placed himself in the hands of his friends. A hostile
                     meeting was appointed—the authorities in Dublin interfered—the parties were
                     bound over to keep the peace—they agreed to meet on the Continent, but the duel
                     was ultimately prevented by the arrest of Mr. O'Connell, in London, on his way
                     to Calais. He was held to bail before the Chief Justice of the King's Bench,
                     not to fight Mr. Peel; and since that time declined any further meetings of the
                        sort.<ref rend="super" target="#note_017" xml:id="return_017">*</ref> It
                     would have been well if, when he determined to avoid duels, O'Connell had also
                     resolved to abstain from language offensive to men of honour and men of
                     feeling. His chief fault, during his last thirty years, was the application of

                     opponents, which appear to have been culled rather in the market of
                     Billingsgate, than in the flowery garden of Academe!</p>

                     <p><ref target="#return_017">*</ref>It was the late Dr. England, Catholic
                        Bishop of Charleston, S. C., who then resided near Cork, who pointed out to
                        O'Connell the conjoint sin and folly of duelling, and induced him to promise
                        that he would never again appeal to arms. It was reported, at the time, that
                        O'Connell had lingered in London, when Peel expected him at Calais, awaiting
                        news of his wife's health (he had left her ill in Dublin), and that another
                        public character had declined a challenge on the plea of his daughter's

                  <p>For several years after the duel with D'Esterre, O'Connell was almost alone in
                     the struggle for Emancipation. His practice steadily increased, and his legal
                     knowledge, ability and tact, united with wondrous art in the examination of
                     witnesses, and great influence with juries (by the union of a species of
                     rhetoric consisting of common sense, humour, and rough eloquence, cemented
                     together by a good share of "Blarney"), soon made him a very successful
                     barrister. Whenever a Catholic victim was to be defended or rescued, whether an
                     Orange oppressor was to be assailed and punished, O'Connell was in the van. The
                     Catholics readily took him as their champion, and he won their gratitude by his
                     services, and gained their personal attachment by a good humour which nothing
                     could daunt, and a plain, straightforward, affectionate manner of eloquence
                     which went directly home to their hearts. To this hour it is a moot point
                     whether the Irish had greater admiration for his talents, gratitude for his
                     services, confidence in his fidelity, or attachment for his person.</p>
                  <p>He continued increasing in influence for many years. From 1815, until he
                     relinquished most of his practice in 1831, the annual income from his
                     professional pursuits cannot have averaged less than from ¥6000 to ¥8000—an
                     immense sum for a lawyer to make in Ireland. No man could make such an income,
                     except one who was at once an excellent Nisi Prius pleader, as well as a good
                     Crown lawyer. He united the highest qualifications of both. He could wield at
                     will immense power over a jury, and argue with a success rarely equalled, so as
                     to reach the understanding of a judge. Hence, he had the most extraordinary
                     versatility. You would see him at one o'clock joking a jury out of a verdict in
                     the Nisi Prius court, or familiarly laying down cases for the information of
                     the judge; and, the next hour, you might behold him in the Crown court,
                     defending an unhappy man accused of murder, and exercising a caution and
                     prudence in his unparalleled cross-examination of witnesses which would alike
                     surprise and please. No man could more readily get the truth from a witness, or
                     make him say only just as much as suits the particular point he had in
                     view.</p>
                  <p>In 1821, when George the Fourth visited Ireland, Mr. O'Connell made "his first
                     appearance, by particular desire," in the part of a courtier. He presented a

                     sacrificed his feelings, as a Catholic, in order to conciliate the Ascendency

                  <p>In 1823, O'Connell, finding how little was to be anticipated from George IV.
                     (who, as king, forgot the promises he made when Prince of Wales), organized a
                     great plan for uniting his Catholic countrymen into an array against the laws
                     which excluded them from the enjoyment of their civil and religious rights. He
                     had great difficulty in arousing the languid energies of the Irish people, so
                     hopeless had they been for a long time. At last, the Catholic Association
                     assumed a "local habitation and a name." The subscription to the somewhat
                     aristocratical Catholic Board had been five pounds a year—one fifth of that
                     amount was the payment to the Association; and, at last, the Catholic Rent was
                     instituted on the basis of admitting contributions of a shilling a year. Every
                     subscriber to this small amount thereby became a member of the Association, and
                     crowds eagerly joined it, on these terms, from all parts of Ireland. Here were
                     agitation and combination. Here was money, the very sinews of war. Here was a
                     fund, large in amount, annually augmenting, applicable to a variety of purposes
                     connected with the assertion of the Catholic claims and the defence of
                     Catholics, who thought themselves individually wronged or injured by their
                     Orange masters. Here, with O'Connell at their head, was a band of leaders, most
                     of them in the practice of the law, who had station, influence, audacity,
                     courage, integrity, and the art of moving the multitude by voice or pen. The
                     Government speedily feared, and felt, it to be an <foreign xml:lang="LAT"

                     funds, headed by able and fearless men, the Association assumed the duty of
                     standing between the people and the mal-administration<pb n="370-371"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000186"/> tration of the law. Every local act of tyranny,
                     intolerance and oppression was exposed, if it were not visited with exemplary
                     punishment. The complaints of the people were heard, through the influence of
                     the leaders, within the very walls of the Imperial Parliament. A brilliant
                     arena was opened for Catholic talent, for the Association held its discussions
                     like a regular legislative assembly, and its debates were spread abroad, all
                     over the kingdom, on the wings of the press. Of the whole system O'Connell was
                     the motive power—the head—the heart. His influence was immense.</p>
                  <p>Such an array could not be beheld by any government with indifference. It was
                     determined to put down the Association by act of Parliament. In 1825, O'Connell
                     formed one of a deputation to England, to make arrangements for an adjustment
                     of the Catholic claims—committed the error of consenting to take Emancipation
                     clogged with "the wings" (that is, to State payment for the Catholic clergy,
                     and confiscation of the 40s. elective franchise), but finally admitted his
                     mistake, and his error of judgment was forgiven by his countrymen. The
                     Association was suppressed. O'Connell, whose policy was to baffle rather than
                     to contest, and whose boast ever was that he agitated "within the law," allowed
                     the Catholic Association to dissolve itself, but continued the agitation by
                     "aggregate meetings" in nearly every county of Ireland, and by the
                     establishment of a new Catholic Association, formed ostensibly for purposes of
                     charity alone. The Government could do nothing against this.</p>
                  <p>In 1826, when a general election took place, O'Connell brought into unexpected
                     operation the forces which he commanded. He started popular candidates in
                     several Irish counties, and defeated the former members, who had always voted
                     against the Catholics. The lesson was a striking one, but the Executive in
                     Downing-street heeded it not, and declared unmitigated and perpetual enmity
                     against the Catholics. On the other hand, the Association pledged itself to
                     oppose every candidate connected with the government. In 1828, a vacancy
                     occurred, by Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald (who himself had always voted for Catholic
                     Emancipation) having accepted a seat in the Duke of Wellington's Cabinet, and
                     then O'Connell ventured the bold experiment of contesting the representation of
                     Clare. He was returned after a most severe contest—forced Wellington, by that
                     election to concede Emancipation—claimed his seat under that concession—was
                     refused by Manners Sutton, the Speaker—was re-elected for Clare<ref

                  <p>The influence of O'Connell continued great, with the Government, as well as in
                     Ireland, while the Whigs were in office. But the Melbourne ministry broke up in
                     the autumn of 1841, and "Othello's occupation" was gone when they went over to
                     the opposition benches. In 1843, it is true, he made renewed, important and
                     remarkable attempts to excite Ireland—to agitate (within the law) against the
                     government of which Sir Robert Peel was the head, but he was prosecuted, and
                     the Monster Trials, lasting twenty-five days, and ending in his conviction and
                     imprisonment, first taught his countrymen that he was not infallible nor
                     invulnerable. His conviction was subsequently annulled by the House of Lords,
                     on appeal, but the iron had entered into his soul, and when he resumed his seat
                     in Parliament he evidently was breaking. Then followed the revolt against his
                     supremacy by the vigorous and more decided "Young Ireland" party, and, with
                     failing health and defeated aims, he went to the Continent—his desire being to
                     visit that imperial and Papal Rome of which he had long been the energetic and
                     obedient servant. He died before he accomplished his pilgrimage; but his heart
                     rests in the Eternal City.</p>
                  <p>Here it can scarcely be out of place to glance at O'Connell's success as a
                     Parliamentary orator.</p>
                  <p>In the British Parliament, where oratorical success is usually very difficult,
                     Irishmen have generally shown themselves not merely good, but even eloquent
                     speakers. Edmund Burke may challenge mention alongside of the great Chatham—and
                     will have a more permanent place of honour, because his speeches, admirable
                     even as compositions, now belong to the standard classics of the Anglo-Saxon
                     race. Sir Philip Francis (the reputed author of "The Letters of Junius") was
                     not inferior, in power and effect, to the younger Pitt. Richard Brinsley
                     Sheridan and George Canning nobly maintained the national credit, as
                     transcendently eloquent men. Lord Wellesley and Henry Grattan occupy a first
                     position as great orators. In later days, assuredly<pb n="374-375"

                     not been surpassed by any of their rivals. Whenever Irish parliamentary
                     eloquence is spoken of, William Conyngham Plunket cannot be overlooked. He was,
                     perhaps, the very best speaker in the British Parliament at any time. He had
                     few of the ordinary characteristics of Irish eloquence. Wit he possessed in a
                     high degree, but was chary in its use. Pathos he rarely ventured upon—though
                     there are some incidental touches at once tearful and tender. He relied on
                     clear arrangement of facts, logical closeness of reasoning, strong earnestness,
                     remarkable sagacity, and the exercise of tact and common sense which a spirit
                     at once strong and ardent had disciplined and exercised. His manner, also,
                     grave and almost austere, added weight to his words of power. He succeeded
                     Grattan in the leadership of the Catholic party in Parliament, and his speech
                     (in 1821) converted nine votes from hostility to justice. It was on this
                     occasion, alluding to the great departed who had joined in the discussions
                     relative to Ireland's claims for civil and religious liberty, that he
                     said—"Walking before the sacred images of the illustrious dead, as in a public
                     and solemn procession, shall we not dismiss all party feelings, all angry
                     passions, all unworthy prejudices? I will not talk of past disputes; I will not
                     mingle in this act of national justice anything that can awaken personal
                     animosity."</p>
                  <p>It was not, however, in the English legislature, but during the last twenty
                     years of the Irish Parliament, that Irish eloquence was in its zenith. On one
                     hand were Fitzgibbon and Scott (afterwards Lords Clare and Clonmel), Connolly,
                     Cavendish, and Arthur Wolfe. On the other side was such an array of talent,
                     patriotism, and eloquence as, in the same period of time, has never been
                     surpassed—never equalled. There were Hussey Burgh and James Fitzgerald, Flood
                     and Grattan, Curran and Barry Yelverton, Plunket and Saurin, Parnell and Denis
                     Daly, Brownlow and Saxton Perry, Foster and Ponsonby, Goold and Peter Burrowes,
                     silvery-tongued Bushe and honest Robert Holmes. Most of these were lawyers, and
                     made an exception to the general rule that the eloquence of the Bar and of the
                     Senate are so different in character as to seem almost incompatible in
                     practice. In Ireland, during her last days of nationality, the great cause for
                     which they were contending, appeared to have animated the members of the bar
                     with a spirit which disdained all narrow limits of conventionality, and
                     elevated them above the ordinary routine of common life. We read, in Holy Writ,
                     how one of the seraphim touched Isaiah's lips with fire, and, with little
                     effort of the imagination, we may well believe that Patriotism, in like manner,
                     touched the lips of Irishmen, during that hard struggle for the very existence
                     of their nation, at once hallowing and<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7173-00000189"
                     /> purifying the words which fell from them. But such eloquence was only a
                     flash amid darkness, too brilliant to stay, and force and fraud were evil
                     spirits superior, at that time, to Truth, Virtue, and Eloquence. The day may
                     come when Ireland shall once again be a nation,—may the Past then and forever
                     be a lesson and a warning.</p>
                  <p>It is singular that, in the Irish Parliament, nearly all the great speakers
                     have been lawyers. With few exceptions, men of law have not succeeded in the
                     English Parliament. Lords Mansfield, Lyndhurst and Brougham, with Romilly and
                     Follett, are the chief exceptions. Camden, Thurlow, Eldon, Gifford, Cottenham,
                     Truro, St. Leonards, Erskine, Scarlett, Stowell, Tenterden, Best, and a great
                     many more did not maintain, in Parliament, the reputation they had won at the
                     bar. Three Irishmen, however, albeit members of the legal profession, have
                     taken the lead in the British Senate, even in our own time. These were Plunket,
                     O'Connell, and Sheil.</p>
                  <p>Of Plunket and Sheil there may be another occasion and opportunity of speaking.
                     It is of O'Connell that I would record a few impressions now. It must be
                     remembered that when he entered Parliament, in 1829, he had entered into his
                     fifty-fifth year. Plunket was at least ten years younger when he too entered
                     the British House of Commons. Sheil was little more than thirty-six when he
                     took his seat. It was feared by his friends and hoped by his enemies that, like
                     Erskine and other great advocates, O'Connell would fail in Parliament. True it
                     was that Grattan was fifty-nine before he first spoke in the English House of
                     Commons—but Grattan was one in ten thousand. Besides, he was all his life a
                     parliamentary speaker, which is very different from being a lawyer in full
                     practice also—the essentials for success at the bar and in the Senate being far
                     apart. Grattan himself, speaking of his great rival, Flood, who had greatly
                     distinguished himself in the Irish, and as greatly failed, in the English
                     Parliament, said "he forgot that he was a tree of the forest, too old and too
                     great to be transplanted at fifty."</p>
                  <p>O'Connell's opponents confidently anticipated his failure. He is too much of a
                     mob-orator, was the cry of one set. He will never please so refined an assembly
                     as the British House of Commons; he is too much of a lawyer, said another
                     section of ill-wishers, and we know how perpetually lawyers fail in the House.
                     His accent is dead against him, lisped a few others, and will be laughed at as
                     vulgar. One of his most violent antagonists was Lord Eldon, before whom he had
                     appeared, in an appeal case before the Lords, when he visited London in 1825
                     (on the memorable occasion of "the Wings"); but this Chancellor, inimical as he
                     was, turned round to Lord Wynford (then Sir W. D. Best), when the<pb
                        n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7173-00000190"/> speech was ended, and said, "What a
                     knowledge of law!—how condensed, yet how clear his argument!—how extremely
                     gentlemanly, and even courtierly is his manner. Let him only be in the House
                     once, and he will carry every thing before him." Many even of O'Connell's own
                     friends doubted whether he could accommodate himself to the manners, fashion,
                     habits, and restrictions of that very artificial assemblage, presumed to
                     contain "the collective wisdom of the nation," but the slightest doubt on the
                     subject does not appear to have cast its shadow into his own mind. To him, as
                     to Lady Macbeth, there was no such word as—fail! Like Nelson, he did not know
                     what fear was.</p>
                  <p>His putting up for Clare Election, in 1828, was one of the boldest measures
                     ever ventured on—short of raising the banner of revolt against the government.
                     It compelled Wellington and Peel to concede Catholic Emancipation—a concession
                     ungracious and ungrateful, since it was clogged with a clause, the result of
                     personal spite, prohibiting O'Connell, because he had been elected in 1828,
                     from taking the oaths contained in the Relief Bill of 1829. That prohibition
                     sent him back to Clare for re-election, and he entered Parliament with his mind
                     not unnaturally angry at the injustice for which <emph>he</emph> had been
                     singled out as a victim.</p>
                  <p>He took his seat, and, almost immediately, it was perceived that he was not to
                     be trifled with. Nature ture had been bountiful to him. In stature tall, and so
                     strongly built that it was only by seeing, when a man of ordinary height was by
                     his side, how much he over-topped him. Physical vigour and mental strength were
                     well combined in him. Then, his voice—a miraculous organ, full of power, but
                     not deficient, either, in mellow sweetness. His glance told little—but his lips
                     were singularly expressive, as much so as the eyes are to ordinary mortals. Add
                     to this, a full consciousness of power—a conviction that he had been the main
                     agent for opening Parliament to his hitherto prohibited co-religionists—that
                     Ireland looked to him, and not without cause, for a great deal more—that he
                     virtually represented, not the men of Clare only, but was "Member for all
                     Ireland,"—that he was a tactician, trained by thirty years of public life,—that
                     he had also the practiced skill in handling all the available points of an
                     argument which his professional career had given him,—and that he then looked
                     upon Emancipation only as an instalment. Put all these together, and it will be
                     seen, at once, that the man in whom they were embodied could scarcely fail to
                     make himself felt, dreaded, and much observed.</p>
                  <p>In the first twelvemonth—that is, from his reelection in 1829, until the
                     meeting of the new Parliament in November 1830—O'Connell disappointed a great
                     many by playing what may be<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7173-00000191"/> called a
                     waiting game. It was expected that he would be perpetually speaking, upon all
                     occasions, and, in that case, attempts would have been made to laugh, or cough,
                     or clamor him down. He voted regularly, and always on the right side. In 1831,
                     when the Grey ministry were in power, O'Connell, now strengthened by a strong
                     and compact body of Irish members pledged to work with and under him (their
                     return was the result of the General Election), took the station in the
                     Legislature which he maintained for nearly fifteen years. During the prolonged
                     struggle for Parliamentary Reform, one of the most impressive speeches in
                     advocacy of the measure was O'Connell's. On all great occasions his voice was
                     heard and his vote given. It cannot be asserted that he invariably spoke and
                     voted as now, when we read the events of those days as history, it may
                     dispassionately be thought he should have done; but he was undoubtedly an
                     indefatigable, earnest, eloquent member of Parliament, through whose
                     pertinacity and tact many concessions were made to Ireland which were
                     calculated to serve her. The geniality of his nature was as unchecked in the
                     Senate as it had been at the Bar, or in the Catholic Association. He was
                     eminently a good-tempered man, and this availed him much in the House of
                     Commons, where, if it so please him, a man can readily make himself and others
                     uncomfortable by the exhibition of even a small portion of ill-temper.
                     Sometimes he laughed at his opponents, but so good-naturedly that they also
                     enjoyed the jest. Such was his cut at John Walter, proprietor of the
                        <title>Times,</title> who had remained on the ministerial benches after his
                     Tory friends had quitted them. He removed, speedily enough, when O'Connell
                     pointed to him as— <q>
                        <l>"The last rose of summer, left blooming alone."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So, when Lord Stanley (now Earl of Derby) separating from the Whigs, started a
                     party of his own, which was lamentably small, O'Connell quoted against him a
                     couplet from a familiar poet— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Thus down thy side, romantic Ashbourne, glides</l>
                           <l>The Derby dilly, carrying six insides."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> And so, pre-eminent over all was his parody on Dryden's celebrated
                     comparison. Three Colonels (Perceval, Verner, and Sibthorpe) represented Sligo,
                     Armagh, and Lincoln. The two first were smooth-faced and whiskerless as a
                     maiden. Sibthorpe is "bearded like a bard." O'Connell, alluding to them in the
                     House, thus hit them off, amid a general roar, in which the victimized trio
                     could not refrain from joining— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Three Colonels in three distant counties born,</l>
                           <l>Sligo, Armagh, and Lincoln did adorn.</l>
                           <l>The first in matchless impudence surpassed,</l>
                           <l>The next in bigotry—in both the last.</l>
                           <l>The force of nature could no further go,</l>
                           <l>To beard the third she shaved the other two."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7173-00000192"/>
                  <p>Like other politicians, O'Connell did not escape without occasional personal
                     passages at arms. In one of these, with Mr. Doherty, then Irish
                     Solicitor-General, in May, 1830, O'Connell may be said to have come off
                     second-best. He had attacked Doherty for his conduct as Crown lawyer in what
                     was called the Doneraile conspiracy. The whole of the Tory party sided with
                     Doherty, who made a forcible defence, attacking his assailant in turn, and the
                     Whigs did not very warmly support O'Connell, who had then only been a few
                     months in Parliament. This <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rencontre,</foreign> which
                     took place while "The Duke" was Premier, raised Doherty to the Chief
                     Justiceship of the Common Pleas in Ireland—and led to Peel's offering him a
                     seat in the Cabinet in 1834, and a Peerage in 1840. O'Connell used to say, and
                     with truth, that <emph>he</emph> had placed Doherty on the Bench.</p>
                  <p>On another occasion O'Connell was far more successful. This was the celebrated
                     Breach of Privilege case.</p>
                  <p>Victoria ascended the throne in June, 1837. Shortly after there was a General
                     Election, and a great many of the members returned were petitioned against. The
                     Tories had raised a large fund to defray the cost of these proceedings, and it
                     was called "The Spottiswoode Subscription," as Spottiswoode, the Queen's
                     printer (a patent life-office of much emolument), acted as its treasurer. Angry
                     debates arose in the House of Commons on this subject, and personalities were
                     so much and so tumultuously bandied to and fro, that Mr. Abercrombie, the
                     Speaker, threatened to resign if they were repeated,—as if, grasping Scotchman
                     as he was, he <emph>could</emph> ever have brought himself to resign the ¥6,000
                     a-year attached to the office!</p>
                  <p>The controverted elections were duly referred to the usual Election Committees,
                     ballotted for out of the members then in the House. These committees were duly
                     sworn, as juries are, to do justice between man and man. But it was unhappily
                     notorious that when the majority were Whigs, they almost invariably decided
                     against Tory members, and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vice versâ.</foreign> As ill
                     luck would have it, the majority of the decisions went to unseat Liberal
                     members. As parties were nearly balanced in Parliament, at that time—indeed the
                     Whigs remained in office merely because there was a new land inexperienced
                     sovereign who would have been puzzled how to act on a change of ministry—the
                     Liberals complained of the decisions of the Election Committees.</p>
                  <p>On February 23, 1838, Lord Maidstone, who had been elected for
                     Northamptonshire, and was the eldest son of the intolerant Earl of Winchelsea,
                     who fought a duel on the Catholic Relief Bill, with Wellington, in 1829, drew
                     the attention of the House of Commons to a Breach of Privilege. He complained
                     that, two days before, at a public dinner given at the Crown and Anchor Tavern,
                     Mr. O'Connell had declared<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7173-00000193"/> clared
                     that in the Election Committees "Corruption of the worst description existed,
                     and above all there was the perjury of the Tory politicians." Also, that he
                     "was ready to be a martyr to justice and truth; but not to false swearing, and
                     therefore, he repeated, that there was foul perjury in the Tory Committees of
                     the House of Commons."</p>
                  <p>What followed I saw, and can never forget. O'Connell, who had been reading (or
                     appearing to read) a newspaper while Lord Maidstone was accusing him, keenly
                     arose, sternly looked around the House, folded his arms, and, in his deepest
                     tones and most impressive manner, said, "Sir, I did say every word of
                     that—every word of that; and I do repeat that I believe it to be perfectly
                     true. Is there a man who will put his hand on his heart and say that it is not
                     true? Such a man would be laughed to scorn."</p>
                  <p>Maidstone then gave notice of a motion condemnatory of O'Connell, and the
                     discussion was adjourned until the following Monday. Maidstone moved that
                     O'Connell's speech was an imputation on the whole House, and that he be
                     censured for it as a breach of privilege. O'Connell replied in a speech of
                     great power, in the midst of which he was self-designated "The pensioned
                     servant of Ireland," and plainly declared that whenever an Election Committee
                     was appointed, it was known that the decision would be exactly according to the
                     political majority of its members; and repeating that he had spoken only the
                     truth, and would stand by his words. The Agitator then retired.</p>
                  <p>A great many members spoke,—the Whigs making a lukewarm defence for O'Connell,
                     instead of admitting and lamenting the truth of his remarks. The Tories
                     clamoured for a heavy censure. In a House of 517 members, out of 658, a
                     majority of <emph>nine</emph> were for the censure. Next Daniel Callaghan,
                     member for Cork city, Edmund Burke Roche, member for Cork county, W. D. Gillon
                     for Falkirk, and J. P. Somers for Sligo, severally and seriously declared that,
                     each and all, they adopted Mr. O'Connell's words and sentiments! It was then
                     carried by 298 to 85 (Lord John Russell voting in the majority) that the words
                     were "a false and scandalous imputation on the House."</p>
                  <p>Next, on the motion that O'Connell be reprimanded in his place, an exciting
                     debate ensued. Mr. Callaghan repeated his endorsement of O'Connell's
                     imputation, and his words were taken down by the Clerk of the House, on the
                     motion of Mr. Hume, who called on the Speaker to notice his contumacy. But the
                     Speaker was mute. Next day, Mr. Roche also repeated his full adherence to
                     O'Connell's charge. The vote of censure was carried by a majority of
                     twenty-nine.</p>
                  <p>O'Connell duly attended in his place, was gravely reprimanded by the Speaker
                     (his own particular<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7173-00000194"/> friend!), and
                     said, when the farce was over, "Galileo remarked 'the world does move, after
                     all.' And so, despite the censure of this House, I repeat all I said before.
                     The system I condemn reminds one of the Judge in Rabelais who decided cases by
                     throwing three dice for the plaintiff and two for the defendant. I had rather
                     take the dice-box and say 'seven's the main,' than take my chance on an
                     Election Committee of this House. I express no regret for what I have said. I
                     have retracted nothing. I will retract nothing. I have told the truth."</p>
                  <p>So saying, having bearded the House by strongly repeating his accusation, he
                     sat down. It was considered that he had gained a victory, and the conclusion of
                     all was a total change and reform in the system of Parliamentary election
                     committees.</p>
                  <p>But it was in Ireland—whether in the Catholic Association, at an Aggregate
                     Meeting, at a public dinner, or in a court of law—that O'Connell was to be seen
                     "in all his glory." In Ireland his influence was extraordinary—not only for its
                     vast extent, but for its continuance. No other public man, no matter what the
                     country or the age, has maintained his popularity, as O'Connell did, for nearly
                     forty years. I think that this may be partly attributed to the belief, long and
                     widely entertained by his followers, almost unbroken to the last, encouraged by
                     himself, and generally borne out by circumstances, that he was above the law,
                     that the law could not reach <emph>him,</emph> that he "could drive a coach and
                     six through any Act of Parliament."</p>
                  <p>In February, 1831, he was indicted and tried (with Tom Steels and Barrett, of
                        <title>The Pilot</title> newspaper) for holding political meetings which the
                     Viceroy's proclamation had forbidden. They pleaded guilty, but as the law under
                     which they were tried was allowed to expire before they were brought up for
                     judgment, his prophecy, that the law could not reach him, was fulfilled. In
                     1843 he was less fortunate. Three months in prison!—<emph>that</emph> destroyed
                     the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">prestige.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>This man was eminently endowed by nature with the bodily and mental
                     qualifications for a Tribune of the People. In stature he was lofty, in figure
                     large. His bold, good-natured face was an advantage—as were his manly
                     appearance and bearing. His voice was deep, musical, sonorous and manageable.
                     Its transitions from the higher to the lower notes was wondrously effective. No
                     man had a clearer or more distinct pronunciation—at times, it even went to the
                     extent of almost syllabizing long words. How lingeringly, as if he loved to
                     utter the words, would he speak of "Cawtholic E-man-cee-pa-tion!" He rather
                     affected a full Irish accent, on which was slightly grafted something of the
                     Foigardism which, in his youth, had attached itself to him when he studied in
                     France. No one who noticed his capacious chest could wonder that O'Connell was
                     able to<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7173-00000195"/> speak longer than most men
                     without pausing to take breath. When making a speech, his mouth was very
                     expressive; and this has been noticed as the characteristic of that feature, in
                     Irish faces. In his eyes (of a cold, clear blue) there was little speculation,
                     but the true Irish expression of feeling, passion and intellect played about
                     his lips. Looking at him, as he spoke, a close observer might almost note the
                     sentiment about to come from those lips, before the words had utterance—just as
                     we see the lightning-flash before we hear the thunder-peal.</p>
                  <p>His eloquence was eminently characteristic. Irishmen, in general, have "the
                     gift of the gab,"—that is, the power of expressing their sentiments in public
                     with ease to themselves and to their hearers. It gives them little trouble to
                     make a speech; and this faculty and this facility arise, very probably, from
                     the political circumstances of their country as much as from anything else. In
                     England there is no necessity why a man should have decided political opinions.
                     In Ireland no man dare be neutral. Persons may disagree, and do; but they unite
                     in despising and condemning the unhappy wight who does not belong to any party.
                     An Irishman, in Ireland, <emph>must</emph> be a partisan. Being so, there is no
                     earthly reason why, attending any public meeting, he should not be induced to
                     take part in the proceedings, and make a speech. Oratory is a very catching
                     thing,—listening begets the desire to be listened to, in turn; and, once that a
                     man has heard his own voice in public, depend on it he will be anxious to hear
                     it again.</p>
                  <p>Self-possession, which is "half the battle" in public life, is an essential in
                     public speaking. However, it is not <emph>the</emph> essential. There must be a
                     copious flow of words—a happy and rapid selection of language—an earnestness of
                     manner—a knowledge of human character—and, above all, a considerable degree of
                     information, with a certain portion of the "imagination all compact," which
                     breathes fervour and poetry into the spoken speech. Great is the orator's
                     power. He can touch the human heart—he can move the secret springs of action—he
                     can sway the popular will as he pleases—he can comfort the afflicted, infuse
                     hope into the oppressed, alarm the oppressor, and make ill-directed Power and
                     Might tremble on their lofty thrones.</p>
                  <p>Ireland has been particularly profuse in her contribution of eminent orators.
                     Burke, Canning, Plunket, Grattan, Sheil, Wellesley and Curran, stand
                     pre-eminent on the roll; but I doubt whether O'Connell, when the length of his
                     reign is considered, as well as the great extent of his influence, derived
                     chiefly from his power as a speaker, was not greater than any of these great
                     orators. He had less wit than Canning—less imagination than Curran—less
                     philosophy than Burke—less rhetoric than Sheil—less pure eloquence than
                     Plunket—less classical<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7173-00000196"/> sical
                     expression than Wellesley—less pathos than Grattan; but he had more power than
                     any of them. There was wonderful force in his language. And when addressing an
                     Irish audience, there was such an alternation of style—now rising to the
                     loftiest, and now subsiding to the most familiar—that he carried all hearts
                     with him, and those who listened seemed as if under the spell of an enchanter,
                     so completely did he move them as he pleased. Judging by their
                        <emph>effect,</emph> O'Connell's speeches must be considered as among the
                     best, if not the very best, of the time and country.</p>
                  <p>O'Connell's versatility as a speaker was wonderful. He was "all things to all
                     men." In a Court of Law he would often joke a jury into his view of the case,
                     and when this did not succeed, would convince them by subtle argument, bold
                     declamation, and a natural eloquence. At a political meeting, where he had to
                     address a multitude, they would alternately smile or get enraged, as he jested
                     with or excited their feelings. In Parliament, which he did not enter until he
                     was fifty-four years old, he generally was more calm, more careful, more
                     sudued, more solicitous in his choice of words, and more vigilant in
                     restraining the manner of delivering them.</p>
                  <p>The great secret of his power, as a speaker, was his earnestness. He ever had a
                     great object in view, and he always applied himself, with a strong and earnest
                     mind, to achieve that object. Whenever he pleased, he could rise to the
                     greatest height of eloquence; but he preferred, when speaking to the people, to
                     use language which each of them could understand. He varied his speeches, too,
                     with badinage and jokes, which, though merely humourous, made his audience
                     smile, and keep them in good temper with each other, with themselves, and with
                     him. The Irish, who thronged to listen to him, went to be amused as well as to
                     be harangued. Nor did he disappoint them. I may illustrate what I mean by
                     giving an example of one of his familiar illustrations.</p>
                  <p>In 1827, during the time of what was called "The New Reformation," in Ireland,
                     O'Connell made a speech at the South Chapel, in Cork. It contained the
                     following passage, after a very elaborate denial of the assumed conversions
                     which the "New Reformation" gentry had boasted of:—"They remind me, gentlemen,
                     of a Frenchman who waited on Lord Kenmare, and offered to drain the lakes of
                     Killarney, which would restore a great quantity of arable land. Lord Kenmare
                     happened to think that he had land enough, and civilly declined having his
                     property deprived of the beautiful lakes, its proudest ornament. The Frenchman,
                     however, being one of those who <q>
                        <l>'Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame,'</l>
                     </q> persisted in his fancy, and accordingly rose at break of day to drain the
                     lake. And, boys, how do you<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7173-00000197"/> think he
                     was doing it? Why, he was baling it out with his hat! (Great laughter.) Now,
                     there are seven millions of Catholics in Ireland—the New Reformation folk do
                     not boast of more than six or seven conversions, or perversions, in the week—so
                     that, allowing (which is impossible, where there are bright eyes and warm
                     hearts such as flash and throb around me, in this large assembly) that the
                     Catholics of Ireland will not increase in the meantime, there must, at this
                     rate, be a million of weeks elapse before all of them are drained out by
                     conversion. (Cheers.) Boys, these Reformation gentry remind me mightily of the
                     Frenchman baling out the Lake of Killarney with his hat!"</p>
                  <p>It was with pleasant, homely jokes like this—yet each having a tendency to work
                     out the argument—that O'Connell was wont to amuse the Irish. In point of wit, I
                     doubt whether O'Connell's little Frenchman be not as original a character as
                     Sydney Smith's farfamed Mrs. Partington.</p>
                  <p>O'Connell's friends lamented, and with ample cause, at his aptness to abuse the
                     license of public speech. He was very fond of bestowing nicknames on his
                     opponents, and of applying offensive epithets to them.<ref rend="super"
                        target="#note_020" xml:id="return_020">*</ref> As early as July, 1808, at a
                     meeting of the famous Catholic Board, he had commenced that sort of
                     speaking—which lowers him who adopts it rather than those against whom it is
                     levelled. He then said "the present administration are the personal enemies of
                     the Catholic cause; yet if the Catholics continue loyal, firm, and undivided,
                     they have little to fear from the barren petulence of the ex-advocate,
                     Percival, or the frothy declamations of the poetaster, Canning—they might with
                     equal contempt despise the upstart pride of the Jenkinsons, and with more than
                     contempt the pompous inanity of that Lord Castlereagh, who might well be
                     permitted to hate the country that gave him birth, to her own annihilation." In
                     the same vulgar spirit he spoke of Cobbett as "a comical miscreant," and
                     declared that the Duke of Wellington was "a stunted corporal," and maintained
                     that Disraeli, whose Jewish descent is well known, must be a lineal descendant
                     of the impenitent thief who was crucified, when the great sacrifice of
                     Salvation was consummated at Calvary.</p>

                     <p><ref target="#return_020">*</ref>O'Connell had high judicial authority for
                        the use of bad language. Sir Archibald Macdonald (who was Chief Baron of the

                        Norton, afterwards Speaker of the House of Commons, that he was a "lazy,

                  <p>Once only, as far as my memory serves, O'Connell gave a nickname, with point
                     and wit in the application. He was denouncing the present Earl of Derby, who
                     was then a member of the House of Commons, and filled the office of Chief
                     Secretary of Ireland. In some way Stanley had taken official<pb n="394-395"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000198"/> notice of the "sayings and doings" of O'Connell,
                     whereupon the Agitator declared that, from that time, he must be called
                     "Shave-beggar Stanley." Amid roars of laughter (for this was at a public
                     meeting in Dublin), O'Connell proceeded to justify the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >nom de guerre.</foreign> It was the custom, he said, that barbers'
                     apprentices should learn their business by shaving beggars, who, as the job was
                     done for nothing, could scarcely complain if a blunt razor gave them pain, or
                     an unskilful hand cut the skin, as well as the beard. So, he added, with
                     British statesmen. They were first sent over to Ireland, to get their hand in,
                     and when that was accomplished they were considered to have sufficient
                     dexterity to be placed in office in England. He argued, by analogy, that the
                     political, like the actual "shave-beggar," gave a good deal of pain, and
                     inflicted many cuts, which the Irish, like the pauper shave-lings, were
                     compelled to submit to, without complaint. From that day until the day he left
                     Ireland, Lord Stanley was always spoken of, by the Irish Liberals, with the
                     prefix of "shave-beggar" to his surname!</p>
                  <p>Two things, through life, O'Connell strenuously affirmed and inculcated. First,
                     that the man who committed outrage supplied the enemy with a weapon to be used
                     against the country. Second, that Ireland would never be prosperous until the
                     Union was repealed.</p>
                  <p>He did not join the United Irishmen in 1798,—not because he, like them, had not
                     an aspiration for the political independence of his country, but because he
                     disapproved of <emph>their</emph> mode of striving for it, by force. From first
                     to last he was opposed to violence. The "Young Ireland" schism, at Conciliation
                     Hall, which so much annoyed him, during the last eighteen months of his career,
                     was caused by his resistance to the doctrine of "physical force."</p>
                  <p>As to the Union—it is only just to say, that O'Connell's first public effort
                     was against that measure. His maiden speech, delivered on January 13th, 1800,
                     at a Catholic meeting, in Dublin, unequivocally condemned the Union. The
                     Resolutions adopted by the meeting, drawn up by O'Connell, declared the
                     proposed incorporate Union to be, "in fact, an extinction of the liberty of
                     Ireland, which would be reduced to the abject condition of a province,
                     surrendered to the mercy of the Minister and Legislature of another country, to
                     be bound by their absolute will, and taxed at their pleasure by laws, in the
                     making of which Ireland would have no efficient participation whatever!" During
                     the struggle for Emancipation, as well as from that era until his death,
                     O'Connell always declared that he would not be satisfied with less than "the
                     Repeal." He never cushioned, never concealed that such was his object. I
                     mention this, because it has been said that, "having got Emancipation, he ought
                     not to have gone for Repeal." As a matter of <emph>policy,</emph> perhaps,
                     Ireland would now be better off if the Repeal agitation had<pb n="396-397"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000199"/> not taken place; but it is indisputable that
                     from 1800 to 1846, O'Connell declared that he would not be satisfied with less
                     than "the Repeal."</p>
                  <p>Here it may be well to notice the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">questio
                        vexata</foreign> of the famous "O'Connell Rent." The amount has not been
                     exactly ascertained, but it is believed to have varied from
                        10,000<abbr>l.</abbr> to 20,000<abbr>l.</abbr> a year. It commenced after
                     Emancipation was granted, and was continued until 1846, when, from the pressing
                     wants of the Irish, it was announced that Mr. O'Connell wished it to be
                     discontinued until they could better afford to pay it. Here it may be best to
                     give Mr. O'Connell's own apology, in a letter to Lord Shrewsbury, in 1842. He
                     said, "I will not consent that my claim to 'the Rent' should be misunderstood.
                     That claim may be rejected, but it is understood in Ireland. My claim is
                     this:—For more than twenty years before Emancipation, the burthen of the cause
                     was thrown upon me. I had to arrange the meetings—to prepare the resolutions—to
                     furnish replies to the correspondence—to examine the case of each person
                     complaining of practical grievances—to rouse the torpid—to animate the
                     lukewarm—to control the violent and inflammatory—to avoid the shoals and
                     breakers of the law—to guard against multiplied treachery—and at all times to
                     oppose, at every peril, the powerful and multitudinous enemies of the cause. To
                     descend to particulars: At a period when my minutes counted by the guinea—when
                     my emoluments ments were limited only by the extent of my physical and waking
                     powers—when my meals were shortened to the narrowest space, and my sleep
                     restricted to the earliest hours before dawn; at that period, and for more than
                     twenty years, there was no day that I did not devote from one to two hours
                     (often more) to the working out of the Catholic cause; and <emph>that</emph>
                     without receiving, or allowing the offer of any remuneration, even for the
                     personal expenditure incurred in the agitation of the cause itself. For years I
                     bore the entire expenses of a Catholic agitation, without receiving the
                     contributions of others to a greater amount than seventy-four pounds in the
                     whole. Who shall repay me for the years of my buoyant youth and cheerful
                     manhood? Who shall repay me for the lost opportunities of acquiring
                     professional celebrity; or for the wealth which such distinction would
                     ensure?"</p>
                  <p>There is considerable force in this. But O'Connell's character, out of Ireland,
                     would have stood higher, had he not received "the Rent." It was often alleged,
                     by his adherents, as a set-off, that Grattan had also been remunerated by his
                     countrymen. But the cases were not parallel. In 1782, Grattan, almost
                     single-handed, had achieved the Independence of Ireland, by obtaining the
                     recognition of the principle that "the Crown of England is an Imperial Crown,
                     but that Ireland is a distinct Kingdom, with a Parliament of her own, the
                        sole<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7173-00000200"/> Legislature thereof." He had
                     accomplished a bloodless Revolution. He had thrown himself into political life,
                     abandoning the profession on which rested nearly his whole worldly dependence.
                     A grant of ¥100,000 was proposed to him in the Irish Parliament, "to purchase
                     an estate, and build a suitable mansion, as the reward of gratitude by the
                     Irish nation, for his eminent services to his country." It was intended as a
                     mark of national gratitude to a nation's Liberator. So unanimous was the
                     feeling that, on the part of the Viceroy, a member of the Government offered
                     "as part of the intended grant to Mr. Grattan, the Viceregal Palace in the
                     Phœnix Park [Dublin], to be settled on Mr. Grattan and his heirs for ever, as a
                     suitable residence for so meritorious a person." Grattan's own impulse was to
                     refuse the grant. His services had been rendered without expectation or desire
                     of reward. But his private fortune was so inadequate to his public position
                     that he must retire from politics or become a placeman under the Crown. The
                     grant would give him an independent position. He consented to accept half of
                     the proffered amount (¥50,000), and determined under no circumstances to take
                     office. He was, ever after, the retained servant of the nation. Yet, high as he
                     stood, he did not escape contumely. Even Henry Flood, his rival, publicly said,
                     in a Parliamentary controversy, "I am not a mendicant patriot, who was bought
                     by my country for a sum of money, and then sold my country to the Minister for
                     prompt payment."</p>
                  <p>O'Connell's "Rent" was estimated as yielding from ¥10,000 to ¥20,000 a
                     year—thrice the amount, probably, that he could have realized at the bar, had
                     he not devoted his time to politics. It was duly paid for nearly twenty years.
                     Thus O'Connell received, in this annuity from his party, about five times as
                     much as the Irish Parliament had given to Grattan. Besides, since 1825, when
                     Derrynane became his by the death of his uncle, O'Connell's landed property was
                     not less than ¥4,000 a year. The most potent objection to "the Rent" was that,
                     collected year after year, it rendered its recipient liable to the imputation
                     of keeping up Agitation in order to collect the Rent.</p>
                  <p>When O'Connell's uncle died, in 1825, at a very advanced age, (he was several
                     years past ninety,) the news reached O'Connell when he was on circuit, at
                     Limerick. He hastened to Kerry, to attend the funeral, and did not again appear
                     in court until the trials were proceeding in Cork. I had taken my seat, as a
                     reporter, on the very day he made his appearance, attired in full mourning.
                     Setting immediately under him, I heard one of the counsel congratulate him on
                     his accession to his uncle's large estate. "I had to wait for it a long time,"
                     said O'Connell. "If this had happened twenty years ago, what would I now have
                     been? A hard-living, sporting, country<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7173-00000201"
                     /> gentleman, content with my lot. As it is, I have had to struggle. I have
                     succeeded; and look how bright are now the prospects of Ireland! I thank God
                     that I had to struggle, since it has placed them as they are now."</p>
                  <p>To sum up the character of O'Connell's <emph>political,</emph> essentially
                     different from his <emph>forensic,</emph> eloquence, I need not say more than
                     that he put strong words into fitting places. No man had a greater or more
                     felicitous command of language; no man cared less how his words were
                     marshalled. Many of his speeches are models of the truest eloquence, and
                     perhaps he was the first Irishman, of modern days, who made a decided hit in
                     the Commons, as a sound and eloquent speaker, entering that House at the mature
                     age of fifty. Powers such as his commanded attention;—but, in general, he spoke
                     better in Ireland, among his own people, than in England. Yet who can forget
                     his magnificent oration in favour of the Reform Bill? Who can forget the later,
                     and briefer, but not less stirring speech, which he delivered, as a member of
                     the Anti-Corn-law League, on his first visit to London, after the reversal of
                     the Monster-Meetings' sentence of imprisonment.</p>
                  <p>In sarcasm O'Connell was unequalled. I shall give an instance of quiet sarcasm
                     which I think inimitable. In his domestic relations O'Connell was peculiarly
                     happy. His marriage with his cousin Mary, was one of pure affection on both
                     sides, and their love continued to the last, as warm as it had commenced in
                     their youthful days.<ref rend="super" target="#note_021" xml:id="return_021"

                     dead, said, with as much beauty as truth, "We can say no more than that
                     doubting, she confirmed him—desponding, she cheered him on—drooping, she
                     sustained him—her pure spirit may have often trembled, indeed, as she beheld
                     him exposed to a thousand assaults, and affronting a thousand dangers; but she
                     quailed not, she called him not back. She rejoiced not more in his victories
                     over them, than she would have heartily and devotedly shared <note place="foot"

                        <p><ref target="#return_021">*</ref>In 1802, O'Connell married his cousin,
                           the daughter of Dr. O'Connell, of Tralee. By this lady he had four sons
                           and three daughters. Two of the sons are now [1855] in Parliament.
                           Maurice, the eldest, was a barrister, but never distinguished himself
                           either as a lawyer or a politician. Morgan was for some time in the
                           Austrian service, and distinguished himself as a gallant officer. His
                           "affair of honour" with Lord Alvanley showed cool determination and
                           honourable feeling. Mr. John O'Connell, who tried to take his father's
                           place in Conciliation Hall, as Repeal Leader, has displayed little of the
                           talent and tact which distinguished the Liberator. The youngest son,
                           Daniel, is a very commonplace person. It is usually said, that the
                           children of a great man rarely arrive at eminence, and the limited
                           talents of O'Connell's sons keep up the proverb in full force, as far as
                           he and they are concerned: <q>

                     sufferings, in the ruin, that might have come upon him had he failed and been
                     overthrown." On the other hand, the Marquis of Anglesey, in 1831, as Viceroy of
                     Ireland, had O'Connell prosecuted for an imputed breach of the law. The Marquis
                     had seduced the first wife of the late Lord Cowley, and married her after he
                     was divorced from his wife, and Lady Cowley (then Mrs. Henry Wellesley) from
                     her husband. O'Connell, commenting, at a public meeting in Dublin, on Lord
                     Anglesey's conduct to him said, "This prosecution has cost my wife what none of
                        <emph>my</emph> transactions ever cost her—a tear for me. Does Lord Anglesey
                     know the value of a <emph>virtuous</emph> woman's tear?"</p>
                  <p>O'Connell's attempts at authorship were not very successful. His letters to the
                     "Hereditary bondsmen" were diffuse and declamatory. They were full of
                     repetitions, putting the points of a case in a variety of phases, but they were
                     by no means equal to the force, power, and nervous eloquence of his speeches.
                     He was eminently an extemporaneous speaker, and, like Fox, appeared to more
                     advantage as an orator than a writer. Yet many of his letters contain true
                     eloquence. He hit hard, and could be terse when he pleased. Who can forget the
                     alliterative satire of the three words "base, bloody, and brutal," as applied
                     to the Whigs?</p>
                  <p>His only substantive and independent work was Vol. I. of "A Memoir on Ireland,
                     Native and Saxon," published early in 1843. This book was dedicated to the
                     Queen, in order, as the Preface stated, "that the Sovereign of these realms
                     should understand the real nature of Irish history; should be aware of how much
                     the Irish have suffered from English misrule; should comprehend the secret
                     springs of Irish discontent; should be acquainted with the eminent virtues
                     which the Irish have exhibited in every phasis of their singular fate; and,
                     above all, should be intimately acquainted with the confiscations, the plunder,
                     the robbery, the domestic treachery, the violation of all public faith, and of
                     the servility of treaties, the ordinary wholesale slaughters, the planned
                     murders, the concerted massacres, which have been inflicted upon the Irish
                     people by the English Government." This one sentence will sufficiently indicate
                     the character of the work. O'Connell further stated, in his preface, that
                     "there cannot happen a more heavy misfortune to Ireland than the prosperity and
                     power of Great Britain." He endeavoured to justify this assertion, by adding
                     that "justice to Ireland" had never been granted except when Great Britain was
                     in difficulties. The work brought the "proofs and illustrations" of British
                     misrule in Ireland down to the Restoration. A second volume was to have carried
                     them down to the present period, but it never was published. Nor has Literature
                     nor History sustained<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7173-00000203"/> tained any
                     loss,—unless it was much superior to the first volume. The seven opening
                     chapters, rapidly sketching the history of English dominion in Ireland from
                     1172 to 1840, are not devoid of a certain degree of eloquence, but is
                     anti-English to a degree. The historical "proofs and illustrations," are simply
                     statements from partisan writers, with connecting comments by O'Connell.</p>
                  <p>It was as a lawyer that O'Connell achieved his first distinctions. His success
                     at the bar was assurance to his countrymen of his general ability. But, of late
                     years, Mr. O'Connell was so exclusively before the public as a legislator, that
                     he was forgotten as a barrister. Yet, in the opinion of many, (among whom are
                     those who have known him long and well,) it was in the latter character that
                     the peculiar idiosyncrasy of the man was fully developed—that his very rare and
                     peculiar talents were fully displayed.</p>
                  <p>Many men have obtained eminence at the Irish bar, but it has been for some one
                     peculiar merit. Thus, Harry Deane Grady was remarkable for the knowing manner
                     in which he conducted a cross-examination. By that he alternately wheedled and
                     frightened a witness into admissions which were as opposite to his evidence in
                     chief as light is from darkness. Thus, Chief Justice Bushe, while at the bar,
                     was distinguished for that classic eloquence by which admiring juries were
                     seduced, and admiring judges were delighted. Pity that his elevation to the
                     bench should have extinguished this noble oratory. Thus, Curran was renowned
                     for "that sarcastic levity of tongue" which solicited a contest with those
                     elevated in rank above himself. Thus, Shiel was remarkable for introducing a
                     style of speaking—full of antithetical brilliancies—which reminds us of the
                     flashing speeches of the most distinguished advocates of France. Thus, Serjeant
                     (now Judge) Perrin was almost unrivalled in threading through the intricacies
                     of an excise case. Thus, George Bennett won fame by his clear and plausible
                     method of stating a case. Thus, Devonshire Jackson (now a Judge) was excellent
                     in taking exceptions to the form of an indictment. Thus, the late Recorder
                     Waggett (of Cork) put that seeming of right into a case, by which trusting
                     jurymen are so often deceived. But there was only one man at the Irish bar who,
                     more or less, united the excellencies of all whom I have named. He was as good
                     at cross-examination as Harry Grady—he could rise with the occasion, and be
                     eloquent as Bushe—he could sport the biting sarcasm of Curran—he even ventured
                     on the antitheses of Shiel (though he seldom meddled with such sharp-edged
                     weapons)—he was a match for Perrin in the excise courts—he could state a case
                     plainly and plausibly as Bennett—he was as good a lawyer as Jackson, and could
                     appeal to "the reports" with as much success—and, like Waggett (against whom,
                     in the Munster Courts,<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7173-00000204"/> he was often
                     pitted), he could show his case to be one of the utmost <emph>seeming</emph>
                     right, his client, like the late Queen, of virtuous memory, to be clear as
                     "un-sunned snow." The man who combined all these apparently dissimilar
                     qualifications—the man whom universal consent named as the best general lawyer
                     in Ireland—the man to whom Orange clients invariably ran with their briefs (a
                     confidence equally honourable to clients and lawyer), was O'Connell.</p>
                  <p>By far the best account of O'Connell, in his different phases as a lawyer, is
                     that in the "Sketches of the Irish Bar." Its essence is contained in the little
                     sentence—"Every requisite for a barrister of all work is combined in him; some
                     in perfection, all in sufficiency."</p>
                  <p>An anonymous writer in an English paper has given this reminiscence of
                     O'Connell: "I recollect at the spring assizes of I think it was '27, walking
                     into the county court-house of Limerick. O'Connell was retained in a record
                     then being heard, and with him on the same side was his son Maurice, who was
                     bred to his father's profession, though he has since ceased to follow it. It
                     was a cold day, and both wore huge cloth cloaks: the Agitator's right arm was
                     thrown very affectionately round his son's neck, who, seemingly used to these
                     public exhibitions of paternal fondness, took it very composedly. There was a
                     rough-and-ready looking peasant at the moment under examination: in lieu of the
                     ordinary box used in most English courts, he was seated in a chair in the
                     centre of the table between the fires of the counsel on either side; his shaggy
                     hair and unshorn beard, his shirt collar open, the knees of his small clothes
                     in the same free and easy state, and one stocking fallen so as to leave a
                     portion of his embrowned and hirsute leg bare; he had the chair partially
                     turned round, so as to present a three-quarter front to O'Connell, who was
                        <emph>raking</emph> him with a cross-examination, which elicited laughter
                     from every person in the court, including the witness himself, who, with his
                     native freedom, impudence, and humour, was almost a match for the Agitator. The
                     Agitator's face was beaming with fun, and he seemed very well disposed to show
                     off, as if conscious that his auditors expected something from him. The country
                     fellow, too, appeared to think there were laurels to be earned in the
                     encounter, for he played away with all his might, and though he failed
                     repeatedly in his attempts to be witty, he was always sure to be impudent. He
                     waxed gradually more familiar, until at length he called the learned counsel
                     nothing but 'Dan;' it was, 'Yes, Dan,' or 'No, Dan,' or 'Arrah, you're not
                     going to come over me so easily, Dan.' Dan, to do him justice, enjoyed the
                     joke, and humoured the witness in such a manner as at length to throw the
                     fellow off his guard, and lead him into a maze of contradictions
                     notwithstanding his shrewdness<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7173-00000205"/> ness.
                     O'Connell showed the utmost adroitness, and a thorough knowledge of the Irish
                     peasant character, which is perhaps in no place so well acquired as in a
                     provincial court. I cannot this moment recollect any single repartee which is
                     worth repeating, but it was the manner, the brogue, the laughing eye, the
                     general and humourous tone of the whole examination, and perhaps the very
                     spectacle of O'Connell himself trying legally to entrap and upset the veracity
                     of one of his own "fine peasantry," which gave that peculiar interest and
                     pleasantry to the scene. Nothing could surpass the seeming enjoyment which the
                     country people took in the examination; and as the Agitator would throw off now
                     and again one of his broad flashes of humour in the "keen encounter of their
                     wits," and the witness would fire back some jocular effort at equivocation,
                     you'd hear buzzed around, 'Bravo, Dan,' 'Dan's the boy,' or some such phrase of
                     approbation, which it was out of the question to suppress. Blackburn, <ref

                     the Attorney-General, was on the bench, having taken the circuit for some judge
                     who was unwell; and though a dark and stern man, he was compelled to give way
                     to the general fit of pleasantry in which the whole court indulged."</p>

                  </note>
                  <p>O'Connell's business, on circuit as well as in the Four Courts of Dublin, was
                     very great. On circuit, it was so overpowering that, except on very important
                     cases, he could not read his briefs, when employed to defend prisoners. The
                     attorney for the defence used to condense the leading facts, and set them down
                     on a single sheet of foolscap; and O'Connell would peruse and master this
                     abstract during the speech of the counsel for the prosecution, relying on his
                     own skill in cross-examination of witnesses, and his own power with the jury.
                     Like Belial, he "could make the worse appear the better reason," as many an
                     acquitted culprit had cause to know and thank him for.</p>
                  <p>Let me close this sketch with a glance of O'Connell, as I have often seen him,
                     in an Irish Court of Law. <emph>There</emph> he was to be met "in all his
                     glory." As I write, the shadows of long years roll away, and every thing
                     appears as vivid and life-like as it was at that time.</p>
                  <p>To have seen O'Connell in the Law Courts of Dublin, was to have seen him not
                     exactly as himself. Before the judges, and in the capital of the kingdom, a
                     certain <foreign xml:lang="FRA">etiquette</foreign> is preserved, very decorous
                     and proper, no doubt, but very chilling also. It is on circuit that you best
                     can see the Irish bar, as they really are, and it is on circuit, also, that an
                     observer may advantageously study the character of the Irish people. Leave the
                     chilling atmosphere of the Four Courts, give the reins to imagination, and<pb
                        n="410-411" xml:id="VAC7173-00000206"/> sit, with me, in the Crown Courts of
                     Cork, as I have sat in bygone years. To give something like reality to my
                     sketch, I shall write as if I still were in the year 1827, when O'Connell and
                     the rest whom I have to name were alive and flourishing.</p>
                  <p>What a difference between this court and that of a circuit court in England!
                     Look around you:—there stands not a single female in the Irish court. To attend
                     there, with the chance of having it ever hinted that delicacy requires their
                     absence, would ill suit the modest precision of the fair dames of Ireland. Nor
                     do I think that the course of justice suffers from the absence of the fair sex.
                     What business have ladies in a court of justice? Do they want information as to
                     the trials?—they can see them reported in "those best possible instructors,"
                     the newspapers. Do they want to see the manner in which justice is
                     administered?—if they <emph>will</emph> be so curious, and if that curiosity
                     must be gratified, let them come once and no more. As it is, the English courts
                     have female stagers, who attend day after day, and listen to arguments which
                     they cannot comprehend. I suspect that their chief design is to show off; they
                     come to see, but they also come "to be seen." The only preventive would be to
                     enforce their attendance; when, if they be true women, the spirit of opposition
                     will make them remain at home!</p>
                  <p>Whatever be the cause, there is a non-attendance of females at the Irish courts
                     of law. The galleries are filled with rough-coated and rough-faced folks; some,
                     who have not visited the city since the last assizes—some, who have relatives
                     to be tried—some, out on bail, and honourably come to take their own trial—all,
                     even to the mere looker-on, deeply interested in the proceedings; for the
                     Irish, from the highest to the lowest degree, are fond of the
                        <emph>forms</emph> of justice. Of the <emph>reality</emph> they have
                     hitherto got but little; but they like to see that little administered with the
                     due formalities of the law.</p>
                  <p>The judge enters the court, and takes his seat on the bench. You ask, with
                     astonishment, "When will the barristers come?" Why, <emph>there,</emph> do you
                     not see his lordship rise, and make an obeisance to the gentlemen who sit in
                     the box above us? These are the barristers. You may seem as unbelieving as you
                     choose, but such is the case. The fact is, and I should have mentioned it
                     before, when Irish barristers go on the circuit<ref rend="super"
                        target="#note_023" xml:id="return_023">*</ref> they do not burthen
                     themselves with wigs or gowns—forensic paraphernalia, to which their legal
                     brethren on the English side of the Channel attach such infinite importance,
                     that you might fancy they thought all wit and wisdom<ref rend="super"

                     and the audience sit or stand where and how they can.</p>
                  <p>There is a pause—for a great murder trial is to come on—O'Connell has just been
                     engaged for the defence—is occupied in the other court, and the judge must wait
                     until he can make his appearance. During this pause you see a familiarity
                     between the bench and the bar which seems strange to your English eyes. Yet,
                     after all, what is it? Will the laws be a whit less honestly administered or
                     advocated because the judge and one of the lawyers (Chief Baron O'Grady and
                     Recorder Waggett) are laughing together? Depend on it, that, if the opportunity
                     comes, the judge will fling out one of his bitter sarcasms against the
                     barrister, and I know little of the barrister if he does not retort—if he
                     can!</p>
                  <p>A bustle in the court. Does O'Connell come? No; but a message from him, with
                     the intimation that the trial may go on, and he will "drop in" in half an hour.
                     The clerk of the peace reads the indictment—the murderer pleads "Not Guilty,"
                     stands in the dock with compressed lips, and bursting veins, and withering
                     frown, and scowling eyes—a fit subject for the savage pencil of
                     Spagnaletto.</p>
                  <p>While the indictment is reading, a very dandified "middle-aged young
                     gentleman," attired in a blue coat, with enormous brass buttons, a crimson silk
                     neckcloth, and a most glaring pair of buckskins, jumps on the table, makes way
                     across it with a "hop, step and jump," and locates himself in a box directly
                     under the judge. You inquire, who is that neophyte?—the answer is, Carew
                     Standish O'Grady, the registrar<ref rend="super" target="#note_025"
                        xml:id="return_025">*</ref> of the circuit, barrister-at-law, and nephew to
                     the judge. You turn up your eyes in wonder—the prothonotary of an English court
                     would scarcely sport such a fox-hunter's garb.</p>

                     scarcely audible even to the reporters below him. But his serjeantcy gives him
                     that precedence at the bar, on account of which the chief conduct of Crown
                     prosecutions devolves to him. Meanwhile the Chief Baron turns to the High
                     Sheriff, and cracks jokes; his hopeful nephew, less ambitious, produces a bag
                     and some salt, and merely—cracks nuts.</p>

                     his thumb instead of the book. There is a dead silence in the court; for it is
                     felt that the moment is awful with the fate of a fellow-creature.<pb
                        n="414-415" xml:id="VAC7173-00000208"/> Hark! a shout outside,—O'Connell
                     comes. He has just been successful <emph>for</emph> an Orangeman
                        <emph>against</emph> a Catholic; but what does that matter? The people do
                     justice to his merit; so <emph>he</emph> succeeds, what care they against
                     whom?</p>
                  <p>Another pause—a buzz in the court—"quite a sensation," as a dandy might
                     exquisitely exclaim—the prisoner's eyes brightens up with the gleam of hope—he
                     sees O'Connell, at last, seated among the barristers. What! is that O'Connell?
                     that stalwart, smiling, honest-looking man? The same. Never did a public man
                     assume less pretension to personal appearance. Yet, if you look closely, you
                     may observe that he does anything but neglect the graces. His clothes are
                     remarkably well made, the tie of his cravat is elaborate, his handsome
                     eye-glass is so disposed that it can be seen as well as used, and his "Brutus"
                     (for 't would be heinous to utter the word "wig") gives an air of juvenility
                     which his hilarious manners fully confirm.</p>
                  <p>Until this moment of his entering the court, he knows nothing of the case—he
                     has not yet received a brief. Mr. Daltera (you will remember that the scene is
                     in Cork—the time 1827), the lame attorney, hands him a bulky brief, (which he
                     puts, unread, into the bag,) and an abstract of the case, written on one sheet
                     of paper. His blue eyes calmly glance over this case—he takes in, at that
                     glance, all its bearings, and he quietly listens to the evidence of the
                     accomplice. The cross-examination commences. Every eye is watchful—every ear on
                     the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">qui vive</foreign>—every man in court stretches
                     forward to see the battle between "the Counsellor" and "the witness." You may
                     see the prisoner with an eager glance of expectation—the witness with an
                     evident sense of the coming crisis. The battle commences with anything but
                     seriousness; O'Connell surprises the witness by his good humour, and instantly
                     sets him at ease. He coaxes out of him a full confession of his own
                     unworthiness,—he tempts him, by a series of facetious questions, into an
                     admission of his "whole course of life,"—in a word, he draws from his lips an
                     autobiography, in which the direst crimes are mingled with an occasional relief
                     of feeling or of fun. The witness seems to exult in the "bad eminence" on which
                     his admissions exalt him. He joins in the laugh at the quaintness of his
                     language,—he scarcely shrinks from the universal shudders at the enormity of
                     his crimes. By degrees he is led to the subject of the evidence he has just
                     given, as an accomplice,—the coil is wound round him imperceptibly; fact after
                     fact is weakened, until, finally, such doubt is thrown upon <emph>all</emph>
                     that he has said,—from the evident exaggeration of <emph>part,</emph>—that a
                     less ingenious advocate than O'Connell might rescue the prisoner from
                     conviction on <emph>such</emph> evidence. The main witness having "broken
                     down," (as much from the natural doubt and disgust excited in the minds of<pb
                        n="416-417" xml:id="VAC7173-00000209"/> an Irish jury, by the circumstance
                     of a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">particeps criminis</foreign> being evidence
                     against one who may have been more sinned against than sinning,—who may have
                     been seduced into the paths of error by the very man who now bears testimony
                     against him,) the result of the trial is not very difficult to be foreseen. If
                     there is any doubt, the matter is soon made clear by a few <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">alibi</foreign> witnesses—practiced rogues with the most
                     innocent aspects, who swear anything or every thing to "get a friend out of
                     trouble." The chances are ten to one that O'Connell brings off the prisoner. If
                     he is not acquitted, he may, at least, be only found guilty on the minor plea
                     of "manslaughter."</p>
                  <p>But the chances are that he will be acquitted, for few juries ever resisted the
                     influence of O'Connell's persuasive eloquence.</p>
                  <p>Such is the scene exhibited by one glance backward:—such, five-and-twenty years
                     ago, was constantly occurring in the Irish courts of law when O'Connell
                     practiced at the bar.</p>
                  <p>Even at the risk of being accounted tedious, I cannot conclude this sketch
                     without mentioning another anecdote, which, even better than a lengthened
                     disquisition, may show that I do not overrate the extraordinary ingenuity and
                     quickness for which I give O'Connell such ample credit. One of the most
                     remarkable personages in Cork, for a series of years, was a sharp-witted little
                     fellow named John Boyle,<ref rend="super" target="#note_026"
                        xml:id="return_026">*</ref> who published a periodical called <title>The
                        Free-holder.</title> As Boyle did not see that any peculiar dignity hedged
                     the corrupt Corporation of Cork, his <title>Freeholder</title> was remarkable
                     for severe and satirical remarks upon its members, collectively and personally.
                     Owing to the very great precautions as to the mode of publication, it was next
                     to impossible for the Corporation to proceed against him for libel;—if they
                     could have done so, his punishment was certain, for in those days there were
                     none but "Corporation juries," and the fact that Boyle was hostile to the
                     municipal <foreign xml:lang="FRA">clique,</foreign> was quite enough for these
                     worthy administrators of justice. It happened, on the occasion of a crowded
                     benefit at the theatre, that Boyle and one of the Sheriffs were coming out of
                     the pit at the same moment. A sudden crush drove the scribe against the
                     Sheriff, and the concussion was so great that the latter had two of his ribs
                     broken. There could be no doubt that the whole was accidental; but it was too
                     lucky not to be taken advantage of. Mr. Boyle was prosecuted for assault
                     O'Connell was retained for the defence. The trial came on before a Corporation
                     jury. The evidence was extremely slight; but it was an understood thing that on
                        <emph>any</emph> evidence, or <emph>no</emph> evidence, the jury would
                     convict Boyle. Mr. O'Connell (who was personally inimical to the Corporation)
                     scarcely cross-examined a witness and called none in defence.</p>

                  <p>He proceeded to reply. After some hyperbolical compliments on the "well-known
                     impartiality, independence, and justice of a Cork jury," he proceeded to
                     address them thus:—"I had no notion that the case is what it is; therefore I
                     call no witnesses. As I have received a brief, and its accompaniment—a fee—I
                     must address you. I am not in the vein for making a speech, so, gentlemen, I
                     shall tell you a story. Some years ago I went, specially, to Clonmel assizes,
                     and accidentally witnessed a trial which I never shall forget. A wretched man,
                     a native of the county of Tipperary, was charged with the murder of his
                     neighbour. It seemed that an ancient feud existed between them. They had met at
                     a fair and exchanged blows: again, that evening, they met at a low pot-house,
                     and the bodily interference of friends alone prevented a fight between them.
                     The prisoner was heard to vow vengeance against his rival. The wretched victim
                     left the house, followed soon after by the prisoner, and was found next day on
                     the roadside—murdered, and his face so barbarously beaten in by a stone, that
                     he could only be identified by his dress. The facts were strong against the
                     prisoner—in fact it was the strongest case of circumstantial evidence I ever
                     met with. As a matter of form—for of his guilt there could be no doubt—the
                     prisoner was called on for his defence. He called, to the surprise of every
                        one,—<emph>the murdered man.</emph> And the murdered man came forward. It
                     seemed that another man had been murdered,—t at the identification by dress was
                     vague, for all the peasantry of Tipperary wear the same description of
                     clothes,—that the presumed victim had got a hint that he would be arrested
                     under the Whiteboy Act,—had fled,—and only returned, with a noble and Irish
                     feeling of justice, when he found that his ancient foe was in jeopardy on his
                     account. The case was clear: the prisoner was innocent. The judge told the jury
                     that it was unnecessary to charge them. But they requested permission to
                     retire. They returned in about two hours, when the foreman, with a long face,
                     handed in the verdict 'Guilty.' Every one was astonished. 'Good God!' said the
                     judge, 'of what is he guilty? Not of murder, surely?'—'No, my lord,' said the
                     foreman; 'but, <emph>if he did not murder that man, sure he stole my gray mare
                        three years ago!</emph>'"<ref rend="super" target="#note_027"

                  <p>The Cork Jurors laughed heartily at this anecdote, but, ere their mirth had
                     time to cool, O'Connell continued, with marked emphasis, "So, gentlemen of the

                        libelled the Corporation,—find him guilty, by all means!</emph>" The
                     application was so severe, that the jury, shamed into justice, instantly
                     acquitted Mr. Boyle.</p>

                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000211"/> Yet a few words about the man. In person, Mr.
                     O'Connell was well made, muscular, and tall. He looked the man to be the leader
                     of a people. He was fond of field sports, and while at Derrynane Abbey, for
                     four months in the year, lived like a country gentleman, surrounded by his
                     numerous relatives, and exercising the wonted hospitality of Ireland. His
                     features were strongly marked—the mouth being much more expressive than the
                     eyes. His voice was deep, sonorous, and somewhat touched with the true Kerry
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">patois.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was seen to much advantage in the bosom of his family, to whom he was
                     greatly attached, a feeling which was reciprocated with veneration as well as
                     love. His conversation was delightful, embracing a vast range of subjects. He
                     was a great reader—and, even in the most busy and exciting periods of his
                     political life, found (or made) time to peruse the periodicals and novels of
                     the day.</p>
                  <p>He was well acquainted with modern poetry, and was fond of repeating long
                     passages from Byron, Moore, Scott, Crabbe, Tennyson, and others. He was a good
                     classical scholar, though I have heard him say that he doubted whether, after
                     the age of twenty-one, he had ever opened a Latin or Greek book from choice.
                     French he spoke and wrote extremely well. Many of his classical hits, in Court,
                     were good—but few are remembered. I shall give one as a sample, In a political
                     trial he charged Saurin, the Attorney-General, with some official unfairness,
                     and Burke, his colleague, chivalrously assumed the responsibility. "If there is
                     blame in it," said Burke, "I alone must bear it.</p>
                  <l>'Me, me, adsum qui feci, in me convertite ferrum.'"</l>
                  <p>"Finish the sentence, Mr. Solicitor," said O'Connell; "add <q>
                        <l>'Mea <emph>fraus</emph> omnis.'"</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When at home, he lived in the good old Irish style. He kept a well-spread
                     table, and was idolized by the peasantry. His residence, Derrynane Abbey, is
                     built on a bold situation, next the Atlantic, and commands a view of the
                     Skelligs. The "Abbey," as it is called, is a comparatively modern edifice,
                     which has received various additions from successive residents. It is
                     irregularly built; so much so, indeed, as to be any thing but a model of
                     architecture. It is convenient, and, in the wilds of Kerry, that should
                     suffice; for who expects a Grecian dome in such a place? The real Derrynane
                     Abbey (or rather its ruins) stands on a little island in the Atlantic.</p>
                  <p>There is little statute-law about Derrynane, and nearly all the disputes in the
                     neighbourhood were allowed to rest until O'Connell could decide on them. He
                     used to sit, like a patriarch, upon a huge rock, in view and hearing of the
                     tumultuous throbbing of the Atlantic, and there give judgment, against which no
                     one presumed to appeal. Already that rugged seat is called "O'Connell's
                     Chair."</p>
                  <pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC7173-00000212"/>
                  <p>On the 15th day of May, 1847, having nearly completed his seventy-second year,
                     Daniel O'Connell departed this life. He had quitted the land of his birth to
                     seek for renewal of health beneath more clement skies,—so, before him, had Sir
                     Walter Scott. But the great novelist was happier than the illustrious orator;
                     and died, at least, in his own country, and in his own house. From the first,
                     it seems that O'Connell entertained no hope of completing his pilgrimage. He
                     feared, and I think he felt, that he was not destined to reach Rome, the
                     Eternal City.</p>
                  <p>The account of his last days, as given, at the time, by <title>Galignani's
                        Messenger</title> (the English journal published in Paris), is full of deep
                     interest. It is from the pen of Dr. Duff, the English physician who attended
                     him at Genoa. This gentleman first saw him on the 10th May—just five days
                     before he died. On the first visit, he found that the patient had chronic
                     bronchitis, of some years' standing. The next day it was found that congestion
                     of the brain had commenced. On the 12th, the illness increased; for the
                     patient, like Byron, had almost an insuperable objection to take medicine.
                     Then, for the first time, the mind began to waver. On the 13th he became worse,
                     slept heavily during the night, breathed with difficulty, fancied himself among
                     his friends in London, and spoke as if among them. On the 14th the words fell,
                     half-formed, from his lips. Thus he lingered until the next night, unable to
                     move or speak, but conscious of the presence of those around him. At half-past
                     nine on that night he died. Had he taken nourishment and medicine, he might
                     have lived a few days longer. But not all of him is dead—his memory remains,
                     and will long be kept green in the hearts of his countrymen.</p>
                  <p>Had O'Connell lived until the 6th of August, he would have completed his
                     seventy-second year. He enjoyed excellent health through the greater part of
                     his life, and had every chance of living to extended old age. His family are
                     proverbially long-lived; his uncle Maurice, from whom he inherited Derry-nane
                     Abbey, was 97 when he died; and O'Connell repeatedly said that he intended to
                     live quite as long, <emph>if he could,</emph> nor was it unlikely that he also
                     might approach the patriarchal age of one hundred years.</p>
                  <p>His last words to his physician conveyed a request that, as he was sure he
                     would present the appearance of death before he actually breathed his last,
                     they would not suffer the grave to be closed too promptly over his remains. His
                     strong hope was to die in Rome, his last moments soothed and sanctified by the
                     blessing of Pope Pius IX. He repeatedly expressed a desire that his heart
                     should rest (as it does) in one of the Churches of the Eternal City. This wish
                     was suggested, it has been said, by the recollection that Robert Bruce had
                     desired his heart to be conveyed to the Holy Land and deposited<pb n="424-425"
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000213"/> in the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. He died
                     without pain, gently as an infant sinks into repose, calmed by the consolations
                     of religion; and, it seemed to his attendants, not only content to quit
                     mortality, but even anxious to be released. His body was embalmed, and is
                     deposited in the Cemetery of Glasnevin near Dublin.</p>
                  <p>As to the ability, the mental resources, the vast power of O'Connell, there can
                     be no dispute. Unquestionably he was the greatest Irishman of his time. In
                     estimating the conduct and character of public men, two things, it appears to
                     me, should be considered: the value of their labours and their motive.
                     O'Connell, on starting into life, found that his religion debarred him from
                     many privileges and advantages enjoyed by persons of another creed, and he
                     applied himself, earnestly, to remove these disabilities. He succeeded, and in
                     the long and persevering struggle which he headed, acquired vast influence, and
                     a popularity which helped, with the aid of his own legal knowledge and skill,
                     to place him in the foremost rank of his profession. At the age of
                     fifty-four—in spite of the saying that an oak of the forest rarely bears
                     transplanting—he entered the British Parliament, where he soon took a prominent
                     position. Thenceforth his constant aim was to coax or frighten the Government
                     into the concessions which were included in the demand for "Justice for
                     Ireland." The threat of Repeal was used for this purpose.</p>
                  <p>The question whether he really desired to carry Repeal is difficult to be
                     answered. That Ireland should have laws made for herself, by her own
                     legislature, may or may not have been a desire with O'Connell. But that, when
                     agitating for the Repeal of the parchment union between Ireland and Great
                     Britain, he had the remotest intention or wish to effect the
                        <emph>separation</emph> of the two countries, no thoughtful observer can
                     imagine. Separation, in O'Connell's eyes, meant a Republic, and O'Connell was
                     essentially a Monarchist. He had an antipathy, also, to the exercise of
                     physical force to procure the restitution of a people's rights. In all
                     probability, had he lived during the struggle of the American colonies,
                     O'Connell would have sided with those who condemned the Americans as "rebels to
                     their King." Truth to say, he was rather an ultra-loyalist. This appeared, in
                     1821, when, kneeling on the shore, at Dunleary, he presented a crown of laurel
                     to George IV.,—in 1832, when he glorified William IV. as the "patriot King"—in
                     1837, when he appealed (at the elections) in favor of Victoria as "a
                     Virgin-Queen," forgetful that this distinctive epithet, belonging to all
                     unmarried girls of eighteen, would be forfeited, of course, <emph>when she
                        became a wife!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be conceded, however, that though O'Connell would have shrunk from
                     seeing Ireland actually<pb n="426-427 (Advertisement) "
                        xml:id="VAC7173-00000214"/> separated from England, he was sincere in his
                     exertions to obtain Emancipation, and, subsequently, to wrest other rights and
                     privileges from successive administrations. "Ireland for the Irish" was his
                     favourite cry; but it meant little when uttered by a man who feverishly feared
                     all <emph>real</emph> agitation, tending to assert and secure the actual
                     independence of the country. With him, "Repeal," if it meant any thing, meant
                     continuance under the rule of the British Sovereign. "Repeal" was a capital
                     party cry, but he dreaded it when it was taken up by men not less patriotic,
                     though a little less "loyal" than himself, who thought that boldness, courage,
                     union, and talent could raise Ireland from a provincial obscurity into a
                     national independence.</p>
                  <p>Great good was undoubtedly performed by O'Connell. His course was often
                     eccentric, capricious, inexplicable. His abilities were great. He made much of
                     opportunities. He wielded all but sovereign power over his countrymen for
                     years. He naturally became impatient of contradiction, and very impracticable.
                     But, with all his faults, O'Connell was essentially a great man.</p>

            <p>The Noctes were commenced in 1822, and closed in 1835. Even in England, the lapse of
               years has obscured many circumstances which were well known thirty years ago.</p>
            <p>DR. SHELTON MACKENZIE, already favorably known as editor of Sheil's "Sketches of the
               Irish Bar," has undertaken the editorship of THE NOCTES AMBROSIANÆ, for which a
               familiar acquaintance, during the last twenty-five years, with the persons, events,
               and places therein noticed may be assumed to qualify him. He has been on terms of
               intimacy with most of the eminent political and literary characters treated of in the
               "NOCTES,' and his annotation of the text will include personal recollections of
               them.</p>
            <p>Besides this, Dr. Mackenzie has written for this edition a "History of the Rise and
               Progress of Blackwood's Magazine," with original memoirs of the principal accredited
               authors of the "NOCTES," viz:—Professor Wilson, The Ettrick Shepherd, J.G. Lockhart,
               and Dr. Maginn.</p>
            <p>He will also give the celebrated "Chaldee Manuscript," published in 1817, instantly
               suppressed, and so scarce that the only copy which the editor has ever seen is that
               from which he makes the present reprint. There will also be given the three-articles,
               entitled "CHRISTOPHER IN THE TENT," (in August and September, 1819), never before
               printed, in any shape, in this country. The interlocutors in "THE TENT," include the
               greater number of those afterwards introduced in the "NOCTES."</p>
            <p>The "Metricum Symphosium Ambrosianum,"—an addendum to No. III. of "THE NOCTES," (and
               which notices every living author of note, in the year 1822), will be in corporated
               in this edition. This has never before been reprinted here.</p>

            <p>FOR more than a quarter of a century, the most remarkable magazine writer of his
               time, was the late William Maginn, LL.D., well-known as the Sir Morgan Odoherty of
                  <title>Blackwood's Magazine,</title> and as the principal contributor, for many
               years, to <title>Fraser's</title> and other periodicals. The combined learning, wit,
               eloquence, eccentricity, and humor of Maginn, had obtained for him, long before his
               death, (in 1843), the title of THE MODERN RABELAIS. His magazine articles possess
               extraordinary merit. He had the art of putting a vast quantity of animal spirits upon
               paper, but his graver articles—which contain sound and serious principles of
               criticism—are earnest and well-reasoned.</p>
            <p>The collection now in hand will contain his Facetiæ (in a variety of languages),
               Translations, Travesties, and Original Poetry, also his prose Tales, which are
               eminently beautiful, the best of his critical articles, (including his celebrated
               Shakspeare Papers), and his Homeric Ballads. The periodicals in which he wrote have
               been ransacked, from "Blackwood" to "Punch," and the result will be a series of great
               interest.</p>
            <p>DR. SHELTON MACKENZIE, who has undertaken the editorship of these writings of his
               distinguished countryman, will spare neither labor nor attention in the work. The
               first volume will contain an original Memoir of Dr. Maginn, written by Dr Mackenzie
               and a characteristic Portrait, with fac-simile.</p>

            <p>The Life of Curran is identified with the latest years of Ireland's nationality. He
               was known, tried, and trusted as a true Patriot. During the Reign of Terror, in 1798,
               got up by the Government of that day in order to betray the Irish Parliament into a
               parchment-Union with Great Britain—sinking the country from a Kingdom to a
               Province—Curran manifested an independence and fearlessness, as advocate for the
               accused, during the State Trials, which endeared him to the people from whose ranks
               he sprung. To use the words of Thomas Davis (who resembled him in many things) he was
               "a companion unrivalled in sympathy and wit; an orator, whose thoughts went forth
               like ministers of nature, with robes of light and swords in their hands; a patriot,
               who battled best when the flag was trampled down; and a genuine earnest man,
               breathing of his climate, his country, and his time."</p>
            <p>He was the centre of the flashing wits, the renowned orators, the brilliant
               advocates, and the true patriots of Ireland's last days of independence. The
               Biography by his Son, rich as it is in personal details, is capable of great
               improvement by the addition of numerous facts, anecdotes, and traits of character,
               relating to Curran and his contemporaries, which have transpired since its
               publication in 1819. Dr. Shelton Mackenzie, who has long been preparing for this
               task, undertakes to enrich the present edition by collecting and introducing these
               desirable illustrations. The work, thus completed, will in truth be a record not only
               of Curran and his eminent associates, but of the stirring and troublous times in
               which they lived. It will thus combine Biography and History, with Anecdote,
               unusually <unclear/> us and "racy of the soil."</p>
