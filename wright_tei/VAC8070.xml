MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
-.4.---&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
OUT or THE DU5L&#xD;
IT was drawing toward the close of a soft&#xD;
November day, some thirty years ago, when the&#xD;
sound of children's merry laughter burst sud-&#xD;
denly into the quiet garden of a quiet house,&#xD;
situated on the outskirts of the moderately-sized&#xD;
village of Tallahoma, in the populous and wealthy&#xD;
county of Lagrange. The sun had gone down,&#xD;
leaving behind him broken masses of gorgeously.&#xD;
tinted clouds, which were forming themselves into&#xD;
fanciful shapes of mountains and castles, while&#xD;
over the distant landscape the brooding haze of&#xD;
the Indian summer began to melt into the deeper&#xD;
purple of the gloaming; and the peculiar cool-&#xD;
ness that betokens coming frost, to make itself&#xD;
'     perceptibly felt in the pearly atmosphere. It&#xD;
only the llrst of the month, and as yet but&#xD;
few of the trees had shed their leaves. The&#xD;
russet of the oaks, the pale yellow of the elms,&#xD;
the burning scarlet of the maples, and the vivid&#xD;
gold of the chestnuts, were all in their glory, and&#xD;
formed a bright -autumnal background for the&#xD;
sober house which overshadowed the blooming&#xD;
garden, and the noisy groups that were scamper-&#xD;
ing up and down its paths.&#xD;
Very noisy groups they were; and yet their&#xD;
noise did not seem at all disturbing to a young&#xD;
girl who had followed them out, and stood lean-&#xD;
ing over the low garden-gate, while they played&#xD;
hide-and-seek among the rose-bushes, Perhaps&#xD;
this noise had grown an accustomed thing to her&#xD;
ears, as a great deal of it was her daily portion;&#xD;
or, perhaps, she liked children well enough to&#xD;
like even this their most disagreeable attribute&#xD;
&#xD;
-a conclusion devoutly to be wished by all in.&#xD;
terested in her welfare, since Fate had made of&#xD;
her that much-tried being, a governess. At all&#xD;
events she did not heed it in the least. The&#xD;
worse than Mohawk yells of uproarious Dick,&#xD;
the squabbling of Jack and Katy, the indignant&#xD;
remonstrances of elder Sara, and even the lifting&#xD;
up of baby Nelly's voice in injured weeping,&#xD;
were all unnoticed by their young teacher, who&#xD;
kept her eyes steadily fastened on the distant&#xD;
horizon, where the line of dark woods melted&#xD;
into the hazy atmosphere, an&amp;amp; the pale-blue ~&#xD;
smoke curled upward from several unseen chim-&#xD;
neys. Not that Miss Tresham did not hear the&#xD;
various disturbances, But, even in the school.&#xD;
room, she ignored a great deal, for pea~e' sake~~&#xD;
and, once out of that durauce vile, she left the&#xD;
children much to themselves-giving $~hem, in&#xD;
unimportant matters, that blessed freed~~~4f&#xD;
conduct and speech which no humai~ cre4~ti*o&#xD;
is too younger ~oo ignorant to appreciate.&#xD;
~he was a stately creature, thip Katharine&#xD;
Tresham; and one of the women who possess *&#xD;
power of attraction quite apart from personal&#xD;
gifts. her face was not S beautiful one, by any&#xD;
means; yet few beautiful faces pleased either so&#xD;
well or so long as this, notwithstan4ing Its faults~&#xD;
The gray eyes wer~e very clear and honest in their&#xD;
glance, but there was none of the a~1uny~gleam&#xD;
of violet orbs, or the dusky splendor which lwells~&#xD;
in dark ones; the coniplerion was very~n4&#xD;
pure, but rather pale, unless some quIck e~.tips~&#xD;
or pleasurable excitement, sent a olear earn~x*&#xD;
glow to the cheeks; the i~ose was .traigI~t anti&#xD;
delicate, but not in the least classical; and, it~&#xD;
the mouth was all that a mouth coul~l or should&#xD;
be, the unusual squareness of the kihii~ gave a&#xD;

2                         MORTON HOUSE.                                                             OUT OF THE DUSK*                       3&#xD;
&#xD;
finish to the face that was far from adding to its&#xD;
symmetry. Still, no one could deny that Miss&#xD;
Tresham was handsome-handsome in a very&#xD;
striking and aristocratic style-that her hands&#xD;
and feet were irreproachable in size and shape,&#xD;
that her lithe, sIendei~ figure was so well devel-&#xD;
oped that not even an artist could have wished&#xD;
for it around of flesh either more or less; and&#xD;
that she carried herself with a very distinguished&#xD;
manner. Most women, looking in their mirror&#xD;
at a face so fair and a form so noble, would have&#xD;
beefl tempted to murmur at the fate which had&#xD;
dealt with them so hardly; but this was the one&#xD;
point wherein Katharine Tresham proved her-&#xD;
self something more than mediocre. She did not&#xD;
indulge any vain regrets, or still more vain. aspi.&#xD;
rations; she did not mourn any withered hopes,&#xD;
or bewail any blighted' existence: but she took&#xD;
life as she found it, and bore its burden with a&#xD;
courage as cheerful as it was patient. Her em-&#xD;
ployers were always kind and considerate, the&#xD;
children were warmly attached to her, she was&#xD;
beyond the reach of storms that had on~e beat&#xD;
very roughly on her head; and as her disposition&#xD;
-a disposition more to be prized than gold or&#xD;
precious stones-was eminently one of content,&#xD;
she furled her sails, and rested quietly in the&#xD;
pleasant haven into which she had drifted, where&#xD;
'the sea was smooth beneath, and the sky was&#xD;
bright above her. No genius, the reader will&#xD;
perceive; no unsatisfied yearning being, full of&#xD;
repressed passion and morbid longings; only a&#xD;
brave; bright young gentlewoman, who was&#xD;
Christian enough to be satisfied that God knew&#xD;
what was best for her; who took the good He&#xD;
gave, with grateful heart, and rarely murmured&#xD;
at the ill.&#xD;
She was leaning over the gate now, softly&#xD;
singing' to herself a verse of song, and gazing&#xD;
over the scene before her, with eyes that took in&#xD;
and enjoyed all its beauty. But, after a while,&#xD;
t1~e children began a game very near, and sent&#xD;
their shouts ringing through the clear autumn&#xD;
air, with such hearty good-will, that the young&#xD;
governess was fain to put wider space between&#xD;
herself and their merriment. So she turned&#xD;
itway, and began pacing' up and down a sh~l-'&#xD;
tered walk-a walk bounded on one side by the&#xD;
garden-fanee and a hedge of Cherokee rosO, on&#xD;
the other by tall gooseberry-bushes. A bright-&#xD;
red glow of the flaming western sky fell over&#xD;
her as she moved to and fro, lighting up her&#xD;
rich brown hair, her clear, bright eyes, and her&#xD;
tall, slender figure, and making a very attractive&#xD;
picture of youth and grace, in the midst of the&#xD;
&#xD;
lovely autumn scene. At length, she drew a&#xD;
small volume from her 'pocket and began to read.&#xD;
Thirty years ago. Tennyson's fame was yet young&#xD;
-not so young, however, but that , even in the&#xD;
backwoods of America, men had heard his&#xD;
name; and the girl who paced up and down the&#xD;
garden on that soft Indian summer evening, was&#xD;
steeping her soul in the beauty and music of&#xD;
those early poems which no after-efforts can&#xD;
ever supplant in our hearts. Enthralled in the&#xD;
sweeping rhythm, it was rather hard to be sud-&#xD;
denly recalled to commonplace reality by a&#xD;
child's eager, uplifted voice.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, Miss Tresham!" sounded the&#xD;
cry, "Look, oh, look, what a pretty horse Mr.&#xD;
Annesley's on! May I-please-may I ask him&#xD;
to give me a ride?"&#xD;
"Certainly not," answered Miss Tresham,&#xD;
speaking with great decision, but without look-&#xD;
ing up from her book. "Katy, you know your&#xD;
mother forbade your ever again asking Mr.&#xD;
Annesley for a ride."&#xD;
"But she did not forbid her taking a ride if&#xD;
Mr. Annesley asked kes-, did she?" said a gay&#xD;
voice; and the next moment there appeared at&#xD;
the end of Katharine's walk, between the Chero-&#xD;
kee hedge and ~he gooseherry-bushes, a slender,&#xD;
handsome young cavalier, in riding-boots and&#xD;
spurs, who stood with Katy mounted triumph-&#xD;
antly on his shoulder, one tiny hand clutching&#xD;
nervously at his coat-collar, and her blond ring-&#xD;
lets falling in a golden shower upon his crisp&#xD;
dark curls.&#xD;
"No, I don't think she forbade that," Katha-&#xD;
rine replied, looking up with a smile, whether&#xD;
merely of recognition, or of welcome also, it was&#xD;
hard to say. "But indeed you are spoiling that&#xD;
child dreadfully, Mr. Annesley! She never sees&#xD;
you that she does not expect some marked atten-&#xD;
tion, and almost breaks her heart when you do&#xD;
not notice her."&#xD;
"And d~ I ever fail to notice her-when I&#xD;
see her?" asked he, swinging Katy to the&#xD;
ground, and coming nearer to Katharine-seem-&#xD;
ing, at the tame time, to bring sunshine with&#xD;
him in his hazel eyes and brilliant smile. "I&#xD;
am sure I am always very attentive-am 1 not,&#xD;
my little coquette?"&#xD;
The little coquette said "Yes," very prompt.&#xD;
ly; but Miss Tresham shook her head.&#xD;
"It seems I must refresh Katy's memory,"&#xD;
she said. "You would scarcely believe that the&#xD;
other afternoon-last week some timO, I believe&#xD;
it was-she cried all the way home because you&#xD;
passed her without notice, when you were accom-&#xD;
&#xD;
paying two ladies down the village street.. It&#xD;
was vain to reason with her-both her mother&#xD;
and myself tried argument unavailingly-and&#xD;
she sobbed herself to sleep that night in pro-&#xD;
found disdain of bread and milk, or even bread&#xD;
and jam, for supper."&#xD;
"I remember the afternoon," said the young&#xD;
cavalier, a little confusedly. "I was riding with&#xD;
my sister and a friend of hers. But Katy cannot&#xD;
say that I did not speak to her."&#xD;
"Ah, but you didn't!" said Katy, eagerly,&#xD;
forgetting her contrary assertion of the moment&#xD;
before. "You spoke to Miss Tresham, but not&#xD;
like you always do-and you didn't notice me at&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"You shall have a ride this evening to pay&#xD;
for it, then," said he; "and I will be more&#xD;
careful in future. Miss Vernon's horse wan&#xD;
rather unmanageable, and occupied all my atten-&#xD;
tion. She does not know how to ride as well as&#xD;
you will when you are grown."&#xD;
"Is she 'fraid?" asked Katy, with great in-&#xD;
terest.&#xD;
"Very much afraid," he answered.&#xD;
Then he turned to Miss Tresham, and asked&#xD;
if she would not come and look at his new horse.&#xD;
"So you have another new horse?" she said,&#xD;
smiling. "Of course, I will come and look at&#xD;
him. You know horses are my weakness, and&#xD;
-oh! heisabeauty!"&#xD;
"Is he not?" responded her companion,&#xD;
pleased with her burst of enthusiasm. "I was&#xD;
sure you would admire him.-Soli! Donald!-&#xD;
Steady, boy!"&#xD;
They had approached the gate, and were&#xD;
leaning over it together, while the horse, which&#xD;
was fastened outside, began to move a little&#xD;
restlessly at sight of his master.&#xD;
"Look at him!" said that master, eagerly.&#xD;
"Did you ever see a more symmetrical form?&#xD;
And his head-is it not superbly set on the&#xD;
shoulders?"&#xD;
"He is a paragon," said Katharine, playfully.&#xD;
"And-he is not dangerous, is he, Mr. Annes-&#xD;
icy ?-I must go and speak to him."&#xD;
"He is as gentle as a greyhound," said An-&#xD;
nesley, opening the gate for her to pass out. "I&#xD;
only wish-"&#xD;
Bet what he wished was left in doubt; for&#xD;
he paused abruptly, while Katharine went up to&#xD;
the paragon, and patted his straight nose and hi~&#xD;
glossy, satin neck, calling him many pet-names&#xD;
in her clear, young voice.&#xD;
"What an intelligent eye he has !" she cried,&#xD;
suddenly. "I really believe he understands all&#xD;
&#xD;
I am saying to him. Mr. Annesley, what is his&#xD;
name?"&#xD;
"Donald is his name; but I do not like it."&#xD;
"Donald? No; it is not good at all; it is&#xD;
not suggestive in the least; and it is not pretty&#xD;
either. He deserves a beautiful name."&#xD;
"Give him one, then," said Annesley, quick-&#xD;
ly. "He will be only too proud to own you as a~&#xD;
sponsor. I have no aptitude whatever for such&#xD;
things, and my horses are usually 'the bay' and&#xD;
'the sorrel' to their dying-day."&#xD;
"I thought you were more imaginative," said&#xD;
Katharine, absently. "Is he fleet?" she went&#xD;
on, still looking at the horse.&#xD;
"Tie is like the wind, or the lightning."&#xD;
"Is he? Then I will give you a name for&#xD;
him at once. Call him Ilderim."&#xD;
"Ilderim? You mean-"&#xD;
"The sobriquet of Bajazet, of course. It&#xD;
signifies 'The Lightning,' you know. Will it&#xD;
do?"&#xD;
"It is excellent,'~ he answered, as, indeed, he&#xD;
would have answered to any thing whatever of&#xD;
her suggestion. "From this moment, Donald&#xD;
dies, and Ilderizn rises like a phoenix from his&#xD;
ashes.-Soh! Steady, sir!"&#xD;
For, arching his handsome neck like a bow,&#xD;
the new-made Ilderim began pawing the earth so&#xD;
energetically with his fore-foot that he made Ka-&#xD;
tharine beat a hasty retreat.&#xD;
"What a racer he would make!" she cried,&#xD;
suddenly. "Is that what you intend him for?"&#xD;
"Why, no; I had not thought of it," he re-&#xD;
plied. "I was merely attracted by his beauty,&#xD;
and thought myself lucky to get him."&#xD;
"Lucky!" she repeated, looking up at him&#xD;
with a smile. "Most people are lucky when&#xD;
Fortune has never said them nay in any one de-&#xD;
sire of their hearts. I suppose you never wished&#xD;
for any thing in your life without obtaining it."&#xD;
* Standing there in the soft, purple dusk, with&#xD;
one arm thrown over his horse's arched neck,&#xD;
with an unconscious grace in the careless atti-&#xD;
tude, a suppressed eagerness in the handsome&#xD;
face, and a chivalric deference in the uncovered&#xD;
head, it was not hard to believe this-not hard,&#xD;
indeed, to tell that here was one of those to&#xD;
whom had fallen the purple and fine linen of a&#xD;
world which gives to others only serge; one of&#xD;
those to whom its wealth and fame, its love and&#xD;
pleasure, came, as it were, by right divine, and&#xD;
who now and then flash across the path of our&#xD;
work-day lives, and make our twilight seem more&#xD;
dun by contrast with their own radiant sunshine.&#xD;
"Yes, I have been very fortunate all my life,"&#xD;

4                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                            OT OF THll DUSK.                    5&#xD;
&#xD;
he answered, more gravely than Katharine's gay&#xD;
tone seemed to warrant; "but the future may&#xD;
overbalance the past, and you may give me my&#xD;
ftrst lesson in denial this very afternoon. 1? mean&#xD;
to ask a thvor of yen after a while."&#xD;
"I hope it is one that I may be able to&#xD;
grant," she said, quietly. "But you know my&#xD;
opinion on that subject."&#xD;
"That friendship is best ~rept free from fa-&#xD;
vors ?-yes. But I should like to convince you&#xD;
how wrong that is, I should like to make you&#xD;
believe that real friencl~hip never hesitates either&#xD;
to give or accept a favor."&#xD;
"Don't try," she said, lightly; "you might&#xD;
fail, and that would not be. pleasant to one who&#xD;
has never known failure. I will grant you this&#xD;
much, however-that, where friendship exists be-&#xD;
tween two people of equal position, they may&#xD;
afford to meet each other half-way in the matter&#xD;
of favors; but, where one occupies the worldly&#xD;
vantage-ground, it is not well for the other to&#xD;
accept benefits which may assume the weight of&#xD;
obligations."&#xD;
She spoke very calmly; hut a hot, red flush&#xD;
mounted swiftly to the brow of her listener. He&#xD;
'made one hasty step forward, and then fell hack&#xD;
again, irritating Ilderim very much by the unin-&#xD;
tentional jerk of his rein.&#xD;
"Why do you say such things? why do you&#xD;
take such a tone about yourself?" he cried, with&#xD;
a sharp accent of reproach in his voice. "You&#xD;
of all women! It is grievously wrong to your-&#xD;
self! It is even more grievously wrong to&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
"And why should I not look truth in the&#xD;
face?" she asked, gravely. "To say that I am&#xD;
not your social equal means nothing that either&#xD;
you or I need blush to acknowledge. It is merely&#xD;
a conventional accident, and does not even touch&#xD;
the other ground, the personal ground on which&#xD;
we meet-.-meet, I am glad to think, as friends.&#xD;
That you are Mr. Annesley of Annesdale, of gen-&#xD;
tle blood and almost princely estate, is a mere&#xD;
chance of fortune; and that I am Katharine&#xD;
Tresham, governess, who teaches Mr. Marks's&#xD;
children for six hundred dollars a year, is equally&#xD;
a chance. I am of the Old World, you know.&#xD;
Perhaps that is the reason why these things seem&#xD;
to me at once a matter of course and a matter of&#xD;
small moment."&#xD;
The young republican by name, the young&#xD;
aristocrat by race and nature, looked at her in&#xD;
wistful silence for a moment.&#xD;
"Yet you think of them far more than we&#xD;
do," he said, at length,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Because I have been trained to do so," she&#xD;
answered, moving toward the half-open gate,&#xD;
"and1 perhaps I ought al~~ tQ add, because 1&#xD;
am unfortunately very proud-much 'too proud&#xD;
to care whence I came.' You see I have not&#xD;
forgotten that apprenticeship to the convention-&#xD;
alities which I served when I spent a year as&#xD;
governess in England-a year I would not live&#xD;
over again for untold wealth."&#xD;
"But that was in England. You are in Amer-&#xD;
ica now, thank God!"&#xD;
Yes," she answered, with an arch gleam in&#xD;
her eyes, "I am in America now-America,&#xD;
where I am theoretically supposed to be the&#xD;
equal in all points of any among your county&#xD;
gentry-we will say, for instance, that lovely&#xD;
Miss Vernon. What would she think, do you&#xD;
suppose, if you suggested that she should call&#xD;
on Mrs. Marks's governess ?-But poor little&#xD;
Katy! See how downcast she is looking! She&#xD;
evidently thinks you have forgotten all about&#xD;
her ride."&#xD;
"I have not, though," said Annesley, half&#xD;
absently; and, looking up, he beckoned Katy to&#xD;
come to him.&#xD;
The little'girl gladly obeyed. She had left her&#xD;
companions to their play, and had been leaning&#xD;
wistfully against the gate, pushing~ back her&#xD;
bright curls, so as to see what was going on&#xD;
outside, and longing for the signal that was so&#xD;
slow in coming. When, at last, it did come, she&#xD;
bounded forward, and stood impatiently beside&#xD;
the horse, while Annesley gathered up the reins&#xD;
and sprang into the saddle. He bent down and&#xD;
lifted her from the ground to a seat before him,&#xD;
made her kiss her hand to the governess, and&#xD;
they were ofl the child's short dress fluttering&#xD;
in the evening breeze as they cantered down the&#xD;
road and out of sight.&#xD;
Katharine watched them, with a strange sort&#xD;
of yearning in her eyes. Perhaps she was think-&#xD;
ing how pleasant it would be to ride down that&#xD;
road, under its crimson and golden woods, in the&#xD;
lovely autumn dusk, with a crescent moon faintly&#xD;
gleaming above the still tinted west and such&#xD;
a stately and gallant escort by her side as he&#xD;
* who had just passed from her sight. Perhaps&#xD;
she thought of those to whom such pleasure was&#xD;
common, and-even the best-disciplined of us&#xD;
will sometimes do such things-contrasted her&#xD;
own life with theirs, I'erhaps she remembered&#xD;
that scene of last week, to which she had allud-&#xD;
cd-the two elegant ladies in their sweeping&#xD;
habits and waving plumes, the curvetting horses,&#xD;
the flashing bits and jewelled whips, the young&#xD;
&#xD;
cavalier, and the golden sunshine streaming over&#xD;
all, while she plodt~ed by in the dust and shadow.&#xD;
Perhaps she wondered if this dust and shadow&#xD;
were henceforth to be her portion; or perhaps&#xD;
she thought of a time when the sunshine had&#xD;
slept on her path too, when kind eyes and loving&#xD;
tones had followed her, when life had seemed fbr&#xD;
a short while the fair and pleasant thing which&#xD;
it never seems to any long, when a young girl&#xD;
who bore her name had smiled and talked and&#xD;
jested- beneath the waving palms of a distant&#xD;
tropic island, and when-but her thoughts went&#xD;
no further than this. It was only Mrs. Marks's&#xD;
governess who turned abruptly from the gate,&#xD;
and, with a resolute compression of the lips,&#xD;
that brought lines too hard for so young a face,&#xD;
b~gan the same pacing up and down the walk&#xD;
that had been interrupted half an hour before.&#xD;
It was not long before she was interrupted again,&#xD;
for Mr. Annesley did not give Katy a very ex-&#xD;
tended ride. Ilderim was brought up before&#xD;
the garden-gate once more, and Katy, flushed,&#xD;
smiling, yet regretful, lowered to the ground.&#xD;
Then Mr. Annesley sprang off also; but this&#xD;
time he did not fasten his horse to the iron&#xD;
staple so conveniently placed in a large elm-tree&#xD;
near by'. Probably something in Katharine's&#xD;
face warned him not to do so-he was very&#xD;
quickly sensitive to any change in that fare.&#xD;
At ~ll events, he kept the rein over his arm,&#xD;
and, uncovering as he advanced, spoke, half&#xD;
apologetically:&#xD;
"I am going in a moment, Miss Tresham,&#xD;
but-you know I told you I had a favor to ask&#xD;
of you. The evening is so lovely, I am sure you&#xD;
will not mind a few minutes longer in the open&#xD;
air."&#xD;
"Yes, the evening is very lovely, but rather&#xD;
cool," answered Katharine, in a tone which was&#xD;
cool also; "and I cannot promise to make it&#xD;
more than a few minutes, Mr. Annesley, for Mrs.&#xD;
Marks expects me to see that the children come&#xD;
in before nightfall."&#xD;
"I did not know that you were the ehil-&#xD;
dren's nurse as well as their governess," he&#xD;
said, somewhat hastily.&#xD;
"There you are right," she answered, quiet-&#xD;
ly. "But they don't obey their nurse very well,&#xD;
and they do obey me. So this duty has de-&#xD;
volved upon me-and it is not a very irksome&#xD;
one. I wish 1 had none that pressed more hea-&#xD;
The young man leaned forward over the&#xD;
closed gate which divided the~n.&#xD;
"And I wish to Heaven," he said, passionate-&#xD;
&#xD;
ly, "that I could make your life what it should&#xD;
be!"&#xD;
She shrugged her shoulders slightly.&#xD;
"Now, ~hnt is very kiud~ hut not ver~' wiae~&#xD;
There is One who knows what is best for us;&#xD;
and you might spoil the whole aim and inten-&#xD;
tion of my life, if you went to work to improve&#xD;
it after your own device. Really, I am very&#xD;
well content with it as it is. You must not let&#xD;
that foolish speech make you think otherwise."&#xD;
"Content I How can you possibly be con-&#xD;
tent with such occupation, such surroundings,&#xD;
such compan-"&#xD;
"Hush!" she said, quickly; for several small&#xD;
listeners had grown tired of their game, and drawn&#xD;
near. "It is all very pleasant-sometimes I&#xD;
think too pleasant, to last long. But you said&#xD;
you had something you wished to ask me."&#xD;
"Yes," he answered. "I wish to ask you&#xD;
-well, for one thing, why you will never let r~e&#xD;
do any thing to make your life more endure.&#xD;
ble?"&#xD;
"You do a great deal," she replied, a sudden&#xD;
cordial light springing into her eyes and making&#xD;
them beautiful. "You do more than any one&#xD;
has ever done before in-oh, such a long time!&#xD;
Do you think I am ungrateful for the books and&#xD;
papers, the flowers and music that brighten my&#xD;
life so much? Can you imagine I do not see&#xD;
how much more generous you would be if I&#xD;
could allow it? Surely, Mr. Annesley, you do&#xD;
not think that I have so many friends, or receive&#xD;
so much kindness, but that I feel this in ~ny&#xD;
heart of hearts."&#xD;
"Then grant me one favor," he said, im-&#xD;
pulsively. "Promise to give me one pleasure,&#xD;
which will be the greatest I have ever known."&#xD;
"I cannot promise in the dark. What is&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"It is not much-to you, that is. Only that&#xD;
you honor Ilderim by riding him."&#xD;
Katharine drew back a step in her surprise.&#xD;
"Mr. Annesley, you are surely jesting! Ride&#xD;
Ilderim I"&#xD;
"Yes," he answered, with a desperate attempt&#xD;
at nonchalance; "ride Ilderim-why not? You&#xD;
cannot say you would not like it; and I only&#xD;
bought him because I thought how well he would&#xD;
suit you. And-Miss Tresham, pray do not re~&#xD;
fuse me this my first request!"&#xD;
Katharine was silent for a moment. Not&#xD;
that she had a thought of yielding to any thing&#xD;
so inadmissible as what he asked; but simply.&#xD;
bee~use she was touched by the desire to give&#xD;
her pleasure, which was so delicately veiled.&#xD;

0                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                            MR. WARWICK'S GHOST.                    7&#xD;
&#xD;
"How kind he is!" she thought, "and yet, poor&#xD;
fellow, how foolish!" Aunesley, who had be-&#xD;
gun to feel uncomfortable at her long silence,&#xD;
was certainly relieved, but yet more surprised,&#xD;
when she suddenly held out her hand to him.&#xD;
"Thank you so much," she said. "You are&#xD;
so good-so kind I But, then, you know it is&#xD;
impossible."&#xD;
The action was only one of frank gratitude;&#xD;
but the next instant she was sorry for having&#xD;
given way to it. Very sorry indeed, when, glan-&#xD;
cing up, she saw that a carriage had approached&#xD;
unperceived by them, and was passing by, while&#xD;
several pairs of eyes looked curiously from the&#xD;
windows at this way-side scene. Katharine&#xD;
drew back her hand hastily, and a shying move-&#xD;
ment of Ilderim made Annesley turn at the' same&#xD;
moment. Thus they both looked full at the&#xD;
equipage, which, truth to tell, was rather a&#xD;
strange one for that road, at that' hour.&#xD;
Not that the equipage in itself was at all&#xD;
remarkable - only a dusty travelling-carriage,&#xD;
with two worn-out horses, a cross-looking driver,&#xD;
a large trunk behind, and numerous boxes on&#xD;
the driver's seat and under his legs. But the&#xD;
fact that it was leaving the village at such an&#xD;
hour, that the road was a retired one, only lead-&#xD;
ing to several country-houses, and to a town&#xD;
distant some forty miles, and that the faces&#xD;
which looked forth from it were totally unknown,&#xD;
conspired to make its unexpected advent surpris-&#xD;
ing. ;Strangera did not often come to Tallahoma;&#xD;
and ~ihen they did, it was generally in the stage-&#xD;
coach, and they ordered supper at the "Tallaho-&#xD;
mallotel," and went to bed like orderly and ordi-&#xD;
nary mortals. These travellers plainly intended&#xD;
to do neither; and they certainly did not seem&#xD;
very ordinary. The only outside passengers were&#xD;
the driver, who, as before mentioned, looked very&#xD;
cross, and ~ small spaniel, who looked very tired&#xD;
and patient. But three faces were gazing from&#xD;
the inside, when Katharine with haste drew back&#xD;
her hand, and Annesley turned round. The first&#xD;
that attracted their notice was one which would&#xD;
have claimed attention anywhere, or from any.&#xD;
body. A hollow, attenuated face, with features&#xD;
so finely marked that they stood out like pure&#xD;
Greek chiselling, and eyes so large and dark that&#xD;
they seemed shedding a flood of light over every&#xD;
thing on which they rested, was partially revealed&#xD;
under a black bonnet and heavy crape veil, and&#xD;
showed itself for a minute only-sinking back&#xD;
out of sight immediately. The two others kept&#xD;
their positions, and were hardly less remarkable&#xD;
-.hardly less remarkable, that is, to Tallahoma&#xD;
&#xD;
sight; for one was a beautiful bold-eyed boy&#xD;
who was staring with all his might, and hugging&#xD;
closely a small monkey; the other a woman&#xD;
whom Katharine at once recognized as a French&#xD;
bonne, in the usual dress ~if her class. It was a&#xD;
very brief gaze that the two parties interchanged&#xD;
aS the carriage moved by, and rumbled away in&#xD;
the dusk. An it disappeared, the eager little&#xD;
voices of the children standing around Katharine&#xD;
found utterance.&#xD;
"0 Miss Tresham, did you see the monkey?"&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, did you see the little boy?"&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, wasn't that a pretty lady?"&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, how funny the little dog&#xD;
looked!"&#xD;
"Dog! you're crazy! It was a monkey!"&#xD;
"It wasn't no such thing I It was a dog!&#xD;
Didn't I see it?"&#xD;
"And didn't I see the monkey? Silly!"&#xD;
"You're a silly yourself, sir I Miss Tresham,&#xD;
wasn't it a dog?"&#xD;
"Hush, children," said Miss Tresham, in her&#xD;
governess tone. "There were a dog and mon-&#xD;
key both." Then she turned to Annesley.&#xD;
"Who can they possibly be.?'~&#xD;
He shook his head. "I have no idea.&#xD;
Strangers, evidently; but where they can be&#xD;
coming from, or where going, at this hour, I&#xD;
can't tell."&#xD;
"And such strangers! They would not be&#xD;
extraordinary objects on a French or Italian high-&#xD;
way; but in this remote corner of the world,&#xD;
they are rather astonishing. Don't you think&#xD;
so?"&#xD;
"Yes," he answered, "rather astonishing."&#xD;
But it was obvious that they had made but a&#xD;
momentary impression on him, for he turned at&#xD;
once to the subject that had been interrupted by&#xD;
their appearance. "Miss Tresham, seriously, is&#xD;
there any reason why you should not give me&#xD;
this great pleasure?"&#xD;
"There are many reasons, Mr. Annesley," an-&#xD;
swered Miss Tresham, gravely. "But I have&#xD;
only time to give you one at present, and with&#xD;
that you must be content-by doing as you wish,&#xD;
I should make myself the object of countless&#xD;
remarks; and I might probably in the end lose&#xD;
my situation. That would be paying rather&#xD;
dearly for a ride, even on Ilderim. ~fhank you&#xD;
again, though; and now, good-by."&#xD;
The young man looked at her in the waning&#xD;
light with a passion of resolvein his eyes. "You&#xD;
will not think of this?" he asked. "You will&#xD;
not even give me time to try and change your&#xD;
resolution?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am sorry to say that I can do neither,"&#xD;
she answered, a little coldly. "It is late, and I&#xD;
must really go-and so ought you, for that mat-&#xD;
ter, since Annesdale is five miles off. Here! let&#xD;
me return your 'Tennyson.' I have enjoyed it I&#xD;
so much."&#xD;
He received the volume, and thrust it care-&#xD;
lessly into his pocket; then, while drawing on&#xD;
his gloves, he said:&#xD;
"I have received a packet of new books to-&#xD;
day; may I bring you some, when I come again?&#xD;
There are one or two I am sure you will like."&#xD;
"Then bring me one or two-not ~ she&#xD;
said, laughing. "Poor Mrs. Marks must not be&#xD;
frightened by another such imposing sight as,&#xD;
those dozen volumes you sent the other day.&#xD;
Bring some poetry, please. Formerly I did not&#xD;
care much for poetry; now I like it-I suppose&#xD;
because my life is so very prosaic. Once more,&#xD;
good-by."&#xD;
"Good-by," he echpcd.&#xD;
He vaulted on Ilderim, rode away a few steps&#xD;
wheeled suddenly, came back, and leaned out of&#xD;
his saddle toward the gate where Katharine was&#xD;
still standing.&#xD;
"Perhaps I ought to tell you," he said, "that&#xD;
I am not at all discouraged. You may yet ride&#xD;
Ilderim, and I may yet thank you for my first 'de-&#xD;
nial."&#xD;
With this, and before she could answer, he~&#xD;
was gone.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
Mit. wAnwIcu's GHOST.&#xD;
Miss TRESITAM remained standing in the place&#xD;
where Mr. Annesley $~ad left her, for a minute or&#xD;
two, gazing with slightly-knitted brows after his&#xD;
vanishing figure; then she turned, and told the&#xD;
children that it was time to go in.&#xD;
"It is cold," she said, with a little shiver;&#xD;
"and I don't think there is any use in looking&#xD;
for your father. Since he has not come already,&#xD;
he is not likely to be here for an hour yet."&#xD;
"We'll have to wait a long time for supper,&#xD;
then," remarked one small murmurer; but that&#xD;
was all.&#xD;
The legion knew better than to offer any&#xD;
open signS of disobedience to their chief; and,&#xD;
although discontent was rife among them, they&#xD;
followed her to the house.&#xD;
A flight of steps led from a side-piazza down&#xD;
to the garden, and across this piazza a flood of&#xD;
&#xD;
cheerful light was already streaming from two&#xD;
windows and a glass door which opened upon it.&#xD;
"Why, papa's here already!" cried Katy,&#xD;
who had bounded up the steps before any one&#xD;
else and taken an observation through the win-&#xD;
dow. "Papa's here already! Where did be&#xD;
come from?"&#xD;
Then the door flew open with a sudden burst,&#xD;
and the merry little crowd rushed pell-mell into&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
A very pleasant room it was, with a spark-&#xD;
ling, light-wood fire on the hearth, and a well-&#xD;
set table in the middle of the floor-a room&#xD;
abounding in comfort but lacking in luxury, and&#xD;
with little or no evidence of what are called re-&#xD;
fined tastes. That is, there were few books visi-&#xD;
ble, and theywere chiefly of an unused kind. No&#xD;
pictures excepting some ugly daubs supposed to&#xD;
be family portraits, and not even a vase to hold&#xD;
the royal flowers blooming by in such prodigal&#xD;
profusion. The aspect of the place proclaimed&#xD;
substantial ease, nothing more1 There were&#xD;
comfortable chairs, and one or two chintz..&#xD;
cushioned couches; there were various tables,&#xD;
with carved legs and bright-red covers; there&#xD;
was a glowering mahogany sideboard, 'there&#xD;
was a pretty little work-stand that stood in a&#xD;
niche near the fireplace, and there was a clock&#xD;
on the mantel that told the quak~ters with re-&#xD;
morseless exactitude. But the proprietors of&#xD;
the apartment were plain people, of no fashion-&#xD;
able pretension, and still less fashionable ambi-&#xD;
tion-people who were "in business," and were&#xD;
not ashamed of the fact; who were well-to-do in~&#xD;
the world now, but who had knowmi a hard strug-&#xD;
gle before becoming so; who were of the best&#xD;
morals, but of moderate culture; and who, while&#xD;
they were always glad of social advancement and&#xD;
social recognition, never went out of their way&#xD;
to seek either-people, in short, who were types&#xD;
of the best portion of the middle class-.'-the'por-&#xD;
tion that is neither hopelessly vulgar nor absurd-&#xD;
ly aspiring-and who, in consequence of sturdily&#xD;
respecting their own dignity, were universally&#xD;
respected by those above as by those below&#xD;
them on Fortune's ladder.&#xD;
The head of the household, Richard Marks,&#xD;
had begun life as a very small tradesman, ~nd&#xD;
it may readily be conceived that the mau who&#xD;
sold coffee by the pound, and calico by the yard,&#xD;
across a village counter, was scarcely Mdc to&#xD;
command, or even hope for, any very exalted&#xD;
social elevation. Yet social elevation of a cer-&#xD;
tain sort came with time-as it comes to all men&#xD;
who trust less to fortune than to their own en-&#xD;

&#xD;
deavor. To his diligence and energy, and to the&#xD;
scrupulous honesty which made all men recognize&#xD;
his word to be as good as his bond, Richard&#xD;
Marks owed at last an assured competency and&#xD;
an honorable, even an enviable, position among&#xD;
his fellow-townsmen. To these things he owed&#xD;
it that the most aristocratic gentlemen of his&#xD;
native county were proud to hold out the hand&#xD;
of friendship, not patronage, to him; and that,&#xD;
after many years of hard labor, he was now rest-&#xD;
ing on his oars as cashier and virtual controller&#xD;
of the oxie bank which did all the monetary busi-&#xD;
ness of Lagrange County.&#xD;
His wife, although the daughter of a gentle-&#xD;
man-if a spendthrift insolvent deserves the&#xD;
name-~-had sunk so easily to' the social level of&#xD;
her husband that those among her friends and&#xD;
acquaintances who still spoke of her as "Bessie&#xD;
Warwick,~~ were forced to explain the obvious&#xD;
fact as best they could.&#xD;
"She never had much sense," they would&#xD;
say, ~ and certainly no great amount of refine-&#xD;
ment-though she was so pretty-pretty in a&#xD;
certain style, that is; and then she inherited low&#xD;
tastes, ~io doubt. Her mother was shockingly&#xD;
commop,'if you remember. It was his marriage&#xD;
that ruined Arnold Warwick-at least his friends&#xD;
always said so"&#xD;
But, notwithsta~ing this unflattering opin-&#xD;
ion, Mrs. Marks certainly proved that she had&#xD;
found hei# right place in the world as helper of a&#xD;
good man's upward career1 The best of wives&#xD;
and mothers-yet, like most best of wives and&#xD;
mothers, apt at times to become a little tire-&#xD;
SOtn~ especially if she once began the circum-&#xD;
stantial history of Dick's dreadful accident when&#xD;
he fell and broke his collar-bone, or how little&#xD;
Katy whooped through an entire summer with&#xD;
whooping-cough. But a sensible and kind-&#xD;
hearted woman with all that; one of the large&#xD;
class of women of whom the world knows little,&#xD;
and hears nothing; who are not remarkable&#xD;
either for beauty or mental capaCity; but who&#xD;
1111 their own position in the world better than&#xD;
a Lady Blessington or a Madame de Sta~l could&#xD;
do it for them; who live a life all pure and&#xD;
blameless in the domestic relations, and who at&#xD;
~last go down to the grave leaving in the hearts&#xD;
of their children a good example and a fragrant&#xD;
memory.&#xD;
In her own way, too, Mrs. Marks was a good&#xD;
business-woman; and the only time in her life&#xD;
that she had acted without due foresight and&#xD;
deliberation was in the matter of engaging a&#xD;
governess for her children. She had accom-&#xD;
&#xD;
panied her husband on a short business-visit to&#xD;
Charleston some two years previous -to this&#xD;
autumn evening, aiA while there met Katharine&#xD;
Tresham.&#xD;
ed, The young foreigner, who had but lately land-&#xD;
was entirely alone in the strange city; and&#xD;
something in her refined, ladylike appearance,&#xD;
together with her deep-mourning dress, touched&#xD;
the kind heart of the elder woman. They were&#xD;
boarders in the same house, and, when she&#xD;
heard that Katharine was anxious to procure a&#xD;
situation as teacher; that she could give good&#xD;
English and West-Indian references, and that&#xD;
she would much prefer the country to any city as&#xD;
a residence, Mrs. Marks's mind was at once made&#xD;
up. She did not even wait to consult her hus-&#xD;
~band; she made her an offer on the spot, and it&#xD;
was gratefully accepted.&#xD;
"Indeed, my dear, 1 could not help it l" she&#xD;
afterward humbly confided to her lord. "It&#xD;
seemed so pitiful to see such a pretty young&#xD;
thing entirely along; and then, you know, the&#xD;
children learn nothing at all at school. You&#xD;
said yourself that Mr. Watson was good for&#xD;
nothing but to drink whiskey and pay attention&#xD;
to Lucy Smith."&#xD;
"I did say so," Mr. Marks replied, "but are&#xD;
you sure, Bessie, that your new friend will be&#xD;
worth much more? I don't mean, of course,&#xD;
that she will drink whiskey or pay attention to&#xD;
Lucy Smith; but, after all, there may be worse&#xD;
things than that. What does she engage to&#xD;
teach the children, and what are her terms?"&#xD;
"She engages to teach the children-well,&#xD;
every thing that is usually taught, I suppose,"&#xD;
answered Mrs. Marks, a little vaguely; "and,&#xD;
as to her terms, she does not seem to know very&#xD;
much about them herself. She taught one year&#xD;
in England, and received forty pounds-that is&#xD;
all she knows." -&#xD;
"Why, that is a little less than two hundred&#xD;
dollars," said Mr. Marks, opening his honest&#xD;
eyes. "Teachers must be plenty over there at&#xD;
that rate. Poor thing! I'll tell you what we'll&#xD;
do, Bessie. She is a nice-looking girl, and&#xD;
there'll be no h~rm in trying her. We will&#xD;
offer her four hundred dollars, and take her for&#xD;
one year."&#xD;
So it was settled; and so Katharine Tresham&#xD;
came to Lagrange.&#xD;
At the end of the year her employers re-&#xD;
quested her to remain, and Mr. Marks voluntarily&#xD;
raised her salary. The children had improved&#xD;
so rapidly that Mr. Watson would not have&#xD;
recognized his quondam pupils; and the bright,&#xD;
&#xD;
even temper of the young governess made her&#xD;
presence in the house a kind of moral sunshine.&#xD;
Altogether, as Mrs. Marks was accustomed to&#xD;
declare, she could not have been so exactly&#xD;
suited by anybody else in the world; and she&#xD;
weuld have had no possible fault to find with&#xD;
~mss Tresham if-there is an if to every thing&#xD;
earthly-she had been an orthodox member of&#xD;
that religious denomination to which Mrs. Marks&#xD;
herself belonged. But, dreadful to relate, Miss&#xD;
Tresham was that strange off-shoot of iniquity,&#xD;
in the eyes of Tallahoma, a blind and bigoted&#xD;
Papist. She had given Mrs. Marks fair warning&#xD;
of that fact before their engagement was con-&#xD;
cluded.&#xD;
"There is one thing I must mention," she&#xD;
said. "I am a Catholic. 1 know that most&#xD;
Protestants are very much prejudiced against&#xD;
the faith, and don't care to admit Catholics into&#xD;
their households. If this is the case with your-&#xD;
self, we will not say any thing more about the&#xD;
proposed engagement."&#xD;
But Mrs. Marks, although very much stag-&#xD;
gered by the information, replied:&#xD;
"My dear, I don't see that it makes any dif-&#xD;
ference. You will be uncomfortable, I am afraid,&#xD;
for there is no Romish church in Tallahoma;&#xD;
but, as far as I am concerned, I-I suppose we&#xD;
are all Christians."&#xD;
When the young governess followed her noisy&#xD;
charges into the sitting-room, a pleasant-looking&#xD;
woman glanced up and smiled from her seat by&#xD;
the work-table, while a much older man, with&#xD;
gray hair and frank blue eyes, gave her a hearty&#xD;
greeting.&#xD;
"Good-evening, Miss Tresham. How do you&#xD;
and the little ones come on ?-Well, Kelly, can&#xD;
you spell 'ab,' yet?"&#xD;
Spell it, Nelly, for your father," said Miss&#xD;
Tresham, smiling. "She knew it to-day, sir;&#xD;
but I am afraid that hanging head doesn't say&#xD;
much for her 'recollection of it now."&#xD;
"Speak up, little woman," said her father,.&#xD;
lifting the shame-faced scholar to a place on his&#xD;
knee. "Speak up-and I'l~ive you a six.&#xD;
pence."&#xD;
But bashfulness or ignorance continuing to&#xD;
hold the little woman's tongue, Jack and Katy,&#xD;
tempted by the promise of the sixpence, burst&#xD;
out with the spelling of the word desired, and&#xD;
were rewarded by being informed that the offer&#xD;
was not intended for irregular claimants.&#xD;
"I tell you what I will do, though," said the&#xD;
indulgent father, seeing the disappointment legi-&#xD;
ble on their faces. "Kelly must have her six-&#xD;
&#xD;
pence-but another shall be found fbr the first&#xD;
one who brings me the mail from your Uncle&#xD;
John's coat-pocket."&#xD;
"Is this mail-day?" asked Katharine, look-&#xD;
ing up. - "Then why did you not bring It your-&#xD;
self, sir?"&#xD;
"Because I have been in the country on busi-&#xD;
ness, and didn't come through town on my way&#xD;
home," answered Mr. Marks, good-humoredly.&#xD;
"I wish Warwick would come along! I want my&#xD;
papers-and I expect you want your letters, Miss&#xD;
Kate."&#xD;
"Letters 1" the governess repeated. "I&#xD;
thought you knew that I never receive any let-&#xD;
ters. There is nobo,~ly that I care to hear from.&#xD;
Indeed, the worst luck that could befall me would&#xD;
be a letter-unless it came from Father Martin."&#xD;
Father Martin was the priest of Saxford, a&#xD;
somewhat larger town than Tallahoma, boasting&#xD;
a small Catholic chapel, to which she went occa-&#xD;
sionally for ghostly shriving-and it was cer-&#xD;
tainly true that his rare letters were the only&#xD;
ones that had ever come to Katharine Tresham,&#xD;
since she first set foot on the soil of America.&#xD;
Nor did she ever write any that were not ad-&#xD;
dressed to him. She seemed to have severed&#xD;
every link that bound her to her former lif~,&#xD;
and, save in a few general particulars, her pres-&#xD;
ent friends knew no more of that life than if&#xD;
she had not broken their bread for the period of&#xD;
two years.&#xD;
"John is very late to-night," said Mrs. Marks,&#xD;
glancing up at the clock, as if itwas its fault that&#xD;
the waffles were burning in the kitchen. "I&#xD;
really think we need net wait for him any longer.&#xD;
Some troublesome man has kept him, and he at.&#xD;
ways begs me not to wait.-Sara, go to the door&#xD;
and tell Judy to send in supper.&#xD;
Sara obeyed; and, the next minute, two mu-&#xD;
latto boys began bringing in plates of biscuit and&#xD;
waffles. Then came some broiled partridges, the&#xD;
tempting odor of which caused Mr. Marks to look&#xD;
round with interest.&#xD;
"By George! that is delightful to a hungry&#xD;
man! Where did you get such fine birds, Des-&#xD;
sic?"&#xD;
"They were brought this morning, with Mr.&#xD;
Annesley's compliments," answered Mrs. Marks,&#xD;
rising and going to the head of the f able "~ent&#xD;
to me, the boy said-you have forgotten the&#xD;
cream, Tom - but I expect Miss Katharine&#xD;
knows more about them than I dos"&#xD;
Miss Katharine smiled slightly, but without&#xD;
the least tincture of embarrassment. "How&#xD;
could I possibly know about them I"' she&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
PAULINE MORTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
asked. "I saw Mr. Annesley this afternoon-&#xD;
did I tell you that he gave Katy a ride ?-but&#xD;
I assure you he did not hint that even one of&#xD;
the partridges was intended for me. You will&#xD;
spare me one, though-won't you, Mr. Marks?"&#xD;
In the clatter of plates and knives which fol-&#xD;
lowed, a step crossing the piazza outside was un-&#xD;
heard; and when the door suddenly opened, Katy&#xD;
was the first one to observe it. Sha sprang for-&#xD;
ward with a cry of "Uncle John! "-a cry the&#xD;
eagerness of which was more for the letters in&#xD;
Uncle John's pocket, and the promised sixpence&#xD;
from her father, than for the everyday presence&#xD;
of Uncle John himself.&#xD;
The new-coiner surrendered the letters to the&#xD;
quick little fingers that dived at once into his&#xD;
pocket, watched the payment of the sixpence,&#xD;
with a smile, and then walked to the fireplace&#xD;
and sat down, while Mrs. Marks sent out a requi-&#xD;
sition for hot coffee.&#xD;
"Never mind about that, Bessie," he said, in&#xD;
rather a tired tone. "What is on the table will&#xD;
do well enough. I only want to get a little warm&#xD;
before moving again-it is quite cool to-night."&#xD;
"What on earth made you so late?" asked&#xD;
his sister.&#xD;
"Business," answered Mr. Warwick, briefly.&#xD;
Then he sank back into his chair, and into&#xD;
Bilence~&#xD;
It was not an ordinary face, by any means,&#xD;
across which the fire-light played so fitfully-no&#xD;
more an ordinary face than John Warwick was&#xD;
an ordinary man. There was little beauty in it;&#xD;
and that little was more the beauty of expression&#xD;
than of feature; not much grace of outline or&#xD;
delicacy of coloring. But there was force of&#xD;
will and power of thought; there was a keen&#xD;
habit of observation, and sometimes there was&#xD;
an almost womanly gentleness-the latter not&#xD;
habitual nor often to be seen, but coming occa-&#xD;
sienally to melt the eyes and soften the mouth,&#xD;
around which someJiard lines lay dormant. Take&#xD;
It all in all, a face so full of moral and intellectual&#xD;
strength that the wonder grew how this man could&#xD;
possibly be brother to the pretty commonplace&#xD;
womafl who sat at the head of Richard Marks's&#xD;
table. Yet her brother he undoubtedly was;&#xD;
and, if Mrs. Marks loved her husband with all&#xD;
her heart, she certainly reverenced her brother&#xD;
with all her soul-~--for in him all the gentleman-&#xD;
hood of the father stood confessed, without the&#xD;
father's weakness or the father's vice. He it&#xD;
was who had raised their name from the mire&#xD;
where it had fallen, and given it once more an&#xD;
honorable rank. He it was who had claimed his&#xD;
&#xD;
birthright of social position, and placed his foot,&#xD;
when that foot was yet young, upon the place his&#xD;
father~ had forfeited. Men already forgot the&#xD;
poor drunkard who had ruined others as well as&#xD;
himself, and only remembered that "Mr. War-&#xD;
wick is decidedly our most rising hwyer." In-&#xD;
deed, they had long since begun to be very proud&#xD;
of him in Lagrange, to put him forward on all&#xD;
public occasions, and prophesy great future ad-&#xD;
vancement for him.&#xD;
The hot coffee came, and Mrs. Marks an-&#xD;
nounced its arrival to her brother; but he did&#xD;
not move. He seemed, indeed, so deeply sunk&#xD;
in thought as not to hear her; and it was Mr.&#xD;
Marks's brisk tones that roused him at last.&#xD;
"What's the matter, Warwiuk, that you sit&#xD;
there staring in the fire, instead of coming to&#xD;
supper? I hope you haven't heard bad news of&#xD;
*any kind?"&#xD;
"Bad news!" repeated Mr. Warwick, look-&#xD;
ing up with a start. "Why, of course not.-&#xD;
Did you say the coffee was ready, Bessie? I beg&#xD;
your pardon, but I did not hear you."&#xD;
He rose as he spoke and came to the table.&#xD;
The light thus falling for the first time upon his&#xD;
face, some change there attracted the attention&#xD;
even of the children.&#xD;
"Unky, you've got a bad headache, haven't&#xD;
you?" inquired womanly little Sara, by whom he&#xD;
sat down.&#xD;
"Unky, Jack says you've seen a ghost!"&#xD;
cried Katy, with her mouth full, despite an&#xD;
angry "You hush!" and a push under the table&#xD;
from Jack.&#xD;
And Mrs. Marks herself said, "What is the&#xD;
matter, John? You look pale."&#xD;
"Nothing is the matter, excepting that I have&#xD;
had a hard day's work, and am tired," he an-&#xD;
swered. Then, catching the gaze of a pair of&#xD;
eyes opposite him, he added, "Do I look so&#xD;
shockingly, Miss Treshham, as to merit all&#xD;
this?"&#xD;
"You look as if your day's work had been&#xD;
a very hard one," said Miss Treaham. "That is&#xD;
allI think."&#xD;
"I don't kn6~r," said his sister, doubtfully.&#xD;
"John, are you certain that is all?"&#xD;
"Not quim," he answered, with a flitting&#xD;
smile. "Jack was right in his conjecture-I&#xD;
have seen a ghost."&#xD;
"A ghost!"&#xD;
"A ghost, Bessie. As veritable a ghgst as&#xD;
ever came out of a church-yard."&#xD;
"My dear John, please recollect that I don't&#xD;
like such things talked of before the children."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, there is no rawbead and bloody bones&#xD;
in this," said Mr. Warwick, glancing round at the&#xD;
various pairs of eyes that stared at him from over&#xD;
various mugs of bread and milk. "The ghost&#xD;
was not even dressed in white, Katy.-what do&#xD;
you think of that?"&#xD;
"Oh, it wasn't a real ghost, then," said Katy,&#xD;
reathiessly.&#xD;
"Yes it was, though.-Come, Marks, put&#xD;
down your paper, and guess whose ghost I saw&#xD;
this afternoon."&#xD;
Mr. Marks laid down his paper as requested;&#xD;
but confessed himself unable to imagine, unless&#xD;
(with a sly glance at the children) it was that&#xD;
of old Mrs. Packham, who was buried about a&#xD;
fortnight before.&#xD;
But Mr. Warwick shook his head. It was&#xD;
not old Mrs. Packham, he said; but somebody&#xD;
who had gone away at least twenty years be.&#xD;
fore; somebody whom they all had known.&#xD;
And then he told his sister to guess. Where'&#xD;
upon, after much consideration, Mrs. Marks in.&#xD;
quired if it could possibly have been that wild&#xD;
son of old Joe Williams, who ran away ever so&#xD;
many years ago, and had never been heard of&#xD;
since. At which Mr. Warwick shook his head&#xD;
yet more impatiently.&#xD;
"Then tell us who it was," said she.&#xD;
And Katharine was struck by a husky tone&#xD;
in the lawyer's voice, as he answered-&#xD;
"I have seen Pauline Morton 3"&#xD;
-4-&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
PAULINE MORTON.&#xD;
Ir Mr. Warwick had announced the entire&#xD;
destruction of Tallahoma and all its inhabitants&#xD;
by an earthquake, there scarcely could have en.~&#xD;
sued a more astonished pause than followed the&#xD;
utterance of that name. For the full space of a&#xD;
minute, an entire silence reigned around the&#xD;
~table-.--a silence which Mrs. Marks was, of&#xD;
course, the first to break.&#xD;
"You have seen Pauline Morton, John?"&#xD;
'EYes," answered he, laconically.&#xD;
"Is she ~&#xD;
"She was in town, or else I could not have&#xD;
seen her."&#xD;
"But, bless my soul!" cried Mr. Marks,&#xD;
"where did she come from, Warwick ?-~-when&#xD;
did you see her?"&#xD;
"Of course she came from Europe. I saw her&#xD;
&#xD;
as she passed through ~allahoma, this afternoon,&#xD;
late."&#xD;
"Well, tell us all about it," cried his sister,&#xD;
a little impatient at these brief replies. "What&#xD;
is the use of doling out news llk~ this? Tell us&#xD;
how she looked, and what she said, and where she&#xD;
is going, and what she means by coming back&#xD;
here?"&#xD;
"Did you happen to see a travelling.carriage&#xD;
pass here abeut dusk, laden with trunks, dogs,&#xD;
and monkeys?"&#xD;
At this question there rose a shout from&#xD;
the children-the eager little pitchers, whose&#xD;
eyes and et~rs were open to all that was going&#xD;
on.&#xD;
"We did! Uncle John, we did! And a pret-&#xD;
ty lady, and a little boy in it, too."&#xD;
"Yes," said Uncle John, quietly. "That&#xD;
was Pauline Morton, on her way to Morton&#xD;
House."&#xD;
"To Morton House?" repeated Mr. Marks.&#xD;
"Then Shields, at least, must have known that&#xD;
she was coming."&#xD;
Again Mr. Warwick shook his head. ~'No.&#xD;
Shields was in my office this morning about that&#xD;
business of a trespass on the land; and I will&#xD;
answer for it that he had as Uttle idea of seeing&#xD;
the owner of the land as you or I might have&#xD;
had. Besides, she told me that she had no.t afl.&#xD;
bounced her coming to any one."&#xD;
"And yet you say she went to Morton&#xD;
House?"&#xD;
"Straight to Morton House.-Heaven help&#xD;
poor Shields's brain this night!"&#xD;
"Surely you must have mistaken," urged Mr.&#xD;
Marks. "Surely she went to Annesdale-her&#xD;
own first cousin's, yoit know."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick shrugged his shoulders. "1&#xD;
should think you would remember how little&#xD;
love there was between her and her first cousin,&#xD;
of old."&#xD;
"I remember," cried Mrs. Marks, "and I am&#xD;
sure that Pauline Morton would never ge unin.&#xD;
vited to Mrs. Annesley's house. But oh, John,&#xD;
she could not have gone to Morton House to stay&#xD;
to-night I-why, think of those beds tht* nobody&#xD;
has slept in for twenty years!"&#xD;
"Twenty years or not, she meant.~ to do it;&#xD;
and I don't think there's a doubt buV that she&#xD;
has done it. Twenty years! Can it be really&#xD;
twenty years since she went awayBesaie?"&#xD;
"Twenty years this past suiimcwi'saId'Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, decidedly. "I remember the v~y~ d~t~&#xD;
Did her brother come back, John ?-~-ani~ st*rely&#xD;
her husband is with her?"'&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Her brother, she tells mc, is dead. She did&#xD;
not mention her husband; but I judge that she&#xD;
is a 'widow."&#xD;
"And she caine alone?"&#xD;
"With the exception of a child and a ser-&#xD;
vant, quite alone."&#xD;
" Her brother dead!" repeated Mr. Marks,&#xD;
whose somewhat~ slow ears this last item had&#xD;
1.,&#xD;
~j7    just reached. ~ There must be some mistake&#xD;
about that, Johu-youmust have misunderstood&#xD;
her, or his death has happened very lately. It&#xD;
is not more than a few weeks since Shields&#xD;
showed me a let~r he had just received from&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"I only know that she is in deep mourning,"&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick answered; "and that, when I&#xD;
glanced at her dress, she said-or, if she didn't&#xD;
say, she intimated-that it was for~her brother&#xD;
she was wearing it."&#xD;
"It is very strange," said Mr. Marks, reflect-&#xD;
ively. "He must have dropped off like his Uncle&#xD;
Paul; for all the rest of the Mortons that ever&#xD;
I heard of were very long-lived people. She did&#xD;
not mention his complaint, did she?"&#xD;
"'No. She said very little-in fact, I saw&#xD;
her for a few minutes only."&#xD;
"But her Jooks, John 1" cried Mrs. Marks,&#xD;
with a woman's curiosity on this important sub-&#xD;
ject. "Is she as handsome as ever?"&#xD;
"How do most women look, Bessie, when&#xD;
n ~ap of twenty years separates them from&#xD;
youth?"&#xD;
"'~hy,,rather the worse for wear," answered&#xD;
Mrs Ma4~&amp;amp; with a glance toward her own face,'~&#xD;
as i~fieot~lin the burnished coffee-pot. "But.&#xD;
I ean~~imagine Pauline Morton any less beau-&#xD;
tiful than w~ien I saw her last."&#xD;
"You had better not see her again, then."&#xD;
she changed so dret~dfully?&#xD;
"She is the wreck-the ghost, as I told the&#xD;
children-.-of her former self."&#xD;
"I~ear, d&amp;amp;tr! to think of it! But she kas&#xD;
been married, ha~ she not?"&#xD;
"Certainly. I told you she had a-child with&#xD;
"And whom d.id she marry? You know there&#xD;
weroall sorts of reports at the time-people said&#xD;
she had ~iairied a count, or some such person."&#xD;
"'Whtch was as true as reports generally are.&#xD;
\Paullne Mortonhas come back as Mrs. Gordon."&#xD;
"Mrsiokat?"&#xD;
"Gordon. - IMd you ever hear the name be-&#xD;
2 fore-4nponnect~On with her, Imean?"&#xD;
"Never!" cried Mrs. Msrks, with a decision&#xD;
whIch rather surprised the governess, sitting by&#xD;
&#xD;
in profound ignorance of the subject under dis-&#xD;
cussion. "I heard that she had married some&#xD;
nobleman, and that she lived in Europe in grand&#xD;
style; and-and-for her to come back like this,&#xD;
to a place she always hated! Oh, John, I don't&#xD;
believe it!"&#xD;
"That's just as you please," Mr. Warwick&#xD;
answered, rising and walking to the fire. "I&#xD;
assure you, I have the name on her own author-&#xD;
ity; and, as for those ridiculous stories of counts&#xD;
and the like, of course no sensible person ever&#xD;
credited them. I remember hearing that she&#xD;
had married an officer in the English army; and,&#xD;
no doubt, this is, or was, the man.-Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am, did you see the carriage this afternoon?"&#xD;
"Yes; and the lady also," Katharine an-&#xD;
swered. "I had only a glimpse of her face, but&#xD;
it struck me very much, Does she belong to the&#xD;
Morton House where the children and I go to&#xD;
walk almost every evening?"&#xD;
"Morton U~use belongs to her," Mr. Marks&#xD;
answered, dryly. "I am afraid, if she has come&#xD;
back for good, your walks are at an end, Miss&#xD;
Kate."&#xD;
"Oh ! " cried the children, in chorus. '~ Can't&#xD;
we go to ?~Iorton House any more, and make&#xD;
Ponto chase rabbits in the garden? Oh, papa,&#xD;
whynot?" ,&#xD;
"Don't you ~iear why not?" asked Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, a little sh~rply-" don't you hear that&#xD;
the person who owns Morton House has come&#xD;
back to live in it? Now hush-or I will call Letty&#xD;
and send you straight to bed !-John, dear, you&#xD;
haven't told us yet where you met-Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
"Haven't I?" said Mr. Warwick, a44littlc&#xD;
wearily-he was evidently tired of the subject&#xD;
that was still so absorbing to his sister. "Well,&#xD;
it is not much to tell, Bessie. I left my office&#xD;
at dusk, this evening, and was on my way to the&#xD;
post-office to get the mail, wh~n the carriage of&#xD;
which I spoke came down th~.street. I glanced&#xD;
at it a little euriousW, wondering where it was&#xD;
going at that time 6f day, when a face, that :X&#xD;
should haverecogn~zed among thousandd' looked&#xD;
out, and made a aig1'j~9~the driver to stop. Be-&#xD;
fore I knew what:! 'was about, I was~s~iaking&#xD;
hands with P~iuline Morton." ( /&#xD;
He paused, with a half smile at the~xl~ession&#xD;
of eager interest on his' sister's fac~; b~ut? not-&#xD;
withstanding ~the smile,1 more than one of his&#xD;
hearers noti~d That it cost him an effort to re~&#xD;
in~ie.&#xD;
"The first thing I remember was her saying,&#xD;
How changed you are I' And I looked at her,&#xD;
&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
and answered, 'I am sure I cannot be mor4&#xD;
changed than you are."'&#xD;
"Why, John!" cried Mrs. Marks, reproach&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
"You think that was rather plain speaking&#xD;
I thought so myself when it was too late to recal&#xD;
the words. But she did not seem offended by m~&#xD;
candor. She only smiled a little, and said, 'Yes~&#xD;
I am very much changed-you will believe that&#xD;
when I tell you that I have come back to Morton&#xD;
to live.' I don't know what I said-something&#xD;
about my surprise, probably ; for I was sur-&#xD;
prised, as you may well imagine-but she re-&#xD;
peated the statement, and then, noticing that I&#xD;
looked at her black dress, she added: 'My poor&#xD;
brother !-you see I am all alone in the world.'&#xD;
'Excepting,' said I, glancing at the child oppo-&#xD;
site. 'Yes,' she answered, quietly, 'excepting&#xD;
him.' Then she told him to shake hands with&#xD;
V&#xD;
one of his mother's old friends; and the boy, who&#xD;
is a splendid-looking little fellow, held out his&#xD;
hand at once, and spoke to me-no hanging of&#xD;
the head, and putting the finger in the mouth,&#xD;
Dick. After a few more words, his mother said&#xD;
they must go on, as she wished to reach Morton&#xD;
House before night. So she held out her hand,&#xD;
saying she would be glad to see me; and you will&#xD;
be shocked to hear, Bessic, that, in responding&#xD;
to the invitation, I called her Miss Morton."&#xD;
"Good gracious!~~&#xD;
"It was very thoughtless, and, of course, I&#xD;
began a hasty aPology, being more annoyed at&#xD;
my awkward mistake from perceiving the effect&#xD;
which it produced upon her. First she flushed,&#xD;
and then she turned so pale that for a minute I&#xD;
thought she was going to faint. But she only&#xD;
gasped &amp;amp;~r breath a little, and cut short my ~tpol-&#xD;
ogy by saying: 'There is nothing to excuse. I&#xD;
am very foolish; but it has been a loi~g time&#xD;
since I heard that name, and it brought back&#xD;
so many recollections-just here. I am Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon now.' Then she drove off, And now&#xD;
that you have heard all that I know myself,&#xD;
Bessie, I hope you have no objection to my going&#xD;
out on the ~iazza to smoke a cigar."&#xD;
Mrs. M~rks would willingly have detained&#xD;
him for th~ purpose of further questioning; but&#xD;
she had an~hi~tinct that it would be useless. 56&#xD;
/&#xD;
she only w~~t~~ed him as he left the roQm, and&#xD;
then turned\~kcr husband.&#xD;
"You laughed at me several years ago, Rich-&#xD;
ard, when I said that I did not believe John&#xD;
would ever forget Pauline Morton. .Pray what&#xD;
do you say now?"&#xD;
"Why, exactly what I said then," answe~d&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Marks, looking up from the paper which he&#xD;
thought he shoulcj never be left to read ~in peace.&#xD;
- "I say that Warwick is much too sensible a m~n&#xD;
to be hankering after a woman he was in loire&#xD;
with more than twci~t~ years ago; and that-"&#xD;
"Oh, my dear, hush a moment !-Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am, will you touch the bell for Letty ?-Now,&#xD;
children, say good-night to yogr father, and go&#xD;
to bed; it is after eight o'clock."&#xD;
The children were evidently well drilled.&#xD;
They were dying to hear what was next 1to be&#xD;
said; but they went through the good-night cere-&#xD;
m~V and filed off obediently, when a tall negro-&#xD;
woman, in a bright red-and-yellow turban, ap-&#xD;
peared at the door. It is true, there was a riot&#xD;
in the nursery that night; .but no sound of it&#xD;
reached the precincts from which the young i~-&#xD;
surgents had been banished, for Letty. was, quite&#xD;
equal to the emergency herself, without~hlveking&#xD;
aid from the higher powers.&#xD;
Meanwhile Mr. Marks obst~inate1yAe~lined to&#xD;
canvass any further either the arrival of Pauline&#xD;
Morton or the state of Mr. Warwick's affections&#xD;
-at least until he had finished that article from&#xD;
whi~,h he had several times. been so ruthlessly&#xD;

"Those subjects will keep for some night&#xD;

"You never heard much about the Mortons,&#xD;

the pretty braiding that Katharine was pt~tting&#xD;
an apron for N'elly.&#xD;
"I never heard any thing," the young gove~n-&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
WHAT MRS. ANNESLEY DID.&#xD;
&#xD;
that the best idea of heaven he could give was&#xD;
that it would be even more beautiful than the&#xD;
groutads of' Morton House."&#xD;
"did its owners leave it?"&#xD;
"Ab, you may well ask! But it was all Pau-&#xD;
line's fault She was so beautiful and so proud&#xD;
that she scorned everybody and every thing here.&#xD;
She was never satisfied unless the house was&#xD;
full of strange company from the cities, and at&#xD;
last she told her parents that she would rather&#xD;
die than live in the backwoods. So her parents,&#xD;
who would have tried to get the stars for her&#xD;
if she had wanted them, loft their beautiful home&#xD;
and went *0 Europe-never to come back, as it&#xD;
turned out."&#xD;
"Did none of them ever come back?" asked&#xD;
Katharine, becoming rather interested.&#xD;
"None of them ever came back-until to.&#xD;
day. There was a young brother-only one-&#xD;
who grew 'up in Europe; and I have 'hcard that&#xD;
he laughed at the idea of returning to America&#xD;
to live. He must have spent money at a dreadful&#xD;
rate after his father's death; for Mr. Shields told&#xD;
John th&amp;amp;t the crops were always mortgaged be-&#xD;
fore they went into market, and we heard, not&#xD;
long ago, that the house itself was to be ~old.&#xD;
If that had 'been the case, I expect Mr. Annes-&#xD;
Icy would have bought it."&#xD;
"Why? Is he-"&#xD;
"A relation? Oh, yes. His mother was a&#xD;
Morton, and as handsome and proud as all the&#xD;
rest of them. She was poor, though, for her&#xD;
father squandered every cent he had. But her&#xD;
unele always treated her exactly as his own&#xD;
daughter, and people say he settled a very good&#xD;
sum on her when she married. She and Pauline&#xD;
were raised together like sisters; but they never&#xD;
liked each other. I don't know which was in&#xD;
fault; but they made no secret of the matter.&#xD;
For my part, I rather took Pauline's side, though&#xD;
most people were on Elinor's; but Pauline was&#xD;
very generous, with all her pride, and I don't~&#xD;
think she ever made her cousin feel her depend-&#xD;
once. They even' say that Mr. Annesley was&#xD;
Pauline's admirer, and only went over to Elinor&#xD;
after he was rejected. Then there's-O John,&#xD;
how you startled me!"&#xD;
"I am very sorry," said Mr. Warwick, who&#xD;
had come in upon them unawares; "but I have&#xD;
been waiting some time for a chance to speak,&#xD;
and, as you seemed determined iiot to give me&#xD;
cue, I was obliged to take it.-Miss Tresham, I&#xD;
wonder if you will excuse me when I tell you&#xD;
that I have just found a letter of yours in my&#xD;
pocket, which was left there through the joint&#xD;
&#xD;
carelessness of Katy and myself; and might have&#xD;
been lost?"&#xD;
The girl looked up at him wonderingly.&#xD;
"A letter for me, Mr. Warwick? You must&#xD;
be mistaken."&#xD;
"How often am I to hear that to-night?" he&#xD;
asked, smiling. "I think, if you will look at this&#xD;
address, you will acknowledge that, with all my&#xD;
stupidity, I have hardly made a mistake."&#xD;
He laid a letter down on the table before&#xD;
Katharine, who either would not or could not&#xD;
hold out her hand to receive it-a letter written&#xD;
on thin foreign paper, stamped with a foreign&#xD;
post-mark, and bearing her own name in clear,&#xD;
legible address.&#xD;
Not so clear and legible, however, but that&#xD;
it swam before her eyes as she heilt over it; and&#xD;
John Warwick was startled by the pallor of the&#xD;
face that raised itself, and by the anguish-stricken&#xD;
tone of the voice that cried out, as if unconscious-&#xD;
ly:&#xD;
"Ohif you had but lost it! if you had but&#xD;
lost it!"&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
WhAT MRS. ANNESLEY DID.&#xD;
* Ir would be difficult to exaggerate the excite-&#xD;
ment prevailing in Tallahoma-Tallahoma, which&#xD;
was very s4gnant just at that time, for want of&#xD;
something to talk about, and which was blessed&#xD;
beyond its most sanguine expectations in the ar-&#xD;
rival of Mrs. Gordon. The news of that arrival&#xD;
spread rapidly through the village; and, while&#xD;
Mr. Warwick was telling his story at the Marks's&#xD;
tea-table, it would be hard to say how many&#xD;
other tea-tables were entertained by different&#xD;
renditions of the same facts. True, there was&#xD;
a very general and unsatisfactory haziness con-&#xD;
cerning the why and wherefore that had brought&#xD;
back the wanderer's steps, concerning her inten-..&#xD;
tions, or even her appearance. But, then, these&#xD;
things promised an abundant harvest of gossip&#xD;
for the future; and all-absorbing for to~n!ght&#xD;
was the simple fact that Pauline Mbrton had re-&#xD;
turned.&#xD;
But on the morrow, after there was time for&#xD;
reflection, after the news had spread through the&#xD;
county, after the first shock of surprise was over,&#xD;
and people looked each other gravelyin the face,&#xD;
they began to ask, How had she returned?&#xD;
The answer was not long in coming. She,&#xD;
had gone away in the flush of her youth and&#xD;
&#xD;
beauty,' guarded by her parents, and with all the&#xD;
pomp of style and attendance which wealth could&#xD;
secure. She returned alone and unattended,&#xD;
with no husband to guard, no brother to pro-&#xD;
tect, no friend to vouch for her-no word of&#xD;
'warninG' no single order of preparation! She&#xD;
came to her childhood's home and her child-&#xD;
hood's friends with no pleasant stir and bustle&#xD;
of happy arrival, but silently and unexpectedly,&#xD;
more like an outcast seeking shelter than a&#xD;
daughter claiming her rightful heritage. Other&#xD;
people besides Mrs. Marks remembered when the&#xD;
Morons had gone away, and, contrasting that&#xD;
departure with this return, almost involuntarily&#xD;
shook their heads. The first impulse of the&#xD;
world is always to distrust mystery. "Some-&#xD;
thing is wro4" they said; and many of them&#xD;
said it the more readily because Pauline Morton&#xD;
had been one of those shining marks which&#xD;
envy loves, and because in her proud youth she&#xD;
had rather provoked then conciliated such a&#xD;
feeling.&#xD;
It is exceedingly doubtful whether any state&#xD;
of society has ever existed since "Adam delved&#xD;
and Eve span," when those who were subordi.&#xD;
nate in the scale of worldly advantage have not&#xD;
felt a sort of carping dislike, and at timc~s a bit-&#xD;
ter enmity, toward the few whom chance or for-&#xD;
tune has elevated above them. We can imagine&#xD;
how the rabble of Athens spoke of Pericles and&#xD;
-Alcibiades; we can conceive that hatred which&#xD;
from first to last the Roman plebeinna bore&#xD;
their patrician masters; we can guess how bit-&#xD;
terly the serfs and retainers, the scorned burgh-&#xD;
ers, and oppressed Jews, spoke in bated whis-&#xD;
pers of the great feudal lords; we can read how&#xD;
often and how fiercely the great unknown have&#xD;
lashed themselves into fury against some class,&#xD;
some order, or some individual that birth, me-&#xD;
rit, or circumstance, rendered illustrious; and&#xD;
we can well believe that the same envy which&#xD;
we see manifested in a dozen petty instances&#xD;
every day, the same envy which was tired of&#xD;
hearing Aristides called the Just-has been the&#xD;
great moving spring of many of earth's revolu-&#xD;
tions, and is equally the moving spring of half&#xD;
the ill-nature and more than half the ill-speaking&#xD;
of the world. To make a small application of a&#xD;
wide truism, it was certainly the moving spring&#xD;
of most of the ebullitions of spiteful spleen in&#xD;
which for many years Lagrange had permitted&#xD;
itself to indulge regarding the Mortons. People&#xD;
more generous, more frank, or more hospitable,&#xD;
than these Mortons, it would be hard to find;&#xD;
but they were of good blood, and very proud of&#xD;
&#xD;
their descent; they were immensely wealthy, and&#xD;
spent their wealth liberally. These tWo facts&#xD;
were amply sufficient to excite that alloy of&#xD;
popular dislike which otherwise their many good&#xD;
qualities-qualities that even envy could not deny&#xD;
-might have disarmed. Not that they were un-&#xD;
popular in the general sense of the term; not&#xD;
that men denied their genial uprightness of char-&#xD;
acter, or failed to respect them as only the honor-&#xD;
able are respected. But they were too prosper-&#xD;
ous l The world and the things of the world&#xD;
went well with them; Fortune favored them in&#xD;
all their undertakings, while those who were&#xD;
less lucky could only look en and wonder why&#xD;
and how it was. They kept great state, and,&#xD;
although some of the best blood of the country&#xD;
was to be found in Lagrange, 'still there was&#xD;
no family that quite ranked with the Mortons,&#xD;
to whose wealth and enterprise Lagrange was&#xD;
indebted for mue~i of its prosperity. The old-&#xD;
est and by far the most stately residence of the&#xD;
county was the house which had been built by&#xD;
the representative man of the line-one Hugh -&#xD;
Morton of three generations back. The village,&#xD;
of Tallahoma had begun its existence merely as&#xD;
the post-office of this house; and the same&#xD;
house had been for many years the centre of&#xD;
such a lavish and refined hospitality that its&#xD;
reputation spread far and wide throughout the&#xD;
entire State.&#xD;
Considering their social importance, then, it&#xD;
was no wonder that all Lagrange was thrown&#xD;
into a commotion when it was announced that&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Morton were going to Europe,&#xD;
- ostensibly for iheir son's education, but really&#xD;
to gratify their daughter's whim-the daughter&#xD;
who was accustomed to say that life in America&#xD;
was worse than death, who panted for the rush&#xD;
and fever of the Old World as ambitious men&#xD;
.pant for fame, and to whom it was solely due&#xD;
that her indulgent parents went abroad, leaving&#xD;
their noble home to pass into decay while they&#xD;
dwelt in Parisian hotels and Neapolitan villas. -&#xD;
She had the more easily compassed her point be-&#xD;
cause there was no one of sufficient moral force&#xD;
to resist her. Some men-most men, in fact-&#xD;
would have been utterly lost in the dilettante&#xD;
existence thus forced upon them; but her father&#xD;
was just the exceptionalman who enjoyed it. If&#xD;
he had been born among the lower classes in&#xD;
Spain or Italy, he would have spent his life on a&#xD;
door-step basking in the sun; and, as it was, he -'&#xD;
spent it in morally doing the same thing. He&#xD;
was frank and generous to a fault; but he was&#xD;
intensely indolent, pleasure-loving when the pur-&#xD;

&#xD;
suit of pleasure did not involve too much trouble,&#xD;
and fond df ease and luxury to an almost wom-&#xD;
anly degree. Mrs. Morton, for her part, was&#xD;
bound up in her daughter's wishes and her daugh-&#xD;
ter's triumphs, with a groat sympathy for both,&#xD;
and &amp;amp; great liking herself for the things that&#xD;
were so-attractive to Pauline. The only son was&#xD;
a mere ehuld. So, with none to put an obstacle&#xD;
in her path, Pai~iline's impetuous will carried the&#xD;
day. The desire of her heart was granted her,&#xD;
as the desires of our hearts are rarely granted&#xD;
to us here on earth; and, when she took her life&#xD;
in her own hands and went her way, it was as&#xD;
some gallant ship sails away from a familiar har-&#xD;
bor to cruise hI unknown seas, where happiness&#xD;
and fortune may be attainable, but where ship.&#xD;
wreck and disaster are much more likely to be&#xD;
encountered.&#xD;
F4 some time after the departure of the&#xD;
voluntary exiles, fragmentary news came back&#xD;
of their wanderings; of their cordial recognition&#xD;
by the English relatives they had partly gone to&#xD;
seek; of Pauline's fresh triumphs; and of their&#xD;
glittering life in foreign cities. ~ut all this&#xD;
was very vaguely told, and soon ceased alto.&#xD;
gether-~-fifty years ago the country-districtsof&#xD;
America were farther removed from such scenes&#xD;
than is the interior of China to-day. Soon all&#xD;
tidings of the Mortons ceased, and before long&#xD;
the Mortons themselves might have been for-&#xD;
gotten, had not the house which bore their name&#xD;
sand seemed gloomily mourning them, stood as a&#xD;
pei~petual reminder of their existence. Only at&#xD;
long inte vals certain items of intelligence still&#xD;
grated t e gossips of Lagrange. First came&#xD;
the tidi ga Mr. Morton's death; then news of&#xD;
~ 'a ma riage to some one, who was van-&#xD;
eusly represe~nt~d of every imaginable national-&#xD;
ity and rank; and, lastly, the announcement of&#xD;
her mother's death. Then silence fell, silence&#xD;
complete and unbroken, although the county&#xD;
leader of fashion, handsome Mrs. Annesley, was&#xD;
first cousin to the surviving brother and sister,&#xD;
ha4 been reared in their father's house, and-&#xD;
mairied frbmit. But everybody knew that Pau-&#xD;
line had i~ever liked her cousin, and that it was&#xD;
a happy day for both when Edgar Ann~sley (who&#xD;
was killed in a duel a few years later) took his&#xD;
bride prom the door of Morton House.&#xD;
I~emembering all these things, a thrill of ju-&#xD;
te~e interest and surprise ran through the couii-&#xD;
ty~hen Lagrange heard of Pauline Morton's&#xD;
retUrn. There was not a family of good rank&#xD;
within its borders that did not own some con-&#xD;
neotion of blood or ancient friendship with Mor-&#xD;
&#xD;
ton; and not a family, therefore, which was not&#xD;
personally interested in this unexpected arrival.&#xD;
Still even these people paused and looked at&#xD;
each other full of doubt. If Pauline Morton&#xD;
had come back among them with the state&#xD;
which, to their imagination, was always asso-&#xD;
ciated with the name; if she had thrown open&#xD;
the old hospitable doors, and lighted up once&#xD;
more the old hospitable rooms; if she had bid-&#xD;
den her friends around her, and asked their wel-&#xD;
come with the matchless grace they still remem-&#xD;
bered-they would have been the last people in&#xD;
the world to question whence she came, or why&#xD;
she chose tq shroud her past life in mystery.&#xD;
But the singularity of her course awakened in&#xD;
them the first chill of suspicion. Why come&#xD;
back in this way to her own house? Why&#xD;
write no letters? Why give no warning to the&#xD;
friends who had a right to know of her inten-&#xD;
tion? Why ask no aid from their support, she&#xD;
coming back so strangely alone to claim her old&#xD;
position? Why ofter no explanation of her mar-&#xD;
riage and widowhood? Why think that her old&#xD;
acquaintances would take for granted the twenty&#xD;
years passed away from them-the twenty years&#xD;
in which she might have climbed any height, or&#xD;
plunged into any depth; unknown to them?&#xD;
~Truly it was no wonder that the elders among&#xD;
them shook their heads'; and truly it did not&#xD;
look as if Pauline Morton had come back to win&#xD;
any very warnvweleome fron~ her kinsfolk and&#xD;
friends.&#xD;
Yetamong the former class was one person&#xD;
at least to whom no neutral position was possi-&#xD;
ble, one person on whom the burden of positive&#xD;
action was incumbent, and from whom every&#xD;
obligation of gratitude that the world counts&#xD;
binding commanded a speedy and cordial wel-&#xD;
come to the returned wanderer. This person&#xD;
was Mrs. Annesley; and yet her worst enemy&#xD;
-if, indeed, the handsome, charming lady owned&#xD;
any enemies-could not have contrived for her a&#xD;
more disagreeable surprise than the news of her&#xD;
cousin's arrival proved. When she heard the&#xD;
particulars of this arrival, she turned very pale;&#xD;
~and then-went to bed with one of those bad&#xD;
nervous attacks which always stood her in such&#xD;
good stead when an unpleasant exertion was&#xD;
demanded, or an unpleasant duty was to be per-&#xD;
formed. She deplored this necessity very pathet-&#xD;
ically; andassured the friends who came to see&#xD;
her that she was especially sorry because she&#xD;
could not go at once to meet ~nd welcome "dear&#xD;
Pauline." -But these fnie~ds were by no means&#xD;
obtuse; they understood the matter pert~eetIy,&#xD;

WHAT MRS. ANNESLEY DID.&#xD;
&#xD;
and told each other when they went out that it&#xD;
was evident Mrs. Annesley felt very awkwardly&#xD;
about meeting her cousin, and that they did not&#xD;
wonder at it.&#xD;
"It is unfortunate that I should be ill just at&#xD;
this time," Mrs. Annesley said to her daughter,&#xD;
Mrs. French-a pretty, fashionable-looking girl&#xD;
two or three years younger than her brother&#xD;
Morton, and lately married-on the evening of&#xD;
the day when these visits had been paid. "I&#xD;
certainly ought to see Pauline at once, and it is&#xD;
quite impossible for me .to do so* Yet people&#xD;
will be sure to think it very strange."&#xD;
"Mrs. Raynor told me to-day that everybody&#xD;
is waiting to see what you mean to do," Mrs.&#xD;
French answered. "If I were you, mamma, I&#xD;
would let them wait. A woman who comes&#xD;
back like this does not deserve any considera-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"I am not thinking of her," said Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley, truthfully enough.&#xD;
It was a little before dark, and the mother&#xD;
and daughter were quite alone in the chamber&#xD;
of the former. With the outside world it was&#xD;
still daylight, but here the shades of twilight&#xD;
had already gathered, deepening in all the nooks&#xD;
and corners of the room, and only dissipated by&#xD;
the ruddy glow which a bright wood-fire cast&#xD;
over the polished furniture and the softly-tinted&#xD;
walls. On one side of the hearth sat Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley in a deep arm-chair. Her cashmere dress-&#xD;
ing-gown, her dainty lace cap, and her velvet&#xD;
slippers, were all perfect; for she had made a&#xD;
tasteful invalid toilet in expectation of those&#xD;
compassionate visitors who had just departed.&#xD;
Opposite, and if pos~e in a still more luxuri-&#xD;
ous attitude, Mrs. French was sitting-the fire-&#xD;
light flickering over her silk dress, and glancing&#xD;
back from her gold els4tdaine. She had been&#xD;
busy with some net~i~g; but the rose-colored&#xD;
web had dropped in her lap, her bands were&#xD;
loosely folded over it,. and her eyes were roving&#xD;
absently from the fire to her mother, and from&#xD;
he~ mother to the heavily-draped windows that&#xD;
comn~nded a view of the lawn before the house,&#xD;
and the belt of dark shrubbery beyond. Finally,&#xD;
she stdd, languidly:&#xD;
It is a good thing that Morton is away.~,&#xD;
"It is a most fortunate thing," answered&#xD;
Mrs. Ani~esley, with energy. "Morton is so&#xD;
Quixotic in his ideas that there really is no&#xD;
counting on him, and he is so unfortunately&#xD;
straightforward that he cannot understand the&#xD;
delicate management which some things require.&#xD;
I nut sure he would give me trouble if he were&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
here; so I agree with you, Adela-it is a good&#xD;
thing that Mr. French wrote for him just now."&#xD;
"It will be at least a fortnight before he can,&#xD;
get back,", said Adela, who had been making&#xD;
some calculation of time and distance while her&#xD;
mother spoke. "Perhaps it may be longer, if&#xD;
Frank deckics to coxuewith him, as I hope he&#xD;
will. Then I shall keep' him here until I am&#xD;
ready to go back to Mobile."&#xD;
"It is very provoking 'that. you should need&#xD;
to go back," said Mrs. Annesley, pettishly. "I&#xD;
shall never be satisfied until you are settled in&#xD;
Lagrange. If I could only carry out my plans!&#xD;
If you could only live here ?'&#xD;
"Frank would never consent to it, mamma,"&#xD;
interrupted Adela, placidly. "He sags, very&#xD;
truly, that Morton will be marrying some day,&#xD;
and, of course, bringing his, wife here; and,'&#xD;
then, the arrangement would tever do."&#xD;
"Of course, there could 'be no question of it&#xD;
under those circumstances-that is, If Morton&#xD;
decided to make this place his home," said Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley. "But that was not my:plan, Adds,&#xD;
as you very well know."&#xD;
"I know you thought of Morton Rouse for'&#xD;
him, and Anneadale for us. That would certain-&#xD;
ly be very 'nice. But I suppose we nuist'give up&#xD;
all hope of it now."&#xD;
"That remains, 'to be seen," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley, quickly. "It is~ almost beyond pa-&#xD;
tience," she went on, "that this. iVonraA should&#xD;
come back now to defeat all my. pl4~ns~' Every&#xD;
thing wa~ so well arranged. 'Alfr~d4!~rton was&#xD;
perfectly willing to sell the hoflse, and Moxton&#xD;

amount he could have bought the finest planta-&#xD;

be to him like that- his 'great.grai~dfather's&#xD;

a child, I have counted on seeing him owner of&#xD;
Morton House. ' It seemed' to. rue it'1~wb1ld even&#xD;

"It would be very nice," said: Adela, whose&#xD;
'mind was still bent on the arrangement, as 'it&#xD;
affected her own comfort. "Frank and I could&#xD;
settle here, and I need nQt trouble myself any&#xD;

a fancy for; and you could have your rooms at&#xD;
both places, and visit between us, just as you&#xD;
liked, It is a pity that one of your cousins took&#xD;
it into his head to die, and the other one to come&#xD;
back just now."&#xD;
"Gordon 1" said Mrs. Annesley, slowly;&#xD;
"Gordon! I am confident that I once heard&#xD;
the name of the man Pauline Morton married&#xD;
and, if I could recall it now, it might be worth&#xD;
remembering. I am almost sure-as sure as I&#xD;
can be of any thing which did not dwell posi-&#xD;
tively on my mind-that it was not Gordon."&#xD;
"Goodness, mamma! Has she come back&#xD;
under a false name?"&#xD;
"I am not certain, of course; hut my- own&#xD;
impression is that she has. Don't mention it,&#xD;
though, Adela. People are talking enough&#xD;
about her already, and we need not circulate a&#xD;
fact which undoubtedly looks very badly."&#xD;
"You may be sure, mamma, that nobody ever&#xD;
acts as she is acting without some reason for&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"There is no doubt of that," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley, with a sudden flash of something like&#xD;
triumph in her eyes. "But it does not surprise&#xD;
me in the least-nothing that I could hear of&#xD;
her would surprise mc. Her pride and insolence&#xD;
were so great that they paved a fall for them-&#xD;
selves. Times have changed, Adela; you don't&#xD;
know how strangely it makes me feel to realize&#xD;
that twenty-five years ago Pauline Morton was&#xD;
the queen of Lagrange, and to-day it is doubtful&#xD;
whether there is a single person of good position&#xD;
in the county who will move an inch to welcome&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"It all depends on you," said Adela, in her&#xD;
languid way. "Mrs. Raynor told me that. She&#xD;
says that everybody is in doubt what to do, and&#xD;
they mean to wait and see how you will act."&#xD;
"There, again, times have changed," said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley, gazing into the fire. "Twenty-&#xD;
five years ago I was the dependent cousin whom&#xD;
Pauline Morton barely tolerated; and to-day it&#xD;
seems that here, in her own home, the question&#xD;
of her social recognition depends on inc."&#xD;
"It depends on you how people will receive&#xD;
her," said the matter-of-fact Adela. "If I were&#xD;
you, mamma, 1 would let her see this, and then&#xD;
-you might perhaps make your own terms, and I&#xD;
get Morton House after all."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley gave her daughter a glance, I&#xD;
and laughed a little.&#xD;
"You are tolerably quiek-witted, Adela, and t&#xD;
would make a pretty good diplomatist. Certain-&#xD;
ly, I don't owe Pauline muchin the way ofaf&#xD;
&#xD;
good turn; and certainly, also, the advantages&#xD;
of the situation are on my side now. If Morton&#xD;
is not the owner of Morton House yet, you may&#xD;
be sure that it will not be my fault. By-the-by,&#xD;
did Mrs. Ray-nor tell you any thing of those&#xD;
reports we heard about Pauline several years&#xD;
ago?"&#xD;
"Nothing at all, mamma, for she did not&#xD;
seem to know any thing. She said there had&#xD;
been reports, but that they were very vague,&#xD;
and she had never been able to make much out&#xD;
of them. She said, also, that you would not&#xD;
speak of them; but she was sure you knew&#xD;
more about the matter than anybody else."&#xD;
"She is mistaken," said Mrs. Annesley; LL&#xD;
know nothing about it. How or with whom the&#xD;
reports originated, I cannot tell; and, simply be-&#xD;
cause I did not choose to contradict them, peo-&#xD;
ple took it for granted that I believed them&#xD;
and was well acquainted with all the particu-&#xD;
lars."&#xD;
"I expect you looked as if you believed them.&#xD;
That is a way you have, mamma."&#xD;
"I certainly could not look n~ if I did not be-&#xD;
lieve them, when they were so entirely in keeping&#xD;
with Pauline Morton's character," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley, a little coldly. "She was always im-&#xD;
prudent and reckless to the last degree. If she&#xD;
has learned wisdom, it has been since she left&#xD;
Lagrange.-Will you ring the bell there, Adela?&#xD;
I must order some chocolate for my supper;&#xD;
coffee keeps me awake, and is bad for my&#xD;
nerves."&#xD;
The hell was rung; the chocolate was or-&#xD;
dered; the servant who received the order deliv-&#xD;
ered a message to Mrs. Fr~h about some house-&#xD;
hold matter which demanded her presence down-&#xD;
stairs; and, with the regretful sigh of an indolent&#xD;
person, the lady tore herself from her comforta-&#xD;
ble lounging-place, and departed. The door had&#xD;
scarcely closed on her, when Mrs. Annesley rose&#xD;
and walked to the window. The dusk had fallen&#xD;
by this time, and she could not do more than dis-&#xD;
tinguish the outlines of the familiar objects be-&#xD;
rore her-the piazzas and wings of the house,&#xD;
bhc graceful trees and well-trimmed shrubs that&#xD;
were scattered over the gently-sloping lawn.&#xD;
~very thing at Anneadale was in the mast per-&#xD;
~eet taste; but every thing was undisguisedly&#xD;
icw, and just now Mrs. Annesley's heart was&#xD;
ongoing for something which was old. Her hus-&#xD;
mnd had began, and she herself had completed,&#xD;
he house in which she stood; yet, charming as&#xD;
was in every appliance of luxury and com-&#xD;
ort, her perverse fancy went back to the stately&#xD;
&#xD;
rooms, dark and mellow with age, where her&#xD;
youth had been passed. She looked steadfastly&#xD;
out of the window, over the trees and shrubbery&#xD;
which her own hand had planted, beyond the&#xD;
dark woods and broad fields, until she saw-ia&#xD;
imagination-the noble oaks of Morton House,&#xD;
and the tall chimneys, from which, for the first&#xD;
time in twenty years, the smoke of household&#xD;
fires was curling upward. Then her brows con-&#xD;
tracted in a slight frown-a frown not sufficiently&#xD;
marked to darken the handsome face, or give a&#xD;
severe aspect to its smooth lines. "Times arc&#xD;
changed," she said, once more, but this time&#xD;
only half aloud. "Will she recognize that as&#xD;
plainly as I do, I wonder? Will she see that,&#xD;
indeed, the advantage is with me now, and that&#xD;
it is f6r me to decide whether Pauline Morton-&#xD;
the beauty, the heiress, the belle of Lagrange,&#xD;
twenty-five years ago-shall not be a social out-&#xD;
law in Lagrange to-day? whether, six months&#xD;
hence, Morton House shall not be in my Morton's&#xD;
hands?"&#xD;
Before long, Mrs. French came back, and&#xD;
found her mother sitting as quietly as ever be-&#xD;
side the hearth, in the dim, fire-lighted apartment.&#xD;
The two ladies spent the evening together, and,&#xD;
when they separated for the night, the lasti thing&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley told her daughter was that her in-&#xD;
convenient illness would at least serve one good&#xD;
purpose, in enabling her to see what other peo-&#xD;
ple meant to do in the ease of her cousin.&#xD;
Several days elapsed. Then she found that&#xD;
Mrs. Raynor was right, and that other people&#xD;
had made up their minds to the same masterly&#xD;
policy of inaction which she herself had been&#xD;
practising. So, urge~partly by this fact, and&#xD;
partly by a growing fear of her son's return, she&#xD;
became suddenly convalescent, thought a drive&#xD;
might benefit her, and ordered the carriage.&#xD;
"I won't ask you to accompany me, Adds,"&#xD;
she said to Mrs. French. "If I should go to&#xD;
Morton House, the meeting would, of course, be&#xD;
very painful on both sides, and had better be as&#xD;
private as possible. Besides, I don't care to&#xD;
draw you into a connection that may prove a&#xD;
very awkward one. Frank might object to it."&#xD;
"Frank is not of any importance," said&#xD;
Frank's wife, carelessly. "But I wouldn't think&#xD;
of such a thing as going-not for the world! I&#xD;
hate disagreeable people, and this Pauline Mor-&#xD;
ton must be very disagreeable. Don't tell her I&#xD;
am here, mamma-I beg you, don't do that!"&#xD;
"I am not sure that I shall go to Morton&#xD;
House," said Mrs. Annesley. "It depends on&#xD;
how I feel,", she added, gravely, as she went&#xD;
&#xD;
down the piazza-steps and entered the carriage&#xD;
which was drawn up before them. "Mrs. Tay-&#xD;
lor's, John," she said to the coachman, who&#xD;
stood waiting his orders. And, as the carriage&#xD;
drove off, Adds, who was still on the piazza,&#xD;
saw her lean back and put her vinai~vette to her&#xD;
nostrils.&#xD;
Her point of destination was not more than&#xD;
two or three miles from Annesdale; so she had&#xD;
not time to feel her nerves in any unpleasant&#xD;
degree before the mottled horses swept up to&#xD;
a red-brick house, set in the midst of a bright-&#xD;
green lawn, with a brilliant hedge on either side,&#xD;
and an ornate fence in front. here the languid&#xD;
invalid was warmly welcomed by Mrs. Taylor aad&#xD;
some half-dozen daughters, whose ages ranged&#xD;
from fifteen to thirty, and whose ugliness was&#xD;
from comparative to superlative degree. Mrs.&#xD;
Taylor was a widow; her daughters were all un-&#xD;
married; and, since country-life is stagnant at&#xD;
best, and a large household composed exclusive-&#xD;
ly of women must certainly bestow itS energies&#xD;
upon some employment, the Taylors, mother and&#xD;
daughters, were widely famed for devoting them-&#xD;
selves, like the Athenians of old, to "telling and&#xD;
hearing something new." Their house was the&#xD;
headquarters of all news (reliable or otherwise)&#xD;
which was afloat in Lagrange, and the mint where&#xD;
all reports were stamped for current circulation.&#xD;
If Mrs. Annesley had wished to put her finger on&#xD;
the public pulse, and feel how strong or how&#xD;
feeble were its beats on the Morton question,&#xD;
she could not have chosen a better place for&#xD;
the purpose.&#xD;
Perhaps this had been her intention. At all&#xD;
events, when she left the red-brick mansion be-&#xD;
hind, and was on the high-road, she gave the&#xD;
order, "Morton House."&#xD;
-4---&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
irma TWENTY ysins.&#xD;
HAIr an hour later, Mrs. Annesley's footman&#xD;
was unfastening a large, rusty iron-gate, and.&#xD;
holding it open while the flashing carriage rolled&#xD;
majestically-through. Then he let. the wings fall&#xD;
together with a loud clang, and Mrs. A'inesley&#xD;
felt that she was within the domain of Morton&#xD;
House.&#xD;
It was rather a dreary-looking place into&#xD;
which .she had entered; and none the less dreary&#xD;
because showing evident signs of much by-gone&#xD;
beauty and care-dreary with a forsaken air&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
of neglect under the soft November sky, at&#xD;
with the mellow glory of the November su&#xD;
shine streaming upon it. In all Indian-summi&#xD;
weather, there is a pathos of intangible sadne~&#xD;
-even on the bright road, and under its glorior&#xD;
golden woods this was sensibly to be felt; bi&#xD;
here it deepened into something almost approach&#xD;
ing pain, something which even a nature a&#xD;
wholly prosaic as Mrs. Annesley's could not bu&#xD;
feeL "One might believe it was a graveyard,&#xD;
she thought to herself; as her eye swept over th&#xD;
broad, park-like extent around her. A sudde:&#xD;
break in the closely-planted trees of the avenu&#xD;
spread a fair picture before her eyes-a picture&#xD;
fair in its decay. True, the noble lawn wa,&#xD;
thickly strewed with the fallen and moulderin1&#xD;
leaves of many autumns, and the once magnifi&#xD;
cent shrubbery, which on the south side stretehe&#xD;
away into far-reaching gardens, was now little&#xD;
more than an Overgrown wilderness. But ther(&#xD;
was an almost regal air of space spread over nIl&#xD;
and even neglect could not entirely destroy th&#xD;
matchless landscape gardening that had once&#xD;
been displayed here-the artistic grouping of&#xD;
trees and shrubs, the forest vistas, and the en.&#xD;
chanting vicissitudes of light and shadow so skil-&#xD;
fully blent and arranged. The avenue was at&#xD;
least a mile in length, and led almost directly&#xD;
to a broad, green terrace, which extended around&#xD;
the house, and from which stone steps descended&#xD;
to the drive below. The house itself was now in&#xD;
sight-old, large, brown, and weather-beaten.&#xD;
Yet, notwithstanding all the dreariness of fall-&#xD;
ing shutters and rotting roof, there was some-&#xD;
thing about it which made it not difficult to&#xD;
believe that it had once been the gaye~t and&#xD;
most hospitable dwelling in the county-a some-&#xD;
thing which had survived all the long twenty&#xD;
years when no feet had crossed its threshold&#xD;
save those of the servants, who once every six&#xD;
months opened the windows and let God's sun-&#xD;
shine stream for a brief space into the darkened&#xD;
chambers I-the twenty years when no house-&#xD;
hold-fires had blazcd on the cold hearths, when&#xD;
no masters voice or mistress's laughter, or chil-&#xD;
dren's merry tones, had sounded along its gal-&#xD;
leries, or broken the silence of its deserted&#xD;
rooms.&#xD;
"There only need a few repairs to make it&#xD;
again the most beautiful place in all the county,"&#xD;
Mrs. Anuesley said to herself, as she leaned for-&#xD;
ward for a better view of the house, which she&#xD;
was now rapidly approaching-the house that&#xD;
had sheltered her childhood and youth, and from&#xD;
which her husband had taken her a bride. And,&#xD;
&#xD;
AFTER TWENTY YEARS.                     21&#xD;
&#xD;
as she bent forward in the bright sunshine, and&#xD;
a- looked at the dark old front, with its lofty stone&#xD;
~r portico, a sudden vision seemed to rise before&#xD;
is her-a vision of a royal-looking girl, with a face&#xD;
is that was brilliant as an oleander blossom, with&#xD;
it hair that seemed to have caught the sunshine on&#xD;
i- every thread, with eyes of matchless splendor,&#xD;
.s w~th the profile of a Greek cameo; and the bear-&#xD;
it ing of a Oreek goddess. She saw this lovely&#xD;
~' vision standing where Pauline Morton so often&#xD;
e had stood, just within the shadow of the arched&#xD;
a door-way, wearing the fresh-flowing muslin that&#xD;
e Pauline Morton so often had worn, and turning&#xD;
e as if to greet her with the winning smile she had&#xD;
s seen so often on Pauline Morton's lip. It was&#xD;
~ only a moment that this picture of the past stood&#xD;
- framed there; but so vivid was it that Mrs. An-&#xD;
I nesley almost seemed to look through the open&#xD;
doors behind, and see the sunshine of long ago&#xD;
falling on the tessellated floor of the widecool&#xD;
hall-almost seemed to see the servants passing&#xD;
up and down the broad staircase7 the gay faces&#xD;
at the drawing-room windows, and all the life,&#xD;
the stir, the bustle, so long since fled forever.&#xD;
* It was only for one moment; the next, the yel-&#xD;
* low sunshine slept as peacefully as before on the&#xD;
closed door and vacant step.&#xD;
But the past had not come back in vain even&#xD;
to this woman's selfish heart, and, for a few min-&#xD;
utes, she wavered in the purpose which had&#xD;
brought her there. For a few minutes, she re-&#xD;
membered how long that roof had sheltered her,&#xD;
how constant had been the kindness, how lavish&#xD;
the generosity she had received there; she re-&#xD;
membered the dead who had befriended her, and,&#xD;
for once, the ingratitude s$ was meditating rose&#xD;
up to reproach her. Then her son's handsome&#xD;
face and gallant presence seemed also to appear&#xD;
on that threshold where she had so long hoped&#xD;
to see him master; and the mother's heart&#xD;
steeled itself again. "It is for him," she mur-&#xD;
mured; "and I should not hesitate at any thing,&#xD;
however painful, to serve his interest. Besides,&#xD;
it will depend upon herself-that is the only&#xD;
light in which to look at it. It will depend upon&#xD;
herself; and any one else in my place would act&#xD;
as I must do."&#xD;
As~ if to give emphasis to her concluding&#xD;
words, the carriage at that moment drew up&#xD;
before the terrace-steps, and the footman was&#xD;
on the ground lowering the steps, and ready to&#xD;
guard his mistress's dress from any contact with&#xD;
the dusty wheels. It was too late to retreat,&#xD;
even if Mrs. Annesley had felt inclined for any&#xD;
thing so recreant. But she alighted at once;&#xD;
&#xD;
ascended the steps and crossed the terrace, her&#xD;
ample skirts sweeping grandly over the neglect-&#xD;
ed walks; entered the portico, and, finding the&#xD;
door-bell gone, gave a summons with her para-&#xD;
sol on the panel. She was forced to repeat it&#xD;
more than once before the door opened, creaking&#xD;
a sullen protest on its rusty hinges, and a gray-&#xD;
haired servant appeared. He looked a little&#xD;
doubtfully at the lady standing before him, shad-&#xD;
ing his eyes with one hand, for the sunlight&#xD;
streamed full in his face; but she smiled at&#xD;
once in cordial recognition.&#xD;
"Why, Harrison, is it you?" she said.&#xD;
"And so you arc back in the old place. How&#xD;
are you?"&#xD;
"Oh, it's Miss Elinor! I beg your pardon,&#xD;
ma'am, but I didn't know you at first," the old&#xD;
man answered, as he took the delicately-gloved&#xD;
hand she extended, in the momentary clasp of&#xD;
his horny black one. "Yes'm, I'm back. Miss&#xD;
Pauline said as how she would rather see the old&#xD;
faces about her than any new enes, Miss Eli-&#xD;
nor."&#xD;
Miss Elmer! Yes, she was "Miss Elinor"&#xD;
yet, to these old servants of her uncle's house-&#xD;
hold; and, although she often met them, and&#xD;
heard the name, it had never brought back the&#xD;
memory of her youth as it did now, when she&#xD;
was standing at the door of Morton House, and&#xD;
heard it from the lips that had repeated to her&#xD;
the messages of friends and admirers in the days&#xD;
gone by.&#xD;
"And Pauline?" she said, eagerly. "I have&#xD;
been sick, Harrison, or I should have been to see&#xD;
her before this. How is she?"&#xD;
Harrison shook his~Jiead.&#xD;
"You'll see for yourself; Miss Elmer," he.&#xD;
answered; "and i'm afraid you'll be shocked,&#xD;
ma'am. But Pat glad you've come-mebbe&#xD;
you'll cheer her up a little."&#xD;
"Does she need cheering? Is she sick?"&#xD;
"Oh, no, ma'am, not sick, but so changed&#xD;
like. It was an awful shock to me, masam. Pd&#xD;
never a-known Miss Pauline."&#xD;
"I am changed too, Harrison. We all&#xD;
change in twenty years."&#xD;
Harrison shook his head again. "Not like&#xD;
her,'~ he said-" netlike her."&#xD;
Then he led the way across the hall, threw&#xD;
open the drawing-room door, with something of&#xD;
his old formality; said, "Walk in, ma'am," quite&#xD;
grandly, and, after Mrs. Annesley had walked in,&#xD;
shut the door, and left her alone with the chill&#xD;
and the darkness-for 'it was both chill and&#xD;
dark after the glowing softness of the outer air.&#xD;
&#xD;
Standing where she had been left, the lady&#xD;
looked round and shivered, as if with a sudden&#xD;
ague. This was one of the suite of reception-&#xD;
rooms, which she well remembered-the first one&#xD;
looking to thefront-but the curtains were looped&#xD;
back from the arch that divided it from the ad-&#xD;
joining apartment; and, when her eyes grew ac-&#xD;
customed to the dim light, she gazed straight into&#xD;
the room where she had been married-straight&#xD;
at the very table near which she had stood, and&#xD;
at the very pattern of the carpet which she had&#xD;
traced with her downcast eyes while the cere-&#xD;
mony proceeded. Nay, not more than a few&#xD;
steps from her, was the sofa upon which she&#xD;
sat when Edgar Annesley asked her to be his&#xD;
wife, and told her, in his frank, honorable way,&#xD;
that, although he could never love her as he had&#xD;
once loved her cousin, yet he would be to her a&#xD;
true and tender husband. There was the piano&#xD;
on which she had so often played duets with&#xD;
Pauline-there was her aunt's favorite chair;&#xD;
and there her uncle's whist-table. Turn where&#xD;
she would, some memory of the past assailed&#xD;
her; and exclaiming impatiently, "It is worse&#xD;
than meeting a procession of ghosts!" she sud-&#xD;
denly crossed the room, and threw open an end&#xD;
window. The sunshine streamed in as if glad&#xD;
of an entrance; and then she perceived the rav-&#xD;
ages of time-the mildewed walls, the moth-&#xD;
eaten furniture, the faded curtains. "Repairs&#xD;
are needed worse than I thought," she said, half&#xD;
aloud; and, as she said it, she fell to thinking&#xD;
how well these lofty rooms would look newly&#xD;
fitted; how admirably a rich deep green would&#xD;
do for the one in which she stood; and how well&#xD;
green became the blond beauty of Irene Vernon&#xD;
-the girl of all others whom she most wished to&#xD;
see her son's wife. She was so engrossed by&#xD;
these fancies, that the opening of the door did&#xD;
not rouse her, standing as she was with her&#xD;
back to it; neither did a quiet step which crossed&#xD;
the apartment; and it was not until a light touch&#xD;
fell on her arm, that she started, turned, and&#xD;
stood face to face with the cousin from whom&#xD;
she had parted twenty years before.&#xD;
They stood and looked at each Qther-neither&#xD;
speaking for a moment. They had lived together&#xD;
in the past as intimately as sisters; but neither&#xD;
of them had ever entertained a sister's regard for&#xD;
the other. Therefore, they felt no affectionate&#xD;
impulse to rush into each other's arms; and,&#xD;
honest in the present as in the past, they did not&#xD;
feign it. They did not break into any noisy&#xD;
greetings, or take refuge in the commoiiplaces&#xD;
of ordinary welcome; they did not even shake&#xD;
&#xD;

22                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                           AFTER TWENTY YEARS.                     23&#xD;
&#xD;
hands-they only stood and looked at the faces&#xD;
over which twenty years had passed.&#xD;
A greater contrast than these two faces pre-&#xD;
sented it would be hard to imagine-one so hand-&#xD;
some and well preserved, so smooth of skin, so&#xD;
clear of outline, so suave and smiling of aspect,&#xD;
with aot a. silver thread in the shining black&#xD;
hair, or even an incipient crow's-foot around&#xD;
the cold ~Aack eyes; the other so worn and hag-&#xD;
gard, so deeply lined and darkened over, so be-&#xD;
reft of all beauty save the Would of feature and&#xD;
the magitv~kf glance, so s~iinped with the dreary&#xD;
stamp pi~suffering, so marked with the bitter&#xD;
signet of anguish, so utterly lost to all the bright&#xD;
bravery of the world, that, save for a proud no-&#xD;
bility which still dwelt in, and redeemed it-save&#xD;
for the lovely pathos of the eyes, and the haughty&#xD;
curve of the lips-there was no depth of tragedy&#xD;
in which it was not possible to fancy that this&#xD;
woman might have played a part.&#xD;
This, at least, was the first tangible idea which&#xD;
came to Mrs. Annesley's mind, as she saw that&#xD;
not even Harrison's dismal prophecy had pre-&#xD;
pared her for the extent of the change, and as&#xD;
she recognized how far below the surface that&#xD;
change had struck. This her cousin! This Pau-&#xD;
line Morton! This the girl who had gone away&#xD;
in the spring-tide splendor of her youth and&#xD;
beauty! "Good God! 1 can believe any thing&#xD;
of her now!" she thought, as she gazed in mute&#xD;
dismay on that world-worn face.&#xD;
It was Mrs. Gordon who first broke the&#xD;
silence.&#xD;
"How little changed you are, Elmer!" she&#xD;
said, in a rich, sweet voice; "and how it brings&#xD;
,back the old time to see you again-here!"&#xD;
"But you!" cried Mrs. Annesley, thrown for&#xD;
once entirely beyond the range of her usual con-&#xD;
ventionalities-" you! ?auline, for Heaven's&#xD;
sake, what have you been doing to yourself that&#xD;
you look like this?"&#xD;
"Am I so very much changed, then?" asked&#xD;
her cousin, with~a smile-oh, st different from&#xD;
the smile that eha~wy beauty had worn who&#xD;
stood in the door-way and greeted Mrs. Annes.&#xD;
icy half an hour before!&#xD;
"Changed!" She stopped, abruptly; but&#xD;
the tone that said that much had said enough.&#xD;
There was a moment's silence. Then the&#xD;
other, taking her hand, leaned forward, and&#xD;
lightly kissed her cheek.&#xD;
"Yours is the first kindred face I have seen,"&#xD;
she said, gently, yet with a certain diguit~. "Let&#xD;
inc bid you welcome to Morton House."&#xD;
And in the to~e, the action, there was that&#xD;
&#xD;
which took the ground from beneath sirs. Annes-&#xD;
icy's feet. She had come, meaning to patronize&#xD;
with all the grandiloquent patronage of her&#xD;
changed position; and one second seemed to&#xD;
place her back on the old level, to which Pau-&#xD;
line Morton had once bent with this same stately&#xD;
grace, but never succeeded in making her cousin&#xD;
forget that she did bend. For an instant, Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley caught her breath; for an instant, she&#xD;
almost forgot that she was not again the penni-&#xD;
less relation who was bidden welcome to a home&#xD;
she might share, but never inherit. Then she&#xD;
recovered herself, and returned her cousin s&#xD;
caress with more effusion than that cousin's&#xD;
manner seemed to warrant.&#xD;
~~My dear Pauline, those words are more mine&#xD;
than yours. Welcome, indeed-welcome to your&#xD;
old home and your old friends!"&#xD;
"Thank you, Elmer," her cousin replied,&#xD;
quietly. "Pray sit down."&#xD;
"Of course, I should have come. to you at&#xD;
once, if lb ad not been ill-really ill. I am here&#xD;
to-day in defiance of the doctor."&#xD;
"Indeed! I should not think you looking&#xD;
badly. But it was one of your old nervous at-&#xD;
tacks, I suppose?"&#xD;
"Yes, one of my old nervous attacks," re-&#xD;
plied Mrs. Annesley, unblushingly. "They seem&#xD;
to grow worse as I grow older."&#xD;
"I am sorry to hear that.-.-You must be&#xD;
tired by your drive. I will order some refresh-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
She moved away a few steps to ring a bell,&#xD;
and Mrs. Annesley bad a good opportunity for&#xD;
observing how straight and rigid was the dress&#xD;
she wore, how hideous tl* cap that covered all&#xD;
save a little of the hair so thickly sown with&#xD;
gray, and how every harmless beautifier of the&#xD;
toilet seemed sternly banished fron~the costume.&#xD;
When she returned, the latter said, wonder-&#xD;
ingly:&#xD;
"Have you turned Romanist, Pauline, and&#xD;
acre you going to establish a nunnery, that you&#xD;
dress in such a style as this? You look like a&#xD;
nun, I assure you."&#xD;
"If you had ever seen a nun, Ehinor, you&#xD;
would not think so," the other answered, with a&#xD;
faint smile. "A nun's face is always sweet and&#xD;
serene-not world-battered and world-worn, like&#xD;
mine."&#xD;
"ThenFwhat do you mean by this?" and the&#xD;
gloved hand touched the black fabric near it.&#xD;
"1 only mean that I have renounced the&#xD;
world as much as if I had cone into a clois-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
&#xD;
"My dear Pauline!"&#xD;
"Does that surprise you, Elinor? Ah! you&#xD;
have not drunk the dregs of life, as I have."&#xD;
"Surprise me? Of course, it surprises me.&#xD;
But I don't understand."&#xD;
"No, I don't suppose~ you do. I hope there&#xD;
are not many people who would fully understand.&#xD;
-Do you know what I have come back here&#xD;
How should 1?&#xD;
"True, how should you! Well, I will tell&#xD;
you; for I want to make my intention clear to&#xD;
all whom it may concern, and you are one of&#xD;
those whom it does concern. I have come back&#xD;
to bury myself."&#xD;
" Pauline 1"&#xD;
"Is there any thing~ strange in that?" said&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon, with another faint, flitting smile.&#xD;
*   "Women have done such things before-the&#xD;
nuns of whom we spoke, for instance."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley did not answer. She gazed&#xD;
at her cousin with blank amazement, and yet&#xD;
re blank apprehension, which might in time&#xD;
have found expression, if the door had not been&#xD;
suddenly burst open, and a boy of eight or nine&#xD;
years old-a magnificent incarnation of blooming&#xD;
health and beauty-rushed into the room, ex-&#xD;
claiming, "Mamma!" and did not pause until&#xD;
he stood by his mother's side, staring with un-&#xD;
abashed eyes at the elegant stranger.&#xD;
"Oh, what a handsome child!" cried Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley, surprised for once into an enthusiastic&#xD;
~     truth. "Pauline, is this your boy?  How like&#xD;
youhe is! and yet, howunlike!"&#xD;
"He is not like me at all," Mrs. Gordon an-&#xD;
swered, in a hard voice. Then it softened sud-&#xD;
ly, as she turned to the child. "Felix, go&#xD;
and speak to that lady; sbe is your cousin."&#xD;
Felix did as he was told-extending a hand&#xD;
no means v~ry clean, but given with the grace&#xD;
of' a young pri~ice.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, my cousin," he said,&#xD;
f~     quite loftily.&#xD;
And, while ~Mrs. Annesley surreptitiously&#xD;
wiped her fingers on her handkerchief, she&#xD;
turned again to her companion:&#xD;
"What charming manners he has! If he&#xD;
does not ~escmble your~elf~-and I can see now&#xD;
that he does not-I suppose he looks like his&#xD;
2     father."&#xD;
"Yes," was the brief reply.&#xD;
"Poor child! How young to be fatherless!&#xD;
I presume he cannot even remember-Mr. Gor-&#xD;
"Yes, he remembers hin," said Mrs. Gordon,&#xD;
&#xD;
quietly.-" Felix, go and ask Harrison if he did&#xD;
not hear the bell."&#xD;
"He heard it, mamma," said Felix, prompt-&#xD;
ly. "He's, cutting the cake; and I came to ask&#xD;
you if I rnayn't have some wine-he won't give&#xD;
me any.&#xD;
"Certainly not. You can have cake-not&#xD;
wine.&#xD;
"I don't care about cake, mamma."&#xD;
"There is no necessity for you to eat it,&#xD;
then7 my dear. But we shall see if your resolu-&#xD;
tion lasts when it comes-and here it is."&#xD;
As she spoke, Harrison made his ~appear-&#xD;
ance, bearing a salver on which were set forth&#xD;
the orthodox cake and wine of country hospital-&#xD;
ity-the former in rich silver baskets, and the&#xD;
latter in slender, old-fashioned wine-glasses.&#xD;
While Mrs. Annesley refreshed herself with a&#xD;
glass of the golden sherry that had been mel-&#xD;
lowing in the cellars of Morton House for forty&#xD;
years, exchanging with her cousin a few matter-&#xD;
of-course remarks about the weather, expatiat-&#xD;
ing on the beauty of the child, who was still&#xD;
present, and even upon the becoming costume&#xD;
he wore, she was revolving in her mind the&#xD;
altered aspect which the last few minutes bad&#xD;
given to the hopes she had so long and so san-&#xD;
guinely entertained.&#xD;
How easy it is to arrange mentally a supposi-&#xD;
titious scene and conversation! But when was&#xD;
such scene or conversation ever enacted as ar-&#xD;
ranged? From the moment in which she heard&#xD;
of her cousin's return, Mrs. Annesley's busy&#xD;
fancy had been going over and over again a re-&#xD;
hearsal of the present interview; and each time&#xD;
she had acquitted herself to her own entire satis~&#xD;
faction. She had spoken-suavely patronizing,&#xD;
but uncompromising in her demands; her 'cousin&#xD;
had answered-gratefully submissive. Not a&#xD;
shade of doubt or distrust of' her own powers&#xD;
had crossed her mind; she had believed herself&#xD;
to be absolute mistress of the situation. And,&#xD;
alas! the very first tone of ,her cousins voice,&#xD;
and glance at her cousin's fn~-changed. so in-&#xD;
conceivably though that ftce was-showed her&#xD;
the mistake she had made, the self-delusion with&#xD;
which she had been pleasing herself. Memory&#xD;
had played her false-memory, and the vanity&#xD;
that had been fostered by years of uncheckered&#xD;
prosperity. At the first glance, she recognized&#xD;
the fact that the Pauline with whom she had&#xD;
been holding her imaginary conversations was&#xD;
but a la~-flgure, an automaton of her own crea-&#xD;
tion, which' had moved, breathed, trembled, yield-&#xD;
ed, as her own inclination pulled the wires upon&#xD;
&#xD;

24                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                          AFTER TWENTY YEARS.                     25&#xD;
&#xD;
which she had suspended it. The Pauline be-&#xD;
fore her-.ah! how could she have forgotten that&#xD;
haughty nature so strangely as to dream of gain-&#xD;
ing a moment's ascendency over it? She felt&#xD;
that she was defeatednven before she had struck&#xD;
one bldw in furtherance of her "plan." This&#xD;
resolution of retirement from the world-why, it&#xD;
destroyed every vestige, even to the very founda-&#xD;
tions, of the fabric she had so remorselessly&#xD;
reared! The old, bitter hate and envy-the old,&#xD;
ptill more rankling sense of impotence to harm,&#xD;
even to' move, this woman, who had always&#xD;
seemed so unconscious, if not contemptuous, of&#xD;
her enmity-rushed over her soul in a tide of&#xD;
almost suffocating passion. Baffled..-.defeated-&#xD;
now, as ever' before! She could have gnashed&#xD;
her teeth ia fury I Baffled-just when she&#xD;
thought success certain! And must she sub-&#xD;
mit unresistingl~? Might she not sting, wound,&#xD;
If she could not subdue, this proud nature? She&#xD;
would see.&#xD;
." Felix, my dear, you make too much noise.&#xD;
Go to Babette, now," said Mrs. Garden, as the&#xD;
boy began a romp with the little spaniel which&#xD;
had followed him into the room. "Go!"&#xD;
"Yes, mamma." And he obediently departed.&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley cleared her throat nervously,&#xD;
rose, and set down the wine-glass from which she&#xD;
had been sipping, and,, returning to her chair,&#xD;
drew it a little nearer to her cousin's before she&#xD;
again seated herself. Then, laying her hand on&#xD;
the sleeve of the close black dress, she said, con-&#xD;
fidnutially:&#xD;
"My dear Pauline, you quite took away my&#xD;
breath by what you said just now. I am glad&#xD;
you sent the child out, so that we can talk freely.&#xD;
Surely, you do not mean that you intend re-&#xD;
siouneing society altogether?"&#xD;
."That is what I mean."&#xD;
"Impossible! impossible!" cried Mrs. An.&#xD;
uiesley, assuming an expression of grave reman.&#xD;
stance. '"Why, what would the world say 1'"&#xD;
"The world of Lagrange, do you mean?"&#xD;
"Yes. Your own old friends, and those of&#xD;
your parents."&#xD;
"If the subject interests them sufficiently&#xD;
for them to say any thing, I suppose it will be&#xD;
some of the good-natured things which they&#xD;
used to say of me in the old times. But what&#xD;
does it matter?"&#xD;
"It matters every thing !.-if you do not wish&#xD;
to lose, your reputation."&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon regarded her cousin's face for an&#xD;
instant in astonishment. Then her brows con-&#xD;
tracted slightly, and a haughty light came into&#xD;
&#xD;
her eyes. "My reputation!" she repeated.&#xD;
"And pray, Elinor, will you tell, inc what pos.&#xD;
sible connection there is, or can be made, be-&#xD;
tween my voluntary seclusion and the loss of my&#xD;
reputation?"&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley paused a moment, partly be-&#xD;
cause she was a little doubtful as to what her next&#xD;
words should be-partly with an affectation of re-&#xD;
luctance to speak. She looked down at the carpet,&#xD;
thoughtfully-then lifted her eyes to her cousin s&#xD;
countenance, hoping to find there signs of alarm&#xD;
and perturbation. She was disappointed. Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon was waiting quietly for her to proceed.&#xD;
"Your question places mc in a very embar-&#xD;
rassing, a very painful position, Pauline," she&#xD;
began, with well-acted hesitation. "But-I&#xD;
think you will agree with inc that plain speaking&#xD;
is always best; particularly in a case of this&#xD;
kind, and between friends and relatives."&#xD;
"Undoubtedly. Plain speaking is always&#xD;
best between people who have a right to speak&#xD;
plainly to each other; and friends and relatives&#xD;
do possess this right," answered Mrs. Gordon,&#xD;
with the dignified simplicity of manner which,&#xD;
to her cousin's elaborate mannerism of dignity,&#xD;
seemed, as it always had seemed, like virgin&#xD;
gold to pinchbeck.&#xD;
Mrs. Anaesley cleared her throat again, and,&#xD;
lifting the top of her vinaigrette, bent her head&#xD;
and inhaled the salts before she replied, slowly~&#xD;
"My dear Pauflne, I do not know whether&#xD;
you are aware that, to the eyes of the world,&#xD;
your life is veiled in profound mystery; that,&#xD;
until your return, your friends were ignorant of&#xD;
th~ veryname of the man you married; that,&#xD;
even now, the name itself is all that is known.&#xD;
Under these circumstances, is it much to be&#xD;
wondered at that some very unpleasant reports&#xD;
have crept into circulation ?-rcports which you&#xD;
would be shocked to hear, my dear, I assure&#xD;
you! And, if you take this strange step. of&#xD;
secluding yourself from the world, I cannot&#xD;
answer for the consequences."&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon had listened unmoved to her&#xD;
cousin s words, until Mrs. Annesley came to the&#xD;
last sentence. She smiled then-not scornfully,&#xD;
but with a sort of half-sad amusement.&#xD;
"Human nature i~the same all the world&#xD;
/&#xD;
over!" she said. "In the little stagnant pool,&#xD;
as in the great ocean of life, impertinent curios.&#xD;
ity and gratuitous ill-nature arc the most marked&#xD;
features of ' society.' But, my dear Elinor, I am&#xD;
surprised that you should have forgotten all&#xD;
about my character so entirely as to imagine~*&#xD;
that the 'opinion of the world' could move mc,&#xD;
&#xD;
or give me a moment's uneasiness. Don't you&#xD;
remember how I used to shock you with my dis-&#xD;
regard for the ideas and dicta of this narrow&#xD;
world around us? And do you think it likely&#xD;
that a cosmopolitan life of twenty years has&#xD;
taught me to rate its importance more highly?"&#xD;
"Good Heavens, Pauline! You do not know,&#xD;
you do not realize what you are disregarding !-&#xD;
what the reports are-" began Mrs. Annesley,&#xD;
with a consternation which was perfectly genu-&#xD;
ine-for more and more did she realize that her&#xD;
anticipated power over her cousin had been a&#xD;
chimera of self-flattery. But Mrs. Gordon inter-&#xD;
posed, quietly:&#xD;
"I have no more curiosity now than formerly&#xD;
about Lagrange gossip. If it amuses people to&#xD;
t~lk about me, I have no objection to their en-&#xD;
joying that gratification."&#xD;
"But, surely, you object to setting a stain on&#xD;
your good name I-on the Morton honor!" cried&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley, driven beyond all self-control by&#xD;
the careless indifference with which the other&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon's lip curled in a disdain so con-&#xD;
temptuous that her cousin shrank abashed with&#xD;
that consciousness of utter discomfiture in all&#xD;
endeavor to annoy, which had been so familiar&#xD;
and so galling to her in the old days, while the&#xD;
former said, sternly:&#xD;
"I have returned to my old home, soul-weary&#xD;
and grief-stricken-to seek the shelter of my&#xD;
father's roof as people sometimes quit the&#xD;
world for a cloister. You tell me that the' old&#xD;
friends' of my parents and myself are bandying&#xD;
about 'reports' conccrning'me; that they 'know&#xD;
nothing of my life,' and yet are slandering it!&#xD;
Well, I answer that their gossip and slander are&#xD;
less to me than the hum of the insects around&#xD;
him to the anchorite of the desert; that, for the&#xD;
people who disseminate or believe slanders so&#xD;
false, so malicious, so unprovoked-.who dare to&#xD;
suspect my father's daughter of any act unworthy&#xD;
of his name and honor-I entertain a contempt&#xD;
too profound for it to be any thing but passive."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley was effectually silenced; but&#xD;
her countenance showed so plainly the dismay,&#xD;
mortification, and chagrin, by which she was lit-&#xD;
erally overwhelmed, that Mrs. Gordon, reading&#xD;
the expression (though not, of course, its cause),&#xD;
and attributing it to a fear of being personally&#xD;
compromised, said gravely, but kindly:&#xD;
"I know, my dear Elinor, that your ideas&#xD;
and mine do not agree as to the value of the&#xD;
world'~ opinion. And, if you fear that, you may&#xD;
yourself incur the censure of this opinion-"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Pauline, how can you wrong me by imagin-&#xD;
ing that I am thinking of myself in the matter!&#xD;
It was alarm for you which, ill as I felt this morn-&#xD;
ing, urged me to the exertion of showing the&#xD;
world at once my position toward you-my esti-&#xD;
mate of the reports that are in circulation-by&#xD;
coming to offer you the support and advice of a&#xD;
kinswoman."&#xD;
A smile of irrepressible amusement swept&#xD;
over Mrs. Gordon's face, brightening it into a&#xD;
stronger likeness to its former self than Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley could have believed it possible it would&#xD;
ever again wear. "And have these good people&#xD;
of Lagrange really proceeded so far in their amia-&#xD;
ble canvassing of my affairs, that you thought it&#xD;
necessary to extend a hand to save me?" she&#xD;
said, with almost a laugh. "I am afraid they&#xD;
would be disappointed, if they knew how much&#xD;
unnecessary trouble they have given themselves.&#xD;
My first order to Harrison, on my arrival, was,&#xD;
that no one but yourself; your children, and one&#xD;
or two of my oldest and dearest friends, were to&#xD;
be admitted. To all others he was to say tat,&#xD;
being in deep mourning, and in deep grief-"&#xD;
her lip quivered with anguish as she spoke the&#xD;
last words-" I must decline society. You see,&#xD;
therefore, that it was premature, to say the least,&#xD;
in the social authorities of Lagrange, to . decree&#xD;
ostracism to one who, for reasons entirely apart&#xD;
from any consideration of their existence, had no&#xD;
intention of accepting, far less of asking, their&#xD;
suffrage. It was kind of you, ~ she added,&#xD;
with a perfect good faith that made Mrs., Annes-&#xD;
icy wince, "to wish to throw yourself into the&#xD;
breach in my defence."&#xD;
"It was useless, I perceive," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Anneslcy, endeavoring to regain her usual man-&#xD;
ner, "if you persist in this strange resolution you&#xD;
have expressed. Nothing, which I could say or&#xD;
do would have any effect in righting the public&#xD;
sentiment, so long as you maintain the mystery&#xD;
which was the cause of these dreadful reports.&#xD;
If you would only authorize me to contradict&#xD;
them-to-"&#xD;
"Excuse me," interposed Mrs. Gordon, quiet-&#xD;
ly. "It is a matter of perfect indifference to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"But for my sake!" urged Mrs. Ann~sley,&#xD;
who remembered well that she had many a time&#xD;
gained concessions from Pauline's generosity,&#xD;
which Pauline's pride would never have made-&#xD;
"for my sake, Pauline! Think what an* embar.&#xD;
raising position I am placed in. Pray, recon-&#xD;
sider your rcsolutioii 1"&#xD;
"My dear Elinor, I cannot do that," answered&#xD;
&#xD;

26                       MORTON HOUSE.                                                          WHAT MORTON SAID.                     27&#xD;
&#xD;
her cousin. "I came here, as I told you, to seek&#xD;
rest. I married very unhappily, and have suf-&#xD;
fered much-have suffered so terribly that, but&#xD;
for the sake of my child, I think I could not have&#xD;
lived through all 1 have endured. This explana-&#xD;
tion I make to yourself-not for the benefit of&#xD;
the gossips who, it seems, are busying them-&#xD;
selves with my name. Yourself, and the few old&#xD;
friends who, I think, have a right to that con-&#xD;
sideration from me, shall be always welcome&#xD;
here, if-" she smiled-" you and they are not&#xD;
afraid to brave public opinion by ~omin~"&#xD;
"You do me injustice by the doubt you im-&#xD;
ply," said Mrs. Annesley, quickly. "But, for&#xD;
that matter, you always did me injustice."&#xD;
"Did I?" said her cousin, with a softer light&#xD;
coming into her eyes, and a softer tone into her&#xD;
voice. "Perhaps I did; for I was very prone to&#xD;
rash judgment in those wilful early days. I&#xD;
sometimes think that all I have endured since&#xD;
has only been a just punishment for the faults I&#xD;
cherished then. I am glad to believe I did you&#xD;
injustice, and to beg your pardon for it. Forgive&#xD;
me; Elinor-and let us be friends."&#xD;
She held out her hand, and Mrs. Annesley&#xD;
could not decline to take it. But she hesitated&#xD;
- a moment before doing so, and paled slightly,&#xD;
as she said:&#xD;
"We won't talk of the past, Pauline, for I&#xD;
dare say the fault of our misunderstandings was&#xD;
as much mine as yours. Tell me about poor,&#xD;
dear Alfred. I was so shocked to hear of his-"&#xD;
"Death," she would have said, had not the&#xD;
sudden ghastly change that came over her cous-&#xD;
in's face stopped the word, It was not the acute&#xD;
grief which cannot bear any mention of its be-&#xD;
reavement from careless lips, but the presence&#xD;
of an unutterable horror, which blanched the&#xD;
cheek, and gave so deep an agony to the eye,&#xD;
that Mrs. Annesley saw she had made a great&#xD;
mistake, and stammered hastily:&#xD;
"Pardon me; I did not mean-~-"&#xD;
Then Mrs. Gordon seemed to rally with an&#xD;
almost convulsive effort; and, after a minute,&#xD;
spoke hoarsely:&#xD;
* "It does not matter. I-I only have not&#xD;
learned to bear the mention of his name. Yes,&#xD;
he is dead. Be kind, Elinor-do not ask me any&#xD;
more."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley could not disregard such a re-&#xD;
quest. She was silent for some time; half from&#xD;
astonishment, half from offended pride at her&#xD;
cousin's reserve. Then she gathered her wrap-&#xD;
pings round her, and rose with that motion&#xD;
which indicates departure.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am sorry I cannot stay longer," she said,&#xD;
"but I dare not risk over-fatiguing myself~ 1&#xD;
will come soon again, however."&#xD;
"Pray do" said Mr~ Gordon, cordially.&#xD;
"Give my love to Morton and Adela. Are they&#xD;
not with you now?"&#xD;
"Morton lives with me, but he is not at home&#xD;
just now. He has been absent for a week or&#xD;
two. Adela is married, and lives in Mobile,".&#xD;
replied Mrs Annesley, telling the truth-but&#xD;
not the whole truth. "Do you remember your&#xD;
old admirer, Colonel French? Well, one of his&#xD;
sons died, and Adela married the other-a very&#xD;
good match indeed."&#xD;
"Colonel French-the wealthy widower, as&#xD;
you used to call him? How strangely such&#xD;
news makes me feel. To think that Adela&#xD;
should be married-and to one of those little&#xD;
boys!"&#xD;
"I ought to feel old, ought I not? And&#xD;
yet-"&#xD;
"And yet you feel young, looking at me. Is&#xD;
it not so?"&#xD;
"I did not mean to say that, I assure you;&#xD;
but you do look shockingly. I hope you will&#xD;
seem more like yourself when I see you again.&#xD;
Good-by. I cannot tempt you even to Annes-&#xD;
dale?"&#xD;
"Not even to Annesdale."&#xD;
They shook hands, parted-if any thing more&#xD;
coldly than they had met-and, ten minutes after.&#xD;
ward, the Annesley carriage was rolling out of&#xD;
the Morton gates.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
WHAT MORTON SAiD.&#xD;
"Jr is a good thing that Morton is not at&#xD;
home," Mrs. Annesley had again remarked to&#xD;
her daughter, when she finally made up her&#xD;
mind to action in the case of her cousin; and&#xD;
the event well justified that self-congratulation.&#xD;
A fortnight after the visit in which she had been&#xD;
so signally worsted, Morton returned, and, for&#xD;
the first time in his life, asserted his right of&#xD;
interference as head of the house.&#xD;
"Mother," he said, when they were at break&#xD;
fast on the morning after his arrival, and the ser-&#xD;
vants had left the room-" Mother, is it true, as&#xD;
I hear, that our cousin, Pauline Morton, has re-&#xD;
turned among us?"&#xD;
There was something unusually grave and&#xD;
formal in the tone of this inquiry, something&#xD;
&#xD;
which made AdelaFrench look up and open her&#xD;
eyes; but Mrs. Annesley answered with admira-&#xD;
ble nonchalance -&#xD;
es, my dear boy, she has really returned.&#xD;
I forgot that we heard the news the very day you&#xD;
left. How it must have astonished you! It&#xD;
was quite a shock to me; but say nerves are&#xD;
so easily afl'eeted I can stand very little. I sup-&#xD;
pose you heard it in Tallahoma, as you came&#xD;
through?"&#xD;
"Yes, I heard it in Tallahoma," the young&#xD;
man answered, "and, mother, I also heard some-&#xD;
thing else, which cannot be true."&#xD;
"It is a very sad affair altogether, my dear&#xD;
Morton," said Mrs. Annesley, quietly; "but&#xD;
there is nothing more likely than that you heard.&#xD;
some exaggeration of the matter. What was&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
She asked the question with honest indiffer-&#xD;
ence, for, since her visit to Mrs. Gordon, she had&#xD;
felt, so far as herself was concerned, upon safe&#xD;
ground. She knew that she had always been to&#xD;
Morton a sort of enthroned divinity, who could&#xD;
do no wrong; and it was evident that he hesi-&#xD;
tated now before saying any thing which might&#xD;
seem even the mildest censure on her conduct.&#xD;
At last, however, he spoke.&#xD;
"I heard in Tallahoma that our cousin "-he&#xD;
uttere&amp;amp; ~he last two words with emphasis-" has&#xD;
come back to her old home, without having re-&#xD;
ceived any welcome from her old friends; and&#xD;
that even you, mother, have failed to give her&#xD;
one."&#xD;
"I should think you would know by this time&#xD;
how much reliance is to be placed in Tallahoma&#xD;
gossip," said Mrs. Anneslcy. "As usual they&#xD;
have told you something entirely without foun-&#xD;
dation; and "-with gentle reproach-" I cannot&#xD;
help thinking it strange that you should credit&#xD;
such a thing of me."&#xD;
"I did not credit it!" said the young man,&#xD;
eagerly. "I was only afraid that it might be so,&#xD;
because public opinion seems dealing so hardly&#xD;
with this poor woman. And you kare been to&#xD;
see her, then?"&#xD;
"Of course I have," answered she, promptly.&#xD;
"How could I possibly neglect such a duty?&#xD;
We were raised together as sisters, you remem-&#xD;
ber."&#xD;
"And has she been here? Mother, she&#xD;
ought to be here now."&#xD;
"Morton !-what do you mean?"&#xD;
"1 mean," answered Morton, quickly, "that&#xD;
when a woman is slandered is the time, of all&#xD;
others, for her kindred to close around her; and&#xD;
&#xD;
that Pauline Morton's proper place now is under&#xD;
this roof."&#xD;
"But, good Heavens! why?"&#xD;
"Why?" he repeated in surprise. "Dear&#xD;
mother, don't you know why? Don't you know&#xD;
that she is doubted, suspected, slandered, if you&#xD;
will have a plain word; and that it is only thus&#xD;
we can pay the debt of gratitude we owe to those&#xD;
whose roof once sheltered you ?"&#xD;
He looked like a young paladin, with the&#xD;
kindling fire on his handsome face, and the shin.&#xD;
ing light in his dark eyes; and even his mother's&#xD;
heart was touched as he lowered his voice over&#xD;
the last words.&#xD;
"My son, you do not understand," she said,&#xD;
in a grave, troubled voice-for it was never her&#xD;
policy to conic to an issue with Morton," you do&#xD;
not understand-and you should trust to me in&#xD;
this matter."&#xD;
"You know how much I trust to you," he&#xD;
answered. "But in this matter-"&#xD;
"Why do you think it necessary to take up&#xD;
your cousin's cause with so much zeal?" said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley, as he hesitated in his sentence.&#xD;
"I thought I ~aad already explained what&#xD;
really does not seem to require any explanation.&#xD;
Seeing any woman in a position of social difficul-&#xD;
ty, I should not feel myself a gentleman if, be-&#xD;
lieving her injured, I did not make at least an&#xD;
effort in her defence. And when I see my own&#xD;
kinswoman, one to whom I am bound both by&#xD;
ties of blood and obligations of gratitude-&#xD;
mother, can you ask me why I should take up&#xD;
her cause with all the zeal of which I am capa-&#xD;
ble?"&#xD;
"One word, Morton," said Mrs. Annesley, who&#xD;
had been watching him during the last speech,&#xD;
and knew to a nicety how far it was prudent to&#xD;
carry open opposition-" one word, if you please.&#xD;
Has it never occurred to you that Pauline Mor-&#xD;
ton may not be the injured victim you seem to&#xD;
consider her?"&#xD;
If she had sent a rifle-shot into her son's&#xD;
plate, she could not have taken him more com-&#xD;
pletely by surprise. He looked for one moment&#xD;
in mute amazement at her face, then a crimson&#xD;
flood shot over his brow, and was visible even&#xD;
beneath the black curls that rested on it.&#xD;
"Mother!"&#xD;
"Don't misunderstand me," said Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
Icy, quietly. "Don't think that I mean any thing&#xD;
more than I say. I only repeat my question-&#xD;
has it never occurred to you that Pauline Mor-&#xD;
ton may not be that injured victim which you&#xD;
seem to consider ~&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8070-00000018"/>&#xD;
28                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                            WHAT MORTON SAID.                      29&#xD;
&#xD;
"No," answered he. "Is she not a Mor-&#xD;
ton?"&#xD;
"She is, indeed. But, in short, asltold you&#xD;
before, you had better trust to me in this mat-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
"And, as I told you before, that is impossi-&#xD;
ble," he replied. "Tell me what you meant by&#xD;
such a question."&#xD;
But, what Mrs. Annesley meant, it was very&#xD;
hard-indeed, impossible-for her to explain in&#xD;
Morton's. straightforward fashion; for her only&#xD;
real meaning had been to impress him with a&#xD;
belief that the matter was too delicate for his&#xD;
management. She hesitated before answering;&#xD;
and then said more than she had perhaps in.&#xD;
tended to say.&#xD;
"I only meant, Morton, that I am sure you&#xD;
would not like to force me into giving counte-&#xD;
nance to a woman who may not deserve it."&#xD;
"God forbid I" said Morton, hastily. "But,&#xD;
mother, surely you consider what you arc say-&#xD;
ing?"&#xD;
"Is it likely I would not consider?" asked&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley, dreadfully conscious that the exi-&#xD;
gence of the occasion was forcing her into doing&#xD;
just the opposite. But then it was so necessary&#xD;
to quiet Morton by saying something.-" Is it&#xD;
likely I would not consider? Ah, you don't&#xD;
know hew I have suffered about this, or you&#xD;
would never reproach me for not doing more."&#xD;
"Reproach you I My dear mother, I must&#xD;
have expressed myself very badly if you think I&#xD;
meant to reproach you. Pray forgive me, if I&#xD;
have been hasty or disrespectful-but I feel this&#xD;
matter so deeply."&#xD;
"You cannot feel it more deeply than I do,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Annesley, putting her handkerchief to&#xD;
her eyes. "My poor aunt, and my dear uncle,&#xD;
what a blessed thing it is that they did not live&#xD;
to see this day! You may think me unfeeling,&#xD;
Morton, but Adela there could tell you that I&#xD;
have been really ill, and about nothing else but&#xD;
this affair."&#xD;
"I could as soon suspect a saint of being un-&#xD;
feeling," said Morton, much concerned, but smil-&#xD;
ing a little.&#xD;
"Selfish, then, when I had only your welfare&#xD;
at heart."&#xD;
"You could not be selfish if you tried. But&#xD;
I really don't see what my welfare had to do&#xD;
with the matter."&#xD;
No, he did not see in the least, and, what was&#xD;
more~ Mrs. Annesley dared not enlighten him.&#xD;
She knew how much he desired to own Morton&#xD;
House, but she also knew that Morton House&#xD;
&#xD;
would be worse than valueless to him if he once&#xD;
suspected that it had been won by such means&#xD;
as those she had not scrupled to propose to her-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
"I only mean," she hastily corrected, "that&#xD;
neither you nor I can h~lp a woman who is so&#xD;
utterly reckless that she will not help herself."&#xD;
"And Pauline Morton?"&#xD;
"Pauline Morton refuses absolutely to accept&#xD;
any aid that we can give her."&#xD;
"Refuses! How? Pray be more explicit, if&#xD;
only in consideration of my stupidity."&#xD;
"I don't see how I can be moreexplicit, Mor-&#xD;
ton. She distinctly declines to give any explana-&#xD;
tion of her singular appearance among us, of the&#xD;
death of her brother, or of the absence of her&#xD;
husband-indeed, whether he is alive or dead,&#xD;
nobody knows. She looks as if she might have&#xD;
walked through a furnace of fire, or been buried&#xD;
alive and dug up again, or lived in garrets on&#xD;
crusts of bread, or-or done any thing! And&#xD;
she will neither receive her friends nor accept&#xD;
any hospitality they offer."&#xD;
Morton, who had risen from the table, was&#xD;
now standing with one hand on the back of his&#xD;
chair, and he did not speak for several minutes.&#xD;
Then he said, slowly:&#xD;
"Well, all this only proves that she has suf-&#xD;
fered, nothing more. Surely we may respect this&#xD;
suffering sufficiently to refrain from prying into&#xD;
it. Can the gossips say nothing more of her&#xD;
than this?"&#xD;
"You can best answer that question," said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley, stiffly. "I am not likely to hear&#xD;
what gossips say of my own cousin. But I think&#xD;
it is more than ought to be said of anywoman."&#xD;
"Mother, that does not sound like you,"&#xD;
said her son, gently. "Remember how often&#xD;
you have agreed with me that misfortune should&#xD;
never be confounded with fault. We have no&#xD;
right to suspect more than misfortune here."&#xD;
"Not if Pauline had come back as her posi-&#xD;
tion demanded she should come-with some guar-&#xD;
antee for her past, and some regard for appear-&#xD;
ances in the present.. Not if she-"&#xD;
"In one word, if she had not needed your&#xD;
friendship. Oh, mother, that I should hear such&#xD;
social cant from yourj~,s! Her old associates,&#xD;
then, would have been willing to extend their&#xD;
hands to her, if she had not needed them; as&#xD;
she does need them, they consider that a suf-&#xD;
ficient reason for holding aloof. What a pitiful&#xD;
world it is!" said the young man, with a sudden&#xD;
scorn flashing into his face; "and how much It&#xD;
is alike in every place and condition o~ life!&#xD;
&#xD;
Aj&#xD;
&#xD;
Mother, one more question, and I have done.&#xD;
I am sure I need not beg you to answer me&#xD;
frankly. Do you, or do you not, believe that&#xD;
I;&#xD;
Pauline Morton deserves the suspicion that&#xD;
seems to have fallen upon her?"&#xD;
Was ever diplomacy placed in a more trying&#xD;
position than this? Reply in the affirmative&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley could not, without a more daring&#xD;
violation of truth than even her conscience&#xD;
would allow; and, to answer in the negative,&#xD;
would be to undo all her previous work. Clear-&#xD;
ly, then, the only resource left was that of eva-&#xD;
sion, and this she employed with commendable&#xD;
quickness.&#xD;
"Good leavens, Morton! How can you ask&#xD;
inc to decide such a question, and about my own&#xD;
cousin, too? You should be more considerate&#xD;
of my-my feelings I"&#xD;
"I am asking you to be considerate of the&#xD;
honor of your name, mother," said Morton, half-&#xD;
sternly. "Do you know what people will say if&#xD;
you do not face that question and answer it bold.&#xD;
"I must consult my own conscience, and not&#xD;
what people will say," answered she, with dig.&#xD;
nity.&#xD;
Morton took his hand from the chair, and&#xD;
made a quick turn up and down the room before&#xD;
he spoke again. He stopped abruptly then, and&#xD;
fastened his eyes on her face:&#xD;
'Thea, mother, you, too, doubt this poor&#xD;
woman?"&#xD;
"Doubt her?" She hesitated a moment, but,&#xD;
saw her way to no othcr answer than the truth.&#xD;
"No, Morton, I do not."&#xD;
"In that case, you consider her unjustly sus-&#xD;
pected-do you, mother?"&#xD;
There ~vas something truth-compelling in the&#xD;
direct question, in the earnest eyes, and still more&#xD;
earnest voice. Before Mrs. Annesley knew what&#xD;
she was about, she had uttered a reluctant&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
But, even after this, she was not prepared for&#xD;
what followed. She was a~tonishcd when Mor-&#xD;
ton crossed the floor, rang the bell, and said to&#xD;
the servant who answered it:&#xD;
'The carriage."&#xD;
The door had hardly closed before Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley cried:&#xD;
'Morton, what does this mean?"&#xD;
'It means," said Morton, "that I am going&#xD;
cc our cousin, and that I hope you will ac-&#xD;
pany me to urge her return with us to An.&#xD;
nesdale."&#xD;
His mother looked at him in silent exaspera-&#xD;
4                 3&#xD;
&#xD;
tion. If she had given way to her first impulse,&#xD;
it would certainly have been one of fierce re-&#xD;
proach, since anger was burning hotly enough in&#xD;
her heart against this ungrateful return for all&#xD;
her exertion. But one thing which she had&#xD;
learned in life was the folly of paSsion. So she&#xD;
curbed herself with the steady curb which long&#xD;
habit had rendered easy, and answered quietly:&#xD;
"I am afraid you must excuse me. Dr. Rey-&#xD;
nolds expressly forbade my leaving the house&#xD;
until he saw me again. Besides, Morton, since&#xD;
you absolutely refuse to be guided by me in this&#xD;
matter, I cannot think that I am called upon to&#xD;
expose myself to another repulse for your sake."&#xD;
"Another repulse :~"&#xD;
"Yes, another repulse. I thought I told you&#xD;
that Pauline has already declined the visit which&#xD;
you wish me to urge on her a second time."&#xD;
"Did you really urge it the first time, moth.&#xD;
er?"&#xD;
"Did you ever know me lacking in hospital-&#xD;
ity? But, since you distrust me, go your own&#xD;
way, and find who is right."&#xD;
She spoke gravely, but without any touch of&#xD;
pettishness; and Morton hesitated. Perhaps,&#xD;
after all, she was right-perhaps, after all, he&#xD;
was wrong. Who was so likely to be wrong as&#xD;
himself, thought the young man, with the humil-&#xD;
ity which was his most prominent characteristic.&#xD;
Surely his mother was better able to judge of her&#xD;
cousin than he who had never seen that cousin.&#xD;
In trying to act up to the standard of his chivalric&#xD;
creed, he began to fear that he had not only been&#xD;
very obstinate, but also very foolish. So, after a&#xD;
pause, he spoke quite humbly:&#xD;
"I have never done such a~thing as distrust&#xD;
you in all my life, mother; and I am sure I have&#xD;
no desire to go my own way pimply because it is&#xD;
my own way. If you think the invitation had&#xD;
better not be given just at present, I am perfect-&#xD;
ly willing to defer it. But that is noreason for&#xD;
deferring my visit. Since you Cannot accompany&#xD;
me, I am sure Adela will."&#xD;
He looked at his sister as he spoke; and&#xD;
Mrs. French shrugged her shoulders, as she an-&#xD;
swered carelessly:&#xD;
"Indeed, I would not advise you to be too&#xD;
sure, Morton, for I have not an idea of doing any&#xD;
thing of the kind."&#xD;
"Why not?"&#xD;
"Simply because I don't choose to."&#xD;
"Adela 1" This was Mrs. Annesicy who&#xD;
broke in with a tone half-warning, half-reproach-&#xD;
ful.&#xD;
"Well, mamma," w~is the saucy reply, "you&#xD;

&#xD;
HOW A PALADIN STORMED A CASTLE.                31&#xD;
&#xD;
surely don't think I am going to let Morton tyr-&#xD;
annize over me as he does over you? When one&#xD;
doesn't mind one's husband, one isn't likely to&#xD;
mind one's brother-do you think so? He must&#xD;
get him a wife, if he wants somebody to go with&#xD;
him whenever he takes a fancy to visit super-&#xD;
annuated beauties."&#xD;
"I did not ask you to go as a favor to my-&#xD;
self; Adela," said her brother, a little haughtily.&#xD;
"So much the better," answered she. And,&#xD;
at that moment, a servant opened the door and&#xD;
announced the carriage.&#xD;
"I was wrong," said Morton, turning to her.&#xD;
"I do ask it as a favor to myself. Will you&#xD;
go?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not on any account," said the young lady,&#xD;
with emphasis. "Nothing would induce me to&#xD;
go. I hate disagreeable people-besides, the&#xD;
Raynors and Irene Vernon will be here to din-&#xD;
ner to-day, and I would not tire myself out for&#xD;
the world. Ifyou will go, that is no reason.why&#xD;
1 should be so silly."&#xD;
U Have the car taken back, and my horse&#xD;
brought out," said Mr. Annesley to the servant.&#xD;
After this, there was ten minutes' rather un-&#xD;
comfortable silence in the room. It was broken&#xD;
at last by Adela, who had sauntered to the win-&#xD;
dow, and, with admirable nonchalance, announced&#xD;
the appearance of the hors~adding the gratui-&#xD;
tous information that he did not look quite as&#xD;
well groomed as usual.&#xD;
"Probably not; those scamps grow careless&#xD;
if I am~away from home a week," said her broth.&#xD;
er. He turned to leave the room, saying to his&#xD;
mother, "1 shalL not be back until dinner."&#xD;
"But you must be back in iime for dinner-&#xD;
don't forget that, Morton," she said, anxiously.&#xD;
~ shall not forget it," he answered.&#xD;
When the door closed on him1 Mrs. Annesley&#xD;
drew a deep breath of relief; and looked at her&#xD;
daughter, who was still standing by the window.&#xD;
Their eyes met, and Mrs. French laughed.&#xD;
"?oor Morton, how simple he is 1" she said&#xD;
"I wondered you had patience to fence with him&#xD;
so long, mamma. Do you think he means to&#xD;
spend the morning at Morton House?"&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley shook her head. "I wish he&#xD;
did," she answered. "He means to spend it in&#xD;
Tallahoma.&#xD;
"Mamma," said Mrs. French, setting her teeth I&#xD;
sharply, "I would make an end of that business,&#xD;
if I were you."&#xD;
"Suppose you could not, Adela?"&#xD;
"As if you could not always do any thing you&#xD;
waat to,"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Morton is terribly obstinate."&#xD;
"Morton is like wax in your hands."&#xD;
There was a moment's silence. Then, not&#xD;
very relevantly, as it seemed, Mrs. Annesley said,&#xD;
"When does Irene Vernon leave'?"&#xD;
"Not before New Year. You know she is en~&#xD;
gaged to spend Christmas here."&#xD;
"Yes, I know."&#xD;
They said nothing further-but, after another&#xD;
minute or two, Mrs. French kissed her hand, and&#xD;
gayly waved it to some one outside the window.&#xD;
"It is only Morton," she said, as her mother&#xD;
came forward and looked over her shoulder. "I&#xD;
am wishing him good luck."&#xD;
They both watched the graceful rider out of&#xD;
sight; and Mrs. Annesley, as she turned away&#xD;
from the window, said, with a low and somewhat&#xD;
bitter laugh, "Let him go. He will not be ad-&#xD;
mitted farther than the door of Morton House."&#xD;

CHAPTER VIr.&#xD;
110W A PALADIN STORMED A CASTLE.&#xD;
In all the sweet South there never was a softer&#xD;
or more beautiful morning-robed in gorgeous&#xD;
autumnal dress, and glorying in a lavish affluence&#xD;
of balmy air, and golden sunshine, and draping&#xD;
haze-than that on which the young owner of&#xD;
Annesdale rode forth to try his fortune at Morton&#xD;
House.&#xD;
Shortly after leaving his own gates, he over-&#xD;
took an open carriage full of ladies, who were&#xD;
chattering gayly, and who burst into a chorus of&#xD;
welcome when llderim's handsome head appeared&#xD;
beside them.&#xD;
"Mr. Apnesley! What a surprise!"&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Annesley, where did you come&#xD;
prom?"&#xD;
"When did you come back, and how are&#xD;
rou?"&#xD;
Only one of the fair bevy-the fairest among&#xD;
hem-said nothing; but she smiled and held&#xD;
ut her hand; and neither the smile nor the&#xD;
etion left any thing to be desired.&#xD;
Mr. Annesley answered all the inquiries, and&#xD;
changed all the civilities of the occasion; and&#xD;
hen rode along by the side of the carriage, rest-&#xD;
i~ one hand lightly on the door, while with the&#xD;
ther he restrained Ilderim's eager impatience;&#xD;
nd the stream of conversation flowed on in easy&#xD;
ad lively current.&#xD;
"You have been to Mobile, Mr. Annesley?"&#xD;
sked the gay young chaperon of the party-&#xD;
&#xD;
pretty Mrs. George Raynor, who had been a Miss&#xD;
Vernon and a Mobile belle before she married,&#xD;
and came to dazzle Lagrange with her beauty and&#xD;
her fashion. "Oh, do tell us something about it,&#xD;
for we are almost dying-irene and I-for news&#xD;
of all our friends."&#xD;
"With all my heart," said Morton, smiling;&#xD;
"but where shall I begin? I was only in Mobile&#xD;
foi a few days, and I scarcely saw any thing of&#xD;
the people you would care to hear about."&#xD;
"Ah, I care to hear about anybody," cried&#xD;
she, with fervor. "And, if you did not see any-&#xD;
body, just tell me what they are talking about in&#xD;
the city. I wish I had known you were going,&#xD;
I would have asked you to take a package to&#xD;
Aunt Lucy-and, perhaps-to bring me a bon-&#xD;
net back."&#xD;
"You are glad she did not know, are you&#xD;
not, Mr. Annesley?" said Miss Vernon, laugh-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
Morton smiled only, in reply to the last ques-&#xD;
tion, preferring, it seemed, to answer Mrs. Ray-&#xD;
nor's remark "If I had not left home so hur-&#xD;
riedly, you should have known," he said. "But&#xD;
I did manage to 'see year aunt, and she charged&#xD;
me with a great many messages to yourself and&#xD;
Miss Vernon-the chief of which," he added,&#xD;
turning to the latter, "I feel tempted not to&#xD;
deliver."&#xD;
"Is it so very disagreeable, then?" asked&#xD;
she.&#xD;
"It will not be at all disagreeable to you, I&#xD;
am afraid; but she urges your speedy return to&#xD;
Mobile, and that will be very disagreeable to&#xD;
Lagrange."&#xD;
"Lagrange will have to support the desola-&#xD;
tion as best it can, and I have no doubt will be&#xD;
able to endure it," said Miss Vernon, a little&#xD;
coolly-thinking, no doubt, that the compliment&#xD;
would have gained point and strength by a more&#xD;
personal application.&#xD;
Then a cry broke from the other two young&#xD;
ladies, who were both Misses Raynor, plain in&#xD;
looks, plain in manners, and therefore blindly&#xD;
admiring the Vernon beauty, and emulous of the&#xD;
Vernon style.&#xD;
"Oh, Irene, you surely will not think of leav-&#xD;
ing us!"&#xD;
"Irene, that is VOV~J mean of your aunt, for&#xD;
she knows you promised to stay until after&#xD;
Christmas."&#xD;
"Nonsense l" said Mrs. Raynor. "Irene&#xD;
knows she is not going until I am ready to go&#xD;
with her; and only George can say when that&#xD;
will be-he is so provoking! Mr. Anuesley, I&#xD;
&#xD;
do hope that when you are married, you will&#xD;
treat your wife with some consideration."&#xD;
"1 shall endeavor to do so, Mrs. Raynor,"&#xD;
answered Morton, with mock-gravity-for all&#xD;
Lagrange knew that George Raynor waS the&#xD;
most thoroughly hen-pecked husband in the&#xD;
county-" I shall come to you for instructions&#xD;
how to act. But you have not told me what has&#xD;
heen going on here since 1 left."&#xD;
Nothing has been going on in any way,~~&#xD;
said Mrs. Ilaynor.-" Irene, what have we been&#xD;
doing ?-any thing at all?"&#xD;
"Vegetating and yawning, I believe," an-&#xD;
swered Miss Vernon. "But these principal&#xD;
occupations have been varied by much gossip,&#xD;
and a little scandal, lately."&#xD;
"Oh, yes l" burst in Mrs. Raynor, with the&#xD;
greatest animation. "Lagrange has been in a&#xD;
perfect ferment of gossip for the last three&#xD;
weeks, Mr. Annesley, about that curious Miss&#xD;
Morton, or Mrs. Gordon, or whatever her name&#xD;
may be, who has come back like a ghost, and&#xD;
set everybody talking themselves hoarse. Qf&#xD;
course you have heard of her?" (She did not&#xD;
give him time to reply.) "For my part, I be-&#xD;
lieve that she murdered both her husband and&#xD;
her brother, and that she has come here to bury&#xD;
her remorse, and give Lagrange a standing topic&#xD;
of conversation. I am sure- Good gracious,&#xD;
Lonisa, what is the matter? Is there a cater-&#xD;
pillar on my bonnet?"&#xD;
The inquiry was not entirely without reason,&#xD;
for the elder Miss Raynor had been making&#xD;
signals of silence and distress for the last five&#xD;
seconds, without being able to at~raet her heed-&#xD;
less sister-in.law's attention.&#xD;
"No, indeed, Flora," she said, blushing with&#xD;
that ever.ready and not always becoming blush&#xD;
of eighteen. "But you surely forget-Mr. An-&#xD;
nesley is related to-"&#xD;
"To my murderess?" cried-Mrs. Raynor, ex-&#xD;
tricating herself from the difficulty with the mer-&#xD;
riest laugh in the world. "A thousand pardons,&#xD;
Mr. Annesley! But you know how heedless I&#xD;
am! I am sure I need not apologize for mere&#xD;
jesting."&#xD;
Mr. Annesley's face had taken an expression&#xD;
which few people had ever seen upon it before.&#xD;
A stern coldness transformed it so entirely that&#xD;
the ladies exchanged glances of surprise and dis-&#xD;
may. He bowed quite haughtily, as he said, with&#xD;
gravity:&#xD;
"Personally, I could not of course be of-&#xD;
fended by what was not meant to touch my-&#xD;
self. But I must confess that my ideas of&#xD;

"I am very, very sorry," cried that lad&#xD;
eagerly, coloring a little, and slightly disco&#xD;
scored by his manner aad words. "You mu&#xD;
really forgive me, Mr. Annesley! I did not r&#xD;
member at the moment your connection wii&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon. Indeed, it never occurred to a&#xD;
that you would care. Adela talks just as ever~&#xD;
body else does."&#xD;
"1 am sorry to hear it," said Mr. Annesle'&#xD;
in the same tone as before.&#xD;
"And, really," continued Mrs. Raynor, rall:&#xD;
ing from her momentary embarrassment, and r~&#xD;
covering her usual nonchalant gayety-" rcall~&#xD;
Mr. Annesley, you are very unreasonable.&#xD;
only repeated what everybody is saying. Pra&#xD;
don't hold me accountable for the reports!"&#xD;
Mr. Annesley's face relaxed into a smile-&#xD;
rather grave, it is true-as he answered: "Yo&#xD;
are right, Mrs. Raynor. It was unreasonabh&#xD;
nay, it was folly in me 'to resent what is in it&#xD;
self. so trifling a matter as these reports. Gos&#xD;
sipsinust have something to talk about, of course&#xD;
It is I who must beg your pardon for having for&#xD;
gotten this."&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Anneslcy, I don't know you!'&#xD;
exclaimed Mrs. Raynor, astonished, annoyed, an~&#xD;
amused, all at once. "I always thought you s&#xD;
model of amiability; but you are not amiable at&#xD;
present, I assure you. I did not know that you&#xD;
had laid lance in rest, in Mrs. Gordon's defence,&#xD;
or I should not have said a word. And, by-the.&#xD;
way, don't flatter yourself that you are her only&#xD;
champion. Irene has been doing battle in her&#xD;
defence from the first."&#xD;
"Have you?" said Morton, turning quickly&#xD;
to Miss Vernon. "I hope you will let me ad-&#xD;
mire and thank you for it."&#xD;
"Pray don't," answered she. "I only heard&#xD;
a woman assailed, and felt for her-that was&#xD;
all."&#xD;
Before the gentleman could reply, Mrs. Ray-&#xD;
nor s light tones broke in again:&#xD;
"I positively victimized myself by going to&#xD;
church last Sunday in order to catch a glimpse&#xD;
of this ghostly lady; and would you believe it,&#xD;
Mr. 4nnesley, she did not come! I wonder if&#xD;
she i~ver means to come? But somebody said&#xD;
that a splendid-looking child, who sat in a pew&#xD;
next the pulpit, was hers."&#xD;
"Oh, yes," chorused the Misses Raynor,&#xD;
"and zucli a woman with him! 1f you could&#xD;
have aeca her bonnet! And, what do you think,&#xD;
Mr. Annesley ?-she actually sat up and said her&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
~y- beads all the time Mr. Norwood was preaching--&#xD;
and that under his very eyes!"&#xD;
ly, "She is evidently a Frenchwoman," said Miss&#xD;
a- Vernon, "and of course a Catholic. No doubt&#xD;
st she took that means to avoid joining in what she&#xD;
'e- considered heretical worship.-Are you going,&#xD;
~h Mr. Annesley?"&#xD;
ic "1 am reluctantly compelled to do so," said&#xD;
y~ Mr. Annesley, who had drawn Ildenim from the&#xD;
carriage.dooi~, and himself from that soft contact&#xD;
y, of silk and lace; that near neighborhood of a&#xD;
slender, well-gloved hand; that faint, dainty fra-&#xD;
~- grace of fresh millinery; that capricious parasol&#xD;
i. fringe which was never still, and which would&#xD;
~, persist in sweeping his face, and that subtle, in-&#xD;
I tangible charm which, like an aroma, seems con-&#xD;
y stantly exhaling from a lovely and well-dressed&#xD;
woman-" I am compelled to do so-for here is&#xD;
- Morton House, a~d to it I am bound. You dine&#xD;
u at Anneadale today? Then you may expect a&#xD;
~, full account of the wonders and mysteries within&#xD;
these gates. Good-morning."&#xD;
He lifted his hat-the ladies bent their heads&#xD;
with a general flutter of plumes and ribbons--&#xD;
the carriage swept on in a yellow cloud of dust,&#xD;
and the young man found himself alone before&#xD;
the gates of Morton House.&#xD;
I Like his mother, he too felt, when those gates&#xD;
closed behind him, as if he had entered an en-&#xD;
chanted domain-a domain over the neglected&#xD;
beauty of which there rested a mournful still.&#xD;
ness, deeper and more pathetic than mere soli-&#xD;
t~ide; where brooded a solemn air of repose,&#xD;
and a subtle power of awaking thought and as-&#xD;
sociation which we have most of us observed in&#xD;
those places where life once ran riot, and from&#xD;
which it has long since departed forever.&#xD;
The young man involuntarily bared his head&#xD;
as he rode slowly along beneath the drooping&#xD;
trees; and patches of golden sunshine, flicker-&#xD;
ing softly down, fell on the rich black curls and&#xD;
the face that was subdued almost to mournful-&#xD;
ness. There was to him an indescribable pathos&#xD;
in the stately quiet around him. He thought of&#xD;
the by-gone voices that had once sounded along&#xD;
this avenue, of the gay hearts that had gone&#xD;
their way brimful of life and joy, and the sad&#xD;
hearts that had found even the beauty of~Kature&#xD;
a weariness and a mockery-well, they were all&#xD;
equally at rest now. He thought of the bright&#xD;
children who had played beneath those trees;&#xD;
and of the fair ladies who had dreamed sweet&#xD;
fancies under their shade, or-who knows ?-.-&#xD;
dropped bitter tears upon their mossy roots.&#xD;
The sod lay het~vily enough over those Jorely&#xD;
&#xD;
HOW A PALADIN STORMED A CASTLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
faces now; and it mattered little whether they&#xD;
had known most of the smiles or of the tears.&#xD;
Then he thought how often his father had passed&#xD;
here, with all manhood's brightest hopes stirring&#xD;
at his heart, and all manhood's proudest resolve&#xD;
in his breast-yet how little either the hope or&#xD;
the resolve had availed to change his fate. Mor-&#xD;
ton felt a bitter pang at the reeollecti~n of that&#xD;
father who had gone so early out of his life, but&#xD;
whose memory had ever remained with him as a&#xD;
vision of all that was most noble in simple chiv-&#xD;
alry-a lesson which had done more to mould the&#xD;
boy's character than all the precepts of living&#xD;
teachers. And he was going now to see the&#xD;
woman whose fatal beauty had wrecked the hap.&#xD;
piness of that father's life! He knew-every-&#xD;
body knew-that Edgar Annesley had poured&#xD;
out his love like water at Pauline Morton's feet,&#xD;
and that she had scorned 'him as she scorned all&#xD;
others in that proud heyday of her youth and&#xD;
power. And now there seemed a retribution in&#xD;
the fact that Edgar Annesley's son came forward&#xD;
as her sole defender against the fickle world that&#xD;
had once fawned at her feet. "It is the only&#xD;
revenge he would have wished," thought the son,&#xD;
placing, as he always did, the father in his posi.&#xD;
tion. "But he would never, for one moment,&#xD;
have considered it revenge, lie would have re-&#xD;
garded it as a duty, and thought himself happy&#xD;
in performing it. Ah, I shall never master the&#xD;
whole essence of his knightly creed and practice&#xD;
-he who was a very Bayard, and yet thought&#xD;
that he only fulfilled the common duties of a&#xD;
gentleman." And here, after all, had been the&#xD;
great secret of that resolution which so much&#xD;
surprised Mrs. Annesley. The young man had&#xD;
set out in life feeling himself his father's repre.&#xD;
sentative, and he had never felt this more than&#xD;
when slander' set its mark on the woman his&#xD;
father had loved. He had spoken to his mother&#xD;
as a Morton; but his warmest interest in Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon's cause rose from the fact that he was&#xD;
an Annesley. There, indeed, rose his true ani-&#xD;
mating impulse; and there was an anchor to hold&#xD;
him steadfast through any opposition.&#xD;
Suddenly, when he was ahout half-way to the&#xD;
house, a sound broke on the stillness-a shrill,&#xD;
childish voice that caused Ilderim to start and&#xD;
prick up his satin cars with ominous haste.&#xD;
When he had been brought to order, Annesley&#xD;
was able to comprehend that words of alternate&#xD;
entreaty and command. were apparently being&#xD;
addressed to himself by some unseen person.&#xD;
"Hol~! Monsieur! monsieur, come here!"&#xD;
cried the voice, in a strange mixture of French&#xD;
&#xD;
33&#xD;
&#xD;
and English. "Pardonnez-moi, but that nasty&#xD;
Babette-"&#xD;
The rest was lost in consequence of a sudden&#xD;
movement on Ilderini's part, which demanded all&#xD;
his rider's attention. When this exigence was&#xD;
passed, Morton stared about him in utter bewil-&#xD;
derment, for "the silence was unbroken, and the&#xD;
stillness gave no token" of any human presence&#xD;
beside his own.&#xD;
"Who is there?" he demanded at last--&#xD;
sending his own voice in the direction from&#xD;
which the other had proceeded. "Holloa !-&#xD;
who is there?"&#xD;
Thea the same childish tones replied, impa.&#xD;
tiently:&#xD;
"It is me-Felix Gordon. I wish you would&#xD;
make haste, monsieur, for my arm is very tired"&#xD;
Guided by the voice, Annesley now saw in&#xD;
the grove on his right a small figure clinging&#xD;
half to the trunk and half to the lower limb of a&#xD;
large tree, and thus suspended fully fifteen feet&#xD;
above the ground.&#xD;
"Good Heavens!" he cried. Then, spring.&#xD;
ing from his horse, one or two quick bounds car.&#xD;
ned him at once to the foot of the tree, where&#xD;
he perceived the peril of the child's position&#xD;
more clearly. The limb had evidently broken&#xD;
under him, and left him clinging with one hand&#xD;
to a fragment of it while he braced his feet&#xD;
against a gnarled knot of the tree, and thus par-&#xD;
tially relieved himself of his own weight. But it&#xD;
was only partially; and relief from the preca-&#xD;
rious position was impossible without the aid&#xD;
which bad so opportunely and so accidentally&#xD;
arrived.&#xD;
Morton did not waste any time in words. He&#xD;
saw that the face which looked down upon him&#xD;
was very self-possessed; but he also saw that it&#xD;
was very pale, and marked the painful rigidity&#xD;
of the attitude. He threw his gloves near a&#xD;
small velvet cap that lay on the grass, and the&#xD;
next moment was climbing the tree with the agil-&#xD;
ity of a school-boy.&#xD;
But when he began to approach the child,&#xD;
he saw that caution was necessary, or he 'would&#xD;
dislodge the boy's foot and send him crashing to&#xD;
the ground, for he could do little more than steady&#xD;
himself by his hand. Therefore, the rescuer crept&#xD;
carefully on the opposite side of the trunk, hardly&#xD;
allowing himself more than the merest clasp of&#xD;
it, and, when he was once safe among the bou~hs,&#xD;
ascended to a considerable height befor&amp;amp; he&#xD;
paused. Then, with extreme care, he descended&#xD;
from limb to limb until he reached the one im-&#xD;
mediately above the boy. There he seated him-&#xD;

&#xD;
self~ and finding it secure spoke for the fin&#xD;
time.&#xD;
"Now I am going to draw you up to m&#xD;
When I take hold of your collar, you must h&#xD;
go the clasp both of your feet and your hnnc&#xD;
Don't be afraid; for I shall not let you falL"&#xD;
"Ma foil I am not likely to be afraid," sai&#xD;
the boy, half-scornfully. "But, if you are goin~&#xD;
to do it, you had better make haste."&#xD;
Bending over, Annesley took a firm grasp ol&#xD;
the clothing that encircled the soft young neck&#xD;
and with one vigorous lift placed the child be&#xD;
fore him.&#xD;
His eyes were closed, and he was white t&#xD;
the lips, so that at first Anneslcy thought h&#xD;
had fainted. But the next Instant the fringe&#xD;
lids lifted, and a smile of triumph came over th(&#xD;
pale face.&#xD;
"Babette said I could not do it; but I have&#xD;
done it," he cried. "It was not my fault thai&#xD;
the limb broke."&#xD;
"It was not your fault," said Morton, kindly;&#xD;
"but it was an accident which is likely to happen&#xD;
at any time, and yea must not risk your neck in&#xD;
this way again. I may not be within call next&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"No," said the boy. He glanced rapidly and&#xD;
somewhat wonderingly over the face and form of&#xD;
his deliverer. "I am very much obliged to you,&#xD;
monsieur," he added, with the grand manner which&#xD;
had impressed -even Mrs. Annesley. "But, je ne&#xD;
vous connais pas-that is, I do not know you."&#xD;
"I am your cousin," answered Morton, smil-&#xD;
ing; " and my name is Anneslcy."&#xD;
"Ahi" said the boy; and as he strove to&#xD;
steady himself by altering his position, he gave a&#xD;
faint cry of pain. "It is nothing," he said, quick-&#xD;
ly, in answer to his companion's look of inquiry,&#xD;
"only my arm-I hurt it."&#xD;
"How?"&#xD;
"When the limb broke. Ah, I should have&#xD;
got down ifI could have used it-but I couldn't,&#xD;
you know.~~&#xD;
~' tet me see if it is much hurt," said Annes-&#xD;
ley; and, after the child had unflinchingly borne&#xD;
an examination, he pronounced it only sprained.&#xD;
"The bone is all right," he said; "but you were&#xD;
a brave fellow to hold on with one arm when the&#xD;
other was in this condition."&#xD;
"I'd have hurt both, if I had fallen," said hi~s&#xD;
new acquaintance, with a half-comh grimace-&#xD;
adding quickly, "but, monsieur, let us go&#xD;
down."&#xD;
"I have been thinking how we shall manage&#xD;
that, and I don't see very clearly yet. This is&#xD;
&#xD;
~t the first thing to~ be done." He drew a small&#xD;
flask from his pocket, and held it to his com-&#xD;
~. panion's lips. "1I$rink, my boy-it will burn&#xD;
~t your throat, but never mind that-~you need&#xD;
I. it."&#xD;
The boy drank eagerly-far too eagerly, An-&#xD;
cI nesley thought; for he soon drew the flask&#xD;
~ away.&#xD;
"That is enough-I don't want to unsteady&#xD;
your head for the descent."&#xD;
"Bah!" said the child, in the scornful tone&#xD;
- which came so strangely from his childish lips.&#xD;
"Bab, monsieur! Do you think I could not&#xD;
drink twice that much, and be steady yet?"&#xD;
"I should be sorry if you could," said An-&#xD;
I n~sley, gravely.&#xD;
The dark eyes flashed upon him suddenly.&#xD;
"Pourquoi, monsieur?"&#xD;
"Because it would show that you must have&#xD;
had very bad training," said Morton, quietly.&#xD;
"No child of your age ought to know the taste&#xD;
of brandy-much less, drink it as you did just&#xD;
* now. Who gives it to you?"&#xD;
"Alas! no one now," answered the boy, with&#xD;
candid regret. "Papa gave it to me sometimes&#xD;
-but that was only to worry mamma-and St.&#xD;
John gave it to mc very often."&#xD;
"But surely your mother does not like it to&#xD;
be given to you?"&#xD;
The small shoulders achieved a Gallic shrug&#xD;
which was simply perfect. "I should think not,&#xD;
indeed, monsieur! Mamma will not even let me&#xD;
drink a glass of wine-and IJabette, nasty thing!&#xD;
always tells her if I do."&#xD;
"Then, if I had been in your place," saidMor-&#xD;
ton, impressively, "I would not haVe taken that&#xD;
brandy, unless your mother had given it to you&#xD;
herself."&#xD;
The boy gazed at him wonderingly. "Mon-&#xD;
sieur, why not?"&#xD;
"Because I should have felt bound by her&#xD;
wishes, especially as she was absent," said Mor-&#xD;
ton, as gravely as befitted the character of Men-&#xD;
tor, with which the occasion had invested him.&#xD;
"A trust, my boy, is a thing which cannot he&#xD;
held too sacred. Come, I see you are very sen-&#xD;
sible, and I need not talk to you as I would to&#xD;
most children-I can speak to you almost as if&#xD;
you were a man. You mean to be a gentleman,&#xD;
do you not?"&#xD;
"I am a gentleman," was the quick reply.&#xD;
"I am glad to hear you say so. Ilut do&#xD;
you know what is the chief thing that makes a&#xD;
gentleman? Not blood, not birth-they are good&#xD;
in their way, but they won't do by themselves-&#xD;
&#xD;
not any one thing so much as the capability of&#xD;
being trusted."&#xD;
"Mamma says so-but she is a woman."&#xD;
"Well, I am a man, and I tell you the same&#xD;
thing. What is more, I tell you that nobody who&#xD;
bore the Morton name was ever lacking in this&#xD;
capability. Look round! do you see all this,&#xD;
which will be yours some day-these noble trees,&#xD;
and those broad fields yonder? Well, the men&#xD;
who owned all this before you were men who, if&#xD;
a trust had been given them, would have held it&#xD;
till they died-held it as you held that limb a&#xD;
little while ago. You are a Morton in courage,&#xD;
why not be a Morton in honor as well?"&#xD;
The sudden question took his listener en-&#xD;
tirely by surprise. He looked up-still with'&#xD;
wonder-into the earnest face which bent over&#xD;
him, as he said, slowly, "I am a Gordon, mon-&#xD;
sieur."&#xD;
"I know. But you are a Morton also; and,&#xD;
whatever the Gordons were, the Mortons, at&#xD;
least, have always been brave and loyal gentle-&#xD;
men. I could tell you many a story about the&#xD;
men of your name-and then, perhaps, you would&#xD;
think that such a name was worth ~~aring.~~&#xD;
"Tell me," said the boy, eagerly. "St. John&#xD;
used to tell me about the Gordons; and I liked&#xD;
to hear how they killed men and ran away with&#xD;
women, and drank wine and brandy."&#xD;
"Then I am afraid you would not like my&#xD;
stories," said Morton, "for I have nothing of the&#xD;
sort to tell you. The men of whom I 4eak never&#xD;
did any of those things. They were simple, hon-&#xD;
orable gentlemen, who lived quiet lives, but who&#xD;
knew how to be true to their friends, to honor&#xD;
their God, and to serve their country; but not&#xD;
one of them would have put that flask of brandy&#xD;
to his lips!"&#xD;
Felix's large eyes opened widely. "Mon-&#xD;
sieur! Did none of them drink brandy?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes," said Morton, "I suppose all of&#xD;
them drank brandy, and sometimes more than&#xD;
was good for them. But none of them would&#xD;
have done so if they had been put on their honor&#xD;
not to do it by somebody who had a right to&#xD;
exact such a promise."&#xD;
Felix looked thoughtful. It was evident that&#xD;
a new light had dawned on his mind-a light&#xD;
very different, when presented by this handsome&#xD;
young cavalier, to that which had been urged by&#xD;
his mother. At last, as he did not speak, Annes-&#xD;
ley broke the silence.&#xD;
"Now, we must get down, or your mother will&#xD;
be uneasy about you. Were you alone when you&#xD;
climbed up here?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"No; Babette was with me. She said I&#xD;
should not do it, and I said I would--and I did!&#xD;
~he tried to hold me; but she isn't strong,&#xD;
though her arms are so big; and, when I kicked&#xD;
her, she had to let me go."&#xD;
"Who is Babette?"&#xD;
"My bonne," answered the boy, with a gri-&#xD;
mace. "St. John says I am too old-I shouldn't&#xD;
have a bonne."&#xD;
"But, as you have got one, you ought to treat&#xD;
her properly. I am sorry to hear of your having&#xD;
acted asyou did. Horses kick-not gentlemen."&#xD;
"st. John says I ought to torment the life out&#xD;
of her, and then she will go ~&#xD;
~C And then your mother would get another,&#xD;
perhaps a worse one. Who is this St. John?&#xD;
He seems to have given you very bad advice."&#xD;
"He was papa's secretary, and I liked him;&#xD;
but mamma hated him."&#xD;
"Then you certainly ought not to obey him&#xD;
so well. Now let us move forward. How does&#xD;
your arm feel 2-well enough to bear a weight?"&#xD;
"N-.o," said Felix, regretfully. "What do&#xD;
you want me to do&#xD;
"I wanted you to clasp your arms round my&#xD;
neck, while I go down the tree. But we must&#xD;
compromise with yourf feet. Do you think you&#xD;
can hold on with them? '~&#xD;
The boy laughed. "It will be funny," he&#xD;
said, "but I think I can."&#xD;
"This way-let me lift you to my shoulder.&#xD;
Are you firmly seated? Now, hold tight-take a&#xD;
grasp of my collar."&#xD;
"I'll do it."&#xD;
And he did do it, with a vigor which threat-&#xD;
ened strangulation unless their descent was very&#xD;
speedy.&#xD;
"Here we go!" said Mox~ton, gayly. "Pity&#xD;
we haven't got an audience for this feat in gym.&#xD;
nasties." And, lightly swinging loose from the&#xD;
bough on which they had been perched, he clam-&#xD;
bered down the trunk, without in the least seem-&#xD;
ing to feel his burdened condition.&#xD;
In less than a inmate they were standing on&#xD;
the ground laughing together in friendly good-&#xD;
fellowship. Ilderim had taken his departure&#xD;
some time before, so the sylvan solitude was all&#xD;
their own.&#xD;
"Now for this arm of yours," said Morton.&#xD;
"It must be attended to at once; and your&#xD;
clothes are considerably the worse for, your mis-&#xD;
hap. What will your mother say?"&#xD;
The boy shrugged his shoulders. "She wiir&#xD;
think of this,?' he said, touching his arm.&#xD;
bette will scold about the clothes."'&#xD;

86                        MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ADELAIDE.                     37&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, J'dare say you can hold your cv&#xD;
against Babette. Is the avenue the short&#xD;
way to the house?"&#xD;
"No; I'll take you a shorter one."&#xD;
They set forward amicably, talking as th&#xD;
went. And, as they talked, it would be hard 1&#xD;
say which of them conceived the most cordi&#xD;
liking for the other. On Morton's side it wr&#xD;
more than half pity, for he perceived the mon&#xD;
perversion of the child's nature, and read plain&#xD;
his reckless rebellion against the curb held ove&#xD;
him by feminine hands. But he saw the element&#xD;
of much nobility, together with the proofs of muc&#xD;
bravery, and the latter in itself delighted him&#xD;
The boy's face kindled when he spoke of heroism&#xD;
and, if it did not kindle when he spoke of chiv&#xD;
al~'y, it was because the principles of ehiva1r~&#xD;
were foreign teachings to his mind-not be&#xD;
cause the nature was incapable of holding them&#xD;
Some sinister influence had plainly been at won&#xD;
with him-some influence like that which ha~&#xD;
marred many another gallant nature-and had&#xD;
indissolubly associated valor with evil, and weak.&#xD;
ness with good, in the~ boy's apprehension. Pride&#xD;
of a certain sort had been duly instilled, but it&#xD;
was very far from being pride of a right sort-if&#xD;
indeed, there be a right sort. Annesley was&#xD;
puzzled by the strange contradictions that un-&#xD;
folded themselves before him. But he was more&#xD;
interested than repelled, and he could not help&#xD;
thinking how pleasant it would be to draw these&#xD;
warped conceptions straight. Perhaps he was&#xD;
something of a Quixote in those early days-too&#xD;
prone to amateur philanthropy. But there was&#xD;
that about him which caused most people to for.&#xD;
give the failing; and, considering how soon such&#xD;
inipulsive 'generosity is cooled and cured by later&#xD;
y~ars, they could well afford to do so. His heart&#xD;
yearned now over this fatherless boy-this boy&#xD;
who was his own kinsman-an~jl even while he&#xD;
talked to him of sports, and dogs; and horses,&#xD;
and on all the topics most dear to a boy's fancy,~&#xD;
he was mentally considering how he could gain a&#xD;
sort~of4ght of tutelage over him. It all depended&#xD;
on that unknown woman whom he was going to&#xD;
meet-that woman whose sworn defender he had&#xD;
already constituted himself; and he began to&#xD;
feel more anxiety about her reception of him,&#xD;
than he had suffered himself to entertain before.&#xD;

The boy hesitated a minute; but, at the sec-&#xD;
ond bidding, he went-speeding like an arrow&#xD;

and so warm a light in her eyes that he marked&#xD;
none of the ravages of time, but only saw'that&#xD;

ling's safety to you! How can I thank you&#xD;
enough!~~&#xD;
"You must not thank me at all," said An-&#xD;

that had grasped his own-and there was some.&#xD;
thing very courtly in the action, though it was&#xD;
one of unstudied impulse-" or you will make&#xD;

She read his face all over with one glance of&#xD;
her eyes, then spoke impulsively: "Ah, my kins-&#xD;

There was something in the tone which pro-&#xD;
nounced his father's name that touched Morton's&#xD;
heart to the quick-won it, indeed, for this&#xD;
woman who had wrecked that father's happi-&#xD;

was an echo of the admiring reverence, the re-&#xD;

soul when he thought of. that brief life and pre-&#xD;
mature death-an echo he had never before heard&#xD;

she smiled kindly, and, laying' her hand on his&#xD;
arm, said:&#xD;
"Come. Let me welcome my kinsman to&#xD;

And then Annesley found himself led forward&#xD;
into the castle which had been declared impregna-&#xD;
ble-a paladin, invested for the time being with a&#xD;
sort of chivalric triumph, and quite the master&#xD;
of the situation.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE ADELAIDE.&#xD;
"Now, Katy," said Miss Tresham, in a tone&#xD;
of authority, "you must say this lesson, my dear&#xD;
-and you must not mumble the words so that&#xD;
I cannot bear them, either. Take your finger&#xD;
out of your mouth, and hold up your head. Now&#xD;

"'A verb,"' drawled Katy, "'is a word&#xD;
which signifies to be, to do, or '-to do-or-or&#xD;
-is that all a verb signifies, Miss Tresham?"&#xD;
"'To suffer,"' prompted Jack, in a loud&#xD;
whisper, with his eyes fastened on the pages of&#xD;
his arithmetic.&#xD;
"Jack," said the governess, severely, "take&#xD;
your book and go and stand up in the corner, at&#xD;
the other end of the room. In a few minii~es I&#xD;
shall see if you know your own lesson well&#xD;
enough to be prompting Katy with hers. You&#xD;
will have to learn a French verb after school,&#xD;
for breaking rules.-Now, Katy, I will give you&#xD;
one more trial. 'A verb is a word which signi-&#xD;
fies to be, to do, or to suffer.' What~ next?"&#xD;
Very well. Go on." For Katy, having de-&#xD;
livered this much in a very loud voice, came to&#xD;
a sudden, dead stop.&#xD;
"'Verbs are-are of two kinds '-ain't they&#xD;
of two kinds, Miss Tresham?"&#xD;
"Go on, my dear," said Miss Tresham, with&#xD;
severe patience.&#xD;
"'Verbs are of two kinds,'" repeated Katy,&#xD;
dubiously, as it' the statement was, in her own&#xD;
opinion, a very doubtful one; and there she&#xD;
paused, and fell to twisting the corner of her&#xD;
apron.&#xD;
"Hold your hands still, and go on, Katy,"&#xD;
said the much-tried governess.&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Verbs are of two kinds,"' repeated Katy,&#xD;
once more, and apparently in a state of despair.&#xD;
"'Verbs are of two kinds-positive, compara-&#xD;
tive, and super-'"&#xD;
Here an audible titter from the other scholars&#xD;
was silenced by a look from the teacher, and a&#xD;
well-thumbed grammar was held out to its owner.&#xD;
"Take your book, my dear, and put it aside.&#xD;
After school, you will have to learn this lesson.&#xD;
Now, children, get your slates and let me see&#xD;
your sums.~~&#xD;
A slamming of desks and shuffling of books&#xD;
ensued, followed by the appearance of various&#xD;
slates, more or less covered with cipherings, all&#xD;
of which were submitted to Miss Tresham. She'&#xD;
took the one nearest her, and began casting up&#xD;
the column of figures.&#xD;
There was a temporary silence in the school-&#xD;
room, for all eyes were anxiously following the&#xD;
movements of the governess's pencil, and the&#xD;
only sounds were her strokes on the slate, as&#xD;
sh~ made her firm, round numerals, and the&#xD;
swaying to and fro of some boughs before the&#xD;
open window-boughs that wc faintly stirred&#xD;
by a soft, southern breeze, and between which&#xD;
the golden sunshine streamed across the school-&#xD;
room floor, across Katharine's dark-blue dress&#xD;
and bright brown head, across Jacl~'s darned&#xD;
jacket, and Sara's neat check apron, and smooth&#xD;
little tails of plaited hair. Unfortunately, how-&#xD;
ever, this window was directly over the front-&#xD;
door; and when a quick tread was heard advan~&#xD;
cIng up the walk, and into the piazza, followed by&#xD;
a knock which echoed through the house, there&#xD;
'was an instantaneous end both of silence and at.~&#xD;
tension.&#xD;
"Hallo! who can that be?" cried Jack. "I&#xD;
bet it's Tom Ford, come aft* his gun, Dick! I&#xD;
told you you'd no business "&#xD;
"Hush, Jack!" said Miss Tresham.-" Here,&#xD;
Sara-here is the mistake in your sum. When&#xD;
you added up this line of figures, you forgot to&#xD;
carry there-"&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, if it's Tom, mayn't I go and&#xD;
give him his gun?" asked Dick, anxiously. He&#xD;
had been listening with all his ears to the muffled&#xD;
sounds below, but had failed to distinguish any&#xD;
thing to set his mind at rest.&#xD;
"I'll 'go and look over the banisters, an~ see&#xD;
who it is," said Jack, briskly, and he made a&#xD;
dart toward the door, but waa promptly arrested&#xD;
by the governess.&#xD;
"Come back this instant to your seat, Jack!&#xD;

&#xD;
did not even have time to smooth her hair, or s&#xD;
add a single adorning touch to her plain morning- I&#xD;
costume. Mrs. Marks was very punctual herself;&#xD;
and liked punctuality in other people, especially I&#xD;
with regard to meals; so, with one deprecating&#xD;
glance at the little school-room mirror, Miss ~&#xD;
Tresham ran down-Stairs.&#xD;
As she saw Ilderim still standing beside the&#xD;
front gate, she did not need the sound of a cer- I&#xD;
tam ringing laugh, which came through the open&#xD;
door, to tell her that Ilderim's master was in the I&#xD;
dining-room. The next minute she was shaking&#xD;
hands with him.&#xD;
"See how forgiving I am," he said, with a&#xD;
smile. "You refused to see me, and I not only&#xD;
wait your pleasure, but I encroach on Mrs.&#xD;
Marks's hospitality without the least remorse.&#xD;
Have you been victimizing those poor children&#xD;
forth last hour on my account?"&#xD;
"The matter lies just the other way," she&#xD;
answered. "It is they who have been victimiz-&#xD;
ing me on your account, until I wished that yon&#xD;
had timed your visit better. I make no apolo-&#xD;
gies for not seeing you. I believe you know my&#xD;
school-hours."&#xD;
"I do know them; but I thought you&#xD;
might relax your rule for once, since I have&#xD;
been away so long. However, Mrs. Marks&#xD;
was kind enough to see me, and has enter-&#xD;
tained me so well that I did not find the time&#xD;
long."&#xD;
"Indeed, then, Mr. Annesley, you must be&#xD;
fond of hearing about children and chickens,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Marks, with a good.humQred laugh;&#xD;
"for I don't remember talking about any thing&#xD;
else. I felt sorry for you, but I knew there was&#xD;
no use in going after Miss Katharine. She never&#xD;
will come down in her school-hours."&#xD;
"And you're quite right, Miss Kate," said&#xD;
Mr. Marks. "Work is work, and play is play,&#xD;
and, in my opinion, the two should never be&#xD;
mixed up together.-Mr. Annesley, Let me help&#xD;
you to a piece of this duck.-Bessie, what is&#xD;
that you have before you?"&#xD;
"Some beef of my own corning," answered&#xD;
Mrs. Marks, with all a housekeeper's pride.-&#xD;
"Mr. Annesley, you must take some, and tell me&#xD;
what you think of it."&#xD;
Mr. Annesley accepted a mammoth slice, and,&#xD;
with commendable industry, ate a considerable&#xD;
portion of it, praising it the while highly; it is to&#xD;
be hoped, sincerely.&#xD;
Then the conversation turned upon the dif-&#xD;
ferent methods of corning beef, and a grave dis-&#xD;
cussion ensued, in which Morton acquitted him-&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
elf with credit, and much pleased his host and&#xD;
hostess.&#xD;
These good people, though even to their own&#xD;
hearts they would not have acknowledged such a&#xD;
hing, were not a little flattered by the attention&#xD;
vhich it had lately pleased the young owner of&#xD;
~nnesdale to show them-attentions the source&#xD;
~f which they were shrewd enough to suspect,&#xD;
ut which in themselves were no slight tokens&#xD;
)f distinction, as distinction was reckoned by&#xD;
~he Tallahoma world. Already more than one&#xD;
mvious friend had said to Mrs. Marks:&#xD;
"How often Mr. Annesley comes ~to see&#xD;
foul"&#xD;
To which Mrs. Marks replied, quite indiffer-&#xD;
ently:&#xD;
"Yes, he is so fond of the children, and&#xD;
Richard likes him very much."&#xD;
Therefore, although she sometimes had seri-&#xD;
ous doubts concerning what was to be the end&#xD;
of his evident fancy for Miss Tresham, she could&#xD;
not find it in her heart to discourage his visits.&#xD;
"He is such a gentleman-there can be no&#xD;
harm in it," she once said to her husband, when&#xD;
she felt an unusual qualm on the subject; where-&#xD;
upon honest Mr. Marks answered in his way:&#xD;
"Harm, indeed I What harm could there&#xD;
be? I'll warrant him for a gentleman-Edgav&#xD;
Annesley's son couldn't well be any thing else-&#xD;
but, even if he wasn't, I should think Miss Tres-&#xD;
ham was old enough, and had sense enough, to&#xD;
take care of herself."&#xD;
On the understanding, therefore, that Miss&#xD;
Tresham was old enough, and had sense enough,&#xD;
to take care of herself, Mr. Annesley's visits had&#xD;
not been discouraged. Indeed, he was so bright&#xD;
a visitor that it would have been hard for any,&#xD;
either gentle or simple, to close their doors to&#xD;
him.&#xD;
As he sat at the table now, it was wonderful&#xD;
how he managed to adapt himself to the tone&#xD;
of his entertainers. Often gay, always pleasant,&#xD;
and invariably courteous, he talked household&#xD;
economy to Mrs. Marks, polities to her husband,&#xD;
and nonsense to the children, with an ease that&#xD;
amused Katharine. There was none of that&#xD;
offensive air of "You see I put myself on your&#xD;
level," which some people assume when they at-&#xD;
tempt this kind of thing; but, on the contrary,&#xD;
such a frank charm, such an art, or rather such&#xD;
a gift of throwing', not a pretence, but a reality&#xD;
of interest into every thing he touched, and such&#xD;
a happy power of enlivening the dullest subjects,&#xD;
that the most sensitive person could not have&#xD;
found a shade of patronage to resent. He proved&#xD;

THE ADII&#xD;
&#xD;
have told her the story of his heart, without&#xD;
any need of words.&#xD;
But she did not give that glance. When&#xD;
the song ceased, when her voice fell into silence,&#xD;
and the last vibration of those mournfully pas-&#xD;
sionate cadences had died away, she made an&#xD;
effort to speak lightly; and, without taking her&#xD;
eyes from the keyboard, said, "Will you please&#xD;
look in that portfolio and find me the Ave verum?&#xD;
I will sing it for you to-day, though I could not&#xD;
do so the last time you asked me."&#xD;
Half.mechanically, he obeyed-glad 'of a mo-&#xD;

to speak. Temptation had gone so far, that he&#xD;
could resist no longer. Whatever might be the&#xD;
result, he must lay his heart at this woman's&#xD;
feet, and tell her that it was hers to accept or&#xD;
reject. That magic song had stolen away all ha&#xD;
most steadfast resolves; for he had never intend-&#xD;
ed to declare himself thus prematurely. He al-&#xD;
ways had meant to make a formal demand for&#xD;
his mother's consent, and then to woo the girl&#xD;
he loved as if ske had been the one whom Fortune&#xD;
placed so far above the other! It was always the&#xD;
way of the gallant gentlemen who had borne his&#xD;
name-if poor and humble the maiden whom&#xD;
they loved, they sought her with more state than&#xD;
if ~he had been the highest in the land. So,&#xD;
Morton had meant to come, when he offered his&#xD;
hand to Mr. Marks's governess; but the sudden&#xD;
force of passion was too strong for him. Words&#xD;
suddenly rushed to his lips, and in another mo-&#xD;
ment Annesdale and all its belongings would&#xD;
have lain at Katharine Tresham's feet, if Fate&#xD;
had not intervened.&#xD;
But, turning over, with absent mind and&#xD;
careless hand, the sheets of music, he came to&#xD;
a copy of the song he had just heard, the song&#xD;
which had stirred every fibre of his heart-the&#xD;
sad, passionate, beautiful "Adelaide." As he&#xD;
took it up, there fell from between the leaves an&#xD;
open letter. He caught it, as it was fluttering&#xD;
to the floor, and almost unconsciously his eyes&#xD;
fell on the first lines. They were written in a&#xD;
man's hand, and stood out black and clear on&#xD;
the white paper.&#xD;
"Mv DEAREST KATUAnINE: I am terribly un-&#xD;
certain whether this letter will reach you, but at&#xD;
* least-.-"&#xD;
This much Mortoxi could not avoid seeing-&#xD;
more than this, he did' not read. Indeed, the&#xD;
hot, sharp pang which shot through his heart&#xD;
&#xD;
LAIDE.                               41&#xD;
sent a mist to his eyes which jvould have pre-&#xD;
vented his doing so, if he had felt such a thing&#xD;
possible. Then he strove to steady himself.&#xD;
Might not Katharine, for aught 'he knew, have&#xD;
brothers, uncles, cousins, a dozen relations, from&#xD;
whom such an address might naturally be per-&#xD;
mitt~d? What a jealous fool he was! He&#xD;
would speak to her immediately, and her first&#xD;
look would show him his folly. So he did speak&#xD;
-with just a slight quiver in his voice to betray&#xD;
his anxiety.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham."&#xD;
Katharine turned quickly, and,' as her glance&#xD;
fell from his face to the open letter in his hand,&#xD;
Morton's heart gave a great bound-then sud-&#xD;
denly stood still.&#xD;
For she did not smile in recognition of a&#xD;
friend's epistle, nor blush that rosy red which&#xD;
greets a lover's missive; she did not hold out&#xD;
her hand or utter one word-she only turned&#xD;
ashen pale, and shivered from head to foot as if&#xD;
with a sudden chill. There was an instant's&#xD;
pause: then Morton spoke hastily, as if eager&#xD;
to relieve a possible fear.&#xD;
"I found this a moment ago, Miss Tresham.&#xD;
Do you leave your letters where any one might&#xD;
find and read them?"&#xD;
She did not answer-only held out her hand&#xD;
toward him.&#xD;
"It may not be of importance," he went on;&#xD;
"but still "&#xD;
"It is ofimportance," she broke in, passion-&#xD;
ately. "To think that I should have left it here!&#xD;
I must have been mad I"&#xD;
She took the letter, and, walking to the fire~&#xD;
place, struck a match, set it on fire, and watched&#xD;
it burn until the last fragment was ashes. Then&#xD;
she shivered once more from head to foot. "I&#xD;
must have been mad!" she repeated.&#xD;
And there was something in the tone and&#xD;
action which settled like ice upon the man who&#xD;
loved her-the man who, a moment before, had&#xD;
wellnigh asked her to be ha wife. He could&#xD;
sooner have put his hand into the fire she had&#xD;
kindled than ask that question now. Not that&#xD;
any suspicion of any kind had entered his mind&#xD;
against her, but simply that he felt chilled to'the&#xD;
very heart. The women who had always made&#xD;
his ideals of the sex werO women mntct 'whose&#xD;
stainless lives there entered no pages that all&#xD;
the world might not read; and not a 'worldling&#xD;
of the world held more firmly than this chivalric&#xD;
but most fastidious gentleman the great maxim&#xD;
of the world, "Distrust secrecy.~~&#xD;
So, when Mrs. Marks bustled in a few mm-&#xD;
&#xD;

42                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                    M. WARWICK MAKES AN OFFER.                 43&#xD;
&#xD;
utes later, her advent was a relief to him as ii&#xD;
as to Katharine, and, for the half-hour which&#xD;
sued, that good woman had all the burden of c~&#xD;
versation on her own shoulders.&#xD;
Then Mr. Annesley found it was time to g&#xD;
so he made his adieux and took his departure&#xD;
riding very slowly from the gate where lider&#xD;
had stood so long, and unmindful of the wisti&#xD;
glances sent after him by poor little Katy, who&#xD;
heart had been set upon a ride..&#xD;
When Katharine was left alone in the park&#xD;
her first act was to go and toss over the litt&#xD;
~feathery heap of ashes on the hearth, to see th&#xD;
no end of paper remained. Then she raised h&#xD;
face with a weary sigh, half of relief; half&#xD;
pain.&#xD;
"All gone!" she said, aloud. "But Gc&#xD;
only knows when that may come to me which&#xD;
can never, never cast from me, as I now ca~&#xD;
these ashes!"&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
MR. WARWXc~ MAKES AN OFFER.&#xD;
Az.rxn that day~ the Marks household saw n~&#xD;
more 9? Mr. Annesley for some time. Even i&#xD;
the walks which Katharine regularly took witi&#xD;
the children, they ceased to meet him, as ofter&#xD;
before; and they might have thought hirnabseni&#xD;
from home, if'they had not seen him occasionally~&#xD;
ride past on his way to and from the village~&#xD;
Katy mournedd this sudden desertion faithfully&#xD;
but even for Katy's heart there proved at last to&#xD;
be a balm in Gilead, and it came in this way.&#xD;
Between the well-cultivated fields which Mr.&#xD;
Marks called his own, and the stately Morton&#xD;
woods that stretched to meet them, and bore the&#xD;
Morton name for many a long aiiile, there lay a&#xD;
strip of land belonging to the latter, which, hav-&#xD;
ing been "thrown out" for years, had made that&#xD;
place dear to every child's heart-an old field&#xD;
where broom-straw and young pines disputed&#xD;
possession with blackberry-bushes and wild fruil~.&#xD;
trees; where strawberries by bushels were to be&#xD;
found in spring, and sweet, delicate wild-flowers&#xD;
bloemed in profusion; where the boys of Talla.&#xD;
hom~ came when they wanted to arrange strictly&#xD;
px*ate'racing or shooting matches; where there&#xD;
wasaiways a ring ready for amateur circus per-&#xD;
fo~tue~~s; where there was a " branch"' in Which&#xD;
minnows and crawfish abounded (not to speak&#xD;
of the best p~ssib~e mud for mud.pies), and&#xD;
where the Marks children spent as much time,~&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
0&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
reIl the whole year round, as was left at their own&#xD;
en- disposal.&#xD;
)n- One day they came home from this favorite&#xD;
resort full' of momentous intelligence-they had&#xD;
o; made a new acquaintance. When the name of&#xD;
- this new acquaintance was heard, the interest of&#xD;
mm the elders was scarcely inferior to that of the&#xD;
hi children; for it was Felix Gordon-the little&#xD;
se prince, as people began to call him, on account&#xD;
of his proud young beauty and grand young man-&#xD;
ir, ners.&#xD;
Ic "And he's downright jolly, mamma," cried&#xD;
at Jack, in his vociferous way. "I thought he was&#xD;
er a baby, you know-having a great big nurse&#xD;
f following him about all the time; but he isn't&#xD;
a hit of a one. And he says he hates her; and&#xD;
d he says she ain't going to mind him any more."&#xD;
I "But he's got a boy that follows him now,"&#xD;
~t said Dick; "and he orders him about just as if&#xD;
he was a man."&#xD;
"But' I thought his mother kept him so&#xD;
close, he was never allowed to see anybody?"&#xD;
said Mrs. Marks. "lie must have been there&#xD;
without her knowledge."&#xD;
"He says he can go anywhere he pleases&#xD;
now, provided this boy goes along with him,"&#xD;
) answered Jack, whosevolubilitymade him spokes.&#xD;
man for the party, whether the others would or&#xD;
1 no. "He says Mr. Annesley talked his mother&#xD;
into 'lowing it; and he says he's going to have&#xD;
a pony soon as ever Mr. Annesley can find one&#xD;
for his mother to buy."&#xD;
"And he says I may ride it!" broke in Katy,&#xD;
determined to have an utterance on this point at&#xD;
least.&#xD;
"My daughter!" said her mother, reproving.&#xD;
ly. "I hope you were not such a forward little&#xD;
girl as to ask him."&#xD;
"Oh, no, mamma; he promised me his own&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"Oh, did he?" cried Jack, sarcastically.&#xD;
"Well, I reckon he did-after you'd been hint.&#xD;
ing like forty! She told him she liked riding,&#xD;
mamma, and she kep' a-telling 'him so, till he&#xD;
was 'Wgecf to ask her. Yes, missy, you know&#xD;
that's so!"&#xD;
"I don't," retorted the little lady, angrily.&#xD;
-"' 'Tain't so, either, mamma; he asked me his&#xD;
own self."&#xD;
"Why didn't he ask Sara, too, then?" in-&#xD;
quired provoking Jack. "She's a great deal&#xD;
prettier than you are-you stuck.up, forward&#xD;
thing!"&#xD;
"He did ask me," said Sara's quiet little&#xD;
voice.-" He turned round and asked me just&#xD;
&#xD;
after he asked Katy, mamma; and just like he&#xD;
was a grown-up gentleman. But 1 told hina no,&#xD;
I was much obliged to him, but I was afraid of&#xD;
horses."&#xD;
"And that was what Katy ought to have&#xD;
told him," said Jack, looking severe reproof at&#xD;
Katy.&#xD;
"But I ain't afraid of horses," cried she,&#xD;
indignantly; "and I oughtn't to have told a&#xD;
story.-Mamma, he is so nice. Mayn't we&#xD;
please go to see him ?-he asked us."&#xD;
"Yes, mamma, he asked us-mayn't we 1"'&#xD;
chorussed all the rest.&#xD;
But of this, Mrs. Marks would not hear.&#xD;
"You may go to see him, if he comes to see&#xD;
you," she said; "but otherwise-Certainly not."&#xD;
With this condition, the children were obliged&#xD;
to be content-trusting to their new acquaint-&#xD;
ance for its fulfilment. But their new acquaint-&#xD;
ance either would not or could not fulfil it. He&#xD;
met the little Markses every day in their favorite&#xD;
place of resort; and every day they brought&#xD;
home more wonderful accounts of Felix's say-&#xD;
ings and doings; but Felix himself never a~-&#xD;
peared.&#xD;
And so the Indian summer came gradually&#xD;
to an end; the soft, blue haze faded from the&#xD;
landscape; a few fierce storms tore all the&#xD;
bright leaves from the trees; and Winter-at&#xD;
least as much of winter as the fair South ever&#xD;
knows-was seated on his throne. His first act&#xD;
of power was a nipping frost, accompanied by&#xD;
such a "freeze" as had not been known in that&#xD;
region of country for a fabulous number of years&#xD;
-a freeze which, to the amazement of every.&#xD;
body, spread a sheet of ice over a small mill-pond&#xD;
near the town, and put all the boys of Tallahoma&#xD;
figuratively on their heads, and literally on their&#xD;
backs.&#xD;
In the new field of amusement thus opened,&#xD;
neither Jack nor Dick were behiadhand; and one&#xD;
day they joined in begging Miss Tresham to&#xD;
come and witness their prowess. "Sara and&#xD;
Katy want to see some skating," said the boys,&#xD;
who were not bad brothers as boys go; "and&#xD;
mamma says they can't come out to the pond,&#xD;
'less you'll come too, Miss Tresham. Please,&#xD;
do- it's such fun."&#xD;
go~d&#xD;
"Is it?" said Miss Tresham. "But it is&#xD;
cold fun, too, for people who don't skate. Have&#xD;
you got a fire out there?"&#xD;
[ "Oh, the biggest sort," cried both boys,-in a&#xD;
~ breath. "And we'll make it up splendid, if&#xD;
1you'll come, Miss Tresham."&#xD;
sa Tresham looked doubtfully out, of the&#xD;
&#xD;
window. It was certainly cold; but the boys&#xD;
rere anxiOuS; Katy and Sara looked unutterable&#xD;
hings; she herself felt that she needed exer-&#xD;
~ise; and, then~-the wind was not blowing!&#xD;
Phat is such a great point in a climate where&#xD;
itill cold can never be very dreadful.&#xD;
"Do you want to g~ very badly?" she asked,&#xD;
rith a smile, of the two little girls.&#xD;
And they-who knew by that smile how&#xD;
bheir cause was won-answered, eagerly: "Oh,&#xD;
ycs'm; oh, Miss Tresham, indeed we do!,,&#xD;
"Very well, then; we will walk out after&#xD;
Elinner. And as for you "-she shook her finger&#xD;
at the two young skaters-" if you deceive mo&#xD;
about the fire, I will never trust either ~f you&#xD;
again."&#xD;
They made the most effusive promises, the&#xD;
two young scamps, who were secretly burning&#xD;
to be oiL "Never mind, Miss Tresham, I'll&#xD;
see about it," said Jack, grandly. "I'll make&#xD;
them bring heaps of pine-knots, and they shall&#xD;
all be put on when you come.-But, I say, Dick,&#xD;
look sharp-it's time we were off."&#xD;
"Off!" echoed the governess. "Are you&#xD;
not going to wait for dinner?"&#xD;
"We can't," said both in a breath. "But&#xD;
Mom Judy promised to have us a basket ready,&#xD;
and we'll eat it on the road." (Theydid not&#xD;
mean the basket, but its contents.) "Don't&#xD;
change your mind, Miss Tresham.-we'll look&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
"You shall see me," answered she. "I hope&#xD;
you will enjoy yourselves."&#xD;
They had the grace to thank h~ir; and then&#xD;
were off, running down the passage, leaping down&#xD;
the staircase, as if the fate of a nation depended&#xD;
on their speed; and filling the house with that&#xD;
stir and clatter, that healthful noise and pervad-&#xD;
ing sense of vitality, which only the presence of&#xD;
boys can diffuse.&#xD;
After they were gone, Miss Tresham and her&#xD;
two young charges drew near the school-room&#xD;
fire, and waited for the sound of the dinner-bell.&#xD;
It came at last, breaking in upon the oft-told&#xD;
story of the "Fair One with~ the Golden Locks;"&#xD;
and they went down together, the children claim-&#xD;
ing each a hand of their young teacher, and mak-&#xD;
ing quite a pretty picture when they entered the&#xD;
dining-room.&#xD;
At least, so a gentleman thought who was&#xD;
standing before the fire with a paper in his hand,&#xD;
and at sight of whom Katy burst into an ercia.&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
"Why, unky! I thought you never came to&#xD;
dinner."&#xD;

"And as good as she ~s pretty," said Mrs.&#xD;
Marks. ~nthusiastieally. "The children love the&#xD;
very ground she walks on; and, if ever I had&#xD;
a lucky day in my lire, it was the day I met&#xD;

The table was cleared oft; draped with its&#xD;
bright-crimson cover, and wheeled into its ac-&#xD;
customed corner; the last plate and goblet&#xD;
whisked away to the pantry, the fire replen-&#xD;
ished, the hearth swept, the cheery dining-room&#xD;
looking the cheeriest, when Katharine came in&#xD;
again.&#xD;
She found Mr. Warwick the only occupant&#xD;
of the room-Mr. Marks having gone into town,&#xD;
and Mrs. Marks into the kitchen. It was that&#xD;
important era in housekeeping known as "hog.&#xD;
killing time," and the lard and the sausages ab-&#xD;
sorbed Mrs. Marks almost as much as the pig-&#xD;
tails and the roasting thereof distracted the chil-&#xD;
dren. Katharine uas not surprised to find her&#xD;
gone, but she was surprised to see Mr. Warwick,&#xD;
who looked up from his newspaper as she en-&#xD;
tered.&#xD;
"Ready?" said he. "I gave you thirty min-&#xD;
utes, and you have only taken fifteen. Well-"&#xD;
with an amused glance from her bontiet to her&#xD;
shoes-" I think you can safely defy the weath-&#xD;
er."&#xD;
"I think I am ridiculously wrapped up," an-&#xD;
swered she; "but panics are infectious. You&#xD;
have all been talking about the cold till I de-&#xD;
luded myself into a belief that it must be Sibe-&#xD;
ria; while the truth is, that I opened my window&#xD;
just before I came down, and it is absolutely&#xD;
pleasant."&#xD;
"So much the better for your walk, then.&#xD;
But I think you'll change your mind when you&#xD;
are once out-of-doors."&#xD;
Just here there was a rush. in the passage&#xD;
outside; and the two little girls flashed into the&#xD;
room in their warm cloaks and bright-crimson&#xD;
hoods. Then came an outcry.&#xD;
"Why, Miss Tresham's all ready, and we&#xD;
don't have to wait-how nice!"&#xD;
"Katy, don't forget about the candy."&#xD;
"Unky, please hand me down the candy."&#xD;
"Do it up tight."&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, please tie this knot. I can't&#xD;
get my gloves off."&#xD;
"You little torment!" said Miss Tresham.&#xD;
"flow can I do it when I have my own gloves&#xD;
on? Ask Mr. Warwick."&#xD;
"Unky, please."&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
"I suspect Miss Tresham could do it better&#xD;
with gloves than I can without," said "unky."&#xD;
But he tied the knot very deftly, neverthe-&#xD;
less; and then slipped the package into his&#xD;
pocket, much to the astonishment of Katy and&#xD;
Sara, who raised a frightened cry of expostula-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Unky 1"&#xD;
"Oh, that's Indian-gift!"&#xD;
But the Indian-giver turned quietly to the&#xD;
governess.&#xD;
"May I go along, if I promise to show you&#xD;
the best road, and not to promote any disturb-&#xD;
ances?"&#xD;
Katharine looked surprised.&#xD;
"Are you in earnest, Mr. Warwick?"&#xD;
"To be sure I ama in earnest," said Mr. War-&#xD;
wick.- "I came home for the purpose of taking&#xD;
these little ones out; but they will enjoy yo)ar&#xD;
company more than mine. Only, as I don't like&#xD;
to break up my day for nothing, may I go&#xD;
too?"&#xD;
"Of course, you may. - Children, do you&#xD;
hear? Your uncle is going with us."&#xD;
The afternoon was dazzlingly bright when&#xD;
they went out into it; and Mr. Warwick was&#xD;
soon forced to acknowledge that Katharine's&#xD;
judgment of the temperature was better than&#xD;
his own. Being bright and still, the atmosphere&#xD;
had softened very much, and seemed~ to them&#xD;
almost mild as' they walked in the full glow of&#xD;
the winter sun.&#xD;
"This will be the last day of skating," said&#xD;
Mr. Warwick. "Indeed, I doubt if the ice is&#xD;
safe now. I think I shall stop Jack and Dick&#xD;
as soon as we get there."&#xD;
"Even if the ice broke, is the water deep&#xD;
enough to drown anybody?" asked Katharine,&#xD;
to whom a mill-pond did not suggest any thing&#xD;

"Courage. ilemember how young you are.&#xD;
Happiness may come to you yet, in the form you&#xD;
like best."&#xD;
"And what is that form?"&#xD;
He shrugged his shoulders slightly, as he had&#xD;
a habit of doing over any knotty point of legal&#xD;
evidence.&#xD;
"I may be mistaken, but it seems to me you&#xD;
would like best the happiness that could give&#xD;
you all those things of which you have so keen&#xD;
an appreciation - pictures, music, amusement,&#xD;
and the admiration which all women value so&#xD;
highly.t'&#xD;
"I certainly like all those things," said Kath-&#xD;
arine, with a little sigh; "but I assure you, I&#xD;
can live without them and be happy too. No,&#xD;
Mr. Warwick, you have not hit upon the one great&#xD;
gift which Happiness must bring in her hand&#xD;
when she comes to me-or else not be happiness&#xD;
at alL"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick looked at her intently. Did&#xD;
she mean Morton Annesley's love, he wondered.&#xD;
If so, why did she speak of it thus frankly to&#xD;
him? It was not like Katharine Tresham to&#xD;
do so. "Tell me what it is?" he asked.&#xD;
The clear, gray eyes-pure and truthful as&#xD;
God's noonday-met his own, as she answered,&#xD;
quietly: "It is the gift of peace."&#xD;
After that, nothing was said for several min-&#xD;
utes. Katy came dancing back with a spray of&#xD;
holly which was duly admired, and which, at&#xD;
her request, Katharine fastened in her brooch.&#xD;
Then, after she ran forward again, Mr. Warwick&#xD;
spoke:&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, I am going to say some-&#xD;
thing which may seem impertinent, but which, I&#xD;
trust, you will take as it is meant-in simple&#xD;
kindness. I have noticed, for some time past,&#xD;
that you have not been quite yourself, that you&#xD;
have grown thin, that your spirits are less even&#xD;
than heretofore, and that some trouble is evi-&#xD;
dently preying upon you. Is not this so?"&#xD;
Katharine caught her breath, paling percep-&#xD;
tibly. "I hoped no one had noticed it," she&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"I am sure I may safely say that no one but&#xD;
myself has done so," he answered. "I atn a&#xD;
very close observer-Nature gave me the habit,&#xD;
and my profession has taught me its importance&#xD;
-but you are a very good dissembler. The trifles&#xD;
in which you have betrayed yourself were light&#xD;
as air; but the driftwood shows the direction of&#xD;
the current, you know. I did not need to hear&#xD;
what you said a moment ago, to convince me&#xD;
that something is wrong with you. If it is any&#xD;
&#xD;
47&#xD;
&#xD;
thing ideal, I can do nothing for you; but if it&#xD;
is any practical trouble, such as comes to 'us all&#xD;
sooner or later, why, I trust you believe me to&#xD;
be your friend."&#xD;
"Yes," she said, simply; "I am glad to be-&#xD;
lieve it."&#xD;
"And I am glad to hear you say so; for&#xD;
I have watched you closely, ever since you&#xD;
entered my sister's house, and I have never yet&#xD;
known you to trifle with truth. That, first, made,&#xD;
me like you, I think-for, of all virtues, it is at&#xD;
once the greatest and the rarest. If you believe&#xD;
me to be your friend, there is not much more t~&#xD;
add. A woman-even a woman as brave as 'you&#xD;
are-is such a helpless creature in the world, that&#xD;
she is often made to suffer acutely through her&#xD;
weakness and her ignorance. In any emergency,&#xD;
therefore, I hope you will remember that my ser-&#xD;
vices are at your command."&#xD;
"Thank you," said Katharine, lifting her face'&#xD;
toward him, with a grateful light shining over&#xD;
it. "You are very kind, and there is no one to&#xD;
whom I would as soon go. But-" she paused a&#xD;
moment, and added, slowly-" I must bear my&#xD;
burden alone."&#xD;
He turned and looked at her. The light had&#xD;
faded, and the young face seemed to have hard-&#xD;
ened into a self-contained power of endurance.&#xD;
The mouth was set, the eyes were resolute, and,&#xD;
as she met his glance, she repeated her words in&#xD;
the same tone:&#xD;
"I must bear my burden alone."&#xD;
"I cannot help you?"&#xD;
"No. You are very good; but only He who&#xD;
laid it on me can take it away."&#xD;
Again they walked on silently; and the'law~&#xD;
yer felt half inclined to indulge in his quiet,&#xD;
cynical shrug. "It is Annesley, after all," he'&#xD;
thought. "What a fool I was to suppose it could&#xD;
be any thing else-and a still greater fool to&#xD;
make such an offer! The very pine-trees might&#xD;
afford to laugh at the idea of my playing confidant&#xD;
and console~ in a love-affair!"&#xD;
Then he glanced at the face beside him, and&#xD;
felt again a sudden conviction that itwas not An-&#xD;
ne~Iey-not any cross in love, or ordinary heart-&#xD;
disaster-which brought such a look of suffering&#xD;
and resolve to those earnest eyes. An impulse&#xD;
hardly to be accounted for, and not at all to be&#xD;
analyzed, made him suddenly extend his hand,&#xD;
and place it on Katharine's arm.&#xD;
"One word more," he said. "You are en-&#xD;
tirely unprotected byany friend or relative; this~&#xD;
fact must excuse the request I am about tomake.&#xD;
Will you promise to come to me if you ever stand'&#xD;

contemptuous both at once "I think it is bet-&#xD;

Katharine assented, and they moved away,&#xD;
just as Miss Vernon's clear tones sounded with&#xD;
quite a bell-like distinctness.&#xD;
"I think a pretty woman has a right to&#xD;
adorn her beauty to the utmost of her power,&#xD;
wherever she may be placed. That is one right&#xD;

"But the working-classes, Irene-"&#xD;
"We are not speaking of the working-&#xD;
classes," interrupted the other, with a very cool&#xD;
disdain in her voice. "We are speaking of a&#xD;
member of a liberal profession, I thought. I&#xD;
hear that Miss Tresham is very charming, and&#xD;
for a long time I have had a fancy to know her.&#xD;
-Mr. Annesley, you are a friend of hers; will&#xD;
you introduce me?"&#xD;
"With pleasure, Miss Vernon," said Morton,&#xD;
coloring quickly "I shall be very glad to do&#xD;

"Of course I am in earncst.-Adcla, won't&#xD;

"I?" Mrs. French drew back in astonish-&#xD;

"You will see," said Irene, with a slight&#xD;
nod and a merry laugh. "Carry her to the car-&#xD;

I take your arm?"&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
TUE GOUDOK rLAID.&#xD;
Tns latter part of this conversation Katharine&#xD;
had not heard. She had moved away to the&#xD;
other fire, and was talking to Mr. Warwick about&#xD;
~Jack's skating. So her surprise was entirely un-&#xD;
affected when Annesley's voice spoke her name,&#xD;
and, turning, she saw him standhg close beside&#xD;
her, with a beautiful, golden-haired vision lean-&#xD;
ing on his arm.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham," he said, hurriedly, "allow&#xD;
me to present Miss Vernon. She is anxious to&#xD;
make your acquaintance, and-"&#xD;
"Hopes you do not object to having it&#xD;
taken by storm," interrupted Miss Vernon, offer-&#xD;
ing her hand. "You must excuse me, if this&#xD;
is an unceremonious proceeding, Miss Tresham;&#xD;
but I am very anxious to know you, and I hope&#xD;
you do not object to knowing me."&#xD;
&#xD;
It would have been hard to do so under the&#xD;
influence of that gracious smile-for Irene Ver.&#xD;
non could be very gracious when she chose-and&#xD;
Katharine answered, with her usual simplicity&#xD;
of word and tone:&#xD;
"You do me too much honor, Miss Vernon.&#xD;
I am very glad to know you"&#xD;
"Are you?" asked Miss Vernon. "Is not&#xD;
that speech a mere effort of courtesy?"&#xD;
"It may be an effort of courtesy," answered&#xD;
Katharine, smiling; "but it is true, also."&#xD;
"Then I may congratulate myself upon mak-&#xD;
ing a favorable impression for once in my life,"&#xD;
said the young lady. "People don't usually~ike&#xD;
me when they first know me; in fact; some of&#xD;
them don't ever like me at all."&#xD;
"Don't they?" said Katharine, amused at&#xD;
'this frank confesaion~ "That is strange; for I&#xD;
should think you would always be liked."&#xD;
"Are you always liked?"&#xD;
"Well-really, I don't know. But I think I&#xD;
am rather popular-at least with these." And&#xD;
she laid her hand on Katy's curly head.&#xD;
" Their good-will is not worth ~ said&#xD;
Miss Vernon, carelessly. "It is so cheap-a few&#xD;
sugar-plums will buy it."&#xD;
"And won't different sugar-plums buy the&#xD;
good-will of older people just as easily?" asked&#xD;
Morton, abruptly.&#xD;
"So you have turned cynic!" said Miss Ver-&#xD;
non, glancing round at him. "I thought you&#xD;
left 'that to mc."&#xD;
"Doh't slander my favorite objects of trust,&#xD;
then," answered he, laughing. "I must be-&#xD;
lieve in children, or in nobody.-Katy, don't&#xD;
you mean to come and kiss me?"&#xD;
While Katy, nowiBe loath, went to bestow this&#xD;
favor, Miss Vernon turned with a shrug to her&#xD;
new acquaintance.&#xD;
"I wonder if he thinks that child would like&#xD;
him if he were poor and ugly?"&#xD;
"She likes me," said Katharine, smiling,&#xD;
"and I am neither rich nor beautiful."&#xD;
"You are lovable, though, and that is bet-&#xD;
ter than either," said Miss Vernon, with a slight&#xD;
sigh.&#xD;
Katharine looked up in surprise; but, be-&#xD;
fore she could answer this unexpected conipli-&#xD;
mont, the young lady had turned to MTr War-&#xD;
wick, and was asking him if he meant to skate.&#xD;
"I?" he said, laughing. "What hat'o I&#xD;
done, Miss Vernon, that you should suspect me&#xD;
of such an indiscretion?"&#xD;
"You have worn a pair of skates, Mr. Wae.&#xD;

few minutes before had, made 'his appearance on around the jutting point of land.&#xD;
the ice. He was, indeed, without peer; the very  Miss Vernon laughed---.she evidently sym-&#xD;
spirit of grace seemed to animate his motions, pathized with the bravery of this open rebellion&#xD;
and his skating was such as is never seen out - while Mrs. French, who was standing by,&#xD;
of a northern latitude, and of whichthe inhabit- shrugged her shoulders significantly.&#xD;
ants of southern latitudes can f9rm, at best, but "People can't manage to conduct a flirtation&#xD;
a fanit conception. The lithe young figure was and take care of a child at the same time," aba&#xD;
&#xD;
said to her husband, in a tone sufficiently audible&#xD;
for Morton to hear.&#xD;
But Morton took no notice of the remark.&#xD;
He only turned round to the by-standers, and&#xD;
asked if anybody could lend him a pair of&#xD;
skates.&#xD;
Unfortunately, nobody was able to do so.&#xD;
Skates were very scarce articles, and whoever&#xD;
was so fortunate as to own a pair1 lent them to&#xD;
his friends by turns-an arrangement which re-&#xD;
sulted in the temporary possessor being worried&#xD;
out of all his enjoyment by two or three impa-&#xD;
tient candidates who wanted to know "if he&#xD;
meant to keep going all day, or if he didn't&#xD;
mean to give anybody else a chance to do some&#xD;
skating?" Therefore, all shook their heads&#xD;
when Morton made his request, and several&#xD;
voices replied that Tom Jones had a pair of&#xD;
skates, but that Frank Smith was using them.&#xD;
"What do you want to do, Mr. Annesley?"&#xD;
Katharine asked.&#xD;
"I want to go after the little scamp," Annes-&#xD;
Icy replied. "I ought to have paid more atten-&#xD;
tion to him; but how could I think of his play-&#xD;
ing me such a trick, when he knew, too, that&#xD;
only my persuasion induced his mother to let&#xD;
him come?"&#xD;
"This is very ungrateful conduct, then."&#xD;
"Is it not ?-Katy, run yonder to that knoll,&#xD;
and see if he is coming back."&#xD;
Katy obeyed, bounding up on the rising&#xD;
ground at the headland, where a stately group&#xD;
of young pines stood like sentinels; and, in a&#xD;
few minutes, returned with the intelligence that&#xD;
he was coming back.&#xD;
"You will not need to go, after all," said&#xD;
Miss Vernon to Annesley.&#xD;
"That remains to he seen," he answered.&#xD;
"I don't much think he will come to shore of&#xD;
his own accord.-Thank you, Price." This to&#xD;
a young man who handed him a pair of sluites&#xD;
over two or three intervening shoulders. Then,&#xD;
while he sat down to buckle them on, Felix came&#xD;
bearing back into sight-a more beautiful pie.&#xD;
ture than ever, all alone in his childish grace on&#xD;
the glittering expanse of ice.&#xD;
"Oh, the little darling!" cried several enthu-&#xD;
siastic young ladies; while the boys of all ages&#xD;
stared in open-mouthed, admiring wonder of his&#xD;
skilL&#xD;
"Is he coming to shore?" asked Morton, who&#xD;
could not see, partly because he was sitting on the&#xD;
ground, and partly because several people were&#xD;
standing before him. Two or three voices an-&#xD;
swered the question-not very satisfactorily.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I think so."&#xD;
"No, he isn't."&#xD;
"There he goes-he's oft' again."&#xD;
"That's splendid! That is skating!"&#xD;
"He's bound up the pond this time."&#xD;
"Yes," said Katharine, to whom Morton&#xD;
looked inquiringly. "He certainly has no inten-&#xD;
tion of coming to the shore. He is going up&#xD;
the pond at a rapid rate."&#xD;
"lt's a pity somebody' can't make him come&#xD;
back," said a man's voice near. "All skating is&#xD;
something of a risk to-day; but the ice is very&#xD;
unsafe in that direction."&#xD;
"Are you sure of that, Mr. Mills?" asked&#xD;
Morton, starting to his feet.&#xD;
"Very sure, sir," answered Mr. Mills, grave-&#xD;
ly. "My wagon was hauling ice from there this&#xD;
morning, and I don't think it would have borne&#xD;
the weight of a man then."&#xD;
Morton made no answer, but Katharine saw&#xD;
that he changed color, and immediately swung&#xD;
himself down the bank, which happened to be&#xD;
quite high just there. The next minute he was&#xD;
gliding over the ice with a swift, steady case of&#xD;
movement which proved his own proficiency&#xD;
quite equal to that of Felix. A chorus of ad-&#xD;
miration followed him; but the young man evi-&#xD;
dently heard none of it. He was bending every&#xD;
nerve in pursuit of the gay little will.o'.the-wisp&#xD;
who fleeted forward all the faster when he per.&#xD;
ceived that a chase had been instituted. Away&#xD;
went the two figures up the pond, the pursuer&#xD;
steadily gaining on the pursued, and both near-&#xD;
ing fast the dangerous ice of which Mr. Mills had&#xD;
spoken. Once Annesley paused and uttered&#xD;
something half-warning, half-command; but the&#xD;
young insurgent paid no attention to it, and the&#xD;
only result was that it lost Morton several yards -&#xD;
of distance. When he started again, however,&#xD;
he seemed scarcely to totich the ice, and the in-&#xD;
terest of the spectators had reached a very ex-&#xD;
citing point when a cry of mingled dismay and&#xD;
triumph rose from a knot of boys on the water's&#xD;
edge.&#xD;
"He's got him!"&#xD;
"No, he hasn't!"&#xD;
"Hurrah! He's slipped away!"&#xD;
"Well done, little one!"&#xD;
And Katharine looked in time to see Felix&#xD;
dart out of the grasp Morton laid on him, and,&#xD;
shooting under the outstretched arm, skate away&#xD;
faster than ever, leaving only his scarf as trophy&#xD;
in the disappointed captor's hands.&#xD;
"Well done, indeed i" cried Mips Vernon,&#xD;
with a ringing laugh of enjoyment. "I am so&#xD;

glad he got away. I should be so sorry if&#xD;
ended. It is better than horse-racing, and&#xD;
adore that! Who will make a bet ?.-Adela, wi&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"Certainly not," replied Mrs. French, severe&#xD;
ly. "I think it is disgusting. Morton ought t&#xD;
have more dignity than to make such an exhibit&#xD;
tion of himself. I really think-"&#xD;
But Miss Vernon was already speaking ti&#xD;
Katharine.&#xD;
"Miss Treshamn, will you? As many pairs ol&#xD;
gloycs as you please on the Gordon plaid."&#xD;
"Do you mean Mr. Annesley?" asked Katha&#xD;
rine, laughing. "He has the Gordon plaid ni&#xD;
present."&#xD;
"No, indeed; I mean on the rightful ownei&#xD;
of the Gordon plaid. Bless his brave little&#xD;
heart? Where is he now I"'&#xD;
"Yonder he is," said Mr. Warwick, who wam&#xD;
standing by, a quiet and much-interested specta.&#xD;
tor. "ilut Almesley is gaining very fast upon&#xD;
him; so perhaps you had better not register&#xD;
your bet just at present. See! he almost laid&#xD;
hold of him. There, now he has doubled again.&#xD;
After .J), you may-my God!"&#xD;
A sudden wild cry from Mrs. French-a mur-&#xD;
mur of horrorfrom the erowd-and out on the ice,&#xD;
where there had been two figures a moment be-&#xD;
fore, only-one.&#xD;
This was a terror-stricken child, while, where&#xD;
the ice had broken through, there still floated&#xD;
one fringed end of the Gordon plaid. On the&#xD;
shore, a rush, a commotion, a sound of many&#xD;
voices, and a lady in violent hysterics.&#xD;
Katharine never knew much of what ensued.&#xD;
She heard Mr. Warwick's tones take the lend,&#xD;
and bring aome quiet out of the uproar; she&#xD;
saw a confused mass of men and boys dash&#xD;
across the ice with a reckless disregard of dan-&#xD;
ger, and she sat down sick and shuddering to&#xD;
await the result.&#xD;
Miss Vernon sat down by her, Neither said&#xD;
any thing, yet there is no doubt that each was&#xD;
conseibus of the presence of the other. Mr.&#xD;
French, meanwhile, had left his wife to get out&#xD;
of her hysterics as best she could, and had gone&#xD;
to the rescue with the rest; so, finding nobody&#xD;
to take any notice of her, she somewhat sub.&#xD;
sided, and stood sobbing and asking questions&#xD;
which it was impossible for any one to answer&#xD;
yet.&#xD;
To those watchers on the shore it seemed&#xD;
hours, but it was in reality only a short time be-&#xD;
fore the many strong arms which broke up the&#xD;
ice and buffeted the water so bravely, gained&#xD;
&#xD;
t their reward-before they raised to the surfitee&#xD;
I and bore shoreward, with a rush of triumph,&#xD;
11 that which seemed so awfully still and white&#xD;
when they laid it down at Katharine Treshaza's&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
o     They said it was not Deatb, but she could&#xD;
scarcely believe it was Life, when she looked at&#xD;
the pale face with the wet hair clinging round&#xD;
' it,'and at those rigid hands which still grasped&#xD;
the silken scarf.&#xD;
But, even while she looked, there came a&#xD;
long, gurgling sigh through the half.parted lips&#xD;
- -the lids slowly lifted-the dark eyes gazed up&#xD;
at her pitying countenance as if in a bewildered&#xD;
dream-and her name was spoken with that ten-&#xD;
der, yearning accent which would make any name&#xD;
of earth beautiful.&#xD;
"Katharine!"&#xD;
Then, before sh~ could utter one word, they&#xD;
closed again, and Mr. Warwick said:&#xD;
"He has fainted!"&#xD;
A little while later, after Mr. Annesley was&#xD;
sufficiently recovered to thai~k his rescuers,&#xD;
to answer all the inquiries of his friends, to&#xD;
enter his carriage, and be driven home, Mr.&#xD;
Warwick came up to Katharine, and asked&#xD;
her if she felt inclined to perform a deed of&#xD;
charity.&#xD;
"It depends a good deal upon the amount of&#xD;
exertion required," she answered, with a smile.&#xD;
"Iam a little tired. But let me hear what it&#xD;
Is.&#xD;
He pointed to Felix, who stood at a little dis-&#xD;
tance the centre of an admiring group, and quite&#xD;
as nonchalant as ever~&#xD;
"I promised Morton to take that young gen-&#xD;
tleman home, and to give as mild a rendering of&#xD;
his exploit as is at all consistent with truth. Rut&#xD;
I begin to doubt my diplomatic ability. I think&#xD;
you could do him more service than I; and, in&#xD;
short, I want you to take the matter off my&#xD;
hands. Will you?"&#xD;
Katharine looked slightly aghast.&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick, Iwould be glad to oblige you,&#xD;
but-but I am a mere stranger---and Morton.&#xD;
House!"&#xD;
"That is the very reason why I ask you,"&#xD;
said Mr. Warwick, coolly. "Considering all&#xD;
things, I think a mere stranger might be more&#xD;
welcome in Morton House than an old aoqu~dnt.&#xD;
ance like myself. Will you go?"&#xD;
She hesitated a minute longer. Then, re-&#xD;
membering what might be his reason for wishing&#xD;
to avoid Mrs. Gordon, answered quickly: -&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, if you think I can do any good, I will&#xD;
go."&#xD;
"If you cannot, I am sure it will be for the&#xD;
first time," he answered, smiling. "Yonder&#xD;
comes the carriage which Annesley promised to&#xD;
send back, so you see you have no time to&#xD;
change your jnind. Let me put you in, and see&#xD;
you oil'. Then I will take the children home."&#xD;
He put her in, called Felix and presented&#xD;
him, closed the door, watched them drive away,&#xD;
and never thought, until long afterward, that he&#xD;
was the direct means of first bringing Katharine&#xD;
Tresham under the roof of Morton House.&#xD;
CHAPTER XL&#xD;
AT MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
THE whole of that afternoon, which looked so&#xD;
bright to the gay loiterers beside the pond, Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon had spent in the silence and shadow of&#xD;
the Morton-House library, deep in dusty and&#xD;
tedious accounts which had been submitted to&#xD;
her inspection by Mr. Shields, the agent of the&#xD;
Morton estate. It was not a pleasant occupa-&#xD;
tion, hut it was one to which she had courageous-&#xD;
ly set herself immediately on her arrival, and in&#xD;
which she had not flagged even when the terri-&#xD;
bly-involved condition of affairs had been brought&#xD;
plainly to her perception. Debt, difficulty, mort-&#xD;
gage, ruinous sacrifice! That was the sum-tolal&#xD;
of the heritage to which she had returned; and,&#xD;
what the old agent unhesitatingly called '~the&#xD;
most tangled business in the country," was what&#xD;
she took in her woman's hands to attempt to&#xD;
make straight again. She succeeded better than&#xD;
might have been expected-succeeded sufficiently&#xD;
to rouse Mr. Shields's honest admiration, and&#xD;
make him tell Lawyer Worruck that he had never&#xD;
seen such business capacity in any woman be-&#xD;
fore. But it was weary work at all times, and&#xD;
never more weery than on this afternoon. So&#xD;
weary that, when she came to the end of a long&#xD;
column of figures, she dropped her pen with a&#xD;
tired sigh, and, leaning her head against the&#xD;
back of her chair, sat motionless for some&#xD;
time. -&#xD;
On this repose, however, Babette broke in&#xD;
suddenly and unceremoniously, just as the last&#xD;
rays of the setting sun flashed a gleam of vivid&#xD;
light across the pale, tired face.&#xD;
"Madame, pardorrnez-moi," she began, hur-&#xD;
riedly, as her mistress's eyes opened wide in some-&#xD;
what haughty astonishment. "But madame al-&#xD;
&#xD;
ways said that if any thing~happened to M'sieur&#xD;
Felix, she must be disturbed, and I dared not-"&#xD;
"Felix!" cried the)nother, with a sudden&#xD;
start of alarm. "Felix! Is any thing the mat-&#xD;
ter with him?"&#xD;
"Indeed, madame, it was not my fault; but&#xD;
that stupid-"&#xD;
"Babette! Is any thing the matter?"&#xD;
"Non, madame, non," cried the maid, startled&#xD;
by the tone of her mistress's voice. "M'sieur&#xD;
Felix is all safe-but that stupid Harrison has let&#xD;
in a. lady."&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon gave a deep sigh of relief.&#xD;
"You frightened me very much," she said,&#xD;
rebukingly. "You should not talk so much at&#xD;
random. What has Felix to do with a lady?&#xD;
He is at the pond with Mr. Annesley."&#xD;
"But, madame, the lady has brought him&#xD;
home."&#xD;
"The lady! You must be mistaken."&#xD;
"Indeed, no, madame. I saw them; and&#xD;
that stupid "&#xD;
"Then it is Mrs. Annesley?"&#xD;
Babette shook her head. "C'est une demoi-&#xD;
sells," she said decidedly. "I saw her myself,&#xD;
madame; and M'sieur Felix-"&#xD;
"Hold your tongue?" cried a shrill, indig-&#xD;
nant voice at the door. And the next moment,&#xD;
"M'sieur Felix" himself had rushed into the&#xD;
room, and thrown his arms round his mother.&#xD;
"Mamma, don't listen to h~r! i'll tell you&#xD;
all about it-but promise first you won't be&#xD;
angry."&#xD;
"That depends on whether there is good&#xD;
cause for being angry," said his mother, push-&#xD;
ing back the bright curls from the glowing face,&#xD;
and looking anxiously into it. "But I can&#xD;
promise not to be very much displeased if you&#xD;
will tell me the exact truth."&#xD;
"That's what 1 mean to do, mamma. But&#xD;
lilsa me first, and-go away!" he added, with a&#xD;
sudden stamp at Babette.&#xD;
The Frenchwoman looked unutterable things&#xD;
at him, tossed her head, and held her ground&#xD;
firmly, until Mrs. Gordon herself bade hem~ go.&#xD;
"But the lady, madame?"&#xD;
"I will see her in a minute-you need, not&#xD;
wait."&#xD;
Babette gave another glanceat Felix, and then&#xD;
retired, with offended dignity rustling in every&#xD;
garment. Her only solace was to go and rate&#xD;
Harrison, and this she immediately proceeded to&#xD;
do.&#xD;
Katharine, meanwhile, left alone in the large&#xD;
empty drawing-room, began to revolve the awk-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8070-00000031"/>&#xD;
54;                       MORTON HOUSE.                                                           AT MORTON RoUSE.                       55&#xD;
&#xD;
warduess of her position. She was sorry noiv&#xD;
that she had acceded to Mr. Warwick's request.&#xD;
It seemed so much like forcing an entrance into&#xD;
Morton House. As for mediation or explanation&#xD;
-Felix's impetuosity had spared her all ques-&#xD;
tion of that. Was nobody ever coming? Would&#xD;
it be very wrong to go away without having&#xD;
seen the lady of the house? Perhaps, after all,&#xD;
that might be best. She would wait ten min-&#xD;
utes longer, and, if by that time Mrs. Gordon&#xD;
had not made her appearance, why-she would&#xD;
go. She had hardly arrived at this determina-&#xD;
tion, when the ~door opened, and a pale, stately&#xD;
woman stood on the threshold.&#xD;
Katharine rose, but before she could utter&#xD;
one of the words of apology trembling on her&#xD;
tongue, Mrs. Gordon crossed the floor, and ex-&#xD;
tended her hand with a warm and cordial ges-&#xD;
ture.&#xD;
£~ Miss Tresham, I owe you many thanks. It&#xD;
was kind of you to take charge of my wilful boy.&#xD;
Pray forgive me that I have kept you waiting;&#xD;
but he has been giving me an account of his ad-&#xD;
ventured"&#xD;
This, or something like it, was what she said;&#xD;
but no words can embody the gracious and ex-&#xD;
quisite charm of manner which at once set Kath-&#xD;
arine at ease-at once made her feel that, instead&#xD;
of being an intruder, she was a welcome guest.&#xD;
A few words told why the duty had devolved&#xD;
upon herself-a few more gave the leading facts&#xD;
of the matter; after which, she rose to take her&#xD;
departure. But this Mrs. Gordon would not per-&#xD;
mit.&#xD;
"You are cold, and you must be tired," she&#xD;
said. "It is a point of hbnorwith Morton House&#xD;
that no guest has ever left its door in either of&#xD;
those conditions. This room is my aversion, it&#xD;
is so cheerless. Let me take you to my sitting.&#xD;
"You are very kind," said Katharine, over-&#xD;
come with wonder; "but the carriage is waiting&#xD;
for me, and-"&#xD;
"If you will allow me, I will have it dis-&#xD;
missed, and take the responsibility of sending&#xD;
you home."&#xD;
"I am afraid Mrs. Marks will be uneasy."&#xD;
"I am sure she will be able to spare you,"&#xD;
said the lady, with a slight smile. "Come, Miss&#xD;
Treshas~, I am not accustomed to pressing hos-&#xD;
pitality~ but in this instance I really cannot con-&#xD;
sent to let you go. Shall I put my request on&#xD;
another ground? Shall I tell yew that I am&#xD;
lonely this evening, and that a strange face is a&#xD;
great relief to me? I have not felt~this desire&#xD;
&#xD;
for companionship before in many a long day.&#xD;
Will you have the heart to disappoint it now?"&#xD;
"No,"said Katharine, with her frank, bright&#xD;
smile. "If my society can gratify your desire, I&#xD;
shall be very glad to stay. But-"&#xD;
"But I regard the matter as settled," said&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon. Then, after ringing the bell, and&#xD;
sending an order of dismissal to the waiting car-&#xD;
riage, she led the way across a large, cold hall,&#xD;
into one of the most thoroughly-charming rooms,&#xD;
Katharine thought, she had ever seen.&#xD;
A first glance only gave the impression of rich&#xD;
color and luxurious comfort. It was some time&#xD;
before the eye recognized the different elements&#xD;
that went to make up such an attractive whole&#xD;
-the heavy curtains, the velvet carpet, the deep,&#xD;
inviting chairs and touches, the many appoint-&#xD;
ments where taste of the most rare and judicious&#xD;
kind had presided. When Katharine entered, it&#xD;
was empty, but a faint fragrance of flowers came&#xD;
over her as the door opened, and a soft moonlight&#xD;
seemed to fill the room-the glow of two large&#xD;
lamps being toned by tinted shades. Dusk had&#xD;
fallen by this time; and the lamp-light and ruddy&#xD;
firelight made a pleasant contrast to the cold,&#xD;
frosty night gathering outside the open hall-&#xD;
door, and melting into indistinctness the out-&#xD;
lines of the rolling hills.&#xD;
"Oh, what a beautiful room!" cried Kath-&#xD;
arine, so involuntarily that Mrs. Gordon smiled.&#xD;
"I am glad you like it,". she said. "It is&#xD;
th~e oviy room I have refurnished; but I cannot&#xD;
endure the stiff' old-fashioned furniture which&#xD;
reigns paramount in the rest of the house. Ex-&#xD;
cepting my cousin, Mr. Annesley, you are the only&#xD;
person who has been admitted here."&#xD;
"It is beautiful I" Katharine repeated, as&#xD;
she sat down by the glowing fire, sunning her-&#xD;
self like a tropical flower in its heat. "I have&#xD;
never seen any thing more luxurious-and I love&#xD;
luxury.)~&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon smiled again, perhaps at this&#xD;
candid confession, perhaps at the undisguised&#xD;
enjoyment which prompted it Then she drew&#xD;
forward a large chair, and seating herself, leaned&#xD;
back in its soft depths. The firelight played&#xD;
quiveringly over her face, and Katharine had&#xD;
time to mark every furrow which marred its&#xD;
beauty before Mrs. Gordon spoke again. At last&#xD;
she turned to look at the young girl, and said,&#xD;
rather abruptly:&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, my desire to keep you was&#xD;
not entirely without reason. I have heard Mor-&#xD;
ton Annesley speak of you very often, audi was&#xD;
sure of one thing-either that I must like you,&#xD;
&#xD;
or that~ he exaggerated as even a lover has no&#xD;
right to exaggerate."&#xD;
Katharine started. This was plain speaking,&#xD;
indeed. She started, and, if she also blushed, it&#xD;
might have been surprise as much as any thing&#xD;
else that caused the emotion.&#xD;
" Excuse me," said Mrs. Gordon, who noticed&#xD;
both the start and the blush. "Perhaps I have&#xD;
not paid sufficient regard to the proprieties of&#xD;
expression; but when one grows a little old,&#xD;
they seem so useless. Why should we hesitate&#xD;
to call a thing by its right name?"&#xD;
"Why, indeed," answered Katharine, quick-&#xD;
ly, "if it be a right name?"&#xD;
"We won't argue that point," said Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon, with a slight laugh. "I don't think a&#xD;
lover's tale is worth telling, excepting by him-&#xD;
self. And here comes tea."&#xD;
The door opened as she spoke, and Harri-&#xD;
son brought in a tray. No other servant ap-&#xD;
peared; but in a few minutes-without even so&#xD;
much noise as the rattling of a plate-a small&#xD;
round table stood between the two ladies, bear-&#xD;
ing a glittering equipage.&#xD;
"Are you still English enough to prefer tea,&#xD;
Miss Tresham, or will y~u let Harrison give you&#xD;
a cup of coffee?" asked Mrs. Gordon, as she&#xD;
poured out a cup of the first, which was strong&#xD;
enough and black enough to have satisfied even&#xD;
Dc Quincey. "For my part, I always take this.&#xD;
Will you join n~e 7"&#xD;
"Not since you have given me my choice,"&#xD;
said Katharine, with a smile. "I have never&#xD;
yet learned to endure tea-though 1 have tri~d&#xD;
heroically, in compliment to other people's&#xD;
taste."&#xD;
"Not people here, surely?"&#xD;
"Oh, no. Everybody here drinks coffee. I&#xD;
meant the people in England."&#xD;
"And yet you are an Englishwoman?"&#xD;
"No; I am a West-Indian-and very proud&#xD;
of it. I love my dear island, with its brilliant&#xD;
skies and tropical palms, as much as I hate the&#xD;
mists and fogs of England."&#xD;
"You have been in England, then?"&#xD;
Katharine shrugged her shoulders ruefully.&#xD;
"To my cost, yes."&#xD;
"In what part? I ask because I am very&#xD;
familiar with it, and perhaps you saw the coun-&#xD;
try to disadvantage."&#xD;
"1 was in the north, near the Scottish border.&#xD;
I saw the Scottish shore from my window every&#xD;
time the fog lifted, and did not enjoy it nearly as&#xD;
much as I should have done if I could have&#xD;
stopped shivering even for one day."&#xD;
&#xD;
"But was there no summer while you were&#xD;
there?"&#xD;
"There was a time they called summer-a&#xD;
time when the trees had leaves, and the sun&#xD;
shone with tolerable brightness. But our winter.&#xD;
days in Porte Rico are much more balmy."&#xD;
"Porte Rico! But I thought-that is-"&#xD;
You thought I was a British West-Indian.&#xD;
Well, so I am. I was born in Jamaica; but I&#xD;
scarcely remember it at all. When I Was very&#xD;
young, my aunt moved to Porte Rico, and took&#xD;
me with her. We lived there entirely, and I&#xD;
never was in England until I went to an old&#xD;
friend of hers, who obtained a situation as gov-&#xD;
erness at Donthorne Place for me. It was a&#xD;
very-"&#xD;
She stopped-uncontrollable surprise forcing&#xD;
her to do so. Mrs. Gordon had suddenly turned&#xD;
so pale that even the dim light failed to conceal&#xD;
it, and her hand shook until she was obliged to&#xD;
put down untasted a cup of tea which she had&#xD;
been in the act of raising to her lips. There&#xD;
was a moment's silence; then she looked up,&#xD;
white as a sheet, but forcing herself into a sort&#xD;
of rigid calm.&#xD;
"Pardon me, Miss Tresham; and pray don't&#xD;
look so much alarmed. It is only an old pain&#xD;
that came back to me just then. My nerves are&#xD;
shattered, and I show it-that is all.-Harrison,&#xD;
you will find my case on the side-table there.&#xD;
Give me two spoonfuls of the bottle on the right&#xD;
as you open it."&#xD;
Harrison obeyed. Mrs. Gordon drank eager-&#xD;
ly the dark liquid which he brought her in a&#xD;
slender wineglass; and a faint, subtle odor&#xD;
rushed over Katharine, which told her at once&#xD;
what the draught had been. After that she&#xD;
needed one explanation the leSs for the lines&#xD;
on her hostess's face.&#xD;
It was the latter who, after a short silence,&#xD;
spoke first-quietly, but with a certain sup-&#xD;
pressed anxiety which Katharine's ear was quick&#xD;
to detect.&#xD;
"You surprised me very much by the men-&#xD;
tion of Donthorne Place, Miss Tresham. I was&#xD;
once in the neighborhood, and I remember~ it&#xD;
quite well. How long were you there?"&#xD;
"A year," answered Katharine, concisely,&#xD;
having her own reasons for reticence on the&#xD;
subject; "a year-oae of the most disagreeable&#xD;
of my life, and one that I would not live over&#xD;
again to win a crown. I cannot bear to talk of&#xD;
it, and, of course, it does not interest you."&#xD;
"On the contrary, if you will pardon me, it&#xD;
interests me very much. Do you "-she leaned&#xD;

"Katharine looked up with an astonishment when I remeixiher how gentle he is to 'his sister&#xD;

She could scarcely believe that these cordial Mrs. Gordon looked at her with a smile.&#xD;
words of invitation were addressed to herself "You are his friend, I perceive," she said.&#xD;
by the saree lips that had declined the visits of "I ought to be," the girl answered, quickly,&#xD;
all' the old hereditary friends who had a right to with the remembrance of what he had said to her&#xD;
entein~ Morton House. The cordiality was in Mrs. that afternoon stirring warmly at her heart. "In.&#xD;
Gordon's eyes as well as in Mrs. Gordon's tones, gratitude has never been one, of my many faults."&#xD;
however. So, after a short pause, she answered, "I hoped he would have married long before&#xD;
with the frank grace that all her life had won this," said the other, with a wistful light in her&#xD;
for her ~o much liking: eyes, that Katharine was not slow to interpret.&#xD;
"Indeed, you are very kind, and I shall be "I do not know any one whom I should better&#xD;

that is all he wants. No one need pity him for&#xD;
imaginary loneliness."&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon enclosed her lips, as if to reply;&#xD;
hut, before she could do so, the door opened,&#xD;
and Harrison startled them by the announce-&#xD;
ment that Mr. Warwick had come for Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am.&#xD;
Katharine started up at once, full of self-&#xD;
reproach.&#xD;
"How very inconsiderate of me to have&#xD;
stayed!" she cried, eagerly. "I might have&#xD;
known they would be uneasy; and it is such&#xD;
a long walk to have given Mr. Warwick! How&#xD;
very, very inconsiderate of me!"&#xD;
She repeated the last expression several&#xD;
times, for her vexation was not least in the&#xD;
thought that she had forced upon Mr. Warwick&#xD;
the very thing he wished to avoid, and brought&#xD;
him to the very house he least desired to enter.&#xD;
"Don't look so distressed and penitent," said&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon. "It was my fault, not yours; and&#xD;
I am sure he will not mind the walk, especially&#xD;
as he need .nnt repeat it.-Harrison, order the&#xD;
carriage, and show Mr. Warwick in here."&#xD;
"No! no!" cried Katharine, hastily. "He&#xD;
has had so much trouble about mc, pray let me&#xD;
go to him at once, and-and not keep him wait.&#xD;
ing. I shall not mind the walk at all."&#xD;
She was drawing her wrappings around her&#xD;
as she spoke, and evidently meant to go at once,&#xD;
if Mrs. Gordon had not interfered very decidedly.&#xD;
"I will not hear of such a thing," she said.&#xD;
"You must wait for the carriage, and I must&#xD;
send for Mr. Warwick.-Harrison, show him in&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
Evidently, Mrs. Gordon had been accustomed&#xD;
to the habit of command. Her quiet tones had&#xD;
so much authority in them that Katharine found&#xD;
herself yielding without a word. She sank into&#xD;
her seat, and the next minute Mr. Warwick en-&#xD;
tered the room.&#xD;
Whatever he felt, he certainly showed nothing&#xD;
beyond gentlemanly self.posscssion, as he came&#xD;
forward, meeting Mrs. Gordon's cordially-extend-&#xD;
ed hand with his own, and answering her words&#xD;
of welcome so easily that Katharine felt relieved.&#xD;
What she expected, she could not have told; but&#xD;
certainly something unlike this. Not any falter.&#xD;
ing, or trembling, or turning pale-she knew the&#xD;
grave, reserved lawyer too well to fear that-but&#xD;
at least some token that his pulses were beating&#xD;
as fast as they surely must beat in presence of&#xD;
the woman who, for twenty-five years (if his&#xD;
Sister spoke truth), had stood between him and&#xD;
&#xD;
all thought of other women-some token differ-&#xD;
ent from the quiet presence of every day, from&#xD;
the cool glance that saw so much, and the terse&#xD;
speech that said so little-yet they were all&#xD;
there, and as mnch unchanged as if Pauline&#xD;
Morton's eyes were not looking into his face&#xD;
from the grave of the past.&#xD;
Presently he crossed over to Katherine and&#xD;
stopped at once the words of penitence with&#xD;
which she was prepared to greet him.&#xD;
"No," he said, "you must not. think any&#xD;
thing of thekind. I came because I wanted to&#xD;
-and a little because Bessie has been uneasy.&#xD;
You know how highly developed her nervous&#xD;
system is. Well, she has been arranging the&#xD;
programme of a very tragic entertainment-Mr.&#xD;
Annesley's horses running away, and leaving you&#xD;
senseless and bleeding in some wayside ditch."&#xD;
"I am very sorry," said Katharine, toomuch&#xD;
disturbed to laugh. "It is very kind of Mrs*&#xD;
Marks to take the trouble to be uneasy about&#xD;
me-I am very sorry. I ought to have thought,&#xD;
Mr. Warwick; and then you nee4 not have had&#xD;
all this trouble."&#xD;
"I told you a minute ago that it wasno trou-&#xD;
ble," he said, a little shortly. Andy as Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
don advanced, he turned and began 'speaking&#xD;
about Felix.&#xD;
"He is quite the hero of the hour," he said.&#xD;
"In fact, he has taken Tallahoma so entirely by&#xD;
storm, that I hope, for the sake of example, you&#xD;
will not let him enter the town to-morrow-he&#xD;
would certainly receive a popular ovation."&#xD;
"He is not likely to leave the grounds of the&#xD;
House for some time to come," answered his&#xD;
mother, gravely. "I have had a lesson by which&#xD;
I shall profit. Felix's management has been a&#xD;
point at issue between Morton and myself, and&#xD;
the occurrence of this afternoon has showed me&#xD;
that I am right and he is wrong."&#xD;
"May I not. intercede on the side of mercy?"&#xD;
said Mr. Warwick, half jestingly, half in earliest.&#xD;
"You will not think me presumptuous, I 'am sure,&#xD;
when I tell you that nothing so much shames,&#xD;
or so soon cures untrustworthiness.-even the&#xD;
slight, childish form of it which Felix showed&#xD;
this afternoon-.-.as the sense of being trusted."&#xD;
She looked up .at him, with a deep flush on&#xD;
her pale cheeks, and a sudden light in her eyes,&#xD;
that startled both Katharine and himself.&#xD;
"You speak of what you l~now," she said, In&#xD;
a low voice. "You speak of those' in whom'the&#xD;
sense of honor, and the power of being shamed,&#xD;
is born. But you don't speak of, you don't&#xD;
know, the blood that child has in his veins. I&#xD;

"Excuse me," he said, hastily. "1 did not&#xD;

She interrupted him., "Any thing but kind-&#xD;
ness, I know-only you don't understand. Now&#xD;
tell me if you have heard from' Morton. I sent&#xD;
to inquire, and the answer Was very satisfactory&#xD;
-but I fear he may have sent it merely to quiet&#xD;
my uneasiness."&#xD;
"Hardly. No doubt he is well by this tim6,&#xD;
and probably will make his appearance to answer&#xD;
for himself to-morrow..---Miss Tresham, I am at&#xD;
your service whenever you feel inclined for the&#xD;
walk before us."&#xD;
"The carriage-" began Mrs. Gordon.&#xD;
But, at that moment, Harrison once more&#xD;
opened the door, and announced that the car-&#xD;
riage was waiting.&#xD;
"You will come to see me, will you not?"&#xD;
asked the lady, as Katharine bade her good-&#xD;
night. "I don't like to see you go, without an&#xD;
assurance that you will return."&#xD;
"I will certainly come," said Katharine, with&#xD;
a smile even more bright than usual.&#xD;
After a few words they took leave, and Miss&#xD;
Tresham found herself xolliug rapidly along the&#xD;
road to Tallahoma, and assuring Mr. Warwick&#xD;
that she felt much less tired than excited by her&#xD;
unusual adventures.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE TUG or WAit.&#xD;
Tes morning after his escape from drown-&#xD;
ing, Morton Annesley woke with that uncom-&#xD;
fortable' *eight on his mind-that pense of some-&#xD;
thing disagreeable, either past or impending-&#xD;
with which every one is familiar who has ever&#xD;
sought sleep rather as a refuge from tormenting&#xD;
thou~t, than as that "sweet restorer" which&#xD;
Nature intended it should be.&#xD;
For the space of several minutes he could not&#xD;
think what had occurred; then suddenly a throng&#xD;
of recollections rushed over him; he recalled&#xD;
every thing that had happened. He remembered&#xD;
the adventure at the pond, and the scene thnt&#xD;
followed his rescue; he remembered the looks&#xD;
and tones of the people who had addressed him;&#xD;
and, above all, he remembered the expression of&#xD;
Katharine Tresham's eyes, when, for one brief&#xD;
second, he glanced up into them! With a sharp,&#xD;
impatient exclamation he sprang up and began&#xD;
&#xD;
to dress. Some reminiscences prick worse than&#xD;
needles, and to him there could scarcely have&#xD;
been a more disagreeable reminiscence than this.&#xD;
Not even Katharine's eyes could take the sting&#xD;
out of it! There was such a mock heroism about&#xD;
the whole affair, that he fairly ground his teeth&#xD;
over it. Some people would have enjoyed the&#xD;
.iclat thus conferred upon them, while others,&#xD;
recognizing the ludicrous aspect of the adven-&#xD;
ture, would have laughed it off with that genial&#xD;
good-nature which it is the best policy in the&#xD;
world to affect, if it be not really possessed. But&#xD;
Morton, poor fellow, did not possess, and could&#xD;
not affect it. Which aspect of the matter-the&#xD;
heroic or the ridiculous-was most distasteful to&#xD;
him, it would be hard to say, or against which he&#xD;
chafed most impatiently. It provoked him to&#xD;
think how Lagrange had gossipped and would&#xD;
yet gossip over the occurrence; and it is to be&#xD;
feared that, in his irritation, he was not so lenient&#xD;
in his feelings toward Felix, as Felix's quixotic&#xD;
protector ought to have been. But there was a&#xD;
good deal of disappointment mingled with this&#xD;
irritation. He had taken so much interest in the&#xD;
boy, he had striven so har~l to make him compre-&#xD;
hend the moral obligation of a trust, and the&#xD;
chivalric standard of honor, that he was chilled&#xD;
and disappointed by his failure; and felt, if the&#xD;
truth must be told, not a little out of patience&#xD;
with the ungrateful wilfulness which had placed&#xD;
him in his present position. What this position&#xD;
was with regard to Miss Tresham, he had only a&#xD;
faint idea. He knew that he had said something&#xD;
-that he had committed himself in some way-&#xD;
out there beside the pond, before all those peo-&#xD;
ple (in his own mind, he was ungrateful enough&#xD;
to call them those confounded people); but what&#xD;
it was he did not know, and certainly had no in-&#xD;
tention of inquiring. Only it made one thing&#xD;
certain-he could not l~gsitate any longer. The&#xD;
tug of war-did any misgiving of his heart tell&#xD;
him what a tug it would be ?-must come with&#xD;
his 'mother, and, one way or another, his fate&#xD;
must be decided as only Katharine could decide&#xD;
it.&#xD;
With his mind full of these thoughts he went&#xD;
down-stairs, across the hail, and out of the open&#xD;
front-door. The morning was very bright, for the&#xD;
atmosphere had capriciously changed; the ther-&#xD;
mometer had risen from its unwanted depression&#xD;
of the few preceding days, and the air that greet.&#xD;
ed him was soft, as if the dead Indian summer&#xD;
had returned, or the spring was about: to burst.&#xD;
The sunshine was pouring in a dazzling flood&#xD;
over the lawn and piazzas; the grarelled sweep'&#xD;
&#xD;
before the house sparkled as if its stones had all&#xD;
been precious gems; the evergreens, dotted about&#xD;
in every direction, seemed to have put on a bright.-&#xD;
er emerald hue; and a bird that was perched on&#xD;
a magnolia hear by, was pouring forth its whole&#xD;
heart in glad rejoicing that the cold was over and&#xD;
gone; that the blue skies, and the soft air, and&#xD;
the golden sunshine, had returned. We are all&#xD;
more or less susceptible to such influences as&#xD;
these; and Annesley, as it chanced, was keenly&#xD;
alive to them. At the first sight of the bright&#xD;
outer world, and the first note of that trilling&#xD;
lay, his depression suddenly vanished, and his&#xD;
spirits rose like mercury. Almost unconsciously&#xD;
he caught up the notes of the little feathered&#xD;
songster, and, as he went down the steps and&#xD;
turned toward the stables, he was whistling to&#xD;
himself almost gayly.&#xD;
He found Mr. French talking to the head&#xD;
groom, while one or two subordinate stablemen&#xD;
were rubbing down a large, black horse, that&#xD;
stood patiently undergoing the operation.&#xD;
"Good-morning, Frankr" said Annesley, com-&#xD;
ing up. "What brings you out so early? Noth-&#xD;
ing the matter with the Captain, I hope?"&#xD;
"I am sorry to say there is something the&#xD;
matter with his shoulder," said Mr. French, look-&#xD;
ing round. "He fell lame while I was riding&#xD;
home, yesterday afternoon. By-the-way, how do&#xD;
you feel after your ducking?"&#xD;
"lam well, of course,~~ said Morton, a little&#xD;
ungraciously, resuming his usual manner as he&#xD;
went on:" I am concerned about the Captain.-&#xD;
Lead him out there, Jim, and let me see how.he&#xD;
walks."&#xD;
The Captain was led out, and the Captain&#xD;
walked very badly. Some accident had plainly&#xD;
befallen his right shoulder; and the two gentle-&#xD;
men were soon in deep discussion and examina-&#xD;
tion, aided by Isaac the groom, and John the&#xD;
coachman. Various remedies were suggested,&#xD;
and one or two were tried. It was some time&#xD;
before the poor Captain was remanded to his&#xD;
stall, and the two gentlemen bethought them-&#xD;
selves of breakfast. "You can take him to the&#xD;
stable, Isaac," said Mr. French, at last. "I'll&#xD;
l)e out again after breakfast and look at him.-&#xD;
Morton, are you coming?"&#xD;
Niorton said "Yes," rather carelessly; and&#xD;
'they turned into a broad walk which led to the&#xD;
house. With the Captain dismissed from his&#xD;
'mind, Mr. French remembered something he&#xD;
'wished-or, rather, had promised-to say to his&#xD;
brother-in-law. "A man's opinion always has&#xD;
~so much weight with a man," his wife had re-&#xD;
&#xD;
marked to him. "You must be sure and tell&#xD;
Morton what you think of this nonsense." Mr.&#xD;
French had promised that he would; but now he&#xD;
began to wish that he had not been so rash. Sup.&#xD;
pose Morton were to be offended? "Hang it 1"&#xD;
thought the other, candidly, "I should be of-&#xD;
fended myself if anybody were to meddle in my&#xD;
private affairs. I wish I had not promised Adela.&#xD;
It is none of my business if he chooses to make a&#xD;
fool of himself." Then he cleared his throat and&#xD;
looked at the abstracted face beside him.&#xD;
"Are you sure you don't feel any the worse&#xD;
for your exploit yesterday?" he asked, by way&#xD;
of introduction to what he meant to say. "I&#xD;
should think you would, Morton."&#xD;
"Why the deuce should I?" asked Morton,&#xD;
pettishly. "I'm neither a child nor a woman.&#xD;
Confound the exploit, Frank! can't you let it&#xD;
alone?',&#xD;
"Oh, of course," said Mr. French, a little&#xD;
surprised "I didn't know you were sensitive&#xD;
about it. I'm sure it made you rather a hero-&#xD;
at least in the eyes of the ladies. Some of them&#xD;
were exceedingly interested, I can tell you."&#xD;
Then, after a pause-" Morton, I suppose you&#xD;
know what you're about, but don't you think&#xD;
you may be going a little too far with-with one&#xD;
of them?"&#xD;
"With one e~ them!" repeated Morton, giv-&#xD;
ing a start. "Whom do you mean?" he asked,&#xD;
more quietly than his companion had expected.&#xD;
"I don't understand."&#xD;
"I mean that Miss Tresham who lives in&#xD;
Tallahoma, and is a teacher, or something of the&#xD;
sort," answered Mr. French, who, as he had once&#xD;
begun, was determined to blunder through. "Of&#xD;
course, you know your own affairs best, and I&#xD;
hope you won't think me interfering; but I&#xD;
thought I would give you a hint. Young women's&#xD;
heads are so easily turned, and old women's&#xD;
tongues are so confoundedly long, that one is&#xD;
obliged to be careful."&#xD;
"I am much obliged to you," said Annesley,&#xD;
in a tone which contradicted the words, for he&#xD;
was more angry than he would have liked to con-&#xD;
fess; "but I believe I can manage my own af-&#xD;
fairs-and I prefer to do so."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," said Mr. French, begin.&#xD;
ning to be a little offended in turn. "I didn't&#xD;
mean to be impertinent. I'm an older man than&#xD;
you are, and I thought I would give you a little'&#xD;
friendly advice. It's a devilish disagreeable&#xD;
thing to be talked about as people wilt talk&#xD;
in ~these country places; and of course I never&#xD;
supposed you were in earnest about the girl.&#xD;

THE TUG OF WALl.                       61&#xD;
&#xD;
60                       MOIITON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm eonf~dent, I need not tell you, Morton, tha&#xD;
such a thing would nearly kill your mother."&#xD;
"You must allow me to be the best judge o~&#xD;
that," said Morton, stiffly.. And there the con&#xD;
versation cnded~&#xD;
Mr. French shrugged his shoulders, auc&#xD;
thought to himself that he had known how ii&#xD;
would be, but that at least he could tell Adek&#xD;
he had done his best; while Morton walked on&#xD;
with his breast fairly in a flame. So he hai&#xD;
made such a fool of himself as that! He ha~&#xD;
betrayed every thing so plainly that his brother.&#xD;
in4aw felt obliged to come and force his advice&#xD;
upon him! Ikideed, it was time that he spoke&#xD;
if only for Katharine's sake, since ha had com~&#xD;
mitted himself, and involved her to such an ex-&#xD;
tent as this. Foor Morton! In his single-&#xD;
minded sincerity, it never occurred to him that&#xD;
Mr. French htd been prompted to the unusual&#xD;
character which he had assumed. He took it&#xD;
simply as the consequence of his own unguarded&#xD;
conduct; and it confirmed rather than shook his&#xD;
resolution. It would have gone hard with Adela&#xD;
if she could have known the result of her hus.&#xD;
band's interibrence.&#xD;
Breakfast passed oft' quietly, but rather silent-&#xD;
ly. .Adela did not make her appearance, and,&#xD;
although the three others talked at intervals,&#xD;
there was a sense of constraint hanging over&#xD;
them, and theydid not remain very long at table.&#xD;
Mr. French was the first person to leave the&#xD;
room, taking out his cigar-case as he did so.&#xD;
Then Morton rose and walked round to his&#xD;
mother,.&#xD;
"Will you come to the library?" he asked.&#xD;
"I have something to say to you."&#xD;
She linked up at him, and, in a moment divin-&#xD;
ing his purpose, her heart sank. But she had&#xD;
sullicient presence of mind to smile into the&#xD;
grave, earnest eyes regarding her.&#xD;
"certainly I will ~come," she answered, "but&#xD;
I must first see Adela, and give orders about din-&#xD;
ner-.~that is, if you are not in a hurry."&#xD;
~I a~sn not at all in a hurry," he replied.&#xD;
"If you w111 come when you are at leisure, that&#xD;
will do. You will find me In the library," he&#xD;
added, as he took up a paper and left the room.&#xD;
lIe ~went to the library, but he soon found&#xD;
that he could notread. It is one thing to hold&#xD;
a paper open before the eyes, and quite another&#xD;
to ~ay Intelligent heed to its contents. Morton&#xD;
did th~ ~rst iliuigently'.~ but, with all his efforts,&#xD;
he conid not achie#e the second. He dreaded&#xD;
the intefrylew with his mother so much that he&#xD;
eagerly c~esiied It to be over * and Ito caught&#xD;
&#xD;
t himself listening to every footstep in the hall&#xD;
outside the door, hoping it might be hers. At&#xD;
last he threw down the paper, and, rising, walked&#xD;
- restlessly across the floor.&#xD;
There was not a pleasanter room at Annes-&#xD;
dale than this library, nor one that he liked bet.&#xD;
ter; but today it might have been an irksome&#xD;
cage, to judge by his impatient movements to&#xD;
* and fro. From the fireplace to the windows, and&#xD;
I from the windows to the fireplace, he paced; until&#xD;
I finally lie paused before the latter, and, leaning&#xD;
one arm on the mantel, gazed steadily at an en-&#xD;
graving which hung above it-a "St. Cecilia"&#xD;
he had brought from Dresden. Something in&#xD;
* the outline of the uplifted face reminded him&#xD;
* of Katharine. It was not so much a resem-&#xD;
blance as the suggestion of a resemblance. But&#xD;
it had struck him often before, and now it&#xD;
brought her face vividly to his mind. By some&#xD;
strange perversity of association, it also brought&#xD;
to his recollection that day when she sang the&#xD;
"Adelaide" for him, when he had chanced upon&#xD;
the open letter, and when her strange conduct&#xD;
had so chilled and repulsed him.&#xD;
He was still thinking of these things, and his&#xD;
face looked unusually grave and troubled, when&#xD;
the door opened and his mother entered. She&#xD;
crossed the room, and, as he did not turn, she&#xD;
laid her hand on his arm.&#xD;
"You wished to speak to me, Morton?" she&#xD;
said. "Here I am."&#xD;
"My dear mother, thank you," he answered,&#xD;
turning quickly. "1 did ~iot hear you come in-&#xD;
how quiet you are!" -&#xD;
"1 was afraid you would be tired of~wait-&#xD;
ing for me," she said, sitting down in a deep&#xD;
arm-chair. "Adela is quite unwell, and I stayed&#xD;
with her some times I thought that, if you&#xD;
wanted to see me about any thing of importance,&#xD;
you would have told n~e so."&#xD;
"I wanted to see you about my own affairs,"&#xD;
said Morton, plunging headlong into the subject&#xD;
he now felt tempted to avoid. "I want to ask&#xD;
your advice about a very important matter-&#xD;
to me at least," he went on, faintly smiling.&#xD;
"Mother, I have lately thought of marrying."&#xD;
The room suddenly went round and grew&#xD;
black before Mrs. Annesley's eyes. She extend-&#xD;
ed her hand almost unconsciously, and clutched&#xD;
the corner of a table near by to steady herself.&#xD;
Her worst fears were realized; but she had suf-&#xD;
ficient self-control to look up quietly, and say-'&#xD;
"Well?"&#xD;
"Well," he answered, knowing that tate worst&#xD;
could not be too quickly told, "I fear that lank&#xD;
&#xD;
going to disappoint you. I fear that the woman&#xD;
I Jove, the woman I wish to marry, is not the&#xD;
woman whom you would have chosen for me.&#xD;
But in this matter, no human being, not even&#xD;
the nearest and dearest, can judge 1~or us," he&#xD;
said, gently taking the hand which she had laid&#xD;
on the table. "We can only judge for ourselves,&#xD;
and abide by our choice through good or through&#xD;
ill. Mother, will you not give your sanction to~&#xD;
my choice?"&#xD;
She suffered her hand to remain in his; but&#xD;
hereycs looked cold, and her voice sounded hard&#xD;
when she asked-&#xD;
"What is her name?"&#xD;
"Her *name" he answered, "is Katharine&#xD;
Tresham. My dear mother,"' he continued,&#xD;
eagerly, "don't judge her by her surroundings,&#xD;
don't think of the position in which Fortune&#xD;
has placed her. Only judge, only think of her&#xD;
as you will see and love her for herself, as you&#xD;
will-"&#xD;
He was stopped by a gesture from his moth-&#xD;
er, as she drew back her hand.&#xD;
"Go P' she said, bitterly. "I have heard&#xD;
enough. If you had the heart to come and stab&#xD;
me like this, you will not heed any thing I can&#xD;
say to you. Go! Only remember that, if you&#xD;
do degra do yourself in this way, you will cut&#xD;
yourself off from me forever. I will never re-&#xD;
ceive that woman as my daughter; I will never,&#xD;
as long as 1 live, suffer her to cross the threshold&#xD;
of this house!"&#xD;
"Mother!"&#xD;
It was a cry of astonished, grieved reproach,&#xD;
which at any other time would have gone to her&#xD;
heart5, but she had now so entirely lost command&#xD;
of herself, and of the emotion which seemed suf-&#xD;
focating her, that it rather provoked than allayed&#xD;
her anger. She had feared and in a measure an-&#xD;
ticipated this for a long time; but it did not make&#xD;
the disappointment any less poignant when it&#xD;
came-it did not teach her any better how to&#xD;
bear it.&#xD;
"Mother," said Morton, gravely, "you can-&#xD;
not be yourself-you cannot be in earnest when&#xD;
you utter such words as these."&#xD;
"Go!" she repeated, once more, in a voice&#xD;
choked with tears.&#xD;
And, as there was nothing else to be done,&#xD;
he walked sadly across the floor, and stood silent-&#xD;
ly at one of the windows, waiting for what would&#xD;
come next-waiting to see whether his mother&#xD;
would recall him, or whether she would leave the&#xD;
~roomwithonlythoselastbitterwords.&#xD;
A long time passed-an hour it seemed to&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
the young man, and it was in reality many min-&#xD;
utes-before any sound broke the stillness of&#xD;
the room. Then Mrs. Annesley said:&#xD;
"Morton!"&#xD;
He came to her side.&#xD;
"1 am here," he answered, gravely but gent-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
She lifted a face that was white even to the&#xD;
lips, and held out her hand.&#xD;
"My son," she said, "forgive me. I did not&#xD;
mean to pain you; but the shock was so sudden,&#xD;
and very hard to blar."&#xD;
"My mother, my dearest mother!" he said.&#xD;
It ~vas all that he did say, but he bent down&#xD;
and kissed the hand she gave him, and peace-&#xD;
or at least a semblance of it-was once more&#xD;
established. After a while it was Mrs. Annesley&#xD;
who spoke first.&#xD;
"Morton," she said, "have you considered&#xD;
this well?"&#xD;
"I have considered it well," he answered.&#xD;
"Your mind is made up?"&#xD;
" My mind is entirely made ~&#xD;
"You are determined to inflict this distress&#xD;
upon mc, and to ruin your own life by such a&#xD;
misalliance?"&#xD;
"I am determined to ask Miss Tresham to&#xD;
be my wife," said the young man, looking pale&#xD;
but unshaken. "I would have asked her long&#xD;
ago if it had not been that I hesitated on your&#xD;
account. But now it is not possible for me to&#xD;
hesitate longer."&#xD;
"Do you mean that you have committed&#xD;
yourself?" she asked, hastily.&#xD;
"In absolute words-no. Dear mother, don't~&#xD;
pain me by combating my resolution," he said,&#xD;
with his eyes full of appeal. " Only tell me that,&#xD;
if she consents to marry me, you will welcome&#xD;
and try to love her."&#xD;
"Tell me one thing, Morton," said Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley-" what do you know of this woman&#xD;
whom you ask me to receive as your wife?&#xD;
When a man marries he should know all the&#xD;
previous history and all the connections of the&#xD;
woman he chooses. Tell me, my son, what do&#xD;
you know of hers?" ~&#xD;
She touched his cause in its weakest point,&#xD;
* and he knew it. The thoughts he had been&#xD;
revolving when she entered the room - the&#xD;
thoughts that had sealed his lips ever since the&#xD;
day he saw Katharine last--rushed upon him&#xD;
suddenly with overwhelming force, and for sev-&#xD;
oral minutes he could not reply. Then the truth&#xD;
came in one word-&#xD;
"Nothing."&#xD;
&#xD;

<pb  n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8070-00000035"/>&#xD;
62                  MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Nothing!" his mother echoed, in a ton&#xD;
of grieved astonishment. "Nothing, Morton&#xD;
And yet you ask me to welcome her as a daugh&#xD;
ter? My son, my dear son, what can you b(&#xD;
thinking of? Where is your sense of what ir&#xD;
due to yourself aud to your name?"&#xD;
"I know nothing about her," he said, "but]&#xD;
can trust her. She is too pure and noble ever to&#xD;
have done any thing that she need blush for."&#xD;
"But, good Reavens! her relations, her&#xD;
friends-what may they not be?"&#xD;
"I do not think she has any. I have never&#xD;
heard ,her speak of them."&#xD;
"And you think that a good sign? Oh, Mor-&#xD;
ton, Morton!"&#xD;
"It is not a bad sign, mother," said Morton,&#xD;
beginning to look a little less patient. "Many&#xD;
a girl is friendless, many a girl is obliged to earn&#xD;
her bread as Miss Tresham is doing. It would&#xD;
be cruel to doubt her because Fate has dealt&#xD;
hardly with her. It is true that she has never&#xD;
mentioned her past history or her family cir.&#xD;
ournatances to me; but I have never been in a&#xD;
position to receive such a confidence."&#xD;
"And you will ask her to marry you without&#xD;
knowing more than this?"&#xD;
"I should be a cur, not a gentleman, if I in-&#xD;
quired into her affairs before asking her."&#xD;
"Oh, my son, what madness!"&#xD;
"Mother dear, be patient with me," he said,&#xD;
gently. "Don't you see-can't you tell how hard&#xD;
I am trying to do right? If I had only myself&#xD;
to consider," he went on, wal~ring again from&#xD;
the fireplace-to the window, and from the window&#xD;
to the fireplace, "I would sacrifice my wishes to&#xD;
yours. But-but I am afraid it is too late as far&#xD;
as she is concerned."&#xD;
"You put her before me, then?"&#xD;
"I put my honor before every thing."&#xD;
"Your honor should lead you just the other&#xD;
way," she said, lapsing from self-restraint into&#xD;
anger again. "A gentleman's first duty is to his&#xD;
name. What will you be doing with yours when&#xD;
marry thus?"&#xD;
"I will not be degrading it," answered he,&#xD;
firmly. I' Mother, you do not know Katharine&#xD;
Tresham. If you did know her-if you would&#xD;
know her-you could never speak 01 her in this&#xD;
manner."&#xD;
"She has, taken you from mc, Morton. She&#xD;
has steeled your heart against all my entreaties;&#xD;
she has made you forget what is due to yourself&#xD;
-how can I do other than hate her? flow can&#xD;
I stand by silently and see you marry an adven-&#xD;
turess'?'"&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS TRESHAM ASKS ADVICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mother!"&#xD;
The exclamation was so stern that for a mo-&#xD;
ment Mrs. Annesley shrank. But, before she&#xD;
could speak, Morton gave a great gulp, and hur-&#xD;
ried on:&#xD;
"Forgive me, but this had better end. There&#xD;
is no good in prolonging a useless discussion,&#xD;
and I see now that this is useless. I only pro-&#xD;
voke you, and am pained myself. So I will go.&#xD;
Don't forget that I am very sorry to have&#xD;
grieved you, and, if possible, still more sorry&#xD;
to act against your wishes for the first time in&#xD;
my life."&#xD;
She let him go-as far as the door; but, when&#xD;
his hand was on the knob, her voice called him&#xD;
back. lIe rcturncd at once, and, rising, she met&#xD;
him half.wav.&#xD;
"My son, forgive me," she said. "You have&#xD;
never in your life before grieved or disappointed&#xD;
me; you have often given up your will to mine;&#xD;
you have never once failed in respect or duty to&#xD;
me. It is only just, therefore, that my turn for&#xD;
sacrifice should come. I never thought it would&#xD;
be so hard; I never thought you would desire to&#xD;
throw away your happiness in this way. But, as&#xD;
you will do it-why, take my consent, and God&#xD;
bless you!"&#xD;
The young man caught her in his arms with&#xD;
something that was almost a sob.&#xD;
"Mother, my dear, kind mother!" he said.&#xD;
"You don't know how much I longed to hear&#xD;
those words. Thank God, they have come at&#xD;
last!"&#xD;
He thought the tug of war was over; hut, as&#xD;
he clasped his mother in his arms, it would have&#xD;
been strange if he could have known-if he&#xD;
could even faintly have imagined-how corn&#xD;
pletely she had out-witted him, and how the&#xD;
worst struggle was yet to come!&#xD;
&#xD;
-'---4--&#xD;
&#xD;
day? Oh, Miss Tresham, that's so good of&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"Why, we'll have two long weeks! Thank&#xD;
you, ma'am, so much."&#xD;
"Don't thank me," said the governess, with&#xD;
a smile. "I should have kept you hard at work&#xD;
till Christmas-Eve. Your mother told me to dis-&#xD;
miss school to-day, and that it will not be re-&#xD;
sumed till the Monday after New-Year. So, you&#xD;
see, you have two good weeks."&#xD;
"Oh, haven't we!"&#xD;
"Well, show your gratitude by giving me no&#xD;
trouble to-day~ I will hear the geography first."&#xD;
For the next fifteen minutes they were all&#xD;
busy locating capitals, settling boundaries, and&#xD;
describing countries. The children were so ani-&#xD;
mated by the holiday prospect before them that&#xD;
they did remarkably well; and the class was&#xD;
about to be dismissed, when the door opened&#xD;
without any preparatory knock, and, instead of a&#xD;
servant, Mrs. Marks entered, with every sign of&#xD;
surprise and discomposure in her manner.&#xD;
"Good Gracious, Miss Katharine, what'stobe&#xD;
done! To think of such a thing just now of all&#xD;
times, and me deep in the mince-meat!"&#xD;
Katharine looked up in astonishment. It was&#xD;
not often that Mrs. Marks used such a tone of&#xD;
supreme vexation, or appeared so red and wor-&#xD;
ried-not often that she gave a glance so full&#xD;
of chagrin at her befioured dress an4 large do-&#xD;
mestic apron.&#xD;
"What on earth is to be done?" she re-&#xD;
peated, as Katharine's eyes met her own. "I&#xD;
never was so taken by surprise in all my life!&#xD;
To think of !rer--"&#xD;
"What is the matter? Who is it?" asked&#xD;
the young governess. "I don't understand."&#xD;
She understood the next moment, when Mrs.&#xD;
Marks pushed two cards across the table toward&#xD;
her-two cards exactly alike in appearance~ and&#xD;
both bearing tire same name:&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS TRESHAM A5H5 ADvIcE.&#xD;
Two weeks went by very quietly, and brought&#xD;
Miss Tresham's happy scholars to the beginning&#xD;
of their Christmas-holidays.&#xD;
"Do your lessons well to-day, children," she&#xD;
said, as she entered the school-room on a certain&#xD;
Friday morning, and found them gathering about&#xD;
the blazing fire. "This is the last of school&#xD;
until after New-Year."&#xD;
They all looked up delighted.&#xD;
"To-day! And Christmas not till Thura-&#xD;
&#xD;
Katharine was too well bred to show exactly&#xD;
Low much surprise she really felt. So, after one&#xD;
repressiblee exclamation, she hurried off at once&#xD;
Ito sympathy.&#xD;
"Indeed, dear Mrs. Marks, this is very in-&#xD;
&#xD;
63&#xD;
&#xD;
convenient! I hardly wonder you are vexed.&#xD;
Wouldn't it be possible to excuse yourself?"&#xD;
"Excuse myself-to Mrs. Annesley!" Evi-&#xD;
dently that was not to be thought of.&#xD;
"Well," said Katharine, with quite a prac-&#xD;
tical inquiry, "why don't you go and dress?&#xD;
It will not take you many minutes to smooth&#xD;
your hair and put on your black silk. ShallI&#xD;
help you?"&#xD;
"You! Why, I came to tell you that you&#xD;
must go down at once."&#xD;
Was Mrs. Marks distracted? Katharine eer~&#xD;
tainly thought so, as she drew back and gazed&#xD;
at her in sheer amazement.&#xD;
"I go down to- see Mrs. Annesley! Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, what can you be thinking of?"&#xD;
"How are you~ going to help yourself?" de-&#xD;
manded Mrs. Marks, impatiently. "She came&#xD;
to see you just' as much as she did to see me-&#xD;
indeed a great deal more, I expect, if the truth&#xD;
was known. Tom said that she gave him one of&#xD;
those cards for Mi8s Tresham."&#xD;
"He must have ben mistaken."&#xD;
"How could he be?"&#xD;
"I don't know," answered Katharine; "but&#xD;
he must have been."&#xD;
"My dear," cried Mrs. Marks, almost angrily,&#xD;
"what is the use of this? If you don't believe&#xD;
Tom, I can tell you that I listened through ~&#xD;
crack of the pantry door, and that I heard Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley ask for you. Of course she came to&#xD;
see you; and of course you must go down as&#xD;
soon as you have dressed. Come-quick 1"&#xD;
She laid her hand on Katharine's arm and&#xD;
strove to lead her forward; but the girl drew&#xD;
back with a decided motion.&#xD;
"No," she said. "If I go down at all-if&#xD;
you are sure she asked for me-I will go down&#xD;
exactly as I am."&#xD;
Mrs. Marks looked aghast.&#xD;
"In tlrat old dress! Oh, my dear, consider&#xD;
how important it is that you should make a good~&#xD;
impression. Mrs. Annesley is so elegant-you&#xD;
have no idea! What would Mr.-"&#xD;
A glance from Katharine stopped her short.&#xD;
"I am breaking my ~rsual rule in leaving the&#xD;
school-room to go down at all," she said; and&#xD;
since I do it prineipr~y to give you time to&#xD;
change your dress, I certainly shall not make&#xD;
anyalteration in my own.-Children, look over&#xD;
your sums; I will be back soon to attend tt&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Before Mrs. Marks could utter another word&#xD;
of expostulation, she left the room and was de-'&#xD;
scending the staircase.&#xD;

64                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                    MISS TRESHAM ASKS ADVICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
She would scarcely have been a woman, how-&#xD;
ever, if she had not stopped a moment outside&#xD;
the parlor door, partly to be sure of her self.&#xD;
possession, and partly to glance over her dress&#xD;
-the same dark-blue merino which she had&#xD;
worn the last day Morton was there.&#xD;
When she opened the door, the room looked&#xD;
as rigid and cold as ever-perhaps a little more&#xD;
so, considering that the day was gloomy-but&#xD;
on the stifi; black sofa sat a figure, the grace&#xD;
and elegance of which would have brightened&#xD;
even a duller scene, and which rising, with a&#xD;
soft rustle of silk and velvet, met Katharine in&#xD;
the middle of the floor.&#xD;
If Mrs. Annesley had expected some timid,&#xD;
blushing girl whom she could awe or patronize&#xD;
into reverence, ~he must have been greatly sur-&#xD;
prised at sight of the calm, stately young lady&#xD;
-unmistakably a young lady-who met her with&#xD;
such quiet ease.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, I presume?" she said, in-&#xD;
quiringly-for despite all that Morton had told&#xD;
her, she could not believe that this was Mrs.&#xD;
Marks's governess.&#xD;
And Katharine answered with Katharine's&#xD;
own straightforward dignity:&#xD;
"Yes, I am Miss Tresham. Pray sit down,&#xD;
madam. Mrs. Marks will be bere in a minute.&#xD;
She desired me to apologize for her delay, and&#xD;
say that she was very much occupied when you&#xD;
came."&#xD;
"I am sorry to have disturbed her," said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley, hardly conscious of what she did&#xD;
say, and only noting with a sharp pang every&#xD;
separate charm of this girl's appearance and&#xD;
manner. Then they sat down, and when the&#xD;
lady spoke again it was with a perceptible effort.&#xD;
"I have heard a great deal about you-Miss&#xD;
Tresham-" she did not say from whom-" and&#xD;
it has been a regret to me that I have not been&#xD;
able to pay this visit sooner; but I am a very&#xD;
great invalid-so much of an inValid, that my&#xD;
friends are kind enough to excuse a great deal&#xD;
of social neglect from me."&#xD;
Katharine thought there were very few traces&#xD;
of illness apparent in the smooth, handsome face&#xD;
before her; but she had enough of tim habitude&#xD;
of society to accept the apology, and answer it&#xD;
with a few words of conventional sympathy-&#xD;
wondering the w~ile, why it had been at all&#xD;
necessary to offer it.&#xD;
"Thanks-you are very kind," said Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley, in acknowledgment of her condolence.&#xD;
"Yes, sickness is a dreadful thing-more be-&#xD;
cause it is apt to make one neglect one's duties,&#xD;
&#xD;
than for any other reason, 1 think. Some peo-&#xD;
ple don't allow it to interfere, I know; but I&#xD;
have never been strong-minded. If I feel badly,&#xD;
I am sure in lie on my sofa, even with the con-&#xD;
sciousness of something that ought to be done."&#xD;
"We are all of us prone to do that, I think,"&#xD;
said Katharine; "and 1, for one, real cannot&#xD;
admire the people who treat their bodies as cruel&#xD;
drivers treat their horses, and goad them into&#xD;
exertion whether they feel like it or not."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley smiled faintly. "You are very&#xD;
good to say so, when I see plainly that you have&#xD;
no personal knowledge-no personal experience,&#xD;
that is-of the malady to which I allude. Do&#xD;
you sing much, Miss Tresham? I see the piano&#xD;
open, and surely your pupils have not yet ad-&#xD;
vanced as far as Mozart."&#xD;
The conversation rather flagged during the&#xD;
"minute," which unaccountably lengthened into&#xD;
ten or fifteen, before Mrs. Marks entered; Katha-&#xD;
rine began to grow a little impatient, and to'won-&#xD;
der what could possibly be the motive of this&#xD;
visit. Had Mrs. Annesley merely come to gratify&#xD;
her curiosity, or what other meaning was hidden&#xD;
under her cold civility, her languid common-&#xD;
places, her keen though not ill-bred scrutiny?&#xD;
The young governess felt that she was under-&#xD;
going a sort of examination; that she was on&#xD;
trial, as it were, before this fine lady; and, feeling&#xD;
it, almost unconsciously she resented it. . She&#xD;
who was usually so frank and cordial in her&#xD;
manner, was now reserved, almost haughty;&#xD;
while Mrs. Annesley made matters worse by a&#xD;
shade of patronage-half unconscious, half it is&#xD;
to be feared, intended-which did not please the&#xD;
girl who had once told Morton that she was "un-&#xD;
fortunately very proud." It was a relief to both&#xD;
of them when the door at last opened, and Mrs.&#xD;
Marks came bustling in, looking as if she had&#xD;
been hastily squeezed into her black silk, and&#xD;
had not yet recovered from the process.&#xD;
Katharine watched the greeting between the&#xD;
two ladies-Mrs. Marks's hearty cordiality, a little&#xD;
tempered by awkwardness'mi the one side, and&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley's condesce~ding suavity on the&#xD;
other-with quiet amuse~t~ben she kept&#xD;
her seat for a few minutes longer, thinking that,&#xD;
after they were fairly launched into conversation,&#xD;
she would go back to her waiting pupils; but, as&#xD;
it chanced, this intention was frustrated. Just&#xD;
as she had decided on leaving the room, Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley turned to her.&#xD;
"I waited until Mrs. Marks was here, Miss.&#xD;
Tresham, before I made a request ~Whieh is&#xD;
partly the reason of my visit this morning. A&#xD;
&#xD;
few young people are coming next week to spend&#xD;
Christmas at Anaesdale, and if you will be kind&#xD;
enough to waive ceremony, I should be very glad&#xD;
for you to make one of the party. Will you&#xD;
come?"&#xD;
With all her self-possession-and it was even&#xD;
more than people gave her credit for-Katharine&#xD;
started. Was it possible that it was Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
Icy who gave this gracious invitation? -who&#xD;
asked her to meet a party of young people&#xD;
(which was a modest way of saying the Wie of&#xD;
Lagrange) at Anneadale, which was the head-&#xD;
quarters of gay hospitality? For a second she&#xD;
could not answer from absolute surprise; but&#xD;
she suddenly caught a glimpse of the ludicrous&#xD;
astonishment on Mrs. Marks's face, and it piqued&#xD;
her into an immediate reply.&#xD;
"You are very kind," she said, looking, with&#xD;
her clear gray eyes, into the languid, handsome&#xD;
face; "I do not think much of ceremony, as a&#xD;
gcniu-al rule, and I should be glad to accept your&#xD;
invitation, if it were possible. But it is not pos-&#xD;
sible. 1 never leave home."&#xD;
"You never have left home, perhaps,~~ said&#xD;
the lady, smiling a little. "But, if you will par-&#xD;
don me that is no reason why you should not&#xD;
begin to. do so Are you fond of gayety? I&#xD;
think Auiesdale might tempt you a little in that&#xD;
way. Adela and Morton always manage to get&#xD;
up something amusing at Christmas. But I will&#xD;
not urge you-i will leave the matter to Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, and let her say whether or not you shall&#xD;
go."&#xD;
She looked at Mrs. Marks, and Ydrs. Marks,&#xD;
who had recovered her powers of speech by this&#xD;
time, was ready in a moment to take her cue.&#xD;
"Indeed, I am sure Miss. Katharine knows&#xD;
how glad I would be to see her go," she said.&#xD;
"It's very kind of you, Mrs. Annesley, to ask&#xD;
her. She has a very dull time, shut up here&#xD;
with Richard, and me, and the children; and I&#xD;
hope she won't let any of us stand in the way of&#xD;
her taking a little pleasure when there is such a&#xD;
good chance for it as this."&#xD;
"I take charge of the children out of school,&#xD;
as well as in," said Katharine to Mrs. Annesley.&#xD;
"Mrs. Marks is anxious to give me pleasure,&#xD;
but my going would cause her a great deal of in-&#xD;
convenience; so I hope you will excuse me for&#xD;
declining your invitation."&#xD;
"As for taking care of the children," said&#xD;
Mrs. Marks, before Mrs. Annesley could speak,&#xD;
"that's Letty's business, my dear, ai~d not yours,&#xD;
as you know. You've spoiled her to death by&#xD;
looking after theta yourself, and the sooner she&#xD;
&#xD;
learns to do it again, the better.-I hope you&#xD;
don't think we work her to death," said the good&#xD;
woman, turning her attention to Mrs. Annesley,&#xD;
with startling rapidity. "She took it all on her-&#xD;
self, and I begged her again and again not to&#xD;
worry about ~thcm, though it's true they're so&#xD;
much improved-especially in their manners-&#xD;
that you'd hardly know them for the same chil-&#xD;
dren."&#xD;
"Surcly their manners would not suffer if you&#xD;
left them for the short space of a fortnight," said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley to Katharine.&#xD;
"For the matter of that," said Mrs. Marks, "I&#xD;
promised their Aunt Lucy that Katy and Sara&#xD;
should pay her a visit this Christmas; and you&#xD;
know, my dear, you don't have much to do with&#xD;
the boys."&#xD;
"Mrs. Marks is evidently determined to get&#xD;
rid of me," said Katharine, with a smile, to Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley; "but I flatter myself she would miss&#xD;
me after I was gone. And so I think I shall&#xD;
abide by my resolution and remain.&#xD;
"My dear," said Mrs. Marks, solemnly, "if&#xD;
you take my advice, you'll go."&#xD;
"Take her advice by all means, Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am," said Mrs. Annesley, "or else give me one&#xD;
good reason for your refusal."&#xD;
But one good reason, as society reckons good&#xD;
reasons, Katharine could not give. In our arti-&#xD;
ficial condition of life, it is not considered a valid&#xD;
or even a courteous excuse to say that you have&#xD;
no desire to perform a certain action, or to go to&#xD;
a certain place. It is hard to imagine what could,&#xD;
be a better reason for ordinary social refusals&#xD;
than the simple statement of disinclination; but,&#xD;
according to the rules of a certain arbitrary but&#xD;
very ill-defined code, it will not answer at all. If&#xD;
a man asks you to his house, you must not say&#xD;
that you don't want to come, but that you "have&#xD;
pressing business," or "a previous engagement,"&#xD;
or a sick wife, or a dead uncle, or any other lie&#xD;
that may be convenient. If he finds you out, he&#xD;
will not be offended, he will take the pious fraud&#xD;
as it was intended. But if you.had simply told&#xD;
the truth, and said that you felt unwilling to&#xD;
come, he would have had good right to be in-&#xD;
suIted. Knowing this as well as Mrs. Annesley,&#xD;
Katharine hesitated. She did not want to go to&#xD;
Anneadale, and she did not meamj to go if she&#xD;
could help it; but still, social usages had a cer-&#xD;
tain power over her, and, hemmedd in by Mr~.&#xD;
Marks on one side, and her visitor on the ether,&#xD;
she hardly knew what to say. Mrs. Annesley saw&#xD;
her embarrassment, and came to her relief.&#xD;
"I am sure you think me very rude te press&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE&#xD;

66                          MORTON hOUSE.                                                          MISS TRESLIAM ASKS ADVICE.                     67&#xD;
&#xD;
you in this way, Miss Tresham; but I am reall;&#xD;
very anxious that you should make one of ow&#xD;
Christmas party, and that anxiety must plea&#xD;
my excuse. I see that you are half persuaded&#xD;
and I am sure that, when you think the matte&#xD;
over, you will find there is no reason why yot&#xD;
should not oblige us. My son you know already.&#xD;
and my daughter will be very glad to meet you.&#xD;
If I give you until tomorrow to consider, will yea&#xD;
promise to say 'yes' then?"&#xD;
"I am sure it is quite impossible," Katharin&#xD;
began.&#xD;
But the lady had already risen, and was hold.&#xD;
ing out her hand in parting salute.&#xD;
"I shall either come or send for your answer&#xD;
tomorroww" she said; "and I b~g you most&#xD;
sincerely to let it be favorable.-Mrs. Marks, I&#xD;
leave the cause in your hands. Promise me&#xD;
that you will make her come!"&#xD;
"I'll do my best," said Mrs. Marks, dubious-&#xD;
ly; "but Miss Katharine's very hard-headed, and&#xD;
I'm afraid she'll go her own way."&#xD;
"So much the better, if that way lies toward&#xD;
Annesdale," said the mistress of Anneadale, gra-&#xD;
ciously. Then she shook hands with both of&#xD;
them, gave Mrs. Marks an invitation to Annes-&#xD;
dale in that vague, general way which means&#xD;
"good-morning," told Katharine she was sure&#xD;
she would not disappoint her, and finally swept&#xD;
out, leaving behind her a faint fragrance and&#xD;
a vivid impression of affable smiles and soft&#xD;
speeches, and shining silk and rich velvet.&#xD;
"Bless my soul, how she was dressed!" said&#xD;
Mrs. Marks, as soon as she was safely out of ear-&#xD;
shot. "Did you notice the quality of that silk?&#xD;
I never saw any thing half as heavy in my life.&#xD;
It must have cost three dollars a yard, if it cost&#xD;
a cent; and what an elegant bonnet! Well !"&#xD;
-with a long breath-" I am sure I never was&#xD;
more surprised in my life! I thought she would&#xD;
have been just the other way. But there's no&#xD;
telling what people will do for their children;&#xD;
and~ after all, she mayn't be as proud as people&#xD;
Bay. ~obody could have been more polite than&#xD;
she wal this morning. I was astonished you did&#xD;
not agree to go," she went on, addressing Katha-&#xD;
ripe, with mild expostulation. "Of course you&#xD;
know 'your own affairs best; and I don't mean&#xD;
to intrude my advice upon you-for advice is a&#xD;
thing that everyhodyis ifnxious to give, and no-&#xD;
body's thankful to get-but you know what she&#xD;
came for, my dear, snd I can tell you that she has&#xD;
done a great deal for ker~; and, if you want my&#xD;
opinion, you'll be a great foo-simpleton, if you&#xD;
don't go to Annesdale."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then you will certainly consider me a great&#xD;
simpleton," said Katharine, coolly, "for I don't&#xD;
I mean to ~o to Annesdale."&#xD;
With this ultimatum, she walked off to the&#xD;
waiting arithmeticians, and left Mrs. Marks to&#xD;
return to her mince-meat with what degree of&#xD;
interest she could muster.&#xD;
Dinner was over, and the short winter after-&#xD;
noon was more than half gone when Katharine&#xD;
opened Mrs. Marks's door, and, showing herself&#xD;
in her bonnet and cloak, asked if the former had&#xD;
any objection to her taking the children to Mor-&#xD;
tOn House. "They are anxious to return Felix's&#xD;
visit," she said (Felix had, a fortnight before,&#xD;
made his long-promised call), "and Mrs. Gordon&#xD;
was kind enough to ask me to come to see her;&#xD;
so, if you have no objection, we will walk out&#xD;
there."&#xD;
"I haven't the least objection," said Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, looking up from her work, and wonder-&#xD;
ing not a little at the grand acquaintances tier&#xD;
governess was making. "I am glad you are&#xD;
going to take the children yourself; Miss Kath-&#xD;
arine, for you can see that they don't behave&#xD;
badly, or make themselves troublesome to Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon. Isn't it rather a long walk, though? "&#xD;
"Not for me," said Katharine, and shut the&#xD;
iloor.&#xD;
The day had been overcast from its dawn, and&#xD;
the afternoon was very gray and gloomy when&#xD;
the governess and her merry troop went out into&#xD;
it. Every thing looked sombre and tintless, the&#xD;
bare trees stood out against a dull, leaden sky,&#xD;
the distant hills seemed desolate and brown, the&#xD;
broad fields were perhaps the most cheerless ele-&#xD;
ment of the s~ene, with their dun-colored hedges,&#xD;
their wide expanse of sere plants, and their frag-&#xD;
ments of unpicked cotton hanging in melancholy&#xD;
shreds from the withered stalks. All around the&#xD;
horizon was a broad band of pale-yellow light,&#xD;
and this, together with the singular softness of&#xD;
the aj~mosphere, made Katharine sure that there&#xD;
would soon be a change in the weather. "It will&#xD;
rain to-morrow," said Jack, looking up at the&#xD;
sky. "Miss Tresham, don't you feel the wind?&#xD;
Papa sdys that when it blows this way, it always&#xD;
brings.rain. There, Ponto !-there goes a rabbit,&#xD;
sir!"&#xD;
Ponto, who was a large Newfoundland dog,&#xD;
had been brought along for the purpose of chas-&#xD;
ing rabbits, and was not at all averse to the&#xD;
amusement. In fact, he saw the poor, little&#xD;
furry wanderer before Jack did, and was off at&#xD;
a mad gallop, followed headlong by all the chil-&#xD;
dren. A turn in the road soon hid them from&#xD;
&#xD;
the sight of the governess., and she gave a high&#xD;
of relief. She liked them, and their bright ani-&#xD;
mal spirits never jarred on her as the spirits of&#xD;
grown people sometimes did; but just now she&#xD;
was glad to have the sombre winter scene all to&#xD;
herself, and much obliged to Ponto and the rab-&#xD;
bit who had secured this solitude. To her, as to&#xD;
a great many other people, there was a singular&#xD;
charm in the leaden sky, the bare woods, and&#xD;
brown hills, the dun neutral tints which went to&#xD;
make up the scene. Afar off; between some&#xD;
fields, there was a clump of trees, and a small&#xD;
house from which a column of blue smoke rose&#xD;
against the sky. Katharine looked at it wist-&#xD;
fully. "I wonder if the people who live there&#xD;
are bappy?" she thought. "I wonder if they&#xD;
look for any thing, expect any thing, dread any&#xD;
thing! Oh, me! I am sorry for them if they&#xD;
do!" As she went her way, between the zigzag&#xD;
rail fences and sear hedges, this train of not very&#xD;
cheerful thought colored the whole scene. She&#xD;
thought that she liked it because it agreed with&#xD;
her mood; but, in truth, if her mood had been&#xD;
different, every thing would have borne a different&#xD;
seeming to her eyes. So it is with us. If our&#xD;
hearts are heavy, the most beautiful landscape&#xD;
that ever smiled grows dark and dreary; while,&#xD;
if they are light, the sunshine from them over-&#xD;
flows and colors with its own tints all the world&#xD;
around us. Katharine's world was made up of&#xD;
dull neutral hues just now, leaden grays, and cold&#xD;
browns, and dun, dark purples. We have no&#xD;
right to put the earth in mourning for our own&#xD;
troubles, but many of us do it nevertheless.&#xD;
Morton House was farther off than she had&#xD;
remembered, and the afternoon was very nearly&#xD;
spent when she and her noisy charges walked&#xD;
up the avenue, and came in sight of the circular&#xD;
terrace and the brown old house set in the midst&#xD;
of it. This was Katharine's first fulfilment of the&#xD;
promise she had given Mrs. Gordon, and she could&#xD;
not help feeling a little nervous with regard to&#xD;
what her reception might be. Would the lady&#xD;
be kind and gracious, as she had been before? or&#xD;
would she think that, for a stranger, Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am was presuming too speedily on her invita-&#xD;
tion? "She is said to be very eccentric," Kath-&#xD;
arine thought to herself, with a slight feeling of&#xD;
dismay-" one of the people who can be charm-&#xD;
ing one day, and freezing the next, Mrs. Marks&#xD;
says. Will she be charming or freezing to-day,&#xD;
I wonder? I almost wish I had not come." It&#xD;
was too late for retreat, however. At that mo-&#xD;
ment, from some quarter or other, Felix espied&#xD;
them, and bore down with a shout of pleasure.&#xD;
&#xD;
Five minutes later, they were entering the&#xD;
hall.&#xD;
Felix left them in the drawing-room, while&#xD;
he went to announce their arrival to his mother,&#xD;
and in a moment returned, accompanied by Har-&#xD;
rison. "Mrs. Gordon's compliments; would the&#xD;
children please go with Mass Felix to the nursery;&#xD;
and she would be glad to see Miss Tresham in her&#xD;
own room." This was the substance of the mes-&#xD;
sage delivered by the servant; and, while Felix&#xD;
led off his visitors, with eager assurances that&#xD;
the place where he was going to take them was&#xD;
not a nursery at all, but a good, big room, where&#xD;
his playthings were kept, Miss Tresham followed&#xD;
Harrison across the hall, and was ushered into the&#xD;
pleasant sitting-room where she had been intro-&#xD;
duced before.&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon was lying on a couch by the fire,&#xD;
and looked very ill, her visitor thought. She&#xD;
raised herself; however, and, extending her hand,&#xD;
smiled with pleasant cordiality.&#xD;
"So you are really as good as your ~vord,&#xD;
Miss Tresham, and have come to see me. I need&#xD;
not say you are heartily welcome. Sit down. Is&#xD;
it not very cold and gloomy out-of-doors?"&#xD;
Evidently, if Mrs. Gordon, was "eccentric,"&#xD;
and had different moods for different days, this&#xD;
was one of her most gracious moods, and one&#xD;
of her brightest days ~At least, so Katharine&#xD;
thought, as she felt that her instinct about the&#xD;
visit had not misled her, and as, obeying the&#xD;
motion of her hostess'~ hand, she sat down by&#xD;
the fire. She did not know whether to allude td&#xD;
the traces of suffering so plainly marked on her&#xD;
companion's face; but the latter relieved her&#xD;
uncertainty on this point at once.&#xD;
"I have been quite ill," she said, "and I&#xD;
am sure you think that I am still, in looks at&#xD;
least, the worse for it. At my age, one shows.&#xD;
so plainly things which pass unnoticed in youth.&#xD;
If you had come a day or two ago, I could not&#xD;
have seen you; but to-day I am grateful for the&#xD;
presence of such a bright face."&#xD;
The bright face smiled and blushed a ~ttle at&#xD;
this, but soon recovered its usual composure.&#xD;
"I am glad I came, then," said Katharine.&#xD;
"I was a little doubtful, thinking I might trouble&#xD;
you. But I always mean what I say myself,&#xD;
and I gave you credit for meaning what you&#xD;
.said when you asked me to come."&#xD;
"You were quite right," said Mrs. Gordon,&#xD;
smiling; "I meant exactlywhat I said, and' per-&#xD;
haps a little more. I have lived a long, time in&#xD;
the hottest fever of the world," she went on,&#xD;
"and this stagnant life is almost too much for&#xD;

68                          MORTON HOUSE.                                                                     R. G.                             69&#xD;
&#xD;
me. In a measure, it was pure selfishness which&#xD;
made me press you to return. I cannot ask the&#xD;
people of Lagrange to come here. I have gone&#xD;
out of their life and their world forever. But&#xD;
you are different. The first moment I saw you, I&#xD;
knew that you were different; and I knew, or&#xD;
thought I knew, that you would be a person&#xD;
worth knowing, and a companion worth having."&#xD;
"You flatter me," said Katharine, with her&#xD;
breath a little taken away.&#xD;
"I never flatter anybody," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon, coolly. "You l~now as well as I do&#xD;
that, although you are not particularly pretty,&#xD;
and, for aught I know, may not be particularly&#xD;
clever, you are particularly attractive. I don't&#xD;
wonder-" she paused, with a smile; then added,&#xD;
"Won't you take off your bonnet, and spend the&#xD;
evening with me?"&#xD;
"I should be very glad to do so; but I have&#xD;
the children under my care, and I must take&#xD;
them home before dark"&#xD;
"Can't they go home by themselves? can't&#xD;
Babette take them? Well" - as Katharine&#xD;
shook her head in reply to both propositions-&#xD;
"I won't press you. But leave the children at&#xD;
home another day, and come prepared to spend&#xD;
the evening. Surely, your holidays begin very&#xD;
soon now?"&#xD;
"They have begun already. Today was my&#xD;
last of school."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear that. I can hope, then,&#xD;
to see you often in the course of the next two'&#xD;
weeks?"&#xD;
"I-don't-know," said Katharine, doubt-&#xD;
fully. The moment afterward she caught a look&#xD;
of surprise on Mrs. Gordon's face, and went on,&#xD;
hastily: "I mean that I may not be at Mrs.&#xD;
Marks's during the holidays. I received a&#xD;
Christmas invitation today, and I have' been&#xD;
doubting whether or not I should accept it.&#xD;
Would "-a pause ..-" would you think me very&#xD;
impertinent, Mrs. Gordon, if I asked your advice&#xD;
abo~it doing so?"&#xD;
"I should not think you impertinent at all,&#xD;
Miss Tresham; and I should be very glad to ad-&#xD;
vise you to the best of my abilit~ieaving selfish-&#xD;
ness out of the question."&#xD;
Katharine sat still and looked in the fire for&#xD;
a minute, puckering' her brow into a slight frown&#xD;
as she' did so. Then she turned round and&#xD;
smiled at her hostess.&#xD;
"Don't think me very vacillating and irreso-&#xD;
lute," she said; "but the fact is, I declined the&#xD;
invitation this morning, and I told Mrs. Marks at&#xD;
diuae~' that I positively would not accept it; yet&#xD;
&#xD;
such is the perversity of human nature that I am&#xD;
half inclined to retract my own words now, and&#xD;
go. If one or two doubts could be solved for&#xD;
me, I think I should."&#xD;
"And can I solve those doubts?"&#xD;
"If you choose, I am sure you can. Of&#xD;
course, you know enough of your cousin to&#xD;
tell-"&#xD;
She stopped short, for Mrs. Gordon raised up&#xD;
and looked at her with astonished eyes.&#xD;
"My cousin?" she repeated. "You surely&#xD;
don't mean Mrs. Annesley?"&#xD;
"Yes, I do," said Katharine, laughing a lit-&#xD;
tle. "You can't be more surprised than I was.&#xD;
I had never seen Mrs. Annesley before; and this&#xD;
morning she called on me, and absolutely asked&#xD;
me to spend Christmas at Anneadale-more than&#xD;
that, she would not accept a refusal; but, when&#xD;
I declined the invitation, said that she would&#xD;
give me until to-morrow to consider, and would&#xD;
send for my final answer then. Now, if I am&#xD;
not impertinent, pray tell me what she means by&#xD;
it, and what I ought to do."&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon sank bacon her cushions, and&#xD;
smiled. Instead of answering Katharine's ques-&#xD;
tion, she asked another:&#xD;
"You say that you would like to go?"&#xD;
"Yes," said the girl, frankly. "I like pleas.&#xD;
ure very much-more than is right, I am afraid&#xD;
-and I should like very much to go. It has&#xD;
been four years since I danced the last time,"&#xD;
said she, looking at Mrs. Gordon gravely; "and&#xD;
I should like to go to another ball. There is al-&#xD;
ways a Christmas ball at Annesdale, Mrs. Marks&#xD;
says. If I knew why Mrs. Annesley asked me,&#xD;
and if I could be sure that she really wants me,&#xD;
I should certainly take the goods the gods pro.&#xD;
vide, and go."&#xD;
"Go, then," said Mrs. Gordon. "Take the&#xD;
goods the gods provide, and enjoy them while&#xD;
you can. I am able to set your mind at rest on&#xD;
both those points. I think I know why Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley asked you; and, as she asked you, I&#xD;
am sure she wants you to go."&#xD;
"This is your advice?"&#xD;
"This is certainly, my advice."&#xD;
"Not given because I was foolish enoughto&#xD;
say that I liked pleasure, but honestly and sin-&#xD;
cerely?"&#xD;
"Honestly and sincerely," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon, smiling. "You don't suppose I would&#xD;
think you worth much if you had not youth&#xD;
enough in you to like pleasure? The loveof it&#xD;
is born in us, and is the strongest cord that&#xD;
draws us heavenward; as well as the heaviest&#xD;
&#xD;
fetter that binds us to the earth. Don't grudge&#xD;
your youth its natural impulses and pleasures.&#xD;
Believe me, the apathy and the distaste of later&#xD;
life will come on you soon enough."&#xD;
"But Annesdale-" said Katharine.&#xD;
"Go to Anneadale, by all means. I don't&#xD;
simply advise; I am bold enough to urge you to&#xD;
do so. Shall I tell you why? You are not a&#xD;
simpering, foolish young lady; so I think I may.&#xD;
It is evident that Mrs. Annesley, from personal&#xD;
reasons-don't blush, my dear, for I don't mean&#xD;
to be as plain-spoken as I was before-is anxious.&#xD;
to see and know you. She has taken a better&#xD;
way of doing this than I should have given her&#xD;
credit for-a more delicate way, that is. Don't&#xD;
deny yourself a pleasure, and repulse her at the&#xD;
same time. If you have any liking, any cordial&#xD;
friendship, for Morton, meet his mother's ad-&#xD;
vances frankly, and go to Annesdale."&#xD;
"But," said Katharine, blushing deeply, de-&#xD;
spite her companion's admonition to the con-&#xD;
trary, "that is exactly why I hesitate. Mr.&#xD;
Annesley has been very kind to me - if we&#xD;
were on the same social level, I might almost&#xD;
say very attentive-and I don't know what con-.&#xD;
struction might be placed upon this visit."&#xD;
" My dear," said Mrs. Gordon quietly, "society&#xD;
is a state of hollow but very useful forms. We&#xD;
all know that they are hollow, but still, we all&#xD;
observe them. Mrs. Annesley has asked you to&#xD;
spend Christmas at Anneadale, and you are not&#xD;
supposed to know any thing of the motive for&#xD;
this invitation. If any motive is concealed&#xD;
beneath it, what difference does that make? 'If&#xD;
she asks you for one reason, and you go for&#xD;
another, what matter of that? Have you not&#xD;
lived long enough in the world to know that life&#xD;
-this outside, social life-is merely a game of&#xD;
chance and skill? This visit will bind you to&#xD;
nothing. The day after you come away, or the&#xD;
day before, for that matter, you will be at per-&#xD;
fect liberty to reject Morton if he asks you to&#xD;
marry him. I hope you won't do any thing half&#xD;
so foolish, though," she added, with a smile. "I&#xD;
knew his father well; and Morton is Edgar An-&#xD;
nesley over again. No girl could ever do bet-&#xD;
ter than to accept him."&#xD;
"I am sure of that," said Katharine, kindly&#xD;
and cordially. Bum she did not say it as if she&#xD;
had any personal interest in the question of&#xD;
accepting or rejecting the young owner of An.&#xD;
neadale. She spoke with~ her eyes fastened&#xD;
thoughtfully on the fire; and when she looked&#xD;
up, she added suddenly, "Then, once for all, you&#xD;
advise mete go?&#xD;
&#xD;
"Once for all, I do. Will you prove an en.&#xD;
caption to most adviceasking people, and take&#xD;
my advice?"&#xD;
"Yes, I will," said the girl, rising and stand-&#xD;
ing before the fire, with the ruddy light flicker-&#xD;
ing over her bright face and graceful figure. 1&#xD;
am very much obliged to you for giving it," she&#xD;
went on; 't aiid I should be very ungrateful if I&#xD;
did not take it after you have been so frank with&#xD;
me. I shall write to Mrs. Annesley to-morrow,&#xD;
and tell her that I accept her invitation. May I&#xD;
come to see you when I return, and tell you how&#xD;
much I have enjoyed myself?" -&#xD;
"Come to see me certainly, and tell me all&#xD;
about it. I shall be very glad to hear every&#xD;
thing. But must you go now?"&#xD;
"Yes, it is growing late, and we have ~ 'long&#xD;
walk from here home. Neither the children nor&#xD;
myself mind it, though," she added, as the word&#xD;
"carriage" formed on Mrs. Gordon's lips. "I&#xD;
must bid you good-evening, and I hope you will&#xD;
be well when I come again.&#xD;
With a sudden impulse which, if she had&#xD;
stopped a minute to consider, would certainly&#xD;
have been repressed, she bent down and laid&#xD;
her lips on Mrs. Gordon's cheek. It was a very&#xD;
light caress, but the latter felt it and started.&#xD;
Then she looked up with a smile.&#xD;
"You are certainly very charming," she said.&#xD;
"I don't wonder that others, besides myself~ have&#xD;
found it out."&#xD;

CHAPTER xiv.&#xD;
n. a.&#xD;
WHEN Mrs. Annesley reached home, she found&#xD;
that the whole family of Taylors, mother and&#xD;
daughters, had arrived at Annesdale during her&#xD;
absence, and were established to "spend the&#xD;
day," according to the irksome custom which&#xD;
then prevailed, and for that matter still prevails,&#xD;
in country districts. Their bonnets were laid&#xD;
aside, their work was brought out, and the draw.&#xD;
ing-room was full of the sound of their chatter&#xD;
and laughter, when the lady of the house entered.&#xD;
Poor Adela was on duty, and gave a glance corn.&#xD;
pounded ludicrously of resignation and disgust&#xD;
to her mother. Mrs. Annesley telegraphed a&#xD;
reply in much the same spirit, then swept for-&#xD;
ward and greeted her guests with effusion.&#xD;
"Dear Mrs. Taylor, what a pleasant surprise 1&#xD;
How kind of you to come!" etc., etc.-" Maria,&#xD;
how well you are looking ! - Fanny, has your.&#xD;

70                         MORTON HOUSE.                                                                     R G.                              71&#xD;
&#xD;
neuralgia quite gone ?-Augusta, I need not as]&#xD;
how yos are-I never saw you more blooming&#xD;
Of course you have come to spend the day.&#xD;
cannot think of letting you off1" etc.&#xD;
They all spent the day with religious exact&#xD;
tude. It was nightfall before the last item o~&#xD;
news was discussed, the knitting-needles am&#xD;
worsted-work put away, the bonnets resumed&#xD;
and the carriage ordered. Mrs. Annesley gav&#xD;
a heart-felt sigh as she stood at the window anc&#xD;
watched them drive away. "What a relief P&#xD;
she said. "It is dreadful to think what bore~&#xD;
those people are!" ~&#xD;
"The night is going to be dark, and the roadt&#xD;
are very heavy," said Adds. "I shouldn't b&#xD;
surprised if they had a bad time getting home-&#xD;
and serve them right, tool for staying so late&#xD;
Now, mamma, what news? I have been dying&#xD;
to hear, ever since you came; and I thought they&#xD;
never were going."&#xD;
"Nothing very satisfactory," her mother an-&#xD;
swered, without turnin'r round. "She declines&#xD;
to come, ~&#xD;
"What!" said Adela; and~ even in the soft&#xD;
mingling of firelight and twilight, it was evident&#xD;
that her face felL "It can't be possible that&#xD;
she declines to come, mamma!"&#xD;
"She does, though. She refused the invita-&#xD;
tion absolutely and mit very courteously."&#xD;
"Then what will you do?"&#xD;
"What I will do is yet to bedecided-what I&#xD;
did do was to decline to accept her refusal. I in-&#xD;
sisted on her taking a day to consider the mat-&#xD;
ter, and said 1 would send for her answer to-&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
"That is snore than I should have done,"&#xD;
said Adela, flushing. "She will think she has&#xD;
~gairted every thing."&#xD;
"She is welcome to think so,";was the quiet&#xD;
response.&#xD;
"It is nothing but insolence!" cried Mrs.&#xD;
Freneb. "I wish I had her in my power, I'd-&#xD;
Pd stinngle her! Mamma, I don't see how you&#xD;
ever submitted to it!"&#xD;
"We must submit to a great deal, Adds, if&#xD;
we want to carry our points."&#xD;
* "And do you think you will carry this one?"&#xD;
"I thinkehe will come."&#xD;
"But if she don't?"&#xD;
"Then I shall be disappointed, but not seri-&#xD;
ously so. All I need is time; and time, I think,&#xD;
I can induce Morton to grant me. Since I have&#xD;
given a conditional consent, he has promised that&#xD;
he will not speak until I have seen and judged&#xD;
of.-.--of this governess."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I should make that a long process."&#xD;
"No; for I hope it will not be long before I&#xD;
I have proofs concerning her which not even Mor-&#xD;
ton can disregard.'t,&#xD;
"And meanwhile?"&#xD;
"And meanwhile, she cannot fail to suffer by&#xD;
I close contrast with Irene Vernon. She is not&#xD;
pretty, Adela."&#xD;
"N-o, mamma, not prett~r, perhaps-but&#xD;
I handsome in a certain style that men like. If&#xD;
you could have seen her talking to Morton at&#xD;
the pond that day! It was all her fault that he&#xD;
lost sight of that hateful child, and had such a&#xD;
frightful accident. Of course, Irene is a beauty&#xD;
-but I wouldn't trust to this girl's not being&#xD;
- pretty, if I were you."&#xD;
"Trust to it! You don't suppose I have&#xD;
lived to my age, without learning that there are&#xD;
many things besides a pretty face that make a&#xD;
fool of a man. It certainly is not this girl's face&#xD;
* which has turned that poor boy's head. Let mc&#xD;
see-what is the day of the month?"&#xD;
"The nineteenth," answered Adela, wonder-&#xD;
ing a little at the question.&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley walked to the fire, making&#xD;
some calculation as she went. Mrs. French, who&#xD;
had meanwhile taken a seat, watched her with&#xD;
languid interest, She did not pretend to under.&#xD;
stand all her mother's schemes; but her reliance&#xD;
was, in a different way, quite as complete as&#xD;
Morton's. She had the m6st profound admira-&#xD;
tion for her mother's diplomatic abilities; and&#xD;
did not honestly believe that any cause was hope.&#xD;
less as long as she retained the management of it.&#xD;
"Well, mamma," she said, at last, "what are&#xD;
you thinking about?"&#xD;
"I am thinking," answered Mrs. Annesley,&#xD;
absently, "how long it takes a letter to go to&#xD;
London, and an answer to return."&#xD;
"A- letter ?-to go?-" Adela sat up and&#xD;
stared at her mother. "A letter to go to Lon-&#xD;
don! Mamma, what do you mean?"&#xD;
"I mean," said Mrs. Annesley, glancing&#xD;
round at the closed door, as if to make sure&#xD;
that nobody was within hearing-" I mean that&#xD;
I have no idea that my son shall marry an adv~n-&#xD;
turess; and that I have been making inquiries&#xD;
about Miss Tresham for some time."&#xD;
Mrs. French' gave a little scream, half of&#xD;
excitement, half of slightly comic alarm. "Good&#xD;
gracious, you don't say so! Why, this is becom-&#xD;
ing quite interesting. Wouldn't Morton be vexed&#xD;
if he knew? Tell me all about it, mamma-how&#xD;
long ago did you begin, and what have you found&#xD;
out?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I can't tplk about it here," said Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
ley, a little nervously. "Morton might come in&#xD;
any minute; and I would not let him know for&#xD;
the world. When I have found out what I want&#xD;
to know, I shall lay the matter before him~ but,&#xD;
until then, he would not listen to any thing I&#xD;
could urge. His scruples on the subject are ab-&#xD;
surd."&#xD;
"Most of his ideas are," said Mrs. French,&#xD;
coolly. "Dear me, there iz his step in the hail!&#xD;
May I come to your room tonight, mamma, and&#xD;
hear all about it? Say yes, please."&#xD;
"I suppose you may, though I am half-afraid&#xD;
to trust you.&#xD;
"Never fear about trusting me. I'm not like&#xD;
some foolish women, who tell every thing to their&#xD;
husbands. Frank is a good fellow, and tells me&#xD;
all his secrets; but he doesn't hear any of mine.&#xD;
-Do you, Frank?"&#xD;
"Do I what, Adela?" asked Frank, who en-&#xD;
tered at the moment in a very splashed and dis-&#xD;
reputable cOndition. "1 don't mean to stop a&#xD;
minute," he said, hastily, as he was transfixed&#xD;
by his wife's glance. "I only came in to tell&#xD;
you what splendid luck we've had. I never saw&#xD;
the pond so flush of ducks before. Morton's a&#xD;
better shot than I am, and he bagged no less&#xD;
than-"&#xD;
"Frank, if you don't go up-stairs this minute&#xD;
and take off that abominable corduroy, I will&#xD;
never speak to you again!~~ cried Mrs. French,&#xD;
in a high-treble key. "It smells horribly! Who&#xD;
cares about your miserable ducks? I don't!"&#xD;
"You'll care about eating them, 1 expect,"&#xD;
said the good-natured Frank, as he left the room&#xD;
rather crestfallen, and went to change the objec-&#xD;
tionable corduroy, which, being thoroughly wet,&#xD;
had, in fact, a: very fs~r from agreeable odor.&#xD;
A few minutes afterward Morton entered, and,&#xD;
having had the discretion to e~nnge his dress,&#xD;
was welcomed more cordially than his fellow-&#xD;
sportsman had been.&#xD;
In answer to his mother's inquiries, he said&#xD;
that they had had a very good day's sport; that&#xD;
the ducks were plenty, and, by no means hard to&#xD;
approach; and that their game-bag wasfull.&#xD;
"Frank enjoyed it extremely," he said, in a&#xD;
tone that was rather tired. "For my part, I am&#xD;
not as fond of sport as I used to be."&#xD;
"I suppose it takes a fox-chase to rouse&#xD;
you," said Mrs. Annesley. "By-the-way, there&#xD;
will be so~ne fox-hunting next week, will there&#xD;
not?"&#xD;
"To be sure," answered Morton. "French&#xD;
was talking about it to-day. Langdon, and Tal-&#xD;
&#xD;
cott, and half a dozen more, will be here, who~&#xD;
care for little besides fox-hunting. I wrote t6&#xD;
Godfrey Seymour and told him to bring his&#xD;
hounds with him when he came."&#xD;
"Isn't your own pack a good one?"&#xD;
"The more the merrier, you know; and no&#xD;
hounds are like Seymour's. He has the best-&#xD;
trained pack in the country."&#xD;
"I hope he will come."&#xD;
"I hope so, indeed, for his own sake as well&#xD;
as on account of his dogs. There isn't a better&#xD;
fellow living than Godfrey. Is your party quite&#xD;
made up, mother?" he went on. "If there is&#xD;
anybody else to be invited, you know you ought&#xD;
to be attending to it. Almost everybody has&#xD;
made engagements for Christmas by this time.~~&#xD;
"There is nobody else to be invited," said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley. She paused a moment, then&#xD;
added, c~uietly: "I gave the last invitation in&#xD;
Tallahoma to-day."&#xD;
"In Tallahoma!" echoed her son. "Whom&#xD;
did you ask in Tallahoma? John Warwick?"&#xD;
"No, quite a different person. Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am."&#xD;
The young man started. That name was the&#xD;
last he had expected to hear, and looked at his&#xD;
mother for a moment in surprise. Then he went&#xD;
round to the back of her chair, and, bending&#xD;
down, kissed her brow just where the hair was&#xD;
parted.&#xD;
"My dear mother, thank you," he said, sim-&#xD;
ply.&#xD;
"Don't thank me," said Mrs. Annesley, in&#xD;
rather a hard voice. "I need not tell you that it&#xD;
cost me a struggle, Morton. But I promised you&#xD;
tO see and know her, and I thought this oppor-&#xD;
tunity the best for the purpose. People will&#xD;
wonder, no doubt; but we must submit to that."&#xD;
"Let them wonder," said he, a little haught-&#xD;
ily; but his tone softened, as he added: "You&#xD;
were quite right; this will be the best opportu-&#xD;
nity for seeing and knowing her. Is there noth-&#xD;
ing that I can do for you, mother?" he went on.&#xD;
"Is there nothing you could ask of rile? I&#xD;
should like to show you in some way how much&#xD;
I appreciate the sacrifice you have nmade.~v&#xD;
"Yes, there is one thing," said Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
icy, perceiving her advantage, and seizing it&#xD;
without an instant's hesitation. "You can cer-&#xD;
tainly do one thing for me, Morton. I have&#xD;
asked this girl here for your sake. For my&#xD;
sake promise me that while she is here you will&#xD;
refrain from' paying her any marked attention,&#xD;
that you will not give people any opportunity to&#xD;
couple your name and hers together."&#xD;
&#xD;

72                         MORTON HOUSE.                                                                    R. G.                             73&#xD;
&#xD;
Morton's brow contracted a little. He&#xD;
thought his mother had taken an unfair advan-&#xD;
tage of his offer, but he did not say so; indeed,&#xD;
after a moment, he saw that he had no alterna-&#xD;
tive but to consent. He had rashly laid himself&#xD;
open to this, and he must abide by his own&#xD;
words.&#xD;
* "I promise," he said, a little coldly, "but I&#xD;
did not think you would have asked such a thing&#xD;
of me."&#xD;
His mother rose and laid her hand on his&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
"Why, my dear son? Why should I not&#xD;
ask it of you? You know where all my hopes&#xD;
for you are fixed. Can you wonder that 1 do not&#xD;
wish you to put an impassable barrier between&#xD;
yourself and their fulfilment?"&#xD;
He knew what she meant-he knew she was&#xD;
thinking of Irene Vernon-so he did not answer.&#xD;
He had very sensitive ideas of his own, and he&#xD;
showed them in nothing more than in the reti-&#xD;
cence he always observed with regard to topics&#xD;
like these. Nothing would have induced him to&#xD;
mention Miss Vernon's name in a connection of&#xD;
this sort. After a while, he sighed a little, and&#xD;
put his arm round his mother.&#xD;
"You must bear with me," he said. "Moth.&#xD;
er, dear, it is hard that at this late day I should&#xD;
begin to be a trouble to you; but be patient, be&#xD;
hopeful, and perhaps in time we may live it&#xD;
down."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley went to her own room early&#xD;
that night. She was tired, she said her drive&#xD;
to town and the Taylors together had quite cx-&#xD;
hansted her, and her only chance of being mod-&#xD;
erately well the next day was to retire at an hour&#xD;
that Adela was fond of calling uncivilized-Ade-&#xD;
la's pet idea of civilization being to go to bed&#xD;
at one o'clock and rise at twelve. To-night,&#xD;
however, Mrs. French made no demur at the&#xD;
move. She yawned and said the Taylors had&#xD;
done for her, too; then bade her brother good-&#xD;
nigh~, and followed her mother up-stairs.&#xD;
"You are going to smeke?" sh~ said to her&#xD;
husband, who muttered something of the sort in&#xD;
the hall below. "Oh, very well; take your time&#xD;
about it; I am going to mamma's room for a&#xD;
while."&#xD;
Her face vanished from over the balustrade,&#xD;
and the minute afterward the two gentlemen&#xD;
heard her dress rustling along the upper pas.&#xD;
sage, a~md the opening and closing of Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley's door.&#xD;
"They are good for a two-hours' gossip at&#xD;
least," said Mr. French, on hearing this. "That's&#xD;
&#xD;
their notion of 'going to bed early and getting a&#xD;
long rest!' Come, Morto~, we'll have a smoke.&#xD;
Do you know where the papers are that came&#xD;
this morning" ~"&#xD;
In Mrs. Annesley's chamber a large fire was&#xD;
blazing brightly and making the whole room&#xD;
radiant with that beautiful glow which a judi-&#xD;
cious mixture of pine, and oak, and hickory, can&#xD;
alone diffuse, when Adela entered. It rendered&#xD;
any other light almost unnecessary; but a lamp&#xD;
burned with quiet, steady lustre on the table at&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley's side, and, scattered around its&#xD;
base, were several letters and a newspaper.&#xD;
She looked up from the pages of one of the&#xD;
former when the door opened and she saw her&#xD;
daughter.&#xD;
"I thought your curiosity would not let you&#xD;
remain downstairs long," she said. "Come in,&#xD;
bnt be sure and close the door securely."&#xD;
"Well, mamma, I'm all impatience," said&#xD;
Adela, after she had waited some time, and her&#xD;
mother took no further notice of her, but went&#xD;
on reading the letter she held.&#xD;
"Look at that, then," said her mother, push-&#xD;
ing the newspaper across the table and pointing&#xD;
with her finger to a particular paragraph.&#xD;
Adela took it up wonderingly. The sheet&#xD;
was mammoth, and proved to be a copy of the&#xD;
London Times, in date five or six months old.&#xD;
Following the direction of the finger, her eye fell&#xD;
at once on the following advertisement:&#xD;
"If the friends or relations of Katharine&#xD;
Tresham, formerly of the British West indies,&#xD;
and lately of Cumberland, England, are desirous&#xD;
of knowing her present whereabouts' and ad-&#xD;
dress, they can obtain this information by ad-&#xD;
dressing R. G., box 1084, Mobile, Alabama."&#xD;
Adela first stared, then caught her breath,&#xD;
and looked up at her mother.&#xD;
"is it possible you wrote this, mamma?"&#xD;
"Yes, I wrote it," Mrs. Annesley answered.&#xD;
"I could not let matters go on as they had been&#xD;
doing for months past. I felt, and i still feel&#xD;
sure there is something wrong about the girl.&#xD;
Being confident of this, and seeing Morton's&#xD;
growing infatuation, i knew that to lift the cur-&#xD;
tain from her life was the only hope of saving&#xD;
him, if i have done her harm, she has only&#xD;
herself and her ambitious schemes to thank for&#xD;
it. Any parent would hold me more than justi~&#xD;
fled in the means i have used."&#xD;
"Oh, as for that," said Adela, "i think the&#xD;
means are excellent. But i wonder how you&#xD;
&#xD;
ever thought of them, and how did you get this&#xD;
inserted"'"&#xD;
"I sent it to Mr. Russell when he was in&#xD;
England last summer, lie is thoroughly trust-&#xD;
worthy, and will neither mention the fact nor&#xD;
ask any questions. it was inserted in the Timas&#xD;
for a month, and he sent me this copy."&#xD;
"Did any thing come of it?"&#xD;
"Something came of it sooner than 1 had&#xD;
ventured to hope. Before the advertisement&#xD;
had appeared a week, a letter was written, and&#xD;
reached me in due time."&#xD;
She handed a letter across the table, and&#xD;
Adela received it eagerly. Her curiosity was&#xD;
fairly in a flame, and, although she tore open&#xD;
the folded sheet very hastily~ she had still time&#xD;
enough to observe that the paper, writing, and&#xD;
whole style of the missive, were unexceptionable.&#xD;
It was evidently written by a man, and was quite&#xD;
terse:&#xD;
"If H. G. can give any accurate information&#xD;
concerning the present whereabouts and address&#xD;
of Katharine Tresham, formerly of Porto Rico, in&#xD;
the West Indies, and lately of Dornthorne Place,&#xD;
Cumberland, England, he will be entitled to the&#xD;
thanks of her friends, and can obtain a liberal&#xD;
reward by addressing Messrs. Rich &amp;amp; Little,&#xD;
Lincoln's Inn, London."&#xD;
After Adela read the last words twice over,&#xD;
she looked up at her mother, and shrugged&#xD;
her shoulders. "I don't think the reply gives&#xD;
much more information than the advertisement,"&#xD;
she said.&#xD;
"'When that came," answered Mrs. Annesley,&#xD;
"I saw in a moment that I had gone to work&#xD;
wrong-that instead of offering to give informa-&#xD;
tion, I should have asked for it. I saw there&#xD;
was a secret to keep; and this friend who offers&#xD;
me a liberal reward, and refers me to a couple&#xD;
of lawyers, was as much interested as the girl&#xD;
herself in keeping it. I felt sure, however, that&#xD;
he did not know her whereabouts, that he was&#xD;
honestly anxious to be enlightened. In that&#xD;
case, I thought I saw my way, and this is what&#xD;
I wrote.&#xD;
Again she pushed a letter across the table,&#xD;
and again Adela took it up and read:&#xD;
"If the gentleman who referred R. G. to&#xD;
Messrs. Rich &amp;amp; Little will communicate his own&#xD;
address to box 1084, Mobile, Alabama, he can&#xD;
obtain the information he desires, and be spared&#xD;
the payment of a reward."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well! and what was the answer to&#xD;
tkis?"&#xD;
"The answer to this came very shortly, and&#xD;
puzzled me not a little. Here it is."&#xD;
The second missive, in the same writing, and&#xD;
on the same paper as the first, was in turn handed&#xD;
across the table and read:&#xD;
"Mr. St. John has received H. G.'s letter. If&#xD;
R. G. possesses any real knowledge of Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am's place of abode, and objects to communicate.&#xD;
ing that knowledge through Mr. St. John's law-&#xD;
yers, he can address directly-&#xD;
"HENRY ST. Jous, EsQ.,&#xD;
"Peste Restante,&#xD;
"Mr. St. John !-Mr. St. John's lawyers!" re-&#xD;
peated Adela. "Well, Miss Tresham certainly&#xD;
seems to have a grand sort of person interested&#xD;
*in her! Dear me, mamma, suppose she has run&#xD;
away from her friends, and is really a lady, after&#xD;
all? "&#xD;
"She is much more likely to be an adventure~&#xD;
ess," said Mrs. Annesley, bitterly. "That high.&#xD;
sounding name did not deceive me for a minute.&#xD;
By return mail, I forwarded her address to Mr.&#xD;
Henry St. John, and requested some information&#xD;
concerning her, for personal and family reasons.&#xD;
No answer whatever came to that letter. After&#xD;
waiting some time, and finding that none was&#xD;
likely to come, and that evidently nothing had&#xD;
occurred to call Miss Tresham away from La-&#xD;
grange, I wrote to the lawyer in Mobile, through&#xD;
~vhom I received these letters, and requested him&#xD;
to make inquiries in London about this Mr. St.&#xD;
John. He did so at once, and I am now waiting&#xD;
to hear the result. It may be some time before&#xD;
I obtain the facts I want, but every thing is pos-&#xD;
sible to patience and money, and I shall obtain&#xD;
them in the end. if it takes my whole fortune,"&#xD;
she went on, passionately, "I will obtain them,&#xD;
sooner than let my son wreck his life by marry-&#xD;
ing this woman."&#xD;
"I am inclined to think that Mr. St. John is&#xD;
a nice person," said Adela, gravely regarding the&#xD;
two letters that lay open on the table before&#xD;
her.&#xD;
" I am sure he is a sharper," her mother re-&#xD;
torted, "and probably in league with Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am. Why he should have noticed my advertise.&#xD;
ment at all, puzzles me."&#xD;
"Perhaps because he was afraidd somebody&#xD;
else would," said Adela, too lazy to do battle for&#xD;
her own "nice-person" theory. "Well, main-&#xD;

74                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                           MERRY CHRISTMAS!                      75&#xD;
&#xD;
ma, when do you expect to hear something&#xD;
definite about him?"&#xD;
"I wrote to Mr. Burns the other day, taking&#xD;
the inquiry," her mother answered. "I was&#xD;
looking over his reply when you came in.&#xD;
There it is-you can sec it if you choose."&#xD;
"Of course i choose," said Adela; and&#xD;
suiting the action to the word, she took the&#xD;
indicated letter and opened it. Mr. Burns was&#xD;
thb Mobile lawyer of whom Mrs. Annesley had&#xD;
spoken, and this was what he said:&#xD;
"DzAn MADAM: Your favor of the 3d ultimo&#xD;
came safely to hand. In reply to your inquiries,&#xD;
I am able to say that I hope soon to hear from&#xD;
my agent in London, with regard to the infor-&#xD;
mation you auc anxious to receive. I anticipate&#xD;
little difficulty in obtaining this information, if&#xD;
the addresses which you have furnished me are&#xD;
at all correct. The solicitors at Lincoln's Inn&#xD;
will certainly be able to satisfy you concerning.&#xD;
the real character and standing of Mr. St. John.&#xD;
If we should meet with any difficulty there, it&#xD;
will be a little more troublesome, but quite as&#xD;
practicable to make these inquiries through&#xD;
other channels. In either case, you ~nay be&#xD;
sure of receiving reliable information in a com-&#xD;
paratively short time. I have also forwarded to&#xD;
myagent your copy of Mr. St. John's letter, giv-&#xD;
ing the name of the place where Miss Tresham&#xD;
resided in Cumberland. By prosecuting his in-&#xD;
quiries there, he may be able to learn something&#xD;
of this lady. I hope to receive a letter by the&#xD;
middle of the month, and will forward it to you&#xD;
immediately.&#xD;
"Assuring you of my continued secrecy, and&#xD;
acknowledging your desire that I will not spare&#xD;
expense, I remain,&#xD;
"Very rcspectfi~lly,&#xD;
"WILLIAM F. Buass."&#xD;
Adela philosophically folded up the letter,&#xD;
and returned it to her mother.&#xD;
"1 see now why you gave your consent," she&#xD;
said. "You wanted to make Morton defer mat-&#xD;
ters, and so gain time~"&#xD;
"it was my only hope," said her mother.&#xD;
"I knew that if once Morton spoke to the girl,&#xD;
he would hold fast to his word through every&#xD;
thing. Now 1 may stave oil' a declaration, until&#xD;
1 can show hint who and what she is."&#xD;
"if that is your hope, I should think you&#xD;
were very unwise to ask her to spend a week in&#xD;
the same house with him."&#xD;
"And you don't know that by this very thing&#xD;
&#xD;
I took the surest means of binding him to his&#xD;
promise. He would do any thing sooner than&#xD;
* break it now, that I have, as he thinks, made&#xD;
such a sacrifice for him. But that was not my&#xD;
only reason for asking her. I wanted her here&#xD;
-in my power, under my hand. When the let-&#xD;
ter from London comes, I want to give her a&#xD;
choice between open exposure, or leaving La-&#xD;
grange. Then I do not believe that, once con-&#xD;
trasted with Irene Vernon, she could continue to&#xD;
attract Morton."&#xD;
Adela shook her head.&#xD;
"That's your mistake, mamma," she said.&#xD;
"Morton has known Irene Vernon as long or&#xD;
longer than he han known this girl, and do you&#xD;
suppose he never contrasted them in his mind?&#xD;
I am as anxious as you can be that he should&#xD;
fall in love with her; but I don't think it is like-&#xD;
ly just now."&#xD;
- "We shall see."&#xD;
"Yes, we shall see. But, for my part, I&#xD;
don't believe Miss Tresham will come. I am&#xD;
sure she has sense enough to distrust an invite~&#xD;
tion to Annesdale."&#xD;
"That may be; but, nevertheless, I think&#xD;
she will accept it."&#xD;
The event fully justified this belief. The next&#xD;
day was cloudy and stormy in the extreme, but&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley dispatched a messenger to Talla-&#xD;
homa, and waited anxiously for his return. In&#xD;
an hour or two, a damp note, woefully limp, and&#xD;
odorous of wet linsey, was brought to her. She&#xD;
opened it with two fingers, read the few lines&#xD;
which it contained, and looked up at her daugh-&#xD;
ter with a smile.&#xD;
"it is all right, Adds," she said. "She will&#xD;
come."&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
~nnnt CI{RISTMASl&#xD;
Wxnxzsnxv was Christmas eve; and on Wed-&#xD;
nesday the Annesley equipage rolled majestically&#xD;
up to Mr. Marks's gate, and the children rushed&#xD;
pantingly in with the intelligence that the car-&#xD;
riage had come for Miss Tresham, and the driver&#xD;
said would she please be as quick as possible, for&#xD;
his horses were impatient, and didn't like to&#xD;
stand.&#xD;
Miss Tresham did not- keep the impatient&#xD;
horses, or their more impatient driver, waiting&#xD;
very long. Her trunk was packed, and her ben.&#xD;
&#xD;
net had been on for an hour at least; se--there&#xD;
was nothing to do but say good-by-which, how.&#xD;
ever, was very far from being a short ceremony.&#xD;
There was Mrs. Marks and Mr. Marks, and Mr.&#xD;
Warwick (it was immediately after dinner, which&#xD;
accounted for the presence at home of these two&#xD;
gentlemen) and all the children, and most of the&#xD;
servants, to exchange farewells and good wishes&#xD;
with. Mrs. Marks kissed the young governess as&#xD;
if she had been her own daughter, and bade her&#xD;
take care of herself and look her prettiest, and&#xD;
enjoy herself her best; Mr. Marks shook hands&#xD;
heartily, and hoped she would have a very merry&#xD;
Christmas, and they would all miss her, and keep&#xD;
her Christmas-gifts till she came back, and the&#xD;
children pressed round tumultuously, and list-&#xD;
ened distractedly, while she told Mrs. Marks&#xD;
that if she would look in the top drawer of her&#xD;
bureau the next morning, she would perhaps find&#xD;
that St. Nicholas had visited it; and the servants&#xD;
bobbed up and down in the background, and&#xD;
thrust forward their ebony hands with many&#xD;
" Christmas gift, missis I Wish you merry&#xD;
Christmas, ma'am 1" while Mr. Warwick stood&#xD;
by, and looked with his quiet smile at the whole&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
"I'll take you to the carriage, and bid you&#xD;
good-by there," he said, when Katharine at last&#xD;
turned and extended her hand to him. "You'll&#xD;
never get oil', at this rate. Has the trunk gone&#xD;
out?"&#xD;
"Done strapped on, sir," said Tom, appearing&#xD;
at the open door, and speaking ovcr Judy's yellow&#xD;
turban. "Done strapped on, sir; and John says&#xD;
the horses-"&#xD;
"Tell John to hold his tongue about the&#xD;
horses.-Miss Tresham, when you are ready, I&#xD;
am at your service.~~&#xD;
"I am ready now, Mr. Warwick," said Katha-&#xD;
rine; and wiih a last bright glance around, and a&#xD;
last "Good-by all 1" she went out of the open&#xD;
door, across the piazza, and down the front walk,&#xD;
attended by Mr. Warwick, and followed by all the&#xD;
children and servants. Mr. and Mrs. Marks went&#xD;
no farther than the piazza, but they stood there&#xD;
and watched the departure. "if ever I thought&#xD;
that suck a thing would be!" said the good wom-&#xD;
an to her husband, as she saw Katharine enter&#xD;
the carriage, and bend forward ever the closed&#xD;
door to shake hands with Mr. Warwick and give&#xD;
Nelly a last kiss. Then a touch was given the ins-&#xD;
patient horses, the carriage disappeared, like a&#xD;
glittering vision, round a turn of the road, and&#xD;
the group at the gate returned slowly to the&#xD;
house-all excepting Mr. Warwick, who went&#xD;
&#xD;
on to town, and, although it was Christmas Eve,&#xD;
and high and low, and rich and poor, were all&#xD;
alike rejoicing and taking a holiday, sat himself&#xD;
do~vn to his grim law-books, and seemed to find&#xD;
the same interest in them that he found there&#xD;
every day. -&#xD;
Meanwhile, Katharine was driving at a rapid&#xD;
and easy pace over the country road that led past&#xD;
the gates of Morton House on to Annesdale. The&#xD;
short December afternoon was more than half&#xD;
gone, the shadows were long, and the yellow sun-&#xD;
shine streamed with bright but sad pathos over&#xD;
the distant hills and leafless woods, as the car-&#xD;
riage swept along; the driver and footman talked&#xD;
on the box, and the girl inside, leaning back on&#xD;
the soft cushions and :watching the fields and&#xD;
clumps of trees fly past, asked herself if she was&#xD;
awake or dreaming, if she would really arrive at&#xD;
Annesdale after a while, or if she would rouse&#xD;
up in her own room in Mr. Marks's house.&#xD;
On the whole, she came to the conclusion that&#xD;
she was awake, when the Annesdale gates flew&#xD;
open at the approach of the carriage, and, sweep-&#xD;
ing round the carefully-kept circle, Katharine&#xD;
found herself before a handsome house of soft&#xD;
gray color, built in the Italian style, and spread-&#xD;
ing over a great deal of space, with large wings&#xD;
and many piazzas. The doors of the haIl were&#xD;
wide open, and three or four gentlemen were&#xD;
standing in the front portico. One of them&#xD;
came forward when the carriage stopped, and,&#xD;
putting aside the footman, began opening the&#xD;
door himself. He was a frank, pleasant-looking&#xD;
person, whom Katharine recognized as Mr.&#xD;
French. "I hope you have not found it cold,&#xD;
Miss Tresham," he said, as, after fumbling at the&#xD;
handle for some time, he at last wrenched open&#xD;
the dooi~ "They ought to have put the win-&#xD;
dows up to protect you better. Let me bid you&#xD;
welcome to Anneidale. I hope you will have a&#xD;
merry Christmas with us. Did you ever spend&#xD;
Christmas in the country before?"&#xD;
His voice and his smile were both very genial.&#xD;
Katharine felt glad that her first welcome had&#xD;
been from him, instead of from her formal host-&#xD;
ess. It seemed somehow to promise better, to be&#xD;
a better omen of that merry Christmas which&#xD;
everybody just then was wishing everybody else.&#xD;
She answered him, as they went up the steps to-&#xD;
gether, and, when they entered the door, the first&#xD;
thing that met her eye was the greeting-&#xD;
MERRY CHRISTMAS!&#xD;
in enormous letters of evergreen fronting the en.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
trance, and running along the gallery that was&#xD;
part of the noble winding staircase which swept&#xD;
around the large octagon hail. On every side of&#xD;
this hail swung heavy garlands in which the deep&#xD;
glossy green of a dozen different perennials con-&#xD;
trasted with the crimson berries of the holly and&#xD;
the glistening pearls of the mistletoe. Every&#xD;
picture gazed from a frame elaborately decked;&#xD;
and the large chandelier that swung in mid-space&#xD;
looked like a massive hanging basket, with its&#xD;
many wreaths and long drooping sprays of ivy&#xD;
"How beautiful 1" said Katharine, standing&#xD;
still to admire. "How very beautiful 1"&#xD;
"Yes, it's pretty," said Mr. French, smiling.&#xD;
"But wait until you see the drawing-rooms. The&#xD;
hail was rather slighted this year, and-Ah,&#xD;
here's Mrs. Anucaley.",&#xD;
He broke off thus, as a door on one side&#xD;
opened, and two ladies came out. One was a&#xD;
young and tolerably pretty girl, who ran forward&#xD;
and button-holed Mr. French without ceremony,&#xD;
while Mrs. Annesley welcomed Katharine with&#xD;
more cordiality than the latter had expected.&#xD;
"Have you seen Spitfire? Oh, Mr. French,&#xD;
do tell n~o if you have seen Spitfire?" cried the&#xD;
first, in a tone of deep distress.&#xD;
"My dear Miss Tresham, I am very glad to&#xD;
welcome you to Anneadale," said Mrs. Annesley,&#xD;
with pleasant courtesy.&#xD;
"I am sure that some of your horrid hounds&#xD;
have got hold of him!" cried the anxious in-&#xD;
quirer.&#xD;
"I am afraid you were detained, and must&#xD;
have found it cold,~' said Mrs. Annesley&#xD;
Katharine was rather confused between the&#xD;
two; but she managed to leave the Spitfire re-&#xD;
plies to Mr. French, and assure Mrs. Annesley&#xD;
that she had not been detained, that she was not&#xD;
cold, and, that she hoped she had arrived in time&#xD;
for dinner-it having been understood that she&#xD;
should dine at Annesdale on Christmas Eve.&#xD;
" In very good time," answered Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
Icy. ~' It has not been ten minutes since the&#xD;
ladies went np-stairs to dress. These holiday&#xD;
tiniest the servants are entirely upset," she added,&#xD;
"and, with all my efforts, I cannot get dinner be-&#xD;
fore five o'clock. It is not so much fashion as&#xD;
necessity which decides my hours. Will you go&#xD;
to your room now ?-Maggie, I suppose you will&#xD;
come when you find your dog?"&#xD;
"I am just going with Mr. French to look for&#xD;
him," answered the young lady, to whom this&#xD;
last question had been addressed. "I don't trust&#xD;
a word these miserable servants say, Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
icy. They all have a spite against Spitfire, and I&#xD;
&#xD;
believe they would be glad to see those hateful&#xD;
hounds worry him to death. I'll be up-stairs&#xD;
when I find him, but not l~fore."&#xD;
She walked out of the front door, followed by&#xD;
Mr. French, while Mrs. Annesley drew Katharine&#xD;
toward the staircase. "This way, my dear," she&#xD;
said, quietly. "That is Miss Lester," she went&#xD;
on, as they mounted the steps together. "She is&#xD;
a nice girl, but rather spoiled, and quite eccen-&#xD;
tric. We can hardly wonder, though, for she is a&#xD;
great heiress, and an only child, se-here-this&#xD;
is your room."&#xD;
It was a charging apartment, large and airy,&#xD;
with deep, broad windows looking to the south,&#xD;
two canopied and curtained beds, and richly-&#xD;
carved rosewood furniture. A bright fire was&#xD;
burning on the hearth, the toilet-table was glit-&#xD;
tering with crystal essence-bottles and the like,&#xD;
while two maids stood before it, one engaged in&#xD;
holding and the other in plaiting a long braid of&#xD;
rich, red hair. "This is Miss Tresham, Becky,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Annesley, addressing the former, who&#xD;
at once dropped a deep courtesy. "Is every&#xD;
thing in order?"&#xD;
"Yes'm," said Becky, staring with all her&#xD;
might at the new-coiner.&#xD;
"Then, Miss Tresham, I trust you will be&#xD;
comfortable, and I will leave you to your toilet.&#xD;
I hope, by-the-way, you don't object to sharing&#xD;
your room. The house is so crowded, that I am&#xD;
obliged to quarter Miss Lester and yourself to.&#xD;
gather, as you perceive. You don't mind it? I&#xD;
am so glad; for many persons do, and in that&#xD;
case a hostess is rather embarrassed. Dinner&#xD;
at five.-Becky, be sure you attend to Miss&#xD;
Tresham well."&#xD;
"Won't you take a seat, ma'am ?" said&#xD;
Becky, wheeling a chair to the fire, after her&#xD;
mistress had left the room. And, as Katharine&#xD;
took the seat, she knelt down on the hearth-rug&#xD;
and began unlacing her shoes.&#xD;
"Never mind that," said Miss Tresham, smil-&#xD;
ing. "Don't let me take you from your work."&#xD;
"Mistiss told me I was to wait on you," said&#xD;
Becky, looking up from the shoes. "That's my&#xD;
business, ma'~im, as long as you stays here."&#xD;
"Indeed! I hope we shall get on well to-&#xD;
gether, then. And does that girl wait on Miss&#xD;
Lester?"&#xD;
"I belongs to Miss Lester," said the girl in-&#xD;
dicated. "I'se waited on her all my life.-&#xD;
Becky, where'd you put the curling-tongs?"&#xD;
"You'll find 'em behind the looking-glass,"&#xD;
said Beeky.-Then she glanced up at Katl*$ue&#xD;
and added, with a negro's honest admMQ~&#xD;
&#xD;
"You're the prettiest lady I've seen yet,&#xD;
ma'am."&#xD;
"Hush 1" said the pretty lady, laughing.&#xD;
"You must not flatter me, or we shall not get&#xD;
on at all. If you want to begin your duties, you&#xD;
may take these keys and open my trunk. I must&#xD;
dress as soon as I get warm."&#xD;
Before the process of getting warm was fin-&#xD;
ished, or the process of dressing had begun, the&#xD;
door opened, and the young lady whom Katha-&#xD;
rine had seen below catered the room, followed&#xD;
by a shaggy little Scotch terrier, who inconti-&#xD;
nently rushed at Miss Tresham, with a vicious&#xD;
snarl.&#xD;
"Spitfire, Spitfire 1-behave yourself~ sir ~"&#xD;
cried his mistress, with a stamp. of the foot, which&#xD;
Spitfire minded about as much as if she had bade&#xD;
him go on. "Don't be afraid of him," she said&#xD;
to Katharine, as Spitfire danced round and&#xD;
round, barking vehemently. "He is the best&#xD;
fellow you ever saw, and he wouldn't bite you&#xD;
for the world."&#xD;
"I don't trust him, ma'am 1" cried Becky,&#xD;
who had retreated into a corner and was valiant-&#xD;
ly defending herself with Katharine's shoes,&#xD;
while Spitfire, who had deserted Miss Tresham,&#xD;
devoted his energies entirely to her. " Oh,&#xD;
ma'am, please call him away! Oh, Lord, he's&#xD;
sure to bite me 1-Get off; sir 1-get off!"&#xD;
"Hush, you silly thing!" cried Miss Lester,&#xD;
with another stamp of her foot, which Becky&#xD;
obeyed better than Spitfire had done. "Come&#xD;
here to me, pet-come hcre.-Cynthy, catch him&#xD;
and make him stop."&#xD;
Cynthy put down the curling-tongs and made&#xD;
a lunge at Spitfire, who rewarded her exertions&#xD;
by turning his snapping and snarling against&#xD;
her. Katharine fully expected to see the maid&#xD;
badly bitten; but it seemed that Spitfire's fury&#xD;
was, after all, mere sound. lie submitted to be&#xD;
captured, and, with a last futile bark at Becky,&#xD;
lay dowli on the hearth-rug and growled to him-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
"There, now 1-are you not ashamed of your-&#xD;
self?" said his mistress, addressing him in an&#xD;
expostulating tone.-" Don't you ever be foolish&#xD;
enough to threaten him with any thing again,"&#xD;
added she, turning severely to Becky. "If you&#xD;
do, he certainly will bite you; for nothing makes&#xD;
him so angry as to be threatened.-Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am, since we are to be room-mates, we might as&#xD;
well make friends. What do you think of Spit-&#xD;
fire?"&#xD;
"I think he is very well named," said Kath-&#xD;
arine, who had shared the panic.&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
"Cousin Tom named him," said the young&#xD;
lady. "lie thought it was an appropriate name,&#xD;
and I kept it because it was unusual. In fact,&#xD;
Spitfire is a very unusual dog."&#xD;
In ill-nature, do you mean?"&#xD;
"No, in sense. Look how intelligent his eyes&#xD;
are-I really believe he could talk if he chose.&#xD;
Then 1 like him all the better for his temper-it&#xD;
is such a contrast to those insipid poodles that&#xD;
most girls fancy. I have a bull-dog at home-&#xD;
a great, splendid fellow, named Bulger-but papa&#xD;
would not let me bring him abner"&#xD;
Katharine mentally applauded "papa's~~ wis-&#xD;
dom as she looked at Spitfire triumphantly estab-&#xD;
lished on the hearth-rug, and thought that it&#xD;
might have been her unlucky chance to have&#xD;
been also domiciled with a great, splendid fellow&#xD;
of a bull-dog. She soon found that her new ac-&#xD;
quaintance was very pleasant and very easy to&#xD;
get on wfth-a little spoiled, perhaps, as Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley had said, and decidedly a little eccen-&#xD;
tric, but exceedingly unaffected and good-natured.&#xD;
Contrasting her with many common specimens&#xD;
of the genus young lady, Katharine concluded&#xD;
that she was fortunate in her companion; and&#xD;
she listened with amusement while Miss Lester's&#xD;
tongue ran glibly on, now to the maid, now to&#xD;
herself~&#xD;
"Get out my purple silk, Cynthy, and the&#xD;
ribbons to match. Did you quill the point lace&#xD;
in the neck, as I told you? A pair of satin&#xD;
boots, while ycu are in the trunk.-Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am, did you ever spend Christmas at Annesdalo&#xD;
before? No? Then I am sure you will be de-&#xD;
lighted-every thing is so charming. For my&#xD;
part, I am always glad to get away from home&#xD;
at Christmas. The servants have holiday, you&#xD;
know; and there is so much trouble about get-&#xD;
ting any thing done. They spend their whole&#xD;
tlme dancing in the cabins; and if you want the&#xD;
fire made up, even, you have to ring half a dozen&#xD;
times before anybody comes. I always go away&#xD;
from home Christmas; and, if I can, I always&#xD;
come to Anneadale. Adela and I went to school&#xD;
together. Don't you like her very much?"&#xD;
She stopped after this question, and Katharine&#xD;
replied that she had not the pleasure of knowing&#xD;
Mrs. French, at which Miss Lester's face cx.&#xD;
pressed the liveliest surprise.&#xD;
"Why, I thought she stayed in Lagrange a&#xD;
great deal. I don't live in Lagrange, you see. I&#xD;
live in Apalatka. But you know Morton, don't&#xD;
you ?-and oh, isn't he nice?"&#xD;
"I know Mr. Annesley, and I think him very&#xD;
pleasant."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"He's delightful, that's what he is" said&#xD;
Miss, Lester, a little indignantly~ "Cousin Tom&#xD;
Langdon, and Godfrey Seymour, and Frank&#xD;
French, and a dozen more, are 'pleasant,' but&#xD;
Morton is simply delightful. I could fall in love&#xD;
with him," said the young lady, with startling&#xD;
candor.&#xD;
"Then, why don't you?" s~sked Katharine,&#xD;
who began to think that her new acquaintance&#xD;
was more eccentric than she had at first sup-&#xD;
posed.&#xD;
"Because there would be no use in it," an-&#xD;
swered the other, with a sigh of frank regret.&#xD;
"Everybody has settled that he's to marry&#xD;
Irene Vernon, and no doubt he will, after a&#xD;
while. She's pretty enough, as far as that goes;&#xD;
but, dear me, looks are not every thing-are they,&#xD;
Spitfire ?-Cynthy, come here ~nd take down my&#xD;
hair. I positively won't be dressed for dinner at&#xD;
this rate."&#xD;
With the efficient aid of Becky, Katharine's&#xD;
toilet was soon completed, and, when the~ lest&#xD;
touches were given, fully deserved the enthu-&#xD;
siastic compliments of the maid. "You looks&#xD;
as pretty as a picture, ma'am," said Becky,&#xD;
smoothing down the dress of some soft, blue&#xD;
fabric, that was cut in a style which really made&#xD;
the girl resemble an old picture.&#xD;
"If you only had your hair rolled up and&#xD;
powdered, you'd look for all the world like my&#xD;
great grandmother!" cried Miss Lester, turning&#xD;
round and much inconveniencing Cynthy, who&#xD;
was busy fastening the body of the purple silk.&#xD;
"Is that the first dinner-bell? Good gracious,&#xD;
Cynthy, make haste !-t[erc, Beeky, come and&#xD;
help her.-Miss Tresham, would you mind look-&#xD;
ing in the tray of that trunk and handing me my&#xD;
jewelry-box?"&#xD;
In the midst of the commotion which ensued,&#xD;
a knock at the door passed quite unnoticed, and,&#xD;
after one or two vain repetitions, they all started&#xD;
when it opened and Mrs. French appeared.&#xD;
"Oh, Adela, you are just in time!" cried&#xD;
Miss Lester, lifting up her hands. "I'm only&#xD;
half dressed, an~ hurried almost to death. Do,&#xD;
there's a dear! come and help Miss Tresham put&#xD;
these ornaments in my hair."&#xD;
"Indeed, I have not time, Maggie," said A de.&#xD;
Ia, very coolly. "On the contrary, I have come&#xD;
to earry off Miss Tresham. I knew that of&#xD;
course you would not be ready, so I thought I&#xD;
w9uld pilot her down-stairs.-I am Mrs. French.&#xD;
You'll let me introduce myself~, won't you?"&#xD;
she said, turning and offering her hand to Katha-&#xD;
zine,&#xD;
&#xD;
This was very pleasant and in five minutes&#xD;
Miss Lester was left to the tender mercies of&#xD;
Cynthy and Becky, and Katharine was going&#xD;
down-stairs in amicable companionship with&#xD;
Mrs. French. She had time now to see the&#xD;
grand scale on which Annesdale was built; to&#xD;
admire the hall paved in black and white marble,&#xD;
and the staircase that swept round and round&#xD;
until it ended in an observatory on the roof.&#xD;
"It is very handsome," the governess thought to&#xD;
herself; but she was of the Old World, and had&#xD;
seen too many noble residences to be impressed&#xD;
by the splendors of Annesdale. "On the whole,&#xD;
I think I like Morton House better. It is not so&#xD;
new."&#xD;
"Our party is not very large," Mrs. French&#xD;
was saying. "Not more than thirty people in&#xD;
all, and more gentlemen than ladies. I always&#xD;
like for them to be in the majority. This way,&#xD;
Miss ~resham.-.this is the drawing-room."&#xD;
She opened the door, Katharine entered, and&#xD;
for a minute was quite dazzled. It had been a&#xD;
long time since she had mingled in society, and&#xD;
even under ordinary circumstances this large,&#xD;
richly-hued room, all ablaze with wax-lights and&#xD;
full of well-dressed people, would have made a&#xD;
startling contrast to the gray twilight that filled&#xD;
the hall. Then, no amount of social usage can&#xD;
make it a pleasant ordeal to face a number of&#xD;
absolute strangers just at the time when they&#xD;
have nothing to do and little to talk of, and so&#xD;
are at leisure for criticisms and remarks more&#xD;
agreeable to themselves than to the objec iere-&#xD;
of. Katharine's courage sank down to zero, but&#xD;
nobody would have imagined it. On the con-&#xD;
trary, she looked so stately and self-possessed-&#xD;
so full of that rare, graceful ease which only the&#xD;
highest social culture can give-as she followed&#xD;
Mrs. French across the room, that everybody&#xD;
was immediately afflicted with an inordinate&#xD;
curiosity to learn who she was. All of the&#xD;
Lagrange people knew her by sight; but most&#xD;
of the present company were strangers in La-&#xD;
grange; and a sort of thrill of inquiry ran round&#xD;
the room. "What a splendid-looking woman 1"&#xD;
said the gentlemen. "Dear me, what an elegant&#xD;
girl!" cried the ladies. "Who is she ?" both&#xD;
parties demanded in a breath.&#xD;
When it was known who she was, the inter-&#xD;
est decidedly subsided. A governess who lived&#xD;
in the family of Mr. Marks ~at Tallahoma, was by&#xD;
no means a very important person in Lagrange&#xD;
estimation, and after a short time the only feel-&#xD;
ing that remained was one of curiosity to know&#xD;
why she should have been invited to loin the&#xD;

pie shrugged their shoulders significantly, and&#xD;
said that it would be as well to be civil, since&#xD;
no one could tell how soon Mr. Marks's governess&#xD;
might be transformed into the mistress of An-&#xD;
nesdale, the majority passed the matter over as&#xD;
a whim of their hostess, and thought no more of&#xD;
it.&#xD;
The young host was standing by the fire-&#xD;
place, talking to Mrs. George Raynor, when a&#xD;
gentleman near him said, "Who is that hand-&#xD;
some girl who has just come in with your sister,&#xD;
Aunesley?" And, turning quickly, he saw&#xD;
Katharine. She did not see him, fQr to her&#xD;
eyes the scene was one confused mingling of&#xD;
light, and color, and strange faces. But she had&#xD;
not been sitting down more than a minute when&#xD;
a well-known voice said:&#xD;
"Won't you speak to me, Miss Tresham, and&#xD;
let me tell you how glad I am to see you here~?"&#xD;
She glanced quickly round, and the bright,&#xD;
handsome face she knew so well was looking&#xD;
down at her. With a smile, her hand went out&#xD;
to meet his.&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Annesley," she said. "Of&#xD;
course, I know to whom I am indebted for being&#xD;
here. You must believe that I am very much&#xD;
obliged for the pleasure."&#xD;
" You are mistaken," he answered. "You&#xD;
need not think that I hayc any share in the&#xD;
matter. I need not tell you that I am delighted,&#xD;
that I am happy to see you at Annesdale, but&#xD;
the I1~casurebecame twice a pleasure when my&#xD;
mother asked you, without the slightest knowl-&#xD;
edge, on. my part"&#xD;
Katharine opened her eyes a little; and, if&#xD;
it had been anybody but Annesley who spoke,&#xD;
would certainly have doubted the assertion.&#xD;
But, before she had time to reply, Mrs. French&#xD;
broke in-Mrs. French; whose ears were gQod,&#xD;
and who had no such implicit reliance on Mor-&#xD;
ton's promise as that which her mother had ex-&#xD;
pressed.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, is Morton asking you to help&#xD;
us~ in our Christmas-Eve arrangements? He&#xD;
said he thought perhaps you would."&#xD;
"I said I was sure you would," said Mor-&#xD;
ton. "Adela has arranged some tableaux and&#xD;
music for the edification of our friends; and I&#xD;
felt sure you would aid, if need be."&#xD;
"Morton describes very badly," said Mrs.&#xD;
French. "Some tableaux and music are very in-&#xD;
definite. In the first place, it is no tableaux at&#xD;
&#xD;
79&#xD;
&#xD;
all, but only a little scenic effect; and, in the&#xD;
second place, we have arranged the musical pro-&#xD;
gramme, with the exception of one part. We&#xD;
want a Christmas anthem-solo. Will you sing&#xD;
one for us ?&#xD;
"What sort of an anthem?"&#xD;
"Any that you can orwill sing."&#xD;
"Would the 'Gloria' from Mozart's Twelfth&#xD;
Mass answer?"&#xD;
"It would be charming! Will . you sing&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
"With pleasure-.but-no. I cannot. My&#xD;
music is not here."&#xD;
"I will send for it," said Morton, before his&#xD;
sister could speak. "A messenger shall go in-&#xD;
stantly."&#xD;
He started up, and was about to leave the&#xD;
room, when Katharine called him back. "1&#xD;
must send a message to Mrs. Marks," she said.&#xD;
"She would not kno~r where to find the music&#xD;
else. Please tell the servant to. ask her to&#xD;
look-"&#xD;
''Had you not better come to the library&#xD;
and write a note? It would be much inoje cer-&#xD;
"Don't carry Miss Tresham off, Morton," said&#xD;
his sister. "Dinner will be ready in a&#xD;
"I won't keep her a minute," he answered ;&#xD;
and, without giving Katharine any optioa~in the&#xD;
matter, he drew her hand within h~s arrn,~a~xd led&#xD;
her from the room. The chandelier was li~hted&#xD;
by this time, and the hall looked brillian~inafl&#xD;
its guise of holly and mistletoe. To* Katharine,&#xD;
~it suggested a large mystic temple; end Miss&#xD;
Lester, who was just then descendin~ the stair.&#xD;

rich purple silk and pearl ornaments. She stared&#xD;
a little, but Morton gave her no time to speak;&#xD;
he led his companion hastilyfoi~ward, and opened&#xD;
the library-dior.&#xD;
"You will find pen, ink, and paper, on that&#xD;
table," he said. "I will go to finda niessenger,&#xD;
and be back for your note in a second."&#xD;
Almost in a second he was back, and, closing&#xD;
the door behind him, came and stood by the&#xD;
table, while Katharine da#bed elf a few lines to&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI,&#xD;
sr. CEciLIA.&#xD;
AFTER dinner, Miss Tresham was sitting alone&#xD;
in a corner of the drawing-room. But let no one&#xD;
suppose from this statement that she was feeling&#xD;
snubbed or neglected, and, consequently, misan-&#xD;
thropical or cynical, in even the least degree.&#xD;
She had been taken in to dinner by Mr. Langdon&#xD;
-the "cousin Tom" of whom Miss Lester made&#xD;
frequent mention-and she had found him ex-&#xD;
ceedingly pleasant, while he, for his part, had&#xD;
been decidedly charmed. Nevertheless, after&#xD;
dinner he drifted away; but there were others&#xD;
ready to fill his place, and if, instead of being&#xD;
entertained, Miss Tresham was sitting alone, it&#xD;
was as much a voluntary withdrawal on her part,&#xD;
as any thing else.&#xD;
In fact, the young governess soon found that&#xD;
she was among, but not of, these people, who&#xD;
laughed find talked in Mrs. Annesley's drawing-&#xD;
room. They were all of the best school of breed-&#xD;
ing, and, meeting her on neutral ground, they&#xD;
never dreamed of showing that, under other cir-&#xD;
cumstances, they would *not have considered&#xD;
her an equal. Vulgar incivility, and more vul-&#xD;
gar patronage, were simply impossible to them;&#xD;
and when they accosted her there was no shade&#xD;
of manner to show that it was a condescension&#xD;
on their parts, and an honor on hers. But they&#xD;
had their world, and she had hers. They knew~&#xD;
each other, and each other's friends and affairs,&#xD;
and had a hundred topics in common; while she&#xD;
&#xD;
might have dropped from a cloud, or been trans-&#xD;
r ported from the Sandwich Islandsfor all she&#xD;
knew of these matters. One or two ladies had&#xD;
tried to talk to her, but somehow there was not&#xD;
much to be said on either side. Did she like&#xD;
Lagrange ?-had she lived there long ?-did she&#xD;
riot think Anaesdale a beautiful place ?-were&#xD;
- not the rooms prettily decorated ?-Adela French&#xD;
had exquisite taste, and had cut out all the let-&#xD;
- ters herself. Did Miss Tresham like German&#xD;
* text?&#xD;
After some disjointed efforts of this descrip-&#xD;
tion, it amused Katharine to hear the same per-&#xD;
son turn to a group of her friends and launch&#xD;
into conversation of the most animated kind.&#xD;
She would grow eloquent on Laurie Singleton's&#xD;
* marriage, and who his wife was, and what her&#xD;
grandfather's name had been,~rilrid-~hi what de-&#xD;
gree they were related to the Churehillsiind how&#xD;
Judge Churchill had sent the bride a diamond&#xD;
necklace, and how elegant were the dresses, that&#xD;
hail been ordered direct from Paris. "After all,&#xD;
it is no wonder that these people find it difficult&#xD;
to talk to me," thought Katharine to herself. As&#xD;
is generally the case, she got on better with the&#xD;
gentlemen. Even the ordinary man inhabits a&#xD;
less narrow and conventional world than the ordi-&#xD;
nary woman, his very position as man giving him&#xD;
a wider field of knowledge and a freer scope of&#xD;
thought. Thea, few men are not stirred into&#xD;
conversational effort by a fair face and a pair of&#xD;
bright eyes; and, where two strangers of the&#xD;
same sex would sit and stare at each other, two&#xD;
strangers of different sexes will soon find topics&#xD;
on which to grow sociable. "The governess is&#xD;
really charming," Mr. Langdon had told his,&#xD;
friends; and few of them felt disposed to doubt&#xD;
the assertion. But still, they were engrossed with&#xD;
pretty girls, whom they knew very well, and to&#xD;
whom it was no effort to talk, and the charm-&#xD;
ing governess, by degrees, wandered away into&#xD;
the corner already mentioned.&#xD;
There she sat, like the historic little Jack&#xD;
Homer, with whom we are all acquainted; but&#xD;
lacking the Christmas pie with which that hero&#xD;
solaced his retreat. Instead, she opened a book&#xD;
of engravings, and tried to appear interested in&#xD;
its contents. A ripple of talk was sounding all&#xD;
round her, a pretty dark-eyed girl was singing at&#xD;
the piano, a glorious fire roared on the hearth,&#xD;
the wax-lights burned with that steady lustre&#xD;
which no brilliance of gas will ever rival, the&#xD;
pictures gazed, the mirrors gleamed out of green-&#xD;
wreathed frames; people eame and went eontixiu.&#xD;
ally, and the whole bright scene was, to Katha-&#xD;
&#xD;
rine, like a play-a picture-something scenic&#xD;
and unreal, but yet very attractive. She liked it&#xD;
better than her book, which was full of portraits&#xD;
of dead-and-gone beauties-as if the earth was&#xD;
not as rich in loveliness now as ever, or as if any&#xD;
one in his senses would give one face where life&#xD;
still brightens the eye and colors the tints, for&#xD;
all the cold silent beauty that ever mocked decay&#xD;
on canvas. "There is no one here half as pretty&#xD;
as Miss Vernon,". thought Katharine; and, as&#xD;
she thought it, Miss Vernon crossed the room,&#xD;
and came up to her.&#xD;
"A penny for your thoughts, Miss Tresham,"&#xD;
she said, smiling. "I have been watching you&#xD;
for some time, and I am sure you were thinking&#xD;
how foolish and frivolous we all are."&#xD;
"On the contrary, I was thinking how pretty&#xD;
you all look," answered Katharine, smiling in&#xD;
turn. "Why should 1 think you fQolish or friv-&#xD;
olous? lt is only people of very superior wis-&#xD;
dom who can afford to do that sort of thing, and,&#xD;
for my part, 1 must confess I always rather&#xD;
doubt their sincerity. You may be sure Dioge-&#xD;
nes would never have been able to make a suc-&#xD;
cess in society, or else he would not have taken&#xD;
up his residence in a tub, or gone about with a&#xD;
lantern searching for what he could easily have&#xD;
found by God's own day-light."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear you say so, for indeed I&#xD;
think there is more good in the world-even in&#xD;
the fashionable world-than cynics give it credit&#xD;
for. We look too much at codes, and not enough&#xD;
at individuals-that is all."&#xD;
"And we are too prone to judge hastily fi'om&#xD;
the outside, to decide from mere appearances,"&#xD;
said Katharine, making a personal application&#xD;
of her truism, and thinking how little she had&#xD;
expected to find this young beauty so full of the&#xD;
frank, sweet grace of true womanhood.&#xD;
"Adela tells me that you are going to sing a&#xD;
Christmas anthem for us," said Miss Vernon,&#xD;
changing the subject. "1 am so glad, for I want&#xD;
to hear your voice."&#xD;
"I am afraid you will not hear very much."&#xD;
"Will I not? Then Mr. Annesley has cer-&#xD;
tainly lost all sense of truth. If you will excuse&#xD;
mc, however, I will take the evidence of his&#xD;
word until I have that of my own ear. When&#xD;
will your music come?"&#xD;
"Mr. Annesley sent for it before dinner, and&#xD;
it ought to be here now."&#xD;
"Surely yes-since it is eight o'clock. But,&#xD;
na doubt, the messenger went on into town, and&#xD;
guns, and fire-crackers, and every description of&#xD;
noise, reign there to-night. No creature is so&#xD;
&#xD;
young or so old, so careless or so indhl'erent, as&#xD;
not to remember and rejoice that this is Christ-&#xD;
mas Eve."&#xD;
"I know what it was last year," said Katha-&#xD;
rine, with a slight shrug. "I never saw people&#xD;
throw themselves with such abendoa into rejol-&#xD;
cing. I like to see it; yet I cannot help won-&#xD;
dering how many have any remembrance of the&#xD;
cause which draws it forth."&#xD;
"If you mean devout remembrance-thought&#xD;
of Who came to-night, and why He came-I am&#xD;
afraid there are but few. But still, at least they&#xD;
do not forget Him, and is it not better that Christ-&#xD;
mas should be celebrated thus, than passed over&#xD;
in cold silence?"&#xD;
"Oh, a thousand times better! Don't mis-&#xD;
take me enough to suppose that I think other-&#xD;
wise. But I wish the two could be united."&#xD;
"Yes) so do I," said Miss Vernon, slightly&#xD;
sighing.&#xD;
It was just at this moment that a servant en-&#xD;
tered the room with a large parcel, which he took&#xD;
to Mrs. French. She was talking eagerly, and&#xD;
opened it without thinking-whereupon a music-&#xD;
portfolio tumbled out.&#xD;
"Oh, it is Miss Tresham's music!" cried&#xD;
she; and, while the gentlemen picked up the&#xD;
scattered sheets that strewed the carpet, she&#xD;
carried the half-emptied portfolio over to its&#xD;
owner.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, your music is come," she&#xD;
said, with a smile. "And you must really ex-&#xD;
cuse me for opening it. I was not thinking,&#xD;
and Guy handed it to me without saying a&#xD;
word. Here is a note-I have not opened tkat,&#xD;
too. Do look and see if the 'Gloria' is all&#xD;
right''&#xD;
While Katharine was looking for the "Glo-&#xD;
ria," and failing to find it, Mr. Langdon came up&#xD;
with several pieces of music in his hand, from&#xD;
one of which he was humming a few liars.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, do you sing this?" he cried.&#xD;
"It is a lovely thing, and I have never found&#xD;
any young lady who l~new it. 1 heard Malibran&#xD;
sing it wheui I was in Europe. Won't you sing&#xD;
it for me ~&#xD;
"Not if you heard Malibran sing it last,&#xD;
Mr. Langdon.-Mrs. French, the 'Gloria' is not&#xD;
here. It must-"&#xD;
"Here is some more music, Mrs. French,"&#xD;
said a gentleman, coming up.&#xD;
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Talvott.-Miss Tresham,&#xD;
here is the 'Gloria' now. Miss Tresham, Mr.&#xD;
Talcott I introduce this gentleman partly be-&#xD;
cause he is worth knowing, and partly because I&#xD;

&#xD;
"Certainly, Miss Maggie," said Morton, laugh-&#xD;
ing. Then to the servant: "Tell them they may&#xD;
come in, Victor."&#xD;
Victor said "Yes, sir," and, apparently much&#xD;
gratified, retired with his grinning associate.&#xD;
After a short interval, which the company in&#xD;
the drawing-room devoted to the egg-nog, there&#xD;
was a shuffling of many feet outside the door, a&#xD;
subdued tittering, a touch or two of the strings&#xD;
of a banjo, then a chorus of voices broke into&#xD;
the wild refrain of some negro.ditty, and, when&#xD;
the door was thrown open, the redoubtable Kris-&#xD;
Kingles-the mingled terror and fascination of&#xD;
every Southern child-appeared drawn up in the&#xD;
hail.&#xD;
To Katharine alone it was a novel sight, the&#xD;
fantastically-dressed and masked group in the&#xD;
foreground, and the dusky faces, beaming with&#xD;
pride and delight, that made a semicircle round&#xD;
the wall, and peered in at the open door.&#xD;
"What are they for? what do they do?" she&#xD;
asked of Miss Lester, who chanced to be stand-&#xD;
ing by her.&#xD;
"Oh, don't you know about Kris.Kingles 2"&#xD;
cried that young lady, with surprise. "Why, on&#xD;
Christmas Eve some of the negroes always dress&#xD;
up in this way, and go round to all the cabins,&#xD;
and sometimes scare the others nearly to death.&#xD;
t can remember when I was a child I used to be&#xD;
awfully afraid of them. When they come in the&#xD;
house this way, it is 'for Christmas-gifts. I wish&#xD;
they could dance for you-you would like to see&#xD;
that.-Mr. Annesley, would it hurt the floor very&#xD;
much if they danced one dance for us? Miss&#xD;
Tresham never saw any Kris-Kingles before."&#xD;
"It would not hurt it at all," said Morton.&#xD;
"Boys, give us a dance before you go."&#xD;
The "Kris-Kiagles" were not at all bashful,&#xD;
and needed no second invitation. In a minute,&#xD;
the measure of the music changed, and, still ac-&#xD;
companyilig it with their voices, they broke into&#xD;
a wild, uncouth dance, impossible to imagine,&#xD;
and equally impossible to describe.&#xD;
"I don't wonder children are afraid of them,"&#xD;
thought Katharine, as she watched the hideous&#xD;
pasteboard masks bending backward and for-&#xD;
ward, the agile feet that kept such well-marked&#xD;
time, and the fantastic figures threading in and&#xD;
out of what seemed inextricable mazes. Some&#xD;
of the steps were most remarkable, and various&#xD;
double.shuffles and pigeon-wings elicited the&#xD;
liveliest applause from tha audience. But the&#xD;
performance was soon~ over.&#xD;
"Dat's 'nuff, boys," said the leader, coming&#xD;
to a pause. "Don't let the white folks git tired&#xD;
&#xD;
of you. Make your bes' bow now, and tell de&#xD;
ladies and gentlemen you wishes 'em a merry&#xD;
Christmas and a happy New-Year."&#xD;
"Merry Christmas and happy New-Year to&#xD;
you all!" echoed the ladies and gentlemen afore-&#xD;
said; and most-of them went out into the hall&#xD;
to bestow that Christmas-gift which the Kris-&#xD;
Kingles had delicately refrained from asking.&#xD;
After this, the gay pageant filed out, and went&#xD;
its way over the hill to the quarters, the united&#xD;
voices swelling into fuller song as they receded,&#xD;
and waking all the echoes of the silent night.&#xD;
"It is eleven o'clock," said Mrs. French, as&#xD;
she went back into the drawing-room, where Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley and a few elderly ladies had the fire all&#xD;
to themselves. "It is time to arrange ourtableaux,&#xD;
as Morton calls them-Irene, Maggie, Flora-all&#xD;
of you-come 1"&#xD;
Most of the young ladies rose at this sum-&#xD;
mons, and left the room. The gentlemen fell&#xD;
into knots, and talked principally to each other,&#xD;
during thc half.hour which followed. Moi~ton&#xD;
snatched a few minutes with Katharine; but his&#xD;
mother soon managed to call him away. At the&#xD;
end of the half-hour, a messenger came from&#xD;
Mrs. French for Miss Tresham. At a quarter to*&#xD;
twelve, a servant entered, and put out all the&#xD;
lights. The hush of the next fifteen minutes was&#xD;
very impressive. Such an idea had never entered&#xD;
Adela French's head; but to more than one pros..&#xD;
ent unconsciously solemn thoughts came, and&#xD;
this darkness seemed to typify the shadow which&#xD;
rested over the world before the blessed light of&#xD;
Christmas dawned. In the midst of profound&#xD;
~silence, the clocks began to strike twelve. At&#xD;
the first stroke, the folding-doors which divided&#xD;
the two drawing-rooms, and which had been&#xD;
rigidly closed all evening, moved noiselessly&#xD;
apart; into the darkness flashed a dazzling&#xD;
flood of light, a scene so brilliant that it almost&#xD;
blinded the vision, and a chorus of~silvery voices,&#xD;
breaking into the "glad tidings of great joy."&#xD;
Not being very well used to scenic effects, the&#xD;
spectators held their breath In astonished adini-&#xD;
ration. The room into which they gazed was&#xD;
wreathed with garlands, and blazing with lights&#xD;
until it lost its semblance of a room, and looked&#xD;
rather like some enchanted palace. At the far-&#xD;
ther end, an arch of green was thrown, and&#xD;
above, in illuminated letters, ran the insorip.~&#xD;
tion, "Unto you is born this day a Saviour.'~&#xD;
Under the centre of this arch stood the Christ..&#xD;
mas-trec, glittering from the lowest limb tG the&#xD;
highest summit with countless tapers and colored&#xD;
lights. Behind was a stage, arranged in careful&#xD;
&#xD;

perspective. Gazing from the darkened toom,&#xD;
the full glory of the abounding radiance seemed&#xD;
to centre here, giving an effect beyond descrip.&#xD;
tion to the figures upon it. In the foreground&#xD;
was an Oriental group-the Judean shepherds,&#xD;
as they watched their flocks-while beyond and&#xD;
around were slender forms clad in pure white,&#xD;
whose voices rose in one united chorus as they&#xD;
sang an anthem exultant enough to tell the&#xD;
world Who had entered it on that December&#xD;
night.&#xD;
As the chorus died away, the tones of a cabi-&#xD;
net-organ fell on the ear, and in the midst of a&#xD;
hush, so deep that it could almost be felt, one&#xD;
pure, liquid voice rose and soared aloft in the&#xD;
sublime "Gloria" of Mozart. In all the great&#xD;
world of tones, there is hardly a strain which,&#xD;
* for triumphant majesty and noble worship, can&#xD;
equal this. There is scarcely more than an alloy&#xD;
of earth and earth's supplication in it. We for-&#xD;
get that we are still "poor banished children of&#xD;
Eve," that we are yet "weeping and mourning in&#xD;
this valley of tears;" we catch the spirit of the&#xD;
angelic hosts, and our hearts are borne upward&#xD;
by the tones in which the master's genius and&#xD;
devotion live forever. "Gloria in excelsis Deo!"&#xD;
sang the ineffable sweetness of that silver voice,&#xD;
and few were so cold or so careless as not to&#xD;
echo the cry. In the breathless silence, every&#xD;
word of the grand old Latin was audible, and&#xD;
every word stirred those listening hearts. How&#xD;
full of glorious triumph rang the voice in the&#xD;
"Domine Deus! Agnus Dci! Films Patris!"&#xD;
Flow it seemed smote with a sudden remem-&#xD;
~rance of humanity, a sudden yearning sense of&#xD;
need in the "Qui tollis peceata mundi! misc-&#xD;
rere nobis 1" FLow grandly it rose again to&#xD;
the very gates of heaven in the "Quoniam tu&#xD;
solus Sanetus!" and, after one great burst of&#xD;
inspired praise, sunk at last into silence.&#xD;
When the solo ended, people remembered&#xD;
where they were, and, turning, stared at each&#xD;
other. Who was it? What voice had carried&#xD;
them so far out of themselves, and out of the&#xD;
world in which they lived-the smooth, conven-&#xD;
tional, easy world, in which Christmas was only&#xD;
a pleasant occasion of friendly meeting and con-&#xD;
vivial sport? All these lights and wreaths, this&#xD;
ta&amp;amp;eazc arrangement, and chorus of pretty girls,&#xD;
were a very agreeable entertainment to the eye;&#xD;
but here - here was something which seized&#xD;
them unawares, and, wrenching them cut of&#xD;
their ordinary life, made theni realize what it&#xD;
was they had met to celebrate, forcing upon&#xD;
them thoughts which to the common worldly&#xD;
&#xD;
B'T HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
mind are any thing but agreeable. It was the&#xD;
greatest proof of Katharine's triumph that her&#xD;
* earnestness~ had so far communicated itself to&#xD;
* them that they thought of her and her voice&#xD;
only as a secondary consideration.&#xD;
"How beautiful!" they cried, when it was&#xD;
over; but they waited until it was over to do so.&#xD;
There was no time to say much, for the chorus&#xD;
broke into the noble strains of Milton's "Hymn&#xD;
on the Nativity," and the last verse was still&#xD;
echoing when the folding-doors closed on the&#xD;
scene.&#xD;
The company found that, while they were en-&#xD;
grossed, servants had entered and relighted the&#xD;
candles; so the drawing-room looked quite like&#xD;
itself when they turned round-only very, very&#xD;
commonplace, after that glowing world of sight&#xD;
and sound. Mrs. Anneslcy was imin~liately&#xD;
overwhelmed with congratulations, and soon, to&#xD;
her great annoyance, beset with inquiries con-&#xD;
cerning the singer of the "Gloria." Gopd Heav-&#xD;
ens! what a beautiful voice! Was it r~tally that&#xD;
girl who is said to be a governess in Tallahoma?&#xD;
Where could she possibly have learned to sing&#xD;
so divinely?&#xD;
"For all we know, she may have been an&#xD;
opera-singer before she came to Lagrange," said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley, striving hard to conceal her vexa-&#xD;
tion, and to speak in a careless tone. "Adela&#xD;
was very anxious to secure her voice, which is,&#xD;
as you say, really beautiful; so I asked her here.&#xD;
But I should not like for any one to think that&#xD;
she is a friend of ours."&#xD;
"By George! who would have thought the&#xD;
pretty governess could sing like that?" said Mr.&#xD;
Langdon to Morton Annesley&#xD;
To which Morton replied, stiffly enough, that&#xD;
he always knew Miss Tresham had an exquisite&#xD;
voice, for he had often heard her sing.&#xD;
"It did not astonish me at all, ~ he said.&#xD;
"The pretty governess!" he repeated to him-&#xD;
self; as he walked off. "And that is the way&#xD;
they talk of her 1 I wonder how I shall ever&#xD;
contrive to iiold my tongue during this week&#xD;
which is to come?"&#xD;
When the folding - doors were once more&#xD;
opened, and the company were bidden to ad-&#xD;
mire and inspect the Christmas-tree, which was&#xD;
loaded with gifts, Annesley went up to Katha-&#xD;
rine and held out his hand, without in the least&#xD;
regarding the people standing near.&#xD;
"Let mc thank you for a pleasure which I&#xD;
shall always remember," lie said. "You have&#xD;
given me my best Christmas~gift. I shall never&#xD;
again think of St. Ceiling without thinking of&#xD;
&#xD;
THE APPLE OF DISCORD.&#xD;
&#xD;
~joss. Don't Catholics always have a patron-&#xD;
saint? She ought to be yours."&#xD;
It was verging close upon two o'clock when&#xD;
the party finally separated, and Katharine went&#xD;
up to her chamber. On opening the door, she&#xD;
found that Miss Lester had preceded her, and&#xD;
was sitting on the hearth-rug, engaged in petting&#xD;
and soothing Spitfire.&#xD;
"Cynthy left him up here by himself all the&#xD;
evening," said the young lady, indignantly, when&#xD;
Miss Tresham appeared. "I can't imagine what&#xD;
she meant by it. Of course, she knew that she&#xD;
ought to have brought him down to the drawing-&#xD;
room to me. The poor fellow can't bear to be&#xD;
left alone. Miss Tresham, wasn't it all charm-&#xD;
ing? There's no place like Annesdale, I think.&#xD;
The Christmas-tree was beautiful, and all the&#xD;
presents ~so elegant! Oh, dear! "-with a tre-&#xD;
mendous yawn-" I am terribly sleepy. I am&#xD;
sure I shall not get up till dinner to-morrow."&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIL&#xD;
TIlE APPLE OF DIscoaD.&#xD;
Miss LESTER fulfilled her own prophecy, and&#xD;
remained in bed the better. part of the next&#xD;
morning; but Katharine rose at a reasonable&#xD;
hour, and went below. As she paused at the&#xD;
foot of the stairs, debating in her own mind&#xD;
which one of the numerous doors around was&#xD;
likely to lead into the breakfast-room, a step&#xD;
sounded behind her, and a pleasant voice said:&#xD;
"Good-morning, Miss Treshain. Merry Christ-&#xD;
mastoyou!"&#xD;
"Good-morning, Miss Vernon," answered&#xD;
Katharine, turning to face the speaker, who&#xD;
had come down the staircase in her rear, and&#xD;
- was close at hand. "Merry Christmas to ~jou I&#xD;
Is it not a beautiful day?"&#xD;
"Delightful I" said Miss Vernon. "Let us&#xD;
go to the front door, and look at it."&#xD;
To the front door they went, accordingly, and&#xD;
met the full brilliance of the sparkling winter&#xD;
morning-the floods of dazzling sunshine,- the&#xD;
refraction of light from the gravel sweep, and&#xD;
the frost-gemmed trees and shrubs that stood&#xD;
out clearly in the transparent atmosphere.&#xD;
"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth&#xD;
peace to men of good will !" sang Miss Vernon,&#xD;
softly, as she stood and looked out, shading her&#xD;
eyes with one hand, while the sunbeams turned&#xD;
her hair to shining gold.&#xD;
"I ~Mk~ your translation better than ours,&#xD;
&#xD;
85&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Tresham; and, oh, I wish you would teach&#xD;
me to sing the Latin as you sang it last night!&#xD;
It seemed to me I never heard a language half so&#xD;
beautifuL You don't pronounce it as our uni-&#xD;
versity men do."&#xD;
"No, indeed, I do not," said Katharine,&#xD;
smiling. "I call their pronunciation barbar-&#xD;
ous, and so does anybody who has ever heard&#xD;
the other. I'll teach you the 'Gloria' with&#xD;
pleasure, Miss Vernon."&#xD;
"Thank you; I shall remember the promise.&#xD;
Do you know that, like Lord Byron, you have&#xD;
waked up this morning and found yourself&#xD;
famous-as far as it is in the power of Annes-&#xD;
dale to bestow fame?"&#xD;
"Not I."&#xD;
"Well, it is true, nevertheless. Everybody&#xD;
is talking about your voice. Here come two of&#xD;
your audience now. Ask them if it is not so."&#xD;
Katharine, whom the sunlight was nearly&#xD;
blinding, looked in the direction indicated, and&#xD;
perceived two gentlemen advancing along a side-&#xD;
path to the house. As they came near her, she&#xD;
saw that one of them was Morton Annesley, and&#xD;
the other a tall, stalwart, sunburnt person, who&#xD;
had been presented to her on the preceding even-&#xD;
ing as Mr. Seymour. Before she could answer&#xD;
her companion, they came up the steps, and, all&#xD;
smiling and slightly purple from the cold, were&#xD;
making their Christmas greetings. They had&#xD;
been to the stable to look at their horses; had&#xD;
found the morning charming, but rather cool;&#xD;
and were on their way back for breakfast-had&#xD;
the ladies been to breakfast?&#xD;
"Not yet," said Miss Vernon. "We will take&#xD;
you in and give you some hot coffee as a reward&#xD;
for your exertions. What can there be so inter-&#xD;
esting in horses, I wonder, that men should go&#xD;
out and stand in the cold for the pleasure of leek.&#xD;
ing at them? Mr. Seymour, I heard those hounds&#xD;
of yours making a terrible noise this morning.&#xD;
When are you going on a fox-hunt?"&#xD;
"To-morrow morning at three o'clock, ac-&#xD;
cording to our present arrangement," said Mr.&#xD;
Seymour, smiling; and to Katharine, standing&#xD;
by, it was evident that this stout Nimrod was&#xD;
like wax in Irene Vernon's dainty hands, and&#xD;
before the glance of her sunny violet eyes.&#xD;
"And may I go too ?-Miss Tresham, did&#xD;
you ever go fox-hunting? It is the most delight-&#xD;
ful thing in the world.-Mr. Seymour, may I go&#xD;
too?"&#xD;
"I am afraid it is impossible, Miss Irene."&#xD;
"But why? Don't I often go, when I'm&#xD;
down in Apalatka?"&#xD;
&#xD;

"Certainly you do. But it is different here.&#xD;
This is a rougher country, and we may have to&#xD;
ride eight or ten miles before we start a fon-at&#xD;
least, A.nnesley says so."&#xD;
"I think there is very little doubt of it,"&#xD;
said Annesley. "Miss Irene, I am afraid there&#xD;
is no hope of your going; but I am sure Sey-&#xD;
mour will bring you the brush of the first fox&#xD;
that dies, and you can hang it at the side of&#xD;
your bridle.-By-the-way," he added, turning&#xD;
suddenly to Miss Tresham, "won't you try&#xD;
Ilderim, now that you are here? I should like&#xD;
it very much, and, if you would like it too, there&#xD;
is no possible reason to be urged against it."&#xD;
"Mr. Annesley, I "-here she broke down,&#xD;
and laughed-" I really think you ought not to&#xD;
tempt me so. If I would like one thing more&#xD;
than another, it would be to ride ilderini."&#xD;
"Then, for Heaven's sake, why do you hesi-&#xD;
tate to do it?"&#xD;
"Don't be profane, and I will tell you .after&#xD;
a while. Now, we must go in to breakfast."&#xD;
They went in, and found the breakfast-room&#xD;
bright and cheery, and full of the sound of chit-&#xD;
tering dishes and pleasant voices, it was on the&#xD;
east side of the house, and the bright sunlight&#xD;
was pouring across it in long lines of level light.&#xD;
Half n dozen round tables took the place of one&#xD;
long, solemn board, and at five, out of the six,&#xD;
sociable groups were drinking their coffee and&#xD;
eating their steak with healthy appetites. The&#xD;
four who came in now took their seats at the&#xD;
unoccupied table, and smiled and nodded in&#xD;
answer to the greetings given from all sides.&#xD;
Miss Veraun, in particular, came in for a large&#xD;
share of these.&#xD;
"Irene, here are some oysters!" cried one&#xD;
young lady. "Do you know they came from&#xD;
Mobile packed in ice, and Mr. French says they&#xD;
were brought specially for you? Take some;&#xD;
they are very good."&#xD;
"You are very good," said Irene, looking at&#xD;
Mr. French. "Is it possible they are fresh?"&#xD;
"Taste them, and see," said Morton, setting&#xD;
a dish before her. "The cold weather stood&#xD;
our friend.-Miss Tresham, do you like oys-&#xD;
ters?"&#xD;
"Who does not like oysters, Mr. Annes-&#xD;
ley?"&#xD;
"A great many people here in the back-&#xD;
woods, I assure you. Ask Mrs. Dargan over&#xD;
there what she thinks of them."&#xD;
"I think they are abominable, and not fit for&#xD;
a Christian to look ~ said Mrs. Dargan, with a&#xD;
shudder. "I would just as soon eat frogs."&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.&#xD;
"There is nothing better than a good fricas-&#xD;
see of frogs," said Mr. Langdon, who prided&#xD;
himself on being cosmopolitan in tastes and&#xD;
ideas. "You are right, too, Mrs~ Dargan -&#xD;
there is something in the flavor not unlike oys-&#xD;
ters."&#xD;
"I said nothing about the flavor!" cried&#xD;
Mrs. Dargan. "Goodness, Mr. Langdon! you&#xD;
don't suppose I ever tasted onc of the things?"&#xD;
"If you went to France, my dear madam-"&#xD;
began Mr. Langdon.&#xD;
"I should be afraid to open my mouth after&#xD;
I got in the country, for fear I might be made to&#xD;
eat some of their dreadful concoctions without&#xD;
knowing it," interrupted the lady.&#xD;
"Then let me advise you not to go to the&#xD;
co~rntry, for a fasting.tour would be any thing&#xD;
but plensant.-Annesley, my good fellow, what&#xD;
is the best way to eat an oyster?"&#xD;
"Each to his taste," answered Annesley, with&#xD;
a smile.&#xD;
"Not by any mean5," said Mr. Langdon.&#xD;
"The best way, in fact, the only civilized way,&#xD;
is-raw. in that case, they only need a little&#xD;
pepper and salt."&#xD;
In this vein the conversation flowed back&#xD;
and forth - trivial,. but very easy and unre-&#xD;
strained, and occasionally sparkling with a&#xD;
touch of humor or pleasantry. Katharine liked&#xD;
it, as she liked soft fabrics, and rich rooms, and&#xD;
delicate perfumes; for, alas I Mr. Warwick was&#xD;
right, and she was by nature cursed with that&#xD;
sensitive appreciation of refinement and the ap.&#xD;
plianees of refinement which makes life in the&#xD;
lower grades of society nothing more nor less&#xD;
than a positive torture. After a while, Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley came over and sat down by her.&#xD;
"I suppose I must not include you, Miss&#xD;
Tresham, in the parties made up for church this&#xD;
morning?" she said, by way of excuse for her&#xD;
advent.&#xD;
"No, I shall not go," answered Katharine,&#xD;
who thought the question quite unnecessary.&#xD;
"Fortunately - should one say fortunately&#xD;
about such a thing ?-gentlemen are not very de-&#xD;
vout," said the lady. "If they were, I hardly&#xD;
know how all these good people would be con-&#xD;
veyed to hear Mr. Norwood preach.--Irene, I be-&#xD;
lieve i heard you promise Morton that he should&#xD;
drive you?"&#xD;
"You heard me promise Mr. Seymour," said&#xD;
irene, who saw Mrs. Annesley's schemes for&#xD;
throwing Morton and herself together, and al-&#xD;
ways quietly managed to defeat them. "He&#xD;
asked me-or, no, I believe i asked him -, but,&#xD;

Morton, laughing. "I shall ask Mrs. Raynor to emnly. "Poor Harry at last had to order him&#xD;

took the vacant seat by Katharine. She was "We know that," said another lady-the&#xD;

by such a ti-ifling evidence of what she already said Mrs. Dargan, sharply. "I read her at once,&#xD;

think the climate would certainly suit me. If&#xD;
George is able to leave home, I shall try it next&#xD;
winter."&#xD;
The other ladies exchanged significant glan.&#xD;
ces. Mrs. Raynor could afford to take a fancy&#xD;
to this girl, for both of Mrs. Raynor's sons were&#xD;
safely tied in the bonds of matrimony, and there-&#xD;
fore not in a position to make fools of them.&#xD;
selves. While,~ as for them-there was hardly&#xD;
one of them who had not some young man,&#xD;
some son, or nephew, or prospective son-in.law,&#xD;
for whose safety of head and heart she was at&#xD;
that moment quaking.&#xD;
Meanwhile, the objects of all this solicitude,&#xD;
the young men aforesaid, were smoking their&#xD;
cigars in and around the front piazza, and, in&#xD;
their free-and-easy fashion, canvassing the gov-&#xD;
erness, who, to them, simply stood on her merits&#xD;
as a woman. It may be as well to state that&#xD;
Morton was absent, for, if he had been present,&#xD;
the conversation would certainly have received a&#xD;
summary cheek.&#xD;
"I believe I will send up and ask Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am to go to church with me," said Mr. Langdon,&#xD;
watching meditatively the elegant equipages&#xD;
which, one after another, swept up before the&#xD;
door. "My horses arc not quite as fine as Sey-&#xD;
mour's, and my buggy isn't half as new as An-&#xD;
nesley's; but, still, I think I'll ask her.-Here,&#xD;
Sam-go up to Miss Tresham's room, and give&#xD;
her my compliments - Mr. Langdon's oomph.&#xD;
ments-and say-."&#xD;
"You may spare yourself that trouble, Tom,"&#xD;
said Talcott, who was. standing near. "Miss&#xD;
Tresham isn't going to church."&#xD;
"Did she tell you so?"&#xD;
"No; I didn't ask her-but she told Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley so. I'd have asked her myself; if it&#xD;
hadn't been for that. But3 then, I remembered&#xD;
-she is a Romanist, you know."&#xD;
"How the deuce should I know?"&#xD;
"You might haveheard her say so-as I did.&#xD;
I asked hey something about that song last night,&#xD;
and she told me she was a Catholic. I suppose&#xD;
that's how she came to know Latin. She must be&#xD;
amazingly clever."&#xD;
"She is certainly amazingly pretty," said Sey.&#xD;
mour, laughing, while Langdon gravely smoked&#xD;
his pipe, and regarded the horses. "My test&#xD;
of beauty is, whether a woman will make any&#xD;
showing by the side of Irene Vernon. I saw&#xD;
them both together this morning, and Miss&#xD;
Treshain not only made a showing, but a very&#xD;
good one. Who is she? Where does she come&#xD;
from, anyhow?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"You know Marks-the man who is cashier&#xD;
of the bank in Tallahoma?" said George Ray.&#xD;
nor. "Well, this girl is a teacher in his family.&#xD;
He picked her up somewhere, and they do say"&#xD;
-here the speaker looked significantly myste-&#xD;
rious-" that one of our friends, not a thousand&#xD;
miles away, is seriously smitten."&#xD;
"Who ?-Talcott?" asked Langdon, looking&#xD;
round.&#xD;
"I smitten!" cried Talcott, reddening up in&#xD;
a minute. "Why, good Heavens! I never&#xD;
thought of such a thing. She's very nice; and&#xD;
I got on very well with her last night-but I&#xD;
don't see how you could say such a thing as&#xD;
that, Ray~or~~&#xD;
"There's something in a guilty conscience,&#xD;
Fred," said Raynor, laughing. "I was not even&#xD;
thinking of you. I was thinking of-well, it&#xD;
don't matter who. She i~ a pretty girl, there's&#xD;
no doubt of that," added he, candidly. "Flora&#xD;
tells me that Irene has taken quite a fancy to&#xD;
her, and that is remarkable, for Irene doesn't&#xD;
often take fancies-especially to women."&#xD;
"She is too nice for a governess," said an.&#xD;
other smoker. "Talcott, you'd better go in for&#xD;
the prize. She wouldn't cost you much trouble,&#xD;
and that's a consideration."&#xD;
"Stop that, Hal," said Seymour, gravely. "I&#xD;
can't bear to hear a woman talked of in such a&#xD;
strain. Governess or no governess, Miss Tresh.&#xD;
am is a lady, and should be treated as one. Now,&#xD;
I would sooner insult her to her face than behind&#xD;
her back."&#xD;
"Who thought about insulting her!" de-&#xD;
manded the other, flushing, and looking offended.&#xD;
"You didn't, I suppose; but it is a badhabit&#xD;
to talk in that way, and, if I were you, I would&#xD;
break myself of it."&#xD;
What the recipient of this frank advice would&#xD;
have replied, was a matter open to conjecture.&#xD;
He frowned, and his answer would probably not&#xD;
have been very amiable, if a group of brightly-&#xD;
dressed girls had not at that moment come down&#xD;
the staircase, and crossed the hail into the piazza.&#xD;
Immediately all the bustle of departure be-&#xD;
gan, and, before long, carriage after carriage&#xD;
rolled out of the open gates, and down the&#xD;
bright, sunlit road. Mrs. Annesley's was the&#xD;
last to leave, and, when her foot was on the&#xD;
step, she turned suddenly to one of the servants&#xD;
standing near.&#xD;
"To-day is mail-day," she said. "Has any-&#xD;
body been to the post-office, Joe?"&#xD;
It was at once evident from Joe's face-a&#xD;
good deal blank, and a little foolish-that such&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
an idea as mail-day or post-office had never&#xD;
entered his Christmas-beset mind. Holding his&#xD;
cap between two fingers, he scratched his head&#xD;
with the others, as he replied: "I don't believe&#xD;
anybody have thought about it, mistiss."&#xD;
" Take a horse and go at once, then, ~ said&#xD;
his mistress. "Don't forget i~ now-for I shall&#xD;
expect to find the mail when I get back."&#xD;
"I sha'n't forget it, ina'amn."&#xD;
And, as Mrs. Annesley drove oil; she had the&#xD;
satisfaction of seeing him take his way to the&#xD;
stable with laudable haste.&#xD;
An hour later Katharine was crossing the&#xD;
hail, when a servant entered with a large and&#xD;
well-filled mail-bag slung acro's his shoulder.&#xD;
"Letters, ma'am?" he said, touching his cap, as&#xD;
if the announcement must necessarily interest&#xD;
the young lady. But she shook her head with&#xD;
a smile. "I am not expecting any thing," she&#xD;
said; and with that was passing on, when,&#xD;
through the open drawing-room door, Miss Les-&#xD;
ter's voice sounded.&#xD;
"Did I hear something a bout letters, Miss&#xD;
Tresham? Oh, yes, there they arc. Would you&#xD;
mind looking over them, and getting mine for&#xD;
me? I know mamma must have written, and&#xD;
I hate to move-Spitfire is comfortable, that&#xD;
I can't bear to disturb him."&#xD;
To prevent Spitfire's being obliged to relin-&#xD;
quish his position on his mistress's dress, Kath-&#xD;
arine made the messenger empty the mail-bag&#xD;
on a table near at hand, and began looking over&#xD;
the different letters. There were some for al. 1&#xD;
most everybody, and she soon found Miss Lea-&#xD;
ter's. As she was turning away with them, she 1&#xD;
noticed that one missive had dropped to the 1&#xD;
floor, where it lay face downward. Stooping to&#xD;
pick it up, she saw that, although it was a large, I&#xD;
heavy letter, the address was to Mrs. Annesley I&#xD;
-and, seeing this, she cOuld not help looking at&#xD;
it a little curiously. There could be no mistake&#xD;
in the character, it was "business" all over,&#xD;
from the seal to the very post-mark, and did a&#xD;
'C&#xD;
not Seem like Christmas," Katharine said to a&#xD;
herself. Such a letter should not be opened a&#xD;
until the great festival was over, she thought; a&#xD;
but still she laid it on top of the pile, and, leav. a&#xD;
lag it with its great broad face upward, went I&#xD;
into the drawing-room to Miss Lester.&#xD;
When the party came back from church, and "&#xD;
filled the house with the gay sound of their&#xD;
voices, Morton chanced to be the first person a&#xD;
to go up to the hall table and examine the mail. &amp;amp;&#xD;
The large, double letter seemed to puzzle him n&#xD;
too. He took it up and looked at it, much as J&#xD;
&#xD;
THE APPLE&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
OF DISCORD                              89&#xD;
Katharine had done, then laid it on one side as&#xD;
if for further examination, and tossed over the&#xD;
others.&#xD;
"Here, Seymour Langdon - Talcott," he&#xD;
cried, "here are letters for nil of you, and for&#xD;
the ladies, too. Where have they all vanished&#xD;
to ?-Miss Irene, don't you want to hear from&#xD;
home? Here are two letters with the Mobile&#xD;
post-mark on then~-Miss Alice, here is one for&#xD;
you.-Yes, Miss Mary, I am sure I saw your&#xD;
name a minute ago."&#xD;
He was soon surrounded by an eager group,&#xD;
for it is surprising how everybody-excepting,&#xD;
perhaps, a jaded business man-is excited by the&#xD;
prospect of letters, how fond everybody is of re-&#xD;
ceiving them, and how shamefully remiss about&#xD;
answering them. Those who had got letters, were&#xD;
sitting on the chairs nearest around, reading&#xD;
them, and those who had not, were standing&#xD;
about, looking very discontented, when Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley entered and walked up to her son, who&#xD;
was opening his own.&#xD;
"Any thing for me, Morton?" she asked,&#xD;
as carelessly as possible.&#xD;
Her son looked up with a start, and held the&#xD;
large missive toward her.&#xD;
"A letter from Burns," he said. "I wonder&#xD;
what he is writing to you about? He ought to&#xD;
know that I don't like you to be troubled with&#xD;
business matters."&#xD;
"I wrote to him, and this is merely a reply,"&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley answered. "It is about my own&#xD;
business, Morton-you need not be afraid that I&#xD;
~.rill meddle in yours," she added, a little bit-&#xD;
terly; and before he could reply, she had taken&#xD;
the letter and passed on upstairs.&#xD;
As soon as she was safely within her own&#xD;
oom, she tore open the sheet of paper that in&#xD;
;h6se days did duty for an envelope, and, with-&#xD;
)ut glancing at the lawyer's letter, drew forth&#xD;
he enclosure which it contained. She spread it&#xD;
n the table before her, but her excitement was&#xD;
0 great that for a moment she could scarcely&#xD;
ec-then a mist seemed suddenly to clear away,&#xD;
nd, though she still trembled with eagerness,&#xD;
he was able to read the lines on which depended&#xD;
o much. The letter was addressed to Mr.&#xD;
inras, by his agent in London, and ran thus:&#xD;
WM. F. BURNS, EsQ.&#xD;
"DEAR SIR: In reply to your favor, I am en-&#xD;
bled to say that I have called on Messrs. Rich&#xD;
Little, and found them quite ready to afford&#xD;
10 any information regarding Mr. Henry St.&#xD;
ohn. He is known to them as the friend and&#xD;

&#xD;
MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
secretary of one of their clients-a wealthy&#xD;
Scotch gentleman; and, although. they have&#xD;
never done business on his own account, they&#xD;
speak highly of him from personal acquaintance.&#xD;
With regard to the lady, however, they were de-&#xD;
cidcdly reticent. When I pressed my inquiries&#xD;
on this score, I was checked very shortly, and&#xD;
reminded that a matter of private business could&#xD;
not be discussed with any but the person or per-&#xD;
sons immediately concerned, and that, if I wished&#xD;
information about Miss Tresham, 1 had better&#xD;
apply to'Mr. St. John. I took the hint, and Mr.&#xD;
St. John's address, and went to Scotland to see&#xD;
him. When I reaQhed the house to which I had&#xD;
been directed, I found it closed and deserted.&#xD;
The servants informed me that both the pro.&#xD;
prietor and his secretary were absent, and, it&#xD;
was supposed, had left the country. Being near&#xD;
Cumberland, I then went to Donthorne Place,&#xD;
and made my inquiries. Here I met with more&#xD;
success. The lady whom I saw answered my&#xD;
questions without any hesitations Miss Tresham&#xD;
had been in her family for a year, and had given&#xD;
entire satisfaction. She had not been discharged,&#xD;
but had resigned the situation of her own free.&#xD;
will, and against the wishes of her employers.&#xD;
The lady knew nothing of Miss Tresham's ante.&#xD;
cedents, except that she was a West Indian, and&#xD;
had come to her very well recommended. She&#xD;
seemed much surprised when I asked her if she&#xD;
knew any thing of her after her departure from&#xD;
Cumberland, and replied at once in the negative.&#xD;
From none of the servants or hangers-on about&#xD;
the place could I obtain any more definite infor-&#xD;
mation. Miss Treshamn seems to have been very&#xD;
well liked while she was in Cumberland, and to&#xD;
have left a g'ood name behind her when she went&#xD;
away, but nobody considered her of sufficient&#xD;
importance to inquire about or take interest in&#xD;
after she passed out of their lives.&#xD;
"1 am very sorry that this information is so&#xD;
meagre, and that I have not been able to give&#xD;
you more satisfaction, but 1 have been stopped&#xD;
at every turn-first by the solicitors, then by&#xD;
Mr. St. John's absence, and finally by the com-&#xD;
plete manner in which all trace of Miss Tresham&#xD;
had vanished from Donthorne Place. If you&#xD;
wish any further ihquirics prosecuted, let me&#xD;
hear from you without loss of time.&#xD;
"Respectfully, etc.,&#xD;
"T. W. WAnD."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley read the letter to its end-r-.her&#xD;
lips parted, and her breath coming more quickly,&#xD;
with every minute. When she finished she&#xD;
&#xD;
stopped a second-in blank astonishment, as it&#xD;
were-then let her face drop on her hands, while&#xD;
something like a dry sob rose in her throat.&#xD;
This was all l She had steadily worked herself&#xD;
into the belief that some terrible disclosure was&#xD;
to reward her exertions, some disclosure that&#xD;
would at once open Morton's eyes, and place&#xD;
Katharine in her power; and now this cruel let-&#xD;
ter came, and, after all the hope, all the expec-&#xD;
tation, left the mystery as complete as ever!&#xD;
Surely it was bitter! Surely it was hard! She&#xD;
paid no heed to the lawyer's letter lying unread&#xD;
before her. She knew so well what he said,&#xD;
that the mere thought of reading the curt, busi-&#xD;
ness-like sentences filled her with disgust. For&#xD;
a time she felt as if her whole plan, and, with&#xD;
her plan, the whole tissue of herlife, had suddenly&#xD;
come to an end. if she could show him nothing&#xD;
worse than this, Morton would marry the girl,&#xD;
and then-&#xD;
But she was not a woman to remain long in&#xD;
such a mood as this. Soon she came to herself;&#xD;
and the first proof which she gave of it was to&#xD;
take up the lawyer's letter and read it. "I will&#xD;
see what he has to say," she muttered. This was&#xD;
what Mr. Burns had to say:&#xD;
"DEAn MADAM: Herewith you will find en-&#xD;
closed the letter from London of which I spoke&#xD;
in my last. I am sorry to say that my agent has&#xD;
not justified my opinion of him. The informa-&#xD;
tion which he sends, any child, who had been&#xD;
told to make the inquiries, could easily have ac-&#xD;
quired. lie tells us no more than we knew be.&#xD;
fore, and does not throw ~ single ray of light on&#xD;
Mr. St. John or Miss Tresham. I am very sorry,&#xD;
and a little ashamed to think that at my age I&#xD;
should have employed a man who could do no&#xD;
better than this.&#xD;
"You ask for my opinio~i of the matter. I&#xD;
know too little yet to form or express an opinion,&#xD;
but if you decide to prosecute your inquiries, I&#xD;
would advise you to do so through certain chan-&#xD;
nels of secret inquiry which are now established&#xD;
in all large cities, and employ agents so well&#xD;
trained in the work, that for a consideration-&#xD;
and, generally, it must be confessed, a very large&#xD;
consideration-it is possible to learn any thing&#xD;
about anybody. This mode would be expensive&#xD;
but secure; and if you wish to track the secret&#xD;
down, in the shortest possible time, I would&#xD;
counsel you to let Miss Tresham alone, and fol-&#xD;
low Mr. St. John and his employer. It is evident&#xD;
to me that there is some close connection be-&#xD;
tween them, and what you desire to know. May&#xD;
&#xD;
ST. JOHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
91&#xD;
&#xD;
not Mr. St. John be acting for his employer in&#xD;
the matter? I merely throw out the suggestion.&#xD;
Trusting that you will let me hear from you on&#xD;
the subject, 1 am,&#xD;
"Very respectfully,&#xD;
"WM. F. BuaNs."&#xD;
When Mrs. Annesley put down this letter,&#xD;
she felt that her face was burning. It was the&#xD;
cool proposition of the lawyer, the coQI words,&#xD;
"certain channels of secret inquiry," which had&#xD;
suddenly showed her where she was standing,&#xD;
and what she was doing. She said "Good&#xD;
Heavens C" all at once, as if she had received&#xD;
an unexpected blow; and then she was silent,&#xD;
and tried to look the situation in the face.&#xD;
She was a selfish woman, and a woman whose&#xD;
whole heart was bound up in her children and&#xD;
their interests-bound up~ not with the tender&#xD;
devotion that would make some women martyrs,&#xD;
but with a steady force that would have sacri-&#xD;
ficed all the rest of the world to them-but she&#xD;
was not at all the scheming intrigan~e of ro-&#xD;
mance. If she proved merciless in the ease of&#xD;
her cousin, it was not so much from that desire&#xD;
for Morton House which long indulgence had fos-&#xD;
tered, as from the rankling dislike born of early&#xD;
envy. With regard to these inquiries about Kath-&#xD;
arine, she had begun them, and from the first&#xD;
looked upon them as the purest matter of&#xD;
duty. As she told Adela, she had made up&#xD;
her mind that the girl was an unprincipled&#xD;
adventuress, and she would have thought it&#xD;
wrong to hesitate at any means which would&#xD;
remove her from Morton's life. To-day, for the&#xD;
first time, a feeling of dismay came over her.&#xD;
What was she doing? Was this indeed a thing&#xD;
which no man or woman of even the merest&#xD;
worldly honor should be guilty of? She was&#xD;
coolly advised to prosecute secret inquiries into&#xD;
the private life of people she had never seen,&#xD;
and the advice s'!ruck her with a sudden sense&#xD;
of shame and humiliation. "It is for him-for&#xD;
Morton," she said, as she had often said before;&#xD;
but somehow the words did not bring theirusual&#xD;
reassurance and consolation.&#xD;
This, however, was not the time for consider-&#xD;
ations like these. She remembered with a feeling&#xD;
of impatience that it was Christmas Day, that&#xD;
her houge was full of guests, and that her own&#xD;
place was down-stairs. She put the letters into&#xD;
her secretary, and rang sharply for her maid.&#xD;
But while she changed her dress, she was think-&#xD;
ing of the great solemn dinner before her-the&#xD;
Christmas dinner par excellence, like which there&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
was no other throughout the entire year-think&#xD;
ing of Katharine, thinking of the expostulating&#xD;
remarks she had heard that morning, thinking&#xD;
also of the letters she had read, thinking of the&#xD;
entire failure of her scheme, and wishing that&#xD;
she had not so uselessly thrown this apple of&#xD;
'discord into the midst of her well-ordered party,&#xD;
but had left it in peace in Mr. Marks's garden.&#xD;
"What on earth will come of it all?" she&#xD;
said to herself; as she slowly went down-stairs,&#xD;
and the sound of Katharine's voice rose from the&#xD;
back drawing-room, mingled with the rich, deep&#xD;
tones of the organ. Mrs. Annesley knew what&#xD;
sort of faces the ladies in the front drawing.&#xD;
room were wearing, and she actually felt cow-&#xD;
ardly about going down to meet them. It would&#xD;
have been strange, and consoling, too, perhaps,&#xD;
if she had only known that, when she laid down&#xD;
her weapons, Fate took them up, and from that&#xD;
time forth ceased not to fight for her.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
ST. JOHN.&#xD;
As time went on, matters, from the ladies'&#xD;
point of view, grew decidedly worse instead of&#xD;
better. Perversely enough, the gentlemen per-&#xD;
sisted in paying attention to Miss Tresham, in&#xD;
stoutly maintaining that she was pretty, and in&#xD;
finding her very entertaining. No girl of the&#xD;
party could gather a larger circle of admirers&#xD;
teund her, or keep them amused for a longer&#xD;
space of time-not even Irene Vernon, with all&#xD;
her beauty. How Miss Tresham managed it,&#xD;
nobody was able to explain; but that she did&#xD;
manage it was, to say the least, amply proved.&#xD;
"She must necessarily suffer by a comparison&#xD;
with Ircad Vernon," Mrs. Annesley had said,&#xD;
with profound confidence in her own assertion.&#xD;
What words, then, can describe her dismay when&#xD;
she found that there were others besides Morton&#xD;
who had sufficiently bad taste to find a charm In&#xD;
those gray eyes and that pretty mouth, which&#xD;
Irene Vernon's regular features lacked?&#xD;
"There is no use denying the fact," Miss Les-&#xD;
ter said, with a little play of the eyebrows, pecu-&#xD;
liar to herself; "Miss Tresham throws us all in&#xD;
the shade; and for my part I should like to know&#xD;
how she does it."~&#xD;
Mrs. French, to whom this speech was made,&#xD;
shrugged her shoulders with considerable impa-&#xD;
tience.&#xD;
"She does it simply on the strength of being&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

92&#xD;
&#xD;
MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
something new," she answered. "Men are such&#xD;
fools about a new face! They talk of the fickle-&#xD;
ness of women, when the fact is, that ekey would&#xD;
grow tired of Venus herself."&#xD;
Whether or not this was a correct solution&#xD;
of the matter, it was at least certain that Miss&#xD;
Tresham made a sensation-a sensation not 4o&#xD;
be doi~bted, and which took herself as much by&#xD;
surprise as it could possibly have taken anybody&#xD;
else; She enjoyed it, and entered into it with&#xD;
great zest. As she had told Mrs. Gordon she&#xD;
was fon4 of pleasure, and here was pleasure of&#xD;
the best kind, mingled with that elixir of ad-&#xD;
miration which is the sweetest draught that can&#xD;
be put to the lips of youth. Mrs. Marks would&#xD;
hardly have recognized her quiet governess in&#xD;
the bright, handsome girl who laughed, and&#xD;
talked, and sang at Annesdale, and who, all of&#xD;
a sudden, developed a power of attraction that&#xD;
quite carried the young men out of their senses.&#xD;
The young ladies were piqued and puzzled, but&#xD;
they managed to console themselves with their&#xD;
own sworn admirers; while the elders looked&#xD;
on in amazement and indignation, too deep for&#xD;
words. roor Katharine! If they had only&#xD;
known it, they need not have grudged her this&#xD;
short holiday of natural,, youthful enjoyment.&#xD;
Even while her heart was lightest and her spir-&#xD;
its at their best, a sudden dark cloud arose, and&#xD;
the sunshine went out of her sky for many a&#xD;
long day.&#xD;
Rapidly and pleasantly the time flew by.&#xD;
Anybody who has ever been in a country-house&#xD;
of this description, knows how rapidly and how&#xD;
pleasantly time can fly on such occasions, yet&#xD;
how impossible it is to give any exacL descrip-&#xD;
tion of the enjoyment that helps its flight. Pee-&#xD;
plc, as it seems, are doing a dozen things at&#xD;
once, and they all go to make up an harmonious&#xD;
whole. There are flirting couples behind the&#xD;
'curtains of the bay-windows, in the shady re-&#xD;
cesses of the library, in the hall, on the piazzas,&#xD;
walking over the grounds-in fact, flirting is the&#xD;
chief amusement and grand order of the day.&#xD;
Then, there are groups around the piano, and&#xD;
small card-tables, and billiard-players, and peo-&#xD;
pie continually driving up in carriages, and riding&#xD;
off on horseback; and servants coming and go.&#xD;
ing, and dogs everywhere, and a perfect tide of&#xD;
life flowing here and there, and centering every&#xD;
day around the dinner-table. Usually in the&#xD;
morning, about three or four o'clock, there was&#xD;
an uproar of hounds, and horns, and horses,&#xD;
that roused every sleeper in the house, when all&#xD;
the gentlemen, with the exception of one or two&#xD;
&#xD;
who were considered hopeless sybarites, went&#xD;
fox-hunting-dropping in again, about mId-day,&#xD;
either flushed with success or dispirited by fail-&#xD;
ure, but in either case quite ready to take up&#xD;
their respective flirtations just at the point&#xD;
where they had been left off.&#xD;
On such a morning as this-.a morning when&#xD;
the hunters werd out and had not yet returned,&#xD;
and the ladies were wandering about aimlessly&#xD;
or yawning in each other's faces-Katharine sat&#xD;
by one of the drawing-room windows trifling&#xD;
over some needlework, when Irene Vernon came&#xD;
up to her.&#xD;
"Are you busy?" asked the young lady, ab-&#xD;
ruptly. "If you don't mind leaving that work,&#xD;
suppose we take a walk? it is a lovely&#xD;
day."&#xD;
Katharine did not mind leaving the work at&#xD;
all; so she put it down, got her bonnet and&#xD;
shawl, and in a few minutes was walking by Miss&#xD;
Vernon's side out of the front door. They went&#xD;
down the piazza steps together and turned into a&#xD;
path to the right, that, winding down among the&#xD;
shrubbery, soon led them out of sight of the&#xD;
house. Irene gave a sigh of relief when the last&#xD;
glimpse of the chimneys was shut out, and they&#xD;
had a wall of green on one side, and a fair out-&#xD;
look of rolling country on the other.&#xD;
iy. "~ am so glad to get away," she said, frank.&#xD;
I lose all patience with those girls; they&#xD;
don't seem to have an idea what to do with them-&#xD;
selves when the gentlemen are absent. They&#xD;
mope about, and are ennuyc~es and stupid to the&#xD;
last degree, and all because they are thrown on&#xD;
their own resources for a few hours. It is disgust-&#xD;
ing 1" said the young lady, with an expression&#xD;
of face that quite suited her words. "It is&#xD;
really enough to make one ashamed of being a&#xD;
woman!"&#xD;
"It is natural, I suppose," said Katharine.&#xD;
"Why should it be natural ?" retorted Miss&#xD;
Vernon, indignantly. "It is not natural at all-&#xD;
it is the way they are taught and trained. Men&#xD;
are not so," she went on, with an impatience&#xD;
that amused her listener. "You never hear of&#xD;
their pining and moping because there are no&#xD;
women about. They like each other's society a&#xD;
great deal the best; and. they always take it&#xD;
when they can get it. It is only women who are&#xD;
so absurdly and disgustingly dependent-who&#xD;
can find no zest or amusement whatever in the&#xD;
society of other women. Heaven only knows&#xD;
why! I am sure I would rather be talking to&#xD;
you than to any man of all the party."&#xD;
"Thank you," said Katharine, smiling. Then&#xD;
&#xD;
ST. JOHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
she added, archly, "Won't you even make an&#xD;
exception in favor of Mr. Seymour?"&#xD;
"Why should I?" asked the young lady,&#xD;
carelessly. "He is a good fellow-dear, old&#xD;
Godfrey!-and I have known him all my life;&#xD;
but, excepting for that, he is no more to me than&#xD;
any other man. Is there anybody sioa would&#xD;
prefer as a companion?"&#xD;
"Nobody at all," answered Katharine, still&#xD;
smiling. "Indeed, I sjiould be at a loss to think&#xD;
of anybody, unless I chose Mr. Langdon, or Mr.&#xD;
Talcott, or that very singular Mr Hallam, who&#xD;
makes me afraid he is going to snap mybend off&#xD;
every time he begins to talk."&#xD;
"Or Morton Annesley," said her companion.&#xD;
Katharine started, and gave a keen glance at&#xD;
the face beside her, but failed to read any thing&#xD;
there. Miss Vernon was walking along tearing&#xD;
a geranium-leaf to pieces, and did not even raise&#xD;
her eyes.&#xD;
"I don't know why I should make an excep-&#xD;
tion of Mr. Annesley," said Miss Tresham, a little&#xD;
distantly.&#xD;
"I thought he was a friend of yours," an-&#xD;
swered Miss Vernon. "If I had a friend, I&#xD;
would not speak of him in such a tone as that."&#xD;
"If you had a friend!" repeated Katharine,&#xD;
a little surprised. "Have you no friend, then?"&#xD;
"Of my own making, independently of family&#xD;
liking and hereditary connection, and all that&#xD;
sort of thing? Not one. All my life I have&#xD;
wished that I might stand on my own merits and&#xD;
see if I could gain a friend who would like me&#xD;
for myself. But I have never done so, and, in-&#xD;
deed, it would be quite useless, for, if I cannot&#xD;
attract people with so many aids to win their re-&#xD;
gard, what would I do without these aids? I&#xD;
should be simply hated-that is all."&#xD;
"You are one of the last persons in the&#xD;
world I could possibly have expected to hear&#xD;
talk in this way."&#xD;
"Because I am pretty and rich? Neither&#xD;
of those facts make me less unamiable or less&#xD;
unpopular. Not that I care for the unpopular-&#xD;
ity, but I should like to have one or two friends,&#xD;
and I have none."&#xD;
She made the statement in a quiet, decided&#xD;
tone, and Katharine was astonished, and puzzled,&#xD;
and sorry all at once.&#xD;
"Miss Vernon," she said, "I am sure you do&#xD;
many people great injustice."&#xD;
"Of course I am not talking of my own fain-&#xD;
ily,"said Miss Vernon, "They are fond of me,&#xD;
as one will be fond of one's own flesh and blood,&#xD;
let it be ever so disagreeable. And I am very&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
93&#xD;
&#xD;
disagreeable," she added, looldng the young gov-&#xD;
erness straight in the face.&#xD;
"I have really been considering you very&#xD;
charming," said the other, trying to preserve an&#xD;
appearance of gravity.&#xD;
"Then you are the first woman who ever did&#xD;
so," answered her companion. "The most of&#xD;
them think me detestable, and, indeed) I don't&#xD;
wonder-my temper is so easily upset, and my&#xD;
tongue is so sharp. I try to keep it under con-&#xD;
trol1 but somehow I can't. I don't ever hear you&#xD;
make ill-natured remarks, Miss Tresham; and&#xD;
yet you are not silly either. How do you man-&#xD;
age it?"&#xD;
"I don't know that I often feel inclined to&#xD;
make ill-natured remarks; but, whenldoI&#xD;
don't give way to the inclination."&#xD;
"And I always give way. Then, people&#xD;
think, 'How hateful she is!' ~and, honestly&#xD;
speaking, I don't blame them. As for my ad-&#xD;
mirers, some of- them like me for my face, and&#xD;
some for my fortune; but, if I were to try for-&#xD;
ever, I could not secure half as much genuine&#xD;
admiration as you have obtained, without trying,&#xD;
during the last few days."&#xD;
"Miss Vernon, you do yourself as much in-&#xD;
justice as you do other people. Yon are clever,&#xD;
and frank, and unaffected-what more could a&#xD;
woman wish to be?"&#xD;
"I am sharp, and haughty, and ill-natured,"&#xD;
said Miss Vernon, summing up her bad qualities&#xD;
with an utter disregard of this attempt at con-&#xD;
solation. "If you knew me long enough, you&#xD;
would be repelled like everybody else. I really&#xD;
l;elieve Godfrey Seymour is the only person who&#xD;
knows all my faults and likes me in spite of&#xD;
them; while I like him-poor, dear fellow 1-as&#xD;
if-as if he was a great Newfoundland dog."&#xD;
"No better?"&#xD;
"Not a bit better."&#xD;
She spoke decidedly, and Miss Treshans could&#xD;
not help feeling a little sorry for the gentleman&#xD;
who was liked in this canine fashion. "He de-&#xD;
serves something better," she thought; but it&#xD;
was none of her business to say so, and they&#xD;
walked on silently, the bright winter day lying in&#xD;
still beauty all around them, birds singing over&#xD;
their heads, and a faint, purple mist softening&#xD;
the distant hills like a harbinger of spring.&#xD;
Again it was Miss Vernon who spoke first, and&#xD;
spoke abruptly:&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, do you know it is a plan ~f&#xD;
our respective relations to marry Morton Mines-&#xD;
Icy and myself to each other?"&#xD;
"I-" Katharine was quite taken aback by&#xD;
&#xD;
Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8070-00000052"/>&#xD;
94                                 MORT(&#xD;
'thisunexpected question. "Yes, I have heard&#xD;
something of the kind."&#xD;
"A nice idea, isn't it?" said the young lady,&#xD;
with a smile that was rather too bright to be&#xD;
natural. "I don't think I ever heard any thing&#xD;
more absurd. Frank French is my cousin, you&#xD;
know, and so Adela and Flora took it into their&#xD;
wise heads that Morton and I would make a good&#xD;
match, without any regard to the triffing fact that&#xD;
neither of us ever had any fancy-any special&#xD;
fancy, that is-for the other. Of course, he&#xD;
was repelled by my temper, as everybody is,&#xD;
while I-well, I never thought of him at all. I&#xD;
should have been a fool if I had, considering&#xD;
that he never was~ more than civil to me. He is&#xD;
a charming gentleman, though," she said, look-&#xD;
ing at Katharine, "and any woman whom he&#xD;
loved would do well to marry him."&#xD;
They were almost the same words that Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon had spoken, little more than a week be.&#xD;
fore, and, hearing them thus the second time,&#xD;
they filled Katharine with a sudden sense of sur-&#xD;
prise and amusement, which it is impossible to&#xD;
describe. She understood perfectly what assur~&#xD;
ance it was that Miss Vernon wished to convey&#xD;
to her, and the humor of the situation overpow-&#xD;
ered for the moment every other consideration.&#xD;
It was strange enough that his own cousin, a&#xD;
woman steeped to the lips in the traditions&#xD;
of her class and the pride of blood, should have&#xD;
advised her to marry Morton; but for this young&#xD;
beauty, this girl, who, according to the vulgar&#xD;
melodramatic idea, should have been her "ri-&#xD;
val," to echo such advice! A comic vision of&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley's horror rose before Katharine,&#xD;
and almost made her laugh.&#xD;
"I suite agree with you," she answered, as&#xD;
quietly as she had answered Mrs. Gordon. "Th&amp;amp;&#xD;
woman whom h~ loved, and who loved him,&#xD;
would do well to marry Mn Anneslcy.~ But how&#xD;
is this? We have come round to the gates."&#xD;
"By a longer route than the carriage-drive,&#xD;
but one just as sure," said Miss Vernon, smiling.&#xD;
"See! there is some one coming in. Shall we&#xD;
turn and go back the way we came?"&#xD;
Before Katharine could reply, Spitfire, who&#xD;
had lately taken quite a fancy to her, and had&#xD;
condescended to follow her out, made a' wild&#xD;
rush at the figure just entering the gate, barking&#xD;
with a degree of fury almost incomprehensible,&#xD;
considering the size of the body from which the&#xD;
sound proceeded. Notwithstanding his insigni-&#xD;
ficant appearance, he quite startled and over-&#xD;
powered the newcomer. This person-a tall,&#xD;
slender, well-dressed man-backed against the&#xD;
&#xD;
)N HOUSE.ST. JOHN.                                                                              9&#xD;
&#xD;
gate, and began kicking at his assailant with&#xD;
one foot, which proceeding, of course, irritated&#xD;
Spitfire to the extreme of canine wrath.&#xD;
"Call him off! call him off!" cried Miss&#xD;
Vernon to Katharine. "He will bite the man,&#xD;
or the man will hurt him, and that would make&#xD;
Maggie furious, you know. Do call him off!"&#xD;
Katharine called and called again; but Spit.&#xD;
fire, who did not obey his mistress, was certainly&#xD;
not likely to obey her. He danced round the&#xD;
stranger like a dog that was possessed, and gave&#xD;
no sign of heeding. So Katharine went forward&#xD;
and addressed the other combatant, who kicked&#xD;
quite as furiously as Spitfire barked.&#xD;
"Fray don't do that!" she cried. "He&#xD;
won't bite, I assure you, and-"&#xD;
She stopped short. Miss Vernon, standing&#xD;
at a little distance, looking on, saw her suddenly&#xD;
put her hands to her face, and utter a low cry.&#xD;
The kicker dropped his foot, and, disregarding&#xD;
Spitfire, made a quick step forward.~&#xD;
"Katharine 1" he said, eagerly-" my dear&#xD;
Katharine!"&#xD;
But at the sound of his voice the girl raised&#xD;
her face, all white and drawn, and held out her&#xD;
hands, not to welcome, but to keep him back.&#xD;
"You!" she said, hoarsely; "you!"&#xD;
"Yes, I," he said, so much the more self-&#xD;
possessed of the two that it was evident this&#xD;
meeting was not entirely unexpected on his part.&#xD;
"I ~thought you would not be~unprepared. I&#xD;
wrote to you not long ago. Did you not receive&#xD;
my letter?"&#xD;
She made an effort to speak before she suc-&#xD;
ceeded; then, with a sort of dry.gasp, the words&#xD;
were articulated&#xD;
"Yes, I received it; but I thought-I hoped&#xD;
-that is, I was fool enough to think-to hope-&#xD;
that you might care for me sufficiently to leave&#xD;
me alone."&#xD;
"To 'leave you alone, my dear Katharine?"&#xD;
His face expressed the liveliest surprise. "Am&#xD;
I not your natural protector, your-"&#xD;
"Hush!', 'she said, so fiercely that he abso-&#xD;
lutely started back. "Let me hear none of that&#xD;
cant! What do you want with me, now that you&#xD;
have come?"&#xD;
"I must see and speak to you," he said, a&#xD;
little sulkily. "Will you take me to the&#xD;
house?"&#xD;
"To the house? to be asked who and what&#xD;
you are? My God, no! Wait here a moment;&#xD;
I will speak-"&#xD;
She left him, and hastily followed Miss Ver-&#xD;
non, who, with well-bred consideration, had&#xD;
&#xD;
walked out of ear-8hot of the conversation.&#xD;
Hearing Katharine's step behind her, she paused&#xD;
and turned.&#xD;
"'So you found an acquaintance, Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am?" she began, with a smile, when the terri-&#xD;
ble pallor of the girl's face startled her. "Good&#xD;
Heavens! what is the matter?" she cried, in&#xD;
sudden alarm.&#xD;
"Nothing - nothing," answered Katharine,&#xD;
striving to force a smile that only made her look&#xD;
more ghastly; "only I-lam obliged to ask you&#xD;
to return to the house without me. This gentle-&#xD;
man is an-an acquaintance of mine, and I must&#xD;
stop to speak to him. You will excuse me, I&#xD;
am sure.&#xD;
"Certainly I will excuse you," said Miss Ver-&#xD;
non, trying hard to keep her surprise out of her&#xD;
voice. "But, if you will pardon mc, had you&#xD;
not better take your friend to the house? I am&#xD;
sure Mrs. Annesley-"&#xD;
"I cannot do that," said Katharine, nervous-&#xD;
ly. "I could not think of taking such a lib-&#xD;
erty. Then, no privacy is possible in the house,&#xD;
and I must see this gentleman privately. My&#xD;
dear Miss Vernon, if you will only be kind&#xD;
enough not to say any thing-"&#xD;
"Of course, I shall not say any thing," inter-&#xD;
rupted Miss Vernon, hastily.&#xD;
Then she called Spitfire, and, without a sin-&#xD;
gle backward glance, disappeared down the&#xD;
path.&#xD;
When the last flutter of her dress vanished&#xD;
from sight, Katharine turned and beckoned to&#xD;
the man, who was still standing where she had&#xD;
left him. He obeyed the signal with alacrity;&#xD;
and, as he walked quickly forward, she moved&#xD;
on in front of him~ and did not pause until she&#xD;
had reached the most secluded part of' the&#xD;
grounds - a deep, bosky dell, where a little&#xD;
brook ran, and where they were entirely safe&#xD;
from observation. There she turned and fhccd&#xD;
him-white, but by this time composed and&#xD;
rigidly braced, as it seemed, for any thing.'&#xD;
"Well," she said, with icy coldness, "what&#xD;
isit?"&#xD;
"By Jove! my dear Katharine, your Amer-&#xD;
ican sojourn seems to have improved the warmth&#xD;
of your affections," said her companion, with&#xD;
a smile. "Is this the only greeting you have&#xD;
for me - me, who have come so far to see&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"St. John," she cried, passionately, "let me&#xD;
hear no more of this! I cannot, will not,' bear&#xD;
it! You have already worked me all the harm'&#xD;
'that it is 'in the power of one person to inflict&#xD;
&#xD;
upon another. You are here now, in. defiance of&#xD;
your most solemn obligations, to injure me fur-&#xD;
ther; and yet-and yet you dare' to talk like&#xD;
this! For Heaven's sake, let me hear no more&#xD;
of it!"&#xD;
"That is just as you please," said he, with&#xD;
a relapse into sulkiness.&#xD;
Nothing was said after this for several min-&#xD;
utes. The two figures 'stood silently facing each&#xD;
other-the leafless trees and dark evergreens all&#xD;
around them, and the limpid stream flowing at&#xD;
their feet. Katharine's bright winter costume&#xD;
made a beautiful "bit" of color on the some-&#xD;
what sombre landscape-her companion being,&#xD;
in appearance at least, less interesting. Yet he&#xD;
was not an ill-looking man; on the contrary,&#xD;
many people would have called him handsome,&#xD;
and been justified in doing so. He was, in age,&#xD;
somewhere between twenty-five and thirty-cer-&#xD;
tainly not younger than the one or older than&#xD;
the other - he had a slender, elegant figure&#xD;
and a dark, well-modelled face-a face with a&#xD;
good complexion, dark eyes, thin lips, and a&#xD;
painfully-narrow forehead. The man was not a&#xD;
sensualist-no man with that mouth could have&#xD;
been-but a physiognomist, looking at him,&#xD;
would have said that he was selfish and unscru-&#xD;
pulous, and in so saying would not have gone&#xD;
very far wide of the truth. It was Katharine&#xD;
who spoke first.&#xD;
"You asked me if I received your letter.&#xD;
Did you get my reply?"&#xD;
"It was impossible for me to have done so,"&#xD;
he answered. "I left England Immediately after&#xD;
writing that letter. Was there any thing of im-&#xD;
portance in yours?"&#xD;
"Nothing," she answered, drearily. "I asked&#xD;
you to let mealone-that was all, I mighthave&#xD;
known how useless that was - I. might have&#xD;
known that you never did, nor ever will cousid~r&#xD;
any one but yourself. 'How did you find ~ut&#xD;
where I was?" she added; turning upon him&#xD;
suddenly. "You gave me no explanation of&#xD;
that, and I don't understand how it was"&#xD;
"There are a great many things you don't,&#xD;
understand, 'm~iy dear Katharine,", said he, in a&#xD;
patronizing tone. "This must remain one of&#xD;
them. I found out where 'you were just as 'I&#xD;
should find it out if you were foolish enough to&#xD;
go and bury yourself and all your fine talent in&#xD;
the South Sea Islands. I have ways and means&#xD;
-believe me it is useless to attempt tG hide&#xD;
from me. I thought I should never reach this&#xD;
place," he went on, with a shrug of the shoul-&#xD;
ders, "and when I at last, arrived, and thought&#xD;

&#xD;
all my difficulties were over, I went to the worn.&#xD;
an with whom you lF~e, and she told me-"&#xD;
"What!" cried Katharine, starting. "You&#xD;
have Seen Mrs. Marks?"&#xD;
"Certainly I have," answered he, coolly,&#xD;
"and a dozen or so children, besides. It was&#xD;
she who told me you were here. Did you think&#xD;
I found it out by instinct?"&#xD;
"And what did youtell her to account for&#xD;
your inquiries?" asked Katharine, almost wring-&#xD;
ing her hands. "Oh, St. John, you surely have&#xD;
not told her-"&#xD;
"Not'hlng at all," said he, roughly. "Don't&#xD;
make a fool of yourself! Am I the devil, or do&#xD;
I look like him, thttt you should be so afraid of.&#xD;
claiming connection with me? I told the woman&#xD;
-she looks like a respectable cook, by-the-way&#xD;
-that I was a friend of yours, from England.&#xD;
She was evidently very curious, but I thought&#xD;
that was enough for her."&#xD;
"And what am I to tell her when I go back,&#xD;
and she speaks of you, as she is sure to do?"&#xD;
"Tell her that I am your brother."*&#xD;
"I will not," cried she, indignantly.&#xD;
"Wellwhatever lie may be convenient, then.&#xD;
I~an~ ready to play any part. We might com-&#xD;
promise on uncle, since you objeCt to brother,&#xD;
for I am afraid ~ am rather young to attempt the&#xD;
rdls of father."&#xD;
"St. John, be serious," she cried, with some-&#xD;
tiring like a sob in her throat. "Don't you see&#xD;
that I cannot bear such wretched trifling. Oh!&#xD;
if you had ever cared for me in the least degree,&#xD;
you would never embitter my life like this!"&#xD;
"If you had a grain of common-sense, you&#xD;
would not make such a fuss over nothing," said&#xD;
he, in4atiently. "Have I not a right to see you&#xD;
when and where I choose? I will go up yonder&#xD;
among your new associates and assert it, if you&#xD;
say so."&#xD;
"Jif you date!" said she, blazing out upon&#xD;
him, *ith sudden indignation. "Yes, if you&#xD;
dare! You have tracked me down, and I am&#xD;
willing to buy my peace of life at any price you&#xD;
oboes. to ask-short of this. St. John," she&#xD;
said, sitting down on a rustic seat near by,&#xD;
"this is too much for me. Tell me at once&#xD;
wha~t you want-and----and let me go."&#xD;
He walked away from her for a short dis-&#xD;
tance, biting his under lip abnost savagely; then&#xD;
he turnedabruptly, and can&#xD;
"You know what I want~' he said. "Itis&#xD;
* always the same thing-the cursed need of&#xD;
money. Can you let me have any?"&#xD;
"I can let you have the most of my two&#xD;
&#xD;
* years' salary, which is in Mr. Marks's hands, if&#xD;
you will go away then, and leave me in peace."&#xD;
"So you only care to buy my absence," he&#xD;
said, with a dark cloud coming over his face.&#xD;
"Ask yourself how I can care for any thing&#xD;
else," she answered, sadly. "But such as the&#xD;
money is, you are welcome to it. I saved it for&#xD;
you, and meant to send it to you-so you are&#xD;
welcome to it."&#xD;
He moved away, and took another turn--&#xD;
came bac~t again and caught her arm.&#xD;
"I would not touch a penny of it, if ruin was&#xD;
not staring me in the face," he said. "But, as&#xD;
it is, I see no other chance-not one."&#xD;
"Has that man-that Fraser-thrown you&#xD;
oft; then?"&#xD;
"Curse him, yes-completely!"&#xD;
"And you have only me?"&#xD;
"I have only you, or you may be sure that I&#xD;
would not have come for any such greeting as&#xD;
this has been."&#xD;
She rose suddenly and held out her hands to&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Forgive me, St. John," she cried, with a&#xD;
sudden pathos in her voice. "I did not under-&#xD;
stand. I thought you had come merely to dis-&#xD;
turb and make me wretched., I will do any&#xD;
thing in the world for you that I can-you know&#xD;
that. If you say so, I will go away with you,&#xD;
and we will try to live together, and to begin a&#xD;
new life, in some new place."&#xD;
"And drag each other down, like a couple&#xD;
of millstones. That would be wise, indeed!&#xD;
No, I will only be cur enough to rob you of all&#xD;
your s~ivings, and then I will go away and leave&#xD;
you in the peace you talk so much about. When&#xD;
can you let inc have the money?"&#xD;
"To-morrow-I cannot see Mr. Marks to-day.&#xD;
I will meet you in Tallahoma, Or else you can&#xD;
come back here. I will show you a private way&#xD;
to enter the grounds, and this is a very retired&#xD;
place. I shall have to write a note. I suppose&#xD;
you are at the hotel?"&#xD;
"Yes-registered as Mr. Johns. Don't for-&#xD;
get that."&#xD;
Katharine flushed. She had an instinctive&#xD;
horror of an alias and this one seemed to her so&#xD;
unnecessary. "Who would have known the&#xD;
other name here?" she asked.&#xD;
"Nobody, probably; but I believe in precau-&#xD;
tionary measures, always. Well, I shall look for&#xD;
a note to-morrow, appointing a place where I can&#xD;
see you again. I can tell you, by-the-way, that&#xD;
you are putting yirnrself in a very bad position by&#xD;
this assignation business. It would be much bet.&#xD;
&#xD;
ter, and much safer, to take me to the house&#xD;
yonder, and present me as a foreign fricud."&#xD;
"I cannot--I will not!" she cried. "It&#xD;
might be better, perhaps, but I would rather&#xD;
run more risk, and meet you where nobody has&#xD;
a right to question who and what you are."&#xD;
"Just as you please. It is your own affair,"&#xD;
said he, carelessly. "Are you coming to show&#xD;
me the private entrance you spoke of? I am&#xD;
sure to meet somebody about those large gates."&#xD;
She went and showed it to him-quaking as&#xD;
she did so, lest some one should meet them; and&#xD;
when he was once safely beyond the boundary&#xD;
of the grounds, she gave a deep sigh of relief;&#xD;
and sped like an arrow toward the house.&#xD;
-4--&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
YOU CANNOT LET ME HELP von?&#xD;
WHEN Katharine entered the hall, the sounds&#xD;
which proceeded from the drawing-room assured&#xD;
her at once that the vigil of the ladies was over,&#xD;
and the fox-hunters had returned. On the stair-&#xD;
case the first person she met was Annesley, who&#xD;
was descending as she went up. He stopped&#xD;
and held out his hand.&#xD;
"Good.morninc~ Miss Tresham," he said,&#xD;
with a smile. "We are back again in a most&#xD;
dispirited aud luckless condition-dogs and all&#xD;
fairly outwitted by a fox. Won't you come and&#xD;
take a game of billiards, and help me to forget&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"Not just now," said Katharine, hardly&#xD;
knowing what she was saying. "I-I am just&#xD;
going to my room."&#xD;
He started a little, and still holding her hand,&#xD;
gazed earnestly into her face.&#xD;
"Something is the matter," he said, quickly.&#xD;
"I never saw you so pale before. Katharine-&#xD;
Miss Tresham, has anybody done any thing to&#xD;
annoy you?"&#xD;
"Nothing," she answered, eagerly. "Why&#xD;
should you think so? Everybody is very kind.&#xD;
There !-~.please let me pass. I am not well."&#xD;
"Something is the matter," repeated he, still&#xD;
oblivious of courtesy, and keeping his place be-&#xD;
fore her. "If you would only tell me-if it is&#xD;
any thing I could. set straight-"&#xD;
"It is not any thing you could set straight,"&#xD;
interrupted Katharine, almost wild to get away.&#xD;
"Mr. Annesley, will you-'will you please let me&#xD;
pass? I have told you I am not well."&#xD;
He moved aside, and, disregarding the pained&#xD;
&#xD;
look on hia face, she fiewby, and the next mo-&#xD;
ment he heard her chamber door open and shut.&#xD;
The young man stood for a minute where&#xD;
she had left him-pain gradually giving way to&#xD;
surprise on his face. Then he went down, and,&#xD;
as he crossed the hall, his mother came out of&#xD;
the library and joined him.&#xD;
"Are you going out, Morton?" she said.&#xD;
"Iwill walkwith you a little way. I have some-&#xD;
thing to say to you."&#xD;
"I was not going out," he answered; "but I&#xD;
can go, if you wish to speak to me."&#xD;
Without any further words, they passed out,&#xD;
and took the same path which Katharine and&#xD;
Miss Vernon had taken an hour or two before.&#xD;
After they had gone a short distance, Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley was the first to break the silence.&#xD;
"Was tha Miss Treshain you met on the&#xD;
staircase, Mor&#xD;
"Yes, it was Miss ~3.1resham," he answered,&#xD;
and in a moment it flashed across his mind that&#xD;
somebody had been guilty of slighting or annoy-&#xD;
ing Katharine, and that his mother knew of it.&#xD;
"Something was the matter with her," he said.&#xD;
"I never saw her look so before. She did not&#xD;
seem like herself at all. Somebody must hate&#xD;
offended ~ continued the young man, with&#xD;
suppressed anger in his voice. "Mother, if you&#xD;
know who it is, if any-"&#xD;
"Stop a moment, Morton," said Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
Icy, with dignity. "You forget that you are&#xD;
speaking of your own guests-of ladies and gen-&#xD;
tlemen who are incapable of being rude to any&#xD;
one. Nobody inside the doors of Anneadale has&#xD;
done any thing to wound or annoy Miss Tresharn;&#xD;
but what has occurred outside of them," she&#xD;
added, significantly, "it is quite beyond my&#xD;

"What do you mean ~ asked Morton, to&#xD;
whom this distinction was quite unintelligible.&#xD;
"I mean that something has happened which&#xD;
I think you ought to know. I was in the obser-&#xD;
vatory an hour or two ago, showing the view to&#xD;
Mrs. Dancey, when I happened to have myatten-&#xD;
tion directed toward the entrance gates. I Saw&#xD;
two figures which I easily Identified as Miss&#xD;
Tresham and Irene Vernon emerge from the&#xD;
shrubbery just as a man was entering the gates.&#xD;
Of course, at such a distance the action was&#xD;
rather confused to my sight, but I could distin-&#xD;
guish very plainly that a recognition took place&#xD;
between the man and Miss Tresham, and that,&#xD;
after Irene Vernon had first gone on alone, he&#xD;
and she entered the shrubbery together. I&#xD;
thought it singular; but nothing more, until I&#xD;

sw~red. "Well, I have done my duty-I have be employed in preparation. This was the ball&#xD;
&#xD;
of which Katharine had spoken to Mrs. Gordon,&#xD;
of which she had thought as the first and great-&#xD;
est item in her Christmas 'enjoyment; and now&#xD;
it was with a sick heart and ~ throbbing head&#xD;
that she faced the prospect of it, and the neces-&#xD;
sity of rising to dress. As she lay on her bed&#xD;
with the room darkened, the fire burning with a&#xD;
soft, crackling content, a wet handkerchief over&#xD;
her aching eyes, and a bottle of cologne-water&#xD;
in her hand, some despairing thoughts on the&#xD;
perversity of human circumstances occurred to&#xD;
her. She had come to Annesdale meaning to&#xD;
leave her weight of anxiety behind, and to en-&#xD;
joy herself for a short time with the natural en-&#xD;
joyment of youth; and all of a sudden every&#xD;
thing was dashed with bitterness! Poor Katha-&#xD;
rine! Very stern troubles were staring her in&#xD;
the face, but still she had time to give a sigh to&#xD;
her murdered pleasure. "If it had only been&#xD;
the day after the ball I" she thought to herself&#xD;
-and it is to be hoped that she will not be ac-&#xD;
counted utterly frivolous for doing so!&#xD;
She had at last risen languidly, and was look-&#xD;
ing with critical attention in the mirror, regard-&#xD;
ing her pale cheeks, her red eyes, and her swollen&#xD;
nose, wondering if it would be possible to bring&#xD;
all these features into order, or if she had net&#xD;
better make a virtue of necessity, and resign the&#xD;
ball, when the door ope~ied and Miss Lester en-&#xD;
tered.            -&#xD;
"So you are up!" cried this young lady, in&#xD;
her liveliest tone. "I am glad of that-glad&#xD;
because you are better, and because I have a&#xD;
wager on your going to the balL You are going,&#xD;
are you not?"&#xD;
"I was just considering about it," said&#xD;
Katharine, doubtfully, "Come and tell me&#xD;
what you think. I am looking frightfully, you&#xD;
see."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't see any thing of the kind," said&#xD;
Miss Lester, whose opix~ion was rather biased&#xD;
by personal interest. "Your eyes are red and&#xD;
-your-nose-a little. But that is because&#xD;
you have been crying. If you don't cry any&#xD;
more, by the time, you are dressed they will be&#xD;
all right. Then you are pale; but a little rouge&#xD;
.-.do you ever use rouge?"&#xD;
"You don't think it a sin, do you?"&#xD;
"I don't think any thing about it. As a&#xD;
matter of persoi~al taste, I don't like, and don't&#xD;
use it.-...that is all. I confess, however, that the&#xD;
sight of it affects me very much in the same&#xD;
way that a coarse perfume does. The two things&#xD;
always seem to me to go together."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't use it myself," said Miss Lester,&#xD;
philosophically, "but0a great many girls do. I&#xD;
have a cousin who paints dreadfully. However,&#xD;
paleness is becoming to you-.-you are generally&#xD;
pale-and I think you might go down. Dancing&#xD;
will soon give you a color, if any personal ar-&#xD;
guments are needed, Cousin Tom is half crazy to&#xD;
see you, and Spitfire will get a new collar if you&#xD;
go."&#xD;
Katharine thought of the unwelcome visitor&#xD;
whom Spitfire had forced upon her notice that&#xD;
morning, and felt very little of the grateful&#xD;
esteem which would have made her anxibus to&#xD;
secure a new collar for him. But still she suf.&#xD;
fered herself to be persuaded-especially as she&#xD;
did not need very much persuasion-and, after&#xD;
a short gossip in the fading twilight, the serious&#xD;
business of the toilet began.&#xD;
The ballroom at Anneadale formed a wing&#xD;
of the main building, and had been built by&#xD;
Morton since affairs came into his hands. It&#xD;
was a large, and (for a ballroom), decidedly&#xD;
tasteful apartment-ornamented sufficiently to&#xD;
avoid the look of disagreeable bareness, yet not&#xD;
overloaded by any means, and with every facility&#xD;
for light and warmth. It was a beautiful apart.&#xD;
ment, Katharine thoughts as she entered it for&#xD;
the first time that evening, and saw the lofty&#xD;
ceiling painted in brilliant.fresco, the double line&#xD;
of columns down the sides, the heavy green gar-&#xD;
lands that swung in festoons from one to ax~other,&#xD;
and the lights glittering in every direction, shin.&#xD;
ing on the scarlet holly-berries, and reflected&#xD;
back from the smoothly-waxed floor. Qn a&#xD;
raised stand at the upper end of the room the&#xD;
band was pealing forth a march, and the, guests,&#xD;
who had been lingering in the drawing.room~, in&#xD;
the green-house, in the library, in every place&#xD;
that was thrown open to the public, began .to&#xD;
pour in. A few couples were promenading in&#xD;
time to those strains, but with the majority there&#xD;
was an exciting rush to make engagements, and&#xD;
secure a desirable position in certain desirable&#xD;
ball-books.-" Are you engaged for the third set,&#xD;
Miss Josephine? "-"May I have the fifth, on&#xD;
your list, Miss Annie..? "-" Stand back, Tom, I&#xD;
have a word or two to say-Miss Mary, mayW~ I&#xD;

"A polka, did you say, Mr. Anderson? I never&#xD;
dance the round dances."&#xD;
All this was sounding at once in Katharine's&#xD;
ears, as she stood near a large pillar, looking&#xD;
very pale and pretty in her white dress, wreathed&#xD;
with blue convolvulus, when Annesley came up&#xD;
to her.&#xD;
"I have been looking for you everywhere,"&#xD;
he said, hastily, "and I have only time for a&#xD;
word. Will you give me the second set, and&#xD;
save two or three more for me?"&#xD;
"I cannot give you the second set," she an.&#xD;
swerved. "It is Mr. Talcott's."&#xD;
"The third, then?"&#xD;
"That belongs to Mr. Hallam."&#xD;
"The fourth-fifth-sixth---.any thing I Per-&#xD;
x!iit me-" he suddenly leaned forward, and,&#xD;
taking the little ivory toy that hung at her&#xD;
waist, ran his eye rapidly over the list of en-&#xD;
gagements, scribbled his initials in two or three&#xD;
vacant places, then, with a smile and a "Thank&#xD;
you," was gone. A moment later, Mr. Langdon&#xD;
left the side of a young lady with whom he was&#xD;
negotiating for a waltz, and claimed Katharine's&#xD;
hand for the dance about to commence. The&#xD;
measure of the music changed, the confused mass&#xD;
of figures formed into magical squares, the wall-&#xD;
flowers of both sexes fell back and clustered&#xD;
around or beyond the columns, and the amuse-&#xD;
ment of the evening began in earnest. To Kath-&#xD;
anne it would have been like enchantment, at&#xD;
another time; but now, above the sound of the&#xD;
music, the tread of dancing feet, the shifting&#xD;
to-and-fro of brightly-clad forms, she saw one&#xD;
face and hbard one voice that banished all gayety&#xD;
from her heart, and took all lightness from her&#xD;
step. Despite her efforts to the contrary, she&#xD;
seemed so unlike herself that her appearance&#xD;
struck a gentleman standing near the set in&#xD;
which she was dancing, a gentleman whose tall&#xD;
head towered somewhat above the throng of&#xD;
lookers-on-for all La Grange was in force there&#xD;
that nght, the county people thinking nothing&#xD;
of a ten-miles' drive to Mrs. Annesley's Christ-&#xD;
mas-balL His intent gaze caught Katharine's&#xD;
attention at last. In the course of cIwss~ing&#xD;
back and forth, she looked up, saw him, and&#xD;
smiled. "Oh, Mr. Warwick 1" she said, in a&#xD;
tone that surprised her partner.&#xD;
"Mr...-tsko?" he asked, looking round.&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick," answered Katharine, still&#xD;
smiling, and nodding to Mr. Warwick across the&#xD;
set. "I am so glad to see him," she went on.&#xD;
"It is like a home-face in the midst of strangers.&#xD;
I must speak to him as soon as the cotillon is&#xD;
&#xD;
over. I want to ask about Mrs. Marks, and the&#xD;
children, and all of them. I feel-"&#xD;
She stopped suddenly, and her face changed&#xD;
so much that her. companion absolutely stared.&#xD;
A sharp recollection came to her of the differ-&#xD;
ence that these few days had made in her life, of&#xD;
the man who had seen Mrs. Marks, and the in-&#xD;
quiries which~ would meet her when she returned&#xD;
to the familiar house in Tallahoma. Of course&#xD;
Mr. Langdon understood none of this, and, seeing&#xD;
her hesitate and turn pale, he at once conceived&#xD;
a suspicion of Mr. Warwick, and glanced across&#xD;
the room at that gentleman. Being somewhat&#xD;
reassured by his sedate, middle-aged appearance,&#xD;
he took up Katharine's sentence.&#xD;
"You feel-what? Not home-sick, I trust?"&#xD;
"I feel as if it had been such a long time&#xD;
since I left home," she answered, absently.&#xD;
"That is always the ease, you know, when one&#xD;
has been among new scenes and new people..-&#xD;
First gentleman and lady, did they say? You&#xD;
are the first gentleman, Mr. Langdon."&#xD;
Meanwhile, Morton was dancing with Miss&#xD;
Vernon, in quite another set, at the upper end&#xD;
of the room. He thought, and so did a great&#xD;
many other people, that Irene had never looked&#xD;
more lovely than on that night. Fashions&#xD;
change very much in thirty years, and to de-&#xD;
scribe her costume would probably be to bring&#xD;
a dreadful picture before the eyes of to-day; but&#xD;
everybody said how charmingly she was dressed,&#xD;
and certainly the shining pink silk that she&#xD;
wore, with rich point lace falling from her shoul-&#xD;
ders, was as becoming as possible. Then her&#xD;
cheeks were flushed, and her eyes were bright,&#xD;
and her hair looked like spun gold, as it&#xD;
gleamed about her graceful head. Morton, who&#xD;
had never thought very much about her beauty,&#xD;
suddenly opened his eyes, and achnired it with&#xD;
quite a fervor of enthusiasm. "I never saw you&#xD;
look so well," he could not help telling her more&#xD;
than once - though the remark strictly inter-&#xD;
preted was any thing but a compliment.&#xD;
"Perhaps you never looked at me before,"&#xD;
she said, though she hated herself for ~aying it.&#xD;
"Nobody else seems to think that I am looking&#xD;
unusually well to-night."&#xD;
"Shall we take a vote on the question, for I&#xD;
don't fancy the imputation of being a mole or a&#xD;
bat?"&#xD;
"No, thank you. I'll take the fact of my&#xD;
unusual good looks or your unusual good-nature,&#xD;
for granted, in preference to that. A propose of&#xD;
appearance, don't you think Miss Tresham is&#xD;
looking very well ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
r HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Very pretty, but not very well. She is too&#xD;
pale."&#xD;
"YeS, but she is one of the few people to&#xD;
whom pallor is becoming. And those morning-&#xD;
glories-are they not beautiful?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Morton, catching a glimpse of&#xD;
the morning-glories in question, as their wearer&#xD;
moved forward in the dance. Then he saw his&#xD;
way to a sudden inquiry, and made it without&#xD;
loss of time.&#xD;
"I met Miss Tresham on the staircase this&#xD;
morning, just after my return, and she seemed&#xD;
very much distressed and agitated. I hope&#xD;
nothing unpleasant occurred while you and she&#xD;
were in the grounds 1"'&#xD;
"Nothing," answered Miss Vernon, with a&#xD;
reticence that did not escape his observation.&#xD;
"How did you know that I was in the grounds&#xD;
with her?" she added, with a keen glance at him.&#xD;
"My mother told me," he answered. "Don't&#xD;
think that I was busying myself with matters&#xD;
which did not concern me," he added, with a&#xD;
quick flush coming over his face; "but when&#xD;
I met Miss Tresham, I saw at once that some-&#xD;
thing had annoyed her, and I thought it might&#xD;
be something I could remedy, so I went to my&#xD;
mother "-at the moment, Morton really forgot&#xD;
that his mother had gone to him-" and she told&#xD;
me that you had been with Miss Tresham, and&#xD;
mentioned that she met some one-"&#xD;
"I did not mention it at all," interrupted&#xD;
Miss Vernon, bluntly. "Miss Tresham asked&#xD;
me-that is, I thought it likely she would not&#xD;
care for me to speak of the matter, so I wa~&#xD;
sorry Mrs. Aunesley had seen the-the person&#xD;
come in the gate. I answered her questions,&#xD;
that was alL I shall not s~nswer yours, Mr. An.&#xD;
nesley, so I beg you won't ask any~~&#xD;
"I am not going to ask any," said Morton, a&#xD;
little amused. "I would not think of such a&#xD;
thing as meddling with Miss Tresham's afl'airB.&#xD;
But she seemed so much agitated.-"&#xD;
"Things agitate at one time, that would have&#xD;
no effect at another," said Miss Vernon, coolly.&#xD;
"I should probably be agitated if I was living&#xD;
in Russia and you suddenly appeared before me&#xD;
-though there is nothing at all agitating in see.&#xD;
ing you here, you know."&#xD;
"I understand. But Miss Ti~csham I am sure&#xD;
ca'ii have no reason for concealing.-"&#xD;
Miss Vernon interrupted him again, remorse.&#xD;
lessly.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham did not ask me to conceal any&#xD;
thing, Mr. Annesley; but I have learned by expe-&#xD;
rience that silence is golden, and speech is silver&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.                                                       YOU CANNOT LET ME HELP YOU?               101&#xD;
&#xD;
101&#xD;
&#xD;
-or base copper, rather, when it takes the form&#xD;
of silly tattling. I do as I would be done by.&#xD;
There are many reasons which might make me&#xD;
wish to conceal-that's a hateful word I-the&#xD;
visit of some embarrassing friend or relation,&#xD;
from people who had no right of espionage&#xD;
over my conduct, and so I am not quick to&#xD;
suspect other people for doing the same thing."&#xD;
"Thank you," said Morton, before he knew&#xD;
what he was about. Then he added, with a&#xD;
blush: "You don't know how much I admire&#xD;
and respect such sentiments.  rhere are not&#xD;
many women like you, Miss Vernon."&#xD;
"There are thousands much better," said&#xD;
Miss Vernon, with a sharpness that quite took&#xD;
him by surprise.&#xD;
While this conversation was going on, the&#xD;
cotillon ended, the last bows were made, and,&#xD;
as Mr. Langdon was leading Katharine away,&#xD;
Mr. Warwick came up to her.&#xD;
"Shall we go into the drawing-room and get&#xD;
an ice ?"the obliging Cousin Tom was saying,&#xD;
when he found himself summarily put aside.&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick [-I am so glad to see you,"&#xD;
Katharine cried; and Mr. Warwick 'looked at&#xD;
her companion, as he said: "I have a great&#xD;
many messages for you, from Bessie and the&#xD;
children. Do you care about hearing them?"&#xD;
"Of course I ~ answered she, warmly; and&#xD;
upon this, she withdrew her hand from Mr. Lang.&#xD;
don's arm, and took instead the one Mr. Warwick&#xD;
offered.&#xD;
"I will see you again, when the fourth set&#xD;
comes round," she said, with a smile, to the&#xD;
former gentleman, and in this way he found&#xD;
himself deserted, just as he had flattered him-&#xD;
self with the expectation of a pleasantly unin-&#xD;
terrupted ~ftc4tlte.&#xD;
"So Anncsdale and all its gayety has not&#xD;
made you forget Tallahoma and the school-&#xD;
room?" said Mr. Warwick, as they walked&#xD;
away. "I could hardly realize that you were&#xD;
yourself when I saw you dancing a little while&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"'If I am I, as I do think I be,' '~ said Kath-&#xD;
arine, with a laugh, "I have certainlynot for-&#xD;
gotten the school-room, or anybody connected&#xD;
with it, Mr. Warwick. How is Mrs. Marks, and&#xD;
how are the children ?-did Sara and Katy go&#xD;
to see their aunt ?-and has Nelly's cough given&#xD;
any more trouble?"&#xD;
"Bessie and all the children are well, and&#xD;
sent you m6re love than I could carry-Katy&#xD;
and Sara did not go to their aunt's, and Nelly's&#xD;
cough iS quite well, I believe."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Has nothing happened since I went away?&#xD;
I feel as ifa~r~tdeal ought to have happened."&#xD;
"I think e ~t~lng has gone on exactly as&#xD;
usual, excepting 1~t ~t ziiay conipliinent you to&#xD;
hear that you have be~u ~rery much missed by&#xD;
everybody. When Dick cut his hand the other&#xD;
day, he disgraced his manhood by crying because&#xD;
you were not there to bandage it up."&#xD;
"Has Dick cut his hand? I am so sorry.&#xD;
How did he do it?"&#xD;
"I was foolish enough to give him a box of&#xD;
tools as / a Christmas.gift, and the result was&#xD;
three accidents in the course of as many days.&#xD;
Katy was very ai~ious to come with me to.&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"I wish you could have brought her," said&#xD;
Katharine, sincerely.&#xD;
They bad left the ballroom by this time, and&#xD;
were in the drawing.room, which was thronged&#xD;
with people laughing, talking, eating ices, mak-&#xD;
ing picture-like groups everywhere.&#xD;
"Is there a quiet spot to be found any.&#xD;
where?" asked Mr. Warwick, looking round.&#xD;
"Twenty years ago, I might have liked this&#xD;
kind of thing; but now I find that I am very&#xD;
much out of my element. You know those mes-&#xD;
sages I told you about. Is there a quiet place in&#xD;
which I could deliver them?"&#xD;
"Suppose we try the library," said Kath-&#xD;
arine.&#xD;
They crossed the hall to the library, and&#xD;
found only one or two whist-parties in posses-&#xD;
sion of it. At the farther end, a sofa was fitted&#xD;
into a sort of alcove between two bookcases,&#xD;
and to this Katharine led the way. She sat&#xD;
down first, and looked up at her companion out&#xD;
of the soft gloom-her white dress and the&#xD;
blue flowers in her hair showing in bright re-&#xD;
lief against the dark background.&#xD;
"Will not this do?" said she, smiling; and&#xD;
somehow the little scene came back to John&#xD;
Warwick long afterward, touching him again as&#xD;
it touched h~m then.&#xD;
"Yes, it will do very well," he said, sitting&#xD;
down by her. Then he added, suddenly, "You&#xD;
are looking very badly. ilave you been sick?"&#xD;
"Not at all," answered she, growing a little&#xD;
paler. "I have been quito well, and enjoying&#xD;
myself very much. Do you know.thatyou have&#xD;
terribly keen eyes?" she added, trying to laugh,&#xD;
aud not succeeding very well. . -&#xD;
"I hope I 'have serviceable eyes,". he an.&#xD;
pitered ; "but it would not ~require very. keen&#xD;
ones to see that something is the matter with&#xD;
you. If you have not been sick, you have been&#xD;
&#xD;
worried-and that is worse. I may be blt~nder-&#xD;
tug in speaking of it," he went on, "and, if so,&#xD;
you must forgive me, but I was struck by the&#xD;
change in your appearance when I saw you&#xD;
dancing."&#xD;
"I have been sick all day," said Katharine,&#xD;
forgetting her contrary assertion of a moment&#xD;
back. "That is, I have had a headache and&#xD;
been in bed with it One does not look very&#xD;
well after a thing of that kind."&#xD;
"No," said Mr. Warwick, regarding her with&#xD;
a pair of eyes which, for the first time, she found&#xD;
uncomfortably penetrating. "If you have been&#xD;
in bed all day," he added, "I suppose you did&#xD;
not see a visitor, who called at lassie'ss this&#xD;
morning, and whom shedirected here?"&#xD;
Dim as the light was, he noticed-he could&#xD;
not avoid noticing-the crimson tide which in a&#xD;
moment spread over her face and neck.&#xD;
"Yes, I saw him," she answered; and, as&#xD;
she spoke, she gave a piteous, imploring glance,&#xD;
that reminded him of the look sometimes seen&#xD;
in an animal's eyes before the knife of the&#xD;
butcher descends and strikes home to the heart.&#xD;
Its unconscious pathos touched him; but the&#xD;
lawyer in his composition enabled him to perse-&#xD;
vere.&#xD;
"Bessie's curiosity was quite excited," he&#xD;
said. "You know it takes very little to excite&#xD;
her, and it seems that the gentleman-whom she&#xD;
described as young and handsome-asked many&#xD;
questions about you. That was enough to form&#xD;
the groundwork of a romance, which she has&#xD;
'building ever since. Her only fear is, that&#xD;
you may be induced to leave her, and that, she&#xD;
says, would break her heart."&#xD;
"Mrs. Marks is very good," etild Katharine,&#xD;
forcing a~smile. "But she, need not fear. I am&#xD;
not likely to go away. The gentleman who&#xD;
called to see me was "-a pause, and. w. great&#xD;
gulp of rage and self.contempt-" was. ~ ~ersen&#xD;
whom I knew in England."&#xD;
"So he said," remarked Mr. Warwick, rather&#xD;
dryly.&#xD;
"I hope he did not annoy Mrs. Marks in any&#xD;
way?" said Katharine, catching the intonation&#xD;
of his voice. "I-I do not think she is likely&#xD;
to see him again. He will leave Tallahoma in a&#xD;
few days-to-morrow, perhaps."&#xD;
"He did not annoy her at all," Mr. Warwick&#xD;
answered. "I hope I have not said any thing to&#xD;
make you think so."&#xD;
There was a pause after this. Katharine&#xD;
felt faint and sick, but she kept her seat.-.-what-&#xD;
ever he should say next, she must be ready to&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
answer. Mr. Warwick, meanwhile, said nothing&#xD;
-this face looked somewhat severe, as he gazed&#xD;
past her; but that was its'usual expression wheu&#xD;
at rest. In this lull, the voices of the whist-&#xD;
players sounded.&#xD;
"Three by cards, and two by honors, sets us&#xD;
five, and four before, is nine."&#xD;
"You should have returned my lead of&#xD;
spades, Mr. Barry, and we might have-"&#xD;
"If you had led out trumps, as you ought to&#xD;
have done," cried an excited voice from the other&#xD;
table, "they could not have made a trick. I&#xD;
held every high diamond, sir, and every one of&#xD;
them trumped U'&#xD;
"We threw away the game by that play of&#xD;
hearts, Mrs. Dargan. It gave them the lead, and&#xD;
then-"&#xD;
This was the kind of talk which came in and&#xD;
bridged over Katharine's suspense. It is aston-&#xD;
ishing how oddly conscious people are of such&#xD;
things at such times. When the last great&#xD;
struggle comes, and the soul is about to go&#xD;
forth, shall we, even then, hear and notice the&#xD;
bird that sings at our window, and the child&#xD;
who laughs in the street beloW?&#xD;
"Miss Tresham," said Mr. W~rwick, turning&#xD;
*       round abruptly, "do you remember the day we&#xD;
walked out to the pond, and I told you that some-&#xD;
thing was preying on your health and spirits?"&#xD;
"Yes," Katharine answered, "I remember&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"And do you also remember that I asked&#xD;
you if I could do any thing to relieve you?"&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Warwick, I remember that also-~&#xD;
very gratefully."&#xD;
"Well, I don't wish to force your confidence,&#xD;
but one glance at your face to-night told me that&#xD;
the anxiety which I saw then had made greater&#xD;
strides-had, in fact, been realized. As I told&#xD;
you before, if it is any thing relating to ideal&#xD;
troubles, I can do nothing for you; but if it is&#xD;
real-if it is practical-Miss Tresham, remember&#xD;
that I am both a man and a lawyer, and that~&#xD;
in either character, I am ready to serve you."&#xD;
"Mr.War$ick, you are very good-you are&#xD;
more than good," said Katharine, almost ready&#xD;
to give way to the childish relief of tears.&#xD;
"Don't-please don't think me ungrateful. I&#xD;
feel your kindness in my very heart, and-and&#xD;
thank you for it. But I cannot do anything&#xD;
else."&#xD;
"You cannot let me help you?"&#xD;
That ended the matter. After a minute, Mr.&#xD;
Warwick rose and offered his arm. "Your part-&#xD;
&#xD;
ners will be looking for you," he said. "I must&#xD;
not monopolize you so long. Have you any&#xD;
message for Bessie?"&#xD;
"My best love, and tell her I will see her to-&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
"What, are you coming back to Tallaho-&#xD;
ma?"&#xD;
"bTot to stay-I promised to rei~iain here&#xD;
until after New-Year-but ~n business. There&#xD;
is Mr. Talcott coming for me now."&#xD;
"I have been looking for you everywhere,&#xD;
Miss Tresham," said Mr. Talcott, quite breath-&#xD;
less. "The dancing began some time ago, and&#xD;
I am afraid we shall not get a place unless we&#xD;
make haste."&#xD;
"Don't let me detain you," said Mr. War-&#xD;
wick. "Good-night."&#xD;
"Shall I not see you again?"&#xD;
"No, I only looked in to be able to tqll Bessie&#xD;
how you are getting on. I am going 'back to&#xD;
town now."&#xD;
lIe was as good as his word, and Katharine&#xD;
had no further glimpse of him that night; but&#xD;
amid all the music and dancing, the gay voices&#xD;
and bright smiles, his voice sounded, and she&#xD;
heard again and again the words, "You cannot&#xD;
let me help you?" Her heart gave back an an~&#xD;
swer, for every now and then she caught herself&#xD;
murmuring, "If I only could 1-ab, if I only&#xD;
could!"&#xD;

AnOUT the time that Katharine threw herself&#xD;
down on the bed, and was foolish enough to cry&#xD;
until she made her head aebeBabette was tramp-&#xD;
ing along the road which led from Tallahoma to&#xD;
Morton House. She had been sent on an errand&#xD;
by her mistress, and was returning with two or&#xD;
three large parcels under her arm, dis4aint'ully&#xD;
regardless of the fact that she was the object of&#xD;
much attention and remark on the part of sev-&#xD;
eral em all boys in her rear. They ktiew better&#xD;
than to come within reach of her hand, of which&#xD;
more than one of them had felt the weight ;but,.&#xD;
taking care to keep at a respectful distance, they&#xD;
followed her beyond the corporate limits, In-&#xD;
deed, Bahette was a sufficiently remarkable ~gure&#xD;
to excite attention in a place much more used to&#xD;
'remarkable figures than quiet Tallahoma. Be~&#xD;

104                       MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
mounted a pair of sabots, and in them she went&#xD;
boldly clattering along, with her dress tucked&#xD;
up even shorter than the walking-skirt of a&#xD;
fashionable girl 9f the present day. "Good&#xD;
gracious, aunty,-where'd you get your shoes?"&#xD;
more than one audacious boy inquired; but&#xD;
aunty's short nose only went a little higher in&#xD;
the air, and her keen black eyes only gave a lit.&#xD;
tie quicker gleam by way of reply. Her fierce&#xD;
appearance quite awed the good folk of the vii.&#xD;
Iage. They had an idea that she was a sort of&#xD;
drager*eas, whom Mrs. Gordon bad imported fez&#xD;
special guard and defence. Poor Babette, whose&#xD;
temper was irascible, but who was really of an&#xD;
excellent disposition, and whose appearance only&#xD;
was against her, had no idea that when she&#xD;
walked into a shop, with her large gold ear-rings&#xD;
bobbing on each side of her swarthy, stern-look-&#xD;
ing face, the clerks fairly quaked, and would&#xD;
have given any thing to avoid the perilous duty&#xD;
of serving her.&#xD;
She was well served, however; and sbe had&#xD;
made her purchases and was finally on her way&#xD;
home-tramping along the narrow foot-path that&#xD;
ran by the side of the muddy road, close under&#xD;
the zigzag rail-fences, humming to herself in&#xD;
French a sort of jingling refrain, and now and&#xD;
then casting looks of defiance behind to see if&#xD;
any of her troublesome train were in sight.&#xD;
They had given up the pursuit, she found at&#xD;
last, and the gates of Morton House were al-&#xD;
most in sight when a man's figure appeared,&#xD;
advancing with quick strides along the foot-path&#xD;
toward her. Babette hardly noticed him, her&#xD;
head being full of other things, for she was mak-&#xD;
ing a rough calculation mentally of the money&#xD;
she had spent, and deciding that she had been&#xD;
cheated beyond that point where forbearance is&#xD;
said to be a virtue. It was all her mistress's&#xD;
fault, however. She had bidden her buy the&#xD;
things, and never mind about the price. "Eh&#xD;
bien) if people will be extravagant 3" Babette&#xD;
said to herself with a shrug. Meanwhile, the&#xD;
gentleman was thinking just as little of this&#xD;
strangely-clad figure clattering along the road to&#xD;
meet him. In fact, he did not notice her at all.&#xD;
He was thinking of other things, too, and gnaw-&#xD;
ing his u~ider lij~ as he had gnawed itin speaking&#xD;
of the snone~ a little while before. It would be&#xD;
hard to tell which of them was thrilled with the&#xD;
strangest shock of surprise when they came sud-&#xD;
denly face to face, and, looking up, recognized&#xD;
each other. 1" gasped Babette, and the par.&#xD;
"Mou Dieu&#xD;
eels absolutely rolled out of her arms into the&#xD;
&#xD;
* mud, as she stood helpless and aghast before&#xD;
* him.&#xD;
"What !-Babette!" cried the other, in as-&#xD;
tbnishment evidently as great and uncontrollable&#xD;
as her own. He put out his hand and grasped&#xD;
her arm, as if to make sure of the fact of her&#xD;
bodily presence. But Babette rudely pushed&#xD;
him away. Evidently she had no more desire&#xD;
than Katharine had mani~sted to salute him&#xD;
cordially.&#xD;
~' Keep your hands to yourself, Monsieur St.&#xD;
Jean," she exclaimed, sharply. "Mon Dien I-&#xD;
what are you doing here ?-as if madame, poor&#xD;
lady, has not suffered enough for you to leave&#xD;
her in peace"         -&#xD;
"So your mistress is here!" said he, quick-&#xD;
ly. "Good Heavens! how near I was to going&#xD;
away without knowing it! Where-where is&#xD;
she, Babette?"&#xD;
But the very question betrayed him. Ba-&#xD;
bette saw that this encounter had been acci-&#xD;
dental, and that whatever reason had brought&#xD;
him here, the presence of Mrs. Gordon had no&#xD;
share in it. "How near I was to going away&#xD;
without knowing it!" he had unwittingly said,&#xD;
and Babette's ears were quick. So were her wits&#xD;
for that matter, and in a moment her reply was&#xD;
ready. She had no time for cunning subterfuge&#xD;
or evasion. The plain road to mislead hint was&#xD;
in downright falsehood, and in downright false-&#xD;
hood she unhesitatingly took refuge.&#xD;
"Madame is not where you are likely to find&#xD;
her, M'sieu St. Jean," she said, with ill-simulated&#xD;
triumph. "Thanks to Ic boa Dieu, she is far&#xD;
enough away, and it is not I who is going to tell&#xD;
you where she is. Ma.foi! I would tell the devil&#xD;
sooner!" she added, bitterly.&#xD;
"You are telling a lie," said the gentleman,&#xD;
coolly, "and that is not what 1 expected of a&#xD;
good Catholic like you, Babette. I wonder what&#xD;
the priest will say to this when you go to confes-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
Babette's face fell for an instant; but xhe&#xD;
remembered what was at stake, plucked up&#xD;
courage, and answered boldly and volubly: "It&#xD;
is not for a scoffing heretic like you, l5'sieu St.&#xD;
Jean, to tell Christian people that they are liars.&#xD;
I say that madame is not here, nor anywhere&#xD;
that you are likely to find her. And I'll thank&#xD;
you," she went on, raising her voice, "to stand~&#xD;
out of the path and let me go on."&#xD;
"Where have you be~n, and where are you&#xD;
going, and with whom do you ljve, if your mis-&#xD;
tress is not here? "asked St. John, coolly keep-&#xD;
lug his position in front of her.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mon Dicul what business is It of yours?"&#xD;
demanded she, bursting kite One of the sudden&#xD;
furies to which the servants of Morton House&#xD;
were well accustomed. "I shall tell you nothing,"&#xD;
she continued, tremblingwith passion. "Madame&#xD;
is not here. I am staying with u~w arnie-I have&#xD;
been to town to make purchases. If you will not&#xD;
let me pass, I shall go round you."&#xD;
"Pass, by all meanS," said he, moving aside&#xD;
with a peculiar smile.&#xD;
She carefully gathered her parcels out of the&#xD;
mud, and, hugging them close in her arms,&#xD;
marched stolidly by him-grateful for, yet halt'&#xD;
incredulous of, this welcome release. She had&#xD;
not gone five paces before she heard his step be-&#xD;
hind, and knew that he was following her. In-&#xD;
stantly she faced round upon him, her black eyes&#xD;
gleaming, and her swarthy face all aglow.&#xD;
"Comment, M'sieu St. Jean!" she cried, in-&#xD;
dignantly. "You say I may pass, and, after I&#xD;
pass, you follow-you dog me! Call you this&#xD;
conduct of a gentleman?"&#xD;
"If you won't give me any information, Ba-&#xD;
bette, I must simply find it out," said he, laugh.&#xD;
ing at her anger. "You needn't excite yourself.&#xD;
I am only going with you to your friend's.&#xD;
There is no harm in that, I am sure."&#xD;
"My friend does not wish to see you," said&#xD;
Babette, almost out of her senses, with indigna-&#xD;
tion. "She would sprinkle holy water if you&#xD;
came in sight of the door.".&#xD;
"1 have no doubt of that," said he, still smil.&#xD;
ing so provokingly that she felt inclined to throw&#xD;
her muddy parcels in his face; "but still, I must&#xD;
accompany you."&#xD;
"Eh bien! then I shall not go," said she;&#xD;
and, to his great surprise, she wrapped her&#xD;
shawl around her more comfortably, and sat&#xD;
down deliberately on a large stone that lay in&#xD;
the fence corner. Once seated, she looked up at&#xD;
him triumphantly. "I can stay here as long as&#xD;
you can, M'sieu St. ~ she said, "and per-&#xD;
haps a little longer"&#xD;
For the first time sh~ had the best of the&#xD;
situation, and, for the first time also, St. John&#xD;
lost his temper.&#xD;
"Confound you!" he said, savagely. "Do&#xD;
you. suppose I am such a fool as not to know&#xD;
that your mistress is near at hand somewhere,&#xD;
and that you are lying like the father of lies him.&#xD;
self? Do you suppose I can't find out without&#xD;
any help from you? I have only to walk into&#xD;
the village yonder, and ask a few questions, to&#xD;
learn all that I want to know. I shall ask them,&#xD;
too; and you may tell your mistress, with my&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WARWICK'S NEW CLIENT.                  105&#xD;
&#xD;
compliments, that 1 shall do myself the honor&#xD;
of calling on her before the day is over.~~&#xD;
With this, he turned on his heel, and walked&#xD;
off toward the town. Babette eagerly watched&#xD;
him out of sight; she even followed him to a&#xD;
bend of the road, and saw his figure 'vanish in&#xD;
the distance, before she could.believe that he was&#xD;
really gone, and that he might not return and dog&#xD;
her steps. Then, as fast as the sabots would al-&#xD;
low, she hurried to the house, making no pause&#xD;
until she had burst in upon Mrs. Gordon with&#xD;
the news which she knew would be to her the&#xD;
most unwelcome that could be told.&#xD;
"Madame!', she cried, as the startled lady&#xD;
looked up from her cushions in astonishment;&#xD;
"madame 3-Ahi what a misfortune! It is ter-&#xD;
rible 1-it is enough to break one's heart," said&#xD;
the excitable Frenchwoman, almost sobbing;&#xD;
"but, as I~was coming back from town, madame,&#xD;
I met- out here - in the road - Monsieur St.&#xD;
Jean!"&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon, who had not done more than&#xD;
languidly cross the room for weeks, gave one&#xD;
cbnvulsive bound from the sofa, and stood erect&#xD;
on the fleer.&#xD;
"Babette!" she gasped. More than that she&#xD;
could not say.&#xD;
"Monsieur St. Jean!" repeated Babette, lift-&#xD;
ing her arm with a tragic gesture, as if she&#xD;
called upon Heaven to witness the truth of the&#xD;
fact she asserted. "'I met him in the road, ma-&#xD;
dame, not farther from the gate than you could&#xD;
throw a stone; and ah, mon Dien!" said she,&#xD;
shaking her head," what shall I have to suffer&#xD;
for all the lies I told!"&#xD;
"St. John!" said Mrs. Gordon; and she had&#xD;
hardly said it when she grew white as a sheet,&#xD;
and sat down suddenly. "Yonder 1-that phial&#xD;
on the table," she panted, brokenly, as Babette&#xD;
hurried to her. Well used as she was to these&#xD;
attacks, the maid was frightened-she had never&#xD;
before seen her mistress look like this; she had&#xD;
never known her face so ghastly, or her breath'so&#xD;
painfully short. The seves-lt~ of the paroxysm&#xD;
did not last more than a minute; but, when it&#xD;
was over, Mrs.' Gordon sank back on the sofa Ut-&#xD;
terly exhausted. "Wait..nwait a little," she&#xD;
said, when Babette began to speak, a~sd the lat-&#xD;
ter had discretion enough to hold her toilgue.&#xD;
She bathed her mistress's face for some time in&#xD;
silence, and it was not until Mrs. GQrdon opened&#xD;
her eyesand said, "Well, Dabette?" that sh~&#xD;
broke into a voluble history of her encounter,&#xD;
and of all that had been said on both sides. By&#xD;
the time she finished, she had worked herself Into&#xD;

&#xD;
MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
such a state of emotion, that she was fairly weep-&#xD;
ing and'wringing her hands.&#xD;
"Madame, let us go!" she exclaimed. "Let&#xD;
us not stay here. He will eome.-M'sieu will&#xD;
come - and he will take you and make you&#xD;
wretched. Madame, let us go !-Mon Dien! let&#xD;
us go!"&#xD;
"Soycs tranquille!" said Mrs. Gordon, faint-&#xD;
ly. ."We must bear what we must' bear, my poor&#xD;
Babette. But younecd not fear-he will not take&#xD;
us again.. Go and order the carriage."&#xD;
"To leave here, madame?"&#xD;
"No-only to drive me into town. Don't&#xD;
waste time, Babette.-g'o!"&#xD;
Babette went, 'and, when she returned, she&#xD;
found her mistress dressing with trembling haste.&#xD;
"My bonnet, ]3abette," she said; and, as Ba-&#xD;
bette ran to seek the bonnet, which had not&#xD;
been used since her mistress entered Morton'&#xD;
House, two months before, she could not help~&#xD;
wondering vaguely what this sudden movement~&#xD;
meant Whatever it was, Mrs. Gordon certainly&#xD;
looked more like herself than she had done in&#xD;
many a long day before. Her eyes were bright,&#xD;
her cheeks were flushed, and, as she tied the&#xD;
strings of her bonnet, and drew the long crape&#xD;
veil over her face, she, felt with a strange, wild&#xD;
thrill, that stagnation was over, and the breath&#xD;
of life and combat bad come to her again. It&#xD;
made another woman of her. It gave her&#xD;
strength, and will, and purpose, that no one&#xD;
would have dreamed of her possessing as she lay&#xD;
languidly on her sofa, and watched one dull day&#xD;
after another 'go by. Before she entered the&#xD;
carriage, she had all the windows put' up, and&#xD;
all the curtains put down. Then she bade the&#xD;
coachman drive to Mr. Warwick's office in Talla-&#xD;
homa.&#xD;
To Mr. Warwick's office in Tallah~ma the&#xD;
lumbering old carriage ae~ordingly proceeded,&#xD;
rousing a good deal of interest in the quiet&#xD;
streets of the little village, and startling a group&#xD;
of loungers who were sinking their pipes in the&#xD;
bright sunshine outside Mr. Warwick's door.&#xD;
The lawyer himself was not of the number. A&#xD;
man had called on business, and he had taken&#xD;
him into the office about ten minutes before the&#xD;
carriage appeared. His astonishment, therefore,&#xD;
waS great when two or three men came tumbling&#xD;
into his door without any warning, and all at&#xD;
once, "'Warwick, here's the Morton carriage!"&#xD;
they 'cricd, excitedly. "What the deuce does it&#xD;
mean 1' Can ~frs.-Mrs. Gordon be coining here&#xD;
to see&#xD;
'~ The Morton carriage!" repeated Mr. War-&#xD;
&#xD;
wick, startled, despite himself. "I don't know,&#xD;
I have no idea what it means," he added.&#xD;
"Are you sure it is coming here?"&#xD;
Before the others could reply, the carriage&#xD;
drew up before the~ curb-stone; and, the next&#xD;
moment, a half-grown negro boy apjearcd at the&#xD;
office door, cap in hand.&#xD;
"Mr. Warruck, mistiss says she would like fur&#xD;
to see you on pa'tic'lar business, sir, if you is at&#xD;
leisure. If you ain't, she say she will come back&#xD;
when you is."&#xD;
"Where is your mistress?" asked Mr. War-&#xD;
wick.&#xD;
"ln the carriage, sir."&#xD;
"Tell her I will be there in a minute." He&#xD;
turned to his client, who was listening with open&#xD;
eyes and mouth. "Mr. Sloan, I am sure you will&#xD;
excuse me for deferring this business at present.&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon has come in from the country, and I&#xD;
can't put her oil'. Just leave the deed, and I will&#xD;
look over it, and you can call to-morrow."&#xD;
Mr. Sloan was burning with curiosity, but the&#xD;
lawyer's quiet manner left him no room for ap-&#xD;
peal. He put down the deed, and made his exit,&#xD;
followed by the smokers. "Warwick won't want&#xD;
'us, either," they said, and filed off without wait-&#xD;
ing for a hint to that effect.. No sooner was the&#xD;
coast clear, than Mr. Warwick; who certainly&#xD;
would not have hesitated to say that he did' not&#xD;
want them, went out to the carriage and opened&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"How are you, Mrs. Gordon?" he said, cour-&#xD;
teously, shaking hands with the black-draped and&#xD;
closely-veiled figure inside. "I am quite at leis-&#xD;
ure to attend to your commands. Will you come&#xD;
into my office, and let me hear what I can do for&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"Arc they all gone?" inquired Mrs. Gordon,&#xD;
who had taken an observation through the car-&#xD;
riage-window. "I wish to see you alone."&#xD;
"They arc all gone," he answered, extend-&#xD;
ing his hand again, to assist her from the car-&#xD;
riage.&#xD;
She descended rather feebly, as he observed,&#xD;
and, feeling the worse for her unusual 'exertion,&#xD;
leaned heavily on his arm as they crossed the&#xD;
pavement. When he caught a glimpse of her&#xD;
face, as she put her veil partially aside on enter-&#xD;
ing the office, it looked so pale, that he was&#xD;
afraid she might be about to 'faint. He placed&#xD;
her in a chair beside the fire, closed the door,&#xD;
and went hastily to a side-table, where he poured&#xD;
out a glass of water, and brought it to her.&#xD;
"Will you let me suggest that you ar~ too much'&#xD;
mu~ffied up about the face?" he said.' "Permit&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WARWICK'S NEW CLIENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
and he drew the masses of crape back, as&#xD;
she put the water to' her lips .for a moment.&#xD;
Seeing her countenance thus more distinctly, he&#xD;
was' shocked by its appearance, and confirmed&#xD;
in his'drcad of a fainting-fit. He pulled asmall&#xD;
table that was close by, to her elbow, and set the&#xD;
glass of water, which she now gave back to him,&#xD;
upon it. Then he crossed the room to one of sev-&#xD;
eral walnut bookcases that were ranged around&#xD;
the walls, opened a door that revealed to sight&#xD;
three shelves full of respectable-looking volumes&#xD;
bound in calf, while the fourth, and lowest,&#xD;
seemed to be doing duty as a sideboard. From&#xD;
among two or three decanters he selected one,&#xD;
also a wineglass, and returned to Mrs. Gordon's&#xD;
side.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You look very pale, very ill, I may say," he&#xD;
remarked; "drink this wine. It will do you&#xD;
more good than water."&#xD;
"Thank you," she said, taking the wineglass&#xD;
which he had just filled. "You are very kind.&#xD;
Yes, I believe I need it."&#xD;
She drank part of the wine, put the glass on&#xD;
the table, and turned to him. "Sit down," she&#xD;
said, with a slight motion of her hand toward&#xD;
a seat opposite. "I shall not faint, and I have a&#xD;
great deal to say to you."&#xD;
It was some time before she spoke~ Whether&#xD;
it was the memory of the past-of the different&#xD;
manner in which they two had once known each~&#xD;
other-or whether it was merely the all-absorbing&#xD;
thought of the threatening present, something&#xD;
overpowered her, and it was some time before&#xD;
she could collect herself sufficiently to break&#xD;
the silence. At last, with an e~fort, the' fir~t&#xD;
words came.&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick, for a reason that I will tell&#xD;
you presently, I stand in need of the advice of a&#xD;
lawyer. I have come to apply to you for that&#xD;
advice. But, even more than I need a lawyer, I&#xD;
need a friend, and the service that 'only a friend&#xD;
can render me. I venture, therefore-you may&#xD;
think without any claim-to ask if you remein-&#xD;
her the old time sufficiently to care to render me&#xD;
this service?" -&#xD;
"Mrs.' Gordon must surely have forgotten&#xD;
that she was once Pauline Morton, before she&#xD;
could ask me such a question," said the lawyer,&#xD;
flushing slightly. "There are hereditary claims&#xD;
of friendship between us," he went on, ha'stiiy,&#xD;
~as he saw an answering flush rise to the pale face&#xD;
opposite him, "and there is, moreover, a particu-&#xD;
lar claim. When I was a' struggling boy, your&#xD;
father aided me in a manner 'I can never forget.&#xD;
What I am to-day, I owe to his generous kind-&#xD;
&#xD;
107&#xD;
&#xD;
ness. I will gladly do any thing in my power to&#xD;
serVe his daughter."&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon understood, as not many pea-&#xD;
pie would have done, the delicacy which made&#xD;
him speak thus-which made him allude not&#xD;
to herself, but to her father. Understanding it,&#xD;
she appreciated what she had only felt before,&#xD;
that thisman could indeed be trusted, and that&#xD;
he spoke truly when he said that he would do&#xD;
"any thing" to serve her. Instinctively she&#xD;
held out her hand.&#xD;
"Thank you," she said. "I felt sure that I&#xD;
might rely on you; but I am glad to hear you&#xD;
say that you will help me. .Ah, it is~ a terrible&#xD;
thing to be a woman," said she, looking at him&#xD;
with pathetic eyes. "If I were like you, I should&#xD;
not need help."&#xD;
"We all need it in some form or other," an.&#xD;
swered he. "None of us are so strong as to&#xD;
stand quite alone.??&#xD;
"But it is only a woman who is entirely at&#xD;
the mercy of another; who may be crushed in a&#xD;
hundred different ways-each more cruel, 'more&#xD;
bitter than death. Mr. Warwick, tell me-what&#xD;
power, short of murder, does not the law give a&#xD;
man over his wife?"&#xD;
"It gives him a great deal," said Mr. War.&#xD;
wick, regarding her keenly, and reading the ex-&#xD;
citement written on her face. "But what inter-&#xD;
est has this subject to you? A widow-"&#xD;
He was stopped by a gesture from her. Sud-&#xD;
denly she extended her hand, and taking up the&#xD;
wine, drank it off. Then she put down the glass&#xD;
with a ringIng 'sound, and, leaning forward, looked&#xD;
steadily into his eyes.&#xD;
"God forgive me!" she said-" God forgive&#xD;
me that I am forced to say it, but He has not&#xD;
been kind enough to set me free. The first thing&#xD;
1 have to tell you is that I am no widow. My&#xD;
husband "-the word nearly choked her-" is liv-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick started, but the surprise was&#xD;
not nearly so much of a surprise as might per-&#xD;
haps be imagined. He had suspected some-&#xD;
thing like this before. It is hard to tell what&#xD;
slight circumstances first sowed the seeds of sus-&#xD;
picion in his mind, but he had long felt an in-&#xD;
stinct that Mrs. Gordon's seclusion and impene-&#xD;
trable ; reticence were not characteristic of a&#xD;
widow, but o( a woman who had still some-&#xD;
thing to' fear, something to hide from.' Then,&#xD;
no one knew the business of the Morton. estate&#xD;
as he did, and he had not faile4to make hisown&#xD;
comments on the fact that, in taking possession&#xD;
of this estate, Mrs. Gordon had absolutely re-&#xD;

108                       MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
109&#xD;
&#xD;
*         fused to go through any of the usi~al legal forms.&#xD;
There was no one to contest her claim, she said,&#xD;
and so she quietly assumed her right of control&#xD;
without any sanction from the law. Over this&#xD;
obstinacy, Mr. Shields shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"It's a woman's notion of doing business, Mr.&#xD;
Warwick," he said. l3ut Mr. Warwick himself&#xD;
was of a 'different mind, lie suspected how it&#xD;
was; though the suspicion scarcely took definite&#xD;
form in his brain. He had other and more im.&#xD;
portent things than Mrs. Gordon's private affairs&#xD;
to consider; and notwithstanding the boyish&#xD;
sei~timent for which his sister still gave him&#xD;
credit, Mrs. Gordon herself was no more to him&#xD;
than any old friend~ liked sincerely-liked with a&#xD;
certain tenderness, perhaps, on account' of the&#xD;
past-but making no part of his daily life. And&#xD;
so it was, that he felt very lit1~le surprise when&#xD;
she told him that she was not a widow-that&#xD;
her husband was living.&#xD;
"Do not blame me more than you can help,"&#xD;
she went on, a~ he did not speak, "Do you re-&#xD;
member how proud 1 used to be in the old&#xD;
time? Well, that pride has not quite been&#xD;
crushed out of me. I could not bear to come&#xD;
back here and tell these people what hitter ship-&#xD;
wreck had overtaken me I I could not bear to&#xD;
spread before them the history of-of such n life&#xD;
as mine I"&#xD;
"Why did you come back at all?" said he&#xD;
hardly knowing what else to say.&#xD;
"' Because it was a place of refuge-and I&#xD;
had no other. Because it was the one place in&#xD;
the world where he was ' least likely to come-&#xD;
least likely to' think of searching for me. When&#xD;
the last awful blow fell," said she, growing fear-&#xD;
fully white, "I looked round despairingly and&#xD;
wondered where I could go. Then, like a relief&#xD;
from Heaven came the thought of my father's&#xD;
house. Here I could be safe, here I would be&#xD;
untroubled, here I might live and die unmolested&#xD;
by him. But I have only been at peace a little&#xD;
while. To-day Babette met an agent whom he&#xD;
ha~ sent in search of me."&#xD;
"An agefit?"&#xD;
"An unscrupulous tool, whom he retains for&#xD;
uses of this kind, named St. John. As soon as&#xD;
he conveys the information of my whereabouts,&#xD;
that man-my husband-will come here. It is&#xD;
not sue lie wauts,~t Is ~'elix-but if he takes the&#xD;
child, ho must take me too. What I wish to&#xD;
sak you "ia this "-she rose, and stood before&#xD;
him, with an eager yearning in her eyes-" can&#xD;
hWtake ~lslm from ~ne? Does the law give him&#xD;
that powe~-.-here?"&#xD;
&#xD;
The lawyer's heart was touched with pity for&#xD;
her; but truth was uncompromising, and must&#xD;
be told. "If he can prove that he is his father,&#xD;
it gives him that power anywhere."&#xD;
The woman-the helpless creature to whom&#xD;
the law gave no power-sank down again into&#xD;
her chair, and covered her face with her hands.&#xD;
When she looked up at last, that face was tense&#xD;
and bloodless.&#xD;
"Then I must ask that service of which I&#xD;
spoke a short time ago," she said. "Will you&#xD;
take my poor boy, and put him somewhere-&#xD;
away from me-where he will be in safety, and&#xD;
-and cannotbe found?"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick started, and, for a moment,&#xD;
looked more than surprised-in fact, he looked&#xD;
almost aghast. Here was a proposition indeed 1&#xD;
that a lawyer who respected the law as the most&#xD;
sacred of earthly obligations, should be instru.&#xD;
mental in ei'ading it I-that a man who was full&#xD;
of the dominative opinions of his sex, should&#xD;
lend his aid to a scheme that removed a child&#xD;
from the just control of its father! Pauline&#xD;
Morton certainly stretched the cord of ancient&#xD;
friendship to its utmost tension, when she made&#xD;
such a demand of him.&#xD;
"Mrs. Gordon," he said, gravely, "I would&#xD;
do' any thing to serve you-any thing that was&#xD;
right; but I am not sure this wonldbe right. A&#xD;
father always has a paramountelaim to his child."&#xD;
Instantly all the woman in her blazed out upon&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"A paramount claim, given by whom?" she&#xD;
demanded. "It is you men that make the laws&#xD;
that grind poor women to the earth-not God,&#xD;
not religion, not any thing that should be re-&#xD;
spected 1 It is you who tear the very hearts out&#xD;
of our breasts, and then talk of right and power&#xD;
to do so. Yes, you have a right-the right of&#xD;
the strong to trample the weak! You have a&#xD;
power-the power of the master over the slave!&#xD;
God knows there is no other. But I might have&#xD;
been sure a man would never help me against&#xD;
a man. Therefore, I shall do what must be&#xD;
done, myself-and only ask, you not to betray&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Stop, Mrs. Gordon," he said, as she rose&#xD;
and moved toward the door. "Stop a moment,"&#xD;
he added, following her. "You must not leave&#xD;
me like this. Remember that I have not re-&#xD;
fused to help you. I stated a general fact when~&#xD;
I said that a father has a paramount claim to&#xD;
his child. It is certainly true, as a general 'fact;&#xD;
but in particular cases, that claim is sometimes&#xD;
forfeited. If I am to serve you, I must do so&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WARWICK'S NEW CLIENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
with my eyes open-I must know whether the&#xD;
claim has been forfeited in this instance."&#xD;
"I think I can convince you of that," said&#xD;
she, faintly, as she sat down again. "I am not&#xD;
strong enough for such violent emotion," she&#xD;
went on, panting slightly. "Wait-wait a lit-&#xD;
tle, and I will tell you alL"&#xD;
"Take your time," he said, kindly.&#xD;
"If I do that, I should never speak at all,"&#xD;
she answered, hurriedly. "I must do it at once.&#xD;
You heard of my marriage some fifteen years&#xD;
ago, did you not?"&#xD;
"We heard of it vaguely. You kept up no&#xD;
communication with Lagrange, you know."&#xD;
"I married a Captain Fraser, an English&#xD;
officer," she went on, apparently unheeding his&#xD;
reply. "I was very much in love with him,"&#xD;
she said, with a trembling, scornful smile; "and&#xD;
he-well, he seemed to be in love with me. I was&#xD;
beautiful then, you know, and I had been very&#xD;
much 'admired. He was highly connected, and&#xD;
he was very handsome-I honestly believe that&#xD;
those were the only reasons I had for liking&#xD;
him. I thought myself able to judge of char-&#xD;
acter, and rank and good looks dazzled me, as&#xD;
they might have dazzled any village school-girl.&#xD;
WellI married himand I cannot tell you of the&#xD;
life ,I led afterward. Look at my face. Every&#xD;
hour of it is written there! Captain Fraser left&#xD;
'the army, and we lived on the Continent-there&#xD;
is not a city of Europe that is not full of bitter&#xD;
memories to me. After my mother died, the life&#xD;
'grew worse. My husband was dissipated, and&#xD;
recklessly extravagant. My poor brother"'-~her&#xD;
voice almost choked' her-" helped me as much&#xD;
'as he could. It was my demands that went to&#xD;
impoverish the estate, and-and I hear that he&#xD;
has all the blame of it. As time went on, and&#xD;
'matters grew worse, I would have separated from&#xD;
my husband, if it had not been for Felix, He,&#xD;
who was my youngest child, alone lived, and I&#xD;
could not leave him. It would hare been bet-&#xD;
ter, perhaps, if I had done so, for "-she stopped&#xD;
here, and something like a ghastly horror came&#xD;
over her face-" for as matters grew no better,&#xD;
as ill-usage increased, my brother at last lost&#xD;
patience. He met us at Baden, where Fraser&#xD;
was at his worst, and-and there was a violent&#xD;
quarrel. I don't know how it ~was -.- I have&#xD;
never heard any particulars-but he-my broth.&#xD;
er-was killed by that man whom the law calls&#xD;
my husband!"&#xD;
Almost ~neonsciously, Mr. Warwick uttered&#xD;
~an exclamation of horror, but white as was her&#xD;
'face, parched as were her lips, she hurried on:&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
"The next day I was half mad, and I did not&#xD;
know where to turn; but on one thing I was do-&#xD;
termined-that was, never to see him again. He&#xD;
and this St. John had been obliged to leave Ba-&#xD;
den, but he sent me word to go to Scotland,&#xD;
where we had been living for some two or three&#xD;
years-I forgot to~ say that an uncle ha4 died,&#xD;
and left him a large estate, with the condition&#xD;
that he assumed the name of Gordon. Instead&#xD;
of going to Scotland, I came to America. He&#xD;
knows how I always hated the country, and I&#xD;
was sure he would never look for me here-be-&#xD;
sides he had hardly more than the vaguest idea&#xD;
of where Morton House was situated. 1 relied on&#xD;
all this, and I thought I might liveisere, and-&#xD;
and train Felix to be a gentleman. But you see&#xD;
how it has ended I I might have known I could&#xD;
not defy the cunning of these two. It is Felix&#xD;
they want-not me! If they take him, it will be&#xD;
to make him what they are themselves. And&#xD;
sooner than see him that," she cried out, pas-&#xD;
sionately," I could find the strength to kill him&#xD;
with my own hands!"&#xD;
Without a word, Warwick rose from his&#xD;
seat, and took two or three turns' up and down&#xD;
the room-then suddenly came back and stood&#xD;
before her, looking at her worn, haggard face.&#xD;
"My God 1" he said, "what you must have en-&#xD;
dured I And you went away from us for this?"&#xD;
"Yes, for this. Don't-don't speak of the&#xD;
old time. I cannot bear it now," she cried out,&#xD;
suddenly. not speak of' , answer&#xD;
"No, I will           ~   he&#xD;
kindly. "I was only thinking-it seems' hard&#xD;
that mistakes should sometimes be punished&#xD;
as bitterly as sins. Well, you were, right. I&#xD;
will help you to thc very utmost-of my power&#xD;
As long as I can prevent it, the man of whom&#xD;
you speak shall never obtain possession of, your&#xD;
son."&#xD;
"But the law-&#xD;
"Such a man as the one you describe Is slot;&#xD;
likely to have recourse to the law, in the fls!#&#xD;
place-especially in a foreign land. But, If be&#xD;
did, the law could only assign the child to him4&#xD;
it could not find him for him. Get Felix ready&#xD;
for a journey, and I will arrange my plans; mean~&#xD;
while, and will communiq~t~with you to-morrow&#xD;
at latest. Do not ~e surprl~&amp;amp;I or unprepared if&#xD;
I call for the child ~tq~ very early hour. in thu&#xD;

"Yes, yes-there isjreat need of hastn-4m-&#xD;

"This St. John cannot himself molest you?1&#xD;
"Not unless he were to entice Felix away&#xD;
The ~hildwas always veryfond oisn-.--hemigh&#xD;

her eyes. "1 must return at o~ice to Mortoi&#xD;
House. He told J3abette that he was comiul&#xD;
there. Good Heavens! I don't know wha'&#xD;
may happen while I am away."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick did not attempt to detain her&#xD;
He saw that it would be cruel to do so. Hei&#xD;
fears were causeless, for Babette was fully aliv&#xD;
to the danger, and St. John could sooner have&#xD;
snatched Felix from the den of a lion than fron~&#xD;
Morton House, guarded by her, and garrisoned&#xD;
by a troop of servants; but all the same it would&#xD;
have been useless to reason with, and still more&#xD;
useless to detain, a woman whose nerves were&#xD;
strung to the pitch which Mrs. Gordon's now&#xD;
Were. He saw this, and opened the office-door.&#xD;
"I will see you tomorroww" he said, and, as he&#xD;
said it, she uttered a sudden, half-stifled cry, and&#xD;
eaught'his arm-&#xD;
"There I - there!" she gasped, shrinking&#xD;
back into the room, and pointing eagerly across&#xD;
the street.&#xD;
His eyes followed the motion of her hand, and&#xD;
he saw a slender, well-dressed man sauntering&#xD;
alone. "That is the man?" he asked, though&#xD;
the tiyestion was almost unnecessary.&#xD;
"It is St. John!" cried his companion, with&#xD;
a wild burst of tears. "It is'the wretch whom I&#xD;
have not seen since-since-"&#xD;
He put her gently into a chair, and said in a&#xD;
quiet voice, the very tones of which were reassur-&#xD;
ing, "Trust to me, and try and compose your.&#xD;
self. If you allow yourself to become unnerved&#xD;
Ia this manner, you will put yourself entirely at&#xD;
the mercy of this man, if, by any accident, he&#xD;
succeeds in gaining admittance to your presence.&#xD;
And the child-you must th~nk of him. For&#xD;
his sake, endeavor to control yourself."&#xD;
Without waiting for a reply, he turned and&#xD;
walked to the window, and followed Mr. St.&#xD;
Jolstt's retreating figure with his eyes, as far&#xD;
as it could be seen. It was a good thing that&#xD;
Mr. St. ~Tohu was thinking deeply; or that keen&#xD;
glance might have made itself felt -not com-&#xD;
fortably. Few men iike to be scrutinized in&#xD;
that seam~ching faslil~n and this man especially&#xD;
had good reason for avoiding it. When he&#xD;
finally turned a cOrner, and was out of sight,&#xD;
Mr. Warwick went back to his companion.&#xD;
"He is gone," he said, gently. "Let me put&#xD;
you into the carriage now, Mrs. Gordon."&#xD;
She extended her hand silently, and he con.&#xD;
&#xD;
' ducted her out. After she was in the carriage,&#xD;
an4i the door had been closed, she leaned forward&#xD;
t and spoke. "God bless you I" she said. That&#xD;
was all; but the words, and the sound of the&#xD;
r rich, sweet voice that had spoken them, lingered&#xD;
with him long after he went back into his office,&#xD;
and sat down to Mr. Sloan's deed.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
MISS TRESHAM KEEPS HER WORD.&#xD;
THE morning after the ball at Annesdale,&#xD;
Katharine was one of the few people who came&#xD;
down-stairs at the usual hour. Most of the&#xD;
ladies kept their chambers, and the gentlemen&#xD;
dropped into the breakfast-room at irregular in.&#xD;
tervals, looking the worse for their night's&#xD;
amusement. Miss Tresham received many corn-&#xD;
pliments on her matutinal habits-all of which&#xD;
she answered by a faint smile. "1 don't de-&#xD;
serve any credit for my energy," she said. "I&#xD;
should have liked very much to sleep longer, and&#xD;
probably would have done so, if 1 had ifot been&#xD;
obliged to go to Tallahoma this morning."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley was sitting at another table&#xD;
and talking to quite another set of people; but&#xD;
she caught the last words and turned round.&#xD;
"Did I hear you say something about Talla-&#xD;
homa, Miss Tresham? I hope you are not in-&#xD;
tending to desert us?"&#xD;
"Not unless. you prohibit my return," an-&#xD;
swered Katharine, smiling. "I was only talking&#xD;
of going into ,town for a while this morning.-.-on&#xD;
business," she added, as she saw a slight expres-&#xD;
sion of surprise on Mrs. Annesley's face.&#xD;
"Hear! hear!" cried Mr. Langdon, laughing.&#xD;
"'On business '-that is, to buy six yards of rib-&#xD;
bon, or a pair of gloves. Howgrandly you ladies&#xD;
talk!"&#xD;
"To buy something much more important&#xD;
than many yards of ribbon, or many pairs of&#xD;
gloves~" answered Miss Tresham, gravel~i. Then&#xD;
she turned to Mrs. Annesley, and asked if she&#xD;
could send her into town.&#xD;
"Certainly. The carriage is it your service,"&#xD;
her hostess replied. "At what hour shall I order&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"Immediately after breakfast, if~you please," -&#xD;
Katharine answered.&#xD;
immediately after breakfast, Miss Tresharn&#xD;
went up-stairs, and put on her bonnet and cloak.&#xD;
Wh 1 she came down, the carriage was standing&#xD;
before the door, and, while she was con~ratulat.&#xD;
&#xD;
ln~ herself ou her escape from eompanionshii&#xD;
and questioning, lo I from the drawing-room&#xD;
sallied forth Mrs. French arrayed in full out-doo~&#xD;
costume.&#xD;
"You don't object to taking me along, dr&#xD;
you, Miss Tresham?" she asked, with a smilk&#xD;
that Katharine could not help thinking had th&#xD;
least possible tinge of malicious enjoyment in it,&#xD;
"Mamma wants me to go to the Andersons, and&#xD;
they live on the other side of Ttdlahoma. I can&#xD;
drop yvu in the village, and call for you as I re-&#xD;
turn, if you say so."&#xD;
Katharine said so with the best grace she&#xD;
could summon, and in this way found herself&#xD;
fairly hooked to make the best or worst of&#xD;
Mrs. French during a five-miles' drive. For a&#xD;
while, the latter spared her any conversational&#xD;
exertion-being full of the important subject of&#xD;
the ball, on which her tongue ran as glibly as&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
"Was it pleasant, Miss Tresham ?-did you&#xD;
really enjoy yourself?~' she asked. "Did other&#xD;
people seem to be enjoying themselves? Of&#xD;
course everybody told me that it was delightful;&#xD;
but 1 have said such things dozens of times,&#xD;
when in fact I had been nearly bored to death.&#xD;
After one has told stories of that kind one's self;&#xD;
one isn't apt to believe other people, you know.&#xD;
I am so glad you think every thing went oil'&#xD;
nicely. Our ball has become quite the Christ-&#xD;
mas event in Lagrange, and I always like it to&#xD;
be nice. It often strikes me that it is a very&#xD;
daring thing to bring a hundred or so people to-&#xD;
gether, and leave them to umuse themselves-for&#xD;
that is what a ball really tomes to, you know."&#xD;
"Indeed I don't know," said Katharine,&#xD;
smiling. "On the contrary, I think it Is on&#xD;
the hostess that the success or failure of a ball&#xD;
principally rests. You must not try to shirk&#xD;
the success of yours, Mrs. French."&#xD;
"Oh, it was mamma who played hostess,"&#xD;
said Mrs. French, with a shrug. "I took no&#xD;
more responsibility of that sort than any of the&#xD;
guests. When I come home, I tried to forget&#xD;
that I am married; and I generally succeed in&#xD;
enjoying myself quite as much as if I was a girl&#xD;
with a dozen or so of admirers. By-the-by, we&#xD;
were talking over the ball this morning, and&#xD;
there was quite a discussion going on as to&#xD;
who was the-belle of it. Tell me who you think&#xD;
is best entitled to that distinction."&#xD;
"That is bard to say,?? answered Katharine,&#xD;
trying to keep her wandering thoughts to the&#xD;
sul4eet in question. "Everybody has a different&#xD;
opinion as to who was the belle of the ball. I&#xD;
&#xD;
think Miss Vernon was the most beautiful woman&#xD;
present; but whether other people thought so,&#xD;
or whether that constitutes bellehood, I really&#xD;
don't know."&#xD;
"I should say that the woman who was&#xD;
most sought and admired was the belle," said&#xD;
Mrs. French, decidedly. "You were very much&#xD;
admired, Miss Tresham," she went on, with sur-&#xD;
prising candor. "Any. number of people asked&#xD;
me who you were, and said you danced so grace.&#xD;
fully. I suppose you learned to dance in Europe&#xD;
-in Paris, perhaps."&#xD;
"Indeed, no," said Katharine, smiling and&#xD;
sighing both at once. "I never was in Paris.&#xD;
I learned to dance at home-in the West Indies&#xD;
-where everybody loves it so."&#xD;
"But you are English."&#xD;
"I am West Indian," said Katharine, flush-&#xD;
ing a little. "Please don't call me English, for&#xD;
I am no more English than you arc. Your&#xD;
grandparents, or great-grandparents, probably&#xD;
came from England, and so did mine-that is&#xD;
all."&#xD;
In this strain, the conversation went on until&#xD;
Tallahoma was in sight, and Katharine, instead&#xD;
of being fresh and ready for what was before&#xD;
her, felt already wearied and downcast.&#xD;
"Where shall I tell John to stop, Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am?" asked Mrs. French, with her hand on the&#xD;
check.string, as they entered the town.&#xD;
"At-" Katharine stopped a moment. She&#xD;
was about to say "Mrs. Marks," but a timely&#xD;
recollection of the lateness of the hour, and of&#xD;
the many detentions that would await her there,&#xD;
came over her.' It was imperative that she&#xD;
should see Mr. Marks at once, and that the&#xD;
business which brought her to Tallahoma should&#xD;
be transacted without loss of time; so she fin-&#xD;
ished her sentence by saying-" the bank."&#xD;
"The bank, John," said Mrs. French, with&#xD;
a little arch of her eyebrows. Then she added,&#xD;
laughingly, "I must tell Mr. Laugdon that your&#xD;
business in Tallaboma really was business.. One&#xD;
doesn't go to a bank to buy ribbons and gloves."&#xD;
"I am going to see Mr. Marks about say sal-&#xD;
ary," said Katharine, more annoyed by this re-&#xD;
mark than was strictly reasonable, and thinking&#xD;
she would put an end to any and all conjectures&#xD;
concerning her business.&#xD;
"My dear Miss ~resham," said Mrs. French,&#xD;
a little shocked, "I hope you don't think that I&#xD;
meant any thing-that I was so impertinent as&#xD;
to be curious about your affairs. I really beg&#xD;
your pardon, if I said any thing to make you&#xD;
think so."&#xD;

&#xD;
"You did not say any thing," answered Katl&#xD;
anne. "I ought to beg your pardon for mention&#xD;
ing them~-only one certainly does not go to&#xD;
bank to buy ribbons and gloves."&#xD;
"This is the place now," said Mrs Preneli&#xD;
looking out. "Shall I call for you here, Mis&#xD;
Tresham V"&#xD;
"At Mrs. Marks's, if you please," said Kath&#xD;
anne, as the footman opened the door, and sh&#xD;
descended to the sidewalk. "I shall be bad&#xD;
in about two hours," was the last thing sh~&#xD;
heard Mrs. Preach say, as the carriage drov~&#xD;
ofl~&#xD;
Watching it out of sight, the girl said&#xD;
Thank heaven I" with fervor, then turned~&#xD;
and, opening a gate just before her, went up&#xD;
short walk bordered with green box, to the dooi&#xD;
of a somewhat gloomy-looking brick house. 5h&#xD;
knew the place well, for, during her first year of&#xD;
residence with the Marks family, they had lived&#xD;
here; and it was only because the children were&#xD;
growing large, and the house, with the bank&#xD;
apartments *deducted, was uncomfortably small,&#xD;
that they' had removed to the outskirts of the&#xD;
village. Nobody was more glad of the change&#xD;
than Katharine; but still, her local attachments&#xD;
were strong, and she gave a kind smile round&#xD;
the yard, with every nook and corner of which&#xD;
ehe had been familiar. She even stopped mo-&#xD;
ment to examine a rose-bush, that was clambering&#xD;
over the porch, before she went in. The passage&#xD;
which she entered looked dark and cheerless, but,&#xD;
on a door to the right, theword "Bank" was con-&#xD;
spicuously lettered; and, as this door was ajar,&#xD;
a large, well-lighted room, with a counter run-&#xD;
ning across it, was visible. Here all was well-&#xD;
knowmi ground; so Katharine walked in without&#xD;
any hesitation. Two gentlemen were standing&#xD;
at a ibeplace behind the counter, and they both&#xD;
turned as she entered. One was Mr. Nfarks, the&#xD;
other Mr. Warwick. A young man was busy&#xD;
with accounts at the other end of the apart-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"Why, ~[iss Kate, is it possible 1" said the&#xD;
cashier, meeting her in his hearty way. He&#xD;
sl~ook hands, and seemed so' glad to see her,&#xD;
that ~athanine, who was thoroughly unnerved,&#xD;
felt half-inclined to cry. It is astonislii~ig how&#xD;
every emotion with a woman takes the form of&#xD;
that inclination. "Yes, it is I, Mr. Marks," she&#xD;
said; and, while she was making inquiries about&#xD;
Mrs. Marks. and the el~ildren, Mr. Warwick, after&#xD;
speaking to her, took his departure. "I'll be&#xD;
back in the course of an hour," he said to. Mr.&#xD;
Marks; and then he went out-looking, Kath-&#xD;
&#xD;
m- anne thought, a little more grave than' was&#xD;
i- usual with him.&#xD;
a Her own business was soon transacted. If&#xD;
Mr. Marks felt any surprise at the demand she&#xD;
, came to make, he had discretion enough not to&#xD;
s show it. "The whole amount, Miss Kate?" was&#xD;
all that he said. "The whole amount, if you&#xD;
- please, Mr. Marks," she answered. So, after&#xD;
a due examination of accounts, and due adding&#xD;
~ up of interest, Katharine found no less a sum&#xD;
than one thousand dollars in crisp bank-notes,&#xD;
paid to her across the counter. Her heartgave&#xD;
a great leap. She had been so little accus-&#xD;
tomed to the command of money in her life,&#xD;
that this seemed to her a 'large amount-quite&#xD;
a moderate fortune, in fact. "Surely it will buy&#xD;
my freedom," she thought to herself;' with a&#xD;
stm~ange pang at her heart; and then, while she&#xD;
signed a receipt for the payment, a sudden&#xD;
I thought occurred to her, and she startled Mr.&#xD;
Marks by dropping the pen, and looking up at&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Mr. Marks, I am sorry," she said, hastily,&#xD;
"but could you let me have the amount in&#xD;
gold?"&#xD;
"In gold!" echoed Mr. Marks, so much as-&#xD;
tonished that he could not help showing it. "In&#xD;
gold, Miss Kate?"'&#xD;
"Yes-if it will not inconvenience you-&#xD;
if-."&#xD;
"If it will not inconvenience you, my dear&#xD;
young lady," interrupted the cashier, laughing a&#xD;
little. "You'll find it rather troublesome, I&#xD;
think; but of course the bank is always ready&#xD;
to pay specie when demanded on its notes. Do&#xD;
you want all that money in gold?"&#xD;
"All, if you please."&#xD;
"I must go down into the vault for it, then.&#xD;
We don't keep specie up here," he added, smil-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
As Katharine stood waiting for him to re-&#xD;
turn, she hurriedly reviewed the situation in her&#xD;
mind. Regarded in any light, it was a rather em-&#xD;
barrassing one. To conceal a thousand dollars&#xD;
in gold about her person was simply impossible;&#xD;
to carry it in her hand through the streets, with-&#xD;
out exciting much observation, and incurring&#xD;
much fatigue, was equally impossible. Yet&#xD;
what was to be done? If she paid the bank-&#xD;
notes to S~. John, he would certainly convert&#xD;
them Immediately into specie; and, as the notes&#xD;
might readily be identified, this would subject&#xD;
her to a great deal of unpleasant conjecture&#xD;
and possible inquiry. The only way to avoid it&#xD;
waste draw th~ gold at once; and yet, in that&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
case, the problem still remained-how was she to&#xD;
take the amount either to Mrs. Marks, or to An-&#xD;
ncsdalc, being unfortunately unprovided with any&#xD;
convenient pocket or satchel? Necessity, how-&#xD;
ever, is the best spur, not only to invention, but&#xD;
to fertile expedient. As Mr. Marks 'reii~tered&#xD;
the apartment, a solution for her difficultyflashed&#xD;
through Katharine's brain. She thanked him,&#xD;
after he had counted the last one of the ringing&#xD;
yellow pieces down before her; and, while he&#xD;
was methodically tying them up in a canvas bag,&#xD;
she asked, quickly~&#xD;
"Mr. Marks, would you object to my seeing&#xD;
a friend in the parlor yonder, across the pas-&#xD;
sage?"&#xD;
"Certainly not, Miss Katharine," answered&#xD;
Mr. Marks, speaking without the least hesitation.&#xD;
"By all means, see a half-dozen friends there, if&#xD;
you desire."&#xD;
"One will do," said Katharine, acknowledg-&#xD;
ing this pleasantry by a faint smile. "Now one&#xD;
thing more-will you give me a pen and some&#xD;
paper?"&#xD;
Pen and paper were obligingly placed before&#xD;
her; and she wrote a few lines, folded, sealed,&#xD;
and addressed the note to Mr. Henry Johns.&#xD;
As she was about to leave the room in search&#xD;
of a messenger, Mr. Marks spoke&#xD;
"If it's a note you want taken anywhere,&#xD;
Miss Kate, Hugh can go for you. He'll not be&#xD;
sorry for a ~ he said, nodding toward the&#xD;
'clerk.&#xD;
"If Mr. Ellis won't mind," said Katharine,&#xD;
looking at him with a smile.&#xD;
The young man put down his pen, and came&#xD;
forward with an air which plainly showed that&#xD;
he did not mind. In shy, boyish fashion, he was&#xD;
quite an admirer of Miss Treshapi, and she knew&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"You are always ready to oblige me," she&#xD;
said, giving him the note, with a smile that al.&#xD;
most turned his head. Then she followed him&#xD;
into the passage. "See the gentleman yourself;&#xD;
please," she said; and Hugh promised that he&#xD;
would.&#xD;
After he was gone, she went into the un-&#xD;
furnished parlor, and walked up and down the&#xD;
floor, thinking the bag of gold which she kept&#xD;
whispering to herself would buy her freedom-&#xD;
at least, for the present. After a while, how-&#xD;
ever, she found it heavy, and put it down on the&#xD;
window-sill, for tables or chairs there were none.&#xD;
Then, as she stood waiting, the forlorn aspect of&#xD;
every thing around began to strike her. Pew&#xD;
things are more forlorn than an empty room-a&#xD;
&#xD;
room of bare floor, naked walls, uncurtained win-&#xD;
dows-and when, together with these things, the&#xD;
day is cloudy, and the prospect without not a&#xD;
whit more enlivening than the prospect within, it&#xD;
would take a very strong mind indeed to with-&#xD;
stand the effect of time and place. Some people&#xD;
are peculiarly susceptible to influences like these,&#xD;
and Katharine was one of them. Those who&#xD;
knew her well thought she deserved a great deal&#xD;
of credit for being as quiet and full of practical&#xD;
common-sense as she generally proved herself;&#xD;
for she possessed in unfortunate degree that&#xD;
sensitiveness to outside events, that capability&#xD;
of being deeply affected by outside things, which&#xD;
sober, phlegmatic folk are fond of calling "non-&#xD;
sense." Engrossed as she now was by thoughts&#xD;
of the coming interview, she was not so en-&#xD;
grossed but that she noticed at the time, and&#xD;
remembered afterward, every separate detail that&#xD;
went to make up the scene around her-every&#xD;
grotesque figure on the sickly green wall-paper,&#xD;
every cobweb across the dusty, fly-specked win-&#xD;
dows, every tree and shrub in the yard outside.&#xD;
She was looking at her watch, and thinking how&#xD;
fast time was going, when the' click of the gate..&#xD;
latch make her start, and, looking up, she saw&#xD;
Hugh Ellis ushering in St. John.&#xD;
As they 'entered the passage, she opened 'the&#xD;
parlor door, and motioned the latter to enter.&#xD;
When he obeyed, she closed it againand, with-&#xD;
out speaking, walked to the window where the&#xD;
bag of money lay.~ Taking it in her hand, she&#xD;
turned and held it out as he approached.&#xD;
" Here it is, St. John," she said. "I wish it&#xD;
was more, but, sueh as it is, you are .welcome to,&#xD;
it. Don't think that I grudge you one shilling&#xD;
when I say-will you go imow and leave me in&#xD;
peace?"&#xD;
"You think of nothing but yourself;" said&#xD;
he, without touching the money. "Prom first&#xD;
to last, you have thought of nothing but your-&#xD;
self, and of being 'left in peace.' Yet, there are&#xD;
people who call women unselfish."&#xD;
"If I think of myself; who forced me to do&#xD;
so?" said she. "St. John, don't let us recrimi-&#xD;
nate now. Here is themoney. Take it-believe&#xD;
me, you are welcome to it."&#xD;
"As's. price to get rid of me."&#xD;
"No-as a relief freely given."&#xD;
"It's a devilish mean thing to take it," said&#xD;
he. But still he did take it-opening his eyes a&#xD;
little at the amount.&#xD;
"You must have been hoarding, Katharine,"&#xD;
he said. "Or else they pay like princes here."&#xD;
"They pay very well," she answered, "and I&#xD;

so.,,&#xD;
"What is the amount?"&#xD;
"A thousand dollars. I took gold, becan&#xD;
I thought you would prefer it to bank-notes."&#xD;
"This is better," said he, a little absent&#xD;
He weighed the bag in his hand, with an expe&#xD;
gesture. "Two hundred pounds stenlin.'" sal&#xD;
he. "Katharine, is it worth while to say that&#xD;
am much obliged to you?"&#xD;
"No-it is not worth while."&#xD;
"Very well," said he, coolly.&#xD;
He opened the bag, took out some of th&#xD;
coin and looked at it, put it back, and tied u,&#xD;
the mouth again. 4Something slightly nervous i&#xD;
the action, struck Katharine; but, as he did no&#xD;
speak, she spoke herself.&#xD;
"You will leave Tallahonia to-day, SI&#xD;
John?"&#xD;
"No," said he, sharply. "Why should yoi&#xD;
think so?"&#xD;
"I don't see what should detain you," shi&#xD;
answered. "I-this is all I can do for you."&#xD;
"I am not considering you," he said, coldly.&#xD;
He turned and walked up and down th&#xD;
room, looking absently at the doors and win.&#xD;
dews as he passed.&#xD;
"Is this rickety old place a bank?" ho&#xD;
asked, tfter a while.&#xD;
"Yes, it is a bank-that is, the bank is in&#xD;
the ether room."&#xD;
"Humph I They must offer a premium for&#xD;
feats of burglary."&#xD;
"It is seCure enough," Katharine answered&#xD;
-.--adding, suddenly, "St. John, don't waste time&#xD;
like this. Tell me what you mean by saying&#xD;
that you will not leave here."&#xD;
"I mean that I have found work to do," he&#xD;
answered, coming back, and pausing before her.&#xD;
"I mean, Katharine, that I have found ~he thing&#xD;
I most need, and least hoped for-a claim on&#xD;
Fraser."&#xD;
"A claim I-kere !-St. John, are you mad?"&#xD;
"If I tim, it is the luckiest fit of madness&#xD;
that ever came to anybody," he replied, with a&#xD;
short laugh. "No, I am quite sane, and I tell&#xD;
you-"&#xD;
"Rush I" said Katharine, catching his arm&#xD;
with a force that surprised him. "Hush I-what&#xD;
is that?"&#xD;
They both stood quite silent, and listened-&#xD;
St. John full of astonishment, Katharine full of&#xD;
suspense. Through the closed door, there came&#xD;
the sound of a rustling dress a~md a m~oman's voice&#xD;
in the passage beyond. As soon as Miss Tresham I&#xD;

s heard this, she turned and glanced out of the win-&#xD;
dow near by. To her dismay, the Annesley car-&#xD;
riage stood before the gate.&#xD;
"I must go," she said, hastily. "It is Mrs.&#xD;
French. St. John, don't keep me-I must go."&#xD;
"Who is Mrs. French?" he asked, impa-&#xD;
tiently. "I want to see you-I want to speak&#xD;
I to you about this business."&#xD;
"I cannot stay now," she said; and, as she&#xD;
spoke, she moved rapidly across the room, and&#xD;
unclosed the door, just as there came a knock on&#xD;
the other side. Opening it suddenly, she faced&#xD;
Mrs. French, who was standing with her hand&#xD;
uplifted, ready to knock again.&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Tresham," said she, rather taken&#xD;
aback. "I beg pardon-I hope I did not dis-&#xD;
turb you? The Andersons were not at home,&#xD;
so, thinking you might still be here, I called on&#xD;
my way to Mrs. Marks. Mr. Marks told me that&#xD;
you were in this room, and I merely wanted to&#xD;
let you know that I had come-I hope I did not&#xD;
disturb you."&#xD;
"Not at all," said Katharine, perfectly con-&#xD;
scious that, despite the obstacle of her figure,&#xD;
Mrs. French's eyes had fully explored the room,&#xD;
and fully scrutinized St. John, who was still&#xD;
standing near one of th~ windows, and imme-&#xD;
diately within her range of vision. "1 am&#xD;
ready to go," she added. "Don't let me detain&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"My time is quite at your service," said&#xD;
Mrs. French, with most obliging sweetness.&#xD;
"I can wait in the bank until you have finished&#xD;
your business."&#xD;
"I have entirely finiAhed it," answered Kath-&#xD;
&#xD;
anne.&#xD;
In consequence of this reply, Mrs French&#xD;
had no alternative but to turn from the door,&#xD;
and allow Miss Tresham an exit. As she walked&#xD;
down the passage, Katharine paused a moment,&#xD;
and motioned St. John to approach.&#xD;
"If you are anxious to see me, you can come&#xD;
out to Annesdale," she said. "If what you have&#xD;
to say is important, you can meet me to-morrow&#xD;
in the place that I showed you before."&#xD;
"At what hour?" he asked.&#xD;
"I will try to be there by twelve," she an-&#xD;
swered, after which she closed the door, and fol-&#xD;
lowed Mrs. Frennh.&#xD;
"Shall I tell John to stop at Mrs. Marks's?"&#xD;
asked this lady, as she moved aside to let Kath.&#xD;
anne enter the carriage.&#xD;
"I believe not," Miss Tresham answered.&#xD;
"I won't detain you. It does not matter, since&#xD;
I shall see Mrs. Marks in two or three days."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

&#xD;
"Home, John," said Mrs. French, gathering&#xD;
her silk dress in both hands and stepping into&#xD;
the carriage.&#xD;
Ten minutes after the equipage rolled out&#xD;
of sight, Mr. Warwick came down the street&#xD;
toward the bank. As he entered the gate, he&#xD;
met St. John, who was just going out. A glance&#xD;
only passed between the two men; but some-&#xD;
times a glance can be very significant. The&#xD;
ren~embrance of the lawyer's keen eyes gave&#xD;
the adventurer an uncomfortable feeling as he&#xD;
walked along, with Katharine's thousand dollars&#xD;
safely stowed in his pockets, while Mr. Warwick&#xD;
went straight into the bank and asked Mr. Marks&#xD;
what "that man" had wanted there.&#xD;
"That man 1- whom do you mean?" in-&#xD;
quired the cashier, in a tone of surprise.&#xD;
"That St. John, or Johns, as I believe he&#xD;
calls himself-what did he come here for?"&#xD;
"St. John !-Johns ?-Thcre has beennobody&#xD;
here of that name," said Mr. Marks, looking puz-&#xD;
zled. "In fact, there has been nobody here at&#xD;
all since you left, excepting Mrs. French, who&#xD;
called for Miss Tresham."&#xD;
"The gentleman Mr. Warwick means is the&#xD;
one Miss Tresham sent for," said Hugh Ellis,&#xD;
looking up. "I saw him as he went out of the&#xD;
gate."&#xD;
"Miss Tresham sent for him?" repeated Mr.&#xD;
Warwick.&#xD;
He said nothing more, but walked to one&#xD;
of the windows, and stood there for a minute&#xD;
gazing out. Then he turned and came back&#xD;
to his brother-in-law.&#xD;
"Don't think I am meddling," he said, "but&#xD;
if it is not confidential, I should like to know&#xD;
what Miss Tresham's business was. Did she&#xD;
say any thing to you about that man?"&#xD;
"She said nothing about any man," replied&#xD;
Mr. Marks. "She came to draw her money."&#xD;
"Her money l,~&#xD;
"The whole of her two-years' salary," said&#xD;
the cashier. "A very pretty little sum it was,&#xD;
too," he added, approvingly. "A thousand dol-&#xD;
lars down in gold."&#xD;
"Why did you pay it in gold?"&#xD;
"Because she requested it-from a foreign-&#xD;
er's distrust of our paper, I suppose. I did not&#xD;
think of it before," he went on, "but it looks a&#xD;
little as if she meant to go away. If she did,&#xD;
I should be very sorry, for I don't know where&#xD;
I could find another teacher who would suit us&#xD;
all as she does. As for the man, I don't know&#xD;
any thing about him. She wrote a note, and&#xD;
sent it by Hugh; but he hadn't been here&#xD;
&#xD;
l&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
more than ten minutes before Mrs. French&#xD;
came."&#xD;
"Did Miss Tresham go away then?"&#xD;
"Yes, she went away then."&#xD;
Mr. Marks paused a monient, looked at his&#xD;
brother-in-law, and added, hastily:&#xD;
"I hope there's nothing wrong about the&#xD;
man, Warwick? It did not occur to m~ to&#xD;
think any thing-somehow I always feel as if&#xD;
Miss Tresham could be trusted as we don't trust&#xD;
every woman of her age.~~&#xD;
"I am sure Miss Tresham can be trusted,"&#xD;
said Mr. Warwick, quickly. "You don't sup-&#xD;
pose I was thinking of her? Whatever the&#xD;
man may be, there's one thing certain-she can&#xD;
be rustedd."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear you say so," responded&#xD;
Mr. Marks, looking relieved&#xD;
Surely you did not need to hear me say&#xD;
so? Now, about my business. Mrs. Gordon&#xD;
asked nie to get this cheek cashed for her. She&#xD;
wants the money at once."&#xD;

"Msmrmri~," said Mrs. French, entering the&#xD;
drawing-room where her mother was sitting&#xD;
with half a dozen ladies, "have you any idea&#xD;
where Miss Treshiim is? We want to rehearse&#xD;
the tableaux for to-morrow evening, and she is&#xD;
not to be found."&#xD;
"I saw her go to walk a little while ago,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Annesley, looking up from her em-&#xD;
broidery. "She went out toward the shrub-&#xD;
bery, Adela. You had better send for her if you&#xD;
need her."&#xD;
"Send Mr. Langdon," said Mrs. Baynor,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
"I wouldn't advise you to do any thing of&#xD;
the kind, if you want to see either of them sodh&#xD;
again," remarked Mrs. Dargan. "T'hat young&#xD;
man is really absurd!" she added, with cQnsid-&#xD;
erable asperity.&#xD;
"Send Maggie Lester and Morton," said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley. "Spitfire will soon find her&#xD;
for them."&#xD;
"That is a good idea!" cried Mrs. French,&#xD;
and, by way of putting it into execution, she im-&#xD;
mediately returned to the library where the prin-&#xD;
cipal portion of the party were assembled. A&#xD;
lively examination of engravings, and discussion&#xD;
of costumes, was going on here, and a great deal&#xD;

116                MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
of interest and excitement was afloat; for, thirty&#xD;
years ago, tableaux were by no means the v9ry&#xD;
common and very boring amusement which they&#xD;
are at present. In those days they were quite&#xD;
novel, especially in country districts-and, in&#xD;
consequence of the novelty, were considered&#xD;
very fascinating. Not long before this, Mrs.&#xD;
- Fr~jch had assisted at an exhibition of the&#xD;
kindin Mobile, and she itus anxious to intro-&#xD;
duce the new amusement into Lagrange. Hav-&#xD;
ing abundant material at hand, in the matter of&#xD;
pretty girlsobliging gentlemen, and an unlimited&#xD;
command' of costume, she determined on giving&#xD;
a New-Year entertainment of this character.&#xD;
All. the company received the idea with enthu-&#xD;
siasm, and the only danger was that their zeal&#xD;
might outrun their discretion, inasmuch as they&#xD;
seemed anxioiis to prolong the entertainment in-&#xD;
definitely by representing every conceivable scene,&#xD;
and personating every imaginable character with-&#xD;
in the range of history or fiction. At length,&#xD;
however, this vaulting ambition a~as somewhat&#xD;
curbed, and the programme, after much weeding,&#xD;
wa~ finally made out. Of course, the usual trou-&#xD;
ble. about the distribution of parts-the trouble&#xD;
which is the bane of private theatricals, and all&#xD;
afihirs of the kind-ensued. But, by judicious&#xD;
management, the stormy waters were allayed,&#xD;
and, after many compromises, peace was at length&#xD;
secured. But only peace in partial form. Char.&#xD;
actors being settled, dress yet remained i~n open&#xD;
question; and, when Mrs. French entered the&#xD;
library, a warm discussion was in progress.&#xD;
"Itell you it.ought to be black velvet and&#xD;
pearls," Miss4.ester i~as saying, decidedly, as&#xD;
her friend walked up and touched her on the&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
"Let the black velvet alone just now, Mag.&#xD;
gie,"~she said. "I want you to go out into the&#xD;
grounds mid look for Miss Tresham. Mamma&#xD;
says she went to walk. I wouldn't ask you, only&#xD;
you are so fond of exercise; and, if you take&#xD;
Spitfire, hewill soon show you where she is. We&#xD;
must have her to settle about the dress of Queen&#xD;
Mary~ Please take Morton with you, and see if&#xD;
you can't find her."&#xD;
"Do you hear that, Mr. Aunesley?" asked&#xD;
Miss Lester, who was ready at once for the part&#xD;
assigu~d hex'. "The morning is charming, and&#xD;
I should like nothing better than a walk. Spit.&#xD;
lire will like a game of hide.aud-seek, too. He&#xD;
will find Miss Tresham for you in no time, Adela.&#xD;
Meanwhile"-this to the lady to whom she had&#xD;
beentalking before-" remember that I sayblack&#xD;
velvet and pearls."&#xD;
&#xD;
Spitfire was quite willing for a walk and i~&#xD;
game of hide-and-seek, 'while Morton, for his&#xD;
part, was heartily tired of talk about doublets,&#xD;
and ruffs, and colored lights, and gauze screens.&#xD;
"Oh, we can't let Mr. Annesley go-we&#xD;
haven't settled on the costume of the Master of&#xD;
Ravenswood yet!" cried one or two ladies, as he&#xD;
rose with alacrity to follow Miss Lester from the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"He won't be long," said Adela, philosophi-&#xD;
cally. "What do you think Lucy Ashton ought&#xD;
to wear ?-a bridal dress, of course; but in what&#xD;
shape?"&#xD;
"Which w~y .shall we go, Miss Lester?"&#xD;
asked Morton, as they descended the front steps&#xD;
together.&#xD;
"We will ask Spitfire that," the young lady&#xD;
answered. "Here, Spitfire ! - seek, sir, seek!&#xD;
Find Miss Tresham-Oh, I forgot," as Spitfire&#xD;
stood looking very confused and irresolute. "I&#xD;
must have something of Miss Tresham's to show&#xD;
him. Mr. Annesley, run into the hail and see if&#xD;
you can't find me something."&#xD;
Mr. Annesley did as he was bid-that is, he&#xD;
walked into the hall, and returned after a minute&#xD;
or two with a long crimson scarf. "I think&#xD;
this is Miss Tresham's," he said. "I have seen&#xD;
her wear it several times."&#xD;
"Here, Spitfire, here!" said his mistress,&#xD;
shaking the scarf at him, as if she was a mata-&#xD;
dore and Spitfire was the bull she wished to en-&#xD;
rage. "Here, pet! and now go and seek Miss&#xD;
Tresham."&#xD;
Thanks to the instructions of" Cousin Tom,"&#xD;
Spitfire was tolerably well trained. He sniffed at&#xD;
the scarf, then trotted about a little, sniffed at the&#xD;
ground in much the same disdainful fashion, and&#xD;
finally set off toward the shrubbery.&#xD;
"Come on," said Miss Lester, beginning to&#xD;
walk very fast; and Morton came on, as request-&#xD;
ed. Fast walking is not the most graceful thing&#xD;
in the world, as we who livb in this day have&#xD;
ample opportunity for observing; but, on the&#xD;
81st of December, when the sun is clouded over,&#xD;
and the air decidedly sharp, it is at least a com-&#xD;
fortable thing. .Miss Lester's cheeks had bright&#xD;
roses in them whei~ at last she came to a halt.&#xD;
"Where has Spitfire ~one?" she cried, laughing~&#xD;
"I am afraid we shall have to look for him, with.&#xD;
out the advantage, which he has, of a nose as a&#xD;
guide."&#xD;
"This way, I think," said Morton, and he&#xD;
turned down a path that led into the wildest and&#xD;
prettiest part of the grounds. The woods, which&#xD;
had been enclosed here, were left almost ~htirely&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
as Nature arranged them, excepting that the en-&#xD;
cumbering undergrowth of the forest had been&#xD;
cleared away, and now and then a rustic seat was&#xD;
placed in some shady nook. In spring, summer,&#xD;
or autumn, a lovelier spot was not to be found&#xD;
within the borders of Li~grange; but it looked&#xD;
cheerless enough on this bleak December day,&#xD;
with the leafless trees standing out like fine pen-&#xD;
cii tracery against a dull, gray sky, and the brown&#xD;
earth covered only with dry, fallen leaves.&#xD;
"I don't think Spitfire came this way," said&#xD;
Miss Lester, a little pettishly, for she did not&#xD;
fancy walking down a steep hill with the as-&#xD;
~sured certainty that she would have to walk up&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"I am sure he did," said Annesley; "but, if&#xD;
you are tired, we won't go on. No doubt he will&#xD;
bring Miss Tresham to us after a while. Here is&#xD;
a seat-pray sit down."&#xD;
"No, we might as well go on. There I-is&#xD;
not that Spitfire that I hear?"&#xD;
It was Spitfire, undoubtedly. From no other&#xD;
canine throat could such a volume of shrill sound&#xD;
have issued-a vehement barking, of the most in-&#xD;
dignant kind, that was borne with singular dis-&#xD;
tinctness through the still air.&#xD;
"He can't be attacking Miss Tresham in that&#xD;
way," said Morton, quickly.&#xD;
"Oh, no," said Spitfire's mistress, with the&#xD;
coolness which characterizes the owners of bad&#xD;
dogs, when those dogs are annoying or terrifying&#xD;
other people within an inch of their lives. "He&#xD;
-he has met somebody else-somebody that he&#xD;
don't know. Let us walk faster," she went on,&#xD;
more eagerly, "or he may be hurt.'&#xD;
"The somebody may be hurt, do you mean?"&#xD;
asked Annesley, as he quickened his pace in ac-&#xD;
cordance with her own. "Surely Spitfire will not&#xD;
really bite?"&#xD;
"The somebody l" echoed the young lady,&#xD;
with an indignation that startled him. "You&#xD;
don't suppose I am thinking of the somebody-&#xD;
I mean that Spitfire himself may be hurt."&#xD;
"Oh!" said the gentleman, thus enlightened&#xD;
-then he added, with a smile, "perhaps he may.&#xD;
1 wQuld ,not answer for what I might do under&#xD;
such provocation as that."&#xD;
"That" was the furious sounds of rage to&#xD;
which Spitfire was giving utterance as they ap-&#xD;
proached. Other sounds were also audible now&#xD;
-Katharine's voice calling him oY, and a man's&#xD;
voice angrily bidding him be gone.&#xD;
"Some one is with Miss Tresham," said Mor-&#xD;
ton, stopping with an instinctive hesitation-an&#xD;
instinctive remembrance of that other meeting&#xD;

LT ~HIDE-AND-SEEK.                     117&#xD;
of which his mother had spoken two days be-&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
But he stopped too late. Urged by a fear for&#xD;
Spitfire's safety, Miss Lester rushed eagerly for-&#xD;
ward, and he could not decline to follow. A few&#xD;
more steps brought them into the little dell, of&#xD;
which mention has before been made, and there&#xD;
the combat was raging hotly-Spitfire barking&#xD;
fiercely, and making frantic dashes at the feet&#xD;
and legs of St. John, the latter defending himself&#xD;
with considerable bravery, and Katharine trying,&#xD;
by alternate persuasion and command, to draw&#xD;
off the assailant.&#xD;
Upon this scene Miss Lester rushed, just as&#xD;
St. John lost patience, and, stooping, took up a&#xD;
stone. Before he'could throw it, his arm w~s&#xD;
peremptorily caught.&#xD;
"How dare you I', cried the indignant and&#xD;
breathless owner of Spitfire. "How dare "-a&#xD;
long pant-." dare you throw stones at my dog?&#xD;
I wonder you are not ashamed of yourself-a&#xD;
great big man like you to be afraid of a little dog&#xD;
like that!"&#xD;
"Excuse me," stammered he, turning round&#xD;
in astonishment, and finding himself in the grasp&#xD;
of a young and pretty woman. "I did not mean&#xD;
tohurt him-but he attacked me without provoca.&#xD;
tion, and "-he added, with a sud~1en effort to re-&#xD;
cover the self-possession that had escaped him-&#xD;
"'though he be but little, he is fierce.' You&#xD;
must confess that."&#xD;
"How could you let him do it?" said Miss&#xD;
Lester, turning to Katharine, "and when Spitfire&#xD;
-poor, dear fellow-came out to look for you,&#xD;
too! But what is the matter ?-are you not&#xD;
well?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am well," said Katharine, trying to&#xD;
smile-a piteous attempt which touched Annes-&#xD;
Icy-" but first Spitfire, and then you, startled,&#xD;
sue a little. I was not expecting any one."&#xD;
"Adela sent us to look for you," said Miss&#xD;
Lester, turning her back on the gentleman, al&#xD;
the more determinedly because she was dying of&#xD;
curiosity to look at~ him. In her own fashion,&#xD;
shewas a girl of very high-minded ideas, though;&#xD;
and she kept her eyes steadily fastened onKath-&#xD;
anne's face. "Adela sent us for you. ~She'&#xD;
wants to rehearse the tableaux, and you forget&#xD;
that you are Queen Mary and Joan of Are."&#xD;
"I did forget it entirely," said Katharine.&#xD;
"I will go back with you at once. Mr."-.--she&#xD;
paused a moment - " Mr. Johns, perhaps Mr.&#xD;
Annesley will be kind enough tc~ show you the&#xD;
way out of the grounds."&#xD;
"Certainly," said Mr. Annesley, with a grave,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="118-119" xml:id="VAC8070-00000064"/>&#xD;

bow, "unless y6~u will permit me to suggest the&#xD;
amendment that you introduce me to your friend,&#xD;
and that he will do me the honor to return with&#xD;
us to the house."&#xD;
Katharine cast a quick look of mingled appre-&#xD;
hension and entreaty at St. John before going&#xD;
through the form of introduction, in a voice that&#xD;
was not quite steady. She might have spared&#xD;
herself the apprehension she entertained. St.&#xD;
4ohn was equal to the occasion. He bowed&#xD;
with easy grace, and regretted that he could&#xD;
not accept Mr. Annesley's courteous invitation;&#xD;
then bowed again to the ladies, as Katharine&#xD;
said to Miss Leste~', "Shall we return now?"&#xD;
"With all my heart," the young lady an-&#xD;
sivered., "Here, Spitfire! here pet! I am&#xD;
afraid to leave him there," she went on, as&#xD;
Katharine and herself mounted the hill. "He&#xD;
has evidently taken a great dislike to that gen.&#xD;
tleman, and, when Spitfire takes a dislike to any.&#xD;
body, he never gets over it. He-your friend-.&#xD;
was about to hurt him when I came up."&#xD;
"I thYnk not," said Katharine. Then she&#xD;
added, suddenly: "Don't call him my friend. I&#xD;
know him, and he chanced to be here and meet&#xD;
me-that is all."&#xD;
"You know him I" repeated Miss Lester,&#xD;
looking at her. "Excuse me, but you say that&#xD;
as if you did~not like him."&#xD;
"I don't like him."&#xD;
"Then, if I were you," said the oilier, with&#xD;
sudden frankness, "I would not meet him in this&#xD;
sort of way. I wouldn't do it for a man I liked,&#xD;
end I am sure I would see a man I didn't like&#xD;
shot ten times over first. Don't think me imper.&#xD;
tinenti Miss Tresham," she went on,"butllike&#xD;
yo~s, and I thought I would tell you how people&#xD;
consider such things here. You are a stranger,&#xD;
and perhaps don't know our customs. Of course,&#xD;
I shall not gossip about the matter, and, as for&#xD;
Morton Annesley, he is true as steel; but still,&#xD;
If I were you, I wouldn't do it. Are you offend-&#xD;
ed with me?"&#xD;
"Not ifl the least," said Katharine, smiling&#xD;
faintly. "You mean kindly, and, therefore, I&#xD;
could not be ~ffendcd. You simply don't under.&#xD;
stand.~'&#xD;
The last words were uttered so quietly, and&#xD;
with so much unconscious dignity, that they had&#xD;
their effect upon Miss Lester. She hesitated a&#xD;
minute before answering.&#xD;
"No, I don't understand, of course, and I&#xD;
don't mean to judge either. But I can see how&#xD;
things look, Miss Tresham, and it was of looks&#xD;
tbat I was speaking."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, I know," said Katharine, absently.&#xD;
Meanwhile Morton and the companion who&#xD;
had been presented to him were crossing the&#xD;
grounds to the side-gate through which St. John&#xD;
had entered. A few commonplace remarks about&#xD;
the weather were interchanged as they proceed-&#xD;
ccl; but, when they reached the gate, instead of&#xD;
opening It, Anneslcy stopped and faced the other.&#xD;
"Excuse me, Mr. Johns," he said, gravely,&#xD;
"if I ask leave to speak a few words before we&#xD;
part. Of course, I do not know why you pre-&#xD;
ferred to see Miss Tresham in the grounds, but&#xD;
permit me to remind you that the house is only&#xD;
a short distance from the place where I met you,&#xD;
and that any one of Miss Tresham's friends is&#xD;
cordially welcome there."&#xD;
"It was by Miss Tresham's own request that&#xD;
I met her where I did," answered St. John,&#xD;
coldly. "I will bid you good-morning, with the&#xD;
assurance that I shall not invade your domain&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"I hope you understand that it was on Miss&#xD;
Tresham's account that I spoke," said Morton,&#xD;
flushing a little.&#xD;
The other lifted his hat with a courtesy so&#xD;
ceremonious that it had not a little of mockery&#xD;
in it.&#xD;
"In Miss Tresham's name, allow me to thank&#xD;
you," he answered. "The only thing that puz.&#xD;
zles me is the cause of this kind solicitude."&#xD;
"Miss Tresham is one of my mother's guests,"&#xD;
said Annesley, with a good deal of unconscious&#xD;
auteur. He. opened the gate, and raised his&#xD;
own hat, as St. John passed through. Nothing&#xD;
more was said~ on either side. They parted with&#xD;
a couple of stiff bows that would have become&#xD;
a pair of duellists; and, as St. John strode&#xD;
away in the direction of Tallahoma, Annesley&#xD;
went back to the house.&#xD;
When he entered the hall he was at once&#xD;
waylaid by Mr. Langdon, and marched szolens&#xD;
votes. into the back drawing-room, where a re-&#xD;
hearsal was going on.&#xD;
"No mutiny, young man," said the latter, as&#xD;
Morton tried to get away on a pretext of busi-&#xD;
ness. "I was sent in search of you, and it is as&#xD;
much as my lie is worth to go pack without you.&#xD;
Queen Adela is ?e,~mant just now, and she would&#xD;
think nothing of ordering my head to be taken&#xD;
off for disobedience of orders. In with you!"&#xD;
He gave his captive nt time for expostula-&#xD;
tion, but ushered him straight into the room&#xD;
where the ~tage of Christmas Eve was again&#xD;
erected. Strangely enough the two women&#xD;
whom Morton had last seen together in the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
SPITFIRE PLAYS AT HIDE-AND-SEEK.&#xD;
&#xD;
grounds were the first on whom his eye fell&#xD;
as he entered.&#xD;
They were now confronting each other in&#xD;
tragic attitude-Miss Lester as Queen Elizabeth,&#xD;
Katharine as Queen Mary, in the famous scene&#xD;
from Schiller's "Marie Stuart."&#xD;
In these days all the world knows that scene,&#xD;
for all the world has seen Ristori act it. But&#xD;
then it was something neW, and something for&#xD;
which the world of Lagrange was indebted to&#xD;
Morton Annesley. He, knowing and admiring&#xD;
Schiller with all the enthusiasm of a German&#xD;
*     student, had suggested the picture, and given&#xD;
his opinion concerning a proper selection of the&#xD;
characters.&#xD;
"Maggie Lester would do for an immensely.&#xD;
flattered ~Queen Elizabeth," he said, laughing.&#xD;
"She can't deny that her hair is red. And, if&#xD;
you were to put a Marie-Stuart coif and curls on&#xD;
Miss Tresham, I am sure she would look like the&#xD;
Queen of Scots. The color of her hair and the&#xD;
cast of her features are not unlike the portraits&#xD;
of the royal beauty."&#xD;
When he came in just now poor Queen Mary&#xD;
was thinking of any thing else but her cowering&#xD;
rival or her deadly wrongs. She saw him enter,&#xD;
and, though she could not turn her head, she&#xD;
shot a wistful glance out of the corners of her&#xD;
eyes which Mrs.Frcnch caught as well as himself.&#xD;
This astute lady had made nothing of Maggie&#xD;
Lester's reserve and self-possession. But a look&#xD;
at her brother's face told her all that she wanted&#xD;
to know.&#xD;
"He has seen him!" she thought; and the&#xD;
knowledge acted on her like a stimulant, enliven-&#xD;
ing her spirits as if by magic.&#xD;
After that the tableaux went on bravely, for&#xD;
everybody was held well in hand by their fair&#xD;
ruler, and nobody ventured on any open signs&#xD;
of weariness or dissatisfaction.&#xD;
It was not until the rehearsal ended, and&#xD;
most of the companyhad dispersed to dress for&#xD;
dinner, that Katharine found an opportunity of&#xD;
speaking to Morton. He was standing near the&#xD;
sttge, directing the servants, who were arranging&#xD;
some of the decorations, when she walked up to&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Mr. Annesley," she said, hurriedly, "I&#xD;
should like to speak to you. I have something&#xD;
to say to you. May I say it now?"&#xD;
"Certainly," he answered, turning at the first&#xD;
sound of her voice. "Shall we go into the libra-&#xD;
ry?"&#xD;
"No, it is only a few words. If you will&#xD;
come here4-."&#xD;
&#xD;
119&#xD;
&#xD;
She walked away, and he followed her. Every&#xD;
one, excepting the servants, had now left the&#xD;
room. On one side was a bay.wiudow, and into&#xD;
this Katharine went.&#xD;
"It is only a few words," she repeated, as&#xD;
Annesley followed her; "but I should not like&#xD;
for any one to hear them."&#xD;
"There is no danger of any one's doing so&#xD;
here," he answered.&#xD;
Then he was silent, waiting for her to speak.&#xD;
After a minute she began, with a nervous haste&#xD;
of manner that had grown habitual with her of&#xD;
late.&#xD;
"It is not about myself, Mr. Annesley. It is&#xD;
about Mrs. Gordon. I know that you are much&#xD;
attached to her, and-and I thought I would&#xD;
tell you, so that perhaps you might be of service&#xD;
to her. She is threatened, if not with danger, at&#xD;
least with serious annoyance."&#xD;
Now, this was the last sort of communication&#xD;
which Morton could possibly have expected to&#xD;
hear, and the surprise which he naturally felt&#xD;
showed itself at once in his face and nianner.&#xD;
"Mrs. Gordon threatened with serious an-&#xD;
noyance 1" he repeated, with a start. "Pardon&#xD;
me, but you must be mistaken. There is no one&#xD;
who would dare-"&#xD;
"There is some one who has the right to&#xD;
dare," she interposed, hastily. "Believe me, I&#xD;
know what I am saying. She is certainly threat.&#xD;
ened with very serious annoyance and distress."&#xD;
A sudden dark flush rose over his face, and&#xD;
he frowned as Katharine had never seen him&#xD;
frown before. She recognized then what many&#xD;
other people had recognized before, that to&#xD;
touch Mrs. gordon was to assail him in one of&#xD;
his most sensitive points.&#xD;
"By whom, and iwwhat way?" he asked.&#xD;
"I cannot tell you that. I would if it were&#xD;
my secret; but it is not mine-it is Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
don's. It came to my knowledge accidentally,&#xD;
and I cannot repeat it. Go to her, and, if she&#xD;
wishes you to serve her, she will tell you herself.&#xD;
I--I am very sorry for her," said the girl, with&#xD;
tears coming into her eyes. "She has a hard&#xD;
lot. I wish I could help her. Perhaps you can,&#xD;
Mr. Annesley-you are a man."&#xD;
"I will try, at least," he said. "Shall I--&#xD;
would you advise me to go at once?"&#xD;
"At once."&#xD;
He moved away a few steps, turned abruptly,&#xD;
uid came back.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham," he said, quickly, "Is there&#xD;
nothingg I can do for yourself?"&#xD;
She knew what be meant. She kne~v that he&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
would not ask her confidence, or seem to request&#xD;
an explanation of the events of that morning.&#xD;
But she also knew that he gave her an opportu-&#xD;
nity-perhaps a' last one-to right herself in his&#xD;
eyes. Some instinct told her that much hung&#xD;
on her reply, and she gave a slight gasp over&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"Nothing, Mr. Annesley."&#xD;
"I am sorry for that," he said.&#xD;
Then, as if afraid to tru~t himself to speak&#xD;
another word, he walked away.&#xD;
In tlielhall he met 'his mother.&#xD;
"Where are you going, Morton?" she asked,&#xD;
as she saw him take his gloves and riding-whip&#xD;
from the stand. "Don't you know that dinner&#xD;
is nearly ready?"&#xD;
"I shall not be back to dinner," he answered.&#xD;
"Make my apologies, if you please, mother, and&#xD;
say that iw~ortaut business called me away."&#xD;
"Why, where are you going?"&#xD;
"I will tell you when I come back. I have&#xD;
not time to talk now."&#xD;
"But, Morton-"&#xD;
She spoke in vain. Morton was gone. When&#xD;
she followed him to the door he was walking&#xD;
rapidly in the direction of tbe stables, and, not&#xD;
long afterward, she saw him, from her chamber&#xD;
window, canter away in the direction of Talla-&#xD;
homa.&#xD;
It was not to Tallahoma that he was bound,&#xD;
however. The last sun of the Old Year had&#xD;
given a few golden gleams, and was sinking to&#xD;
rest in a beg' of soft, violet cloudy when he dis-&#xD;
mounted from Ilderim before the door of Morton&#xD;
House. Rapidly as he had ridden, he noticed&#xD;
along the avenue the fresh track of carriage-&#xD;
wheels, and the fact puzzled him a little. Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon never left home, and nobody. ever came&#xD;
to' the house. At an ordinary time he might&#xD;
merely have thought that one of these rules had&#xD;
been broken; but now, with the remembrance&#xD;
of Katharine's vague warning in his mind, he&#xD;
felt an uncomfortable foreboding of ill. This&#xD;
foreboding was increased as he approached the&#xD;
terrace and saw a group of negroes loitering with&#xD;
sorrowful faces around'the steps.&#xD;
"What is the' matter?" he asked, as one of&#xD;
them came forward 'and took his horse. "Has&#xD;
any thing happened that you all look as if you&#xD;
had beenlto a funeral ?"'&#xD;
"Mesa' Felix is gone, sir," answered the boy&#xD;
addressed, in a tone which indicated that he&#xD;
tliou~ht this a' sufficient reason for any length&#xD;
of visage.&#xD;
"Felix I--gone--~l" Annesley repeated. A&#xD;
&#xD;
sudden fear, common enough iii that country&#xD;
and at that time, startled him. "Do you mean&#xD;
that he is lost?"&#xD;
"Oh, no, sir," answered the boy, quickly.&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick came and took him away in a&#xD;
carriage. They hadn't left more'n a few minutes&#xD;
before you got here, sir."&#xD;
"Did his mother-did your mistress go&#xD;
too?"&#xD;
"I"lo, sir-she's in the house."&#xD;
"Very welL Keep my horse here. I shall&#xD;
be back directly."&#xD;
He walked hastily to the house and on the&#xD;
portico met Harrison, who was wearing a most&#xD;
lugubrious face.&#xD;
"What is the meaning of this, Harrison?"&#xD;
Morton asked, quickly. "Where has Felix gone?&#xD;
-and why has he been sent away?"&#xD;
CL The Lord only knows, Mass ~ said&#xD;
the old man, dolefully. "Miss Pauline and Mr.&#xD;
Warwick done it. I don't think they asked any.&#xD;
body's advice, sir-they just packed up Mass&#xD;
Felix's clothes, and took him right away. It&#xD;
was hard on the poor child, sir, for he didn't&#xD;
want to go; and if you could a-heard him a-cry-&#xD;
ing, sir, it would almost a-broke your heart."&#xD;
"I am glad I didn't hear him then," said&#xD;
Morton, who saw plainly that the whole feeling&#xD;
of the household was ranged on Felix's side.&#xD;
"But his mother must have had some gofod rca-&#xD;
'son for sending him away. Where is she?"&#xD;
"In her own room, Mass Morton"' answered&#xD;
Harrison, following the young man ~into the&#xD;
house. "You better go into the drawing-room,&#xD;
sir, and I'll ask if Miss Pauline can see you. I&#xD;
don't mean to blame Miss Pauline," ho added,&#xD;
with an air of severe justice. "To be sure she&#xD;
must a had her reasons unbeknownst to the rest&#xD;
of us. But it was hard on Mass Felix-and him&#xD;
so young."&#xD;
"A great many things are hard," said. Mor-&#xD;
ton, "but they must be done. Send Babette to&#xD;
ask 'my cousin if she will see me."&#xD;
In a few minutes, Babette entered the room,&#xD;
and sajd that Mrs. Gordon would see him. The&#xD;
Frenchwoman's eyes were red with weeping, and&#xD;
her face was sadly swollen from the same cause.&#xD;
Morton felt sorry for her~' and said so~-at which&#xD;
she startled him by a fresh burst of tears.&#xD;
"Ah, madame-poor ~ cried she.&#xD;
"M'sieur, 'comfort her, if you can. She is&#xD;
heart-broken--she will die of grief, if she is not'&#xD;
comforted."&#xD;
"I will do my best," said he;" but if Felix&#xD;
is gone, I fear that will not be much. Cheer&#xD;

up, Babettel Surely he will be back before&#xD;
long."&#xD;
"Le bon Dieu only knows," answered Ba.&#xD;
bette. And, as he crossed the hail, he heard her&#xD;
'sobbing behind him.&#xD;
Poor Morton I There is no exaggeration in&#xD;
saying that he would sooner have faced any dan-&#xD;
ger which could possibly be imagined, than the&#xD;
scene which fancy painted as awaiting him in&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon's room. The sobs, the tears-Ba-&#xD;
bette's noisy grief was, of course, only a faint&#xD;
shadow of what the bereaved mother must feeL&#xD;
He set his teeth, as he laid his hand on the door-&#xD;
knob-then turned it, and entered.&#xD;
All was quiet within. On the hearth the fire&#xD;
burned; outside the windows, a soft, sad requiem&#xD;
of the dying year was moaning through the tall&#xD;
trees; but no human sob or sigh was borne to&#xD;
Annesley's ear. A figure clad in black sat on&#xD;
one side of the fireplace, and held out her hand&#xD;
as he advanced.&#xD;
"Come in," said Mrs. Gordon, quietly. "You&#xD;
- are very welcome. Is it not cold? Draw nearer&#xD;
the fire. Well "-with a faint, mournful smile-&#xD;
"have you heard the news? I am desolate."&#xD;
"I have heard it," he answered.&#xD;
He could say no more; for, although he ought&#xD;
to have been relieved, he was, in truth, more&#xD;
deeply affected by her quietude than he could&#xD;
have been by any vehement outbreak whatever.&#xD;
The hopeless accent of the last words went&#xD;
straight to his heart, and touched it more than&#xD;
tears could have done. He said nothing; but&#xD;
he kept her hand tightly clasped in his for sev-&#xD;
eral minutes.&#xD;
"I see you feel for me," she said-" you do&#xD;
not think it is foolish to mind it so."&#xD;
"No words can say how much I feel for you,"&#xD;
he answered.&#xD;
"It might be foolish, perhaps," she went&#xD;
on, "if he was not my all. But he is, you&#xD;
know-literally every thing that I have on&#xD;
earth."&#xD;
'"But surely you have not sent him far-surely&#xD;
he will not be gone long?~~ said Morton, unable&#xD;
to contain his surprise.&#xD;
"I do not know where he has gone," she&#xD;
answered, in the same quiet, hopeless tone;&#xD;
"and I do not~know when I shall see him again&#xD;
-perhaps never."&#xD;
Annesley said, "Good Heavens I "-and then&#xD;
he stopped. A sudden remembrance of Kath-&#xD;
arine's words and looks came ~to him. "It is&#xD;
'Mrs. Gordon's secret," she had said. "If she&#xD;
wishes you to serve her, she will tell it to you."&#xD;
&#xD;
121&#xD;
&#xD;
Here was the secret staring him in the face;&#xD;
and evidently it had been told not to him, but&#xD;
to John Warwick. For a moment, he felt&#xD;
wounded-more deeply wounded than it is pos-&#xD;
sible to describe; but, almost immediately, cooler&#xD;
reason and better feeling triumphed.&#xD;
"'Whatever you have done, I am sure you&#xD;
have done well," he said, in his kind, loyal voice.&#xD;
"Whatever is to be borne, I am sure you will&#xD;
bear well. This is no time for reproaches, but I&#xD;
cannot help asking you why you forgot that I am&#xD;
your kinsman, and ready to do any service for&#xD;
you~"&#xD;
"1 did not forget it," said she, holding out&#xD;
again the hand he had relinquished. "Morton,&#xD;
don't reproach me-for that i~ reproach. 'After&#xD;
Felix, there is no one so near my heart as you&#xD;
are-both for your own and your father's sake.&#xD;
If I did not ask this service of you, it was only&#xD;
because you were not in a position to render it.&#xD;
Circumstances made it necessary that Felix&#xD;
should be taken away-far away, 'where even I&#xD;
might not know where he is-and you had not&#xD;
the requisite time for this."&#xD;
"I would have taken the time."&#xD;
"I don't doubt that-but I could not ask it.&#xD;
Besides, I went to John Warwick, as a lawyer,&#xD;
and he advised me as a lawyer, before he served&#xD;
inc as a friend."&#xD;
"I could not have advised you, perhaps; but&#xD;
I would have served you against any thing-or&#xD;
anybody."&#xD;
"There are some things one can only fight&#xD;
with cunning, not with force," said she-adding,&#xD;
after a moment, "I will tell you every thing if&#xD;
you will remember that I tell it oulyto you-mi~&#xD;
to Lagrange, or to anybody in Lagrange. Yet&#xD;
that is a foolish remnant of the old pride, for&#xD;
everybody will know it soon."&#xD;
"Consult youz"own feelings, not mine," said&#xD;
he. "If it is painful to you to speak, don't do&#xD;
it. I will serve you ignorantly as readily as&#xD;
with knowledge. Don't-don't distress your-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"You deserve confidence from me," said she,&#xD;
"and you shall have it."&#xD;
Then, as if it were a relief-and, indeed, after&#xD;
a fashion, it was a relief.-.she began and poured&#xD;
forth her pitiful story, going far more into detail&#xD;
than she had done in speaking to John Warwick,&#xD;
and eliciting far more of warm, outspoken sym-&#xD;
pathy. What the lawyer felt he had shown in&#xD;
deeds, not words; what Morton felt burst forth&#xD;
in eager 'language, though it would have been&#xD;
equally ready to prove itself by acts. The dif-&#xD;

&#xD;
ference was lesS in the different natures of the&#xD;
two men than in their different ages.&#xD;
As Mrs. Gordon went on, Morton's interest&#xD;
grew Watmer, until suddenly there came a cold&#xD;
chilL It would be hard to say what the young&#xD;
man felt when she first spoke of St. John, and&#xD;
an instinct.-...a sharp convulsion at his heart.-.&#xD;
told him that this St. John was one and the&#xD;
same with the"' Mr. Johns" whom Katharine&#xD;
Tresham had that morning asked him to show&#xD;
out of the grounds ofAnneadale. Then, the&#xD;
warning sjse had given him, the knowledge which&#xD;
she possessed of this carefully.guarded secrbt-&#xD;
he grew suddenly faint and sick, and turned so&#xD;
palethat Mrs. Gordkn noticed it.&#xD;
"What is the matter?" she asked. "You&#xD;
are thinking of something besides nie."&#xD;
"I am thinking of this St. John," he an.&#xD;
swerved. "Don't you think that he may have&#xD;
~come here accidentally-not in search of you,&#xD;
after all?"&#xD;
"Babette thinks so; but I cannot believe it.&#xD;
However much he may pretend otherwise, I am&#xD;
sure he came here in search of me."&#xD;
"But how did he know that you were&#xD;
here?"&#xD;
"I cannot tell that."&#xD;
-iMorton said no more. lie would have cut&#xD;
out his tongue sooner than mention Katharine's&#xD;
name in the matter; and, although he did not&#xD;
know it, Mr. Warwick had been equally dis.&#xD;
erect. Mrs. Gordon had not a suspicion that St.&#xD;
John was connected with any one in Lagrange&#xD;
besides herself. Different as the two men were,&#xD;
they had something in common, which they&#xD;
proved by this reticence. Morton was right&#xD;
when he once told Felix that the grand test of a&#xD;
gentleman is the capability of being trusted;&#xD;
and he might have added that it is not only the&#xD;
capability of being loyal to ft truss which has&#xD;
beeniolemnly and explicitly given, but it is also&#xD;
to be found In that fine sense of honor which can&#xD;
appreciate tacit confidence, and respect the secret&#xD;
for which n~ Ocerecy has been asked.&#xD;
When Annesley rode away from Morton&#xD;
House, the last day of the Old Year had died the&#xD;
death common to all things mortal. The last&#xD;
gloam of light had faded in the west; the night&#xD;
liungo~er all things with its sombre mantle; the&#xD;
stars gleamed within uncertain fitfulness through&#xD;
a curtain of misty cloud; and even the lights&#xD;
from the wayside houses looked, to the young&#xD;
man's fancy, more dull and red than cheery and&#xD;
bright. As be rode forward,. his heart was&#xD;
strangely heavy, his mind strangely disturbed,&#xD;
&#xD;
and, in a sort of accompaniment to the thoughts&#xD;
that tormented him, a certain verse of a poem he&#xD;
had seen shortly before kept running through his&#xD;
brain. Almost unconsciously, as he looked at&#xD;
the great hosts of Night that were marching&#xD;
steadily forward to the death-bed of the Old&#xD;
Year, he caught himself repeating:&#xD;
&#xD;
"He ileth still; he doth not move;&#xD;
He will not see the dawn of day.&#xD;
He hathno other life above.&#xD;
He gave me a friend sad a true true-love,&#xD;
And the l.~ew Year will take them away."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
A. MOaNING-CALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
GanAr was the rejoicing of the Marks cliii.&#xD;
dren when, on the day after New-Year, the same&#xD;
carriage that had conveyed Miss Tresham away&#xD;
drove up to the gate; and Miss Tresham de-&#xD;
scended, smiling in acknowledgment of their&#xD;
eager welcome, but looking decidedly pale and&#xD;
worn, as Mrs. Marks at once perceived.&#xD;
"Dissipation don't agree with you, Miss Kath-&#xD;
arine," she said, after the first bustle of greeting&#xD;
was over. "I never saw you look so badly. You&#xD;
must have danced all last night."&#xD;
"I did," said Katharine, smiling. "After the&#xD;
tabteawo we had a sort of fancy ball-that is, all&#xD;
those who had taken part in the tableaux were&#xD;
in costume-and day was breaking when I went&#xD;
to bed. I wish you had come to the tableaux,&#xD;
Mrs. Marks-they were so pretty!"&#xD;
"I thought about it," said Mrs. Marks, re-&#xD;
gretfully. "I should have liked to have gone;&#xD;
but it was a long drive, and Nelly had a cough&#xD;
that sounded a little like croup, so I was afraid&#xD;
to leave her."&#xD;
"But you might have sent Sara and Katy;&#xD;
they would have enjoyed itac much I"&#xD;
"They were crazy to go, and I might have&#xD;
sent them if there had been anybody to take&#xD;
thenji. But Richard was tired, and Jqjxn isn't&#xD;
here, you know."&#xD;
"Indeed, I don't know," said Katharine,&#xD;
with a start. "Where has Mr. Warwick&#xD;
gone?"&#xD;
"Gone to take Felix Gordon to school," an-&#xD;
swered Mrs. Marks, sending her scissors with a&#xD;
sharp snip through the cloth from which she was&#xD;
cutting a jacket for one of the boys. "You&#xD;
can't be more surprised than I was, Miss K~th4&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
A MOR&#xD;
&#xD;
anne; for John started off without giving an~&#xD;
body a word of warning. It was a queer thin&#xD;
for Mrs. Gordon to send the child away-so fon&#xD;
of him as they say she is.-.and it was queer o&#xD;
John to take him; but, then, dear me! who&#xD;
isn't queer in this world? I told Richard las&#xD;
night that I shouldn't be surprised if ever&#xD;
thing came right at last. You know what&#xD;
mean; I don't like to mention names before th&#xD;
children."&#xD;
"Yes, I know what you mean. But is&#xD;
likely, do you think 1'"&#xD;
"If this don't look as if it is likely, Iwon&#xD;
der what would look so? Other people beside&#xD;
me think the same thing. I saw Mrs. Sloai&#xD;
yesterday, and she was telling me that Mrs&#xD;
Gordon-Katy, don't stand there drinking ix&#xD;
every word 1 say; go upstairs and see if Mm&#xD;
Tresham's room is all ready-that Mrs. Gordos&#xD;
has been going to see John at his office of late&#xD;
and, when a widow does that way, you know ii&#xD;
is apt to mean something. There are a greal&#xD;
many reports going about; but I know hoi~&#xD;
people talk, and I didn't pay much attention tc&#xD;
them till this about Felix came on me like s&#xD;
thunder-clap. Then I couldn't help believing.&#xD;
I am sure I never expected that matters would&#xD;
K        come to pass so that John could marry Pauline&#xD;
Morton-but this is a strange woridi"&#xD;
"When will Mr. Warwick be back?" asked&#xD;
Katharine.&#xD;
"Indeed, that's more than I can tell. He&#xD;
said nothing about it; and, since I don't know&#xD;
where he went, I can't even calculate whe~i h9's&#xD;
likely to be back. He left a note for you, which&#xD;
I was about to forget. Let me see-where did&#xD;
1 put it?"&#xD;
After considerable reflection, Mrs. Marks re-&#xD;
membered that she had put the note in her&#xD;
workbox, and drew it forth from among the&#xD;
spools and tape which filled that receptacle.&#xD;
Katharine, who restrained her impatience as&#xD;
well as she could, took it and opened it. This&#xD;
was what Mr. Warwick said:&#xD;
"DEA~l Miss TazsarAM: I find that I am un-&#xD;
expectedly obliged to leave home with Felix Gor-&#xD;
don. I shall endeavor to return within a fort.&#xD;
night. Will you go to see Mrs. Gordon and try&#xD;
to cheer her? She is suffering very much.&#xD;
"Yours truly,&#xD;
"JOHN WA.nwrcn."&#xD;
"Does he say any thing about when he's&#xD;
*    likely to be back?" asked Mrs. Marks, who was&#xD;
&#xD;
1~TING-CALL.                              123&#xD;
~. watching the governess's face attentively, and&#xD;
g secretly burning with curiosity to know what&#xD;
d her brother had written about.&#xD;
f "lie says he may return within a fortnight,"&#xD;
t answered Katharine, with her eyes still fastened&#xD;
it on the note. Then she held it out. "There&#xD;
y it is," she added; "you can see for yourself&#xD;
I what he says. It is not much. I will go and&#xD;
e take off my things."&#xD;
While Mrs. Marks eagerly read the note,&#xD;
t Katharine left the room and went upstairs,&#xD;
She found her chamber carefully arranged for&#xD;
her. Every thing looked fresh and bright, the&#xD;
a fire was burning, and on the table her ebriatmas&#xD;
~ presents were laid out in order. It seemed like&#xD;
a pleasant coming home, and gave her a sense&#xD;
of rest and relief after the gay dissipations of&#xD;
Anneadale. At another time she might have&#xD;
thought a little regretfully of all that was going&#xD;
on at the latter place; of how Mr. Langdon was&#xD;
just then throwing a great deal of sentimental&#xD;
expression into his voice and eyes as he talked&#xD;
to some young 'lady who sat in the bay.wind'oiv&#xD;
where she had herself sat yesterday; of how&#xD;
Miss Lester was playing billiards with Mr. Tal-&#xD;
cott; how Mrs. French was entertaining a lively&#xD;
group with disquisitions on private theatricals;&#xD;
and how the same people were loitering In ~e&#xD;
sanie places and saying the same things as on&#xD;
every day while she had been there. The habits&#xD;
of society are much the same on a small or on a&#xD;
large scale all the world over: Let a man drop&#xD;
out of his circle in Paris, and, even if he has&#xD;
been the brightest star in that circle, who misses&#xD;
him? So it is in every circle of every city, vfl.&#xD;
lage, or hamlet, throughout the world. Remain,&#xD;
and you are liked exactly according to yatir d@&#xD;
serts; go, and, whatever those deserts may have&#xD;
been, you are forgotten as speedily and as natur-&#xD;
ally as the events of yesterday yield in interest&#xD;
to the events of to.day. Until a cloud came&#xD;
over her brightness, Katharine had achieved&#xD;
quite a social success at Anneadale; but she&#xD;
had sufficient world experience to know that&#xD;
already she had sunk beneath the horizon, that&#xD;
others had taken her place, and that to-morrow&#xD;
people would even cease tosay, "Miss Tresharn&#xD;
did this," or "Miss Tresham did not do that."&#xD;
At a different moment such a reflection might&#xD;
have cost her a pang; but now she was too full&#xD;
of other subjects. Instead of thinking of the&#xD;
farewells of Messrs. Langdon and Talcott, she&#xD;
thought of Mr. Warwick and the note he had&#xD;
left behind. "What did he mean~?" she asked&#xD;
herself, and, receiving no satisfactory reply, wae&#xD;
&#xD;

124:                               MORTON&#xD;
still askIng~ when the door opened and Katy&#xD;
&#xD;
rushed in.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, there's a gentleman down-&#xD;
stairs, and mamma says will you please come&#xD;
down, he wants to see you."&#xD;
Poor Katharine! She had expected this,&#xD;
but not quite so soon-not quite so unexpect-&#xD;
edly.&#xD;
" Katy," she said, with a start,," who is it?&#xD;
,What is his name?"&#xD;
"He's a strange gentleman," answered Katy,&#xD;
decide4iy. "I don't know what his name is, and&#xD;
mamma didn't tell me. He came here once&#xD;
before, though."&#xD;
"To see me? "&#xD;
"Yes'm, while you was away.~~&#xD;
"Amen," said Katharine, under her breath.&#xD;
She mechanically took off her bonnet and shawl,&#xD;
smoothed her hair, and went down-stairs,&#xD;
In the passage she met Mrs. Marks, evidently&#xD;
much fluttered and excited.&#xD;
"A gentleman in the dining-room to see you,&#xD;
Miss Katharine," she said. "I asked him there&#xD;
because there was no fire in the parlor. You&#xD;
needn't be uneasy on my account," she, added,&#xD;
with a good-natured smile, "I am going into the&#xD;
kitchen anyhow. They ar~ trying out lard again&#xD;
tq~day, and I have to see about it. He's very&#xD;
good-loo~dng," she said, with a significant nod,&#xD;
as she went out of the backdoor.&#xD;
Katharine did not even smile. The conclu-&#xD;
sion to which Mrs. Marks had leaped was absurd&#xD;
enough; but she was not in the humor for the&#xD;
absurdity to Btrike her in a humorous light. On&#xD;
the contrary, she felt annoyed when ther~was no&#xD;
reasonable ground for annoyance. These sig-&#xD;
nificant looks and smiles jarred on her.&#xD;
"What fools people are!" she thought, with&#xD;
an impatience very unusual to he; as she went&#xD;
on aud opened the dining-room door.&#xD;
8t. John was standing with his back to the&#xD;
fire, looking moodily down .at the hearth-rug&#xD;
wben she entered. She saw at once that some-&#xD;
tl4ng was. wrong with him, pnd, unfortunately,&#xD;
was in no doubt concerning the nature of that&#xD;
something. He looked up when she entered,&#xD;
but did not move forward.&#xD;
"Well," he said, "have you heard the news?&#xD;
Do you know that she has sent off the child, and&#xD;
given me the slip?"&#xD;
"Yes, 1 know it," she answered, sitting down&#xD;
in the first chair she came to. "Hut what can ;r&#xD;
do? Why do you come and annoy me?"&#xD;
"That is always the cry !-always, why do I&#xD;
come and annoy you! I come because I choose&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A MORNING-CALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
125&#xD;
&#xD;
* HOUSES&#xD;
to do so," said he, angrily; "and because you&#xD;
may be able to help me in this business."&#xD;
"In what business?"&#xD;
"In finding out where Felix has been taken."&#xD;
"What is the use of such talk as this," said&#xD;
she, coldly. "Do you suppose I know any thing&#xD;
about it ?-or, if I did, do you suppose I would&#xD;
tell you?"&#xD;
"I suppose you can find out, if you choose,&#xD;
for the man who took him away lives, I am told,&#xD;
in this very house-and, I suppose that, if you&#xD;
don't choose, you may repent it," arfaw-ered he.&#xD;
"I don't want to hear any nonsense, Katharine.&#xD;
This is a matter of life and death to mc, and I&#xD;
will not be thwarted. You can find out where&#xD;
the child has been taken, and you shall do so."&#xD;
"I might show you whether or not I would,&#xD;
if there were any question of finding out," she&#xD;
answered. ~' But there is not. Even his own&#xD;
sister does not know where Mr. Watwick has&#xD;
gone."&#xD;
"She may say she does not-"&#xD;
"She says the truth. Don't think that every-&#xD;
body tells falsehoods, St. John."&#xD;
"Everybody tells them when it suits his con-&#xD;
venience," said St. John, coolly. "Do you sup-&#xD;
pose I don't know the world?"&#xD;
"Your own world-perhaps so."&#xD;
"The world is the same everywhere. If this&#xD;
woman does not know, her husband does."&#xD;
"No-he does not."&#xD;
"Then wait until the man comes back, and&#xD;
get the secret from him. What's the good of&#xD;
being a woman, and a pretty one," he addcd,&#xD;
with a sneer, "if you can't do such a thing?"&#xD;
"You don't know any thing about Mr. War-&#xD;
wick," she cried, indignantly. "If you did, you&#xD;
would know that no woman in the world could&#xD;
make him tell a thing that he wished to keep&#xD;
secret. And I would do any thing sooner than&#xD;
ask it of him. St. John, you are cruel 1"&#xD;
"You are a fool I" retorted St. John, short-&#xD;
ly. "I think there must be something between&#xD;
you and this lawyer," he went on, looking keenly&#xD;
at her. "If that is the case-"&#xD;
"I won't hear another word!" cried Kath-&#xD;
arine, losing temper, and somewhat dismaying&#xD;
him by the angry light that came into her eyes.&#xD;
"You are insulting me-~nd 1 will not listen to&#xD;
you. If I knew where Felix Gordon was this&#xD;
minute, I would die sooner than tell you!" she&#xD;
said, passionately. "You may be sure~f that."&#xD;
"I think I could make you sorry for it."&#xD;
"I have no doubt you could-but I would&#xD;
not do it!"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
There was silence in the room after thi&#xD;
St. John had not expected such a defiance, an&#xD;
it quite astonished him. He drummed on hi&#xD;
hat for some time, and knitted his brows, a&#xD;
he scowled at the 'girl, who sat before him lool&#xD;
ing pale and resolute.&#xD;
"Upon my word, I had not expected this,'&#xD;
said he, at last. "A charmingly affectionate pci&#xD;
son you are, Katharine, I iriust say I You'd di&#xD;
before you would obtain for me a certain iten&#xD;
of information about a person who cannot con&#xD;
cern you in the least! Will 'you tell me what ii&#xD;
the meaning of this sudden interest in Felix Gor&#xD;
don?"&#xD;
"I have no interest. But~I will not play th(&#xD;
spy at your bidding. I owe a debt of gratitude(&#xD;
to this place, and these people; and I do nol&#xD;
choose to repay it in such a form."&#xD;
"A debt of gratitude for allowing you to&#xD;
come and slave among them? Humph! your&#xD;
ideas of a cause for gratitude are singular, to&#xD;
say the least. You do owe somebody among&#xD;
them a certain sort of gratitude, though," he&#xD;
went on, with a peculiar si~ile. "Fray, what&#xD;
do you consider the most unfortunate thing&#xD;
that has befallen you lately?"&#xD;
"Your coming," she answered, unhesitating-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
"I thought so," said he, coolly. "Well, you&#xD;
asked me, when we first met, how I discovered&#xD;
your place of residence. I did 'not answer the&#xD;
question then, because it was irrelevant. It is&#xD;
relevant now, and I shall answer it with pleasure.&#xD;
First, however, do you know any one in a place&#xD;
galled Mobile?"&#xD;
"No one."&#xD;
"Have you ever been there ? "&#xD;
"Well, your 'address was forwarded to me-&#xD;
but stop! I will tell the story in order. There&#xD;
is nothing like method. Read that."&#xD;
He took out a pocket-book, opened it, and&#xD;
drew forth a slip of paper which he put into her&#xD;
hand. It was the Times advertisement that Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley had shown to Adela French.&#xD;
"Have you any idea who inserte~1 that?" he&#xD;
asked, watching her face, as she read it.&#xD;
Her eyes dilated with astonishment, her face&#xD;
paled until the very lips were white, and he was&#xD;
oreed to repeat his question, before she looked&#xD;
up and answered.&#xD;
"Idea !-no. Howshouldlhave? Idid not&#xD;
think there was any one in the world who would&#xD;
have done such a thing."&#xD;
*         "Do you think it was some on&amp;amp;here?"&#xD;

b&#xD;

s. "It must have been. I have never been&#xD;
.d anywhere else in America, and no one who was&#xD;
is not of Lagrange could have known any thing&#xD;
,s about the West Indies or CumberlandY&#xD;
" Those allusions prove that it is some one&#xD;
who knows you?"&#xD;
" "Yes, it is some one who knows me."&#xD;
"See if these will enable you to tell who it&#xD;
o is."&#xD;
Forth from the pocket-book came two let.&#xD;
- ters, and were placed in Katharine's hand. She&#xD;
took them, as she had taken the advertisement,&#xD;
- and glanced over them with compressed lips.&#xD;
When she finished, she laid them down on the&#xD;
table beside her, and looked at St. John.&#xD;
"I do not know who has written these," she&#xD;
said. "God forgive whoever it was-God grant&#xD;
that they may never have to endure such suffer-&#xD;
ing as they have brought ort me!"&#xD;
"That is cant," said he. "Of course, you&#xD;
* don't forgive them; and, of course, you can&#xD;
tell who the writer was. What, in a small cir-&#xD;
cle like this, not be able to place your finger at&#xD;
once upon the person! Tell me whom you&#xD;
know, and I will tell you who did it"&#xD;
"I do not know anybody who would have&#xD;
done it."&#xD;
"That only proves your ignorance of the&#xD;
world. Do you suspect me of forging those let-&#xD;
ters?"&#xD;
"Then they were certainly written by some-&#xD;
body who knows you, and whom you know.&#xD;
Common-sense might show you this. Tell me&#xD;
whom you least suspect, and I will tell you who&#xD;
did it."'&#xD;
"I cannot tell you. I-St. John, let me&#xD;
alone I', she cried, suddenly, but with an accent&#xD;
of almost heart-rending pathos. "I don't nn-&#xD;
derstand anything! I am heart-sick and weary.&#xD;
Don't-don't torment me I"&#xD;
"You know who wrote those letters," said&#xD;
St. John, watching her with unchanging scrutiny.&#xD;
"If you don't choose to tell me, well and good-&#xD;
I can find out for myself. You will be sorry for&#xD;
this want of confidence though, Katharine. I&#xD;
am your best friend."&#xD;
"May God give me my worst, then!" cried the&#xD;
girl, who was driven beyond all power of selfMcon~&#xD;
trol.&#xD;
"I have heard some rumors about you," pur-&#xD;
sued the immovable St. Johg. "It is quite use-&#xD;
less to try to deceive me-I should think you&#xD;
would have discovered that long before~this time.&#xD;

&#xD;
show me out of the grounds of the house where&#xD;
you were staying.the other day?"&#xD;
"I am going," said Katharine, rising and&#xD;
walking toward the door. "If you have only&#xD;
come to torment me as you used to do, I will&#xD;
not stay to afford you amusement. I am sick&#xD;
and weary-I am going."&#xD;
"I shall remain here until you come back,&#xD;
then."&#xD;
*      "St. John," cried she, facing round upon&#xD;
*   him, "what is the meaning of this ? You prom-&#xD;
ised me that,. after. I gave you some money, you&#xD;
would go; and you are here yet, to make life a&#xD;
burden to me."&#xD;
"I made no promises," said St. John, "and&#xD;
I will m~e none. But I tell you that I will&#xD;
come here every day until you find out-as you&#xD;
can, if you choose-where that boy has been&#xD;
taken to. I have written to Gordon, and he&#xD;
~~ll come, expecting to find the child here. If&#xD;
he is not here-if I cannot put my hand upon&#xD;
him-it will be worse than useless to have sum-&#xD;
moned him."&#xD;
"Write and tell him so."&#xD;
"No letter would reach him now."&#xD;
Katharine sank back into her chair, and&#xD;
gazed out of the window at the desolate garden&#xD;
which had been so fair and smiling on that No.&#xD;
vember evening when she first saw Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
don's face. She could have cried out upon the&#xD;
cruelty ~f all this, but where was the use? All&#xD;
the tears of Niobe could not have moved the&#xD;
man before her one hair's-breadth from his pur-&#xD;
pose~ The nether millstone is not half so hard&#xD;
as the selfish resolution of a selfish nature.&#xD;
*WhuI~ ~he wa~ atil hitting in hopeless silence,&#xD;
and St. John was still standing on the hearth-&#xD;
~eg wa~ting her reply, there came a stir in the&#xD;
passage outside, a movement of feet, a sound of&#xD;
voices, Miss Tresham's name audibly pronounced,&#xD;
and, before Katharine could ~nove forward, the&#xD;
door opo~ied, and Mrs. Gordon stood on the&#xD;
threshold!&#xD;
-"4--.&#xD;
OHAP~ER XXIV.&#xD;
OLD FOES.&#xD;
IT had been a relief to Mrs. Gordon to tell&#xD;
her story to Anne~ley, and the exhaustion con-&#xD;
sequent upon long and painful emotion had made&#xD;
her sleep heavily during that night-the first&#xD;
night after Felix had been parted from her. But&#xD;
who can paint the waking-the next day-the&#xD;
&#xD;
long watches of the next night? As hour after&#xD;
hour rolled by, she endured them in much the&#xD;
same passive fashion as that which had so much&#xD;
surprised Morton. But, on the third day, this&#xD;
endurance began to give way to restlessness.&#xD;
Babette, who went in and out on various pre-&#xD;
texts, and watched her anxiously, immediately&#xD;
perceived this. She had shortly before been to&#xD;
town on an errand, and she now bethought her.&#xD;
self of an expedient to interest her mistress.&#xD;
"Madame is not well," she said, planting her.&#xD;
self on the hearth~rng, with an air of determina-&#xD;
tion. "Madame is lonely - she should have&#xD;
company. As I was coming home, I met made.&#xD;
moiselle-the young lady who comes here with&#xD;
the children. Why should not madame send&#xD;
for her? She would cheer her up."&#xD;
"Nobody can cheer me up, Babette," said&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon, smiling faintly. "I am used to&#xD;
trouble, and I can bear it; but, as for cheer-&#xD;
that is a different matter. Don't talk of it."&#xD;
"Madame will be ill, if she is not ~cheered,"&#xD;
said Babette, obstinately. "If madame would&#xD;
only send for the ~voung lady-"&#xD;
"Is it Miss Tresham you are talking about?"&#xD;
asked Mrs. Gordon, languidly. "Did you say&#xD;
that you met her going into town?"&#xD;
"A short time ago, madame."&#xD;
"Well, you may send or stay-no, I will go&#xD;
myself. Order the carriage."&#xD;
"Madame!"&#xD;
"The carriage," repeated Mrs. Gordon, impa-&#xD;
tiently. "Don't you see that I must get out of&#xD;
this house or go crazy? I will go into Tallaho-&#xD;
ma, and bring Miss Tresham back to stay with&#xD;
me. You are right. ~he will do me good-if&#xD;
anybodycan."&#xD;
"But Monsieur St. Jean!" cried Babette, who&#xD;
was aghast. "If madame gpes into town, she&#xD;
may meet him."&#xD;
"lie cannot harm me," said madame, haugh-.&#xD;
tily, for she could aiford to be brave now that&#xD;
Felix was safely out of reach. "Go and order&#xD;
the carriage.&#xD;
Babette went at once; but, owing to the fact&#xD;
that the horses were out on the plantation, and&#xD;
had to be sent for, it was some time before the&#xD;
carriage came round. Mrs. Gordon's fit of rest-&#xD;
lessness had by that time partly s~bsided~ and&#xD;
she was half inclined to give up her intention, and&#xD;
merely send Babette with a note to bring Katha-&#xD;
rine. But Babette was of the opinion that it&#xD;
would be beneficial for madame to go herself, that&#xD;
a breath of the outer air would revive her, and&#xD;
the sight of the outer world be good fo~ her. In&#xD;

OLD FOES.&#xD;
&#xD;
cases where the mind has too long preyed on it-&#xD;
self, there is, indeed, no better prescription than&#xD;
this-simple as it seems. He must be very far&#xD;
gone in morbid gloom whom God's air, and God's&#xD;
sunshine, and the bright, rejoicing beauty of&#xD;
God's fair earth, cannot comfort, cannot help,&#xD;
cannot draw a little out of himself. Beguiled by&#xD;
the persuasions of her faithful attendant, Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon at last consented to go. The French-&#xD;
wc~man put her into the carriage, and saw her&#xD;
drive off; with great self-congratulation. It is&#xD;
possible that this self.congratulation might have&#xD;
been slightly changed if she had only known who&#xD;
it was that her mistress had gone to meet.&#xD;
On her way to Tallahoma, Mrs. Gordon was a&#xD;
little diverted from the subject of her own trou-&#xD;
bles, by thinking of the pleasure Qf bringing&#xD;
Katharine back to Morton House with her. She&#xD;
felt certain that Mrs. Marks would not object, for&#xD;
Mr. Warwick's last words had advised something&#xD;
like this, and she thought it probable that he&#xD;
might have spoken to his sister on the subject.&#xD;
She liked the girl-liked her bright face, her&#xD;
frank bearing, her sunny smile-and she felt&#xD;
thi~t it would be a great relief to see her moving&#xD;
bout Morton House, and lighting up the' gloom&#xD;
with her graceful youth, instead of poor Babette's&#xD;
V ~       long face and ready tears. As she was drawing&#xD;
this half-unconscious picture,'Katharine was go.&#xD;
ing down to meet St. John, with a very pale face,&#xD;
and a very heavy heart, making quite a contrast&#xD;
to the girl whom Mrs. Gordon had seen last-&#xD;
the girl who even then was pictured in Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
don's mind.&#xD;
When the carriage drew up before~ the Marks&#xD;
house, two or three children were playing in the&#xD;
yard. They all stopped, and stared open-mouthed,&#xD;
as Mrs. Gordon descended. When it was evi-&#xD;
dent that she intended to enter the gate, they&#xD;
~         immediately took flight, and ran Cull tilt to the&#xD;
kitchen-rushing headlong through the door1 and&#xD;
very nearly tumbling into a pot of boiling lard.&#xD;
"Mamma, here's a carriage, and a lady com-&#xD;
ing in!" cried Katy, who was first.&#xD;
"Mamma, it's a lady in black-.-.-I think it's&#xD;
Felix's mother," panted Sara, who was second..&#xD;
"Mammi-lady tummin," said 'Nelly, who&#xD;
as last.&#xD;
"A lady in black I-Felix's mother! Good'&#xD;
acious!" e~ried' Mrs. Mark's. "Itumi, Letty, and&#xD;
sk her in-in the parlor, mind. I'll be there&#xD;
n a minute. Get away, children, and let me take&#xD;
this apron. Good ~acious l-who was to&#xD;
hunk-"&#xD;
While Mrs. Marks was ~isstily untying her&#xD;
&#xD;
127&#xD;
&#xD;
apron, and Letty was 'running full speed to the&#xD;
house, Mrs. Gordon walked up to the front door,&#xD;
and was about to knock, when Jack came rush.&#xD;
ing down-stairs. He, h~u~ beeu to the sehogl-&#xD;
room to get sonie~ string for his kite, and was&#xD;
on his way back to the place where he had left&#xD;
that valuable article of property, when he was&#xD;
thus unexpectedly brought ~f~e@ to face with a&#xD;
strange lady. Fortunately, he was not at all&#xD;
troubled with diffidence; so he went forward,&#xD;
and, when Mrs. Gordon asked if Miss Tresham&#xD;
was at home, at once responded in the prompt-&#xD;
est manner imaginable~.&#xD;
"Yes'rn, Miss ~resham's at home-she got&#xD;
home a little while ago. She's in the dining-&#xD;
roon~, I believe."&#xD;
"Can I see her?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes'ni-..walk in. This way, please."&#xD;
His hand was on the lock of the' dining.&#xD;
room door, when,, enter Letty on t~ie scene.-&#xD;
panting and almost breathless.&#xD;
"Not that way, Mass Jack;" cried she, eager-&#xD;
ly. "Ask the lady in the parlor. This way,&#xD;
ma'am"&#xD;
She hurried forward ,to the parlor.door, and&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon half turned 'to follow her, when&#xD;
Jack, who was always at feud with Letty,~asserted&#xD;
hit superior knowledge.&#xD;
"The lady wants to see Miss Tre4ias~'sai~l&#xD;
he, in a loud voice, "and Miss. Treshani aln't in&#xD;
the parlor, she's in here. There slip is~ ~iow~he&#xD;
added, triumphantly~ as he threw open the IoOr~&#xD;
and revealed 'Katharine; whoAwas sitting gn~o$&#xD;
immediately in front of, it.&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon saw her, and at once adv~ia~e4.&#xD;
into the room. ~he did not see St. ,Jnh~j who&#xD;
was out of her range of vision, so she hogan&#xD;
speaking, as she crossed the floor.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, I hope you will excus~me-~."&#xD;
Here she stopped suddenly~ ~omething in&#xD;
Katharine's face startled her, end made herlook  4&#xD;
round. Then she saw her con~panion.&#xD;
To describe the change that passed ever her&#xD;
would be impossible. If shebad expected to see&#xD;
him, if she had thought there was even the least&#xD;
reason to fear a meeting with him, she would&#xD;
have prepared for it-being ~ proud woman, and&#xD;
one who would suft~er any thing sooner than let&#xD;
an enemy ret~d her weakness. But, as it was, she&#xD;
had no time for preparaflon. When she turned&#xD;
and saw that so well-remembered, that so bitter-&#xD;
ly-hated face, it was as if a sudden, brutal blow&#xD;
had been dealt to her. She gave a sharp cry,&#xD;
and covered her own face with her hands.&#xD;
The door was still open, and Jack and Letty&#xD;

&#xD;
OLD FOES.                           129&#xD;
&#xD;
were holding an altercation in the passage, which&#xD;
tilled up, strangely enough, the interval that fol-&#xD;
'lowed.&#xD;
"Never mind, Mass Jack-.-I'll tell mistis.&#xD;
Putting' yourself forward when she told me to ask&#xD;
the lady in the parlor!"&#xD;
4L You mind your own business-I'll tell mam-&#xD;
ma myself. The lady asked ~or Miss Tresharn,&#xD;
an~ I wasn't a-going to show her in the parlor.&#xD;
There ain't any fire in there, either."&#xD;
This was what came into the room, while&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon clasped her hands over her face, St.&#xD;
John stood undecided what to do or say, and&#xD;
Katharine felt a despair which bordered closely&#xD;
upon recklessness. She could have laughed, or&#xD;
she could have cried; but, instead of doing&#xD;
either of the two, she heard, with the. odd dou-&#xD;
ble consciousness that came to her in moments&#xD;
of excitement, the recrimination in the passage,&#xD;
and evei~ Qaught the angry whisk of Letty's dress&#xD;
as she departed.&#xD;
Nevertheless, Katharine waS the first who&#xD;
reedvered self-possession. Seeing that St. John&#xD;
was about to speak, she silenced him by a&#xD;
glance, and walked up to Mrs. Gordon.&#xD;
"Will you let me take you into the other&#xD;
room?" she said, gently. "I am very sorry&#xD;
for-for this."&#xD;
The sound' of her voice seemed at once to&#xD;
restore Mrs. Gordon to herself. She looked up&#xD;
with a start. Then her whole face changed-&#xD;
petrified, as it were-and she drew back, so that&#xD;
not even her dress might touch the girl-drew&#xD;
back as she might have drawn back from a scor-&#xD;
pion.&#xD;
"So it was you!" she said. And her voice&#xD;
was so cold and hard, so changed in timbre, that&#xD;
it made Katharine shrink.&#xD;
"What was me?" she asked,"as the other&#xD;
paused and said no more. "I do not under-&#xD;
stand. What was me?"&#xD;
"It was you who gave the clew to my place&#xD;
of refuge," answered Mrs. Gordon, with the same&#xD;
repellent coldness of voice and manner. "I&#xD;
see it all now. I was foolish enough to like you&#xD;
-to welcome you into my house-to encourage&#xD;
my cousin in his love for you-and you gave me&#xD;
this return I Thank you, Miss Tresham-.--thank&#xD;
you for proving to me once more that the wisest&#xD;
person in the world is the person who neither&#xD;
gives nor hopes to receive regard."&#xD;
'~St. John," said Katharine, turning round,&#xD;
"do you hear this? Do you stand by and say&#xD;
not one word to exonerate me from such an ac-&#xD;
eusation?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"What can I say?" asked St. John, care-&#xD;
lessly. "Mrs. Gordon ought to know that she&#xD;
is talking nonsense-that, if you had told me a&#xD;
dozen times ovcr where she was, she had no claim&#xD;
upon you to make such an act any thing but&#xD;
natural.-But Miss Tresham did not tell me," he&#xD;
added, turning to Mrs. Gordon. "I came here&#xD;
in total ignorance of your having chosen this&#xD;
as a place of residence. After I discovered the&#xD;
fact, it was my duty to inform your husband; and~&#xD;
that duty I fulfilled."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," said Mrs. Gordon,&#xD;
addressing Katharine with her utmost stateli-&#xD;
ness of tone and bearing. "I had no right to&#xD;
speak to you as I did a moment ago. I am not&#xD;
by nature a patient woman, and trouble has&#xD;
tried me severely. I hope you will let this&#xD;
plead my excuse. As Mr. St. John said, it is&#xD;
certainly true that I have no claim upon you&#xD;
-no right to hope that you would respect my&#xD;
unfortunate position sufficiently to refrain from&#xD;
betraying me to-to-"&#xD;
She stopped, gasped slightly, as if threatened&#xD;
with suffocation, and her hand went up to her&#xD;
throat. Before Katharine could speak, however,&#xD;
she went on:&#xD;
"I ought to apologize for this intrusion.&#xD;
When I entered the room, I thought you were&#xD;
alone. I came to see you, to ask you to return&#xD;
to Morton House with me, to beg you to cheer&#xD;
the solitude which Felix's absence has made so&#xD;
dreary. After this meeting, I shall not press that&#xD;
request. I shall only bid you good-morning.~~&#xD;
She bowed slightly, drew her veil over her&#xD;
face, and turned to leave the room-a "grand&#xD;
lady,~~ unmistakably, and, so far, commanding&#xD;
much the best of the situation.&#xD;
But at this point Katharine spoke, her clear,&#xD;
quiet tones seizing Mrs. Gordon's attention, and,&#xD;
almost perforce, arresting Mrs. Gordon's steps.'&#xD;
"If you will allow me, madam, I have a few&#xD;
words to say in my defence. It seems that you&#xD;
disbelieve Mr. St. Johii's assertion. Will you&#xD;
disbelieve mine when I tell you that I did not&#xD;
bring him here, and that I knew nothing of his&#xD;
acquaintance with you until he himself informed&#xD;
meof it?"&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon turned, and raised her veil&#xD;
again. The two women faced each other for a&#xD;
minute before the elder spoke-spoke with a&#xD;
certain quiet contempt in her voice.&#xD;
"1 confess that your question seems to me&#xD;
unnecessary, Miss Tresham. Having granted&#xD;
your right to inform Mr. St. John of my place&#xD;
of abode, I can see no reason for uselessly pro-&#xD;
&#xD;
)&#xD;
&#xD;
longing this discussion. Why should it matter&#xD;
to you whether or not I believe you to have&#xD;
done so?"&#xD;
Katharine flushed at the tone; but she con-&#xD;
trolled herself, and held to her point with steady&#xD;
dignity.&#xD;
"Unnecessary or not, will you be kind enough&#xD;
to answer my question?"&#xD;
"If you force me to speak, I must answer,&#xD;
then, that I do believe it."&#xD;
"In the face of my assertion to the con-&#xD;
trary?"&#xD;
"In the face of any assertion given by any&#xD;
friend of Mr. St. John's."&#xD;
Hot words leaped to Katharine's lips; but&#xD;
she held them back. Even at this moment she&#xD;
had sufficient strength of will to restrain herself&#xD;
-to remember that he who loses temper loses&#xD;
many things besides, and that angry rejoinder&#xD;
never yet helped a cause. She had a hard fight&#xD;
for self-control; but she fought' it bravely, and&#xD;
after a minute she was able to command her voice&#xD;
sufficiently to reply.&#xD;
- "I am your debtor, Mrs. Gordon, for the first&#xD;
direct insult that was ever offered to me in my&#xD;
life. I asked your attention before as a cour-&#xD;
tesy; I demand it now as a right. You have&#xD;
seen fit to charge me with falsehood with regard&#xD;
to a matter in which, according to your own ad-&#xD;
mission, I should have no reason to deny the&#xD;
truth. I will now prove to you that you have&#xD;
done so without a shadow of just cause."&#xD;
She walked across the floor, and took the&#xD;
Times advertisement from the table where she&#xD;
had laid it.&#xD;
"Will you read this?" she said, coming back&#xD;
and offering it to Mrs. Gordon.&#xD;
"I cannot imagine-" began the latter,&#xD;
haughtily.&#xD;
"Read it," said Katharine, interrupting her&#xD;
with grave resolution.&#xD;
So constrained, Mrs. Gordon took the slip of&#xD;
paper and read:&#xD;
"If the friends or relations of Katharine&#xD;
Tresham, formerly of the British West Indies,&#xD;
and lately of Cumberland, England, are desirous&#xD;
of knowing her present whereabouts and address,&#xD;
they can obtain this information by addressing&#xD;
R. G., Box 1,084, Mobile, Alabama."&#xD;
Having read it, she looked up.&#xD;
"I confess that I do not understand this,"&#xD;
she said.&#xD;
"Perhaps these will enable you to do so,"&#xD;
&#xD;
answered Katha:ine, offering the letters in&#xD;
turn.&#xD;
The first one which Mrs. Gordon opened-the&#xD;
one which chanced to be the last, and in which&#xD;
the writer gave Miss Tresham's address, and&#xD;
asked information concerning her for "person-&#xD;
al and family" reasons-startled her no little.&#xD;
11cr eyes had scarcely fallen on the writing be-&#xD;
fore she changed color. As she read on, her&#xD;
face assumed an expression which puzzled Kath-&#xD;
arine. It did not puzzle St. John, however.&#xD;
Still master of himself, and quietly biding his&#xD;
time, he coolly watched Mrs. Gordon, and coolly&#xD;
arrived at a conclusion.&#xD;
"She either knows or strongly suspects who&#xD;
is the writer," he said to himself. "I shall re-&#xD;
member that."&#xD;
After Mrs. Gordon finished reading the letter,&#xD;
she stood for some tim~ with it in her hand,&#xD;
apparently deep in thought. Then she roused&#xD;
herself, and opened the other. She merely&#xD;
glanced over this, folded it up, and turned to&#xD;
Katharine.&#xD;
"Miss Treshain," she said, with formal courte-&#xD;
sy, "I apologize. I see that you were not the&#xD;
person who brought Mr. St. John to Lagrange,&#xD;
and I retract my assertion to that effect. Are&#xD;
you satisfied?"&#xD;
"I am satisfied, madam," answered Katha-&#xD;
rine, as coldly as herself.&#xD;
"Will you allow me, then, to inq~uire~if you&#xD;
have any idea who inserted this advertisement&#xD;
and wrote these letters?"&#xD;
"I have not the least idea."&#xD;
Here St. John made a step forward, and was&#xD;
aboht to speak, when Mrs. Marks appeared at the&#xD;
still open door, in her best company dress and&#xD;
with her best company smile.&#xD;
"I heard that Mrs. Gordon was here," said&#xD;
she, advancing into the room, "and I could&#xD;
not help coming to-" Here the good woman&#xD;
stopped, awed, amazed, by the face that looked&#xD;
at her, overpowered by a sudden rush of feeling&#xD;
which swept away all thought of conventional&#xD;
greeting or conventional compliments. "0 Miss&#xD;
Pauline I It can't be Miss Pauline I" she cried,&#xD;
with an almost pitiful astonishment in her voice.&#xD;
*" 1-1-0 Mrs. Gordon I excuse me, but such a&#xD;
change-"&#xD;
"You, at least, are not changed," said Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon, extending her hand. "The same Bessie&#xD;
Warwick that I knew once-the same BeSsie&#xD;
Warwick, with the same honest face. Will you&#xD;
take me somewhere-anywhere-so that I sian&#xD;
speak to you alone?" she went on, much to Mrs.&#xD;

looking in bewildered surprise from Katharine&#xD;
t~o St. Johnand from St. John to Mrs. Gordon&#xD;
"I told Letty to make a fire in the parlor; but]&#xD;

confusion, for the children make such a litter&#xD;

"Anywhere," said Mrs. Gordon, faintly. Al.&#xD;

was failing, and the room was growing black be-&#xD;
fore her eyes. "I am ready," she added.&#xD;
She took Mrs. Marks's arm as a support, and&#xD;
turned to leave the room, but before she had&#xD;
made thre9 steps, St. John stood before' her-&#xD;
barring the only mode of egress.&#xD;
"It is quite useless for you to think that you&#xD;
can carry off matters in this way with rue, Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon," he said, in a tone of contemptuous&#xD;
amusement. "I understand, from various ru-&#xD;
mets, that you have sent Felix away, and that&#xD;
you intend to conceal his place of residence, as&#xD;
y~u have already concealed your own, from his&#xD;
father. Individually, I have no right to inter-&#xD;
fere with your plans; but I think it well to in-&#xD;
form you that your husband"-she shrank at the&#xD;
word-.-" will be here in a short time, and that he&#xD;
will use every means to discover the child, and to&#xD;
punish, with the utmost rigor of the law, those&#xD;
who have aided you in concealing him."&#xD;
"Oh!" cried poor Mrs. Marks, and turned a&#xD;
glance on. Mrs. Gordon, as i? to say, '"(Jan this&#xD;
be true&#xD;
But Mrs. Gordon did not heed the glance.&#xD;
~t. John's tones and words had waked all the&#xD;
fire of combat within her-all the haughty spirit&#xD;
of resistance which years of tyranny had failed&#xD;
to subdue.&#xD;
"Tell the man for whbm you are acting," she&#xD;
*       said, with rtll languor gone from her face, and all&#xD;
weakness from her voice, "that if he is wise,&#xD;
he wiU spare himselfthe trouble of coming here;&#xD;
for no human power shall over make me see him&#xD;
agaIn. Tell him that Felinis safe from him; and.&#xD;
that those who have the child in charge, are&#xD;
neither' so poor nor so weak as to be frightened&#xD;
bytlireats of any penalty which it is in his power&#xD;
to lnffict~ Tell him, alse," she added, with a&#xD;
sudden flash in her eyes that absolutely made&#xD;
St. John recoil a step, "that he had better think&#xD;
twl~e before he comes'to seek the sister of Alfred&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
r Morton in her own home, and among her own kin-&#xD;
, dred. I have oirly to speak, and there are men&#xD;
here who would ask nothing better than to take&#xD;
1 the matter of vengeance into their own hands."&#xD;
"You know your husband, madam," said St.&#xD;
John, quietly. "You know whether such threats&#xD;
as that are likely to influence him."&#xD;
"As for you," she went on, with passion so&#xD;
intense that it made her whole frame quiver,&#xD;
and her voice rise to that infinite height of&#xD;
tragic emotion which only the greatest actors&#xD;
have ever been able to imitate, "if I have&#xD;
spared you, it has been because I recognized the&#xD;
* fact that you are simply a tool, and, consequent-&#xD;
* ly, that you arc below any thing save contempt.&#xD;
But if you trouble me again, I say to you, as I&#xD;
* said of him~ that there are men who would ask&#xD;
nothing better than to rid me of you summarily.&#xD;
* You will do well to remember this!"&#xD;
"' If your friends will be kind enough to call&#xD;
on me, madam," said St. John, with superb cool-&#xD;
~iess, "I shall be happy to receive them. I can&#xD;
make tkem accountable for the words you have&#xD;
just addressed to me, because I have endeavored,&#xD;
as your husband's friend, to serve his interests."&#xD;
"My dear Mrs. Gordon, let-let inc take you&#xD;
to my room," said~Mrs. Miirks, breaking in here&#xD;
with a half-bewildered tone of expostulation. "I&#xD;
-had no idea of any thing like this, or I should&#xD;
not have come in. If this gentleman will move&#xD;
aside-"&#xD;
The gentleman moved aside in acknowledg-&#xD;
ment of this request; but Mrs. Gordon stood&#xD;
still-the glow was yet on her face, and it was&#xD;
evident that she had yet something to say. This&#xD;
time she addressed herself to Mrs. Marks:&#xD;
"I wished to speak to you in priv~" she&#xD;
said; "but it is not worth while. The warning&#xD;
which I desired to give you-which it is my&#xD;
duty to give you-had better be spoken in the&#xD;
presence of the person against whom it is&#xD;
directed. I find Mr. St. John apparently at&#xD;
home in your house. I do not know how long&#xD;
this has been the case, nor how long it is likely&#xD;
to continue; but I warn you that, if you were&#xD;
aware of his real character, he wonld not remain&#xD;
within your doors five minutes. I speak of this&#xD;
charaeter,'beeause I know it to my cost. lie&#xD;
is the unprincipled inetruinent of another man&#xD;
whom it is my misfortune to call my husband.&#xD;
Miss Tresham has sufficiently shown that she has&#xD;
some close connection with him. What that&#xD;
connection is, it does not concern me to inquire.&#xD;
Whether or not it concerns you, is a matter&#xD;
which I leave for yourself to decide."&#xD;
&#xD;
II&#xD;
40&#xD;
&#xD;
"Miss Katharine!" cried Mrs. Marks, with&#xD;
one great culminating gasp of astonishment.&#xD;
She turned and looked at her governess with an&#xD;
air of appeal. Plainly she meant to say, "An-&#xD;
swer for yourself."&#xD;
But, as it chanced, Mrs. Gordon's last words&#xD;
had tried Katharine's patience to its utmost limit.&#xD;
She had, so far, curbed herself steadily-wonder-&#xD;
fully, in fact, considering how much she had&#xD;
borne before Mrs. Gordon's entrance, and how&#xD;
much she had been called upon to endure since&#xD;
then-but the last tones of scorn roused her as&#xD;
she had not been roused before. She answered&#xD;
Mrs. Marks's looks, therefore, by a few haughty&#xD;
&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"Mrs. Gordon is perfectly right," she said.&#xD;
"My connection with Mr. St. John does not con-&#xD;
cern her in the least. I decline to explain it in&#xD;
her presence.~~&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon showed her appreciation of this&#xD;
reply with admirable temper and dignity.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham reminds me that I have not&#xD;
yet said good-morning," she remarked. "Will&#xD;
you allow me to say it at once, and to add that&#xD;
I shall be glad to see you at Morton House?"&#xD;
She shook hands cordially with Mrs. Marks,&#xD;
bowed distantly to Katharine, and left the room.&#xD;
Mrs. Marks foilowe~ her, and, during the few&#xD;
minutes which ensued, St. John was able to&#xD;
say:&#xD;
"Was there ever any thing as unlucky as&#xD;
that she should have found me here? If you&#xD;
had gone with her, you could have discovered&#xD;
every thing."&#xD;
"You have only yourself to thank that she&#xD;
found you here," Katharine answered. "But, so&#xD;
far as I am concerned, it does not matter-I&#xD;
should not have gone with her."&#xD;
"Why not?"&#xD;
"You know why not, St. John. I should&#xD;
only have laid myself open to the imputation of&#xD;
doing what you wish me to do, of being what&#xD;
you wish me to be-that Is, a&#xD;
At this point, Mrs. Marks came back through&#xD;
the passage-having parted with Mrs. Gordon on&#xD;
the front piazza. She saw the dining-room door&#xD;
still open, and hesitated a moment. Evidently&#xD;
curiosity said, "Enter;" evidently, also, discre-&#xD;
tion said, "Pass on;" and, between the two,&#xD;
she stood irresolute. Seeing her irresolution,&#xD;
St. John astonished Katharine by stepping for-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
"Will you ~come in, madam?" he asked.&#xD;
"In my own defence, and that of Miss Tresham,&#xD;
I should like to say a few words to you."&#xD;
&#xD;
OLD FOES.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Marks came in-nowise loatii.-but Kath-&#xD;
arine hardly saw her. It was now her turn to feel&#xD;
faint and sick-for the room to go round in a&#xD;
sort of black mist. Through this mist, she heard&#xD;
St. John speak as if he had been a great way&#xD;
off.&#xD;
"Since you know Mrs. Gordon, madam, you&#xD;
must be aware that she is of a very excitable&#xD;
and impulsive disposition. This fact will ac-&#xD;
count tor her unprovoked attack on Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am and on myself. I came to this place in igno-&#xD;
rance of her being here; but, as a friend of her&#xD;
husband, I could not conceal from him that the&#xD;
wife for whom he has been searching all over&#xD;
Europe is in America. One does not expect&#xD;
reason from an angry woman; but you heard&#xD;
how unjustly she assailed mc, on account of&#xD;
this act of disinterested friendship. As for Miss&#xD;
Tresham, I will not insult her by offering to-"&#xD;
"But is it really true?" asked Mrs. Marks,&#xD;
mercilessly interrupting this flow of language.&#xD;
"Is there really no doubt that Mrs. Gordon has&#xD;
a husband living? I-that is, we thought her a&#xD;
widow."&#xD;
"There is no doubt, madam, that her hus-&#xD;
band is living, and that she left him in the&#xD;
most-"&#xD;
Here Katharine rose and came forward.&#xD;
"St. John, that is enough," she said. "Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon's domestic troubles cannot~ interest Mrs.&#xD;
Marks. Will you go now? I do not think I&#xD;
can stand this any longer."&#xD;
She spoke quietly, but with a certain deter-&#xD;
mination which, almost against his will, St. John&#xD;
obeyed. He started, looked at her face, and, see-&#xD;
ing the resolution of the eyes that met his own,&#xD;
went to the mantel-piece for the hat he had left&#xD;
there.&#xD;
"I will go, certainly," he said; "but I must&#xD;
see you again. When can that be?"&#xD;
"I don't know," sh~ answered, wearily. "I&#xD;
shall begin teaching on Monday, and-"&#xD;
"I should like to see you before Monday."&#xD;
"Come when you choose, then-that Is, if&#xD;
Mrs. Marks does not object."&#xD;
"Certainly not," said Mrs. Marks. "I am&#xD;
always glad for any of Miss Katharine's friends&#xD;
to come to see her, and if Mr."-she stepped&#xD;
and looked at Katharine.&#xD;
"Mr. St. John," said Katharine, in reply to&#xD;
the look.&#xD;
"If Mr. St. John will come to tea this evea~&#xD;
ing, we shall be very glad to see him."&#xD;
"Thank you, madam," said Mr. St. John,&#xD;
speaking for himself. "I am very grateful for&#xD;

132                       MORTON ROUSE.                                                               MORTON'S CHOICE.                     133&#xD;
&#xD;
your kind invitation, but I regret to say that I am&#xD;
unable to accept it. I have business-letters of&#xD;
importance to write to-day, and I do not think&#xD;
[shall be able to finish them in time to do my.&#xD;
self the pleasure of coming.~~&#xD;
"To-morrow evening-" began hospitable&#xD;
Mrs. Marks; but St. John had already turned&#xD;
away, and was speaking to Katharine in a tone&#xD;
too low for her to hear his words. As Miss&#xD;
Tresham replied, the coldness of her manner&#xD;
struck Mrs. Marks so much that she stopped&#xD;
short ~n her second invitation. She had sup-&#xD;
posed that this handsome gentleman must be a&#xD;
favored suitor, but now she began to change her&#xD;
mind. He was a lover.-Oh, dear! evidently a&#xD;
lover, or he would never have spoken in that&#xD;
voice, and with that manner-but a rejected,&#xD;
perhaps a hopeless lover, poor fellow I His&#xD;
devotion touched her, but she was too close an&#xD;
observer not to see at once that his cause was&#xD;
doomed to failure. Men are sometimes deceived&#xD;
by the coldness of a woman, are sometimes un-&#xD;
able to tell whether this coldness is that which&#xD;
betrays dislike; or that which conceals love; but&#xD;
you never find another woman who is so blind.&#xD;
Mrs. Marks saw at once that there was no hope&#xD;
for Mr. St. John; and, although she felt sorry for.&#xD;
him, although she would have liked to do some-&#xD;
thing to console him, still she had sufficient dis-&#xD;
cretion to feel that the invitation to tea had bet-&#xD;
ter not be pressed. When he took leave, she&#xD;
threw a good deal of respectful sympathy into her&#xD;
manner; and, after he was gone, she would have&#xD;
opened fire at once on Katharine, if Katharine&#xD;
had not anticipated any address on her part, by&#xD;
coming and putting her arms around her.&#xD;
"You are very good to me," she said, sim-&#xD;
ply, "I am very glad you did not let Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
don prejudice you against me. But do not ask&#xD;
Mr. St. John here again, Mrs. Marks. I do not&#xD;
think Mr. Warwick iVould like it,"&#xD;
"I hope I'm mistress in my own house, my&#xD;
dear," said Mrs. Marks, a little stiffly. Then she&#xD;
softened, hnd kissed the girl. "I won't, of&#xD;
course, if ~you say not-it was only because he&#xD;
was a friend of yours that I asked him. I can&#xD;
see that he cares a great deal for you, and that&#xD;
he hasn't much in the way of hope to thank you&#xD;
for. B~t I don't see what John has to do with&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick is Mrs. Gordon's friend, and,&#xD;
naturally, he will take her side, and look on her&#xD;
cause as-as she does. I don't mean to defend&#xD;
Mr. St. John," she went on, hnvriedly. "I don't&#xD;
mean that they may not be right; but still, I&#xD;
&#xD;
should like to see him sometimes, as long as he&#xD;
stays here, if you don't object."~&#xD;
"My dear, I don't object in the least," said&#xD;
the elder woman, kindly. "Don't be afraid of&#xD;
my being prejudiced by Pauline Murton. I&#xD;
know how quick and fiery she always used to be.&#xD;
As for you, I would trust you with-with a mint&#xD;
of money, if I had it."&#xD;
"You have trusted me with the children, and&#xD;
they are worth tea mints of money," said Katha-&#xD;
rine, smiling faintly. Then she disengaged her-&#xD;
self, and went np-stairs.&#xD;
An hour or two afterward, Mrs. Marks was&#xD;
in the dining-room, where Tom was busy setting&#xD;
the table, when she was startled by the appear-&#xD;
ance of Miss Tresham, who entered all cloaked&#xD;
and bonneted as if for a journey, and with a&#xD;
small travelling-bag on her arm.&#xD;
* "Mrs. Marks," she said, "will you lend me&#xD;
a little money ?-ten dollars will do. I find I&#xD;
have none in my purse, and I want to catch the&#xD;
coach, and go over to Saxford. I cannot be&#xD;
back until Monday evening, and that will prevent&#xD;
my beginning school until Tuesday; but I hope&#xD;
you won't mind it."&#xD;
"No-I won't mind it," said Mrs. Marks, a&#xD;
little taken aback. She thought Miss Tresham&#xD;
was growing very eccentric, for she had been to&#xD;
Saxford only the week before Chrisunas, and now&#xD;
to go again so soon, was quite unprecedented&#xD;
and singular, to say the least. She did not&#xD;
think of refusing her consent, however; but, on&#xD;
the contrary, searched diligently for her purse in&#xD;
the depths of a capacious pocket.&#xD;
"It's late to be thinking of going, Miss&#xD;
Katharine," she said. "The stage is due for&#xD;
dinner, you know; and I'm afraid you'll hardly&#xD;
catch it now. Give Tom your bag, and~ he can&#xD;
put some ham and biscuit in it, for you won't be&#xD;
able to stay for dinner. Will two five-dollar&#xD;
notes do? I haven't a ten."&#xD;
"Two five-dollar notes will do very well," said&#xD;
Katharine "Thank you, and good-by. Kiss the&#xD;
children for me-I really have not time tb see&#xD;
them. That will do, Tom-give me my bag&#xD;
now."&#xD;
She took the bag, kissed Mrs. Marks, and was&#xD;
out of the door before that astonished woman&#xD;
had time to collect her senses. When she did,&#xD;
her first exclamation was:&#xD;
"What will Richard say?"&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
Morton chanced to be standing near Irene&#xD;
Vernon when he read this, and his change of&#xD;
color at once struck that young lady, who was a&#xD;
very close observer.&#xD;
"Nothing is the matter, 1 hope, Mr. Annes-&#xD;
Icy?" she said, as he looked up and met her&#xD;
answered he, a little hesitatingly.&#xD;
Then he glanced down at the note again, and&#xD;
went on: "Nothing is the matter, I hope; but I&#xD;
must go at once to Morton House. My cousin&#xD;
has sent for me."&#xD;
"Oh, how provoking! What will become of&#xD;
our ride this afternoon?"&#xD;
"I am obliged to ask you to defer it. You&#xD;
won't care, will you? I am very sorry, but"-&#xD;
"But, if it must be done, that is an end of4he&#xD;
matter. The weather may be as delightful to-&#xD;
morrow as it is to-day. At all events, don't&#xD;
consider me, if your cousin has sent for you."&#xD;
"You are the embodiment of obliging good-&#xD;
ness," said Morton, gratefully. Then, to the ser-&#xD;
vant still standing by, "My horse."&#xD;
While the horse was being brought out, the&#xD;
young man curbed his impatience as well as he&#xD;
could- and, to enable him to do so, took Miss&#xD;
Vernon partially into his confidence. He did&#xD;
not tell her all of Mrs. Gordon's story, but he&#xD;
told her enough to account for his abrupt depart-&#xD;
ure, and to enlist her sympathy. After a while&#xD;
they wandered from this immediate subject to&#xD;
certain side issues.&#xD;
"There is one thing that might console your&#xD;
cousin a little," said Miss Vernon, as they&#xD;
walked up and down the piazza, with the soft&#xD;
air and the bright sunshine all around them.&#xD;
"She has gratified the wishes and fulfilled the&#xD;
desires of her heart. It is not given to every-&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
MORTON'S CHOICE.&#xD;
Tim morning on which Miss Tresham left&#xD;
Annesdale was wearing into noon, when a note&#xD;
from Mrs. Gordon was brought to Mr. Annesley.&#xD;
It was written after her return from Tallahoma,&#xD;
and was brief, to the extreme of epistolary brev-&#xD;
ity.&#xD;
"MORToN Ilousz, Friday morning.&#xD;
"DEAn MORTON: Come to me as soon as pos-&#xD;
sible-at once, if that be possible. I have some-&#xD;
thing of importance to say to you. Yours,&#xD;
"PAULINE GoRDoN."&#xD;
&#xD;
body to do that, you know. She must have tasted&#xD;
some sweets before the bitter came-ought not&#xD;
that to help her to resignation?"&#xD;
"Would it help you, do you think?"&#xD;
"I don't know-but it seems to me it would.&#xD;
Any thing is better than dull, even stagnation.&#xD;
A still day of leaden cloud is the dreariest thing&#xD;
in the world-don't you think so? Ah, how&#xD;
bright and beautiful it is to-day! If I knew&#xD;
that to-morrow would bring a blinding storm, 1&#xD;
should still take the sunshine, and enjoy it while&#xD;
it lasted."&#xD;
"You surprise me," said Morton, smiling.&#xD;
"I had no idea that you were such an epi-&#xD;
curean. But," he added, more gravely, "you&#xD;
are mistaken. If you had ever known Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon, you would see that the lesson of her&#xD;
life is directly opposed to the sentiment you are&#xD;
advocating-a sentiment which has found its&#xD;
best expression in the words, 'Let us eat and&#xD;
drink, for to-morrow we die.' The lesson of&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon's life teaches with unusual force a&#xD;
thing which has almost grown trite in our ears&#xD;
-this is, tlia~ the gratification of our own wish-&#xD;
es, and the fulfillment of our own desires, never&#xD;
brings happiness. Of course, we all think it&#xD;
would do so; and, since there are few of us&#xD;
who are free enough to test the matter, we go&#xD;
on to our lives' ends thinking so But, in truth,&#xD;
when we see those who possessed the freedom&#xD;
which we lacked, and who marched forward to&#xD;
the goal of their own hopes, what is the result?&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon was one of those people, Miss Ver-&#xD;
non; and, if you could see her, your own eyes&#xD;
would assure you that, for her, not only the end,&#xD;
but the very hour of fruition-if, indeed, there&#xD;
ever 8 an hour of fruition-was disappointment&#xD;
and bitterness."&#xD;
"But, at all events, she has not merely exist-&#xD;
ed-she has lived."&#xD;
"You must give me your definition of life&#xD;
before I can grant you even that," he said, with&#xD;
a slight, grave smile. "Does life consist in a&#xD;
certain amount of sight-seeing, a certain number&#xD;
of vicissitudes to be endured, a certain depth of&#xD;
emotion to be sounded? I know that the idea&#xD;
of the day runs somewhat thus, and that discon-&#xD;
tent is rife in many places, because some people&#xD;
declare that life is only worthy of the name when&#xD;
it has known these things. But it seems to me&#xD;
that minds which think thus, must reason very&#xD;
shallowly-else they could hardly fail toperceive&#xD;
that, by such a standard, they exalt the worst&#xD;
class of the world above the best. In their&#xD;
sense, wh~ has lived most thoroughly, the saint&#xD;

in his cloister, the philosopher in his study, the&#xD;
great minds and hearts that solitude has nurtured&#xD;
in all ages, or the reckless adventurer, the wander-&#xD;
ing sybarite, the men who sound every scale of&#xD;
human life, and, dying, pass from human memory&#xD;
like the brutes that perish? Miss Vernon, will&#xD;
you tell me what you meant by saying that Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon had lived?"&#xD;
"I meant exactly what you have condemned,&#xD;
Mr .Annesley. I meant that her existence has&#xD;
not been tame and stagnant, and east in one&#xD;
groove; ,but that it has been like a varied drama,&#xD;
filled with many scenes and many emotions. In&#xD;
short-..-well, I express myself badly, hut I think&#xD;
you know what I mean."&#xD;
"Yes, I think I do. You mean that, to you,&#xD;
her life ~cems like a picture, where the shades&#xD;
onlyheighten the effect; or, like a story, which&#xD;
would lose half its interest if it had no' tragic&#xD;
incidents, or pathetic close. But the tragedy&#xD;
and the pathos are not poetical, but very bitter,&#xD;
when they come home to us in our own lives.&#xD;
If you will allow inc to make a personal applica-&#xD;
tion of my meaning, I should judge from what&#xD;
you have said just now, and from many things&#xD;
which have gone before, that you find your life&#xD;
dull and tame-.-it may be, even weary. But does&#xD;
it never occur to 'you that this very life seems to&#xD;
others like one long sunny idyl of brightness&#xD;
and peace? Believe me, thd chief secret of hap-&#xD;
piness-the only one, in fact-is content with&#xD;
that life, and mode of life, which has fallen to&#xD;
em- portion. I don't mean that we can obtain&#xD;
this content by merely wishing for it," said the&#xD;
young man, with a wistful look on his face;&#xD;
"but we can gain it by fighting for it, and it is&#xD;
worth a battle. Forgive me, if I seem to be&#xD;
preaching to you," added he, with a smile. "I&#xD;
have very imperfectly expressed the thoughts&#xD;
your words suggested to me, but perhaps you&#xD;
can seize the idea through the rude garb in which&#xD;
I have clothed it. It has only come to me dimly&#xD;
a~d feebly, but there is a thrill about it which&#xD;
tells me thAt I am on the threshold of a great&#xD;
truth. Yonder is my horse, at last. Now my&#xD;
posing is at an end. Good-by."&#xD;
"Good-by," echoed Miss Vernon, giving her&#xD;
hand, unconsciously, to the one he extended.&#xD;
"I did not know you thought this way," she&#xD;
we~nt on, abruptly. "Your creed seems to me&#xD;
simple, and yet-I fear I am very morbid," she&#xD;
said, quickly. "You have done something to&#xD;
make me ashamed of it"&#xD;
'4 You are a little morbid," said Morton, smil-&#xD;
lug. "must forgive me if I tell you so, and&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
you must also forgive meif I suggest the remedy.&#xD;
May11"&#xD;
"Of course you may."&#xD;
"Forget yourself then. I don't mean that&#xD;
you think of yourself a great deal," he went on,&#xD;
as he saw her flush; "but we are all prone to&#xD;
self-consciousness, and, in some natures, it fos-&#xD;
ters vanity; in others, a morbid habit of intro-&#xD;
spectionwhich-pshaw! lam drifting into meta-&#xD;
physics, and I know you hate the stuff as much&#xD;
as I do. Once more, good-by. I am off for&#xD;
good, this time."&#xD;
Miss Vernon stood on the piazza and watched&#xD;
him as he rode away. lie looked very gallant&#xD;
and handsome; for, like most of his country.&#xD;
men, he rode to perfection, and never appeared&#xD;
so well as on horseback. When he was out of&#xD;
sight, she smiled, to herself, with a mixture of&#xD;
archness and sadness. Seen just now, her face&#xD;
wore its very softest and sweetest expression.&#xD;
"It is not hard to tell where he obtains his&#xD;
philosophy," she thought. "No doubt he is&#xD;
perfectly sincere in it, but it is amazingly easy&#xD;
t6 be resigned to success, and to be content&#xD;
when every desire of one's heart is gratified.&#xD;
The test will be when disappointment and failure&#xD;
come. If his philosophy helps him to bear&#xD;
that, it will be genuine, and worth practising.&#xD;
Will it help him to bear it, though? Who can&#xD;
tell?"&#xD;
Regarded as an abstract question, who, in-&#xD;
deed? Yet the time was fast approaching when&#xD;
the abstract question would assume practical&#xD;
shape, and when Miss Vernon's question \vould&#xD;
be answered in a way which Miss Vernon could&#xD;
not, at that moment, possibly have foreseen or&#xD;
imagined.&#xD;
She was still standing on the piazza, still&#xD;
looking absently out on the bright landscape,&#xD;
still thinking of Morton's philosophy, and of the&#xD;
chances for and against his practising it, when&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley appeared at the open hall-door,&#xD;
and walked up to her.&#xD;
"All alone, my dear?" she said, with a&#xD;
smile, in which the kindness for 'once was real.&#xD;
"I thought I saw Morton with you a few min-&#xD;
utes ago?"&#xD;
"You did see him with me ~ few minutes&#xD;
ago," Irene answered; "but he is gone now.&#xD;
Didn't you hear the tramp of his horse?"&#xD;
"I heard the tramp of somebody's horse, but&#xD;
I had no idea that it was his. Where has he&#xD;
gone~"'&#xD;
"To Morton House, I believe."&#xD;
"To Morton House!" The extreme of 5'W?&#xD;
&#xD;
MORTON'&#xD;
&#xD;
pris~ appeared in Mrs. Annesley'a face. "Why,&#xD;
what has taken him there? And so suddenly-&#xD;
without a word to me!"&#xD;
"A note from Mrs. Gordon was the cause of&#xD;
his going," said Miss Vernon, carelessly. "He&#xD;
showed it to me, because he had an engagement&#xD;
to ride with me, which, in consequence of this, he&#xD;
was obliged to break."&#xD;
"And what was in the note?"&#xD;
"Only a few lines, begging him to come to&#xD;
her at once, on a matter of importance."&#xD;
"Nothinc~ more?"&#xD;
"Nothing more at all."&#xD;
"How very strange 1" said Mrs. Annesley,&#xD;
with her color rising. "A matter of impor-&#xD;
tance, and not one word to me-either from&#xD;
Pauline or Morton. My dear, excuse me, and&#xD;
don't think it is curiosity I feel-I am surprised,&#xD;
and, I confess, a little wounded, that I should be&#xD;
openly excluded from the confidence of my son.~~&#xD;
"I don't think Mr. Annesley knew what Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon wants with him," said Miss Vernon, see-&#xD;
ing the mischief she had unwittingly done, and&#xD;
being anxious to smooth the lady's ruffled plumes.&#xD;
"He seemed very much surprised, and, I am sure,&#xD;
he never thought-"&#xD;
"That is just it," said Mrs. Annesley, a little&#xD;
bitterly. "Of course, he n~verthought-or per-&#xD;
haps he receives Pauline's confidence with the&#xD;
stipulation that it is to be kept from me. But&#xD;
we mothers must make up our minds to bear&#xD;
this," said she, recovering her usual manner by&#xD;
an effort. "As our children grow older, others&#xD;
supplant us in their hearts and minds, and we&#xD;
must endeavor to abdicate with a good grace.&#xD;
If we could only choose our successors, it would&#xD;
uot be hard to do so," she added, drawing the&#xD;
girl's hand within her arm, with a smile.&#xD;
"Dear Mrs. Annesl~y, you do your son great I&#xD;
injustice," said Irene, speaking quickly. "No I&#xD;
one will ever supplant you in his heart. I don't&#xD;
think you know how much he loves and admires&#xD;
you. It often makes me admire kim to see it."&#xD;
"You reconcile me to abdication, my dear,"&#xD;
said the lady, smiling the same gracious smile.&#xD;
"Ah! if I can only choose my successor "-she '~&#xD;
broke 6ff, as irene colored and drew back a lit-&#xD;
tle. "Forgive me-I only meant to say that I s&#xD;
am very happy if I am one link to draw you e&#xD;
nearer to us. Shall we go in now? I am afraid d&#xD;
you find it cold out here."&#xD;
They went in; and no sooner was Mrs. An- b&#xD;
nealey able to make a retreat, than she retired t:&#xD;
te her own room, and rang for her maid.     V&#xD;
"Get my wrappings, Julia," she said, "and a&#xD;
&#xD;
S CHOICE.                             135&#xD;
order the carriage. Tell Sarah to have dinner&#xD;
an hour or two later than usual, for I am going&#xD;
to Morton House, and shall not be back at the&#xD;
ordinary time."&#xD;
While his mother, at Annesdale, was prepar-&#xD;
ing for her drive, Morton felt as if the ground&#xD;
had absolutely yielded beneath his feet, when&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon, who was in a state of strangely-&#xD;
passionate excitement, told her story at Morton&#xD;
House. After it was ended, she gave the reason&#xD;
that had made her send for him.&#xD;
"I have been foolish enough to encourage&#xD;
you in your fancy for this girl," she said. "It&#xD;
was my duty, therefore, not to let you rest an&#xD;
hour in ignorance of her true character-not to&#xD;
fail to tell you at once that I consider her an&#xD;
adventuress of the most decided stamp. Mor-&#xD;
ton, for Heaven's sake-for the sake of your&#xD;
name, your honor, and your friends-do not give&#xD;
another thought to her!"&#xD;
"One moment," said Morton, who was pale,&#xD;
but reticent-evidently he meant to hear every&#xD;
thing, and say nothing that would commit him&#xD;
to any positive line of action-" you have not&#xD;
told me yet why you think this."&#xD;
"Could I think it on better ground than&#xD;
that of her association with St. Johnl' You&#xD;
don't know-you can hardly imagine-.-.what he&#xD;
is!"&#xD;
"But is it just to judge her by him?"&#xD;
"What could be more just, when there is&#xD;
evidently some link of familiar connection be..&#xD;
tween them? Morton, put the case as if it re-&#xD;
garded somebody else. What would you think&#xD;
of a woman who was on terms of-~-.-well, we will&#xD;
my intimate friendship, with a man than whom&#xD;
bhe lowest sharper is not more destitute of honor&#xD;
-with a man whose record is one that exile~&#xD;
idm forever from the companionship of honest&#xD;
eople?"&#xD;
"She may not know this."&#xD;
"Ask her if she does not! I am willing to&#xD;
'isk every thing on her reply, for I think that&#xD;
circumstances have made it impossible for her&#xD;
o speak falsely.. Ask her if she does not huow&#xD;
rho and what St. John is."&#xD;
"You are right," he said, rising. "I will&#xD;
*sk her. That is the straightforward and hen.&#xD;
at thing to do, after all. Don't think that I&#xD;
oubt you," he went on, looking at bi~ eoiisin.&#xD;
Don't think that I am ungenerous euouRjat~&#xD;

&#xD;
take any mere circumstantial evidence against&#xD;
her. It seems to me that 1 should be a very con-&#xD;
temptible fellow, if I did."&#xD;
"And you are going to her?" said Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
don, bitterly. "Well-perhaps it may be best;&#xD;
but oh, Morton, don't be rash! Don't say any&#xD;
thing that you may hereafter regret. Give me&#xD;
that much credence, at least."&#xD;
He bent down, and kissed her cheek-smiling&#xD;
with an attempt at cheerfulness which went to&#xD;
her, heart more surely than any pathos could&#xD;
'have done. He was mad and foolish, she&#xD;
thought; he was about to risk the happiness&#xD;
of his whole life in the blind determination to&#xD;
trust to the last; yet, even while she felt impa-&#xD;
tient~ she could not but be touched by his sim-&#xD;
ple, steadfast fidelity. It had all the elements&#xD;
of the highest chivalry in it, though nobody&#xD;
could have known this as little as Morton him.&#xD;
self. It was Mrs. Gordon who recognized it, and&#xD;
who, in the midst of her anxiety and irritation,&#xD;
felt suddenly thrilled by admiration. Still she&#xD;
could not but make one last effort.&#xD;
"Morton," she said, catching his hand as he&#xD;
bent over her, "listen to me. I am much older&#xD;
than yourself, and, although I am a woman, my&#xD;
knowledge of the world is much greater. Be-&#xD;
sides, I am your cousin-~--the only Morton left,&#xD;
the only one of the name which hereafter you&#xD;
will have to represent. To see you what you are&#xD;
-to know you brave, and true, and loyal-has&#xD;
given more sunshine to my life than you would&#xD;
readily believe. IC he lives, Felix's duties will&#xD;
be elsewhere-sonic day, therefore, this house&#xD;
must be yours. This has been my only comfort.&#xD;
Morton~remember that it was through my fault&#xD;
my father left here; it was my fault my brother&#xD;
never took his place. It is a horrible thing to&#xD;
see, when it is too late, a direct sequence of&#xD;
events-to know that one's own haid has set&#xD;
in motion a tide which ends by sweeping away&#xD;
every thing that life holds dear. This has been&#xD;
my lot. Don't add one mor~ disappointment to&#xD;
it-one more bitter memory. Don't ruin your&#xD;
life, and tarnish your name, by marrying this&#xD;
woman."&#xD;
The earnestness, the passion of her appeal,&#xD;
touched Morton deeply. lie saw plainly enough&#xD;
that the question of his happiness was with her&#xD;
entirely subordinate to the question of family&#xD;
pride; but he sympathized with this sentiment&#xD;
sufficiently to feel its supremacy no 'hardship.&#xD;
lit these times, the thought that any thing is of&#xD;
more importauice than the gratification of a sen-&#xD;
timental fancy is quite obsolete; but, in that&#xD;
&#xD;
day, a few people (and Morton was one of these&#xD;
people) clung to the old-fashioned idea that there&#xD;
were certain claims to be considered in such a&#xD;
case, certain higher duties than the duty of mar-&#xD;
rying and giving in marriage, certain principles&#xD;
to be observed, and, if any or all of these things&#xD;
clashed with love,'then love must give way. We&#xD;
of the present period know better than that.'&#xD;
Having the grand advantage of modern enlight-&#xD;
enment, we know that the first duty of every&#xD;
reasonable human being is a duty to self. And&#xD;
as selfishness generally culminates its strength&#xD;
in love-not divine love, which takes us out of&#xD;
ourselves into something higher, but that passion&#xD;
bearing its name, which is of the earth earthy-&#xD;
so love must needs be taught to override all the&#xD;
grand 'old watchwords of Faith, and Honor, and&#xD;
Duty. But, as we have said, Morton was not of&#xD;
this day. The jargon of the new school of mor-&#xD;
alists would have been a foreign language to his&#xD;
ears. The conception of sacrifice-the concep-&#xD;
'tion which is the key-note of every nature which&#xD;
deserves to be called noble-had always been&#xD;
familiar to him, had grown with his growth, and&#xD;
strengthened with his strength. As far as he&#xD;
was concerned, he was ready to put his own&#xD;
wishes clown under his feet for the sake of any&#xD;
thing that had a right to demand the offering;&#xD;
and, reared as he had been, the name that he&#xD;
bore was one of these things. No sacrifice could&#xD;
be counted too costly that would help to keep it&#xD;
pure and untarnished.&#xD;
Regarded from this point of view, his course&#xD;
seemed clear-but then there was another side&#xD;
to the question, or else all this explanation need&#xD;
not have been written. To Morton, life had al-&#xD;
ways seemed a very simple thing, and he had&#xD;
never had much sympathy with those who pro-&#xD;
fessed to find it otherwise. "The path of duty is&#xD;
always clear and straight," he said, "andifwe&#xD;
follow it, we can't possibly go wrong. The peo-&#xD;
plc who are involved in moral difficulties, gener-&#xD;
ally make them for themselves." Now the time&#xD;
had come for him to learn-as everybody who&#xD;
deals in such fluent generalities sooner or later&#xD;
must learn-that life is, after all, a very com-&#xD;
plex tissue, and that, without being addicted to&#xD;
the dangerous pastime of splitting hairs, we may&#xD;
find ourselves on the horns of a moral dilemma,&#xD;
and be honestly and seriously puzzled thereby.&#xD;
Two duties were clashing with him now, aad&#xD;
the young man felt sorely uncertain as to which&#xD;
had the strongest claim to his respect. On the&#xD;
one side was the name to which a gentlemanowo~&#xD;
his first duty. On the other, that principle of&#xD;
&#xD;
steadfast fidelity which every tradition of his&#xD;
creed, and instinct of his nature, made a solemn&#xD;
obligation. Moved as he had been by Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon's passionate appeal, he was not yet&#xD;
ready to set this aside as naught-not yet ready&#xD;
to believe that the higher duty conflicted with&#xD;
it.&#xD;
He walked away to the window, and stood&#xD;
there looking out. Before him lay the broad&#xD;
Morton fields, and the distant shadowy Morton&#xD;
woods. Above him was the roof which he had&#xD;
just heard Mrs. Gordon declare might some day&#xD;
be his own-at a little distance from him sat the&#xD;
woman rendered so sadly desolate by her own&#xD;
folly, the woman who had appealed to him in the&#xD;
name of family honor, who had bared her heart&#xD;
to him, and prayed him to spare her another&#xD;
cruel blow. Here it would have seemed as if&#xD;
every influence weighed heavily in one scale-as&#xD;
if here the side which all these things represented&#xD;
surely must prevail. Yet here his heart spoke to&#xD;
him as it had never spoken before. Here Katha.&#xD;
rme Tresham's face rose before him with a pathos&#xD;
and a beauty which the face itself had never&#xD;
owned. Suddenly the passion which he had&#xD;
heretofore so steadily curbed, so sternly kept&#xD;
obedient to his will, rose up in revolt, and swept&#xD;
over him in a great wave that fairly startled him.&#xD;
A voice seemed to speak in his ear, and to say:&#xD;
"If you give her up in this way, you are a das.&#xD;
tard!" It was in obedience to this voice that&#xD;
he turned at last to answer Mrs. Gordon.&#xD;
"Until I have seen Miss Tresham, I cannot&#xD;
tell what I will do," he said. "I can only say&#xD;
that I will try to act as seems to me right. 'Many&#xD;
things have conspired to perplex me of late;&#xD;
and, at this moment, I am only certain of one&#xD;
thing-that I, will not give her up! I will trust&#xD;
her until she herself proves or disproves your&#xD;
opinion of her; and I should not deserve the&#xD;
name of gentleman if I did not do so."&#xD;
"This is your decision?" asked Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
don.&#xD;
"This is my decision," he answered.&#xD;
Something like a faint smile of pity came to&#xD;
the lips of the woman who had gone lan- way, and&#xD;
who now looked back on the results of it.&#xD;
"Weare all alike," she said. "Indeed, all&#xD;
of us must needs run our own course of folly,&#xD;
and wreck our lives according to our own fancy.&#xD;
I suppose It is useless to reason with you; and I,&#xD;
of all people, have no right-save the right of&#xD;
sad experience-to bid you stop and consider.&#xD;
Yet "-she paused a moment-" yet I fancied&#xD;
you would be different. I fancied you would&#xD;
&#xD;
rate the duty you owe to your name above your&#xD;
passion for a woman's face."&#xD;
"And I thought you would understand me&#xD;
better," he answered, quickly. "I thought you&#xD;
would believe that I do rate it above every thing&#xD;
excepting my duty to God, and that if my love&#xD;
for Katharine Tresham clashed with it, I would&#xD;
sacrifice that love without an instant's hesita-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"if it clashed with it?"&#xD;
"Yes, if it clashed with it. You must par.&#xD;
don me that I say 'if'-but your opinion is only&#xD;
your opinion, you know; and, in a matter which&#xD;
concerns the happiness of my whole life,' I can.&#xD;
not accept any thing but positive evidence."&#xD;
"One word more," said Mrs. Gordon, as he&#xD;
extended his hand to bid he~ good.by. She did&#xD;
not take the hand, but rose ~o her feet, holding&#xD;
her own tightly pressed against her heart.&#xD;
"You will not misunderstand what I am going&#xD;
to say, I am sure; you will not think that I mean&#xD;
to influence you by any thing so foolish, and&#xD;
(from me) so impertinent as a threat," she went&#xD;
on. "But I think it right to place before you&#xD;
the consequences of the step you seem deter.&#xD;
mined to take. Morton, that woman is allied in&#xD;
some way to the man who helped to ruin my&#xD;
life and to murder my brother. If you make&#xD;
her your wife, you can never be master in this&#xD;
house."&#xD;
She spoke quietly, but in a moment she saw&#xD;
that she had spoken unwisely. Her warning&#xD;
certainly had much of the nature of a threat in&#xD;
it, and the man must be cold-blooded, indeed,&#xD;
who, in a matter of this kind, subMts to be&#xD;
threatened.&#xD;
"You might have spared me this," said&#xD;
Morton, with more hauteu,- than he intended.&#xD;
"My resolution with regard to Miss ~'resham&#xD;
did not need a spur; and your own experience&#xD;
might tell you whether my sense of family obli-&#xD;
gation is likely to be increased or diminished by&#xD;
the knowledge of such a penalty. I see that I&#xD;
had better go," he added, after a short pause.&#xD;
"You have wounded me, and I may pain you, if&#xD;
I remain any longer. Forgive me if I have&#xD;
seemed abrupt or ungracious. I-this has been&#xD;
a harder struggle than you think."&#xD;
She let him go in silence. But after the hst&#xD;
echo of his step had died away, the reason of&#xD;
thin became evident. She sat down, and a rush&#xD;
of tears came through the thin, white fingers&#xD;
which covered her face.&#xD;
Half an hour later, Babette opened the door,&#xD;
and brought in a card.&#xD;

"The lady is in the drawing-room, and insists&#xD;
on seeing madame," she said.&#xD;
"I can see nobody," answered Mrs. Gordon,&#xD;
languidly. Still she extended her hand, and&#xD;
took t~~e bit of pasteboard. She started when&#xD;
she read Mrs. Anneelcy's name.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXYL&#xD;
~5R. SLAUK5 AssERrs HIM5ELr.&#xD;
Mn~. MM~ns's doubt of what "Richard"&#xD;
would have to say on the subject of Miss Tresh.&#xD;
am's flitting, proved to be well founded. When&#xD;
the cashier came home to dinner, and heard his&#xD;
wife's eager recital of the events of the morning,&#xD;
he looked decidedly grave. The zhenti~n of Mr.&#xD;
St. John recalled Mr. Warwick's opinion of that&#xD;
gentleman, and for Mr. Warwick's opinion no.&#xD;
body' entertained a greater respect than his&#xD;
brother.ia.ltLw. Then Mrs. Gordon's warning&#xD;
seemed to Mr. Marks a much more important&#xD;
matter than it had seemed to his wife. -&#xD;
"Mrs. Gordon would never have spoken in&#xD;
that way without some cause," he said, when&#xD;
Mrs. Marks told her story. After this, came&#xD;
the news of Miss Treshata's sudden departure&#xD;
-.at which Mr. Marks startled his wife by the&#xD;
astonishment of his face.&#xD;
"Gene 1" he said. "Gone, just at the close&#xD;
of the holidays, and~before she had* been in the&#xD;
house more than a few hours! What is the&#xD;
~neaning of it?.-.what did she~say was The mean-&#xD;
Wgefit~?"&#xD;
"I-really, I believe she only said she was&#xD;
going to Sanford," answered Mrs. Marks, de-&#xD;
eldedIy~taken aback. "Sheasked me if I had&#xD;
~tayObjectioiiand I told her no. I thought a&#xD;
day or two~Would n~t matter about the children,&#xD;
and it never occurred tome th~t you ~Would mind&#xD;
~4.~~&#xD;
"I mind it, because I don't understand it,"&#xD;
said Mit. Marks, with the same unusual gravity.&#xD;
"It doii'~t~look well for Mlss~resham to be neg.&#xD;
letting her duties in this way ;~ but, a~s you&#xD;
eey, aday or two wouldn't matter~-.if a day or&#xD;
two's loss of titus was all. What does matter,&#xD;
is~46me explanation of this strange conduct.&#xD;
Think, ~essi~i I Did she tell you nothing about&#xD;
wAy sh6 was going to Sa~ford?"&#xD;
'~hn~did not tell inc a word," said Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, looking and feeling a little crestfallen.&#xD;
"She ~nine ~ln here in ~a great hurry, just as&#xD;
Tom was setting the table, and asked me to lend&#xD;
&#xD;
'her some money, as ~he had none, and wanted--&#xD;
Why, Richard, what on earth is the matter?"&#xD;
There was reason enough for asking the ques-&#xD;
tion. Mr. Marks's eyes opened wide on his star-&#xD;
tIed wife, and the expression of his face fully&#xD;
warranted her surprise. When she broke off&#xD;
in this way, his lips had already formed an excla-&#xD;
mation.&#xD;
"She asked you for money!" he repeated,&#xD;
hastily. "Bessic, there must be some mistake I&#xD;
Are you sure she asked you for money?"&#xD;
"Of course I am sure! How could I be mis-&#xD;
taken?"&#xD;
"And did you lend her any?"&#xD;
"Of course I did-I lent her ten dollars."&#xD;
"Ten dollars!"&#xD;
The cashier's astonishment seemed to have&#xD;
reached the utmost extreme possible to that&#xD;
emotion. He walked up and down the floor,&#xD;
then came back and stood before the lire, look-&#xD;
ing down into the glowing coals.&#xD;
"This is the strangest thing I ever heard&#xD;
of!" he said, at last. "I confess I don't under-&#xD;
stand it."&#xD;
"What is the matter?" demanded Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, who was, in her turn, excited by curios-&#xD;
ity. "What is strange ?---.what is it you don't&#xD;
understand? Why shouldn't Miss Treshani ask&#xD;
me to lend her some money?"&#xD;
Her husband turned and looked at her.&#xD;
"The simple reason why Miss Tresham should&#xD;
not have asked you to lend her some money is,&#xD;
that I paid Miss Tresham no less sum than a&#xD;
thousand dollars no longer ago than last Tues-&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"Richard I"&#xD;
"Her reeetpt is at the bank to show for it,"&#xD;
said Mr. Marks; "and now-on Friday-she&#xD;
comes to you to borrow ten dollars! It is very&#xD;
strange conduct, to say the least of it."&#xD;
"A thousand dollars! Good gracious!&#xD;
What dO you think she could have done with&#xD;
it?" cried Mrs. Marks, all in a flutter. "She&#xD;
certainly said she didn't have any money, and&#xD;
she certainly took two five-dollar notes from&#xD;
me. Richard, what on earth could she have&#xD;
done with it?"&#xD;
"That is more than I can pretend' to say,"&#xD;
answered her husband. "But one thing is cer-&#xD;
tam-.--1 don't like. the look of matters. When*&#xD;
Miss Tresham drew that mokey, she was very&#xD;
~articu1ar about requiring gold. Then she wrote&#xD;
s'note in the bank, end had a meeting in the&#xD;
parlor across the passage, with this St.~Jehx~.&#xD;
After that she went away, and War~4e1c~-&amp;amp;~a~ee&#xD;

&#xD;
in. The first thing he told me was that the&#xD;
man-'St. John, I mean~was an unprincipled&#xD;
scoundrel; and, though he did not give me his&#xD;
reasons for saying so, he spoke in a rntuiner&#xD;
which showed very plainly that he had reasons,&#xD;
and good ones, for the opinion. I confess that,&#xD;
at the time, I didn't pay much attention to the&#xD;
matter; but; looking back now, it seems to me&#xD;
more serious. After what has happened. to-day,&#xD;
I feel uneasy-I feel certain that something is&#xD;
wrong."&#xD;
"Not with Miss Tresham, Richard-I'm sure&#xD;
there's nothing wrong with Miss Tresham."&#xD;
"What do you know about Miss Tresham,&#xD;
Bessie? You may forget, but I don't, that we&#xD;
engaged her when she 4as an entire stranger to&#xD;
us, and that, after living with us two years, she&#xD;
is, as far as her own affairs are concerned, as&#xD;
much a stranger as ever."&#xD;
"But you know how nice she is!" said Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, indignantly. "You know nil that she has&#xD;
done for the ehihfren, and-and all that she has&#xD;
done for me. You liked her yourself, Richard-&#xD;
you know you did!"&#xD;
"I like her now," said Mr. Marks, with that&#xD;
stolid masculine coolness which some men pos-&#xD;
sess in superlative degree, and which is, to the&#xD;
feminine mind, the most exasperating thing in&#xD;
the world. "But what has that got to do with&#xD;
the matter? l'm not talking about liking her.&#xD;
I'm talking about her drawing that money, and&#xD;
borrowing ten dollars from you three days later&#xD;
-.-I am talking about her acquaintance with this&#xD;
S&amp;amp; John, and what Mrs. Gordon said of it-and&#xD;
I'm talking of her going away without a word&#xD;
of explanation, just as the holidays are at an&#xD;
end."&#xD;
Mrs. Marks sat dumb. She was a good par.&#xD;
tisan; but even the best of partisans must have&#xD;
something besides mere opinion withwhich to op-&#xD;
pose stated facts. On any one of these grounds,&#xD;
she was unable to ~ay any thing for Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am. After a minute's silence, Mr. Marks re-&#xD;
sumed:&#xD;
"One of two things must happen. Either&#xD;
Miss Tresham has gone away for good-than&#xD;
which, I confess I think nothing mere likely-&#xD;
or else she wrn come back at the stated time.&#xD;
If she does come back, there must be an expla-&#xD;
nation required from her. I must know who&#xD;
Mr. St. John is, and on what footing he comes&#xD;
here. Otherwise, I may be sorry to part with&#xD;
her, but my duty is plain-she must go. I can-&#xD;
not keep a governess wh~ acts as Miss ~Fresham&#xD;
has-been acting lately."&#xD;
&#xD;
So spoke the head of the household in his&#xD;
official capacity; and much as his wire's sym-&#xD;
pathy ranged on the side of the governess, she&#xD;
could not deny that he spoke with reason. Miss&#xD;
Tresham's conduct certainly justified all that he&#xD;
said of it. Yet the unreasoning faith of Miss&#xD;
Tresham's advocate was not shaken for an in-&#xD;
stant. 0 wonderful instinct of woman I There&#xD;
is nothing like it in the world; and where it has&#xD;
taken one woman wrong, it has led a hundred&#xD;
thousand right. Yet there are people who would&#xD;
like to educate and "develop" it into a "reason-&#xD;
ing faculty!" Why does not somebody~ come&#xD;
forward to paint the lilies of the field, and furnish&#xD;
us with patent improved sunlight, warranted to&#xD;
shine on every occasion?&#xD;
Oblivious, for once, of his business duties in&#xD;
town, Mr. Marks was still standing before the&#xD;
fire, considering the perplexing subject which was&#xD;
on the domestic tapir, when there came a knock&#xD;
at the front door.&#xD;
"There, now!" said Mrs. Marks, starting.&#xD;
"or course it's somebody to see me .Mrs~&#xD;
Sloan, I expect-and what a sight I am! Go,&#xD;
Richard, please, and ask her into the par.&#xD;
Icr."&#xD;
Mr. Marks'~obcyed, and, as he carelessly left&#xD;
the door open behind him, his wife heard him&#xD;
exchange a cordial greeting with the visitor;&#xD;
and then, without any warning, he came back,&#xD;
and ushered Morton Annesley into the dining.&#xD;
room, where the uncleared dinner-tablestood in&#xD;
the centre of the fioor.-Mrs. Marks having been&#xD;
in such a fever of impatience to tell her story,&#xD;
that she had not allowed Tom to finish his&#xD;
duties.&#xD;
"Oh, my dear!" she cried, in a tone of capes-&#xD;
tulation. But it was too late. Morton..-.-wbo&#xD;
would have been none the wiser if there had&#xD;
been an elephant, instead of a dinner-table, in&#xD;
the middle of the fioor-walked forward and&#xD;
shook hands with her.&#xD;
"Fray don't speak of it," he said, when she&#xD;
began apologizing. "I hope you don't consider&#xD;
me a stranger. Mr. Marks, at least, was more&#xD;
complimentary, for he asked me in at oncc.~ :1&#xD;
hope you are well. I hwve not seen you fern&#xD;

140                       MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
his wife might have perceived that the young&#xD;
z~au made these disjointed remarks very absent-&#xD;
ly, that his eyes turned unconsciously toward the&#xD;
door, and that he started at every noise in the&#xD;
passage outahic. They glanced at each other&#xD;
significantly, but were kind enough to take no&#xD;
further notice, and talked of indifferent things,&#xD;
until Morton himself came directly to the point,&#xD;
in 'his frank, somewhat boyish fashion. Mrs.&#xD;
*M~rks spoke of Miss Tresham's enjoyment at&#xD;
Annesdale, and Morton instantly caught at her&#xD;
name,&#xD;
"I ~ope she did enjoy herself," he said.&#xD;
Then he added, quickly: "Is Miss Tresham dis-&#xD;
engaged just now ?-.-I should like to see her, if&#xD;
she' is. I am obliged to return to Annesdale&#xD;
very soon, and I am particularly anxious-"&#xD;
lie nt~~ ni~ert. The expression of Mrs.&#xD;
Marks's face warned him that something was&#xD;
wrong. He looked hastily from herself to&#xD;
her husband, and read the same expression&#xD;
still more strongly stamped on the masculine&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"What is the matter?" he asked, impetu-&#xD;
ously. "Miss Tresham&#xD;
Here Mrs. Marks interrupted:&#xD;
"I am sorry to say, Mr. Annesley, that Miss&#xD;
Tresham is not at home. She left to-day for Sax-&#xD;
fQrd."&#xD;
Morton was astounded. In a moment his&#xD;
mind ran over a terrible possibility-the possi-&#xD;
lillity that there had been some misunderstand-&#xD;
ing 'between Miss Tresham and her employers,&#xD;
which had resulted in her leaving Tallahoma per-&#xD;
manently.&#xD;
"Left-for Saxford!" he repeated. "Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, what is the meaning of that?"&#xD;
"' Don't ask me, Mr. Annesley," said Mrs.&#xD;
Marks. "If my life depended on it, I could not&#xD;
tell you a thing more than just that4-she has&#xD;
gone to Sasford. I am sure it didn't strike me&#xD;
as strange; but here's Richard has been talking&#xD;
alout it, and-"&#xD;
"It i~ very strange," said Richard, speak-&#xD;
ing for himself. "I don't pretend to under-&#xD;
stand it. I don't wonder you are astonished,&#xD;
Mi~. Annesley. I was astonished myself when I&#xD;
came Jsome and heard that Miss Tresham was&#xD;
gone."&#xD;
"When will she be back?" asked Morton,&#xD;
catching at the first idea which presented itself&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
"On Monday," answered Mrs. Marks, tp&#xD;
wheat the question was addressed. "she said&#xD;
&#xD;
she would be back on Monday, Mr. Annesloy,&#xD;
and I am suxe she will come. Miss Ratharine&#xD;
never breaks her word."&#xD;
"But why did she go away?" asked Morton,&#xD;
impatiently. "Did she not tell you why she&#xD;
went?"&#xD;
Mrs. Marks looked at her husband, and Mr.&#xD;
Marks looked at his wife. This time Annesley&#xD;
perceived the glance, and saw plainly that there&#xD;
was something in reserve which he was not to&#xD;
hear. Determined to know if any thing had&#xD;
happened after Mrs. Gordon left the house, he&#xD;
boldly broke the ice at once.&#xD;
"I have been to Morton House and seen&#xD;
my cousin," he said. "I am aware of the un-&#xD;
fortunate "-he stopped a moment, as if search-&#xD;
ing for a word -"the unfortunate discussion&#xD;
which took place (his uaoraixig. Will you allow&#xD;
me to iffquire if that discussion, or any thing&#xD;
resulting from it, was the cause of Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am's leaving Tallahoma?"&#xD;
On this point Mrs. Marks professed utter&#xD;
ignorance, and she was going on to state every&#xD;
thing which she had already told to her hus-&#xD;
band, when Mr. Marks broke in:&#xD;
"Since you have seen Mrs. Gordon, Mr. An-&#xD;
nesley, I need not hesitate to say to you that I&#xD;
am seriously perplexed and uneasy about this&#xD;
affair of Miss Tresham. As I was telling my&#xD;
wife, just before you came in, there are more&#xD;
reasons than the reason of Mrs. Gordon's warn-&#xD;
ing for distrusting Mr. St. John, and Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am's connection with him. You know her quite&#xD;
well, I believe: will you tell me if she has ever&#xD;
mentioned the man or any thing about him to&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
Morton flushed. He remembered the eve of&#xD;
New Year, and the manner in whieh Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am had repulsed his first and last attempt to win&#xD;
her confidence. Oh, if she had only been frank&#xD;
with him, the young man thought, if she had&#xD;
only trusted him, and given him a right to speak&#xD;
for her! But she had not done this, and there&#xD;
was nothing for it but to answer Mr. Marks's&#xD;
question by the truth.&#xD;
"She has never mentioned Mr. St. John's&#xD;
name to me," said he. "But I have never been&#xD;
in a position to receive her confidence."&#xD;
"Hum!" said the cashier, significantly-&#xD;
looking the while at his wife, and smoothing&#xD;
with one hand his well-shaven chin. "I cannot&#xD;
find," he said, after a moment, "that Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am has ever mentioned Mr. St. John's name to&#xD;
any one; and, even after Mrs. Gordon's visit~ she&#xD;
gave my wife no explanation of his purpose in&#xD;
&#xD;
f,&#xD;
&#xD;
coming here, or of her acquaintance with him.&#xD;
My own impression," added he, "is, that she&#xD;
has left Tallahoma simply to avoid giving this&#xD;
explanation."&#xD;
"But when she returns en Monday?'&#xD;
"When she returns on Monday-or, to speak&#xD;
more correctly, if she returns on Monday-I shall&#xD;
certainly endeavor to obtain this explanation. If&#xD;
I cannot obtain it, Mr. Annesley, my mind is&#xD;
made up-Miss Treshamn must leave my house."&#xD;
An indignant reply rose to Annesley's lips,&#xD;
but he had sense enough to restrain it-sense&#xD;
enough to see that he would do harm, instead of&#xD;
good, by uttering it. What business, after all,&#xD;
was it of his? what right had he to interfere in&#xD;
Mr. Marks's domestic affairs? Angry as he was,&#xD;
he asked himself this question, and accepted the&#xD;
0c3(L5 reply. Dcidcig the wale which fol-&#xD;
lowed Mr. Marks's speech, nothing was said.&#xD;
Then Annesley rose, and begun drawing on his&#xD;
gloves.&#xD;
"If you will allow me, I will call again on&#xD;
Monday to see Miss Tresham," he said, with un-&#xD;
'csual formality. "I am sorry-very sorry that&#xD;
she has left Tallahoma. But, if you will excuse&#xD;
me, Mr. Marks, I would advise you to suspend&#xD;
judgment upon the matter until she returns."&#xD;
Before Mr. Marks could reply to this advice,&#xD;
there came an interruption. The door opened,&#xD;
and Letty appeared. She addressed herself to&#xD;
her mistress.&#xD;
"There's a gentleman out here to see Miss&#xD;
Tresham, ma'am, and he wants to know if you&#xD;
can tell him when she will be back."&#xD;
"Miss Tresham will be back on Monday,"&#xD;
answered Mrs. Marks. "Tell the gentleman-&#xD;
or, no, stop.-My dear" (to Mr. Marks), "per-&#xD;
haps you had better see who it is, and speak to&#xD;
him yourself."&#xD;
Mr. Marks went out, and Morton, after shak-&#xD;
ing hands with Mrs. Marks, followed him. At&#xD;
the front door they met St. John, whom Morton&#xD;
had seen once before, and the cashier never at&#xD;
alL&#xD;
A glance was sufficient to show them that&#xD;
Mr. St. John was very decidedly out of temper.&#xD;
The face, which on occasions could be so bland&#xD;
and smiling, was now set snd lowering in sin-&#xD;
gularly marked degree. It did not even lighten&#xD;
when he saw the two men who advanced toward&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Mm~. Marks, I presume," he said, raising his&#xD;
hat as Mr. Marks came down the passage. Then,&#xD;
glanch~g at Annesley, he started, and bowed with-&#xD;
out any sign of recognition. For some reason, he&#xD;
:io&#xD;
&#xD;
evidently chose to ignore their previous meeting,&#xD;
and addressed himself solely to the master of&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
"I have called to see Miss Tresham," he~&#xD;
said, "and I am surprised 'to hear from your&#xD;
servant that she has left Tallahoma. Will you&#xD;
allow me ~o inquire if this is true?"&#xD;
"It is true, sir," answerer Mr. Marke, with&#xD;
business-like brevity.&#xD;
"May I ask where she has gone, and when&#xD;
she will return?"&#xD;
"She has gone to Saxford, and will probably&#xD;
return on ~Monday-at least she told my wife to&#xD;
expect her on that day."&#xD;
A dead pause. An expression on Mr. Marks's&#xD;
face, and in Mr. Marks's attitude, which said:&#xD;
"Your questions are answered. Take leave."&#xD;
An expression 'en St. John\s face of perplexed&#xD;
astonishment, and half-absent thought, which&#xD;
Annesley, watching him closely, felt sure was&#xD;
not assumed. He looked silently at his' boots&#xD;
for a second, then glanced up again at the&#xD;
cashier.&#xD;
"Excuse me," he said, "but this news is&#xD;
very unexpected-and surprising. When I was&#xD;
here this morning, Miss Tresham gave no inti-&#xD;
mation of any such intention as this. Shall I&#xD;
trespass too much on your kindness if I ask you&#xD;
to inquire whether she left any message or note&#xD;
for me-that 'is, for Mr. St. John?"&#xD;
"I can inquire, sir, but I do not think it is&#xD;
likely," said Mr. Marks, with the same forbidding&#xD;
civility.&#xD;
lie walked down the passage, and, without~&#xD;
entering the dining-room, held an audible con-&#xD;
versation with his wife.&#xD;
"Bessie, did Miss Tresham leave any nOte or&#xD;
message for Mr. St. John?"&#xD;
Reply of Mrs. Marks from behind the scenes:&#xD;
"Not a word, or a line; with me, Richard."&#xD;
"You are sure of this?"&#xD;
"I am perfectly sure. She never mentioned&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Miss Tresham has left nothing for you, sir,"&#xD;
said Mr. Marks, returning to Mr. St. John. "I&#xD;
regret that I am not able to give you any further&#xD;
information about the reason of her departure."&#xD;
"You can give me one item of further infer-&#xD;
mation," said St. John, manifestly proof against&#xD;
the plainest of hints. "Is Miss Tresham in the&#xD;
habit of going to Saxford?"&#xD;
"She is in the habit of going there once a&#xD;
month or so."&#xD;
"May I ask if she has any acquaintances&#xD;
there?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8070-00000077"/>&#xD;
142                       MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"She goes, I believe, to see a Catholic priest,"&#xD;
answered Mr. Marks. Then he lost patience,&#xD;
and showed it in a way very unusual with him.&#xD;
"You must excuse me, sir, if I decline to answer&#xD;
any more questions. Miss Tresham's private&#xD;
affairs as-c her private affairs; and, since she has&#xD;
been living in my family, I have never interfered&#xD;
with or inquired into them."&#xD;
"Allow me to admire your discretion," said&#xD;
Mr. St. John, with the same bow which had once&#xD;
irritated Morton by its covert mockery. "I re-&#xD;
gret to have trespassed so long on your time and&#xD;
civility, and I have the honor to wish you good-&#xD;
day.'~&#xD;
In another bow he included Annesley, and,&#xD;
then went his way, leaving Mr. Marks with an&#xD;
angry sense of having had the worst of it.&#xD;
"An insolent scoundrel I" said he, as soon as&#xD;
St. John was out of hearing. "What do you&#xD;
say, Mr. Annesley?" he went on, turning to&#xD;
Morton. "Don't you think that 'rascal' is&#xD;
written legibly on his face?"&#xD;
"I don't especially fancy his face," said&#xD;
Morton; "but I should not like to say that any&#xD;
thing particular. is written on it. One ,thing&#xD;
is certain," he went on, more slowly; "Miss&#xD;
Tresham's departure has taken 1dm by sur-&#xD;
prise.&#xD;
"That is to say, he looked as if it had,"&#xD;
said Mr. Marks, who, what with Mr. Warwick's&#xD;
opinion, Mrs. Gordon's opinion, and his own&#xD;
discomfiture, was ready to believe the very&#xD;
worst of Mr. St. John. "Candidly, however,&#xD;
Mr. Annesley, I don't trust, any thing about&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"You think-"&#xD;
"I think that I will follow your advice of a&#xD;
little while ago, and wait and see. Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am may come back on Monday. If she does,&#xD;
we can clear up matters speedily, and it is not&#xD;
worth while to trouble ourselves with coujec-&#xD;
"Meanwhile, however, you distrust Mr. St.&#xD;
John?'~&#xD;
"Mei~nwhile, I do most decidedly distrust Mr.&#xD;
St. John."&#xD;
With this interchange of sentiment, the con-&#xD;
versation ended. The two men walked to the&#xD;
gate together, and there separated-Mr. Marks&#xD;
going into town, and Annesley riding off in the&#xD;
opposite direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
MRS. GORDON'&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
nns oonno~'s suocxsrioN.&#xD;
WHEN Mrs. Gordon read her cousin's name&#xD;
on the card,-she hesitated a moment. Then she&#xD;
surprised Babette by lifting her face with an air&#xD;
of decision.&#xD;
"I will see Mrs. Annesley," she said. "Ask&#xD;
her in here."&#xD;
Babette left the room to ohey the direction,&#xD;
and a minute or two of silence followed. To&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon the interval seemed much longer&#xD;
than it really was, and she had extended her&#xD;
hand to ring the bell and ask the cause of the&#xD;
delay, when there came the sound of foot-steps,&#xD;
and the rustIc of silk, crossing the passage.&#xD;
Through the closed door she heard Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
icy's voice:&#xD;
"Just left, you say ?-not more than half&#xD;
an hour ago? It is strange I did not meet&#xD;
him. Do you know where he was going?"&#xD;
"No, madame," said Babette, in reply.&#xD;
Catching both the question and the reply,&#xD;
Mrc. Gordon dropped the bell-rope with a smile.&#xD;
"I might have known what detained her," she&#xD;
thought - and, as she thought it, the door&#xD;
opened.&#xD;
The two ladies met in the centre of the&#xD;
floor, and greeted each other with a moderate&#xD;
show of warmtb. They called each other "my&#xD;
dear Elmer," and "my dear Pauline," but, be-&#xD;
yond this, there was not much of effusion on&#xD;
either side. They shook hands, kissed lightly,&#xD;
spoke of the weather, and sat down opposite each&#xD;
other, like two ordinary acquaintances. Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley looked at ease, but in fact she was&#xD;
very far from that enviable state of mind. She&#xD;
remembered her former discomfiture in that&#xD;
house; and something in her cousin's face&#xD;
seemed to warn her that it might possibly be&#xD;
repeated.&#xD;
Nevertheless, she plunged boldly into con-&#xD;
versation, and began deploring the many social&#xD;
duties that had kept her so long from Morton&#xD;
House. "I am sure you believe that I would&#xD;
have come if I could," said she, looking at her&#xD;
cousin. "Oh, my dear Pauline, how wise you&#xD;
were in declining to reiinter society I I so&#xD;
often think of you, and envy you-so retired,&#xD;
so quiet, so surrounded by repose. As for&#xD;
poor me-I might as well be a galley-slave,&#xD;
for all the libedy I have! If it were n~t for&#xD;
the sake of my children, I really think I should&#xD;
give up society entirely. It tries my health so&#xD;
&#xD;
severely, and is so unsuited to my taste. A&#xD;
quiet day with you, now, would have been&#xD;
much more agreeable to me than all the gay&#xD;
times we have had at Annesdale."&#xD;
"I should have been glad to see you, if you&#xD;
had come," said Mrs. Gordon; "but pray, Eli-&#xD;
nor, don't trouble yourself to make excuses for&#xD;
not having done so. I understood your position&#xD;
quite well. It is hard for any one in the full&#xD;
tide of social life to be able to see much of an-&#xD;
other person who is entirely apart from that&#xD;
life."&#xD;
"My only consolation," said Mrs. Annesley,&#xD;
"has been that Morton sees so much of you.&#xD;
Riding continually about the country, he is able&#xD;
to come here more often' than I possibly could;&#xD;
and I have been so glad of it. I did not feel as&#xD;
if I were completely neglecting you, while he was&#xD;
my representative.~~&#xD;
"There was no cause for you to feel so,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Gordon, a little coldly.&#xD;
She was growing weary of these prolonged&#xD;
excuses, and did not see the point of them. Mrs.&#xD;
Annealey saw it, however, and timed her advance&#xD;
to it with careful exactitude. ~&#xD;
"In fact, Morton often unconsciously shames&#xD;
me," she said. "He does not let any thing&#xD;
stand in the way of his visits to you. I don't&#xD;
know when I have felt as much ashamed of my.&#xD;
self and my own neglect, as I did this morning.&#xD;
I saw him on the piazza with Irene Vernon-&#xD;
have you ever heard him speak of Irene Ver-&#xD;
non? Ah, she is such a charming girl, and so&#xD;
lovely I-Well, he had been there for some time,&#xD;
when suddenly I missed him. I went to see&#xD;
what had become of him, and I found Miss Ver-&#xD;
non alone. Morton, she said, had received a&#xD;
note from you, and left instantly to obey your&#xD;
summons-he even broke an engagement to ride&#xD;
with her, which he had made for this afternoon.&#xD;
My dear Pauline, when I heard this, I felt abso-&#xD;
lutely rebuked. Although my house is full of&#xD;
company, I at once ordered my carriage. I was&#xD;
determined not to let the hateful thing which we&#xD;
call society keep me any longer from coming to&#xD;
see you. I thought I would follow Morton, and&#xD;
meet the dear boy here, and that, after we had&#xD;
both enjoyed a visit to you, we could go home&#xD;
together. But your maid tells me that he has&#xD;
been here, and is already gone."&#xD;
"Yes, he has gone," said Mrs. Gordon.&#xD;
She saw the object of Mrs. Annesley's visit&#xD;
clearly enough now-saw it so clearly that all&#xD;
this careful fencing amused her not a little.&#xD;
She could have closed with her, and brought&#xD;
&#xD;
S SUGGESTION.                          143&#xD;
matters to an issue, very speedily, if she had&#xD;
chosen to do so; but she contented herself with&#xD;
this non-committal reply, and left her visitor to&#xD;
show her hand by force of necessity.&#xD;
"It is strange I did not meet him," said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley, in the same words she had al-&#xD;
ready used in speaking to Babette. "lie could&#xD;
not surely have returned to Annesdale?"&#xD;
An accent of interrogation made this a direct&#xD;
question, and, as such, Mrs. Gordon answered it.&#xD;
"He went to Tallahoma, I believe."&#xD;
"Indeed!"&#xD;
A pause after this. Within the bounds of&#xD;
civility, how could Mrs. Annesley ask the ques.&#xD;
tion which was next trembling on her tongue;&#xD;
and yet, how was it possible for her to forbear&#xD;
asking it? Who of us can account for certain&#xD;
instincts which at various times of our lives in.&#xD;
fluence our actions in greater or less deg~-ee?&#xD;
Such an instinct had caused her to follow Mor-&#xD;
ton from Annesdale, and such an instinct-now&#xD;
that she was on the threshold of the matter&#xD;
which had brought him to Mrs. Gordon-made&#xD;
her resolute to press forward, and in the face&#xD;
of civility (or of any thing else) learn what it&#xD;
was. After a short hesitation, she asked the&#xD;
question:&#xD;
"Pardon me, my dear Pauline, if I appear&#xD;
curious, but was it on your business that he went&#xD;
to Tallahoma?"&#xD;
"Certainly not," answered Mrs. Gordon. "I&#xD;
have no business in Tallahoma."&#xD;
"Then you do not know why he went?"&#xD;
"Yes, I chance to know why he went."&#xD;
"And I am not to know, I suppose?" said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley, flushing.&#xD;
Her cousin looked at her gravely and silently&#xD;
for a minute, before she replied.&#xD;
"I light answer that it is Morton's affair&#xD;
-not mine, Elinor," she said. "But since it is&#xD;
in part mine, and since I have a question con~&#xD;
corning it to ask you, I shall not violate Mor-&#xD;
ton's confidence in telling you. lie has gone to&#xD;
see Miss Tresham."&#xD;
Involuntarily, Mrs. Annesley started to her&#xD;
feet, and made a step towar~l the door.&#xD;
"I knew it!" she eried, passionately, "I&#xD;
knew it! Something warned me that he had&#xD;
gone to see that-" here she stopped sudden-&#xD;
ly, and sat down again. "I am a fool," she&#xD;
said, bitterly. "What equld I do, if ~ followed&#xD;
him? lie has gone his own way, without any&#xD;
regard to my wishes. ~11ow could I prevent&#xD;
him, if I tried, from doing so?"&#xD;
11cr cousin came over to~ h.er,~nd, stran~l~&#xD;

&#xD;
enough, sat down by her, laying one hand on&#xD;
her arm.&#xD;
"I will tell you what you can do-if you&#xD;
care to hear," she said.&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley drew back. The instinct of&#xD;
distrust between these two women was so strong&#xD;
that circumstances could hardly be imagined in&#xD;
which it would not have betrayed itself.&#xD;
"I do not understand," she said. "I thought&#xD;
you liked this-this girl!"&#xD;
"You are right," said' Mrs. Gordon, quietly.&#xD;
"I did like her. But that was when I knew very'&#xD;
little thout her. Since I have learned more, she&#xD;
is, so far as herself is concerned, an object of&#xD;
indifference to inc. So far as MortOn is con-&#xD;
cerned, however, she is an object of distrust,&#xD;
and, as such, to be dealt with-as summarily as&#xD;
possible. Elinor, do you wish Morton to marry&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
"Can you ask me such a question?"&#xD;
"Well, I have tested his infatuation thor-&#xD;
oughly, this morning; and it has been proof&#xD;
against the strongest plea that I could urge.&#xD;
Yet I forced him to concede that he would give&#xD;
her up, if it could be proved that she was un-&#xD;
worthy of him. If you wish to prevent his&#xD;
marrying her, your only hope is to prove this."&#xD;
"I know it," said Mrs. Annesley, "but I&#xD;
have tried -" She paused suddenly here,&#xD;
caught her breath, and was silent.&#xD;
"Yen have tried to prove it," said Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
don, quietly'. "Well, I know that. What I&#xD;
don't know, and what I would like to hear is,&#xD;
how you succeeded."&#xD;
~ did not succeed at all," answered Mrs.&#xD;
.Annes~ey, coldly. "What do you mean when&#xD;
you say that you know of my effort? You can-&#xD;
not possibly know-any thing."&#xD;
"I fancy I know every thing, or almost every&#xD;
thing," replied the other, with the same compo-&#xD;
sure as before. "Pray tell me, Eli{or, did you&#xD;
ever hear of a Mr. Henry St. John?"&#xD;
The shock of startled surprise caused by the&#xD;
question was unmistakable. But Mrs. Annesley&#xD;
never s~4rendered without a struggle.&#xD;
"1 do not understand you," she said.&#xD;
"Don't you?" said Mrs. Gordon, smiling&#xD;
slightly. "Perhaps I can assist your memory&#xD;
basking another question, then. Do you re-&#xD;
member an anonymous letter which, by way of&#xD;
jest, you once wrote to Edgar Annesley!"'&#xD;
"i-think I do.~'&#xD;
"I aai~ sure you must, for the events which&#xD;
followed it were too marked to be readily forgot.&#xD;
ten. Well, you may remember, also, that~I read&#xD;
&#xD;
that letter, and admired the ease with which you&#xD;
wrote a hand entirely unlike your own. It is&#xD;
twenty-four years since I saw that writing, but&#xD;
the consequences arising from the letter stampe~&#xD;
the~recollcction of it on my memory; and when&#xD;
a letter-when two letters-were shown to me&#xD;
this morning, I recognized the hand at once.&#xD;
Now will you tell me whether you ever heard&#xD;
of Mr. St. John?"&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley saw that all attempt at further&#xD;
concealment, was useless. However much or&#xD;
however little Mrs. Gordon knew, it was at least&#xD;
certain that she knew too much to wake denial&#xD;
safe. In an instant she remembered the man&#xD;
who had met Miss Tresham in the grounds of&#xD;
Anneadale, and what had been before merely a&#xD;
suspicion resolved itself at once into a certainty.&#xD;
"I have heard of him," she said-end then&#xD;
she added, "He is here!"&#xD;
"Yes," answered Mrs. Gordon, "he is here.&#xD;
I have no right to blame you for the means you&#xD;
took to obtain information concerning Miss&#xD;
Tresham; but it may surprise you to hear that&#xD;
by those means you have brought upon me the&#xD;
curse of my life-the worst enemy I have ever&#xD;
had, or can ever expect to bave 1"&#xD;
"Good Heavens!" cried Mrs. Annesley, in&#xD;
amazement. "How could I imagine-whom do&#xD;
you mean?"&#xD;
The answer came in four bitter words:&#xD;
"I mean my husband."&#xD;
"Your husband!"&#xD;
"I see that Morton has not told you my&#xD;
story."&#xD;
"Not one word," cried Mrs. Annesley, eager.&#xD;
ly, forgetting for the moment every thing else,&#xD;
and with the extreme of curiosity painted 'on&#xD;
her face, and quivering in her voice. "My dear&#xD;
Pauline," she went on, "you can surely trust me&#xD;
-you can surely confide in me!"&#xD;
"It is a matter of necessity to tell you some-&#xD;
thing of my life, Elinor," said hercousin, coldly.&#xD;
"Otherwise, I have learned that it is wise to&#xD;
'confide.' in nobody. You know that I was mar-&#xD;
ried. What I endured in my married life it is&#xD;
not worth while to tell you. I did endure it as&#xD;
long as endurance was possible. When' it be-&#xD;
came impossible, I fled from my tyrant and came&#xD;
here, hoping to find rest and shelter under my&#xD;
father's roof. How long I might have remained&#xD;
undiscovered I do not knew. Not long, I sus-&#xD;
pect. But, however that may be, it was your&#xD;
act which brought discovery upon me. The&#xD;
advertisement, which ,you inserted in the L6m.&#xD;
don 7?lme8 before I came here, has borne bitter&#xD;
&#xD;
fruit. I have been tracked to my place of&#xD;
refuge, and my child has been taken from me-&#xD;
perhaps forever!"&#xD;
"Taken from y~u! By whom?"&#xD;
"By my own. will. I have sent him away,&#xD;
that his father may not be able to find or claim&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"But Ido not understand," said Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
Icy, in a state of perplexity which, all things&#xD;
considered, was very natural. "Is it this Mr.&#xD;
St. John who is your husband?"&#xD;
"St. John! Are you mad? Have you ever&#xD;
seen him?"&#xD;
"Never."&#xD;
"He is a hanger-on of my husband's-his&#xD;
secretary, he was called-a sort of instrument&#xD;
for unprincipled purposes. Of character or&#xD;
position he has not even the shadow. Where&#xD;
he comes from, who ho is, or what he is, it is&#xD;
impossible to say. I only know him in the&#xD;
position of which I have spoken. I am sure&#xD;
he has never had a better one."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley looked horror-stricken.&#xD;
"And it was tkis man who wrote to me as&#xD;
the friend or relation of Miss Tresham !-it is&#xD;
t/sis man who is here now to see her!"&#xD;
"It is this man:"&#xD;
"And you-you let Morton go without telling&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"I told him much more than I have told you,&#xD;
and it had no effect upon him. Stop, Elinor "-&#xD;
as Mrs. Annesley, in uncontrollable agitation,&#xD;
rose to her feet-i' you can say nothing to Mor-&#xD;
ton that I have not already said. We have no&#xD;
proof of any thing beyond mere acquaintance&#xD;
between Miss Tresham and St. John. Think a&#xD;
moment. Did his reply to your letter contain&#xD;
nothing more?"&#xD;
"I don't need to think," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley, impatiently. "It contained not one&#xD;
word. Do you suppose I should have permitted&#xD;
matters to go on as long as they have in this&#xD;
way, if I had been able to produce a word of&#xD;
proof against her? My God! to think how help-&#xD;
less I am!" said she, striking her hand heavily&#xD;
on the cud of the sofa near which she sat. "To&#xD;
think that this artful creature 'may make Mor-&#xD;
ton marry her any day, and then - discovery&#xD;
would come too late."&#xD;
- "Have more faith in Morton," said her com-&#xD;
panion, gravely. "Believe, as I believe, that he&#xD;
will not take any extreme step, without giving&#xD;
you fair warning. In the me~an time, you must&#xD;
endeavor to find out something about Miss Tresh.&#xD;
am."&#xD;
&#xD;
"But how?"&#xD;
"Do I need to tell you how? Is not St.&#xD;
John here, and have I not described his charac-&#xD;
ter? You need feel no delicacy about approach-&#xD;
ing him."&#xD;
"But this is more difficult than you think,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Annesley, hesitatingly. "Morton&#xD;
would never forgive me if he knew of such a&#xD;
thing, and how am I to see the man without his&#xD;
knowing it?"&#xD;
"I have simply pointed out the way," said&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon. "The means I leave to yourself."&#xD;
"But you-you know this St. John, Could&#xD;
not you-"&#xD;
"No," answered Mrs. Gordon, with forbidding&#xD;
coldness. "Nothing would induce mc to see or&#xD;
hold any communication with him."&#xD;
"Not even for Morton's sake?"&#xD;
"Not even for Morton's sake."&#xD;
There was no appeal possible from that de-&#xD;
cided tone. Mrs. Annesley saw that, whether&#xD;
for success or failure, she must act for herself.&#xD;
After a minute's consideration, she said:&#xD;
"Can you tell me where I shall find Mr. St.&#xD;
John?"&#xD;
"It is probable that Babette can," said Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon, ringing the bell.&#xD;
Babette appeared, and proved at once the&#xD;
accuracy of her mistress's judgment. She was&#xD;
able to gratify Mrs. Annesley with every possi-&#xD;
ble particular concerning Mr. St. John; and,&#xD;
after that lady had heard all that could be of&#xD;
service to her, she dismissed her informant, and&#xD;
turned to Mrs. Gordon.&#xD;
"I don't see my way at all clearly, Pai~linc,"&#xD;
she said. "But I hope you will remember that&#xD;
I am acting according to your advice."&#xD;
"Accoriling to my suggestion," amended&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon. "I never give advice, Elmer."&#xD;
"If Morton discovers it, he will never forgive&#xD;
mc."&#xD;
"If you are so' much afraid of Morton, you:&#xD;
had better let him go his own way without inter.&#xD;
ference."&#xD;
In reply to this, Mrs. Annesiby rose from her&#xD;
seat.&#xD;
"One word, ~'auline," she said, as her cousin&#xD;
rose also. "Have you told Morton about' those&#xD;
letters?"&#xD;
"No; why should I?"&#xD;
"You will not do so?"&#xD;
"I have not the least intention of doing&#xD;
so."&#xD;
"Thank you," said Mrs. Annesley, impulsive.&#xD;
ly. ~fhen she added, with more ~of'.her usual&#xD;

MRS. GORDON'S SUGGESTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
manner: "My dear Pauline, no words can Ba;&#xD;
hew sorry I am that my act should have brought&#xD;
so ~nuch annoyance upon you. Can you possibi:&#xD;
forgive me for it?"&#xD;
"There is nothing to forgive," answered,&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon. "When you wrote that advertise&#xD;
meat-last summers was it not ?-you could no&#xD;
possibly have thought or known of me. Are yot&#xD;
going?"&#xD;
"I must. It is getting late, and I fear&#xD;
shall not be back at Annesdale in time for din&#xD;
ner. I will come to see you soon again. Wouk&#xD;
you adyise-that is, would you suggest, that I&#xD;
should offer money to this $t. John?"&#xD;
"I can only say there is no reason why you&#xD;
should hesitate to do so."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley repeated her thanks, and took&#xD;
leave. Once in the carriage, she looked at her&#xD;
watch and made a calculation of time, with refer.&#xD;
ence to dinner. Having made it, she pulled the&#xD;
check. string and said: "Tallahoma - Mrs.&#xD;
Marks's."&#xD;
Poor Mrs. Marks had not recovered from&#xD;
the combine~l effects of Morton's visit, and her&#xD;
husband's unusual assertion of himself, when&#xD;
this new astonishment was prepared for her.&#xD;
Having seen the table finally cleared oft; and&#xD;
having rid herself of the children by dispatch-&#xD;
ing them in a body to the "old field," of which&#xD;
mention has before been made, she sat down&#xD;
with a very heavy heart, to darnvarious small&#xD;
stockings full of various large holes. As she&#xD;
darned, she *sighed; and, in fact, sighs were&#xD;
more frequent than stitches with her. The&#xD;
kind soul was lamenting her husband's reso-&#xD;
lution, and grieving much over the loss of her&#xD;
favorite, "Miss Katharine." She even shed a&#xD;
few tears, and wiped them away with the leg of&#xD;
Jack's soak. Impatient thoughts on the per.&#xD;
versity of human circumstances came to her, as&#xD;
* they had come to Katharine at Anneadale, as&#xD;
they come to all of us when people and events&#xD;
prove "contrary." Oh, why cannot things go&#xD;
right? ~*hy cannot people act as they ought&#xD;
to? Why cannot circumstances cease to fret,&#xD;
or goad, or restrain us? What is the reason&#xD;
that 'every thing has its dash of bitterness, and&#xD;
that life seems to vibrate, like the pendulum of&#xD;
acloek, continually, between the painful and the&#xD;
disagreeablee 1' This is the strain of thought that&#xD;
Is going up to heaven on the wings of every&#xD;
minute, like the broken cry of an imprisoned&#xD;
spirit, panting, ab! how vainly, to be free.&#xD;
What is the good of it all? Ahi granted.-.&#xD;
&#xD;
y what, indeed, is the good of it all? But then,&#xD;
t friends, dwellers upon the earth, co-heirs of the&#xD;
~ curse laid on Adam, the question is, not what is&#xD;
the good of it, but how are we to help it? There&#xD;
I is but one way known to men-the way of child-&#xD;
like faith-and few of us are great enough, or&#xD;
strong enough, to follow that.&#xD;
Mrs. Marks was still darning, still heaving&#xD;
sighs, and still dropping a tear or two occasion-&#xD;
ally, when she was startled by the sound of a&#xD;
knock at the door. The dining-room was in the&#xD;
I hack part of the house, and so it chanced that&#xD;
she had neither seen nor heard the arrival of the&#xD;
Annesley carriage; so it chanced, also, that, with&#xD;
her work in her hand, she went out to answer the&#xD;
knock, and found herself face to face with no less&#xD;
* a person than Mrs. Annesley.&#xD;
Her consternation was almost as great as her&#xD;
* surprise. The fear of something additionally&#xD;
disagreeable-a fear vaguely inspired by Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley's face-instantly seized her. Somehow&#xD;
or other, ~the greeting was accomplished, and&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley was ushered into the dining-&#xD;
room. When she had been installed in the&#xD;
* most comfortable chair, and Mrs. Marks was sit-&#xD;
ting opposite, with her darning mechanically re-&#xD;
tained in her hand, a few remarks were exchanged,&#xD;
and then the visitor opened the serious busiacss&#xD;
of the occasion.&#xD;
"No doubt, you are surprised to see me,&#xD;
* Mrs. Marks," she said, graciously. "In fact, I&#xD;
ought to apologize for such a startling visit.&#xD;
But, being in Tallahoma, I thought I would stop&#xD;
for a few minutes; and I also thought that I&#xD;
might find Morton here. I am anxious to see&#xD;
him on a matter of business before he returns to&#xD;
Annesdale."&#xD;
"I am very sorry that you have come a little&#xD;
too late," said Mrs. Marks, with the utmost sin-&#xD;
cerity. '~ Mr. Annesley was here, but he left a&#xD;
short while ago; and I think he said he was go-&#xD;
ing back to Annesdale"&#xD;
"He was here, and left only a short while&#xD;
ago! Oh, how provoking!" said Mrs. Annesley.&#xD;
"What an instance of my bad luck! But&#xD;
pray, Mrs. Marks, what does a 'short while'&#xD;
mean? Do you think, for instance, that I could&#xD;
overtake him before he gets home?"&#xD;
"Oh, no. I am sure you couldn't," said&#xD;
Mrs. Marks, with decision. "It's been a good&#xD;
hour since he left, and he must have reached An-&#xD;
nesdale by this time-or, indeed, before this. He&#xD;
didn't stay long," she went on, telling of her own.&#xD;
accord the very thing Mrs. Annesley was anxious&#xD;
to hear. "He called to see Miss Tresham, and,&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Tresham not being at home, he left very&#xD;
soon."&#xD;
"I thought Miss Tresham was at home,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Annesley, a little stiffly. "She left&#xD;
Annesdale this morning."&#xD;
"She came here this morning," said Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, in an aggrieved tone, "but she is gone&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"Gone!" Mrs. Annesley simply opened her&#xD;
eyes. It could not be possible that exposure had&#xD;
come so soon, and come of itself? "Gone! Bx-&#xD;
cuse me, but you surprise me very much. I&#xD;
thought she came back to recommended teach-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
"She went to Saxford to-day," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, unconsciously lifting the stocking, which&#xD;
she still held, to her eyes, from which one or two&#xD;
tears were drawn forth by that oft-repeated state-&#xD;
ment. She stood extremely in awe of the ele-&#xD;
gant mistress of Annesdale, but the latter was a&#xD;
woman, after all, and she had dropped in to pay&#xD;
a sociable visit, and Mrs. Marks's heart was sorely&#xD;
in need of a confidante, and so she began to open&#xD;
the floodgates of her feelings, and to express in&#xD;
words what she had heretofore only expressed in&#xD;
sighs.&#xD;
"She went to Saxford," she repeated-very&#xD;
much as she might have said, "She went to be&#xD;
buried! "-" lt is hard on me, Mrs. Annesley-~--it&#xD;
is certainly hard on me! I never meddled with&#xD;
Miss Tresham's affairs in my life-I never said a&#xD;
word, either to her or to anybody else, about&#xD;
them-and yet you'd hardly believe all the trou-&#xD;
ble and worry that's been in this house this day-&#xD;
all on account of Miss Tresham's affairs, and Miss&#xD;
Tresham's visitors, and because Miss Tresham&#xD;
has taken it into her head to go to Saxford!"&#xD;
"But why has she gone?" asked Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley, with a very uncivil disregard of Mrs.&#xD;
Marks's personal grievances.&#xD;
"Everybody asks me that," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, "and Miss Tresham told me no more&#xD;
about why she was going than she told my little&#xD;
Nelly playing out in the yard. I am sure it&#xD;
seemed natural enough to me that she should go&#xD;
-she often does go to see her priest-but every-&#xD;
body seems surprised about it, and Mr. Marks is&#xD;
so provoked that he says if she don't come back&#xD;
on Monday, and if she won't explain every thing&#xD;
about Mr. St. John, she"- second application&#xD;
of the stocking as a pocket-handkerchief-" will&#xD;
have to leave us."&#xD;
This good news was so unexpected, and so&#xD;
startling, that for a minute Mrs. Annesley scarce-&#xD;
ly realized It. Then a glow of satisfied pleasure&#xD;
&#xD;
began to steal over her, and she saw how well&#xD;
Fate was fighting the battle of which she had&#xD;
been almost ready to despair.&#xD;
"Really, you astonish me!" she said. "I h~ad&#xD;
no idea of any thing like this. Miss Tresham only&#xD;
left my house this morning, and now to have gone&#xD;
away so unexpectedly-and, you say, without any&#xD;
explanation?~~&#xD;
"Without even so much as a word of expla-&#xD;
nation," answered Mrs. Marks, who was now&#xD;
fully launched into her theme. "Perhaps I&#xD;
ought to have said something to ker, Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
Icy; but my head was quite upset-and then she&#xD;
was in such a hurry to get to the hotel before the&#xD;
stage left that she didn't give me time hardly to&#xD;
breathe. I'm sure I didn't pay any attention to&#xD;
what Mrs. Gordon said about her-I mean"-&#xD;
hastily correcting herself with a timely recollec-&#xD;
tion that Mrs. Gordon was Mrs. Annesley's cousin&#xD;
-" that I felt confident there was some mistake&#xD;
-but it seems to me all the same, that Miss&#xD;
Katharine might have told me something before&#xD;
she left, so that I could have explained it to&#xD;
Richard. But she never said a word."&#xD;
"Nothing about Mr. St. John?"&#xD;
"Not a syllable."&#xD;
"How extremely singular!" said Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley, very slowly and very gravely-so gravely&#xD;
that Mrs. Marks began to feel as if she had much&#xD;
underrated the importance of Miss Tresham's&#xD;
reticence, and Miss Tresham's departure. It&#xD;
was astonishing how infinitely more Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley's opinion on the subject weighed with her,&#xD;
than that of her husband had done I&#xD;
"It was strange," she said, "though I didn't&#xD;
think of it at the time. Miss Katharine is so&#xD;
nice, Mrs. Annesley, and we are all so fond of her,&#xD;
that somehow it never struck me that-that, as&#xD;
you say, it was singular for her to give no expla-&#xD;
nation about Mr. St. John."&#xD;
"Perhaps he may be related to her," said&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley, carelessly-she began to be aware&#xD;
that she had betrayed more'interest than it was&#xD;
proper to show in Miss Tresham's affairs-" your&#xD;
governess herself is a very lady-like person; but&#xD;
people in her position often have very disreputa-&#xD;
ble relations, you know."&#xD;
"Mr. St. John is very much of a gentleman,&#xD;
indeed," said Mrs. Marks, greatly astonished.&#xD;
"I am sure nobody could say that there is any&#xD;
thing disreputable about him. But I don't think&#xD;
he is any relation of Miss Katharine's; that is"&#xD;
-a short pau~e-" I really don't know. I never&#xD;
heardiaer say that she had any relations."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley knew this before, but none the&#xD;
&#xD;

less did she think it necessary to look as much&#xD;
shocked as if' she heard the statement for the&#xD;
first time.&#xD;
"No relations!" she exclaimed. "A girl of&#xD;
her age! Why, that is dreadful! Really, Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, you must excuse me if I say that I won-&#xD;
der very much at your courage in engaging such&#xD;
a person to enter your house and teach your chil-&#xD;
dren."&#xD;
By way of reply, Mrs. ~Iarks only stared. It&#xD;
had yet to dawn upon her comprehension that&#xD;
the misfortune of having no relations could pos-&#xD;
sibly be made a social crime.'&#xD;
"It is hard on a young thing like Miss Kath.&#xD;
anne "-she l~xsgan, when Mrs. Annesley inter.&#xD;
erupted her in her grandest way.&#xD;
"I1~ is not of Miss Tresham I am talking,&#xD;
Mrs. Marks, but of her position. Of course, it is&#xD;
only reasonable that when a girl of her age, and&#xD;
I suppose I may say of her refined appearance,&#xD;
talks of having no relations, she simply means&#xD;
one of two things-either that her relations do&#xD;
not acknowledge her, or else that they are them-&#xD;
selves not fit to be acknowledged. In either&#xD;
case, as I remarked before, I think you must&#xD;
possess a great deal of courage to admit her to&#xD;
your family as you have done, and to be willing&#xD;
to trust her as you seem disposed to do. For&#xD;
my part, I confess that I should shudder to think&#xD;
ef assuming such a responsibility; but then my&#xD;
conscience is very sensitive."&#xD;
"She was so nice,".said Mrs. Marks, deprecat-&#xD;
ingly, much impressed by this forcible view of the&#xD;
matter, apd much aghast at being brought in&#xD;
guilty, by implication at least, of a callous con-&#xD;
science.&#xD;
"So nice!" repeated Mrs. Annesley, in a&#xD;
tone of overpowering scorn. She forgot herself&#xD;
and her part, for a moweiit, and let the real ear-&#xD;
nestness which she felt come to th9 surface, as&#xD;
the thought rushed over her that all the trouble&#xD;
now weighing upon her, all the fear that had&#xD;
made her life wretched for months past, resulted&#xD;
from tl~ act of this woman-this woman so far&#xD;
out of her life, so apart from all her associations.&#xD;
She, had scarcely done more than bow' to Mrs.&#xD;
Marks when they chanced to meet, once a year&#xD;
or so, on the village street, and yet the fateful&#xD;
sisters had thrown their shuttle, and 'across the&#xD;
warp and woof of her own life had woven the&#xD;
threads of this oth~r homely existence. Common&#xD;
as such things are, when they come home to us&#xD;
as they came home to her, it is hard not to feel&#xD;
startled by them-hard to realize that they form&#xD;
the daily history of that which we call circum-&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.&#xD;
stance! Two strangers met by chance in the&#xD;
parlor of that Charleston hotel; the girl's face&#xD;
brightened into a winning smile, and the elder&#xD;
woman's heart was touched; a few words were&#xD;
said, and lo! the whole current of life was&#xD;
changed, not only for them, but for others then&#xD;
scattered in widely-different corners of the civil-&#xD;
ized world, then going each his different way,&#xD;
laughing, talking, smiling, weeping, perhaps, and&#xD;
knowing not what had been done-knowing not&#xD;
that, on a single breath, as it were, every aim&#xD;
and purpose of existence had been staked and&#xD;
changed-for better or worse, who could tell 1'&#xD;
Surely only He of whom it is well to think in the&#xD;
midst of such reflections as these-He who draws&#xD;
~us each into our appointed path, and does not&#xD;
leave us to be the blind victims of a merciless&#xD;
Chance.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," said Mrs. Annesley,&#xD;
recovering herself with a faint, forced laugh. "I&#xD;
suppose, of course, you think Miss Tresham nice,&#xD;
but I was really unable to discover her attrac-&#xD;
tions. What a beautiful view this room has!&#xD;
Do you cultivate your garden much?"&#xD;
She rose and walked to the window. Well&#xD;
disciplined as she was, and thoroughly accus-&#xD;
tomed to self-control, she could not have sat still&#xD;
a moment longer and face the woman 'who had&#xD;
brought all this anxiety and possible grief upon&#xD;
her. An outbreak of some sort must have come,&#xD;
and she wisely prevented it by walking away and&#xD;
gazing absently into the garden, while Mrs. Marks&#xD;
willingly forsook the subject of Miss Tresham&#xD;
for that of her celery and winter lettuce.&#xD;
As she talked, Mrs. Annesley's fertile brain&#xD;
ran over expedient after expedient for seeing&#xD;
St. John, and dismissed each as impracticable.&#xD;
How was she to do it ?-kow was she to do it?&#xD;
This was the accompaniment in her brain to&#xD;
Mrs. Marks's conversation. Yet she was as far&#xD;
as ever from the solution of her difficulty, and&#xD;
she almost began to despair of its accomplish-&#xD;
ment, when she accidentally caught sight of a&#xD;
man's head above a rose-bush in the garden. In&#xD;
a second, she felt sure that, by some strange co-&#xD;
incidence, her opportunity was here, ready to her&#xD;
hand-that St. John stood before her.&#xD;
She did not stop to consider why she knew&#xD;
that it was he, she did not think for a moment&#xD;
how he came there. She only felt, by a strange,&#xD;
intuitive thrill, that her desire was gratified more&#xD;
speedily and more completely than she could pos-&#xD;
sibly have hoped for it to be, and that, come&#xD;
what would, she must seize the fortunate oppor-&#xD;
tunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
ON GUARD.&#xD;
&#xD;
Yet how could she escape? how get rid of&#xD;
Mrs. Marks? That became as great a difficulty&#xD;
now as the means of meeting St. John had been&#xD;
before. As she asked herself the question, how-&#xD;
ever, she saw that there was no need of imme-&#xD;
diate haste. Plainly, St. John had entered the&#xD;
garden to bide his time, and plainly he meant to&#xD;
wait till that time came. His head had now dis-&#xD;
appeared from above the rose-bush, but Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley marked the place where she had seen&#xD;
it, and a thin, pale wreath of smoke, which now&#xD;
and then floated up, sufficiently indicated his&#xD;
present position, and sufficiently provd~ how he&#xD;
was whiling away the period of waiting.&#xD;
"What is he waiting for?" Mrs. Annesley&#xD;
began to consider. "Is it Miss Tresham, or is&#xD;
it to come in and see Mrs. Marks ?-Ah ! "-as&#xD;
a sudden recollection flashed over her-" it is for&#xD;
me to leave. He sees the carriage before the&#xD;
gate, of course, and he has decided to remain in&#xD;
the garden and smoke a cigar until the coast is&#xD;
clear. There could not possibly be a better op-&#xD;
portunity for seeing him, if only I could get rid&#xD;
of this horrid woman! But how on earth am I&#xD;
to do that?"&#xD;
How, indeed! For, while the blue smoke&#xD;
floated pensively over the rose-bushes, and while&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley could scarcely keep her impatient&#xD;
hand from the latch of the door near which she&#xD;
stood, Mrs. Marks steadily held her ground, and&#xD;
steadily poured forth her flow of language with a&#xD;
profound unconsciousness that seemed as if it&#xD;
could be shaken by nothing less than a moral&#xD;
earthquake.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
ON GUARD.&#xD;
SUDDENLY the ill-matched companions were&#xD;
startled by a terrible uproar in the hack yard&#xD;
-the deep, angry growl of a dog was followed&#xD;
by the scampering rush of two animals in a&#xD;
short, mad chase, and then the cries of inarticu-&#xD;
late distress, which dumb beasts can occasion-&#xD;
ally utter in their own behalf; fell painfully on&#xD;
the ear. Mingled with these came a Babel of&#xD;
sound-men shouting, women running, cries,&#xD;
commands, aiA indistinguishable confusion-in&#xD;
the midst of which a panting little negro rushed&#xD;
to the dining-room door.&#xD;
"Mistiss, Rollo's caught the calf, and Uncle&#xD;
Jake says as how he's goin' to tar it to pieces!"&#xD;
"Good Gracious!" cried Mrs. Marks, in con-&#xD;
&#xD;
149&#xD;
&#xD;
sternation. "What did he let the dog catch it&#xD;
for! What will your master say! Tell him to&#xD;
beat him-do any thing to make him let got I&#xD;
always told Mr. Marks he better not bring that&#xD;
bull-dog here," she added, as the child darted&#xD;
away. "I knew he was sure to do mischief-&#xD;
Goodness! what awful sounds !..-Mrs. Annesley,&#xD;
if you'll excuse me, I'll-"&#xD;
The sentence was not finished, and Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley had no opportunity to reply~ The up-&#xD;
roar grew worse, and Mrs. Marks followed the&#xD;
example of the rest of the household-she flew&#xD;
to the scene of action.&#xD;
If the victim of Rollo's unreasoning fury had&#xD;
been a child instead of a calf, it is to be feared&#xD;
that Mrs. Annesley would equally have regarded&#xD;
the episode in the light of a fortunate and provi-&#xD;
dential relief. The instant that the last flutter&#xD;
of Mrs. Marks's dress had vanished down the&#xD;
passage, she opened the door that led out upon&#xD;
the side-piazza, crossed it, and the next momexit&#xD;
was walking rapidly down the garden-path.&#xD;
She was so lightly and delicately shod that&#xD;
her step made very little sound on the smooth&#xD;
gravel, and St. John, who was comfortably smok-&#xD;
'inn- his cigar iii a sheltered nook-waiting, as&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley had shrewdly suspected, for the&#xD;
departure of the carriage-was completely taken&#xD;
by surprise when, without any warning, this ele-&#xD;
gant figure stood before him.&#xD;
Instinctively he took the cigar from his lips,&#xD;
and rose to his feet. This was not Mrs. Marks,&#xD;
but none the less was it somebody much more&#xD;
at home in the garden than he had any right to&#xD;
be. Therefore, the first words that formed on&#xD;
his lips were words of apology for his presence&#xD;
there.&#xD;
"Excuse me," he said. "I fear I am a tres-&#xD;
passer; but I am waiting to see Mrs. Marks."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley bowed graciously, and, instead&#xD;
of retreating, swept a step nearer.&#xD;
"Mrs. Marks is occupied just now," she said,&#xD;
"and I came out to look at the garden.. Don't&#xD;
disturb yourself; I beg. I shall not Interrupt&#xD;
you. Mr. Marks told me something about a&#xD;
perennial," added she, glancing round. "Don~t'&#xD;
let me trouble you, but pray do you chance to&#xD;
know where it is?"&#xD;
St. John smiled, and replied in the nega-&#xD;
tive.&#xD;
"I am a stranger," he said, "and this is the&#xD;
first time I have ever ventured to invade Mrs.&#xD;
Marks's garden. I am sorry that I cannot tell&#xD;
-you any thing about the perennial."&#xD;
"You have no idea where it ~&#xD;

150                  MORTON HOUSE.                                                                      ONGAD                                 5&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have not the least idea where it is."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesle3* gave a little sigh of resigna-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Such a pity!" she said, and, as she said it,&#xD;
she ran her eye with apparent carelessness, but&#xD;
with really keen attention, over St. John's per-&#xD;
son.&#xD;
The result of her observation was discour-&#xD;
aging. Despite all that Mrs. Gordon had told&#xD;
her, and despite her own distrust of the man,&#xD;
she could not believe that it would be expedient&#xD;
or oven possible to approach him with any over-&#xD;
tures of bribery. Adventurer though he was-&#xD;
sharper though he might bc-he at least bore&#xD;
all the outward semblance of a gentleman; and,&#xD;
as he stood before her-perfectly self-possessed,&#xD;
notwithstanding the equivocal position which he&#xD;
occupied, and lightly holding his cigar between&#xD;
two fingers as he returned her scrutiny-she felt&#xD;
as much at a loss how to address him as she had&#xD;
before felt at a loss how to reach him. It was&#xD;
hardly wonderful. This man was so different-in&#xD;
every particular so essentially different-from the&#xD;
man her fancy had created, that the discrepancy&#xD;
in itself startled her.&#xD;
*   As she hesitated, St. John, on his side, had&#xD;
time for observation and consideration. The&#xD;
perennial excuse had not deceived him. He had&#xD;
seen at a glance that this fine lady-whoever or&#xD;
whatever she might be-had come into the gar-&#xD;
den to meet himself. At first he had supposed&#xD;
that her motive might have been one of mere&#xD;
eu~iosity; but, as she still kept her place in front&#xD;
of him) a~ he felt her keen black eyes reading&#xD;
his face, and, as he saw the doubt unconsciously&#xD;
stamped upon her own face, an instinct of her&#xD;
real purpose came over him.&#xD;
"There is something she wants to get out of&#xD;
me," he thought. "Well, let her try. It will&#xD;
be strange if in the end I don't succeed in get.&#xD;
lang eos~siderably more out of her than she Lhinks&#xD;
of ez~ bargains for!"&#xD;
"Perhaps there is something else I can do&#xD;
f4~ryQu~"~he said, as she remained silent for some&#xD;
~ .Anacslcy started a little, and recovered&#xD;
1~e~self.&#xD;
"There is nothing, thank you," she said.&#xD;
"I won't disturb you any longer. Good-day."&#xD;
She bowed slightly, and walked away-three&#xD;
steps. Then she paused, and, turning back,&#xD;
spoke again.&#xD;
"Perhaps there is something I can do for&#xD;
you," she said. "Am I r~ot right in supposing&#xD;
that it has been my presence which has kept&#xD;
&#xD;
you from seeing Mrs. Marks? Shall I be obli-&#xD;
ging, and take my departure?"&#xD;
"I could not presume to ask such a thing,"&#xD;
answered he, bowing gravely.&#xD;
"It would not be very much of a presump-&#xD;
tion," answered Mrs. Annesley, smiling gracious-&#xD;
ly. "A friend of Mrs. Marks-you are a friend&#xD;
of Mrs. Marks, I suppose?"&#xD;
"I scarcely think it probable that Mrs.&#xD;
Marks would allow'me to claim that honor."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley arched her eyebrows and&#xD;
looked around the garden. Plainly she meant&#xD;
to say, "Not a friend of Mrs. ~Yarks ,and yet&#xD;
here!"&#xD;
The coolness of the glance amused St. John,&#xD;
and he answered it more on account of this&#xD;
amusement than because there was any absolute&#xD;
necessity for doing so.&#xD;
"Under these circumstances, you are sur-&#xD;
prised to see mc here?" he said. "But I think&#xD;
that, when I explain the reason of my presence&#xD;
to Mrs. Marks, she will not regard my intrusion&#xD;
as unpardonable."&#xD;
"I am sure Mrs. Marks is always glad to re-&#xD;
ceive Miss Tresham's friends," said Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
Icy, using the very words which Mrs. Marks her-&#xD;
self had used that morning-thc words whioh&#xD;
had encouraged St. John to return and endeavor&#xD;
to learn from her something more than he had&#xD;
been able to glean from her husband. The coin-&#xD;
chienee struck him, and, together with the un-&#xD;
suspected sound of Katharine's name, made him&#xD;
look sharply at the speaker.&#xD;
"Excuse me," he said. "I do not under-&#xD;
stand."&#xD;
But, as it happened, Mrs. Annesley had grown&#xD;
tired of this aimless fencing; and, besides, she&#xD;
had not time for it. At any moment Mrs. Marks&#xD;
might come in search of her, and the opportunity&#xD;
she had been so anxious to secure would thus be&#xD;
hopelessly lost. Making a rapid calculation for&#xD;
and against success, she decided to close at once&#xD;
with her slippery opponent.&#xD;
"Excuse me," she said, with a smile. "I&#xD;
fancied that I was speaking to Mr. St. John."&#xD;
The smile told St. John infinitely more than&#xD;
the words. There was a shade of malicious&#xD;
meaning in it, which, under the circumstances,&#xD;
was far from wise, but which Mrs. Annesley&#xD;
would have found it hard to con~ol. It was so&#xD;
pleasant to turn the tables on him in this style-&#xD;
so pleasant to show him, in three words, how&#xD;
well she knew every thing about him! But still,&#xD;
it was a blunder. It put St. John on his guard,&#xD;
and it madehim set his teeth and think:" Con-&#xD;
&#xD;
found the woman~ What deviltry has she got&#xD;
in her head?" It galled' him, too; but he had&#xD;
a very good armory of his own at command, and&#xD;
from it he immediately selected his favorite&#xD;
weapon of covert mockery.&#xD;
"I am deeply flattered," he said, with a bow.&#xD;
"I had no idea that my name had been fortu-&#xD;
nate enough to attain any degree of notoriety.&#xD;
I do not think that I have the pleasure of an ac-&#xD;
quaintance with yourself, madam."&#xD;
"You have probably never heard of me,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Annesley, quietly. "I am a person of&#xD;
no consequence whatever-out of my own fam-&#xD;
ily. It has merely chanced that I have heard&#xD;
of you," she went on. "Mrs. Marks is very&#xD;
much attached to Miss Tresliam, and, in speak-&#xD;
ing of her, she mentioned your name to mc. 1&#xD;
also am a friend of Miss Tresham's," said the&#xD;
mistress of Annesdale, with a virtuous expres-&#xD;
sion of face, "and as such, I am glad. to meet&#xD;
you-glad to be able to say a few words to you, if&#xD;
you will allow me to do ~&#xD;
"I am at your service."&#xD;
"Let us sit down, then. Since you are kind&#xD;
enough not to consider me impertinent, I should&#xD;
like to be very frank with you. I am generally&#xD;
frank with everybody. Experience has shown&#xD;
me that it is so much the best way."&#xD;
They sat down. Just behind the short bench&#xD;
from which St. John had risen, was a wall of&#xD;
running ivy; on each side rose tall shrubs, which,&#xD;
although bare, still made a seclusion of the little&#xD;
nook. Regarded from a short distance, the two&#xD;
figures, who had the nook to themselves, might&#xD;
easily have passed for a pair of lovers. Consid-&#xD;
ered as they actually were, they much more re-&#xD;
sembled two ad~pit chess-players, who sat down&#xD;
equally matched to a game in which skill and&#xD;
care could alone determinee the result. Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley made the first move-St. John contenting&#xD;
himself with keen watchfulness and attention.&#xD;
Said the lady: "I must begin what I have to&#xD;
say, by explaining why I say it. I know Miss&#xD;
Tresham quite well, and"-a gulp.-A' like her&#xD;
very much. You can imagine my surprise, there-&#xD;
fore, when I heard from Mrs. Marks that she has&#xD;
left her late home in a very sudden and myste-&#xD;
i-ious manner, and that it is more than doubtful&#xD;
whether she will be received again, when she re-&#xD;
turns."&#xD;
St. John started. This was certainly news to&#xD;
him. Mrs. Annesley noted the start, and went&#xD;
on:&#xD;
"I think it right to tell ~,ou, Mr. St. John,&#xD;
that the ground on which Miss Tresham will be&#xD;
&#xD;
dismissed from Mrs. Marks's house when she re-&#xD;
turns, is that of her connection with yourself.&#xD;
Mr. Marks has finally decided that unless a satis-&#xD;
factory explanation of this connection is given, he&#xD;
cannot retain Misa Tresham as a governess.&#xD;
Now, as a friend of Miss Tresham's, will you&#xD;
allow me to ask if it does not occur to you that&#xD;
it is your duty to remove the elcaid from Miss&#xD;
Tresham's name byat once making thi3 explana-&#xD;
tion?"&#xD;
"You have set me an admirable example of&#xD;
candor, madam," said St. John. "Do not be&#xD;
offended if I follow it, and, imitating your frank-&#xD;
ness, ask if it does not occur to you that it is&#xD;
quite impossible for you to judge of the affairs&#xD;
of people who are strangers to you?"&#xD;
"I thought Ihad explained that Miss Tresham&#xD;
is not a stranger to we."&#xD;
"Evidently she is a stranger so far as re-&#xD;
gards her confidence, or else you would not need&#xD;
to make this appeal to mc."&#xD;
"You do not intend to heed the appeal,&#xD;
then? ~&#xD;
"Imitating your frankness again, I must de-&#xD;
cline to answer that question."&#xD;
"Because I am not personally concerned in&#xD;
the matter?" asked Mrs Annesley, resolutely&#xD;
resolved to keep her temper under any provo-&#xD;
cation.&#xD;
"Yes-because I am unable to perceive that&#xD;
you have any personal interest in the matter."&#xD;
"Suppose that I assume-that, if necessary,&#xD;
I am willing to prove to you-that I have an in-&#xD;
terest in the matter, that I have a personal ~rea-&#xD;
son for wishing to clear up the mystery around&#xD;
Miss Tresham, will you still refuse to give me&#xD;
the explanation?"&#xD;
"I regret to say that I am compelled to d~&#xD;
so.',&#xD;
"Do you not take Miss Tresham herself into&#xD;
consideration-her character? Do you not ap-&#xD;
preciate how badly this reticence looks - for&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
St. John only smiled. Evidently, if it had&#xD;
been courteous to do so, he wonld have shrugged&#xD;
his shoulders, and said, "What is that to me?"&#xD;
As it was, his face said it for' him, and Mrs, An-&#xD;
nesley read his face. That instant she shifted&#xD;
her ground.&#xD;
"I am anxious to obtain certain items of in-&#xD;
formation about Miss Tresham," she said; "items&#xD;
which can harm neither her nor any one else. Do&#xD;
you know any one who, for a liberal reward, would&#xD;
show me how to obtain these?"&#xD;
She looked steadily at St. John, and St. John&#xD;

THE SIC&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
returned her gaze without the quiver of an eye-&#xD;
lash.&#xD;
"I do nOt know any one whom you could&#xD;
employ for such a purpose," he answered.&#xD;
"No one atall?".&#xD;
"No one at all."&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley rose from her seat, and drew&#xD;
her shawl gracefully around her.&#xD;
"It is growing~chilly," she said, "I must go&#xD;
* in. I regret to have disturbed you, Mr. St. John.&#xD;
rray, don't let me di~turb you further-pray,&#xD;
don't get up. I suppose it is quite useless to&#xD;
look for that perennial. Good-day."&#xD;
A bow on both sides, and they separated.&#xD;
The worsted player retired with all the dig-&#xD;
nity she could summon to her aid; but, as she&#xD;
swept slowly down the garden-walk, she struck&#xD;
one gloved hand angrily against the other.&#xD;
"I went to work wrong," she thought.&#xD;
"Some way or other, I went to work wrong!&#xD;
The consequence is, that this wretch has com-&#xD;
pletely baffled me, and that I am not an inch&#xD;
nearer to my end than I was before." '&#xD;
As for St. John, the first thing he did, when&#xD;
he was alone, was to relight his cigar, and the&#xD;
second was to indulge in a laugh of properly-sub~.&#xD;
fined tone.&#xD;
"Oh, these women I these women I" he said&#xD;
to himself. "How is it that the devil teaches&#xD;
them so much cunning, and yet lets them over-&#xD;
reach themselves so completely? Well "-with&#xD;
a long puff-" this has certainly been something&#xD;
*that I did not bargain for-a little dash of in-&#xD;
trigue that I did not expect in coming to look&#xD;
up my respectable friend who asks mc to tea.&#xD;
I fancy Mrs. Gordon is not the only person now&#xD;
who has discovered the identity of H. G. After&#xD;
this, I can put my hand on the writer of the&#xD;
advertisement and the letters whenever I choose.&#xD;
I have two things yet to find out, however-first,&#xD;
her name; and, secondly, her motive."&#xD;
A thought struck him. He rose from his&#xD;
seat, walked to the garden-gate, let himself out,&#xD;
and sauntered down the road to where Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesle~r's carriage stood, with Mrs. Annesley's&#xD;
coachman and footman in attendance. Stopping&#xD;
to admire the horses, he easily fell into conver-&#xD;
sation with the servants, and in five minutes had&#xD;
learned every thing that he wished to know. No&#xD;
human being was ever so fond of boasting as the&#xD;
family-negro of the old r6gi'me, and Mrs. Annes-&#xD;
Icy's servants were no exception to the general&#xD;
rule. No sooner was it evident that St. John&#xD;
was a stranger, than their tongues were loosed&#xD;
on the glories of Annesdale and of the Annesley&#xD;
&#xD;
family. Mistiss and niistiss's various splendors,&#xD;
Mass Morton, and Mass Morton's horses and&#xD;
dogs, were the favorite topics-the last espe-&#xD;
cially; and St. John, who never forgot any thing,&#xD;
had no difficulty in identifying this much vaunted&#xD;
"Mass Morton" with the Mr. Annesley whom he&#xD;
had met in the grounds of Anneadnle. Every&#xD;
thing wa~ so clear to him that he could have&#xD;
laughed to himself as he stood on the sidewalk&#xD;
smoking his cigar, and listening lazily, as John&#xD;
and Peyton by turns descanted on the absorb-&#xD;
ing subject. It was quite a shock to Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley when she came out and found him there.&#xD;
"Mr. St. John!" she said, haughtily, and&#xD;
drew back as he came forward with the mani-&#xD;
fest intention of assisting her into the car-&#xD;
riage.&#xD;
"I have been admiring your horses, Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley," said St. John, smiling. "They do&#xD;
credit to your taste. Will you allow me?"&#xD;
On second thoughts, she allowed him to put&#xD;
her into the carriage; and, when she was seated,&#xD;
looked up and spoke.&#xD;
"If you will take my advice, you will con-&#xD;
sider what I said to you a short time ago. It&#xD;
might be worth your while. I need not tell you&#xD;
where you will find me if you desire to communi-&#xD;
cate with me."&#xD;
He bowed-making no other answer to the&#xD;
covert sneer in her last words-and, as he&#xD;
stepped from the door, the carriage drove off.&#xD;
When it was out of sight, he turned, and,&#xD;
opening the gate, walked up to the house. Mrs.&#xD;
Marks had accompanied Mrs. Annesley to the&#xD;
front piazza, and was still standing there when&#xD;
he approached. In the first sound of her voice,&#xD;
in the first word which she spo3~c, he saw that a&#xD;
change had come over her-that she had been&#xD;
placed on guard against him. She answered his&#xD;
questions courteously; but there was none of&#xD;
the hearty cordiality of the morning in her man-&#xD;
ner, and she did not ask him to enter the house.&#xD;
After finding that her ignorance about Katharine&#xD;
was quite as complete as it had been represented,&#xD;
he had no alternative but to take his leave. Be-&#xD;
fore doing so, however, he received a piece of&#xD;
information which startled him a little. He&#xD;
thought that it might be as well to verify onin-&#xD;
disputable evidence the facts which the servants&#xD;
had given him, and so he said, carelessly:&#xD;
"Will you allow me to inquire if the Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley who has just left is related to the&#xD;
young gentleman of the same name whom I saw&#xD;
~iere a few hours ago?"&#xD;
"She is his mother," answered Mrs. Marks-&#xD;
&#xD;
adding, involuntarily, "and the cousin of Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon."&#xD;
"Indeed l" said St. John, starting quickly.&#xD;
After this, he asked no more questions, but&#xD;
made his apologies, and took his leave almost&#xD;
immediately. As he walked down the street,&#xD;
the few people who met him and looked curious-&#xD;
ly at him, saw that he was deeply absorbed in&#xD;
thought. In fact, he was revolving what he had&#xD;
just heard, and considering what it meant.&#xD;
"Mrs. Gordon's cousin," he repeated to him-&#xD;
self. "What the deuce is the meaning of it all!&#xD;
Shall I never get to the end of all the strings and&#xD;
counter-strings which seem to be pulling these&#xD;
people to and fro?"&#xD;
-4--&#xD;
ChAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
TIlE sicn LADL&#xD;
Two weeks after Miss Tresham had taken&#xD;
her departure from Tallahoma, a carriage, con-&#xD;
taining a solitary traveller, drove into the town&#xD;
of Hnrtsburg-a place of considerable import-&#xD;
ance, situated some thirty miles southwest of&#xD;
Sasford.&#xD;
"The Planters' Hotel, Cyrus," said the trav-&#xD;
eller, as the carriage turned into the Main Street;&#xD;
"or, no-I was cheated shamefully there as we&#xD;
went on-the Eagle Hotel, I believe."&#xD;
"Whar that beMass John? ~&#xD;
"Twosquares below the other house, on the&#xD;
corner of the street."&#xD;
Two squares below the other house the car~&#xD;
ringe proceeded, and stopped before a large,&#xD;
rambling frame building, two stories high, with&#xD;
a double piazza running the whole length of the&#xD;
front. An uninviting hostelry, people would&#xD;
think nowadays, with ideas of brick and stucco&#xD;
in their minds; but in that day the standard of&#xD;
comfort for the unfortunate travelling public&#xD;
was by no means a high one, and, as houses of&#xD;
entertainment went, the Eagle Hotel was by no&#xD;
means to be despised. A " tavern" look about&#xD;
it, unmistakably; a "tavern" odor, very cer-&#xD;
tainly; but still-well, there were worse places&#xD;
(probably the traveller had spent the night be-&#xD;
fore at one of them), and in that thought was&#xD;
comfort.&#xD;
When the carriage stopped, a man came for-&#xD;
ward from the group of smokers and loungers&#xD;
congregated, according to invariable custom, on&#xD;
the front piazza, and reached the door just as it&#xD;
was opened and the traveller stepped out.&#xD;
&#xD;
K LADY.                                153&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Crump, how are you?" said the&#xD;
latter, with a smile.&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Warwick I how do you do, sir?&#xD;
exclaimed Mr. Crump, extending his hand. "I&#xD;
had no idea it was you You don't usually&#xD;
travel in this sort of conveyance. Walk in,&#xD;
air-walk in. Come down to court, I sup-&#xD;
pose?"&#xD;
"No; I have been below, and am on my way&#xD;
back to Tallahoma. Is it court-week?"&#xD;
"To be sure, sir, and the house full of law.&#xD;
yers. I never saw a larger crowd."&#xD;
"Perhaps you can't accommodate me, then?"&#xD;
"Never fear about that, sir. The old woman&#xD;
will find you a room, if she has to turn the judge&#xD;
himself out.-Drive the carriage round' to the&#xD;
stables, boy, and see the hostler about a place&#xD;
for your horses.-Now, Mr. Warwick "&#xD;
He turned, but Mr. Warwick was already&#xD;
surrounded by half a dozen men-gentlemen of&#xD;
the legal fraternity-who were shaking hands,&#xD;
and cordially welcoming him. They were all&#xD;
glad to see him; all seemed astonished when&#xD;
'they heard that he had not "come to court;"&#xD;
and all inquired if it was possible he had no&#xD;
cases on the docket. While he was answering&#xD;
their questions, az~d endeavoring to make them&#xD;
understand that it was merely by accident he&#xD;
chanced to be in Hartaburg, Mr. Grump seized&#xD;
his portmantcau, and, carrying it into the house,&#xD;
called vociferously for "the old woman." Thin&#xD;
personage not being forthcoming, half a dozen&#xD;
servants appeared from as many different quar~&#xD;
ters, and to one of them Mr. Crump addressed&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
"Sam, take this valise up-stairs, and ask&#xD;
your mistress where it's to go. Tell bent's&#xD;
Mr. Warwick's, from Tallaloxna.-Where the&#xD;
dickens is she? Don't any of you know?"&#xD;
"She's in the sick lady's room, sir," said a&#xD;
tall negro-woman, who came down-stairs as he&#xD;
spoke. "She says as how she'll be here in a&#xD;
minute."&#xD;
"Deuce take the sick lady-pshaw I I don't&#xD;
mean that either; but it seems to me Selina's&#xD;
never anywhere else these days. flow is she,&#xD;
anyhow ?-the lady, I mean."&#xD;
The woman shook her head with that doleful&#xD;
solemnity which a negro finds real and sensible&#xD;
pleasure in indulging.&#xD;
"Miss S'lina thinks she's some better, sir,"&#xD;
she said, and, with this significant mode of en.&#xD;
pressing her own opinion, vanished.&#xD;
Mr. Crump gave a low whistle, expressive,&#xD;
apparently, of his own view on the subject, rn~d,'&#xD;
&#xD;

THE SICK LADY.                       155&#xD;
&#xD;
154                       MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
turning, was about to go out of the door, when&#xD;
he met Mr. Warwick coming in.&#xD;
"Well," said the lawyer, smiling, "how is&#xD;
it? Can Mrs. Cmmp find a corner for me? I&#xD;
shall only trouble her for one night."&#xD;
"I don't doubt that she'll find room for you,&#xD;
sir; l~ut I haven't seen her yet. She's busy with&#xD;
a sick boarder, who's been giving us no end of&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
"Indeed! lint Mrs. Crump don't mind trou-&#xD;
ble, I know."&#xD;
Mr. Crump muttered something in reply&#xD;
abont "court.week," and "the house being&#xD;
full,'~ from which it was to be supposed that&#xD;
he thought it would be better for him if his wife&#xD;
did mind trouble a little more. He 'evidently&#xD;
felt injured; butbefore he had time for further&#xD;
expression of his sentiments, a stout, pleasant-&#xD;
faced woman of about fifty came downstairs and&#xD;
advanced toward them. She greeted the lawyer&#xD;
in~ rather a preoccupied manner, and then, in-&#xD;
*    stead of saying any thing about his room, turned&#xD;
to her husband.&#xD;
~ have to send for the doctor again,&#xD;
Tom. Thought, a little while ago, that she was&#xD;
better; but I don't like the way her fever's&#xD;
*     rising now, and I'm afraid she's going to be&#xD;
light-headed again."&#xD;
"But, Selina, here's Mr. Warwick wants a&#xD;
room, and-'&#xD;
"I'll see about Mr. Warwick presently," said&#xD;
Selina, looking at him with a pair of kindly yet&#xD;
somewhat anxious eyes. "That poor child up.&#xD;
stairs stays on my mind; and, do what I will, V&#xD;
can't get her off of it. Go along, Tom, and send&#xD;
for the doctor, as I told you.-Mr. Warwick, you&#xD;
don't mind my being a little put outlam sure. ~&#xD;
If you'll come with me, I'll try and' find you a&#xD;
room. Somehow .1 had an idea you'd be here&#xD;
this week, and' I saved you one right along~&#xD;
side of the judge's. I'll go and look in to see&#xD;
that all's right."&#xD;
She led the way up-stairs, and Mr. Warwick,&#xD;
as in duty bound, had nothing but thanks for the&#xD;
room late which she showed him-it being very&#xD;
comfortable, according to the ideas of comfort&#xD;
existing at that time. While she still lingered,&#xD;
~oiiehing a chair l~ere, and arranging a curtain&#xD;
there, he taade the 'ordinary inquiries concerning&#xD;
her health aud domestic afibirs; and, after these&#xD;
IVOre answered, she, of her own accord, led the&#xD;
conv~ers&amp;amp;tion back to her sick boarder.&#xD;
"A poor young thing that don't seem to have&#xD;
any friends, and-though I wouldn't tell Tom so&#xD;
...4'll venture to say, not over-much money,"&#xD;
&#xD;
she said. "She come here in the stage one night,&#xD;
and meant to go on next morning; but, Lord&#xD;
bless you! she was took down with a fever, and,&#xD;
though that was more'n a week ago, she hasn't&#xD;
lifted up her head since. I've tried to get her to&#xD;
tell me who her friends are, so ihat I can write&#xD;
to 'em; but she won't. She says she ain't got&#xD;
any, which, you know, sir, would look badly, if&#xD;
she wasn't such a real lady."&#xD;
"She is a lady-is she?" asked Mr. War-&#xD;
wick, carelessly. The sick woman was to him a&#xD;
matter of infinitely less importance than some&#xD;
fresh water and some hot coffee.&#xD;
"A real lady, sir, as ever 1 saw-no half-way&#xD;
trash, I can tell you. That's the pity of it, and&#xD;
that's what makes me so anxious to find out&#xD;
who she is, and where she belongs. I'm as sure&#xD;
she's run away from home as I can be; and, if a&#xD;
man is not somehow or other at the bottom of&#xD;
it, my name isn't Selina Crump. I only wish&#xD;
he'd dare to come here, and set his foot inside&#xD;
the Eagle Hotel!"&#xD;
"What would you do to him if he did?"&#xD;
asked Mr. Warwick, who, despite his weariness&#xD;
and impatience, was amused by the tone in&#xD;
which the landlady's last words were uttered.&#xD;
"What would I do? I'd scald him-that's&#xD;
what I'd do! I'd put on a kettle of water spe-&#xD;
cially for him, if' I only knowed when he was&#xD;
coming; and I'd show him how he come into a&#xD;
honest house, after tickingg off a pretty girl like&#xD;
that, and then leaving her to die, or to get well&#xD;
as best she could 1"&#xD;
"But why are you so sure that a man's at&#xD;
the bottom of it?"&#xD;
In reply to this, Mrs. Crump became some-&#xD;
what mysterious and reticent; but it finally ap-&#xD;
peared that the lady had been delirious, and,&#xD;
when in that state, had talked a great deal of&#xD;
nonsense, especially about a somebody named&#xD;
"John."&#xD;
"She always thinks he's after her," said the&#xD;
landlady, solemnly, "and she's always trying to&#xD;
get away from him."&#xD;
"Probably he is her husband," said the law-&#xD;
yer, basing his remark upon an extended knowl-&#xD;
edge of human nature in the marital relation.&#xD;
Mrs. Crump obstinately shook her head and&#xD;
obstinately held her ground-blind to the long-&#xD;
ing glance which Mr. Warwick, with the dust&#xD;
of a day's journey upon him, directed to the&#xD;
wash-stand.&#xD;
"There's something about a married woman&#xD;
a body can almost always tell," she said. "I'm&#xD;
as sure as can be that this girl ein't married.&#xD;
&#xD;
F'raps she's run away to do it; but that's a&#xD;
different matter, and all the more I'd like to&#xD;
send her back to her friends." A pause; then,&#xD;
in an insinuating tone, "I thought you might&#xD;
help me to find out something' about her, Mr.&#xD;
Warwick, knowing so many people as you do~&#xD;
I haven't said a word to anybody else, because&#xD;
she's such a lady that somehow I didn't like to&#xD;
do it. But Tom is mighty snappish about her,&#xD;
and, if I could only find out who she is, it might&#xD;
make him hold his tongue."&#xD;
"I do know a good many people," said Mr.&#xD;
Warwick, patiently; "but it is quite impossible&#xD;
for me to tell whether I know the relations or&#xD;
friends of this sick lady among them. Pray,&#xD;
what is her name?"&#xD;
"She wrote it down when she came, and Tom&#xD;
put it on the register; but my head's dreadful&#xD;
for remembering such things, and I couldn't&#xD;
tell it to you now, if my life depended on it. I&#xD;
saw a book lying on the table with her name&#xD;
written in it, though, and I'll go and get that for&#xD;
you."&#xD;
Without waiting for an answer, she left the&#xD;
room, and, with another regretful glance at the&#xD;
wash-stand, Mr. Warwick walked to the window,&#xD;
to await her return. At that moment the prin-&#xD;
cipal thought in his mind was a wish that he&#xD;
had gone to the Planters' Hotel. lie began to&#xD;
wonder if there were any "sick ladies" ~A~ere,&#xD;
to be thrust remorselessly upon the attention of&#xD;
travellers, and defer indefinitely those ablutions&#xD;
of which tired nature (when just off a journey)&#xD;
first and foremost stands in need. "Mrs. Crump&#xD;
ought to know better," he said to himself, a little~&#xD;
indignantly; and, as he said it, the door opened,&#xD;
and Mrs. Crutup reappeared with a small, black,&#xD;
much-worn book in her hand.&#xD;
"When she was herself she mostly had it&#xD;
on the bed by her," said the good woman; "but&#xD;
to-day she's been light-headed, and sb I put it on&#xD;
the table, and in that way I got it without dis-&#xD;
turbing her. Here it is, Mr. Warwick, and the&#xD;
name's in it."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick took the volume, and, as he&#xD;
did so, he could not repress a start, or account&#xD;
for a sudden chill instinct, that seemed to rush&#xD;
over him. The book was a pocket-edition of&#xD;
Thomas ~ Kempis's "Following of Christ," and&#xD;
at once struck him as strangely similar to one&#xD;
that he had often seen in Katharine Tresham's I&#xD;
hand, It was her familiar companion, and, as&#xD;
such, familiar to him also. Just now he could&#xD;
have sw~rn that this was the very book-he knew&#xD;
the very look of the worn edges, th~ embossed&#xD;
&#xD;
cross in the middle of the back, and the smaller&#xD;
crosses at each corner. "I am a fool 1" he&#xD;
thought, and opened it at once, at the fly-leaf.&#xD;
There, traced in faded ink, he read, "To Katha-&#xD;
rine Treshani, from her aunt, Mary Tresham,"&#xD;
and a date fourteen years before I&#xD;
To say that Mrs. Crump was startled by the&#xD;
face that turned round upon her, would be to&#xD;
describe her sensations very inadequately-for&#xD;
she was in fact astounded. She fell back a&#xD;
little, and grasped the bedpost in a state of&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
"Goodness alive, Mr. Warwick!" she cried;&#xD;
"what's the matter?"&#xD;
"Is that the name which the lady gave&#xD;
you?" asked Mr. Warwick, following her, and&#xD;
pointing to the writing on the fly-leaf-" is that&#xD;
the name?"&#xD;
"Why, to be sure that's the name. I-I&#xD;
told you it was in the book." Then gaining&#xD;
courage-" Is any thing wrong about her, Mr.&#xD;
Warwick? Oh, mc! what will Tom say?"&#xD;
"Wrong!"repeated Mr. Warwickin a tone&#xD;
that made her start back again. Then he&#xD;
stopped and recollected himself. "You have&#xD;
acted quite properly, Mrs. Crump," he said~&#xD;
quietly, "and your decision in this matter shows&#xD;
you to be a woman of good judgment, as well as&#xD;
of kind heart. This is a lady-" he emphasized,&#xD;
the word-" whom I left at my sister's house,&#xD;
in Tallahoma, and whom I am naturally sur~&#xD;
praised to find here. I know her wcll~ and can&#xD;
vouch for her in every particular. Will you sit&#xD;
down and tell me how she came here, and every&#xD;
thing that you know about her?"&#xD;
Mrs. Crump willingly obeyed; but out of her&#xD;
verbose narrative Mr. Warwick gathered very&#xD;
little more than he had heard already. On&#xD;
Wednesday, a week before (this was Thursday),&#xD;
Miss Tresham had arrived in Hartsburg, and&#xD;
stopped at the Eagle Hotel for the night, de-&#xD;
claring her intention of continuing her jour-&#xD;
ney (destination unknown), the next morning.&#xD;
As the landlady learned afterward, she had a&#xD;
burning fever all night, and, when morning&#xD;
came, was not able to leave her bed. Since&#xD;
then, she had steadily grown worse, and lay in&#xD;
titernate stupor and delirium most of the time.&#xD;
When questioned about medical attendance,&#xD;
~!rs. Crump answered, hesitatingly. The doctor&#xD;
iad not come very often-perhaps because&#xD;
thought it extremely doubtful whether he&#xD;
~ver be paid for coming at all-and hail 'net&#xD;
~poken by any means encouragingly. "I 4pi't~&#xD;
hink he's got much idea that she'll live,"'s~i4&#xD;
&#xD;

156                      MORTON HOUSE.                                                          THE SICK LADY.                     157&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Crump. "He told me I'd better try my&#xD;
best to find out about her friends."&#xD;
"Who is the doctor-Randolph?"&#xD;
"No, sir- anew doctor-Joyner is his name&#xD;
-who, I thought, might pay more attention,&#xD;
because he hasn't got any practice to speak&#xD;
of."&#xD;
dS ~ should like to see him when he comes,&#xD;
and, meanwhile, I wish you would send a mes-&#xD;
senger for Dr. Randolph. I-" He stopped a&#xD;
moment, as there came a knock at the door.&#xD;
"Who is that?"&#xD;
"It's me, sir," responded an unmistakably&#xD;
African voice. "Mass Tom sent me to see if&#xD;
Miss S'lina's up here.'~&#xD;
"What dbes he want?" asked Mrs. Crump,&#xD;
going forward and opening the door.&#xD;
"He say the doctor's come, ma'am, and Mom&#xD;
H&amp;amp;nnah's done took him in the sick lady's&#xD;
room.~~&#xD;
"You had better go at once," said Mr. War-&#xD;
wick, as she turned and looked at him. "Bc&#xD;
sure and send the doctor to me before he leaves.&#xD;
I will wait for him here."&#xD;
After she left, he sat quite still-totally for-&#xD;
getful of the dust now-trying to realize, and, if&#xD;
possible, to account for this singular freak of cir-&#xD;
cumstance. But the more he thought, the more&#xD;
absolutely puzzled he became-the more difficult&#xD;
It was to believe that the woman of whom Mrs.&#xD;
Orump spoke, the woman who lay thus, sick and&#xD;
helpless at the mercy of strangers, . was the&#xD;
Katharine Tresham whom he fancied safe in&#xD;
his sister's home, the Katharine Tresham whom&#xD;
he had' seen last in her white ball-dress, with the&#xD;
blue flowers in her soft, brown hair! "There&#xD;
wust be some mistake!" he said, hale aloud.&#xD;
"It cannot be 1" But, as he uttered the words,&#xD;
he looked at the little book still in his hand, and&#xD;
it seemed to answer, "It is so!" But how did&#xD;
she come here so strangely! friendless and&#xD;
alone? It was vain to ask himself that ques-&#xD;
tion-vain to torment himself with fruitless con-&#xD;
jectures. Of course; he thought of St. John, of&#xD;
Mr~.6 Gordon, of his~ sister, of Annesley, of the&#xD;
money drawn at the bank, and Mr. Marks's com-&#xD;
ment upon it-but all these people and things&#xD;
were hopelessly confused in his mind. He could&#xD;
Dot even frame out of them a conjecture plausi-&#xD;
ble enough to satisfy himself. One random&#xD;
thought succeeded another, until at last, to&#xD;
escape from thi~m, he rose and started to leave&#xD;
the room. "I'll meet the doctor," he said.&#xD;
This intention was frustrated, however, for the&#xD;
doctor was at the door.&#xD;
/                   "p&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick?" said be, interrogatively.&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Warwick. "Dr. Joyner, I&#xD;
presume 1' Walk in, sir. I wish to speak to&#xD;
you.&#xD;
Dr Joyner bowed and walked in. He had&#xD;
on his professional face and his professional&#xD;
manner. Having said this, it is useless to say&#xD;
how he looked in the matter of expression, for&#xD;
all doctors look alike under these circumstances.&#xD;
The drill of a soldier is not more exactly marked&#xD;
than this professional mask, which is so widely&#xD;
prevalent that an inquiring observer is some-&#xD;
times driven to wonder if the novices of medi-&#xD;
cine are taught deportment as well as science.&#xD;
In the way of personal appearance, Dr. Joyner&#xD;
was a man who might have been twenty-five by&#xD;
his figure, and forty-five by his face. The anom-&#xD;
aly of youth and age is not often seen united&#xD;
in the same person; but, when it is, it strikes&#xD;
us unpleasantly-we can scarcely tell why. It&#xD;
struck Mr. Warwick unpleasantly as soon as the&#xD;
physician entered the room, and yet he could not&#xD;
possibly have given his reasons for th~ feeling.&#xD;
Dr. Joyner sat down, and opened the conversa-&#xD;
tion himself.&#xD;
"I was referred to you by Mrs. Crump, sir.&#xD;
I understand that you are a friend of the lady I&#xD;
have just seen."&#xD;
"Yes," answered Mr. Warwick, "I sm a&#xD;
friend of hers, and, in the absence of other&#xD;
friendslam anxious to hear an exact account&#xD;
of her case. Will you be good enough to give&#xD;
it me?"&#xD;
This direct question seemed to embarrass the&#xD;
doctor a little. Tie had uncertain sort of eyes,&#xD;
that were given to shifting their gaze. They&#xD;
shifted it immediately, and, instead of looking&#xD;
at the lawyer's face, gazed out of the win-&#xD;
dow&#xD;
"The lady's ease is a peculiar one," he said.&#xD;
"I am by no means sure that the illness under&#xD;
which she is laboring has developed itself suf-&#xD;
ficiently for me to give it a specific name."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick looked astonished. "What!"&#xD;
he said. "She baa been ill for a week, the land-&#xD;
lady tells me, and you are not yet able to give.&#xD;
her disease a specific name!',&#xD;
"The symptoms have developed themselves&#xD;
slowly," answered the doctor, stiffly. "I have&#xD;
treated her, in a general way, for fever produced&#xD;
by cold and excitement; but to-day I begin to&#xD;
think that the brain is becoming involved. If&#xD;
so-" Re stopped and hesitated.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick turned a little pale, but took&#xD;
up his sentence quietly:&#xD;
&#xD;
"If so, you think her life in danger?"&#xD;
"Well, I don't go so far as that; but I thinl&#xD;
her illness may be very serious.&#xD;
There was a pause. The doctor's eyes shifts'&#xD;
from the window to the mantel-piece, and thenci&#xD;
travelled back to his questioner's face. Thel&#xD;
rested there in keen and undisturbed serutinl&#xD;
for several minutes, Mr. Wtirwick being deep iz&#xD;
thought, with his brows slightly knitted, and hi~&#xD;
own gaze fastened on the floor. Without looking~&#xD;
up, he said, slowly:&#xD;
If I only knew what to do!"&#xD;
I would advise you to write to the lady':&#xD;
friends, if you know them, sir," said the doctor,&#xD;
quietly.&#xD;
The other started, and glanced up.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon. I was thinking aloud.&#xD;
Can I see your patient?"&#xD;
"You can see her, certainly."&#xD;
"Will it not be dangerous? will it not excite&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
"It cannot possibly excite 11cr, for she knows&#xD;
nobody."&#xD;
"She could not answer a single question,&#xD;
then?" -&#xD;
"Not when I left her, ten minutes ago."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick resumed his scrutiny of the car-&#xD;
pet, and Dr. Joyner resumed his scrutiny of Mr.&#xD;
Warwick. In this way another minute passed.&#xD;
Then the lawyer rose.&#xD;
"Will you come with me to her room?" he&#xD;
said. - "Since I am her only friend within reach,&#xD;
I must see her, and judge for myself of her con-&#xD;
dition."&#xD;
"I am at y'oar service," said the other, rising~&#xD;
in turn.&#xD;
They left the room, and walked down the&#xD;
passage together, making one or two sharp turns&#xD;
around. sharp corners-for the, house was built&#xD;
with a daring disregard of any plan or order&#xD;
whatever-and finally pausing before a door, at&#xD;
which the doctor tapped lightly. A negro-woman&#xD;
-the same who had spoken to Mn Crump in the&#xD;
passage below-opened it, and, seeing the doctor,&#xD;
made way for them to enter.&#xD;
A queer little room, with a fireplace in the&#xD;
corner, and dark-green walls, that contrasted&#xD;
strongly with clean white curtains, was what&#xD;
the lawyer saw. The furniture was plain and&#xD;
scanty, but .there was not space for much; and&#xD;
the bed, which occupied the most prominent&#xD;
place, was neatly draped in spotless coverings.&#xD;
The best that the house aWorded was plainly&#xD;
here, a~d it was evident that Katharine had&#xD;
suft'crod from no neglect at the hands of her&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
entertainers. Without saying a word, the doctor&#xD;
~ led the way to the bed, and Mr. Warwick fol-&#xD;
lowed him. Standing side by side, they looked&#xD;
I down on the sick girl.&#xD;
She had fallen into a light slumber, and lay&#xD;
with her head thrown back over the pillows,&#xD;
showing the white arch of her throat, aid its&#xD;
large arteries, beating with a rush that it was&#xD;
painful to watch. Her cheeks were deeply&#xD;
flushed; her hair fell in tangled masses all&#xD;
about her face; and her lips were bright scar-&#xD;
let. She made a lovely picture, seen in the&#xD;
half-darkened room, with the white draperies&#xD;
of the bed surrounding her; hut it was a pic-&#xD;
ture lovely with that awful glow of fever which&#xD;
hushes our breath even when we see it in a&#xD;
stranger. The most inexperienced person look-&#xD;
ing on could hardly have failed to perceive that,&#xD;
if life and death were not already wrestling&#xD;
here, the hour of their struggle iyas not far dis-&#xD;
tant, and the issue more than doubtful. One&#xD;
hand was thrown, as if in fevered restlessness,&#xD;
outside the counterpane. Mr. Warwick stooped&#xD;
down and laid his finger lightly on the wrist.&#xD;
Almost immediately he lifted his face, and looked&#xD;
at the doctor.&#xD;
"Feel her pulse," he 'said. "I may be inex-&#xD;
perienced; but it seems to me that it is going at&#xD;
a fearful rate. I cannot count it."&#xD;
Even in the dim light, it was evident to his&#xD;
keen eyes that the doctor changed color. He&#xD;
drew out his watch, and, taking the wrist, began&#xD;
counting the pulse, speaking after a while with-&#xD;
out lifting his eyes.&#xD;
"Her fever i.~ rising. I was afraid it would.&#xD;
She seemed so much lowered in strength yester-&#xD;
day that I ordered stimulants, and I think they&#xD;
have been pressed too far. She was delirious&#xD;
when I was here a while ago~~&#xD;
"She seems to he sleeping now."&#xD;
"Speak to her, and see if you can rouse&#xD;
her."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick spoke. His words roused' her,&#xD;
for she opened her eyes at once; but there was&#xD;
no consciousness in their gaze. They looked at&#xD;
him blankly, and, when he spoke again, she an-&#xD;
swered in the aimless wanderings of delirium-&#xD;
few words-words without any gleam of reason&#xD;
-.--accompanicd by a wild and painful glare of&#xD;
the eye, so foreign to its usual soft expreseldn&#xD;
that it absolutely destroyed her resemblance to&#xD;
herself, and made Mr. Warwick almost question&#xD;
if this were indeed Katharine Tresham. After a&#xD;
minute spcnt~ in closh and attentive observatinn,&#xD;
he walked to the door, and beckoned the dbefor&#xD;

158                         MORTON HOUSE.                                                                  THI3I SICK LADY.                       159&#xD;
&#xD;
to follow him. Once outside, he stopped and&#xD;
turned, thus facing the other.&#xD;
"I find that the ease is much more serious&#xD;
than I could possibly have imagined," he said.&#xD;
"L fear that there has been some neglect."&#xD;
"It was quite impossible for me to nurse&#xD;
the 'patient as well as prescribe for her," an.&#xD;
swerved the doctor, coldly. "All that I could do&#xD;
1 have done."&#xD;
"Then I suppose you will not object to niy&#xD;
calling in another physh4an? I have sent for&#xD;
Dr. Randolph."&#xD;
He said this in a matter-of.course tone; but&#xD;
he was not unprepared for what followed. His&#xD;
distrust of the doctor-increasing continually&#xD;
ever since the doctor entered his room-made&#xD;
him expect very much the reply that came. The&#xD;
* man flushed deeply, and drew back with a stiff&#xD;
little bow.&#xD;
"In that event, I beg leave to withdraw from&#xD;
the case. I decline to go into consultation with&#xD;
Dr. Randolph."&#xD;
"se good enough, then, to make out your&#xD;
bill and send it to me," said Mr. Warwick.&#xD;
"Good-evening."&#xD;
He left the man standing at the head of the&#xD;
stairs, and went down, smiling a little to himself.&#xD;
"it did not cost much trouble," he saidhalf&#xD;
aloud, as he looked round in search of Mr.&#xD;
Crump. That worthy was easily found, and&#xD;
matters were soon placed on a satisfactory foot-&#xD;
ing. Mr, Warwick had very vague ideas on the&#xD;
uubjeet of sick-nursing; but he knew that unre-&#xD;
mitting attention was an item of the first impor-&#xD;
tance, pud he provided for this by engaging the&#xD;
services of two women, who were to relieve each&#xD;
other on duty.&#xD;
"Hannah's up-stairs now," said Mr. Crump,&#xD;
"and Elsie'll be on hand when she's wanted. Is&#xD;
there any thing else, Mr. Warwick?"&#xD;
"I asked Mrs. Crump to send for Dr. Ran-&#xD;
dolph. Do you know whether sl~e did so?"&#xD;
*   Before Mr. Crump could reply, a heavy step&#xD;
sounded in the passage outside the room in&#xD;
wbiql~ they were standing, and a round, Cull&#xD;
voice was heard asking, "Which room?"&#xD;
"There's the doctor now," said Mr. Crnmp-&#xD;
"This way, doctor I Herc'~ Mr. Warwick."&#xD;
"This way-is it?" responded the same&#xD;
jovial voice; and the next instant a tall, stout&#xD;
man, with a frank, pleasant face, a~id an eye of&#xD;
that peculiar color which can only be called&#xD;
"laughing hazel," entered the apartment, lightly&#xD;
swinging a stick, formidable enough to have been&#xD;
an Irishman's shillalab.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, doctor, how are you?" said Mr. War.&#xD;
wick, meeting him with extended hand.&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick, I am delighted to see you,&#xD;
and to see you looking so well," said the doctor,&#xD;
giving the hand a cordial shake. "I was afraid,&#xD;
from the urgency of the message, that I should&#xD;
find you seriously ill. You haven't much the&#xD;
look of a sick man," he added, laughing. "What&#xD;
is the matter ?-broken down from over-work?&#xD;
I've prophesied that, you know."&#xD;
"Your prophecy is not verified y~t, at any&#xD;
rate. But you are mistaken; I am not the pa-&#xD;
tient for whom you were summoned. There&#xD;
is a lady here under my care" (Mr. Crurap&#xD;
opened h~s eyes to their fullest extent), "who&#xD;
is, I fear, dangerously ill. I want you to see&#xD;
"What is the matter with her?"&#xD;
"That is what I want you to tell mc. I am&#xD;
afraid, however, that she has brain-fever."&#xD;
"When was she taken ~"&#xD;
"A week ago."&#xD;
"A week ago-ke7eV'&#xD;
"Yes-here."&#xD;
"And who has been attending her?"&#xD;
"A doctor of whom I know nothing but&#xD;
that his name is Joyner."&#xD;
At the sound of that name, Dr. Randolph&#xD;
dropped his eyes, which had been fastened on&#xD;
the speaker's face, looked in the fire, and said.&#xD;
"Humph 1" in a significant manner, that was&#xD;
not lost on Mr. Warwick. He at once hastened&#xD;
to explain.&#xD;
"Don't think thatlcalledhimindoctor.&#xD;
Miss Tresham came here a week ago, as I tell&#xD;
you, and was taken ill. Mrs. Crump called in&#xD;
Dr. Joyner. I arrived an hour ago, and I have&#xD;
already dismissed him. With little or no knowl-&#xD;
edge of medicine, I am still able to perceive that&#xD;
he has been grossly mistreating the case. What&#xD;
I ask of you now is to see if you can repair the&#xD;
mischief he has done."&#xD;
"That may be harder than you think," said&#xD;
the doctor, gravely. "A week-however, I will&#xD;
reserve my opinion till I see the patient; and&#xD;
that I will do immediately, if you please."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick led the way to Miss Tresham's&#xD;
room, and just i~ the door they met Mr#. Crump&#xD;
coming out, '.~u&#xD;
"Oh, d~q~r, I~n glad to see you I" she~ said&#xD;
to the do~%~t1', ~ She is clean gcneo~t of her&#xD;
head, and tks~ boyd knowp I haven't am idea what&#xD;
to do w~thls~g ~&#xD;
The .d~ct~r did not utter ~ ~ passed&#xD;
her hastily'and entered the ehambev2 ~ne step&#xD;
&#xD;
took him to the bed, where, with flaming cheeks,&#xD;
and eyes bright with the awful glare of fever,&#xD;
Katharine lay tossing and raving wildly. He&#xD;
gave a single glance, then turned and drew back&#xD;
the curtain from a window near him. It chanced&#xD;
to be toward the west, and the rays of the set-&#xD;
ting sun streamed with a flood of golden glory&#xD;
into the little room, filling it with an almost daz-&#xD;
zling radiance. The sudden rush of llght almost&#xD;
blinded the others; but the doctor bent over the&#xD;
bed, felt the pulse that bounded beneath his&#xD;
touch, and gazed intently into the eyes that met&#xD;
his own.&#xD;
When he raised his face, Mr. Warwick was&#xD;
startled by the gravity of his brow and lip.&#xD;
"Bring a basin here," he said to the servant.&#xD;
To Mrs. Crump, "Bare her arm." He drew a&#xD;
small case froth his pocket. The next moment,&#xD;
there was the gleam of a lancet, a sharp stroke&#xD;
into the soft, white flesh, and a stream of dark-&#xD;
red blood pouring into the basin.&#xD;
"Bandages," he said to Mrs. Crump, who&#xD;
was standing by. While she was gone for them,&#xD;
he turned to Mr. Warwick, and added, "Brain.&#xD;
fever of the most violent type. This is the only&#xD;
hope of saving her life."&#xD;
"It is brain-fever, then?"&#xD;
"Beyond doubt. If I had only seen her a&#xD;
day earlier!"&#xD;
"Thank God it is not a day later!" said the&#xD;
lawyer, under his breath.&#xD;
There was no time for any thing more.&#xD;
Mrs. Crump returned, and the doctor imme-&#xD;
diately devoted his whole energy to his patient.&#xD;
In the face of all remonstrances and entreaties&#xD;
to the contrary (Mrs. Crump and Mom Hannah&#xD;
freely treated him to beth), he bled her until in-&#xD;
sensibility took the place of violent raving. Then,&#xD;
and then only, he stopped the flow of the blood,&#xD;
and bound up her arm. After this, he called for&#xD;
a pair of scissors and for ice. With the first,&#xD;
he remorselessly cut from her head the rich,&#xD;
brown locks that had crowned it like a glory,&#xD;
and, when they lay scattered over the bed, he&#xD;
saturated a towel with water, filled it with ice,&#xD;
end bound it around the burning temples.&#xD;
"There!" he said, speaking for the first&#xD;
time, pfter this was done. "Remember, Han-&#xD;
nah, this is your business- to keep a supply&#xD;
of towels and ice at hand, and change them&#xD;
whenever the chill has worn off. With the fever,&#xD;
that won't he long.-Mrs. Crump, I suppose 'you&#xD;
have no time to spare-"&#xD;
Indeed, doctor, I shall take the time," in-&#xD;
terrupted Mrs. Crump, hastily. "Just tell me&#xD;
&#xD;
what you want done, and P11 engage to do it, no&#xD;
matter what else goes undone."&#xD;
"Just at present there is nothing to do, ex-&#xD;
cept to send for some leeches, and try and keep&#xD;
things as quiet as possible. Could you give&#xD;
those gentlemen down-stairs a hint that there is&#xD;
a case of brain-fever in the house, and that a lit-&#xD;
tle less noise would be desirable?"&#xD;
"I'll give 'em something more'n a hint,"&#xD;
answered Mrs. Crump, decidedly-and left the&#xD;
room, to send for the leeches, and command the&#xD;
peace.&#xD;
"A word with you, Mr. Warwick," said the&#xD;
doctor, walking away to the farthest window.&#xD;
"I think it right to tell you," he went on, as&#xD;
Mr. Warwick followed him, "that this attack Is&#xD;
a very dangerous one, and, from present appear-&#xD;
ance, the chances arc that it will prove fatal in&#xD;
its result. If the young lady has any friends,&#xD;
they ought to be communicated with at once."&#xD;
lIe paused as if for a reply; but Mr. War.&#xD;
wick did not speak. Situated as he was-in&#xD;
utter ignorance how or why Katharine had left&#xD;
his sister's house-it was impossible for him not&#xD;
to hesitate when thus summarily brought to the&#xD;
point of positive action. He did hesitate-he&#xD;
ran over in his mind the unsatisfactory condi-&#xD;
tion of affairs when he left home, and the unsat-&#xD;
isfactory conjectures that had beset him an hour&#xD;
ago, without arriving at any result. Finally, he&#xD;
looked at the doctor, and made a simple state-&#xD;
ment of facts.&#xD;
"In few words, doctor, I don't like to do&#xD;
this without Miss Tresham's sanction," he said.&#xD;
"She is a foreigner, with no relations in Amer-&#xD;
ica, and as for her friends-.--I can only account&#xD;
for her presence here by supposing that some&#xD;
estrangement has occurred to separate her from&#xD;
those who' might be called her friends. Under&#xD;
these circumstances, I do not think that n$~ in-&#xD;
terference could do any good-certainly not by&#xD;
means of letters."&#xD;
"But when her life is in danger?"&#xD;
"That statement would, of course, be suf-&#xD;
ficient to bring, relatives to her bedside; but&#xD;
you know the world well enough to be able to&#xD;
judge whether it would be likely to have any&#xD;
effect on those who were simply bound to hc~ by&#xD;
ties of convenience.&#xD;
The doctor was silenced. He looked from&#xD;
the bed to the lawyer, and from the lawyer to&#xD;
the bed, trying to understand the inatter,'and&#xD;
failing utterly to do so~ In the range of kin pro."'&#xD;
fessional experience, many sad pages of' human&#xD;
life had come under his eye-.--as they come under&#xD;

160                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                          AN OLD FRIEND.                     181&#xD;
&#xD;
- the eye of all men of al professions, and of all&#xD;
physicians especially~-many desolatestories had&#xD;
been laid bare to him, many woful tragedies had&#xD;
been acted before him, until out of very familiar.&#xD;
ity, he bad grown callous to these varied phases&#xD;
of the one great drama of human suffering. But&#xD;
now he felt strangely touched. That this girl, so&#xD;
young, so fair-had she been ugly, the position&#xD;
would have lost half its pathos 1-so evidently&#xD;
of tender nurture, should be thrown utterly&#xD;
friendless, utterly alone, upon the care and kind-&#xD;
ness of strangers, seemed to him inexpressibly&#xD;
pitiful. lie felt for her deeply-felt as he had&#xD;
not'felt for any one since he was young and im-&#xD;
pressionable, and new at his profession; but&#xD;
with regard ~ John Warwick, his part in the&#xD;
matter the doctor failed entirely to compre-&#xD;
hend. If all that he had said were true, what&#xD;
is4erest had he in the girl, what right to make&#xD;
her safety his personal care? Such conduct&#xD;
*   was~so unlike the quiet, reserved lawyer, always&#xD;
gravely courteous to women, yet always care-&#xD;
fully avoiding them, that it seemed incredible.&#xD;
Reading 'the doctor's surprise in the doctor's&#xD;
face, Mr. Warwick-for Katharine's sake-ad-&#xD;
dressed himself frankly to it.&#xD;
"I see you think it strange that I should&#xD;
occupy the position I do," he said; "but if you&#xD;
will consider a moment, I think you will under-&#xD;
stand why and how it is. Miss Tresham has&#xD;
been living in my sister's house for two years,&#xD;
and I have learned to know her well, and to re-&#xD;
spect her highlyb I do not know why she has&#xD;
left her position; but I am confident that it was&#xD;
by no f~ult of her own; and it would be strange&#xD;
if...eneeting her accidentally, as I have done-I&#xD;
did not do every thing in my power for her.&#xD;
Considering that I am old enough to be her&#xD;
fe~ther, ~ ': sure you will grant this."&#xD;
your age out of the question," said&#xD;
tI~e debtor, with ashade of his usual jovial smile,&#xD;
.1&#xD;
"Z gz'ant~tfully, Mr~ Warwick. Your conduct is&#xD;
tbat of ~ ti~Ite.hearted gentleman, and you have&#xD;
iby'h~art'y iespeet and support. God willing,&#xD;
w*!l1 ~4i the poor girl through, with or without&#xD;
help fro~a anybody else. Now tell me if you&#xD;
have any idea. of the chpse of her illness."&#xD;
"No&#xD;
t the least. When I saw her last she&#xD;
w~s in perfect health."&#xD;
"That was when?"&#xD;
"Less than three weeke ago."&#xD;
"Have you any reason to suppose that she&#xD;
may have been suffering from trouble or distress&#xD;
of mind?"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick thought of S~. John, and paused&#xD;
&#xD;
a moment before he replied. "I do not know"&#xD;
he said. "I think it probable that she has;&#xD;
but if so, we cannot reach the cause, and it is&#xD;
useless to consider it. Do you suppose that&#xD;
mental trouble has brought this on?"&#xD;
"I cannot tell-I can only make a surmise&#xD;
from the condition in which I find her. Speak.&#xD;
ing in the dark, I should say that mental trou.&#xD;
ble, liberally sided and abetted by quack treat-&#xD;
ment, has brought it on."&#xD;
"My instinct was right, then-that man is a&#xD;
quack?"&#xD;
"A quack! That old woman yonder has&#xD;
quite as good a right to put M. D. after her&#xD;
name, and, I dare say, a much better amount of&#xD;
medical knowledge to support it. The scoun-&#xD;
drel has hardly the barest smattering of infor-&#xD;
mation on the subject-as he proves by leaving&#xD;
a case whenever another doctor is called in.&#xD;
This is not the first patient he has brought to&#xD;
death's door-and, unfortunately, some of them&#xD;
go beyond it. Last week a poor fellow died un-&#xD;
der his hands-a carpenter with a large family.&#xD;
As clear a ease of butchery as ever I saw!"&#xD;
"Is there no way of stopping this?"&#xD;
"There is no way as long as people, like our&#xD;
friend Mrs. Crump, choose to send for him.&#xD;
We live in a free country, you know, and when&#xD;
a man comes and settles among ,us, there is&#xD;
no competent authority to examine his diplo-&#xD;
ma and give him a license, before he sets to&#xD;
work killing people."&#xD;
"I think if I see him again, I shall feel very&#xD;
much tempted to put it out of his power to do&#xD;
any more mischief-for some time to come~ at&#xD;
least."&#xD;
"He is not likely to let you see him again.&#xD;
To give the rascal his due, he is the embodiment&#xD;
of discretion. As I came along the street, some.&#xD;
body told me that one of his othei~ patients-his&#xD;
only other one, I expect-was in a critical con-&#xD;
dition. If she dies, I am inclined to think that&#xD;
the town will become too hot to hold him. But&#xD;
we must make arrangements for to-night. Some-&#xD;
body must sit up here-b-somebody who can be&#xD;
relied on to follow my directions exactly."&#xD;
"I will do it."&#xD;
"You can, if you choose-and so shall I,&#xD;
for that matter. hut there must be somebody&#xD;
besides - a woman, of course.' Mrs. Crump&#xD;
would be the person, if she was not broken&#xD;
down; but, from her looks, I should: say that&#xD;
she was up last night. I'll send, my wife. She&#xD;
will be glad to be of service." '&#xD;
"Doctor, how can I thank you!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Don't think of such a thing till we see how&#xD;
It turns out." He walked to the bed, and looked&#xD;
down at the hotly-flushed face, the parched lips,&#xD;
and wandering eyes, with a glance of pity.&#xD;
"Poor ctirl 1" he said to himself. Then, sharp-&#xD;
ly, aloud to the old woman, "More ice here-&#xD;
change these cloths." Then, again, to War-&#xD;
wick, "It all hangs on a thread. There is no&#xD;
telling what the end will be"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
.&amp;amp;N OLD FRIEND&#xD;
WHILE Miss Tresham was lying ill at the&#xD;
Eagle Hotel in Hartsburg, and while Mr. War-&#xD;
wick was quietly journeying along the road that&#xD;
led to his meeting with her, matters and things&#xD;
in Lagrange were in a far from satisfactory con-&#xD;
dition.&#xD;
To begin with the Marks family, there was&#xD;
growing indignation on the part of Mr. Marks,&#xD;
discomfiture and concern on the part of his&#xD;
wife, and turmoil and complaining on the part&#xD;
of the children, at the unaccountable absence&#xD;
of the governess. Two weeks had gone by,&#xD;
without any sign of return, or any word of ex-&#xD;
planation from her. Under these circumstan-&#xD;
ces, what was left for her employers to think&#xD;
but that, she had deliberately forsaken them?&#xD;
It was true that every thing she possessed, with&#xD;
the exception of a small bag containing a few&#xD;
necessary articles of clothing, had been left be-&#xD;
hind; but that might have been done merely to&#xD;
avoid suspicion-and then, there was that unan-&#xD;
swerable riddle, the money! Why had she&#xD;
drawn it, if not to go away ?-why had she been&#xD;
so particular about demanding gold? "It is 'as&#xD;
plain as a pikestaff," said Mr. Marks, "that she&#xD;
meant to leave just in this manner! It was the&#xD;
first suspicion that came into my mind, and it'&#xD;
proves to be the correct one." Poor Katharine&#xD;
~had very little idea, when she went to the bank&#xD;
that morning, how h~avhy it was to tell against&#xD;
her afterward, in the net that circumstances were&#xD;
weaving. At first, Mrs. Marks was stout in her&#xD;
defence, but after a while she succumbed-facts&#xD;
being too strong against her. "It's that hate-&#xD;
ful St. John!" she said, at last. "I'm as sure as&#xD;
can be that Miss Katharine has run away just to&#xD;
getrid of him!" It provoked her that her hus-&#xD;
band would' not, admit the validity of this cx.&#xD;
euse. "Miss' Tresham may have, run' away to&#xD;
get rid of Mr. St~. John," he said, "but it is&#xD;
&#xD;
very certain, Bessie, that s~e needn't have done&#xD;
any thing of the kind if all had been straight&#xD;
and clear with her. If he had no claim on her,'&#xD;
why should she run away from him?" In the&#xD;
face of this masculine logic, Mrs. Marks had no&#xD;
reply-no relief but that of boxing Nelly's~ars,~&#xD;
when that poor little soul cried piteously for Miss&#xD;
Tresham to tell her a story at night.&#xD;
Then there was another annoyance. Mr. St.&#xD;
John, who, if appearances might be trusted,&#xD;
seemed as completely puzr.led as themselves,&#xD;
persisted in calling at the house, in questioning&#xD;
the servants, in accosting Mr. Marks, and in en-&#xD;
deavoring by every means in his power to find&#xD;
out something about the missing governess. As&#xD;
time went on, this became a positive nuisance-&#xD;
and a nuisance all the more disagreeable because&#xD;
Mr. Marks disliked the man, and Mrs. Marks had&#xD;
changed her respectful sympathy into a violent&#xD;
aversion for him. In her eyes, he stood as the&#xD;
representative of the change that had given such&#xD;
a shock to her household, and she detested him&#xD;
accordingly. "Will he never go away?" she&#xD;
said to herself, pettishly, as, day after day, sh~&#xD;
saw the same slender figure, the same dark, regu-&#xD;
lar profile, pass and repass the house. "If he&#xD;
would only go away, I am sure Miss Katharine&#xD;
would come back, and surely Richard couldn't&#xD;
refuse to let her stay." Fortunately for himsOlf,&#xD;
Mr. Marks was not put to the test. St. Johiit did&#xD;
not go away, and Miss Tresham did not return.&#xD;
Morton Annesley called vainly for news, and was&#xD;
always met by the same dismal shake of the&#xD;
head. "Not even a letter, Mrs. Marks?" he&#xD;
would say, with such a wistful look in his eyes&#xD;
that it almost betrayed Mrs. Marks into telling&#xD;
him a consoling falsehood. "Not even a letter,&#xD;
Mr. Annesley,"' she would answer, and heave a&#xD;
deep sigh as the young man went away. At such~&#xD;
times her regret took the form of in~igiiant ~e-&#xD;
preach against Katharine. It was shameful!-&#xD;
Richard was right: it was shameful; she would&#xD;
think, as she went back to her work, andheard&#xD;
the children squabbling in the yard, instead of&#xD;
being settled quietly at their lesions.&#xD;
As for Mrs. Annesley, she was simply in-&#xD;
credulous of this great good fortune which had&#xD;
befallen her. That Katharine should go aweyof&#xD;
her own accord-shouId~ without any ernbarxaks-&#xD;
ing disclosure or trouble whatever, be rewo#ed&#xD;
out of Morton's life-was more than she had ever&#xD;
hoped in her most sanguine moments-.-was far,&#xD;
far too good to be true. She could n~t believe&#xD;
it-she absolutely declined to believe It. Some&#xD;
plot was at the bottom of it, she felt sure-some.~&#xD;

162                       MORTON HOuSE.                                                              AN OLD FRIEND.                      163&#xD;
&#xD;
thing that would ~end by complicating matters&#xD;
more seriously tknn they had been complicated&#xD;
yet, by involving Morton as he had not been in-&#xD;
volved yet. To describe her state of mind dur-&#xD;
ing these two weeks would be impossible. The&#xD;
inaction was terrible to her, tl~e doubt and sus-&#xD;
pense still more terrible. She went to see Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon, but there was no comfort to be obtained&#xD;
there. Mrs. Gordon knew no more than herself,&#xD;
but Mrs. Gordon took a view of the matter which&#xD;
had not occurred to Mrs. Annesley. "The girl&#xD;
has been sent by St. John in search of Felix 1"&#xD;
she cried, as soon as she beard of Katharine's&#xD;
departure, and only her own ignorance of Felix's&#xD;
whereabouts prevented her from instantly setting&#xD;
out to guard iiim from this new danger. As it&#xD;
was, she lived in a state of restless terror which&#xD;
sometimes almost went beyond her control. Her&#xD;
only comforther only hope, was in John War.&#xD;
wick. As long as As was with Felix, she felt that&#xD;
the child was safe. 11cr reliance on him told her&#xD;
this, and did not tell her wrongly. Only some-&#xD;
times she would think with dismay of his liking&#xD;
for 1~atharine, and wring her hands over it. "If&#xD;
he once lets her draw the secret from him I" she&#xD;
thought., But then, again, she would grow&#xD;
ashamed of this, suspicion. Was it likely he&#xD;
would let her do it ?-was it likely that, to the&#xD;
woman he loved best, to the man whom he&#xD;
trusted most, John Warwick would betray the&#xD;
confidence given him as a sacred charge? The&#xD;
woman who had once known him well, the&#xD;
woman whom he had once loved passionately,&#xD;
did him the justice to answer the question in the&#xD;
negative.' No; John Warwick would never do&#xD;
this, and so John Warwick was to be trusted.&#xD;
But oh, Felix I-Felix! That was the burden of&#xD;
the mother's thought, the echo of the mother's&#xD;
cry. That great anxiety dwarfed every other con-&#xD;
sideration-even the consideration of Morton's&#xD;
folly. She still felt for him, and'fpr the bitter&#xD;
distress that was hanging like a sword over his&#xD;
~oth~r's head; but still Felix was at her heart,&#xD;
a~id ther~was no disguising the fact that she&#xD;
would have been glad tohear of Miss Tresham's&#xD;
,r~z~to Tallahoma, even although that return&#xD;
i~ie~rt Morton's marriage with her the next day.&#xD;
Under these circumstances, it may be sup.&#xD;
posed that there was not much sympathy be-&#xD;
tween herself and Mrs. Annesley-yet there was&#xD;
more than might be imagined. 'They were both&#xD;
suffering from keen anxiety-that Was one link.&#xD;
The anxiety of each was about the object dearest&#xD;
to them in the world-that was the second link.&#xD;
The same person, in each case, was the cause of&#xD;
&#xD;
this nuxiety-that was the third link. These&#xD;
things were much in common, and it is doubtful&#xD;
whether they had ever in their lives been so nearly&#xD;
drawn together before. Mrs. Gordon's mode of&#xD;
accounting for Katharine's absence seemed to&#xD;
Mrs. Annesley plausible enough; but Felix was&#xD;
to her a person of small importance-or, to put&#xD;
the matter more correctly, of no importance at&#xD;
all-and, accepting her cousin's theory as a fact,&#xD;
the great consideration still remained, What&#xD;
would be the end of it with regard to Morton?&#xD;
She had heard nothing from St. John, and she&#xD;
had been too completely worsted to think of&#xD;
seeking him again herself. Besides, she had a&#xD;
sort of instinctive distrust of him-an instinctive&#xD;
feeling that she had placed herself in his power.&#xD;
If he saw Morton, and told him of her applies.&#xD;
tion, Morton would never forgive her I This was&#xD;
what made a coward of her, for she was very far&#xD;
from being a subtle diplomatist ready to walk to&#xD;
her end over any obstacles; but rather a woman&#xD;
weak with the weakness of her sex, who, having&#xD;
set in motion certain machinery of the power of&#xD;
which she had only a vague idea, stood by,&#xD;
shrinking from the consequences - a woman&#xD;
whose hands were fettered, from the use of plain&#xD;
i~ieans to a plain end, by a purely ideal fear-the&#xD;
fear of dosing her son's love, and forfeiting her&#xD;
son's respect.&#xD;
As time went on, Morton was, perhaps, the&#xD;
person most to be compassionate. All the&#xD;
others had "themselves to thank," in great&#xD;
measure, for their uneasiness; everybody else&#xD;
(even Mrs. Gordon) was suffering from the direct&#xD;
result of certain acts of his or her own. But&#xD;
Morton had done nothing to bring upon him-&#xD;
self the keen anxiety which he was enduring.&#xD;
It may be perfectly true that we cry all the same&#xD;
whether we break our toys ourselves, or whether&#xD;
somebody else does the work of destruction for&#xD;
us, and that it is by no means a source of com-&#xD;
fort when "one has only one's self to blame"&#xD;
for any of the disasters of life; but, in the mat-&#xD;
ter of sympathy, this fact of personal responsibil-&#xD;
ity makes a great difference and justly so. The&#xD;
man who has brought his trouble upon himself&#xD;
can, at best, advance only half the claim on our&#xD;
sympathy, of one who suffers through misfortune,&#xD;
or circumstance, or the fault of others. On this&#xD;
ground, therefore, it may be conceded that Mor-&#xD;
ton deserved compassion mOre than any other&#xD;
of the circle whose interests were so capriciously&#xD;
twisted and intertwined together. Not on the&#xD;
ground of his love for Katharine Tresham, nor&#xD;
of the suffering which that love entailed upbxi&#xD;
&#xD;
him, but on the ground of his earnest desire to&#xD;
"do the thing which was right," no matter what&#xD;
the cost of that doing might be; of his loyal&#xD;
effort to reconcile the different claims that were&#xD;
conflicting with him, by the plain, straight rule&#xD;
of honor; and of his sincere renunciation of self,&#xD;
which deserved a better return than had yet be-&#xD;
fallen it. During these weeks he had gone about&#xD;
the ordinary affairs of life, and tried to meet them&#xD;
with his ordinary face; but, somehow, it would&#xD;
not do. Knocking more and more painfully at&#xD;
his heart, echoing more and more loudly in his&#xD;
ears, he heard the question, Where has she&#xD;
gone ?-what has become of her? Had she, in-&#xD;
deed, passed out of his life forever? Had he&#xD;
trifled so long with the happiness that might&#xD;
have been his, by a word, perhaps, that it had&#xD;
at last escaped him? Asking himself these&#xD;
questions, he took a sudden resolve. He would&#xD;
go in search of her, and, having once found her,&#xD;
he would not leave her again until all trifling and&#xD;
hesitation were at an end, until the fate of his life&#xD;
was settled as far as it was in Katharine Tresh-&#xD;
am's power to settle it. Her very absence, which&#xD;
told against her so strongly in the eyes of every&#xD;
one else, did not shake his dogged faith for an&#xD;
instant. He trusted her! That was his answer&#xD;
to all that the voice of the world could urge;&#xD;
and, whether it was a wise one or not, let us at&#xD;
least acknowledge that it was a noble one.&#xD;
Having niade up his mind to go, Annesley was&#xD;
not long in carrying the design into execution.&#xD;
A plausible excuse of business was soon found&#xD;
for leaving home, and, although Mrs. Annesley&#xD;
strongly suspected the real ,cause of his depart9&#xD;
nrc, she had no excuse for saying, no means of&#xD;
doing, any thing to prevent it. To expostulate&#xD;
would have been worse than useless, and there&#xD;
was nothing else left. "It comes of being a&#xD;
woman," she thought, bitterly; but, in fact, if&#xD;
she had been a man a hundred times over, she&#xD;
could have thrown no obstacle in Morton's path&#xD;
which Morton's impetuous resolution would not&#xD;
have surmounted. As a general rule, women are&#xD;
very much given to magnifying the disabilities&#xD;
of their sex, when these very disabilities often&#xD;
make the secret of their greatest strength. In&#xD;
the present instance, it was certainly so. No&#xD;
tangible restraint which Mrs. Annesley could&#xD;
possibly have~ place over her son would have&#xD;
bound him half so firmly, would havO influenced&#xD;
him half so much,' as the intangible restraint of&#xD;
those wishes which appealed to him the more&#xD;
because she had no power to enforce them.&#xD;
Still, he bsgan to consider that he had, perhaps,&#xD;
&#xD;
sacrificed a little too much to them; and, in&#xD;
taking his present resolution, he put them ten-&#xD;
derly but decidedly on one side. ~Some instinct&#xD;
told him that his first duty now was to the wom-&#xD;
an he loved, and, with the simplicity of thought&#xD;
and intention which characterized him, he set&#xD;
forth to fulfil this duty.&#xD;
It was on the sixteenth of January-exactly&#xD;
two weeks after Katharine left-that Morton&#xD;
drove out of the gates of Anneadale, and turned&#xD;
his horses heads into the road that led to Sax-&#xD;
ford. He had not gone more than a mile when&#xD;
he met George Raynor. Of course, a pause and&#xD;
a conversation ensued.&#xD;
"You look as if you were rigged out for&#xD;
travelling," said Mr. Raynor, after the first&#xD;
greetings were over. "Going down to Apalat-&#xD;
ka?"&#xD;
"No-only to Saxford," Annesley answered.&#xD;
"I have to meet a man there on business."&#xD;
This was strictly true; but the speaker did not&#xD;
add that the man would willingly have come&#xD;
to Lagrange. "Why should you think of Apa.&#xD;
latka? Is any thing going on down there?"&#xD;
"Nothing that I know of; but I heard you&#xD;
promise Seymour to go down soon, and I thought&#xD;
you might be on your way to fulfil the promise.&#xD;
Maggie Lester went home yesterday," he added,&#xD;
with a laugh.&#xD;
"And you think I am likely to be following&#xD;
Miss Maggie? Thank you; I don't care to inter-&#xD;
fere with Lawton's amusement. She didn't stay&#xD;
long with Mrs. Raynor, then?"&#xD;
"Her mother wrote for her-company ex-&#xD;
pected, or something of the sort-and she was&#xD;
obliged to leave. Flora was very sorry to see&#xD;
her go-chiefly, I think, because she~ took Irene&#xD;
along.~'&#xD;
":bid Miss Irene go?" said Annesley, a lit-&#xD;
tle absently. "I am sorry to hear that,' and so&#xD;
will a great many other people be. But sho&#xD;
will be back soon-won't she?"&#xD;
"Hardly soon, according to present arrange.&#xD;
ments. Flora is to join her in Apalatka, a~d&#xD;
they will go on to Mobile' together. I fancy La-&#xD;
grange won't see either of them again very&#xD;
shortly. I look forward with resignation to a&#xD;
long period of bachelor-soh, Charlcy!-You&#xD;
had better draw your horses out of the way,&#xD;
rink! Here comes the stage."&#xD;
rink-the servant who was driving Annes-&#xD;
ley-drew his horses to one side of the road ac.&#xD;
cordingly; while Charley, who was young and&#xD;
foolish, backed into a fence - corner, as the&#xD;
heavily-laden coach, with its six horses, itS nine.&#xD;
&#xD;

164:                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                                 AN OLD FRIEND.                          165&#xD;
&#xD;
inside passengers, end one fortunate outsider,&#xD;
who had secured the seat beside the driver,&#xD;
rolled by with a sweeping air of grand impor-&#xD;
tance on its way to Saxford. As it passed, An-&#xD;
i~esley glanced round and ran his eye over the&#xD;
passengers, vaguely looking for an acquaintance,&#xD;
as people will do, whether in stage-coaches or&#xD;
railroad-trains. With the exception of the&#xD;
driver, to whom he nodded, he saw not one&#xD;
familiar face-duning the first instant, that is.&#xD;
The second after, a man, on the seat opposite&#xD;
from the side of the road on which Raynor and&#xD;
hin~seif were, leaned forward for a look at the&#xD;
way-side group, and he recognized St. John.&#xD;
Long after the coach had passed out of sight,&#xD;
after he had~said good-by to ilaynor, and was&#xD;
once rnor~ under way, with the horses trotting&#xD;
briskly over ~the smooth, well-beaten road, that&#xD;
face remained with Annesley to conjure up tor-&#xD;
menting thoughts. Why was St. John leaving&#xD;
Talla~zoma? Why was he going to Saxford?&#xD;
What connection did he have with Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am? These three questions formed the text of&#xD;
a mental discourse that occupied his attention&#xD;
until the roofs of Saxford came in sight, just as&#xD;
the sun was going down in a gorgeous bed of&#xD;
sunset clouds, and the whole wide panorama of&#xD;
Nature-its fields, and valleys, and shaded hill-&#xD;
sides-began to clothe themselves in the exqui-&#xD;
site purple of the winter gloaming.&#xD;
.Annesley drove to the principal hotel of the&#xD;
place, and sound that the coach had preceded&#xD;
him in its arrival by an hour or two. The first&#xD;
person he saw, on entering the house, was St.&#xD;
John. involuntarily the young man frowned&#xD;
the very sight of the sallow, handsome face had&#xD;
gro~ ~s repugnant to him as to Mr. Marks.&#xD;
or other this man was connected with&#xD;
Zatht~rine and~ Y~atharine's disappearance-ac-&#xD;
cording to Mrs. Gordon, he had sent her away;&#xD;
according to Mr. Marks, he, at lea0t, knew where&#xD;
she was, and why she had gone. In either view&#xD;
of the case, Annesley felt inclined to take him&#xD;
by the throat and demand "satisfaction" in the&#xD;
form ef information on the spot. But the codes&#xD;
of olvilized life discourage, if they do not abso-&#xD;
lutely condemn~ such arbitrary proceedings as&#xD;
these; and, this consideration apart, such pro.&#xD;
ceedings are sometimes attended with unpleas-&#xD;
ant consequences. Morton restrained the in-&#xD;
clination, and passed on. After the business of&#xD;
ol$aining a room was over, his first inquiry star-&#xD;
tled "mine hoat" a little. Was there a Catho-&#xD;
lb priest residing in Saxford?&#xD;
"~~u're the second gentleman that's asked&#xD;
&#xD;
that question, Mr. Annesley," answered the pro-&#xD;
prietor, opening his eyes, but smiling all the&#xD;
same. "There was a gentleman came in the&#xD;
stage, and wanted to know the same thing. I&#xD;
told him, sir, what I can tell you-that there's&#xD;
no priest living in town, but one comes here&#xD;
sometimes-I really can't say how often. I re-&#xD;
ferred the other gentleman to an Irish family,&#xD;
named Malone, for information; but, if you are&#xD;
anxious to know any thing about the priest, I'll&#xD;
take pleasure in sending round and finding out&#xD;
every thing for you.~~&#xD;
"Thank you," said Morton, a little amused&#xD;
at the contrast thus strikingly marked by the&#xD;
landlord between Mr. Annesley of Annesdale&#xD;
and an ordinary traveller, who was (so far as the&#xD;
knowledge of thatworthy extended) Mr. Nobody&#xD;
of Nowhere. "I will trouble you to find out,&#xD;
then, whether the priest is now in Saxford, and,&#xD;
if he is not, when he was here last, and is likely&#xD;
to be here again. When the messenger returns,&#xD;
send him up to my room, if you please."&#xD;
Before long, there was a tap at Morton's&#xD;
door, and the expected messenger made his ap-&#xD;
pearance. He was a bright-looking boy, and&#xD;
delivered his message very clearly. He had&#xD;
seen Mrs. Malone. The priest was in town-&#xD;
had arrived that evening to he in time for Sun-&#xD;
day-and was staying with the Malone family.&#xD;
On hearing that a gentleman at the hotel wished&#xD;
to see him, Mrs. Malone had suggested that it&#xD;
would be well if the gentleman would defer his&#xD;
visit until the next morning- the father had&#xD;
come thirtymiles that day, and was not very&#xD;
well, and a gentleman had already called on&#xD;
him. If the gentleman was going away, ho&#xD;
might come that night, of course; but, if not,&#xD;
it would be more convenient if he would wait&#xD;
until the next morning.&#xD;
"I'll wait," he said, absently; and, after the&#xD;
messenger left, he asked himself what di~'erence&#xD;
it made. He had waited three weeks in La-&#xD;
grange-why not wait one night~ in Saxford?&#xD;
Yet he felt impatient ovcr the delay1 as people&#xD;
will feel over any delay, however slight, that in-&#xD;
tervenes between the fruition of a hope or the&#xD;
fulfilment of an expectation.&#xD;
He reasoned with himself about this folly,&#xD;
however, and, after a whiin, managed to recon-&#xD;
cUe himself to the charitable opinion that there&#xD;
was no real need for disturbing Father Martin's&#xD;
well-earned repose on that night. One thing, at~&#xD;
least, he had gained by the application. He had&#xD;
learned that, instead of knowing all about Keth-&#xD;
anne, St. John, like himself, was merely ~at'the&#xD;
&#xD;
track of discovery, and that, also like himself;&#xD;
the first person to whom he applied for informa-&#xD;
tion was the person '~liom Katharine would have&#xD;
been most likely to take into her confidence-&#xD;
that is, the priest.&#xD;
While he was arriving at this conclusion, the&#xD;
person of whom he was thinking entered the&#xD;
hotel and passed directly into the bar-room. If&#xD;
Morton had seen him it is probable that he would&#xD;
not have felt encouraged concerning the degree&#xD;
of information which Father Martin was able or&#xD;
likely to give. Discomfiture was written as legi-&#xD;
bly on St. John's face as anger betrayed itself in&#xD;
his manner. On entering the door he pushed&#xD;
rudely against a man who chanced to be stand-&#xD;
ing near, and did not trouble himself to make&#xD;
even the ghost of an apology. Walking for-&#xD;
ward, with an air of profound unconsciousness,&#xD;
he called for a glass of brandy, received it, and&#xD;
was about to raise it to his lips, when the man&#xD;
who had been so unceremoniously treated fol-&#xD;
lowed and touched his arm.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," he said, quietly, but&#xD;
with a certain tone of menace in his voice.&#xD;
"You are the gentleman who came within an&#xD;
ace of knocking me down, I believe. Did I&#xD;
hear you apologize for it?"&#xD;
- St. John turned quickly, with an insolent&#xD;
reply visible in his eyes before it passed his&#xD;
lips. He was evidently in that frame of mind&#xD;
when to insult somebody is nothing less than a&#xD;
positive relief. As it chanced, however, he had&#xD;
no. time to speak. No sooner did he turn his&#xD;
face than the other recoiled a step-in sheer&#xD;
amazement, as it seemed.&#xD;
"By -1" he said, "St. John?"&#xD;
* Something in his tone, something in his man-&#xD;
ner, struck even the by-standers with surprise.&#xD;
They had looked with interest the minute before&#xD;
-anxious to see the end of what promised to&#xD;
be a vei~y pretty quarrel-but the interest sensi-&#xD;
bly quickened at this unexpected recognition.&#xD;
Its effect on $t. John was unmistakable. He&#xD;
looked keenly for a second in the face before&#xD;
him-his own growing a shade paler, meanwhile&#xD;
-then he put down, untouched, the glass of&#xD;
brandy, and extended his hand.&#xD;
"You!" he said. "I had no idea it was&#xD;
you. I apologize, of course. Where the devil&#xD;
did you come from?"&#xD;
The other took his offered hand and shook it&#xD;
with a laugh. After the first manifestation of&#xD;
surprise, the meeting seemed to affect him very&#xD;
little, cit her one way or another.&#xD;
"Where I came from isn't' half as ~vondcrful&#xD;
&#xD;
as where you came from," he answered. "Sup&#xD;
pose we exchange reminiscences at our leisure?&#xD;
Will you come to my room? You can take your&#xD;
brandy there, and I will order some to keep you&#xD;
company."&#xD;
"All right," said St. John; but he said it&#xD;
reluctantly, and, as he allowed his companion to&#xD;
take his arm and lead him away, the people&#xD;
whom he left behind could not help thinking&#xD;
that this meeting was to him any thing hut a&#xD;
pleasurable event.&#xD;
They were quite right, too. He ground his&#xD;
teeth, and cursed his unlucky fate, as he fol-&#xD;
lowed the man who had claimed his acquaint-&#xD;
anceup the steep and ill-lighted staircase of the&#xD;
hotel. They entered a room just at the head&#xD;
of the flight of steps, and, while the propriety~&#xD;
of the apartment fumbled about for the means&#xD;
of striking a light, St. John sat down on the first&#xD;
substantial object he came to, which chanced to&#xD;
be a table, and was silent.&#xD;
"Deuce take the thing! Where has it&#xD;
gone?" grumbled the one who was stumbling&#xD;
about the room, kicking the chairs, and finally&#xD;
knocking.down the pitcher and basin with a&#xD;
resounding clatter. "I've found the confound-&#xD;
ed candle, but where the devil has the match.&#xD;
box gone! Here-no. D- it, all the water's&#xD;
spilled, and I've stepped right into it? ?shawl&#xD;
I'll get a light across the passage and not keep&#xD;
you in the dark this way, St. John. Excuse me&#xD;
for a minute."&#xD;
St. John vouchsafed not a word as the speaker&#xD;
left the room and crossed the passage to a door&#xD;
just opposite, under which a stream of light was&#xD;
visible. -&#xD;
His knock was answered by a gentleman, who&#xD;
opened the door almost immediately, and cour-&#xD;
teously acceded to his request. He returned to&#xD;
a table in the room, and brought from it a can-&#xD;
dle with which to light the one presented. As&#xD;
he did so his face was fully exposed to view, and&#xD;
St. John, sitting in the darknesss of the oppo-&#xD;
site room, recognized Annesley.-. Instinctively&#xD;
he drew a little farther back into the friendly&#xD;
shade. At that particular time, and under&#xD;
those particular circumstances, he had no desire&#xD;
to be recognized in return. There was no dan.&#xD;
ger of this, however, for his position effectually&#xD;
shielded him; and, besides this, Morton's atten-&#xD;
tion was occupied just then with the man before&#xD;
him. As he brought forward the candle some-&#xD;
thing like recognition was plainly to be seen in&#xD;
his face-was evidently struggling to assert itself&#xD;
La his mind. As the stranger held Ma candle to&#xD;
&#xD;

the flame, and thelight thus fell on his face, the&#xD;
recognition suddenly became clear.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," said the young man.&#xD;
"I did not know y~u at first. Dr. Joyner, is it&#xD;
not?"&#xD;
Dr. Joyner-for it was indeed he-looked&#xD;
with a start into the face before him; then, ac-&#xD;
cording to his invariable custom, shifted his eyes&#xD;
back to the candle.&#xD;
"You are right. Joyner is my name," he&#xD;
said, "but I believe you have the advantage of&#xD;
me, sir."&#xD;
"That is natural," said Morton, smiling a&#xD;
little. "I never saw you but once-but my&#xD;
memory is good for faces. I was down in Apa-&#xD;
latka about six months ago, and, in passing&#xD;
through Hartsburg, I called at your office to get&#xD;
a prescription for a sprained wrist. You may&#xD;
not remember the occurrence, but, as soon as I&#xD;
saw your face, it came back to me,"&#xD;
"Doctors see so many people that they may&#xD;
be pardoned for havingpoor memories," said the&#xD;
other, apologetically. "I think I remember you,&#xD;
though," he went on, looking again at the young&#xD;
man. "You were with Mr. Seymour, I believe,&#xD;
and he introduced you as Mr. Annesley, of La-&#xD;
grange."&#xD;
"The same," said Morton. "Your lotion did&#xD;
my wrist a great deal of good," he added, with&#xD;
the frankness that sat very winningly upon him.&#xD;
"Won't you come in? I should like to hear&#xD;
something of Apalatka and my friends down&#xD;
there."&#xD;
"I regret-I am sorry-it would give me&#xD;
great pleasure," said the doctor, stammering, as&#xD;
he bowed over his candlestick, "but I left a&#xD;
friend in my room-in the dark, too, poor fel-&#xD;
low I-and he is waiting for me to return. Other-&#xD;
wise-" Another bow completed the sentence."&#xD;
"In that case I can't expect to detain you,&#xD;
of course," said Morton. "Good-evening."&#xD;
When the doctor went back into his own&#xD;
room his face wore an expression of mingled sur-&#xD;
prise and amusement, which at once attracted&#xD;
St. John's attention and roused his curiosity.&#xD;
"You seem to be enjoying something amaz&#xD;
ingly," he said. "Considering that the brandy&#xD;
hasn't come yet, you might as well let me knon&#xD;
what It is. One thing is certain "-with a lool&#xD;
of disgust around-" I don't see much in th&#xD;
way of amusement hereY&#xD;
"I am only enjoying a new illustration of ar&#xD;
old proverb," said the other, putting the candle&#xD;
stick on a rickety table that was on one side ol&#xD;
V       the room, with a cracked looking-glass hanging&#xD;
&#xD;
over it. "Did you ever chance to hear that 'a&#xD;
prophet is never without honor save in his own&#xD;
country?' Well, I've just had an example of&#xD;
that. For want of something better to do, I have&#xD;
been trying my hand lately at the healing art, and&#xD;
the result was by no means as brilliant as I could&#xD;
have wished. The other doctors in the place&#xD;
where I settled were jealous of sue, a few un.&#xD;
pleasant accidents attended my practice, a man&#xD;
or two died-don't men die sometimes under the&#xD;
hands of regular M. D.'s ?-and the consequence&#xD;
was that the people raised an uproar, and I had&#xD;
to leave-absolutely, my dear St* John, I had to&#xD;
leave, in preference to being mobbed. Think&#xD;
what a state of barbarism this horrible country&#xD;
is in! Well, I left the place-.Hartsburg is its&#xD;
name-under those circumstances, and I come&#xD;
here, and the first person I meet compliments&#xD;
- actually compliments - me on my medical&#xD;
skill!"&#xD;
"That young fellow across the passage?"&#xD;
"Yes-did you see him? Fine-looking, isn't&#xD;
he? One of the first men in the country round&#xD;
about here, I believe. I met him, as he remind-&#xD;
ed me, in Hartsburg, with a Mr. Seymour, a&#xD;
wealthy planter who lives in the county of&#xD;
which Hartsburg is the seat. He had sprained&#xD;
his wrist, and I gave him. a lotion for it. He&#xD;
says it worked excellently."&#xD;
"Then why couldn't you prescribe for your&#xD;
other patients as well?"&#xD;
Dr. Joyner indulged in a laugh-.--quiet, but&#xD;
of considerable depth and evident enjoyment.&#xD;
"I sprained my own wrist once," he said,&#xD;
"and I got this prescription for it from a doe.&#xD;
tor. You see it's useful ~never to forget any&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"And you practiced medicine en the strength&#xD;
of knowing one prescription? Well "-with an&#xD;
impatient movementp..-" I suppose it was as good&#xD;
a trade as any other that you were likely to drift&#xD;
into. What did you leave the old country for?"&#xD;
"Humph!" said the doctor, looking at him&#xD;
I askance. "What did you leave it for?"&#xD;
"That's easily answered-because I felt dis.&#xD;
- posed to do so."&#xD;
"Oh, you did, did you? Well, then, there's&#xD;
a good deal of difference between us. I left&#xD;
because the police were so unusually pressing in&#xD;
their attentions, just then, that I had no alterna-&#xD;
tive but to do so. I made the narrowest slip of&#xD;
the galleys imaginable," said he, growing pale,&#xD;
notwithstanding his lightness of tone. "'Ma&#xD;
foil it would be delightful to be number nine&#xD;
of a chain-gang just now! rractising medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
at the expense of the good people of Hartsburg is&#xD;
quite an improvement on that. Do you object to&#xD;
my leaving you for a minute? I'll step to the&#xD;
door and call for that brandy. In a place like&#xD;
this you have to assert yourself, or the rascals&#xD;
will neglect you."&#xD;
St. John making no objection, Dr. Joyner pro.&#xD;
needed to step to the door and assert himself.&#xD;
Having shouted for some time, he at last suc-&#xD;
ceeded in bringing up the brandy, and half a&#xD;
dozen people besides, anxious~ to know if the&#xD;
house was on fire. After reassuring them on&#xD;
this point, he coolly relieved the servant of the&#xD;
brandy, shut the door in the faces of the others,&#xD;
and returned to St. John.&#xD;
"There, now!" said he, setting the bottle&#xD;
and two glasses which accompanied it down on&#xD;
the table. "I call this comfortable-two old&#xD;
friends and good comrades drinking each other's&#xD;
health in elegant seclusion. You'll find water in&#xD;
that pitcher there, St. John-confound it! I for-&#xD;
got it was spilt. Shall I call for more?"&#xD;
"Not on my account," said St. John, resign-&#xD;
edly. "I don't car~ to bring up half the house-&#xD;
hold again. Sit down," he went on, impatiently.&#xD;
"Something is on your mind-I've seen that&#xD;
from the first. Speak it out, and have done."&#xD;
"With all my heart," said the other, sitting&#xD;
down and composedly draining a glass of spirits.&#xD;
"You haven't told me yet how you enme here,"&#xD;
he added, with a sudden furtive glance at his&#xD;
companion's face. "One good turn deserves&#xD;
another. I've been frank with you-now be&#xD;
frank with me. Has the pretty little game of&#xD;
ro~ege et nob- done for you also?"&#xD;
"I'm here on business," said St. John, ir-&#xD;
ritably. "I thought I told you that. What is&#xD;
the good of~ being so d-d inquisitive? I&#xD;
haven't been in America more than a month or&#xD;
two, and I shall not stay an hour longer than I&#xD;
can possibly help."&#xD;
"Are you very closely occupied just now?"&#xD;
"That depends on circumstances. Why do&#xD;
you ask?"&#xD;
The other looked over his shoulder nervously&#xD;
at the door. Then drew hisehair a little nearer.&#xD;
"Would you be willing to run a small risk for a&#xD;
great reward?" he asked, quickly.&#xD;
"That depends," said St. John, watching him&#xD;
coolly; "both on the degree of risk, and the&#xD;
amount of the reward."&#xD;
"The risk is hardly worth considering, and&#xD;
the amount is that of a moderate fortune. In&#xD;
one word, St. John, can I depend on you, or can&#xD;
I not? This thing has been on my mind for&#xD;
&#xD;
some time, and I have been considering day and&#xD;
night how I could manage it without any assist-&#xD;
ance; but when I saw you, the problem was&#xD;
solved for me. I said at once, 'There is the&#xD;
man in the very nick of time. If his head's as&#xD;
cool and his wits are as sharp 'as they used to be,&#xD;
I've nothing more to fear."'&#xD;
"I don't stand in any need ofa dose of fiat.&#xD;
tory," said St. John. "Affairs are desperate&#xD;
with me juSt now, and I am ready for any thing&#xD;
that won't put my neck in a noose. A person&#xD;
on whom I depended has just given me the Slip&#xD;
in the most complete manner. A scheme on&#xD;
which I have been building is likely to come to&#xD;
nothing, as far as I am concerned, and so-pass&#xD;
the brandy, and let me hear your plan."&#xD;
"It's not a thing to describe in a place like&#xD;
this," said the other, glancing round again. "If&#xD;
we talk about it at all, it must be in French.&#xD;
"You don't object, do you?"&#xD;
"Not in the least."&#xD;
"Listen then," said he, plunging at once into&#xD;
French, and speaking with an ease and fluency&#xD;
which proved his intimate acquaintance with the&#xD;
language. "Before I left Hartsburg, I chanced&#xD;
to hear that a bank of importance, which is es-&#xD;
tablished there, was about to send a large amount&#xD;
of specie for distribution among its various&#xD;
branch banks. I did not pay much attention&#xD;
one way or another to the report, until, in com-&#xD;
ing to Saxford, I travelled with a man who is&#xD;
well known to be the messenger intrusted with&#xD;
the money. This fact, and my own desperate&#xD;
condition, soon made me think that here was an&#xD;
excellent opportunity of fortune, only needing a&#xD;
man of courage and nerve to seize it. The cour-&#xD;
age and nerve I had, my dear St. John, but I&#xD;
needed a few other things-a little assistance,&#xD;
principally. The undertaking is too great for&#xD;
one person to attempt. I needed a comrade to&#xD;
share the risk and-the reward. As soon as I&#xD;
saw you, I thought 'Here is my man.' It's for&#xD;
you to say whether or not I was right."&#xD;
"1 have heard the object," said ~St. John,&#xD;
coolly. "How about the means?"&#xD;
"The means are as plain as could be desired.&#xD;
The messenger is at present on his way to Talla.'&#xD;
horns, wimre the specie will be lodged in the&#xD;
bank until opportunities are found for forwani-&#xD;
ing it to the other branches. Now, I have been&#xD;
in Tallahoma, and Ihave seen this bank. Write&#xD;
me down a fool, my dear St. John, if it would not&#xD;
be as easy to enter it as to walk out of this room.&#xD;
See here!"&#xD;
lie took from his pocket a morocco case of&#xD;

&#xD;
moderate size, touched a spring, and, as it flew&#xD;
open, he held it out for the inspection of the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
"Whatwould you call that, now?" he asked.,&#xD;
St. John regarded it superciliously, as he&#xD;
answered, "I should call it a box of tooth-instru-&#xD;
ments. Have you been practising dentistry as&#xD;
well as 'physic?"&#xD;
"A little. I fleshed thls".-he held up to&#xD;
St. John's recoiling sight a formidable-looking&#xD;
pair of forceps-" in lhe-"&#xD;
"Spare me a description of the operation, I&#xD;
beg," interrupted the other, with unconcealed&#xD;
disgust. "What have these things to do with&#xD;
the subject you were talking of?"&#xD;
"Don't ~e impatient, and you shall hear.&#xD;
You would call it a box of tooth-instruments,&#xD;
would you? Well, you're not to blame there-.&#xD;
and that's the beauty of it. Anybody would&#xD;
call it the same thing. But now-I'll show&#xD;
you."&#xD;
So saying, he took the instruments from the&#xD;
box, then, with great care, removed the red-&#xD;
velvet cushion on which they had rested, and&#xD;
which turned out to be a false bottom, beneath&#xD;
which was .a eiivity containing a dozen or more&#xD;
of eccentric-shaped implements, the use of which&#xD;
it would have puzzled an ordinary observer to'&#xD;
conjecture. It did not puzzle St. John in the&#xD;
least.&#xD;
"You are well '-supplied," he remarked, with&#xD;
a grim smile.&#xD;
"You may say so l Look at that, now, will&#xD;
you?''&#xD;
He lifted a small saw, made of the finest&#xD;
watch-spring steel, and exhibited it, handling it&#xD;
with the same caressing touch which a painter,&#xD;
who has not used his brushes for some time, be-&#xD;
stows on those beloved servitors of his more&#xD;
beloved art, or with which a musician passes his&#xD;
hand over the strings or keys of his favorite in-&#xD;
strument.&#xD;
"That walks through iron with the seine ease&#xD;
that a good carpenter's saw passes through&#xD;
wot~d!" cried he, with enthusiasm. "And&#xD;
here-" He went on to expatiate upon the&#xD;
excellence of various of the implements, and&#xD;
the virtues of the box itself. "You observe,"&#xD;
he said, "there is room here for other mat-&#xD;
ters besides these useful little gentlemen. I&#xD;
keep any papers of importance, that it might&#xD;
not be advisable to have about me, here too."&#xD;
~It is a good idea," said St. John, absently.&#xD;
"But about this bank." He thought for a me.&#xD;
ment, then looked up with something like a&#xD;
&#xD;
flash in his eye. "The man who is responsible&#xD;
-the cashier, 1 believe they call him-is named&#xD;
Marks, isn't he???&#xD;
"I-yes, I believe so. I didn't pay much&#xD;
attention to his name. What has that got to do&#xD;
with it?"&#xD;
"It has to do with it that he is an unman-&#xD;
nered scoundrel, who has gone out of his way&#xD;
to insult me on one or two occasions," an-&#xD;
swered St. John, vindictively. "If it's his bank&#xD;
that you want to rob, I'll help you, with the&#xD;
greatest pleasure, on the understanding that we&#xD;
share the spoils fairly. But I can tell you that&#xD;
you will have to be very cautious in jour ar-&#xD;
rangements."&#xD;
"We will discuss them now," said the other,&#xD;
eagerly. "Help yourself to thc brandy, and then&#xD;
we can plan the campaign."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
~AT1lER MARTIN.&#xD;
EARLY the next morning-as early as was at&#xD;
all compatible with civilized habits-Annesley&#xD;
set forth to pay his visit to the Catholic priest.&#xD;
Having been carefully directed with regard to&#xD;
the whereabouts of the Malone house, he had no&#xD;
difficulty in finding it, and, when he came to a&#xD;
plain two-story building, with the usual four sides,&#xD;
and the usual long piazzas, set back from the&#xD;
street in a green yard, he knew at once that&#xD;
it was the place of which' he was in search.&#xD;
His knock at the front door was answered by&#xD;
a pleasant-looking woman, with an unmistakably&#xD;
Irish face, and still more unmistakably Irish&#xD;
accent. Hearing that he was "the gentleman to&#xD;
see the priest," she asked him to walk in.&#xD;
"Father Martin went into the garden for a&#xD;
walk," she said. "I will send one of the chil-&#xD;
dren to tell him you are here."&#xD;
"It would be a pity to bring him in," said&#xD;
Annesley, smiling, and winning her heart at once&#xD;
by hia face and manner. "Can't I go to him?&#xD;
I have only a few words to say, and I need not&#xD;
disturb his walk very long to say them."&#xD;
"I-yes, sir; there is no reason why you&#xD;
should not go," answered Mrs. Malone, after a&#xD;
moment's hesitation. "Straight across the yard&#xD;
-yonder is the garden-gate. It can't be long&#xD;
before you find the father; he's walking in there&#xD;
somewhere."&#xD;
Annesley thanked her, and went his way.{A&#xD;
path led across the yard to the gate of4whielt~1~4&#xD;
&#xD;
had spoken~ Opening it, he found himself in a&#xD;
garden, which was not very much of a place in&#xD;
the way of size or arrangement, but which had a&#xD;
certain attraction, seen under that bright morn-&#xD;
ing sky, with the Bun shining gayly across the&#xD;
cabbages and rose-bushes, the birds twittering&#xD;
and trilling in every tree, and the fresh odor of&#xD;
newly-turned earth from some spaded beds.&#xD;
* But the chief beauty of the place was in the&#xD;
prospect beyond-a glorious panorama of open&#xD;
country spreading as far as the eye could see; a&#xD;
sweep of level fields near at hand; then hills&#xD;
and valleys farther off, mingling and blending, as&#xD;
only Nature's perspective can blend, gleams of&#xD;
brightness and patches of shade, clouds drift-&#xD;
ing, delicious "bits" of harmony and contrast&#xD;
everywhere, and a breadth of landscape, impos-&#xD;
sible to describe, stretching to the verge of the&#xD;
horizon, where it wns edged by a fringe of dis-&#xD;
tant forest.&#xD;
Annesley was charmed; but he did not have&#xD;
time to indulge the luxury of sight as he would&#xD;
have liked. He gave one minute to admiration,&#xD;
then looked round for the object of his seareji.&#xD;
It was not long before he discerned a black figure&#xD;
walking up and down under a trellis, which cov-&#xD;
ered one of the walks, and was overrun by a&#xD;
grape-vine. Advancing to the nearest,&#xD;
he saw a man of middle age and decidedly sacer-&#xD;
dotal aspect-a man who wore a black cassoclc,&#xD;
and was reading from a well-worn breviary-&#xD;
advancing toward him. As they came within a&#xD;
few feet of each other, the priest looked up.&#xD;
Morton took off his hat, and introduced himself&#xD;
at once.&#xD;
"My name is Atiriesley," he said. "I call by&#xD;
appointment. Mrs. Malone told me I should find&#xD;
Mr. Martin here."&#xD;
"I am Mr. Martin," answered the ecclesias-&#xD;
tie, courteously. He closed his book, and, com-&#xD;
ing a step nearer, offered his hand. "Your name&#xD;
is not unknown to me, Mr. Airncsley," he said.&#xD;
"I am glad to meet you. Is there any thing I&#xD;
can O~ tor you?"&#xD;
"You can be kind enough to answer a few&#xD;
questions for me," Annesley replied. "May I-~&#xD;
but are you at leisure to attend to me now?"&#xD;
~ I "Perfectly at leisure," answered the other.&#xD;
remained at home this morning because I ex-&#xD;
pected your call. I was only reading my office&#xD;
-you don't disturb me in the least. Shall we&#xD;
return to the house, or will you sit down here?&#xD;
The air is delightful."&#xD;
"If you do not object, let us remain here,&#xD;
by all means. Is it necessary, though, that I&#xD;
&#xD;
should interrupt your walk? 1 should he sorry&#xD;
to do so."&#xD;
"Join me, then," said Father Martin, emil.&#xD;
ing. Like everybody else, he was attracted by&#xD;
that gift of pleasing which the young man pos-&#xD;
sessed in such remarkable degree-that happy&#xD;
mingling of courtesy and frankness which came&#xD;
to him by nature, and for which he did not de-&#xD;
serve half as much credit as he obtained. "Exer-&#xD;
cise, fortunately, does not interfere with conver-&#xD;
sation."&#xD;
Annesley was ready enough to take him at&#xD;
his word. A great many people can testify from&#xD;
experience that, when one has an awkward ques-&#xD;
tion to ask, or a disagreeable answer to render,&#xD;
t~ ask the one, or give the other, in the course&#xD;
of pedestrian or any other sort of exercise, is&#xD;
infinitely preferable to a cold-blooded interview&#xD;
face to face, and eye to eye. By this time, Mor-&#xD;
ton began to feel that he was in rather an awk-&#xD;
ward position. After all, what excuse could he&#xD;
give, what right did he have, to be making these&#xD;
inquiries about Miss Tresham? If Father Mar-&#xD;
tin chose to "take him up" sharply, what could&#xD;
he say in self-defence? He had literally no ex-&#xD;
cuse to offer, literally no right to show. Yet he&#xD;
was in for it now; and he cleared his throat, and&#xD;
dashed at the heart of his subject without any&#xD;
preliminary.&#xD;
"I hope you will not be surprised by what I&#xD;
am about to say," he began. "I believe you&#xD;
know Miss Tresham quite well. Are you aware&#xD;
that she has left Tallahoma suddenly and very&#xD;
mysteriously?"&#xD;
"I was told so yesterday," answered the&#xD;
priest, gravely. "If it is of Miss Tresham that&#xD;
you have come to speak, Mr. Annesley, you may&#xD;
rest assured that my attention is at your com-&#xD;
"Your attention I" said Annesley. They&#xD;
had not taken more than half a dozen steps;&#xD;
but he stopped short, and turned round upon&#xD;
the other. "Your attention I" he repeated.&#xD;
Excuse me; but is nothing el~e at icy com-&#xD;
mand? le it-is it possible you do not know&#xD;
where she is?"&#xD;
"Until yesterday evening, I was not even&#xD;
aware that she had left Tallahoma. Of course,'&#xD;
therefore, it is impossible for me to know where&#xD;
she is."&#xD;
"You have not seen her?"&#xD;
"Not since before Christmas."&#xD;
"Yen have not heard from her?"&#xD;
"I have not."&#xD;
Annesley looked helplessly at hhn. lie ilid&#xD;

so sure that Father Martin had seen Katharine,&#xD;
so sure that he knew where she was, that this&#xD;
unexpected obstacle, this barrier of complete&#xD;
Ignorance) seemed all at once to end every&#xD;
thing.&#xD;
"It is no temporary absence. She Is gone-&#xD;
gone for good "he thought, and, thus thinidug,&#xD;
grew so pale that the priest felt sorry for him,&#xD;
and, extending his hand, touched his arm.&#xD;
"Be frank with me, Mr. Annesley," he said,&#xD;
kindly. "Believe me, you can feel no interest in&#xD;
~diss Tresham which I do not share. The news&#xD;
'which I heard yesterday evening," he went on,&#xD;
"cost me a sleepless night. I do not understand&#xD;
the matter, as yet. Will you try to explain?"&#xD;
"There is nothing that can be explained,"&#xD;
said Annesley, looking -very downcast. "Miss&#xD;
Tre~ham has left, nobody knows why, and gone,&#xD;
nobody knows where. That is why I came to&#xD;
yot%, sir. Her friends in Tallahoma are very&#xD;
anxious about her; and I thought you must cer-&#xD;
tainly have seen her, would certainly have known&#xD;
where she went. When she left, the impression&#xD;
with Mr. and Mrs. Marks was that she had come&#xD;
to Sanford to see you."&#xD;
"When did she come?"&#xD;
"This day-no, yesterday, two weeks ago-&#xD;
the second of January."&#xD;
"I told her, when I saw her in December,&#xD;
that I wight be here on the Sunday following&#xD;
that date. Unfortunately, I was prevented from&#xD;
coming. Well, Mr. Annesley, has she not re-&#xD;
turned to Talinhoma since?"&#xD;
"No; she has not returned."&#xD;
"Nor written?"&#xD;
"Not a line."&#xD;
"Indeed!" said Father Martin; and he&#xD;
walked along silently for some time, his hands,&#xD;
which still held the breviary, clasped behind&#xD;
his hack, and his eyes absentlyfastened on the&#xD;
scene outspread before ~ "There is one&#xD;
thing," he said, at last. "Elan Miss Tresham's&#xD;
employers throw no light on her absence? Did&#xD;
she give them no explanation of why she&#xD;
went?"&#xD;
"She did not tell them-that is, she did not&#xD;
tell Mrs. Marks-any thing excepting titat she&#xD;
was going, and that she would be back on the&#xD;
following Monday."&#xD;
Annesley spoke very quietly, for he felt in-&#xD;
tensely depressed and despondent; but he was&#xD;
startled by the expression that came over Father&#xD;
Martin's face at his last words. This time, it&#xD;
was he who stopped short in his walk, and looked&#xD;
&#xD;
with wonder-..it might almost have seemed with&#xD;
alarm-at the other.&#xD;
"Are you sure that she said she would be&#xD;
back on Monday?" he asked.&#xD;
"Yes," answered Morton, with some sur-&#xD;
prise. "She certainly told Mrs. Marks that she'&#xD;
would be back on Monday. I was in the house&#xD;
an hour or two after she left it; and this assur-&#xD;
ance was given to me at the time, and repeated&#xD;
since.&#xD;
"That settles the matter, then, Mr. Annes.&#xD;
ley," said the priest, with decision. ~' If Miss&#xD;
Treshain told Mrs. Marks that she would he&#xD;
back on Monday, you may be sure that she in.&#xD;
tended to return on that day-you may be cer-&#xD;
tain that something which she did not' foresee in&#xD;
leaving Tallahoma has alone prevented her doing&#xD;
so."&#xD;
"But-"&#xD;
"But is it possible you can know Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am, and doubt this?" interrupted the other,&#xD;
looking at him keenly.&#xD;
"I have trusted, I do trust Miss Tiiesham iw~&#xD;
plicitly," said Morton, simply. "1 me that you&#xD;
are right-I see that this assertion of lmrs amply&#xD;
proves that in leaving Tallahoma she left it with&#xD;
the intention of returning. E~i4#~ntly,. however,&#xD;
she changed that intention,!'&#xD;
"Evidently ~he was made to change it."&#xD;
"You mean-"&#xD;
"Stop a moment, Mr. Annesley, before I tell&#xD;
you what I mean. I have answered several of&#xD;
your questions. I shall ask you now to answer&#xD;
one of mine., Suppose we sit down? After all,&#xD;
I believe it is more convenient to be seated when&#xD;
a conversation like this is going on."&#xD;
lie did not~wait forAnnesley to accede to his&#xD;
proposal, but, taking the liberty which social&#xD;
custom grants an older' man, sat down on a&#xD;
bench placed at the end of.the trellir, and mo-&#xD;
tioned the other to a place beslae him.&#xD;
Morton instantly obeyed.&#xD;
The awkwardness of the first meeting was&#xD;
entirely worn off by this time, and his eager-&#xD;
ness had reached such a point that he would&#xD;
probably have stood on his head if Father Mar-&#xD;
tin had made that a condition for gratifying&#xD;
this eagerness. Their position would have en-&#xD;
raptured an artist. The trellis behind them&#xD;
broke the direct beams of the sun without exact-&#xD;
ly shading them, while the beautiful scene, with&#xD;
its purple hills and distant forests, Its shifting&#xD;
shadows and winsome brightness, lay like a pie.&#xD;
ture at their feet. Yet how little either of them&#xD;
heeded it! For all the thoughts they gavel it&#xD;
&#xD;
might have been as desolate as Sahara or&#xD;
bleak as Siberia! And, in the face of this, ~&#xD;
turn round churlishly and cry out upon Natu:&#xD;
that she does not sympathize with us - tha&#xD;
in our moments of brightness, she sometime,&#xD;
weeps; and, in our mourning, often smiles!&#xD;
"Yen know Miss Tresham quite well, 11&#xD;
lieve," said the priest, after a momentary paus&#xD;
"Will you tell me (I do not ask the questic&#xD;
without a reason) if you know the history of h&#xD;
life?'&#xD;
"I&#xD;
she is know nothing of her life, excepting th~&#xD;
a West-indian by birth, and that sh&#xD;
lived 'in England as a governess," Anncsley at&#xD;
swerved.&#xD;
"Have you ever heard her speak of Mr. Si&#xD;
John?"&#xD;
Morton hesitated a moment before replying.&#xD;
"I have never heard her speak of Mr. SI&#xD;
John," he said, at length, "but I met her one&#xD;
when-when she was with him. Circumstance&#xD;
made it necessary that she should introduce us&#xD;
know nothing more than that."&#xD;
"You never asked any thing more?"&#xD;
"If I had felt disposed to do so-which I dk&#xD;
not-whom could I have asked?"&#xD;
"Miss Treshamn herself perhaps."&#xD;
The young man colored suddenly and deeply.&#xD;
"You don't know me, sir," he said. "I can't&#xD;
be offended, therefore, that you should think&#xD;
might have been guilty of such an impertinence.&#xD;
But you do know Miss Tresham. You know&#xD;
whether she is the sort of woman with whom one&#xD;
would be likely to take a liberty."&#xD;
The priest smiled with a genial expression&#xD;
that lit up pleasantly his strong Irish face.&#xD;
"Your punctilio does you no discredit, Mr.&#xD;
Annesley," he said, "but I assure you I made&#xD;
the inquiry without supposing for a moment that&#xD;
you had been guilty of an impertinence, or that&#xD;
Miss Tresham would permit a liberty. I may in-&#xD;
terpret your answer, then, to mean that you are&#xD;
in complete ignorance of every thing about Mr.&#xD;
St. John save the mere fact of his existence."&#xD;
"I could scarcely be ignorant of that," said&#xD;
Annesley, smiling in turn, "since I have been&#xD;
reminded of it very recently. Do you know that&#xD;
he is in Sanford?"&#xD;
"I had~a visit from him yesterday."&#xD;
"And does he know nothing of Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am?"&#xD;
"What he knows,, Mr. Annesley, I am unable&#xD;
to say. What he told me I violate no confidence&#xD;
in telling you. He came to me, as you have&#xD;
done, for information about Miss Tresham."&#xD;
&#xD;
~s     "And you told him.-.?"&#xD;
re "That' I had none to give him. I did not&#xD;
re ask Mr. St. John to walk in the garden," he&#xD;
.t, added, significantly, "and our interview was&#xD;
~s quite brief-confined merely to a business-like&#xD;
,interchange of~question and answer."&#xD;
e-    There was a silence after this.&#xD;
e.    Morton hesitated what to say next, and per.&#xD;
a haps the priest hesitated also. Frankly as they&#xD;
~r had spoken, willing as they were to meet each&#xD;
other's advances, there was a barrier of reserve&#xD;
it still between them-a barrier raised by the igno-&#xD;
e ranee of the one and the knowledge of the other.&#xD;
i-    It was Annesley who, with characteristic&#xD;
impetuosity, dashed straight at this.&#xD;
t "Sir," he said, "there is a great difference&#xD;
between us. I know nothing about Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am's life, and you probably know every thing.&#xD;
Under these circumstances, I should like to ask&#xD;
e one question, and I should be glad If you would&#xD;
s answer it."&#xD;
"I mu sure you will ask nothing that I ought&#xD;
not to answer, Mr. Annesley."&#xD;
"No, I hope not. My question is simply&#xD;
I this Does your knowledge give you any real&#xD;
advantage over my ignorance? Does it enable&#xD;
you to form an idea why Miss Treshara did zwt&#xD;
return to Tallahoma, and where she has gone?"&#xD;
Father Martin thought a moment. The young&#xD;
man had certainly gone straight to the only im-&#xD;
portant point - the only thing that made the&#xD;
difference between them of any moment. After&#xD;
a while he answered:&#xD;
"No, Mr. Annesley, I cannot say that my&#xD;
knowledge enables me to form any clear idea&#xD;
why Miss Tresham did not return to Tallahoma,&#xD;
and it assuredly does not tell me where she has&#xD;
gone. Thus far we stand en equal ground. Of&#xD;
course, I have certain suspicions - but so, I&#xD;
fancy, have you. Can you tell me whether Mr.&#xD;
St. John has been in Tallahoma during the whole&#xD;
of these two weeks?"&#xD;
"He has not left the town for a day until&#xD;
yesterday."&#xD;
"The next thing," said Father Martin, rising&#xD;
to his feet, "is to inquire what Miss Tresham did&#xD;
while she was in Sanford. Fortunately, we have&#xD;
the means of information near at hand. When&#xD;
I arrived here, Mrs. Malone told me that she&#xD;
had been to inquire for me. I asked no ques-&#xD;
tions, and the good woman went into no details.&#xD;
If you will come with me, we will ask some ques-&#xD;
tions now."&#xD;
Annesley rose with alacrity to follow, him.&#xD;
They left their sheltered nook and turned Into&#xD;
&#xD;
170&#xD;
&#xD;
MORTON HOUSE&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="172-173" xml:id="VAC8070-00000092"/>&#xD;
172                      MORTON HOUSE.                                                       LIFE AND DEATH.                    173&#xD;
&#xD;
a walk that led directly to the house; but,&#xD;
before they had gone a dozen yards, they saw a&#xD;
servant opening the gate and advancing with&#xD;
evident haste toward them.&#xD;
"A messenger for me, no doubt," said the&#xD;
priest, resignedly. "The faithful have heard of&#xD;
my arrival."&#xD;
"A messenger who seems to have travelled&#xD;
long and hard," said Annesley. "He is splashed&#xD;
with mud from his hat to his shoes. The roads&#xD;
are not so 'bad either."&#xD;
"Toward the southwest they are. There&#xD;
have been heavy rains between Hartsburg and&#xD;
this place lately, as I found yesterday.-Well,&#xD;
my man, whom are you in search of 1"' he said,&#xD;
turning to the servant.&#xD;
"The priest, if you please, sir," answered&#xD;
the boy, who had reached the two gentlemen by&#xD;
this time and taken off his cap. As he did so,&#xD;
Morton started. To his surprise he recognized&#xD;
a(well.known Tallahoma face-no less a person-&#xD;
age than Mr. Warwick's body-servant.&#xD;
"What, Cyrus!" he exclaimed.&#xD;
"Why, if it ain't Mr. Annesley!" said Cyrus,&#xD;
starting in turn, and staring open-mouthed at the&#xD;
young man.&#xD;
U What are you doing here?" Annesley&#xD;
asked, immediately. "Where is Mr. War-&#xD;
wick?"&#xD;
"Mass John's in Hartsburg, sir," answered&#xD;
Cyrus. "I've just come from there. I rode all&#xD;
night, sir, over awful roads. I never saw sich&#xD;
holes in all my life. You could almost a-put&#xD;
Rattler and me both in one of 'em, and-"&#xD;
~' What on earth were you riding all night&#xD;
for? ~&#xD;
"It was Mass John's orders, sir," said Cyrus,&#xD;
in an important tone. "He told me to git here&#xD;
as fast as I could and give this note "-he pro-&#xD;
duced one frota between the folds of the lining&#xD;
of his cap-" to the Catholic priest in Saxford.&#xD;
If he wasn't here-"&#xD;
"He is here," interrupted Father Martin.&#xD;
"I am the Catholic priest. If the note is for&#xD;
me,~ give it to me at once, my good boy."&#xD;
Cyrus delivered up the note immediately, and,&#xD;
after one hasty glance at the address, the priest&#xD;
broke the seal and unfolded it. Morton, watch-&#xD;
ing hi~ face as he read, saw that he paled sud-&#xD;
denly and strangely over the very first lines. He&#xD;
did not raise his eyes, however, not even after&#xD;
the young man felt sure that he had finished the&#xD;
letter. In fact, he was silent so long that at last&#xD;
hu~atienee got the better of civility, and Annes~&#xD;
ley spoke himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Pardon me, sir, but is there any news about&#xD;
-about the person of whom we have been talk.&#xD;
ing?"&#xD;
Father Martin started and looked up-with&#xD;
reluctance, it was evident.&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Annesley," he said, " there is news&#xD;
-very painful news, I am grieved to say. In a&#xD;
few words," he, went on hastily, as he saw the&#xD;
young man change color, "Miss Tresham is very&#xD;
ill, and I am summoned to her. Here is Mr.&#xD;
Warwick's note."&#xD;
He extended the sheet of paper, and Annes-&#xD;
Icy took it without a word. This was what Mr.&#xD;
Warwick said:&#xD;
"EAGLE HOTEL, HART5BUEG,&#xD;
"Six o'ckrck r. ar., Friday, January 16t/~.&#xD;
"Ray. Mr. MARTIN&#xD;
"DEAR Sin: Yesterday afternoon I chanced&#xD;
to reach this place, and, to my surprise, found&#xD;
Miss Tresham (lately teaching in my brother-in-&#xD;
law's family in Tallahoma) lying dangerously ill&#xD;
here. Why or how she came here I do not&#xD;
know, for she had lost consciousness before ~I&#xD;
saw her; but since she is in a violent brain-&#xD;
fever, which leaves scarcely a hope of her life,&#xD;
the doctor urges me to communicate with her&#xD;
friends, and I therefore venture to address your-&#xD;
self. You arc the only person who, in an emer-&#xD;
gency like the present, can possibly be able to&#xD;
say what she would or would not wish to be&#xD;
done-what steps taken, who informed of her&#xD;
condition. May I hope that you will come to&#xD;
Hartsburg at once? I shall send this by a mes-&#xD;
senger who will ride all night.&#xD;
"Very respectfully,&#xD;
"JOHN WARwIcK."&#xD;
"P. 5.-i have just seen the doctor, who&#xD;
thinks there is no hope. I ought to add, per-&#xD;
haps, that I should have written to you yester-&#xD;
day, if I had thought of it, J3ut, in running&#xD;
over the list of Miss Tresham's friends, your&#xD;
name only suggested itself to me a few minutes&#xD;
ago. Once more, I hope you will lose no time in&#xD;
coming."&#xD;
That was all. The letter-so cold, so reti-&#xD;
cent, so full of bare details, so utterly chilling to&#xD;
every thought of hope-fell from Morton's hand&#xD;
unheeded. Dying 1 That wss the only sound&#xD;
he heard; the only thought left in his brain.&#xD;
Dying! A black mist seemed creeping over&#xD;
every thing round him; the very air seemed a&#xD;
knell that repeated the word. Dying I Youth,&#xD;
&#xD;
health, strength, all had been hers when he sa~&#xD;
her last; and now-&#xD;
It was Father Martin's hand that touched him&#xD;
and Father Martin's voice that roused him fron&#xD;
his trance of despair.&#xD;
"There is nothing in that letter which IICC(&#xD;
affect you like this, Mr. Annesley," he said&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick is a fallible man, and so is th4&#xD;
doctor on whose authority he speaks. Manj&#xD;
doctors have said that there is no hope, anc&#xD;
lived to learn that while there is life there ii&#xD;
always hope. Will you do something to heli&#xD;
me on my way to Hartsburg?"&#xD;
"I will do any thing," said Annesley, speak&#xD;
ing like a man who had been stunned. "Whal&#xD;
do you want?"&#xD;
"I want a horse, if you will be kind enough to&#xD;
go up the street and engage one for mc. I would&#xD;
not trouble you, only my own is broken down&#xD;
from yesterday's journey, and is1quite unequal to&#xD;
such a ride as the one before me."&#xD;
"Engage a horse!" repeated Anuesley, as&#xD;
if the sound of the other's speech had only&#xD;
dimly reached him. Then he suddenly caught a&#xD;
gleam of his usual intelligence. "That is quite&#xD;
unnecessary," he said. "My own horses are at&#xD;
t e hote ,and are quite fresh. .Ifyou will let me&#xD;
drive you "&#xD;
"Do you think that I am not going?" asked&#xD;
the young man, passionately. "If you don't go&#xD;
with me, I shall go alone-so it is all the same.&#xD;
No power short of death could keep me from&#xD;
her. I have stayed too long already. This is&#xD;
the end of all my scruples and doubts," he added,&#xD;
bitterly. "She is dying!"&#xD;
"She is said to be dying," corrected Father&#xD;
Martin, obstinately. "I will believe that she is&#xD;
dying when I see her in the article of death-not&#xD;
before. If you intend to accompany me-or to&#xD;
allow me to accompany you-will you let me&#xD;
suggest that you order your horses at once?'~&#xD;
"I will be here in ten minutes," Annesley&#xD;
answered. He turned to go, caught sight of&#xD;
Cyrus, who stood by, Inwardly astonished, but&#xD;
outwardly stolid- and paused. "Cyrus," he&#xD;
raid, wistfully, "did you hear anybody say what&#xD;
the chances were for Miss Tresham's recov-&#xD;
ery?"&#xD;
Cyrus looked down at his muddy shoes. In-&#xD;
stinct made even him pause before telling the&#xD;
truth.&#xD;
"I heard the folks in the hotel a-talking, sir,"&#xD;
lie said~ "They thought she was mighty bad&#xD;
off."&#xD;
12&#xD;
&#xD;
v     "Did you hear any of them say that they&#xD;
thought she might get well ?"&#xD;
Cyrus slowly shook his head. "No, sir.&#xD;
i They all said she' was bound to die. I heard&#xD;
Dr. Randolph a-telling Mass John so, just before&#xD;
i I left."&#xD;
"The horses, Mr. Annesley," said Father&#xD;
Martin, anxiously.&#xD;
"I am going," answered Annesley-and this&#xD;
I time he did go. He left the sunny garden and&#xD;
its bright, beautiful prospect, without even so&#xD;
much as a glance; yet it was long before the&#xD;
scene of that awful blow passed from his mem-&#xD;
- ory-long before he forgot one outline of the&#xD;
purple hills, one gleam of the golden sunshine, or&#xD;
one throb of the sickening pain. As he went his&#xD;
I way to the hotel, one cry seemed to ring through&#xD;
his heart-the same bitter cry that had been&#xD;
wrung from him unconsciously so short a time&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"This is the end of all my scruples and&#xD;
doubts. She is dying!"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
LIFE AND DE4TU.&#xD;
"Is she alive?"&#xD;
This was the question which Father Martin&#xD;
and Annesley asked simultaneously, as the ex-&#xD;
hausted horses drew up before the door of the&#xD;
Eagle Hotel, and Mr. Crump came forward to&#xD;
receive them.&#xD;
"She's alive, gentlemen- that's all I can&#xD;
say," the landlord answered, for he knew at&#xD;
onee to whom they alluded. "You're the&#xD;
Catholic priest, I suppose, sir," he went on,&#xD;
addressing Father Martin. "Mr. Warwick told&#xD;
me to be sure and ask you to walk up-stairs as&#xD;
soon as you come. - The other gentlemau-"&#xD;
He stopped, and looked at Annesley. His man-&#xD;
ner said that there had been no directions about&#xD;
the other gentleman.&#xD;
"I'll walk up-stairs also," said Anneslcy&#xD;
springing to the ground, and throwing his reins&#xD;
to a boy standing near. As he was turning away,&#xD;
he suddenly recollected that he had driven his&#xD;
horses very hard, and he paused to say, "Attend&#xD;
to these animals very carefully, if you please.&#xD;
Rub them down well, and let them stand half an&#xD;
hour before feeding them. My servant will be&#xD;
on in the course of an hour or two." Then,&#xD;
to the landlord, "Now show us tba way up-&#xD;
stairs."&#xD;

Mr. Crump was quite impressed by the ter," said Morton, hurriedly.-" Where is War.&#xD;

i lately conceived the idea that it was a dis- "In his own room, I think. He was in Miss&#xD;
ised princess who had been lying ill at his Tresham's room a little while ago; but he went&#xD;

a handsome young gentleman, whose horses Crump; and Father Martin followed him down&#xD;
ne showed that he was a person of impor- the passage.&#xD;
tee, sprung to the ground, and, with a pale Morton, however, stood his ground. Despite&#xD;
e and a manner which agitation robbed some. his inquiry, he had not come to see Warwick,&#xD;
at of its usual courtesy, said, quickly, "Show but to see Katharine, and he thought that his&#xD;
tht way upstairss" best means of compassing the latter point 'was&#xD;
"Certainly, sir," said Mr. Crump, with alac- through Miss Lester.&#xD;
r. Then, to a servant standing near, "Take "Why don't you go too?" asked she, in&#xD;
those valises, and bring them in.-This way, her straightforward fashion. "If you want to&#xD;
ttlemen." hear about Miss Tresham, Mr. Warwick can tell&#xD;
He led the way into the house and up the you a great deal more than I can. He knows&#xD;
ircase-talking, as he went. "The doctor every thing that the doctor says, while, for my&#xD;
only a little while ago, air. They think the part, I am at dagger's-drawing with him. I&#xD;
y won't live through the night, I believe, told him to his face that he wasn't worth calling&#xD;
wife hardly leaves her at all, and Mrs. Ran- a doctor if he could not save her life, and he&#xD;
ph set up night before last. Last night, two told me that I did not know what I was talking&#xD;
lea arrived at the house, and they've been about. So you see I am not the person to come&#xD;
ying here all day to help about nursing her, to for Dr. Randolph's opinion."&#xD;
of them is Miss "                          "It is not~Dr. Randolph's opinion I want,"&#xD;
The opening and shutting of a door on the said Annesley. "I have heard quite enough of&#xD;
er floor, and the rustling of a woman's skirts that. I want to see Miss Tresham, Miss Maggie;&#xD;
ng the passage, stopped his flow of words, and I hope you will let me do it."&#xD;
bre anybody could speak, Miss Lester ap. "You want to see Miss Tresham?" repeated&#xD;
red at the head of the stairs, and faced the Miss Lester, in amazement. "Why, Mr. Annes.&#xD;
ranging party. Icy, are you crazy? Don't you know she is so&#xD;
"Has the priest come yet, Mr. Crump?" ill that she would not know her own mother, if&#xD;
asked, in her quick, clear tones. Then she her mother came? And yet you talk of seeing&#xD;
Idenly caught sight of Morton in the rear her! Of course, you can't see her; nobody can,&#xD;
Mr, Crump's portly figure, and smothered a except the people who are nursing her."&#xD;
cam. "Goodness! Is it Mr. Annesley?" "But, Miss Maggie-"&#xD;
cried.                              *      "You really can't, Mr. Annesley; and that is&#xD;
"Yes, it is I, Miss Maggie," said Morton, the end of the matter."&#xD;
saing forward. "How is she? Pray tell me "Not quite the end, I hope," said Annesley.&#xD;
v she is!" "If you are determined against me, I must ask&#xD;
"She's as rn as she can be," answered Miss the doctor, He won't refuse, I am sure."&#xD;
~ter, with a little catch in her voice that "He would refuse if you were her own broth-&#xD;
nd~I almost like a sob. "But I don't give er," returned Miss Lester. "I-I never heard&#xD;
hope, Mr Annesley; and I don't mean to, such a thing in all my life! If it wasn't yo~j&#xD;
~er, I know how doctors talk; I have heard Mr. Annesley, I really think I should be veil&#xD;
many of them," said the young lady, almost angry. What possible right have you to see&#xD;
cely. "Dr. Randolph isn't a bit better than Miss Tresham?" she demanded, in a tone that&#xD;
of the rest. No hope, indeed! What's th~ provoked Annesley to a retort.&#xD;
ul of being 'a doctor, if he can't cure people "As much right as John Warwick, I sup-&#xD;
en they've got brain-fever as well as when pose," he said. "He has been admitted without&#xD;
y ye got chills. Oh, me, if I was a doctor! any difficulty, I believe."&#xD;
that the priest, Mr. Annesley?"             "There is a great difference between you and&#xD;
"This is the priest.-Mr. Martin, Miss Les- Mr. Warwick," said Xiss Lester, severely. "It&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
seems to me you might see it. He is an old&#xD;
man" (the speaker was eighteen), "quite old&#xD;
enough to be Miss Tresham's father; and, be-&#xD;
sides, he found her, and sent away her doctor,&#xD;
and got another one, and all that sort of thing.&#xD;
She would be dead by this time, if it had not&#xD;
boon thr Mr. Wmwink. lInt yun.-.ik. Aiinee.&#xD;
ley, I am astonished at you! If Miss Tresham&#xD;
had been ill at home in a private house? you&#xD;
would never have dreamed of making such a re-&#xD;
quest as this."&#xD;
"You are wrong; you do me great injus-&#xD;
tice;" said Morton, quickly. "I would have&#xD;
made it all the same, under any circumstances.&#xD;
Miss Lester, you won't refuse me-I am sure you&#xD;
won't-if you only stop and consider a minute."&#xD;
"I might consider a hundred minutes, Mr.&#xD;
Annesrey, and nothing would come of it. Be-&#xD;
sides, I am not the sick-room authority. Oh,&#xD;
dear, no! There is Mrs. Randolph. You would&#xD;
have to get her permission after you had mine."&#xD;
"Please go and ask her to come here, then.&#xD;
Any thing is better than wasting time like&#xD;
this."&#xD;
Even at that hour, feminine vanity was not&#xD;
quite extinguished in the youthful feminine&#xD;
breast. Miss Lester shot a keen little shaft&#xD;
out of her brown eyes, and made a smart little&#xD;
courtesy. "Thank you for such a nice compli-&#xD;
meat, Mr Annesley," she said, and, having said&#xD;
it, hurried away.&#xD;
In a few minutes Mrs. Randolph came out of&#xD;
the sick-room, and walked up to the young man.&#xD;
Strange to say, he found her much more dis-&#xD;
posed than Miss Lester had been to listen kindly&#xD;
to his petition. She read his whole story so&#xD;
plainly, and she had so entirely given up all&#xD;
hope of Katharine's life, that the grim shadow&#xD;
of propriety almost ceased to terrify her, almost&#xD;
seemed to recede into nothingness, by the side&#xD;
of those two phantom-shapes-Life and Death-&#xD;
which had met in their last awful duel. She&#xD;
listened, softened, and, even while she expostu-&#xD;
lated, seemed half inclined to yield.&#xD;
"What good would it do?" she asked.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham is quite unconscious. You could&#xD;
not rouse her; you could not speak to her; you&#xD;
could only look at her."&#xD;
"That would be enough," said Morton, im-&#xD;
ploringly. "Only let me look at her-that is all&#xD;
I ask. Dear madam, don't refuse me! Think&#xD;
-only think-that, if you do, I may never see&#xD;
her again in ~&#xD;
His tone of unconscious pathos brought tears&#xD;
to Mrs. Randolph's eyes. She stopped, thought&#xD;
&#xD;
a moment, hesitated, and seemed about to yield,&#xD;
when a step sounded on the stairs.&#xD;
"There is my husband now," said she, with&#xD;
an expression of relief~ "I am so glad I It is&#xD;
quite impossible for me to decide such a matter&#xD;
as this; and he will be able to say exactly what&#xD;
is right to do. I am so glad he is cotning I" she&#xD;
repeated, as the staircase creaked loudly under&#xD;
the weight of her lord, and the top, of his tall&#xD;
hat came in sight round the curve.&#xD;
For his part, the doctor was quite astonished&#xD;
when he looked up and saw his wife in close con.&#xD;
sultation with a handsome young stranger at the&#xD;
head of the stairs. He had left her in chief&#xD;
charge of his patient; and, knowing that she was&#xD;
the most vigilant of nurses, he found it hard to&#xD;
account for this seeming forgetfulness of duty.&#xD;
"What the deuce-" he began asking himself,&#xD;
when he caught a better view of the stranger,&#xD;
and recognized Mr. Annesley, of Lagrange. He&#xD;
knew him slightly, and they were soon shaking&#xD;
hands. Then the petition was referred to the&#xD;
doctor by the doctor's wife.&#xD;
"Mr. Annesley is just from Tallahoma, from&#xD;
Miss Tresham's friends," said this diplomatic&#xD;
woman. "He is very anxious to see Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am, and-and I hardly knew what to say to him.&#xD;
You have come just in time to take the responsi-&#xD;
bility off my hands. You can tell him all about&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"There is only one thing I want to be told,"&#xD;
said Annesley, a little brusquely, "that is,&#xD;
whether or not I can see Miss Tresham. Surely&#xD;
there is no harm in it," said he, addressing&#xD;
Mrs. Randolph. "Surely it can't injure her,"&#xD;
he said, addressing the doctor. Then throwing&#xD;
all his eloquence into an appeal to both, "Only&#xD;
a few minutes! I am not unreasonable, and I&#xD;
won't ask any thing more."&#xD;
"It is neither of my wife nor of myself that&#xD;
you should ask that much, Mr. Annesley," said&#xD;
the doctor, gravely. "Miss Tresham was placed&#xD;
under my care by Mr. Warwick. It is to Mr.&#xD;
Warwick, therefore, that you must apply for&#xD;
permission to see her. I can only say as a med-&#xD;
ical man whether or not such a visit would injure&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"And may I ask what you do say?"&#xD;
"~fhat the visits of a hundred people could&#xD;
have no possible ill effect upon her now. Her&#xD;
disease has today passed from violent delirium&#xD;
to its second and more dangerous stage-that&#xD;
of stupor, which is deepening gradually into the&#xD;
insensibility that precedes death."&#xD;
Annesley shrank. Alas! who does not shrink&#xD;
&#xD;

wheu that terrible word is spoken with the cold,&#xD;
calm deliberation of scientific certainty in regard&#xD;
to some life to save which we would freely tell&#xD;
out our blood, drop by drop-for which we would&#xD;
give the very throbs of our heart, the very hours&#xD;
that come to us filled to the brim with the keen,&#xD;
fresh elixir of vitality, the very powers of health,&#xD;
and strength, and possible enjoyment, that mock&#xD;
us so bitterly at such a time!&#xD;
"Doctor," said he, huskily, "is there no&#xD;
hope?"&#xD;
Other people had asked the doctor this ques-&#xD;
tion, and to each of them he had given that&#xD;
decided answer which had so roused' Miss Les-&#xD;
ter's scorn. In the name of every symptom of&#xD;
the ease, of every teaching of experience, of&#xD;
every data of medical knowledge, he had re-&#xD;
plied, "No hope."&#xD;
Now, for the first time, he hesitated. Now,&#xD;
for the first time, he felt inclined to rack his&#xD;
brain for something of a temporizing, it might&#xD;
even be of a consoling nature, felt inclined to&#xD;
evade the direct answer, as he often evaded it&#xD;
when people came to him with the extreme of&#xD;
love and anguish quivering in their voices to ask&#xD;
this same question, "Doctor, is there no hope?"&#xD;
"I might answer that, while there is life,&#xD;
there is always hope, Mr. Annesley," he said,&#xD;
"but thpt is a mere generality which means&#xD;
nothing. If you want my honest opinion of&#xD;
this particular case, I can give it to you. Every&#xD;
symptom up to this point has been unfavorable.&#xD;
The disease has not yielded an inch to the reme-&#xD;
dies employed, but seems to be advancing stead-&#xD;
ily to a fatal termination. $o far I have not seen&#xD;
a single sign which encourages me to hope that&#xD;
the patient may rally. Yet, as a medical man, I&#xD;
cannot say that such rallying would be impossi-&#xD;
ble. In the first place, recoveries take place&#xD;
more frequently from meningitis occurring as an&#xD;
attendant upon other diseases than when the com-&#xD;
plaint is original. Miss Tresham's disorder i4&#xD;
secondary meningitis. That, therefore, is our first&#xD;
ground for hope-slender though it be. In the&#xD;
second place, the disease has three stages: vio-&#xD;
lent exdlteinent, first, when it can almost always&#xD;
be easily arrested; stupor next, when the chances&#xD;
of safety are very much diminished; and, lastly,&#xD;
coma, or profound unconsciousness, which pre-&#xD;
cedes 'and gradually sinks into death. Recovery&#xD;
from thislast state is so unusual that it' is hardly&#xD;
possible to count upon it. Nevertheless, in rare&#xD;
instances, it does occur-or rather the tottil&#xD;
prostration which sometimes follows the cure of&#xD;
violent inflammation, simulates the symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
that mark the closing stage of the worst cases.&#xD;
This is our second ground for hope. Slight as it&#xD;
is, I shall act upon it. I shall resort to stimu-&#xD;
lants. If the symptoms are organic, they can do&#xD;
no harm, for death must necessarily take place;&#xD;
if merely functional, they may be the means of&#xD;
saving her life."&#xD;
"And if your worst fears are realized-if the&#xD;
last stage is really here?"&#xD;
"In that ease to-night decides every thing-&#xD;
death must ensue before morning."&#xD;
"And if she lives through the night?"&#xD;
"Let us wait until the night is past, before&#xD;
we ask that question," said the doctor, almost&#xD;
solemnly. "Now I must go. If you wish to&#xD;
see my patient, Mr. Annesley, 17 can only refer&#xD;
you to Mr. Warwick."&#xD;
He made a short little bow and went away,&#xD;
followed by his wife. As for Annesley, he stood&#xD;
still and watched' them with a feeling of blank&#xD;
hopelessness impossible to describe. To-night!&#xD;
He had said that to-night would decide every&#xD;
thing! Involuntarily the young man looked out&#xD;
of a window near which he stood, and shivered.&#xD;
The shades of. evening were falling. The sun&#xD;
was gone, the gray mantle of twilight was en-&#xD;
wrapping every thing, a lovely crescent moon&#xD;
was cradled softly over the fringing western&#xD;
clouds, while faint and more faint the burning&#xD;
glow of sunset was fading from the sky. To-&#xD;
night! And night was coming-night was here!&#xD;
It could not be, he cried out, fiercely yet vainly&#xD;
-ah, how vainly! The darkness seemed like&#xD;
some horrible monster advancing with slow,&#xD;
stealthy steps to do its horrible work; to seize&#xD;
its passive victim from those strong arms of&#xD;
helpless, outstretched agony; to bear away the&#xD;
grace, the beauty, the glory of life, under its&#xD;
sombre pall, and leave only a cold white shadow&#xD;
of mortality to meet the gaze of the suu when he&#xD;
came once more in pomp and splendor from his&#xD;
royal couch. 0 fall of night 1 0 long hours of&#xD;
darkness! How terrible ye are to watchers like&#xD;
these, to those who cry, "If she can but live&#xD;
through to-night!" The awful death of light.-&#xD;
awful sometimes to the shrinking soi4 when&#xD;
there is no cause like this to dread it-seems&#xD;
at such times invested with a horror nil its own.&#xD;
When morning comes-nh, morning! Will she&#xD;
ever see it?"&#xD;
"Can you show me Mr. Warwick's room?"&#xD;
said Annesley to a servant passing by.&#xD;
"Number thirteen-right down the passage,&#xD;
sir," answered the man, hastily. "You' can't&#xD;
miss the door."&#xD;
&#xD;
"'I&#xD;
&#xD;
To number thirteen, right down the passage,&#xD;
Annesley accordingly took his way, and soon&#xD;
round that, indeed, it would have been impos-&#xD;
sible for him to miss the door, especially as it&#xD;
was standing open and Father Martin was in the&#xD;
act of coming out.&#xD;
"It is really impossible for me to advise you,&#xD;
Mr. Warwick," he was saying. "You must act&#xD;
according to your own judgment in the mat-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
"That is harder than you think," Mr. War-&#xD;
wick replied.&#xD;
And just then Annesley appeared.&#xD;
Father Martin, who was looking very pale&#xD;
and grave, nodded to the young man, and walked&#xD;
slowly away, while Mr. Warwick extended his&#xD;
hand cordially.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, Morton," he saW.&#xD;
"I heard that you were in the house, and I was&#xD;
just coming in search of you. I suppose you&#xD;
have seen Randolph, and there iS nothing for&#xD;
me to tell you."&#xD;
"I saw him a moment ago," Morton answered.&#xD;
"He has spoken very plainly. He says that every&#xD;
thing depends on to-night, and that the chances&#xD;
are all against life."&#xD;
"I suppose you have heard how I found&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
"No, not yet."&#xD;
The lawyer told him in a few brief words,&#xD;
adding: "It is quite useless to make wishes with&#xD;
regard to what is past; but, if I had reached&#xD;
here a day earlier, all this might have been&#xD;
spared. The treatment of an infamous quack&#xD;
brought on the disease of which she is dying;&#xD;
and, if Randolph had seen her twelve-nay, six'&#xD;
-hours earlier-but this is folly. You heard&#xD;
the news in Saxford, the priest tells me."&#xD;
"I was with him when he received your note.&#xD;
I had gone there to try and find out something&#xD;
about her. I "-he paused involuntarily. Men&#xD;
do not readily speak to each other with regard to&#xD;
matters of sentiment or feeling, do not easily con-&#xD;
quer the strong reluctance to show the soft ker-&#xD;
nel of their natures, instead of putting forward&#xD;
the harder rind which characterizes them in every&#xD;
degree and condition of life. Even when cir-&#xD;
cumstances force them t~ this expression, they&#xD;
give it with a hesitation which shows how much&#xD;
it goes against the grain. It certainly went&#xD;
against the grain with Morton now. According&#xD;
to his own desire, he would not have made a con-&#xD;
fidant of anybody; but to make a conzjdant of&#xD;
John Warwick-the irony of events could not go&#xD;
any farther, he thought. Still, he must speak&#xD;
&#xD;

*D DEATH.                               177&#xD;
plainly, if he wished to see Katharine: and&#xD;
plainly, therefore, he proeceiled to speak-.&#xD;
"Perhaps I don't need to tell you, Mr. War-&#xD;
wick, that I have loved Miss Tresham for a long&#xD;
time," he said. "That love is my excuse for&#xD;
coming here, and for asking your permission to&#xD;
see her-since chance and your own kindness&#xD;
have placed her under your care. I can scarcely&#xD;
hope to interest you by speaking of my own feel-&#xD;
ings," he went on hastily-" but her death would&#xD;
be to me a terrible grief."&#xD;
"I am sure of it," ~aid the lawyer, with kind&#xD;
gravity. "You are right in conjecturing that 1&#xD;
was aware of your love for Miss Treshana," he&#xD;
went on; "I have observed it, and I can under-&#xD;
stand that it brought you here, and that it makes&#xD;
you anxious to see her, now that you are here.&#xD;
But, of course, you have been told that she is&#xD;
insensible. It seems to me it would be more&#xD;
painful than gratifying to you to see her in that&#xD;
state."&#xD;
"All I ask is to see her," said Morton. "The&#xD;
doctor says it could do no harm-but he referred&#xD;
mc to you for permission."&#xD;
"To me! I-stop a minute-let me think,~~&#xD;
said Mr. Warwick, in reply. He rose and walked&#xD;
to the window, where he stood gazing, as Annes-&#xD;
icy had done, on the gathering twilight and fall-&#xD;
ing night. Objects were indistinct by this time,&#xD;
and his tall, dark figure was little more than an&#xD;
outline to Morton, who sat quite still beside the&#xD;
fire. After a while he came back, and, standing&#xD;
on the hearth, addressed the young man.&#xD;
"I have been thinking of your request," he&#xD;
said, "and I have decided that it is you, not I,&#xD;
who can tell best whether or not I ought to aq..&#xD;
cede to it. Your own love for Miss Tresham is&#xD;
no reason why you should be allowed to see her.&#xD;
The only thing that would give you that right&#xD;
would be her love for you; and, consequently,&#xD;
her assumed consent. Understand this, and say&#xD;
yourself whether or not you shall see her."&#xD;
Morton was startled. "Mr. Warwick, you&#xD;
place me in a hard position," he said.&#xD;
"The decision rests with yourself," repeated&#xD;
Mr. Warwick; and, having said this, he turned&#xD;
and went back to the window.&#xD;
Annesley sat and thought. For a short time&#xD;
he was quite puzzled, but at length he began to&#xD;
understand Mr. Warwick's meaning, and to ap-&#xD;
preciate the bearing of the question which had&#xD;
been thus unexpectedly thrust upon hire, It was&#xD;
a strange position, certainly. To decide, at the&#xD;
bidding of another man, whether th~ woman he&#xD;
loved, loved him in return; to count 'ovei~ her&#xD;

LIFE AND DEATH.                    179&#xD;
&#xD;
178                       MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
words, and looks, and intangible shades of tone,&#xD;
and to reckon if all these proofs went for or&#xD;
against his cause. At any other time, or for any&#xD;
other reason, nobody would have been quicker&#xD;
than Morton to call himself a miserable puppy&#xD;
for doing such a thing as this; but now it was&#xD;
imperative to arrive at some conclusion-it was&#xD;
the only hope, the only condition, of seeing her.&#xD;
Honestly, then, and with a strange, wistful lean-&#xD;
ing toward his own side, as far removed from&#xD;
vanity as one thing could possibly be removed&#xD;
from another, he went over the ground, faith-&#xD;
fully summed up all the evidence, and, at last&#xD;
made his decision. Then he rose and crossed&#xD;
the floor to Mr. Warwick, who had waited pa-&#xD;
tiently at the window.&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick, I think you will agree with&#xD;
me that this is not a time for false delicacy," he&#xD;
said, with quiet simplicity. "You have put me&#xD;
on my honor to speak the truth: forgive me if&#xD;
what I believe to be the truth sounds like van.&#xD;
ity or unpardonable presumption. I have asked&#xD;
myself honestly if I think Miss Tresham would&#xD;
marry me, and, honestly also, I have answered,&#xD;
'I think she would."~&#xD;
"That is enough," said Mr. Warwick, turn-&#xD;
ing, and, a good deal to Morton's surprise, offer-&#xD;
ing his hand. "Yes, I agree with you that this is&#xD;
no time for false delicacy. Your candor does you&#xD;
more credit than any mock modesty would. 1&#xD;
left the question to yourself; but, since you have&#xD;
expressed your opinion, I will tell you that it is&#xD;
mine also. Miss Tresham is not a woman to&#xD;
wear her heart on her sleeve; but, I think if you&#xD;
had asked her to marry you, she would have said&#xD;
'yes.' You have my best wishes that she may&#xD;
say it yet," ho added, smiling gravely. "Now&#xD;
we will go to her room."&#xD;
"You will find Miss Vernon here," Mr. War-&#xD;
wick went on, as they walked down the passage&#xD;
together. "She and Miss Lester arrived at the&#xD;
hotel yesterday, and, finding Miss Tresham ill,&#xD;
they remained. They are both very kind; and&#xD;
Miss Vernon, in particular, has proved herself a&#xD;
most excellent and capable nurse. This is the&#xD;
room."&#xD;
He stopped Annesley, who was passing on,&#xD;
and tapped lightly at the door before which he&#xD;
paused. It was opened by Mrs. Randolph, who&#xD;
at once admitted 14m, She smiled when she&#xD;
saw Morton, but said nothing; and, leaving them&#xD;
to close the door, went back softly to the bed.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick passed in first, and Annesley&#xD;
followed. There was nothing repulsive, nothing&#xD;
&#xD;
suggestive of pain, or struggle, or death, in the'&#xD;
scene before him. On the contrary, every thing&#xD;
was very quiet and peaceful. A sick-room, un-&#xD;
doubtedly, but hardly a death-chamber, one would&#xD;
have thought, looking at the exquisite neatness&#xD;
of all the arrangements, at the white bed with its&#xD;
recumbent figure, at the shaded light, the soft,&#xD;
pretty glow of the fire, the figures sitting or&#xD;
standing here and there. Every thing was very&#xD;
subdued. If they had spoken in tones of thun-&#xD;
der, they could not have roused that motionless&#xD;
sleeper, or raised those heavy lids; but, none the&#xD;
less, an unconscious impulse made them tread&#xD;
softly and speak low. Around tl~ bed two or&#xD;
three were grouped. Father Martin, with his&#xD;
hands clasped behind his back, stood just before&#xD;
Annesley, as the latter approached. When a&#xD;
touch made him draw aside, the young man&#xD;
looked down on the face he had come to see.&#xD;
A motionless face, out of which the burning&#xD;
fever flush had faded long since, a face that was&#xD;
almost as white as the pillows on which it rested,&#xD;
that was sunken in the lines a little, and bore&#xD;
on its serene features something of a shade of&#xD;
the awful change that was to come. To-night!&#xD;
Did they say she would die to-night? Morton&#xD;
could realize it, now that he had seen her. Fair,&#xD;
and gentle, and robbed of all terror, as that&#xD;
quiet sleep looked, it was not so fair and gentle&#xD;
but that it shoWed the deadly meaning under-&#xD;
neath. It was too still, it was too full of unchan-&#xD;
ging repose. The longer he looked, the more he&#xD;
felt inclined to doubt whether, indeed, it was&#xD;
life or death on which he gazed. At last he&#xD;
could look no longer. With a gasp he raised&#xD;
his eyes, and met the gaze of another pair of&#xD;
eyes on the opposite side of the bed-eyes whose&#xD;
beauty he had known long~ but whose tenderness&#xD;
he never appreciated until he saw them now&#xD;
shining like stars upon him from Irene Vernon's&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"How is her pulse?" he heard Mr. Warwick&#xD;
ask the doctor, who came forward and bent over&#xD;
the patient.&#xD;
"Feeble and thread-like - apparently fail.&#xD;
ing," was the reply. "There is nothing for it&#xD;
but to push the stimulants. I have very little&#xD;
hope in them; but, at least, they can do no&#xD;
harm; while, as it is, she is sinking rapidly."&#xD;
They went oii speaking, but Annesley moved&#xD;
away. This was so different from any thing he&#xD;
had anticipated, that he was obliged to go to the&#xD;
other side of the room to steady himself. They&#xD;
had all warned him that it would be so, but,&#xD;
nevertheless, he had fancied something very dif.&#xD;
&#xD;
ferent-something like a scene in a book, some-&#xD;
thing that would sweeten all the rest of life with&#xD;
a taste of love's divine elixir. But this! To see&#xD;
her pass from him like this, lapsing from earth's&#xD;
sleep to the deeper sleep of death, without one&#xD;
gleam of consciousness, one parting glance, one&#xD;
farewell word-surely, this was hard! He had&#xD;
set aside all the obstacles, and traversed all the&#xD;
space that divided them; he had won his point,&#xD;
and was here in the same room with her; yet&#xD;
what were those other barriers to that which sep-&#xD;
arated them now? Ah, love can do wonders! it&#xD;
can break through prison-bolts, it can climb&#xD;
mountains, it can cross oceans; but it has never&#xD;
yet been able to send one single tone into the&#xD;
ear that death has dulled, to win one single&#xD;
glance from the eyes that death has closed.&#xD;
After a while Miss Vernon came up to him,&#xD;
and held out her hand. "Don't despair, Mr. An-&#xD;
nesley 1 She is very, very ill; but I think the&#xD;
doctor has not quite given up hope," she said,&#xD;
gently.&#xD;
"She is dying!" answered Morton. He ap-&#xD;
preciated it now, and the realization of the in-&#xD;
evitable brought a sort of stunned quietude with&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"I am not sure of that," said Miss Vernon,&#xD;
quickly. "I have seen a great deal of sickness&#xD;
in my life, and seen people who were desperately&#xD;
-so desperately-ill, sometimes recover, that I&#xD;
cannot despair of anybody. Besides-you may&#xD;
be surprised to hear this, Mr. Annesley-but&#xD;
Miss Tresham does not look to me like a dying&#xD;
person. And, what is more, Mrs. Randolph-&#xD;
whose experience is, of course, greater than mine&#xD;
-says the same thing."&#xD;
"~on't try to give me hope, Miss Vernon,"&#xD;
he said, with a faint smile. "Think how terri-&#xD;
ble it will be to-morrow."&#xD;
"But you need some hope. I see that you&#xD;
have given up to despair."&#xD;
"I was madly full of hope until I saw her.&#xD;
After that, I should be blind not to perceive&#xD;
that the doctor is right - that there is no&#xD;
hope."&#xD;
He turned away, and, leaving her abruptly,&#xD;
went to a window near at hand. The solemn&#xD;
curtain of night met his gaze-a deep, dark&#xD;
shadow lay over all things, shadow hardly lighted&#xD;
by the faint, tender radiance of the young moon,&#xD;
or the steady glory of a myriad stars. It had&#xD;
come, it was here, that fateful time of darkness&#xD;
in which Life and Death would fight their last&#xD;
battle!&#xD;
rresently Miss Lester accosted him. "Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Annesley, you have had nothing to eat. Come&#xD;
-with me, and I will take you down-stairs and&#xD;
ask Mrs. Crump to give you so~ne hot coffee and&#xD;
supper all to yourself~"&#xD;
"Thank you, Miss Maggie, I am not hungry,"&#xD;
he answered. But, when she pressed the matter,&#xD;
he went down-careless what he did, or what be.&#xD;
came of him. He drank the coffee, and listened&#xD;
to Mrs. Crump's account of all that had hap.&#xD;
pened, as in a dream. After some time, he&#xD;
found himself back up-stairs-in hi~ own room,&#xD;
this time-pacing to and fro, or sitting motion-&#xD;
less before the fire, waiting, listening, strung to&#xD;
the highcstpitch of nervous anxiety-for they had&#xD;
promised to call him whenever "any change"&#xD;
should come.&#xD;
So the long hours passed, midnight came, and&#xD;
it was at midnight that the doctor had said the&#xD;
flickering taper would be most likely to go out.&#xD;
In the sick-room all was quiet. The nurse nodded&#xD;
on one side of the fire, and Miss Lester dozed on&#xD;
the other: the doctor had gone into Mr. War-&#xD;
wick's room to lie down, leaving strict directions&#xD;
for the administering of the stimulants, and strict&#xD;
orders that he was to be called at the least sign&#xD;
of change. Mrs. Randolph was sleeping lightly in&#xD;
a deep arm-chair, while Irene Vernon, at the bed,&#xD;
kept vigilant guard over the sick girl. Exactly&#xD;
at midnight, she gave another dose of the stimu-&#xD;
lant, then remembering what the doctor had said,&#xD;
she laid her finger on the pulse. It crept beneath&#xD;
her touch like a thin, feeble thread, but stiil she&#xD;
started, and motioned Mr. Warwick, who was&#xD;
standing near, to bend down.&#xD;
"Feel it," she said. "I may be deceived,&#xD;
but it seems to me it is stronger and fuller than&#xD;
when I felt it last."&#xD;
She took away her linger, and he laid his&#xD;
own in its place. Her eyes were on him, and&#xD;
she saw that he too started~&#xD;
"'It is stronger and fuller," he said. "There&#xD;
is a change of some sort. I must go and call&#xD;
Randolph."&#xD;
He left the room, and was passing down the&#xD;
passage, when a door on the ri~ht opened, and&#xD;
Annesley appeared.&#xD;
"Well," he said, quickly, "has it come?"&#xD;
"There is no change for the worse," answered&#xD;
Mr. Warwick. "I ani only going to wake Ran-&#xD;
dolph. See for yourself, if you like," he added,&#xD;
as Morton looked at him a little doubtfully.&#xD;
In two minutes, the doctor stood in the room,&#xD;
and felt the pulse-his facewatched by the others&#xD;
with breathless anxiety.&#xD;
"There is a little change," he said, guard.&#xD;

T&#xD;
MRS. GORDON'S SUSPICION.&#xD;
&#xD;
edly; "but it may be only a fluctuation of the&#xD;
disease-a flicker of the taper. We shall soon&#xD;
see. Press the stimulants, Miss Vernon-shorten&#xD;
the time between the doses. A few more hours&#xD;
will end all suspense."&#xD;
The hours crept on-slowly, heavily, every&#xD;
minute a battle-ground with Death, who sullenly&#xD;
retreated step by step; not vanquished, only kept&#xD;
at bay. It was, a night that nobody who was&#xD;
present ever forgot, for it is seldom, indeed, that&#xD;
the issue of this terrible conflict hangs on such a&#xD;
trembling balance, that one single error of judg-&#xD;
ment, one single fault of skill, would throw the&#xD;
advantage so irretrievably into the hands of an&#xD;
adversary who never relents. For hours it was&#xD;
impossible to tell whether Life or Death was win-&#xD;
ning the victory.-the variations being so slight,&#xD;
the fluctuations so many. Nobody dared press&#xD;
the doetorwith questions, yet everybody felt what&#xD;
a neck-and-neck race he was running, as he sat&#xD;
by the bed, and scarcely once took his finger from&#xD;
that slender, feeble pulse, steadily pursuing the&#xD;
same treatment which he had so hopelessly be-&#xD;
gun, and stimulating by every possible means the&#xD;
sinking system. Not once during all those hours&#xD;
did the set, anxious expression of his face relax,&#xD;
or his lips utter a word of hope. lie worked&#xD;
with unflagging energy; but whether or not he&#xD;
found any signs of encouragement, no one could&#xD;
tell. When the first light of the cold, gray dawn&#xD;
began to steal into the room, the issue of the&#xD;
battle was still doubtful-the victory was still to&#xD;
be won.&#xD;
Annesley, who had been in and out of the&#xD;
room a dozen times since he had met Mr. War-&#xD;
wick at midnight, was walking up and down&#xD;
the passage (on which a soft cloth, to deaden all&#xD;
sound of foot-steps, had been laid), as this chill&#xD;
dawn began to break. Full as he~was of other&#xD;
thoughts, he stood still to watch it. A less en-&#xD;
livening oecup~tion could hardly be imagined,&#xD;
especially on a winter morning, wh~n mind and&#xD;
body are alike depressed by long watching at a&#xD;
sick-bed. In summer' there is something bright&#xD;
and rejoicing hi the birth of color, the songs of&#xD;
birds, ~xe dewy freshness of awaking Nature;&#xD;
but a winterday dawn is one of the most dreary&#xD;
things in existence. ~How stealthily the gray&#xD;
light comes I How ghost-like the white mist&#xD;
looks creeping aleng the ground, or wreathing&#xD;
into phantom.shapes among the bare, black&#xD;
boughs of trees! How barren and bereft of all&#xD;
beauty the earth seems I .Annesley looked around&#xD;
him drearily, then turned and began his prome-&#xD;
tiade again. Night itself was 'better than this, he&#xD;
&#xD;
thought. Up and down he walked with the day.&#xD;
light growing clearer and clearer around him,&#xD;
all unheeded, or, if noticed, only a discordance.&#xD;
The cast began to glow into royal beauty, fling-&#xD;
ing out her crimson and golden banners, with&#xD;
a gorgeous affluence that made the glories of&#xD;
sunset pale into insignificance. At last, with one&#xD;
magnificent bound, the sun uprose, and sent his&#xD;
long lines of level gold flashing across the earth.&#xD;
One of them darted into the passage where An-&#xD;
nesley paced, and ~treamcd on Katharine's door,&#xD;
like the touch of a burning finger. At that very&#xD;
moment, the door opened, and Irene Vernon came&#xD;
out-the sunshine encircled her like a halo of&#xD;
luminous glory, as Annesley hurried forward to&#xD;
meet her.&#xD;
"You want me?" he asked, breathlessly.&#xD;
~ she answered eagerly, with a smile&#xD;
-was it the smile or the sunshine that dazzled&#xD;
him so ?-" 1 want you. The doctor has spoken&#xD;
at last, and he says- Oh, Mr. Annesley, thank&#xD;
God-that we may hope."&#xD;
CEIAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
MRS. GORDON'S SUSPICION.&#xD;
A raw days later, Katharine was sufficiently&#xD;
out of danger, and sufficiently in the way of re-&#xD;
covery, for Mr. Warwick to think of returning to&#xD;
Tallahoma. He could not see her, or enter into&#xD;
any explanation with her before he went, for the&#xD;
doctor absolutely forbade any exciting presence&#xD;
or exciting topics; but he made every possible&#xD;
arrangement for her comfort, and finally took his&#xD;
departure, with the assurance that she could not&#xD;
be in better hands. She was still at the hotel,&#xD;
for the doctor peremptorily negative removal;&#xD;
but it was understood that Miss Lester ~would&#xD;
claim her as soon as she was well' enough to&#xD;
move. There had been ~uitc ~ contest between&#xD;
this young lady and Mrs~,ll~ulolph on the sub-&#xD;
ject, but the former had oa~ried the point in her&#xD;
spirited, self-willed way. Mrs. Randolph was&#xD;
forced to resign her claim, and it was settled (as&#xD;
much as any thing could be settled without the&#xD;
consent of the person most ewicerned) that Miss&#xD;
Tresham was to be handed over4o~Miss Lester&#xD;
as soon as ~r, Randolph would give his sanction&#xD;
to such a step. Meanwhil~,&amp;amp;Iiss Lester and Miss&#xD;
Vernon at last took their departure from the&#xD;
hotel, and, much to the relief of the downy&#xD;
trodden Lesters, pare and rn~re, accompli~hed&#xD;
their return to Bellefont-the name of tb~ Z~es~'&#xD;
&#xD;
180&#xD;
&#xD;
ter plantation. From this place, however, they&#xD;
made daily incursions on the Eagle Hotel, and&#xD;
sent messengers with game and fruit, and a hun-&#xD;
dred delightful things, at all hours of the day.&#xD;
As for Annesley, he did not trouble himself to&#xD;
go back to Lagrange, but quietly took up his&#xD;
quarters with Godfrey Seymour-who, like the&#xD;
Letters, lived near Hartsburg-aad he, too, left&#xD;
his. compliments and inquiries regularly with&#xD;
Mrs. Crump, for Mrs. Crump's patient.&#xD;
To this patient the sight and sounds of life&#xD;
came back very slowly, giving to life itself a&#xD;
dream-like unreality. It was only by gradual&#xD;
degrees that consciousness returned onee more&#xD;
-that time and the things of time again asserted&#xD;
a claim over the spirit that had stood on the very&#xD;
threshold of eternity. All the weeks of pain,&#xD;
and the days of terrible danger, were blotted&#xD;
into nothingness; so that when Katharine at&#xD;
last opened her eyes to the things around her,&#xD;
she found herself in a new, unintelligible world.&#xD;
Her very arrival in Hartsburg was one of the&#xD;
memories that had gone from her forever, so her&#xD;
complete surprise at the strange faces and strange&#xD;
surroundings about her may be imagined.&#xD;
"Where am I ?-how did I come here ?-who&#xD;
are you all ?" she asked. But, receiving no sat-&#xD;
isfactory reply, she felt too languid and indiffer-&#xD;
ent to press the matter. Day after day she lay&#xD;
in that profound rest which makes the luxury&#xD;
of convalescence, too weak to think, too weak&#xD;
to remember, too weak to conjecture, too weak&#xD;
to do any thing save smile faintly in the doctor's&#xD;
cheerful face, answer Mrs. Randolph's or Mrs.&#xD;
Crump's kind inquiries, and for the remainder&#xD;
of the time lie quite still, watching the sunshine&#xD;
on the window-sill, and Mom Elsie's black fingers&#xD;
as they sent the bright knitting-needles swiftly&#xD;
to and fro. As yet, she had seen no familiar&#xD;
face, heard no familiar name-not even the names&#xD;
of Miss' Lester and Miss Vernon, not even the&#xD;
name of Mr. Warwick.&#xD;
"I'll run no rishs~'~ said the doctor to the&#xD;
latter. "Take yourself oft' to Tallahoma-the&#xD;
sooner the better. Leave her in my hands, and&#xD;
when you come back-we will think about let.&#xD;
ting you see her then. That handsome scamp,&#xD;
young Annesley, had the impudence to come to&#xD;
me with a request of the same sort to-day," he&#xD;
added, smiling. "I assure you, I cut him short.&#xD;
He wanted a message delivered. I. told him I&#xD;
should like to catch myself playing Mercury, or&#xD;
Apollo, or Cupid, or whoever is supposed to be&#xD;
the messenger of love-stricken youths, to a pa-&#xD;
tient just out of a brain-fever."&#xD;
&#xD;
181&#xD;
&#xD;
"I need not trouble you with any thing of&#xD;
the kind, then, I suppose? "~&#xD;
"You may trouble mc with it, as much as you&#xD;
please; but, whether or not I'll trouble Miss&#xD;
Tresham-well, candidly, that is quite another&#xD;
matter."&#xD;
Denied all access to Katharine in this decided&#xD;
manner, Mr. Warwick had no alternative but to&#xD;
take his departure, and leave her, as requested,&#xD;
in the doctor's hands. He did so unwillingly;&#xD;
but time, business engagements, and, above all,&#xD;
the remembrance of Mrs. Gordon's anxiety,&#xD;
pressed him hard. Excepting on a matter of&#xD;
life and death, he absolutely could not remain&#xD;
away from Tallahoma any longer. Feeling this,&#xD;
he made up his mind to go, and, having made&#xD;
up his mind, he was not long in carrying resolve&#xD;
into execution. On Wednesday morning, the&#xD;
twenty-first of January, he drove away from the&#xD;
Eagle Hotel, and, leaving Miss Tresham to be&#xD;
slowly won back to health by comfort and care,&#xD;
turned his face homeward.&#xD;
Wednesday nighthe spentin Saxford. Thurs-&#xD;
day afternoon he was driving along the familiar&#xD;
roads of Lagrange, and fast nearing Tallahoma,&#xD;
when he met a squarely-built, middle-aged man,&#xD;
dressed in a suit of brown homespun, riding a&#xD;
horse (also squarely bulit) of deep-bay color, with&#xD;
whom he stopped to speak.&#xD;
"Well, Shields, how are you?" said he.&#xD;
"Pretty tol'able, I thank you, Mr. Worruck.&#xD;
How do you do yourself, sir?" answered Mr.&#xD;
Shields, with a sort of stolid surprise at the&#xD;
sudden encounter. "I'm glad to see you back.&#xD;
How did you leave the little boy?"&#xD;
"Quite well, and in a fair way to be content-&#xD;
ed, I think. Has not Mrs. Gordon received my&#xD;
letter?"&#xD;
"I don't know, sir. I haven't seen her for&#xD;
nigh about a week. I was at the house Tues.&#xD;
day; but she was onwell, they said, and, as I'd&#xD;
no partic'Iar business, I didn't disturb her."&#xD;
"Any news in Tallahoma?" asked Mr. War.&#xD;
wick, as he saw that the man held his ground&#xD;
and did not pass on as he had expected him to&#xD;
do.&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Shields, speaking slowly,&#xD;
but with evident unction-" well, yes. There's&#xD;
news in Tallahoma that l'm sorry to tell you,&#xD;
Mr. Worruck. The bank was broke into last&#xD;
night, and robbed of a hundred thousand dollars,&#xD;
they say."&#xD;
"What!"&#xD;
"It's a fact, sir. The excitement about it In&#xD;
town is tremendous. You might a' knocked me&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="182-183" xml:id="VAC8070-00000097"/>&#xD;
down with a feather when I heard the news my-&#xD;
self; and, as for Mr. Marks, he was as white as a&#xD;
sheet when I saw him this morning. They say&#xD;
the first thing he knowed of it was when he went&#xD;
down to the bank as usual, and found the locks&#xD;
all broke, and Hugh Ellis-"&#xD;
"When did it happen 1"' demanded Mr. War-&#xD;
wick.&#xD;
"Last night."&#xD;
." Is there any suspicion as to who the thief,&#xD;
or thieves, were?"&#xD;
"There's a suspicion of its bein' a man that&#xD;
went to the bank yesterday; but nobody knows&#xD;
who he is, nor where he is neither, for he's not&#xD;
about town to-day."&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Warwick, "this is bad&#xD;
news, and I must hurry on to town. I will stop&#xD;
and see Mrs. Gordon, however. Good-evening,&#xD;
Shields."&#xD;
He nodded, and Cyrus drove on, leaving Mr.&#xD;
Shields somewhat crestfallen in the middle of the&#xD;
road. He looked regretfully after the vanishing&#xD;
carriage, and then pursued his way in rather a&#xD;
subdued frame of mind. He did not exactly&#xD;
think to himself that it was hard to be cut short&#xD;
in this summary fashion, when he would have&#xD;
liked to talk over all the particulars of the mat-&#xD;
ter, as he had talked them over twenty times&#xD;
before that day; but, none the less, it was hard.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick, as he drove on, did not think of&#xD;
what a real and sensible pleasure he had deprived&#xD;
the poor man.&#xD;
His road led him directly past the gates of&#xD;
Morton House. When he reached those gates,&#xD;
he turned in. Ten minutes later, he was shown&#xD;
by Harrison into Mrs. Gordon's room. She was&#xD;
sitting before the fire, leaning back in a deep&#xD;
armchair with a listless languor that struck Mr.&#xD;
Warwick at once. She did not even turn her&#xD;
head when the door opened, and her abstraction&#xD;
was so deep that he reached her side without at-&#xD;
tracting her attention.&#xD;
"You see I have got back, Mrs. Gordon," he&#xD;
said, quietly. But, quietly a~ he spoke, he could&#xD;
not avoid startling her. She bounded' in her&#xD;
chair at the first tone of his voice; then turned&#xD;
quickly, and tried to rise-did rise half-way,&#xD;
but, through weakness or agitation, sank back&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"You 1" she said, faintly. "I-how you&#xD;
startled me I"&#xD;
"I see I did," he said, with some contrition.&#xD;
"I ought to have known better. I thought you&#xD;
would have heard me come mb&#xD;
"No; I did not."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am back, you see."&#xD;
"Yes, I see." She rose now, and held out&#xD;
her hand. "I am very glad to see you. And&#xD;
Felix?"&#xD;
"I left Felix very well, and almost contented;&#xD;
no doubt, he is quite contented by this time."&#xD;
Instantly her eyes filled with tears.&#xD;
"Contented!" she repeated. "Away from&#xD;
me! Ab, that is(hard-harder than you think!&#xD;
Yet I am glad to hear it. Sit down, pray, and&#xD;
tell me all-every thing-about him. I am hun-&#xD;
gry, heart-hungry, to hear."&#xD;
Pressed for time, and burning with impa-&#xD;
tience, as he was, he sat down and told the story&#xD;
of his journey, with all those details that every&#xD;
woman loves to hear, and few-very few-men&#xD;
know how to give. She listened to him eagerly&#xD;
-drank in every word, indeed-while he de-&#xD;
scribed the kind people (old friends of his own)&#xD;
with whom he had placed Felix, the child's first&#xD;
despair, and subsequent partial content. After&#xD;
every thing, even to the last parting, had been&#xD;
told, he rose.&#xD;
"I would not leave you so soon," he said, in&#xD;
answer to her glance of pained surprise; "but I&#xD;
heard some news, a few minutes ago, which star-&#xD;
tled me very much, and I feel that I ought to&#xD;
J~asten into town. Besides, even for your sake,&#xD;
I had better go. I may find a letter from Mr.&#xD;
Lloyd. You know it was arranged that he should&#xD;
write to me instead of to yourself."&#xD;
"Yes, I know."&#xD;
As she stood up to give him her hand at&#xD;
parting, the light shone full on her face from a&#xD;
window just opposite, and he saw that it was even&#xD;
more pale and hollow than when he went away.&#xD;
"You look badly," he said. "Have you been&#xD;
ill, or only fretting?"&#xD;
"I have had nothing to do since you left but&#xD;
nurse my fancies," she answered, with a sad&#xD;
smile, "until I am half sick with nervous terror&#xD;
about Felix. I have wished a thousand times&#xD;
that I had not sent hinvfrem me, or that I had&#xD;
gone with him."&#xD;
"It is not too late yet," said he, kindly.&#xD;
"Shall I take you to him? Only say the word,&#xD;
and I will do so.&#xD;
"No," answered she; "don't tempt me. I&#xD;
might go if it were not 'that it would look so&#xD;
cowardly, so much as if I had reason to be&#xD;
afraid-and I have none. Let him come! He&#xD;
can do me no harm-now that Felix is gone."&#xD;
"He could annoy you more than you think."&#xD;
"Let him try!" Something like the fire&#xD;
and glow of combat swept into the face that, an&#xD;

He shook hands with her, and was starting to however, he turned round again-a question on&#xD;
leave the room, when she called him back. Like his own lip, and by no means one that she had&#xD;
most women, she had still a "last word," and he anticipated.&#xD;
was doomed to hear it. He could not help feel- "Have you spoken of this before, Mrs. Gor-&#xD;

ing to get away-yet if he had only known "No," she answered, wonderingly. "Even&#xD;

so much that she noticed and was surprised at "Then do not mention this suspicion to any&#xD;

" I hope you may-we Mortons are proud&#xD;
of always keeping our word."&#xD;
" I do rely on it, then. Now, good-by. If I&#xD;
do not leave at once, it will be sunset before I&#xD;
reach Tallahoma."&#xD;
" One word!i I see you think I will never let&#xD;
you go ; but it is only one word more. Have you&#xD;
seen any thing of Morton .Annesley ? His mother&#xD;
is very anxious about him."&#xD;
" Why should shp be anxious ? Surely he is&#xD;
old enough to take care of himself."-'&#xD;
'" He has gone she does not know where, but&#xD;
she strongly suspects that it is in search of--your&#xD;

several weeks ago."&#xD;
" Tell me something about that," said hbe,&#xD;
forgetting even the bank for a moment. " Do&#xD;
you know why she went ?"&#xD;
"I do not know,' but I have -suspected that&#xD;
she was sent by St. John in search of Felix. -I&#xD;
found-after you left-that he came here to see&#xD;
her, and only discovered me accidentally. There&#xD;
is some tie of close connection between them,&#xD;
evidently. I--I absolutely went to ask her to&#xD;
stay here as you advised, and I found him with&#xD;
her. God only knows how grateful I was for&#xD;
having done so. If I had brought her back&#xD;
with me, I might have been weak enough to tell&#xD;
her all that he wishes to know."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick said not a, word. Once again,&#xD;
that incomprehensible expression came over his&#xD;
face which Mrs. Gordon had noticed before. He&#xD;
looked at his boots maeditatively, and, after a&#xD;
while, she went on:&#xD;
"If Felix had not been under your care, I&#xD;
scarcely know how I could have borne the cruel&#xD;
suspense, the cruel doubts and fears Miss Tresha&#xD;
am's absence has: caused me. I am sure she&#xD;
went for this purpose-this alone-and now that&#xD;
I see you before me, my heart begins to fail once&#xD;
more. .Ah, tell me, is he quite safe ?-is there&#xD;
no possibility of her reaching him ~"&#xD;
"You may set your mind at rest on that&#xD;
point," he answered, quietly. " There is not&#xD;
the least danger of his being found by any&#xD;
agent or snesseuger of' Mr. St. John. But I am&#xD;
forgettingmnyself. I must go. Once more, good-&#xD;
by."          .,&#xD;
-He shook hands again hastily, and left the&#xD;
room before she had time for another word. A&#xD;
minute or two later, he was driving at a rapid&#xD;
pace down the avenue.&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER ,XXXIV.&#xD;
MR. WARWicK'S INVESTIGATIoN-.&#xD;
&#xD;
Dusu was setting in when Mr. Warwick en-&#xD;
tered Tallahoma, and, as the Marks house was&#xD;
the first on that side of the village, Cyrus had&#xD;
already drawn up to the gate, and his master was&#xD;
about to descend from the carriage, when the&#xD;
latch was lifted and a servant came Out. .&#xD;
" Mass John I " he exclaimed, as, notwith-&#xD;
standing the dim light, he recognized Mr. War-&#xD;
wick.&#xD;
" How are jou, Tom ? Has your master&#xD;
come home yet ?"&#xD;
" No, sir ; master ain't been home since mor-&#xD;
nin', and mistiss is just now sent me to tell him&#xD;
to come home to supper. Thie bank was robbed&#xD;
last night, Mass John, and-"&#xD;
"yTes, I know.-Drive on, Cyrus-to the&#xD;
bank.--Tell your mistress, Tom, that I have&#xD;
conie, and that I have gone on to meet your&#xD;
master."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick was so occupied with his own&#xD;
thoughts that he did not notice any thing, did&#xD;
not even look out of the window, as he drove&#xD;
through the village, or he would have seen his&#xD;
brother-in-law, who was plodding homewai'd, with&#xD;
step'most unlike his usual brisk business-walk,&#xD;
his head declined, and' his eyes fixed vacantly&#xD;
on the pavement. Thus abstracted, the carriage&#xD;
passed him unperceived, and in a few minutes&#xD;
stopped at the bank,.&#xD;
" You need not wait," said Mr. Warwick,&#xD;
alighting hastily. He opened the-gate, and had&#xD;
proceeded half-way up the walk, when, recollect-&#xD;
ing his promise to Mrs. Gordon about the letter,&#xD;
he went back and called to Cyrus, who was driv.-&#xD;
ing off. " Make haste home with the horses," he&#xD;
said, "and, as soon as you have given them to&#xD;
Jacob, go to the post-office, get my letters, and&#xD;
bring-them here as quickly as possible."&#xD;
The front-door of the bank was standing wide&#xD;
open, and, as he was entering the passage, he&#xD;
heard the sound of a key turning in its lock.&#xD;
The next instant, the clerk of the bank, who&#xD;
had just been locking the door of the cashier's&#xD;
room, preparatory to going out, came toward&#xD;
him. It was too dark to see the young man's&#xD;
face ; but, recognizing gis figure an'd movements,&#xD;
the lawyer spoke.&#xD;
" Well, Hugh, I understand you have had a&#xD;
terrible piece of work here," he said, holding out&#xD;
his hand.&#xD;
Poor Hugh Ellis had borne up manfully until&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WARWICK'S INVESTIGATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
185&#xD;
&#xD;
this moment ; but his courage and power of self&#xD;
control broke down now. Seizing the hand whiichb&#xD;
Mr. Warwick offered, he wrung it hard, made a&#xD;
desperate effort to swallow a huge lump that had&#xD;
been stationary in his throat all day, giving him&#xD;
the constant sensation of choking, failed in his&#xD;
effort, and suddenly burst into tears.&#xD;
" Come, come," said Mr. Warwick, kindly ;&#xD;
" this won't do!i There's no good in crying&#xD;
over a thing, you know. What we must. think&#xD;
of is to ferret out the thieves and get the money&#xD;
hack."&#xD;
" Oh !-if y-ou could-do that, Mr. War-&#xD;
wick !" cried Hugh, sobbingly.&#xD;
"It must be done. So come back into the&#xD;
bank with'me, and let me hear all about the busi-&#xD;
ness. Where's Marks ?"&#xD;
" Just gone home to supper ; but he said he&#xD;
would be back in half an hour," answered Hugh,&#xD;
with animation; for his heart was already light-&#xD;
ened, and his spirits raised, by the confident man-&#xD;
ner of the lawyer.&#xD;
Leading the way back to the cashier's room,&#xD;
he unlocked the door, groped his way to the&#xD;
fireplace-the windows being all shut close, the&#xD;
room was in pitch darkness-felt about on the&#xD;
mantel-piece until he found a box of matches,&#xD;
gnd struck a light. As he turned, with it in&#xD;
his hand, toward Mr. Warwick, who was advan-&#xD;
cing, the latter started in astonishment, exclaim-&#xD;
ing:&#xD;
" Good Heavens ! what, is the matter with&#xD;
you ?'"&#xD;
He might well ask the question, since the face&#xD;
before him was so bruised and disfigured that he&#xD;
could scarcely believe it to be that of Hugh Ellis.&#xD;
The lower part of one cheek was swollen out 4~f&#xD;
all shape, and very much discolored, while the&#xD;
eye on the other side of the face was half closed, .&#xD;
and surrounded with pieces of sticking-plaster,&#xD;
crossed diagonally by narrow strips of black&#xD;
court-plaster to hold them in place-the counte-&#xD;
nance altogether presenting an appearance at&#xD;
once ludicrous and pitiable.&#xD;
" Did you have a fight with the burglars ?" he&#xD;
demanded, his mind leaping to this conclusion be-&#xD;
fo're the young man had time to speak.&#xD;
" Not much of a fight," answered Hugh, in a&#xD;
tone of mortification. "They were two to one,&#xD;
and too much4for me, though-"&#xD;
" But you saw them ? " interrupted the other,&#xD;
eagerly.&#xD;
" Yes, I saw them."&#xD;
" This is better than I bad hoped. Sit down,&#xD;
Hugh, and tell me all about 'it. Don't waste&#xD;
&#xD;
5'&#xD;
&#xD;
- time, for minutes may be valuable here ; but&#xD;
don't slur over particulars, as it is generally by&#xD;
some trifle that a discovery ist made in cases of&#xD;
this sort. Go on."&#xD;
He took a chair as he spoke, and Hugh, put-&#xD;
ting the candle down upon the counter, followed&#xD;
his example, and proceeded to comply with his&#xD;
request.&#xD;
" I went to bed about eleven o'clock, as usual,&#xD;
Mr. Warwick, and soon went to sleep. How long&#xD;
I was asleep, I don't know - but I'm sure it&#xD;
couldn't have been long-when I was waked, as&#xD;
I thought, by a sudden, sharp noise. I jumped&#xD;
up and listened ; but every thing was perfectly&#xD;
still-so still that I began to think I must have&#xD;
been mistaken about there having been any&#xD;
noise, though I couldn't imagine what else would&#xD;
have waked me so suddenly. Since the money&#xD;
was brought up from Hartsburg, I have been&#xD;
very wakeful-easily disturbed, and constantly&#xD;
starting in my sleep. Nearly every night I have&#xD;
got up two or three times- and struck a light to&#xD;
see that all was right. It was only yesterday that&#xD;
I mentioned to Mr. Marks that I hadn't had a&#xD;
good night's sleep since it came ; and lie laughed,&#xD;
and said he was glad I took such care of it, but&#xD;
that it wouldn't be here to trouble me much&#xD;
longer, for he should send off part of it to-day,&#xD;
and expected to get rid of the rest-all that&#xD;
don't belong here-the first of next week. Well,&#xD;
I sat up in bed, listening with. all my ears, for&#xD;
some time-but not a sound could I hear ; and&#xD;
then I get up and struck a light, and went round&#xD;
to all .the doors and windows, examining them&#xD;
closely. Every thing was right, and I put out the&#xD;
candle and went back to bed. But I could not&#xD;
go to sleep again. Not that I felt uneasy. So far&#xD;
from that, I was disposed to laugh at myself for&#xD;
being startled at nothing. But I was so wide&#xD;
awake, that I felt as if I should not be able to&#xD;
close my eyes for the rest of the night. I lay&#xD;
thinking of all sorts of things for a long time,&#xD;
when suddenly-just as quick as thought, Mr.&#xD;
~Warwick, and without knowing why-I jumped&#xD;
up in bed, all over in a cold perspiration!i I&#xD;
had not been asleep-I'd swear to that I-for I&#xD;
was thinking at that very minute about Miss&#xD;
Katharine-who, I suppose, you don't know--"&#xD;
"Yes, I know, she has left Tallahoma. Go&#xD;
on. You were thinking of her, and so you are&#xD;
sure you were awake-?"&#xD;
" Yes, sir. As wide aiwake as I am this min,&#xD;
ute. And there hadn't been the slightest noise-&#xD;
and I couldn't tell, to save my life, what was&#xD;
th~e matter with me. I just jumped up as if I had&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
been set on springs-and found myself in a cold&#xD;
sweat, and trembling like an aspen-leaf. It took&#xD;
me so by surprise that it must have been several&#xD;
seconds before I came to myself sufficiently to&#xD;
know what I was about. Then I felt sure-just&#xD;
as sure as I am now-that something was wrong.&#xD;
I put my hand under the pillow and drew out my&#xD;
revolver, and, without waiting this time to light&#xD;
the candle, I sprang out ef bed, groped my way&#xD;
to the door, which I always leave open at night,&#xD;
and came into this room. I stood still to listen&#xD;
for an instant, but all was silent; I was just&#xD;
turning to go back into my own room to strike&#xD;
a light again, when I heard a noise in the pas-&#xD;
sage outside there.'~ lIe pointed to the door&#xD;
which gave egress from the cashier's room to the&#xD;
passage. "It was a slight, but suspicious kind&#xD;
of noise. Guided by the sound, 1 went close to&#xD;
it-to the door, I mcan~-and then I beard voices&#xD;
whispering. The doors so thick, and they spoke&#xD;
in such a low tone, that I could not make out a&#xD;
single word they said; but I could hear that it&#xD;
was two men talking-and that they were pick-&#xD;
ing the lock. Oh, Mr. Warwick, if I had only&#xD;
had the presence of mind to keep perfectly quiet,&#xD;
so as to let them think I was asleep, and come&#xD;
in, I might have slipped out while they were&#xD;
busy picking the lock of the vault door, and&#xD;
obtained assistance to come and take them be-&#xD;
fore they got the money. Mr. Marks always&#xD;
takes the vault key, and the keys of the safes,&#xD;
home with him at night-and the opening of&#xD;
them must h~ive been a tough job. If only 1 had&#xD;
had the presence of mind! But all I thought of&#xD;
at the minute was to scare them off or kill them&#xD;
-I didn't care which. Like a fool as I was, I&#xD;
didn't even, wait to light the candle, but called&#xD;
out just where I stood, 'I hear you, you thieves!&#xD;
I've got a revolver, and if you want me to send&#xD;
you to the devil, just come on!' They took me&#xD;
at my word quicker than I expected. I hal&#xD;
started once more to goafter the light-but be-&#xD;
fore I was half-way across the room, the door&#xD;
was burst open, and when I turned I just caught&#xD;
one ~limpse of two men as they rushed in, by&#xD;
the light of a lantern one of them carried. It&#xD;
was a dark lantern, and he shut it as soon as he&#xD;
saw that I had no light-I heard the door pushed&#xD;
shut, and one of, them said, 'You stand against&#xD;
it, while I do for this bragging rascal.' I don't&#xD;
remember ever being afraid of anybody before in&#xD;
my life, Mr. Warwick; but it was an awful feel-&#xD;
ing that I' had then-expecting every minute to&#xD;
be seized in the dark, and not knowing how I&#xD;
could defend myself; and, above all, how I could&#xD;
&#xD;
save the money! I knew if they killed me&#xD;
they'd have every thing their own way. Well,&#xD;
the thought flashed through my mind that if I&#xD;
could get into my own room and fasten the door&#xD;
-it locks on the inside-I might manage to&#xD;
escape out of the window, before they could&#xD;
break open the door, and, once out in the moon-&#xD;
light, I could give the alarm, or at least fight&#xD;
them if they followed me. I was barefooted, and&#xD;
had the advantage of them in that-as I made&#xD;
no no:se in moving. But it was pitch dark, and&#xD;
I somehow got turned round in my head as to&#xD;
the direction of my room-door. Instead of going&#xD;
toward it as I intended, I went the opposite way,&#xD;
and suddenly came thump against the counter.&#xD;
The villain that was after me heard it, and I&#xD;
hea~d him coming toward me. I ought to have&#xD;
kept out of his way; but, instead of that, 1&#xD;
fired at random in the direction of the noise be&#xD;
made in approaching, which was the very worst&#xD;
thing I could have done-for of course he was&#xD;
not hit, and the flash of the pistol as it went off&#xD;
showed him exactly where I stood. All was so&#xD;
confused after this, I can scarcely recall any thing&#xD;
about it. I fired twice, and the last thing that I&#xD;
can remember is that just as I was pulling the&#xD;
trigger for the third time, both the scoundrels&#xD;
jumped on me. I fought like mad, but 1 think&#xD;
it couldn't have been long before they over-&#xD;
powered me. I felt a sudden blow here "-he&#xD;
put his hand to the side of his forehead, which&#xD;
was ornamented with the yellow-and-black patch-&#xD;
es. "It seemed to me that a blaze of sparks&#xD;
flashed out of my eyes, and made a solid sheet&#xD;
of white flame before them that shut out every&#xD;
thing. The blow must have knocked me down&#xD;
and stunned me-for my mind don't go beyond&#xD;
seeing this white blaze for an instant, like a flash&#xD;
of lightning exactly. The next recollection I&#xD;
have is of coming to my senses gradually, and&#xD;
finding myself in pitch darkness and dead silence,&#xD;
tied neck and heels, aching all over from head&#xD;
to foot, and with a gagin my mouth. I tried at&#xD;
first to get up, but I couldn't budge an inch, I&#xD;
was tied so hard; and every movement I made&#xD;
seemed as if it would kill me with pain. As to&#xD;
my head, 1 really thought it would burst, it ached&#xD;
so! I think 1 was hardly in my right senses for&#xD;
some time-for, in spite of myself; I kept strug-&#xD;
gling to get loose, until I was almost strangled,&#xD;
besides suffering perfect agonies from the strain-&#xD;
ing of my wrists and ankles, which had all thc&#xD;
skin rubbed off of them." He held up his bands,&#xD;
exhibiting a pair of bandaged wrists, as he went&#xD;
on: "At last I lay quiet from exhaustion-and I&#xD;

MR. WARWICK'S INVESTIGATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
187&#xD;
&#xD;
couldn't begin to give you an idea of how mud&#xD;
1 suffered, and how long the time seemed, unti&#xD;
Mr. Marks came in the morning. I thought morn&#xD;
ing never would come! 1 hope I may never, a:&#xD;
long as I live, have such a time of it again&#xD;
knew the bank was robbed-and that it was mj&#xD;
fault-because if I had only-"&#xD;
"You are wrong," said Mr. Warwick, as tin&#xD;
young man's voice faltered, and the tears agair&#xD;
came into his eyes. "It was not your fault-you&#xD;
did your best-and that is all that can be re.&#xD;
quired of any man, and you were willing to risk&#xD;
your life-and that is what every man would&#xD;
not do under similar circumstances. So, don't&#xD;
blame yourself unjustly. I am sure Marks doesn't&#xD;
blame you."&#xD;
"No. He-"&#xD;
"You say you saw the men?" interrupted&#xD;
Mr. Warwick, who was exceedingly impatient to&#xD;
come back to this point of Hugh's narrative, and&#xD;
had only constrained himself to listen to the&#xD;
rather verbose relation of the young man, in the&#xD;
hope of hearing something more about those per-&#xD;
sonages. "Have you any suspicion of who they&#xD;
were?"&#xD;
"I have a suspicion that I have seen one&#xD;
of them before, sir-though I couldn't be certain,&#xD;
as it was only just a single glimpse that I caught&#xD;
of them, before the lantern was shut."&#xD;
"Who was it?" said Mr. Warwick, abruptly.&#xD;
"I don't know his name, sir--he is a stranger&#xD;
hereabouts; that is, if I'm not mistaken about&#xD;
the person I'm thinking of. When I turned&#xD;
round, as the door was burst open, I saw the two&#xD;
men distinctly for an instant-that is, distinctly&#xD;
enough to take in a general idea of their appear-&#xD;
ance, and to see that they were black. But I&#xD;
felt sure then, and I'm still more sure, in think-&#xD;
ing it over, that they were not negroes, but white&#xD;
men with their faces blacked."&#xD;
"It is more likely," commenced Mr. Warwick,&#xD;
"that they wore-" crape masks, he was going to&#xD;
say-but stopped himself in time. "You are&#xD;
right, Hugh; they were certainly white men.&#xD;
This is not the sort of thing that negroes would&#xD;
undertake. And you think you recognized one&#xD;
of them?"&#xD;
"I think so, sir. The one that was in front&#xD;
when I saw them was quite a tall man-as tall&#xD;
as you are yourself; or taller, and stout in&#xD;
proportion; the other, who had the lantern,&#xD;
was shorter and thick-set. Just about such a&#xD;
looking man as Mr. Shields." ("Not St. John-&#xD;
either of them ~" thought Mr. Warwick, paren-&#xD;
thetically.) "It was the first one that I thought&#xD;
&#xD;
i I recognized. I never saw him but once, and'&#xD;
I that was the day before the robbery-"&#xD;
"Yesterday, then."&#xD;
"Yes, it was yesterday, though it seems, to&#xD;
me a good deal longer ago. Well, this man&#xD;
came into the bank, while Mr. Marks was gone&#xD;
to dinner, with a very ragged live-dollar bill that&#xD;
he wanted a new note for."&#xD;
"And did he get it ?-did you take the&#xD;
bill?"&#xD;
"No, sir, I couldn't. It was no bill of ours,&#xD;
but one of the 'Commercial Bank of A.'s' notes.&#xD;
I thought it was strange that the man should be&#xD;
so stupid as not to know that a bank has ifoth-&#xD;
ing to do, in this way, ~'ith any but its own is-&#xD;
sues; but I explained the matter to him; and&#xD;
he seemed very bard to understand. I felt a lit-&#xD;
tle out of patience at having to go over and over&#xD;
my explanation; and nIl the while I was talking,&#xD;
he stood staring round the room, and at me, in a&#xD;
very curious way. 1 noticed that he stayed a&#xD;
great deal longer than there was any necessity&#xD;
for; and seemed inclined to stay still longer, if I&#xD;
had not told him that, if that was all he wanted, I&#xD;
was sorry I could not accommodate him, and&#xD;
that he must excuse my going back to my writ-&#xD;
ing, as I was busy. He went away then."&#xD;
"And you think this was one of the bur-&#xD;
glars?"&#xD;
"I think so, sir; but I wouldn't take oath to&#xD;
it. There was something about the tallest of the&#xD;
two scoundrels that at once brought this stranger&#xD;
to my mind; but it might have been merely his&#xD;
height."&#xD;
"The voice-did you notice that?"&#xD;
"No, sir. I was in to ~ much of a flurry to&#xD;
think of noticing that. And I only heard him&#xD;
speak once."&#xD;
"Was his dress the same as that of the stran-&#xD;
ger?"&#xD;
Hugh shook his bead. "Both of the bur-&#xD;
glars had on blanket overcoats. The stranger&#xD;
who came about the money was dressed in&#xD;
black."&#xD;
"HewnsnotagentlemanIsuppose?"&#xD;
"Well, I can hardly say," answered Hugh,&#xD;
hesitatingly. "His dress was rather shabby;&#xD;
but still, so far as that was concerned, he might&#xD;
have passed for a gentleman. But there was&#xD;
something in his face, a bang-dog sort of look,&#xD;
that-but, on the whole, I suppose, yes "-rather&#xD;
doubtfully-" I suppose be was a gentleman.&#xD;
And I can't believe that he did not know better&#xD;
than he pretended about the bill. I think he&#xD;
made that an excuse to get in and take a look at&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="188-189" xml:id="VAC8070-00000100"/>&#xD;
the bank, and find out all he could. I saw him&#xD;
looking very hard at the door of the vault there.&#xD;
And he shut the room-door when he went out,&#xD;
though he found it standing open. And then, he&#xD;
didn't walk out at once, but stopped so long in&#xD;
the passage that I went and opened the door to&#xD;
see what on earth he was about. He walked&#xD;
away when he heard me coming, I suppose, for&#xD;
he was just going out of the front door when I&#xD;
stepped into the passage."&#xD;
"All this does look very suspicious," said Mr.&#xD;
Warwick. "Did it occur to you, at the time, that&#xD;
he might have evil intentions?"&#xD;
"No, sir. Such an idea never entered my&#xD;
head. All I thought was t1i~t he must be some&#xD;
idler who had nothing to do himself~, and was&#xD;
loafing about, disturbing other people at their&#xD;
work. He had a dissipated appearance; indeed,&#xD;
be looked to me more like a gambler than any&#xD;
thing else."&#xD;
"And have you made any inquiries about&#xD;
him, as to who and what he is, and whether he&#xD;
is in town yet?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, sir-we've tried to find out some-&#xD;
thing about him, but nobody seems to know any&#xD;
thing at all. As soon as I told Mr. Marks this&#xD;
morning what I've just been telling you, he tried&#xD;
his best to trace up the fellow; and so did a good&#xD;
many other people. The whole town's been in a&#xD;
great excitement, as you may suppose, Mr. War-&#xD;
wick."&#xD;
"Did you, or anybody, go to the hotel and in-&#xD;
quire if the man had been there?"&#xD;
"Mr. Hilliard was here himself, and Mr. Marks&#xD;
asked him, the first thing, whether a man like the&#xD;
one I described had been at his hotel. He said&#xD;
not; and nobody seems to have seen him except&#xD;
little Jimmy Powell, who thinks it must have~&#xD;
been a man that came into his father's store&#xD;
yesterday, about dinner-time, and bought a pen-&#xD;
knife from him,"&#xD;
"And what has Marks.-"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick paused, as he heard the sound&#xD;
of approaching foot-steps. The next moment,&#xD;
Cyrus entered with some letters which he gave&#xD;
to hie nlaster, who, after glancing at the address&#xD;
of each, put all but one of them into his pocket.&#xD;
That one he opened at once, and read it with&#xD;
evident satisfaction, "Give me a sheet of paper,&#xD;
and pen and ink, Hugh, if you please," he said,&#xD;
as he refolded it. Carefully sealing it up and&#xD;
addressing it, he handed it to Cyrus, saying,&#xD;
"Take a horse and go with this at once to Mor-&#xD;
ton House. Ask to see Mrs. Gordon yourself,&#xD;
and give it into her own hand. Now, don't lose&#xD;
&#xD;
it-for your life, Cyrus! It is of the greatest&#xD;
importance."&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Have you had your supper?" said Mr. War'&#xD;
wick, calling him back as he was leaving the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"Then go home and get it before you carry&#xD;
that letter; but don't be all night over it, for I&#xD;
want the letter delivered as soon as possible.&#xD;
And remember what I told you this afternoon-&#xD;
about gossipingg"&#xD;
"Yes, sir-I ain't forgot."&#xD;
"Talking of supper, I expect I have been&#xD;
keeping yen from yours, Hugh?" said Mr. War.&#xD;
wick, as Cyrus finally disappeared.&#xD;
"Oh, I'm not in a hurry-I'm not at all hun-&#xD;
gry," answered the young man.&#xD;
"You ought to be, then," said Mr. Marks,&#xD;
entering the door in time to hear the last sen-&#xD;
tence, "for you had no dinner any more than&#xD;
myself.-Well, Warwick," he continued, as he&#xD;
shook hands with hiabrother-in-law, who rose to&#xD;
meet him, "you come back to find me a ruined&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"Not so bad as that, I hope," said Mr. War-&#xD;
wick, gazing hard at the face before him, which,&#xD;
by the dim light of the single candle, looked&#xD;
pale and haggard, as he had never seen it be-&#xD;
fore. "It is an ugly business, I must admit," he&#xD;
went on; "but giving up is not the way to mend&#xD;
it. We must go to work and find the thieves&#xD;
and the money.,~&#xD;
"That's easier said than done," replied Mr.&#xD;
Marks, sitting down with an air of hopeless de-&#xD;
jection. "We've been all day trying to do some-&#xD;
thing toward it, and have not succeeded in gain-&#xD;
ing the least trace to begin with, And the in-&#xD;
fernal scoundrels have got a clear start on us of&#xD;
sixteen or eighteen hours, at least."&#xD;
"Why, surely you have sent out advertise-&#xD;
ments of the robbery to all the papers in the&#xD;
State, and notified the bank to stop payment of&#xD;
the notes stolen?" said Mr. Warwick.&#xD;
"Oh, yes; I sent off special messengers not&#xD;
an hour after I found out the robbery. But the&#xD;
thieves arc not likely to let the grass grow under&#xD;
their feet. Of course, they'll get out of the State&#xD;
as fast as they can.-Hugh, why don~t you go to&#xD;
supper?"&#xD;
"I'd rather stay and hear what Mr. Warwick&#xD;
thinks ought to be done," answered Hugh,&#xD;
"I'm afraid nothing can be done to-night,"&#xD;
said Mr. Warwick. "But, when you come back,&#xD;
you shall hear if we have decided on any thing."&#xD;
&#xD;
Upon this hint, Hugh, who took his meals at&#xD;
a boarding-house not far off, finally went to his&#xD;
long-deferred supper; and Mr. Warwick inquired&#xD;
what was the amount of money stolen. "A hun-&#xD;
dred thousand dollars, Shields told me, but I&#xD;
suppose that is an exaggeration?" he said.&#xD;
"Yes; the amount did not reach that figure.&#xD;
There was twenty-four thousand and eighty dol-&#xD;
lars in specie, a package of fifty thousand in&#xD;
notes still in the sheet, and thirteen hundred and&#xD;
twenty-seven dollars in bills that have been in&#xD;
circulation," answered Mr. Marks, with his usual&#xD;
preciseness,'but by no means his usual brisk,&#xD;
hearty tone.&#xD;
"And you sent off at once to the bank, and&#xD;
all its branches, giving the numbers of the&#xD;
notes?"&#xD;
"I did every thing that could be done in&#xD;
that way. I sent messengers right off express&#xD;
to our bank and branches; and I wrote by mail&#xD;
to all the other banks in the State, and in the&#xD;
neighboring States, giving a list of the numbers&#xD;
of the notes, even down to the one-dollar bills.&#xD;
Powell, and Gibbs, and Williamson, and Horton,&#xD;
were here all the morning, assisting Hugh and&#xD;
myself with the writing-copying the lists and&#xD;
the advertisements-and Burgess kept the mail&#xD;
open to the minute the stage was starting, to&#xD;
put the letters in. I have offered, on my&#xD;
own responsibility, a reward of five thousand&#xD;
dollars for the recovery of the whole of the&#xD;
money; or a thousand for the detection of the&#xD;
thieves, and recovery of any considerable part&#xD;
of it"&#xD;
"So far, very well," said Mr. Warwick&#xD;
"And how about trying to detect the thieves&#xD;
yourself? Did you examine closely the scene&#xD;
of their operations? - and could nothing be&#xD;
found to afford a clew?"&#xD;
"The whole town, pretty near, were examin-&#xD;
ing-" -&#xD;
"You ought not to have permitted that. The&#xD;
thief or thieves themselves might have been&#xD;
among the number, for aught you know, to see&#xD;
if they had left any thing behind them, and to&#xD;
secure it if they had."&#xD;
"No danger of that," answered Mr. Marks.&#xD;
"Hugh saw the thieves, and he says one of them&#xD;
was very tall-over six feet, he is sure-and the&#xD;
othe' was short and heavy built. There was&#xD;
nobody here that would answer to either descrip-&#xD;
tion, and nobody that we didn't know. Just our&#xD;
own townsfolk. I wouldn't have let strangers&#xD;
come about, of course."&#xD;
"And how do you know but that th~ robbery&#xD;

&#xD;
may have been committed by some of our own&#xD;
townsfolk?"&#xD;
Mr. Marks shook his head. "There are some&#xD;
trifling men in Tallahoma, it's true; but .1 don't&#xD;
believe there's one that would be bad enough for&#xD;
a thing of this sort."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick rose and took up the candle-&#xD;
stick.&#xD;
"Get another light, and come with me, will&#xD;
you? I should like to look at the vault myself"&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
Mr. Marks did as requested. He took from&#xD;
the mantel-piece another candle, lighted it, pro-&#xD;
duced a bunch of key~ from his pocket, and pro-&#xD;
ceeded across the room to a heavy-looking door&#xD;
set in a deep recess in the wall.&#xD;
"The lock was picked, but I had another put&#xD;
on, though it looks very much like locking the&#xD;
stable after' the horses are stolen," he said, as&#xD;
he opened the door.&#xD;
Descending a narrow flight of steps that ran&#xD;
down against the wall, with a balustrade to pro-&#xD;
tect it on the outside, they held the lights for-&#xD;
ward, and Mr. Warwick took a survey of the&#xD;
place. It was a small, vaulted cell rather than&#xD;
room, not more than eight feet by twelve, with&#xD;
two huge safes standing against the wall oppo-&#xD;
site the stairs. Substantial safes they were for&#xD;
the period, but not cast-iron, and not burglar..&#xD;
proof, as their present melancholy condition&#xD;
proved. The doors of both were wide open; but&#xD;
while one of them retained its contents, consist-&#xD;
ing of piles of ledgers, labelled boxes, and bun-.&#xD;
dles of papers of all sizes (which had evidently&#xD;
been roughly handled and thrust back in utter&#xD;
confusion), the shelves of the other were bare.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick examined the whole place with&#xD;
the most minute care. First, he held hiscandle&#xD;
within the empty money-safe, running his eye,&#xD;
and even passing his hand, over every square&#xD;
inch of surface on the two shelves above, and&#xD;
taking the drawer which was fitted between the&#xD;
lower shelf and the floor of the safe, for the&#xD;
reception of specie, clean out of its place, in&#xD;
order to make an effectual search.&#xD;
"You'll find nothino-" said Mr. Marks, who&#xD;
had stood by watching these proceedings with an.&#xD;
expression of face in which apathy and impa-&#xD;
tience were rather singularly blended.&#xD;
"Don't let me detain you," said Mr. War-&#xD;
wick, reading this expression. "I dare say you&#xD;
are right, but still I want to satisfy myself by a&#xD;
thorough examination. You were all excited&#xD;
this morning, of course, and may have overlooked&#xD;
some little matter-there is somebody coming in,&#xD;
&#xD;

I think~ Had you not better go and see, Rid&#xD;
ard? I will be up presently."&#xD;
"I suppose it's Hugh," replied Mr. Marks&#xD;
"but I'll go."&#xD;
Left alone, Mr. Warwick next subjected th&#xD;
floor of the vault to as close an inspection a&#xD;
that which he had bestowed on the safe, unt&#xD;
he was convinced that no object, though it ha&#xD;
been only the size of a pin, could have escape&#xD;
his observation. He then took in hand the saf&#xD;
containing the documents. Every separate vol&#xD;
ume, every box, and each package of paper~&#xD;
passed under the scrutiny of his keen eye an4&#xD;
industrious fingers. But, as Mr. Marks had pre&#xD;
diced, he found nothing.&#xD;
It was with a sense of decided, though eve&#xD;
to himself unacknowledged, discouragement, tha&#xD;
he remounted the stairs to the room above. Mr&#xD;
Marks was sitting in a drooping attitude, witl&#xD;
his eyes, but not his thoughts, fixed on the clerk&#xD;
who knelt' upon the hearth, trying to ignite&#xD;
hopeless-looking pile of wood which he had ins&#xD;
put on the andirons. In their excitement an&#xD;
preoccupation of mind, both himself and his prin&#xD;
cipal had forgotten the fire that afternoon-th&#xD;
more readily, as the day had been a very mik&#xD;
one., But the evening closed in cold; and poci&#xD;
Hugh, who was feeling almost as wretchedly Ia&#xD;
body as in mind, shivered at the cheerless aspect&#xD;
of the apartment, as much as at its chilly tem-&#xD;
perature, when he returned from his boarding-&#xD;
house. The hearth, that always gave forth such&#xD;
a cheerful glow and warmth, was cold and dark&#xD;
now-like the ill-fortune that had so unexpect-&#xD;
edly come upon them, he could not help think-&#xD;
lug-4hough he was not addicted to a poetical&#xD;
turn of thought usually.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick walked up to his brother-in-law&#xD;
and laid his hand on his shoulder kindly. "Take&#xD;
my advice, Richard," he said. "tie home and&#xD;
go to bed, There~s nothing more for you to do&#xD;
here; and you look thoroughly used up. I want&#xD;
to ask Hugh a few questions about his visitors&#xD;
of last night; but I shall not be long. Tell Bes-&#xD;
sic, if you please, to have some hot coffee ready&#xD;
for ma-I have had no diniker."&#xD;
"I can wait for you," said Mr. Marks.-" By.&#xD;
the-way, Hugh,'hadn't you better have got some-&#xD;
body to stay with you to-night.?"&#xD;
"What for?" demanded Hifgh, coloring with&#xD;
boyish mortification. "There's no such good&#xD;
luck as that those villains should take it into&#xD;
their heads to come back. I only wish they&#xD;
would. I'd know how to deal with them this&#xD;
time?"&#xD;
&#xD;
)N HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ei- "And1" pursued Mr. Marks, who was a kind-&#xD;
hearted man, considerate of the comfort of those&#xD;
; about him, and feeling now some self-reproach as&#xD;
he remembered how little attention he had paid&#xD;
e to the pains and bruises which the clerk had.&#xD;
s incurred, though unavailingly, in the discharge&#xD;
il of his duty-" and I don't believe Tom has been&#xD;
d here to attend to your room to-day, has he?"&#xD;
d "Yes, sir, he came this morning, but it was&#xD;
e while the house was full, and every thing in eon-&#xD;
[- fusion; so I told him to never mind about it."&#xD;
,    "I'll go and send him now, thcn.-You might&#xD;
~ as well come with rae, John. It must be getting&#xD;
late, and I should think that, as you had no din-&#xD;
ner, you'd be hungry."&#xD;
r "I am. But waiting a little longer makes&#xD;
t no difference; and I must take a look at Hugh's&#xD;
room. It is only eight o'clock," he added, con.&#xD;
r suiting his watch. "I will follow you in half&#xD;
an hour, or less time, perhaps."&#xD;
Mr. Marks made no further remonstrance, but&#xD;
L rose, said good-night, a~Iid departed.&#xD;
I "Now, Hugh, let mc see your room," said Mr&#xD;
- Warwick. "lam glad that it has not been med-&#xD;
died with. Did 'you look about to find if-&#xD;
I Humph!" he exclaimed, as at this moment he&#xD;
stepped into the apartment in question, which&#xD;
adjoined the cashier's room. "Humph!"&#xD;
It was a comfortless-looking dormitory at&#xD;
- present, certainly. The bedelothing, including&#xD;
- the inttttresses, had been tumbled off one side&#xD;
of the French bedstead, and lay in a disordered&#xD;
heap upon the floor, which was strewed with&#xD;
* strips and fragments resembling hospital-linen,&#xD;
for much of it was crumpled and bloody, like&#xD;
soiled bandages. Hugh explained that he had&#xD;
been tied down to the bedstead itself; which, no&#xD;
doubt, was bared for that purpose. The sheets.&#xD;
had been torn up, and twisted into a rough imi-&#xD;
tation of rope, with which he was bound.&#xD;
"The scoundrels seemed to understand their&#xD;
business," said the young man. "You see they&#xD;
made notches in the side of the bedstead here&#xD;
near the head, to keep the bandy I was tied&#xD;
with from slipping."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick bent over, and looked closely&#xD;
at the spot pointed out. "'The bedstead was of&#xD;
walnut-wood, and the no~ehes appeared to have&#xD;
been cut into it without difficulty, as they were&#xD;
at least an inch deep. "The wood is soft," he&#xD;
'remarked. "This looks as if it 'had been cut&#xD;
with a pocket-knife."&#xD;
He stepped toward the foot of the bed as&#xD;
he spoke, and again leaned down to examine&#xD;
whether there were notches there too. There&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV&#xD;
Two AaD TWO xauz revs.&#xD;
&#xD;
was one great gash-obviously the commence&#xD;
ment of a notch-but that was all. In holding~&#xD;
the candle so that the light would fall full upor&#xD;
this, Mr. Warwick's eye was attracted to&#xD;
small, glittering object upon the carpet just al&#xD;
the side of the bed, and, stooping, he picked ii&#xD;
up.&#xD;
"What is it?" cried Hugh, as the lawyci&#xD;
uttered a slight exclamation.&#xD;
"A fragment of the blade of a knife," an-&#xD;
swered Mr. Warwick, quietly, but his eyes spar-&#xD;
kled. "Something may be made of this, I&#xD;
hope," he added, examining it eagerly.&#xD;
"Oh, do you really think so, Mr. Warwick?"&#xD;
said Hugh, joyfully..&#xD;
"I hope so. It was broken in the attempt to&#xD;
make that notch."&#xD;
"And you think, sir, you can trace them out&#xD;
by it?"&#xD;
"I shall try. It is a point to begin with;&#xD;
and in an affair of this kind, as in every thing&#xD;
else, the first step is almost always the most&#xD;
difficult. I shall sleep the better to-night for&#xD;
having found this little bit of metal. Here-hold&#xD;
the candle a minute!"&#xD;
Hugh extended a hand trembPng with excite-&#xD;
ment for the candle, and Mr. Warwick took out&#xD;
his pocket-book and carefully placed the broken&#xD;
blade in an inner compartment of it.&#xD;
"Don't be too sanguine," he said to Hugh,&#xD;
as he fastened the clasp, and returned the book&#xD;
to his pocket. "And don't mention my having&#xD;
*found this to any body-least of all, to Marks-&#xD;
for it may turn out nothing. But," he added, as&#xD;
he saw Hugh's face fall at these words, "I think it&#xD;
is a clew. Good-night. There's Tom coming, and&#xD;
I'll go. Oh I-don't have any sweeping done&#xD;
to-night. I will be here early in the morning,&#xD;
and we can then make a more careful search of&#xD;
the room, and may possibly find something else.&#xD;
I don't like to keep my sister waiting for me so&#xD;
long; and this does very well for a beginning.&#xD;
Mind, Hugh, that you hold your tongue!"&#xD;
"I will, Mr. Warwick."&#xD;
"You are not afraid of another call from your&#xD;
friends, the burglars?"&#xD;
"Afraid? I should think not!" cried the&#xD;
young man, flushing, and half offended by the&#xD;
question.&#xD;
"Well, good-night," said Mr. Warwick.&#xD;
"Here's Tom."&#xD;
&#xD;
7'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Joux, John, I am so glad you have got back&#xD;
at last I" was Mrs. Marks's greeting to her&#xD;
brother, when he entered the dining-room,&#xD;
where a bright fire and the supper-table were&#xD;
* waiting for him. She had been crying all day,&#xD;
* poor woman, but the fountain of her tears was&#xD;
not exhausted. It gave forth a plentiful supply&#xD;
of briny drops, as Mr. Warwick smiled kindly,&#xD;
kissed her, and told her to dry her eyes, and&#xD;
give him some supper, for ~that he was tired and&#xD;
hungry.&#xD;
"Richard has gone to bed, I hope?" said&#xD;
he, as Mrs. Marks began to take up from the&#xD;
hearth, where they were ranged in a semicircle&#xD;
to keep warm, various dishes, which she placed&#xD;
upon the table, himself hastening to assist her&#xD;
in doing so.&#xD;
"Yes, he's gone to bed "-a profound sigh&#xD;
-"but there's no sleep for him t/d., night, F&#xD;
know. Seventy - five thousand, four hundred&#xD;
and seventy dollars, John," pursued poor Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, with a ludicrous, unconscious imitation&#xD;
of her husband's manner, that made Mr. War-&#xD;
wick smile, despite his sincere sympathy with&#xD;
the distress which seemed so out of place on&#xD;
the rouuid, good - nature face before him.&#xD;
"More than twice as much as Richard is&#xD;
worth, counting every sixpence he has got in&#xD;
the world I-and he blames himself for it all-&#xD;
and I'm sure he must blame me, though he&#xD;
don't say so "-the tears burst forth afresh-.--&#xD;
"gnd five little children-"&#xD;
"Stop a minute," said Mr. Warwick, stem-&#xD;
ming the torrent of words that promised to flew&#xD;
on uninterruptedly for an indefinite time to come.&#xD;
"Blames himself? What does he blame him-&#xD;
self for?"&#xD;
"He says he ought never to have left the&#xD;
bank~ That a cashier's business and duty is to&#xD;
protect, by hia constant presence, the property&#xD;
committed to his charge; and that, instead of&#xD;
leaving poor Hugh to bear the brunt of the&#xD;
danger, and get beaten and bruised nearly&#xD;
to death, he ought to have been there himself.&#xD;
And you know it was m~y fault, John, that&#xD;
we left the bank, because it was such a nasty,&#xD;
cooped-up place for the children, compared to&#xD;
this house."&#xD;
"All this sort of talk is nonsense, Bessie,"'&#xD;
said Mr. Warwick. "Marks is very much out ot~&#xD;

&#xD;
spirits, of course; but he will find that matters&#xD;
are not so bad, after all. He has been prompt in&#xD;
taking the steps necessary in the business, and&#xD;
the only uneasiness I feel now is about the spe-&#xD;
cie. I have no doubt the greater part of that&#xD;
can be recovcred-but not the whole, prob-&#xD;
ably. As to the notes - you need not trou-&#xD;
ble yourself about them, I assure you. The&#xD;
scoundrels will find that the fifty thousand&#xD;
dollars might as well be blank paper so far&#xD;
as they are concerned. In faet, it is certain&#xD;
t~ bring detection upon them if they try to&#xD;
pass it."&#xD;
"I don't see how that can be," said Mrs.&#xD;
Marks, drying her eyes once more, but, looking&#xD;
very doubtful. "It's money. All they've got to&#xD;
do is to cut 'it apart.. It's signed, every bit of&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"And numbered too, fortunately. Never&#xD;
mind puzzling yourself with the matter. You&#xD;
can take my word for it, can't you?"&#xD;
"I suppose so. But John, are you quite&#xD;
sure "&#xD;
"Well ?" he said, as she paused, and the in-&#xD;
exhaustible fountain began welling forth from&#xD;
her eyes again.&#xD;
"Are you sure we shall not be ruined-&#xD;
and" sob "that Richard's character&#xD;
won't-"&#xD;
"Bessie," said Mr. Warwick, in such a very&#xD;
quiet tone, that Bessie's eyes opened wide in&#xD;
startled surprise, and the drops with which they&#xD;
were brimming stood arrested in their fall-&#xD;
"Bessie, have you quite forgotten that you once&#xD;
bore the name of ~&#xD;
The~ poor wo~nan was bewildered. Never&#xD;
very quick of apprehension, she was totally un-&#xD;
able now to perceive the connection between&#xD;
this "awful" bank robbery and her own maiden~&#xD;
name; and, after a troubled pause of considera-&#xD;
tion, she looked inquiringly into her brother's&#xD;
face.&#xD;
~ I asked the question," continued he, "be-&#xD;
cause I confess that I am mortified to find that&#xD;
my sister "-he laid a strong emphasis on the&#xD;
last two words-" instead of being courageous&#xD;
and cheerful in this misfortune which has be-&#xD;
fallen her husband, as a brave woman and good&#xD;
wife ought to be, is giving way to unreasonable&#xD;
and extravagant lamentations that must make it&#xD;
twice as hard-~"&#xD;
"Oh, n~l you don't mean that I have made&#xD;
it harder for Richard to hear! Surely you don't&#xD;
think that! '~&#xD;
"I know it."&#xD;
&#xD;
She wrung her hands spasmodically. "What&#xD;
can I do-what can I do?"&#xD;
"You can act like a sensible woman, and re-&#xD;
member that the loss of money-even if Marks&#xD;
loses any, which I ani not at all sure that he&#xD;
will-"&#xD;
"He says he intends to refund every cent&#xD;
that the bank loses, whether it is required of him&#xD;
or not, aid if it takes nIl that he owns in the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"He may be a few thousands out of pock.&#xD;
et, then-but what of that? if?, instead of los-&#xD;
ing a little money-or, we will say a good deal of&#xD;
money-he or some of the children were to&#xD;
die-"&#xD;
"John!" gasped his sister, turning very&#xD;
pale.&#xD;
"I think you would feel what a trifle, com-&#xD;
paratively speaking, this whole business is," went&#xD;
on Mr. Wavwick, without noticing her horrified&#xD;
ejaculation-" and be glad that trouble, which&#xD;
you know everybody has to endure in this world,&#xD;
Bessie, has come in this form, instead of a&#xD;
worse'&#xD;
"Indeed, I am glad-and thankful to God,"&#xD;
said she, in a subdued, rather awe-struck tone.&#xD;
"And thankful to you, John, for reminding mc&#xD;
of it," she added.&#xD;
lie smiled encouragingly, and told her he had&#xD;
no doubt this wretched business might be set to&#xD;
rights in the end; but th&amp;amp;t, meanwhile, he ex-&#xD;
pected to see her hopeful and brave. Then he&#xD;
went to a side-table, where a chamber candlestick&#xD;
was ready foi~ him, and, as he lighted it, asked&#xD;
whether she thought Marks was asleep yet. "I&#xD;
* won't disturb him, if he is; but I should like to&#xD;
speak to him a moment, if he is not. Will you&#xD;
see, Bessie, if you please?"&#xD;
She went, merely opened the ehamb&amp;amp;-door,&#xD;
glanced in, and returned.&#xD;
"He's wide awake," she said, with a sigh.&#xD;
"I will go and speak to him, then, Good-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"Come in," responded Mr. Marks's voice,&#xD;
when his brother-in-law knocked at his door a&#xD;
minute later.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick walked up to the bed, and found&#xD;
the afflicted cashier lying straight and motionless&#xD;
on his back, 'with his arms tlirownup over the&#xD;
pillow, his hands folded one upon ,the, other&#xD;
above his head, and the same expression of&#xD;
stolid endurance on his face that it had worn&#xD;
when he was at the bank.&#xD;
"I have just been scolding Bessie, Dick,"&#xD;
said Bessie's brother, with a smile thn~t had&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;

TWO AND TWO MAR11 FOUR.&#xD;
&#xD;
humor as well as cheerful kindness in it-" and&#xD;
I have come to give you your share now. Why,&#xD;
pounds! what's the use of being a man, if you&#xD;
can't bear the ills of life like a man! It is&#xD;
natural that you should feel this severely; it is&#xD;
a bad business, as it stands just at present. But&#xD;
you must not look only on the dark side of it.&#xD;
The money may be recovered-will be recovered,&#xD;
I believe. You know whether I am in the habit&#xD;
of talking at random, or of boasting; and I tell&#xD;
you that I have not the least doubt of being&#xD;
able to track down the villains-in time. We&#xD;
must have patieneer and not be discouraged be-&#xD;
cause it is impossible to find them at once. I&#xD;
have made a little discovery since I saw you-"&#xD;
"You don't say so!" cried Mr. Marks, start-&#xD;
ing up and leaning on his elbow, as he gazed&#xD;
eagerly up into the other's face. "What is it?&#xD;
-what-?"&#xD;
"Never mind as to that. It is something&#xD;
that Hugh and myself found out after you left.&#xD;
Don't question Hugh in the morning. I told&#xD;
him not to say any thing to you about it. I&#xD;
should not have mentioned it myself if it had not&#xD;
been that I see you need stirring up a little.&#xD;
Between Bessie and yourself, you are making&#xD;
this alliiir twice as bad as there's any necessity&#xD;
for."&#xD;
"It's harder to bear than you think for,"&#xD;
said Mr. Marks, apologetically. But his face&#xD;
had cleared very much, and he was looking alto-&#xD;
gether ten per cent. better than he did when bis&#xD;
brother-in-law entered the room.&#xD;
"A good many things in this world are hard'&#xD;
to bear," said Mr. Warwick; and-not at all&#xD;
pertinently to the subject of which they were&#xD;
tal~in~-he sighed under his breath. "Well,&#xD;
good-night. I hope you will go to sleep now,&#xD;
and be yourself again in the morning. Rest&#xD;
assured that I am sanguine of recovering the&#xD;
money."&#xD;
He went to his own room, and the first thing&#xD;
he did was to take out his pocket-book, and&#xD;
examine again the fragment of knife-blade which&#xD;
he had found. Then he sat down before the fire,&#xD;
stirred it, absently, put the tongs back into&#xD;
their place, and gazing at the leaping and curl-&#xD;
ing flames, and the glowing cavern that he had&#xD;
made beneath them, he remained for a long time&#xD;
absorbed in deep thought.&#xD;
He rose early the next morning, and at an&#xD;
hour when he was usually asleep, took his way&#xD;
into the village, which was just beginning to&#xD;
show signs of awakening life. Shopkeepers&#xD;
were opening their doors and windows, and&#xD;
&#xD;
193.&#xD;
&#xD;
drowsy-looking servants were sweeping oft' door-&#xD;
steps, and gossiping with each other, as they&#xD;
leaned on their brooms; exchanging items of&#xD;
information concerning the great bank robbery,&#xD;
which was the topic of conversation with white&#xD;
and black in Tallahoma just then.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick paused at the entrance of a&#xD;
store, near the open door of which a negro boy&#xD;
was lazilyshaking a foot-mat, wondering to him-&#xD;
sell the while, "what had brought Mr. Worruek&#xD;
out that time in the morning."&#xD;
"Your master here yet, Bill ?" said the law-&#xD;
yer, pointing into the store.&#xD;
"No, sir-nobody's here yit but me and Mass&#xD;
Jimmy."&#xD;
To his surprise, Mr. Warwick, instead of pass-&#xD;
ing on, entered the door. Probably that gentle-&#xD;
man had never before been conscious of the&#xD;
existence of "little Jimmy Powell ," certainly he&#xD;
had never noticed the boy particularly. But he&#xD;
looked closely now, as he walked into the store,&#xD;
and encountered the gaze of a pair of remarkably&#xD;
quick and intelligent eyes, the owner of which&#xD;
was seated on the front edge of a counter, with&#xD;
one leg doubled under him, while the other dan-&#xD;
gled over, and kept up a swinging, kicking ac-&#xD;
companiment to an air he was whistling. A&#xD;
bright face-altogether not an ordinary boy, Mr.&#xD;
Warwick thought-small for his age; for, though&#xD;
he was thirteen or fourteen at least, his size and&#xD;
delicate physique made him appear a year or two&#xD;
younger.&#xD;
"How are you, Mr. Warwick? Can I do any&#xD;
thing for you this morning, sir?" he said, at&#xD;
once dexterously slipping backward across th~&#xD;
counter, and landing on his feet on the opposite&#xD;
side, where he stood with the attentive and busi-&#xD;
ness air of a well-trained clerk.&#xD;
"Yes, I wish to see some penkuives," said&#xD;
Mr. Warwick, with a half smile a~ the~ serious&#xD;
c1erkli~ess of the little man's manne~.&#xD;
At the word penknives, there w~a flash of&#xD;
intelligence in the boy's face, but h4'said noth-&#xD;
ing. Turning quickly to one of the shelves be-&#xD;
hind him, he took from it a box, which he&#xD;
brought and placed on the counter, and, open-&#xD;
ing it, proceeded silently to display several kinds&#xD;
of knives. Mr. Warwick examined them, one&#xD;
after the other, and finally looked up, or, rather,&#xD;
looked over, at the countenance that was just on&#xD;
a level with his own hands. The expression of&#xD;
that countenance surprised him a little, there&#xD;
was so much shrewd interest and curiosity in it;&#xD;
and yet not vulgar curiosity, either, for the boy&#xD;
restrained it the moment he perceived that it&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="194-195" xml:id="VAC8070-00000103"/>&#xD;
104                              MORTO&#xD;
was observed, replying with modest brevity V&#xD;
the questions as to the price of the knives, whici&#xD;
his customer asked. The latter had been wait&#xD;
ing to see whether the little clerk would volun&#xD;
teer some information which he wished to obtain&#xD;
but, finding that there was no probability of this&#xD;
he now opened the conversation himself as h&#xD;
paid for one of the knives.&#xD;
"You have heard all about the bank-vobbery&#xD;
of course?" he said.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," was the answer; and the bright,&#xD;
brown eyes shot another ray of intelligence, and&#xD;
then looked gravely attentive.&#xD;
"lou know then, probably, that Hugh Ellis&#xD;
thinks he recognized one of the burglars in a&#xD;
man who was in the bank the day before the&#xD;
robbery was committed; and he tells me that&#xD;
the only information he can get about this man&#xD;
is, that a person answering to his description&#xD;
was here in your father's store that same day,&#xD;
and nearly about the same hour, and that you&#xD;
sold a penknife to him, Do you remember what&#xD;
sort of a knife it was?"&#xD;
"It was like the one you have just bought,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
"Aid Youaresure?"&#xD;
"Certain sure, Mr. Warwick."&#xD;
"You recollect selling the knife, then?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Can you describe the man's appearance to&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"He was as tall as you are, sir-maybe a lit-&#xD;
tle taller, for he stood just i~here you are stand.&#xD;
ing now, and I had to look 'way up to see his&#xD;
face. He had sandy, bushy hair, and a very red&#xD;
face, and he was dressed in a shabby suit of&#xD;
black."&#xD;
"Would you have taken him for a gentle.&#xD;
man?'~&#xD;
The boy hesitated.&#xD;
"I hardly know, sir, whether he was or not.&#xD;
He looked something like a gentleman, but-Ms&#xD;
linen was soiled."&#xD;
"What sort of money did he pay for the knife&#xD;
with?"&#xD;
"He offered me a very dirty five-dollar bill&#xD;
that was all torn. But I wouldn't take it, and&#xD;
then he paid in silver."&#xD;
"A flue-dollar bill?" said Mr. Warwick,&#xD;
whose interest had been quickening, and his&#xD;
hopes rising, with each successive reply to his&#xD;
question~. "Did you notice what bill it was-&#xD;
of what bank, I mean?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. He threw it down on the coun.&#xD;
tar, and I took it up and looked at it a min~&#xD;

HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
o ute. It was a 'Commercial Bank of A-'&#xD;
~ note."&#xD;
"Humph I" cried Mr. Warwick. "It must&#xD;
- have been the same fellow who was at the bank.&#xD;
A 'Commercial Bank of A-' note, and very&#xD;
ragged, you say?"&#xD;
3 "Very ragged indeed. I don't think it was&#xD;
a counterfeit," added the boy, thoughtfully;&#xD;
"but it was too ragged to pass anywhere; and&#xD;
so I told him I couldn't take it."&#xD;
"Why did you think of its being counter-&#xD;
I feit?" asked the lawyer, a little surprised at this&#xD;
remark.&#xD;
"Because I didn't like the man's looks, sir,&#xD;
and I thought he mightn't be too good to pass&#xD;
counterfeit money. There's a good deal of it&#xD;
about now, you know. He never once looked&#xD;
me straight in the face, though I tried my best&#xD;
to catch his eyes. But they kept moving about,&#xD;
first to one place, and then to another."&#xD;
"Ah 1" exclaimed Mr. Warwick, with an em-&#xD;
phasis that was almost startling.&#xD;
"Yes, sir. He looked so "-and the boy&#xD;
glanced about him in a quick, uncertain sort of&#xD;
way, rolling his eyes from side to side with a&#xD;
restless movement that brought vividly to Mr.&#xD;
Warwick's recollection the eyes of the quack&#xD;
doctor in Hartsburg.&#xD;
"Do you remember the color of his eyes?"&#xD;
"They were of a light greenish blue, sir."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick stood silent for a full minute,&#xD;
evidently in deep thought. He was trying to&#xD;
recall to mind the appearance of the quack doc-&#xD;
tor; but, with the exception of the restless eyes,&#xD;
his memory was for once totally at fault. He&#xD;
had a general but very vague impression that&#xD;
the man was tall, and that his hair was not&#xD;
"sandy and bushy." Nevertheless, the repre-&#xD;
sentation given of the stranger's eyes-the very&#xD;
pose of the boy's head while rendering the imi-&#xD;
tation-brought back so forcibly the look of&#xD;
Dr. Joyner, as he called himself, that Mr. War.&#xD;
wick felt morally sure that, in common parlance,&#xD;
he had4' struck the trail "-and, it is needless to&#xD;
&#xD;
say, he resolved to pursue it.&#xD;
"Well, Jimmy," he said, looking down with a&#xD;
smile," I think you have given me some valu-&#xD;
able information, and that you can help me st4ll&#xD;
further in this matter, if you are willing to do&#xD;
so.&#xD;
A quick flash came to the upraised face,&#xD;
and the boy's eyes sparkled with eagerness, as&#xD;
he replied: "I wish I could, sir."&#xD;
- "Do you think you would know th~ man if&#xD;
you saw Mm again?"&#xD;
&#xD;
TWO AND TW&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I'd know him anywhere."&#xD;
"You are at the store here all the time, are&#xD;
you not?"&#xD;
Yes, sir." The little fellow sighed as he&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
"I ask, because I should like to see you&#xD;
again after breakfast.. Good-morning for the&#xD;
present.1~&#xD;
"Good.morning, Mr. Warwick,"&#xD;
"By-the-by," said the lawyer, turning back&#xD;
as he was about to cross the threshold1 on his&#xD;
way out of the store; "by-the-by, my little friend,&#xD;
I had rather you did not mention to anybody-&#xD;
excepting your father, if it comes in the way-&#xD;
what I have been asking you, and what you have&#xD;
told me. I want to trace out this man that we&#xD;
have been speaking of, and, in a matter of the&#xD;
kind, talking ruihs every thing."&#xD;
"I know that, Mr. Warwick. I'll not say a&#xD;
word."&#xD;
From Mr. Powell's store the lawyer went&#xD;
the stage.office, as it was called, to find out, if&#xD;
possible, whether the man he was in search of&#xD;
had left Tallahoma by any of the several lines of&#xD;
public conveyances that ran to and from the&#xD;
place-Tallahoma, though in itself an inconsid-&#xD;
erable village, being on one of the principal thor-&#xD;
oughfares of travel in the State. He did not&#xD;
succeed in obtaining any information; and was&#xD;
feeling very much "at sea," as he walked xaed.&#xD;
itatively toward the bank, when, just as he was&#xD;
turning a corner, he met the Chesselton hack&#xD;
coming in. Instantly it flashed upon him, as by&#xD;
an inspiration, that it was more likely a man&#xD;
trying to escape observation would take this,&#xD;
which wan a less public line of travel - more&#xD;
merely local-than those he had been thinking&#xD;
of. The Chesselton hack, he remembered, ran&#xD;
only three times a week, and consequently, though&#xD;
Chesselton was but twenty-eight miles from Tal.&#xD;
lahoma, communication was much less easy and&#xD;
frequent than with &amp;amp;xford, for instance, to&#xD;
which there was a double daily line-both a&#xD;
coach and hack line. To a man ende~voring to&#xD;
evade detection, it was a dcsirable-con*ideration&#xD;
to be as much out of the way of quick communi.&#xD;
cation as possible. The hack left Tallahoma on&#xD;
Tuesday, Thursdays, and Saturdays, returning&#xD;
on the night of the same day it left; that is,&#xD;
making the round trip in twenty-four hours.&#xD;
And the rusty-looking ~rebiele, the appearance&#xD;
of. which had suggested these reflections, had&#xD;
now just arrived from its Thursday trip for the&#xD;
current week. This was Friday morning, and&#xD;
there would be no further mail communication&#xD;
&#xD;
o ~IAKE FOUR.                         105&#xD;
with Chesselton until Saturday-an excellent op.&#xD;
opportunity for a thief who had taken refuge there&#xD;
to make good his escape farther, undoubtedly.&#xD;
These thoughts passed rapidly through Mr.&#xD;
Warwick's mind as he turned and followed the&#xD;
hack to the hotel where it stopped, in order to&#xD;
speak to the driver. He paused at the entrance&#xD;
of the stahle.yard into which the carriage was&#xD;
driven after discharging its passengers at the&#xD;
hotel-door, to wait until the driver descended&#xD;
from his seat.&#xD;
"Gillespie I" he called, as the official seemed&#xD;
likely to prolong interminably his dl~eotiona to&#xD;
and gossip with the hostlers who surr~iunded him&#xD;
and his horses. "Gillespie I "-the man turned&#xD;
to see who had spoken to him-" just step here a&#xD;
minute."&#xD;
"How.d'ye-do, Mr. Worruck? Was it me&#xD;
you was calling' to?" inquired the man, approach.&#xD;
ing him.&#xD;
"Yes, I want to speak to you." He looked&#xD;
round, and, seeing that nobody was within ear-&#xD;
shot, went on: "I am trying to find out some.&#xD;
thing about that bad business which happened&#xD;
night before last at the bank, and I want to&#xD;
know what passengers you took over to Ohes-&#xD;
selton yesterday; whether a fellow who was&#xD;
hanging about town here the day before the rob-&#xD;
bery, and who, Hugh Ellis thinks, was one of the&#xD;
burglars, may not have been among them?"&#xD;
The driver shook his head.&#xD;
"I was keeping' a sharp lookout myself, Mr.&#xD;
Worruck, for I'd like monstously to have the&#xD;
handling' of that five thousand dollars reward&#xD;
that Mr. Marks offered for the apperhension of&#xD;
the thieves "-he chuckled at the bare thought&#xD;
9f handling it-" but I hai.n't seed nobody sence&#xD;
I left Tallyhomy that answered to the descrip-&#xD;
tion of either of 'em, I'm sorry to say. There&#xD;
wasn't as many passengers as usual yesterday&#xD;
Only one old gentleman, and a man and his wife,&#xD;
and-"&#xD;
"But," interrupted Mr. Warwick, "did you&#xD;
take up no passengers by the way?"&#xD;
"I tuk up two; but one was a woman, and&#xD;
the other didn't noways curryspond to the de-&#xD;
scriptions I heard from Mr. Ellis. He didn't.&#xD;
have on black does, nor yit a great.eoat, I&#xD;
noticed particular. And he wore a curous kind&#xD;
a speektlekles sich as I never seed before, that.&#xD;
stood out like a couple of leather cups before his&#xD;
eyes."&#xD;
"Goggles, I suppose? "said Mr. Warwick.&#xD;
"Mebbe so. Anyhow, he didn't answer to&#xD;
the descriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="196-197" xml:id="VAC8070-00000104"/>&#xD;
"How far did he go with you?"&#xD;
"He' stopped a little this side of Chessel-&#xD;
ton."&#xD;
'SAnd did you see any thing of him after-&#xD;
ward?"&#xD;
"Never sot eyes on him after he got out of&#xD;
the hack when I stopped at Spring Creek to&#xD;
water my horses. He said he'd' git out and&#xD;
stretch his legs by walking' the rest of the way,&#xD;
as hewas goin' to a private house in the country&#xD;
nigh by."&#xD;
"Did he have no baggage?"&#xD;
"A black leathertravellin'.bag, not very big,&#xD;
as you may know-for he tuk it into the stage&#xD;
with him, and sot it down betwixt his feet."&#xD;
"And you don't think it likely he was the&#xD;
man Hugh Ellis saw?"&#xD;
"I don't think it noways likely it was the&#xD;
same man, sir."&#xD;
"Did'you notice the color of his hair?"&#xD;
"Well, 'I didn't, Mr. Worruek. But I'll tell&#xD;
you what I'll do. My next trip over I'll see if I&#xD;
cap find out who the fellow was, sei~ce it seems&#xD;
a uliatter of intrust to you."&#xD;
"'~ha~ik you, Gillespie. I shall be obliged if&#xD;
you wrIl~do so. You go over again to-morrow, I&#xD;
bell~ve&#xD;
sir.&#xD;
Aft~, ezohanging a few sentences more, Mr.&#xD;
Warwiok bade Gillespie good-morning, and hur-&#xD;
ried en to the bank.&#xD;
Hugh Ellis was expecting him impatiently.&#xD;
"Pee found something, too, Mr. Warwick,"&#xD;
he said, quite trembling with eagerness, as he&#xD;
held up to view a dark crimson-and-yellow silk&#xD;
&#xD;
ask him," he continued, starting toward the door,&#xD;
carrying the handkerchief; which he held by one&#xD;
corner, fluttering along.&#xD;
"Stop, stop!" said Mr. Warwick. "Look&#xD;
if it has a name on it."&#xD;
Hugh, fingering it rather superciliously, could&#xD;
find no name.&#xD;
"Are silk handkerchiefs ever marked?"&#xD;
"Sometimes. Pu~ it down. I am going to&#xD;
breakfast presently, and I will ask Tom about it.&#xD;
Are you certain that there is nothing else to be&#xD;
found in the room?"&#xD;
"I am certain, sir. I searched the floor first&#xD;
-the whole room, indeed-and then 1 took every&#xD;
thing off the' bed, arid shook the counterpane,&#xD;
and the sheets, and the blankets, each one sep-&#xD;
arately. I even took the pillow-cases and the&#xD;
bolster-case off! I assure you, Mr. Wa~wick, I&#xD;
have looked thoroughly."&#xD;
"Very well. I need not lose any time here,&#xD;
then; and I am very glad of that, for I am going&#xD;
to start to Chesselton directly after breakfast.&#xD;
See here!"&#xD;
He sat down to the table-they were in the&#xD;
cashier's room-and put down' before him the&#xD;
knife which he had just bought frdm Jimmy&#xD;
Powell. Then he took out his pocket-book, pro-&#xD;
duced the fragment of blade, and, opening the&#xD;
knife, he playedd the fragment upon the whole'&#xD;
blade. Hugh uttered an exclamation as lie saw&#xD;
that the two were identical in every respect, even&#xD;
to the brilliant newness of the metal. 'Mi'. War-&#xD;
wick explained in as few words as possible all&#xD;
that he' had learned from Jimmy Powell, and&#xD;
what he had since heard from the stage-driver.&#xD;

"He may have changed his dress, and put on f handkerchief that was considerably worn, and&#xD;
the goggles to avoid detection," said the lawyer. j not a little soiled from use. "I got up as soon&#xD;

"A stout fellow. Six fcet-more'n that, I dropped it."&#xD;
reckon."                                      "It may have been dropped by some of the&#xD;
"Where did you take him np?"            people who were here yesterday."&#xD;
"At Moonie's-.--the second stnge.house from  "No, sir; impossible. Nobody was in my&#xD;
here, you know,"                           room. I shut the door and looked it."&#xD;
"Twe~y miles from here, is it not?"         "It may be Tom's."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, twenty miles - and good ones,   "I don't think so," said Hugh, decidedly;&#xD;
too."                                      but he looked a little crestfallen. "I'll go and&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now," he said, when he had concluded his&#xD;
relation, "I am going somewhat upon a venture,&#xD;
which I am not in the habit of doing; but I have&#xD;
an instinct, amounting to a positive conviction,&#xD;
that the man you saw, the man who bought this&#xD;
knife from young Powell" - he touched the&#xD;
broken blade-" the man whom Gillespie de.&#xD;
scribes as wearing green goggles, and a quack&#xD;
doctor that I met last week in Hartsburg, and&#xD;
who, a day or two after I saw him, had to take&#xD;
French leave of the place to escape being&#xD;
lynched, are all one and the same individual;&#xD;
and 1 shall take young Powell, who says be can&#xD;
identify the rascal, and see if I can't find him. I&#xD;
hope," he added, as he rose to go, "that-Well,&#xD;
Tom, what's the matter?"&#xD;
Tom, who had at that moment appeared in&#xD;
the open door, responded to this question by&#xD;
another.&#xD;
"Mistiss say ain't you comm' home to break.&#xD;
fast this mornin', Mass John?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am just going now. is this your&#xD;
handkerchief 1"'&#xD;
He took up the article in question, and, hold-&#xD;
ing it as Hugh Ellis had done, by one corner,&#xD;
exhibited it to the servant as he advanced.&#xD;
"' Mine? No, sir," answered Tom, with sur-&#xD;
prise. "I never saw it before, Mass John."&#xD;
"Well, Hugh, I'll take it and see if I can&#xD;
discover the owner."&#xD;
He looked round, picked up a newspaper,&#xD;
and, wrapping up the handker4tie!~, consigned it&#xD;
to his coat-pocket.&#xD;
"I shall not see you again before I start,&#xD;
Hugh, so good-by. How are you feeling this&#xD;
morning, on the whole?"&#xD;
"Dreadfully stiff; sir. I ache all over. Wit&#xD;
I don't mind that, so those infernal scoundrels&#xD;
are brought to taw, and we setback the money."&#xD;
He said this as he walked to the door with&#xD;
Mr. Warwick, who paused there to shake hands&#xD;
and give him one parting caution.&#xD;
"Not a word to anybody about the knife or&#xD;
about my movements. In one word, hold your&#xD;
tongue."&#xD;
"Trust me to do that, sir."&#xD;
Mr. Marks was just leaving the breakfast.&#xD;
table, when his brother-in-law entered the room.&#xD;
The little Markacs, sitting demure and silent-&#xD;
they had been involuntary penitents during the&#xD;
four.and.twenty hours preceding-all started up&#xD;
with irrepressible and rapturous cries of "Unky I&#xD;
unky! Here's unky!"&#xD;
Even the unnaturally-solemn visage of the&#xD;
cashier relax~ into a smile as the little folk&#xD;
&#xD;
bounded tumultuously forward, each eager to&#xD;
get "unky's" first greetings; and Mrs. Marks's&#xD;
face beamed for a moments But, before the&#xD;
said greetings were over, Mr. Marks looked as&#xD;
saturnine as ever, and his devoted helpmeet was&#xD;
applying her handkerchief to her eyes.&#xD;
"Don't go yet, Richard; I have a word to&#xD;
say to you presently," said Mr. Warwick, as ho&#xD;
saw the former about to leave~ the room.-&#xD;
"Well, bairns, have you missed unky much?"&#xD;
"Oh, that we have! that we have I" was the&#xD;
unanimous and rather stunningly vociferous re-&#xD;
ply. "We-"&#xD;
"Hush, this minute, children!" cried their&#xD;
mother, whose temper had not improved since&#xD;
her brother's departure, a month before. "Do&#xD;
you want to deafen your uncle? Go along out&#xD;
now; he has other things to think about than&#xD;
your nonsense. Go along, all of you !-and,&#xD;
John, do come to breakfast!"&#xD;
"In a minute," answered her brother, with-&#xD;
out moi~ing from where he stood, just inside the&#xD;
door, surrounded by the children, who were,&#xD;
every one, clinging to him-Jack and Dick hav-&#xD;
ing seized each an arm, Sara and Katy having.&#xD;
possession of his hands respectively, while poor&#xD;
little Nelly had nothing for it but to clasp her&#xD;
two little fat arms round his knee in an ecstasy&#xD;
of noisy delight. He looked down on them with&#xD;
a smile which was like sunshine to their little&#xD;
hearts, as he listened to their rejoicings at his&#xD;
return. But again Mrs. Marks began~ a sharp&#xD;
remonstrance and command to them.&#xD;
"Do let them alone Besale!" said Mr. War-&#xD;
wick, a little sharp in turn.-" Here, Sara-hold&#xD;
your hand."&#xD;
Sara's hand was extended with astonishing&#xD;
quickness, while all the others were breathless&#xD;
with expectation.&#xD;
"Now, is it honor bright?" asked their&#xD;
uncle, appealing to them generally.&#xD;
"Yes, unky, honor bright! honor bright!"&#xD;
"Then, take this key, Sara, and see what&#xD;
you can find in my valise. Go, all of you, and&#xD;
stay in my room till I come. But mind-Sara is&#xD;
to take the things out and put them on the table,&#xD;
and you must all keep quiet and wait patiently."&#xD;
"Honor bright!" responded they, in a breath,&#xD;
and were gone.&#xD;
"Bessie, do you think it worth while to punish&#xD;
those poor children for the 'fault of the thieves&#xD;
who broke into the bank?" said Mr. Warwick,&#xD;
as he sat down to the breakfast-table.&#xD;
"Punish them, John? I don't know what&#xD;
you mean! I haven't been punishing them."&#xD;

"Yes, you have, and in the worst possible&#xD;
way-by cloudy looks and unmerited reproof. I&#xD;
wish you would remember what I said to you&#xD;
la~it night."&#xD;
Mrs. Marks looked conscience-stricken, and&#xD;
Mr. Warwick turned to her husband, who stood&#xD;
by the fire, waiting for the word that his brother-&#xD;
in-law had for him.&#xD;
"I have got what I believe to be a clew,&#xD;
Mi~ks, and I shall start immediately after break.&#xD;
fast to follow it up. I don't know when I shall&#xD;
be back-!..in a day or two, perhaps; but it is not&#xD;
certain. All I can tell you is, that I intend* to&#xD;
track dei~n those scoundrels. So, keep up your&#xD;
spirits. You will find that this matter will all&#xD;
come out right at last."&#xD;
"You really think so?" asked Mr. Marks, a&#xD;
little doubtfully&#xD;
"I am sure of it. Did you ever know me to&#xD;
be mistaken in an opinion which I expressed&#xD;
deliberately?"&#xD;
"Why, no; I never did."&#xD;
"Rely on my opinion in this, then. If I am&#xD;
absent more than a day or two, I will write. Are&#xD;
you going to the bank now? If so, I will say&#xD;
good-by, as I have ordered my buggy to be ready&#xD;
by the time I have finished breakfast."&#xD;
"I'll see you off," said Mr. Marks, drawing a&#xD;
chair toward the fire, and sitting down. "There's&#xD;
no hurry aboutmy getting to the bank," he added,&#xD;
disconsolately.&#xD;
"Where are y~u going, John?" asked Mrs.&#xD;
Marks. /&#xD;
"I am going first to Morton House to see&#xD;
Mrs, Gordon for a few minutes," answered Mr.&#xD;
Warwick, evasively. "By-the-way, J3essie-"&#xD;
But Bessie, to whom the mention of Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon's name recalled the remembrance of the&#xD;
domestic trouble which had so much afflicted hex~&#xD;
-before the more important misfortune of the&#xD;
bank robbery occurred, and dwarfed its import-&#xD;
ance, indeed drove it entirely from her mind for&#xD;
the time being-interrupted him eagerly.&#xD;
"0 John," she cried, "every thing has been&#xD;
going wrong Since you left home I Would you&#xD;
believe that Miss Tresham went away the Friday&#xD;
after you left, and, though she was to have come&#xD;
back on Monday, she's never made her appear.&#xD;
anee from that day to this? and, what's more,&#xD;
we haven't heard one syllable about her!&#xD;
What's become of her, I can't understand,&#xD;
for-"&#xD;
"Do you recollect what I told you, Warwick,&#xD;
the day she drew her salary at the bank, and&#xD;
wanted it in gold? I remarked to you then&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.&#xD;
that I suspected ahe was going to leave us; and,&#xD;
you see, I was right," said Mr. Marks, to whom it&#xD;
was quite a satisfaction-a little ray of light in&#xD;
the very dark sky that loomed over him-.to be&#xD;
able thus to vindicate so triumphantly, particu-&#xD;
larly to his brother-in-law, the correctness of his&#xD;
judgment.&#xD;
"I remember your saying you were afraid&#xD;
she would leave you," replied Mr. Warwick.&#xD;
"And you ha~re no idea why she left- have&#xD;
heard nothing from her?"&#xD;
"Not a word-not the scrape of a pen!"&#xD;
cried Mrs. Marks, volubly. "All her things are&#xD;
here yet-two trunks, and ever so many&#xD;
"You know she drew a thousand dollars in&#xD;
gold from me on Tuesday," Mr. Marks here broke&#xD;
in, with an animation which he had not exhib-&#xD;
ited before, since the first suspicion of the bank&#xD;
robbery had dawned on his horrified apprehen-&#xD;
sion. "Well, on Friday, when she was going off,&#xD;
she borrowed ten dollar.r from Bessie! Think of&#xD;
that-..-ten dollars! Now, I saythat there's some-&#xD;
thing wrong about all this-one way or another-&#xD;
and I made up my mind that, if she didn't come&#xD;
back at the time she said, and couldn't give a satis-&#xD;
factory account of why she went-"&#xD;
"She went to see the priest, Richard-she&#xD;
said so!" cried Mrs. Marks, who was still some-&#xD;
what of a partisan of Katharine's.&#xD;
"Yes, she said so," answereAl Mr. Marks, dry-&#xD;
ly. "But she didn't say what was the reason&#xD;
this St. John - you remember the man you&#xD;
warned me about, Warwick, when you met him&#xD;
as he was going out of the bank that day?"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick nodded.&#xD;
"Well, there is some connection-"&#xD;
Here Mrs. Marks's eagerness grew quite un-&#xD;
controllable, and she dashed into the conversa-&#xD;
tion-taking the floor by storm from her more&#xD;
quiet husband-and proceeded to pour out the&#xD;
whole story of St. John's visit to Katharine im-&#xD;
mediately on her return from Annesdale: Mrs~&#xD;
Gordon's having come in while St. John was&#xD;
there; what Mrs. Gordon had said; Katharine's&#xD;
hasty departure; Morton Annesley's call; St.&#xD;
John's call; Mrs. Annesley's call; St. John's&#xD;
second call, and the manner in which the latter&#xD;
had persisted ever since in persecuting the&#xD;
whole family, in the effort to obtain information&#xD;
of Katharine's whereabouts; her own solemn&#xD;
conviction that Katharine had gone away t~ get&#xD;
rid of St. John, and that she would never come&#xD;
back while he remained in Tallahoma; and Mr.&#xD;
Marks's obstinate resolution not to. receive her&#xD;
again into his family, if she did come back.&#xD;

TWO AND TWO MAKE FOUR.&#xD;

199&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Warwick listened in attentive silence, and&#xD;
had finished his breakfast before the narration&#xD;
was concluded. When Mrs. Marks finally stopped&#xD;
an instant to take breath, he turned to her hus-&#xD;
band.&#xD;
"Has it never occurred to you that Miss&#xD;
Tresham might have been detained away acci-&#xD;
dentally?"&#xD;
"Never!" answered Mr. Marks, emphatical-&#xD;
ly. "It only occurs to me that there's some-&#xD;
thing wrong. I'm sure of it; and, though I&#xD;
don't know what it is, I'll have nothing more to&#xD;
do with Miss Tresham. I told Bessie at the time&#xD;
that it was a risky business to be engaging a&#xD;
governess without knowing any thing about her.&#xD;
I have no idea that Miss Tresham will ever re-&#xD;
turn here; but, if she walked into the room this&#xD;
minute, she should not stay very long. I'm done&#xD;
with her."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick said nothing. He did nothave&#xD;
time to argue the question just then, and, in fact,&#xD;
what could he have said? Perfectly ignorant of&#xD;
Katharine's motives, or the reasons which she&#xD;
might be able to give for her apparently singular&#xD;
conduct, he thought it best to be silent as to his&#xD;
knowledge of her present place of sojourn. He&#xD;
could only conjecture that Mrs. Marks's suspicion&#xD;
of her having left Tallahoma to avoid St. John&#xD;
was correct, and, as he had but a moderate&#xD;
opinion of Mrs. Marks's powers of reticence-&#xD;
or, indeed, of the capacity of people in general&#xD;
in that particular-he judged it most prudent to&#xD;
leave matters as they were-at least, until his&#xD;
return from the journey which he was about tak-&#xD;
ing. Unwilling as he had been to entertain the&#xD;
suspicion suggested by Mrs. Gordon concerning&#xD;
St. John, he had found it impossible to put the~&#xD;
idea from him, notwithstanding that the evidence&#xD;
of Hugh Ellis as to the appearance of the bur-&#xD;
glars went far to discredit its probability. The&#xD;
correctness of Hugh's observation in the case&#xD;
of one of the two-which Mr. Warwick consid-&#xD;
ered fully corroborated by the testimony of the&#xD;
little Powell-entitled his statement to respect,&#xD;
and a little staggered the intuitive conviction,&#xD;
which had steadily been gaining ground in Mr.&#xD;
Warwick's mind, that Mrs. Gordon was right.&#xD;
Yet still, that conviction was only staggered, not&#xD;
done away with; and, though he thought it neces-&#xD;
sary to follow the clew which he had obtained,&#xD;
and which, so far as he was aware, did not p~int&#xD;
to St. John as a participant is the outrage, he&#xD;
was exceedingly anxious that the man should&#xD;
not leave Tallahoma during his own absence, and&#xD;
anxious, tlso, that he should continue ignorant&#xD;
&#xD;
of Katharine's movements. Therefore, he would&#xD;
not risk any thing, he thought, by premature can-&#xD;
dor. When the affair of the robbery was off his&#xD;
hands, he would take up this mystery about the&#xD;
governess, and see if he could not unravel it.&#xD;
So, without a word upon the subject, he rose, and,&#xD;
after a few more encouraging assurances that he&#xD;
would "bring the business" (of the robbery)&#xD;
"all straight," he took leave of the Markses,&#xD;
senior and junior, and, entering the buggy,&#xD;
which was at the gate, told Cyrus to drive to&#xD;
Mr. Powell's store.&#xD;
As he was passing the hotel, his quick eye&#xD;
caught sight of St. John on the bench that ran&#xD;
along the wall from end to end of the long&#xD;
piazza (for the convenience of the loungers who&#xD;
there did congregate at all times and seasons)&#xD;
engaged in what, to appearance, was the busi-&#xD;
ness of his life-smoking. He sat apart fz~m a&#xD;
group of noisy talkers, but near enough to enjoy&#xD;
the benefit of hearing their conversation.&#xD;
No sooner did Mr. Warwick appear in sight,&#xD;
than one of these gentlemen of leisure, a brother&#xD;
lawyer, started up, and stepped to the edge of&#xD;
the piazza to exchange a word with him as he&#xD;
passed.&#xD;
"Warwick! A moment, will you, War-&#xD;
wick!" cried he. "I did not know that you&#xD;
were back. When did you arrive?"&#xD;
"Yesterday evening," answered Mr. War-&#xD;
wick, as he stopped and shook hands cordially.&#xD;
"But I am off again, you see."&#xD;
"Ah?" said the other, with some surprise.&#xD;
"I thought you would have gone to work about&#xD;
the robbery. Don't you intend to hunt down&#xD;
those scoundrels?"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick smiled. "You know my faith&#xD;
in the old saw, 'Give a thief rope enough, and&#xD;
he is sure to hang himself.'"&#xD;
Mr. Ashe~-the legal brother-smiled also,&#xD;
and very significantly; though, as he stood with&#xD;
his back to the group in the piazza, nobody but&#xD;
Mr Warwick himself perceived the smileor the&#xD;
glance that accompanied it. He knew Mr. War-&#xD;
wick's faith in the said proverb; but he knew&#xD;
also that Mr. Warwick invariably took the pre.&#xD;
caution, In eases of the kind, to hold the end of&#xD;
the rope in his own hand-and shrewdly suspect-&#xD;
ed that he was not departing from his usual cus-&#xD;
tom on the present occasion. A few general&#xD;
remarks followed after this-Mr. Ashe judicious-&#xD;
ly refraining from indiscreet questions and&#xD;
then Mr. Warwick, pleading haste, went on his&#xD;
way. But he had taken theopportunity during&#xD;
the moment in which he was stationary almost&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="200-201" xml:id="VAC8070-00000106"/>&#xD;
200                              MORTON&#xD;
directly in front of St. John-for he had not&#xD;
stopped the buggy until it passed a few feet be-&#xD;
yond the group of loungers-to cast one or two&#xD;
rapid, apparently careless, but in reality very&#xD;
keen glances at that personage. Glances which&#xD;
were returned with interest-since, on more than&#xD;
one account, the lawyer was an object of no&#xD;
common regard to the scheming adventurer.&#xD;
This was the man who had spirited away Felix&#xD;
Gordon-this the man who, according to the&#xD;
unanimous belief of his townsmen, "would soon&#xD;
ferret out the bank thieves." St. John had no&#xD;
particular, or, rather, no personal knowledge of&#xD;
Mr. Warwick's character; but he had heard&#xD;
enough about it in the discussions concerning&#xD;
the bank robbery, which were in everybody's&#xD;
mouth, to excite his apprehension.&#xD;
"Yet," thought he, moQdily watching the&#xD;
smoke, as it curled away from his lips, "what&#xD;
can the man do 1"' And then he went over in&#xD;
his mind all the precautions against detection&#xD;
which his comrade had so elaborately adopted;&#xD;
he remembered that this comrade was accom.&#xD;
pushed in the art of deceiving London and Pari-&#xD;
sian detectives; and he smiled cynically at the&#xD;
ider~ of a village-lawyer in "this d-d backwoods&#xD;
country," being able to outwit such an adept in&#xD;
his profession. For himself, he had not the&#xD;
slightest uneasiness. His figure had been so&#xD;
effectually disguised by much clothing and a&#xD;
heavy blanket-overcoat, that nobody, he was cer-&#xD;
tain, would ever imagine that the tall, slender,&#xD;
and elegant form, so familiar now to Tallahoma&#xD;
eyes, could have been transformed into that of&#xD;
Burglar No. 2, whose portrait passed from lip&#xD;
to lip as "short and square-built; just about&#xD;
such a looking man as Mr. Shields."&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mr. Warwick drove on a square&#xD;
or two, and stopped'bcfore Mr. Powell's store.&#xD;
"Is your father in, Jimmy?" he said, as the&#xD;
boy hurried forward to meet him.&#xD;
"Yes, sir. Will you walk into the counting-&#xD;
room I"'&#xD;
He led the way to a glass door at the farther&#xD;
extremity of the store, opened it, ushered in the&#xD;
lawyer, and closed it again-looking regretfully,&#xD;
as he did so, at the curtain which concealed the&#xD;
interior of the apartment from his view. He had&#xD;
scarcely returned to his place near the entrance&#xD;
of the store, however, before the folds of this&#xD;
curtain were pulled aside, and he saw his father's&#xD;
hand beckoning to him. All elate, he bounded&#xD;
down the long room, and disappeared from the&#xD;
gaze of the wondering clerks. A few minutes&#xD;
afterward, the door was again opened, and Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Warwick, Mr. Powell, and Jimmy, all issued forth&#xD;
-the face of the latter beaming with pleasure.&#xD;
"I am very much obliged to you, Powell,"&#xD;
said Mr. Warwick, as they walked toward the&#xD;
door. "I'll take good care of Jimmy, and bring&#xD;
him safe back, I promise you."&#xD;
"I don't doubt that, Mr. Warwick. Always&#xD;
glad to accommodate you in any way, sir; and&#xD;
particularly glad in this case-for Marks's sake&#xD;
as well as your own. I only hope Jimmy may be&#xD;
of use to you."&#xD;
They shook hands, and Mr. Warwick, relinter-&#xD;
ing his buggy, pursued his way in one direction,&#xD;
while Jimmy, after also shaking hands with his&#xD;
father, and receiving a few parting injunctions&#xD;
from him, walked off in another.&#xD;
The latter went home, and, as Mr. Warwick&#xD;
had advised, put his tooth-brush and a change&#xD;
of linen into a pocket of his overcoat, and then&#xD;
proceeded, by a short cut through the woods, to&#xD;
Morton House. So correctly had Mr. Warwick&#xD;
reckoned the time which his own and the boy's&#xD;
movements would require, that, just as he drove&#xD;
out of the Morton domain, Jimmy emerged from&#xD;
the wood on the opposite side of the road, and&#xD;
joined him.&#xD;
"I give you credit for your punctuality," he&#xD;
said, with a smile. "Let me have the reins,&#xD;
Cyrus. I shall be back in a day or two. t4ood-&#xD;
by.-Up with you, Jimmy-this side."&#xD;
H~ drove oft; down the Saxford road, and kept&#xD;
it for several miles; then he took a fork to the&#xD;
left, and, after pursuing this for some miles far&#xD;
ther, emerged into the Chesselton road.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
CHECKMATED.&#xD;
Ox Saturday afternoon, St John took hia&#xD;
usual sunset stroll, which invariably led him&#xD;
past the Marks residence, into the country tow-&#xD;
ard Morton House. He was in good spirits-in&#xD;
high spirits, in fact-for, by the Chesselton mail&#xD;
of the morning beTore, he had received a letter&#xD;
posted at the stage-house from which Gillespie&#xD;
had taken up his goggle-wearing passenger (a&#xD;
country post-office, as well as stage-house), ad-&#xD;
vising him of the safety thus far of his associate.&#xD;
Added to this, he was under the impression that&#xD;
Mr. Warwick had "gone off on a wrong scent."&#xD;
Not an hour had elapsed from the time at which&#xD;
that. gentleman halted for a moment at the hotel&#xD;
piazza to speak to his friend Mr. Ashe, before&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
CHIEOKMATED-&#xD;
&#xD;
the group of loungers were discussing the fact of&#xD;
his having taken Jimmy Powell an~l started to&#xD;
Saxford. Everybody had heard Hugh Ellis's ac-&#xD;
count of the man who was at the bank with the&#xD;
ragged note, and was aware that Jimmy Powell&#xD;
believed he had seen the same man, on the same&#xD;
day, in his father's store; it was known that Mr.&#xD;
Warwick had been at the stage-office, making the&#xD;
most minutely particular inquiries; and some-&#xD;
body had met Mr. Warwick with Jimmy Powell&#xD;
in his buggy, travelling toward Saxford. With&#xD;
such circumstantial evidence, the inference was&#xD;
clear, thought the gossiping loungers and their&#xD;
interested auditor-Mr. Warwick had gone to&#xD;
Saxford in pursuit of the burglars, and had&#xD;
taken the boy along to identify the one he had&#xD;
seen. And while Mr. Warwick's admiring&#xD;
townsfolk exulted in anticipation at the suc-&#xD;
cess which they were sure awaited him,&#xD;
St. John smiled to himself sarcastically, and&#xD;
with intense satisfaction, at the failure which&#xD;
1w was as confident the lawyer would meet&#xD;
with.&#xD;
He was thinking of this failure, congratulat-&#xD;
ing his confr~lre in crime and himself on the ad-&#xD;
mirable conception and execution of their daring&#xD;
exploit, and altogether in a better hi~mor with&#xD;
Fortune than he had been for many a d~ty before,&#xD;
when a curve in the road he was pursuing, broug1it~&#xD;
him into an open and rather elevated space of&#xD;
ground, over which a crimson light from the&#xD;
blazing western sky was at the moment stream-&#xD;
lag. St. John was no lover of Nature. He did&#xD;
not turn to admire the magnificent sunset; but&#xD;
having just emerged from between two walls of&#xD;
lofty and dense forest, which had made an almost&#xD;
twilight gloom around him, he was surprised 'to&#xD;
find that the sun was not yet set, and he paused&#xD;
an instant to look at his watch. As he stood&#xD;
motionless, his figure was so clearly defined in&#xD;
the broad light, and against the background of&#xD;
sun-gilded forest, that Mr. Warwick, who was&#xD;
advancing from the opposite direction, though at&#xD;
least a quarter of a mile distant from the place&#xD;
where he stood, recognized the slender and ele-&#xD;
gant form at once. As it chanced that he was&#xD;
just approaching the gates of Morton House, he&#xD;
checked his horses.&#xD;
"I~have business here that I must stop to&#xD;
attend to," he said. "I suppose you can drive&#xD;
on to town alone, Jimmy?"&#xD;
"Certainly, sir."&#xD;
"You will find Cyrus at my office. Just&#xD;
hand the horses over to him." He alighted, and&#xD;
held out his hand with a cordial smile. "I shall&#xD;
&#xD;
201&#xD;
&#xD;
not forget the service you have rendered me,&#xD;
my boy. Good-evening."&#xD;
St. John, discovering that it was so much ear-&#xD;
lier than he had thought, walked on, with his&#xD;
eyes on the ground, as was his habit, and his&#xD;
thoughts still dwelling upon the success of his&#xD;
late "venture." He Was considering whether it&#xD;
would not be safest to destroy the paper, rather&#xD;
than run the risk of detection at any future time&#xD;
in attempting to pass it. This question had&#xD;
already been discussed by his associate and him.&#xD;
self; for, even before he had heard of the pre-&#xD;
cautions taken by the cashier to stop the notes,&#xD;
he was aware of the danger attending the illicit&#xD;
possession of bank-paper. But it had been de-&#xD;
cided to keep it, on the chance of being able to&#xD;
realize at least a part of it, af~qr the excitement&#xD;
about the robbery had blowIl over. He had in-&#xD;
tended to insist on one ~%oin~-that not a dollar&#xD;
of it should be used, until he himself was safe&#xD;
out of the country. His own safety once assured,&#xD;
he was not uncomfortably solicitous about that&#xD;
of the man whom he regarded merely as a tool&#xD;
forced upon him by Fate.&#xD;
Engrossed in meditations so interesting, Mr.&#xD;
St. John gave but the most careless glance at the&#xD;
buggy be met and passed. He had left behind&#xD;
him the sunny knoll which had betrayed his pres-&#xD;
ence to Mr. Warwick, as the road again entered&#xD;
between aisles of thick forest growth, when sud-&#xD;
denly he lifted his eyes with a sense of instinc-&#xD;
tive apprehension, and perceived at a distance of&#xD;
fifteen or twenty yards before him on his path,&#xD;
and advancing at a quick pace toward him, a&#xD;
man he instantly recognized as the lawyer whom&#xD;
he had supposed to be atthat very time in Sax-&#xD;
ford. He was startled-so much startled, that,&#xD;
for once, presence of mind deserted him. He&#xD;
turned and began to retrace his way to the vil-&#xD;
lage, hoping thus to 'avoid the Jnost transient&#xD;
meeting with a man for whom he had felt, from&#xD;
the first moment he ever saw him, a sense' of&#xD;
unequivocal distrust - a distrust amounting to&#xD;
positive fear under present circumstances. After&#xD;
a moment or t*o, he felt somewhat reassured&#xD;
from his first panic. What pretext could the&#xD;
man find for addressing him? So thinking, he&#xD;
walked more slowly, and endeavored to collect&#xD;
himself to meet with a properly supercilious&#xD;
wonder any salutation which the lawyer might&#xD;
make. But notwithstanding his resolution&#xD;
his heart beat quickly, as near and nearer be-&#xD;
hind sounded the sharp, firm tread that was&#xD;
overtaking him rapidly. Just as he had left&#xD;
the forest shade once more, and stood in the&#xD;

&#xD;
full light of the setting sun, a voice at his side&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Good-evening, Mr. St. John."&#xD;
Ho turned with an air of affected surprise,&#xD;
cast a single glance at the speaker, responded&#xD;
coldly, "Good-evening," and fell back a pace,&#xD;
with the obvious intention of letting the other&#xD;
pass on. But Mr. Warwick, instead of taking&#xD;
the hint, stepped a little forward, and faced so&#xD;
as to impede the, way.&#xD;
"This chance meeting has saved me the trou-&#xD;
ble of hunting you up in Tallahoma, Mr. St.&#xD;
,John," he said, quietly. "We will sit down on&#xD;
this log, ~f you please. I have something to say&#xD;
to you~"&#xD;
The tone, the manner, above all, the expres-&#xD;
sion of those p1 lug blue eyes, struck terror to&#xD;
theguilt~man's I. He quailed for an instant;&#xD;
but, rallying then~y great effort, answered&#xD;
sneeringly:&#xD;
"Really, sir, you are very obliging. But, to&#xD;
the~best of my recollection, I have not the honor&#xD;
of ygur acquaintance. You probably mistake me&#xD;
for some other person."&#xD;
Re would have moved on, but the tall form&#xD;
of the lawyer effect~xally barred the way. The&#xD;
only possibility of e~cape'~was by positive flight;&#xD;
and reckless~ and, morally degraded as St. John&#xD;
was, there still remained with him one at least&#xD;
of the instincts of gentlcmanhood.-courage. Re&#xD;
couhi not fly from an adversary: on the contrary,&#xD;
the very sense of open antagonism gave to him an&#xD;
unaffected boldness of bearing and of feeling,&#xD;
which the consciousness of crime had almost par-&#xD;
alyzed the moment before. He met Mr. War-&#xD;
wick's eye unflinchingly, as he said with super.&#xD;
cilious auteur:&#xD;
"What is the meaning of this insolence,&#xD;
sir?"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick smiled. '~ I am a little prema-&#xD;
ture, I admit, in claiming your acquaintance," he&#xD;
said, in so 'ordinary a tone that only a very nice&#xD;
ear could have detected an inflection of mockery&#xD;
in it; "but I have a little document to present to&#xD;
you, which will correct the infermalit~-a letter&#xD;
of intred~sction from your friend Mr. Gilbert Di-&#xD;
* dier, alias Dr. Joyner, edias Mr. Johnson, alias&#xD;
etc., etc., etc., ad itujnittsm, I have no doubt."&#xD;
He took out his pocket-book deliberately-&#xD;
though he kept his eye on St. John-opened it&#xD;
and produced a small, scaled note, which he ex-&#xD;
tended.&#xD;
St. John did not move to take it. His sallow&#xD;
face had grown actually livid, and he reeled as he&#xD;
stood, almost like one drunken. Mr. Warwick&#xD;
&#xD;
had the character ol' being a hare man; but, as he&#xD;
gazed at thh cowering form that only a moment&#xD;
before had worn so brave a front, an expression&#xD;
very much like that of compassion passed over&#xD;
his face. It vanished, however, as he saw the&#xD;
instinct of the bravo flash into the eyes of the&#xD;
detected criminal. Re was prepared for this;&#xD;
and, as St. John plunged his hand into his bos-&#xD;
om, he himself threw forward his right hand, and&#xD;
St. John, before he saw the weapon, heard the click&#xD;
of a pistol as it wa~ cocked.&#xD;
"If you.withdraw your hand, I fire," said the&#xD;
lawyer, in a tone not to be misunderstood. "You&#xD;
see that, in every sense, you are in my power-&#xD;
in my power absolutely. If y~u wish to save&#xD;
your life and your reputation, you will not at-&#xD;
tempt useless resistance, but will follow the&#xD;
example of your associate whom I yesterday even-&#xD;
ing caused to be arrested and lodged in Chessel-&#xD;
ton Jail for the late robbery of the bank at Tal-&#xD;
lahoma, and who has confessed his guilt."&#xD;
Re paused, and, with his pistol still covering&#xD;
St. John's person, waited for an answer-waited&#xD;
~patiently enough, for he saw that a terrible strug-&#xD;
gle was going on in the mind of the miserable&#xD;
man, and he believed it would end in the man-&#xD;
nerhe wished. So he stood, watchful but patient,&#xD;
as the thin and now fearfully pallid face worked&#xD;
with a convulsive passion frightful to behold.&#xD;
Suddenly the face grew calm, settling into an ex-&#xD;
pression of half-sullen despair, of half-fierce de-&#xD;
fiance.&#xD;
"What are your proofs against me 7" he&#xD;
asked, with a directness which elicited Mr. War-&#xD;
wick's respect for his discretion in thus coming&#xD;
at once-to an understanding of his position.&#xD;
"Your promissory note in your own name to&#xD;
Didier, 'for one-half the specie secured in your&#xD;
late enterprise on the bank at Tallahoma '-I&#xD;
quote, you perceive, the wording of the note it-&#xD;
self-with an acknowledgment that the whole&#xD;
amount of money stolen is in your possession,&#xD;
and that the paper shall be disposed of as here-&#xD;
after agreed between Didier and yourself," was&#xD;
the reply, in a perfectly dispassionate and busi-&#xD;
ness-like tone.&#xD;
St. John gnashed his teeth.&#xD;
"Also," continued Mr. Warwick, in the same&#xD;
tone, "a letter of date of Thursday morning&#xD;
last, purporting to be from James Smith to&#xD;
Thomas Johnson, advising the latter that 'busi-&#xD;
ness goes on prosperously,' and so forth. The&#xD;
writing of this letter (though some attempt at&#xD;
disguising the hand was made), and the paper&#xD;
upon which it was written, would be recognized&#xD;
&#xD;
by a court of law as identical with those of the&#xD;
promissory note."&#xD;
"The vile hound, so he betrayed me!" ex-&#xD;
claimed St. John, more to himself than to Mr.&#xD;
Warwick.&#xD;
But the latter answered:&#xD;
"Joyner, or Didier, you mean, I suppose?&#xD;
No; Ialways give the devil his due. He did not&#xD;
betray you. I don't think he could have been&#xD;
induced to do so. I obtained the evidence I hold&#xD;
very much against his will by- Read his note.&#xD;
That, I presume, will explain."&#xD;
Once more he held the note toward St. John,&#xD;
and the latter, withdrawing his hand from his&#xD;
bosom, this time condescended to take it, though&#xD;
with an air of disdain. Tearing it hastily open,&#xD;
he read as follows:&#xD;
"Don't think that I betrayed you, St. John.&#xD;
I did not even make the slightest admission about'&#xD;
n~self until after this infernal lawyer-curse&#xD;
hi~ I Curse his whole tribe, for they are the&#xD;
same all the world over, from Lincoln's Inn to&#xD;
this damned out-of-the-way hole that 1 am caged&#xD;
in! I was going to say that I did not make thc&#xD;
t4ightest admission about myself, much less about&#xD;
you, until after all was up by his discovery of the&#xD;
false bottom' in my instrument-box that I showed&#xD;
you. I had stowed your note and letter in there&#xD;
for safety. I had hoped that you would escape&#xD;
with the money, for there was nothing to crimi-&#xD;
nate you, ~r even to suggest a suspicion against&#xD;
you, until this infernal law-ferret scented out&#xD;
the box,' and got possession of your note, and&#xD;
the tools that are my letters of credit and open.&#xD;
sesame into banks and out of prisons. After that&#xD;
it was no good in holding out, and I made the&#xD;
best terms I could with him for you as well as&#xD;
myself. Take my advice, and follow my example.&#xD;
You; will get off easy if you make no difficulty&#xD;
about giving up the money, which is lost to us&#xD;
anyhow, and it' will make considerable difference&#xD;
for me. Don't get into one of your devil's hu-&#xD;
more and refuse to listen to reason. You see h~&#xD;
has evidence to convict you. And you owe it to&#xD;
me to do all you can for me, as I would have done&#xD;
for you; for I'll be d-d if anything would have&#xD;
induced me to betray you.&#xD;
"Truly yours,&#xD;
"G:rausnT Dxrnzn."&#xD;
"Have you seen this?" said St. John to the&#xD;
lawyer, when he had finished reading it.&#xD;
"Is what he says true?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Warwick took the note, which the other&#xD;
offered, with his left hand, and in turn ran his&#xD;
eye over its contents, without, however, suspend-&#xD;
ing his vigilance as to St. John's movements.&#xD;
"Yes, it is true," he answered, briefly.&#xD;
"What are your termsl"&#xD;
"I will spare you arrest and prosecution for&#xD;
the crime you have committed, and will keep&#xD;
your secret-not even telling it to my brother-&#xD;
in-law-on two conditions: first, that you at&#xD;
once give up the whole of the money; secondly,&#xD;
that you agree to leave this State and never re-&#xD;
turn to it. If you refuse these conditions, I will&#xD;
arrest you on the spot. You look as if you&#xD;
thought that'would not be easy to do "-he in-&#xD;
terrupted himself to say, as St. John's lip curled&#xD;
into a sneering smile-" but you are mistaken.&#xD;
As I told you a minute ago, you are in my power&#xD;
absolutely. The first movement that you make&#xD;
to possess yourself of the pistol that you have&#xD;
in your bosom, I will disable you. I don't intend&#xD;
to kill you, but I'll wing you; both sides, if neces-&#xD;
sary. I am the more powerful man of the two,&#xD;
and could then deal with you easily myself. Bnt&#xD;
I need not be at that trouble. I have only to&#xD;
raise my voice and shout for assistance, to be&#xD;
heard by some of the Morton negroes. The&#xD;
quarters are just round the point of that wood,&#xD;
and the hands are in from work by this time.&#xD;
They know me, and will obey any orders I give&#xD;
them."&#xD;
St. John's eyes sank to the ground, and he&#xD;
gnawed his lip sullenly, without speaking.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick, after a minute's silence, re-&#xD;
sumed:&#xD;
"Decide at once whether you accept my con-&#xD;
Aitions. I am in a hurry."&#xD;
"What terms do you offer as regards Di.&#xD;
dier?"&#xD;
"I have not made public the evidence that I&#xD;
hold against him. He was arrested at my in.&#xD;
stance, OIL suspicion of having been connected&#xD;
with the burglary. I need not say that my evi~~&#xD;
dence is sufficient to convict you both. He was&#xD;
aware of this, or he would not have made the&#xD;
'admissions which he did to me privately-for he&#xD;
is a bold scoundrel. I must do him that justice.&#xD;
On the restoration of the money, I will withdraw&#xD;
my accusation against him, and he shall be re-&#xD;
leased, on condition that he, too, leaves the coun-&#xD;
try. I shall retain the proofs against both of&#xD;
you that I possess, and, if either breaks the eon-&#xD;
dition I impose by coming back into the State,&#xD;
he will be coming to immediate arrest and prose-&#xD;
cution."&#xD;

sand dollars - the reward which that fellow&#xD;
Marks has offered for its recovery-two thou-&#xD;
sand five hundred apiece to Didier and myself,&#xD;
and I will produce it. Otherwise-do your&#xD;
worst I I shall at least have the gratification of&#xD;
baffling you, and ruining your insolent brother-&#xD;
in-law."&#xD;
"You are not as clever as you think your-&#xD;
self, Mr. St. John," said Warwick, dryly. "You&#xD;
forget that your accomplice knows where the&#xD;
money is concealed. To give you a chance,&#xD;
he refused to treat with 'me himself on the&#xD;
subject. But I leave you to judge whether&#xD;
he- is likely to' persist in his silence when he&#xD;
learns that you threw away the chance thus&#xD;
afforded' you, and as his own safety depends&#xD;
upon the restitution of the money. I give&#xD;
you terms much more favorable than you have&#xD;
any righj to expect, because it will be less&#xD;
troublesome to me to receive the money im-.&#xD;
mediately, and let you go, than to arrest and&#xD;
imprison you, and then make another jour-&#xD;
ney to Chesselton to bring Didier up here,.&#xD;
Once for all, do you take mly conditions or&#xD;
not7"     e&#xD;
There was a pause, a struggle-a bitter strug-&#xD;
gle in St. John's mind, before he answered, sul-&#xD;
lenly---&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Produce the money. I am aware that it is&#xD;
secreted in the woods somewhere hereabout. De-&#xD;
liver it to me at once."&#xD;
Without a word the defeated man turned and&#xD;
walked toward the great iron gates that gave en.-&#xD;
trance to Morton House, his companion keeping&#xD;
beside him. The sun had set very shortly after&#xD;
the foregoing conversation commenced, and it&#xD;
was now deep dusk on the lonely road which&#xD;
they tratversed; but when they entered the gates&#xD;
of, Morton-they did enter, St. John leading the&#xD;
way still silently-there was something of twi-&#xD;
light yet lingering in the mor-e open path that&#xD;
they pursued; and the full moon was just rising&#xD;
grandly brilliant in the clear eastern heaven. St.&#xD;
John, after keeping the path for a short distance,&#xD;
plunged into the thickest of the wood, and finally&#xD;
stopped at a spot well chosen for the purpose to&#xD;
which it had been applied-a sort of miniature&#xD;
ravine that was shut in on all sides by a thick&#xD;
&#xD;
undergrowth, and surrounded by tall forest-trees.&#xD;
Halting beside the huge trunk of a fallen tree, he&#xD;
stirred among the dry leaves with his foot for an&#xD;
instant, then, stooping, took up by the handle-a&#xD;
mattock which had been concealed there. Walk-&#xD;
ing a few steps farther, to the foot of the tree,&#xD;
he again pushed away a quantity of dry leaves&#xD;
that filled a hollow caused by the violent up-.&#xD;
tearing from the earth of the roots of this for-&#xD;
est monarch, which had been blown down by a&#xD;
hurricane, and proceeded to exhume with the&#xD;
mattock the treasure that he was forced to re-&#xD;
sign.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick watched the work i silence;&#xD;
but when St. John, after removing the shallow&#xD;
layer of earth that had covered a pair of small&#xD;
leather saddle-bags, hauled it out with the mat-&#xD;
tock and pushed it with a heavy thump toward&#xD;
him, he said: " Is the money all here ?"  .&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Very well.. Keep your part of the agree-&#xD;
Iment and I shall keep mine."&#xD;
He picked up the saddle-bags, and they left&#xD;
the spot as silently as they had sought it; and it&#xD;
was not until they had regained th? open path&#xD;
again that another word was spoken. Then Mr.&#xD;
Warwick paused and said:&#xD;
" Our paths separate here. I have been trav.-&#xD;
elling and am tired-and this is rather a heavy&#xD;
weight to carry from here to Tallahoma.- I will&#xD;
cross the wood to Morton House, and borrow&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon's carriage to take rap to town.&#xD;
Good-evening."&#xD;
St. John deigned no reply. He waited to&#xD;
hear the conclusion of Mr. Warwick's speech--&#xD;
then, without a syllable, without even a glance,&#xD;
he turned and walked rapidly toward the gates.&#xD;
Some short time afterward, to Mrs. Gordon's&#xD;
surprise, Harrison ushered Mr. Warwick into her&#xD;
sitting-room. He carried on his arm the leather&#xD;
saddle-bags, and, declining the servant's proposal&#xD;
to relieve him of it, deposited it himself on a&#xD;
side-table before accepting Mrs. Gordon's invita-&#xD;
tion to join her ait her tea, which she was just ,&#xD;
taking.                -&#xD;
" You do not drink tea," she said.-" Coffee,&#xD;
Harrison, and something a little more substan-&#xD;
tial than this." She pointed to the table.&#xD;
While Harrison went to execute this order,&#xD;
the lawyer 'told his story, and preferred his&#xD;
request for the carriage.&#xD;
"I tell this to you only," he said, after she&#xD;
had congratulated him cordially on the recovery&#xD;
of the money. "Having received the first hint&#xD;
of the man's guilt from you, I do not consider it&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
CHECKMATED.&#xD;
&#xD;
205&#xD;
&#xD;
"&#xD;
&#xD;
a breach of my promise to tell you that your sus&#xD;
picion was just."&#xD;
Harrisoni returned, here, with a reiinforcemen&#xD;
of edibles that quite transformed the appearance&#xD;
of Mrs. Gordon's tea-table; and, after taking his&#xD;
supper with the appetite of a man who has been&#xD;
travelling, and is in excellent spirits, Mr. War-&#xD;
wick said good-evening to his friend and hostess,&#xD;
and once more preferring to carry his saddle-&#xD;
bags himself (a little to the scandal of Harrison,&#xD;
who was old-fashioned in his ideas of the pro-&#xD;
prieties), he entered the carriage which was in&#xD;
readiness, and was soon set down at the garden-&#xD;
gate of the Marks residence. -&#xD;
Passing up the walk and through the piazza,&#xD;
-he entered the dining-room, and1 found Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Marks its sole occupants-the children hav-&#xD;
ing been seat off to bed when the tea-table was&#xD;
removed, an hour before. He paused on thbe&#xD;
threshold of the door, and, himself unperceived,&#xD;
regarded for an instant, with a smile of dry&#xD;
humor, the disconsolate-looking pair. Mr. Marks,&#xD;
solemn-visaged and pale, sat gazing with a dull&#xD;
stare into the fire; while his wife, her usually&#xD;
busy hands folded in pathetic idleness, was look-&#xD;
ing sorrowfully at him.&#xD;
" Well, Marks, I have brought you back part&#xD;
of your money," said Mr. Warwick, advancing&#xD;
into the room. " Just draw that little table for-.&#xD;
ward, and we will count it, and see how much is&#xD;
missing."&#xD;
Mr. Marks sat motionless, so startled and&#xD;
astonished was he by this unexpected appear-&#xD;
ance and address of his brother-in-law. He&#xD;
looked from Mr. Warwick's face to the saddle-&#xD;
bags on his arm, and back again, in dumb in-&#xD;
credulity of the possibility of such good fortune;&#xD;
until the latter, growing tired of the weight,-de-&#xD;
posited it upon the knees of the stupefied cashier,&#xD;
while he himself fetched the table he had asked&#xD;
for, transferred to it a candle from the mantel-&#xD;
piece, lifted the saddle-bags'again and set them&#xD;
down with a sounding thud beside the candle,&#xD;
drew a chair to the table, and sat down. Then,&#xD;
as he proceeded methodically to unbuckle one&#xD;
of the bags, life flashed back through Mr.&#xD;
Marks's stagnant veins, and he drew his chair&#xD;
forward with feverish eagerness-impatient of the&#xD;
slowness, as it seemed to him, with which Mr.&#xD;
Warwick's long white fingers did their work.&#xD;
One, two, three straps ; and the buckles were&#xD;
new and stiff, hard to open. But the flap was&#xD;
lifted at last, and Mr. Warwick's hand brought&#xD;
forth bag after bag, and ranged them before the&#xD;
hungry eyes that looked on. When he had emp-.&#xD;
14&#xD;
&#xD;
- Tied both bags, he began telling over their con-&#xD;
tents. Twenty-four canvas bags--the mint mark,&#xD;
t" $1,000," bright and black on each-seals un-&#xD;
broken (with the exception of one, a little larger&#xD;
than the rest, which had been opened and was&#xD;
now tied at its mouth with a piece of red tape),&#xD;
*and two packages of bank-notes. These Mr.&#xD;
Warwick examined first. He patiently counted&#xD;
the smallest package--the notes that had been&#xD;
in circulation. " Thirteen hundred and twenty-&#xD;
seven dollars," he said, as he put down the last&#xD;
bill " That was the amount, was it not ?"&#xD;
" That was the amount," answered Mr. Marks,&#xD;
recovering speech.&#xD;
"Now let us see whether this is right too,"&#xD;
said the lawyer, unwrapping a newspaper that,&#xD;
was folded loosely around the larger pack-&#xD;
age.&#xD;
" All right !" cried the cashier, eagerly, as he&#xD;
saw that here too the seals were intact. "Good&#xD;
God! I never thought to see any of it'again,&#xD;
and here it is just us I saw it last! This bag "&#xD;
-he took up the one that was tied--"has eighty&#xD;
dollars over the amount in the others. It was&#xD;
part of what I was to keep, and I put the eighty&#xD;
dollars in-"&#xD;
" John, how did you get it back !" exclaimed&#xD;
Mrs. Marks, who had been literally inarticulate&#xD;
with joy up to this moment. " Oh, my dear,&#xD;
dear John, how did you get it back ?"&#xD;
"Nve mind about that, Bessie," he an-.&#xD;
swered, smiling. " All I can tell you is that I&#xD;
tracked down one of the burglars and made hima&#xD;
disgorge."&#xD;
" You've got him safe, I hope, for punish-&#xD;
ment ?" said Mr. Marks.&#xD;
.  "No. I could not secure the thief and the&#xD;
money both-so I preferred of the two to~take&#xD;
the money," answered he, rising and standing&#xD;
on the hearth-rug with his back to the fire.&#xD;
" But John-"&#xD;
If you ask me any more questions, Bessie,&#xD;
Plmake Marks pay mae the fire thousand dol-&#xD;
lars reward that he offered for the recovery of&#xD;
the money," interrupted her brother, with his&#xD;
slight and rare laugh.&#xD;
." Why, you don't mean, John, that you're not&#xD;
going to tell us any thing more than this ?"&#xD;
" Yes, Bessic, I mean just that. I have con-&#xD;
jured back the money-there it is!I-and that'&#xD;
must satisfy you."&#xD;
"It satisfies mc !" cried Mr. Marks, speak-&#xD;
ing like himself once more. '.' John, I .donet&#xD;
know how to thank you!" He started up and&#xD;
began shaking Mr. Warwick's hand so hard that&#xD;

&#xD;
the latter could not restrain a slight grimace of&#xD;
pain.&#xD;
* "Don't try," he said, as he managed to with.&#xD;
draw the sufferin~ member from that merciless&#xD;
grasp. ."Where are the children? Not gone te&#xD;
bed already, surely?"&#xD;
"Yes, they are gone to bed. It's not very&#xD;
early," answered Mrs. . Marks, apologetically.&#xD;
"Why, what am I thinking of! - don't you&#xD;
want some supper, John?"&#xD;
"Thank you, no-I have had supper. Have&#xD;
you heard any thing from or of Miss Tresham&#xD;
yet?"&#xD;
"Not a word. And never shall, I expect."&#xD;
She sighed.&#xD;
"There you are mistaken. I can give you&#xD;
some news of her."&#xD;
"You can!"&#xD;
"Yes," And he proceeded to describe his&#xD;
having found her in Hartsburg the week before~&#xD;
and all 'that had followed. The Markses were&#xD;
amazed, and . even a little sympathetic so far as&#xD;
the brain-fever was concerned; but Mr. Marks&#xD;
remained firm in his resolution of having noth-&#xD;
ing, more to do with her. "I liked her very&#xD;
much," he said, "and all may be right so far&#xD;
as she herself is concerned; but I'm convinced&#xD;
there's something wrong about this Mr. St.&#xD;
John, and there certainly is some connection&#xD;
between the two; so I think it safest to have&#xD;
nothing more to do with Miss Tresham. I've&#xD;
made up my mind to it, and I hope you won't,&#xD;
try to change my resolution, John&#xD;
"Cer~ain1y not," interrupted Mr. Warwick,&#xD;
a little coldly. "If you have made up your&#xD;
mind, that settles the matter. All I have to&#xD;
say Is, that you are acting very hastily and very~&#xD;
foolishly, in my opinion. I wonder if Tom has&#xD;
gone to bed, as well as the children?"&#xD;
"Do you want him?"&#xD;
"Yes; I should like to aend word to Hugh&#xD;
Ellis that the money is safe?'&#xD;
"You're right 1" cried Mr. Marks, with ani-&#xD;
mation; "Poor Hugh! I'll go and send at once,&#xD;
and relieve his mind."&#xD;
The~message certainly relieved Hugh's mind,&#xD;
but it put his curiosity on the rack; and great&#xD;
was his disappointment the next morning when&#xD;
he learned that this curiosity was not to be grati-&#xD;
fied by any more satisfactory information than&#xD;
that very meagre account which the Markses had&#xD;
already heard~ , Nor was he alone in his disap-&#xD;
pointment at Mr. Warwick's reilcenee. All La-&#xD;
grange felt defrauded and indignant; and St.&#xD;
John, as he sat next morning for the last time&#xD;
&#xD;
in the hotel piazza (he left in the Saxford coach&#xD;
at noon that day), listening to the gossip of the&#xD;
loungers, had the satisfaction-if in his existing&#xD;
frame of mind any thing could be a satisfaction&#xD;
to him-of hearing Mr. Warwick's obstinate re.&#xD;
fusal to give any explanation of how he recor'.&#xD;
ered the money, commented upon and censured&#xD;
in the strongest terms.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
TO WIN on LOSE IT ALL.&#xD;
rznnuAny came with a burst of tender, spring.&#xD;
like beauty that seemed to take the world by&#xD;
storm. Far away on the hills and over the woods,&#xD;
the soft, purple mist of the spring-time-that&#xD;
mist to the careless eye so like, and to the ob-&#xD;
servant eye so essentially unlike, the blue, melan-&#xD;
choly haze of the Indian summer-rested like a&#xD;
promise of coming beauty and budding vegeta-&#xD;
tion, hung like a veil of enchantment over each&#xD;
distant scene, rounding every outline, softening&#xD;
every rugged shape, clothing all things with a&#xD;
loveliness that charmed the senses like a draught&#xD;
of fairy elixir; if, indeed, we do not dishonor&#xD;
Nature by such comparisons, for what fairy elixir&#xD;
could be half as full of the delicious power to&#xD;
charm as her least gleam of sunshine, her palest&#xD;
sunset, the least flicker of her shadow~' upon a&#xD;
velvet turf? Sometimes February comes with&#xD;
dun skies and dropping tears, and sad robes trail-&#xD;
ing over the cold-brown earth; but then again-&#xD;
and this more frequently-she comes in the win-&#xD;
some guise of which we have spoken, crowned&#xD;
with flowers-who does not love them better&#xD;
even tjian the royal roses of May ?-and followed&#xD;
by a train of joyous birds that seem to fill the air&#xD;
with their happy twitter and 'full-throated song.&#xD;
"Singing, perhaps, does not so much make them&#xD;
happy, as it saves their little hearts from burst-&#xD;
ing because they are so full of happiness," says&#xD;
one of the sweetest and most tender of writers;&#xD;
and sometimes we think this must be so. Some-&#xD;
times we feel as if they utter out- happiness, as&#xD;
well as their own, out- thanks to God for the&#xD;
bounteous gift of all this His fair and glorious&#xD;
creation.&#xD;
it seemed so at least to Katharine, as she felt&#xD;
the world waking to new life all around her-&#xD;
felt it as she felt the health that was coiiiing like&#xD;
new wine into her veins, and flushing her cheek.&#xD;
She was by this time domesticated at Ilellefont,&#xD;
and every thing was very pleasant around her.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
TO WIN OR&#xD;
&#xD;
Luxurious appointments, plentiful attendance,&#xD;
kind faces, cordial tones, smiles that seem only&#xD;
the faint reflections of warm hearts- -who has&#xD;
not been cheered by such a haven once or&#xD;
twice in life, at least? Who has not gone forth&#xD;
warmed, invigorated, grateful for what has been,&#xD;
and courageous to meet what may be? Just&#xD;
now it was the time of rest with Katharine. The&#xD;
first period of convalescence was past, and she&#xD;
was well enough to make one of the family, cir-&#xD;
cle into which she had entered; yet the habits&#xD;
of illness still clung to her, and the task of&#xD;
getting well was as yet far fromcomplctc Re-&#xD;
pose was still a necessity; and this repose the&#xD;
Lesters took especial care to secure for her.&#xD;
Though the house was thronged with company&#xD;
half the time, Katharine found that every thing&#xD;
had been arranged so that she could see as much&#xD;
or as little of it as she chose; and when she&#xD;
chose to see exceedingly little, nobody found&#xD;
fault or was offended. Mrs. Lester, a quiet,&#xD;
motherly old lady who wore black-silk aprons,&#xD;
and carried a huge basket of keys1 sympathized&#xD;
with the young stranger, and spent much time in&#xD;
concocting delicate, dainty dishes with which to&#xD;
tempt her appetite; Colonel Lester made her&#xD;
welcome in very pleasant and hearty fashion,&#xD;
gnd promised her exercise on a "splendid~~&#xD;
riding-horse that would bring back her roses as&#xD;
soon as she waS able to sit in the saddle; Miss&#xD;
Lester was charmingly kind, and kept her dozen&#xD;
or so of bOisterous cousins to herself as much as&#xD;
possible; Miss Vernon Katharine liked better&#xD;
every day; Spitfire condescended to remember&#xD;
that he had formerly made her acquaintance, and&#xD;
to greet her with tolerable amiability; and the&#xD;
redoubtable Bulger (whose teeth in themselves&#xD;
were enough to terrify a nervous person into&#xD;
hysterics), suavely permitted her to pat hi~ head,&#xD;
when he was triumphantly marched in for inspec-&#xD;
tion by his doting mistress. Even the maid who&#xD;
was detailed for her special service had a bright,&#xD;
pleasant face; and any one who has ever suffered&#xD;
from a sour, sullen, Or unwilling servant, will&#xD;
need no assurance that this was a very far from&#xD;
inconsiderable item in the general sunshine.&#xD;
On the whole, Katharine felt as if she was&#xD;
in a sort of dream. Tallahoma 1-Mrs. Marks!&#xD;
-the school-room 1-St John 1-Mrs. Gordon!&#xD;
What had become of them all? Which was&#xD;
real, that life or this one? What had befallen&#xD;
all thohe people since she parted from them so&#xD;
long ago? What chance had led these kind&#xD;
Samaritans to the way-side where they had found&#xD;
her? It all seemed strange---nearly as strange&#xD;
&#xD;
LOSE IT ALL.                           207&#xD;
as when she first waked from unconsciousness&#xD;
and asked those bewildered questions which no-&#xD;
body would answer-which nobody had answered&#xD;
to her satisfaction yet.&#xD;
One evening, a few days after her arrival at&#xD;
Bellefont, she was down-stairs, in the cosy sit-&#xD;
ting-room where the family assembled when&#xD;
there was no company, where Mrs. Lester pla-&#xD;
cidly knitted in one corner, where Colonel Les-&#xD;
ter read the papers, and occasionally nodded over&#xD;
them, where he played whist, and never nodded&#xD;
over that, where Miss Lester had her particular&#xD;
seat by the fire (the same seat on which she had&#xD;
nursed her doll a few years before), from which&#xD;
she chattered nonsense unceasingly, where Spit-&#xD;
fire basked luxuriously on the hearth-rug, and&#xD;
where a little darkey with an unnaturally solemn&#xD;
face and an unnaturally-clean cheek apron, sat in&#xD;
a corner by the fireplace on a low stool, ready to&#xD;
hold Mrs. Lester's yarn, to bring chips, and run&#xD;
errands generally, for anybody who wanted any&#xD;
thing. It was a pleasant, home-like scei~e, Kath-&#xD;
arine thought, as she sat back in a corner (it is&#xD;
astonishing how many corners a room of this&#xD;
description can manage to have), and watched&#xD;
and listened, herself quiet and silent. There was&#xD;
a piano in still another corner-somewhat in the&#xD;
shade-and at this Miss Vernon was singing that&#xD;
softest and sweetest of Scotch ballads, "The&#xD;
Land o' the Leal." The clear voice-'-which had&#xD;
no power in it for bravura execution--sounded&#xD;
very sweetly in the touching cadences of the&#xD;
tender melody. They were all silent, and all&#xD;
listening - even Colonel Lester, who cared no&#xD;
more for music in general than for the beating&#xD;
of a tin pan-when there came a step in the&#xD;
hail. "Some of the ubiquitous cousins," thought&#xD;
katharine, with a sigh of regret; but a familiar&#xD;
voice was heard saying, "Yes, I know the way,"&#xD;
and Godfrey Seymour entered the room. The&#xD;
music did not cease. Miss Vernon only nodded&#xD;
to him with a smile, and went on singing, while&#xD;
he made the tour of the fire, shaking hands with&#xD;
every member of the circle, and only recognizing&#xD;
Katharine when he came to her last of all.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham 1" he exclaimed. "What a&#xD;
pleasant surprise!" Then he greeted her warm-&#xD;
ly, and sat down by. her side. Katharine did&#xD;
not feel much like conversation, but it never&#xD;
required any efl'ort to talk to Seymour.. He was&#xD;
so frank, so simple, so free from all effort him-&#xD;
self that, unconsciously, he forced others to ,be&#xD;
natural also. Miss Tresham was startled: when&#xD;
at last she glanced at the clock and saw how&#xD;
long she had been talking to him.&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
" I must go," she said, smiling. "I am an&#xD;
invalid still, and keep invalid hours. You will&#xD;
excuse me, won't you ?"&#xD;
" Of course, I excuse you," he answered,&#xD;
"especially since I hope to see you very soon&#xD;
again."&#xD;
&#xD;
lIe went with her to the door, shook hands&#xD;
when he said good-night, and then, in turning&#xD;
back, cast a quick glance round the room,that&#xD;
took in the occupation of every one of its in-&#xD;
mates. One of the ubiquitous cousins kad ar-&#xD;
rived, and was entertaining Miss Lester, Colonel&#xD;
Lester was nodding over a newspaper, Mrs. Les-&#xD;
ter wps winding some yarn which Flibbertigibbet,&#xD;
(a name of his young mistress's bestowal), held&#xD;
solemnly on his two little black paws. Miss Ver-&#xD;
non was still at the piano, singing softly to her-&#xD;
self. To the piano, therefore, Mr. Seymour took&#xD;
his way.&#xD;
"I don't know what you will say to me," he&#xD;
began; as he settled himself in a seat byithe key-&#xD;
board. ."I have broken faith with everybody,&#xD;
and told Miss Tresham that Morton is staying&#xD;
with me."&#xD;
"Indeed !" said Miss Vernon, stopping in the&#xD;
midst of her song. " And what did she say ?"&#xD;
" Nothing in particular," he answered,&#xD;
"though I assure you I was frightened enough&#xD;
when I found I had let out the secret. I had&#xD;
been warned so solemnly against any indiscre-&#xD;
tion of the kind, that I fully expected her to&#xD;
faint; but, instead of that, she had not even the&#xD;
grace to turn pale."&#xD;
" How foolish you arc! !" said the young lady,&#xD;
smiling. " Of course, nobody ever expected her&#xD;
to faint, or even to turn pale. In fact, there is no&#xD;
reason why she should not be told aliout him.&#xD;
You know it was by the doctor's orders that.&#xD;
every thing has been kept from her up tor this&#xD;
time; but I think she is niell enough now -to&#xD;
bear something a little more exciting than dear&#xD;
Mrs. Lester's nice soups and omelets."&#xD;
"I bring a message from Annesley, anyway.&#xD;
The podr fellow wants to know when he can&#xD;
come tver. I was charged to make intercession&#xD;
for him, and I can do so most sincerely. It is&#xD;
amazingly dull for him over at our place."&#xD;
"Thiat is a slander on your place which I&#xD;
won't sanction. Because 'Mr. Annesley happens&#xD;
to be lovesick, and unable to find any pleasure in&#xD;
any thing that is not brightened by Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am's eyes "-(then with some contrition)-" there&#xD;
.    goes my sharp tongue again I I wonder if I never&#xD;
shall cure myself of saying ill-tiatured things ?&#xD;
* Honestly, I am very sorry for him, and it was&#xD;
&#xD;
only to-day that I told Maggie that she ought to&#xD;
write a note and tell him he might come. I am&#xD;
very glad you paved the way by speaking of him&#xD;
to Miss Tresham. Dy-the-by, this reminds me&#xD;
that Mrs. Lester has received a letter from Mr.&#xD;
Warwick, begging her to keep all accounts of th'e&#xD;
Tallahoma bank robbery from Miss Tresham, and&#xD;
adding that he will be down here soon to take&#xD;
her back to Lagrange."&#xD;
"lie seems to take a great deal of interest in&#xD;
Miss Tresham. I hope it does not hode ill for&#xD;
&#xD;
Annesley."&#xD;
"Nonsense ! I should as soon think of a&#xD;
volume of Blackstone falling in love as Mr. War-&#xD;
wick. Miss Tresham was his sister's governess,&#xD;
and he has been very hind to her-that's all.&#xD;
Men are twice as fanciful as women are about&#xD;
such things as this."&#xD;
" Perhaps because we know each other bet-&#xD;
ter. Miss g4esham is amazingly pretty," he&#xD;
added, candidly, " and very attractive, very sym-&#xD;
pathetic. I sltould hot mind falling in love, with&#xD;
her myself."&#xD;
" Do it, then, by all means. Your chance&#xD;
would be quite as good as Mr. Annesley's, I&#xD;
should think."  ~-&#xD;
"I might, perhaps, if-no man can serve two&#xD;
masters, you know, much less twvo mistresses.&#xD;
Now, I found mine long ago. Fortunately, or&#xD;
probably unfortunately, for me, I could not&#xD;
change my allegiance, if I would."&#xD;
" It is a misfortune to be too constant," said&#xD;
Miss Vernon; but she said it very gently, and&#xD;
then changed the subject abruptly. " And Mr.&#xD;
Annesley wants to make an appearance on the&#xD;
scene, does he ? "&#xD;
["He sent me over specially to intercede for&#xD;
him. Not that I needed much persuasion to&#xD;
induce me to come," he added, with a slight&#xD;
grimace. "I am always ready enough to singe&#xD;
my wings. Tell me what message I shall take&#xD;
back to the poor fellow."&#xD;
" We must go and ask Mrs. Lester that. I&#xD;
can't venture to bid him come merely on my own&#xD;
responsibility." .&#xD;
Mrs. Lester being propitious, it was finally&#xD;
decided that Mr. Annesley might venture to&#xD;
make his appearance at Bellefont the next&#xD;
morning ; and, with this comforting news for&#xD;
his friend, Mr. Seymour took leave.&#xD;
The next morning was unspeakably lovely.&#xD;
The sky had not a cloud, the air was soft and&#xD;
warm, yet full of buoyancy-so full of buoyancy&#xD;
that it almost seemed as if it were possible to&#xD;
feel the buds expanding, the flowers opening, and&#xD;

&#xD;
the grass springing all around. As Miss Vernon&#xD;
sauntered back and forth on the front terrace,&#xD;
her bright beauty looked akin to the bright day.&#xD;
She almost dazzled Seymour and Annesley when&#xD;
they came riding up, and, dismounting from their&#xD;
horses, looked up and saw her ,standing at the&#xD;
top of the steps, with the sunshine pouring over&#xD;
her slender figure, her fresh morning-dress sweep-&#xD;
ing the gravel-walk, and a knot of violets fast-&#xD;
ened at her throat.&#xD;
" I am very glad to see you," she said, greet-&#xD;
ing them both with a smile. "Is not the day&#xD;
charming ? I could not stay in the house,&#xD;
though there are half a dozen people there who&#xD;
have come with the deliberate intention of&#xD;
spending the day-the Roystons, and ever so&#xD;
many more. Mr. Seymour, you need not look&#xD;
so much alarmed. You can stay out here with&#xD;
me, if you choose, and that will give me a good&#xD;
excuse for not going back. I can say you kept&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"And put all -the blame on my shoulders,"&#xD;
said Godfrey, laughing. ."Well, they are broad&#xD;
enough to bear it, and I accept the responsibil-&#xD;
ity with pleasure. We will certainly stay. It is&#xD;
a sin to go in-doors such a day as this."&#xD;
"But how about me ?" asked Annesley,.&#xD;
" Am I to be left to the tender mercies of Roys-&#xD;
ton &amp;amp; Co., or ap I to be allowed to remain an'd&#xD;
enjoy the beauties of Nature also ?"&#xD;
"You are to come with me and he shown&#xD;
what you are to do," answered Miss Vernon.-&#xD;
" Stay here, Mr. Seymour, if you please, I will&#xD;
be back in a minute-This way, Mr. Annesley."&#xD;
Somewhat amused, and a little puzzled, Mor-&#xD;
ton obeyed, an followed the young autocrat&#xD;
around the terrace. She led him to an angle&#xD;
of the house, and quite out of sight of the draw-&#xD;
ing-room, before she paused. Then she stopped,&#xD;
and pointed to three French windows that opened&#xD;
on the terrace, just where the terrace overlooked&#xD;
the garden, which lay to the south, ,&#xD;
"Do you know where those windows lead,&#xD;
Mr. Annesley," she asked, gravely. -&#xD;
" I think I do, Miss Irene," answered Mor-&#xD;
ton, with equal gravity. " They* lead into the&#xD;
sitting-room."&#xD;
" Well, if you choose to go through one of&#xD;
them, you will find Miss Tresham in the sitting-&#xD;
room. I left her there half an hour ago." .&#xD;
." But is there no fear of startling her ?"  -&#xD;
' "None at all, I assure you. She knows you&#xD;
are expected, and I don't think she troubles her-&#xD;
self to be the least bit excited about it. She&#xD;
said she should be glad to see you-she wanted&#xD;
&#xD;
to hear from Lagrange. Go in, by all means, and&#xD;
give her the news from Lagrange ; only remem-&#xD;
ber " (and her voice changed prom bantering to&#xD;
earnest) " that you must not mention the bank&#xD;
robbery. For some cause, Mr. Warwick has pro-&#xD;
hibited it."&#xD;
" You may depend on my discretion," he&#xD;
said, and was turning away, when she extended&#xD;
her hand and touched him.&#xD;
" One moment, Mr. Annesley," she said,&#xD;
smiling and blushing. Many a long day after-&#xD;
ward the scene came back to Morton;- he re-&#xD;
membered the sweet spring sunshine, the slender&#xD;
white hand on his coat-sleeve, the beautiful face&#xD;
bending toward him, the frank, 'tender eyes, and&#xD;
the delicious fragrance of the violets fastened at&#xD;
her throat. " One word, Mr. Anuesley," she said,&#xD;
hastily- "Don't think me impertinent, but we&#xD;
are old friends, and-may I wish you success? "&#xD;
For one moment Annesley was surprised; the&#xD;
next, he felt deeply touched. The few words&#xD;
had been so sweetly and so gracefully said that&#xD;
the veriest churl must have acknowledged their&#xD;
charm. It was fortunate that they were out of&#xD;
sight of the drawing-room windows, for, follow-&#xD;
ing his first impulse, he bent and kissed the&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
" Thank you, Miss Irene," he said, simply.&#xD;
Then, before she could answer, he was walk-&#xD;
ing away toward the French windows.&#xD;
As it chanced, Katharine was sitting imme-&#xD;
diately in front of one of these windows, leaning.&#xD;
back with supreme comfort in a deep arm-chair,&#xD;
enjoying idly all the fresh beauty of the scene&#xD;
before her, and so wrapped in the dreamy reve-&#xD;
rie which such weather inspires, and which does&#xD;
not deserve to be called thought, that a book she&#xD;
had been attempting to read had dropped from&#xD;
her hand to her lap, and lay there unheeded.&#xD;
She hardly started when a crisp, ringing step-&#xD;
step that she knew well-sounded on the gravel&#xD;
walk, when Morton drew aside the curtaius and&#xD;
looked in at the window, thus finding himself&#xD;
face to face with the woman he had come to&#xD;
seek.&#xD;
" Miss Tresham!I How happy I am to see&#xD;
you!" he exclaimed, making one long step&#xD;
through the window to her side. " How happy'&#xD;
I am to see you ! and to see you looking so&#xD;
entirely yourself!"&#xD;
" How happy I am to be well enough to -be&#xD;
seen again! " she answered, letting him take&#xD;
both her hands in his warm, eager clasp. "You&#xD;
are very good to-to look so glad," she added,&#xD;
with a little laugh. "Everybody is so good to&#xD;

&#xD;
me! You have heard how these kind peoph&#xD;
insisted on bringing me here to get well?"&#xD;
"I have heard considerably more that you&#xD;
have, I believe," said he, laughing in turn. Then&#xD;
he released her hands, and, stepping back a lit-&#xD;
tle, looked at her.&#xD;
Her illness had not left any very terrible&#xD;
traces. That was his'first thought. The worst&#xD;
was certainly the loss of her hair; yet, even that&#xD;
did not disfigure her as much as might be ima-&#xD;
gined. The head had only been shaven on the&#xD;
top of the scalp, and that was covered by a light&#xD;
and infinitely becoming cap of muslin and lace;&#xD;
elsewhere the brown hair, which was not more&#xD;
than an inch or two long, had an inclination to&#xD;
curl, that saved it from the horribly-ungraceful&#xD;
aspect of short straight hair~ Round the fore-&#xD;
head it lay in soft, pretty rings, that seemed to&#xD;
suit the delicate complexion, which had an exqui-&#xD;
site transparence, that is often seen after severe&#xD;
illness, but rarely ever at any other time. l~ven&#xD;
the eyes he knew so well had caught, Morton&#xD;
thought, new beauty; they were so full of dewy&#xD;
lustre, as they looked up, dazzled and drooping a&#xD;
little fr~rn the sunshine! Perhaps this dewy&#xD;
lustre sprung from tears. At least, there was&#xD;
something like a suggestion of tears in her voice&#xD;
when she spoke.&#xD;
"Everybody is so good to me!" she repeat-&#xD;
ed, with much feeling.&#xD;
"How could anybody help being good to&#xD;
you?" he asked, in a tone that carried with it&#xD;
an unmistakable accent of sincerity. After he&#xD;
said it, something rose in his throat and choked&#xD;
him ~a little. With that face before him, and the&#xD;
golden day all around4 a sudden remembrance&#xD;
came of the nEght when this bright life had&#xD;
seemed passing away from earth, and the things&#xD;
of earth, into that realm of darkness and shadow&#xD;
which to him, as to ninny people, the night served&#xD;
to typify. Was it real? Was it she, sitting be-&#xD;
fore him there with the sweet, flickering smile-&#xD;
smile half akin to tears-on her lip? Or was&#xD;
that other only a dream-that memory of past&#xD;
danger, darkness, and distress? He found it&#xD;
Impossible to realize them both. Yet, he looked&#xD;
at her, and said:&#xD;
"You don't know how grateful I am that you&#xD;
are gaining health and strength once more."&#xD;
"Can you imagine how grateful I am?"&#xD;
she asked. "It is so pleasant-no words can&#xD;
say how pleasant-to feel life coming back with&#xD;
everybreath one draws 1 The most common and&#xD;
trivial things of existence seem to have new&#xD;
sweetness and value, when one has so nearly&#xD;
&#xD;
lost them. This day-no doubt, it is charr~i.&#xD;
ing enough to you, but to me it seems like para-&#xD;
dise! So it is with every thing. I cannot de-&#xD;
scribe the sensations that beset me; or-, per-&#xD;
haps, I can, sum them up in one-I am so glad&#xD;
to get well!"&#xD;
"And glad to be here, are you not?"&#xD;
"Vory. glad, indeed, though everybody was&#xD;
most kind in Hartsburg. I don't understand&#xD;
matters quite yet," said she, looking puzzled;&#xD;
"but I suppose I shall after a while.' I was sur-&#xD;
prised to hear that you were expected to-day&#xD;
How do you chance to be down here?"&#xD;
"Oh, I-I am staying with Godfrey Sey-&#xD;
mour," *said he, smiling a little. "What are&#xD;
you reading?"&#xD;
She held out the book. It was a volume ci'&#xD;
the "Facrie Qucene."&#xD;
"I wanted something that would not excite&#xD;
me," she said; "and this is an old and dear&#xD;
favorite, that has gone with me many a rnmble.&#xD;
Perhaps it is from this association that it seems&#xD;
to me as if it should always be read with bright&#xD;
sunshine and beautiful scenes all around. I am&#xD;
so glad to see you!" she went on, with an&#xD;
abrupt change of subject, as Annesley took the&#xD;
volume and began turning ovcr~the leaves. "I&#xD;
want to ask you about Lagrange. I feel as if&#xD;
the world might have come to an end while I&#xD;
was lying sick in Hartsburg; so I really have&#xD;
not dared to write to anybody. Tell me some-&#xD;
thing, please, Mr. 'Annesley."&#xD;
"What shall I tell you?" asked Mr. An.&#xD;
nesley, becoming much interested in the "Facrie&#xD;
Qucene."                        -&#xD;
"Any thing," answered she, impatiently.&#xD;
"Don't look that way, or I shall think t'hihre is&#xD;
something you 'don't want me to know. Mr.&#xD;
Annesley "-growing pale-" tell me, please, is&#xD;
there any thing?"&#xD;
"On my honor, not a thing," answered Mor-&#xD;
ton, hastily, quite startled by her sudden change&#xD;
of color. "What should there be? and, if there&#xD;
were any thingwhy should I not tell you 2 I-&#xD;
I'll go and bring Mrs. Lester to you, if you don't&#xD;
get your color back," he added, becoming more&#xD;
alarmed.&#xD;
"No, don't!,~ said she, holding out her hand&#xD;
as he half turned to go. "Stop; the color will&#xD;
come back in a minute. I fancy your fright is&#xD;
only an excuse to escape from my questions,"&#xD;
she went on, smiling faintly. "I have not asked&#xD;
them yet, you know. Did you see Mrs. Marks&#xD;
before you left Lagrange?"&#xD;
"Yes, I saw her, and she was quite well.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
TO WIN OR LOSE IT ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
211&#xD;
&#xD;
Please let me go and get you something-some&#xD;
water or ~&#xD;
"I need nothing at all; thank you. Did Mrs.&#xD;
Marks say any thing to you with regard to me or&#xD;
my absence?"&#xD;
Poor Morton cast about in his mind for an&#xD;
evasive answer, found none, and plunged head-&#xD;
long at a reckless truth.&#xD;
"She mentioned you, of course, and ex-&#xD;
pressed great concern at your absence. You-&#xD;
she-it seems you did Aet tell her how long you&#xD;
meant to be away?"&#xD;
"How coukt~when I had no idea of any&#xD;
thing like this? It is like a dream," she said.&#xD;
"You don't know how strangely vague every&#xD;
thing seems. Almost immediately after I ar-&#xD;
rived in Saxford, things waver and grow dim in&#xD;
my recollection. I stayed there two or three&#xD;
days-longer, perhaps-waiting for Father Mar-&#xD;
tin. :1 think, in fact I am sure, that the fever&#xD;
was '~h me then. My remembrance of those&#xD;
days is of continued, dull, heavy pain, and burn-&#xD;
ingvt~irst. If I 'Ifad been myself, of course, I&#xD;
should have gone back to Tallahoma; but I was&#xD;
full of cowardice and terror-terror of a person&#xD;
whom I did not like-and I had no control over&#xD;
my nerves. Day by day this grew worse, until it&#xD;
became a wild desire for flight. My last tangible&#xD;
recollection is of making up my mind to leave&#xD;
Saxford and going to sell my watch, fQr I had&#xD;
brought very little money with me. After that,&#xD;
~ver~ thing is a blank till I waked up in Harts.&#xD;
b~urg, and they told me I had been at death's&#xD;
ddor. I don't know what they think of me in&#xD;
Taliahoma. It has been six weeks, you know,&#xD;
since I left there-but I have felt a quietness&#xD;
about it that amazes myself. I am glad to come&#xD;
back to life; but it seems as if many things&#xD;
that troubled me before have dwindled in im-&#xD;
portance, have less, far less power to disturb me&#xD;
than they formerly had."&#xD;
"Then that is one good result, at least,&#xD;
arising from your illness."&#xD;
She looked a little startled.&#xD;
"Why, is there any thing that I must&#xD;
hear?"&#xD;
"How quick you are to suspect what has no&#xD;
existence! There is nothing at all that I know&#xD;
of. I am simply glad that you have reached an&#xD;
enviable state of indifference to things subluna-&#xD;
ry, which are more often disagreeable than pleas-&#xD;
ant."&#xD;
"I did not say I was indifferent. I hope I&#xD;
never shall be. I think indifferent people have&#xD;
hardly a right to live in a world that is full of&#xD;
&#xD;
things to take interest in. Never mind about&#xD;
that, however. Tell me how many days it has&#xD;
been since you left Lagrange."&#xD;
"Days!~~ He first stared, then hesitated.&#xD;
"It has been a month since I left home."&#xD;
"Indeed!" The extreme of astonishment&#xD;
was in her face and in her voice. "A month!"&#xD;
she repeated. "Then you must have been else-&#xD;
where? You cannot have been here all that&#xD;
time?"&#xD;
"If by here you mean Apalatka, I am obliged&#xD;
to confess that I have been here all the time.~~&#xD;
"But Mr. Annesley-"&#xD;
"Well, Miss Tresham?"&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," said she, coloring. "I&#xD;
was so much surprised that I was o~ the point&#xD;
of being very uncivil. I was about to ask what&#xD;
you had been doing here."&#xD;
She spoke with perfect unconsciousness; but&#xD;
her words seemed charged with meaning to Mor-&#xD;
ton. He had gone in search of her with one fixed&#xD;
purpose in his mind: he had waited to see ,her,&#xD;
,steadily resolved to accomplish that purpose as&#xD;
soon as practicable; and now, here was the op-&#xD;
portunity to do it. Morton did not fear his fate&#xD;
very much, as his frank assertion to Mr. Warwick&#xD;
on the night that Katharine lay, as they thought,&#xD;
dying, plainly showed. Poor fellow! He had&#xD;
been so spoiled and humored, so praised and&#xD;
taught to consider himself irresistible all his life,&#xD;
that the wonder w~s, not that he had little~ van-i&#xD;
ity, but that he had half so much honest humil-&#xD;
ity. There was nothing of offensive puppyism-&#xD;
in fact, there was nothing of puppyism at all-&#xD;
in his belief that Miss Tresham would accept&#xD;
him. He wondered at it himself, and, despite&#xD;
Jiis apparent grounds for confidence, could not&#xD;
help doubting it a little. He even flushed sud-&#xD;
denly at her last words, more like a boy than&#xD;
like a man of the world; then looked straight&#xD;
at her with his clear eyes.&#xD;
"I will tell you what I have been doing&#xD;
here," lie said. "I have been ivaiting to see&#xD;
"To see me!" repeated Katharine. Sh~*as&#xD;
stupid just then, and it did not occur to her what&#xD;
he meant. On the contrary, her head was so full&#xD;
of Tallahoma, and St. John, and Mrs. Gordon,&#xD;
that she turned pale again, and gave a low, trem-&#xD;
bling cry. "I knew it," she said. "Yen have&#xD;
something to tell mc. 0 Mr. Annesley, pray be&#xD;
kind and tell it at once."&#xD;
"I think I am the most bungling fellow that&#xD;
ever lived!" cried Annesley, out of patience 3vith&#xD;
himself. "This is the third time I have stai~tled&#xD;

you withQut any earthly reason for it. Please&#xD;
belie~re, once for all, that there is nothing I could&#xD;
tell you if I wanted to-of a disagreeable nature,&#xD;
I mean. There is something I wish to tell you,&#xD;
and mean to tell you," he went on, hurriedly;&#xD;
~ but it certainly cannot have the merit of nov-&#xD;

you. Miss Tresham~ do I need to tell it? Don't&#xD;
you know-you, without any help from me--why&#xD;
I came here~and why I have remained?"&#xD;
In ,a~ second she knew what he meant. A&#xD;
flush caine over the pale face, then died away,&#xD;
leaving it paler than ever. Looking at her, An-&#xD;
nesley was startled; he did not know whether to&#xD;
hope or ~to fear. Only one thing was certain-a&#xD;
good sign, it is usually considered-she did not&#xD;
speak. Still there was something about her, now&#xD;
as ever, which kept him at a distance, which&#xD;
made blia speak with humility when there was&#xD;
every reasonable ground for speaking with hope.&#xD;
~' Miss Tresham," he said, "don't be angry&#xD;
with me. I only mean this: that I love you so&#xD;
~'ell 1 cannot keep silent longer. I-what is the&#xD;
use of talking 1" said the young man, with a sud-&#xD;
dez~, passionate burst of excitement. "You are&#xD;
every thing in the world to me; words are too&#xD;
poor to tell you what you are. I never knew&#xD;
what love was till your face kindled it in my&#xD;
heart. I should have spoken long ago if-if you&#xD;
had given me one sign of encouragement. But&#xD;
you are so cold, so self-contained. Even now-"&#xD;
J~Ie stopped suddenly-stopped without any&#xD;
apparent ~ause-.-and, turning, walked away.&#xD;
He was right. Words were too poor to tell&#xD;
her what he felt, to utter the great love, the faith-&#xD;
ful, honest devotion which lay at her feet ready&#xD;
for her to take up and make her own. But&#xD;
then, again, no words were needed to tell him&#xD;
tha4 he had spoken in vain, that there was no&#xD;
~hswer to his passionate pleading in that averted&#xD;
face, that the hand lying so lightly on the arm&#xD;
ofjwr chair would never be extended to him,&#xD;
~ever~--*~h, never! The knowledge came on him&#xD;
with a rush-.--a force that was equivalent to a&#xD;
physical blow. lie stopped, turned pale, and&#xD;
walked to the other end of the room. Then&#xD;
tl~ere wp~ it silence. A bird just outside of the&#xD;
window was twittering and trilling as if in the&#xD;
verye~uberance of happy content, a ripple of&#xD;
gay voices and laughter sounded across the hall&#xD;
front the drawing-room, and a gardener just be-&#xD;
low the terrace sung to himself a negro melody&#xD;
as lw spaded.&#xD;
~KatIiarine was the first to speak, her voice&#xD;
~liJ3g notl~ing of ibe struggle it had been to&#xD;
&#xD;
command it, as she uttered his name. He came&#xD;
back instantly, a light of wistful hope in his eyes&#xD;
that touched her heart, and gave her tones a sort&#xD;
of quiver whe~i she went on:&#xD;
"Mr. Annesley, forgive me that I did not&#xD;
speak. You surprised me so much, and I-I am&#xD;
not very strong yet. What can I say?" she&#xD;
added, after a moment's pause. "It seems use-&#xD;
less to tell you that I am grateful for~ the honor&#xD;
you have done me. I admire you so much, I&#xD;
esteem you so highly, that I shall be prouder, all&#xD;
my life, and yet sadder, too, to think that you&#xD;
should have loved me. But you know-ah, why&#xD;
have you been so foolish ?-you know it cannot&#xD;
be!"&#xD;
"I only know that it depends on you," said&#xD;
Annesley. "On nothing-on nobody else. Un-&#xD;
derstand this, you hold my life in your hands.&#xD;
Keep it, or throw it away, just as you please;&#xD;
all the same, it is yours."&#xD;
"Hush 1" said Katharine, gently. "Pray,&#xD;
don't talk like that. YourJife.-.ah, Mr. Mines-&#xD;
Icy, how much you have forgotten when you&#xD;
sp~k so to me.' Your life can be nothing to&#xD;
me, my life less than nothing to you. Not a&#xD;
single interest or possibility of one crosses, or&#xD;
can cross, the other. Why have you forgotten&#xD;
this?"&#xD;
"Rather ask why I sliould remember-why I&#xD;
should believe it."&#xD;
"You know it is impossible," said she, speak-&#xD;
ingwith an earnestness that startled him. "You&#xD;
have acted on a sudden impulse-a generous im-&#xD;
pulse, I am sure-but you must see and feel that&#xD;
it is impossible; that I am nothing, that I never&#xD;
can be any thing to you."&#xD;
"You are every thing to me," he answered,&#xD;
standing before her, pale and resolute, deter-&#xD;
mined evidently to obtain a definite answer&#xD;
before he left her presenue.&#xD;
"I-oh, how foolish I am!" said Katharine,&#xD;
as a sudden rush of tears ended her sentence&#xD;
almost before it was begun. She was foolish-&#xD;
very foolish-but this was a great temptation;&#xD;
and that fact may, perhaps, excuse her. How&#xD;
forlorn she felt, just now, especially, among&#xD;
strangers, a~ad without a single friend on whom&#xD;
it was possible to rely; and, in the very midst of&#xD;
this loneliness, a hand was extended, a voice&#xD;
spoke, and she knew that care, kindness, home,&#xD;
wealth, position, best of all, earnest love, was&#xD;
offered to her. Was it strange that, realizing&#xD;
this, her resolve s4most failed, her heart gave~ a&#xD;
great pang when she tried to speak the words&#xD;
that would put them forever from liar?&#xD;
&#xD;
"Don't distress yourself," said Annesley, to&#xD;
whom the last, worst evil of earth was the evil&#xD;
of seeing a woman's tears; "pray, don't distress&#xD;
yourself; I. shall never forgive myself if you&#xD;
do! I think I had better go," lie said, desperate-&#xD;
ly; "I shall make you ill if I stay any lGnger.&#xD;
All this agitation must do you harm. I will&#xD;
come again to-morrow. Please think of what I&#xD;
have said, and-and try to make up your mind to&#xD;
'come to me. I think I could make you happy, if&#xD;
you would," he added, wistfully, "and I am sure&#xD;
you could make me more than happy."&#xD;
With these words he left the room, Kath-&#xD;
anne making not an effort to detain him. In&#xD;
truth, she was literally incapable of doing so.&#xD;
Weakness and agitation together had proved too&#xD;
much for her. She was so completely exhausted&#xD;
that, after he was gone, she could hardly remem-&#xD;
ber where she was, or what had happened.&#xD;
When Morton went back round the terrace&#xD;
(for his exit, like his entrance, was by way of the&#xD;
window), he found that Miss Vernon ~iad disap-&#xD;
peared, and that Seymour was standing by the&#xD;
horses, smoking a cigar, and looking rather&#xD;
gloomy.&#xD;
"Have you spoken to the good people in the&#xD;
house?" asked Annesley, coming up. "I won-&#xD;
den if it is necessary to do so before we go?"&#xD;
"No, I have not," answered Godfrey, with a&#xD;
start. "And I don't think it is necessary. They&#xD;
are not ceremonious people, or people likely to&#xD;
be offended. - If you have finished your visit, we&#xD;
might as well be off'. As certainly as we go in, we&#xD;
shall have to stay to dinner."&#xD;
"Let us be off, by all means, then," said An-&#xD;
nesley, springing into his saddle with ungrateful&#xD;
haste.&#xD;
The other followed his example, and,' riding&#xD;
briskly, they were soon out of the Lester domain.&#xD;
The Seymour place was several miles distant.&#xD;
They had ridden a mile or two before Annesley&#xD;
roused sufficiently from his own abstraction to&#xD;
notice his companion.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Godfrey?" he asked.&#xD;
"You don't seem like yourself-you don't even&#xD;
look like yourself."&#xD;
Godfrey rolled a cloud of blue smoke from&#xD;
between his lips before he answered. Then he&#xD;
laughed shortly.&#xD;
"A man is apt to look gloomy after he has&#xD;
made a fool of himself" he said. "I lixve tuade&#xD;
an egregious fool of myself; so, as a logical con-&#xD;
clusion, I have a right to look gloomy. It is&#xD;
only the old story," he went on, meeting Annes-&#xD;
ley's eye. "Every six months, regularly, for the&#xD;
&#xD;
last three years, I have asked Irene Vernon to&#xD;
marry me. She has told me, regularly, in the&#xD;
gentlest and kindest manner, that she cannot&#xD;
think of such a things Each time I say to my~&#xD;
self that it shall be the last time; yet I go back&#xD;
and commit the- same absurdity over again.&#xD;
With the best possible intentions to the contrary,&#xD;
I committed it again this morning."&#xD;
"And the result?"&#xD;
"The result was that I made her cry, and&#xD;
that I should like to give myself a sound drub-&#xD;
bing, if that would do any good."&#xD;
"Cry!" repeated Annesley, somewhat aghast.&#xD;
"Good Heaven~! I wonder if women always cry&#xD;
on occasions of the kind?)'&#xD;
"Not if we may believe the testimony of some&#xD;
lucky fellows," said Seymour, dryly. "However,&#xD;
I don't think a man is worth much until he has&#xD;
been rejected once or twice," he added, resigned-&#xD;
ly. "It is like getting well thrashed at school-&#xD;
part of that sound, but unpleasant process called&#xD;
'finding one's level.' One or two straightfor-&#xD;
ward noes would not do you any harm, my good&#xD;
fellow."&#xD;
"Thanks. I suppose you mean that ,I am a&#xD;
puppy?"&#xD;
"No; I only mean that you are a little con-&#xD;
ceited, as, perhaps, you have some right to be.&#xD;
If you won't consider me impertinent, have you&#xD;
ever been rejected?"&#xD;
"Never!" Said Morton, who had -reasons of&#xD;
his own for being reticent on this point.&#xD;
"Then you have some of the needful dispi-&#xD;
pline of life yet to undergo. Let that be your&#xD;
consolation when the time of your discomfiture&#xD;
comes."&#xD;
"I hope it may never come l" said Annesley,&#xD;
with perfect sincerity.&#xD;
But, in his heart, he could not help thinking&#xD;
that there was a very good chance of its coming&#xD;
on the morrow.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
MEA cULrA.&#xD;
AFrER Annesley left, Katharine went to her&#xD;
own room, partly because she was obliged to lie&#xD;
down, and partly because she wanted to be al~ne&#xD;
and think over all that had occurred.&#xD;
From this process resulted great self-con-&#xD;
tempt, and greater self-reproach. Why had she&#xD;
been so foolish ?-why had she been so unde-&#xD;
cided ?-why had she let herself be swayed from&#xD;
&#xD;

214                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                                  MBA CTJLPA.                         215&#xD;
&#xD;
what she knew was right ?-why had she let him&#xD;
go away under a false impression that she might&#xD;
perhaps say yes ?-and, oh! above all, why had&#xD;
she been so silly as to cry? She asked herself&#xD;
all these questions, and did not find a single satis-&#xD;
factory answer for one of them. The more she&#xD;
thought of the matter-of that unsatisfactory,&#xD;
pointless proposal-the more vexed with' herself&#xD;
she became. She could no~ walk distractedly up&#xD;
and down the floor, because she was much too&#xD;
weak for such an exercise; and she could not&#xD;
tear her hair, because there was hardly any left&#xD;
to tear; but she did every thing else that people&#xD;
under stress of strong emotion are usually ex-&#xD;
pected to do-she set her teeth, she wrung her&#xD;
hands tightly together, and every now and then&#xD;
impatient exclamations (far from complimentary&#xD;
to herself) burst.from her lips. Nothing is more&#xD;
true than that "some people seem by intuition to&#xD;
'see only truth and right; others must needs work&#xD;
out their faith by failing and sorrow. They real-&#xD;
ize truth' by the pain of what is faThe, honor&#xD;
through dishonor, right by wrong repented of&#xD;
with bitter pangs." ~Katharine was one of the&#xD;
latter class. Looking back over the events of&#xD;
the last few months, regarding them as having&#xD;
~culminated in the events of the last few hours,&#xD;
-, no words can express the self-contempt and self-&#xD;
reproach that rushed over her. "St. John was&#xD;
right, I have thought of myself-of nobody but&#xD;
myself!" she said. "And this is the end. Ah,&#xD;
me! Are people always punished so much for&#xD;
considering themselves? If so, I wonder that&#xD;
anybody ever does it."&#xD;
Theinore she thought of Morton, the more&#xD;
the temptation of his offer gained strength, and&#xD;
yet the more firmly she determined to put it from&#xD;
her. "I should nanke &amp;amp; base return for his geir.&#xD;
erous kindness if I accepted him," she thought;&#xD;
yet what an attraction there was in himself and&#xD;
~in all that he offered her! There is neither sense&#xD;
nor truth in saying that a woman only feels this&#xD;
attraction when she is in love. Plenty of women&#xD;
feel it about plenty of men; yet instinct tells&#xD;
them that it is not the right feeling-not the&#xD;
feeling that will endure, and, enduring, sweeten&#xD;
all that even thehappiest married lives must know&#xD;
-so they resiSt it; and so, likewise, it often takes&#xD;
as hard a struggle to say No, as it is sometimes&#xD;
reported to take for saying Yes. The probabil-&#xD;
ities are that, if Katharine had loved Annesley&#xD;
as much as Juliet could possibly have loved&#xD;
Romeo, she would still have held firm to her&#xD;
refusal; for with all her weaknesses-and her&#xD;
story shows that she had a sufficient number&#xD;
&#xD;
of them - she possessed no inconsiderable&#xD;
amount of that rare strength which enables&#xD;
a human soul to come victorious from the&#xD;
most' fierce and terrible combat known to earth&#xD;
- the combat where self takes part against&#xD;
self, and the flesh rises against the spirit. But&#xD;
Fate had been kind enough to spare her this&#xD;
last, worst trial. She was not "in love" with&#xD;
him, as far as that common phrase can be taken&#xD;
to mean the eager,'impetuous passion that no&#xD;
obstacle of rank, time, distance, or age, can over-&#xD;
awe. Very probably she would have fallen in&#xD;
love after the most approved mode, if she had&#xD;
been of, an equal social position with himself, if&#xD;
she had not known that insuperable obstacles&#xD;
lay between them, or if she had not been occu-&#xD;
pied with other and graver considerations. As it&#xD;
was, however-at the risk of making her a little&#xD;
less interesting, the truth must be told-her&#xD;
struggle had not the romantic savor which a&#xD;
desperate passion hopelessly combated can alone&#xD;
give; the attraction that drew her toward Aunes-&#xD;
Icy was, in great degree, an attraction apart from&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
Yet not the attraction of those merely world-&#xD;
ly advantages which went with him. They had&#xD;
their weight, of course; it is only in Arcadia that&#xD;
people are entirely independent of such consid-&#xD;
erations; but their weight was infinitely less&#xD;
'than that of the faithful love, the warm devo-&#xD;
tion, the shielding protection, that would be hers,&#xD;
if she held out her hand to him. Think of her&#xD;
for a moment-think how lonely and friendless&#xD;
and desolate she stood! Then, if possible, won-&#xD;
der that the temptation was almost beyond her&#xD;
strength. Let it not be supposed, however, that&#xD;
any grandiloquent ideas of not loving him ~uf-&#xD;
floicratly made her hold back. She lovcd nobody&#xD;
else; and she did not doubt that a grande passion&#xD;
for this young paladin would come soon enough&#xD;
with time and opportunity to help it. That was&#xD;
not the consideration. Yet she-him-oh, what&#xD;
was the consideration? Tier head felt singularly&#xD;
dull and heavy. Before she was aware of it, tired&#xD;
Nature asserted itself, and she fell asleep.&#xD;
How long she slept, she had no means or&#xD;
telling; but the sun, which was streaming over&#xD;
the crystal essence-bottles of the toilet-table&#xD;
when slumber overtook her, had entirely veered&#xD;
round, and was dancing like a will-o'-the-wisp&#xD;
about the white ewer and basin on the wash-&#xD;
stand, when she woke-woke with a start, and&#xD;
found a bright face surrounded by crisp,' red&#xD;
curls bending over her.&#xD;
"Well," cried Miss Lester, "it is not possi.&#xD;
&#xD;
ble that you have really concluded to open your&#xD;
eyes at last! 1 began to think that you were&#xD;
going to sleep straight on into to-morrow. Dinner&#xD;
has been over ever so long, and mamma has been&#xD;
up two or three times to see about you. She came&#xD;
to me at last, and wanted' to know if I thought&#xD;
you could have taken morphine or any thing of&#xD;
the sort. What is the matter? Does your head&#xD;
ache9"&#xD;
No, not now," answered Katharine, putting&#xD;
her hand to the member in question, and trying&#xD;
to remember what made her feel so vaguely un-&#xD;
comfortable. Suddenly, it all came back to her&#xD;
with a rush, Mr. Annesley! Oh-yes-that&#xD;
was it! How painfully bright the sunshine was!&#xD;
Why could she not have been left to sleep in&#xD;
peace?&#xD;
"It does ache, I am sure," said Miss Lester,&#xD;
who was watching her. "Is it the sun that&#xD;
dazzles you? P11 close the blinds, if you say&#xD;
so."&#xD;
"No, thank you," said Katharine, rising lan-&#xD;
guidly. "I believe I will get up. I am sorry&#xD;
to have troubled Mrs. Lester so much. I really&#xD;
did not mean to sleep so long."&#xD;
"People can't be expected to wake them-&#xD;
selves," said Miss Lester, composedly. "If you&#xD;
are going to get up, I will ring for your 'dinner.&#xD;
You must feel the need of something to eat."&#xD;
The dinner was rung for, and the dinner&#xD;
came up-a sight to tempt the worst valetudi-&#xD;
narian appetite. ' Even in the midst of difficul-&#xD;
ties; people can sometimes be tempted by dainty&#xD;
dishes served on fineold china,'with damask of&#xD;
dazzling whiteness, as Katharine satisfactorily&#xD;
proved. She ate her dinner with considerable&#xD;
appetite; and, after it was finished, Miss Lester&#xD;
cleared her throat, and made a plunge into con-&#xD;
versation.&#xD;
"I would not tell you before you had taken&#xD;
your dinner," she said, "for a little thing often&#xD;
takes' away one's appetite; but there is some-&#xD;
body down-stairs to see you - somebody who&#xD;
came after you went to sleep."&#xD;
Poor Katharine! This was dismaying intel-&#xD;
ligence indeed, for she thought of nobody but St.&#xD;
John; and, thinking of him, she gave such a&#xD;
gasp, and grew so pale, that Miss Lester was&#xD;
quite frightened. "Good gracious!" cried she,&#xD;
making a wild dart at a cologne-bottle on the&#xD;
toilet-table. "Surely you are not going to faint.&#xD;
I had not an idea-dear, dear! why, it is only Mr.&#xD;
Warwick, Miss Tresham! What on earth is the&#xD;
use of looking like this about him?"&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick!" repeated Katharine, and&#xD;
&#xD;
she gave another gasp, and tried to laugh. "Oh,&#xD;
how much you startled mel I was thinking of&#xD;
another and-and quite a different person. I am&#xD;
glad Mr. Warwick is here. But surely he has&#xD;
not come to see me?"&#xD;
"To see you, and nobody else," answered&#xD;
Miss Lester, keeping the cologne-bottle still in&#xD;
her hand, and looking suspiciously ready for all&#xD;
possible emergencies. "He drove over from&#xD;
Hartsburg, and arrived just before dinner. You&#xD;
were asleep then, and mamma would not let you&#xD;
be waked; besides, Mr. Warwick said he was in&#xD;
no hurry. Take your time, therefore, about see-&#xD;
inghim. If you don't feel like it just now-"&#xD;
"Of course, I feel like it," said Katharine,&#xD;
rising and walking to the mirror. "I like Mr.&#xD;
Warwick extremely, and~it is very kind of him&#xD;
to come and see about me," she went on. "I&#xD;
wonder how he found out? Oh, my poor hair!&#xD;
How much he will be astonished to see me such&#xD;
a fright!"&#xD;
"Who-Mr. Warwick? Why, he saw you&#xD;
when you looked a hundred times worse!"&#xD;
cried Miss Lester, heedlessly. Then she stopped,&#xD;
and stammered, as Katharine turned round in&#xD;
amazement: "I mean, of course-I forgot you&#xD;
did not know-oh, pshaw! Miss' Tresham, it is&#xD;
all nonsense, and I am sure you ought to know&#xD;
that, if it had not been for Mr. Warwick, you&#xD;
would not be alive now. He found'you there in&#xD;
Hartsburg, when you were lying ill, 'at the mercy&#xD;
of that abominable quack who, I hope, is hanged&#xD;
by this time."&#xD;
"He found me? Mr. Warwick found me?"&#xD;
said Katharie, in the depths of astonished be-&#xD;
wilderinent.&#xD;
After this, there was no help for it. Whether&#xD;
Miss Lester would or not, she was forced to tell&#xD;
the whole history, as far as she was acquainted&#xD;
with it; and Mr. Warwick had to listen r~signed~&#xD;
ly to Mrs. Lester's gentle commonplaces below,&#xD;
while Katharineabove, listened breathlessly to&#xD;
the account of his good deeds. When, at last,&#xD;
she went down-stairs, the remembrance of what&#xD;
she had just heard was flushing h~r cheeks and&#xD;
lighting her eyes, until John Warwick, who had&#xD;
naturally expected to see a pale, !anguid invalid,&#xD;
was quite startled by the eager, impetuous girl&#xD;
who opened the sitting-room door and walked up&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
"Mr. ~ she said, "I have just beard&#xD;
-I did not know before~-how very, very kind&#xD;
you have been to me. Forgive me-oh, pray,&#xD;
forgive me-for having given you so mi~eb trou-&#xD;
ble! I am very grateful to you! They tefl me&#xD;

I should have died, if you had not found me. I&#xD;
should not like 1o die, and-and I am so grate-&#xD;
ful to you 1"&#xD;
She spoke hurriedly, clasping her hands ea-&#xD;
gerly together; then stopped suddenly at the last&#xD;
wotds, and extended them toward him, with an&#xD;
impulsive warmth that he had never seen her&#xD;
display before.&#xD;
"My deai~ Miss Tresham, they have been im-&#xD;
posing upon your credulity, I fear," he said,&#xD;
laughing, as he took the hands and shook them&#xD;
cordially. "I am delighted to see you looking&#xD;
so well I-You have done wonders with her, Mrs.&#xD;
Lester." Mrs. Lester, who was sitting by, smiled&#xD;
a bland acknowledgment.-" I had not expected&#xD;
to find you so entirely recovered in such a short&#xD;
time; but Mrs. Grump told me that your con-&#xD;
valescence was very rapid. I saw Mrs. Grump&#xD;
as I came through Hartsburg; I spent last night&#xD;
at the Eagle Hotel. She sent her best wishes to&#xD;
"And Mrs. Grump-deceitful woman I-kept&#xD;
me in iguaoranee about you. And Dr. Randolph&#xD;
-Mr. Warwick, why did you forbid them to&#xD;
tell me? You might have known that I would&#xD;
find it out sooner or later."&#xD;
"On my honor, I did not forbid them. 'I&#xD;
never thought of such a thing. You must pour&#xD;
out the vials of yous.,~tadignation on Randolph's&#xD;
head, not mine. By-the-by, this is the first op.&#xD;
portunity that I have had to return an article&#xD;
of your property which, strangely enough,&#xD;
chances to be in my possession.~~&#xD;
He put his hand in his pocket, and drew forth&#xD;
the little, worn volume of Thomas it Kempis, on&#xD;
which Katharine darted at once, with a cry of&#xD;
recognition and delight.&#xD;
"'My 'Imitation of Christ! '" she exclaimed.&#xD;
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Warwick! I am so glad&#xD;
to see it again! I thought I had surely lost it&#xD;
during all that dreadful time of which I remem-&#xD;
her nothing. it is such a pleasure to recover&#xD;
it!"'&#xD;
"If I was fortunate enough to be instru-&#xD;
mental in saving your life," he said, "you may&#xD;
thank that book for my having done so. If the&#xD;
landlady had not brought it to me, I should&#xD;
have gone away totally unconscious that I had&#xD;
passed the night under the same roof with&#xD;
you.&#xD;
Katharine opened the book, and pointed to&#xD;
the faded writing.&#xD;
"It seems like a blessing accorded to ker&#xD;
prayers," she said, softly. "I can hardly think.&#xD;
that I deserved it. But you have not told me-&#xD;
&#xD;
- HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I don't understand-how did you chance to be&#xD;
in Hartsburg?"&#xD;
"Your memory is bad," he said, smiling.&#xD;
"Have you forgotten a note that I wrote you&#xD;
when I left Tallahoma, nearly two months&#xD;
ago?"&#xD;
"A note?"&#xD;
"Yes, a note. Stop and try to think what it&#xD;
was about. That will tell you how I chanced to&#xD;
be in Hartsburg."&#xD;
She stopped and thought for a minute, be-&#xD;
fore she succeeded in grasping the missing idea.&#xD;
Then, like a flash, her face cleared, and she&#xD;
looked up at him.&#xD;
"I remember! You said you were going to&#xD;
take Felix Gordon to schooL Were you on your&#xD;
way back to Tallahoma when you stopped in&#xD;
Hartsburg?"&#xD;
"Yes, on my way back."&#xD;
"And you found me accidentally?"&#xD;
lie pointed to the book.&#xD;
"If we may call that accident."&#xD;
Her glance followed his.&#xD;
"No," she said, reverently; "it was not acci-&#xD;
dent. I hope I am sufficiently grateful-to God&#xD;
first, and to you afterward. You have done so&#xD;
much-so very much-for m'e, and I, alas! Can&#xD;
do nothing for you.~~&#xD;
"Yes," answered Mr. Warwick, smiling&#xD;
slightly, "you can do something for me, and&#xD;
you must not be surprised when I tell you&#xD;
what it is."&#xD;
"I shall not be surprised, no matter what&#xD;
it is. I am only too glad to hear that there is&#xD;
something," she said, earnestly.&#xD;
Mrs. Lester, with commendable discretion,&#xD;
had left the room by this time, and they were&#xD;
alone. Miss Tresham was sitting on a low chair&#xD;
at one side of the fireplace, while Mr. Warwick&#xD;
still stood before her, in his favorite attitude,&#xD;
with one hand on the mantel. After her last&#xD;
words, he sat down, and looked at her kindly&#xD;
with his clear blue eyes.&#xD;
"I did not expect you to make such a rash&#xD;
promise," he said. "But, since you have done&#xD;
so, I will take advantage of it. What I ask of&#xD;
you, then, is-confidence."&#xD;
She started, colored, and looked at him a lit-&#xD;
tle apprehensively.&#xD;
"Pray be quiet," he said. "I won't distress&#xD;
you, if it is possible to avoid it. Can't you trust&#xD;
me-a little?"&#xD;
"I trust you a great deal," she answered,&#xD;
simply.&#xD;
"Very well, then. Trust me thus far.-.~-tell&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MEA CULPA-&#xD;
&#xD;
me candidly, as you would tell your own brother,&#xD;
the reasons why you left Tallahoma."&#xD;
There was a minute's silence. Katharine&#xD;
checked a question which rose to her lips, sting.&#xD;
gled with herself a minute-the varying color&#xD;
made that evident-then lifted her eyes, and&#xD;
spoke as quietly as he had advised.&#xD;
"I will not ask why you think it necessary&#xD;
to make this inquiry, Mr. Warwick. I am sure&#xD;
you must have some good reason, or you would&#xD;
not do it. You don't know how strangely your&#xD;
question strikes me after-after some thoughts I&#xD;
had this morning. It seemed to me then that,&#xD;
looking back on the last few months, I could&#xD;
trace all that I have suffered to one thing-my&#xD;
own cowardice. I ought to have spoken plainly&#xD;
from the first-spoken as I will endeavor to&#xD;
speak now, if you have patience enough to listen&#xD;
to me. Don't be astonished if I go very far&#xD;
back, though; I must do it to make you under-&#xD;
stand."&#xD;
"I can spare you a little, perhaps," he inter-&#xD;
posed here. "Do you know that the Catholic&#xD;
priest-what is his name 2-Mr. Martin, from&#xD;
Saxford, was summoned when you were so ill?&#xD;
I sent for him principally that I might inquire&#xD;
if you had any friends or relations. I thought&#xD;
he was more likely to know than any one else.&#xD;
Well "-as she colored deeply-" I see that you&#xD;
anticipate what I am about to say. You must&#xD;
not blame him. I pressed him. hard, and he&#xD;
thought you were certainly dying. Under these&#xD;
circumstances, he finally told me that you had a&#xD;
brother-the Mr. St. John I had seen in Talla-&#xD;
homa."&#xD;
"And you thought-"&#xD;
"I thought nothing, believe me, that I ned&#xD;
hesitate to tell you. If I ask your confidence&#xD;
now, it is because, knowing thus much, I find it&#xD;
necessary to know more; why, I will tell you&#xD;
presently."&#xD;
"You dqn't despise me for having been so&#xD;
-so cowardly about acknowledging him 2"&#xD;
A dark cloud came over the lawyer's face,&#xD;
a cloud which absolutely frightened Katharine,&#xD;
and yet which had no possible relation to her.&#xD;
"I do not even blame you," he answered. 1&#xD;
"More than that I can not say, until I know&#xD;
more. I am sorry to impose such a hard task I&#xD;
upon you, but-"&#xD;
"It is not a hard task," she interrupted, ea-&#xD;
gerly. "It is almost a relief to tell it to you. 1"&#xD;
(she looked at him wistfully), "I begin to wish&#xD;
that I had told you every thing when you asked I&#xD;
me some time ago, if you remember."&#xD;
&#xD;
2'17&#xD;
&#xD;
"It would have been much better if you&#xD;
had."&#xD;
"Yes, I see that now. But then it seemed&#xD;
so useless, it seemed like a confidence without a&#xD;
purpose. You could not help me, I thought, and&#xD;
so why should I trouble you? Afterward, after&#xD;
he came, of course, it was harder to do. You&#xD;
can't tell what he has been to me all my life,"&#xD;
she said, covering her face with her hands.&#xD;
"I can imagine."&#xD;
"My first remembrance is one of terror and&#xD;
dislike of him. We lived in' Jamaica with an&#xD;
aunt-our parents were both dead-and even yet&#xD;
it makes me burn with indignation to think how&#xD;
her life was robbed of all peace and sunshine by&#xD;
St. John. Mr. Warwick, I can't go into particu-&#xD;
lars. They would not interest you, and they&#xD;
would make me uncover some bitter ashes which&#xD;
I tried-tried hard to bury in her grave. Only&#xD;
believe that he rep~tid her kindness by ingrati-&#xD;
tude and bad conduct of every possible descrip-&#xD;
tion. I ought to explain, perhaps, that she had&#xD;
adopted us from our earliest childhood, from my&#xD;
earliest recollection. We never bore ~ny other&#xD;
name than hers."&#xD;
"Yet your brother-" he began.&#xD;
"Is named St. John,~~ she interrupted. "Yes,&#xD;
I know. But 1St. John is merely one ofhis hap.&#xD;
tismals, the one by which we always called him,&#xD;
and it was only when he 'Lally separated from&#xD;
us that he dropped Tresham and adopted his&#xD;
second Christian name as a surname. Well, at&#xD;
last it became impossible that my aunt could&#xD;
endure him any longer. She wrote to his guar-&#xD;
dian in England, a mian whom he had never seen,&#xD;
and represented matters so forcibly that St. John&#xD;
was removed from her nominal control. The&#xD;
guardian desired that he should be sent to Eng-&#xD;
land, which was done. After that, as a means&#xD;
of escaping from him in case he came back, she&#xD;
left Jamaica and went to live in Porte Rico. It&#xD;
was in vain, however, as far as her object was&#xD;
soneerned. After a while he followed us; he&#xD;
was in need, and wanted money. Slender as my&#xD;
aunt's neans were, she was forced to comply with&#xD;
~iis demands, as a condition of getting rid of&#xD;
him. This lift her too poor to move away again&#xD;
.f she had felt disposed to attempt it. That was&#xD;
ut the beginning. St. John did not come very&#xD;
)ften, but he continually wrote for money; and&#xD;
~ou can imagine what it was to have this, eon-&#xD;
inual cloud hanging over one's life and home,&#xD;

was a man named Fraser, who seemed his special&#xD;
comrade; or, rather, I -should say, his leader in&#xD;
the life on whiek he entered. That man-well,&#xD;
you have heard t~f him. St. John told me that&#xD;
he is Mrs. Gordon's husband."&#xD;
"Yes; I have heard of him."&#xD;
"Perhaps, then, you know better than 1 do&#xD;
how St. John lived during the intervals of&#xD;
months, sometimes years, in which we never&#xD;
heard of him. As I have said, he only came or&#xD;
wrote when he was in need. He had not been&#xD;
hears from for a long time, when my aunt died&#xD;
and left me desolate. Almost her last words im.&#xD;
plored me to leave the West Indies and go to&#xD;
some place where he would not be able to trace&#xD;
me. 'He will ruin your life if you do not escape&#xD;
from him,' she said. 'lie will destroy every pros-&#xD;
pect of happiness that you could possibly have if&#xD;
he knows where you are, and if you acknowledge&#xD;
him and give him a claim upon you.' She was&#xD;
dying, Mr. Warwick; you may believe that I was&#xD;
ready enough to promise to avoid him if I possi-&#xD;
bly co~xld. Well, I left the West Indies, and&#xD;
went to Englaud to an old friend of hers, who&#xD;
obtained a very good situation for me at florn-&#xD;
thorne Place. I had lived there a year-con-&#xD;
tented, at least, if not happy-when one day St.&#xD;
John appeared. By some means he had tracked&#xD;
me down; from the mere desire to torment me,&#xD;
I honestly believe, for he knew I was in no posi-&#xD;
tion to' aid him. This man of whom I have spo-&#xD;
ken, Fraser, I mean, had inherited a large Scot-&#xD;
tish property, and St. John was living with him&#xD;
as his secretary. The knowledge that he was&#xD;
living near mc, the knowledge that he knew&#xD;
where I was, filled me with the old terror. I&#xD;
remembered my dear aunt's dying admonition,&#xD;
and, coupled with my own inclination, it made&#xD;
me resolve to leave England and come to Amer-&#xD;
ica. I felt that I should be more safe from him&#xD;
here. You know how I came, how kindly your&#xD;
sister took me, how quietly and happily I lived.&#xD;
Butit all ended on that November evening when&#xD;
you brought me his letter; the same evening that&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon' arrived.' Do you remember it?"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick's memory was very good. He&#xD;
said, with perfect truthfulness, that he remem-&#xD;
bered it.&#xD;
" After I received that letter, the terror of his&#xD;
coming pew upon me to an almost morbid de-&#xD;
gree. At one time I had nearly made up my&#xD;
mind to leave Tallahoma, but then that was very&#xD;
hard to do; I had grown so much attached to&#xD;
the children, and Father Martin (to whom alone I&#xD;
'told my story) counselled me against it. 'Wait,''&#xD;

HOUSE.                                           MEA OULPA.                      21&#xD;
&#xD;
he said; and I waited, alas! too long. I was&#xD;
very miserable during that time, though you were&#xD;
the only person who perceived it. I remember&#xD;
one day I was reading St. John's letter over&#xD;
again, in the parlor, when somebody came in, and&#xD;
I hastily put it out of sight in a sheet of music&#xD;
and forgot it. Not long afterward Mr. Annesley&#xD;
was turning over my music and found it. This&#xD;
seems a trifling thing, no doubt, but you don't&#xD;
know what a shock it was to mc. I seemed to&#xD;
real~he who and what he was so clearly when it&#xD;
came to the point of speaking of him to some-&#xD;
body else. Of course, the feeling grew because it&#xD;
was indulged. I did not combat it as I should&#xD;
have done; and, at last, it reached such a point,&#xD;
that I felt as if I would sooner die than ~eknowl-&#xD;
'edge him. 1 see now how wrong it all was, how&#xD;
nothing but selfish regard for the opinion of the&#xD;
world, and wretched human pride, was at the bot-&#xD;
tom of it; but then I gave way, and tried to&#xD;
make myself believe that it was right to give way&#xD;
to it."&#xD;
"I can't say that I think it was wrong," ob-&#xD;
served the lawyer, gravely.&#xD;
"Yes," she said, "it was wrong. I see things&#xD;
more clearly now; somehow it seems as if I al-&#xD;
most see them as clearly as I might have seen&#xD;
them on that death-bed which I so narrowly&#xD;
escaped. We are not put into this world to&#xD;
think of ourselves. Now, I thought of nobody&#xD;
but myself. I shirked the plain duty, I tried to&#xD;
throw off the plain burden which God put be-&#xD;
fore me, and all out of mere worldly opinion and&#xD;
fear lest my name should be linked with-with-&#xD;
0 Mr. Warwick, nothing can ever do away with&#xD;
this! It was cowardice, it was wretched cowar-&#xD;
dice, and all that has followed is my fault."&#xD;
"Pardon me if I remind you that you are&#xD;
wandering 'from the point," said Mr. Warwick.&#xD;
"It is a bad thing to be discursive. Suppose you&#xD;
go back to causes, and let effects alone."&#xD;
She saw what he meant. "I won't excite&#xD;
myself," she said. "There is no use in that,&#xD;
you know. But, all the same, it is my fault.&#xD;
Well, St. John came; and, of course, after he&#xD;
came, matters with me grew worse. After I took&#xD;
the first false step-I see now that it was a false&#xD;
step-in the way of concealing his relationship,&#xD;
and attempting to conceal his visits, I went&#xD;
deeper and deeper' into difficulties. At first it&#xD;
seemed very simple. He assured me that he&#xD;
would leave as soon as he received the money I&#xD;
~nis able to give him, and I counted certainly on&#xD;
lis keeping his word. But then came his recog-&#xD;
nition of Mrs. Gbrdon, and his writing to herhus-&#xD;
&#xD;
band, and all the rest. Have you seen Mrs. Gor- "Well?" (as she paused).&#xD;
don, Mr. Warwick? have you heard how she "You cannot mean Mrs.-Mrs. .Annesley?"&#xD;
came in and found St. John with me, and how "I do mean Mrs. Annesley."&#xD;
she charged me with having brought him "But this is only a conjecture on your part~&#xD;
there?" you are not sure?"&#xD;
"Yes," he said, kindly. "I have heard "Pardon me-I am perfectly sure."&#xD;
both from herself' and from Bessie. Don't trou "Mr. Warwick 1"&#xD;
ble yourself to go over that."                 "Well?" (smiling again).&#xD;
"Well, after she left, a sudden impulse "Oh, don't smile!" cried she, passionately,&#xD;
seemed to take possession of me; I felt desper- covering her face with her hands. "It-it is&#xD;
ate, felt as if I must get away, let what would be so horrible! That she could-that she would-&#xD;

day following New Year. I thought I would go "Be reasonable," said he, gently. "I was&#xD;

stantially the same that she had told Annesley when she wrote that advertisement."&#xD;
with regard to the days she spent in Sanford, " But she knew-anybody must have known&#xD;
the nervous, feverish desire of flight which had -that it was a cruelly dishonorable thing to&#xD;
beset her~ and the manner in which she went to do! How could she tell what she might bring&#xD;

"I have heard that, too," said Mr. Warwick. "Does that excuse her?"&#xD;
"I see you think that I have heard every "Well-no. Morally speaking, I suppose it&#xD;

220                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                            MISS TRESHAM'S REPLY.                   221&#xD;
&#xD;
I tell you something else that made me speak&#xD;
of this? I thought you might perhaps respect&#xD;
my opinion-a man of my age is apt to be vain&#xD;
on that point, you know-and I thought that, if&#xD;
you were inclined to take an extreme view of Mrs.&#xD;
Annesley's conduct, I might throw all the weight&#xD;
of this opinion into the other scale. You have no&#xD;
friend in the world," he went on, with energy,&#xD;
"who feels your interest more than I do, or&#xD;
who would be quicker to resent your injuries.&#xD;
But, on my honor, I do not think that Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley can be very much blamed. Remember&#xD;
that we must not judge people by our own stand-&#xD;
ard of honor and dishonor, of right and wrong.&#xD;
We must, as much as possible, judge them by&#xD;
their own. Mrs. Annesley's code Is of the world,&#xD;
worldly judge her by that, Miss Tresham, and&#xD;
see if you cannot excuse her."&#xD;
"No," said the girl, with a hard, set look&#xD;
about the mouth. "Judged by the merest code&#xD;
of worldly honor, this was a dishonorable act.&#xD;
Don't try to make me think otherwise, Mr. War-&#xD;
wink; I cannot. Besides, what does it matter?&#xD;
-Mrs. Annesley is nothing to inc."&#xD;
"I am not sure of that," he said. "She may&#xD;
be a good deal to you some day; that is, if you&#xD;
are wise. You must exense me if I speak of&#xD;
something that does not seem exactly my con-&#xD;
cern. Miss Tresham, you would not let such a&#xD;
thing as this weigh against Morton's honest,&#xD;
unselfish love ?-Morton," he proceeded, ear-&#xD;
nestly "whom I have known ever since he was&#xD;
a child, and who is certainly one of the very best&#xD;
fellows in the world?"&#xD;
"No,'1 said Katharine, quietly, "I am glad&#xD;
to say that it has not weighed with me. In&#xD;
utter ignorance of his mother's act, I told Mr.&#xD;
Annesley this morning that I could not marry&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Miss Tresham!"&#xD;
"Well," said shea a little surprised at the&#xD;
astonishment on his face, "what is there so&#xD;
amazing in that? Surely, Mr. Warwick, you did&#xD;
nOt think that I would marry him?"&#xD;
"I thought so - yes," said Mr. WaTwiek,&#xD;
heginning to recover himself n little. "WIxy&#xD;
should 1 not think so? If you were my own sis-&#xD;
ter, I could not wish a better fate for you than to&#xD;
b~ his wife. A. woman could scarcely ask more&#xD;
than Morton Annesley is able to give."&#xD;
"And yo~,s advise me to accept him?"&#xD;
"I do, most emphatically."&#xD;
"I had not expected this of you," she said,&#xD;
impulsively., "Think what a position you would&#xD;
place me in! Mr. Annesley himself is every&#xD;
&#xD;
thing that is kind, and generous, and disinter- -&#xD;
ested; but his mother-his friends-what just&#xD;
ground they would have for complaint if I were&#xD;
selfish enough to accept him! It lt)0k5, perhaps,&#xD;
as if it would be doing a good thing for myself,"&#xD;
she went on; "but in truth (unless I was willing&#xD;
to find happiness in fine dresses and jewels, and&#xD;
the like), I should be doing the worst possible&#xD;
thing. Such a marriage would be too ill-assorted&#xD;
for any hope of happiness. As Mr. Annesley&#xD;
grew older-he is little more than a bright,&#xD;
warm-hearted boy now-he would feel it himself.&#xD;
Can you not think what it would be to him-he&#xD;
so proud, so sensitive to the least shadow of dis-&#xD;
honor-to know that his wife's brother was-&#xD;
was- 0 Mr. Warwick, don't you see how blind&#xD;
and foolish I should be, even to my own best in-&#xD;
terests, if I did such a thing?"&#xD;
"I see this~" said Mr. Warwick, whose ear&#xD;
was quick enough to catch the pathetic ring in&#xD;
her voice, "that you are on the eve of doing what&#xD;
many high-strung natures have done before you;&#xD;
that is, of throwing away substantial happiness&#xD;
for an unsubstantial scruple. I am a practical&#xD;
man, Miss Tresham, and, you may take my word&#xD;
for it, that all these things of which you have&#xD;
spoken arc not worth considering when placed in&#xD;
comparison with a heart like Morton's. If you&#xD;
love him-'-"&#xD;
"If I loved him," interrdpted she, "I might&#xD;
~not be able to reason as I have done. But I&#xD;
don't love hm!"&#xD;
"You don't?"&#xD;
"No-I don't. I am sure I don'ti~now why,"&#xD;
she said, with half puzzled frankness. " Nobody&#xD;
knows better than I do how charming he isno-&#xD;
body could admire or respect him more; but I&#xD;
do not love him. Perhaps because I have had&#xD;
other things to think of~ or because I knew how&#xD;
many insurmountable barriers were between us,&#xD;
or, again, because I have learned to put little&#xD;
faith in the admiration and attention that any&#xD;
moderately-attractive woman is sure to re-&#xD;
ceive."&#xD;
"But are you certain of this; arc you certain&#xD;
that you are not deceiving yuurself?"&#xD;
U 1 am certain. He was here this morning,&#xD;
and I have had all day to think about it; that is,&#xD;
until I went to sleep. I assure you that saying&#xD;
No to him did not cost me a pang, unless (I will&#xD;
be quite frank with you) it was the pang of feel~&#xD;
ing my own loneliness."&#xD;
"You feel your loneliness, then?"&#xD;
Her eyes softly filled with tears-tears that&#xD;
had no bitterness in them. She looked at the&#xD;
&#xD;
little, worn volume closely clasped in her hand;&#xD;
then round the pleasant, home-like room.&#xD;
"They are all very kind to me," she said.&#xD;
"But how could I feel other than lonely here?"&#xD;
Something in the simple words, something in&#xD;
the pathetic glance, .went to the lawyer's heart&#xD;
like a shaft. He knew more-.much more-than&#xD;
she did the loneliness of her position; much more&#xD;
than she did of the difficulties that surrounded&#xD;
her. Looking at her as she sat in the deep, old-&#xD;
fashioned arm-chair, she seemed so fair, so deli-&#xD;
cate, so little fitted to cope single-handed with&#xD;
that world over which only the sternest triumph,&#xD;
that an impulse which he could not resist-an&#xD;
impulse which he afterward bitterly regretted-&#xD;
made him speak words that Katharine little ex-&#xD;
pected to hear.&#xD;
"Yes, I can see that you are lonely," he said,&#xD;
with something-a gentleness that she did not&#xD;
quite understand-in his voice. "Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am, do you think it would be a hard fate to ex-&#xD;
change this loneliness far care, and protection,&#xD;
and love, even though there were little besides&#xD;
these things to win your heart? I am old&#xD;
enough to be your father, but if you can resolve&#xD;
to trust yourself with mc, 1 do not believe you&#xD;
will ever repent it; at least" (with an uncon-&#xD;
scious inflection of pathos), "I promise you that&#xD;
no effort shall be wanting on my part to prevent&#xD;
your ever repenting it."&#xD;
For one bewildered moment the room seemed&#xD;
going round with Katharine. Was she awake?&#xD;
-was she asleep ?-was it Mr. Warwick who had&#xD;
spoken these words? Was it he sitting there,&#xD;
or-or- How foolish she was! He had not&#xD;
meant that-she was sure she had misunder-&#xD;
stood. He, of all men, had not meant to ask&#xD;
her-&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick," she said, turning pale, "it&#xD;
cannot be - it is not possible .-..-you do not&#xD;
mean-"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick cut the confused sentence very&#xD;
abruptly short.&#xD;
"I mean," he said, quietly, "that I have&#xD;
asked you to marry me. Will you do it?"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
MISS TRESHAM'S REPLY.&#xD;
THIS time, at least, Katharine could not mis- 1&#xD;
take the meaning of what she heard. Deliber-&#xD;
ately-with his eyes open, and every outward ap-&#xD;
pearance of a sane man-Mr. Warwick asked&#xD;
15&#xD;
&#xD;
herif she would marry him! It is not too much&#xD;
to say that amazement literally superseded every&#xD;
other feeling with her. It is seldom, indeed,&#xD;
that an offer comes with quite such a force of un-&#xD;
expected surprise. Usually, if there is no posi-&#xD;
tive preparation, there is a suspicion at least, a&#xD;
word, a glance, or, it may be, only a tone, to show&#xD;
what is coming. But here there was absolute&#xD;
want of preparation, absolute astonishment, and,&#xD;
for a time at least, absolute incapacity to reply.&#xD;
Then the realities of the occasion began to as-&#xD;
sert themselves; and Katharine tried to meet the&#xD;
emergency.&#xD;
"It seems impossible that you can be in ear.&#xD;
iest, Mr. Warwick," she said; "but if-if you&#xD;
arc, I scarcely know what to say to you."&#xD;
"Would you like time to consider?" he&#xD;
asked. "If so, take it."&#xD;
"No, I do not require time to consider,"&#xD;
she replied. "No amount of consideration&#xD;
could teach me any fitting words in which to&#xD;
thank you-In which to say to you how deeply I&#xD;
feel the kindness which has made yo'z speak to&#xD;
me thus. I see, I feel; why you have done so;&#xD;
but "-clasping her hands, and speaking pas-&#xD;
sionately-" you certainly cannot think so poor-&#xD;
ly of me as to believe that I would repay all&#xD;
that you have done, all that you would do for&#xD;
me, by marrying you because I am poor and&#xD;
lonely; because I need a home and a friend?"&#xD;
"My dear Miss Tresham," said he, smiling&#xD;
gravely, ~'I am not a romantic or passionate&#xD;
lover like the man whom you have already re.&#xD;
ejected. I was not very much addicted to pas-&#xD;
sion or sentiment in my youth; but now-well,&#xD;
now I am equally beyond the age and the Incli-&#xD;
nation for either. Still I think I may say that&#xD;
I ~love you well enough to be willing to be ac-&#xD;
cepted even on those terms. Don't look so much&#xD;
astonished "-as her eyes opened on him large&#xD;
and startled. "I have spoken on the strength&#xD;
of an unaccountable impulse. When I entered&#xD;
this room, I had not the least intention of such&#xD;
a thing. I was sure you would marry Annesley.&#xD;
[t was only when I discovered my mistake that&#xD;
[thought I might give you the option of accept-&#xD;
or rejecting-a man old enough to have left&#xD;
Love-making behind him! Only "-here he took&#xD;
a short turn up and down the room-" the heart&#xD;
will not grow old with years. We may think&#xD;
~hat it does, we may flatter ourselves that it has,&#xD;
intil suddenly there comes an hour when pas-&#xD;
lion, strong as any passion of youlhseizes it, and&#xD;
sre know that age has left one citadel uncon-&#xD;
iuered. I tell you this," he went on, pausing&#xD;

MOnTON HOUSE-.&#xD;
&#xD;
again in front of her, "because I do not wish&#xD;
you to think that I have asked. you to marry&#xD;
mc simply on account of your lonely position. I&#xD;
have loved you longer than you can imagine-&#xD;
longer than I knew myself-but it never occurred&#xD;
to me to think of telling you so. My age alone&#xD;
put such a declaration out of the question. Now,&#xD;
however-"&#xD;
"Now you think of me!" cried Katharine,&#xD;
with a rush of tears-a softer shower than that&#xD;
which had driven poor Morton from the field-&#xD;
"0 Mr. Warwick, I am so sorry, if I had known&#xD;
this earlier, I might perhaps have learned to love&#xD;
you, I might have been able to marry you; but,&#xD;
as ~t is, I-oh, pray forgive me-I cannot."&#xD;
"You cannot promise to marry me, and trust&#xD;
that the love will come with time?"&#xD;
She shook her head mournfully. Through&#xD;
their brimming tears, her eyes said . again "For-&#xD;
give me," as she answered, "I dare not."&#xD;
~L Think a moment,~~ he said, in evident agi-&#xD;
tation. "Believe me, I do not press you from&#xD;
mere selfishness. Do you not think you like me&#xD;
even well enough to marry me for the sake of&#xD;
that home and that friend of which you spoke a&#xD;
moment ago?"&#xD;
"I like you too well, much too well for that,"&#xD;
she cried, passionately. "Don't you see-sb,&#xD;
don't you see how it is! If I liked you a little&#xD;
lese,:I might marry you for such a motive; while&#xD;
if I liked you a little more, I should marry you&#xD;
for your own sake. But, standing between the&#xD;
two, I only feel your generous effort to make me&#xD;
happy~. I am only sure that I should repay you&#xD;
very ill, if I accepted you for any reason but the&#xD;
right one."&#xD;
There was silence for some time after this.&#xD;
Through her tears, Katharine glanced up into&#xD;
Mr. Warwick's face, and was surprised to see&#xD;
how grave and thoughtful it looked, as he stood&#xD;
with his eyes absently fastened on the fire. He&#xD;
*did not know that she was looking at him; so he&#xD;
'p         allowed an expression of troubled perplexity to&#xD;
betray itself; which he would otherwise have&#xD;
kept concealed. Something in this expression&#xD;
struck the girl with a vague foreboding of ill.&#xD;
The fear that had found such frequent expression&#xD;
when Annesley was with her, suddenly sprang to&#xD;
her mind and to her lips again. Before she was&#xD;
consulous of what she was doing, she leaned for-&#xD;
ward and touched his arm.&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick," she said, as he turned qui~k-&#xD;
ly toward her, "I am sure something is the mat-&#xD;
ter-something in which I am concerned. Tell&#xD;
me what it is."&#xD;
&#xD;
The quickness with which she leaped to a&#xD;
conclusion would have taken anybody but a law-&#xD;
yer by surprise-would have thrown anybody but&#xD;
a lawyer off his guard. It required all Mr. War.&#xD;
wick's professional command of countenance not&#xD;
to show how closely her shaft had struck home.&#xD;
As it was, he had only just presence of mind&#xD;
enough to smile&#xD;
"Why should you think that?" he asked.&#xD;
"Can't you imagine that I was thinking of my.&#xD;
self; and my own great disappointment?"&#xD;
"No, you were not thinking of yourself;" she&#xD;
answered. "You were thinking of me-I am*&#xD;
sure of it. Mr. Warwick, if it is any thing about&#xD;
St. John-it is something about St. John!" cried&#xD;
she, suddenly springing to her feet, as she caught&#xD;
an expression on his face that it was beyond his&#xD;
power to control. "I knew it! I felt sure of&#xD;
it! Oh! "-with a ring of imploring agony in&#xD;
her voice-" tell we what it is."&#xD;
"Sit down, Miss Tresham," said Mr. War.&#xD;
wick, almost peremptorily. "There is no know.&#xD;
ing what harm you may do yourself by this ex-&#xD;
citement. There has been a little trouble in&#xD;
Tallahoma, and Mr. St. John was mixed up in&#xD;
it," he added, quietly; "but I assure you every&#xD;
thing is right and straight now. Still, if you in.&#xD;
sist upon hearing about it__"&#xD;
"Oh, indeed I do I',&#xD;
"I can give you an outline~ of the matter. I&#xD;
am sorry, however, that you force me to it, for&#xD;
I think you have had agitation enough for one&#xD;
day. Why, you arc quivering like an aspen.&#xD;
leaf!"&#xD;
"Never mind. 1 cannot help it, it is purely&#xD;
nervous. Go on, please; tell me what he has&#xD;
done."&#xD;
As gently as possibLe Mr. Warwick told her,&#xD;
softening the blow by every menus in his power.&#xD;
But no gentleness, no softness, could break its&#xD;
awful force, could shut out from her sight the&#xD;
hideous truth. "0 my God!" she exclaimed,&#xD;
when she first clearly understood whet it was&#xD;
that he had done. But aft~r that, no sound came&#xD;
from her lips. She sat with her face buried in&#xD;
her hands, and only now and then a long, shud-&#xD;
dering sigh seemed to shake her whole frame&#xD;
from head to foot. Even after Mr. Warwick&#xD;
ceased speaking-after he had made his last&#xD;
attempt at pitying comfort-she still sat bent&#xD;
down, crushed, as it were, by the double blow of&#xD;
anguish and disgrace.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, this will never do," said he,&#xD;
at last. "This is not like you-is it worthy of&#xD;
you? Can you find no comfort in the fact that&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS TRESHAM'S REPLY.&#xD;
&#xD;
no one is aware of Mr. St. John's complicity in&#xD;
the 'matter? Ifave you not sufficient reliance in&#xD;
mc to feel that the secret is as safe with me as&#xD;
with yourself?"&#xD;
"I should be the most ungrateful human&#xD;
being in the world if I did not feel it," said she,&#xD;
liftiugher face-so pale and drawn, that it abso-&#xD;
lutely startled him-" but not even your kind-&#xD;
ness can alter the fact itself-the terrible, awful,&#xD;
overwhelming fact! Mr. Warwick, I never, zEever&#xD;
thought I could sink so low as this!"&#xD;
"Which do you consider worst," said Mr.&#xD;
Warwick, coolly, "this conduct, or that of which&#xD;
you have spoken with regard to yourself?"&#xD;
"Oh, this, this!"&#xD;
"There I don't agree with you. The man&#xD;
who robs a defenceless woman, as this man has&#xD;
robbed you, does not, it is true, make himself&#xD;
amenable to the law, as when he breaks into a&#xD;
bank; but he does transgress the higher law-&#xD;
the moral law-as much, or, perhaps, more; and&#xD;
the man who violates the one, will not hesitate&#xD;
to violate the other, whenever he thinks that he&#xD;
can do so with impunity. Miss Tresham, believe&#xD;
me, you need not regret Mr. St. John's moral de-&#xD;
gradation-I mean that you need not think he&#xD;
has taken any deeper step. When he entered&#xD;
the bank to rob it, he was committing an act&#xD;
which made him liable to the penalties of the law,&#xD;
if the law could detect him; but he was not,&#xD;
even in degree, taking a deeper step in abstract&#xD;
dishonesty, than when he entered it to rob&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"But the disgrace-the terrible disgrace!"&#xD;
"So far as that goes, so far as the opinion&#xD;
of the world goes, a thing cannot be disgraceful&#xD;
which is not known. If you trust me at all,&#xD;
trust me this far, nobody ever shall know of*&#xD;
this."&#xD;
"0 Mr. Warwick-"' Once more the tears&#xD;
came, and ended all further speech. lie made&#xD;
no effort to stop them, but walked away to the&#xD;
window, and left her to herself; sure that those&#xD;
tears would do more to relieve her heart and&#xD;
clear her brain than any words of his could.&#xD;
As he stood there, feeling sad and sore enough&#xD;
at heart, he watched the last red glow of sunset&#xD;
fade from the top of some distant trees, and the&#xD;
lovely veil of spring twilight begin to steal over&#xD;
the earth. Something in the scene and in the&#xD;
hour carried his thoughts back to that evening&#xD;
when the doctor said that the life so near him&#xD;
now, the life at that moment throbbing with the&#xD;
emotions and sorrows of earth, would pass before&#xD;
morning into eternity, when he had gazed at the&#xD;
&#xD;
228&#xD;
&#xD;
steady advance of night, and waited for Morton&#xD;
Annesley to decide whether or not the heart o~&#xD;
that dying girl was his. "Poor fellow!" said&#xD;
the lawyer, half aloud, forgetting his own cause&#xD;
for wounded feeling in pitying the young man&#xD;
who had been so full of honest, impulsive grief.&#xD;
Strangely enough, he was standing at that mo-&#xD;
ment exactly in the place where Mortoiihad stood&#xD;
a few hours before waiting to~ hear his sentence.&#xD;
Katharine noticed it when she turned to ~peak,&#xD;
and saw that he had left her side.&#xD;
"And, ~owing this, you couA~selied me to&#xD;
marry Mr. Annesley!" she cried, her voiqe, with&#xD;
a sudden flash of indignation in it, mal4ng him&#xD;
start, as it rang through the silent room, "9h,&#xD;
how could you do it? how could yon think so&#xD;
meanly of me? bow could you think that I&#xD;
would carry such a stain as this to a man who&#xD;
loved me?"&#xD;
"You do not serioAisly think that your broth.&#xD;
er's conduct leaves any stain on you?" said he,&#xD;
coming back, with something of his usual slight,&#xD;
grave smile on his lip. "Miss Tresham, I am&#xD;
astonished at you! Such talk sounds like melo-&#xD;
dramatic nonsense in a novel or a play! If An.&#xD;
nesley were here, he would tell you what I tell&#xD;
you for him, that Mr. St. John is not of t~w least&#xD;
importance when considered in connection ~&#xD;
yourself. As for this affair in Tallahoma I s&#xD;
but one result springing from It, and that is a&#xD;
good one. It has taken the scoun-the man&#xD;
out of your path. Trust me that, as longas you&#xD;
remain in Tallahoma, you have nothing to fear&#xD;
from him. He will never return there, for he'&#xD;
knows that 1 hold evidence against him which&#xD;
would convict him in any court of law."&#xD;
"And yet you let him go?"&#xD;
"Yes, I let him go."&#xD;
"On my account?"&#xD;
"Do I need to tell you that? do you sup-&#xD;
pose any other, motive could have induced me to&#xD;
spare him?"&#xD;
"And you have done all this for me, while&#xD;
I-" she stopped, and covered her face with her&#xD;
hands, held them so ~ moment, and then looked&#xD;
up. "Mr. Warwick," she said, with exquisite&#xD;
gentleness, "I begin to appreciate your offer of&#xD;
a moment ago; I begin to see more clearly why&#xD;
you made it. I begin to understand that, when&#xD;
you office~ me a home, you did so because no&#xD;
other home is open to me. You have not spoken&#xD;
of N~2i~, Marks. I feel sure that he does not wish&#xD;
m~o return to them."&#xD;
For the second time during the coujue of~ this&#xD;
interview Mr. Warwick's face betrayed him. The&#xD;

.224                        MORTON HOUSE.                                                           MISS TRESITAM'S REPLY.                   225&#xD;
&#xD;
climax to her speech came so suddenly, that he&#xD;
was not prepared for it; and, feeling her eyes&#xD;
steadily fastened on him, he knew that evasion&#xD;
or concealment was useless. The truth had&#xD;
already' shown itself and the truth must be&#xD;
told.&#xD;
"You are right, Miss Tresham," he said;&#xD;
"my sister's husband has fallen many degrees&#xD;
in my estimation, by his refusal to receive you&#xD;
again. But you mistake very much when you&#xD;
think that I asked you to marry me merely to&#xD;
offer you a home. It is true that your loneli-&#xD;
ssencocwagcd me to tell you of my lore, but&#xD;
that love existed long before this loneliness came&#xD;
upon you."&#xD;
"But still it is true-Mr. Marks does not wish&#xD;
me to return 1"'&#xD;
"It is true," he answered. He could say no&#xD;
more, for he was too indignant with his brother-&#xD;
h-law to attempt to make excuses for his con-&#xD;
duct (which really, if he had looked at it dispas.&#xD;
sionately, did not merit indignation), and he&#xD;
could not but be wounded by Katharine's indif.&#xD;
ference to those last words of his-words which&#xD;
had been so full of earnest feeling.&#xD;
"Oh," said the girl, wearily, "how desolate I&#xD;
am, how very desolate 1 I cannot stay much&#xD;
longer with these kind people, and yet where to&#xD;
go, what to do? Mr. Warwick, am I asking too&#xD;
much of your kindness and forbearance when I&#xD;
beg you to advise me what to do?"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick might have replied that he had&#xD;
already advised, and that his advice, in two differ-&#xD;
ent cases, had been unhesitatingly rejected. But&#xD;
he was one of the rare men-rarer, by far, tl~an&#xD;
heroes, or geniuses, or exceptional wonders of any&#xD;
other description-who, on emergencies, can put&#xD;
themselves aside, and speak or act for others&#xD;
without any bias of egotism. He considered&#xD;
for a moment, and then he said:&#xD;
"I think that Tallahoma would be the best&#xD;
place for you just now, because Tallahoma is&#xD;
safe from Mr.' St. John. You are not well&#xD;
enough to be molested by him, and you are only&#xD;
saib from that molestation when you are where&#xD;
he"will not dare to venture. 'Will you allow me&#xD;
to ask if you gave him all the money which&#xD;
Marks paid to you?"&#xD;
"All. I borrowed ten dollars from Mrs.&#xD;
Marks to go to Saxford-by-the.way, I must&#xD;
return It to you for her-and in Saxford I sold&#xD;
my watch, when I hardly knew what I was do-&#xD;
ing, to enable me to go. farther. They were cry&#xD;
honest at the hotel in Hartsburg. I found all&#xD;
that money safe in my bag when I got well. I&#xD;
&#xD;
have it still, for Mrs. Crump would not receive&#xD;
any before I left. She laughed, and told me I&#xD;
could settle the bill when I came back. Dr.&#xD;
Randolph said the same thing. After those bills&#xD;
are paid, however, I scarcely think there will be&#xD;
any left."&#xD;
"Never mind those bills. I have already set.&#xD;
tled them. Surely"-as he saw a deep fiu~h&#xD;
come over her face-" you do not mind being&#xD;
indebted to me for such a trifling amount, and,&#xD;
I hope,' for such a short time. Remember, Miss&#xD;
Tresham "-smiling a little sadly-"I am old&#xD;
enough to be your father. 1 assure you that 1&#xD;
have the bills, and you may pay me the full&#xD;
amount as soon as you are able to do so. Wait,&#xD;
however, and don't attempt to pay me until you&#xD;
are able. Give me the pleasure of helping you a&#xD;
little. Now "-hurrying on-" the question is,&#xD;
have you money enough to come and board in&#xD;
Tallahoma while I endeavor to obtain another&#xD;
situation for you? I am sure I can do this in a&#xD;
short time."&#xD;
"I believe I have a hundred and fifty dol-&#xD;
lars. The watch had been my aunt's, and was&#xD;
richly jewelled. It should have sold for much&#xD;
more; but I-I was not in a condition to do any&#xD;
thing but take the first sum that was offered me.&#xD;
Nevertheless, this amount is enough to support&#xD;
meforatime, is it not?"&#xD;
"For a short-" Mr. Warwick began, when&#xD;
the door behind him opened and shut quickly, a&#xD;
silk dress rustled across the floor, and through&#xD;
the dusky gloom Irene Vernon came forward,&#xD;
her eyes shining, her cheeks glowing, and her.&#xD;
self looking like some radiant picture that. had&#xD;
stepped from its canvas to walk the earth 'in&#xD;
guise of flesh and blood.&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick," she began, abruptly~ "and&#xD;
you, Miss Tresham, pray pardon me when I tell&#xD;
you that I have overheard a little of your conver-&#xD;
sation. I was passing along the terrace a mo-&#xD;
ment ago, and, as I stopped by the window, I&#xD;
caught the sound of your voices, and heard a&#xD;
few words-enough to send inc in upon you,&#xD;
and make me venture to ask you" (addressing&#xD;
Katharine) "a question. Am I right in gather-&#xD;
ing from those few words, that you do not intend&#xD;
to return to Mrs. Marks?"&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Vernon, you are tjuite right,"&#xD;
said Katharine, quietly. "I do not intend to&#xD;
return to Mrs. Marks, for the simple reason that&#xD;
Mrs. Marks does not wish my services any long-&#xD;
~&#xD;
"And you 4e talking of going to Tallahoma&#xD;
to-to board?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick has advised something of the&#xD;
sort."&#xD;
"Well, I will give you better advice than Mr.&#xD;
Warwick's, then," said the young beauty, with&#xD;
her most royal tone and look. "You can go&#xD;
back to Tallahoma-in fact, I think it is a good&#xD;
thing to do-but you must go back with me.&#xD;
No-not a word! I positively won't hear a word&#xD;
until I have finished what I have to say. It is&#xD;
very uncivil to interrupt people, is it not, Mr.&#xD;
Warwick ?-Well, Miss Tresham, I was about to&#xD;
tell you that I heard to-day from my sister, for&#xD;
whom 1 have been waiting here, and she cannot&#xD;
join me. My troublesome brother-in-law has&#xD;
managed to break his leg-Flora says she thinks&#xD;
he did it on purpose to keep her at home-~and&#xD;
she begs me, instead of going on to Mobile, to&#xD;
come back to Lagrange and wait for her. Now,&#xD;
I will go hack on onecoudition-that you go with&#xD;
me. Flora took a great fancy to you, and so did&#xD;
George, and they will both make you heartily&#xD;
welcome, not to speak of the pleasure of my&#xD;
society. You can get well there at your leisure,&#xD;
and-and-indeed it is just the thing for you.-&#xD;
Mr. Warwick, tell her that shc ought to go!"&#xD;
"Miss Vernon, you are too kind, much too&#xD;
kind," began Katharine, in that tone which inev-&#xD;
itably presages a refusal; when Miss Vernon&#xD;
broke in upon her with an utter disregard of her&#xD;
own theory about interruptions:&#xD;
"You are mistaken, Miss TreshamIam not&#xD;
at all too kind-nobody ever was too kind ja&#xD;
this world. If there were such a thing as being&#xD;
too kind, it might not, perhaps, be quite as hard&#xD;
a world to live in as it is. That is social cant;&#xD;
and you know how I hate social cant. I see&#xD;
plainly," she went on, "that you are going to,&#xD;
say something about 'deeply grieved,' and 'im-&#xD;
possible to accept,' and all that sort of thing. I&#xD;
will take it for granted that you have already&#xD;
said it; and I will ask you to give me o~e rea-&#xD;
son-a single reason-why it is impossible for&#xD;
you to accept the kindness (saying that it is a&#xD;
kindness) which I have offered you?"&#xD;
"I have no claim upon such kindness," Kath-&#xD;
arine said.&#xD;
"You have the claim of my liking you; what&#xD;
better could there be?"&#xD;
"I have not even that claim upon your sis-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
"Upon my sister! Why she likes you ex-&#xD;
ceedingly; and, even if she did not, she would&#xD;
be glad to see . you all the same.-Mr. Warwick,&#xD;
did you ever hear any thing quite as absurd as&#xD;
the idea of her making a bughear out of Flora,&#xD;
&#xD;
of all the people in the world?" (Persuasive),&#xD;
"Tell her, please, that she ought to come!"&#xD;
(Imperative), "Tell her that she must come!"&#xD;
Said Mr. Warwick, looking ~a little amused:&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, don't you think it would be well&#xD;
to consider Miss Vernon's proposal? it seems&#xD;
to me that it is 'a very clear way, and a very&#xD;
pleasant way out of all your difficulties-present&#xD;
ones, at least."&#xD;
"But I really cannot," said Katharine.&#xD;
"Miss Vernon is mistaken if she thinks it is&#xD;
social cant w&#xD;
that her hen I say that she is too kind-&#xD;
kindness blinds her to the objections&#xD;
against her plan."&#xD;
"Name them," said Miss Vernon, with busi-&#xD;
ness-like brevity.&#xD;
"I am under very many obligations already,"&#xD;
said Katharine. "I cannot consent to increase&#xD;
their number."&#xD;
"That is nothing more nor less than pride,"&#xD;
said Miss Vernon, concisely; "and pride, no&#xD;
doubt you are aware, is the besetting sin of&#xD;
human nature, and the one we are most called&#xD;
upon to struggle against. I was reading in your&#xD;
-what do you call it ?-your manual, the other&#xD;
day, and I saw that you were specially told to&#xD;
mortify your will. Now, here is a good oppor.&#xD;
tunit~ for you to mortify your will by going with&#xD;
me to Lagrange."&#xD;
Katharine laughed. It was impossible to do&#xD;
otherwise-the girl's manner, half.serious~ half-&#xD;
whimsical, made such a strange and complete'&#xD;
contrast to the highly-wrought frame of mind&#xD;
which she had dispelled by her entrance. She&#xD;
had brought a fragrance of vkilets into the room&#xD;
with her, and as she stood in the soft gloaming,&#xD;
with the firelight gleaming on her silk ~lress and&#xD;
a 'gold locket that hux~g round her throat, she&#xD;
seemed to have brought an atmosphere of other&#xD;
things besides violets-of sweet thoughts and&#xD;
noble impulses, and generous, kindly deeds.&#xD;
Katharine was won by her now, as, indeed,&#xD;
she had been from the first; and, when two soft,&#xD;
white hands took hers, and a gentle voice said,&#xD;
"See! I ask it of you as a favor to me. 'Won't&#xD;
you come?" she remembered how tenderly those&#xD;
hands had nursed her through her desperate Ill-&#xD;
ness, and she felt that refusal was no longer&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
"Yes," she said, "I will come."&#xD;
And so it was settled. Thus, swayed as it&#xD;
seemed by the merest chance, yet led, who can&#xD;
doubt, by the kindest care, she took the road back&#xD;
to Lagrange-that road that was leading slowly&#xD;
but surely to the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="226-227" xml:id="VAC8070-00000119"/>&#xD;
226                              MOIITOI&#xD;
It was determined that they would leave the&#xD;
*iext morning. Miss Vernon, on her own (that&#xD;
is, her sister's) account, was anxious to do so;&#xD;
but she ~ood-naturedly proposed to wait several&#xD;
days if Miss Treshain desired. To her surprise,&#xD;
Katharine begged that the journey might not be&#xD;
deferred on her account.&#xD;
"I am quite well enough to travel," she said;&#xD;
"and, if I could only go away from here to-mor-&#xD;
row morning early, I should be so glad-so very&#xD;
glad 1"&#xD;
"But Mr. Anues-," began Miss Vernon, in&#xD;
amazement. Then she paused, her bright-blue&#xD;
eyes turned keenly on her companion's face, and&#xD;
in a nzoi~ient the truth flashed over her.-" Miss&#xD;
Tresham," she cried, sharply, almost angrily (they&#xD;
were alone in Katharine's room a little while be-&#xD;
fore supper), "you don't mean to say that you&#xD;
have rejected Morton Annesley 2"&#xD;
"Miss Vernon," answered Katharine, with a&#xD;
touch of the, besetting sin of human nature, "did&#xD;
you think it likely that I would accept him 2"&#xD;
"Did I think? Of course, I thought you&#xD;
would accept him," returned Miss~Vernon.&#xD;
"Why should I not think so? You seemed to&#xD;
like him, and he is certainly every thing that a&#xD;
woman could wish to like. Miss Tresham, you&#xD;
can't have done such a thing!,'&#xD;
"Yes, I have," said Katharine, who was&#xD;
tired of the .subject, and could not bear the&#xD;
idea of running another gantlet t~f remonstran-&#xD;
ces. "Yes, I have; and, if you only knew my&#xD;
reasons for having done so, I atn surb you would&#xD;
not blame me."&#xD;
"I toould blame you I" cried Miss Vernon,&#xD;
indignantly. "I lon't believe that, if I knew&#xD;
~'y or evely reason that could possibly have in-&#xD;
fluenced you, I should blame you a single de-&#xD;
gree less than I do now."&#xD;
"Don't make rash assertions," said Kath-&#xD;
arine, smiling faintly, "I cannot go into a detail&#xD;
of all the motives that influenced me; but, put.&#xD;
ting most of them aside, one is, or nught to he,&#xD;
~nough~to exonerate me from blame. Miss Ver-&#xD;
non, I grant all Mr. Annesley's good qualities&#xD;
so cordially that I think the woman whomarries&#xD;
him ought to love him devotedly.. Now, I don't&#xD;
love him at all. Would you advise me to return&#xD;
all the generous devotion that is willing to give&#xD;
so much by a cold sort of liking that is not able&#xD;
to giv6 any thing?&#xD;
"But Is it possible that you really do not&#xD;
love him?"'&#xD;
"It is certainly possible; and-ah, me! I&#xD;
must write to-night and tell him so. The letter&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
can be delivered after we leave, in time to pre-&#xD;
vent his coming here to-morrow morning."&#xD;
"You are determined to go, then?"&#xD;
"The decision rests with you; but I should&#xD;
like to go."&#xD;
"Of course, then, the matter is settled; We&#xD;
will go.-Heigho!" sighed the young lady to her-&#xD;
self, as she left the room. "Poor Morton !-.&#xD;
poor, dear fello#!' How strangely contrary to&#xD;
what we expect, things turn out sometimes!"&#xD;
That night Katharine sat down to write her&#xD;
letter to Annesley. Taken at any time, or un-&#xD;
der any circumstances, it was a hard letter to&#xD;
write; but, with an aching head, and, worse yet,&#xD;
an aching heart, the difficulties of composition&#xD;
were many times increased.&#xD;
Everybody does the same thing in a case like&#xD;
this. Everybody spoils one sheet of paper after&#xD;
another; makes beginnings with the desperate&#xD;
intention, "This 8kall do!" becomes disgusted&#xD;
at the third line, throws it aside disdainfully, or&#xD;
wrathfully crumples it up, and dashes at another&#xD;
fair page, with the same result. One stilted ad.&#xD;
dress follows another; the gamut of endearing,&#xD;
or respectful, or uncivil terms is run from end&#xD;
to end, until at last-if common-sense can man-&#xD;
age to get a hearing-the grand conclusion of&#xD;
so many experiments is simple, and generally&#xD;
brief.&#xD;
Thus it was with Katharine. After getting&#xD;
well on in half a dozen lengthy epistles, she at&#xD;
last thought how foolish and vain all words be-&#xD;
sides the few strictly necessary ones were, and&#xD;
the result of this thought was the following&#xD;
note:&#xD;
"DEAR Mx. ANKESLEY: Miss Vernon has&#xD;
kindly asked me to accompany her back to La-&#xD;
grange and spend a few weeks at her sister's&#xD;
house until I am strong enough to find another&#xD;
situation. I shall leave with her to-morrow&#xD;
morning. This arrangement, made since I saw&#xD;
you, renders it necessary that I should write and&#xD;
tell you how deeply I feel your kindness, and&#xD;
how impossible it is for me to accept all you&#xD;
have offered me. I will not pain you-as I know&#xD;
I should do-by speaking of the great disparity&#xD;
in our social positions, and of other greater ob-&#xD;
stacles, which under any circumstances would&#xD;
stand between us. It is enough for me to say&#xD;
that the woman whom you honor with your heart&#xD;
should love you as you deserve to be loved-as&#xD;
~ome women far mere ~worthy of you than 1 am&#xD;
will yet love you-and that this love it is not In&#xD;
my power to give you. Forgive me, Mr. .Mues-&#xD;
&#xD;
'il&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
GOOD SAMARITANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Icy, if' this sounds ungraeious-souuds as if I&#xD;
had forgotten all the many kindnesses which&#xD;
are, in truth, written on my heart. I must&#xD;
speak frankly, and make myself clearly under-&#xD;
stood, for your sake, as well as for my own.&#xD;
Every feelingexcept the one feeling which alone&#xD;
you would be willing to accept, I have for you.&#xD;
Each one of them makes me your warm and life-&#xD;
long friend; but all of them put together are not&#xD;
strong enough to make me your wife. God bless&#xD;
you, Mr. Annesley! God make you happy! God&#xD;
reward you for all your generous kindness! It&#xD;
is hard to close this letter here, and yet there&#xD;
is nothing more to say, unless I ask you again&#xD;
to forgive me.&#xD;

It was done. For the second time that day&#xD;
Katharine deliberately put aside the love and&#xD;
the protection which two different men, each&#xD;
well worthy of trust, had offered her, and with&#xD;
the blind, heedless, yet sometimes divine impulse&#xD;
of youth, turned from the golden gifts of life,&#xD;
those gifts for which some wretched women are&#xD;
willing to sell themselves into legal bondage, and&#xD;
went her way alone. It had been a struggle, a&#xD;
hard struggle, in both cases; it was a struggle,&#xD;
even after this letter was written, to seal it and&#xD;
lay it aside, saying: "Lie there, happy days, full&#xD;
to the brim of love and content, and soft belong-&#xD;
ings, and tender care, and glittering pleasure!&#xD;
Lie there, sweet dreams of what might be, of&#xD;
affection ripening into love, and trust growing in&#xD;
sweetness and strength with every passing year I&#xD;
Lie there, words, and looks, and tones, that will&#xD;
never see the light; days possible, yet forever&#xD;
unborn; emotions never to be felt, and the whole&#xD;
current of a life never to be lived!" It was hard&#xD;
to hold out the arms, saying: "Come, weary days&#xD;
filled with toil, uncheered by any smile from kin.&#xD;
dred lips, or glance from loving eyes! Come,&#xD;
days that lead among the rough by-ways of the&#xD;
world, and toss the living, yearning human heart&#xD;
from one strange household to another, that teach&#xD;
in every hour of your flight how some ps~t~ia are&#xD;
strewed with roses only that others may be filled&#xD;
with' thorns! Come, days within whose very bit-&#xD;
ter lurks a sweat that only these who meet you&#xD;
willingly can ever taste-a sweet like that grand&#xD;
victory which nohle deeds wring from defeat,&#xD;
which come when the spirit has dropped its&#xD;
arms after long conflict, and the divine secret&#xD;
%~f content begins to steal upon the soul, the&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
first knowledge of good and evil, the first star.&#xD;
tled, humbled thanks to God that He guided the&#xD;
blind eyes and the faltering hand, and gave at&#xD;
last the leaden casket with the precious jewel&#xD;
shrined within!"&#xD;
CHAPTER XL.&#xD;
gOOD SANARITANS.&#xD;
GREAT was the astonishment, and greater the&#xD;
consternation, of the Bellefont household when&#xD;
they heard of the intended departure of Miss&#xD;
Vernon and Miss Tresham. With Miss Lester in&#xD;
especial, these feelings verged strongly on indig-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
"Your sister is absurd. If Mr. Raynor chose&#xD;
to break his leg, surely she is able to nurse him&#xD;
without any assistance from you!" cried this&#xD;
young lady to Miss Vernon. "I thought you&#xD;
might be content to stay with me for a little&#xD;
while; you are not nearly strong enough to&#xD;
travel yet," she said, reproachfully, to Miss&#xD;
Tresham.&#xD;
Miss Vernon laughed, and Katharine apolo-&#xD;
gized, but they both rcmainedfirm in their inten-&#xD;
tion. Bellefont ch~rmcd wisely, but charmed in&#xD;
vain.&#xD;
"We must go," said Miss Vernon, decidedly,&#xD;
and Katharine echoed, "We must really go!"&#xD;
They did go, notwithstanding all the persua-&#xD;
sive eloquence employed by their kind hosts.&#xD;
And, when these last saw that the resolution was&#xD;
firm, they made a virtue of necessity and yielded&#xD;
gracefully, remembering that the law of hospital-&#xD;
ity is double, and that it is as incumbent to&#xD;
speed the parting as to welcome the coming&#xD;
guest.&#xD;
"You won't forget us, I am sure," said Mrs.&#xD;
Lester, wistfully, when she, kissed the young&#xD;
stranger who had taken such a hold en her&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
And she was right. In all the yesrs of her&#xD;
life Katharine never forgot the pleasant home&#xD;
which had opened its doors to her in the hour&#xD;
of her need, nor the cordial faces and. warm&#xD;
hearts that had surrounded her with kindness&#xD;
and care.&#xD;
When the last thanks had b~een uttered, the&#xD;
last farewdlls-many times repeated-.were over,&#xD;
and the last glimpse of pretty Bellefont, crown.&#xD;
ing its stately terraces, had vanished from sight,&#xD;
Katharine could scarcely restrain her tears. She&#xD;
felt as if she were bidding adieu to peace, as if&#xD;

&#xD;
she were leaving quiet behind her, and turning&#xD;
her face toward turmoiL She had seemed to&#xD;
escape out of that uneasy current of life in La-&#xD;
grange, to be able to spread her wings for wider&#xD;
flight and freer air, yet, of her own accord, she&#xD;
was now going back-she was now drifting again&#xD;
among the scenes and the people that haunted&#xD;
her like uneasy dreams of delirium, and inspired&#xD;
her with a strange shrinking impossible to analyze&#xD;
and hard to resist.&#xD;
"1 have an instinct approaching to a cer-&#xD;
tainty that I ought to have turned my face in&#xD;
the other direction," she said, to Miss Vernon, as&#xD;
the horses trotted gayly along the smooth road,&#xD;
and she felt that every moment was taking her&#xD;
neirer to Lagrange.&#xD;
"And I have an instinct approaching to a&#xD;
certainty that you are doing the right thing in&#xD;
taking this direction," answered Irene, smiling.&#xD;
"Now, the question is, which instinct is entitled&#xD;
to the most respect?"&#xD;
"Mine, I think, since I have a reason for it."&#xD;
"A good one?"&#xD;
"A very good ofle."&#xD;
"Suppose you let me judge of that."&#xD;
"It would involve a long story," said Katha-&#xD;
rine, "and that, I fear, wouldtire you.',&#xD;
"What, with a day's jou~hey before us, and&#xD;
not even a novel to read! My dear Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am, what are you thinking of? If you have a&#xD;
story, and if you would not object to telling it,&#xD;
there is nothing I should like better than listen-&#xD;
ing to it, especially if there were any good end&#xD;
to be gained by doing so."&#xD;
"There is no good end to be gained," said&#xD;
Katharine, "but, since I accept your hospitality,&#xD;
I certainly owe it to you to be quite frank about&#xD;
niyself. I don't know what may or may not be&#xD;
said about me in Lagrange, Miss Vernon; but,&#xD;
having so generously extended your hand to me,&#xD;
it is only right that you should be able to judge&#xD;
intelligently of the truth or falsehood of any re-&#xD;
ports which may be afloat."&#xD;
"Miss Tresham, if those are your reasons&#xD;
for telling your story, let me assure you that you&#xD;
need not do so. I rarely hear gossip, and I never&#xD;
believe it,"&#xD;
"Nevertheless, it exists; it is heard by every-&#xD;
body, and believed by the vast majority. Mrs.&#xD;
Raynor may like some explanation' of-"&#xD;
"I can answer for Flora, that she will not&#xD;
dream of such a thing."&#xD;
"At all events, you must allow me to speak,"&#xD;
ssldi~atharine, smiling faintly. "For once in my&#xD;
life I have been betrayed by cowardly folly into&#xD;
&#xD;
that tangled web which deception iii any form is&#xD;
sure to weave. The sooner I can clear myself&#xD;
of it, the sooner I may be able to forgive myself&#xD;
for having fallen into it. Shall I begin at the&#xD;
beginning, and tell you a tolerably long story?"&#xD;
"If you insist, I can only be frank, and say&#xD;
that I should like nothing better."&#xD;
So, as the carriage rolled along the pleasant&#xD;
country-road, with a changing panorama of sunny&#xD;
landscape all around, drifting clouds throwing&#xD;
sudden shadows over distant hill-sides, green&#xD;
valleys on either side, orchards in the full glory&#xD;
of tinted bloom, and dogs rushing out to bark&#xD;
from every way-side house, Katharine told the&#xD;
story of her life, in all its details, to a very sym-&#xD;
pathizing listen&#xD;
These two advanced nearer toward friendship&#xD;
during this day than in all the days of their for-&#xD;
mer acquaintance, For it is with friendship as&#xD;
with love-to be perfect, it has two requisites,&#xD;
congeniality and confidence. Without the for-&#xD;
mer, it is a merely fictitious sentiment; and,&#xD;
without the latter, it is a sentiment dwarfed at&#xD;
best, and restrained. Confidence is a golden key&#xD;
to almost every heart, and certainly a golden link&#xD;
to every affection, let its form or degree be what&#xD;
it will.&#xD;
Says Miss Thackeray, very sweetly and truly:&#xD;
"If love is the faith, then friendship is the char-&#xD;
ity of life."&#xD;
And so these -.two women were to find it.&#xD;
Neither of them was an ordinary woman; both&#xD;
of them had much of the rare sweetness that is&#xD;
born of strength, and in which a frivolous or&#xD;
petty nature is invariably lacking; and both of&#xD;
them had felt at different times, and in a different&#xD;
manner, the need of a friend.&#xD;
There had been a certain attraction between&#xD;
them from the first; but they were not quick to&#xD;
come together. Both of them had seen too much&#xD;
of the world for this. When at last the league&#xD;
of friendship-a league whfeh was to last all&#xD;
the rest of their lives-was struck, they made&#xD;
no protestations to that effect. It was under-&#xD;
stood somehow, and none the less felt and re-&#xD;
spected because it was tacit.&#xD;
"Now," said Katharine, when she had fin-&#xD;
ished, "you will do me a great favor if you will&#xD;
tell as much or as little of this to your sister as&#xD;
she requires to know or as you think fit. Re-&#xD;
member that I leave the matter entirely to your&#xD;
discretion.".&#xD;
"My discretion, then, will be likely to leave&#xD;
Flora very much in the dark," answered Irene,&#xD;
smiling. "It is better to err on the side of tell.&#xD;
&#xD;
ing too little than of telling too much, you kno~i&#xD;
-at least there is a remedy for the first, but uc&#xD;
remedy has ever been devised for the second. I&#xD;
shall tell her just as little as she will be satisfied&#xD;
to hear, Miss Treshani."&#xD;
Judging from her experience of human na-&#xD;
ture in general, and the feminine nature in par.&#xD;
ticular, Katharine was inclined to think that&#xD;
this would not be very little; but she thanked&#xD;
Miss Vernon for her discreet intentions, and it&#xD;
was decided that Mrs. Raynor's curiosity was,&#xD;
if possible, to be left ungratified.&#xD;
On the afternoon of the second day, many&#xD;
familiar signs began to show that they were ap.&#xD;
preaching the bourn of their journey-familiar&#xD;
Lagrange scenery around, familiar Lagrange&#xD;
faces on the road.&#xD;
Miss Vernon~ sa# that Katharine was grow.&#xD;
ing nervous, and tried to reassure her.&#xD;
"It is very absurd that you should persist in&#xD;
making bugbears of two of the most inoffensive&#xD;
people in the world," she said. "Miss Tresham,&#xD;
do you think I would have asked you to come&#xD;
with me, if I had not been able to promise you a&#xD;
cordial welcome?"&#xD;
Katharine acknowledged the truth of this, and&#xD;
much more like it; but still she was uncomfort..&#xD;
able-as, in fact, it was not remarkable that she&#xD;
should have been.&#xD;
It was almost a relief when at last the&#xD;
dreaded moment of final arrival came, when the&#xD;
carriage turned from the main-road, entered a&#xD;
wide gate, and, after half a mile of trotting along&#xD;
an avenue so full of sylvan beauty that it looked&#xD;
as if it might have led into the heart of a forest,&#xD;
came to a bridge crossing a pretty creek, a smooth&#xD;
lawn sloping on all sides like green velvet, and&#xD;
the usual country-house, with many piazzas, and&#xD;
wide, cool hall, where Mrs. Raynor was standing&#xD;
in the door waiting to receive them.&#xD;
"0 Irene, I am delighted you have come!"&#xD;
she cried "I hardly expected you so soon-in&#xD;
fact, I did not know whether or not to expect&#xD;
you at all.-Miss Tresham, I am charmed to see&#xD;
you "-she looked a little surprised, nevertheless&#xD;
-" I am glad that you are well enough to travel.&#xD;
Irene wrote me an account of your illness; it&#xD;
must have been dreadful I"&#xD;
"I have brought Miss Tresham to stay with&#xD;
us for some time," said Irene, before Katharine&#xD;
could answer. "She looks badly, does she not?&#xD;
We must try to bring back her roses before we&#xD;
let her go.-How is George?"&#xD;
"Dreadfully cross,".answered George's wife,&#xD;
with the most literal promptness. "The doctor&#xD;
&#xD;
says he is getting on very well, however; and,&#xD;
indeed, I suppose crossness is one sign of it.-&#xD;
Miss Tresham, I am very glad to hear that you&#xD;
I are going to stay with us. I am only afraid you&#xD;
will be dreadfully bored. I confess I am bored&#xD;
myself nearly to death. Bella and Louisa have&#xD;
been over continually, Irene. They are dear&#xD;
girls, you know; but by no means the liveliest&#xD;
of companions."&#xD;
"Where is George?" asked Irene.&#xD;
"In his own room. Will you go in and see&#xD;
him? He will like to hear all the Apalatka news.&#xD;
I will take Miss Tresham up-stairs.----This way,&#xD;
Miss Tresham. Dear me, how pale you are!&#xD;
You must lie down immediately, and take some&#xD;
refreshment. Do you prefer wine or cordial ?"&#xD;
Katharine's mind was soon set at rest on the&#xD;
score of her welcome. Mrs. Raynor was unaffect-&#xD;
edly glad to see her-glad of any thing or any-&#xD;
bocly to break the monotony of sick-room nurs-&#xD;
ing, for which Nature had rendered her singularly&#xD;
unfit.&#xD;
"George is so disagreeably cross that I am&#xD;
glad to get away from him for a little while," she&#xD;
said, as she sat down' in the room into which&#xD;
she showed Katharine, and plainly manifested&#xD;
her intention of remaining some time. "I have&#xD;
a horror of sick men," she went on; "tb.ey are&#xD;
so impatient, and ten times harder to manage&#xD;
than sick women, or sick children either. I am&#xD;
so glad Irene has come to relieve me a little. I&#xD;
am very glad, too, that she has brought you, Miss&#xD;
Tresham. I hope you will not let Mrs. Marks&#xD;
deprive us of you soon."&#xD;
"I shall not return to Mrs. Marks at all,"&#xD;
said Katharine, meaning to give an explanation&#xD;
of her position at once~ But Mrs. Raynor mere-&#xD;
ly opened her pretty blue eyes a minute, and&#xD;
then rambled on with her own grievances; she&#xD;
had a habit of paying very little attention to what&#xD;
was said to her, especially if she chanced to be&#xD;
interested by something else at the time.&#xD;
Miss Vernon soon discovered that her sister's&#xD;
Curiosity was nQt at all troublesome on the sub-&#xD;
ject of Katharine. Not to give her too much&#xD;
credit, however, it must be premised that this&#xD;
would scarcely have been the hase if she had&#xD;
entertained even a suspicion of any thing un-&#xD;
usual in the matter. True, Lagrange was full of&#xD;
gossip about Miss Tresham and Mr. Annesle.v;&#xD;
but Mrs. Raynor had been full of her own con-&#xD;
cerns, and had heard very little of this gossip.&#xD;
Besides, Katharine was certainly very "niceh"&#xD;
She herself had thought so, and Irene had taken&#xD;
quite a fancy to her. As Mr. Raynor had once&#xD;
&#xD;
b&#xD;

230                       MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
remarked, Irene did not often take fancies, espe-&#xD;
cially to women, and when, by some chance, she&#xD;
did take them, it was an understood thing that&#xD;
they were 'to he humored. Then, in her present&#xD;
desperate and doleful condition, Mrs. Raynor was&#xD;
so glad to see her sister that there was no doubt&#xD;
but that she would have welcomed the most dis-&#xD;
agreeable person in the world whom Irene might&#xD;
'have chosen to bring back with her.&#xD;
"I believe there is a good deal of talk about&#xD;
Miss Trc~ham," she said, indolently; "but, of&#xD;
course, we have no reason for minding that.&#xD;
These stagnant Lagrange people would talk'&#xD;
about a straw. By-the-by" (with some anima-&#xD;
tion), "Irene, have you any idea where Morton&#xD;
.&amp;amp;nnesley is ? ~'&#xD;
"Certainly I have," answered Irene. "He is&#xD;
down in Apalatka, staying with Mr. Seymour.&#xD;
Why do you ask? Have his good-natured&#xD;
friends been talking about him, too?'~&#xD;
"Indeed, they have; and, what is more, I&#xD;
fancy that Mrs. Annesley and Adela have been&#xD;
very uneasy."&#xD;
"Uneasy 1" repeated Irene, with a curl of&#xD;
her scarlet lip. "Pray what mischief did they&#xD;
think he was likely to get into? Surely he is old&#xD;
enough to manage his own affairs without being&#xD;
kept in leading-strings by his mother and sis-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
"They have every disposition to keep him in&#xD;
leading-strings; but I don't think they succeed&#xD;
very well," answered Mrs. Raynor. "He has a&#xD;
wifl of his own, notwithstanding that he looks so&#xD;
gentle. Adela French was here not long ago-&#xD;
'just before George broke his leg, that is-and,&#xD;
although-she said nothing on the subject, I could&#xD;
see that she was very uneasy."&#xD;
"About what?"&#xD;
"About the danger of his marrying Miss&#xD;
Tresham, I presume. For my part, 1 never be-&#xD;
fleyed that there was any probability of it. I al-&#xD;
ways felt sure that he has entirely too much&#xD;
sense for such a thing."&#xD;
'"It would be the best thing in the world for&#xD;
~ said Miss Vernon; "and, I am sure, it will&#xD;
not be his fault if he~Ioes not succeed in doing&#xD;
It. ' Is Adela french in Lagrange yet?"&#xD;
"I don't know, but I think not. George has&#xD;
kept me so closely at ~o~e"(in an aggrieved&#xD;
tone), "that I hardly know anything. I will ask&#xD;
fella when she comes to-day. She may know,&#xD;
and she can tell you all that people are saying&#xD;
alout Miss Tresham."&#xD;
"Thank you; but I have not the least curios-&#xD;
i~y on that score. I give them credit for any&#xD;
&#xD;
amount of ill-nature, just as much as if I had&#xD;
heard all they say."&#xD;
When Miss Ilaynor came, she proved fully&#xD;
capable of retailing all the gossip of which her&#xD;
sister-in-law had spoken. Miss Vernon listened&#xD;
with a disdainful curl of the lip; but still, she&#xD;
did listen; she felt that it was necessary to know&#xD;
exactly what was said of Katharine, in order to&#xD;
use to the best advantage those discretionary&#xD;
powers which the latter had given her. After&#xD;
all, however, the talk proved to be harmless and&#xD;
indefinite enough with all its ill-nature. La-&#xD;
grange had known nothing; and, therefore, La-&#xD;
grange had found it difficult to say very much.&#xD;
The chief hubbub seemed to have been raised&#xD;
about poor Morton Annesley. The kind friends,&#xD;
who always know all the particulars on these&#xD;
occasions, had declared, unhesitatingly, that he&#xD;
had "given his mother the slip,"'and eloped with&#xD;
Mrs. Marks's missing governess. Why he should&#xD;
have thought it necessary to give his mother the&#xD;
slip, or Why-if he wished to marry Mrs. Marks's&#xD;
governess-an elopement on either side was re-&#xD;
quisite, nobody was able to say~; but circumstan-&#xD;
tial evidence being strong against the two, they&#xD;
were formally condemned after the most approved&#xD;
form of popular justice. It was useless to hint&#xD;
(as one or two skeptical people did) that Mr. An-&#xD;
nesley had not left Lagrange until two weeks after&#xD;
Miss Tresham's departure. 7VeSt the wise ladies&#xD;
and gentlemen concerned were ready to reply,&#xD;
was by special arrangement. It was meant to&#xD;
lull suspicion, and throw people oft' their guard.&#xD;
No doubt Miss Tresham had gone on before to&#xD;
some appointed rendezvous, where Mr. Annesley&#xD;
had followed in due time, and a marriage had&#xD;
taken place. This point being settled to the&#xD;
satisfaction of everybodybut the most stoutly in~&#xD;
credulous, people became undecided whether Mr.&#xD;
Annesley would take his bride away somewhere&#xD;
(to Europe, probably), oc whether he would re-&#xD;
turn, and, with a high hand, "have it out" with&#xD;
his outraged family. Being, as usual, very stag-&#xD;
nant for subjects of interest , Lagrange hoped&#xD;
much for the latter event. Parties ran high on&#xD;
the question. Would or would not Mrs. .Annes-&#xD;
ley continue to live at Annesdale? "Mrs. An.&#xD;
nesley is a Christian woman; she will bear this&#xD;
severe trial as a Christian woman should, and re-&#xD;
main with her son," said one party. "Mrs. An-&#xD;
nesley is a woman of spirit and self-respect; she&#xD;
will certainly leave Anneadale, and go to Mobile&#xD;
with Adela French," said another party., Chorus&#xD;
of both parties, "What a sad pity for )frs.'An.&#xD;
nesley! Such a charming person! Mrs. Marks's&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
governess for a daughter-in.lawl Only what s&#xD;
might have expected, however; the idea of mv&#xD;
ing such a person to Annesdale! Might ha'&#xD;
known what would follow," etc., etc., etc.&#xD;
It was not to be doubted that Miss Vern&#xD;
felt a considerable degree of malicious enjo&#xD;
meat when, after a month of uninterrupted -go&#xD;
sip (to which the only drawback had been a d&#xD;
cided and uncomfortable dearth of material), tI&#xD;
news fell like a thunder-bolt on the county, tin&#xD;
she had returned to her sisters, bringing Mb&#xD;
Tresham-who was still Miss Tresham-with he:&#xD;
At first Lagrange was incredulous, then Lagran~&#xD;
was indignant, and finally Lagrange stood on it&#xD;
dignity, and said things more scornful and sligh&#xD;
big than agreeable and complimentary, about tb&#xD;
governess who was no longer a governess. Wh&#xD;
had she left Mrs. Marks? Lagrange was no&#xD;
curious, by any 'means; but still, it wanted t&#xD;
know that. Where had she been all this time&#xD;
and what was the reason that Mr. Annesley hai&#xD;
not yet made his appearance? Lagrange db&#xD;
not absolutely request people to tell their stor'&#xD;
to the marines, who were foolish enough to main&#xD;
statements about brain-fever, and Colonel Les&#xD;
ter's, and no connection with Mr. Annesley; but&#xD;
in its secret heart, it did not believe a word of&#xD;
the whole story, and waited grimly for what ii&#xD;
was pleased to call the "upshot of the matter."&#xD;
This did not come for some time, however.&#xD;
Miss Tresham remained quietly enough at the&#xD;
Raynors', and Mr. Annesley still' lingered in&#xD;
Apalatha. Poor Morton! That letter of Kath-&#xD;
arine's, written the night before her departure,&#xD;
had dealt him such a cruel and such a terribly&#xD;
unexpected blow, that he felt cowardly about go-&#xD;
ing back to Lagrange, about taking up again the&#xD;
familiar life from which so much sunshine had&#xD;
gone, he thought, forever, lie felt more inclined&#xD;
to remain with Seymour, to,~pend his days stroll-&#xD;
ing about the woods, with a gun on his shoulder,&#xD;
and a dog at his heels; his nights in talking or&#xD;
not talking to Godfrey, as he felt inclined, while&#xD;
they both smoked countless cigars. It was a&#xD;
dull, quiescent sort of life, but it suited his mood.&#xD;
It was doubtful when or how he would end it;&#xD;
and, all this time, Lagrange talked unceasingly,&#xD;
and Mrs. Annesley's anxiety nearly drove her into&#xD;
a fever.&#xD;
All this time, too, Katharine was winning back&#xD;
health, and strength, and bloom, and making 'her-&#xD;
self very attractive and very necessary in the Ray.&#xD;
nor household. The power to charm, the gift&#xD;
of diffusing brightness, was hers now as much as&#xD;
ever, and these new friends began to look a little&#xD;
&#xD;
GOOD SAMARITANS.                     231&#xD;
&#xD;
he injured when she talked of intended departure.&#xD;
it- "Why can't you stay?" Miss Vernon would&#xD;
ye ask; "why need you be in such a hurry to pro-&#xD;
cure a situation? Flora and George are both&#xD;
n absolutely in love with youj and both thank me&#xD;
y- on an average once a day for having brought you&#xD;
s- here. I am almost sorry to see Mr. Warwick&#xD;
e- come; I fear, every time, that he may have found&#xD;
ic a place for you."&#xD;
~t "He is trying to do so," said Katharine.&#xD;
:s Then she added, gratefully: "Mr. Warwick is&#xD;
r. very kind to me. He is the best friend, by far,&#xD;
e I ever had."&#xD;
a "One of the best," corrected Irene. "I am&#xD;
t- sure he has no better disposition to serve you&#xD;
o than-than Mr. .Annesley, for instance, lie has&#xD;
y better opportunity, that is all."&#xD;
it "Don't you think one is apt to be more grate-&#xD;
o ful for realities than for possibilities?" asked&#xD;
, Katharine, smiling. "Not but that I am very&#xD;
I much obliged to Mr. Annesley," she added.&#xD;
I "He, too, has been a very kind friend to me."&#xD;
~     "Nevertheless, I see plainly that you prefer&#xD;
Mr. Warwick."&#xD;
-    "Do you mean that I am more grateful to&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"Well, yes; and that you prefer him. That&#xD;
includes liking as well ns gratitude, doesn't it?&#xD;
you are twice as cordial to him as I ever saw you&#xD;
to Mr. Annesley."&#xD;
"He is different," said Katharine, blushing in&#xD;
a manner which Miss Vernon thought quite unac-&#xD;
countable. "I have known him so much longer&#xD;
and so much better. And-and there is no dan-&#xD;
ger of misconstruction with him. Now, with Mr.&#xD;
Annesley, I felt as if it was necessary to be on&#xD;
my guard all the time."&#xD;
"Against his vanity, do you mean?"&#xD;
"Oh, no; how could you think I meant such&#xD;
a thing? Against gossiping tongues, and ill-&#xD;
natured comments, and all that sort of thing.&#xD;
It must be a very foolish woman who does not&#xD;
learn a little discretion from being tossed about&#xD;
the world as I have been."&#xD;
"I hope you will never be tossed about&#xD;
again," said Miss Vernon. "I wish you would&#xD;
be reasonable, and let it be over at once."&#xD;
The two ladies were sitting in a pretty morn.&#xD;
ing-room, which opened on the lawn, while they&#xD;
talked in this manner. A soft, spring shower&#xD;
was falling outside, but every thing looked very&#xD;
bright and pretty within, when thedoor opened,&#xD;
and Mr. Warwick was shown into the room.&#xD;
They greeted him cordially; and, aftet' the first&#xD;
salutations were over, he turned to Katharine.&#xD;

"I see you are getting quite well," he said.&#xD;
"Are you almost ready for work?"&#xD;
"I am quite ready," she answered, eagerly.&#xD;
"Have you found any thing for me?"&#xD;
"I cannot say positively," he answered, "but&#xD;
I have a strong hope of doing so before very long.&#xD;
Have you any objection to going to It- Coun-&#xD;
ty?"&#xD;
"I have not the least idea where R-&#xD;
County is; but I have no objection to going any-&#xD;
where."&#xD;
"flow very obliging you are!" said Mr. War-&#xD;
wick, smiling. But Miss Vernon gave a cry.&#xD;
"R- County!" she said. "Why, Mr.&#xD;
Warwick, that is so far away, that we need&#xD;
never hope to see her again if she once goes&#xD;
down there. Is it possible you could not find a&#xD;
situation for her nearer Lagrange?"&#xD;
"It does not at all matter t~iat it is so far&#xD;
away," said Katharine, hastily, for she under-&#xD;
stood Mr. Warwick's reasons for choosing It-&#xD;
County better than Miss Vernon did. "I-I am&#xD;
not at all diffident about going among strangers,"&#xD;
she went on.. "Mr. Warwick, do you really think&#xD;
that there is any certain hope of a situation?"&#xD;
"Read that," said Mr. Warwick, taking a let-&#xD;
ter from his pocket, and giving it to her.&#xD;
She opened it eagerly; and, while she read,&#xD;
Miss Vernon was summoned from the room. A&#xD;
little negro boy, whom Mrs. Raynor called her&#xD;
page, came in with a message from "Mass&#xD;
George" of a very imperative nature, necessi-&#xD;
tating her immediate attendance on that gentle-&#xD;
man. She went at once, though it was with\&#xD;
some reluctance. "George is spoiled to death I"&#xD;
she said, to Mr. Warwick. "I have no doubt he&#xD;
will send a message for you when he knows you&#xD;
are here. He seems to 'think that people exist&#xD;
merely for the purpose of ministering to his&#xD;
amusement."&#xD;
"It ig not worth his while to send for me,"&#xD;
said Mr. Warwick "I shall not be here ten min-&#xD;
utes longer. Tell him that, if he has any such&#xD;
intentions, if you please, Miss Vernon."&#xD;
"I will," she said, with some malice, and&#xD;
the door had hardly closed on her when Kath-&#xD;
arine looked up.&#xD;
"I like the tone of this letter," she said.&#xD;
"You bare answered the questions, I pre-&#xD;
same?"&#xD;
~ he replied. "I answered them yes-&#xD;
terda~r. I know Major Wright well," he went&#xD;
on,"and I am sure you will find a situation in&#xD;
his family pleasant. I should not have enter-&#xD;
tained hig proposal otherwise."&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am sure of that," she said, gratefully.&#xD;
"You think of me a great deal-much more&#xD;
than I deserve."&#xD;
"Let me be the judge of that," said he.&#xD;
"When Wright's next letter comes-no doubt&#xD;
empowering me to offer certain terms for yours&#xD;
acceptance-you will be ready to close with&#xD;
them, then?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes; most gladly."&#xD;
"You won't feel inclined .to regret that B-&#xD;
County is so far from Lagrange?"&#xD;
"How could I? The last few months have&#xD;
given me very painful associations with La. -&#xD;
grange." Then, remembering how ungracious&#xD;
this sounded, she hesitated and blushed. " Yeas&#xD;
will come down to R- sometimes, will you&#xD;
not?" she said. "There is no one else I shall&#xD;
care to see."&#xD;
"I don't know," he answered. "It has been&#xD;
two or three years since I was down there last,&#xD;
hunting up evidence in a troublesome case. It&#xD;
may be two or three more before I have such&#xD;
another matter on hand. Do you think you will&#xD;
remain with the Wrights thatlong?"&#xD;
"I cannot tell)" she answered, a little wound.&#xD;
ed by his ton~e. "'A rolling-stone gathers no&#xD;
moss,' you know; so I shall endeavor to be a&#xD;
stationary one. Very likely, therefore, you will&#xD;
find me in the Wright household two or three&#xD;
years hence. If so, I hope you will come to see&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"There is not much doubt of my doing that,"&#xD;
said he. "But I shall hope to see you in a home&#xD;
of 'your own, no longer a waif and stray of For-&#xD;
as you are now."&#xD;
She looked at him reproachfully. It was&#xD;
astonishing how they were playing at cross-&#xD;
purposes, these two. He meant to show her&#xD;
that she had no troublesome pejuistence to fear&#xD;
from him; while ~he felt aggrieved by the man-&#xD;
ner in which he seemed to ignore much that she&#xD;
thought he might have remembered.&#xD;
"You have forgotten," she said, in a low&#xD;
voice. "You must have forgotten a great deal&#xD;
before you could say such things to me. I shall&#xD;
never marry, Mr. Warwick."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick shrugged his shoulders a little&#xD;
over this positive declaration.&#xD;
"Why not?" he asked.&#xD;
"You know why not," she answered. "My&#xD;
burden is heavy enough on myself; I will not&#xD;
take it to any one else."&#xD;
"Not even if he were willing to bear it?"&#xD;
"No, a hundred times, no!"&#xD;
"That is foolish, Miss Treshain. You must&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
GOOD SAMARITANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
233&#xD;
&#xD;
forgive me for saying so, but it is very foolish&#xD;
Your brother has nothing whatever to do wit&#xD;
yourself. A man who loved you-a man whoi&#xD;
you loved-would never hesitate for such a coi&#xD;
sideration as that."&#xD;
"You should not judge all men by you~&#xD;
self," she said, smiling faintly, yet very sweetly&#xD;
"There arc very few who are able to sacrifice&#xD;
themselves as you have proved willing to d.&#xD;
I-I never knew anybody before who was."&#xD;
"Don't think that I mean to reopen a sul~&#xD;
ject which was closed finally," he said, "when&#xD;
beg to correct you in the use of that word. 'Sac&#xD;
rifice' means something which we do unwillingl;&#xD;
for the sake of another. Now, when I asked yoi&#xD;
to marry me-don't start! I have not the leas&#xD;
intention of repeating that act of folly !-I was&#xD;
making no sacrifice at all; I was simply follow&#xD;
ing the instinct of human nature, and endeavor&#xD;
ing to win for myself the happiness I most de&#xD;
sired. Take my word for it, that this will be th(&#xD;
ease with somebody else before long - some&#xD;
body," he added, kindly, "to whom you may b&#xD;
able to give a different .answer."&#xD;
She shook her head, but something-a mosi&#xD;
unaccountable something-rose in her throat, and&#xD;
she could not speak.&#xD;
He saw her agitation, and walked away, te&#xD;
give her time to recover herself.&#xD;
"Poor girl! no doubt she is afraid of an-&#xD;
other sentimental scene with a man old enough&#xD;
to be her father," he thought, with a strange&#xD;
mixture of bitterness, and amusement, and sad-&#xD;
ness, as he stood looking across the lawn, watch-&#xD;
ing the rain as it fell, and the sun as it tried to&#xD;
struggle through the clouds. After a while he&#xD;
turned round and took up the thread of conver-&#xD;
sation again, with a tolerably successful attempt&#xD;
at cheerfulness.&#xD;
"You have no idea how anxious poor Bessie&#xD;
is to see you," he said. "It would really be a&#xD;
deed of charity to give her that pleasure when&#xD;
you chance to be in Tallahoma some day. I am&#xD;
sure you don't bear malice, or I would not ask&#xD;
such a thing."&#xD;
"Bear malice!" repeated Katharine. "What&#xD;
an expression! Why, I am quite as much at-&#xD;
tached to Mrs. Marks and the children as ever;&#xD;
aud I really have not been to Tallahoma because&#xD;
I could not bear to think of not calling to see&#xD;
them. Miss Vernon asked~ me to go with her&#xD;
yesterday, but I declined."&#xD;
"Yoi~ must understand that Bessie has all&#xD;
the time been very anxious for you to return,"&#xD;
he said. "It was Marks who made a fool of him-&#xD;
&#xD;
~. self. I can see very plainly that he is sorry for&#xD;
is it now. 2Perhaps thefact of Mrs. Raynor's august&#xD;
n protection may have something to do with his&#xD;
s- change of sentiment," he ad~ed, with a smile.&#xD;
"It has been for the best," said Katharine,&#xD;
~- a little sadly. "I cannot blame Mr. Marks at&#xD;
~. all; and I am sure it is better that I should&#xD;
e leave Lagrange. I have done little besides mis-&#xD;
. chief since I have been here."&#xD;
"Will you be good enough to tell me what&#xD;
kind of mischief?" asked Mr. Warwick, with&#xD;
I the humorous accent she knew very well.&#xD;
"Don't laugh at me," she said. "I assure&#xD;
y you I am serious. Looking back, I can trace&#xD;
~ every thing to myself. If I had not come here,&#xD;
t there would have been none of this trouble about&#xD;
St. John and Mrs. Gordon, or about Mr. Annes-&#xD;
- Icy, or-or about yourself."&#xD;
-     "And if you had not been born, you would&#xD;
- not be living," said he. "If I laugh at you, it&#xD;
is because you deserve to be laughed at for such&#xD;
- absurdity! A quickness at perceiving the con-&#xD;
nection between cause and effect is a very good&#xD;
thing in its way, Miss Tresham, but it is possible&#xD;
to carry it too -far-it is possible to torment&#xD;
one's self uselessly with past and irretrievable&#xD;
issues. No man is wise enough to foresee the&#xD;
to-morrow, or how the events of to-day may in-&#xD;
fluence it. If we act with an honest intention&#xD;
for the best in the present, it is all that God will&#xD;
require of us. Nobody in the world stands&#xD;
alone; life is a very complex tissue, and every&#xD;
human soul influences others directly or indirect-&#xD;
ly. The conduct of some one else affected the&#xD;
course of your life; your conduct, in turn,&#xD;
affects the lives of others, and so on, ad iaflui.&#xD;
turn. If you want to be logical, you must go far&#xD;
beyond yourself."&#xD;
"You give me comfort as well as teach me&#xD;
logic," she said. "Must you go?"(as he rose).&#xD;
"Well, give my love to Mrs. Marks, and tell her&#xD;
I will certainly conie to see her soon. Are the&#xD;
children all well?"&#xD;
"Quite well, and eager for a s~ght of you. I&#xD;
may hear from Wright next week. If so, I will&#xD;
come and let you know."&#xD;
"Thank you." She held out her hand.&#xD;
"You are very good to me," she added, softly.&#xD;
The tone of her voice, the look in her eyes,&#xD;
haunted him after he left the room, after he rode&#xD;
away, and even after the ordinary distractions of&#xD;
life began to assert themselves once more. It&#xD;
was with difficulty that he finally banished the&#xD;
intrusive recollections.&#xD;
"I have been a fool once," he thought,&#xD;

CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
THu LAST DEFIANCE&#xD;
"Tun slow, sad hours that bring us all things&#xD;
III" went by, slowly and sadly enough; brought&#xD;
little enough besides ill to Mrs. Gordon, as the&#xD;
days lengthened, the heavens smiled, and earth&#xD;
budded, and Nature, weakening from her brief&#xD;
winter sleep, prepared for her long summer carni-&#xD;
val. Springcame, with its soft airs, its sportive&#xD;
breezes, its glittering sunshine, and bright flow-&#xD;
era; but no change of season or of weather&#xD;
lightened her gloom; no lapse of time softened&#xD;
her sorrow, or taught her resignation. Round&#xD;
the old house that had been silent so long, and&#xD;
at last had come to shrine this one lonely life,&#xD;
all was rejoicing beauty; but within its doors&#xD;
there was a hush that seemed to speak of deso-&#xD;
lation-.--a subtle and penetrating sadness that&#xD;
human grief sometimes seems to impress even&#xD;
upon inanimate surroundings. People-the few&#xD;
people who ever came-felt it as soon as they&#xD;
entered thedoor, and left it behind them, like a&#xD;
weight, when they emerged again into the fresh&#xD;
air and bright sunshine. Day after day of stag-&#xD;
mint, weary calm, rolled by; and the pale wom-&#xD;
an, lying on her sofa, grew daily more pale and&#xD;
more hollow-eyed. Who can wonder? Troubles&#xD;
suspense, and bereavement, are grim phantoms&#xD;
which prove hard enough to fight when the daily&#xD;
cares of life-cares merciful at such a time-are&#xD;
pressing on the heart, and giving at least the&#xD;
relief of partial distraction to the mind. But&#xD;
trouble, when there is nothing to do but brood&#xD;
over it; suspense, when it is only possible to sit&#xD;
and wait for the dreaded day, or the dreaded ob-&#xD;
ject; bereavement, when not one human source&#xD;
of consolation has been lOft; oh, where is the&#xD;
tongue or the pen that can speak of these? As&#xD;
people who sit by warm hearth, and for whom&#xD;
luxurious tables are spread, shrug their shoul-&#xD;
ders, and say, "Poor thing I" when their sym-&#xD;
pathy and their attention are claimed by some&#xD;
taunt, thinly-clad form out beyond in the night&#xD;
and storm, so we utter a few set words of pity&#xD;
and eondol~nce when a face, white with the awful&#xD;
ibotprhits of despair, looks in on our life. But&#xD;
have we-we, warmly clothed, and fed, and lodged,&#xD;
and hedged about with love-even the least con.&#xD;
&#xD;
caption of how bitterly the cold cuts, how heavily&#xD;
the rain falls, how dark and full of terror is the&#xD;
night to that poor, houseless wanderer? If we&#xD;
had, ah, vain words! even if we had, what could&#xD;
we do? The needs of the body can be supplied,&#xD;
the wants of the body can be filled, but who has&#xD;
yet been able to comfort the soul sick with lone-&#xD;
ly grief, or feed- the heart starving for absent&#xD;
love?&#xD;
So the days went by-one after another, with&#xD;
dreary sameness-and so the woman, whose life&#xD;
of fevered emotion had sunk at last into apathetic&#xD;
lethargy, watched them, from sunrise to sunset1&#xD;
all alone. Sometimes she shivered, as a keen&#xD;
realization of her position oarn~ over her; as, lit&#xD;
a mirror, she saw herself sitting in the desolate&#xD;
solitude of her father's house, waiting for the&#xD;
man whom she had once loved, and now hated;&#xD;
the man who had wrecked her life, and made her&#xD;
what she was; the man whom she dreaded, ab-&#xD;
horred, yet longed to see again..-longed to sour&#xD;
out upon him the bitter tide of reproach, de-&#xD;
fiance, scorn, and hate. Sometimes she would&#xD;
shrink and shiver at a footstep, thinking, dread-&#xD;
ing that it might be his; then, again, she would&#xD;
pace the floor, and clasp her hands together,&#xD;
longing that he would come, that the worst&#xD;
might be over, that the utmost which could be&#xD;
said might have been said But the weeks wore&#xD;
on, and he did not appear. John Warwick came&#xD;
often-as often as possible, and as he had news&#xD;
from Felix-and did his honest best to cheer&#xD;
and lighten the gloom which he found; but even&#xD;
he, when he went away, felt depressed; even he&#xD;
felt how hopeless were any efforts to bring sun.&#xD;
shine where sunshine was net.&#xD;
"If you only had a companion!" he said; to&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon, one day. "Such a life as this is&#xD;
enough to kill you! your own thoughts are the&#xD;
worst possible company; anybody or any thing&#xD;
would be better."&#xD;
"And where would you find me a com-&#xD;
panion?" she asked, languidly. "Not that I&#xD;
would desire such a thing, but, If I did, where&#xD;
would you find one? A companion! think of all&#xD;
that a companion means. Not somebody to sit&#xD;
there and distract me with set looks, and com-&#xD;
posed manners, and talk about the weather and&#xD;
Lagrange gossip; but somebody who would have&#xD;
quickness enough to read my moods, and change&#xD;
with them; who would cheer at one time, and&#xD;
soothe at another; who would not be too gay,&#xD;
nor yet too dull; toward whom I need feel no&#xD;
reserve, yet who would not pry into my heart -&#xD;
somebody who-. Ah, what Is the good of talk:&#xD;
&#xD;
ing? All this means a friend, and where have I&#xD;
a friend?"&#xD;
"I know where I could find such a person for&#xD;
you," he said. "If-if you would only consent&#xD;
to it."&#xD;
She looked at him a little suspiciously.&#xD;
"Whom do you mean?" she asked.&#xD;
"I mean Miss Tresham," he-answered. "If&#xD;
you would only believe-"&#xD;
She interrupted him, passionately. "I will&#xD;
believe nothing that would bring her into this&#xD;
house! I don't trust her, Mr. Warwick; say&#xD;
what you will, ~ don't trust her! St. John's sis-&#xD;
ter cannot be other than false, and you will live&#xD;
to find it out!"&#xD;
"I am rather of the opinion," said he, "that&#xD;
you and some other people will live to find out&#xD;
that it is neither just nor reasonable to condemn&#xD;
one person for the faults and crimes of another,&#xD;
no matter how nearly related that other may&#xD;
be."&#xD;
"And you trust her? Trust anybody with&#xD;
that blood?"&#xD;
"Stop a moment, Mrs. Gordon; consider how&#xD;
little you know of the blood, or are able to judge&#xD;
of it from one representative. It is impossible&#xD;
for you to tell how many brave and noble an-&#xD;
cestors this very St. John may have had, ances-&#xD;
tors whose blood has made his sister what she&#xD;
is.&#xD;
"She is his ~&#xD;
"That settles the matter, I see," said he,&#xD;
slightly shrugging his shoulders. "Well, per-&#xD;
haps you may be glad to hear that this dangerous&#xD;
person will soon be removed from the neighbor-&#xD;
hood of Morton House. I received a letter to-&#xD;
day from an old friend of mine in one of the&#xD;
lower counties, offering Miss Tresham the posi.&#xD;
tion of governess in his family. She has re- f&#xD;
quested me to accept it for her, and to say that I&#xD;
she will leave Lagrange in a few days. I am go- r&#xD;
ing home to write that letter now." s&#xD;
"Does your friend live near Felix?"      £&#xD;
"N~o; very far from Felix. Surely, after all c&#xD;
that I have told you, you do not cling to that o&#xD;
ideayet?"                                   c&#xD;
"It has been an instinct with me from the&#xD;
first. One cannot disregard instincts."&#xD;
"Yes, one can, especially when they are con. 11&#xD;
trary to reason and common-sense. You see I g&#xD;
talk plainly to you. On my honor, I think you iv&#xD;
need it. Have you seen Annesley since he re. n&#xD;
turned V'&#xD;
"He was here yesterday. lie tells me that -&#xD;
this girl has finally rejected him."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And will not even that fact alter your judg-&#xD;
ment of her a little?"&#xD;
She made an impatient gesture. "Why&#xD;
should it? No doubt she Would have married&#xD;
him if she had dared to do so; that is, if she&#xD;
had not known that his family would never recog-&#xD;
nize her."&#xD;
"Morton is tolerably independent of his fam-&#xD;
ily," said Mr. Warwick, dryly. "If Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am had married him, no doubt they would have&#xD;
found it tiresome to stay away from Anneadale&#xD;
because his wife was mistress there; and that is&#xD;
all that their not recognizing her would have come&#xD;
to, you know. Well, the afternoon is wearing&#xD;
on, and I must leave you, Don't you ever go&#xD;
out to get a little fresh air?"&#xD;
"Scarcely ever," she answered, languidly, giv~&#xD;
ing him her hand as he rose to take leave.&#xD;
After he ivent out, he carried a dreary pic-&#xD;
ture back to town with him-the room, which&#xD;
looked dark and confined, as any room will look&#xD;
on a day when Nature is taking one of her royal&#xD;
holidays; the sofa, with its cushions, and the&#xD;
pale, thin face pillowed thereon; the relaxed&#xD;
form; the sad eyes; the books, tossed aside in&#xD;
utter weariness! He seemed to see it all as he&#xD;
rode along, with the lovely day around him; and&#xD;
he could not help saying over and over again,&#xD;
"Poor woman!"&#xD;
The poor woman, who well deserved his com-&#xD;
passion, lay, meanwhile, where he haI left her,&#xD;
watching dreamily the shadows lengthening on&#xD;
the stretch of emerald sward beyond her window~&#xD;
the fruit-trees looking like pink-and-white elou4s&#xD;
a an orchard faraway, and the golden afternoon,&#xD;
aith allits spring-time wealth of sight and sound1&#xD;
Irawiag toward sunset. Sunset, however, had not&#xD;
~et come when she fell into a light sleep, her&#xD;
hec still turned to the window, and the soft&#xD;
~recze playing gently over it. Something of&#xD;
eace, something even of beauty, came to her as&#xD;
he slept, as we see it often come to world-worn&#xD;
aces when the stillness of this mimic death steals&#xD;
ver them, winning back a little of the lost grace&#xD;
f youth to the heavy, deep-set lines of age or&#xD;
are.&#xD;
She had not slept more than half an hour&#xD;
rhen the stillness around her was broken, slight-&#xD;
broken by a step on the sward that sloped so&#xD;
ently from the window before which her sofa&#xD;
'as placed. The sound was so slight that it did&#xD;
ot rouse her, and she still remained unconscious&#xD;
-still slept with a faint, sweet smile on her lip&#xD;
-when a shadow fell across the floor, a figure&#xD;
mw near the window, and a man, pushing back&#xD;
&#xD;

236                             'MORTON&#xD;
the gently-swaying curtains, stepped into the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
Not Mr. Warwick, not Annesley, not even St.&#xD;
John, but a stranger, who steps into this history,&#xD;
as he stepped into that room, for the first time-&#xD;
a tall, handsome man, with an air at once un-&#xD;
mistakable and indescribable, which only much&#xD;
intercourse with the world confers, with a bear-&#xD;
ing of marked distinction, and with a look of&#xD;
youth-despite certain significant lines that told&#xD;
of the wear and tear of reckless years and more&#xD;
reckless passions-in singular contrast to That&#xD;
pale, faded woman on the sofa. Evidently, he&#xD;
had walked round' the hou~e, and entered the&#xD;
~rst window which he found open. Evidently,&#xD;
also, he had not caught a glimpse of the sleep-&#xD;
ing figure before he made his unceremonious&#xD;
appearance. He at~rted when he saw it, drew&#xD;
back a step, then smiled a little, and came for~&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
At the same moment, Mrs. Gordon woke-&#xD;
woke suddenly, with a wild start. In recalling&#xD;
the scene afterward, she remembered that, in the&#xD;
midst of a happy dream nbout Felix, her heart&#xD;
seemed, without any warning, to give a great&#xD;
bound, and with a terror which she did not&#xD;
understand she sprung to a sitting posture, and,&#xD;
half sleeping, half waking-was it dream or real-&#xD;
ity ?-saw before her the face that had haunted&#xD;
hei~'last waking thoughts.&#xD;
She gave a low, inarticulate cry, then clasped&#xD;
koth bands to her heart, and kept theni there,&#xD;
striving vainly to still the passionate throbs that&#xD;
~nade speech impossible. She had expected him,&#xD;
looked for him; sometimes, in a strange, wild&#xD;
way, longed for him; yet, now that he was be-&#xD;
fore her, the realization of it turned her faint.&#xD;
She could say nothing; her 1ips seemed parched;&#xD;
her tongue refused to speak it almost seemed&#xD;
as if she was still asleep; and yet she knew that&#xD;
she was awake, and that her husband was before&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"I have come, Pauline," he said, coolly. "I&#xD;
suppose, of course, you expected me. You have&#xD;
acted like-well, like a foolish woman; but I&#xD;
presume you knew that I would come."&#xD;
All the past rushed back over her in the first&#xD;
tone of that cold, careless voice-all the memo-&#xD;
ries, how bitter, how stinging, none but she&#xD;
could tell! Rage, scorn, defiance, hate-where&#xD;
were they all? Only an overwhelming horror&#xD;
came to her, as in these words he asserted his&#xD;
'claim over her-this man who was her husband,&#xD;
and the murderer of her brother, yet who stood&#xD;
'there under her f?~ther's roof!&#xD;
&#xD;
* HOUSE.&#xD;
"How did you come here?" ~she demanded,&#xD;
fh'4h a house&#xD;
haughtily. "This is my aterouse,&#xD;
only fit for honorable men. My servants long&#xD;
age received orders not to admit you."&#xD;
"I gave you credit for that measure of pre-&#xD;
caution~' he answered, in the same coldly-care.&#xD;
less manner, a manner on which it 'was evident&#xD;
that St. John had modelled his own~ and which,&#xD;
therefore, possessed all the advantage that an&#xD;
original possesses over a copy. "I did not&#xD;
trouble your servants to admit me," he went on.&#xD;
"The front of the house was entirely deserted.&#xD;
[ walked around until l came to this window.&#xD;
Seeing it open, I entered."&#xD;
"It is still open," she said. "If you do not&#xD;
leave the room instantly, I shall do so myself. I&#xD;
am determined never to see or speak to you again.&#xD;
if there is any thing that you wish to say to me,&#xD;
any arrangement that you wish to make with me,&#xD;
I refer you to my lawyer."&#xD;
He only answered by walking across the&#xD;
room, and closing the door. Then, coming&#xD;
back, he placed a chair so as to intercept any&#xD;
possible retreat on her part, and quietly sat&#xD;
down.&#xD;
"All this is folly," he said, with unmoved&#xD;
composure. "I thought you knew me well&#xD;
enough to be aware how worse than useless&#xD;
such a tone as this is. You seem to forget-or&#xD;
I suppose you really do not know-that I am&#xD;
the injured person in this freak of yours. Your&#xD;
conduct, from first t~ last~ has not a single ex-&#xD;
cuse, not a rSngle palliation. I directed you. to&#xD;
go to Scotland, and you deliberately came to&#xD;
America, thereby robbing me of Felix, and en-&#xD;
deavoring to conceal yourself from me. It was&#xD;
a woman's idea," he said, with contemptuous&#xD;
amusement, "and ha~ had the success that&#xD;
might naturally have been expected."&#xD;
"You mean that you have found me?"&#xD;
"Yes, l mean that l have found you, and that&#xD;
I am lenient enough to give you your choice&#xD;
whether you will return to Scotland with me, or&#xD;
whether I shall leave you in the seclusion you&#xD;
have chosen, and simply take Felix."&#xD;
The tone of subdued but unmistakahle malice&#xD;
with which he spoke the last words roused Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon like the blast of a trumpet. Suddenly,&#xD;
the remembrance came to her that she was not,&#xD;
as heretofore, helplessly in Us power. It was&#xD;
evident that he thought to bend her to his will&#xD;
through her fears for Felix; yet Felix was safe,&#xD;
was far away, was where this man could not pos-&#xD;
sibly seek or find him. The sweetness' of that&#xD;
one moment repaid her for all the months of&#xD;

"No doubt you were confident of being safe&#xD;
when you came here," he said, with the mocking&#xD;
smile which she knew so well. "Can't the fail-&#xD;
ure of one attempt teach you wisdom with re-&#xD;
gard to another? But that is a foolish question,&#xD;
women never learn wisdom, especially women&#xD;
like you. I see one thing, however, that you&#xD;
have not arranged and carried out this precious&#xD;
scheme alone. You have had assistance. .Ah 1"&#xD;
-as she changed color a little-" I knew it!&#xD;
Well, that makes matters a trifle easier than&#xD;
they would have been otherwise. I can find&#xD;
your instrument, and, having found him, you&#xD;
know me well enough to be aware-"&#xD;
"I know him well enough to be aware that&#xD;
your threats are useless," she interrupted, "You&#xD;
will gain nothing from him. He is not a man&#xD;
whom you can either bribe or intimidate. I&#xD;
sent you a warning once," she went on, excited-&#xD;
ly. "I don't know whether you ever received&#xD;
it; but if so, you would do well to heed it-you&#xD;
would do well to remember that him here in&#xD;
the midst of my friends, and that to attempt to&#xD;
hartil me further is only a certain means of&#xD;
harmhug yourself~ I am no longer in a foreign&#xD;
country, and helplessly at your mercy. I am at&#xD;
home, and you-if you only knew it-are at my&#xD;
mercy!"&#xD;
"I suppose you mean that some of your&#xD;
highly-civilized kinsmen and friends would be&#xD;
ready to shoot or stab me at your bidding," he&#xD;
saidsarelessly. "For that I have only one an-&#xD;
swer-by all means let them try. flow much you&#xD;
must have forgotten, before you thought it worth&#xD;
your while to take a tone like this."&#xD;
"I have said all that I shall think of say-&#xD;
ing," she answered, coldly. "It is for you to&#xD;
heed or not,~as you think fit. Once more, will&#xD;
you go? I h'!ive defied-I do defy you-to do&#xD;
your worst. There is nothing to add to that."&#xD;
"Yes, there is something," he said. "Not&#xD;
on your side, perhaps, but on mine. I will inflict&#xD;
my presence upon you long enough tQ add it."&#xD;
He had loosed his grasp of her arm by this&#xD;
time, and he now sat down again in the chair&#xD;
'from which he had risen. His change of man-&#xD;
ner warned her that something worse than what&#xD;
had gon~ before, was yet to come. She tried to&#xD;
conjecture what it could be; but a dizziness&#xD;
seized her, and she could think of nothing.&#xD;
Felix! Felix! That was the only thought which&#xD;
rang through her brain. He could not touch&#xD;
him. ~he was sure of that. What did any thing&#xD;
elae matter? With a great parting flash of glory,&#xD;
the sun went down; the whole sky was glowing&#xD;
&#xD;
with the lovely reflection of the incarnadine west,&#xD;
melting into softest rose-colors, and violets, and&#xD;
blues, when he began to speak.&#xD;
"I gave you your choice when I first caine&#xD;
in, to return to Scotland with me, or to resign&#xD;
the child to whom the law gives you no claim.&#xD;
Considering the defiance of my authQrity, which&#xD;
has been your only reply, I might reasonably re-&#xD;
tract that offer. But, as it is, I give it to you&#xD;
once more, and for the last time. Stop I "-lift-&#xD;
ing his hand when he saw that she was about&#xD;
to speak-" you must understand fully, as you&#xD;
do not understand now, the alternative that is&#xD;
placed before you. In the first place, I am sure&#xD;
that it is in my power to find Felix-if you con.&#xD;
sidered a moment, you would be sure of this&#xD;
too. But to do so will cost both time and trou-&#xD;
ble, neither of which I desire to expend. I shell&#xD;
expend them, if necessary," he said, with ener-&#xD;
gy; "but I am willing to make a cq~promise&#xD;
to effect his recovery without them. I shall not&#xD;
speak to you of your duty, nor of the false.and&#xD;
groundless charges that you make against me&#xD;
in the matter of your brother's unfortunate&#xD;
death-"&#xD;
"If you arc wise, you will leave 'that name&#xD;
unspokenn," she said, in a tone that came with&#xD;
something like a hiss through her teeth-teeth&#xD;
set to keep back the fierce tide of emotion that&#xD;
struggled for expression. "If you utter it again&#xD;
-here, under this roof-I think I could almost&#xD;
find strength to murder you, as you murdered&#xD;
him! Bay what you have to say while I am able&#xD;
to control myself sufficiently to listen to you. It&#xD;
is the last time that I shall ever see you, or hear&#xD;
your voice."&#xD;
"You forget that you are my wife, and entire-&#xD;
ly in my power."&#xD;
"I am your wife-God help me 1-but I am&#xD;
not in your power, nor ever will be again."&#xD;
"We shall see about that," he said, smiling&#xD;
again. "I was on the point of saying, when you&#xD;
interrupted me, that I shall not speak to you of&#xD;
your duty, but of your interest. If you consent&#xD;
to produce Felix, I will allow you to accompany&#xD;
him hack to Seotland. If you refuse, I wiWfind&#xD;
him myself, and in that ease I shall take him&#xD;
alone. Do you understand?"&#xD;
"I understand."&#xD;
"And refuse?"&#xD;
"And refuse."&#xD;
"Very well. That point is settled-irreve-&#xD;
cably. We will not return to it again. Now!&#xD;

THE LAST DEFIANCE.                      239&#xD;

your own act, the inheritance which would natur-&#xD;
ally be his. I swear to you solemnly-and you&#xD;
know whether or not I am likely to keep my&#xD;
oath-that unless he is resigned to my guardian-&#xD;
ship, he' shall never inherit a fragment or a pit-&#xD;
tance of the Gordon estate."&#xD;
"You are counting too much on my igno-&#xD;
rance, when you make such threats," she said,&#xD;
haughtily. "I chance to know that you are un-&#xD;
able to fulfil them-I chance to know that your&#xD;
uncle'S estate is entailed upon your son, and that&#xD;
you are powerless to alienate it from him."&#xD;
"You are right," he said, with a flash of tri-&#xD;
umph in his eye. "It is entailed upon my son,&#xD;
but upon my ddest son."&#xD;
- "XVcll?"&#xD;
Something like a dim foreboding of the truth&#xD;
began to dawn upon her. The excitement died&#xD;
out of her face, she turned white to her very&#xD;
lips, and leaned back against the cushions of the&#xD;
sofa.&#xD;
"Well," he'replicd, coolly, "Yelix is not my&#xD;
eldest son. For reasons that will be apparent to&#xD;
you hereafter, I have preferred and do prefer him&#xD;
as an heir. But he is not the legal inheritor of&#xD;
the estate. It depends upon you whether or not&#xD;
he will ever own an acre or touch a penny of&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Upon mel" A gathering mist seemed clos-&#xD;
ing round her; but she fought it bravely-she&#xD;
struggled desperately against the rising faint-&#xD;
ness that threatened to sweep away all powers&#xD;
of combat. One thought only save her strength&#xD;
-Felix's rights! They were assailed-falsely,&#xD;
unscrupulously, assailed, she was sure-and she&#xD;
was their only defender.&#xD;
"I do not believe you!" she cried out, pas-&#xD;
sionately. "Why should I? You have never&#xD;
failed to deceive me when you could do so with&#xD;
any advantage to yourself. Why should I be-&#xD;
lieve anything so stamped with falsehood as&#xD;
this?"&#xD;
"Believe it or not, as you please," he an-&#xD;
swered. "It is a matter, fortunately, which ad-&#xD;
mits of proof."&#xD;
"You can prove that Felix is not your eldest&#xD;
son?"&#xD;
"I can prove a former marriage when I was&#xD;
quite a boy, and the existence of a legal heir to&#xD;
the Gordon estate in the person of my son by&#xD;
that marriage."&#xD;
"He is living?"&#xD;
"Yes, he is living. 1 can put my hand en&#xD;
him whenever I choose. You need not look so&#xD;
incredulous," he said, as he saw her eyes grow&#xD;
&#xD;
larger and larger, her face whiter and whiter.&#xD;
"As I have said, it is a case in which assertion&#xD;
can have no weight; it is capable of proof that&#xD;
can, if necessary, be taken into a court of law.&#xD;
Perhaps you ~nay be convhlced if I give you a&#xD;
short statement of the matter?"&#xD;
She made a gesture, signifying assent; and&#xD;
yet it was hardly necessary. Something in his&#xD;
manner-something in his tone-above all,&#xD;
something in his face (and she knew that face&#xD;
well)-told her that he was speaking truth, and&#xD;
not merely a cunning falsehood devised to an-&#xD;
noy and intimidate her. Every thing had seemed&#xD;
so plain to her a minute before, and now all was&#xD;
confusion. Felix! Felix's rights! What were&#xD;
they? where were they9 what ought she to do?&#xD;
This was the accompaniment to her husband's&#xD;
words when he began to speak.&#xD;
"I need not trouble you with particulars," he&#xD;
said. "It is enough to give you a bare outline of&#xD;
facts. When! was a very young man-in fact,&#xD;
little moro~than a boy-my reg~nwnt was sta-&#xD;
tioned in the West Indies. I had not beeu there&#xD;
very long when 1 accompanied ouc of my fri~uds&#xD;
on a visit to Martinique. This maa-I have fot-&#xD;
gotten his name, and it does not matter-had a&#xD;
letter of introduction to an Irishman named&#xD;
O'Grady living on the island. He took me with&#xD;
him; and, since our welcome was very warm,!&#xD;
soon became intimate in the family. The man&#xD;
himself-O'Grady~ I mean-was a widower, and&#xD;
his family consisted of two daughters. One of&#xD;
them was a widow1 a Mrs. -. Confound my&#xD;
memory! I have forgotten thatname, too. The&#xD;
other was a young girl, pretty enough, I dare&#xD;
say; but I have little recollection c~f her now,&#xD;
excepting that she turned my head completQly at&#xD;
the time. A. love-affair followed, o~ course, not-&#xD;
withstanding that! was in a mu~h better posi-&#xD;
tion to cut my throat than to think of marrying.&#xD;
My father had paid my debts twice, and I was in&#xD;
deep disgrace with him. The beggarly allowance&#xD;
which he still continued, and my pay together,&#xD;
barely sufficed, or rather did not suffice, for my&#xD;
own wants, since I was a third time deeply in&#xD;
debt. To marry under these circumstances was&#xD;
simple insanity. This I knew perfectly well.&#xD;
Still, I was young, and ready for any act of folly.&#xD;
The consequence was that I compromised with an&#xD;
elopement and private marriage. The girl was&#xD;
easily worked upon; and, for the rest, matters&#xD;
were quite easy. There is hardly the lea~1~ com-&#xD;
munication between the different islands of the&#xD;
West Indies, and there was nobody to followor&#xD;
inalte disagreeable iurjuirics. Her Lathe; who&#xD;

departure, and there were 110 troublesome brol&#xD;
ers or cousins in the matter. I took her to f&#xD;
island where I was stationed; but nobody in ti&#xD;
regiment had any suspicion of the marriage.&#xD;
was particularly cautious on this point, becau&#xD;
any rumor reaching my father's ears would ha'&#xD;
ruined me. Well, before long, I appreciated a&#xD;
folly as it deserved, and grew heartily tired&#xD;
the whole afl'air I fancy it did not answer w&#xD;
on either side. Kate-that was the name of U&#xD;
girl-was sufficiently full of complaints, if con&#xD;
plaints are any signs of unhappiness. At las&#xD;
to my great relief, the regiment was ordered&#xD;
home. I left her as well provided for as peas&#xD;
ble, but hardly had I sailed from the island whe&#xD;
(as I afterward learned) she wrote for her sist&#xD;
-a thing I had expressly forbidden. I~er excus&#xD;
was that she felt sure of dying at the approach&#xD;
ing birth of a second child. If that was tb&#xD;
~ase, her foreboding was verified, for, as&#xD;
chanced, she did die. The sister wrote to m&#xD;
then with regard to the children-one, the be;&#xD;

such dead-weights as these would have beci&#xD;

by my directions, offering a yearly sum for thel&#xD;
support, provided I was never troubled with nn~&#xD;
thing concerning them, and provided also tha&#xD;
they did not bear my name. Since the entir&#xD;
proof of the marriage rested with me~ to pro&#xD;
duce or to suppress as I thought fit, she bad ~c&#xD;
alternative but to consent. She gave, them hc&#xD;
own name, and kept them with her until the bo~&#xD;
grew toward manhood and became unmanage.&#xD;
able. Then she addressed the agent through&#xD;
whom the yearly stipend was paid, and request.&#xD;
ed that some arrangement might be made, remov.&#xD;
ing him from her control, also requesting that,&#xD;
if necessary for this, the whole of the allowance&#xD;
might he taken, as she was able to support the&#xD;
sister herself This was accordinglyy done; and&#xD;
the boy was played at school in England. lIe-&#xD;
fore long he was expelled for some disgraceful&#xD;
scrape. Then I took him, to see of what mate-&#xD;
rial h~ really was, and soon found "&#xD;
He stopped, for Mrs. Gordon had ripen again&#xD;
to a sitting posture, and faced him in the gather.&#xD;
ing, twilight with a look of horror that words can&#xD;
naly fail to describe. It awed even him, seen&#xD;
through the falling gloom; yet he recovered him-&#xD;
self with a slight movement, as if to shake oil&#xD;
some unconmious influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
er "Well," he said, lightly, "what is the mat.&#xD;
h- ter?"&#xD;
he "What is his name?" she asked, in a tone&#xD;
lie that fell sharply on the still air. Then, in a&#xD;
I lower voice, "My God! It cannot be! It is too&#xD;
so horrible even for you! What is his name?" she&#xD;
ye cried, again, more sharply than before.&#xD;
y     " You might know his name by this time,~~&#xD;
)f he answered, in a tone of mingled disgust and&#xD;
11 triumph that did not escape her highly-strung&#xD;
ic ear. "The msn to whom you will give the Gor-&#xD;
a- doja estate, if you still refuse to surrender ,Felix,&#xD;
t, is the man you have so long scorned and hated,&#xD;
d the man whom you have held as less than the&#xD;
i- dust beneath your feet-is, in short, St. John!"&#xD;
a For a full minute after that name was spoken,&#xD;
w not a word further broke th~ silence of the room.&#xD;
c Face to face they sat in the dusky gloaming,&#xD;
i. the tempter and the tempted, and the only audi-&#xD;
e ble sound was that, of Mrs. Gordon's breathing,&#xD;
t which came in short, painful gasps, as she sat&#xD;
e with her hand once more pressed to her side,&#xD;
y trying to still the wild throbs of her heart, try.&#xD;

you what is my choice in the matter. It will be&#xD;
no pleasant task to acknowledge a son in one&#xD;
- of the most profligate adventurers and swindlers&#xD;
in Europe."&#xD;
"And who made him either an adventurer or&#xD;
a swindler?" she cried, with a sudden vehe-&#xD;
* mence that startled her listener. "Who made&#xD;
him a tool for all the base uses that your own&#xD;
* hand disdained? Who taught him to scorn every&#xD;
* law of God and man? If ho is your son-if you&#xD;
have spoken truly-you have prepared for your-&#xD;

You wpuld make him what you have made this&#xD;
poor instrument of your vices I Do you hear&#xD;
me-do you believe me-when I tell you that I&#xD;
would rather see him dead before me?"&#xD;
"Do you think that Feli*x will appreciate&#xD;
these heroics?" he asked, with a bitter sneer.&#xD;
"Do you think that, if he lives, he will thank&#xD;
you for having stood between him and his in-&#xD;
heritance-for having made him virtually a beg-&#xD;
gar ~&#xD;
"If he has a drop of Morton blood in his&#xD;
veins, he will thank me for having spared him&#xD;

&#xD;
the example of such a father, and the shame of&#xD;
having purchased worldly prosperity-the enjoy-&#xD;
ment of property that rightly belongs to another&#xD;
-at the price of moral degradation."&#xD;
"Then your decision is finally made?"&#xD;
"Yes, it is made. Nothing that you can say,&#xD;
nothing that you can do, will change it!"&#xD;
He rose to his feat and half turned away, then&#xD;
stopped a moment, and came back to her.&#xD;
"I suppose you know that you have no right&#xD;
whatever to this property which you are enjoy-&#xD;
ing," he said, "that the law gives all control of&#xD;
it to your husband, if I choose, I can sell this&#xD;
house, and every acre of land you call your own,&#xD;
to-morrow."&#xD;
"I am not sure that the law gives you such&#xD;
power," she answered. "But, granting that it&#xD;
does, I have only one reply to make-try, if you&#xD;
dare, to enforce it."&#xD;
"Do you think that the law will stand your&#xD;
friend, because you chance to be a Morton, and&#xD;
to be at home ?&#xD;
"I think-I know that the law is sometimes&#xD;
powerless to act in the face of public opinion.&#xD;
And, if it comes to an issue of high-handed&#xD;
ia.trags like thi4 &amp;amp; ~kc~ect wilt never Inek&#xD;
friends or defenders in Lagrange."&#xD;
"You may find yourself mistaken."&#xD;
"We shall see. But, if you had the right,&#xD;
and if you were able to enforce it, there would&#xD;
be no difference. If I were obliged to live on&#xD;
charity, or to beg my bread by the way-side, I&#xD;
should still defy you. Let that be the last word&#xD;
between us-the last I shall ever speak to you-&#xD;
I defy you!"&#xD;
"Very well," he said, grinding his teeth to-&#xD;
gether in irrepressible rage.&#xD;
Itecalling the scene afterward, Mrs. Gordon&#xD;
wondered at her own fearlessness. She was en-&#xD;
tirely alone, she was utterly helpless, and she&#xD;
had good reason to know of old how brutal and&#xD;
how reckless he could be. Yet she rose to her&#xD;
feet in the excitement of passion, and uttered&#xD;
those last quivering word3, like a haughty chal-&#xD;
lenge.&#xD;
He made a step forward, almost as it' he&#xD;
would have struck her; but she did not quail.&#xD;
She stood before him, like a pale wraith of a&#xD;
woman, in the ghostly twilight, daring him to do&#xD;
his worst. After a short interval of silence, that&#xD;
worst came in the form of words.&#xD;
"You have taken your choice," he said,&#xD;
"and, indeed, you shall abide by it. I swear to&#xD;
you that I will find Felix, and that I will make&#xD;
you repent this defiance in sackcloth and ashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
When I find him, and when your hour of repent-&#xD;
ance comes, then I will see you again, and pot&#xD;
before!"&#xD;
His tone, often as she had heard it in mo-&#xD;
ments like these~ involuntary made her shud-&#xD;
der; it was so full of concentrated bitterness,&#xD;
hatred, aiid revenge~ that the wonder was, not&#xD;
that he had for a moment threatened her with&#xD;
personal violence, but that, he was able to re-&#xD;
strain himself from executing that threat. If&#xD;
she had felt inclined to reply, he gave her no&#xD;
time to do so, but left the room immediately&#xD;
through the window by which he had entered.&#xD;
As his shadow passed away, the woman-his&#xD;
wife-sat down, sick and shuddering. It was&#xD;
over. Was it over, or had~ she only waked from&#xD;
a hideous dream? Had he really been there,&#xD;
and had the last bitter defiance been exchanged&#xD;
between them? Had she really told him that&#xD;
Felix was safe from him, and, that, for herself,&#xD;
she was ready to face the worst that malice, aided&#xD;
by the strong arm of legal power, could devise&#xD;
against her? Her head seemed giddy; she could&#xD;
not tell. A darkness, that was not the darkness&#xD;
of approaching night, closed round her. She&#xD;
&amp;amp; ~&amp;amp;(&amp;amp;     tO ery' aloud; hut it ~u4e4 in&#xD;
a low, gurgling moan. Then she sank down on&#xD;
the pillows.&#xD;
Gordon, meanwhile, was walking quickly and&#xD;
fiercely-as men always walk under the influence&#xD;
of strong passion-round the house. It was not&#xD;
by any means so late as it appeared in the room&#xD;
he had quitted; but, still, dusk bad fallen, and&#xD;
objects near at hand were becoming indistinct,&#xD;
while those farther off were entirely wrapped in&#xD;
obscurity'. This fact, together with great pre-&#xD;
occupation of mind4 prevented his observing a&#xD;
man who was nearing the terrace, as he e~nerged&#xD;
from the shadow of the house, and descended the&#xD;
stone steps that led down to the avenue.&#xD;
He had scarcely taken half a dozen steps on&#xD;
'the latter, when his path was barred; a voice,&#xD;
quiet but somewhat menacing, said, "A word&#xD;
with you, if you please," and, looking up, he&#xD;
found himself face to face with St. John!&#xD;

ON THE THRESHOLD OF MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
243&#xD;
&#xD;
some little imp had startled the horse for amuse-&#xD;
mnent, and was now hiding from the probable&#xD;
consequences, he gave Ilderim's bridle a per-&#xD;
emptory jerk, and, in a good deal of a fume,&#xD;
rode up to the stile. "Come out, you miserable&#xD;
little' rascal," he said, "and let me tell you that&#xD;
if you ever try such a trick as that again-"&#xD;
He stopped short, full of amazement. In-&#xD;
stead of a child, a man rose up from behind the&#xD;
hedge, at his bidding, and, with the full glow of&#xD;
sunset fallii~g on him, he recognized St. John.&#xD;
They faced each other silently for an instant-&#xD;
Annesley overcome by astonishment, St. John&#xD;
full of mortified rage, and neither knowing what&#xD;
to do or to say, until the adventurer, who, hav-&#xD;
ing been most prepared for the encounter, broke&#xD;
the awkward silence first.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon~ he said, with a sort of&#xD;
insolent defiance. "Did you speak to me?"&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," answered Annesley,&#xD;
recovering a' little. "No, I did not speak to&#xD;
you. That is, when I spoke, I thought some&#xD;
mischie~'ous boy had frightened my horse, and&#xD;
was hiding behind the hedge. I had no idea it&#xD;
was you-that is-I mean-"&#xD;
"You had no idea that I was hiding behind&#xD;
the hedge," said St. John, grimly. "Thank you,&#xD;
Mr. Annesley, for that much courtesy. You are&#xD;
right, too-I was not hiding. I have been in&#xD;
the country to see a friend, and, returning to&#xD;
Tallahoma by this short cut, I stopped here a&#xD;
moment to rest. I regret to have startled your&#xD;
horse. I know by experience that nothing is&#xD;
more provoking. Good-evening."&#xD;
Annesley returned the salutation, and rode&#xD;
on; but as lie ro~le, he thought of the encounter,&#xD;
and the longer he thought, the more singular it&#xD;
appeared to him~ "That fellow is a slippery&#xD;
scoundrel," he thought, "and I am ns certain as&#xD;
I can possibly be of a thing I don't know, that&#xD;
he was hiding when I startled him. 'A friend&#xD;
in the country,' 'resting on the stile '-as if he&#xD;
imagined I would credit such a story! What&#xD;
the deuce is he up to, I wonder? He can't be&#xD;
meaning to turn highwayman; and yet this looks&#xD;
amazingly like it. Ah 1"&#xD;
He pulled up Ilderim with a jerk that almost&#xD;
threw that astonished horse on his haunches,&#xD;
and stopped a minute in the road to think.&#xD;
Like a flash, the recollection of Mrs. Gordon&#xD;
came to him, and he remembered that this stile&#xD;
was almost exactly opposite thegates of Mor~o~i&#xD;
House. Was St. John on his way there ?-did his&#xD;
appearance mean any thinglike annoyance to her?&#xD;
Such a thought was enough to fire Annesley at&#xD;
&#xD;
once. He did not stop to consider whether or&#xD;
not it was probable-that it was possible, was&#xD;
quite sufficient to put his blood in a glow. He&#xD;
wheeled Ilderim about, and in a second was gal-&#xD;
loping back along the road he hail come.&#xD;
At the gates of Morton House, however, he&#xD;
paused. He did not want to startle his cousin&#xD;
unnecessarily, or make himself ridiculous, yet&#xD;
he could not banish an uncomfortable impres-&#xD;
sion that St. John's appearance in that particu-&#xD;
lar place meant mischief: While he was still&#xD;
debating what he should do, the thought of John&#xD;
Warwick came to him as a sort of inspiration.&#xD;
"He will know," he thought. "He has been on&#xD;
the scene, and knows much more of matters&#xD;
than I do. He may be able to tell what the fel-&#xD;
low is after ;and, at all evekits, I need not star-&#xD;
tle my cousin without first learning whether. or&#xD;
not she is likely to be annoyed." Under such&#xD;
circumstances, and with such a person, resolve&#xD;
and execution are very nearly synonymous terms.&#xD;
in the course of another minute, he was gal-&#xD;
loping rapidly toward Tallahoma.&#xD;
Dusk had fallen, as he rode down the village&#xD;
street-his evident haste making more than one&#xD;
person gaze curiously after him-and drew up&#xD;
before Mr. Warwick's office just as that gen-&#xD;
tleman, with his letter to Katharine's would-&#xD;
be employer in his pocket, stepped into, the&#xD;
street.&#xD;
"Why, Annesley 1" he exclaimed, as the&#xD;
eager horseman reined up at the curb-stone. "I&#xD;
am glad to see you back," he continued, coming&#xD;
forward with extended hand. "How are you?~~&#xD;
"Tolerably well, thank you," said Annesley,&#xD;
shaking hands absently, and in a great hurry.&#xD;
"You won't be surprised, or think me very fool-&#xD;
ish, if I ask you a rather abrupt question, will&#xD;
you?" he added, quickly. "I have a special&#xD;
reason for it."&#xD;
"A lawyer has no business ever to be sur-&#xD;
prised," replied Mr. Warwick, noticing the eager&#xD;
concern on~he face before him. "Ask away-a&#xD;
hundred if you like."&#xD;
"Anybody in your office?"&#xD;
"Not a souL"&#xD;
The young man leaned out of his saddle, and&#xD;
spoke low and -quickly. "You know more about&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon's affairs thtin I do," he said. "Is&#xD;
it possible that that fellow St. John could annoy&#xD;
her in any way?"&#xD;
The lawyer started a little.&#xD;
"It is possible, certainly," he answered,&#xD;
coolly; "but it is not at all probable~ Why do&#xD;
you ask?"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Wecause I met him half an hour ago, at thi&#xD;
gates of Morton House."&#xD;
"What ". exclaimed Mr. Warwick, abap.&#xD;
lutely recoiling a step in his amazement. "Yoc&#xD;
must be mistaken, Morton," he went on hastily~&#xD;
"It can't be-it is not possible-that you mel&#xD;
St. John!"&#xD;
I saw him as plainly as I see you, and&#xD;
spoketo him, besides," answered Morton, some~&#xD;
what surprised. "Why should it not be St.&#xD;
John? He-"&#xD;
"Never mind about that ~ interrupted the&#xD;
other hastily. "If you are sure it was the man&#xD;
himself__"&#xD;
"I am-perfectly sure.~~&#xD;
"Well, then, are you also sure that lie was&#xD;
going to Morton House?"&#xD;
"Not at all-as you may judge for yourself."&#xD;
He then proceeded to detail the incident as it oc-&#xD;
curred. "You see," he went on, when he had&#xD;
finished, "it is all pure supposition on my part&#xD;
-and for that reason, I would not run the risk&#xD;
of disturbing my cousin until I had spoken to&#xD;
you about it. If he can annoy her in any&#xD;
way~~&#xD;
"He can annoy her," interrupted Mr. War-&#xD;
wick, "and his venturing to reappear here looks&#xD;
very much as if he had that intention. You are&#xD;
mounted, Annesley. You had better ride on to&#xD;
Morton House at once-I will follow you as soon&#xD;
as I possibly can."&#xD;
"Then you really think-"&#xD;
"Halo, George! Stop a minute!" cried&#xD;
Mr. Warwick, suddenly interrupting him. And&#xD;
when Morton turned, he saw that the person ad-&#xD;
dresa~d was a young man who came riding down&#xD;
the street in their rear. "Good-evening, Clay.&#xD;
-ton," he said, recognizing one of the young&#xD;
"men about town" of Tallahoma; and, ni Clay-&#xD;
ton drew up and returned the salutation, Mr.&#xD;
Warwick went on: "George, you~are going home,&#xD;
are you not? I thought so Lend me your&#xD;
horse, then, for an hour or so. I want to go to&#xD;
the country in haste, and haven't time to wait&#xD;
for my own."&#xD;
"Certainly, Mr. Warwick," said the young&#xD;
man, dismounting instantly. "He's quite at&#xD;
your service,!' he continued, with evidently cor-&#xD;
dial sincerity. "You ifeed not be in a hurry&#xD;
about returning him; and, if you want to go any&#xD;
distance, he's quite fresh-I've only been out to&#xD;
the plantation and back." -&#xD;
"Thank you," said Mr. Warwick, hastily,&#xD;
and mounting the horse without loss of time. "I&#xD;
am in a great hurry-it is most fortunate that&#xD;
&#xD;
you happened to be passing, George. Good.&#xD;
evening.-Now, Annesley!"&#xD;
Annesley needed no second bidding, and side&#xD;
by side the two men whom Fate. had of late&#xD;
seemed capriciously determined to throw togeth-&#xD;
er, rode out of town on their way to Morton&#xD;
House. Considering thdt both horses were put&#xD;
on their mettle, it was not surprising that in a&#xD;
few minutes they reached the large iron gates of&#xD;
the Morton domain, and, in still another min-&#xD;
ute, were cantering up the avenue-looking al.&#xD;
most like spectral horsemen as they rode rap-&#xD;
idly under the bare trees in tIle dusky gloam-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
Their anxiety and uncertainty had in some&#xD;
intangible manner been communicated without&#xD;
toy agency of speech; for certainly each knew&#xD;
what the other was feeling, and yet certainly&#xD;
also, not a word had been spoken on either side&#xD;
after they left Clayton, standing full of surprise&#xD;
and curiosity on the curb-stone in Tallahoma.&#xD;
They were half-way between the gate and the&#xD;
house when the first sound broke the stillness.&#xD;
Suddenly, on the soft evening air, the report of&#xD;
a pistol rang sharply out. Both horses sprang-&#xD;
reared-plunged-and before a ward could be&#xD;
exchanged-in the midst of the struggle for tJie&#xD;
mastery, which ensued on the part of both&#xD;
riders-two other reports followed in quick suc-&#xD;
cession.&#xD;
"What on earth can it be!" said Annealey,&#xD;
as soon as Ilderim, quivering in every limb, was&#xD;
again und~r his controL&#xD;
Mr. Warwick did not answer. He gal loped&#xD;
hastily forWarJ, and the other followed. In an-&#xD;
other minute, they reached the terrace-steps,&#xD;
and came upon a scene that neither of them ever&#xD;
forgot.&#xD;
The reports which they heard had evidently&#xD;
startled the entire household. Notwithstanding&#xD;
the obscurity of the twilight, they were aide to&#xD;
see that figures were running eagerly round the&#xD;
terrace and descending the steps, at the bottom&#xD;
of which a confused movement was taking place.&#xD;
A group of servants were bending over some ob-&#xD;
ject, or objects on the ground; but they all&#xD;
drew back instinctively as the two gentlemen&#xD;
galloped up.&#xD;
"What is it, Harrison?" asked Mr. War-&#xD;
wick, almost before he drew rein.&#xD;
~ The Lord only knows, sir," answered Har-&#xD;
rison-evidently in a state of the wildest excite:&#xD;
ment. - "Two men shot themselves sir --- right&#xD;
here-and the first we knowed of it was when&#xD;
we heard the reports. I was in the kitchen,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ON THE THRESHOLD OF MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
sir, and I jumped up and come a - running,&#xD;
and "&#xD;
"Stand back, all of you!" said Mr. Warwick,&#xD;
impatiently. lie and Annesley pressed forward.&#xD;
it was true. Two figures were lying on the&#xD;
ground where there was every trace of a fierce&#xD;
struggle-one slightly breathing with a pistol&#xD;
still in his hand; the other fallen across the&#xD;
lower step of the terrace-on the very threshold&#xD;
of Morton House-stone dead!&#xD;
For a moment, the unexpected horror or the&#xD;
situation held both men powerless. They looked&#xD;
at each other through the gathering shades of&#xD;
evening, with white faces; but neither of them&#xD;
said a word, until the thought of Mrs. Gordon&#xD;
came to both. What had preceded this trage-&#xD;
dy, they could not even guess; but it would&#xD;
have been strange if their first care had not been&#xD;
for her.&#xD;
"You will see what can be done here," said&#xD;
Annesley, after a moment. "I must go to my&#xD;
cousin.&#xD;
"Yes-go at once," answered Mr. Warwick,&#xD;
quickly. "She must ~hav-e heard the reports,&#xD;
and she may come- Stop that, by any means."&#xD;
Morton did not think this likely; but he gave&#xD;
one or two agile bounds up the terrace-steps,&#xD;
and strode hastily toward the house. He had&#xD;
not gone a dozen paces before he met Babette,&#xD;
running in the direction of the scene of itetion,&#xD;
wringing her hands, and crying aloud. She did&#xD;
not recognize him, and he was forced to claim&#xD;
her attention peremptorily before she would even&#xD;
notice him. When she found who it was, how-&#xD;
ever, she seized his arm with both hands, and&#xD;
poured forth a pitiless lamentation.&#xD;
"M'sieur, what is the matter?" cried she.&#xD;
"I went in madame's room, a minute ago, an~ I&#xD;
found her-poor lady-lying in a dead faint on&#xD;
the sofa. I knew-nh, mon Dieu! I felt sure&#xD;
that M'sieur Gordon had been there. Then I&#xD;
heard the guns, and I saw all the servants run-&#xD;
ning: but I could not leave madame, and&#xD;
she-"&#xD;
"Has she come to herself?" asked Morton,&#xD;
who could not help thinking that a dead faint&#xD;
was the best possible condition for Mrs. Gordon&#xD;
just t~hen.&#xD;
"I can do nothing with her!" cried l3abette,&#xD;
hysterically. "I have tried to bring her to, but&#xD;
I could do nothing with her; andl came to see&#xD;
about the guns-O m'sieur, what is it ?-has&#xD;
M'sieur Gordon-"&#xD;
"You are just the person I" said Annesley,&#xD;
interrupting her; and, much to her surprise, tak-&#xD;
&#xD;
245&#xD;
&#xD;
ing her, in turn, by the arm. He led her for-&#xD;
ward, without giving her time for a word, and&#xD;
stopped at the head of the steps.&#xD;
"Here's Babette, Mr. Warwick," lie said.&#xD;
"She will be able to tell more than anybody&#xD;
else. My cousin, she says, is in a swoon. Why&#xD;
don't you send for lights?"&#xD;
"I have done so," answered Mr. Warwick's&#xD;
voice out of the dusk. "There they come now."&#xD;
They came as he spoke-three or four ex-&#xD;
cited negroes running as hard as possible, some&#xD;
with candles, which they shaded with their&#xD;
hands, and some with pine-torches caught from&#xD;
the kitchen fire-the red flames streaming out&#xD;
wildly on the night air, and lighting up the&#xD;
whole scene with the peculiar glare that only&#xD;
pine produces. It was a singularly picturesque&#xD;
group, if anybody concerned had been able to&#xD;
think even for a moment of its possible effect.&#xD;
Afterward Annesley remembered h6w hp stood&#xD;
at the top of the steps holding the trembling,&#xD;
sobbing Frenchwoman by the arm; how Mr.&#xD;
Warwick directed every thing below how he&#xD;
glanced back at the grim old house behind them,&#xD;
thinking of thd insensible woman within it; how,&#xD;
at that moment, a shrill, piercing scream from&#xD;
Babette made him look round again; how the red&#xD;
glow of the torches fell just then full ~n the&#xD;
face of the dead man, and how he shivered from&#xD;
head to foot as his companion cried wildly:&#xD;
"Ah, mon Dieu l-M'sieur Gordon!"&#xD;
An hour later, Mr. Warwick came out to An-&#xD;
n~shmy, who had left the house and was walking&#xD;
up nnd down the terrace before the front en-&#xD;
trance. Mrs. Gordon insisted upon being left&#xD;
alone with the dead body of her husband, and&#xD;
the doctors were in consultation over St. John,&#xD;
so there had been nothing for Morton to do; and&#xD;
he had come out to see if he could not shake off&#xD;
the numbing horror that seemed to oppress him,&#xD;
in the fresh air, and under the great, silent can-&#xD;
opy of heaven lie had not made maci-a thnn&#xD;
half a dozen turns, however, and the cigar he&#xD;
had mechanically taken out was 5till unlighted&#xD;
in his hand, when the lawyer walked up to&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"The doctors have decided that there is no&#xD;
possible hope ~'or that poor fellow," he said.&#xD;
"The ball has entered his lung in a place which&#xD;
renders extraction impossible; and, death must&#xD;
take place in a few hours-probably sooner. He&#xD;
has recovered consciousness, and I think his sis-&#xD;
ter ought to be summoned Morton you must&#xD;
go for her."&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"For his sister!" repeated Morton, in bc&#xD;
wildermeat, As much as he had time to think&#xD;
he was certainly inclined to believe that Mi&#xD;
Warwick had taken leave of his senses.&#xD;
"I forgot that you did not know," said th&#xD;
etiher. "Miss Tresham is his sister; and she i&#xD;
at Ra~'nor's-George Raynor's. Will you go fo:&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
"I-of course, instantly," said Annesley&#xD;
swallowing this new cause for astonishmeni&#xD;
with a great gulp. "But-if you will excus&#xD;
me-are you sure-is there no mistake-"&#xD;
"I am quite sure," answered Mr. Warwick&#xD;
cutting him short. "There is no mistake what.&#xD;
ever about her being his sister; but it is a long&#xD;
story, and I cannot begin to tell it now. Takc&#xD;
every thing for granted, my good fellow, and go&#xD;
at once-remember, it is a case of life and&#xD;
death."&#xD;
"I am not likely to forget that," the other&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
Nothing more was said by either. Mien,&#xD;
when they know they can rely on each other,&#xD;
are not much given to speech. With his Un-&#xD;
lighted cigar still between his fingers, Annesley&#xD;
walked away to the stables where some officious&#xD;
servant had taken Ilderim, while Mr. Warwick&#xD;
~vent back into the house. His fpot fell softly as&#xD;
in crossing the hall he passed a closed door,&#xD;
under which shone a stream of light. As he&#xD;
sprang into the saddle, he chanced to turn&#xD;
one look at the honac, and caught the same&#xD;
ligl~t-shining steadily over the terrace from a&#xD;
flower-wreathed window. lie drew his breath&#xD;
quickly at sight of it, for he knew what it meant&#xD;
-he knew that in the room ~vhere little more&#xD;
than an hour before the last bitter defiance had&#xD;
passed between them, the widow now watched by&#xD;
her husband's corpse.&#xD;
He had no time for reflection, however. "Re-&#xD;
member, it is a case of life and death," Mr.&#xD;
Warwick ~a4 said; and the young man, as he&#xD;
had answ, Was not likely to forget it. lie&#xD;
gave fld~r~*n ~ sharp taste of the 'obnoxious&#xD;
spurs, aa~ nfter. one wild plunge, was away-cut-&#xD;
ting straight across the park, and taking a plan.&#xD;
station by-way that led through the fields to the&#xD;
Raynor estate. He did not trouble himself&#xD;
much about gates or bars; but when he came&#xD;
to ~ fence-and fences, it seemed to him, had&#xD;
never before been so numerous-gave Ilderim&#xD;
his head, and went straight at it.&#xD;
At this rate, it was Dot long 'before he came&#xD;
in sight of the Raynor house-or rather,~of the&#xD;
Ilaynor out-buildings; for his approach was&#xD;
&#xD;
madefrom the rear. Fortunately, he knew the&#xD;
:, place well, and was at no loss where or how to&#xD;
proceed. Opening one of the usual large plan-&#xD;
tation gates, he let himself into the stable-ydrd,&#xD;
a and riding forward soon came upon a group of&#xD;
servants lazily talking and smoking together.&#xD;
"Here, one of you boys," he said, startling&#xD;
them very much by his unexpected appearance,&#xD;
"take my horse, while I go to the house. Is&#xD;
your master at home?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir- Mass George's at home," an-&#xD;
swered several of the astonished boys. Then&#xD;
two or three of them advanced. "It's Mass&#xD;
* ilenry Dargan, ain't it?" asked the first; for&#xD;
the starlight made personal appearance very&#xD;
much a matter of conjecture.&#xD;
"No-it's Mass Morton Annesley," said an-&#xD;
* other, before Morton himself could reply. "I&#xD;
knows his horse.-Shall I put him up for you,&#xD;
Mr. Annesley?"&#xD;
"No" - answered Anuesley. He stopped&#xD;
and thought a moment. "Is Chancy in the&#xD;
stable?" he asked.&#xD;
"Yes, sir-been up all day."&#xD;
"Change my saddle to him, then, and put a&#xD;
side-saddle on Ilderiin. Make haste about it,&#xD;
and when they are ready, bring them both to&#xD;
the house. Do you understand?"&#xD;
"A side-saddle, sir?"&#xD;
"Yes-i~ side-saddle. Don't waste time over&#xD;
it. Change my saddle as quickly as you can, and&#xD;
bring the horses on."&#xD;
He walked away, leaving the astonished&#xD;
grooms to bewilder themselves with conjectures&#xD;
about this strange order, and took a familiar&#xD;
path to the house. Following it directly, he soon&#xD;
found himself on a side piazza, and, looking&#xD;
through a glass door, saw that the family were&#xD;
at supper. Involuntarily, he stopped a minute-&#xD;
he began to realize now that it was hard to take&#xD;
the next step.&#xD;
Standing thus, he saw Katharine for the&#xD;
first time since that well-remembered day at&#xD;
Bellefont. She was looking pale, hut very pret-&#xD;
ty, he thought, as he watched her sitting exactly&#xD;
opposite the door through which he made his&#xD;
observation. The family party was not large,&#xD;
and supper-if the light meal merited such a&#xD;
heavy name-was set very informally ona small&#xD;
round table. George Raynor, with his crutches&#xD;
beside him, was comfortably established on one&#xD;
side of this, while his wife poured out coffee on&#xD;
the other. Irene Vernon, with a book in her&#xD;
hand, stood by the hearth, where a servant was&#xD;
toasting bread. Being the person most disen-&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
gaged, she first caught a glimpse of Annesley's&#xD;
farce through the glass door, and made a slight&#xD;
exclamation. After that, he had no alternative&#xD;
but to push it open, and enter.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
THS VALLEY or THE SHADOW OF DEATH.&#xD;
SOHETHING in Annesley's face and manner&#xD;
told his story for him as soon as he came in up.&#xD;
on the astonished group. Raynor was the first&#xD;
person who looked up as the door opened, and&#xD;
he made the first echo of Miss Vernon's excla-&#xD;
mation.&#xD;
"Why, Annesley!" he cried, making an&#xD;
effort to rise, and sinking back again, when he&#xD;
remembered his leg. "Good Heavens, Morton!&#xD;
What is the matter?"&#xD;
Morton came forward, and tried to smile, as&#xD;
he held out his hand.&#xD;
"You must excuse my being so unceremoni-&#xD;
ens," he said. "I came through the stable-yard,&#xD;
and followed the side-path to the house. I hope&#xD;
you are all well. It was a shame to startle you&#xD;
sol- indeed, Mrs. Raynor, you need not be&#xD;
alarmed. Nothing is the matter, 1 assure you-&#xD;
at least nothing that concerns you."&#xD;
"Something that concerns~ somebody else,&#xD;
theii," said Raynor, impatiently. "The deuce,&#xD;
man i-don't try to tell us that nothing is the&#xD;
matter when you look like this! What is it?"&#xD;
"1 have come for Miss Tresham," said An-&#xD;
miesley, looking at Katharine, and thinking-&#xD;
poor fellow !-that he had better make a desper-&#xD;
ate plunge into the matter at once. Impulsively,&#xD;
he went over and took her hands-there was&#xD;
something very pitying in his face and eyes;&#xD;
"I am very sorry for you," he said, "I mustbeg&#xD;
you to come with me at once. You are wanted&#xD;
-at Morton House."&#xD;
"Wanted !-by whom?" she asked, for Mor-&#xD;
ton House was the last place she could possibly&#xD;
have expected him to name.&#xD;
"Wanted by "-he hesitated a moment-" by&#xD;
Mr. St. John. He has been in a difficulty, and, I.&#xD;
am sorry to say, is badly wounded."&#xD;
"Ah I" she gave a low cry, and grew sud-&#xD;
denly pale. "But-but he cannot be there!"&#xD;
"Yes, he is there. I cannot tell you any&#xD;
more now," he went on, hastily, as he saw the&#xD;
amazement in her dilated eyes. "You had bet-&#xD;
ter change your dress at once. I have ordered&#xD;
a horse for you-it will b~ the quickest way of&#xD;
&#xD;
THE VALLEY OF THE&#xD;
&#xD;
SHADOW    OF DEATH.                  247&#xD;
reaching Morton House. The sooner we start&#xD;
the better."&#xD;
"Is-" She stopped, and drawing her hand&#xD;
out of his clasp, clutched nervously at the back&#xD;
of the chair from which she had risen, while her&#xD;
words came with a slight gasp-..-" is he dying?"&#xD;
Annesley did not answer, but, being inexperi-&#xD;
enced in dissimulation, his face answered for him.&#xD;
Everybodywho was looking on read the reply&#xD;
written there as plainly as Katharine did. She&#xD;
gave a shuddering sigh, put her hands to her&#xD;
face for an instant, then let them fall, and&#xD;
turned to leave the room.&#xD;
"I will be ready in a minute," she said, in a&#xD;
repressed sort of voice.&#xD;
"I will help you," said Miss Vernon, break-&#xD;
ing the trance of surprise that held them all.&#xD;
She came forward quickly, and drew the girl's&#xD;
hand into her arm. There was something very&#xD;
gentle in the action, and in her face, as she&#xD;
looked back at Annesley.-" She shall be ready&#xD;
hi a minute," she said. "Don't fear any de-&#xD;
lay."&#xD;
They passed out of the room, and then Mor-&#xD;
ton was beset by questions-to which he gave&#xD;
very~unsatisfactory answers indeed. "I don't&#xD;
know much more about the matter than you do,"&#xD;
he said, at last. "And of what I do knew, I am&#xD;
bound to say nothing, because it is no affair of&#xD;
mine. You may hear all about it soon-God&#xD;
knows: I don't. Who is shot? That poor fel-&#xD;
low St John, for one, I can tell you.-George, I&#xD;
had a side-saddle put on Ilderim for Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am, and ordered out Charley for myself. You&#xD;
don't object, do you?"&#xD;
"Object! Of course not," said George.&#xD;
"Chancy has been standing up in the stable eat-&#xD;
ing his head ofl ever since I broke my leg. But,&#xD;
Morton, you can at least tell us what this-St.&#xD;
John is his name ?-has to do with Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am?"&#xD;
"No, I can't," answered Morton. "Miss&#xD;
Tresham will very likely tell you herself," he&#xD;
continued; "until then, my dear fellow, you&#xD;
must restrain your curiosity as best you can.-&#xD;
Mrs. Raynor, will you give me a cup of coffee?&#xD;
I have had no supper this evening."&#xD;
He made the right eiversiou. With all a&#xD;
woman's ready sympathy, Mrs. Raynor was at&#xD;
once intent upon administering to his bodily&#xD;
wants, even in preference to the gratification of&#xD;
her own curiosity. Notwithstanding hi~ pro-&#xD;
test, she insisted upon making him eit as well as&#xD;
drink, and she was so full of this important&#xD;
matter, that she did not find time to ask anotli-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="248-249" xml:id="VAC8070-00000130"/>&#xD;
er question, before Miss Vernon and Katharine&#xD;
came back, the latter equipped and ready to&#xD;
start.&#xD;
"Mr. Annesley, are you not afraid to put her&#xD;
on that wild horse?" Miss Vernon asked, as&#xD;
they stood on the piazza and Morton led Ilderim&#xD;
up. "Minnie is in the stable. Surely she would&#xD;
do."&#xD;
"She would do excellently well for a pleas-&#xD;
nrc - ride," answered Annesley; "but not for&#xD;
such a purpose as this. Charley is by no&#xD;
means safe," he added, "so Ilderim is our Only&#xD;
resource.-Miss Tresham are you afraid of&#xD;
him?."&#xD;
"Not in the least," Katharine answered.&#xD;
"I should not be afraid of any thing, Mr.&#xD;
.Anneslcy, that would take me there at once."&#xD;
"Ilderim will take you there like light-&#xD;
ning," he said, lifting her to the saddle. And,&#xD;
as he said it, a sharp recollection came to both&#xD;
of them of the evening when ~'he had given the&#xD;
name which had come to bear~such a sigiiifi-&#xD;
canoe1 "Ilderim-it signifies 'the Lightning,"'&#xD;
she had said; and now it rested with Ilderim&#xD;
whether or not she should reach her brother's&#xD;
death-bed in time to hear or to speak one last&#xD;
word of love, or pardon, or hope. "Oh!" site&#xD;
said, under her breath, "do you remember?"&#xD;
just as Annesley for his part said, "Do you re-&#xD;
member?" then added quickly, "You are riding&#xD;
him at last."&#xD;
"Take care of her, Mr. Annesley,~~ came&#xD;
from the piazza, in Miss Vernon's voice. It&#xD;
was the Inst sound that followed them as they&#xD;
rode away.&#xD;
"Where are we going?" Katharine asked,&#xD;
as they passed out of the stable-gate to~ether.&#xD;
"This is not the road to Morton House."&#xD;
"Yes, it is-the shortest road," he answered.&#xD;
"A cut across the plantations which will take&#xD;
off ~two or three miles of the distance. Are you I&#xD;
afraid?"&#xD;
"Afraid-with yOu? Oh, no."&#xD;
She said the words very simply, but, out of 1&#xD;
their very simplicity, they touched him deeply, 1&#xD;
making that strange, lonely ride-that gallop at I&#xD;
full speed across the great silent fields, and now 1&#xD;
and then through a dark stretch of woods full 12&#xD;
of the weird, inarticulate voices of the Night- 12&#xD;
an era in his lifeto be ever remembered. What ~&#xD;
man is wise enough to be able to tell when pas. I:&#xD;
sion is born, when it reaches its full height, or&#xD;
when it dies?' Does the turn~of the tide always Ii&#xD;
come when the waves have reached their highest ii&#xD;
point? As they rode along, with the hoof. h&#xD;

strokes of their horses the only audible sour~d,&#xD;
themselves uttering scarcely a word, Nature in&#xD;
silent grandeur all around them, man so far&#xD;
distant, and the great hosts of heaven march.&#xD;
lag steadily overhead, it seemed to Annesley&#xD;
as if much that had before been unintelligible&#xD;
was now made plain to him, lie could not&#xD;
possibly have given expression to the different&#xD;
emotions that swayed him, to the different&#xD;
thoughts that came to him, or to the strange&#xD;
flux and reflux of feeling that possessed him.&#xD;
But all the same, these things left their mark&#xD;
upon his life-all the same, he looked back af-&#xD;
terward to this night as to one of those peri-&#xD;
ods of transition which every human soul must&#xD;
undergo. The forces may be long in marshal-&#xD;
ling, the causes may be long in preparing their&#xD;
effects, but we may know the thrill of final issue&#xD;
when it comes, even though we may not know&#xD;
till long afterward the final result.&#xD;
Annesley had no means of judging what&#xD;
length of time they had been on the road, when&#xD;
at last they reined up before the door of the&#xD;
great stables of Morton House, and, springing&#xD;
to the ground himself, he received the slight,&#xD;
swaying form of his companion in his arms.&#xD;
"Courage, Miss ~fresham I Here we are at&#xD;
last!" he said, kindly. "Don't give way now,&#xD;
after holding out so well. Shall I send for&#xD;
some wine for you, or shall we go to the house&#xD;
at once?"&#xD;
"Let us go," she answered, panting slight-&#xD;
ly. "We must not wait a minute. He-O Mr.&#xD;
Annesley, do you think he is alive?"&#xD;
"Let us trust so. But you ought to have&#xD;
something to strengthen you before-"&#xD;
"No," she interrupted, with feverish eager.&#xD;
aess. "Take me in. I-I am quite well."&#xD;
"Just as you please," he said, with that&#xD;
considerationn which comes from the heart, and&#xD;
~nows, therefore, when it is vain to press even&#xD;
hat which is best on an unwilling recipient.&#xD;
lie drew her hand into his arm, and she remain-&#xD;
)cred afterward how gently and carefully he&#xD;
ed her to the house, speaking now and then&#xD;
dnd words of cheer and comfort. During the&#xD;
ast half-hour of their ride, he had told her all&#xD;
to knew of what had occurred, and who had&#xD;
can St. John's adversary in the quarrel that had&#xD;
ndcd so fatally. Shocked she was, undoubted.&#xD;
y; but almost less so than he had expected.&#xD;
Jt is horrible-horrible for Mrs. Gordon-that&#xD;
~e should have been killed there," she said,&#xD;
rith a shudder; "but, oh~ you cannot tell how&#xD;
is influence has led St. .~ohn astray, and how&#xD;
&#xD;
much this seems to me like retribution!',&#xD;
That ~vas all she said of the man who had so&#xD;
suddenly and so fearfully gone to his account. All&#xD;
her thoughts seemed filled by her brother. An-&#xD;
nesley was astonished to hear with how much&#xD;
tenderness she spoke of him; he could not tell&#xD;
how the news of his danger and extremity cart&#xD;
ned her heart back to the days when they had&#xD;
been children together, and loved each other as&#xD;
only children can love. All the intermediate&#xD;
time of terror and repulsion, of shame and dis-&#xD;
grace, was swept out of her memory. He was&#xD;
her brother, that was enough.&#xD;
As they neared the house, Annesley pointed&#xD;
to the light which streamed from the windows&#xD;
of Mrs. Gordon's room-the room where Katha-&#xD;
rine had spent the first evening of their acquaint-&#xD;
ance.&#xD;
"My cousin's husband was here this after.&#xD;
noon," he said. "He must have seen her in that&#xD;
room, and, as well as we can judge, had just left&#xD;
her, whan-when this took place. His body is&#xD;
there now."&#xD;
"And she?"&#xD;
"Is with it."&#xD;
The girl looked at the light and shivered,&#xD;
Vaguely and dimly she wondered at the possible&#xD;
depths of emotion existing so near her. Out of&#xD;
her own anxiety, she had time for a throb of pity&#xD;
toward the woman who, under the roof that had&#xD;
sheltered her girlhood, received the dead body of&#xD;
the man she had once loved, and, through love,&#xD;
learned to hate.&#xD;
"Does she know how-how it occurred?"&#xD;
she asked.&#xD;
"She knows all that we do," Annesley an-&#xD;
swered; "but that is not much. This is the,&#xD;
door, Miss Tresham."&#xD;
He led her into the house, and the first per~&#xD;
son whom they met was Mr. Warwick.&#xD;
"Thank Heaven, you have come at last I" he&#xD;
said. "I thought you would be too late. He is&#xD;
sinking rapidly.-Miss Tresham are you able to&#xD;
see him at once?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, yes-at once," she said.&#xD;
"Then bring her on, Annesley-this way."&#xD;
Haled the way, and Annesley with Katharine&#xD;
followed. St. John had been insensible when&#xD;
he was brought into the house, so they had&#xD;
carried him up-stairs, to one of the chambers.&#xD;
It chanced to be the one that had been occupied&#xD;
by Felix, and the first thing that met Katharine's&#xD;
eye, as she entered the door, was a number of&#xD;
boyish playthings arranged carefully at the end&#xD;
of the room. The hobby-horse, drum, and gayly.&#xD;
&#xD;
painted bow and arrows, made a strange contrast&#xD;
to a table near by, which was covered with sur-&#xD;
gical instruments and an open medicine-case,&#xD;
such as doctors practising in the country always&#xD;
carry; and to the bed, wit1~ its muslin curtains&#xD;
thrown completely over the old-fashioned can-&#xD;
opy, while the bandaged form of the wounded&#xD;
man rested on top of the coverings. Two doe.&#xD;
tors were in the room-the only two of any skill&#xD;
that Lagrange could boast. One of them was&#xD;
sitting by the bed, the other stood by the table,&#xD;
measuring out some medicine, when Katharine&#xD;
entered. Mr. Warwick walked up to the latter.&#xD;
"Here is Miss Tresharn, doctor," he said.&#xD;
"I suppose there is no danger of her exciting the&#xD;
patient too much?"&#xD;
"I suppose not," answered the doctor, a little&#xD;
ungraciously. He looked keenly and somewhat&#xD;
suspiciously at Miss Tresham. He did not un-&#xD;
derstand matters at all, and he did not care to&#xD;
conceal his resentment of this fact. Who was&#xD;
Mr. St. John ?-how had he been shot ?-what&#xD;
was this about a dead man in the house ?-what&#xD;
the deuce did this girl, whom he knew as the*&#xD;
subject of a great deal of Lagrange gossip, have&#xD;
to do with it all? Doctors are subject to the&#xD;
infirmities of human curiosity as well as other&#xD;
men, and do not like to be kept in the dark a&#xD;
whit better. Perhaps this doctor liked ita shade&#xD;
less, as ha tone showed, when he said, stiffly:&#xD;
"I suppose not-the patient is considerably past&#xD;
being harmed by any thing."&#xD;
"Oh, doctor, is there no hope?" asked a&#xD;
voice, against the pathetic sweetness of which&#xD;
even the doctor was not proof. He glanced&#xD;
quickly at the gray eyes lifted to his face-then&#xD;
looked away again.&#xD;
"I thought you would have told her that the&#xD;
man must die," he said, addressing Mr. War-&#xD;
wick.&#xD;
"He did tell me-that is, I have heard it,"&#xD;
said Katharine, before the lawyer could speak.&#xD;
"Only I thought I would like to hear your opin-&#xD;
ion myself. He is my brother," she added, after'&#xD;
a momentary pause. "You will forgive me for&#xD;
asking how long he can live?"&#xD;
"That is a question which it is hard for me&#xD;
to answer," said the deetor, more gently than&#xD;
might have been expected; then he shot a glance&#xD;
half questioning, half indignant, at Mv. Warwick&#xD;
"Mr. St. John's wound is mortal," he went on;&#xD;
"but in these eases it is hard to' determine ex-&#xD;
actly when death will ensue, so much depends&#xD;
on the vital power of the system. He may live&#xD;
two or three hours-possibly even through the&#xD;

night-or he may die within ten minutes. I cas&#xD;
not tell."&#xD;
"Which do you think most probable?"&#xD;
"As far as I can judge, he is sinking rapidly&#xD;
He has already lived longer than I anticipated.'&#xD;
Annesley, on whose arm she still leaned, fel&#xD;
her shudder from head to foot; but ehe sak&#xD;
nothing. Her face grew a shade whiter, perhaps&#xD;
and her lips set themselves with painful rigidity&#xD;
but that was all. The doctor thought to himaci:&#xD;
that she had no feeling. "She ealls the pooi&#xD;
man her brother, and takes the news of his cer&#xD;
tam death like this! ". he thought, as she drei~&#xD;
her hand from Morton's arm, and crossed the&#xD;
floor alone, to the side of the bed.&#xD;
St. Jo~in lay in what was apparently a deep&#xD;
stupor, Or what was, perhaps, the prostration&#xD;
which precedes dissolution, and verges on insen-&#xD;
sibility. The henidrrhage from his wound had&#xD;
been so excessive that his face was bleached to&#xD;
a deathly pallor; but otherwise it showed 'no&#xD;
signs of the approaching death which the doctor&#xD;
prophesied. Looking' at him, Katharine could&#xD;
scarcely believe that it was indeed so near, un-&#xD;
til suddenly a sharp convulsion of agony passed&#xD;
over the face, and roused it from its repose.&#xD;
The lips sprang apart, then closed tightly over a&#xD;
groan, while the eyes opened full on her face.&#xD;
In an instant she saw that he was perfectly con~-&#xD;
scions. As soon as the paroxysm abated-it did&#xD;
not last more than a minute-he strove to speak,&#xD;
but, failing in this, lifted his hand, and motioned&#xD;
her to come nearer. The doctor silently resigned&#xD;
his seat, and, sinking into it, she bent her face&#xD;
down almost on a level with his own, while her&#xD;
hands clasped eagerly over the one he had ex-&#xD;
tended.&#xD;
"Don't try to talk, dear," she said, gently.&#xD;
"Here 1 am-l shall not leave you."&#xD;
"You won't be needed long," he answered.&#xD;
His voice was very weak, and had a slight eat~h&#xD;
between the words; but otherwise there was no&#xD;
change, and the old mocking cadence still rang in&#xD;
its notes.&#xD;
"Oh, St.. John-" Her own voice broke down&#xD;
hi the quiver of sobs that were hastily choked&#xD;
back. 'This was x&amp;amp;either thue nor place for them&#xD;
-espcciall~ since 'the doctor's hand was laid&#xD;
heavily on her shoulder, and the doctor's voice&#xD;
said in her ear, "The least excitement will kill&#xD;
him in a minute." She fought hard for self-con.&#xD;
trol, and after time gained it. At last she was&#xD;
able to say, quietly, "I will not leave you-but&#xD;
pray keep quiet. The doctor says the least ex-&#xD;
citement is very dangerous."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Confound the doctor!" answered St John,&#xD;
peevishly, apparently quite unconscious that this&#xD;
personage stood just by his side. "What is the&#xD;
use of keeping quiet?" he went on. "Why,"&#xD;
with a singular inflection of contempt, "I know,&#xD;
t as well as he does, that I'm done 'for! Only&#xD;
I there's one or two things I must say to you, if-&#xD;
if I can."&#xD;
"Don't try-oh, pray don't try!"&#xD;
r "I must, I tell you!" This quite impatiently&#xD;
* -then, more faintly, "Water-my throat is dry-&#xD;
* I-can hardly talk."&#xD;
Katharine turned, but the doctor was al-&#xD;
ready at hand, with a glass of water in which a&#xD;
stimulant was infused. "He is sinking fast," he&#xD;
said, as he leaned over her. "If he has any&#xD;
* thing on his mind, let him say it. H~ may go&#xD;
off any moment."&#xD;
lint, after dAnking the water, St. John seemed&#xD;
to sink hack into stupor. Holding his hand,&#xD;
Katharine chanced to rest her fingers on the&#xD;
pulse, and she was startled to feel how weak and&#xD;
slow it was. Life was ebbing fast-even her&#xD;
inexperience began to appreciate this, especially&#xD;
when she noted that awful grayness which is the&#xD;
first shadow of approaching dissolution, and&#xD;
which no one, who has seen it once, can ever&#xD;
forget or mistake,' 'stealing over the face. lie&#xD;
looked very handsome as he lay with closed&#xD;
eyes, and slightly-heaving chest. All that was&#xD;
repulsive about the face seemed to have been&#xD;
fined away as by a sharp chisel. The features&#xD;
stood out with the pure clearness of sculptured&#xD;
marble, and the dark lashes and brows made the&#xD;
only contrast to the deadly.white pallor of the&#xD;
complexion. Mr. Warwick and Annesley ex-&#xD;
changed a glance-was it only imagination, or&#xD;
did they notice a strange, subtle likeness coming&#xD;
out on this face, to that other lhce lying evcn&#xD;
more still and white, below? .iust now, they&#xD;
thought it was imagination, but afterward-when&#xD;
the full horror of the truth was known to them-&#xD;
they knew that fancy had not played them false,&#xD;
but that the hand of death had brought out with&#xD;
a force not to be mistaken the trace and the&#xD;
proof of common blood~&#xD;
Se~'eral mimtes passed, then Mr. Warwick&#xD;
came up ~o Katharine, and, standing in the shade&#xD;
behind her chair, bent down and spoke.&#xD;
"If he rouses again, you must ask him how&#xD;
this occurred," he said. "The other man is&#xD;
dead, and it is important'that we should know."&#xD;
"Very well," she answered, under her breath&#xD;
-and just at that moment, with a slight start,&#xD;
St. John opened his eyes.&#xD;

"Katharine-are you there?" he asked, his&#xD;
voice having become much weaker since he spoke&#xD;
last.&#xD;
"Yes, I am here," she answered, bending for-&#xD;
ward so that he could see her. "Is there any&#xD;
thing lean do for you?"&#xD;
He muttered something, but so low that she&#xD;
did not catch his words. Then, while she was&#xD;
still straining her ears, he turned his head, and&#xD;
said abruptly," Is Gordon dead?"&#xD;
Katharine had been so entirely unprepared&#xD;
for such a question, that she did not know what&#xD;
to reply; she did not know what the effect might&#xD;
be of the unsoftened truth. She looked at the&#xD;
doctor; but the doctor's face was non-expressive&#xD;
-at Annesley, but there was nothing to direct&#xD;
her there. It was not until Mr. Warwick said,&#xD;
in a low voice, "Tell him," that she found cour-&#xD;
ag6 to answer.&#xD;
"Yes, St. John; he is dead."&#xD;
You are sure ?&#xD;
"lam quite sure.~~&#xD;
There was silence after this. St. John drew&#xD;
a deep breath-to every one of the bystand-&#xD;
ers it sounded almost like a sigh of relief-and&#xD;
*      lay quiet for some time. Katharine was on the&#xD;
point of speaking again, when he anticipated&#xD;
her, uttering his words faintly, and with evident&#xD;
*      effort.&#xD;
"So that is settled," he said. "Well, I&#xD;
didn't mean to kill him; but I should be a cant-&#xD;
ing hypocrite if I said it was not a good riddance&#xD;
*     to everybody! He tried me too far," he went&#xD;
on, gathering a little more strength. " It was&#xD;
all his fault-not mine. He was in one of the&#xD;
devil's own rages, and I was desperate. They&#xD;
have told you all about it, I suppose, Katharine."&#xD;
"How could they?" she answered sadly.&#xD;
*      "Nobody knows any thing about it."&#xD;
"Don't they?" said he, with the old mock.&#xD;
ing sneer on his white lip. "It would be a pity&#xD;
if their curiosity should never be gratified. Of&#xD;
course, you know how it was, though.. When a&#xD;
man is hungry, and footsore, and penniless, he is&#xD;
next to a wild beast, and I was all those things,&#xD;
a f~w hours ago. I knew Gordon would be here&#xD;
about this time; and I bad been wandering about&#xD;
the country for days; keeping a sharp lookout&#xD;
for him. At last I met a boy-to-day, was it?-&#xD;
who had driven him to Tallahoma. Then I came&#xD;
on as quickly as possible, and I thought Morton&#xD;
House would be the best place to find him-the&#xD;
safest place for me, that is. Just as Igot to the&#xD;
terrace, he came down the steps. It seemed be&#xD;
'had found out that the child was gone, and that&#xD;
&#xD;

his wife was out of his power. If you knew any&#xD;
thing about him, you'd know what sortof a scene&#xD;
we had then. He was out of his head with fury,'&#xD;
especially against me, who had brought him here&#xD;
for nothing, while I was jus1~ as ready as not t&amp;amp;&#xD;
have out all the old scores I There was plenty&#xD;
of them, for I had been his eat's-paw for many a&#xD;
day, with mo~t of the labor, and all the risk,&#xD;
and hardly a taste of th~ profit. I told him he&#xD;
should not stir till he had promised to give me&#xD;
something-any thing-to live on, and, in that&#xD;
case, I engaged never to come near him again.&#xD;
He had not sense enough to close with the offer&#xD;
-considering all that had gone before, an amaz-&#xD;
ingly liberal one, I can tell you-but he dared to&#xD;
say that he would give half his fortune to take&#xD;
me to the gallows, but not a penny to keep me&#xD;
from it. At that, [lost my temper. I-oh, this&#xD;
cursed throat! Give me some water."&#xD;
It was given to him, and, after drinking, he&#xD;
went on of his own accord:&#xD;
"You need not think I fired without provo-&#xD;
cation at an unarmed man. I did not mean to&#xD;
use the pistol-in fact, it was in my pocket, and&#xD;
I had forgotten all about it. I would not have&#xD;
touched it, if I had not. been at a terrible dis-&#xD;
advantage. But he fought like a tiger, and he&#xD;
soon got the better of me. In th~ scuffle the&#xD;
d-d thing went off, and gave me this wound.&#xD;
Then I knew I was done for, and the devil en-&#xD;
tered m~, and I was determined to kill him. I&#xD;
managed to draw it, and fired twice. I-I don't&#xD;
believe he stirred afterward."&#xD;
"He is exciting himself too much," said doc-&#xD;
tor No. 2, in the midst of the pause wh~eh fol-&#xD;
lowed tho last words-words over which' the&#xD;
dying man's voice had sunk into inarticulate&#xD;
weakness. "He will kill himself in ten minutes,&#xD;
at this rate! Miss Tresharn, you must not let&#xD;
him talk."&#xD;
"But I will talk," interrupted St. John. "If&#xD;
I choose to kill myself in ten minutes, whose&#xD;
business is itt? Not yours, at any rate I-Katha-&#xD;
rine, I-I have something to say to you."&#xD;
"Had you not better be quiet, dear?"&#xD;
"I can't think what it was"-a strange gasp.&#xD;
lug and catching was now audible in the weak&#xD;
voice, the gray shade stole more plainly over the&#xD;
face, and an awe settled on those around him.&#xD;
"I-yes, I wanted to tell you that I am sorry&#xD;
I have been such a drag and terror on your life~'&#xD;
I don't know, but-but it seems now' as' it' I&#xD;
might-perhaps-do a little better, if it were to&#xD;
live over again. It is too late now for any thing&#xD;
of that sort; but-I am sorry."&#xD;

&#xD;
end of the room, and, walking to it, threw them&#xD;
open. He felt as if it might be possible to th,~ow&#xD;
off something of the ghastly horror of the night&#xD;
with these first tokens of God's day.&#xD;
When he came back to the fire, he was star-&#xD;
tled to see the change which the last few hours&#xD;
had made in Mrs. Gordon's appearance. She&#xD;
looked inconceivable old and haggard, as she sat&#xD;
there in the pale morning light-inconceivably&#xD;
worse than he could have imagined that even the&#xD;
* long watches of this fearful night would have&#xD;
made her look. Before he could speak, she an.&#xD;
ticipated him.&#xD;
"Sit down," she said. "I have something&#xD;
to say to you, and I can say it better now than&#xD;
hereafter." She paused a moment, then added,&#xD;
gently, "Is that poor man np-stairs dead?"&#xD;
"Yes," he atiswered, a little surprised, not at&#xD;
the question itself', but at the tone of it. "Yes,&#xD;
he is dead-he has been dead for several hours."&#xD;
She gave a deep sigh, and, leaning back,&#xD;
closed her eyes. There are few stranger things&#xD;
in this strange world than the similarity and asso-&#xD;
ciation of sound. This sigh immediately recalled&#xD;
to Mr. Warwick's mind the sigh which St. John&#xD;
had uttered on hearing of Gbrdon's death. In&#xD;
both there was a cadence of' unmistakable re-&#xD;
lief which his car was able to detect, though it&#xD;
had been mingled with a singular chord of other&#xD;
emotions. Some instinct warned him that he&#xD;
was not yet at the end of this night's eventful&#xD;
history-that there was something yet to hear,&#xD;
something yet to do, before the sun should rise.&#xD;
Thinking of this, he did not observe that Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon uneloted her eyes) and when she spoke,&#xD;
her voice startled him.&#xD;
"Where is Miss Tresham?" she asked.&#xD;
"Was she sent for? Ta she here?"&#xD;
"Miss Tresham is here," he anawered-theit&#xD;
added, after a second, "she is lying down, I&#xD;
believe. The agitation which she underwent&#xD;
at her brother's death was too much for her.&#xD;
He had scarcely ceased to breathe) when she&#xD;
fainted."&#xD;
"But she has recovered-has she not?"&#xD;
"So the servants tell me. I have not seen&#xD;
her since I carried her out of the room."&#xD;
"Bjibette is an excellent nurse," said Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon, with more interest than he had expect-&#xD;
ed. "Has she seen her?"&#xD;
"She is with her now, I think."&#xD;
"Ah I" with a faint sigh, "then she is in&#xD;
good hands. There iS no fear of her dying," she&#xD;
went on, a little bitterly. "Neither grief nor&#xD;
trouble is merciful enough to kill. Twill speak&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
of her again, after a while. Now, I should like&#xD;
to ask you something else. Did he-did St.&#xD;
John-give any account before he died of how&#xD;
all this occurred i'"&#xD;
"Yes; just before he died, he told his sister."&#xD;
He then related all that the dying man bad said,&#xD;
adding, when it i~as over: "Every thing goes to&#xD;
corroborate this statement. The time at which&#xD;
Morton met him-the time we occupied in com-&#xD;
ing from Tallahoma-the shots we beard, and the&#xD;
condition in which we found the two men. The&#xD;
doctors also say that the position of the wound&#xD;
proves it was given accideiftally aild in the man-&#xD;
ncr described."&#xD;
"Then there is no doubt that he killed my-&#xD;
my husband?"&#xD;
"There is no doubt of that. I can only ask&#xD;
you to think for a moment of his provocation,&#xD;
and you will scarcely be able to condemn him,&#xD;
as we condemn a cold-blooded murderer."&#xD;
"Condemn him!" Her tone and manner&#xD;
surprised the lawyer somuch that he could only&#xD;
gaze at her in astonishment. Excitement sprang&#xD;
into the eyes, passion quivered in the -voice-&#xD;
some overpowering emotion, seemed to seize and&#xD;
shake her form from head to foot. "Condemn&#xD;
him! My God! I can only pity him, till pity&#xD;
grows into pain. I can only look with horror-&#xD;
as I have looked all this night-on the t~rriblc&#xD;
retribution which even in this world erisse some-&#xD;
times works for itself!"&#xD;
Was she mad? Had the shock proved too&#xD;
much for her mind? Mr. Warwick almost&#xD;
feared that it had, as he met those burning eyes.&#xD;
The daylight began to broaden by this time, and&#xD;
he saw more plainly the ravages of fierce emo-&#xD;
tion, already suffered, on that white, haggard,&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"Try to be quiet, Mrs. Gordon," he said.&#xD;
"I am afraid I ought not to have told you all&#xD;
this. You have undergone too much excite-&#xD;
ment. You arc not yourself. Let me beg you&#xD;
to rest-to talk no more."&#xD;
"I must," she answered. "it is a work of'&#xD;
justice, and it must be done. Don't fear about&#xD;
me. I shall hav~i strength enough to do it, and,&#xD;
after that, nothing matters~ It does not even&#xD;
matter if I never see Felix again, for he is sa~fe&#xD;
now. Does that sound horrible? Should not I&#xD;
think of it now, while 1w lies dead?"&#xD;
"It is natural that you could not avoidthink.&#xD;
ing of it," he said. "But let me entreat you-"&#xD;
lie spoke in vain. She did not even hear'&#xD;
him, but went on with what she was goin~ to&#xD;

off. It wa* horrible! He beganto appreciate it on. "Neither Miss Tresham nor yourself are in&#xD;

night-he 'could not all at once realize the her feet. "Come with me," she said, walking&#xD;
real tie which united those two men, both of toward the door.&#xD;
&#xD;
Half mechanically he followed. She crossed&#xD;
the hall, and led the way into the apartment&#xD;
where she had spent the night. It was the sit.&#xD;
ting-room which he knew well. On the couch&#xD;
where he had left her the afternoon previous&#xD;
-the couch where she had been' sleeping when&#xD;
her husband entered - the body of the dead&#xD;
man lay, with a shawl thrown over 'the figure,&#xD;
while the face remained uncovered. Before leav-&#xD;
ing the room, Mrs. Gordon had extinguished sev-&#xD;
eral candles on a table near by, and opened the&#xD;
blinds of the' window through which he had en-&#xD;
tered. It looked toward the east, an.d as much&#xD;
of daylight as there was, streamed freely into&#xD;
the apartment-streamed over the couch and the&#xD;
white face pillowed on its cushions.&#xD;
She moved so as to command a view of this&#xD;
face, and motioned 'him to approach. He did so,&#xD;
and thus, for the first time, saw clearly in death&#xD;
the man whom he had never seen in life.&#xD;
Handsome as that face had always been, it was&#xD;
something ~'ar more than handsome now-it was&#xD;
almost beautiful, under the refining touch of&#xD;
death, and with the peculiar serenity of expres-&#xD;
sion which sometimes comes to the clay when&#xD;
the spirit has left it. But that which struck Mr.&#xD;
Warwick at once, and startled him most strange-&#xD;
ly, was the likeness to St. John-as St. John's&#xD;
face had reminded him of this, though he had&#xD;
only seen the latter hastily and indistinctly.&#xD;
There had been no likeness between them in&#xD;
life-even now, the whole cast of feature was so&#xD;
entirely dissimilar that it was difficult to deter-&#xD;
mine where the resemblance was, and in what it&#xD;
consisted. But no one could possibly have&#xD;
failed to perceive that there was a resemblance&#xD;
-that, in some subtle manner, the blood which&#xD;
they owned in common asserted itself, and&#xD;
stamped each face with a token which even&#xD;
the most superficial gazer must have observed.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick certainly observed it, and it ban-&#xD;
isl~ied from his mind the last doubt of the story&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon had told him. She was standing&#xD;
by him, when he said, half unconsciously:&#xD;
"It is true. It is there."&#xD;
"So you see it, too?" she said. "I brought&#xD;
you for this purpose," she added, after a mo-&#xD;
ment "We will go now. I-I cannot talk&#xD;
here."&#xD;
She led the way again to the door, and again&#xD;
he followed her. They were in the dining-room,&#xD;
when she spoke next.&#xD;
"That was why I took you ia-to show you&#xD;
the likeness which death has brought out so&#xD;
strongly," she said. "The perception of this&#xD;
&#xD;
resemblance first made me think of telling Miss&#xD;
Tresham the terrible truth at once. Remember,&#xD;
I have not the least proof of the story, save my&#xD;
own word, and-and that. But I am sure it&#xD;
would be impossible for her to look at that face&#xD;
and refuse to believe mc."&#xD;
"I agree with you that far, but why be in&#xD;
such haste ?-why not rest, yourself, and let her&#xD;
rest? A few hours hence-"&#xD;
"Can you answer for the change which an&#xD;
hour may make in that face? ' And will the&#xD;
force of the blow be less great to-morrow than&#xD;
'to-day?"&#xD;
He saw that she was resolved; so he did&#xD;
what it would have been wisest to have done at&#xD;
first-he submitted.&#xD;
"What do you want?" he asked.&#xD;
"I want you to go for her, and, if possible,&#xD;
~bring her here. But first, one momcnt-give&#xD;
me a pencil and a piece of paper."&#xD;
Somewhat puzzled, he produced a pencil and&#xD;
that inevitable last resource for writing emergen-&#xD;
cies with a man-the backof a letter.&#xD;
"Will that do?" he asked.&#xD;
"That will do," she answered. $he wrote&#xD;
a few words, then tore off the strip of paper,&#xD;
folded it, and, greatly to his surprise, handed it&#xD;
to him. "Keep it," she said, "and when I ask&#xD;
Miss Tresham one or two questions which I must&#xD;
ask her, see if her answers correspond with&#xD;
what is written there. Now, go and bring&#xD;
her. Remember-bring her, if she can possi-&#xD;
bly come."&#xD;
With those words-words the earnestness of&#xD;
which it was impossible to disregard-sounding&#xD;
in his ears, he went up-stairs. As he was look-&#xD;
ing round for a servant to send with a message&#xD;
to Katharine, he saw Annesley standing with his&#xD;
baek to him at a large window which ended the&#xD;
upper passage, 'atid overlooked the froni~ en-&#xD;
trance. He went to him immediately, and&#xD;
touched his shoulder.&#xD;
"Do you know how Miss Tresham is?" he&#xD;
asked, as the young man turned quickly round.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham!" repeated Morton. "Did~'&#xD;
you ask how she is; or where she is?"&#xD;
"How she is, of course. I thought you&#xD;
might have heard."&#xD;
"She is much better-so much better, that&#xD;
she is in that room "-he nodded In the direction&#xD;
of the chamber where St. John had died-" I&#xD;
was staying there, but she' came in, and begged&#xD;
me to leave her alone with-.-with the body."'&#xD;
"And is she there now 1'"&#xD;
"Yes, she is there now.&#xD;

IN THE DAWN.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="256-257" xml:id="VAC8070-00000134"/>&#xD;
256                              MORTO~&#xD;
To Annesley's surprise, Mr. Warwick turned&#xD;
and walked into the room thus indicated..&#xD;
Every thing had been put in order, and the&#xD;
chamber, seen in the light of early dawn, looked&#xD;
singularly calm and peaceful when he entered.&#xD;
The white bed, with the motionless figure upon&#xD;
it, occupied the centre of the floor, and candles&#xD;
still burned at the head and foot. By the side,&#xD;
Katharine knelt with the little crucifix in her&#xD;
hands, on which the dead man's last glance had&#xD;
been fixed. It was a touching picture, the law-&#xD;
yer thought, as he paused a moment, with un-&#xD;
conscious reverence, on the threshold. Twelve&#xD;
hours before, and how great had been his scorn,&#xD;
how profound his contempt for that man !-now&#xD;
the great sanctification of death had come, and he&#xD;
lowered his voice, and softened his tread, even in&#xD;
presence of that poor forsaken dust. Truly we&#xD;
live in the midst of mystery -who shall cx.&#xD;
plain even this?&#xD;
Katharine had heard his step, light as it was,&#xD;
and, rising to her feet, she looked round. When&#xD;
she saw who it was, she smiled a faint, pitiful&#xD;
sort of smile, and motioned him to draw nearer.&#xD;
"Come and see," she said, pointing to the&#xD;
still face. "Does that look as if it had ever&#xD;
known violence or sin?"&#xD;
Certainly it dkf not. Even more marked&#xD;
than on the face below.-because here the end&#xD;
had been less sudden-was the peculiarly serene&#xD;
expression which ~lways follows death from gun.&#xD;
shot-wounds. The placid lips seemed almost&#xD;
about to smile, and on the brow, and around the&#xD;
closed eyes, there was a seal of ineffable calm-&#xD;
calm almost like that "pathetic peace of God" 4&#xD;
which, on the faces of thoso'~ho in the beautiful&#xD;
language of Holy Writ have "fallen on sleep,"&#xD;
sometimes hushes into awe the very sobs and&#xD;
tears of mourning. B.ut here-even as below-&#xD;
was the likeness.-intensified, if possible, since&#xD;
he had noticed it first. It startled him at once&#xD;
into a remembrance of the errand on which he&#xD;
had come.&#xD;
"Mi~s Trerham," he said, " Mrs. Gordon is&#xD;
very anxious to see you. Will you come to her?"&#xD;
Much to his surprise, for he had expected to I&#xD;
meet with some dilliculty, Katharine assented at I&#xD;
~once. a&#xD;
"Ican do nothing here," she said, mournfully a&#xD;
nothing, save pray I am only too glad if I o&#xD;
can be of the least cpwfort to Mrs. Gordon. Is g&#xD;
she very much prostrated~ Mr. War wick?" d&#xD;
"She i~ supported by excitement now," he h&#xD;
answered. "I am afraid she will be terribly ti&#xD;
prostrated when it is over." v&#xD;
&#xD;
HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
That was all that was exchanged. Annesley&#xD;
looked surprised, when they passed him on their&#xD;
way down-stairs; but he said nothing, and the&#xD;
silence lasted until they reached the dining-&#xD;
room. Then-before opening the door-Mr.&#xD;
Warwick thought it well to give a slight warning&#xD;
to his companion.&#xD;
"Don't beastonished," he said, "if Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
don asks you some questions that do not seem&#xD;
to you exactly relevant. She has ~ good reason&#xD;
for doing so, and I am sure you will confer a fa-&#xD;
vor on her by answering them frankly."&#xD;
"I-of course 1 will, if I can," said Katha-&#xD;
rine, already much astonished.&#xD;
After this, he opened the 'door, and they&#xD;
walked in. Mrs. Gordon was sitting by the fire,&#xD;
where he had left her; but she looked up when&#xD;
they entered. Then rising, she advanced a few&#xD;
steps, and held out her hands to Katharine, with&#xD;
a grace which, even at that moment, was some-&#xD;
what stately.&#xD;
"Miss Tresham," she said, in the rich, sweet&#xD;
volee which had charmed Katharine when she&#xD;
heard it first, "I cannot claim your sympathy,&#xD;
nor offer my own itt the grief that has fallen&#xD;
upon us, until I have asked you to forgive me."&#xD;
Notwithstanding the grace and the stateliness,&#xD;
there was much of hesitation both in her voice&#xD;
and manner-for she remembered the day at&#xD;
Mrs. Marks's when she had last seen Katharine,&#xD;
and she did not know how her advances were&#xD;
likely to be received. She need have felt no&#xD;
doubt on this score. Almost before she finished&#xD;
speaking, these outstretched hands were taken&#xD;
eagerly and warmly.&#xD;
"Dear Mrs. Gordon," said the girl, gently,&#xD;
"theic is no need to utter such a word. I have&#xD;
nothing to forgive. I can only love and pity&#xD;
you--if you will let me."&#xD;
It was so sweetly, so simply, so earnestly&#xD;
mid, that, by a sudden impulse, the elder woman&#xD;
pened her arms. In a second, the first tears&#xD;
irhieh either of them bad shed, flowed together.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick walked away to the other end&#xD;
f the room. It was a very long apartment, and&#xD;
ic might almost have been out of it, for all that&#xD;
ic heard of the words spoken, or the tears and&#xD;
obs mingled by the fire. There was not very&#xD;
~uch of the latter: neither of these won~en was&#xD;
a demonstrative nature; and, with both, the&#xD;
rief which oppressed them ~as not of that ten-&#xD;
e~ l~ind which can be "cried away~" A few&#xD;
ot, bitter drops; a few dry, choking sobs, and&#xD;
fiat was all. Before very long, Mrs. Gordon's&#xD;
olee recalled him.&#xD;
&#xD;
IN THE DAWN.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick," she said-and Mr. Warwick&#xD;
turned instantly and came bae~ to the fireplace.&#xD;
A small round table, on which some ~upper had&#xD;
been arranged for Morton and himself, was still&#xD;
near the hearth-rug where it had been placed.&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon and Katharine were standing on one&#xD;
side of it as he advanced from the other. In&#xD;
this manner they faced each other. There was&#xD;
something almost judicial about the scene, he&#xD;
conidnot help thinking.&#xD;
"Mr. Warwick," said Mrs. Gordon, a little&#xD;
formally, "will you look at the paper Which I&#xD;
gave you a few minutes ago, and see if Miss&#xD;
Tresham's answers correspond to the answers&#xD;
written there? '~ Then she turned to Katharine.&#xD;
"Don't think that I intrude upon your re-&#xD;
serve," she said, gently, "when I ask you to tell&#xD;
me how you are related to-to Mr. St. John?"&#xD;
"I have no reason for reserve upon that&#xD;
point," Kathaiine answered. "I have not had&#xD;
for some time. I am his sister."&#xD;
"His own sister?"&#xD;
"Yes-his own sister. There were " -her&#xD;
voice faltered - "there were only two of&#xD;
us."&#xD;
"And will you let me ask what was your&#xD;
mother's maiden name?"&#xD;
Katharine looked a little surprised. She did&#xD;
not understand-she did not see the point or&#xD;
meaning-of these questions. But she felt&#xD;
somewhat apathetic and indifferent about them.&#xD;
It was strange that Mrs. Gordon should ask such&#xD;
things at such a time; but there was no reason&#xD;
* why she should not answer them; and so-after&#xD;
a second-she replied:&#xD;
"IMly mother's maiden name was Katharine&#xD;
O'Grady."&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon looked at Mr. Warwick. He&#xD;
glanced up from the paper, with a slightly-signifi-&#xD;
cant expression. Nothing was said-only that&#xD;
glance was exchanged-and then the lady turned&#xD;
again to address Katharine.&#xD;
"Forgive me for pressing you, but I should&#xD;
like to ask one or two further questions. Was&#xD;
your grandfather an Irishman by birth, and did&#xD;
he live in Martinique?"&#xD;
"So I have heard my aunt say," Katharine&#xD;
answered. "I never saw him-he died before I&#xD;
was born. My mother and my aunt were both&#xD;
native West-Indians," she went on. "They were&#xD;
born in Martinique."&#xD;
~ And do you remember your ~&#xD;
"I? Oh, no. She died when I was a few&#xD;
weeks old. My aunt was my mother," sh~ said,&#xD;
softly.&#xD;
&#xD;
257&#xD;
&#xD;
* "And did she never tell you any thing about&#xD;
your father ?-who, or what he was? "&#xD;
"Never. My impression always was that he&#xD;
was dead-though I cannot remember that my&#xD;
aunt ever absolutely said so." She paused a&#xD;
moment, then added: "Since her own death, I-&#xD;
I have sometimes thought this might not be."&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon extended her hand across the&#xD;
table, and took from Mr. Warwick the slip of&#xD;
paper, which he at once surrendered. She gave&#xD;
it to Katharine, saying,:&#xD;
"1 wrote those answers to the questions I&#xD;
have asked you before you came down-read&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Wondering more and more the girl obeyed.&#xD;
This was what she read-written hastily in pen-&#xD;
cii on the torn fragment of a letter.&#xD;
"Maiden name of mother-Katharine 0'-&#xD;
Grady.&#xD;
"Time of her death-soon after the birth of&#xD;
her second child.&#xD;
"Grandfather an Irishman by birth, who lived&#xD;
in Martinique."&#xD;
Katharine looked up with profound astonish-&#xD;
ment visible in her face.&#xD;
"I gave the paper to Mr. Warwick~ when he&#xD;
went for you," Mrs. Gordon answered.&#xD;
"But how-how was it possible? How did&#xD;
you-know?"&#xD;
"Child," answered the other, so gently and&#xD;
sadly that her voice seemed, as it were, to still&#xD;
instead of excite emotion, "I know, because I&#xD;
heard the whole story from your father's lips."&#xD;
Mr. Warwick, who was looking on apprehen-&#xD;
sively, notwithstanding this apprehension, was&#xD;
alarmed by the change that at those words&#xD;
came over Katharine's face. She turned deadly&#xD;
pale, and quivered from head to foot. Did&#xD;
something like an instinct of the truth dawn&#xD;
upon her? It almost seemed so. It almost&#xD;
seemed as if fear, doubt, terror, and amazement,&#xD;
were all struggling in her eyes and in her voice&#xD;
when she spoke.&#xD;
"Mrs. Gordon "-it was fairly a ~vall-" what&#xD;
do you ~&#xD;
But having gone thus f~r-having made re-&#xD;
treat absolutely hopeless-Mrs. Gordon's courage&#xD;
failed. Woman-like, she looked at the man&#xD;
standing by with a glance that asked, "What&#xD;
must I say?"&#xD;
Mr. Warwick answered the glance quietly,&#xD;
almOSt sternly.&#xD;
"It is too late to hesitate now," he said~&#xD;
"Tell her."&#xD;
"Yes, tell me!" cried Katharine, clutching&#xD;

Kathterine when she opened her eyes and saw&#xD;
the dazzling glory spread before her.. With an&#xD;
impulse that startled her companion, she rose to&#xD;
her feet, and half turned toward. the dead man,&#xD;
on whose changeless face the glowing splendors&#xD;
fell. ,&#xD;
&#xD;
" Oh, who are we, to talk of forgiveness !',&#xD;
she said-and her voice, with a deep, pathetic&#xD;
thrill in it, fell strangely on the hushed calm-&#xD;
"is there any wrong so great that it is not easy&#xD;
to forgive it if we- only think of the dear Lord&#xD;
who will one day need to forgive us so much ?&#xD;
Can we harden our hearts over any thing, if&#xD;
we only remember that our free, generous, will-.&#xD;

life which has passed forever from our life,&#xD;

forgive him for ourselves, and for those he has&#xD;

They advanced to the couch, and side by side&#xD;
said the words together.&#xD;
As they uttered them, the sun rose, and, with&#xD;
the first flood of golden light, a myriad of birds&#xD;
burst forth into rejoicing. The night was past,&#xD;
the day was come. As the glory of the sunlight&#xD;
streamed over their bending figures, it seemed'&#xD;

like the earnest of a day of tranquil pence, after&#xD;

CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
,A TURN or FonTUNE's WHEEL.&#xD;
AW'EE after the double tragedy at Morton&#xD;
House, and while all Lagrange was still ringing&#xD;
with the noise of it, Miss Vernon walked across&#xD;
the lawn of her brother-in-law's residence with&#xD;
oton Annesley. '&#xD;
The young man was on his way to bring Fe-&#xD;
lx Gordon home, and had only stopped a few&#xD;
&#xD;
minutes to deliver a note and a message from&#xD;
Miss Tresham to her late kind entertainers.&#xD;
But, when he rose to make his adieux, he sud-&#xD;
denly recollected something else that he wished&#xD;
to say, and, much to Mrs. Raynor's regret, asked&#xD;
Miss Vernon to walk " down'to the bridge " with&#xD;
him. .Irene consented, and they weie soon on&#xD;
their way to that spot-a very favorite spot with&#xD;
every Aabitus of the place. The lawn was ex-&#xD;
ceedingly pretty now thatevery thing began to&#xD;
wear the light, silvery-green livery of early&#xD;
spring ; but the special charm of it, the special&#xD;
thing which made it different from other lawns,&#xD;
was the creek which flashed along under a fringe&#xD;
of willows and laurel, and the graceful bridge&#xD;
which was thrown across it. When they reached&#xD;
this spot, they paused-the bright water flowed&#xD;
beneath their feet, the soft shadows flickered&#xD;
overhead, and a lovely perspective of lawn and&#xD;
shrubbery opened behind them. On the other&#xD;
side of the stream-set, as it were, in an arch-&#xD;
way of green-a travelling-carriage with servants&#xD;
in attendance, and a trunk strapped on, was&#xD;
standing in the shade-the horses switching&#xD;
their tails leisurely, and the servants amicably&#xD;
gossiping. The whole sweet, spring wealth o~f&#xD;
tender beauty and indescribable charm was all&#xD;
around and all about them, until indeed one&#xD;
might have wondered&#xD;
".-how It was&#xD;
That any one, ir. such a world might grieve,&#xD;
At least for long, at what might come to pass;&#xD;
The soft south-wind, the flowers amid the grass,&#xD;
The fragrant earth, the sweetisounds everywhere&#xD;
Seemed gifts too great almost for mani to bear."&#xD;
The day was rapidly advancing toward its&#xD;
meridian, but .Annesley seemed in no haste to&#xD;
'begin his journey. Irene wondered a little at&#xD;
his -delay,. as, instead of saying (go4by, he&#xD;
stood before her, and looked and liedsed while&#xD;
she talked of Katharine.&#xD;
" I suppose there is no hope that Miss Tresh-&#xD;
am will return to us," she said, twisting the note&#xD;
which he had brought around her fingers..- "I&#xD;
am very sorry-we are all very sorry. We have&#xD;
missed her so much since she went away. She.&#xD;
is one of the most attractive and sympathetic&#xD;
persons I ever knew. George said only last night&#xD;
that he would be willing to go to school himself&#xD;
for the pleasure of securing her as a permanent,&#xD;
inmate."&#xD;
" Mrs. Gordon needs her more tlfan you do,"&#xD;
said Annesley, smiling a little. "Will not that&#xD;
console you ? Ah I you don't know all that she&#xD;
has passed through I"&#xD;

"How much like retribution it was!" m&#xD;
turned the young man, with a dark cloud comm,&#xD;
over his face. "I confess that my pity all ~ven&#xD;
with that poor fellow St. John," he said. "H&#xD;
was hardly used in every way. Miss Irene, did yo&#xD;
ever trace out a sequence of cause and effect?"&#xD;
"Never," she answered-then added, smiling&#xD;
"I am' like the lilies of the field, not worth mud&#xD;
either for toiling or reflecting."&#xD;
"You are like them in another respect &amp;amp;lso,'&#xD;
said he, pointing the compliment by the admi&#xD;
ration in his eyes as they lingered on her face,&#xD;
which was indeed like a lily in its stainless&#xD;
beauty. "But I am sure you have sometimes&#xD;
noticed the strange connection between events&#xD;
the strange manner in which circumstances seem&#xD;
to act and react on each other."&#xD;
"I assure you I never have. I eat my daily&#xD;
bread, and am thankful for it, without troubling&#xD;
myself to think that somebody must have sowed&#xD;
and reaped and garnered it yesterday. I remem-&#xD;
ber, however, that you on~ic suggested something&#xD;
of this kind-~about Mrs. Gordon."&#xD;
"It is a very fascinating occupation, when&#xD;
you once get fairly into the spirit of it," said he,&#xD;
~leaning against the railing of'the bridge.&#xD;
He could have stayed there all day, he&#xD;
thought, with 'the pretty music of the stream in&#xD;
his ears, and those wonderfulblue eyes gazing at&#xD;
him.. In the midst of his reflections, he forgot&#xD;
to thinkwhat a strange comment on this strange&#xD;
self-absorbed life of ours his very mood and the&#xD;
very tone of conversation made. The awful&#xD;
tragedy which had carried two souls into eter-&#xD;
nity, and wru~ig two living hearts with the bit-&#xD;
terness of death, had become a topic to be dis-&#xD;
cussed with, philosophical curiosity in the midst&#xD;
of a scen~ike this.&#xD;
"Tell me the facts as they really occurred,"&#xD;
said Miss Vernon, "that is, if I am not asking&#xD;
you to violate confidence."&#xD;
&#xD;
ss "No1"b e answered, gravely, "facts can harm&#xD;
nobody now. Indeed, there is so much exagger-&#xD;
le ation of them, that it is well the truth should be&#xD;
,u known."&#xD;
Then he began, and told her all that had oc-&#xD;
re curred-soon drifting by insensible degrees into&#xD;
more than the bare outline of events. Some-&#xD;
thing in the sympathetic face and honest eyes&#xD;
made him sure she could be trusted; and so,&#xD;
while the servants and horses waited as patiently&#xD;
ir or as impatiently as they could, while the water&#xD;
rippled, and the shadows flickered, he gave a&#xD;
~- sketch of the different causes that had led to&#xD;
this result. Her interest and astonishment were&#xD;
almost beyond power of expression. St. John&#xD;
g the son of Gordon! Katharine the step daugh-&#xD;
.t ter of Pauline Morton! Little as he felt inclined&#xD;
e for such a thing, Annosloy could almost have&#xD;
a laughed at the overwhelming surprise on her&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"It is true," he said. "My cousin tells me&#xD;
that the last assurance her husband gave her was&#xD;
of his first marriage, that St. John was his eldest&#xD;
son, and the heir of the Gordon estate."&#xD;
"And-and does Mrs. Gordon mean to make&#xD;
this public 1'"&#xD;
"No-making it public would involve too&#xD;
many painful disclosures. The horror of the&#xD;
tragedy would be doubly augmented, if people&#xD;
knew that a son (however ignorantly) had killed&#xD;
his own father. Besides, it is unnecessary. My&#xD;
* cousin is going to Scotland soon, and the affairs&#xD;
of her life matter nothing to the people she&#xD;
leaves behind-this time forever."&#xD;
"But Miss Tresham?"&#xD;
"Miss Tresham will accompany her."&#xD;
"Indeed!" Miss Vernon started a little.&#xD;
"I am surprised to hear that,'? she said, simply,&#xD;
almost involuntarily.&#xD;
"Why should you be surprised?" he asked.&#xD;
"Don't you think it is the natural thing and the&#xD;
right thing-on both sides?"&#xD;
"Yes-oh, yes, I "-she stopped, hesitated,&#xD;
blushed somewhat-" I was not thinking of that.&#xD;
I was thinking, if you will pardon my candor,&#xD;
Mr. Annesley, of you."&#xD;
"Of me!" said he, blushing himself; in the&#xD;
boyish fashion which he had never quite out-&#xD;
grown, yet smiling at her embarrassment. "And&#xD;
may I ask what you were thinking about me?"&#xD;
"I am sure you don't need to ask," answered&#xD;
she, with a direct frankness which some carping&#xD;
people called ?irusquerie. "Perhaps I have, no&#xD;
right to speak on such a subject, bu~ "-a win-&#xD;
ning smile, half-bright, half-soft-" my eveuse&#xD;
&#xD;
is,'that I should be very glad to see you both&#xD;
happy."&#xD;
"I hope we may both be happy," said he,&#xD;
earnestly. "But, dear ~tiss Irene, I think it will&#xD;
be apart-not together. Miss Tresham has re-&#xD;
jected me."&#xD;
"I never thought you lacked perseverance."&#xD;
"I don't think I do-when there is any thing&#xD;
to be gained by it. But you would not advise&#xD;
me to waste time and effort in a hopeless suit?&#xD;
Did you read the letter which Miss Tresham&#xD;
wrote to me the night before she left Belle-&#xD;
font?"&#xD;
"I! flow could I?" she asked, flushing.&#xD;
"What a strange opinion you must have of Miss&#xD;
Tresham if you think she would show such a&#xD;
letter; or of me, if you think I would read it l"&#xD;
"Don't be indignant!" said he, smiling.&#xD;
"You forget that Miss Tresham and yourself&#xD;
were in the same house, and good friends be-&#xD;
sides. There would have been nothing repre-&#xD;
hensible in her showing you the letter-nothing,&#xD;
certainly, that I should have been inclined to&#xD;
resent. It was a very charming letter," said he,&#xD;
with a slight grimace. "The only misfortune&#xD;
was, that I was not exactly in a frame of mind&#xD;
to appreciate this, when I received it. I read it&#xD;
over last night, and appreciated it better, I&#xD;
think. It is exceedingly kind, but very decided.&#xD;
I~ I had it here, I would show it to you, and ask&#xD;
you if you thought it worth while to persevere in&#xD;
the face of such a ~ as that."&#xD;
"You certainly take your disappointment&#xD;
very philosophically," said Miss Vernon, with a&#xD;
slight tinge of sarcasm in her voice.&#xD;
He changed color a little.&#xD;
"I hope you don't think that I take it&#xD;
lightly," he said. "I assure you it has been a&#xD;
very serious matter with me. I was as wretched&#xD;
down there in Apalatka, as-well, as anybody&#xD;
could possibly wish to be. But no man with&#xD;
any sense or self-respect will spend life pining&#xD;
and moaning because a woman has rejected him.&#xD;
I fought hard for resignation, and I think I may&#xD;
say that I have gained it."&#xD;
"You are resigned?"&#xD;
"I am quite resigned."&#xD;
Miss Vernon looked at him with an expres-&#xD;
sion' on her face which he did not understand-&#xD;
a mixture of half-puzzled surprise and struggling&#xD;
remembrance, which puzzled him in turn. She&#xD;
could not tell of what his tone and manner re-&#xD;
minded her, until, like a flash, she recalled the&#xD;
day when they had walked up and down the&#xD;
piazza at Anneadale, and he had spoken of Mrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Gordon, and of the content with life and the&#xD;
things of life which could be gained-so he said&#xD;
-by fighting for it. She remembered how she&#xD;
had questioned whether this philosophy of his-&#xD;
a buoyant, healthful philosophy, which, even in&#xD;
theory, had commanded her 'respect-would&#xD;
bear the test of disappointment or failure. Was&#xD;
her question being answered now? Was this,&#xD;
indeed, the content which is the victorious fruit&#xD;
of struggle, or was it only that mask of indiffer-&#xD;
ence which often betrays, instead of hiding, the&#xD;
deepest wound?&#xD;
"You astonish me," she said. "I had an&#xD;
idea-I really don't know why-that ~you were&#xD;
very constant, very tenacious, in your affections.&#xD;
This makes me think that I was mistaken in that&#xD;
opinion."&#xD;
He colored again, and looked at her with an&#xD;
expression which she, in turn, did not quite&#xD;
understand.&#xD;
"Won't you distinguish between constancy&#xD;
and obstinacy?" he asked. "I think there is&#xD;
a distinction. One may be constant to an affec-&#xD;
tion as long as there is hope of return; but,&#xD;
surely, it is the height of folly to hold obsti-&#xD;
nately to a sentiment which causes, and can&#xD;
cause, only pain. Don't you think it is desirable&#xD;
to control one passion as well as another-the&#xD;
passion of love, as well as the passion of anger&#xD;
or revenge? I won't pretend to tell you how&#xD;
much it has cost me to be able to say that I am&#xD;
resigned; but if you did know-if you could&#xD;
know-you would not, I am sure, accuse me of&#xD;
being inconstant or light."&#xD;
"I-I did not," said Miss Vernon, a little&#xD;
contritely. "The fact is, I am unreasonable,"&#xD;
she went on, half-laughing. "It would be diffi-&#xD;
cult to please me, I am afraid. Nobody would&#xD;
have been more sorry than I, if you had taken&#xD;
Miss Tresham's rejection to 'heart after the ap-&#xD;
proved romantic mode; and yet, you see, I find&#xD;
fault with you for showing yourself a seiisible&#xD;
young man of the nineteenth century. Desper-&#xD;
ate love has quite gone out of fashion,'? she&#xD;
said, with a shrug of her shoulders. "' Nowadays&#xD;
you are all so reasonable, that it is quite edify-&#xD;
ing. I have been wasting a good deal of sym-&#xD;
pathy on you; I see, now, that I must change it&#xD;
to respect."&#xD;
"And I see that you are determined to give&#xD;
me a liberal taste 'of mockery," he said. "I&#xD;
thought you would be more kind-more just."&#xD;
"Indeed, you are mistaken," she answered.&#xD;
"Indeed, I am glad, heartily glad; that I am able&#xD;
to change sympathy to respect. You must&#xD;

&#xD;
not think otherwise. I should be very sorry&#xD;
you were-were suffering."&#xD;
"Since I am not suffering, however, ye&#xD;
think I am able to bear a little sarcasm on m,&#xD;
unfortunate exemption,"&#xD;
"You ,are provoking!" she said. "Yoi&#xD;
know better, and I shall not reason with~ yoi&#xD;
any longer. Let me inquire if you have any in&#xD;
tension of reaching Sanford todayy"&#xD;
"There will not be the least difficulty in do&#xD;
ing so; the roads are excellent, and my horse~&#xD;
perfectly fresh. It is growing late, though," h&#xD;
said, with a regretful look at the shadows rounc&#xD;
him. "I suppose I ought to go-I suppose&#xD;
muSt go. Before doing so, however, I should&#xD;
like to convince you-"&#xD;
"Never mind," she interrupted, hastily; "1&#xD;
am quite convinced. Besides, it is not a matter&#xD;
of any importance. My opinion-"&#xD;
"Is of great importance to me," he said,&#xD;
eagerly. "I want to show you-I want to&#xD;
prove to you-that I am neither inconstant nor&#xD;
light."&#xD;
"That expression - which, by.the-way, I&#xD;
don't M all remember having used-seems to&#xD;
rankle with you!" she said, trying to laugh, yet&#xD;
feeling vaguely conscious that the scene was&#xD;
growing too earnest for her taste. "I don't&#xD;
mean to be inhospitable," she went on, "but I&#xD;
really think you ought to go; those poor ser-&#xD;
vants look so tired, and I fancy they are gazing&#xD;
reproachfully at me, thinking that I keep you."&#xD;
"They make a great mistake, then," he said,&#xD;
smiling; "for it is I who am keeping you-un-&#xD;
willingly enough on your part, as I perceive. It&#xD;
is amazingly hard to go. This is certainly the&#xD;
pleasantest and prettiest spot in Lagrange. I&#xD;
wish I was an artist; ,I would paint you as you&#xD;
stand there now.  'he whole scene is lovely, and&#xD;
you-~-.pardon me, if I say so-never looked more&#xD;
beautlful.~r&#xD;
"You are not an artist, though, and I am not&#xD;
standing for my portrait," answered Miss Ver-&#xD;
non, turning away. "I see I must make the first&#xD;
move," she went on. "I hope you will have a&#xD;
pleasant journey. Good-by."&#xD;
He followed her, and held out his hand. "If&#xD;
[am obliged to go, at least you must tell me&#xD;
good-by alter a more cordial fashion," he said.&#xD;
"I shall be back soon. Shall I find you still&#xD;
here?"&#xD;
She gave him her hand and smiled. "Very&#xD;
probably you will," she said-.~-" unless George&#xD;
becomes more amiable than he is at present,&#xD;
about letting Flora go. Give wy love to the&#xD;
&#xD;
f Lesters if you see them in Apalatha," she added.&#xD;
",Once more, good-by."&#xD;
u This time he echoed her farewell, and took&#xD;
y his departure. But long after he had left the&#xD;
pretty lawn, and silvery creek behind, her fair&#xD;
i face, her tender eyes, her bright smile bore him&#xD;
Li company. Try as he would, he could think of-&#xD;
he could see nothing else. "How beautiful she&#xD;
is!" he caught himself saying again and egain.&#xD;
- Yet something told him that her beauty was the&#xD;
least part of her, that the regular features, the&#xD;
my-white complexion, the golden hair, and violet&#xD;
I eyes, would have been worth little indeed with-&#xD;
out the brave, noble soul, the strong, sweet na-&#xD;
I ture, which shone through these outer coverings,&#xD;
and glorified them, "like the lamp of naphtha in&#xD;
the alabaster vase." He had only lately learned&#xD;
to know this. Until within the last few months,&#xD;
Irene Vernon had been to him a woman merely&#xD;
like ether women-a girl like the maJority of&#xD;
girls, only a little less attractive, perhaps, on ac-&#xD;
count of her haughty beauty. Now an in-&#xD;
stinct begun to dawn upon him that hence-&#xD;
forth in his life she was to be set apart from&#xD;
all other women. The memory of his fevered&#xD;
passion for Katharine seemed to fade away.&#xD;
That graceful figure, that exquisite face, still&#xD;
stood there on the bridge, with the l~right water&#xD;
flowing beneath, the tender green of earth's re-&#xD;
newed life all around, and heart, and hope, and&#xD;
fancy, seemed to bow down before her and say,&#xD;
"Lo!we are thine!"&#xD;
Two weeks after this, Mrs. Gordon's prepa-&#xD;
rations for leaving America were so nearly com-&#xD;
pleted that the day of her departure was fixed,&#xD;
and not far distant. Feli~ was once more at&#xD;
home, and all that now detained her in La-&#xD;
grange was the final disposition of the Morton&#xD;
property, and its transfer to Annesley. The&#xD;
house which his mother had so long coveted&#xD;
for him was at last to be his, through the kind-&#xD;
ness of the very woman whose arrival had&#xD;
caused Mrs. Annesley so much of bitter heart-&#xD;
ache, so many fruitless schemes and plans.&#xD;
Where were they all now ?-.what end had they&#xD;
gained? Morton, with his loyal honesty, had&#xD;
seen the straight path and followed it; while&#xD;
she had wandered off into dark and devious by-&#xD;
ways. And, after all, it was Morton, not she,&#xD;
who won at last the prize on which her heart&#xD;
had been set. Did the perception of this teach&#xD;
her wisdom? Doubtful, indeed. Few things&#xD;
are more rare, thin that the eye once accustomed&#xD;
to darkness should learn to love the light; than&#xD;
&#xD;
that the nature which finds pleasure in bidden&#xD;
paths, should learn that plain roads lead best&#xD;
to plain ends, and that open weapons are more&#xD;
effective, as well as more honorable, than con-&#xD;
cealed and stealthy ones. Still, Mrs. Annesley&#xD;
was heartily glad of this auspicious end, and, in&#xD;
her own way, felt a little ashamed of herself.&#xD;
"I should have tried to do more ror Pauline, if I&#xD;
had only known," she said-and that was the&#xD;
whole secret of it If she had only known-if&#xD;
she had only been aware that something was to be&#xD;
gained by cousinly kindness and championship,&#xD;
she would have buckled onher armor and entered&#xD;
the lists as fearlessly as Morton himself; but, as&#xD;
it was, why should she have been expected to do&#xD;
such a thing? "I had my children to think of,"&#xD;
she would say, "and we werenever fond of each&#xD;
other at the best of times." Every thing had&#xD;
turned out very well, and she was glad of it; but&#xD;
she could really see no cause for blaming herself&#xD;
in any thing she had done, or failed to do, al-&#xD;
though-well-yes-she might, perhaps, have&#xD;
been a little more cordial to Pauline.&#xD;
As to Lagrange, it was thunderstruck by the&#xD;
news of Mrs. Gordon's impending departure, and&#xD;
by the rumor- tenfold exaggerated- of her&#xD;
wealth and rank, And this was the woman who&#xD;
had lived in their midst for six months, whom&#xD;
they had persistently ignored, and about whom&#xD;
they had circulated any number of ill-natured&#xD;
reports. A Morton, too! The last direct repre-&#xD;
sentative of the oldest blood in the country!&#xD;
What could they have been thinking of!-La-&#xD;
grange waked up, as it were, from a sort of&#xD;
trance, and felt, in a measure, half-dazed, and&#xD;
totally unable to account for its own conduct.&#xD;
One thing was certain, however: Mrs. Gordon&#xD;
must see her old friends-and, what was consid-&#xD;
erably more important, her old friends must see&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon !-once more, at least, before she&#xD;
bade a final farewell to the home of her youth.&#xD;
The door of Morton House was suddenly be-&#xD;
sieged with visitors, and Harrrison grew weary&#xD;
of receiving cards, and saying, over and over&#xD;
again, that Mrs. Gordon begged to be excused&#xD;
from seeing company-she was preparing for her&#xD;
departure, and was, besides, not very well. Only&#xD;
the few friends who had come forward to wel-&#xD;
come her, were admitted to say farewell be-&#xD;
fore the wanderer once more turned her face&#xD;
-this time forever-from her father's house.&#xD;
These few were struck by a singular change&#xD;
in her appearance. They had expected to see&#xD;
her looking much older, much more broken&#xD;
by the late terrible scenes through which she&#xD;
&#xD;
had passed; yet fragile, and pale, and worn as&#xD;
she was, underneath all this there was some-&#xD;
thing which had not been there before-a&#xD;
glimpse of the Pauline Morton of old coming&#xD;
out under the ghastly change wrought by years&#xD;
and trouble, a possibility of reviving power&#xD;
which no eye could have been keen enough to&#xD;
see before. The worst part of the change which&#xD;
had so shocked her friends was gone from her.&#xD;
She was even yet a woman on whom the signet&#xD;
of fiery trials had been branded too deeply ever&#xD;
to fade; but she was no longer a woman resting&#xD;
helplessly under the torturing, haunting dread&#xD;
of a terror that might come to her any day or&#xD;
hour. Peace at least was hers at last, and the&#xD;
seal of peace-the promise of the calmer life&#xD;
upon which she was entering-was plainly to be&#xD;
read upon her face.&#xD;
"In time, perhaps, you may even teach me&#xD;
to be happy," she would say, wistfully, to Kath-&#xD;
arine.&#xD;
And, indeed, the thing which seemed to giv'e&#xD;
her most pleasure was the thought of this bright&#xD;
and gentle companion whom she had won, this&#xD;
girl who all her life long had managed to find&#xD;
some pearls of happiness under the stormiest&#xD;
water.&#xD;
Katharine, for her part, made her prepara-&#xD;
tions to leave Lagrange with a reluctance that&#xD;
surprised herself. She did not understand the&#xD;
intangible sadness and regret which oppressed&#xD;
her-she often asked herself what it meant-she&#xD;
often wondered why a dimness should come over&#xD;
her sight, and a choking rise in her throat when&#xD;
she looked out over the fair hills and woods&#xD;
clothed in their lovely April green, and thought&#xD;
how soon she would leave them, never to return.&#xD;
"Why should I care so much?" she would&#xD;
ask herself, half indignantly. "It is no native&#xD;
home of mine-it is not as if I'had been born&#xD;
and reared here! Then, indeed, it might be hard&#xD;
to go; but now, I do not understand it., Why&#xD;
should I care so much?" A little while Inter it&#xD;
was all so clear to her that she could have&#xD;
laughed at the remembrance of her own per-&#xD;
plexity; but that was a little while later. At&#xD;
the time of which we speak, no o~ ld have&#xD;
suspected her hidden sadness, her notable&#xD;
reluctance; but, all the same, it cxli lithe&#xD;
same, she would move about the roe 4 gal-&#xD;
leries, and gardens, of Morton House, i~rlghteii-&#xD;
ing and cheering every spot to which she came,&#xD;
but deplorably conscious, meanwhile, of a very&#xD;
heavy heart, and asking herself~ in puzzled hon-&#xD;
esty, what it possibly meant.&#xD;
&#xD;

MORTON HOUSE.                                                         A TURN OF FORTUNE'S WHEEL.               265&#xD;
&#xD;
At last the day of departure drew near&#xD;
hand. They were to leave on Tuesday mcmii&#xD;
On Monday afternoon a heavy shower of ma&#xD;
was falling; but Katharine wrapped herself&#xD;
in a large cloak, and, armed with an umbrel]&#xD;
set forth to pay a farewell visit to Mrs. Marl~&#xD;
Mrs. Gordon was somewhat shocked, memo&#xD;
stated, and insisted upon ordering the earring&#xD;
but the girl obstinately declined.&#xD;
"I much prefer to walk," she said. "I don&#xD;
mind a rain like this, and it looks as if it migl&#xD;
clear. I can stay as long as I please if I wall&#xD;
you know; and then "-a slight quiver of ti&#xD;
voice here-" it is for the last time."&#xD;
So Mrs. Marks, who felt sufficiently dolefu&#xD;
and had entirely given up all hope of the pron&#xD;
ised visit, was equally astonished and delight&#xD;
when there came a shout from the children o&#xD;
the front piazza, and ahe next minute a drenched&#xD;
apparition of Katharine, with glowing cheek&#xD;
and rain-gemmed hair, walked in upon her.&#xD;
"So you have come!" she cried, joyfully&#xD;
"Oh, I am so glad! I didn't look for you at al&#xD;
after it began to rain."&#xD;
"And you thought an April shower like thi~&#xD;
would keep me away from you, when it is for th&#xD;
last time?" said Katharine, dropping her we~&#xD;
wrappings in the middle of the floor. "Yot&#xD;
must have given me credit for wanting to se&#xD;
you very badly-mustn't she, children ?-Katy~&#xD;
my shoes are quite damp. Can you take theix&#xD;
into the kitchen to dry, and get me a pair of&#xD;
your mother's slippers to wear?"&#xD;
While Katy eagerly darted away on this er-&#xD;
rand, the other children crowded around the&#xD;
young ex-govemness, and drew her into a chair.&#xD;
What an afternoon it was that followed! There&#xD;
~ was so much to say, so much to tell of the past,&#xD;
so much to promise of the future, that the won-&#xD;
der was how it all was said, even in the three or&#xD;
four hours which were consumed.'&#xD;
Katharine made several fruitless attempts to&#xD;
leave before she rose at last and said that she&#xD;
must go.&#xD;
am afraid it will be dusk 'before I can&#xD;
reach the house," she said, "and Mrs. Gordon&#xD;
will be, uneasy.-No, no, children, don't do that"&#xD;
-as several ~.udible sobs were heard-" this is&#xD;
not good-by. Thu must not think so. Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon, and Felix, and I, are all going to stop to&#xD;
see 'you to-morrow morning."&#xD;
It may not have been "good-by," but still it&#xD;
was a very lugubrious~ leave-taking. Mrs. Marks&#xD;
broke down as well as the children, and Kath-&#xD;
arine herself was on the brink of tears when&#xD;
&#xD;
at she left the sobbing group behind, and hurried&#xD;
1g. along the front walk. These tears were blinding&#xD;
in her to such an extent that she did not recognize&#xD;
ip -she did not even see-a man who had reached&#xD;
a, the gate as she came out of the house, and stood&#xD;
a. there waiting for her.&#xD;
n- "Good-evening, Miss Tresham," he said; as&#xD;
~; she fumbled for the latch, and his voice, which&#xD;
was very unexpected, made her start violently.&#xD;
.'t "Are you going to Morton House?"&#xD;
~t "Good - evening, Mr. Warwick," she an-&#xD;
k, swered, as the gate at last yielded, not to her&#xD;
~e touch, but to Mr. Warwick's, and she came out&#xD;
into the road. "Yes, I am going to Morton&#xD;
1, House. I have been spending the afternoon with&#xD;
1- Mrs. Marks," she added, looking up at him with&#xD;
d her brimming eyes.&#xD;
n "I think you came very near spending the&#xD;
d evening also," he said, smiling. She caught the&#xD;
s smile, and it made her feel aggrieved. She did&#xD;
not, of course, expect him to be in tears like&#xD;
Mrs. Marks, and the children, and herself, but&#xD;
I still he might have felt the solemnity of the oc-&#xD;
casion a little, and he need not have, smiled in&#xD;
3 that way, just as if nothing more than usual had&#xD;
happened or was about to happen. "You are&#xD;
late for such a lonely walk," he said. "Give me&#xD;
your umbrella. I will see you safely to the&#xD;
house."&#xD;
"Indeed, you need not take that trouble,"&#xD;
she said, with a shade of coolness in her tone.&#xD;
"It is not very late," she went on. "The road&#xD;
may be lonely, but it is entirely safe, and I had&#xD;
much rather you did not."&#xD;
Her speech was cut short very summarily.&#xD;
Mr. Warwick took the umbrella out of her hand,&#xD;
and held it over her head, as he walked along&#xD;
the foot-path by her side.&#xD;
"I am sorry if you would 'much rather'&#xD;
I did not accompany you," be said; "but I&#xD;
cannot reconcile it to my conscience to let you&#xD;
go alone into the country at such an hour as this.&#xD;
Besides, if you must know the truth, I was on&#xD;
my way to Morton House when I saw you; so&#xD;
the only difference is, whether I shall go alone or&#xD;
with a companion."&#xD;
"In that case, I am very glad that you&#xD;
chanced to see me," said Katharine, conquering&#xD;
her momentary grievance. "I need a compan-&#xD;
ion," she went on, a little sadly. "My frame&#xD;
'of mind is any thingbut cheerful. Oh, how hard&#xD;
it is to say good-by to people that one loves!"&#xD;
"Yes," said he, with something of uncon-&#xD;
scious dreariness in his voice, "it is hard."&#xD;
Nothing more was spoken for some time.&#xD;
&#xD;
MORTON HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
They walked along, side by side, and both so&#xD;
much abstracted that they scarcely noticed how&#xD;
the rain had ceased, and the sun, which was not&#xD;
yet down, seemed about to break through the west.&#xD;
era clouds. They were by this time fairly beyond&#xD;
the last outskirts of the town, and the sweet,&#xD;
wild odors of forest and field-the peculiar spicy&#xD;
woodland fragrance which loads the very air&#xD;
after a spring rain-wereborne to them byovery&#xD;
breeze that, in passing, shook myriads of glit.&#xD;
tearing rain-drops from the boughs under which&#xD;
they walked. Katharine laughed a little as one&#xD;
of these quick showers sprinkled her face.&#xD;
"The very trees are 'weeping," she said. "I&#xD;
wonder if I may flatter myself that they, too,&#xD;
are sorry to see me go? How fresh and fragrant&#xD;
every thing is! Surely there is no month like&#xD;
April; and yet it seems to me that, after this,&#xD;
April will always be sad to me."&#xD;
"You are like a child who thinks today's&#xD;
clouds will not be gone to-morrow," said Mr.&#xD;
Warwick, smiling again; but this time in a man.&#xD;
ncr with which she was not inclined to find fault.&#xD;
"Is it possible that you do not know that before&#xD;
another April comes round Lagrange will seem&#xD;
to you like a dull and painful memory? By that&#xD;
time you will wonder how you ever endured such&#xD;
a life as this, from which you are now sorry to&#xD;
part."&#xD;
"You think so because you don't know me,"&#xD;
she said, a little resentfully. "Whatever else I&#xD;
may be, I am not fickle nor ungrateful. I love La-&#xD;
grange now, and I shall love it always. If I&#xD;
live to see a hundred Aprils come, I shall always&#xD;
think of this one, and-and be sorry."&#xD;
"Sorry to have left poverty and toil behind&#xD;
you, and gone to ease, and luxury, and happi-&#xD;
ness?"&#xD;
"No, sorry to have left so much kindness&#xD;
and so many dear friends behind me-kindness&#xD;
shown to me in the days of my need; friends&#xD;
who proved their friendship when I was desolate.&#xD;
0 Mr. Warwick! you do not really believe that I&#xD;
can ever forget these things?"&#xD;
"No," said Mr. Warwick, touched by her&#xD;
earnestness. "I do not believe any thing un-&#xD;
worthy of you. I am sure that, go where you&#xD;
will, you will retain a kindly remembrance of us,&#xD;
and that, perhaps, is as much as we could ask."&#xD;
"I shall always think of you as the best&#xD;
friend I have ever known," she said. "I-I&#xD;
cannot say good-by without thanking you once&#xD;
more for all your kindnesses to me-they have&#xD;
been so many, so great."&#xD;
"Don't call them kindnesses," he said,&#xD;
&#xD;
hastily. "They were not that - they were&#xD;
pleasures to me, and I was only glad that they&#xD;
were also services to you. I-"&#xD;
He stopped. What he was on the point of&#xD;
saying, he scarcely knew; but an instinct warned&#xD;
him that iLwas something which had better be&#xD;
left unsaid. He was a self-contained man, well&#xD;
accustomed to controlling himself on all possi-&#xD;
ble occasions; so he bad very little difficulty in&#xD;
restraining words which he told himself could&#xD;
serve no good end. Why distress and pain her&#xD;
uselessly ?-why give her a last disagreeable&#xD;
memory of him to take away? What folly it&#xD;
was, after all! She had unhesitatingly rejected&#xD;
him when she was poor and desolate, without a&#xD;
home on earth; and was it likely-was it even&#xD;
possible-that she would reconsider that deci-&#xD;
sion now, that she would turn from the brilliant&#xD;
future which opened before her, to share his&#xD;
homely, commonplace life? He gave a sort of&#xD;
mental laugh-a laugh singularly devoid of&#xD;
merriment-at The very thought.&#xD;
"Is not this the view of which you are so&#xD;
fond?" he asked, pausing abruptly on a knoll&#xD;
which they had reached, a gentle emineiioe that&#xD;
commanded a prospect of the surrounding coun-&#xD;
try-of all the fields and meadows clad in bright.&#xD;
cat green; of the hedges in full blossom; of&#xD;
groups of trees near by, with feathery, tended~&#xD;
foliage; of shadowy woodlands far away; of hill~&#xD;
melting and stretching in graceful undulations to&#xD;
the cast. Toward the west there was an cx-&#xD;
panse of open ~country, and the sun (which had&#xD;
now come forth) was gilding all things with the&#xD;
red glory of sunset, turning all the rain-drops&#xD;
into diamonds, and all the little rain-pools into&#xD;
miniature fiery lakes.&#xD;
"Yes, this is the view," said Katharine.&#xD;
"Is it not lovely ?"&#xD;
She stood quite still,, and looked with linger.&#xD;
ing, pathetic' gaze on the fair scene. The light&#xD;
of the glowing western sky was on her face and&#xD;
in her eyes-soft; sweet eyes, that were none the&#xD;
less lovely for the tears that filed them.&#xD;
"It is 'hard~ to leave," she said at last, sim-&#xD;
ply, and almost as if ahe were thinking aloud.&#xD;
Those words, and the tone in which they&#xD;
were uttered, were too much for the man beside&#xD;
her. After all, what did it matter? He could&#xD;
only hear again what he had heard before-he&#xD;
could only receive the answer which was, of&#xD;
course, the sole possible answer for a question&#xD;
such as his. Still he would ask it. He could do&#xD;
no harm, at least; arid a strange, wild hope--&#xD;
which he sternly tried to 'repress-rushed over&#xD;

warning~i The struggle with himself oc&#xD;
a minute. During that minute, the sun&#xD;
sank out of sight, and Katharine, with a'&#xD;
sigh, turned her face around.&#xD;
"Perhaps we had better go," she&#xD;
"Mrs. Gordon will be uneasy."&#xD;
"We will go in a second," he axis&#xD;
quietly-so quietly that she had not the f~&#xD;
suspicion of what was coming. "You en&#xD;
hard to leave," he went on. "Has it e,&#xD;
curred to you that there is a very easy v&#xD;
remaining? I suppose it is worse than fo&#xD;
me to ask such a question, but do you Ii&#xD;
grange well enough to give up all this&#xD;

LOTHAIR..&#xD;
A Novel.&#xD;
By the Right Hono~rab1e BENJAMIN DISRAELI,&#xD;
Late Prlxne Jl~1ulster of Great Britain.                    -&#xD;
"N6sae lime omnnia salus est adolescdntulis"-TERENTIus.&#xD;
After a silence of twenty-three years (his last work, "Tancred," waspublished in 1841) this&#xD;
eminent English novelist reappears with a work in his best style. "Lothair" has all the&#xD;
erlillaut wit, the keen and sparkling satire, and the refined grace, of the most popular of&#xD;
Its predecessors. It deals with current topiCs of the deepest interest-with Feu~nis~,&#xD;
Ritualism, the Catholic Question, the Intrigues of the Jesuits, etc., etc.&#xD;
~IOTIOES OF' THE PliliSS.&#xD;
"There Is not a fast character, a fast trait, or a fast phrase, in the whole of' Lothair,' yet&#xD;
the story is a story of yesterday-almost ef to-day-and comes fresh and warm from the au-&#xD;
thor's study. . . 'Lothair' will be read by the whole world, will provoke immense dis.&#xD;
eusslon, and will greatly deepen the Interest with which the author's own character, genius,&#xD;
and career, have long been contemplated by the nation"-Londtm Dall~y News.&#xD;
"'Lotheir' gives proof of rare originality, versatility, flexibility, force and freshness. One&#xD;
over lbs merits of-a novel so pre~ant with thought and character, nor would&#xD;
we wish fodo1norewere It possible. We should be very sorry to weaken the interest that&#xD;
must accompany the perusa of the book. We had thought Mr. Disraeli dared a great deal&#xD;
in risking his reputation on another novel, but now that we have read it we do not feel called&#xD;
upon to pay him many compliments on his courage. As he wrote he must have felt that&#xD;
the risk was Illusory, and assured himself that his powers had brightened instead of rusting&#xD;
In haIfa lifetime of repose."-Loszdon Times.&#xD;
"As a series of brilliant sketches of character, with occasional digressions Into abstract&#xD;
and speculative topics, 'Lothair' need not fear comparison with the most sparkling of Its&#xD;
author's previous works."-.Losufon OOserves-.&#xD;
"Nothin of the original t~erue of Mr. Disraeli's style has been lost by the lapse of years.&#xD;
Fresh as 'Coningaby,' vigorous as 'Vivian Grey,' tender as 'Renrietta Ternplo, enthralling&#xD;
as 'Tanered,' humorous as any of his former works, 'Lothair,' apart from the Interest attach-&#xD;
ing to It ~n account of the position of Its author, would be the literary success of the season."&#xD;
-London Standarct.&#xD;
"As a literary production the new story is all that the admirers of 'Vivian Grey' could&#xD;
have wished. The deft hand has lostnone of Its cunning. The wealth of glowing description,&#xD;
whose richness becomes at times almost a painful enjoyment, the keen satire, the sparkling&#xD;
epigram, the wonderful sketches of society, the airy skimmin" over the surface of life,&#xD;
touching upon Its fashionable graces, laughing a little at its fash'?onable follies-all are here&#xD;
as we kuew them of old. The brightness. Is undimmed and the spirit Is unsnbdued."-N~w&#xD;
