            <head type="sub">BY THE EDITOR.</head>
            <p>IT was in the summer of 1856, while engaged in a humanitarian tour of the river
               districts, that I met with the unfortunate man whose story, given in his own
               language, is related in the following pages. I found him in a deplorable condition,
               both of mind and body. The squalid room which he occupied was at the top of an old
               building in a narrow lane leading from the Bowling Green to Greenwich street. Its
               broken roof admitted the rains freely, and the filthy rags that constituted his bed,
               were reeking with puddled water which covered the floor. He was entirely friendless
               and neglected; and would have been thrown into the street by the landlord or agent,
               who kept a sailor's drinking place below, if his delirious situation had not
               precluded removal. Though familiar with scenes of suffering, so common in the
               degraded localities which hide, if they do not shelter, the poor of New York city, I
               could not but be shocked at the extreme desolation presented in this instance. The
               last ravages of consumption<pb n="iv-v" xml:id="VAC6322-00000005"/> tion combined
               with torture of mind to render their subject a deplorable ruin of humanity. Grey
               haired, with nearly seventy winters, and wasted almost to a skeleton, he seemed the
               naked type of outcast poverty; and yet there was something about his very destitution
               of friends and sympathy which, from the first, attracted my interest.</p>
            <p>The mental state of this old man was worse, if possible, than his bodily condition;
               for, in his feverish ravings, he blasphemed and threatened alternately all who
               approached him; and uttered incoherent words that indicated a conscience afflicted
               with remorse for crimes committed in his past life. I gathered enough from broken
               sentences to learn that he had been engaged in the SLAVE TRADE, and my feelings were
               at once pained and interested by the unhappy sufferer's despairing wretchedness. With
               an assurance to his landlord that I would be responsible for the cost, I obtained a
               promise of some little attention to the apartment, and took measures for procuring
               food and medicine, for want of which the invalid was perishing.</p>
            <p>I need not enter into a history of the three months that intervened between my first
               knowledge of Philip Drake and his passage to another and I hope a better life. Let is
               suffice that I succeeded in interesting him as he interested me, and that the
               narrative which follows is an authentic record, as far as I can judge. It is simple,
               and, I believe truthful; and, though disclosing enormities almost beyond belief, does
               not, I am sure, exaggerate the horrors of that dreadful Traffic to which the man's
               whole life had been sacrificed. Though the blood curdles at such atrocities as are
               here related, there is, unhappily, too much evidence to corroborate the facts; and we
               are fain to turn from the sickening recital, with Cowper's eloquent lines upon our
               lips, applied to <q>

            <p>The story of Philip Drake is but one of a thousand similar records of wickedness
               which the Slave Trade of our day<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC6322-00000006"/> might
               furnish. From all that transpired between myself and the dying man, from intimations
               and disclosures of <emph>names, places,</emph> and <emph>dates,</emph> that leave no
               doubt in my mind of the accuracy of his statements, I am convinced that the traffic
               is at this time carried on under circumstances of barbarity and recklessness which
               disgrace both civilization and Christianity And when statements like the following,
               which I quote, are now so common as to be considered only every-day items of news, I
               think it full time that the disclosures which are made in this autobiography should
               be brought before a civilized and Christian public, as a reminder of its duty to
               humanity:</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Mobile 'Mercury' of the 22d July, 1860, says: "Some negroes who never learned
                  to talk English, went up the railroad the other day. They did not get aboard at
                  Mobile, but somewhere up in the piney woods country. It is not necessary to
                  mention the particular place. There were twenty-five of them, apparently all of
                  the pure, unadulterated African stock. Their destination is unknown. They may have
                  been bound for Enterprise, to supply a demand which existed in that market some
                  while ago for full-blooded African slaves, as per advertisement of sundry
                  gentlemen up there, offering to buy such at a certain price. They were in charge
                  of one who knows how to buy and sell negroes."</p>
               <p>The New Orleans "Picayune" of the 27th, remarks that "It is believed that the
                  slaver lately burned off the coast of Cuba, whose crew were a few days since
                  brought into Key West, was the bark Sultana, Capt. Bowen, which cleared at New
                  York, the 26th of January, for Rio Zaire and a market. She was sold in December,
                  1859, for $15,000, to a foreign firm in New York, for a Havana house. She was
                  fitted out at the foot of Fourth street, East River. It is said that she landed
                  some 1,200 to 1,300 negroes in Cuba before she was burned.</p>
               <p>"A 'Congo Club,' being in favor of <emph>reopening the slave-trade,</emph> has
                  been organized at Port Gibson, Miss. T. G. Humphreys has been elected President,
                  and Rufus Shoemaker Secretary."</p>
            </q>
            <p>An account, dated <hi rend="i"/>Nassau, N. P., July 28, 1860, alludes to the last
               slave vessel overhauled on our coast:</p>
            <q>
               <p>"A not very large schooner, supposed to be American, struck on the back of Lanyard
                  or Little Harbor Bay, Abaco, on Wednesday night last, and went to pieces. The
                  people from Cherokee Sound found the wreck and saved 360 Africans, who, as just
                  reported, are here. Some were drowned, some died from lassitude, and some of the
                  crew were also drowned. Of these latter who were saved, all appear to be Spaniards
                  or Portuguese, two of whom speak English; but among the blacks appears an
                  intelligent fellow, dressed, who speaks Spanish, and is evidently a decoy duck,
                  used by the traders.</p>
               <p>"The condition of the Africans is anything but pleasing; they appear to have
                  scurvy and ophthalmia, and seem to be half starved. Men, boys and girls (there are
                  no women) are all perfectly naked. The original captain had cut his throat and
                  jumped overboard before the vessel struck."</p>
            </q>
            <p>The following, from the N. Y. "Herald" of August 5, 1860, gives a hint concerning our
               method of importation:</p>
            <q>
               <p>"Padre Island, or rather Father Island, is called so, from being the largest of a
                  number of similar islands along the Gulf coast of Texas, and is about a hundred
                  and twenty-five miles long, by from one to two miles in width. It is an island,
                  because between it and the main shore of Texas there exists a regular belt or
                  estuary of the sea, extending from the harbor of Brazos Santiago to Corpus
                  Christi. Its adaptability has made Padre Island a resort for the initiation of
                  those measures which were necessary in order to make popular a matter of vital
                  importance to the South. To have boldly ventured into New Orleans, with negroes
                  freshly imported from Africa, would not only have brought down upon the head of
                  the importer the vengeance of our very philanthropic Uncle Sam, but also the
                  anathemas of the whole sect of philanthropists and negrophilists everywhere. To
                  import them for years, however, into quiet places, evading with impunity the
                  penalty of the law, and the ranting of the thin-skinned sympathizers with Africa,
                  was gradually to popularize the traffic by creating a demand for laborers, and
                  thus to pave the way for the GRADUAL REVIVAL OF THE SLAVE TRADE.</p>
               <pb n="viii-ix (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC6322-00000007"/>
               <p>"To this end, a few men, bold and energetic, determined, ten or twelve years ago,
                  to commence the business of importing negroes, slowly at first, but surely; and
                  for this purpose they selected a few secluded places on the coast of Florida,
                  Georgia and Texas, for the purpose of concealing their stock until it could be
                  sold out. Without specifying other places, let me draw your attention to a deep
                  and abrupt pocket or indentation in the coast of Texas, about thirty miles from
                  Brazos Santiago. Into this pocket a slaver could run at any hour of the night,
                  because there was no hindrance at the entrance, and here she could discharge her
                  cargo of movables upon the projecting bluff, and again proceed to sea inside of
                  three hours. The live stock thus landed could be marched a short distance across
                  the main island, over a porous soil which refuses to retain the recent
                  foot-prints, until they were again placed in boats, and were concealed upon some
                  of the innumerable little islands which thicken on the waters of the Laguna in the
                  rear. These islands, being covered with a thick growth of bushes and grass, offer
                  an inscrutable hiding place for the 'black diamonds.'"</p>
            </q>
            <p>That the experience of one repentant slaver, as given in Philip Drake's narrative,
               may have some influence in directing public scrutiny into the implication of our
               country with the worst horrors of Slave Trading, I heartily hope and pray. The poor,
               misguided being whose confession I here present, is now at rest; and his last hours,
               I may remark, were soothed by an earnest confidence in the mercy of our Almighty
               Father. Whatever were his errors, I trust they are atoned for by his contrition; and
               in placing his autobiography before the world, let me be permitted to share his last
               wish—that this faithful record may serve some good purpose, in calling attention to
               the Crimes of the Slave Trade.</p>

                  <p>My Orphanage—Stockford Workhouse—Life in a Mill—My Uncle's Visit—Experiences in
                     Moss-picking—Sickness and a new Friend—I am shipped off.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I NEVER saw my father. He was a seafaring man, sailing as mate of a coaster. He
                  was lost in a gale four months after his marriage with my mother, who was the
                  daughter of a spinner in one of the cotton-mills of my native town of Stockford,
                  England. My mother's father was more than an ordinary laborer; for I have heard
                  said that he invented a method of making colored velvets, that turned out very
                  profitably to his employers, though he, poor man, was never benefited by it.</p>
               <p>My earliest recollections are of a pale-faced, melancholy little woman, propped up
                  in bed, who used to hold me in her slender arms, and kiss me, with tears in her
                  eyes. Afterward, I remember a room full of strange people, a red box, and a man
                  standing beside it, talking in a loud voice; then a dismal walk through the rain,
                  to a field where some men were digging a hole. God help me! I could not then
                  realize that I looked upon a grave; that it was my mother's, and that I was an
                  orphan.</p>
               <p>I could not have been more than four years of age when that event took place, but
                  I soon commenced the experience of a friendless orphan's lot in life. Some of that
                  experience is as fresh in my mind now, when I can reckon sixty-nine years, as if
                  it were only of yesterday. Many bitter incidents, many persecutions and wrongs,
                  could I recall, if I were writing these pages for effect, or to gain sympathy. I
                  might count the days of my boyish existence, like the steps of a hard journey over
                  a lonesome road. Often, in the course of my rovings, I have heard comrades or
                  acquaintances wish themselves children again; but I can say with truth, I never
                  felt such a desire in my worst times. A neglected orphan can have very few early
                  pleasures to regret.</p>
               <p>To make a long story short, I will only remark that I lost my best friend when my
                  poor mother died, and left me a charge to the parish. It would do no good at this
                  time to narrate all that I endured for the five years that I spent in Stockford
                  workhouse. I was a sickly child, and knocked about by everybody, till at ten years
                  I was sent to the mill to be a <emph>piecer,</emph> as my grandfather had been a
                     <emph>spinner</emph> of the cotton. Here, for two years, I learned what it was
                  to stand on my feeble little legs, during sixteen, and sometimes eighteen hours in
                  twenty-four. Often, when I sunk under the task, completely beaten out, I had my
                  faculties roused up quickly by a savage box on the ear, or a<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000010"/> kick, if I happened to fall down. I was obliged to
                  tie up the threads, with my eyes blinded by tears, and my poor head dizzy enough,
                  till one night I gave out completely, and had to be packed off to the workhouse
                  again. Here I nearly died of a lingering fever.</p>
               <p>My pride, if I have any left, might induce me to conceal these circumstances of my
                  humble youth. But what has a dying man to do with pride? I have had enough of it
                  in the world, with plenty of shame and guilt, too, as my story must reveal. If
                  this early poverty were the only subject of uneasiness to be remembered, it would
                  be well for my conscience to-day.</p>
               <p>When I was taken away from the mill, I had just turned my eleventh year, but in
                  size and looks was inferior to many children of nine. Three months of low fever
                  and workhouse doctoring did not improve me much; and I was, without doubt, a very
                  pitiful object when a relation came unexpectedly to inquire about me. It was an
                  uncle, by my mother's side, who had run away to sea when a boy, and never
                  revisited Stockford till this occasion, when he found his father and sister dead
                  for many years, and learned that his only relative was a lad in the workhouse. The
                  result was, that either out of curiosity or pity, he came to see me one day, just
                  when I had crawled from my bed, and was lying on a bit of grass near the gate. I
                  recollect well my bewilderment when our work-master walked up, in company with a
                  swarthy-featured stranger, and called out to me, "Look sharp, my lad, and you'll
                  see your uncle!"</p>
               <p>I did "look sharp," I've no doubt, and saw a man about thirty years old, dressed
                  in a jaunty suit of sailors' shore clothes, with a broad palm-leaf hat on his
                  head, round gold rings in his ears, and heavy gold watch seals hanging from his
                  fob. Such a grand-looking personage, introduced as an uncle, filled me with
                  astonishment; and I have no doubt that my relative was quite as much taken aback
                  by my forlorn and neglected appearance. However, he spoke kindly to me, gave me a
                  few halfpence, and told me to cheer up, stop blubbering, and try to be a man. Soon
                  afterward he walked away with Mr. Crump, the master, and I was left to my own
                  reflections concerning the newly-discovered relationship. He never came to the
                  workhouse again; but, as I learned at a future time, he left some money with the
                  parish overseers, to be expended for my use, and promised to look out for me as I
                  grew older.</p>
               <p>This brief visit, and the idea it gave, that there was one human being in the
                  world who acknowledged kindred with me, made an epoch in my miserable boyhood.
                  Long after the occurrence I used to dream at night of the bronzed face, black,
                  sparkling eyes, and blue sailor rig of my mother's brother; and sometimes my fancy
                  would indulge in dreams of his powerful protection and a share in the enormous
                  riches which his gold watch-keys denoted him to possess.</p>
               <p>But I found out that dreaming was not reality. No sooner was I able to walk about
                  once more, than a new arrangement was made for my services by the parochial
                  authorities, and I was again let out, without articles, to a cushion-maker. My
                  experience in a cotton-mill had not imparted a relish for labor, but any change
                  was preferable to pauper gruel and drugs; so I gladly bade good-bye to Stockford
                  Union and its frowning Master Crump. "Mind your catechism, lad," was his last
                  growling injunction. "You're not long for this world, any how, or you'd be
                  articled reg'lar; but while you're spared, you must work sharp and mind your
                  catechism!"</p>
               <p>I cowered, as usual, under the master, and thanked him for the new catechism, in
                  blue paper covers, which he presented on parting. Nearly six years of stripes,
                  starvation, sickness, and abuse, in the Union, had made more impression pression
                  on my youthful memory than the meagre lessons in orthography imparted by the
                  portly master and his termagant wife. Still, through slow and bungling teaching, I
                  had learned to read before I was sent to the mill; and since my illness I pored a
                  great deal over the only book thus far known to me, which was the English Church
                  Catechism. Therefore, I may thank that workhouse for the first bits of education I
                  received.</p>
               <p>My employment under the cushion-maker was one quite suitable to make the
                  overseer's prediction true regarding my short life. I was placed in a close, hot
                  shed, in which was a machine called "the picker," driven by steam, and used to cut
                  and hackle the matted moss for cushion-stuffing. It was a revolving cylinder,
                  stuck full of narrow knives, or sharp nails, that seized hold of the dry, tangled
                  moss, separating and loosing its fibres. My business was to feed the machine
                  constantly, and to pick out all sticks or knots before they got in contact with
                  the spikes. An older lad attended with me the first day, and next morning I was
                  left to work alone.</p>
               <p>I had looked back on my two years' slavery as a <emph>piecer</emph> in the
                  cotton-mill with feelings of horror; but before I passed a week in the picking
                  shed, I think I would have gone back to my mill without murmuring. It was
                  midsummer season, and through the open door I could see the green fields, the
                  trees, and the cattle lying in the shade. But around me a cloud of stifling dust
                  was whirling continually. My ears, nose, and throat were choked with bits of
                  flying moss; my head was addled by the dizzy noise of the whirling picker; my eyes
                  were blinded by dirt and smarted with pain. All day, from daybreak to sunset, I
                  was imprisoned in this horrible place, watching the devouring machine, and
                  supplying its sharp teeth with new piles of moss. When I was let off at dark, I
                  had a scanty supper of black bread and a pot of thin beer; and after this, was
                  sent to sleep on a pile of dirty cushions in the loft over my picking shed.</p>
               <p>On beginning this life, I was scarcely able to stand, from my recent sickness; but
                  I continued to undergo the new torture without complaining, during several weeks.
                  I felt myself failing, however, and soon contracted a cough from the constant
                  irritation of my lungs by the moss-dust. Six months, I have no doubt, would have
                  finished me, had it not been for a timely accident, which occurred in the fifth or
                  sixth week. My left hand was caught by the picking knives, and two joints of the
                  third and little fingers nearly stripped to the bone.</p>
               <p>As I was not regularly indentured, my cushion-making employer declined the expense
                  of supporting me whilst invalided; so the parish overseers were obliged to receive
                  me back, though much against their will. My wounded fingers were dressed and
                  poulticed, but my cough resulted in a lung fever, which soon brought me again to
                  death's door. About this time, I encountered the first friend I ever had—a boy,
                  near my own age, who was a nephew of the parish curate. His name was Arthur
                  Jackson, and, as he will be mentioned hereafter in these pages, I shall relate how
                  he first became interested in my wretched fortunes.</p>
               <p>It was about three weeks following my accident in the picking-shed, that I was
                  reduced to the lowest stage of my lung disorder, and no one for a moment expected
                  that I could survive. I had suffered so much, since I knew what existence was,
                  that it is not to be supposed death could have much terror for me; but Mr. Crump,
                  the master, was not willing to have me go without being made sensible of fear. He
                  came to my mattress at night, with the curate and the boy Arthur, whom I have
                  mentioned. The clergyman asked me many questions, and shook his head at my
                  replies. The work-master hoped I<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6322-00000011"/> might
                  have mercy shown to me, but feared that I must suffer punishment, as I had been
                  obstinate and heedless. They both prayed for me, and went away; but after a little
                  while, the lad Arthur crept back, and took my shrunken right hand in his.</p>
               <p>"Poor boy!" he said softly, "isn't your mother dead?"</p>
               <p>I looked at him wonderingly, and answered that I supposed she was.</p>
               <p>"But you had a dear mother <emph>once,</emph>" said Arthur. "So had I; and when we
                  were little, our mothers held us in their arms, and kissed us, and loved us very
                  much."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Yours</emph> might have," I answered; "but I'm a poor work'us boy! Nobody
                  ever loved me!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed, poor fellow!" replied the boy. "And both our mothers are now with
                  the angels, watching us, and waiting for us to come to them. You are going very
                  soon, my uncle says, and oh, you will be so happy!"</p>
               <p>I looked, at this lad in amazement, as he clasped my thin hand in both of his,
                  lifting it from the bed, whilst his eyes, filled with tears, were raised upward. A
                  strange feeling came over me, and I felt my breath getting shorter.</p>
               <p>"Oh! oh! boy," was all I could gasp, "<emph>I love you!</emph>"</p>
               <p>It was an unaccountable impulse that prompted this exclamation, as if I suddenly
                  felt that I had discovered something, and ought to tell of it. My agitation must
                  indeed have been violent, for the effort at speech caused a vein to burst in my
                  throat, and the next moment I fainted, the blood gushing from my mouth.</p>
               <p>When I recovered consciousness again, it was to experience a dull, painful
                  languor, and a sense as of weariness in all my limbs. But my fever had subsided.
                  The hemorrhage of my throat relieved its inflammation, and my cough was much
                  easier. For several hours I remained in a state like stupor, but at length a
                  naturally healthy constitution began to fight against disease.</p>
               <p>My first inquiry, when I found myself able to speak, was for the curate's boy I
                  felt a longing to see once more the only being who had ever spoken to me of a lost
                  mother. Mr. Crump, at first, paid no attention to my entreaty, but when it was
                  repeated several times, he commanded silence.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jackson's nephew, indeed!" he cried. "What is he to you, my lad?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! if you will beg him to come to me!—if I could only see him again!" I
                  implored, in trembling tones.</p>
               <p>"Tut! tut!—be quiet," said the master; and turned away, in his usually pompous
                  manner.</p>
               <p>But the next morning Arthur Jackson did come, of his own accord, to the pauper
                  boy's sick-bed, and through a long, sweet hour, I knew what it was to be happy,
                  for the first time in my life. The next day, and succeeding one, saw the curate's
                  nephew visit the workhouse, and his coming was to me better than air or medicine.
                  I listened for his light, springing step on the stairs, and my hand was stretched
                  to meet his before he opened the door. Even now, when nearly three score years
                  have passed, I can recall my short interviews with Arthur Jackson with unmixed
                  satisfaction. My earliest and best friend! can I hope to meet him again in the
                  world I am going to?</p>
               <p>Arthur was not a resident of Stockford. He was visiting his uncle, the curate,
                  during his holidays, and thus it was by chance only that I met with him. Bitter
                  was the intelligence to me that he must leave, and return to his school; and when,
                  at length, his bright face faded from my poor bed-side, and I heard his departing
                  step for the last time upon the stairs, it was as if the sun had gone down, and I
                  was again on the brink of my grave.</p>
               <p>It is not much to say, that I learned more of myself, and of all things, in those
                  brief meetings with Arthur Jackson, than I had ever imagined before. His presence
                  seemed to warm me, and I grew and expanded under it. Boy as I was, ignorant and
                  depressed by hard usage, I could recognize this youth's intellect and grace, and
                  it furnished me a standard, henceforth, to measure others. But during weeks that
                  followed Arthur's departure, I could only dwell on his memory with grief, and wish
                  myself dead, because it was hopeless for a pauper lad to think of him as a
                  companion or a model.</p>
               <p>As my general health improved, my lacerated hand also became healed, though I
                  carry a mark of the accident to my grave, in the shrivelled first joint of my
                  little finger. I was now twelve years old, and it became manifest to the Stockford
                  parish authorities that it was time the town should be relieved of my charge.
                  Unfortunately, I had a poor prospect for usefulness, on account of my repeated
                  attacks of sickness, my apparent fragility, and a reputation among the town's folk
                  of being a "luckless lad." Probably it was a consideration of these circumstances
                  that induced an abrupt summons of myself and Mr. Crump before our parochial board
                  of overseers, three stout, red-faced men, in powdered wigs, who sat at a
                  green-covered table, with snuffboxes before them. I well remember the fear and
                  trembling that beset me, when the master pulled me roughly by the arm into their
                  awful presence. They asked me if I would like to go to my uncle, to which I gave a
                  joyful affirmative; and it was then concluded, doubtless, that I should, as soon
                  as practicable, be packed off from the Stockford Union's parochial limits. A
                  bundle of patched clothing, tied in an old Spitalfields handkerchief, new leather
                  brogans, corduroy breeches and a red leather hat, were appropriated as my outfit,
                  whilst a letter without fastening, but made formidable by a stamp in green wax,
                  was addressed to "Maurice Halter, Boston, United States," and given to my charge
                  as a future passport.</p>
               <p>The day before I was to be placed on board the packet, there arrived a small
                  square bundle, with my name superscribed, to the care of Mr. Crump Great was the
                  parochial curiosity to learn its contents, but my joy was greater when I found it
                  to be a present—a present to me, the parish boy, from Arthur Jackson. It was that
                  treasury of childhood, "Robinson Crusoe," in two volumes, and there came with it a
                  few kind words from Arthur, written on a scrap of inclosed paper. How priceless
                  that token of remembrance was to me! My tears fell upon the pictures, as I turned
                  the leaves. I hid the precious volumes under my head, and cried myself to sleep,
                  for the last time, in Stockford workhouse.</p>
               <p>I need not dwell on my departure. I had no leaves to take. I was hustled away at
                  day-break, to ride ten miles to the sea-port, from which a collier was to start
                  for the Welsh coast, to intercept the Irish emigrant ship, as it left
                  Holyhead.</p>
               <p>It was a cold, drizzly morning when Mr. Crump tumbled me, with my bundle, over the
                  wet side of the coal-lighter, on a deck crowded with shivering figures of old and
                  young men and women, children like myself, and babes crying in arms. "Good bye,
                  lad; study your catechism, and don't forget Old England!" was Mr. Crump's parting
                  advice, with a shilling in my hand; and so I left my native shores, expatriated
                  for the crime of poverty.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I WAS knocked about by the sailors, shoved aside by rough passengers, and nearly
                  swept overboard by a swing of the sloop's boom, before I managed to creep under
                  shelter, behind a huge pile of corded boxes and clothes-bags. The rain soaked
                  through my brown stuff frock, and the tossing of the lugger sickened me, long
                  before we made Anglesey light, and hove-to under lee of a weather-beaten
                  packet-ship, from the Irish coast, bound for Boston, in the United States. The sea
                  was rough, causing great confusion and difficulty in transferring the collier's
                  freight; but at last it was effected, and, with some forty other English paupers,
                  from various parishes, I found myself dumped among four hundred Irish emigrants,
                  in the steerage of the ship Polly, of Waterford, Captain Herring.</p>
               <p>I have experienced many hardships, and seen bad voyages, in my life, as I shall
                  have to relate hereafter, but my first taste of the ocean on board the Polly was a
                  thing to be remembered. Child as I was, I knew not what arrangement had been made
                  for my keeping, but during two days I was totally neglected by everybody. I
                  crawled to a dark corner of the bulk-head, and lay coiled up, with my head on my
                  little bundle. The ship's motion renewed my sickness, and through the long dark
                  night I strained and gasped for breath, thinking to die every moment. In the
                  morning I was unable to stir, from weakness. I could see the crowds of emigrants
                  all around me, some lying still, some sick, others talking, laughing, or
                  quarrelling. Women were cooking food, and old men smoking pipes, and the
                  atmosphere was already close and stifling. No one came to my dark nook throughout
                  the day, though heavy feet were incessantly tramping by. I heard cursing and
                  groaning on every side. I was so deadly faint, that I could not have moved to
                  escape being trodden on. In this way another night passed, my head getting dizzy,
                  and my mouth dry and cracked, so that I could not utter a sound. After the second
                  morning, I lost all consciousness, and for many days, as I learned afterward, was
                  raving with fever.</p>
               <p>But I need not recapitulate all the horrors I suffered in that voyage of
                  seventy-seven days from land to land. I should have perished with hunger, in the
                  first place, had it not been for the charity of a poor family, whose bed was
                  stretched near my nook in the bulk-head. While the fever was on me they watched,
                  and, I have no doubt, were the means of preserving my miserable life. Needy and
                  wretched themselves, they shared their "bit and sup," as they called it, with the
                  poor English orphan.</p>
               <p>I think that packet ship, Polly, of Waterford, must have been as bad as any slaver
                  that ever skulked the Middle Passage, with battened down hatches. She was 202 tons
                  burden, and carried 450 odd steerage passengers. They were so thick between decks
                  that the air became putrid, and whenever her sick squads were ordered up the
                  gangways, one or more was sure to gasp and die, with the first gulps of pure air.
                  The steerage became pestilential before our voyage was half made, for the
                  emigrants' beds were never cleaned, and whole families literally wallowed in
                  poisonous filth. The bodies of men and women, and their tattered garments, were
                  incrusted and impregnated with the most offensive matter. Typhus fever and
                  dysentery soon broke out, and then the mortality raged fearfully.</p>
               <p>Looking back through half a century to that long voyage from my native land, its
                  main incidents are blurred in my memory; but I can recall enough to cause a
                  shudder even now, after the many dreadful scenes which my life has since been
                  familiar with. I can remember one day in particular, when I had clambered to the
                  deck, and crept out to a coil of chain near the capstan. Thirty corpses were
                  hauled up during the morning, and cast overboard, to feed a school of hungry
                  sharks that constantly followed the vessel. Most of the bodies were women, with
                  long hair, tangled in their filthy garments. No sooner did one of them strike the
                  water, than two or three sharks snapped at it, till the ship's track was marked
                  with blood. It was a sight that no after horror ever effaced from my mind.</p>
               <p>The Polly's crew, when she left Ireland, consisted of but ten, and four died of
                  dysentery before we were half way across the Atlantic. As all the passengers could
                  not be stowed below the hatches, a sort of pent-house had been rigged on the
                  quarter, where about fifty were barely sheltered from the elements. When I began
                  to pick up a little strength, after my fever, I contrived to ingratiate myself
                  with some of the deck people, and was allowed to make my bed behind a barricade of
                  sea-chests, where, for twenty days, I was comparatively comfortable.</p>
               <p>We had typhus first, and dysentery afterward, and the latter was the scourge of
                  that voyage. The ship's provisions threatened to give out before our last
                  mortality began, and though they were refuse stores of the worst kind, they had to
                  be doled out in the most niggardly way. When dysentery commenced to thin off the
                  passengers, there was enough and to spare of the oatmeal and damaged rice; but
                  water grew scantier every day. Foul weather soon set in, and the Polly was driven
                  from her course into the hot latitudes. Here a succession of hurricanes tossed her
                  about, and the deck sheds were soon demolished. There was no alternative but to
                  crowd all below hatches, and I was driven down with the rest, to undergo a month's
                  torture with more than 300 sick and dying men, women, and children. In a few days
                  I relapsed, and betwixt fever and dysentery, I hardly know how I survived the
                  awful residue of that voyage. Ninety passengers died in the last four weeks. When
                  we made the first light, off Cape Ann breakers, we had 186 left out of 450 odd
                  passengers, and some of these died before landing.</p>
               <p>I was in a pitiable condition—a skeleton, with dirty rags hanging loosely about
                  me. I crawled on deck with the rest, and dragged myself to the gang-plank, where I
                  fell down from sheer exhaustion, and lay in the thick slime of the scuppers. It
                  would have mattered little to me, if some sailor had kicked me overboard out of
                  his way; but neither sailors nor passengers took any notice of my cowering body.
                  They were all engrossed with their own miseries. It was a chilly day, though the
                  sun shone pleasantly enough. I watched the emigrants as they crowded, like
                  spectres, in squalid groups, at the vessel's side, whilst her feeble crew of half
                  a dozen were dropping anchor in the stream.</p>
               <p>Nothing was to be seen on all sides but ghastly faces, and nothing heard but
                  feeble moans, as the word went about that we were to be kept at the quarantine
                  station. I had nothing to say, and no friends to take notice of<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000013"/> me; but my turn came with the rest to go ashore. I
                  was glad, though weal and sick, to be scrubbed and washed; and I slept soundly
                  under the tents, on clean straw, that first night of quarantine. The hospital
                  wards were full, and most of our emigrants remained squalid; so the outside air
                  was necessary to their disinfection. I afterward heard that some of the tents were
                  removed from one spot to another daily, because the ground on which they stood
                  became quickly unsafe from the impregnation of venomous vapors. Lime was then
                  sprinkled over the deserted spots; all bedding and clothing were burned, and the
                  Polly was fumigated for a week; but she never could be purified, and was afterward
                  condemned and broken up as a pest ship. I arrived at Boston in April, 1802, and
                  was over twelve years old, but looked younger. Sickness and hard usage had stunted
                  my growth. During my first week ashore, huddled under canvas with the abler
                  families, I got strength rapidly, and began to feel reconciled to my new quarters.
                  As the emigrants were sent off in boat-loads, I used to wander on the beach,
                  shaking hands with those I knew, and witnessing many sorrowful scenes when
                  old-country people came off from the city to seek friends, only to find their
                  names on the dead list. At last, one day, a visitor came inquiring for some one,
                  and, much to my surprise, I was called out by the steward and presented to him. He
                  was a little, spare old man, in a snuff-colored coat and rusty hat, and leaned on
                  a cane at the tent opening, peering through green spectacles. I could feel his
                  sharp eyes on me as soon as I made my appearance. He spoke quickly, with a slight
                  touch of brogue. "Well, <emph>gossoon,</emph> is your name Thomas Driscoll?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," I answered; "my name is Philip Drake."</p>
               <p>"It's not the lad at all!" cried the old man, addressing the steward. "Sure it's
                  Thomas Driscoll, my daughter's poor orphan child, that I'm looking for, misther.
                  Where's <emph>he,</emph> if you please, sir?"</p>
               <p>"This young un's the last left of the Polly's freight," said the steward.</p>
               <p>"And please, sir, I'm an orphan child," I ventured to say, as I fancied the old
                  man was regarding me through his glasses. "A good many lads died in the
                  ship—more'n twenty, sir!"</p>
               <p>"And was Tommy Driscoll among 'em—d' ye mind?" inquired the old gentleman.</p>
               <p>"Was he an Irish boy? There was an Irish boy, named Tommy, fell overboard," I
                  replied, remembering an incident that had been talked over in the Polly's
                  steerage.</p>
               <p>The steward here remarked that the visitor might go up to the office, and look at
                  the ship's list; and the two walked away, leaving me standing by the tent. In a
                  short time, however, the old man returned alone, and came close to me, seeming to
                  scan my face closely. "My lad, you're an orphan!" he said. "Do you mind where
                  you're going?"</p>
               <p>I stammered out that I believed I had no friends, and then broke into a fit of
                  weeping, for I was still very weak.</p>
               <p>"Cheer up, <emph>gossoon!</emph> The Lord, maybe, will open a gap for you," said
                  the old man, taking my hand. "Tommy Driscoll is gone, poor orphan; but you're his
                  age, and you've a look like my own Maggie's when she was little. So, if you like,
                  I'll take ye with me and befriend you, lad."</p>
               <p>The stranger's words and manners were so novel in their kindliness, that I
                  whimpered more violently than ever, and clung to the hand which had clasped mine,
                  as if it were saving me from drowning. The old man patted my back, spoke a few
                  encouraging words, and then marched me up to the steward's office, where some
                  speedy arrangements were made for my transfer to a new protector. An hour
                  afterwards, with my sole property—the workhouse bundle dle—containing Mr. Crump's
                  letter to my uncle, I was conveyed in a boat, with the old gentleman, to Boston
                  wharves, and that night slept in the back crib of his shop, near Copp's Hill, at
                  the north end of the city.</p>
               <p>My new master, Mr. Thaddeus Mooney, was an apothecary, and lived with his wife in
                  Sun Court, near what was then a busy thoroughfare—Ann street. The couple were both
                  turned of sixty, and had kept the stand upward of twenty years, during which
                  period they had contrived to scrape together a moderate competency. Doctor Thady,
                  as the neighbors called him, was a quiet, serious old gentleman, dividing his
                  whole leisure between his devotions (for he was a strict Catholic) and the reading
                  of ancient books, piled on several shelves in the back-room of the dark store. I
                  was soon initiated into all his habits, and made familiar with his character; and
                  I can look back now through nearly sixty years, and discover no worthier and more
                  harmless man in all I have come in contact with. If ever a good Samaritan lived,
                  it was Dr. Thady Mooney. The poor blessed him, the rich respected him, and it was
                  a gloomy day in Sun Court neighborhood when he was called to leave it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mooney was as quiet and good-hearted as her husband, and I soon became
                  attached to her. She called me her "English boy," and acted the part of a mother
                  to me. My work was light, the hardest portion being to pound drugs in a big iron
                  mortar, under a porch in the yard. I was encouraged to read, and the apothecary
                  became my teacher in many useful studies. The summer glided by pleasantly. Winter
                  came, and I was sent to a school connected with the Catholic Church. Mr. Crump's
                  English Church catechism was discarded for another, and I grew to be a very devout
                  repeater of my new creed. Perhaps it was Doctor Thady's evident satisfaction that
                  stimulated me, but I soon became noted as a "good scholar," and great things were
                  predicted concerning my future. Meantime, I learned to be quite expert in the
                  shop, and was relied on as a compounder of simple prescriptions.</p>
               <p>But my promising life in Doctor Thady's service was destined to have a speedy end.
                  Another spring passed, and summer was half over when the malignant fever of 1803
                  broke out at the North End in Boston. Among its first victims was Mrs. Mooney, and
                  she was soon followed by the doctor himself, who, exhausted by grief and watching,
                  became delirious, and was taken away to die in a hospital. My escape was a
                  miracle, for I attended them both to the last, and was left, when all was over, in
                  sole charge of the little shop, till some distant relatives came to dispossess
                  me.</p>
               <p>I lost my kind protectors, and with them all fine prospects in the future. A
                  Scotchman, named M'Intosh, succeeded to the business, and I was allowed, on a
                  small stipend, to keep my place as assistant. But there were no more indulgences
                  for me. My new employer was a thrifty, penurious man, intent or money-making. He
                  began at once to compound for the market. Mixtures, pills, plasters, ink, were to
                  be manufactured; and the pestle and mortar, the boiling-kettle and roller, were
                  never to be idle. I had no longer any time for book-reading, and school was not to
                  be thought of. Mr. M'Intosh was determined that I should earn my living; and I did
                  so, from day-break to a late hour of the night, at constant drudgery. On Sundays,
                  when the shop windows were closed, we put up pills in boxes, labelled "M'Intosh."
                  My master hated the Catholics, and would not hear of my going to church. So passed
                  another year of servitude, till I was turned of fourteen, and a little stouter and
                  stronger. "Hard work," as M'Intosh said, "agreed with lads."</p>
               <p>Whilst living like a son with Dr. Thady and his kind wife, I had devoted myself to
                  study; and being pretty apt, had picked up a good many ideas. Under M'Intosh, I
                  had no leisure for books, but I brooded over my lot a great<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000014"/> deal. The unsealed letter of Mr. Crump and the
                  Stockford overseers, to my uncle, was still kept among my few valuables, and I
                  often read it over, wondering if I should ever encounter Mr. Halter. Dr. Thady had
                  made inquiries, without avail, and I had told my story to many Boston
                  acquaintances, without being able to discover any trace of my lost relative. But
                  we were soon destined to cross each other's paths again.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ONE September afternoon I was sent with a prescription to the Moon Stage House, a
                  noted starting-post of eastern coaches. It was at the junction of a narrow lane,
                  with Ann street, and its large bow-windows projected into the street. As I passed
                  them, hurrying into the house, I caught sight of a man whose face appeared to be
                  familiar. After delivering the prescription, I saw this man through an open door,
                  reading a newspaper, whilst he puffed a cigar. He was dressed in a fine black
                  suit, and wore a heavy gold chain, crossed on his satin vest. His hat rested
                  jauntily on his curly head, and I could see that he wore small ear-rings. Some
                  sudden impulse caused me to approach him, and he looked up from the paper, fixing
                  his black, bright eyes on my face Then, like a flash, it occurred to my
                  recollection under what circumstances I had seen this man before. I sprung forward
                  and put out my hand, crying. "Uncle, don't you know me?"</p>
               <p>"Who the devil are you?" was the stranger's unflattering response.</p>
               <p>"I'm poor Phil Drake, from Stockford Workhouse."</p>
               <p>"The deuce, you are!" cried my uncle, drawing a long breath, and looking about to
                  see if any one was observing our abrupt meeting. But there appeared to be no other
                  occupants of the bow-windowed parlor. Then my new-found relative began to take an
                  observation of me, examining my person from top to toe, without speaking. I did
                  not neglect to do the like to him.</p>
               <p>I saw the same swarthy face, glittering eyes, and white teeth which had been
                  impressed on my imagination since our brief interview in the yard of Stockford
                  Union. The dress differed, but I could see that he still had a sailor air, though
                  clad in fashionable shore clothes. He was somewhat stouter, too, and of course
                  older, though I hardly noticed any change in the expression of his features.</p>
               <p>It was apparent that my uncle recognized me after his close survey of my
                  appearance, and that his impression was rather favorable, for he muttered "umph,"
                  and told me to sit down, on a chair near him. A short conversation sufficed to
                  acquaint him with my story, and the result of it was that I went away with a
                  silver dollar in my hand, and an appointment to come again in the evening, which
                  I, of course, kept faithfully, without a word to Mr. M'Intosh.</p>
               <p>My uncle was eating supper in his room, and poured out a glass of wine, which I
                  was afraid to drink. He laughed, and said I was squeamish, and soon began to
                  question me concerning what I had learned, in figures, in books, and even as to
                  shop matters. Before we parted, he told me that he was a sea-captain, and that I
                  should sail with him, on his next voyage, from the port of New York. I also
                  ascertained that he was not known as Halter, but Captain Richard Willing, a piece
                  of news which accounted for my ill success in former inquiries.</p>
               <p>"My lad!" said Captain Willing, as we parted that night, very good friends, "I
                  shall make it my business to rig you out, and to-morrow I'll overhaul your old
                  Scotch apothecary."</p>
               <p>To-morrow came, and my uncle presented himself at the shop whilst I was pounding
                  at the mortar. Mr. M'Intosh called me up, gave me some parting counsel, and shook
                  hands with both of us; and that day, after getting a complete new outfit, I took
                  the stage with my uncle, to join his vessel at New York. Our journey was not so
                  quickly performed as in these days of railroads and steam, but in due time, we
                  reached—not New York city—but the little town of New Rochelle, where we took a
                  boat and were rowed off to a vessel which was lying at anchor in the Sound. It was
                  nearly dusk, and a storm was coming up; but that night saw us beyond the landsend,
                  on a southwardly course, which soon gave us plenty of sea-room.</p>
               <p>My uncle had little to do with me on our day of embarkation, except to point out
                  my berth, but next morning, he gave me to understand what duty was expected of
                  me.</p>
               <p>"In the first place, Philip," said he, "you've got no uncle on board this vessel;
                  I'm captain of all on board; you are to help the surgeon, as his mate, and keep
                  your mouth shut. If you do your duty, we shan't quarrel—if you don't, look out, my
                  lad!"</p>
               <p>This was my introduction to sea-life; and from that day to the end of our voyage,
                  my uncle never showed me favor, nor allowed any familiarity on my part. Our crew
                  consisted of thirty, including the captain, mates, and surgeon. The surgeon's name
                  was Maxwell. He was a Scotchman, about thirty years old, stout and thick, with a
                  pock-marked face, and yellow, bilious eyes. He was present when the captain
                  assigned my duties, and took charge of me at once, to initiate me into the secrets
                  of his medicine chest. Thanks to my experience under Dr. Thady and M'Intosh, I was
                  quite as much at home with the surgeon's bottles and boxes, as he himself was; but
                  I had to undergo a long lecture on care and caution from his lips. He was a coarse
                  fellow, and began to snub me at once; but I had the prudence to answer nothing,
                  and appear to be much indebted for his advice; so that he conceived, as I thought,
                  a favorable opinion of me.</p>
               <p>At this period (1805), I had nearly reached my fifteenth birthday, and was growing
                  in size and vigor. I soon became used to sea life, and contrasted it often with my
                  recollections of the Polly's dreadful voyage. My uncle and I had little
                  intercourse. I slept on deck, midships, where the surgeon's medicine chest and our
                  berths were located, and we messed with the mates; Captain Willing taking his
                  meals in the cabin.</p>
               <p>The brig commanded by my uncle was a sharply built craft, of about 300 tons, and a
                  swift sailer. She was named the "Coralline," and was well defended with an ample
                  magazine, and a dozen heavy carronades; as it was a time of war, when French
                  cruisers swarmed the seas. We sailed under the American flag, and, as I learned,
                  were provided with papers from a noted Boston house of West Indian traders.</p>
               <p>No incident of importance occurred in our run southward, until we experienced a
                  two days' calm, about five weeks after leaving Boston, as we were making the coast
                  of Brazil. The calm was succeeded by a violent hurricane,<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000015"/> which drove us before it at a fearful rate, and
                  gave me new ideas of nautical life. The sea ran, without exaggeration, "mountains
                  high," and the Coralline seemed like a cockle-shell dashed to and fro. Every soul
                  on board was obliged to lend a hand in working for the brig's safety; but to keep
                  our course was entirely out of the range of human skill. On the second day of the
                  storm, our bowsprit was sprung, and foretopmast carried away, and the greater part
                  of our water casks stove. At last, on the third day, the gale began to subside,
                  and we found ourselves at the mouth of the La Plata, the largest river of the
                  world. There we were threatened with new dangers from the vast sand banks, on one
                  of which we struck, and with great difficulty extricated the brig. As we had no
                  pilot, we were forced to send boats ahead, trying for soundings; and so, for near
                  a hundred miles, we crept up this river gulf, which was like an ocean in itself.
                  At length, we made the harbor of Monte Video, and cast anchor under shadow of a
                  huge sugarloaf mountain which stands at the back of that city. Several vessels had
                  been driven in before us. There were Portuguese traders, a couple of Frenchmen,
                  and some privateers.</p>
               <p>After casting anchor, we were visited by a port-officer, who examined the brig's
                  papers; and in the evening Captain Willing ordered two sailors to pull him ashore,
                  taking me with him, in the yawl. We went to the house of a wine merchant, whom my
                  uncle had previously known in the West Indies. Here we were well treated, but as
                  the captain and our host talked in Spanish, I could make nothing of the
                  conversation. This incident, however, made me aware that there were other tongues
                  beside English, that were useful to travellers, and I took a resolution to make
                  myself acquainted with Spanish as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>After visiting the wine-merchant, my uncle presented himself at the governor's
                  house, where a dozen whiskered soldiers, with long swords, and shabby uniforms
                  were keeping guard. The governor of Monte Video, at the time, was Don Blas
                  d'Hinojosa; he appeared to be about forty years of age, and a pleasant-looking
                  man. Here we were regaled with fruit and coffee, and my uncle was attended by two
                  strapping negroes, the first slaves I ever saw.</p>
               <p>We remained at Monte Video nearly ten days, while the Coralline was undergoing
                  repairs. I had a good many opportunities of observing the place and its
                  inhabitants; but it is not my purpose to dwell on them. Surgeon Maxwell took me
                  with him on an excursion up the river, and showed me several islands, with
                  peculiar names. There was one, completely covered with tropical flowers and
                  fruits, so brilliant that it seemed like a rainbow arching the water, and filled
                  the air with overpowering fragrance. This was called the Isle of Flowers. There
                  were two other islands, one called the Isle of Wolves, another the Isle of
                  Serpents, which I was informed were appropriately named.</p>
               <p>We hastened away from Monte Video to avoid the <hi rend="i"/>Pamperos, which began
                  to blow across the harbor. These furious winds blow from the immense plains called
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Las Pampas,</foreign> which stretch over an area of a
                  thousand miles, inland. We took advantage of the first freshening, and bowled out
                  of the La Plata at a splendid rate, with new topsails set, and everything in
                  order. After a short coast run, we entered the harbor of Rio de Janeiro, and I
                  looked for the first time upon that fine city, which I was to visit often again in
                  after life.</p>
               <p>There is no handsomer view in the world, I think, than that afforded from a ship's
                  deck, in sailing up the bay of Rio. When I caught sight of the high hills, covered
                  with white-walled convents and country houses, and saw the gardens stretching on
                  every side, I thought the scene must be like Paradise itself. As we drew near an
                  anchorage, the whole water front was visible, with the prince regent's palace and
                  the royal cathedral directly facing the sea. As I had been told that Rio at that
                  time contained a population of one hundred thousand souls, I was prepared for
                  something splendid; but the magnificence of the view far exceeded my
                  expectations.</p>
               <p>But when I went ashore next day, with my uncle and the surgeon, I felt greatly
                  disappointed to find the streets so narrow, filthy, and crowded with all
                  descriptions of dirty passengers; Indians and negroes swarmed on all sides, and
                  some of the latter were hideous objects to behold. I soon began to learn something
                  of these black-skinned fellows, and to get an inkling of my uncle's business in
                  Rio. At this same time I had already picked up a little Spanish, as there were
                  several South American seamen on board the Coralline; and now I contrived to add
                  some Portuguese words to my stock.</p>
               <p>I adopted the plan of writing down all foreign words on hearing them, in order to
                  learn their meaning afterwards. This gave me my first idea of keeping a private
                  journal, which I have done at intervals through many voyages since. A great
                  portion of my notes went, with more valuable things, when I was cast away on the
                  African coast, long years after the time of which I am now writing.</p>
               <p>We had been a week in Rio, when I was directed, one morning, to make up some
                  medicines, and accompany Dr. Maxwell in a short trip up the bay. A couple of stout
                  negroes pulled our jolly-boat some three miles above the palace, and we landed on
                  a shelving beach, at the junction of one of the many little coves with which these
                  shores are indented. We left the boat in charge of our blacks, and walked inland,
                  under the shade of the thick woods, till we came in sight of a large white
                  building, and an inclosure containing a score or more low sheds. Within the
                  inclosure, and swarming all about the grounds which surrounded the principal
                  building, were at least a thousand negroes, sitting, standing, and lying down,
                  under a broiling sun. Some of the men were fastened together in pairs, by
                  hand-cuffs, but the majority were loose. Dr. Maxwell hurried through the sable
                  groups, till we reached a veranda of the big house, where several yellow-skinned
                  fellows were watching a white man, who was swinging half out of a hammock. The
                  surgeon addressed this gentleman as Mr. Floss, and was answered in a round English
                  voice. Mr. Floss wore cool, white pantaloons, and a loose shirt of fine linen, but
                  that costume did not prevent his appearing hot and uncomfortable.</p>
               <p>"Well, doctor, I'm glad you've come," said Mr. Floss, "for my live stock is going
                  off like rotten sheep. Take a glass of wine, Max, and I'll be with you in a
                  jiffey. Here, youngster (winking at me), don't be afraid of a sip of claret.
                  Rodrigo, my hat and fly-brush!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Floss was a red-faced man, with a low forehead, shaggy eyebrows, and a dull
                  leaden cast in both his eyes. He spoke in a loud, brisk tone, and the mulatto,
                  Rodrigo, jumped to obey him as soon as he heard his name uttered. He fetched his
                  master a broad-rimmed straw hat, and an instrument which I thought was a
                  cat-o'-nine-tails, though Mr. Floss had asked for his fly-brush. Surgeon Maxwell
                  was helping himself to a liberal supply of claret wine from a table near the
                  hammock, and I ventured to swallow a small quantity. Mr. Floss then took the
                  doctor's arm, and I followed, carrying the medicine case. We passed by the groups
                  of negroes, who shrank out of the way to avoid the fly-brush, which Mr. Floss was
                  swinging carelessly as he walked along, and soon entered one of the wooden sheds,
                  where a dismal spectacle was disclosed to me.</p>
               <p>The hut was square, with thatched roof and latticed sides, so that the air
                  circulated through it pretty freely. But in spite of this, the atmosphere at once
                  recalled to my mind the horrible steerage of the emigrant ship Polly.<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000016"/> More than a hundred naked blacks were lying on the
                  bare ground, in every stage of disease. Their skins were shrivelled, their limbs
                  and faces emaciated, almost like skeletons. My first look at them appalled me; but
                  as the surgeon and Mr. Floss walked in, I was obliged to follow.</p>
               <p>Here was, indeed, a strange scene disclosed to my boyish eyes, and curiosity
                  struggled with disgust when I saw that these poor creatures, sick and dying, were
                  of that sex which, when white skins are concerned, we distinguish by the name of
                  "tender." Most of them lay prostrate, with eyes closed; some looked up as we
                  passed, and others moaned. There were a dozen old negresses, having bits of white
                  linen tied around their waists, who glided about, with earthen pitchers, giving
                  drink to the wretches under their charge. As Mr. Maxwell stopped, and said
                  something to Mr. Floss, that gentleman broke out with an oath that sounded
                  unnatural in such a place.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," he exclaimed, "I've lost five hundred, more or less, since April, and
                  something's got to be done! There, sir," he continued, touching a female at his
                  feet with the toe of his shining pump—"there goes three hundred dollars. I can
                  tell by the way the wench's eyes are rolling."</p>
               <p>Mr. Maxwell stooped over the black, who appeared to be a full-grown woman, and
                  felt of her pulse. I crept nearer, and gazed upon the poor creature, my heart
                  beating almost audibly. Mr. Floss stood by, puffing his cigar, and balancing his
                  fly-brush, whilst his face wore a discontented expression.</p>
               <p>The slave was writhing in the agony of death. Her tawny skin was loaded with thick
                  drops of sweat; her lips were drawn apart at the corners, showing the white teeth
                  and red gums, as if in a ghastly grin; her eyes rolled in their sockets while she
                  gasped for breath. Suddenly she gave an unearthly screech, and leaped to her knees
                  with hands outstretched. Mr. Floss jumped back, almost treading on another female,
                  and at the same time whirled his fly-brush, letting its cords fall on the breast
                  and head of the dying negress. She fell on her face, and straightened
                  out—dead.</p>
               <p>"'Pon my soul, Max," cried Mr. Floss, whose red face had become pallid all at
                  once, "I thought the wench was making a spring! They get the devil in 'em
                  sometimes. By Jove, she's dead! isn't she? I told you so."</p>
               <p>Surgeon Maxwell made no answer; for, though more hardened to such scenes than I
                  was at the time, he could not help noticing the mingled brutality and cowardice of
                  his friend, the overseer Floss, who had dealt the negress a blow out of sheer
                  fright at her sudden scream. Meanwhile, I was looking at the back of the corpse,
                  on which I could see, in a raised blister that ridged the dark skin, the two
                  letters, "R. F." I also glanced furtively at the "fly-brush," which had astonished
                  me, with its heavy swing, and saw that its braided cords were loaded at the ends
                  with small bits of coiled lead.</p>
               <p>Continuing his round with Mr. Floss, our surgeon examined several of the poor
                  patients, and prescribed for some of them a powder or draught, my medicine pack
                  furnishing the ingredients. After due inspection of the female hospital, the
                  overseer conducted us to a second shed, crowded with men and boys. Here he kept
                  his fly-brush in constant readiness, and I thought, with very good reason; for
                  some of the negroes glared at him when we passed, as if they would gladly tear him
                  to pieces, and die for it afterward.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE scene I had witnessed made a strong impression on my mind; and when we
                  returned on board the Coralline, I asked many questions of Mr. Maxwell, concerning
                  Mr. Floss and his "live stock." The surgeon was smoking a cigar at the quarter
                  rail, and looking out upon the busy harbor of Rio, full of shipping, and all
                  ablaze under the rays of the setting sun, which cast a red glow upon the
                  water.</p>
               <p>"Youngster," said Mr. Maxwell—I shall never forget the curious leer of his saffron
                  eyes, as he looked at me—"Youngster, you'll know bimeby the market valuation of
                  such 'live stock.' Niggers, Philip, are the making of white men! This fine city of
                  Rio would soon be swamped if it wasn't for niggers, young man!"</p>
               <p>"But what's the good of abusing the poor people, as Mr. Floss did?"</p>
               <p>"That's his business, and none o' yours, youngster!" replied the surgeon. "Niggers
                  are trying to the feelings, and when a man's scared of 'em, he's apt to cut up
                  rough sometimes. Floss isn't worse than other overseers, only he's a little
                  nervous, I take it."</p>
               <p>Mr. Maxwell turned away, and began to puff his Havana, leaving me to my own
                  reflections.</p>
               <p>This was the second week of our stay in port, and the Coralline's hands, together
                  with a score of shore blacks, had been busy for some days past in stowing a mixed
                  cargo of colored cottons, kegs of powder and rum, trinkets, tobacco, and other
                  goods, suitable for a trading voyage. Casks of water and provisions were shipped
                  next, and, in a week more, the brig was ready for sea again. My uncle, while in
                  port, lived pretty generally ashore, leaving the vessel's care to Mr. Osborn, his
                  first mate, who was a great crony of Mr. Maxwell, the surgeon. The surgeon had
                  ordered a new supply of medical stores, and I was kept busy two or three days in
                  assorting and labelling our calomel, sulphur, Peruvian bark, and other drugs, in
                  the way I had been taught under Doctor Thady and M'Intosh. Meantime, the captain
                  came aboard, the anchor was weighed, and we started on our voyage for—Africa.</p>
               <p>I did not then attach the significance to that word "Africa" which now surrounds
                  it in my memory. Orphan as I was, with my only relative between the same decks
                  that furnished my own shelter, I felt little anxiety of mind concerning the
                     <emph>whither</emph> of my voyage. I was of the age when adventure is welcome
                  and change little considered; and as we left the bold shores of Brazil, with a
                  full sheet, and the spray dashing over the brig's cutwater, I began to dream of
                  future distinction and profit, perhaps, when manhood should make me my own master,
                  to sail the world as I liked.</p>
               <p>But I was soon to experience another variety of what the underwriters call "perils
                  of the sea," for we had hardly cleared the continent than we were hailed by an
                  armed brig, which, hoisting a private signal, fired a gun to leeward, and
                  endeavored to bring us to. I was on deck, watching my uncle,<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000017"/> who reconnoitered the stranger through his
                  spy-glass, and then ordered the man at the wheel to keep straight on, as we were
                  under a press of canvas.</p>
               <p>Another, and another gun, warned us that we were pursued by a determined enemy, if
                  enemy it was; but the only reply our captain vouchsafed, was to show some private
                  merchant pennons fore and aft. We were keeping our course, and the other vessel
                  did not seem likely to overhaul us speedily, when a second stranger loomed up on
                  the larboard tack, apparently a consort of our neighbor, whose signal was hauled
                  down, and the tri-colored flag of France run up in its stead. This was no sooner
                  seen by Captain Willing, than he ordered the stars and stripes to wave from our
                  main-top, and we rounded to at once.</p>
               <p>We were soon boarded by a French officer, who blustered a great deal at first, but
                  my uncle was quite cool, and showed his American papers. The result was a
                  hob-nobbing of wine-glasses, and our Gallic visitors were bowed over the
                  Coralline's side, with an interchange of "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">bons
                     voyages,</foreign>" and a present of some cigars from my uncle to the cruiser's
                  commander.</p>
               <p>But the affair was attended with other results beside the detention of a few
                  hours, for the wind which had been fresh and favorable, now died completely away,
                  and a heavy mist began to obscure the setting sun. In a brief space, the two
                  French vessels, which had fallen off to leeward before the calm, were quite hidden
                  by the increasing fog, and, after consultation with Mr. Osborn, the captain
                  ordered in all sail, and prepared for a change of weather, quite usual in those
                  latitudes, where hurricanes succeed calms with fearful suddenness. Every stitch of
                  flying canvas was brailed away, and all loose gearing stowed securely, whilst the
                  sun was dipping blood-red under the horizon, and the air getting murkier every
                  moment.</p>
               <p>An hour wore heavily on, and the mist thickened, but no breath of air agitated the
                  sea. There was no creaking of cordage, no swaying of the mast, not a sound heard,
                  except a long rippling wash at the prow, which I could distinguish as I leaned
                  over the bow davits. We were drifting through that heavy fog on one of the
                  mysterious currents of the Atlantic.</p>
               <p>That night was a sleepless one to all on board the Coralline. My uncle summoned me
                  to the cabin, where he was studying a coast chart, and I was then kept running up
                  and down between him and the first mate, who watched the compass; whilst two of
                  our crew were constantly casting the lead, under direction of Mr. Frost, the third
                  officer. The evident anxiety of all, not excepting Surgeon Maxwell, who took post
                  by Mr. Osborn, with his everlasting cigar, was quite unintelligible to me. I would
                  rather have enjoyed the quiet, damp atmosphere, and apparently unmoving vessel;
                  but a sudden loud call of the starboard leadsman, of "soundings!" and a more
                  startling cry from the larboard one, of "shoal water!" brought my uncle on deck,
                  with an order to let go the anchor. During the remainder of the night, our vessel
                  rested upon the sluggish stream without motion, and all hands watched anxiously
                  for another morning.</p>
               <p>Contrary to general apprehensions, there was no further presaging of a hurricane,
                  and at day-break the fog lifted sufficiently to enable an observation to be taken,
                  and to discover the brig's position, apparently surrounded by innumerable small
                  islands and low sandy banks. They were visible on every side, some bordered by
                  sharp reefs, others covered with thick woods, and indented by narrow coves. My
                  uncle examined the shores through his telescope, and I heard him say quickly to
                  the first officer:</p>
               <p>"Blacks, Osborn—a nest of pirates!"</p>
               <p>The mate took the glass, and shook his head.</p>
               <p>"No pirates, sir! I'll wager a keg of rum, they're runaway niggers, from
                  Domingo!"</p>
               <p>"What!" cried my uncle, "do you think so."</p>
               <p>"I'm sure of it; I can see a boat full in yonder cove, and they've got not a
                  musket among them! I heard that the French were hunting them six months ago."</p>
               <p>"Zounds! we'll try the sport ourselves then," said the captain, "for we can't
                  budge from this whilst the calm continues!"</p>
               <p>A boat was soon manned with fifteen sailors, under the captain's own command. I
                  was permitted by my uncle to go with the party, and my impression of what occurred
                  ashore will be seen by the first entry I ever made in a journal, and which I have
                  transcribed from the old copy-book where it was written nearly fifty-four years
                  ago, in the year 1805: <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="i"/>June 8<hi rend="i"/>th, 1805.—This day I begin keeping a
                        journal. I have seen a great many strange things since I left Boston. My
                        uncle, Captain Richard Willing, is captain of the brig Coralline; Mr. Osborn
                        is first mate; Mr. Frost is second mate; Mr. Maxwell is surgeon; I am
                        surgeon's assistant. Yesterday we were boarded by a Frenchman, and all last
                        night lay at anchor in this place; there is no name for it. Mr. Maxwell says
                        it's a cluster of the Spanish Antilles.</p>
                     <p>The fog cleared away a bit, about sunrise, and I went ashore with the
                        captain and fifteen sailors, in the cutter. We pulled up a little creek, and
                        surprised a black man and woman fishing, and the sailors seized and gagged
                        both. They tied the woman neck and heels, and stowed her in the boat, and
                        then made her partner tell all about the island. I could not understand
                        their lingo, but my uncle soon marched the man away, with fourteen sailors,
                        and left only one in the boat to wait for our return.</p>
                     <p>The black fellow was awfully frightened; one of the sailors kept a pistol at
                        his head all the way. We followed a path through the woods, and soon came in
                        sight of a beautiful shaded valley, overgrown with flowers, where a number
                        of huts were built under the large trees. We saw a crowd of black men, women
                        and children, sitting on the grass; some were cooking round a fire, where a
                        brass kettle was boiling; others were rolling on the green, playing with
                        black babies, and some eating and drinking. They seemed to be enjoying
                        themselves greatly, whilst we watched them from the thicket. My uncle
                        whispered to the boatswain, and some of our men crept away, to get another
                        position. My uncle fired a pistol, and the whole party then rushed toward
                        the blacks, who began to scream, and threw themselves down on the grass,
                        begging for mercy. I hardly knew what was going on, before half the negroes
                        were tied hand and foot. Some of them cut off into the wood, and some made
                        fight, I suppose, for two were knocked down, and killed by the sailors. We
                        returned to the boat, with more than 40 black men, women and children, and
                        they made three boat loads. All this was done in about two hours. I never
                        saw my uncle in better humor. He ordered rum to be served out to all our
                        men, and gave some to the poor blacks, who looked down-hearted enough. One
                        woman has been moaning all day, and refuses to eat. One of the blacks killed
                        by the sailors was her husband, so Mr. Maxwell says.</p>
                     <p>After mess, the captain, Mr. Osborn, Mr. Maxwell, and all the rest, except
                        Mr. Frost and two sailors, went ashore again in the yawl and pinnace. We
                        heard firing a good many times, from the island, and the men did not get
                        back till dusk. They brought off about thirty blacks, and Mr. Maxwell told
                        me they scoured the island pretty thoroughly, as it was only about two miles
                        long, though covered with vegetation. He says there's to be another hunt
                        to-morrow morning, before we leave, on a larger island, a short distance
                        off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="i"/>July 9th.—I wanted to go with the expedition to day, but my
                        uncle left me in the yawl with our boatswain, on the beach of an island not
                        far from the one we visited yesterday. I saw a large turtle near the rocks,
                        on the top of the water, but he made off, when we tried to catch him with
                        our oars. We waited two hours for the crew, and heard guns pretty often. It
                        was very lonesome on that beach, as we<pb n="26-27"
                           xml:id="VAC6322-00000018"/> could not see the brig, on account of a point
                        of land running out. I was somewhat skeery about the blacks attacking us,
                        but the boatswain had a musket and two pistols loaded, and he said the
                        niggers were afraid of their shadows, when white men hunted them. Besides,
                        our men had found out that there was not a weapon on the island, but clubs;
                        as the blacks had run away nearly naked from the other islands, and lived
                        here by catching fish and turtle. Our party came back in three hours, and
                        brought a gang of blacks lashed together. My uncle was cursing hard, and
                        looked savage, and all were sober enough; one of our men had to be carried
                        on the shoulders of two messmates; he had been knocked down by a club, in
                        the hands of a big black. But the worst has to be told. Another powerful
                        negro had jumped from a rock into the sea, with one of our men, a Portuguese
                        sailor, and held his head under water, till both were strangled.</p>
                     <p>Our wounded seaman was carried aboard in the yawl; likewise Mr. Maxwell, and
                        some of the blacks, who were scowling horribly, though secured hand and foot
                        with irons we had in the boats. A couple of trips got the rest aboard, but
                        when we were shoving off the yawl, we heard screaming, and four women came
                        running down the wooded beach. The captain waited till they got near, and
                        sent some of the men to tie them. Two of these women had babes in their
                        arms, and one was a girl about twelve or fifteen years old. The other was an
                        old negress who seemed to be a grandmother. My uncle refused to take this
                        last on board, and she yelled frightfully as we loft the shore, and
                        stretched out her hands, till we rounded the point, and lost sight of her
                        entirely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="i"/>July 10.—We got away from the reef-islands yesterday, and have
                        been sailing before a good breeze all night. We have here a hundred and five
                        blacks handcuffed between decks, and I begin to see how slaves are treated.
                        My uncle does not use a "fly-brush," like Floss the overseer, at Rio; but I
                        had no idea that he could be so stern. Before we weighed anchor, two canoes
                        and a raft paddled aft, from the smaller islands, and about thirty more
                        blacks were alongside, and begged to be taken on board. As near as I can
                        find out from Mr. Maxwell, they wanted to rejoin their relatives who were
                        chained under hatches. But my uncle saw that they were nearly all old men
                        and women, some of them decrepit. He picked out three, and ordered the
                        others off; but as they resisted, he made the sailors shower them with hot
                        water from the brig's coppers. It was cruel to hear the poor wretches cry
                        out, and moan, but they would not paddle off, till our gunner fired a
                        six-pound shot, and demolished the raft. I think this was barbarous, and
                        told Mr. Maxwell so, but he says the people were too old to be good for
                        anything, and that my uncle knew his business. He says I had better
                        recollect my uncle's advice, to "keep your mouth shut."</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MY respectable uncle, Captain Willing, of the brig Coralline, had made a lucky
                  stroke in hunting the runaway negroes, and lost no time in profiting by it. Three
                  days after the capture, his blacks were assorted, handcuffed in pairs, and
                  transferred on board a Florida trader, which we spoke in the neighborhood of Cape
                  François. My uncle received several bags of doubloons and new supplies of
                  provisions, in exchange for them. Mr. Maxwell dined on board the Spanish vessel,
                  whilst we were lying to, and after returning, was very sociable with me. I proceed
                  with my journal, in which I entered an account of what he related to me at that
                  time, concerning the captured runaways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>July 15<hi rend="i"/>th, 1805.—Mr. Maxwell, our surgeon, has told me
                  all about the poor blacks. It appears that great fighting has been going on in the
                  Isle of St. Domingo, between Frenchmen and the blacks. The Congo negroes rose on
                  the plantations, and set fire to the white people's dwellings. Several black
                  chiefs made war on the French, and dreadful massacres took place on both sides.
                  Six thousand negroes were killed by bayonets and thrown overboard from French
                  ships, and about a thousand more were poisoned in prison at a place called Port
                  Republicain. The French got some old ships filled with black prisoners and stifled
                  them to death with burning brimstone. They also cast them over in pairs with
                  weights tied to their necks, and drowned them. The Johncrows and sharks made meals
                  of them. Mr. Maxwell says:</p>
               <p>The negroes retaliated on the French in the most horrid way. They went off in
                  boats and attacked traders, butchering their crews and passengers. One packet
                  bound to St. Marc, was boarded by blacks, and the captain and officers had their
                  eyes bored out with cork screws. A French frigate captured one of these boats,
                  manned by twenty negroes, and took seventeen ashore, where they were stoned by the
                  white people, and then kicked and trampled to death; some of the French women
                  stamped on the negroes' faces till they expired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>July 16<hi rend="i"/>th.—We parted company last night with the
                  Florida trader, which took our run-away negroes. Mr. Maxwell says my uncle will
                  make fifteen thousand dollans by his lucky bargain. He finished telling me about
                  the negroes. It seems that several thousands of the more peaceable blacks
                  abandoned St. Domingo, and took refuge in different islands of the contiguous
                  uninhabited groups. Many were afterward hunted out by French crews and speculating
                  slavers; and my uncle was one of the luckiest of the latter, in obtaining and
                  getting rid of the negroes, without much delay of his voyage. Mr. Maxwell says it
                  was a golden opportunity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>July 17.—My uncle had me to dine with him to-day, and asked about my
                  Spanish studies. He gave me a grammar and definer. I intend to work hard on this
                  language. Besides, I am picking up scraps of French from our cook, Antoine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 12.—Last night we arrived at this place, the harbor of Porto
                  Prada, island of St. Vincents. Mr. Maxwell says we have made a good run. I went
                  ashore this morning, in the long boat, and spoke Spanish with a Portugee soldier.
                  He said he could teach me Portugee in a month, if I stayed here. He asked me for
                  some tobacco, but I had none to give him, for which I was sorry, as he seems a
                  pleasant chap. I saw a negro baby on the sand, with its stomach swollen like a
                  bladder. This island is one of the Cape de Verd islands. It is not much of a
                  place, but we are glad to get fresh meat, and take a run ashore, after our sea
                  life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 20<hi rend="i"/>th.—To-day, I had a first glimpse of the
                  African coast. My uncle says he will take me with him on a trading trip inland. A
                  party of six are going, with the surgeon and myself. My uncle is going to buy
                  gold-dust, and afterward load a cargo of slaves for the Brazils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 22.—We cast anchor yesterday, here at the mouth of the Rio
                  Volta, a trading station. Here we land a large part of our cargo, consisting of
                  powder, guns, rum, cotton cloth, and trinkets. My uncle has chartered a schooner
                  belonging to Don Josey, the owner of this trading post, and leaves the Coralline
                  in charge of Mr. Osborn, chief mate, to run down the coast to Congo. We are
                  shipping a new crew of woolly-headed fellows, who run up the shrouds like monkeys.
                  Mr. Maxwell calls them Fishmen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 25.—We are working up the broad river, and everything is new
                  to my eyes. I think Africa a strange country indeed, and had no idea it was so
                  beautiful. The country on both sides of this river seems like a garden, and much
                  finer than Monte Video, or even Rio. I can see the natives cultivating their
                  cornfields, and we have passed two villages full of people, living in round topped
                  huts, covered with green branches. We anchored last night opposite a very large
                  field, with herds of cattle browsing the grass; and the black people brought us
                  milk in a canoe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 26.—This morning I went ashore in the schooner's boat, and
                  saw the<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6322-00000019"/> blacks cultivating their
                  rice-fields. They have dozens of canals crossing in all directions. We brought off
                  some poultry and fresh eggs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 29.—The schooner is lying at anchor off this place, which is
                  quite a large town, full of people. There is a big space, inclosed with posts and
                  boards, for a market, and the huts form a semi-circle on a hill-side overlooking
                  the river. This town is called Malee, and is under dominion of the African King of
                  Ashantee. There are about three thousand inhabitants here, principally traders
                  from the interior and the mountains, where the gold mines are. A pretty large
                  stream runs by this town into the river, near where our schooner is anchored. In
                  the middle of Malee is an idol-house, where the Fetish is kept. The Fetish is a
                  false God, which these heathen blacks think very powerful. He looks like a China
                  ornament, and is made of red clay, daubed with black and white streaks. He is
                  about two feet high, and sits squatting on a palm-leaf mat. He has several priests
                  to wait on him, and these poor ignorant blacks bow down and worship him day and
                  night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 30.—We are going up to the mountains to trade with the gold
                  men. To-day I went through the market-place, and saw the slave-gangs. There is a
                  war going on between the King of Ashantee and his neighbors, and he is capturing a
                  great many prisoners, which he ships down the river to sell as slaves, or else
                  sends to the mountains to wash out gold. The slaves are here traded for blue
                  cotton gowns, called <hi rend="i"/>tobes, coral beads, looking-glasses, and
                  trinkets of brass and copper, as well as for gold dust.</p>
               <p>Our proposed expedition to the mountains, which we could see rising to a great
                  height from the plains beyond Malee, promised to open new wonders to my youthful
                  fancy. We set out with a long procession of black traders and soldiers, as a guard
                  for the white men. Soon after leaving the town, we entered a dense forest, where
                  hundreds of red monkeys were jumping from tree to tree, and chattering at us. The
                  trees were gigantic, and laced over by creeping vines, thick with flowers of
                  crimson and yellow, as large as a peck measure. On every side we could see birds
                  of the finest feathers, so tame that we might have caught them in our hands.</p>
               <p>The headman of the Ashantee soldiers, who formed our body-guard, was a
                  ferocious-looking black. I could not help observing him narrowly. Though so many
                  years have passed since that expedition, yet its incidents are impressed on my
                  memory, and I can picture this man Quobah as if he were present now. He was black
                  as jet, with a high, conical head, and wool braided in stiff hanks. His teeth were
                  filed sharp. His cheeks were slashed with two deep cuts, colored by some red
                  earth, that gave him an unearthly appearance. When he first rolled up his eyes and
                  glared at me, I felt a chill run all through my frame. Quobah was a giant in limbs
                  and height. He carried a huge spear, and had a powder-horn and pouch strapped to
                  his neck, and was dressed in a wide sack of yellow cloth, striped with blue, with
                  a red tasselled cap on his head. It required three slaves to bear his arms—one
                  carrying a heavy, curved broad-sword, another his club, and a third his
                  musket.</p>
               <p>My uncle was quite familiar with this terrific fellow from the first, but I kept
                  away from his grim face, and trudged along by Dr. Maxwell's side. We had nothing
                  to do but walk, as there were plenty of blacks to carry all luggage, our party
                  consisting altogether of one hundred and fifty. My uncle had given me a light
                  Spanish carbine, which I kept slung to my back, with a knapsack containing
                  ammunition, and a few little curiosities I had picked up at Malee. The novelty of
                  such a journey prevented all feeling of weariness. Besides, our days' journeys
                  were short, and at night we halted in some beautiful valley, and were served like
                  lords with every African delicacy. The women ground corn, cooked rice cakes, and
                  milked the cows, that were driven along with the party as pack-beasts. Afterward,
                  our blacks beat the tomtoms toms, or wooden drums, and kept up singing and dancing
                  till it was time to camp down. Then the Ashantee soldiers set a watch; the white
                  men swung their hammocks under the trees, and the night passed well enough, except
                  for the crying of wild beasts, which was not so agreeable to me at first.</p>
               <p>But our march was destined to be interrupted, and I myself compelled to see a
                  little more of Africa than I had anticipated when we started from our schooner at
                  Malee.</p>
               <p>One evening we encamped on the borders of a smooth river, shaded by immense trees,
                  whose roots extended in the shallow water like enormous serpents. The sun was
                  setting splendidly whilst we ate our supper. There was not a breath of air moving
                  the broad leaves of the palms. Some of our blacks were lounging about, smoking
                  their pipes; and others lay upon the grass, whilst their wives fed them with
                  butter-rolls and nice bits of a kid that had been killed and stewed since we
                  halted. In the midst of this peaceful scene we were attacked on all sides by a
                  sudden enemy, and the quiet banks of the river became all at once a bloody field
                  of battle.</p>
               <p>I was seated under a tree, drinking water from a calabash, when the first shouts
                  and a shower of arrows threw our camp into confusion. Next moment the forest
                  appeared to be alive with a legion of savages. I saw my uncle seize his pistols
                  and sword, just as a ferocious negro, armed with a huge club, was making at me.
                  Quobah, our Ashantee chief, jumped before me, with his gun levelled at the strange
                  black; and this gave me time to spring to my feet and grasp my carbine, which was
                  lying beside me. I had no opportunity to fire, however, before at least a dozen
                  enemies darted in from all sides. I was beaten down before I could lift an arm.
                  What else took place during the combat I was spared from witnessing; but when I
                  came to my senses once more, it was to behold a horrible sight.</p>
               <p>I found myself lying at the foot of a tree, tied hand and foot, so that I could
                  scarcely move. The forest seemed all on fire around, from a multitude of torches
                  stuck in the ground, and waved up and down in the hands of a savage multitude,
                  running to and fro, yelling and singing like maniacs. I could see the river
                  shining luridly under the blazing light. Fires were lit on its banks, and the
                  negroes danced about and between them. Never did I imagine that human beings would
                  resemble devils so much as did these shouting negroes. Their sable bodies were
                  smeared with white in bars and streaks, so that many looked like skeletons as they
                  leaped back and forth. Some were joined hand in hand, whirling in a ring; others
                  brandished fire-brands, and trotted in a single file, squatting like frogs, close
                  to the ground. A group, within a few rods of me, were striking their spears and
                  clubs together, and beating wooden drums. One of them spied me as I turned my
                  face, and suddenly jumped toward me, screeching horribly, and swinging something
                  in his right hand. He was a gigantic negro, daubed with white. His wool was
                  gathered into two stiff braids, standing up like horns. As he stopped before me,
                  he dashed the thing he was grasping close against my breast, and I screamed aloud
                  in recognizing it to be a human head—the head of a white man—dripping with
                  blood.</p>
               <p>The sights I beheld that night can never be effaced from recollection, but I
                  cannot describe them as they appeared to me. Hour after hour I was compelled to
                  look on the fiendish figures of the negroes, who continued their orgies till the
                  morning dawned. Only a short distance from the tree to which I was fastened, the
                  savages were engaged in constant murders. A score of them, armed with heavy
                  war-clubs, surrounded a log near the river-bank, and every few minutes some victim
                  was dragged to this log to be massacred. The poor<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000020"/> wretch was held by the legs, with his head on the
                  timber, and a dull blow of a club ended his life immediately. When I closed my
                  eyes to shut out this awful spectacle, I could still hear the blows and yells. If
                  I looked in another direction some new horror met my view. In this manner my first
                  night of captivity among savages passed miserably indeed.</p>
               <p>Near daybreak, I fell into a short sleep, filled with frightful visions. I was
                  awakened by a hand loosening the thongs which bound my limbs, and tried to rise,
                  but was so cramped that I could not stand on my feet. The fires at the river side
                  were smoldering. Hundreds of dusky figures were lying around them, or rising from
                  the thick grass. I heard a noise of wooden drums and conch shells, and hordes of
                  savages began to swarm from the forest aisles. They were painted and armed in
                  war-fashion, and made a terrible appearance to my tearful gaze, as they crowded
                  the river bank. I looked fearfully for some trace of my travelling companions from
                  Malee, and shuddered as I thought of them. The white man's head that I had seen by
                  torchlight, in savage hands, seemed dancing still before me.</p>
               <p>Before sunrise the black camp was in motion. I saw our cows driven past, and
                  behind them about fifty of the Malee soldiers and their attendants, tied together,
                  in couples. A company of hideous savages followed, bearing the spoils of our
                  caravan, garments, pieces of cloth, guns, and other weapons; but the most dismal
                  sight came next, some score of heads and limbs of the massacred prisoners, held
                  aloft on spear-points, ghastly objects in the morning light. I grew sick on seeing
                  them, but nevertheless felt relieved in noticing that the bloody remains were all
                  of black-skinned victims. But my disgust was increased in observing as they
                  passed, that those who bore the recking trophies were females. Besides their
                  spears, they had bows and arrows slung across their naked breasts. I then called
                  to mind what I had heard reported at Malee, concerning women-warriors of the
                  Dahomey king. This induced the suspicion that my captors were of the Dahomey
                  nation, which turned out afterward to be the case.</p>
               <p>The thongs that had hurt my ankles all night were taken off, and one of my guards
                  gave me a drink of water, and some morsels of dried curds, which relieved the
                  cravings of hunger. I was then placed between two of my captors, and received a
                  smart punch in my side, from the butt-end of a spear, to signify that I must go
                  forward. At the same instant, raising my eyes, I saw the well-known figure of
                  Quobah, our Ashantee captain, bound like myself, with the addition of a cord about
                  his neck, held by a gigantic savage. Quobah's forehead was cut and bleeding, and
                  he was entirely disarmed and naked. But he strode on, with head erect, and eyes
                  rolling gloomily from left to right, taking no notice of my glance or exclamation.
                  He was hurried forward to join the main body, and I soon lost sight of him.
                  Shortly afterward, I was surrounded by a number of female blacks, who kept up a
                  chattering, and danced before me, grinning like monkeys. In this manner the day's
                  journey commenced, and I was forced along at a rapid pace for several hours,
                  before another halt.</p>
               <p>I need not dwell on the hardships endured, during a week's march, before we
                  reached the place of my destination. I soon began to look about me, and though
                  unable to understand a word that was spoken, I could comprehend something
                  concerning my captors. We kept a well-beaten track through the forest, and along
                  the banks of rivers, one of which we crossed. I then had an opportunity of seeing
                  the whole force of the war-party spread over the shallow fords, and reckoned them
                  to number at least a thousand. Soon after this, however, small gangs were
                  continually branching off at cross paths, taking squads of the prisoners with
                  them. At last, after dwindling down to about a hundred, we reached a walled
                  village, and were received with great rejoicings by all its inhabitants. Our party
                  encamped in the centre of a fine grove of cotton-wood trees. Here I again saw
                  Quobah, the Ashantee, who had been transferred from another gang at our last
                  halting-place. He was corded about the neck as before, and his arms were secured
                  to his side by means of a wooden hoop around his body, tightened behind with a
                  wedge-shaped piece of wood. I soon learned by signs from the women-slaves, that
                  the Ashantee chief had been troublesome, and nearly effected his escape on the
                  march.</p>
               <p>The town of Yallaba, at which we now arrived, was situated in a valley called by
                  the same name. It was about half a mile square, entirely inclosed by an adobe
                  wall, and rendered nearly inaccessible on three sides by a wide swamp which lay
                  between the ramparts and a sluggish river. The cotton-wood, where we were welcomed
                  by the people, grew outside the south wall, and was surrounded by cultivated
                  fields of rice and corn, interspersed by numerous huts and pastures stocked with
                  cattle. We were greeted by a hideous noise of drums and shells. An old black man,
                  fat and greasy, dressed in a shirt of red English muslin, such as curtains are
                  made of, and wearing a tarpaulin hat on his grey wool, was here seated on a pile
                  of soft sheep-skins, and Quobah and myself were led before him. I was obliged to
                  kneel before this old fellow, who turned out to be the king of Yallaba. I was
                  nearly as naked as Quobah, for my clothes had been stolen away piece-meal on the
                  march by the chattering women. The king pinched my flesh, rubbing it with his
                  black hand, and muttered something in his own lingo. The women then gave me milk
                  in a gourd, and led me away, leaving Quobah standing before the sheepskins.</p>
               <p>Such was my reception at Yallaba. I afterward found that I had made a favorable
                  impression on the fat king, who was called Mammee. Next day we entered the town,
                  and I was relieved from my fetters, and permitted to roam about in the court-yard
                  of Mammee's square house, or palace. It was not a very grand mansion, but it
                  extended over an acre, or more, and was guarded by fifty female soldiers. I was
                  taken in charge by the king's women, and treated liberally with milk, curds,
                  fruit, and rice cakes. After witnessing the cruel treatment of my late companions
                  by these Yallaba blacks, I was fearful of being reserved only for torture, or
                  perhaps for food, as I had heard that many of these negro nations were cannibals;
                  but I soon found that my youth and white skin made me a sort of curiosity. I was
                  kept among the house slaves, and assisted the women in pounding corn between two
                  flat stones, and preparing fagots for fires. Finding myself unmolested, I began to
                  regain my spirits, and made myself familiar with many words of the black language.
                  I have always been quick at catching up foreign expressions, and my aptness made
                  me a favorite at Yallaba.</p>

               <p>IT was, as near as I can recollect, about the middle of September, in the year
                  1805, that my captivity began in the Yallaba valley. If I should describe every
                  incident of nearly two years' sojourn among these people, I might fill a book with
                  curious stories; for I accompanied many war excursions and hunts of wild animals,
                  and mixed in the ceremonies and customs of several Dahomey tribes. But I must
                  hurry to more stirring years of my life; although it would have been as well for
                  myself, perhaps, if I had never left Yallaba, or at least, never mingled with my
                  own white race again.</p>
               <p>About three months after our arrival, I found means to communicate with Quobah,
                  the Ashantee chief. I had lost sight of him, but heard from the women that he was
                  kept for sacrifice at a grand feast in honor of the king's fetish. All the negroes
                  have fetishes, or idols, which they look upon as guardian angels. King Mammee's
                  fetish was a sort of scarf, which he always wore under his other dress. It was
                  woven of different sorts of hair, of men and beasts, birds' feathers, claws, and
                  bits of bone, strung on cotton cloth. The old chief believed that this fetish
                  protected him from dangers and enemies. On a particular day, this wonderful scarf
                  was to be charmed by the priests, and made more powerful still, and on that
                  occasion Quobah, the giant captive, was to be offered in sacrifice. I was told all
                  this by the king's youngest daughter, who was quite a handsome little girl, in
                  spite of her tawny skin. Her name was Sooluh, and when I saw her first she was
                  about twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Quobah, it appeared, was considered a great prize. He had been taken only after a
                  desperate struggle with a dozen Yallaba warriors, and was kept chained and guarded
                  in one of the strong rooms of King Mammee's house. It was through Sooluh's
                  influence that I was admitted to speak with him. He was gloomy and silent, at
                  first, but I got him to speak a few words of broken Spanish, which I managed to
                  understand. By these I learned that the Dahomans, who attacked us, were often at
                  war with the Ashantee nation, and that a mutual hatred existed between them. In
                  regard to my uncle and Dr. Maxwell, he thought they had escaped, and that the
                  white man's head I had seen belonged to one of the sailors. I felt much relieved
                  on hearing this.</p>
               <p>I contrived to see Quobah several times, and carried him a few fruits, which
                  Sooluh gave me. I told him what I had heard about the sacrifice, but he already
                  expected it, and only grinned scornfully, saying that he knew how to die, like an
                  Ashantee warrior. Things were in this state, when a catastrophe took place that
                  altered matters considerably.</p>
               <p>I had heard rumors for some time back, concerning the ravages of a lion in the
                  surrounding country; and one morning little Sooluh came to tell me that the beast
                  had attacked the slaves who were gathering corn, and killed a dozen the night
                  before. The king was in great trouble, for all the field people had sought shelter
                  in the town, afraid of another visit. A consultation of the priests was held, and
                  the fetish was consulted about the alarming visitor. At length it was decided that
                  the lion was an evil <hi rend="i"/>fetish, and that, to appease his wrath, it was
                  necessary to sacrifice Quobah at once. Accordingly, the Ashantee captive was led
                  into the public square, and all the people gathered about to witness his massacre.
                  King Mammee sat on his throne of sheepskins; and the priests were all armed with
                  immense clubs and swords.</p>
               <p>Quobah stood with his arms folded, rolling his eyes around the circle of Dahomans,
                  until he heard all that his enemies had to say. Then he addressed the king and
                  priests abruptly. They listened to him attentively, apparently quite impressed
                  with what he said. When he had finished, they consulted together, and, much to my
                  surprise, the Ashantee was unbound and led back to his quarters.</p>
               <p>But the mystery was soon explained. Quobah had proposed that, as he was to be
                  sacrificed in any event, he should be allowed to choose his own method, by
                  volunteering to go out alone, and fight the lion. The priests decided this to be
                  lawful, and the king expressed his satisfaction. I need not say that the poor
                  field people of Yallaba were glad to find a champion against their dreaded
                  foe.</p>
               <p>No time was to be lost, as the sun was declining, and the king of beasts was
                  expected to visit the valley again, that evening. The cattle had all been driven
                  within the walls, and the huts deserted since the previous night. Quobah was to go
                  out, with such arms as he might select, and either slay the lion, or fall a
                  sacrifice to the evil fetish, and thus avert destruction from the husbandmen.</p>
               <p>I had, of course, no faith in the fetish charms, but I could not help being
                  impressed with the solemn manner in which the priests dismissed Quobah on his
                  adventure, from which no one expected him to return. They chanted a dismal strain,
                  whitened their faces, and beat their heads with stones. The women howled in
                  chorus, and the Dahoman warriors clashed their swords and spears together. Quobah
                  alone appeared to be unmoved, as he marched to the south gate, armed with a long
                  spear, his own huge sword, which had been restored to him, and with my carbine,
                  the only really serviceable fire-arm in the town. He had scarcely got beyond a
                  heavy stone, that secured the log door, before a terrific roar sounded from the
                  fields, which made our Yallaba soldiery retreat suddenly, whilst the Ashantee
                  leaped boldly out.</p>
               <p>I was standing among the king's people, with Sooluh clinging to my hand, when the
                  lion's roar startled everybody. We climbed to the wall, and looked over. Here,
                  sure enough, was an enormous lion, cantering over the fields, a short distance
                  from the gate. His mane was standing erect, and he lashed his tail with furious
                  strokes, as he saw Quobah slowly approaching him. I watched the Ashantee, and held
                  my breath as he appeared marching to certain death. The priests and women began to
                  howl, and the men pounded their war-drums to frighten the lion; but he only lashed
                  his tail the fiercer, and crouched for a spring. Quobah sunk on one knee, and
                  fronted the beast; I could fancy his eyes rolling with the glare that had
                  frightened me when I first beheld him. Next moment, the lion leaped, and alighted
                  on the sharp point of Quobah's spear, which the crafty warrior had suddenly
                  raised, whilst the butt rested on the ground. The Ashantee jumped aside, and left
                  the brute floundering, with the lance through his shoulder.</p>
               <p>At this instant, another loud roar was heard from the forest, which hemmed the
                  fields, at some distance. All eyes were turned in that direction, and we beheld a
                  lioness crashing through the corn, followed by two half-grown cubs. Then, indeed,
                  it seemed that all was over with the Ashantee, for the wounded<pb n="34-35"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000022"/> lion had broken the spear to fragments in his
                  struggle, and was crouching for another spring, though evidently sorely nurt.
                  Quobah lifted his gun—my light carbine—and held it ready to fire; whilst he turned
                  his head a moment toward the advancing lioness. Then, as the lion made his second
                  leap, the Ashantee sprang nimbly aside, barely escaping the fatal sweep of his
                  enemy's paw. The lion fell heavily, on his wounded shoulder, and uttered a groan
                  of pain; while Quobah, running close to him, placed the carbine at his very mouth,
                  and fired. When the smoke cleared we could see the lion on his back, writhing in
                  the agonies of death, and the lioness snuffing the earth, about twelve feet from
                  Quobah. For a minute more, the beast kept her nose to the ground, her eyes burning
                  in the rays of the setting sun, like fire-brands. She then gave a roar more
                  frightful than any we had heard previously, and rose with a flying leap, directly
                  toward the Ashantee warrior. The next that we saw was a cloud of dust whirled
                  around the man and beasts. Quobah had awaited the lioness' attack, close beside
                  her mate, and with all his gigantic strength had driven his sword-blade straight
                  into the animal's mouth. We heard a stifled roar, and could see the ground torn up
                  for a brief space, and then, as the dust settled, we beheld the lion and lioness
                  stretched side by side, and Quobah lying across them, covered with blood. The two
                  cubs sat on their haunches, a little way off.</p>
               <p>Old King Mammee, who was on the wall, clapped his hands together, and the priests
                  and people raised a shout of joy. The gate was then opened, and crowds poured out
                  into the fields. I ran amongst the rest, keeping Sooluh by the hand, till we came
                  near the field of battle. There was no holding back among the people, now that
                  their great enemies were slain, and in a very short time they lifted Quobah from
                  the enormous bodies of the two brutes. The Ashantee was still living, but his left
                  arm had been mangled, and his breast was torn across by the lioness' claw. He
                  still grasped his sword with his right hand; the blade was red with blood from
                  hilt to point. Before the sun went down, however, the brave chief revived, and had
                  his wounds dressed by the king's doctor, who permitted me to assist him in the
                  operation. Meantime, the soldiers had attacked, and killed the two cubs, and this
                  freed Yallaba from lions for many a day. The lioness' teats were full of milk, and
                  Quobah had the satisfaction of drinking some of it, as well as feeling its effects
                  in a wash for his wounds. He recovered in a few weeks, and was solemnly set free
                  by King Mammee and the fetish priests, who desired to make him a member of the
                  tribe, and offered him one of the princesses for a wife. But Quobah was a true
                  Ashantee, and refused to abandon his nation. He received the skins of the lion and
                  lioness, as his own prize, and was dismissed with honor, to his native country. I
                  ventured to ask leave from King Mammee to accompany Quobah, in order to return to
                  mine; but the old man refused me promptly, telling me he had other views in regard
                  to my future. I was, therefore, obliged to content myself with Quobah's promise
                  that he would try to let my uncle know—if he were still alive—that I was a captive
                  of the Dahomans, in Yallaba.</p>
               <p>After the Ashantee's departure, I was allowed, as a great favor from King Mammee,
                  to take my carbine at times, and go out to shoot in the woods, in company with the
                  young Yallaba princes. I here turned my little knowledge of medicine to account,
                  by culling several herbs and simples used in pharmacy, which abound in the African
                  forests. I afterward compounded these, and prepared both draughts and balsams to
                  use in fevers and acute diseases. This exhibition of medical skill, in a youth,
                  was received with wonder by the king and his physicians, as well as by the
                  priests, who decided that I must possess a powerful <hi rend="i"/>fetish. So it
                  appeared, as I grew in size, and begun to understand the Dahoman language, that I
                  was in a fair way to become a person of consideration. After the season of rains,
                  which occurred some months following Quobah's dismissal, I was allowed, for the
                  first time, to accompany an expedition that was organized with the design of
                  capturing slaves for the great Dahoman market, held yearly at the capital town,
                  called Abomey. I will briefly relate the incidents of the slave-hunt.</p>
               <p>The preparations for this affair were going on through all the different towns for
                  months before we started. Old King Mammee never left the valley, on account of his
                  unwieldy size and rheumatic affections; but the eldest prince, named Caribo, was
                  made commander of our war-party. We set out with three hundred men, and travelled
                  east for two days, before we joined the main body of about twelve hundred. Four
                  hundred of these were women-soldiers. The most were armed with bows and arrows,
                  clubs and spears; but there were about a hundred muskets among them. The army was
                  made up of war-parties from different towns, like Jallaba, each having its
                  priests, who carried fetishes in front. Some of the fetishes were human skulls or
                  scalps, hung around with shells and pieces of jingling metal.</p>
               <p>Besides warriors, there were gangs of slaves to carry provisions and luggage, and
                  the whole force was led by a son of the Dahoman king, from Abomey. There were
                  women, also, to prepare food for the soldiers. We halted every night, and had a
                  feast and dancing. On the seventh morning we reached the enemy's borders, and came
                  in sight of a quiet village. Here our hunting began, by the Abomey general firing
                  off his gun and giving a shrill yell to encourage his followers. Immediately our
                  whole army of blacks rushed upon the village, and commenced battle. The
                  resistance, however, was not very great, as our approach had been unexpected. Our
                  warriors climbed over a wooden stockade, hurling their spears, and shooting their
                  arrows and muskets. The inhabitants were taken by surprise, and, after fighting a
                  few minutes, turned to escape from their town, but found themselves completely
                  surrounded. It was all the work of one hour after daybreak, and when the sun
                  peeped through the trees, at least three hundred prisoners were secured. They
                  consisted of men, women, boys, and girls. Old people and infants were not
                  considered of value, and were knocked on the head or stuck with spears as fast as
                  they were brought in. I turned away in horror from these cruelties of the savage
                  blacks, for my heart was not then so callous as it afterward became.</p>
               <p>The Dahomans had a great feast that day, and toward evening we marched several
                  hours. The captives were yoked together in couples, with bamboo collars, and a
                  long ox-hide band connected a half dozen collars together. Besides this, their
                  hands were bound behind, and a tall Dahoman marched beside every couple, beating
                  them with a heavy whip whenever they appeared to lag. We halted that night and
                  part of the following day, and the next evening arrived near a larger town than
                  the one we had surprised. It was situated in a valley, and I had a view of it at
                  sunset from the top of a wooded hill on our line of march. Here our captives were
                  made to lie down, and stakes were driven in the earth, fastening them securely.
                  When the night was somewhat advanced, the main portion of our force set off in
                  small parties to creep into the unsuspecting town. I remained behind, with about a
                  hundred, who had been left to guard the prisoners. I had no desire to witness
                  another slaughter of unresisting old men and women.</p>
               <p>About an hour after the warriors set out to descend upon the valley, a bright
                  flame shot up from the town, announcing their presence. A chorus of yells, cries,
                  and groans broke the silence of the night, and in a few moments<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000023"/> more the whole valley seemed in flames. I ran to
                  the brow of the hill, from which I could look down upon the scene, as if it were
                  looking into the street from the roof of a house. And an unearthly scene it was.
                  The sky grew red, and the town could be seen as plainly as by daylight. I
                  distinguished the different Dahoman warriors leaping and running about, whirling
                  their weapons. Hundreds of houses were on fire, and their wretched inhabitants,
                  rushing from the flames, were received on the points of spears by their enemies.
                  At one part of the village a severe battle raged for some time. Muskets were
                  discharged, and I could plainly hear the shouts on both sides, and the clash of
                  their weapons. In other places, the naked women and children were running for
                  their lives, pursued by Dahoman soldiers, who dragged them back and threw them on
                  the ground. The light of the blazing huts lit up everything, and made the savage
                  figures seem like beings of the lower world engaged in some infernal ceremony.</p>
               <p>It was near morning when the fires smoldered out, and the work of capture and
                  massacre was finished in that place. More than four hundred choice slaves had been
                  taken. After they were shackled, we pushed on without rest, for fear of pursuit,
                  as we had heard that the enemy were assembling in our rear. We marched homeward
                  several days, and on the way surprised three other small hamlets of blacks. When
                  we halted at last, to divide the plunder, before separating, it was found that our
                  hunt had resulted in the capture of nearly a thousand slaves, of which more than
                  two-thirds were youths of both sexes. Besides this, we had seized a large quantity
                  of corn, cattle, and other spoils. The share of our Yallaba warriors was quite
                  considerable, and when we reached the valley, a great feast was held in honor of
                  their bravery and good luck. Old King Mammee sat on his pile of sheepskins, and
                  distributed feathers to the principal men, and the priests made a solemn sacrifice
                  of two young boys to the king's fetish. The poor lads were cut to pieces with
                  knives by the women-soldiers, and afterward burned before the idol.</p>

                  quite glibly, as well as handle the spear, or bow and arrow, with some dexterity.
                  My constitution had improved, and my body was getting hearty and tough, which
                  changed me greatly in appearance. Before going on the slave-hunt, I had been
                  rubbed with palm-oil and blacked with some sort of earth, so that I looked like a
                  negro at first sight. This was by King Mammee's order, and I had to submit. I
                  became reconciled to the palm-oil, when assured that it kept off venomous insects;
                  for I once nearly lost my life by the bite of a scorpion, as I shall now
                  relate.</p>
               <p>Sooluh, the youngest daughter of King Mammee, was a sort of playmate of mine from
                  the first. She was a mere child when I arrived at Yallaba, but in a year or two,
                  she grew into quite a little woman. After my return from the slave-hunt, she
                  appeared more shy than formerly of my company; but it was not from any ill will,
                  as the following will prove.</p>
               <p>One sultry afternoon I felt like having a good swim in the river, and took a small
                  gourd of palm-oil to rub my body with. After enjoying myself in the water, I lay
                  down on the soft grass awhile, and fell asleep, only to be awakened suddenly by a
                  sharp pain in my left side. I got up quickly, and a large scorpion fell from my
                  naked breast, which so frightened me that I screamed and fainted back, expecting
                  certain death from the bite, which is generally fatal in a short time. The next
                  moment I was embraced by a pair of soft arms, and Sooluh's head sunk on my
                  shoulder, her lips fastening on the scorpion bite, which had already begun to
                  swell. My brain grew dizzy, my eyes closed heavily, and I knew nothing more till I
                  found myself lying on my own mats in the king's house. My side was bound up with
                  pieces of astringent bark. Sooluh was sitting near the mats, watching me with her
                  large black eyes, whilst several other females clustered round the door. I soon
                  learned that I was out of danger, thanks to Sooluh's prompt assistance. The young
                  girl had heard my cry, and seen the scorpion making off. She ran to my assistance,
                  and, kneeling beside me, sucked the venom from my wound before it had spread into
                  the circulation. I soon recovered, and it was said that I must have a very
                  wonderful <hi rend="i"/>fetish to protect me, as the bite of an African scorpion
                  is regarded to be incurable. But though I escaped, poor Sooluh was taken ill next
                  day, either from the reaction of her excitement, or from swallowing some of the
                  scorpion's venom. She became delirious, and I soon found myself nursing her, as
                  she had watched me; but in a few weeks we were both well, and better friends than
                  ever.</p>
               <p>My imitation of the dress and manners of the Yallabas, and apparent contentment
                  with negro life, won the favor of all, but my associates were among the princes
                  and young chiefs. I had abandoned many scruples that I felt at the beginning, and
                  joined in the savage amusements and ceremonies on all occasions. I was waited on
                  by slaves, and shared all the feastings of King Mammee, who led an indulgent life,
                  with his score of wives. My full dress consisted of a piece of calico cloth,
                  wrapped about the loins, and a sort of cloak, which Sooluh wove of mango leaves,
                  split fine, and fringed with colored threads of unravelled cotton.</p>
               <p>It was, as near as I can recollect, after I had been twenty months with the
                  Yallabas, when King Mammee sent for me one day to confer on me a special honor—no
                  less than to make me his son-in-law by marrying me to Sooluh. He made a long
                  harangue, telling me that his fetish and mine were to be henceforth very powerful,
                  that he himself was my greatest friend, and that I would become more popular with
                  all the tribe after being united to Sooluh. My youthful vanity was touched by this
                  mark of royal favor, and I was not averse to the princess, who had saved my life,
                  and was the handsomest young negress I had ever seen. I consented at once; Sooluh
                  was sent for, and came dressed in her <foreign>tontongree,</foreign> or white
                  cotton shift. She was attended by her sisters and a train of maids, and the
                  ceremony of marriage was performed by the women leading her to my hut. After a
                  special feast, with singing and dancing, I became a husband at the age of
                  seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Great rejoicings and entertainments followed my marriage, and I found myself a
                  distinguished personage, whilst Sooluh was become the envy of all her female
                  friends. But I had not enjoyed my new honors long before another great slave-hunt
                  was announced. Prince Caribo set out to lead our war-party, as before, and I
                  accompanied him as a doctor and general favorite.<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000024"/> This was my last expedition with the Yallabas; for,
                  before we reached the rendezvous of other Dahoman war-parties, we were set upon by
                  a superior force of hostile negroes, and nearly all our party taken prisoners. I
                  was captured by the chief, stripped and tied, and then marched twenty days'
                  journey through a dense forest, till we reached a negro settlement on a large
                  river, which I afterward ascertained was the Gambia.</p>
               <p>Fandee was the name of this African town, which belonged to a tribe of the
                     <foreign>Foola</foreign> negroes. After my arrival here, I saw no more of
                  Prince Caribo, or the Yallaba warriors, but heard that they were sent off in gangs
                  to the rice-fields, which abounded on the river shores. I was conducted to the
                  Foola prince, who was a gigantic specimen of African royalty, being six feet and a
                  half in height as he stood. He was thick-lipped and flat-nosed, but had a good
                  forehead and commanding expression. He wore gold rings in his ears, which reminded
                  me of my uncle, and his shoulders were covered with a variegated mantle of native
                  cloth, which hung like a priest's surplice over his huge limbs. He asked me
                  questions, and I found I could comprehend his language very well with my knowledge
                  of the Dahoman tongue. I made no secret of my story, and gave him as good an
                  account as possible of my experience at Yallaba. The result of this interview was
                  my release from strict confinement, and liberty to look about among the people of
                  Fandee, who were generally larger and better featured than the negroes I had
                  heretofore seen.</p>
               <p>The women of Fandee were quite free and attractive, and were very eurious about
                  the white stranger; but though I saw many handsome forms among them, I could not
                  help thinking with regret of my Yallaba wife Sooluh. I was then a young man, and
                  my heart had not become hardened.</p>
               <p>The population of Fandee appeared to be industrious and thrifty. I soon learned
                  that they were not ignorant idol worshippers, like the Dahomans, but Mohammedans,
                  with books, or at least written scrolls, in their houses, which were read by young
                  and old. The market was in the centre of the town, which was surrounded by walls
                  of mud baked hard in the sun. Fruit, vegetables, rice, pepper, milk, and meat were
                  sold. The women wore bands of blue and white cloth folded round their waists, and
                  hats of plaited straw. They polished their bodies with palm-oil, and had bracelets
                  and anklets of shells and beads.</p>
               <p>After stopping at Fandee a month, I was taken in charge by a party of Foolas, and
                  carried down the river in a canoe, till we reached a trading station and slave
                  market, where I was greeted for the first time in two years by the sound of a
                  white man's voice, in my own language. My heart leaped when I saw a man in the
                  dress of an English sailor, and learned that a vessel was at anchor near the
                  town.</p>
               <p>Captain Fraley was a Bristol trader, engaged in the African trade, and had half a
                  dozen sloops at different stations on the Gambia, taking in cargoes of negroes to
                  ship from the coast. The place to which I had been brought by the Foolas was one
                  of these stations, called Wadee. It was merely a depot for slaves, with a few
                  sheds built for their shelter. Captain Fraley, it appeared, had heard from one of
                  his negro agents that a white man was at Fandee, and had bought me from the Foola
                  prince for half a dozen muskets, a keg of rum, and a piece of Manchester cotton.
                  "You see, my boy," said the Bristol trader, laughing, as he shook my hand, "you're
                  a regularly purchased slave, but I'm ready to bargain for your ransom on favorable
                  terms."</p>
               <p>I was overjoyed to meet such a jovial, good-natured fellow-countryman as Captain
                  Fraley seemed to be. He was acquainted with my uncle, and had seen him within a
                  year; so that I knew he had escaped the Dahoman massacre. I went with this
                  pleasant captain on board his sloop, which was to sail down the river on the
                  following morning. She was more like a pleasure yacht than a trading vessel, being
                  about twenty-five tons burden, with a snug little cabin, where we found her
                  skipper, Captain Fisher, and sat down to a supper, with English plates and
                  glasses. I handled the knife and fork awkwardly enough at first, but managed to
                  satisfy my appetite; after which I gave an account to my new friends of my
                  experience in African manners and customs. I was shown a cot in one of four
                  comfortable lockers of the sloop's cabin, but was awakened in the night by a noise
                  of groaning, which startled me greatly; so that I went on deck, though the air was
                  chill, and a thick mist covered the river. Captain Fraley heard me, and called
                  out, asking what disturbed me, on which I inquired about the groaning, and was
                  told that it was only the "darkies." Next morning all was explained. The sloop's
                  hold was crowded with a cargo of eighty slaves, stowed in a space of hardly thirty
                  feet, as the hold was only ten feet long. The blacks were placed in a sitting
                  posture, one within another's legs, so that each did not occupy more than three
                  feet. As this was the first time I had seen slaves packed, I expressed my surprise
                  to the Englishman, who laughed, and told me I would see closer stowage than this
                  before long—a remark that was soon verified.</p>
               <p>We dropped down the Gambia, and were joined next day by a smaller sloop of ten
                  tons, with forty slaves aboard, in a hold about nine by four feet, length and
                  width, and two feet between ballast and deck; but this cargo consisted of boys and
                  girls. Our own craft was afterward made to accommodate a deck-load, as there was
                  quite a stock of slaves waiting at all the stations.</p>
               <p>I found Captain Fraley a pleasant man in the cabin, but he had no feeling where
                  negroes were concerned as a matter of traffic. He was engaged in extensive
                  operations on the river Gambia, and owned quite a fleet of Bristol and Liverpool
                  craft, which he supplied with cargoes from his factories on the African coast. His
                  mode of obtaining slaves was generally by fair barter, but he also organized
                  hunting parties on his private account, to operate with various negro kings.
                  Captain Fisher, of our sloop, informed me that he had been upon many hunts on the
                  small rivers which emptied into the Gambia. It was customary for parties of
                  sailors and coast blacks to lie in wait near the streams and little villages, and
                  seize the stragglers by twos and threes, when they were fishing or cultivating
                  their patches of corn. Sometimes an attack was made by night on the huts, and as
                  many seized as could be conveniently managed in the boats.</p>
               <p>By degrees I became familiar with all the usual methods of catching slaves, and by
                  the time our sloop arrived at the coast, I exhibited so much quickness to Captain
                  Fraley, that he made me an offer to receive me into his employ as clerk, at wages
                  which would soon make me independent. I was flattered, and would have consented at
                  once if I had not set my mind on finding my uncle, who was supposed to be then, as
                  Captain Fisher heard, at a slave station near the Congo River. Captain Fraley
                  agreed to give me a passage in one of his coasters, just starting southward, and
                  assured me that I might rely on him at any time if I wanted to better my
                  fortune.</p>
               <p>The Bristol brig in which I embarked for Congo, was to carry out supplies for a
                  factory of Captain Fraley's on the Angola coast, and bring back a cargo of slaves
                  to the Gambia stations, where his chief depots were located. She was a heavy
                  sailer; and when we reached Embomma, near a hundred miles from the mouth of the
                  Congo, we found that Captain Willing had left that settlement a week before. There
                  was nothing for me to do but accompany the schooner to Angola, and thence back to
                  the river Gambia, for I had neither<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6322-00000025"/> money
                  nor acquaintance elsewhere. But I was soon to experience another turn of
                  fortune.</p>
               <p>The brig, in which Captain Fraley had given me passage, was named the Friendship.
                  Her captain was a Londoner—one Thorley—a rough but honest seaman, who treated me
                  very well. There were likewise eight Portuguese and Danish sailors on board, the
                  mate an Irishman, and an English cabin-boy, myself, and two Guinea negroes. We had
                  hardly cleared the Congo River outward, when the Portuguese and Danes mutinied,
                  and took the vessel.</p>
               <p>I was talking with Captain Thorley below when we heard a noise on deck, and he ran
                  up to see what it was about. I waited a few moments before I followed, and, to my
                  horror, stumbled over the little cabin-boy, lying by the companion rail, with his
                  head split open. The crew were then throwing Captain Thorley overboard, after
                  having knocked him in the head with the cook's axe. At the same time I heard a
                  faint cry of "Boat! boat!" and saw our Irish mate just drifting astern. One of the
                  Portuguese sailors ran toward me, brandishing a handspike; but I called out in
                  Spanish, begging my life, as I had no other chance against the mutinous crew. He
                  turned away, and I remained in expectation of instant death whilst the bloody work
                  went on. Our two Africans being called from below, where they were asleep, the
                  Portuguese cook brought them each a tin cup full of rum; and whilst they were
                  drinking it, two other mutineers shot them with musket-balls through the stomach,
                  and then threw them overboard.</p>
               <p>I thought my turn was now sure, but the fellows, after talking together a few
                  moments, presented me with a cross, and demanded that I should swear never to
                  divulge the murders, which I was glad to do, though with small faith in their good
                  will to me. They then began to overhaul the brig, which was laden principally with
                  damaged British goods, muskets, powder, and rum. They plundered the officers'
                  chests, and filled two boats with provisions and whatever articles they thought
                  most valuable. I was allowed to get into one of the boats, and then, after
                  scuttling the brig, these pirates pushed off, and steered for the coast, which we
                  reached on the third day after the massacre. Both boats were swamped in making a
                  landing, a Portuguese and a Dane being drowned in the surf. Some of the provisions
                  and rum-kegs were washed ashore, and the mutineers drank themselves drunk, and lay
                  down on the sands. About noon we started for the bush, but had not walked far
                  before a gang of blacks appeared, armed with clubs and spears; in a few moments we
                  were all stripped and bound, and I was once more a captive among negroes. I found
                  that we had fallen into the hands of a tribe of Kroomen, as the coast negroes are
                  called; and my ability to talk a little of their lingo was of service very soon.
                  The head man of the Kroos could also speak a few English and Spanish words, and
                  most of the party had been employed by ship masters at different times. These
                  Kroos had a great number of canoes, hollowed from light wood trees, hauled up on
                  the sandy beach of a cove, which was shut in by high reefs and a line of
                  tremendous surf. The Kroos inhabit the African coast, together with the Fishmen.
                  The interior tribes are called Bushmen.</p>
               <p>Our captors dashed into the boiling waters with their wedge-pointed boats, and
                  picked up several articles of the pirates' plunder. Afterward they marched us
                  several miles inland to their village, where they were welcomed with great noise
                  of copper drums and gun-firing. Our rum was distributed, and a bullock killed, for
                  a feast.</p>
               <p>We remained two days in the Kroo village, and were then taken back to the beach,
                  where we found a boat belonging to an English ship then in the offing, and were
                  soon safely aboard the Brothers, a Liverpool slaver; I told her captain the story
                  of the Friendship's loss, and four of our six mutineers were at once put in irons.
                  The other two were nearly dying, and made a full confession. I here learned that
                  my uncle, Captain Willing, was still on the coast of Africa; and the captain of
                  the Brothers promised to take me to Calabar, where he then was. I was overjoyed at
                  this good luck, as I considered it.</p>
               <p>The Brothers was a ship of 500 tons, with a crew of forty, English, Scotch, and
                  Portuguese. She was coasting for a supply of slaves, in exchange for rum, powder,
                  guns, salt, and cotton cloths; and had a schooner on deck to run up the rivers. I
                  got into the good graces of Captain Baker, her commander, who was a kindly sort of
                  man. We arrived at the outlet of Calabar River, and there heard that Captain
                  Willing was on the Qua, a saller stream about eighty miles inland. The schooner
                  was here launched, and I went aboard of her, to ascend the river. She was supplied
                  with water, beef, rum and yams, and a quantity of handcuffs, muskets, powder and
                  ball; and the second mate of the Brothers, McVery, was her skipper. On her arrival
                  at the Qua River, I found that my uncle had gone still further inland, on a
                  negro-hunting expedition. He had two forty-ton schooners, lying before a negro
                  depot, at the mouth of the Qua, and on boarding one of them, I saw, to my great
                  surprise and joy, the familiar face of Doctor Maxwell.</p>
               <p>The surgeon was hardly able to believe his senses, when I made myself known.
                  Instead of the pale-faced, undersized lad of fifteen, he saw a stout, manly
                  fellow, tanned like a Moor. But he received me cordially, and told me that my
                  uncle was a couple of days' journey up the Qua, at the chief negro town. I related
                  my adventures; and a Fishman messenger was shortly dispatched with the news of my
                  resurrection, as Dr. Maxwell called it, whilst I swung my hammock on board the
                  schooner to await his return. The surgeon informed me that he had been to Brazil
                  and the West Indies twice, since their escape from massacre, on the night of the
                  Dahoman attack on our caravan. There had been only one white killed on that
                  occasion, a sailor, whose head I afterward saw. I learned that the Coralline was
                  at a place called Camarones, a couple of hundred miles down the coast from
                  Calabar, and that Captain Willing, in partnership with a rich Spaniard of Rio, was
                  shipping cargoes every month from various stations on the Guinea coast.</p>
               <p>On the fifth day after my arrival, a message came from my uncle that I should join
                  him at once; I bade good bye to the surgeon, who was busy in charge of a new batch
                  of blacks at the station, and set out, in company with a couple of Fishmen, for a
                  tramp inland.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE country about the Qua River is a very fine one. The forest which we travelled
                  was full of game and fruits. Pine-apples, cocoa-nuts, citrous, and guavas, were
                  everywhere to be seen; and we passed through two small villages of negroes, where
                  yams, sweet potatoes, and wild sugar-cane were growing abundantly. The Fishmen
                  told me that all this territory had been once covered with thriving towns, and the
                  pastures filled with flocks and herds; but the slave-hunts had broken up the
                  settlements, and thinned the population to a few scattered families. I saw some
                  cultivation of the soil going on by women, but scarcely any full-grown men. These
                  women were mild and kind, treating us to milk and yams, and preparing huts for us
                  to sleep in.</p>
               <p>I found my uncle at a large negro town, called Gambo, and was welcomed cordially.
                  He told me my knowledge of negro tongues would render me useful as his
                  interpreter, and congratulated me on my manly looks. Next day I was presented to
                  the negro King of Gambo, who was called Ephraim. I found some difference between
                  the language of the Foolas and Dahomans, and that of the Gambo nation, but soon
                  contrived to pick up a stock of new words.</p>
               <p>My uncle was making up a kaffle of slaves from several lots brought in by hunting
                  parties. A <foreign>kaffle</foreign> is the common name for a train of slaves
                  driven to the rivers or sea-coast. My uncle had a standing bargain for supplies,
                  so there was no chaffering concerning prices. He bought by the twenties, allowing
                  so much merchandise for each score of picked negroes. A thirty-gallon keg of
                  brandy, a half dozen pieces of colored cottons, and twenty-five pounds of
                  gunpowder, were given for any prime lot. Different articles, such as iron
                  spear-heads, coral beads, tobacco, and gilt trinkets, were exchanged
                  proportionately for other lots. When the slaves were brought in by the hunters,
                  they were fastened to stakes driven in the ground, by couples. Every morning my
                  uncle went out to inspect a new batch driven in during the night. A mulatto
                  overseer was his principal examiner—a burly, savage fellow, who knocked the poor
                  blacks about without mercy. He would fell a negro senseless on the slightest
                  provocation, and was constantly lashing them with a knotted leather whip. I
                  ventured to remonstrate with my uncle about such treatment of the slaves, and was
                  told that this mulatto was considered the best kaffle-driver on the coast. "He
                  makes the black rascals think him the devil," said Captain Willing, "and that
                  insures their respect."</p>
               <p>"But," I said, "these blacks appear to be good-tempered and mild, uncle?"</p>
               <p>"Very good," laughed my uncle, "and Shakoe takes care to keep them so! Let him
                  alone, Phil, or he may do you an ill turn some day!" This caution closed my
                  mouth.</p>
               <p>The business of inspection and choice of stock was done in a shady wood, near the
                  centre of the town, where my uncle's quarters were. Shakoe's whip cracked a signal
                  for each squad's arrival; and my uncle, in shirt and duck trowsers, with a
                  palm-leaf hat, walked up and down the fettered line, smoking his cigar. Shakoe was
                  a sort of negro doctor as well as overseer, and could tell an unsound slave almost
                  by a glance. He handled the naked blacks from head to foot, squeezing their joints
                  and muscles, twisting their arms and legs, examining teeth, eyes, and chest, and
                  pinching breasts and groins without mercy. The slaves stood in couples, stark
                  naked, and were made to jump, cry out, lie down, and roll, and hold their breath
                  for a long time. Women and girls were used no more gently than the men by this
                  mulatto inspector.</p>
               <p>The day before we were to start from Gambo, the <emph>branding</emph> was done;
                  and a deal of flogging had to be done also, to keep the frightened negroes quiet.
                  Shakoe's lash and the heavy whips of his assistant negroes were not a moment idle.
                  The slaves were fetched up singly, made to lie down on their faces, and thus held
                  by a big negro, whilst another kept the branding irons hot in a fire close by, and
                  a third applied them between the shoulders of the shrieking wretches. At first
                  there was horrible yelling, for the poor people expected to be tortured to death;
                  and I was called upon to talk to them in their own lingo, though my assurances had
                  not much effect. Shakoe plied his leather till it became actually crusted with
                  blood.</p>
               <p>After the scourgings and brandings were through with for that day, the negroes
                  were allowed double rations of rice, yams, and beans, and then coupled for the
                  march. That night King Ephraim gave a feast to my uncle, and a slave sacrifice was
                  made to the fetish for good luck. The sick, maimed, and feeble negroes, discarded
                  by my uncle in making up his kaffle, supplied victims enough for this occasion,
                  and several of them were cut to pieces before we started from Gambo.</p>
               <p>Our march to the river was a painful one. Shakoe and his assistant "devils," as
                  the slaves, no doubt, considered them all, marked their way with blood. When we
                  reached the Qua, and marched along its banks to the Calabar depot, I let the whole
                  kaffle pass me, and the slaves presented a deplorable appearance as they moved
                  along, scarred and bleeding. I began to look upon the overseer with abhorrence,
                  and thought his systematic cruelty useless; but my uncle laughed at my scruples,
                  and said, "Let Shakoe alone, Phil; he understands his business better than you
                  do."</p>
               <p>Our kaffle numbered one hundred and fifty full-grown males and females, and about
                  a hundred youths of both sexes. I had seen the process of close packing in Captain
                  Fraley's sloops on the Gambia; but I felt puzzled to know how two forty-ton
                  schooners were to stow our freight, as Captain Willing assured me was
                  intended.</p>
               <p>Dr. Maxwell and the two skippers of the vessels were at the station to receive us.
                  Here the kaffle was overhauled and barber's work done. The heads of all slaves,
                  without distinction of age or sex, were shaved, and they were scrubbed with sand,
                  standing in the water. The schooners were fitted with bulkheads, in the fashion of
                  regular slavers, and the sexes divided on each side. The largest males were packed
                  first in the hold, sitting cross-legged in rows, back to back. They faced each
                  other closely, and a hundred were thus crammed into each schooner under decks. The
                  women and girls were all stowed in one hold. After securing these below, about
                  fifty were tied around the masts and rails of both vessels; and by this time every
                  available foot of space had been covered with black flesh. As it was now
                  impossible to shift these people while we were in the river, they were served with
                  their rations from wooden buckets, let down by bamboo poles to each row.</p>
               <p>Our departure was speedy, as the rainy season sets in after the first of June,<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6322-00000027"/> and it was then May, whilst my uncle had
                  several other ventures on the coast. We made good progress down the Calabar, and
                  arrived safely at Camarones in five days, losing only three boys and two girls,
                  who were suffocated in the hold, and thrown overboard at sea. At Camarones we
                  found the Coralline, waiting for her freight, and I soon trod her familiar decks.
                  Here, likewise, much to my gratification, I regained my Boston sea-chest, with its
                  little stock of worldly effects; among the rest, my "Robinson Crusoe," and some
                  other books, keepsakes of poor Dr. Thady. My journal, too, was safe, as I had left
                  it in the chest on board our schooner, at Rio Volta; so I recommenced my diary,
                  and began to feel at home, for the first time in nearly three years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>May 8<hi rend="i"/>th, 1808.—This day, after twenty-seven months'
                  wandering, captivity, and various adventures, I resume my journal, on board the
                  Coralline, Captain Willing. Last night I passed ashore, with my uncle, who is
                  looking after the shipment of a thousand slaves, to Brazil and the West Indies.
                  The barracoon is a large building near the landing-place, and some two thousand
                  blacks are collected there. We lodged in a room over the ground floor where these
                  negroes are confined. I was unable to sleep on account of the noise of their
                  groans and complaints. They kept up a mournful chanting all night, in spite of
                  repeated lashings by the keepers.</p>
               <p>This morning the loading was commenced early. The blacks were all stripped naked
                  and shipped by twos and threes, in canoes through the surf. Our brig, the
                  Coralline, is to carry seven hundred. Her bulkhead is secured strongly, and double
                  decks laid, two feet apart. Two carronades are mounted, so as to sweep the hold,
                  in case of a rising of the slaves, which sometimes, I hear, takes place before
                  they are permanently secured. My uncle says the Coralline is better fitted for
                  carrying slaves than any vessel of her burden on the coast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>May 9<hi rend="i"/>th.—Our cargo is safely stowed. The blacks are
                  shackled down in tiers, on the decks, sitting between each other's legs, fore and
                  aft. One slave deck rests on stanchions, over the water stowage. The blacks are
                  strung across in gangs of six or eight, according to size, and their ankle-bolts
                  are secured by two rods of iron running midships, and padlocked in the centre.
                  When the rods are drawn out, the shackles drop, and a gang can take its turn to go
                  on deck for air.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>May 10<hi rend="i"/>th.—To-day has been a busy day. The slaves are
                  all below, and the Coralline sails to-morrow for the Indies. I think the
                  arrangements for the slaves are excellent. My uncle tells me they are to get two
                  meals a day, of boiled beans or rice; each has a light wooden dish and spoon tied
                  about the neck, and every gang is to be allowed a pipe and tobacco once a day, to
                  pass around. Besides this, my uncle says, the gangs are to come on deck, in fine
                  weather, to dance and enjoy themselves. So the poor people will take a good deal
                  of comfort. This slave trade is not such a bad thing after all. My uncle says it
                  is a necessary evil. I think he is getting rich.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>May 11<hi rend="i"/>th.—Out at sea, running before a fine breeze;
                  everything in order. Dr. Maxwell and myself dined with my uncle to-day, and he was
                  quite pleasant; more than I ever knew him to be before. He advises me to study
                  navigation. I intend to do it.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>May 20<hi rend="i"/>th.—To-day has been an exciting one on board the
                  Coralline. We had a revolt, or nearly so, of the whole black cargo. Shakoe, my
                  uncle's mulatto over-seer, is dead, and some twenty slaves have been thrown
                  overboard, dead and wounded. It seems that this revolt has been threatened for
                  some days. Dr. Maxwell was told by a sick boy last week, that the negroes has
                  threatened to kill Shakoe, but my uncle laughed at the threat. The mulatto was
                  hated by every slave on board, and it appears that this morning a slave struck him
                  with his shackle, while on deck, and then jumped overboard. Shakoe became furious,
                  and rushed down into the hold, cutting right and left with his whip. By some
                  means, a gang got loose, and broke off the iron rod that had fastened their ring
                  bolts. They attacked Shakoe, and beat his brains out, and succeeded in liberating
                  half a dozen other gangs, and getting on deck all together. Our watch, and the
                  negro sentinels, immediately fired their muskets into the crowd of naked blacks,
                  who had begun to arm themselves with handspikes, buckets, and any other missile to
                  be found loose. Dr. Maxwell and I were on deck at the time, and Captain Willing
                  came up in a hurry, with a loaded pistol in each hand. Our white crew rushed aft,
                  and the mate served out arms, with which the blacks were driven back, though not
                  before two sailors were killed and one wounded. It was a terrible affair, while it
                  lasted. The negroes fought like wild beasts, and had they succeeded in releasing
                  all below, we should have been overpowered and every one of us slaughtered.
                  Thirteen blacks were shot on the deck, and seven wounded seriously. All these were
                  flung into the sea, and the other rebels, about a dozen, secured again. It was a
                  narrow escape for the brig. I begin to think this slaving a dangerous business at
                  sea, as well as ashore. That rascally Shakoe deserved his fate, for he abused the
                  blacks shamefully. His head was all beaten to pieces—a ghastly sight, and the
                  negroes tore his whip into bits not bigger than my finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>July 15<hi rend="i"/>th, Berbice, in Guiana.—We arrived at this
                  place yesterday. My uncle expects to get high prices for the cargo, as there is
                  understood to be a scarcity of help on the plantations. This is a very gay town;
                  the streets are full of belles and beaux, in handsome clothes. I went with my
                  uncle this morning, to call on the Dutch governor, who received us kindly. There
                  was a large party of Indians in the grounds of the government house. They sat on
                  the grass, eating crabs, which they stewed along with cabbage and capsicum in
                  cooking pots made of baked clay. They were copper-faced people, with long black
                  hair, and nearly naked. I hear they are in town to get their rations of rum and
                  powder. Wherever these Indians go, they make their squaws, or women, carry the
                  cooking vessels, hammocks, calabashes, and crab-baskets on their backs. The men
                  walk on, with their bows and arrows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>July 16.—The great market sale of slaves has been going on all day.
                  The Dutch planters are buying our cargo up at good prices. Some of the Dutch maids
                  are good looking, in their short green jackets and scarlet petticoats; they moved
                  about, inspecting the naked Africans, as if it was a common thing. Half our blacks
                  were sold at to-day's vendue. The auctioneer sat in a high chair, at one end of
                  the large room, and the slaves stood on a stool in front of him. He made them turn
                  round about, as they stood, in their breech-cloths, before the people; and the
                  purchasers walked up and felt of them, to try their flesh and soundness. The
                  darkies were obliged to go through every sort of motion; it appeared as if their
                  limbs would be pulled out of joint, or their jaws cracked by some of the Dutch
                  boors; one dame was not satisfied till she forced a wench to screech by squeezing
                  her breast cruelly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>July 17.—The vendue is over, and our cargo is scattered among the
                  Berbice planters. The full grown fellows fetched as high as one thousand guilders,
                  and the boys, girls, and women from seven hundred to eight hundred guilders, which
                  are considered good prices. Some curious scenes took place at the sale, showing
                  that blacks have feelings as well as whites. One poor negro man, tall and
                  well-formed, was sulky, and refused to show himself off to advantage, till a young
                  and good looking negress was brought in and placed beside him; then he started
                  forward, held up two fingers, and pointed to the girl, knelt down, and clasped his
                  hands, and showed, by all his motions, that he wanted to be sold with his wife;
                  she ran to him, and clasped him in her arms, crying and putting out her hands,
                  till at last the auctioneer decided to sell them together, at which they seemed
                  almost beside themselves with joy. This pair brought seventeen hundred
                  guilders.</p>
               <p>Leaving Berbice, the Coralline made a quick run to Rio de Janeiro, where I was
                  introduced to my uncle's partner, Don Joam de Cobral, a Portuguese trader of great
                  wealth. At this time I was taken into my uncle's confidence somewhat, and learned
                  that he had accumulated a considerable fortune. Don Joam was a stout man, past
                  middle age, and lived in style at a country house in the mountains, a few miles
                  from Rio. He had a dozen illegitimate children, whom he was educating, and lived
                  with their mothers on his large estate. Donna Maria, a quadroon girl, sixteen
                  years old, was at her father's house when I went there first, in company with my
                  uncle, and entertained us with<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6322-00000028"/> playing on
                  the harp and singing. She was the handsomest young woman, with Negro blood in her
                  veins, that I ever saw. This girl, with several brothers and sisters, was
                  afterward sold, to pay her father's creditors, when he failed in 1813. At the time
                  I saw him, however, Don Joam was considered to be a millionaire.</p>
               <p>One day, shortly after our arrival at Rio, my uncle took me to walk on the public
                  promenade, overlooking the bay, and we sat down to coffee and cigars in one of the
                  shaded booths. Here he informed me that he had withdrawn from partnership with Don
                  Joam, and that he now owned the Coralline and several schooners, without a
                  partner. I then learned, for the first time, that the English government had
                  abolished the slave trade with her colonies, and that henceforth no slaver could
                  sail under the British flag. "Captain Fraley," said my uncle, "has broken up his
                  coast establishments, and left the field clear for us. The Coralline is now a
                  Spanish vessel, and you and I, Phil, must sink our English birthrights, and resign
                  all claims to our large estates in Stockford."</p>
               <p>I laughed at my uncle's joke, and expressed myself as ready to sail under Spanish
                  colors as any other.</p>
               <p>"You do well, Phil," he replied, "and you sha'n't regret your choice. You are
                     <unclear>able in</unclear> learning foreign lingos, and when you master
                  navigation you'll be worth double to me. Maxwell and I part company here, and if
                  you like to stake his place in the brig, you can do so."</p>
               <p>"I hardly think I am competent to fill a surgeon's berth," I answered.</p>
               <p>"Gammon!" said my uncle, "you're not called on to be a court physician. Brimstone
                  and molasses, calomel and jalap, and salt water in buckets, are Maxwell's whole
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">materia medica,</foreign> and I think you can take a
                  hand at them as well as he."</p>
               <p>"Where is Dr. Maxwell going, uncle?"</p>
               <p>"He drops his kedge here in the Brazils, with Bob Floss, who has risen from a poor
                  overseer to be an owner, and drives a heavy home business in wool and ivory."</p>
               <p>I remembered Mr. Floss and his "fly-brush" very well, and thought our old surgeon
                  would have enough to do with sick blacks under such a master.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this conversation with my uncle, the Coralline shipped a new crew of
                  Portuguese and Spaniards. Captain Willing and myself remained, the only Englishmen
                  on board when we left Rio, with a new cargo of rum, coarse cotton cloth, tobacco,
                  and gunpowder, with dried beef and oatmeal as provisions. Our destination, as
                  before, was the Guinea coast; and I now quote from such portions of my journal as
                  contain matters of interest:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 3<hi rend="i"/>d, 1808.—Cast anchor to-day off Cape Palmas,
                  African coast, and shipped forty Kroo fisherman, with their canoes. This part of
                  the coast is considered to be a fine field for the traffic. My uncle intends
                  establishing a station on one of the rivers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 6<hi rend="i"/>th.—We have chopped down to this place called
                  Assinam, a couple of miles from the mouth of a river said to be populous. Our
                  Kroomen are engaged in setting up sheds, and we are to have a grand <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">palabra</foreign> with the natives, who have sent messengers to
                  negotiate. The country hereabouts is ruled by a black king named Prince Vinegar.
                  He must be a sour sort of fellow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 8<hi rend="i"/>th.—Our trading post is quite a respectable
                  place already. The river bends at this point, making a little harbor, and the
                  shore is thick with grass down to the sandy beach, the forest behind making a
                  semi-circle. Our Kroos got the assistance of some hundred blacks, and we have a
                  picket fence and covered sheds, to shelter goods. Pots are boiling, hammers and
                  saws sounding, and canoes running back and forth to the brig, which commands the
                  whole beach with her guns. There is safe anchorage here, and the river is
                  navigable for the brig some thirty or forty miles up, so it is said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 9<hi rend="i"/>th:—King Vinegar and his chiefs visited us
                  yesterday, for a <foreign xml:lang="SPA">palabra.</foreign> King Vinegar reminds
                  me of my old father-in-law, King Mammee, of Yallaba. Poor Sooluh! What has become
                  of her? She was an affectionate girl, and I think of her often. King Vinegar is
                  fat and old, with a skin shining like black lead polish. He is called quite a
                  powerful monarch in this region, and came attended by five hundred warriors and
                  slaves, bringing several of his wives. My uncle treated him with a "dash" or
                  present of a couple of thirty-gallon kegs of rum, served out in rations to the
                  principal men. It is understood that we are to hold undisputed possession of this
                  part of the coast, and my uncle is to have jurisdiction from a point just above
                  this place, to the sea, more than two miles of fine country. This jurisdiction
                  includes the power of life and death over any negro, under the rank of prince, who
                  may come within our domain. The same power is exercised by every black king over
                  all persons in his territory. So my uncle is now <foreign>Moneego,</foreign> or
                  prince-born, as far as the station is concerned. My uncle is now known as Don
                  Ricardo, and my name is transmogrified into Felipe. So we are called by the crew,
                  and so we shall pass, if we chance to be overhauled by British armed vessels, and
                  there are several now on the coast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov, 10<hi rend="i"/>th.—My uncle has told me his plans about future
                  operations. The British slave trade ended in July last, but there are many British
                  Liverpool and Scotch vessels on the coast now, with full cargoes. Don Ricardo
                  intends to make our new settlement a depot for these, and we shall run cargoes to
                  the Brazils. We have landed a couple of carronades, and will soon have a
                  respectable station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 11<hi rend="i"/>th.—To day arrived the Loango, one of my
                  uncle's schooners, from the Congo. She is anchored off our settlement, which Don
                  Ricardo has christened Rio Basso. In her came a Spaniard, Don Miguel Barca, a
                  crony of my uncle, who is to be factor at this place. He seems a pleasant fellow,
                  about thirty, with white teeth, which he shows a great deal. To day King Vinegar
                  sent us a couple of bullocks and a milch cow.</p>
               <p>The above extracts from my journal commence to record the routine life I led at
                  Rio Basso, during five years that I remained there. The settlement grew to be one
                  of the most thriving on the windward coast, and was the means of saving scores of
                  British merchants from ruin, if it did no good otherwise. By means of our fast
                  schooners, together with the Coralline and an American built brig, just her mate,
                  called the Florida, we kept up a constant tapping of the coast, from Cape Palmas
                  to the Rio Gambia, whence Captain Fraley's stations were still supplied with
                  negroes. My uncle received the cargoes at Rio Basso, transshipped them to his own
                  or other legal bottoms, and coined money by every operation. His brokerage was
                  from a fifth to a half of each cargo, according as he shipped in his own or other
                  vessels.</p>
               <p>Don Miguel Barca was a experienced factor, and under his management, Rio Basso
                  station soon grew noted as a slave factory, and became a resort for vessels in
                  which British subjects still continued to have interest, We soon had extensive
                  barracoons erected on the mainland and several small islands in the wide channel
                  of the river. My uncle made several voyages in the Coralline with full cargoes,
                  and became noted in Africa and the West Indies as a shrewd and successful trader,
                  who never lost a cargo, though privateers were swarming every sea. During all this
                  time, I officiated as a sort of port-surgeon and apothecary, and got to be pretty
                  well skilled in the treatment of white men as well as negroes. My own experience
                  helped me not a little; for I was sick nearly two months under the coast fever,
                  which gave me a hard turn.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>FACTORY life in Africa is no desirable lot for a civilized being; but the five
                  years of my situation at Rio Basso passed without much tediousness. My uncle had
                  made a liberal contract for my services, agreeing to allow me three negroes per
                  month to ship on my own account; and the prospect of laying up a snug sum before
                  reaching majority was a tempting one to a youth like me. I made myself familiar
                  with King Vinegar's people on the river, and visited many black nations further
                  inland. Don Miguel was a hasty tempered man, but sociable and good natured in the
                  main, and we got on very well together. He played the grand lord in Rio Basso, and
                  could get more work out of our blacks the first year than I supposed possible.
                  Under his management we had a couple of hundred darkies constantly employed in
                  cutting down trees, and assisting our white force, which numbered twenty,
                  Spaniards, Portuguese, and Dutchmen. Besides being surgeon, I was accountant and
                  paymaster, and had to settle with King Vinegar and other chiefs for provisions
                  which they sent in. All this time we were loading and transhipping cargoes of
                  slaves from various parts of the coast. As soon as our barracoons were ready they
                  were filled with stock, and no vessel had to wait an extra day for lack of
                  negroes, during the early years of Rio Basso's settlement.</p>
               <p>Our first accomodations were poor enough, tents and hovels being the only shelter;
                  but before the rains, we got under a commodious roof, and in the course of a year
                  I had a house to myself, separate from that of Don Miguel. The manager's was
                  larger than mine, and this was necessary, for the Don's family was extensive in
                  the female line; he had two quarteroon wives from the Verds, and I know not how
                  many favorites, of mulatto and even darker hues. Our barracoons, as the slave-pens
                  are called, were built close to the river, and on an island about a hundred yards
                  in the stream, thickly grown with man-grove-bushes, bamboos, and palm-trees. They
                  were constructed of cane, matted with vine, and plastered with mud, the whole
                  strengthened by uprights and picket barriers. Into these capacious receptacles the
                  slaves were driven on arrival, and placed in charge of gangsmen of their own
                  color. The gangsmen superintended the head-shaving, washing, and branding, and saw
                  that the blacks were duly secured every night to posts driven in the ground. The
                  proportion of gangsmen was one to twenty slaves, and they took turns standing
                  guard, with whips, through the nights, to keep order.</p>
               <p>We had a quarantine hospital built on a little island further down the river, for
                  treatment of sick stock, and a burial-place in the sand behind. I instructed a
                  dozen intelligent blacks in the mysteries of simple drugging, cupping, and
                  blistering, and in a short time could boast of quite a medical board. We were
                  generally lucky with our patients, and lost a small average. Out of seventy-two
                  two thousand slaves received and transhipped from Rio Basso, in five years, we
                  lost only eight thousand; and this included deaths by accidental drowning,
                  suicides, and by a smallpox epidemic in 1811, when our barracoons were crowded,
                  and when we shipped thirty thousand souls to Brazil and the West Indies.</p>
               <p>A year after the establishment of barracoons at Rio Basso, the colony of free
                  negroes planted by the British abolitionists at Sierra Leone, near the old
                  Portuguese factories, was taken possession of by the British government, and an
                  English man-of-war was stationed on the coast. My uncle's policy was then found
                  completely successful. His schooners coasted up and down, running into rivers and
                  creeks, where English factories still kept up inland connections, and bringing
                  down cargoes to Rio Basso under the Portuguese, Spanish, and French flags. If
                  boarded by a British cruiser, my uncle or his captains could always show papers
                  corresponding with the flag carried; and he was so good a linguist himself that,
                  with his swarthy face, he could pass for any countryman, besides his own. His
                  English name was twisted into Spanish as Ricardo Villeno.</p>
               <p>But I must hurry over this part of my life to the next voyage I made, from Rio
                  Basso to the Floridas, and its dismal records, as entered in my journal of that
                  year:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Oct. 28, 1812.—Left Rio Basso this day in the Boa Morte, formerly an
                  American trader, now owned by Don Ricardo Villeno, my respectable uncle. She is
                  commanded by a creole of St. Domingo, Pierre Leclerc, and bound for Pensacola, in
                  the Floridas, with a cargo of nine hundred slaves. Monsieur Leclerc is a peppery
                  little fellow, an old slaver, and has an interest in the freight. The second
                  officer is Diego Ramos, a Portuguese from Fayal, and we three were in the
                  round-house, as every inch of space is occupied by the blacks, cabin and hold
                  knocked into slave decks, and packed tight at that. The stock is healthy, however,
                  and we look for a profitable trip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Oct. 30.—Leclerc is reckoning up his anticipated profits, and I may
                  as well do the same. I have one hundred prime blacks—only twenty females—all
                  branded, in good Spanish, with my name, "Felippe Drax," and I begin to feel the
                  anxieties of a property owner. My little venture, at present prices, ought to
                  bring me $8,000—a tolerable set-up, with a little stock left on hand at Rio Basso.
                  I shall invest in profitable goods, as my uncle advises, and go back prepared to
                  begin trade for my own profit. I can find no fault with my uncle; the Don has
                  become rather moody of late, but he has kept his business word, and I have to
                  thank him for a good start in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 1.—Everything prosperous, only three sick cases, low fever.
                  Quinine will make them all right, though the sharks are following us, as if they
                  smelt sickness. Leclerc and I have had a chat to day about this African business.
                  He says he's repugnant to it, and I confess it's not a thing I like. But, as my
                  uncle argues, slaves must be bought and sold; somebody must do the trading; and
                  why not make hay while the sun shines?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 2.—Pedro, my assistant, reports one of our patients blind. We
                  had half the gangs on deck to day for exercise; they danced and sung, under the
                  driver's whip, but are far from sprightly. Captain Leclerc says he never knew such
                  a sluggish set; yet they all appear healthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 3.—Bad news. We have ophthalmia among the slaves, decidedly,
                  and spreading. Eight are reported as blind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 4.—Captain Leclerc is sick, confined to his berth. The
                  ophthalmia is spreading among the blacks. I have nineteen on deck, under
                  treatment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 7.—My God! That scourge of destruction, the smallpox, has
                  broken out. Leclerc is down with it, and two of the crew, and I fear it is among
                  the slaves, We are threatened with foul weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 14.—I make another entry in my journal. God knows whether I
                  shall ever reach port alive. The Boa Morte is well named. It is a death ship, and
                  has been<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6322-00000030"/> feeding the sharks with corpses
                  for seven days past. I have not slept a dozen hours during the week, and it is now
                  Sunday evening, and a fit Sabbath day for a slaver, perhaps. Death and despair on
                  every side. Last Tuesday the smallpox began to rage, and we hauled sixty corpses
                  out of the hold. Diego Ramos can hardly control the crew, and we have to rely on
                  gangs of slaves to drag the dead heaps from among the living. Captain Leclerc is
                  out of danger, but remains blind with ophthalmia. God help us all, if this goes
                  on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 15.—I have got through another day and night, and am yet alive.
                  Diego Ramos and a half dozen sailors, are all of the crew to be relied on. We
                  stimulate the blacks with rum, in order to get their help in removing corpses;
                  thirty negroes and two Portuguese sailors were thrown overboard to-day. I have
                  been among the blacks in a reckless way, under the artificial excitement of
                  laudanum and liquor, and the sights I witnessed, may I never look on such again.
                  This is a dreadful trade. Leclerc says it sometimes drives men crazy, and I think
                  it is no wonder. A few days more of this infernal pest ship will make me insane, I
                  really believe. Diego Ramos says, if we had known it in time, we might have saved
                  our cargo, by poisoning the first cases; but who could foresee its spread in this
                  manner. Some of the blacks are raving mad, and screech like wild beasts. Diego
                  Ramos says we might close the hatches, and suffocate all below, as a last resort;
                  but Captain Leclerc will not hear to that alternative. Besides, we have near seven
                  hundred still, and may save half. And my venture is among the saved ones as yet;
                  not one of my band has gone overboard, so Diego says. Lucky, but will it be so
                  long?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 16.—The Boa Morte is a floating hell. Our drunken negroes
                  almost command the ship. Diego Ramos was obliged to shoot one to-day, or the
                  fellow might have strangled him. Never can such scenes be imagined as we witness
                  every day. I wonder how Diego can keep so cool; I wonder that I am not sick,
                  blind, or crazy with the rest. Captain Leclerc, I believe, is dying. He is
                  sleeping now, while I am writing, and his face is like a sheet, in whiteness. He
                  asked me to read a chapter in his French Gospel to-day. It was the first time I
                  had seen the Scriptures since I left McIntosh's shop. What a life I have led since
                  then—what a youth, and manhood!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 17.—We have had a violent storm, and the hatches are closed.
                  The work of death goes on unseen. Captain Leclerc is better to day, and begins to
                  see a little. God grant he may recover! Diego Ramos is still well, and so am I,
                  after all we have gone through; but what would tempt me to pass such another ten
                  days as the last? Not all the wealth of the Indies! Leclerc is quite serious and
                  intends to abandon the slave traffic. He says to-day he thought it an accursed
                  thing; I told Diego Ramos, and he laughed, remarking that the "devil was sick, and
                  wanted to turn monk." I feel scruples myself about this matter, in spite of
                  Diego's ridicule. If I get my $8,000 for the slaves—should they survive—I am
                  inclined to invest it in some other business in a more civilized way. It is a
                  horrible night, the lightning glaring, the wind roaring, and the ship tossing! I
                  think Captain Leclerc is right. I hope I shall never be so hardened as Ramos. That
                  fellow would laugh at the gallows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 19.—Thanks be to God! We are alive, on a steady sea, after
                  experiencing a most frightful hurricane. Yesterday even Diego Ramos thought we
                  were lost. The sun went down red, as the previous night, and Diego prophesied a
                  continuance of the tempest, which before terrified us. The wind shifted to the
                  west, the sky grew black as ink, and was filled with fiery appearances. The
                  thunder roared and lightning flashed incessantly. Our ship was whirled about like
                  a top, and driven before the gale, nearly all night, without a rag of canvas. We
                  heard guns during the storm, but have seen no sail, though we are approaching the
                  Mexican Gulf to-day. Captain Leclerc is on deck, very feeble, but able to see once
                  more. Diego Ramos advises not to open the hatches, till we reach port, which we
                  hope to do by sunset, if the wind continues fair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 20.—Anchored last night in Pensacola Bay.</p>
               <p>The voyage of the Boa Morte terminated at Pensacola Bay, after we had landed our
                  surviving negroes on one of the shallow beaches near the mouth of the Escambia
                  River. Here, with the assistance of laborers from the neighboring ing town, we
                  rigged sheds for our sick, and took measures for lime-washing and fumigating the
                  ship. Strange as it may seem, we saved five hundred and nineteen out of our nine
                  hundred; and, much to my satisfaction, sixty-four of these had my brand, so that I
                  was not such a loser as I expected to be.</p>
               <p>Captain Leclerc was as good as his word. He sold the Boa Morte to the house of
                  Bernard &amp; Co., at the Matanzas, and closed his accounts with my uncle's
                  consignees. After settlement of all our business, I found myself entitled to
                  $6,430, proceeds of my negroes. Diego Ramos came in for his own share of luck, as
                  the captain presented him with fifty slaves, in testimony of his skill and
                  services, which, no doubt, saved the ship and all on board. After resting a few
                  days at St. Augustine, where I took a final leave of Captain Leclerc, I agreed to
                  accompany Diego on a land trip through the United States, where a
                     <foreign>kaffle</foreign> of negroes was to precede us, for whose disposal the
                  shrewd Portuguese had already made arrangements with my uncle's consignees.</p>
               <p>I soon learned how readily, and at what profits, the Florida negroes were sold
                  into the neighboring American States. The <foreign>kaffle,</foreign> under charge
                  of negro drivers, was to strike up the Escambia River, and thence cross the
                  boundary into Georgia, where some of our wild Africans were mixed with various
                  squads of native blacks, and driven inland, till sold off, singly or by couples,
                  on the road. At this period (1812) the United States had declared the African
                  slave trade illegal, and passed stringent laws to prevent the importation of
                  negroes; yet the Spanish possessions were thriving on this inland exchange of
                  negroes and mulattoes; Florida was a sort of nursery for slave-breeders, and many
                  American citizens grew rich by trafficking in Guinea negroes, and smuggling them
                  continually, in small parties, through the southern United States. At the time I
                  mention, the business was a lively one, owing to the war then going on between the
                  States and England, and the unsettled condition of affairs on the border.</p>
               <p>Diego Ramos spoke English as well as I did Spanish, and we passed very well for a
                  couple of southern merchants. I had taken drafts on Philadelphia for the amount of
                  my credit with the house of Bernard &amp; Co., and was able to make a show of
                  ready money, and indulge in a little display at our hotels. Diego, with an eye to
                  business, looked after the sale of the negro squads, and, through his means, I
                  became a guest on many plantations on our line of travel. I had an opportunity of
                  studying the practical working of slavery in a civilized and democratic country,
                  as I had seen it in the huts and rice fields of the Volta and Gambia rivers and in
                  the Brazilian empire. I was also enabled to estimate the influence of civilization
                  on the Congo and Ashantee stock after a generation or two, and compare their
                  condition on American plantations with their native life in African forests. What
                  I saw and what I thought, in my journey from Florida to Philadelphia, in 1813, may
                  be gleaned from a few brief notes then made and copied afterward into my
                  journal:</p>
               <p>I have begun to jot down my impressions of these States for future reference. Last
                  night I passed, with Diego Ramos, at a plantation on the river, which they call
                  the Ockmulgee. Mr. Olds, our host, was very frank on the subject of slave-holding,
                  and is an opponent of the traffic, though a large planter of cotton. He spoke of
                  the treatment of "black boys," as they are termed by many of his neighbors. A case
                  had lately occurred of a "boy" being hung up by the wrists to a tree, with a
                  wooden rail tied to his feet, and beaten by his master till he expired under the
                  torture. This cruelty was perpetrated on suspicion of a petty theft, which had
                  been committed by the master's little son, who afterward confessed to the fact. I
                  enquired what punishment was inflicted on the owner, and was told that the subject
                  had been talked over, but no complaint made. A slave's testimony is not taken<pb
                     n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6322-00000031"/> against a white man; and any crime may be
                  done in presence of a black, by his master, without fear of detection. Mr. Olds
                  called up a black fellow, who had been in his family for fifty years, since his
                  birth. This negro is his master's confidential servant, and is trusted to go into
                  the town weekly to draw money from the bankers. He has a wife and children very
                  faithful and industrious, and they are all emancipated by provision of our host's
                  last will and testament, as he himself assured us. Such are the lights and shades
                  of slavery.</p>
               <p>In Carolina I have become acquainted with several wealthy farmers. Slave merchants
                  drive their kaffles in gangs of ten over the highways, and have pens in the
                  principal villages, where they hold vendues. The number of mulattoes is
                  astonishing. I am told by residents that illicit connections between whites and
                  negroes are much more common than formerly. I have noticed some really handsome
                  quadroon men and women on the auction block, the latter commanding double prices
                  this indicates the state of morals among the white population.</p>
               <p>Cultivation of the land in the slave territory is slovenly done, compared with
                  Brazil and Guiana. There is much waste of labor in all operations. I have seen a
                  gang of blacks, with two oxen, engaged a whole morning in drawing a log of timber
                  from the river, to build a house a few miles off. In Rio Basso we should have a
                  dozen cut down and shifted by such a force in the same space of time. The slaves
                  hereabouts are well treated and fat, though nearly naked or ragged; the men wear
                  linsey woolsey shirts and trowsers, the women a petticoat of coarse ducking, and
                  all go barefoot. I have seen boys and girls of fifteen on the plantations, without
                  a stitch of covering, in full sight of their master's verandas. Licentiousness is
                  so common in this country that no one seems to remark it.</p>
               <p>In Virginia I found the oldest plantations, and well stocked; but the practice of
                  intercourse between whites and negroes is ruining the slaves for usefulness. A
                  respectable citizen of Fredericksburg, on the Rappahannock River, told me that
                  slave-breeding is getting to be the most profitable business in this quarter.
                  Whole farms are used as nurseries to supply the market with young mulattoes of
                  both sexes. Irish and Scotch overseers have charge of the gangs. The fertility of
                  the negresses in this country is almost the same as in Africa; on a farm near
                  Alexandria, I counted thirty about to become mothers, and the huts swarmed with
                  pick-aninnies of different shades.</p>
               <p>I heard a story yesterday concerning a slave family, which shows the effects of
                  the system. It seems that a large owner at his death, lately, liberated some
                  thirty odd mulattoes, his own children; but his eldest son and heir, a dissipated
                  white man, succeeded in destroying the writings, and afterward sold his dusky
                  skinned brothers and sisters, with some of his own children, to a company of
                  Georgia slave-dealers. One of the blacks, who had a wife and children, according
                  to slave usage, refused to surrender their liberty, and defended his own by
                  barring his hut and threatening the dealers with concealed firearms. An attack was
                  made by night on the negro, and his hut fired. The slave, with two of his young
                  sons, fought until one of the boys was shot, when the whole family were seized and
                  driven to the river, to be put on board a Georgia sloop. At the beach this
                  desperate fellow made fight again, and was assisted by his wife, a strong wench.
                  The Georgia men were unable to master either, till they had beaten the woman with
                  their muskets. The black tried to swim the river, but was shot at and drowned; and
                  the negress was so badly injured that she is said to be quite valueless. I had
                  this account from an eye-witness, who lived at the place where the affray
                  occurred, called Harper's Ferry, near the seat of government of the American
                  States.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AT Philadelphia, Diego Ramos got notice of a clipper brig just starting for the
                  Cape de Verdes, and a trading voyage. She was the Adelaide, owned by an old
                  shipper named Blackmore at the docks. Our business being over, we took passage in
                  this vessel, and left the Capes of Delaware, December 11th, 1812. We made a short
                  run to Santa Cruz, Isle of Teneriffe; and it was after leaving that place that I
                  encountered an old friend, and suffered new vicissitudes of fortune, as I shall
                  relate.</p>
               <p>Sig. Ramos had proposed to me, while we were on our travels, to join him in an
                  African venture; and I, having confidence in his business qualifications, as well
                  as energy of character, agreed to take half the risk; putting up my ready money
                  with his, which made a capital of $10,000. Our scheme was to buy a vessel at the
                  Verds, or at some African station, and ship a cargo to the West Indies, after my
                  uncle's fashion.</p>
               <p>We had paid our passage to Porto Praya; but some days after leaving Santa Cruz,
                  spoke an English vessel in want of water, which we supplied. This vessel was bound
                  direct for the African coast; and as neither Ramos nor myself had bulky baggage,
                  we promptly made up our minds to bargain for berths on board. The name of this
                  unlucky vessel, as she turned out to me, was the brig Charles, and her commander
                  was named Graham. We congratulated ourselves on our good luck in getting this
                  direct passage, as both Diego and myself were anxious to find ourselves in a way
                  of realizing from our partnership. We found the Charles had other passengers, and
                  soon ascertained that they were English missionaries bound for Africa, with their
                  families and assistants. Diego Ramos pulled a face as long as an Ashautee
                  obi-man's, and we both attended prayers on deck the first evening. Next day I
                  learned that some females were in the party, and that one of the missionaries was
                  sick in the round-house. We were introduced to the Reverend Mr. Butcher, the
                  principal, and caught a glimpse of a sweet-faced young woman, through the door of
                  the round-house. What followed on board the Charles, I copy from the scraps of my
                  journal, which remained to me afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 1, 1813.—This day has carried my memory back to childhood, and
                  to scenes I would rather forget. There is one on board, who does not recognize me,
                  and yet his face is imprinted on my heart. I knew that kind, grey eye, the moment
                  I met its glance, when walking the deck to-day. The sick clergyman is Arthur
                  Jackson, my boyhood's friend, now a missionary, whilst I am—what?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 2.—Arthur and I met to day. Oh! if I dared to make myself known
                  to him!—but what good is it? He has no recollection of me, and my Spanish name,
                  Felippe Drax, can give him no clue. He has his sister with him, a sweet-faced
                  young lady of twenty, and a lovely pair they are, though I fear he is not long for
                  this life. To-day, Diego Ramos made a light remark about <emph>her.</emph> It was
                  mere thoughtlessness on his part; yet I felt ready to strike him. Ramos seems a
                  favorite with these serious missionaries. If they suspected the object that takes
                  us to Africa, I fancy they would give us wide berths.</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6322-00000032"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 3.—Arthur Jackson is going fast. I walked with him, on deck,
                  to-day, and he leaned on my arm. His sister, Mary, is a lovely being. She goes out
                  as her brother's devoted attendant, and watches him like a mother. How I longed to
                  tell Arthur that I have in my chest two small volumes his gift—but no! If Ramos
                  were not here, I might, but what does it matter? We shall part again soon—he to
                  his calling—I to mine. Fate makes our paths separate. The weather is squally, and
                  I fear a coast storm is coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 4.—We have been driving all day under a violent gale. Our
                  topmasts are gone, and the brig leaks badly. Diego and I took our turn at the
                  pumps. I saw Arthur Jackson once, and his sister Mary was on deck twice in the
                  gale, a brave girl as well as beautiful. What a treasure to the man who marries
                  her. This storm is very violent, and there seems no abatement. If the leak gains,
                  we shall be in great danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 5.—I snatch a moment, to take my pen. I have been happier this
                  day than ever before in my life. Mary Jackson clung to my arm, on deck, and I
                  sustained her lovely form. She begged me to come for her brother, if anything
                  happens. Do I need such a prayer? No, sweet angel! I swear to care for both of
                  you, more than for my own safety, to lose my life for yours, if need be.</p>
               <p>I had hardly scrawled the last words in my journal, that fatal night of Jan. 5,
                  1813, when I was called on deck by Diego Ramos. We were sending at a frightful
                  rate; sky and waters were black as ink. Captain Graham was at the wheel, but his
                  efforts to manage the brig were useless. For five hours we drove through the
                  darkness, till at last, with a heavy plunge, the vessel settled on a reef, and the
                  sea broke over her decks in torrents. My first thought was of the round-house, and
                  I just succeeded in getting Arthur Jackson and his sister out, when the whole went
                  by the board. Diego Ramos had secured ropes, and we lashed ourselves in the least
                  exposed position, to await the worst. That night was a terrible one, but to me it
                  seemed short, as I supported Arthur and Mary Jackson, on either side of me,
                  sheltering them as well as I was able, with my heavy mackintosh. At daybreak the
                  gale lulled, and we made out our position. The brig had beaten over a line of
                  reefs, and was fast on the inner edge, in a shallow lagoon. As the sun rose, we
                  could see the mainland about five miles distant. We made preparations for landing,
                  and began to load the boats, as it was evident the brig must go to pieces in
                  twenty-four hours; but our work was soon interrupted by the sudden appearance of a
                  fleet of canoes putting off from the shore. They turned out to contain a tribe of
                  Mandingoes, whom I knew to be fierce and predatory. I counselled negotiation, but
                  Diego Ramos and the captain were for defending the brig, and the result was a
                  conflict, which drove off the blacks, but only for a few hours. They returned in
                  double force, and boarded us. Diego Ramos, poor fellow, was disabled by an arrow,
                  and Captain Graham was killed outright. With the help of some of the crew, I got
                  Arthur Jackson and his sister and my wounded friend, into the long boat, and
                  pushed off, whilst the savages were plundering the ship. We were pursued, but
                  reached the shore, where we were joined by another boat's crew, with the
                  missionaries, and determined to make a stand for our lives against the whole army
                  of blacks. My knowledge of the negro dialects was of good service in a parley that
                  we had, and it was agreed that we should remain unmolested, till such time as we
                  could send a messenger to Goree, which was not far distant, as we had ascertained
                  by our charts, that the brig struck on the Tongui Rocks, about twenty miles south
                  of the river Gambia. The Mandingoes, anxious to complete their sack of the vessel,
                  and escape to their villages, were not disposed to give us further trouble.</p>
               <p>During that day, 6th of January, and the following night, I neither slept nor
                  swallowed a morsel. My mind and body were occupied in care of the missionary
                  brother and sister, and poor Diego Ramos. Arthur Jackson was raving with fever,
                  and lay under a boat sail that I rigged up, Whilst Mary supported his head on her
                  lovely bosom. Next morning the savages finished ransacking the Charles, and drew
                  off some distance from the reef. About noon a sloop with British soldiers from
                  Goree, arrived off the reef, and a boat was sent ashore for us. We were taken to
                  Goree, and there Arthur Jackson was taken in charge by English friends of the
                  mission, and died in less than a week. I saw his sister Mary once only, and
                  received her thanks for my services to her brother. She went back, with Arthur's
                  corpse, to England, and we never met again. That young lady was an angel, if ever
                  there could be one in human form. Diego Ramos recovered from his arrow hurt, being
                  more fortunate than another passenger of the Charles, who was wounded mortally by
                  a poisoned dart. We were both fortunate, in saving our money, which had been
                  secured in pouches, but I lost my chest and a gold watch, that I intended for my
                  uncle. My journal and a few other papers, and some articles of clothing turned up
                  with the specie bags.</p>
               <p>At Goree we chartered a schooner for Rio Basso, and arrived there about the last
                  of January, 1813, where Diego Ramos and myself remained a while, to recruit. The
                  settlement was in a flourishing condition. Several vessels were loading, and the
                  barracoons well supplied. My uncle was absent but Don Miguel gave us good
                  quarters, and I indulged for a while in what Diego called "elegant leisure."</p>
               <p>At this time I was in my twenty-third year, and with my ready cash, could look
                  forward to prospects that my orphan boyhood had never promised. But I began to
                  feel a disrelish for the business of slave-trading. The singular chance that had
                  thrown me in contact with Arthur Jackson and his sister caused me much reflection.
                  My pride and the fear of an exposure of my calling had prevented me from making
                  myself known to the dying missionary, and perhaps, from winning the pity of his
                  sweet sister, if not her love. I could not now refrain from comparing my career
                  with his; my occupation during youth in conveying Africans to miserable bondage,
                  whilst he was fitting himself to bear the light of Christian teaching to the
                  benighted land, and to die a martyr to his devotion. The contrast was bitter to
                  me, but I dwelt upon it till I almost resolved to abandon my contract with Ramos,
                  and bid adieu to Africa forever Had Arthur Jackson lived, I believe I should have
                  sought him out once more, and become another and better being. His death snapped a
                  link that connected me with good, and there was no one living to renew it.
                  Nevertheless, as I said, my reflections were earnest on the subject, and I at last
                  came to the mental determination that in another year, if our partnership should
                  turn out profitable, I would leave Diego Ramos, my uncle, and the coast, to embark
                  in some honorable business. A few extracts from my diary at Rio Basso will explain
                  my feelings about that time.</p>

                  aboard the Pongas, now here. This business appears to be getting worse than ever,
                  and those engaged in it more heartless. The poor blacks in the Pongas are packed
                  liked her-rings, on the sitting plan instead of the horizontal stowage, adopted by
                  the French captains from the Senegal<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"

                        comfort of their living freight. They were amply supplied with bread, salt,
                        and allspice, for slave diet, and each black was provided with a leaden
                        plate, spoon, and tobacco pipe. They slept horizontally on the decks, and in
                        fine weather were made to exercise, and kept employed in making ropes, hats,
                        and baskets for which they received rations of brandy and tobacco.</p>

                  crammed with a thousand blacks, wedged in her three-feet between decks. In one
                  partition of her bulkhead, sixteen by eighteen feet, the women are squeezed, to
                  the number of 250, many of the wenches big with child. The men are stowed in each
                  other's laps, without an inch right or left, to move in. The Pongas already stinks
                  horribly, and Diego predicts that she will lose half her cargo. She is owned by an
                  American trader, and my uncle has no interest in her. I told Ramos that if we ever
                  fit out a craft, it shall not be like this miserable hulk, and this I mean. God
                  knows this traffic is bad enough of itself, without making the ships like
                  hells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Feb. 11<hi rend="i"/>th.—I am growing sicker every day, of this
                  business of buying and selling human beings for beasts of burden. I am glad
                  England has put a stop to it, as far as her citizens are concerned. The day that
                  sees me free from it, will be a welcome one. This morning, Don Miguel invited me
                  to go up the river to look at a kaffle of slaves just marched into King Vinegar's
                  town. They were Vey negroes, clean limbed, and in general good condition. But my
                  uncle's sharp overseer suspected some of the batch to be made up for the market,
                  and so it turned out. Some tall, stout fellows, shining black, with white teeth,
                  were scrubbed with warm water and found to be glossed up with gunpowder. Don
                  Miguel accused old Vinegar of cheating before, and he took ashore from our sloop
                  an old negress who had been shaved, greased, and powdered to look about
                  middle-age, till her white hair came out again, and exposed the fraud. King
                  Vinegar showed a disposition to laugh at the matter as a capital joke, but Don
                  Miguel was stern about it, whereupon the barbarous wretch vented his spite on the
                  poor old slave-woman, knocking her down with a club, and scattering her brains
                  before us. Don Miguel said no more, as it is policy to keep on good terms with
                  Vinegar; but I confess my blood boiled at this wanton murder.</p>
               <p>Such were my feelings at the age of twenty-three, after the apprenticeship I had
                  passed in African slave-making. Could I have got away, at once, from my
                  associations, I believe I should have done so. But I remained, and became
                  hardened, like every other slaver.</p>
               <p>Diego Ramos was not idle, whilst I brooded over the business. He made a coasting
                  trip, or two, and fell in with an American craft, of trim build, and nearly new,
                  which was offered on favorable terms to him, provided he would take charge of her
                  with a cargo to Cuba, as her captain had just died on the coast. Ramos had agreed,
                  if I was willing, to buy the vessel, at Cuba, after landing there two-thirds of
                  her cargo, on account of her owners, and keeping the remainder of her room for our
                  private stowage of a third more. I saw no objection to this, and Ramos concluded
                  the bargain, and sailed captain of the Miranda, a large clipper brig, with a prime
                  assorted cargo. In three months he returned to Rio Basso, in the same vessel, and
                  we found we had cleared her cost, $12,000, and brought out an ample trading cargo,
                  without breaking in upon our original capital of $10,000. We could count ourselves
                  clear of the world, some <emph>twenty-five thousand dollars.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>This good luck put me on good terms with my partner, myself, and the slave-trade.
                  I looked forward to accumulating a rapid fortune, and stifled all gloomy
                  reminiscences. My uncle had returned to Rio Basso, and expressed himself charmed
                  with my enterprise and its results. He could afford to congratulate me, for his
                  barracoons were loaded down with stock, and a dozen ships were plying back and
                  forth for his profit. The name of Don Ricardo Villeno was good on the coast, from
                  Cape Palmas to the Bight of Benin, and his drafts were honored in London, as well
                  as the West Indies and Brazil. Under the stimulus of approbation from my
                  successful relative, and the actual self-consciousness of property, it is not to
                  be wondered at, that the slave traffic began to have somewhat more of a rose-color
                  to my eyes. I thought of my martyr-friend, the missionary, Jackson; sometimes,
                  too, of his sister; and more than once I caught myself wondering if I might ever
                  meet her again, unmarried, <emph>when I should be rich.</emph> But these fancies
                  wore off, by degrees, and when the year of my partnership contract with Diego
                  Ramos had slipped away, I was a slave-trader, <emph>heartily</emph> in the
                  business, and worth, as far as our mutual investments consisted, my share of fifty
                  thousand dollars.</p>
               <p>About the close of the year 1814, my uncle became engaged in an adventure not
                  strictly of a business character, which afterward involved my own fortunes
                  considerably.</p>
               <p>My partner Ramos had established a trading-place on the Kambia, and I was located
                  there in a tolerably-comfortable bachelor residence, as the nucleus of a
                  settlement, which we dignified with the classical title of New Tyre. Here, in
                  August, 1814, I was trying to make myself contented under a dismal "rainy season,"
                  with no society but a Brazilian Portuguese, an overseer, and a few Foula girls,
                  our household handmaids, when news arrived of a vessel at the river's mouth, and I
                  was shortly after visited by my worthy uncle, and favored with a confidential
                  confab. "I have a love affair on hand, Phil," he said very abruptly. "A love
                  affair!" I repeated, in great astonishment, and was soon informed of an episode,
                  which surprised me still more, as it made known to me that Don Ricardo, instead of
                  being a mere money-making, callous-hearted slave-trader, was quite a chevalier in
                  the way of romantic amours.</p>
               <p>I shall not go into a history of the matter, but come to my uncle's point, which
                  was to engage my company and assistance upon a short expedition, to result in his
                  possession of a nuptial partner for his African existence. Glad to escape the
                  weariness of perpetual rain on land, and partake of some new excitement, I readily
                  agreed to go on board his brig, and shortly afterward saw the receding headlands
                  of the Kambia.</p>
               <p>Don Ricardo Villeno, as he called himself, was at this time just turned of forty
                  years, and as fine-looking a man as might be encountered on the coast. Of good,
                  well-set figure, black, curly hair, full head, eagle eye, and bronzed countenance,
                  he was one quite likely, as I thought, to please a woman's fancy; but until then I
                  had considered him wholly given up to the desire of amassing a large fortune in
                  the line he had chosen, without scruples of conscience as to humanity or legality.
                  He had now, however, revealed another character, and when, after reaching the
                  brig, I was shown her cabin fitted up luxuriously for a lady's occupancy, with
                  numberless little articles of taste and elegance everywhere visible, I began to
                  realize how a "love affair" can polish a slave-trader into something very tender,
                  and make a slave brig's cabin fit for other purposes than packing negro women for
                  the middle passage.</p>
               <p>After being a week out, I learned that our destination was the island of
                  Teneriffe. We made the peak a few days afterward, and soon cast anchor in the
                  harbor of Oritava. I shall quote from my journal what took place while there,
                  rather than trust my memory to relate it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Sept. 16.—My uncle took me in the afternoon to a convent, where he
                  had an interview with his young lady, a splendid specimen of Spanish beauty. That
                  she is in love with him I have not the least doubt, though our interview was in
                  the public parlor. I understand from Don Ricardo that this beautiful girl, Donna
                  Emelia, is devoted by her parents to take the veil. She is now in her novitiate,
                  but there is nothing of the nun about her, I'll wager. This convent is a gloomy
                  prison-house, with iron-grated windows, and gates strong enough for a fort. What
                  passed between my uncle and his sweetheart I did not hear, but he tells me all is
                  settled, and she is to go with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Sept. 18.—We have left Teneriffe, and in time, I think. Good God!
                  can my uncle have had a hand in the burning of that convent? Last night he
                  summoned me to go<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6322-00000034"/> ashore with him in the
                  yawl, with a dozen of the crew. Eight of them remained at the shore, whilst the
                  rest followed us to the convent. My uncle climbed the wall, whilst we watched.
                  Soon afterward flames broke out from the building, followed by the bell, and
                  shrieking of women. The doors were broken open, and my uncle came out, with Donna
                  Emelia in his arms. I hastened with him to the boat, in which he placed the lady,
                  ordering two of the men to pull to the brig. At the same time he directed me to
                  return with our crew to the convent, to assist the people, who were now rushing up
                  to subdue the flames. It was a frightful scene. The nuns were flying in all
                  directions, some completely naked, as they sleep without clothing. Some, in the
                  upper cells, were unable to escape, and could be seen, through the grated windows,
                  tearing about in despair. I heard that seven were known to be burned before we
                  left. Rumor says the conflagration was caused from coals spilled out of an earthen
                  stove, but I have other suspicions which I dare not breathe. My uncle has gained
                  his sweetheart; she is now on board the brig, and we are flying before the wind
                  for Africa. Who is this Donna Emelia, and what has induced her to fly with a
                  stranger? for my uncle cannot have known her long. She seems hardly seventeen, but
                  what a queenly woman she will make. May Jackson was not so handsome, but May
                  Jackson was an angel; and this Spanish nun has the look of a sorceress.</p>
               <p>Whether Don Ricardo Villeno had any share in the firing of the Oritava convent, or
                  whether it was, as his Spanish beauty alleged, a sheer accident, must remain one
                  of the secrets of this world. Both he and she have long since gone to their
                  account, and I never was wiser about the affair than I was on the night of its
                  occurrence. Donna Emelia appeared on deck next day, merry as a cricket and
                  splendid as a bird of paradise. All on board soon heard that she was the captain's
                  wife, and my uncle appeared to be the happiest of men. I was introduced to the
                  lady in form, and received graciously enough, though with an imperious air that
                  rather took me aback, so that I had very little to say at first. We afterward,
                  however, got better acquainted, and I amused the Donna with some account of my
                  African travels.</p>
               <p>Arrived at the Kambia, I found Diego Ramos ready for Cuba, with a cargo on board
                  our American clipper, Miranda. He had taken advantage of the first week of dry
                  weather to bargain for a kaffle brought in by one of the neighboring kings, and
                  got it stowed during the last days of my absence. At my uncle's intimation I said
                  nothing to Ramos concerning the result of our trip, or the presence of the Spanish
                  lady; and as I had been thinking of taking a run to the West Indies about this
                  season, it was arranged, by Don Ricardo's particular desire, that I should go with
                  Diego in our vessel. He wished to use my bachelor house at New Tyre as a cottage
                  for his honeymoon season (so he laughingly expressed it), and I was desired to
                  vacate it at once. "It is the only place on the coast," he said, "not yet run down
                  by negro traders, and I want Emelia to get accustomed to this life before she
                  meets with Don Miguel and his rough comrades."</p>
               <p>I thought I detected a spice of jealous apprehension in my uncle's speech; but as
                  his fancy was set on New Tyre, and I knew my affairs there would be as well in his
                  hands as my own, I promptly complied with his desire, and left him in occupation
                  with our Brazilian factor; Diego Ramos and myself took possession of our shed on
                  the Miranda's quarter-deck—all between decks being packed with her cargo—and we
                  soon were off, with a flowing sheet, for the isles of profitable speculation.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>DIEGO RAMOS did not share with me in the opinion that I expressed, soon after our
                  departure, that the brig was rather too tightly packed, for the health or comfort
                  of the six hundred and forty beings which it was supposed to accommodate. My
                  partner looked upon "blackbirds," as he jocosely termed them, as upon other stock
                  of a perishable nature, and his calculations on the profits of a venture did not
                  take in the matter of benevolence at all.</p>
               <p>"Let us allow, Don Felipe," said he, as we took our deck promenade, with choice
                  Principe cigars between our teeth—"let us allow a margin always for mortality, and
                  the larger our stock the more we have left after deduction of dead
                  percentage."</p>
               <p>"Very true," I replied; "but recollect our experience on board the Boa Morte! I
                  shudder to think of that horrible pest-ship, Don Diego!"</p>
               <p>"Tight-packing had nothing to do with <emph>that,</emph>" answered Diego; "and
                  thinning off the stock," he added, with a laugh, "did not make our case better, I
                  fancy. No, my good friend! the blackbirds will do well enough with plenty of salt
                  in their water; and we shall clear a round ten thousand apiece by the trip, God
                  willing!"</p>
               <p>I winced at hearing Diego's concluding words, for conscience had hinted to me long
                  before this, that God had very little to do with transactions of men on the coast
                  of Africa and the middle passage. But, for a while, it appeared as if my partner's
                  philosophy was better than mine; for certainly no healthier gangs of blacks ever
                  took their turn on deck than ours seemed to be. Diego's principal ship overseer
                  was a stalwart negro, brandishing his cat in a manner that reminded me of my
                  uncle's driver, who lost his life in the Boa Morte rising. But our blacks were a
                  good-natured set, and jumped to the lash so promptly, that there was not much
                  occasion for scoring their naked flanks We had tamborines on board, which some of
                  the younger darkies fought for regularly, and every evening we enjoyed the novelty
                  of African war songs and ring dances, fore and aft, with the satisfaction of
                  feeling that these pleasant exercises were keeping our stock in fine condition,
                  and, of course enhancing our prospect of a profitable voyage. It was after one of
                  these musical episodes, and when our tired performers had been stowed again
                  between decks, to sweat through another stifling night, that our charming hopes
                  were dashed to nothing, and our lives left at the hazard of a few frail planks, in
                  mid ocean.</p>
               <p>I had smoked my cigar, and bidden Diego Ramos good-night; moralized a few moments
                  on slavery and the slave-traffic, concluding, as usual, with a calculation of
                  future gains; and finally gone off into a deep slumber, when I was aroused by a
                  sudden cry through the vessel, and sprung at once from my berth to the open
                  deck.</p>
               <p>"Fire!" was the hoarse response of Diego, to my alarmed looks and gestures; and
                  the startling cry that had awakened me rung again from the brig's bows. At the
                  same time, I saw the seamen running back and forth, like wild<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000035"/> men, with buckets of water, which they were dashing
                  in torrents about the forecastle gratings.</p>
               <p>"Merciful heaven!" I cried, "what is to be done?"</p>
               <p>Diego answered in the same hoarse tone, "Follow me, and keep the men quiet. We
                  must build a raft, and take to the boats, if no other resource be left."</p>
               <p>I ran forward with the captain, who preserved a wonderful coolness, and found that
                  fire was raging under the hatches. Thick smoke issued from the temporary decks,
                  near the bulkhead, and half stifled groans and shrieks came from the poor blacks,
                  who were suffocating to death. Diego's calm manner encouraged the men to new
                  exertions, and gallons on gallons of water quickly deluged the slave-quarters.
                  But, in spite of every effort, the flames increased, and presently broke out
                  through the tarred seams, midships, by the main gratings.</p>
               <p>"All is lost," muttered Diego to me, and then, raising his voice, shouted, "Bear
                  away, lads! lashings and spars for a raft, my hearties!"</p>
               <p>Diego Ramos had already made three voyages with the Miranda's crew, and every man
                  of them had confidence in their chief. They sprung at once to the work of cutting
                  away the brig's masts and bowsprit, and hoisted out the boats, without confusion,
                  while the fire was allowed to smolder between decks. Regardless of the yells and
                  cries of the doomed wretches below, my partner ordered tarpaulins to be thrown
                  over the gratings, and every crevice smothered with wet canvas, to keep down the
                  fire. Meantime he himself worked with terrible activity, whilst I seconded his
                  exertion to the best of my ability. The men toiled for their lives, and in what
                  seemed a miraculously brief space, a strongly secured and tolerably capacious raft
                  was launched, and cut away, with the rigging which composed a portion of it.
                  Meanwhile, our boats were out, and a couple of casks of water, that were
                  fortunately on deck,—the bulk of our supply of that element being under the
                  slave-decks—were made fast, with all the provisions that could be got at, to the
                  middle of our life raft. Then came the vital question of saving such portions of
                  our living cargo, as could be transferred without danger to the raft.</p>
               <p>Fortunately the sea was calm, and a bright moonlight enabled all our operations to
                  go on without the confusion that darkness must have occasioned. A majority of the
                  crew manned our two boats, to which my own and Diego's valuables were transferred;
                  and Diego Ramos, myself, and the rest of the men, took our stations on the raft,
                  and pushed off, having first shifted the hatch-gratings, and flung down the
                  shackle-keys to the slave-gangs, to allow of their escape from the hold.</p>
               <p>I shall never forget the screech that rung in our ears, as the panic-stricken
                  blacks scrambled from their dreadful confinement, pursued by smoke and flame
                  Hardly had the first gangs gained the brig's decks, than fire began to run over
                  all her loose rigging, from wheel to bowsprit, and enveloped the wretched blacks
                  who had rushed to leeward. There was but little air stirring, yet that little was
                  sufficient to fan the flames into fury. The shouts of men and screams of women
                  rose in horrible discord, and one by one the negroes, catching sight of our boats
                  and raft in the increasing light, began to leap overboard, and swim toward us.
                  Then came the most frightful of all the horrors of that night; for it was
                  necessary to prevent a sudden swamping of the raft, and our two boats, which had
                  made fast to it, were ordered to forge ahead, and tow us to windward of the
                  swimming blacks, whilst the Miranda fell off slowly on our lee.</p>
               <p>The sea was illumined for miles by the flames, which wrapped the doomed Miranda.
                  As the raft steadily receded from them the blacks who still clung to our vessels'
                  side, set up despairing cries, and those who were swimming, numbering some
                  hundreds, sprung out of the water, with their hands clasped over their heads. Most
                  of these were encumbered with shackles on the feet; for they had been released on
                  board by unlocking and drawing out the padlocked rods. The drag of these fetters
                  impeded their progress, so that we were enabled to keep the raft at a distance,
                  and only allow the fugitives to board us singly or by twos and threes. Seamen were
                  stationed on every side, to keep off the swimmers, with handspikes; and thus we
                  were able to rescue what the raft could accommodate with safety to ourselves. It
                  was a piteous sight, however, to witness the terror and despair of the doomed
                  ones, who sank constantly before our eyes, or were knocked back from their hold,
                  when they became too heavy for the raft's buoyancy. And here, alas! I was called
                  upon to feel a personal interest in two, at least, of that miserable multitude,
                  which my avarice had assisted in consigning to an untimely fate.</p>
               <p>It was when the flames had reached their height, and the Miranda, from stem to
                  stern, presented a sheet of lurid fire, that a piercing shriek was suddenly heard,
                  rising above all sounds, and then, to my horror and astonishment, the name of
                  "Philip" was distinctly pealed across the water. Diego Ramos started, and looked
                  at me, and we both turned our gaze to the vessel's deck, where stood the erect
                  figure of a woman, her naked black form relieved in clear outline by the
                  background of fire. She held a naked child of about seven years in her
                  outstretched arms, and sent her piercing voice over the space that intervened
                  between her and the raft, with another and louder cry of "Philip!"</p>
               <p>In an instant my heart was thrilled with the recollection of an African forest
                  scene, where a young girl had knelt over my prostrate body, and sucked the venom
                  of a serpent from my wounded breast. I recognized the face, the form, of Sooluh,
                  the daughter of Mammee. I saw before me my devoted Yallaba wife; and, doubtless,
                  it was my own child that I beheld embraced by the poor loving mother. At that
                  moment I forgot Diego Ramos, and my uncle; remembered nothing but that I had once
                  held this poor African wife in my arms, and that she had once preserved my life at
                  the risk of her own. I stretched out my arms, and shouted in the Dahoman tongue,
                  "Sooluh! Sooluh! Philip will save you!" A wild scream of joy broke from the poor
                  creature's lips as the sounds reached her, and she leaped at once, with the child,
                  into the sea that divided us.</p>
               <p>"Ramos! Diego!" I exclaimed; "I must save that woman! Cast off the larboard boat!"
                  I shouted at the top of my voice.</p>
               <p>"Are you mad? look at those black devils! they will swamp us!" cried my partner,
                  pointing to a score of black hands that had just reached and grasped the raft.
                  "Row away, men!" he cried to the boat's crews—"Drive back the niggers, or we'll
                  all drown!" And suiting action to words, he ran along the raft's edge, striking
                  hands and faces of the clinging negroes, till they let go their hold and sunk, one
                  by one, under the timbers. My blood grew cold, and then rushed to my head, like a
                  torrent. I tried to shout, and motioned to poor Sooluh, whose left arm still
                  sustained her child, whilst she swam bravely toward the raft. But the boats were
                  pulled ahead by vigorous strokes; the raft followed, and receded from the ship. I
                  saw the unhappy girl lift her right hand upward, and caught a momentary glimpse of
                  her face in the water. Then a faint cry came to my ears, and the sea closed over
                  my African child. I cared not to see or hear more, but sunk upon the raft, like
                  one stupefied, and remained so I know not how long. When I became conscious again
                  of what was passing around me, I saw the Miranda's hull, like an<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000036"/> enormous firebrand, drifting far to leeward. Diego
                  Ramos was beside me on the raft, and scores of black bodies were lying thickly
                  around us. Our two boats were alongside. The moon had gone down, but it was a
                  clear, starlight night.</p>
               <p>It was some time before I could realize all that had taken place, and find voice
                  to reply to Diego, who addressed some words to me. The hours crept heavily till
                  morning came, and with it a grey fog, covering the ocean. The captain summoned
                  half our crew from the boats, to surround the water-casks with loaded muskets and
                  pistols, while the ship's overseer and his assistants portioned out a gill of
                  water and a morsel of ship-bread to each of the negroes, who devoured their
                  rations greedily, as they sat wedged together, over two thirds of the raft's
                  surface. It was found that one of the water casks was but half full, and the other
                  was leaking fast; and Diego Ramos ordered a rum-keg, of which there were several
                  on the raft, to be emptied of its contents and filled with water, which was then
                  transferred to one of the boats. Our sound water cask was then filled up, and a
                  calculation made upon allowance, in the event of our remaining long exposed. It
                  was found that we had saved 115 negroes, and that our stock of water must be
                  economized with great care.</p>
               <p>In a few hours the fog dispersed, and a hot sun began to beat down upon us. There
                  was scarcely a yard of canvas to be had, and our heads could only be defended from
                  the blazing sky by wrapping portions of our wet clothing around them. I could not,
                  if I would, describe the endurance of that long day on the ocean. Before night
                  came, every white man was wild with the torture of heat. The negroes suffered
                  comparatively little, though they sat in heaps together. The overseers drenched
                  their naked bodies occasionally with buckets of salt water. At night I had a high
                  fever, but slept a few hours.</p>
               <p>The next day brought a repetition of the heat and horrible thirst, occasioned by
                  the salt atmosphere, and our limited rations of water. The blacks also showed
                  symptoms of discomfort, and glared at the water, measured out in spoonfuls to
                  them. I heard from the black overseer that only about half of our whole number of
                  slaves succeeded in escaping from the hold. The remainder were suffocated or
                  consumed under hatches. Out of six hundred and forty, the 115 on our raft were all
                  that survived.</p>
               <p>The third day began to brighten with sickening heat, and Diego Ramos called a
                  council of his officers and myself. No sail had yet been seen, and our men were
                  becoming as feeble as children. It was then determined that we should abandon the
                  raft, which anchored us, as it were in the ocean, and by taking to the boats,
                  endeavor to reach land. My partner was rather loth to cast off the last hope of
                  saving our voyage; though the chance of reaching shore with the drag of the raft,
                  or of being picked up by a friendly slaver, was, at best, a remote one. So it was
                  concluded to cast off both raft and negroes and make the best of our remaining
                  provisions and water, by confining their consumption to the crew. Accordingly,
                  another round of a few drops of water, and a stout dram of rum to each, was served
                  to the eager blacks; under cover of which our bread-bag and the few gallons of
                  water left, were transferred to the boats. We then embarked ourselves, and quietly
                  shoved off letting the raft fall astern.</p>
               <p>The negroes were evidently bewildered at first, in finding themselves loose from
                  their white masters; but presently the idea of being deserted to shift for
                  themselves, seemed to penetrate their black heads, and they jumped altogether upon
                  their feet, with loud cries, and motions of their arms to us. Then, as we made no
                  answer, they began to dance frantically in their iron feet shackles, tearing their
                  wool, beating their heads, and redoubling their cries and supplicating cating
                  gestures. Diego Ramos looked at me and showed his white teeth. "It's a hard case,"
                  said he; "but the poor devils must go! and that breaks up our year's profits,
                  amigo!"</p>
               <p>I did not reply. I was thinking of poor Sooluh and her child, whilst the shrieks
                  of our abandoned negroes were ringing over the sea. But at this moment, a joyful
                  cry broke from one of our seamen. "Sail ho!" he screamed at the top of his lungs.
                  "Sail! ho! on the weather quarter!"</p>
               <p>All eyes turned to the boat's stern, and there, sure enough, we could see a
                  square-rigged vessel looming up with every bit of canvas set, and bearing right
                  down on us. "Thank God! we shall be saved!" I ejaculated, and a joyful shiver ran
                  through all the crew, followed by a wild shout. Every man stood up in the boats,
                  and began to wave jackets and hands; and a moment after we saw a signal run up, in
                  token that we were seen. Our catholic sailors threw themselves on their knees and
                  began to cross themselves, muttering voluble prayers; and the stranger, which had
                  appeared to be running down on us like a race-horse, suddenly backed her
                  main-topsail, and rounded in the wind's eye. In a few moments more we were on
                  board, H. B. M. transport ship, Indus. Diego Ramos and myself were received by her
                  commander very politely, and we at once made a confession of our business; the
                  raft of negroes still in sight, making all evasion useless. Nothing was said, of
                  course, in reference to our abandonment of the negroes, so that we obtained
                  comsiderable credit from the Briton, for our humanity in constructing a raft for
                  the poor people, and keeping them company so long. Meantime, the raft was brought
                  along-side, and its black freight transferred to the decks of the Indus, the
                  slaves crazy with excitement, the combined effects of this last rum-rations and
                  unexpected deliverance.</p>
               <p>As plain Philip Drake, of Stockford, I should have fared hard on board the royal
                  transport, and taken the place of one of my own blacks, as far as shackles were
                  concerned; for at that period British subjects were punished, for participation in
                  the slave-trade, by fourteen years' transportation and hard labor. But as Don
                  Felipe Drax, a Brazilian merchant, and passenger on board the lost brig of Don
                  Diego Ramos, I was allowed a seat at the cabin table, with my partner, and treated
                  with every forbearance that a British officer could exhibit toward foreigners
                  rescued from shipwreck, even though they were engaged in a traffic which the
                  government was seeking to break up altogether. Captain Simmons shook his grey
                  little head at Don Diego's arguments, but laughed at his jokes; and altogether, we
                  had a pleasant mess daily, till the Indus cast anchor in Cape Coast harbor,
                  settlement of Sierra Leone, where the negroes of our lost cargo were to be
                  adjudicated upon by the commissioners there resident for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Sierra Leone was at that time in a thriving state, as British cruisers had not
                  been idle since the abolition of the trade, in building up a population from
                  captured slave cargoes. I heard that the governor was named Maxwell, which
                  reminded me of my old shipmate. Africans of all the coast nations, with Maroons,
                  and emancipated slaves from the West Indies, were to be found here. Our negroes
                  were landed in canoes, and placed in the Royal Yard, to await their fate, which
                  was decided in a few days to be apprenticeship among the settlers for a dozen
                  years, at which time Diego Ramos said they would be Christianized and worn out.
                  Captain Simmons and his officers were ordered salvage, and myself and partner
                  pocketed our losses with as good a grace as possible. Shortly afterward, the Indus
                  went on her voyage, and I remained sick with bilions fever, for some weeks, under
                  care of Surgeon Purdie, then stationed at the Cape. Meanwhile, Ramos looked up a
                  coaster for our passage<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6322-00000037"/> to New Tyre, for
                  which place, on my recovery, we immediately sailed. This was the end of our
                  speculation in the Miranda. The firm of Ramos and Drax remained extant, but the
                  profits of its last venture were mostly divided between fire, water, and British
                  philanthropy. So said my worthy partner, as we reviewed our resources, and began
                  to lay plans for retrieving the disastrous results of this speculation, which had
                  promised such fine things to our delusive hopes.</p>
               <p>On our arrival at the Kambia settlement, I found that my uncle's honeymoon had
                  changed the outside appearance of my thatched dwelling-house, so that Diego and
                  myself were astonished at the improvements. Already handsome additions were
                  apparent on all sides; verandas, balconies, and lattice-work, after the Spanish
                  style, making the rough outside look quite like a palace. But we were still more
                  surprised at the alterations going on in our barracoons, which had before been
                  mere pens under shed roofs, hardly adequate to shelter, without provision for
                  convenience or security. Now, a number of negro gangs were employed bringing
                  lumber from the forest, and a wide area was inclosed with the trunks of young
                  trees, fixed deep in the river banks. Piles were also driven in the water to make
                  an outer support for a pier.</p>
               <p>Don Ricardo had heard of our mishaps, by a previous arrival from Sierra Leoue, and
                  was prepared with advice and assistance. The bulk of our capital was found to
                  amount to about thirty thousand dollars, in cash and credits on my uncle's
                  factories; and by his advice, we resolved to make New Tyre a trading station for
                  inland intercourse with the Kambia nations.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A New Partnership—King Moussy—My Uncle's "Love-passages"—Donna Emelia taken

               </argument>
               <p>I SOON learned the grounds of my uncle's counsel as to the establishment of a
                  regular trading factory. A noted Foula king, named Moussy, had made overtures for
                  a regular alliance with Don Ricardo, for purposes of traffic, and as New Tyre
                  offered a capital depot for caravans from all the Kambia country, my shrewd uncle
                  had lost no time, during our absence, in enlarging the capacities of the
                  settlement. He had likewise made arrangements with King Moussy, for the speedy
                  delivery of a large kaffle at our barracoons; so that, if the Miranda's voyage had
                  turned out successful, her returning owners would have been surprised by a freight
                  which should dispatch her back to the Indies in short order.</p>
               <p>"All that is changed," said Don Ricardo, to Diego Ramos and myself, as we drank
                  coffee under the new veranda—"nevertheless, you shall lose nothing by what I have
                  done. I offer you my treaty with King Moussy, and a like capital with your own, if
                  you are disposed to a partnership arrangement in the New Tyre station; or I will
                  buy or sell on such terms as we shall agree to."</p>
               <p>I consulted with Diego, and the result was a partnership between Don Ricardo
                  Villeno and ourselves; and thus was formed the house of Villeno and Co., afterward
                  widely known both in Africa and the Spanish main.</p>
               <p>Preparations for the reception of King Moussy's caravan went on actively. Diego
                  and myself made our quarters in the house of Pablo Crux, our Brazilian overseer,
                  leaving Don Ricardo still in possession of my old residence, and the society of
                  his Creole wife.</p>
               <p>I soon became comparatively settled, and was able to resume my journalizing, some
                  extracts of which I now copy, as an account of what took place about that time, on
                  the Kambia and its tributary rivers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>New Tyre, Jan. 8, 1816.—Our large barracoon is nearly complete.
                  Diego and Pablo Crux are busy with the negro-gangs, and I have opened our new
                  accounts in the name of the firm. The "house of Villeno &amp; Co." sounds well;
                  better than "Villeno, Ramos, and Drax," no doubt. Diego thinks our senior ought to
                  be rich enough to retire in a few years, and become a Cuban Don or Brazilian
                  Senhor. I hear that Donna Emelia is not my good uncle's first lady-love, by
                  several. It appears there was a Fayal girl, who died on the Congo, a few years
                  ago, and that a light quadroon, now with Don Miguel, was formerly the favorite of
                  Don Ricardo. Diego says that the quadroon's residence at Rio Basso was the true
                  secret of my uncle's choice of New Tyre for his honeymoon with the creole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 12.—This Donna Emelia is a splendid creature. My uncle had her
                  to play on the harp and sing for us, after dinner at the residency, as we call it.
                  Her voice is like a nightingale's. Booby that I was, I felt my eyes pipe, and the
                  young lady, I thought, enjoyed my sentimental emotion. Diego pretends to think her
                  a mere school-girl, but I differ with him, if he really believes so. She is a deep
                  one, or her eyes belie her. My uncle is infatuated with his new love, evidently.
                  He picks up her handkerchief, runs her errands, and watches her as a cat does a
                  mouse. They must be exceedingly happy together, if she is as fond as he appears to
                  be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 13.—We have news of the caravan, coming on a direct trail from
                  King Moussy's chief town. It is said to bring twelve hundred picked slaves,
                  Mandingoes, Soosoos, and condemned Foulas. I am to remain here, while my uncle and
                  Diego goes to meet the caravan, which numbers altogether some two thousand
                  persons. To-day, arrived a new brig belonging to Don Ricardo, with the name of "La
                  Senora Emelia," on a rose-colored flag at her gaff, in compliment to our lady of
                  the residency. We have now three vessels anchored off the factory, and another
                  from Rio Basso expected daily. I saw the donna to-day, swinging in her grass
                  hammock, under the cocoa trees, while a dozen Foula girls were making her
                  comfortable, with fans, fruit, and rice punches. She is queen in my uncle's house,
                  and knows it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 14.—To-morrow morning my uncle and Diego Ramos start for the
                  caravan. King Moussy himself is with it, and there is to be great <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">palabra.</foreign> Until now, I thought that Donna Emelia, of
                  course, went with the Don; but it seems not. I am to have charge of the residency,
                  and play lackey to my lady, for a couple of days. No one but the Foula women must
                  go near her apartments, on any pretence. The donna is a nun again, and I am to
                  guard her convent door, by swinging my cot in the saloon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 15.—My uncle, Diego Ramos, and twenty-five whites, well-armed,
                  started to-day for the caravan trail. The barracoons are ready, so is the new
                  brig, and the Rio Basso ship must soon arrive. If things turn out as expected, we
                  can laugh at the Miranda's loss. No! God knows I can never laugh about that
                  affair. Poor Sooluh! hers was a cruel fate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 16.—I am like a bewildered man to-night. Either I, or Donna
                  Emelia, must be crazy. Last night, I was suddenly awakened by Yunga, the Foula
                  girl, with a message from her mistress, who was very ill, with cramps. I looked up
                  my hot drops, and hurried to the donna's apartments. She appeared to be in much
                  pain, and I administered the medicine, which seemed to give no relief. The Foula
                  girls were sent flying in all directions for new remedies, and I found myself
                  alone with this strange girl. She flung her arms around my neck, kissed my lips,
                  and passionately begged me to save her. I tried to calm her, but she clung to me,
                  till the slaves were near discovering us. Twice to-day I have had to attend her
                  summons. Whether she is really in pain or danger, I cannot, for my life, make
                  out.</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6322-00000038"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 17.—Donna Emelia is rational to-day, and insists that I saved
                  her life. It may be, and it is pleasant to be told so, with a soft hand patting
                  your cheek, and such lips repeating gratitude. I fancy Don Ricardo would hardly
                  care to see his nephew in reception of such caresses; though, the devil take it,
                  the donna may <unclear>be</unclear> innocent enough. I was mistaken evidently in
                  thinking her deep—she seems all simplicity and childishness to-day. 'Pon my word,
                  my good uncle, you are a lucky man to have such a girl in love with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 18.—Noise and rattle; cracking of guns; beating of tom-toms and
                  drums. To-day, New Tyre has been a second Yallaba, in receiving King Moussy's
                  caravan. The Foula king is a noble specimen of his nation; over six feet tall,
                  dressed in a white <foreign>tobe,</foreign> and adorned in barbarian style, with
                  scarf and head dress of dyed cotton cloth, mixed with silk. He is more of the king
                  than any African chief I have ever met before. I was principal interpreter at the
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">palabra</foreign> to-day, and a grand kick-up it was.
                  Some seven hundred Foula warriors, with clubs, and swords, and arrows, many having
                  guns also, were drawn up on our <foreign xml:lang="SPA">plaza</foreign> grounds;
                  negro traders, from the interior, numbering about a score, squatted in front
                  around the king and his officers. Our vassals fired a grand salute. We had an
                  opening chorus by a band of black singers, with cymbal-strikers to accompany them;
                  and afterward a grand feast. All our plans to make this <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >palabra</foreign> a striking demonstration, succeeded very well. Our
                  slaughtered bullocks, rum, and pipes have kept the savages in admiration all day,
                  and we shall doubtless make King Moussy a fast friend as well as ally. Diego Ramos
                  thinks my uncle has no equal as a negotiator on the coast. Donna Emelia was in
                  high glee at the novel sights to-day, and the Foulas think her a white
                     <foreign>fetish,</foreign> or <foreign>witch,</foreign> I hardly know which.
                  She looked splendidly fine to-day, sitting beside my uncle on the long piazza,
                  when he welcomed the Africans. No wonder he is jealous of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 19.—To-day the Cabenda arrived at New Tyre, bringing a heavy
                  cargo of goods for trade; just in time. She is my uncle's best craft, a ship of
                  300 tons burden. The goods are landing, and to-morrow the busy market will begin.
                  Meantime, King Moussy and his troops are picketed in a fine palm valley, a mile
                  from the residency, and the slaves, in gangs, under their various owners, are
                  fastened by cords of twisted bamboo fibres, to stakes in the ground. Donna Emelia
                  accompanied my uncle and Pablo Crux on a tour of inspection, viewing the gangs
                  this afternoon; and our Brazilian assures us that she was not at all frightened at
                  the spectacle. Don Ricardo says he wants to accustom her to the traffic; but I
                  hardly think that the sight of a thousand stark naked blacks is the most delicate
                  amusement for a young "school-girl," as Diego calls her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 20.—Our great market is in full operation. It reminds me of the
                  great square in Fandu. Besides more than a thousand slaves, there are several tons
                  of African merchandise, consisting of ivory, gold dust, rice, cattle, skins,
                  bees-wax, black-wood, honey, and many other articles of inland production. To
                  exchange for these we have cotton cloth, powder, rum, tobacco, cheap muskets, and
                  a variety of pinchbeck trinkets, corals, and the like, to please the taste of
                  savages. This barter is only a by-sort of thing, as the main business to us is
                  slave buying. We allow for a stout negro of twenty, about fourteen English
                  shillings, or three Spanish dollars, in merchandise, and buy women and boys at
                  less rates. Our powder is coarse, and guns of British manufacture, roughly made
                  for the market. Our spirits, cotton, powder, and guns are brought from English
                  trading stations on the Congo, in my uncle's coasters. We buy on the coast, and
                  pay higher for these goods, rather than that the old factories should break up;
                  they being very convenient sometimes as temporary slave depots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 21.—Our trading goes on to the great satisfaction of all
                  concerned. We have houses and places allotted for the different species of
                  merchandise. As fast as each barter is over, the exchanged articles are removed.
                  Our purchases go to the new warehouse and its sheds, and what we dispose of is
                  delivered at once to its claimants, to prevent future disputes. We sort our slaves
                  in gangs, according to age and size, and march them off directly to the
                  barracoons.</p>
               <p>King Moussy and I are quite cronies; my understanding his lingo has won the old
                  fellow's heart. He brags of ruling a great nation of the Foula people, who are
                  generally Mohammedans, and of living in a big town with mosques and thick walls;
                  but these negro kings are all liars. The slaves are not all his, only about two
                  hundred, being the ventures of smaller caravans, who pay him atribute for the
                  escort of his warriors. He gets a percentage on all the sales, whether of slaves
                  or goods and we are to pay him a bonus of 100 muskets, 20 kegs of powder, 2 pieces
                  of cotton cloth, 25 lbs. Of tobacco, and a red soldier coat, as his
                     <foreign>dasch,</foreign> or present, in consideration of the treaty made with
                  my uncle. He promises another caravan, after his bands come in from the
                  slave-hunts. King Moussy is not a bad fellow, but cunning as a fox. He has a
                  deuced good taste, for a savage, for he hinted to me that he would be willing to
                  give up the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">douceur,</foreign> or
                     <foreign>dasch,</foreign> and throw in his hundred darkies, if the
                     <foreign>Moneego,</foreign> Don Ricardo, will sell him his wife. Donna Emelia.
                  I don't think my uncle is ready to dispose of his fascinating friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 25.—Our market is over, and we are rid of the negro king and
                  his army of cormorants, who threatened to eat us out of house and home. We have
                  bought eleven hundred first-class slaves; and shall freight two vessels for the
                  Brazils, to my old acquaintance Mr. Floss, who is now a thriving jobber in "wood
                  and ivory," at Rio, with a plantation near Villa Rica and the gold mines. I wonder
                  if he swings his "fly-brush" as in old times.</p>
               <p>New Tyre continued to thrive, and our partnership concern was a profitable one.
                  With the assistance of King Moussy, we contrived to dispatch a round dozen of
                  cargoes in the year from the Kambia alone; and altogether, with my uncle's
                  settlement at Rio Basso, we sent 43,000 living souls to Cuba and the Brazils in
                  the single year of 1816. So great a stimulus did our quiet stations give to the
                  traffic in general, that Rio Basso was never without a dozen Spanish and French
                  keels in its waters, waiting for cargoes. Villeno &amp; Co. became known equally
                  well to native kings as to West India traders or European brokers; and my uncle's
                  coast schooners had only to poke their nose up the Gambia, the Congo, the Calabra,
                  or Bonny, and negroes were in motion to the shore in gangs of all sizes.</p>
               <p>It was about this period that our operations began to attract the notice of the
                  Sierra Leone authorities, and we heard threats, from time to time, that
                  instructions were expected from the British government designed especially for the
                  breaking up of our profitable speculations on the windward slave-coast. Meantime,
                  Don Ricardo and myself remained in comfortable quarters in New Tyre and its
                  vicinity. Donna Emelia was the lode-stone that kept my uncle so long in one place,
                  and he continued to make the place worth dwelling in. Not only was the
                     "<emph>residency</emph>" rendered snug and commodious, but a romantic cottage
                  had been erected for Donna Emelia, in a place we called the Palm Valley, about a
                  couple of miles from the river, in a natural garden of tropical flowers and
                  fruits. Quite an extensive area was inclosed with high pickets, and gates, like a
                  stockade, and watched by several black sentinels, armed with loaded muskets. I
                  must do my uncle the justice to say that he was a good master, as a general thing,
                  and had the art of attaching the blacks to him in no small degree.</p>
               <p>Donna Emelia remained charming. Diego Ramos, as soon as possible, was off to his
                  favorite element, as captain of one of our vessels. I remained the only society,
                  besides Don Ricardo, for his young lady's occasional entertainment at the
                  dinner-table. She seemed never tired of listening to my accounts of African life,
                  as I had seen it during my captivity among the Dahomans and Foulas; and I, as a
                  matter of course, was flattered by her esteem. I got to be quite ashamed of former
                  suspicions concerning her, for as there occurred no repetition of the fondness I
                  had once experienced from the fair Spaniard, so her demeanor continued always kind
                  and confiding, as if she really harbored gratitude for the simple medical services
                  I had rendered her during my uncle's absence with the Foula caravan.</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6322-00000039"/>
               <p>Toward the close of 1816, my uncle went to Rio Basso, and took Donna Emelia with
                  him. When they returned, in a few weeks, the Spanish favorite was accompanied by a
                  quadroon girl and her mother, a good-featured mulattress. The girl was about
                  twenty years old, and had one of the rich, rosy faces that are sometimes met with
                  on the <unclear>coast.</unclear> Her figure was a most graceful one. My uncle
                  introduced her to me, laughingly, as my housekeeper; and as I was no novice in the
                  customs of Africa, I accepted both her and the mulattress as acquisitions to my
                  household. But to my surprise, the very same day the quadroon made a most eloquent
                  appeal to my generosity, accompanied with a protestation of her love for Don
                  Ricardo, which opened my eyes considerably. I called to mind what Diego Ramos had
                  told me concerning my uncle's former favorites, and of a quadroon who had been
                  transferred to Don Miguel, at Rio Basso. On questioning the mulattress, I learned
                  that her daughter had lived with Don Ricardo for three years, and borne him a
                  child, which survived but a short time. Marina, the quadroon, was passionately
                  attached to him, and had attempted to drown herself at Rio Basso, which caused Don
                  Miguel to interest himself, and prevail on my uncle to allow her to return with
                  him to New Tyre as a companion of Donna Emelia. But Don Ricardo, always jealous in
                  everything relating to his creole, thought proper to transfer the cast-off
                  quadroon to that promising bachelor of 26, his nephew and partner, Drax. On
                  learning and crediting all this, I said nothing, but permitted the grateful women
                  to take charge of my quarters, much to my apparent gain, in point of comfort and
                  attentive service.</p>
               <p>When I next dined with my uncle in Palm Valley, it was to be joked considerably by
                  Donna Emelia, concerning my "handsome wife." I took the matter in good part, and
                  laughed with Don Ricardo, over our wine, as if I was very well satisfied with his
                  Rio Basso present.</p>
               <p>A short time after this occurrence, Diego Ramos arrived from the Verds for a
                  cargo. He reported a fleet of British vessels, bound for Cape Castle and a voyage
                  of scrutiny up and down the coast and rivers. They were empowered to make descents
                  upon all places suspected to be dependent, to any extent, upon English men or
                  capital, and to break up slave factories wherever British complicity could be
                  proven against the managers. This was serious news to Don Ricardo and myself, who
                  were both of us conscious of being in reality British subjects, though time and
                  change of name had made us able to pass for Spaniards, Brazilians, or Creoles, as
                  we had hitherto chosen to appear. My uncle, indeed, was well fitted to sustain
                  either character, and to deceive the closest scrutiny; but I was not so sure of my
                  versatility; neither was he. It was decided, therefore, on due reflection, that I
                  must go with Diego Ramos, on his next trip, whilst our senior partner should
                  remain on the coast to take care of consignments and the general interest.
                  Accordingly, I bade good bye to New Tyre, Donna Emelia, and my own household,
                  including Marina and her mother, and on the 13th of February, 1817, took passage
                  with Diego in our largest ship, the Calbenda. We had 850 slaves, a quantity of
                  ivory and gold-dust, and were bound direct for Rio de Janeiro. As nothing of
                  importance occurred on the voyage, I proceed to copy from my journal, after our
                  arrival at the Brazils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>April 6 <hi rend="i"/>th, 1817.—This day, the consignment of our
                  cargo is completed, and the slaves landed. I had the pleasure of dining at a
                  French café with Dr. Maxwell, who scarcely recognized <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >Senor Drax.</foreign> However, we had a chat over old times, and to-morrow, I
                  am to go, with Diego Ramos, to the doctor's country-house on Mr. Floss' estate.
                  Maxwell is as grey as a badger, and portly as a perpoise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>April 8 <hi rend="i"/>th.—Arrived yesterday morning on Mr. Floss'
                  estate, the <hi rend="i"/>San Benito. He lives in great style, giving concerts and
                  balls to the neighboring gentry. Last night there was a sumptuous entertainment,
                  with a number of court dignitaries present; the dons and donnas wearing their
                  richest dresses. The men shone in all colors, and the ladies' taffeta petticoats
                  were fringed with gold lace, and their tight velvet jackets laced and buttoned
                  with pearl tassels. I danced a saraband with Donna Theresa Louisa Rocha, a fairy
                  in a blue gauze cloak and loose train, clasped at the waist with jewels, and with
                  diamonds, pearls, and gold chains enough in her head-dress and bosom, to purchase
                  the whole cargo of our <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Cabenda.</foreign> Her father, I
                  hear, is a rich proprietor, and a neighbor of Mr. Floss. Ramos and I mounted
                  horses at six this morning. We have visited several plantations, and <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">ingenios,</foreign> as they are called in the Portuguese, where
                  the cane sap is worked up into raw sugar, after being pressed by immense wooden
                  rollers. We passed several gangs of slaves, some out of the Cabenda's cargo, going
                  to the mines. The darkies are well fed, and not driven hard, and seem contented
                  enough, with daily rations of <foreign xml:lang="SPA">aguardiente,</foreign> as
                  the rum is called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>April 9 <hi rend="i"/>th.—The deuce is to pay at <hi rend="i"/>San
                  Benito. Maxwell is out after government soldiers, and we are barricaded in the
                  doctor's house. Half a mile from us, the negroes are collected in a state of
                  insurrection. All communication is cut off between Mr. Floss' mansion and this
                  quarter, and the flames are rising from a chapel which the blacks have fired.
                  Diego Ramos is well armed, and so am I; but the slaves are said to be infuriated,
                  and risings are looked for on neighboring plantations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>April 17th.—Rio de Janeiro. After several days of danger and
                  hardships, Diego Ramos and myself are safe on board the Cabenda. It seems the plot
                  was extensive, and a general massacre was planned to take place at the Easter
                  holidays. The first outbreak was on Floss' <hi rend="i"/>San Benito plantation,
                  and the negroes began by setting fire to the cane-fields, devastating crops, and
                  breaking the machinery of Floss' <foreign xml:lang="SPA">ingenios.</foreign> The
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Presidente</foreign> of the district ordered out
                  troops, and a battle was fought with the insurgents on the 9th. The blacks
                  dispersed to the hills, and on the 10th made sallies, and burned several country
                  houses. Maxwell, Ramos, and myself had been two days shut up in the doctor's
                  dwelling, when Mr. Floss arrived, pursued by a gang of negroes. He had been
                  skulking in the fields since his mansion was destroyed on the 9th. Hardly had we
                  admitted him before hundreds of yelling blacks surrounded the house. It was near
                  night, and they had lighted torches and numerous weapons. We sought to parley with
                  the enraged rebels, but they demanded the delivery of Floss alive into their
                  hands. As this could not be thought of, we prepared for defence, hoping the
                  government troops would arrive to our assistance. We had half a dozen faithful
                  blacks in the house, with two Brazilian overseers, Maxwell, the superintendent,
                  Mr. Floss, Diego Ramos, and myself, to oppose the black assailants, whose numbers
                  were increasing constantly.</p>
               <p>Finding us resolved to defend the house, the blacks tried to set it on fire. We
                  shot several of them, but at last they piled up loads of dry cane on all sides,
                  and we were soon compelled to retreat from doors and windows to the court. The
                  house was built like a hollow square, with the <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >corral</foreign> or yard, in its centre; and there we stood at bay, when the
                  blacks succeeded in effecting an entrance. I gave up all for lost, when I saw the
                  yelling devils jumping through the fire to get at us. They were led by a gigantic
                  negro, who sprung upon Floss, and clutched him by the hair of his head. Poor
                  Maxwell was seized by another, and Diego and myself would have shared their fate,
                  if I had not suddenly recognized the leading savage. It was my old acquaintance,
                  the Ashantee Quobah, whom I had seen last after his lion-fight at Yallaba. I knew
                  him at once by his conical head, tattooed cheeks, and filed teeth, and called out
                  to him in the negro tongue, just as he had dashed Floss on the ground, and placed
                  his foot on him. The negroes heard what I said, and I seized the occasion to
                  pronounce a number of African words, asking for an armistice. Quobah flourished an
                  enormous club, motioning the savages back, and then turned to me, still keeping
                  his left foot on his English enemy's throat. I spoke rapidly as possible, for I
                  saw it was a matter of life and death to get the good will of Quobah, who was
                  evidently the ringleader of all. As good fortune would have it, the Ashantee
                  recollected me, and ordered his furious followers not to molest us.<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000040"/> Diego Ramos and myself had our arms bound, and were
                  dragged out of the burning building. Floss and Maxwell were roped about the necks,
                  and cruelly beaten with clubs and whips. The insurgents hurried us in front of the
                  burning buildings, and there began a dreadful torture and massacre. The Brazilian
                  overseers and their negroes were cut to pieces. Floss and Maxwell were stripped,
                  fastened to stakes, and sugar-sap poured over their naked bodies. The blacks then
                  piled cane around them, and tortured them with a slow fire. It was a horrible
                  sight. The wretched victims begged in vain for mercy, until they fainted under
                  their agony. Then Quobah struck the surgeon a blow with his club, which dashed his
                  skull open, and this was a signal to the blacks to finish their work. They
                  scattered the burning cane, and tore the charred bodies of their victims into a
                  thousand pieces, as they danced and trampled on the embers. Quobah then came, and
                  cut the cords from Diego and me, and told us to escape. His voice was hoarse, and
                  his eyes were like two balls of fire. "Go and tell the white king how Quobah has
                  avenged himself on these dead brutes," he said to us. "Quobah is ready to die, but
                  he will be a slave no more!" We lost no time in getting away from the scene of
                  massacre, fearing the negroes might repent their mercy to us. Taking to the woods,
                  we wandered about till morning, when we fell in with a troop of soldiers from the
                  presidency barracks.</p>
               <p>The particulars jotted down in my journal relate but a small part of the
                  atrocities committed during the three days that this insurrection lasted. Quobah,
                  the Ashantee, as it afterward turned out, was the head of the conspiracy. He had
                  been lately purchased by Mr. Floss, with a lot of his savage countrymen, just from
                  Africa; and had been flogged several times, by order of his master, to break him
                  in. This had been Floss' usual custom, with high-strung darkies; and he had the
                  name of being the hardest negro-owner in the vice-royalty. Poor fellow! it cost
                  him his life. Dr. Maxwell had also been unpopular with the blacks; and I now
                  called to mind some of his former opinions. "Niggers must be treated like
                  niggers," was one of the unfortunate surgeon's maxims, which I remembered
                  well.</p>
               <p>The year 1817-18 was marked by many other negro insurrections besides this. In
                  Barbadoes, Trinidad, and St. Thomas, the whites lived in constant fear of
                  massacre. This was said to be owing to the numbers of savage Africans, who were
                  smuggled every month into the British colonies, from Spanish and Portuguese
                  islands. Laws were passed for making registered lists of slaves, but they were
                  enforced only in a few islands; and smuggling went on briskly through all the
                  Spanish Main. But at that time such operations were carried on very awkwardly,
                  compared with the smuggling system of later years, in which I have participated to
                  no small extent.</p>
               <p>Quobah, the Ashantee, was never taken by the Brazilians. He fled to the wild
                  plains, with a few followers, and was either killed or adopted by the Indian
                  tribes. It was noticed, as a singular fact, at the time, that both the Brazilian
                  and Indian insurgents adopted flags, and were apparently organized; and there
                  seemed to be no doubt that some plan must have been concocted for a general rising
                  of slaves against the whites. I afterward heard that a negro flag was found in
                  Barbadoes, divided into three colors, one bearing the figure of a white man
                  hanging by the neck; the second, a black chief standing over a white female; and
                  the third, a negro with a crown on his head, and a beautiful white woman seated by
                  his side. It was thought probable at the time, that some Haytien agents had
                  stirred up the slaves both on the continent and islands. The Barbadoan rebels
                  burned whole parishes; and like devastations were committed in other islands. The
                  result was that thousands of slaves were shot, hanged, or starved out in their
                  retreats, and many sugar estates left without laborers. All this enhanced the
                  price of stock, and improved the market. Diego Ramos predicted more than average
                  luck during another twelve months, and said we might both consider ourselves on
                  the high road to wealth in the future.</p>
               <p>Fortunately, the Cabenda's freight, which was entirely on account of our New Tyre
                  partnership, had been settled for before the death of Mr. Floss, to whom it had
                  been conveyed. The accounts were in bankers' drafts on Paris houses, which were
                  good as gold at the French factories on the Senegal River. France had before this
                  abolished the traffic <emph>on paper;</emph> but her citizens were not so
                  scrupulous or timid as H. B. M. subjects.</p>

               <p>WE cast anchor again in the Rio Pongo about the middle of the rainy season. All
                  things were as before, although, as we learned, the settlement had been honored by
                  two visits from the British squadron, then very active in suppressing all illegal
                  establishments on the coast. My uncle, however, had passed muster. Our barracoons
                  were empty, the storehouses full. Don Ricardo had exhibited his Portuguese
                  permits, which allowed him liberty to engage in such African trade as he pleased.
                  The Don had, moreover, exercised diplomacy in another way; he had dispatched one
                  of his negro agents to the Congo River, where a British expedition of discovery
                  was in trouble, and there contrived to negotiate some favors from the native
                  kings, which were of special importance to the English explorers. This had gone a
                  great way with our bamboozled countrymen; and the house of Villeno, instead of
                  suffering spoliation, became of greater importance than ever on the African
                  coast.</p>
               <p>We had accounts of British severities on the Calabar, the Congo and Gambia rivers,
                  as well as near Cape Palmas. Capt. Fraley's old Bangara factory on the Congo, had
                  been destroyed, its manager, an American factor, Curtis, being summarily ejected,
                  and another American, named Cooke, carried to Sierra Leone, and then sent in irons
                  to Portsmouth. Another factory, near the town of a native king, Mungo Cattee, was
                  destroyed, and near twenty tons of elephant teeth seized by the cruisers. Other
                  depredations had been committed by the British on property of American and French
                  subjects, but both New Tyre and Rio Basso escaped scot free.</p>
               <p>My private establishment seemed like home again, after shipboard life; but I
                  noticed a change in the quarteroon girl, Marina, as soon as I set eyes on her. The
                  bright flush was gone from her cheeks, and her black eyes, that had been brilliant
                  as stars, were heavy and half closed under their long lashes. She smiled faintly
                  in welcoming us, but soon appeared to grow stupid and forgetful. Donna Emelia, at
                  Palm Valley, gave me a warm greeting, and my uncle was in the best of spirits with
                  her, himself, and everybody. We had a grand <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fete</foreign>
                  in honor of our arrival, and the successful result of the voyage; and the memory
                  of poor Surgeon Maxwell was not forgotten over our Canary wine. As<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000041"/> for Floss, my uncle said he had always prophesied
                  his fate, for he was a harsh and impolitic master. The part that Quobah took in
                  the massacre astonished Don Ricardo not a little; and I had to go over again, for
                  Donna Emelia, the whole story of the Yallaba lion fight.</p>
               <p>We met two strangers at my uncle's table. One was presented to us as Pedro Blanco,
                  a Malaga sailor, the other as Blas Covado, a Mexican. In exchanging healths with
                  the first-mentioned, I had no idea I was then making the acquaintance of a man who
                  was destined to amass a million and a half of silver dollars on the African coast,
                  and make a position for himself much more important than my uncle's at that time.
                  The Mexican, Covado, did not impress me favorably at first view. He seemed to be
                  an inferior fellow, compared with the other guest. He was short in stature, with a
                  bullet head and negro features. I should have taken him for a mulatto, if his hair
                  had not been straight as an Indian's.</p>
               <p>Donna Emelia was quite gracious to me, and Pedro Blanco, noticing this, paid me
                  more attention. Covado watched us both, and was obsequious to everybody. He
                  cringed to Don Ricardo, begged to take wine with me, and amazed Ramos by telling
                  him how he had heard of his exploits as the boldest slave-captain on the coast.
                  When the company broke up, and Diego and I strolled to the residency, to look up
                  old acquaintances, we compared notes concerning the Mexican, and decided that he
                  was a disagreeable fellow. "Where can Don Ricardo have picked him up?" I said. "He
                  was supercargo of a Habanero trader," Ramos answered. "So Pablo told me; and is
                  now a sort of accountant, or factotum of your uncle. He seems a white-livered dog,
                  though no doubt useful enough in his way. But what did you think of Blauco? A
                  shrewd fellow, I judge."</p>
               <p>"I am of your opinion, Don Diego! He will never let the grass grow under his
                  feet."</p>
               <p>Such were our sentiments on a first interview with Don Pedro Blanco, who
                  subsequently became the most fortunate slave-trader in Africa, and that when
                  nearly every government was in arms to suppress the traffic.</p>
               <p>We settled down to endure, as well as possible, a couple of months of rainy
                  squalls, during which nothing could be done on shipboard or out of doors. Besides
                  Don Pedro, there was a pleasant fellow, a Dutchman, at New Tyre, who was waiting
                  for a coaster to take him to the Senegal River. With these two, Ramos and I
                  managed to idle our time, not caring to notice the Mexican Covado. This did not
                  appear to nettle the man; for, if anything, he was more obsequious than ever. Don
                  Ricardo, as it appeared, had every confidence in him, and he was always fagging at
                  our accounts, in the most industrious manner.</p>
               <p>The quarteroon Marina puzzled me from the day of our arrival. Instead of the
                  brilliant, passionate creature that her looks had bespoken on her first
                  introduction to New Tyre, she was now a pale sluggish woman, with transparent skin
                  and feeble motions. I spoke to the mulattress, and was answered by an ominous
                  shake of the head, and the information that her child was "bewitched."</p>
               <p>"Bewitched! Nonsense! what have you been doing to Marina?" I demanded. I could get
                  nothing out of the old woman, but that the white lady at Palm Valley had an evil
                  fetish, who bewitched poor Marina. I learned, however, to my surprise, that the
                  girl had passed all the time of my absence in the cottage of Donna Emelia, as that
                  lady's personal attendant, until, on the day of our return, she had been sent
                  back, with her mother, to arrange my household again.</p>
               <p>I had heard, before this time, of a strange African distemper, commonly known as
                  the "sleepy disease," and Marina's appearance answered to some of its symptoms, in
                  a certain glassiness of eyes, and nervousness of the limbs at times. The old
                  mother was acquainted with this malady, but would not believe her daughter was its
                  subject; and I found she was right. Marina's was not a case of lethargy, or
                  constant drowsiness, as in the fatal disease I had suspected. On the contrary, she
                  was often made wild by spasmodic spells of wakefulness. Her case puzzled me, and I
                  mentioned it to Don Ricardo and Donna Emelia.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Don Felipe! your handsome wife!" laughed the Creole, tapping me with her fan.
                  "You do well to be anxious about her!"</p>
               <p>"That is true!" said my uncle—"For Marina began to decline, as soon as Felipe left
                  for the Brazils. She is dying for love of you, Phil!"</p>
               <p>"I really think the poor girl is dying!" said I, "though I doubt if I have
                  anything to do with it!"</p>
               <p>"Marina told us to-day, that she feels herself doomed!" answered Don Ricardo, more
                  seriously than before; but the donna laughed, and, tapping me again, told me I
                  must take care of the poor child, for she was certainly dying for love.</p>
               <p>"This woman is a heartless wretch," I said to myself, in taking leave. "And as for
                  my uncle! I have an idea that he knows more about the cause of Marina's decline
                  than any one else."</p>
               <p>This reflection was induced by what I had previously learned regarding the
                  quarteroon's passionate attachment to her master; but soon after, I began to
                  harbor darker suspicions. That night I was called suddenly by the mulattress to
                  attend her daughter. I found Marina with all the symptoms of tetanus. Her jaws
                  were closed and rigid, her teeth set, and eyes glazed. Continual spasms agitated
                  her frame. I inquired hastily of her mother, what she had eaten? Nothing. "But," I
                  said, "you must have given her something. She is poisoned, I believe!"</p>
               <p>The old woman insisted that she was "bewitched;" that she always came home
                  "bewitched" from a visit to the Moneego Ricardo's house; just as she had been,
                  while residing there. This declaration startled me, and I made a search among the
                  quarteroon's little articles of toilet and daily use, for something to satisfy a
                  new suspicion that had seized me. I soon discovered abundant evidence of what I
                  feared. A small vial, half full of a fluid; some pills; some mango pickles; all
                  were impregnated with <emph>strychnine.</emph> I was no longer at a loss to
                  account for Marina's singular disease; her nervousness; her alteration of muscle
                  and blood. She was under the influence of gradual poisoning.</p>
               <p>But I had no time that night to reflect upon the matter. Scarcely did I succeed in
                  calming the girl's spasms, by administering powerful opiates, than I was summoned
                  post haste to my uncle's cottage. Donna Emelia had been taken seriously ill. I
                  hastened to Palm Valley, and found the place in confusion. Servants were running
                  to and fro, and Don Ricardo was the picture of fright. He grasped my hand, and
                  whispered in trembling tones—"Emelia! Philip! save her!"</p>
               <p>The donna was lying on a couch, pallid and beautiful, without apparent life. I
                  judged it to be simple swoon, and ordered proper remedies. In a few moments, she
                  manifested returning animation, clutching my hand, as it held a sponge to her
                  lips. "She lives!" cried my uncle, the tears rolling down his rheeks. Donna Emelia
                  gave a slight sigh, opened her eyes, and fixed them on my face, drawing my hand
                  close to her, at the same sime, with a nervous<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000042"/> tremor. Don Ricardo threw himself on his knees
                  beside her, and began kissing her other hand like a schoolboy.</p>
               <p>There was no relapse, and after leaving some directions, I returned to my house,
                  found Marina sleeping still, and the mulattress lying beside her, watching her
                  heavy breathing. Then, seeking my own bed, I began to reflect on the night's
                  occurrences.</p>
               <p>The matter of a slave-girl dying, even by slow poison, was not of much rarity in
                  Africa, and had Marina been one of our marketable blacks, the impressions
                  concerning it might have been merely as to loss in dollars and cents. The
                  "witchcraft," as the mulattress believed it, would have been attributed to some
                  malevolent fellow-slave, and the case forgotten in a day or two. But my previous
                  interest in the quarteroon, as my uncle's former favorite, coupled with her
                  passion for him, and her late residence at Palm Valley, furnished grounds of
                  conjecture on which I built to some extent before sleeping. Next day I resolved to
                  question Marina herself; but next day the poor quarteroon's spasms returned on
                  her, and continued, in spite of all remedies, to increase in violence, till, in
                  three days more, she was dead.</p>
               <p>The mulattress was crazy with grief, and survived her "bewitched," daughter only a
                  few weeks. My uncle expressed astonishment and apparent sorrow. Donna Emilia was
                  profuse in her lamentations, with loud expressions of sympathy for what she called
                     <emph>my</emph> bereavement. After Marina was buried, the donna insisted that I
                  should reside at Palm Valley; that I must be lone-some at the river side; and that
                  she required a medical friend at hand, in case of a recurrence of her alarming
                  illness. The last plea decided Don Ricardo to second her, and I was invited to
                  Palm Valley at once. From that date my misfortunes in after-life commenced.</p>
               <p>I am an old man now, and the grave is open before me. I have committed many
                  crimes, and led a life of evil. But I can call my conscience to witness that,
                  before I became acquainted with Donna Emelia, I had, at least, seasons of
                  reflection, and always looked forward to a change both in business and manner of
                  life. The influence that this woman exerted upon my future was, of course, the
                  result of my own weakness and defects of character; but if I had never met her, I
                  know that I should have been a different man.</p>
               <p>What took place at Palm Valley, I need not dwell upon at any length. A few
                  extracts at random from my journal, at that time, will suffice to preface what
                  afterward took place in my career.</p>
               <p>Poor Marina, the quadroon, is under the sod. There is a dark mystery about that
                  girl's last days, and I dare not follow the clues that I have to it. No doubt, she
                  loved Don Ricardo to distraction, and would have died for him, I think. That makes
                  the business worse. Why was she ever brought here at all? It must have been
                  constant torture to her to see <emph>his</emph> fondness for another. Well—peace
                  be to her. Slave as she was, she was a true-hearted woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 15 <hi rend="i"/>th.—This season is the dullest I have ever
                  known in Africa. If it was not for Ramos and Pedro Blanco, we should all commit
                  suicide. But I forget Donna Emelia. She is entertaining enough. I could listen to
                  her voice and harp for a year without tiring. But my uncle makes a fool of
                  himself, in being such a slave to this girl. Fascinating and lovely as she is, a
                  man ought to have some respect for himself. My uncle acts like a boy, and she
                  rules him prettily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 16.—I had a chit-chat of an hour all alone with the donna
                  to-day. Had no idea her mind was so well cultivated. She certainly makes me
                  ashamed of my poor stock. And I doubt if my uncle's learning is more extensive
                  than mine. The donna has a choice library, with her other means of killing time,
                  and pays me the compliment of calling me a fine reader. We are to have reading
                  regularly now. This woman is a strange creature. I sometimes doubt if she is happy
                  or contented, though Don Ricardo has surrounded her with luxuries. Palm Valley is
                  a little paradise, as Ramos says, with an angel and a devil in it. What the deuce
                  he means I cannot see; but neither my uncle nor myself can be more devilish than
                  Diego.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 21 <hi rend="i"/>st.—I am a fool and a villain. Diego Ramos
                  was right, for there is at least one devil in Palm Valley. I am ashamed of what I
                  am, more than ever; and all for a woman who is false to a man who loves and trusts
                  her implicitly. But she could tempt an angel, and swears she loves me, and has
                  loved me since we first met. Then she must have deceived Don Ricardo abominably.
                  If he should discover our relations, we are lost, and deserve it. I ought to
                  destroy this record, and yet I will not. Let the worst come! The die is cast, and
                  what's done is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>August 23 <hi rend="i"/>d.—I met <emph>her</emph> again to-day, and
                  she is more fascinating than ever. If this be a reality, and she indeed loves me,
                  I ought to be a happy fellow. But there is something in her eyes at times that
                  makes me uneasy. Pshaw!—what an ass I am! The woman loves me, for all her actions
                  show it. What has she to gain by deceiving me? I never mentioned the word
                     <emph>love</emph> to her till that afternoon in the garden, whilst Don Ricardo
                  was taking his <foreign xml:lang="SPA">siesta,</foreign> when she threw her arms
                  about me, as once before, in her sickness. Can it be that those attacks of illness
                  were feigned? I half believe it, and how my bashfulness must have amused her.
                  Well, she is a royal creature, and I believe a child of nature. How am I to help
                  it, if Don Ricardo is deceived? It is sufficient that she loves me, and let me be
                  happy, as I ought to be.</p>
               <p>The rains had not ceased before my character and feelings had undergone a change,
                  deep as it was rapid. I found Donna Emelia to be a strange compound of qualities.
                  She seemed at times as artless as a child, and at others artful beyond all
                  scrutiny. Her demeanor toward my uncle became full of apparent affection, and she
                  also affected a sudden seriousness of mood that suited well with her at times. By
                  degrees I became completely infatuated with the woman. All my thoughts and dreams
                  were concerning her, and it seems as if my uncle must have been singularly blind
                  not to discover our deceit, from my indiscretion. As for her, she was prudence
                  itself. Though not twenty years of age, her head was older than mine or my
                  uncle's, and it was no wonder we were both fascinated, and both deceived.</p>
               <p>The fine weather brought activity to New Tyre, as to all the coast. Diego Ramos
                  went coasting to the Congo, and Pedro Blanco sailed for the Senegal, with our
                  good-natured Dutchman, in a French trader. I remained with my uncle, our old
                  overseer, Pablo, and the Mexican accountant, and business resumed its routine at
                  the settlement.</p>
               <p>The routine to me was not, however, the same as in old times. Spite of my
                  self-conceit and delusion, I felt my conduct to be mean, as well as deceitful. I
                  tried to argue down all scruples, and had a powerful assistant in Donna Emelia;
                  but I did not possess the excuse of a genuine love for the object of my
                  unfortunate passion. The donna believed me to be as much her slave as my uncle
                  really was; but I knew very well that my feelings were not founded on respect,
                  which is the basis of true affection. I was fascinated—I was "bewitched" by her,
                  but it was not love, and that I knew.</p>
               <p>The year was drawing to a close, and affairs at New Tyre were more flourishing
                  than ever. About this time, it became advisable to send to Rio Basso for a vessel
                  or two, to relieve us of our large stock of negroes, waiting in the Kambia
                  barracoons for shipment. My uncle had grown more uxorious than ever. He was
                  unwilling to leave Palm Valley, and the Mexican, Blas Covado, was dispatched, with
                  confidential instructions. He left New Tyre in a small sloop, and returned in due
                  time; but instead of bringing a slave vessel, he made his appearance on the deck
                  of a British cruiser, which cast anchor opposite our factory, landed a hundred
                  men, and took possession of the station in the name of the Governor of Sierra
                  Leone.</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6322-00000043"/>
               <p>The blow was like a thunder-clap on our settlement. Don. Ricardo could hardly
                  believe his senses, when he found himself, with me and our three other white men,
                  summoned, just after dinner, before H. B. M. captain, of the Princess Caroline
                  sloop-of-war, charged with maintaining a slave establishment, "contrary to the
                  peace and dignity of H. M. government." He protested his innocence, of course,
                  demanding under what plea they invaded a station over which the Portuguese flag
                  was flying.</p>
               <p>"Because," the English officer replied, "you are no Portuguese, but a cursed
                  English renegade and slaving vagabond!"</p>
               <p>My uncle started back, and his eye flashed mischief, as I had often seen it
                  before, but he controlled his temper wonderfully.</p>
               <p>"May I ask what you intend to do in my house, and under <emph>that</emph> flag?"
                  he asked, pointing to the colors on our flag-staff, in front of the piazza, where
                  we were standing.</p>
               <p>"Burn one and pull the other down," answered the British captain savagely. "But
                  first, we shall send you and your under-devils aboard you ship! Here, Mr. Bayley,"
                  he continued, addressing a midshipman, "give these outlaws ribbons on their
                  wrists, and take 'em to the boats. Do you understand me, sir?"</p>
               <p>The young officer touched his hat, and a movement was made among the British
                  marines and sailors, who were drawn up on the grass before the large piazza of the
                  residency. My uncle suddenly thrust his hands in the bosom of his loose merino
                  shirt, and drew out two pistols, cocked and primed.</p>
               <p>"Captain," he said, speaking through his set teeth, "I demand your authority for
                  this, and if a man of you attempts to handcuff one of us, I'll blow his brains
                  out, if I die the next minute!"</p>
               <p>The Englishman's blue face lost some of its color for a moment, as he saw his
                  breast covered by one pistol-barrel, whilst the other was levelled at his
                  subaltern. With an oath, he pointed to the Mexican, Blas Covado, who had just come
                  up between two sailors.</p>
               <p>"There's the king's evidence to hang you!" he blustered. "He'll tell you there's
                  not a stone left of your Rio Basso slave-pens, as there won't be of these
                  to-morrow morning, by the Lord Harry! Men, do your duty!"</p>
               <p>We saw how matters stood. The treacherous accountant had, by some means,
                  discovered the secret of our English birth, and betrayed all to the British
                  commander, whose whole manner showed that he knew the ground he was treading, and
                  that we were, as he expressed himself, outlaws as well as renegades. I felt our
                  position in an instant, and that expostulation would be vain. So did my uncle; but
                  his actions were more decisive than my reflections. No sooner had the British
                  officer given his last order, than Don Ricardo's pistol exploded, and he sprang
                  into the open door of the residency, crying, "Philip, follow me!" I lost no time
                  in doing so, and we dashed through the house, and out behind, where luxuriant
                  mangroves bordered a bend in the river. A narrow path round the sedgy growth
                  conducted to a thick clump of cocoa-trees beyond. We heard a yell from the British
                  sailors, which only served to hasten our flight. After reaching the cocoas, we saw
                  our enemies in full pursuit, from both front and rear of the building, and I just
                  then gained my uncle's side.</p>
               <p>"Phil, we must run for it to Palm Valley," he said. "I'll die before I'm
                  taken."</p>
               <p>"And I too," was my reply, as we struck out together for the deeper woods.</p>
               <p>It was a desperate chance, for the British were yelling like bloodhounds close at
                  our heels. We had the advantage of a start and a knowledge of the way, which
                  availed us considerably, though an open space of several hundred yards, that we
                  were obliged to cross, exposed us to gun-shots from our pursuers. My uncle still
                  retained one loaded pistol. I was unarmed. But we were good runners, and gained
                  the first stretch of woods without injury, under a running fire from the marines,
                  who discharged their muskets at random.</p>
               <p>As we dashed downward, between tall trunks of palms, and through the orange and
                  banana-trees that lined this valley road, the sounds of pursuit increased behind.
                  But we came in sight of the pickets that surrounded Don Ricardo's cottage before
                  we were in actual danger. Just as we gained a sloping sward, bordered by
                  coffee-trees, within a quarter of a mile of the house, a dozen English soldiers
                  started into sight, emerging from a cross-path, forty rods behind us. They were
                  led by the treacherous Mexican, Covado, who had evidently expected to cut us off,
                  by taking a shorter cut; but was not swift enough. We were close on our shelter,
                  and could hail the black sentinels, which we did, at the top of our voices. At the
                  same moment, we received the sailor's fire, and I felt a bullet graze my cheek.
                  But we both kept on vigorously, and with a desperate run gained the open gateway,
                  through which I rushed headlong, expecting my uncle to follow. Our negro watchman
                  gave a loud screech, and I heard a musket shot behind me. Turning quickly, I saw
                  Don Ricardo stagger in, with the sentinel's gun in his hand. He had snatched it,
                  as he reached our gate, and fired at our pursuers, shooting the Mexican traitor
                  through the head. In another moment we had closed and barred our gate, and were as
                  secure for the present as our stockade defences could render us. It was not till
                  this had been done, that I discovered my uncle to be wounded. He had been struck
                  by a bullet in the right breast, and his shirt was soaked with blood. I had hardly
                  time to extend my arms, before he fell into them like a log.</p>
               <p>As speedily as possible, assisted by our black servants, I got Don Ricardo into
                  the house, and laid him on some cushions. Donna Emelia had heard the news, and
                  came like one crazy into the saloon. As soon as she saw the man covered with
                  blood, she ran to me and fainted in my arms. But it was no time to think of her
                  fright, with my uncle lying there, and the British gangs outside. I quickly called
                  our Foula wenches, who carried the donna to her chamber.</p>
               <p>Don Ricardo's wound was dangerous, I saw at once; but I staunched and dressed it
                  as well as I was able. Meantime our blacks were terrified, expecting to be
                  attacked on every side. But probably the British party feared an ambuscade, for
                  they retreated, carrying the Mexican with them. It was then near sunset, and we
                  watched without seeing more of them until dusk set in. I then let out a shrewd
                  Mandingo boy, as a spy, to go to the river side. While our messenger was gone, we
                  saw the sky reddening, and were not surprised, when he returned, to hear that the
                  residency and stock-houses were burning to the ground. He reported the British to
                  have returned in their boats to their ship, which lay at anchor in the stream.
                  Shortly after this, we heard a pistol fired, and the sentinel admitted Pablo, our
                  Brazilian overseer, more dead than alive. He had escaped and secreted himself in
                  the woods, till he ventured to make for our stockade.</p>
               <p>By this time Don Ricardo had been recovered from his fainting, but remained
                  without speech for several hours. I was at my wit's end. I expected the house to
                  be assaulted, and the pickets burned, as soon as dawn should give our enemies an
                  opportunity; and judging by what I had seen of the naval captain, we could look
                  for little mercy at his hands. My uncle grew weaker, and I feared he was dying;
                  but before midnight he became sensible and able to<pb n="78-79"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000044"/> speak, his first inquiry being for Donna Emelia,
                  who was sent for forthwith, and soon came crying to his side. Don Ricardo told us
                  that he could not survive; that he was bleeding internally; and bade me send all
                  out of the room except myself and the creole. He then spoke with much earnestness
                  to me, asking my promise to protect Emelia, if necessary with my life; and to
                  prevent her from falling into the hands of the English, by all means. The donna
                  seized his hand in a frantic manner, kissing it, and swearing that she would die
                  rather than be separated from him. At length she became so disturbed, that my
                  uncle begged me to take her for a few moments away, and when I came back alone he
                  made me renew my promises to guard her safely. He then gave me the keys of his
                  chest, and told me to take the money and papers which it contained, and secure
                  them from the British. He said that he feared his wound to be mortal, and that a
                  few days or hours must end him, and then charged me to watch over Emelia to the
                  last. His mind soon after began to wander, and his speech became incoherent.</p>
               <p>I called Pablo in to take my place, and went to Donna Emelia, to tell her what my
                  uncle had said. She threw herself in my arms, kissing, and fondling, and swearing
                  that she would never leave me, that we should live and die together. I was
                  astonished more than pleased with the woman's strange conduct; but my infatuation
                  with her was greater than ever. She had never appeared more beautiful than on
                     <emph>that</emph> night, with her dishevelled but glossy ringlets flowing on
                  her heaving bosom, and her large black eyes sparkling with tears. But she was far
                  more practical than I was; for she at once began to speak of our escaping from
                  Palm Valley. At her suggestion, I returned to the Brazilian overseer, who was
                  trying to calm my poor uncle. Pablo, in answer to my questions, said that he
                  thought we might yet escape by making use of a pleasure-boat which lay in a little
                  cove about a quarter of a mile from our Palm Valley house, at a part of the river
                  some two miles above the factory. He said if we took half a dozen of our Kroos, to
                  row the boat, and struck up the river toward the nearest town belonging to King
                  Moussy, we should find shelter and safety till the cruiser sailed from New Tyre,
                  or until we might fall in with one of our coasting vessels, which had been now
                  some weeks absent, up the Kambia.</p>
               <p>This advice of Pablo suited both the donna and myself, and we determined to act
                  upon it. I was loath to abandon my uncle, who remained delirious, continually
                  calling out the name of "Emelia;" but the creole persuaded me there was no help
                  for it, and that we should only sacrifice ourselves by remaining. I was too easily
                  prevailed upon, and, in fact, was hardly in a state of mind to reason; for my
                  excitement had been stimulated by spirits, of which I drank very freely throughout
                  the night. Donna Emelia, on the contrary, mustered resolution and calmness, much
                  in contrast with her wildness before my uncle. I was not at that period aware of
                  her being the consummate playactress she afterwards proved herself to be.</p>
               <p>But I must hurry over the rest of that night's doings at Palm Valley. With Pablo's
                  assistance, I packed up some few valuables and necessaries, including all my
                  uncle's papers, as well as my own, and such ready money as I had myself. We then
                  loaded a couple of our Kroos with provisions, Donna Emelia's clothing, and
                  articles of comfort for her, and I left the Brazilian in command of the boat, with
                  four Kroomen and one of the Foula girls, whilst I returned to the house for the
                  lady. I dared not go into the room where my uncle lay raving, in charge of the
                  other women, but carried Donna Emelia in my arms out of our rear pickets, leaving
                  orders with the sentinels to keep strict watch during the night. Then, followed by
                  two more blacks, with more of the creole's goods, we made haste to our boat, which
                  was a pinnace that had been fitted up and used for my uncle's short excursions on
                  the river. It was after midnight when we got under way, and it was not till we
                  left the shore that Pablo, our Brazilian, became aware that my uncle was left
                  behind. I satisfied him, as well as I could, of the necessity of the case,
                  although my heart smote me for what I had done. Donna Emelia appeared to grieve
                  deeply, asking if we could not return with King Moussy's black soldiers and
                  recover her dear Don Ricardo, even though he should be dead, and many other
                  half-crazy questions. In this manner we pushed up the river, under a beautiful
                  starlight sky, and by day-break next morning, were more than a dozen miles from
                  New Tyre. We then ran up a small creek, concealed the boat in the sedges, under
                  thick clusters of mangroves, and chose a place of encampment, from which we could
                  overlook all approach up the river. Here we remained till night, without hearing
                  or seeing aught of the cruiser. Next night, we rowed up the stream to a small
                  negro village, where Pablo expected to find a friendly chief of King Moussy's
                  nation. We found the town deserted, except by a few old men and children, the
                  warriors having been called to a great slave-hunt inland. But we found good
                  accommodations in vacant bamboo huts, and dispatched one of our faithful Kroos in
                  a canoe, to descend the river and reconnoitre. Before his return, however, the
                  hoped-for schooner, belonging to our Villeno house, came in sight. She was
                  hurrying to our factory; packed with a full cargo of slaves. Her skipper little
                  expected to meet one of his owners, and hear the bad news we had to relate. Next
                  day, our Krooman came back, with the intelligence that our storehouses,
                  barracoons, and dwellings were in ashes. The cottage at Palm Valley had not been
                  spared, and New Tyre was a wilderness again. But the British sloop-of-war had
                  gone, and we soon followed in her wake, after a brief anchorage in front of our
                  late thriving station, where we landed some of the slaves, to make better
                  accommodations for Donna Emelia and her Foula attendant. But the creole was
                  obliged, in her departure from New Tyre, to be content with less luxurious
                  quarters than my poor uncle had provided for her in coming there.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I NOW come to events in my life which show the lengths of folly to which a man can
                  be led by the influence of an artful, scheming woman. I was in my twenty-ninth
                  year. Donna Emelia was but little over twenty; but I became merely a child in her
                  hands. After leaving the Kambia, we ran along the coast for a hundred miles, till
                  we spoke a French brig bound for the Senegal. By this time, the creole had made me
                  promise to leave Africa at once. I found my uncle's papers and effects of much
                  greater value than either of us had supposed them to be. There was of ready cash,
                  in Bank of England notes, eight thousand pounds, and accepted drafts of the
                  Villeno partnership, on Spanish<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6322-00000045"/> ish and
                  French houses, to the amount of thirty-seven thousand dollars; making, with my own
                  cash in gold, over eighty thousand dollars. It was a fortune greater than I had
                  ever dreamed of; and I easily stifled what conscience I had left, when Donna
                  Emelia pictured the life we might lead together, with such an amount in our
                  possession. Pablo knew nothing of my uncle's charge to me. I informed him that I
                  desired to go up the coast to Senegal, and directed him to take the schooner's
                  cargo to the Congo station, which we held in the name of Diego Ramos. If he failed
                  to find Ramos, I empowered him either to shift the cargo at the station, or
                  proceed, as supercargo, to the Havana, accounting to our Cuban consignees. Pablo
                  promised faithful attention to my directions, whilst I led him to believe that he
                  would find me at the Congo on his return to Africa. Thus, practising deception to
                  the last, I parted from this really faithful man, transferring my uncle's
                  property, with my own and Donna Emelia's, to the French brig, which readily gave
                  us a passage to St. Louis, on the Senegal. Thence it was my design to take some
                  coast-bound vessel to the Straits, or to embark direct for France.</p>
               <p>In a short time we cast anchor in the Senegal, among a fleet of slave-vessels
                  loaded with the African staple. At this period (the year 1818) there was a brisk
                  movement on this river, on account of the losses which traders had sustained in
                  other parts of the coast by the interference, oftentimes illegal, of British armed
                  vessels, under commission of the Sierra Leone authorities. A treaty had been made,
                  some years before, between the restored king of France and the English government,
                  by which both nations agreed to suppress the slave traffic, but up to this time
                  the French factories had never been molested. We found brigs and galliots from
                  Martinique, Bordeaux, Marseilles, and Nantz, all ready to start, with heavy
                  consignments, for the West Indies, although three men-of-war, with the white flag
                  of France flying, lay at anchor outside the Senegal bar.</p>
               <p>We lost no time in looking up a vessel for our passage, and succeeded in finding a
                  Bordeaux brig, the Elisee, bound to her owners, with a general cargo of African
                  products. I engaged a cabin for Donna Emelia, who passed as my wife under our
                  assumed name of Morillo. As the brig was not to sail for three days, and I was
                  fearful of being recognized by some of the slave captains, who might have known me
                  at Rio Basso or New Tyre, I kept close aboard, and got all my shore news from the
                  captain, a Martinique creole, named Pinteaux. From him I learned that intelligence
                  of the breaking up of Villeno's establishments had reached the river, but could
                  ascertain nothing concerning Don Ricardo's whereabouts, whether dead or alive.
                  Pinteaux told me that the French were hurrying cargoes to supply the market which
                  Villeno had controlled, and spoke of a fierce slave-war then raging on both sides
                  of the Senegal. To fill up my time, I now began to make entries in a new journal,
                  and sealed all my old papers to stow away. I should have been glad to have opened
                  a fresh account, and blotted out the past of my life; but that was impossible.
                  Though I began a diary, as Felipe Morillo, conscience whispered to me that the
                  account of Felipe Drax, or Philip Drake, was not yet settled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>March 19, 1818, <hi rend="i"/>St. Louis, on the Senegal.—Here we are
                  delayed for three days. If Emelia were not with me, I would, perhaps, drown or
                  shoot myself; for I am miserable, in spite of all, in thinking of the past few
                  weeks. Where can my poor uncle be? Captain Estephe Pinteaux, our skipper, has
                  heard of the breaking up of Villeno's factories, but nothing more. I wish this
                  suspense was over, and we were off to sea again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>March 20.—Pinteaux says' that King Damel, the great Foula king, of
                  whom I have heard a great deal, is now sweeping the country with his slave hunts.
                  Hundreds of negro towns have been burned, on both sides of the river, and kaffles
                  are strung along all the inland trails. King Damel is one of the most powerful
                  princes on the Senegambia coast, and has loaded half a dozen vessels this season,
                  with his own subjects. He never scruples to resort to this means of keeping his
                  engagements with the traders. Pinteaux tells me that a conference of the
                  slave-captains has taken place concerning the British spoliations. They are making
                  arrangements with Damel, to have kaffles brought to points on the coast, from
                  which they can be shipped at once without being kept long in barracoons. This will
                  baffle the cruisers, should France join with England, as is expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>March 21.—I learn some important items from Captain Pinteaux; that
                  the French king has issued a decree for confiscating all cargoes and ships, taken
                  with slaves in the French colonies; and that the king of Portugal has forbidden
                  traffic in slaves north of the equator, and ordered all foreign vessels, with
                  slave cargoes, to be confiscated in the Brazils. Poor Pablo may be in danger, if
                  overhauled, as he is a Portuguese subject. Diego Ramos, likewise will be outlawed,
                  if this decree is enforced; Pinteaux says, however, that Brazilians will be
                  allowed to import in their own vessels from this coast south of the equator. It
                  seems the governments are determined to put the traffic down. All things
                  considered, I am a lucky fellow. A man to be envied. If I hinted otherwise to the
                  donna, I think her black eyes would flash. Poor Emelia, she loves me distractedly!
                  And she is a woman worth risking everything for.</p>
               <p>The above was scribbled in my new journal, the night we left Africa, when I
                  thought myself flying to a life of future romance and happiness. Donna Emelia
                  seemed the fondest of women. She was always at my side, during our voyage, till we
                  arrived in the harbor of Bordeaux. At that port we obtained passports, as Spanish
                  travellers, and ten days afterward found ourselves in the capital of France.</p>
               <p>My first business in Paris was to negotiate my uncle's securities, part of which
                  had French signatures. In a week I turned everything into cash, and in another
                  began to spend it. It was the first time that I had ever felt myself my own
                  master; and my freedom amounted to recklessness. The gaieties and dissipations of
                  Parisian life dazzled me like a child, and Emelia was not behind in this
                  enjoyment. Our money was a passport better than rank or title, and my partner's
                  rare beauty attracted all eyes when we appeared at any public place. Donna Emelia
                  spoke French fluently, whilst I often made blunders; and in the first month of my
                  fascination, I went everywhere with her, though afterward I became jealous of the
                  acquaintances we both made. Before we had six weeks of fashionable life, we had
                  full as many quarrels, and the creole exhibited a temper that I had not expected.
                  But I was far from wearying of her, though she coquetted with me as with all
                  others. Her brilliancy in society began to infatuate me, in the same way that my
                  uncle had been "bewitched." I was proud of her dress, her stylishness, and even of
                  the attention she drew, which made me jealous. She discovered her power over me,
                  and used it to blind and bewilder, till I soon became her fool, as much as her
                  lover. All this time, our money was melting. In six months, I spent nearly seven
                  thousand pounds, and the greater part of it on Donna Emelia's extravagant fancies.
                  Nearly one-half of all our fortune was dissipated, and I saw that, at the rate we
                  were going, both must be beggars in a year; I spoke to my wife, and she laughed.
                  When I insisted, she struck me with her diamond-handled fan, and said—"Voila!
                  monster! what would you have me do? Shall we leave this delightful, dangerous
                  Paris?"</p>
               <p>I was glad to hear the question, and answered "yes," immediately.</p>
               <p>"Well, I am ready, Felipe, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ange!</foreign>" she
                  simpered. "Where shall we go? back to Africa?"</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6322-00000046"/>
               <p>"Heaven forbid!" I replied. "Let us go to the West Indies. It is your native
                  climate. We can buy a plantation; we can be happy!"</p>
               <p>"Charming! I will do as you say. Paris is a tiresome place. Let us go to the West
                  Indies, my dear friend!"</p>
               <p>I was overjoyed at Emelia's readiness, and made haste to start, for fear she might
                  change her mind. I sent to secure state-rooms in some ship that was to leave Havre
                  for the Spanish Main, but hesitated in deciding what island we should choose for
                  our location, till Emelia insisted on going first to Cuba. We embarked for New
                  Orleans, in the United States, and from that city, crossed to Havana. My Parisian
                  experience warned me not to launch too freely into the life of this expensive
                  city, and Emelia appeared willing to second my prudence. In fact, she had become
                  satiated with excitement, and her whim, for the time being, was retirement and
                  luxurious ease.</p>
               <p>Meantime, I looked about for a banker, and gathered all the African news that was
                  stirring. I had never been in Havana before, though I knew my former house of Drax
                  to be familiar to the consignees of our Villeno house, who were named Gomez. In a
                  day or two I learned all that was to be known in the capital of the Antilles,
                  concerning what had taken place among slave-traders during a year past. But of my
                  uncle's fate, or of Diego Ramos, I could hear nothing. Since the destruction of
                  the Villeno settlements, it seemed as if they had passed out of the knowledge of
                  African traders. No one in Havana knew what had become of the men who had shipped
                  tens of thousands of slaves annually to this port, for a dozen years back. Other
                  factories and different interests, had taken the place of Rio Basso and New
                  Tyre.</p>
               <p>I soon grew satisfied, and Donna Emelia appeared to be, with Havana drives in
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">volantes,</foreign> and musical masquerades,
                  bull-baits, and going to church. The next thing was to select an estate, in which
                  to invest what remained of the money that we had been near making ducks and drakes
                  of, in Paris. I was inclined to prefer a plantation in Martinque, or a Dutch
                  island; but Donna Emelia wished to be among Spanish people. Finally, we agreed on
                  Cuba, and I found a handsome <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ranche,</foreign> in the
                  neighborhood of Matanzas, which I purchased, with the stock, for twenty thousand
                  Spanish dollars.</p>
               <p>Now, after a long apprenticeship in hunting and selling slaves, finished by an act
                  of treachery and fraud, upon the one who had been my master in the business, I
                  settled myself, in my thirtieth year, with a handsome wife, and a thrifty
                  plantation, on the "ever faithful isle" of Cuba. The business of sugar-growing was
                  new to me, but I had an experienced overseer, and a complement of willing slaves.
                  The plantation, though small, was a profitable one. A lovelier spot could not be
                  discovered between Havana and St. Jago. It was situated on a green promontory,
                  made by a deep creek, which nearly divided it from the main-land. The creek formed
                  a cove, in which a vessel of considerable draft might be safely anchored; and a
                  line of reefs ran out, sheltering the shore from heavy rollers, and extending into
                  the sea. As soon as I saw this secret harbor on my little domain, I was reminded
                  of many snug lagoons, and embayed arms of great rivers, which I had often suddenly
                  come upon in Africa, without previous suspicion of their existence, so completely
                  hidden were they by tropical trees and thickets.</p>
               <p>Having become a sugar-planter, I resolved to settle down to the business. For a
                  few months all worked to my satisfaction, and the novelty of our life gave it a
                  charm to Donna Emelia. But her restless disposition could not long remain without
                  change. She became weary of what she called our stupid convent, and began to pine
                  for something livelier. I humored her by occasional sional trips to Havana; but we
                  always returned dissatisfied, till at last she discovered a new amusement at
                  home.</p>
               <p>I prided myself on my knowledge of negro character. Certainly, if any white man
                  ever had opportunities for studying the black race, in slavery and freedom, I have
                  had such. Consequently, I had resolved, on turning planter, to become a model
                  master. I knew the qualities and dispositions of different African tribes, and my
                  first care was to ascertain what negroes I had to deal with. I found a few Foulas,
                  Coromantees, and Dahomans, but the majority Congo and Benin negroes. The first
                  three are intractable and high-strung—the others docile and rather affectionate.
                  The surprise of my darkies was great, the day after my taking possession, when I
                  called them up "by their tribes," and spoke some pleasant words in the negro
                  dialect to each of them. They threw themselves on their faces, snapped their
                  fingers, and appeared actually delighted. I then took the drivers aside, and
                  explained my wishes in regard to the treatment of my slaves. They embraced a
                  system of simple reward and punishment without severity. In all cases of
                  discipline, I gave out that I must be the tribunal of last resort, and my word
                  must be law or <foreign>fetish</foreign> to Mohammedans or Obeah-men, as we called
                  the pagan negroes. Our slaves soon comprehended my knowledge of their character,
                  and my plantation became a model of industry and contentment in its people. This
                  continued for several months, before any change took place or trouble arose.</p>
               <p>Although Donna Emelia contrived to gain the mastery of me in pretty much
                  everything, I stipulated that the plantation laborers were to be left to my
                  jurisdiction. But the donna had got weary of common enjoyments, and wanted
                  stimulus; so, one day, when I returned from Matanzas, I was met by my groom with a
                  frightened look. I demanded the reason, and at last obtained it. My lady had been
                  chastizing his wife, a good-looking house-slave, who had charge of the laundry.
                  The girl had offended Donna Emelia three days before, and had been flogged thrice
                  every day since that time, always in my absence. She was now in prison. The word
                  "prison" startled me, and I went to my wife, to inquire about the affair. Donna
                  Emelia was in good humor, and laughed, saying that the girl had been punished and
                  shut up for tearing a costly lace vandyke, but she should be released, and go to
                  her husband that evening. I smoked my cigar, and forgot the matter, till three
                  days afterward, my groom threw himself on his knees, and told me his wife was dead
                  or dying. This shocked me, and I demanded where the wench was, which the poor
                  fellow showed me, begging that I would not speak to his mistress. It was an
                  outhouse near the creek I mentioned before. I pried open the barred door, and
                  discovered the negress, lying naked, her back completely flayed, and covered with
                  flies. She was fastened by an iron chain to a post. Near by was hanging a slave
                  whip stiff with blood. The chain had eaten into the girl's flesh, ulcerating her
                  hips and stomach. Her husband, my groom, had discovered her dungeon, and crawled
                  to the door every night, to comfort her. But she was now past relief, and died
                  during the evening.</p>
               <p>I was bewildered at the terrible discovery, and by learning that the slave had
                  been beaten to the condition in which I found her by Donna Emelia's <emph>own
                     hand.</emph> At least a score of floggings were administered. My wife was in
                  the habit of shutting herself up alone with her victim, and beating her till she
                  became insensible. I could not have believed her capable of such cruelty, if my
                  eyes had not seen it. I taxed her warmly with the affair, telling her of the
                  girl's death, and she pretended to be greatly alarmed and grieved. She wept, and
                  swore the wench had insulted and provoked her beyond forbearance, and that she had
                  no idea of punishing her till greatly aggravated. Donna<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000047"/> Emelia's tears and seeming sorrow disarmed me of
                  resentment, and I agreed to say nothing more. The girl was buried, and I gave her
                  husband a handsome present, for the poor lad took on about the matter greatly.</p>
               <p>After this affair, my wife was fond and playful, as in former times. She told me I
                  must not be dull on her account, and that our home should be made livelier. There
                  were agreeable neighbors and visitors at Matanzas, and we should show them
                  hospitality. I acceded to this new arrangement, and our house was soon run down by
                  strange people. We had concerts, dances, serenades, and boating parties, and my
                  wife was more charming than ever before. Among other amusements, gaming was not
                  forgotten, and I was initiated into its mysteries by heavy losses, from which my
                  guests profited.</p>
               <p>After the flogging of the slave-girl, I supposed my wife to have done with such
                  measures, but I was to discover my mistake. My field negroes had become
                  insubordinate, and some had eloped from the grounds, although I was strict in
                  forbidding any cruel treatment on the part of slaves. My groom, the husband
                  before-mentioned, was one of the fugitives, and I had offered a reward for his
                  discovery. About this time I went to the south side of the island, for a week, and
                  on returning, found my house almost deserted. Donna Emelia was out, with her
                  friends, on a hunting party, so said the slave-woman whom I questioned. On further
                  inquiry I found it was a "slave-hunt." My wife had hit upon another excitement.
                  She had provided a pair of bloodhounds, and was off to the woods, with her
                  agreeable friends, to hunt my fugitive negroes. I hurriedly learned a few
                  particulars, mounted my horse, and followed as fast as I could, resolved to stop
                  the sport at all hazards.</p>
               <p>It was some hours before I succeeded in coming up with the party, and getting
                  alongside of my wife, I begged her in a whisper to return; but she laughed aloud,
                  and dashed forward, in company with a gaily-dressed young fellow, who I took to be
                  a mulatto. The <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chasseur,</foreign> or runaway hunter, with
                  his dogs, was some distance ahead, and I could hear the baying of the animals.
                  Galloping fast, I soon came in sight of the hunter, and his four dogs; two
                  ferocious bloodhounds, and two small ferrets, called <hi rend="i"/>finders. The
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chasseur</foreign> was running, with his long <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">mascheto</foreign> or sword, resting over his shoulder; holding
                  his hounds by a cotton rope secured to their collars. Just as I caught sight of
                  him, we heard the barking of the small dogs, and before I could interpose, the
                  hunter slipped their collars from his ferocious dogs, and they dashed off through
                  the thick forest. I had only a single glimpse of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >chasseur,</foreign> in his check shirt, straw hat, and bare neck, with a black
                  crucifix dangling from it; before he plunged after his brutes. He was on foot, and
                  could dart through the narrow paths, while our horses had to seek wider avenues;
                  but we followed as fast as possible, guided by the hounds' baying, until we
                  reached a broad, open space, shut in by high rocks, crowned with trees. Here we
                  saw the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chasseur</foreign> running toward a ravine, where
                  one of his dogs had thrown down a negro, whilst the other was pursuing two
                  fugitives up the rocks.</p>
               <p>As soon as this spectacle met her eyes, Donna Emelia struck her horse, and rode
                  swiftly ahead of our party, followed by the man who resembled a mulatto. I pushed
                  forward with the rest, and we came up in time to witness a horrible sight. The
                  fugitive negro was a fierce Coromantee, who had been but a week on the island
                  before he took to the woods. It appeared that he was determined to sell his life
                  dearly. The dog had sprung at his throat, and brought him down, but the black's
                  hands were tearing the jaws of his ferocious assailant. As we reached the spot,
                  there was a dreadful struggle going on, the hound and man rolling over and over,
                  the negro already covered with blood I glanced at Donna Emelia, who had reined in
                  her horse, and was patting his neck, whilst she eagerly regarded the combat. Then
                  I leaped from my saddle, and ordered the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >chasseur</foreign> to call his brute away.</p>
               <p>"He has tasted blood!" answered the man, coolly. "He'll never quit his hold, till
                  he's cut in two!"</p>
               <p>"Then cut him in two, scoundrel!" I shouted, greatly exasperated; but at this
                  instant the negro's hands relaxed their hold of the animal's jaws, and his body
                  sunk on the ground. The hound shook his head, like a tiger, and lifted the black's
                  neck in the gripe of his white teeth.</p>
               <p>"The fellow's dead!" grumbled the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chasseur,</foreign> "but
                  it's not my fault. He fought the dog. If he'd been quiet, like the others, we'd
                  have had no trouble!"</p>
               <p>I looked toward the rocks, as I heard this, and saw the other fugitives clinging
                  together on a ledge which they had gained, whilst the bloodhound was crouching
                  beneath, growling ferociously. Meantime, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >chasseur</foreign> took off his hound from the Coromantee, and slipped a
                  collar over the beast's neck again. Donna Emelia and the rest dismounted, and
                  collected about the slave, who was quite dead. His throat was torn open, his side
                  gnawed deeply, and the blood already formed a pool around his whole body. I was
                  disgusted, and turned away without speaking; nor could I address a word to my
                  wife, on our ride home. The two runaways captured belonged to my plantation, but
                  neither of them was my lost groom. His fate I learned afterward.</p>
               <p>I must hurry over that year. My wife grew unsettled, and I was unhappy. To drown
                  thought, I indulged freely in wines, and we had frequent quarrels and
                  reconciliations. I always believed myself beloved by Donna Emelia, and this made
                  me overlook a hundred things, till I discovered her baseness at the very last.</p>
               <p>Our visitors were numerous; but among all I liked one, named Da Souza, the least;
                  although he seemed an accomplished fellow, understanding several languages, and
                  making himself generally agreeable. He was quite a youth, and I believed him to be
                  a mulatto, though it was denied, he then passing for a Brazilian officer of the
                  Imperial Guard of Don Pedro. He was Donna Emelia's constant attendant, in our
                  parties or excursions, and tried to ingratiate himself with me in every way. At
                  last, I began to tolerate him, and even to find amusement in his society, so that
                  we came to be partners often in gaming bouts. Meantime, I was expecting to be made
                  a father, and Donna Emelia became soft and amiable in her manners, so that I began
                  to look forward to happiness again. Such was the state of affairs, when one day I
                  was addressed by a favorite slave, who had shown many marks of attachment to me.
                  He said that a Congo girl, in one of the huts, was sick, and desired to see me. I
                  went to the place, and found her in spasms, that reminded me of the strange
                  disease of my quadroon Marina, at New Tyre. She was convulsed, and as she
                  expressed it, her "bones were all cracking." I inquired what she had eaten, and
                  after some reluctance, she showed me some candied limes, which her mistress had
                  given her, and of which she had partaken till seized with her cramps. I then
                  administered some remedies, and took the fruit away to analyze it. It was
                  impregnated with strychnine, like the mangoes that Marina had eaten before her
                  death. The discovery horrified me; for it appeared to lay open a chapter of
                  iniquities. And before another day, I had more material for conjecture, or rather
                  proofs of all I could suspect. Some negroes, in digging near the shore, had
                  discovered a passage leading from our garden to a grotto near the reefs, that I
                  had never known to exist. In this grotto they found a negro man's body, nearly a
                  skeleton, hanging by the neck, its lower extremities washed by the waves, its
                  hands and feet both shackled. I examined it, and found that it must have been
                  there many months; the saline air had preserved<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC6322-00000048"/> the features, and I recognized them, at once, as
                  those of my lost Congo groom. But what was my surprise and terror at finding the
                  string, or halter, to be the remains of a silken cord and tassel, which had
                  belonged to my wife; to find on ledges of the grotto, several preparations of
                  strychnine, and, worse than all, to meet positive evidence of Donna Emelia's
                  recent visits to the death chamber, in a ring that I had lately given to her,
                  which I found beside a small marble pestle and mortar, on the ledge.</p>
               <p>I cannot describe my feelings at the strange discovery. I had barely sense enough
                  to secure the ring and the cord that held the skeleton. Then ordering the remains
                  to be buried, I got back to the garden and to my chamber, without seeing my wife.
                  I had no longer any doubt concerning Donna Emelia's devilish character. It was
                  evident that she delighted in cruelty and crime; that she had murdered Marina, the
                  slave-girl, the poor groom, and I knew not how many others. I wondered how I had
                  escaped myself, when we had so often quarrelled. Then, being unable to think or
                  act, I resorted to my usual stimulus, of spirits, until I lost all balance of
                  myself. What I did next I never knew, but I awoke to sudden consciousness of my
                  existence, to find myself seated at a table, with the Brazilian mulatto, Da Souza,
                  and others of my wife's companions. The cloth was covered with cards, and the
                  side-board was loaded with liquors and eatables. All this flashed at once on my
                  sight, but I had no recollection of time or circumstances previous. I could only
                  think of Donna Emelia, and mumble her name, whilst I dashed card after card on the
                  table, in a crazy manner.</p>
               <p>They told me afterward, that I had been playing all night, and my swindling
                  companions showed my signature to more than twenty notes of hand. When the party
                  broke up, I went to find Emelia, who denied me admittance to her chamber. I
                  continued drinking, and afterward fell into a deep sleep, from which I awoke to
                  realize my situation.</p>
               <p>During my crazy state, brought on by spirits and excitement, following the
                  discovery I had made, I had gambled a whole night, and lost, in round numbers,
                  forty thousand dollars; more than my plantation, and everything else I called my
                  own, could bring, at the best prices. I learned this from Da Souza, who held
                  several of my acceptances; but I learned other things from my wife, Donna Emelia.
                  She showed herself in her true character, in taunting me with being a drunkard,
                  and gambling my all away. I retorted by accusing her of murder, declaring all I
                  suspected, till she grew beside herself with rage and fright. There is no need to
                  describe our fearful quarrel. It was sufficient to me that I learned, by her own
                  confession, that she had deceived me even in her professed affection, and that the
                  child of which she was pregnant, was Da Souza's. The last blow staggered me; I
                  cursed the brazen woman, and hardly knowing what I did, fled from my house, to
                  Matanzas, in search of the mulatto. Fortunately for him, I did not find him at
                  that time.</p>
               <p>Three weeks after this, I recovered from a miserable round of dissipation in the
                  city of Havana, and found myself reduced to less than a hundred dollars, out of
                  all I had lately possessed. My notes and acceptances had been negotiated at once
                  by the sharpers who ruined me. I ascertained that Da Souza and his comrades were
                  installed in my house, with the Donna Emelia, and that continual feasting and
                  debauches were the order of the day with them. I had no redress, and my own
                  excesses had enervated me, so that I began to meditate suicide, when I suddenly
                  encountered my uncle, Ricardo.</p>
               <p>It was after a night of hard drink, that I got into an <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >estaminet,</foreign> trying to steady my nerves with a cup of strong coffee,
                  when a stranger suddenly advanced, and confronted me. At the first look, I could
                  scarcely recognize Don Ricardo; so haggard was his face, so thin his body, like
                  one in the last stage of consumption. But I felt his glittering eyes burning me,
                  as he exclaimed, in a hollow tone, "A word with you!" and led the way before me,
                  whilst I followed, shaking like a leaf. When we reached the street, he turned and
                  seized my arm, hurrying me along by his side, till we reached a public house on
                  the Mole, which we entered, and I found myself with him in a retired room. I knew
                  my uncle's determined character, and that I had injured him beyond forgiveness. I
                  began to feel glad to meet him, and when he asked me what I deserved at his hands,
                  I answered recklessly—"Death!—a dog's death!" My uncle had a knife in his grasp as
                  I said this, and I expected to feel its point; but he seemed suddenly to change
                  his purpose, and covering his face with both hands, burst into a flood of
                  tears.</p>
               <p>This sight of the man I had wronged weeping so bitterly, was worse to me than a
                  thousand daggers, and I threw myself on my knees before him, trying to take his
                  hand. At first he spurned my attempt, till I mentioned Emelia's name, when he sat
                  down and listened to me. I made a clean breast. I told him every circumstance,
                  from my first intimacy with the donna at New Tyre, until the last wretched scenes
                  at our Matanzas plantation. He heard me out, and then clasping my wrists, asked me
                  if I swore to all that I said, and if I dared to go with him to Donna Emelia. I
                  replied, by offering to set out immediately, and we soon found ourselves driving
                  post-haste speed for my late <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ranche.</foreign> We galloped
                  all night.</p>
               <p>All that I had heard relative to the orgies of Da Souza, and Donna Emelia was
                  verified on our arrival. Meantime, I had drawn from my unfortunate uncle some
                  brief answers concerning himself. He had been taken by the British cruiser to
                  Sierra Leone, and there lingered several weeks at the point of death. Being saved,
                  with a constitution entirely shattered, he succeeded in eluding the authorities,
                  and escaped from the settlement, by the aid of some Kroomen, who placed him on
                  board an American slaver. After many hardships and struggles, he reached Havana,
                  and encountered me.</p>
               <p>On entering the plantation grounds, I met a slave, who recognized me, and
                  conducted us quietly to the house, which was in a blaze of candles. We entered the
                  hall, and passed to a veranda, whose open windows were crowded with men and women,
                  the new guests of my late home. I remained under the orange trees, but Don Ricardo
                  stepped forward, and gained the casement. My glance followed him, as he crossed
                  the lighted saloon, to a sofa, where Donna Emelia sat with the mulatto, Da Souza.
                  I saw her eyes flash, and heard her scream, followed by the sudden report of a
                  pistol. When I looked again, the room was in uproar. Don Ricardo lay at full
                  length on the floor. My uncle had shot himself through the heart.</p>

               <p>FROM the day of my uncle's suicide I can date my hardened life as a slaver. I
                  shall dwell only on those portions of it which are marked by my connection with
                  the cruelties and horrors of my profession. The remainder may as well remain a
                  blank. It would furnish only repetitions of dissipated scenes and abandoned
                  courses, such as have brought me to my present situation in old age.</p>
               <p>My experience with Donna Emelia, ending in ruin, left me poor and desperate; and
                  when the last dollar of my ill-gotten wealth had been squandered, I was glad to
                  cast about for the means of existence. My home during half a lifetime had been
                  Africa, and I looked to Africa still as the place to mend my fortunes. Seizing the
                  first opportunity that presented itself, I obtained a berth as <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">medico,</foreign> or surgeon out, in a Spanish schooner, called
                  the Diana, bound for the river Bonny. At the Bight we joined company with four
                  other craft, and were engaged in getting our complement at Bonny settlement, when
                  we were all attacked by a British man-of-war. Having plenty of pluck and powder,
                  we defended ourselves boldly, till compelled to strike. Many of our slaves jumped
                  overboard, into the jaws of sharks. I succeeded, with a number of the crew, in
                  seizing one of the boats, and escaping to the woods behind the village. Here we
                  were assisted by a Calabar chief, whom I had formerly known, till the cruiser
                  hauled off with her prizes, and a Brazilian brig, from Bahia, arrived and took us
                  aboard. This was the Florida; and ten days after the Diana's capture, this
                  Brazilian shipped a cargo of four hundred and fifty prime negroes, and sailed for
                  America; I acting as a supernumerary doctor. I shall now drop detail, for the
                  purpose of giving, in detached portions, the leading incidents of my career for
                  the ensuing seven years. Some of the facts are from memory, and others have been
                  preserved in a few written scraps, which never took the form of a regular
                  journal.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>THE BRAZILIAN BRIG GLORIA.</head>
                  <p>I left old Calabar in this vessel, and before being a week out, discovered that
                     captain and crew were desperadoes of the worst kind. Once off the coast, the
                     ship became half bedlam and half brothel. Ruiz, our captain, and his two mates,
                     set an example of reckless wickedness, and naught but drinking and rioting
                     could be seen among the men. They stripped themselves, and danced with black
                     wenches, whilst our crazy mulatto cook played the fiddle. No attempt at
                     discipline; but rum and lewdness seemed to rule all. I was at first frightened
                     at this state of things; but my appetite for liquor, contracted since that
                     unfortunate intimacy with Donna Emelia, soon brought me to the level of the
                     rest. Meanwhile, our slaves were crammed in hold, cabin, and peak, and packed
                     like herrings, on the shelves, around our vessel's sides; and what was worse,
                     gratings were kept down half the time. Shrieks and groans of stifling wretches
                     below echoed our frantic orgies above.</p>
                  <p>I had some sparks of human feeling left, and, in my sober moments, realized the
                     horrors of this dreadful passage. On the eighth day I took my rounds of the
                     half deck, holding a camphor bag in my teeth; for the stench was hideous. The
                     sick and dying were chained together. I saw pregnant women give birth to babes,
                     whilst chained to corpses, which our drunken overseers had not removed. The
                     blacks were literally jammed between decks, as if in a coffin; and a coffin
                     that dreadful hold became, to nearly one-half of our cargo, before we reached
                     Bahia. The younger women fared best at first, in being allowed to come on deck,
                     as companions for our besotted crew. Of this part of their devilish practices I
                     kept clear, but drank as hard as the rest. Toward the end of our run, which
                     lasted nearly six weeks, the mortality had thinned out the main hold, and some
                     scores of women were driven below as company for the males. The quarrelling and
                     bestiality that then took place among the savages became sickening. They tore
                     and gnawed each other, in fights for rum-rations which our captain ordered
                     them, and for the possession of the miserable wenches. Such scenes as I
                     witnessed on that voyage can neither be told nor imagined. At last we arrived
                     at Bahia, and landed our cargo. Will it be believed that I remained on board
                     that vessel? It is too true. I had got used to the unnatural excitement, and
                     craved it.</p>
                  <p>I never knew who owned the Gloria, for during our stay in Bahia, I was half
                     intoxicated most of the time. She was a staunch, handsome clipper craft, and
                     deserved better masters. We ran down from Bahia to Rio de Janeiro, for a cargo,
                     and sailed for Africa, with the same officers and crew.</p>
                  <p>We cast anchor this trip, in a small river, not far from the American colony of
                     Liberia, and our captain took me ashore, with his first mate, and a dozen of
                     the crew, well armed and sober. The latter condition, however, was not long
                     preserved, for we had several breakers of rum with us, as a "dash" for the
                     negro chief, King Boatswain, a half-Christian black, who was a crony of our
                     captain, Ruiz. That day we spent at his village, in a feast, and at night he
                     summoned several hundreds of his warriors. We then sallied out against a tribe
                     of powerful blacks, called Queahs, attacked them, whilst sound asleep, burnt
                     their bamboo huts, and made a general slaughter. Every man and woman was
                     massacred. The boys and girls only were spared, and driven to the river, where
                     we soon transferred them to the Gloria's bowels. Next day, Captain Ruiz invited
                     King Boatswain to a big banquet on board the brig. The old fellow was sick, but
                     his son and over two hundred of his principal men came aboard. We had abundance
                     of rum and tobacco; but the former, thanks to my medical skill, was heavily
                     drugged with laudanum; the consequence of which may be guessed. Before night,
                     we had every darkey under hatches, and were off with a flying jib; our entire
                     cargo costing no more than the "dash" which Captain Ruiz had given to the
                     savage chief.</p>
                  <p>I sailed in the Gloria half a dozen trips, occupying nearly two years, with the
                     "soldiering" time between voyages. Her fate I will relate briefly.</p>
                  <p>We had left the Verds, and were making southerly in ballast, when we overhauled
                     a Portuguese schooner, and ran alongside. She had a full cargo of slaves, with
                     a large quantity of gold-dust, and our captain, Ruiz, proposed to attack her.
                     The crew were ready, and, inspired by rum, soon mastered the schooner's hands;
                     our captain blowing out the brains of a passenger who owned the gold. Some of
                     the Portuguese leaped overboard, with spars; but Ruiz had a boat manned, and
                     knocked the survivors on the head with axes. The gold-dust and negroes were
                     then quickly transferred to the slaver, the schooner was scuttled, and we kept
                     on our way to the land with 190 slaves. The next day we encountered a storm,
                     which almost capsized the brig. Our negroes, not being packed, rolled to
                     leeward, in a heap, and when the vessel righted and threw them back, they got
                     frantic, and tried to break through the gratings. Ruiz was half drunk as usual,
                     and suspecting a rising, ordered the crew to fire their muskets through the
                     grating, till the negroes became quiet. Forty were killed and wounded by this
                     foolish freak, and had to be cast overboard. We then ran for Accra, and landed
                     at Papoe, a town belonging to a Dahoman chief, where we found 600 negroes,
                     waiting for a Spanish slaver, soon<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6322-00000050"/>
                     expected. Ruiz bought 400 of these, paying in the Portuguese schooner's
                     gold-dust and hauled our course for the Atlantic voyage.</p>
                  <p>But this was to be my last trip in the blood-stained Gloria. Hardly were we out
                     a fortnight before it was discovered that our roystering crew had neglected to
                     change the sea-water, which had served as our ballast, in the lower casks, and
                     which ought to have been replaced with fresh water in Africa. We were drawing
                     from the last casks, before this discovery was made; and the horror of our
                     situation sobered Captain Ruiz. He gave orders to hoist the precious remnant
                     abaft the main grating, and made me calculate how long it would sustain the
                     crew and cargo. I found that a half gill a-day, would hold out to the Spanish
                     main; and it was decided that, in order to save our cargo, we should allow the
                     slaves a half-gill, and the crew a gill each day. Then began a torture worse
                     than death to the blacks. Pent in their close dungeons, to the number of nearly
                     five hundred, they suffered continual torment. Our crew and drivers were
                     unwilling to allow even the half gill per diem, and quarrelled fiercely over
                     their own stinted rations. Our cargo had been stowed on the platforms closer
                     than I ever saw slaves stowed before or since. Instead of lowering buckets of
                     water to them, as was customary, it became necessary to pour the water in half
                     pint measures. Those furthest from the gratings never got a drop, and became
                     raving mad for drink. Presently, diseases of different kinds added to their
                     misery. Fevers and fluxes made the air reek with poison; and deaths followed so
                     fast, that in a short time, at least a hundred men and women were shackled to
                     dead partners. Our captain and crew, as well as myself, drank hard, but thirst
                     and disease kept down all licentiousness. Matters grew worse daily, for the
                     dead were not thrown overboard, nor the living served with water, or even food,
                     except the rotten yams that could be reached where they lay. At last Captain
                     Ruiz ordered the hatches down, and swore he would make the run on our regular
                     water rations, and take the chances of his stock. That night we caroused, and
                     satisfied our thirst, whilst the negroes suffocated below. Next morning came a
                     storm, which drove us on our course a hundred knots. Two days afterward, Ruiz
                     and four of the men were taken suddenly ill, with a disease that baffled my
                     medical knowledge. Their tongues swelled, and grew black; their flesh turned
                     yellow, and in six hours they were dead. The first mate went next, and then
                     three others of the crew, and a black driver, whose body became leprous with
                     yellow spots. I began to notice a strange, fetid smell, pervading the vessel,
                     and a low, heavy fog on deck, almost like steam. Then the horrid truth became
                     apparent. Our rotting negroes under hatches had generated the plague, and it
                     was a malaria, or death-mist that I saw rising. At this time all our men but
                     three, and myself, had been attacked; and we abandoned the Gloria, in her long
                     boat, taking the remnant of water, a sack of biscuit, and a rum beaker, with
                     what gold-dust and other valuables we could hastily gather up. We left nine of
                     our late comrades dead, and five dying, on the Gloria's deck. After running for
                     two days, we struck a current, and in three more were drifted to the island of
                     Tortola, one of the Leeward Isles. We made a landing on the reefs, and were
                     picked up by some fishermen.</p>
                  <p>Falling sick at Tortola, I parted from my comrades of the Gloria. We had
                     divided our ill-gotten gold-dust, and my share amounted to ¥130 sterling, with
                     which, after my recovery, I took a vessel for Rio de Janeiro. I there procured
                     a berth as surgeon once more, and kept sober for nearly eighteen months, during
                     which I made three thousand dollars by private ventures. But ill-luck came to
                     dog me again. I shipped in a Spanish schooner from Porto Rico, and encountered
                     new disasters.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>THE SPANISH SLAVEN PONCHEETA.</head>
                  <p>She was a fast schooner, designed to make quick passages, and smuggle her
                     cargoes ashore on the coast of Brazil, thus escaping an import duty of $10
                     a-head. We had Brazilian papers, and our arrangement was to run cargoes into
                     different rivers and creeks; then make for Bahia, and report "in ballast," or
                     "coasting." The Poncheeta was rated by imperial license, as a vessel of 100
                     tons, but was actually only 80 tons burden. This was to provide for
                     emergencies; the law allowing only<emph>five</emph> slaves to be carried for
                     every <emph>two tons.</emph> By getting a permit on fraudulent measurement, we
                     could cram twenty-five per cent. more cargo, without appearing to break
                     regulations.</p>
                  <p>The Poncheeta was commanded by a Porto Rico Spaniard, named Antonio Mendez, an
                     old slave-smuggler. We shaped our course for Badagry, in the Bight of Benin,
                     which was at that time, 1828-9, doing a thriving business in slaves, in the way
                     my uncle had done at Rio Basso. It was a general rendezvous for slavers; and
                     the markets was generally well-stocked, by kaffles arriving through the kingdom
                     of Dahomey. From the Rio Volta, where I first saw Africa, south to the Niger,
                     and north to the Gambia, the intervening country was then engaged in internal
                     slave wars of the fiercest kind. Dahomans, Ashantees, Foulahs, Mandingoes,
                     Sherbroos, Fellatahs and Bambarras, preying on each other like wild beasts,
                     kept the slave-market constantly supplied. We soon had 700 slaves on board, in
                     our eighty ton vessel; whilst the packing was going on, I went to one of the
                     barracoons, where 800 sick and old slaves, of both sexes, had been confined,
                     for want of buyers. The majority had eaten nothing for a week, as they were
                     considered useless stock. Before we weighed anchor, these 800 wretches were
                     taken out in canoes by the Badagran negroes, and sunk in the stream with stones
                     about their necks. A week before we arrived, three hundred had been knocked on
                     the head, for the same cause, <abbr>i. e.</abbr> age or sickness rendering them
                     unsalable.</p>
                  <p>Our schooner was loaded beyond capacity; and the deck had to be fitted with
                     temporary platforms, or shelves, as high as the taffrail. Above these, stiff
                     netting was drawn, to prevent the shackled couples from leaping overboard, to
                     commit suicide. In walking the deck, we sometimes trod on a hand or foot thrust
                     out from the lower tier. Such was the condition of the Poncheeta's cargo, when
                     we left the Bight. On our first night, there was a frightful battle among the
                     slaves for room and air, although our hatches were off. The crew and overseers
                     restored order by the use of whips and handspikes, but not till seventeen
                     negroes had been choked to death, or so badly gnawed in their throats by their
                     neighbors, that we were obliged to drown them. So tightly were the wretches
                     wedged below, that the sailors had to drag the dead ones out by main pulling of
                     their legs.</p>
                  <p>About a week out we encountered a severe gale, which drove us furiously before
                     it, all our canvas being taken in. I had, up to this time, kept to my
                     resolution of abstaining from drink whilst on ship-board; but the close, sultry
                     weather, and stench of the negroes, sickened me, so that I indulged that night
                     pretty freely, in potations of Jamaica spirits, until I dropped off to sleep. I
                     was awakened by a crash, as if the skies were falling, and a yell like a
                     thousand tigers. Springing from my bunk, near the after gangway, I heard
                     Captain Mendez calling to his mates, whilst the men were running to and fro
                     like mad. Nothing was to be seen; no light apeak or abeam; and the night rainy
                     and as dark as a wolf's mouth. I ran toward the binnacle lamp, and found the
                     helm swinging loose, and at that moment there came a vivid flash of lightning,
                     by which I saw Captain Mendez, with a face like his shirt. "Save yourself,
                     doctor!" cried he, "the brig's sinking!" I rushed to midships, and heard the
                     negroes screeching on both sides; then back to the stern davits, where our men
                     were lowering the boats. How I got in with the rest, I never knew, but ten
                     minutes after this, I found myself with Captain Mendez, and half the crew, in
                     one of our boats, the rain dashing on us; we rowed about for an hour, before
                     day appeared. The gale had lulled, but the heavy rain was like a waterspout.
                     All this time, we could hear the slaves screeching on board the Poncheeta. When
                     morning broke, we saw her a-lee, her decks almost level with the water's edge.
                     We did not dare to pull nearer, but lay by, till she went down, a little over
                     two hours after the collision which caused her to founder. She had been struck
                     on the beam, by a large vessel, which tore away her starboard rail and netting,
                     the whole length, crushing our chained blacks on their shelves, which
                     occasioned the dismal shrieks we had heard. The Poncheeta sprung a leak, and
                     filled gradually, till she sank, with nearly 400 living human beings manacled
                     on her slave decks. One of our boats must have foundered also, with several of
                     the crew. We were picked up by the which had run us down, and which had lain to
                     during the fog. It was an armed East Indiaman, the Mersey, bound for Zanzibar,
                     and by her we were landed at Kahenda, on the Guinea coast.</p>
                  <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6322-00000051"/>
                  <p>The loss of the Poncheeta, left me penniless again; as all I possessed,
                     including private papers and diaries, went down with her. At Kahenda we found
                     several slavers under Brazilian colors. I had been to the place before, when my
                     uncle had dealings on the Congo, near by. Captain Mendez got passage for
                     himself and me to Angola, the Portuguese settlement, whose governor he knew.
                     Here he was lucky enough to receive the command of a schooner which the
                     governor was dispatching to the Brazils, on his own account, with a cargo of
                     slaves. I resumed my place with him, as surgeon, and again started for the
                     Brazils, where we arrived safely.</p>
                  <p>By his successful disposal of the Portuguese governor's venture, Captain Mendez
                     was much elated, and speedily fitted up another clipper schooner. In February,
                     1830, I again sailed with him for Africa, and in thirty-three days arrived at
                     the river Gallinas, not far from the Rio Basso. At this place we were to ship a
                     cargo of slaves, and on the day of our arrival I learned, for the first time,
                     that its thriving factories were controlled by an old acquaintance, Don Pedro
                     Blanco, whom I had first met at our Villeno settlement of New Tyre. The
                     Spaniard recollected me at once, and was particular in his regrets concerning
                     my uncle, whose death he had heard of, soon after it took place. He knew
                     nothing of Diego Ramos, nor of my elopement with the Donna Emelia; my change of
                     name having baffled all trace of us. I was glad to encounter this old
                     acquaintance, and to accept his offer of a situation at Gallinas, with a fair
                     prospect of remuneration. I assisted Captain Mendez in selecting a good cargo,
                     and then settled down, as half clerk, half doctor, for Don Pedro Blanco.</p>
                  <p>I was at this time forty years old, and ten years had passed since I made the
                     acquaintance of this man on the Kambia. At our first interview, I was in
                     possession of influence and wealth, he an adventurer, seeking location. Since
                     that period, I had squandered, and he had accumulated a fortune.</p>
                  <p>My acquaintance with negro dialects was of immediate use to my employer.
                     Gallinas was a depot and market for slaves brought from all stations that
                     penetrated the Guinea coast, as well as territory further south. The river from
                     which the town took name was full of small islands; and on several of these,
                     near the sea, as well as on the banks, were located factories, barracoons,
                     dwelling-houses and storehouses. The success of Blanco had attracted a dozen
                     other traders and agents to locate here, and the Don was a sort of prince among
                     them. In African fashion, he supported a harem and quite a retinue of house
                     servants, guards, etc., besides the clerks and overseers of his barracoons. I
                     kept my place at Gallinas six years; and during that time made one voyage as
                     clerk, and one as captain of a slaver, to the West Indies. Passing over my
                     factory life, which was a routine of receiving consignments, shipping slaves,
                     and trading with chiefs who brought kaffles from the interior, I come to the
                     two voyages that ended my intercourse with Don Pedro Blanco.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>THE SCHOONER NAPOLEON.</head>
                  <p>The Napoleon was a 90 ton Baltimore clipper, a model for speed and symmetry.
                     She came out from Cuba, in ballast, as a new craft, and made two successful
                     trips before, at Don Pedro's request, I supplied the place of mate and surgeon
                     in her last voyage, when she sailed freighted with 250 full-grown men, and 100
                     picked boys and girls, for the Cuban market. The cargo was consigned to my old
                     friend Gomez, and rated All. By actual calculation, the average cost per head
                     of the 350 was $16, and in Havana, the market average was $360; yielding a net
                     profit for the whole, if safely delivered, at $360 per head, of $120,400 on the
                     slaves; subtracting $20,000 from this, the average cost of the clipper's round
                     trip, including commissions; and her earnings would be <emph>one hundred
                        thousand dollars</emph> in round numbers. Such were the enormous profits of
                     the slave-trade, in 1835; and since that period, with greater risk, have come
                     greater average returns to successful voyages.</p>
                  <p>But the Napoleon had trouble before her departure. The men slaves composing her
                     freight comprised some of the fiercest warriors of the Kassoos, the Fi nation,
                     and the Sherbroo Bullom people, who had been lately provoked to a cruel war by
                     our traders. It was with difficulty that they were got on board the clipper,
                     though secured by one foot chains round the neck, beside their ankle irons.
                     Arrived at the boats, a rush was made by several, for the purpose of leaping
                     into the sea; and thumb-screws had to be clapped on them before they would be
                     quiet. These warriors were finely-built negroes, and the boys and girls
                     handsome and spirited.</p>
                  <p>We had a splendid run, and had expected to make the Moro by night, when our
                     dreaded enemy, a British cruiser, was signalled, and all sail crowded on the
                     clipper. It was near sunset, and our captain, an old slaver, was sure of
                     slipping away easily. But the pursuer proved a crack sailer and overhauled us
                     rapidly. Capt. Mina was in despair, when he saw the trim frigate raking down on
                     our windward quarter. We had a stiff breeze, and two hours more would bring us
                     to a point of the island where our cargo could be landed safely. But the wind
                     fell off abruptly, our sails flapped, and the moaning sea announced a tropical
                     tempest. Instantly everything was clewed, to meet the expected tornado, but we
                     encountered only a heavy, sultry rain squall, which turned sky and sea the
                     color of ink. The water shot down perpendicularly on our decks, and thunder and
                     lightning followed incessantly. This deluge ceased in an hour, but the darkness
                     continued, and we could see the lights of Matanzas harbor gleaming through the
                     mist. A sudden thought struck me, which I communicated to Captain Mina; and in
                     ten minutes more, our crew were in the boats, with sweeps, towing the clipper
                     landward. I took my station in the leading boat, and steered for the reefs and
                     point of land, which I well remembered inclosed my former plantation, and
                     before the moon broke out, that night, our clipper Napoleon was safely anchored
                     behind the high woods, her topmasts shipped, and her hatches unbattened.
                     Whether the British cruiser's crew thought she had foundered, or was the Flying
                     Dutchman, I never knew. But a few days after, we entered the harbor, with Porto
                     Rico papers, and Gomez, our consignee, placed a hundred thousand dollars credit
                     to Blanco's account. Five thousand dollars of that sum I received as a <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">douceur,</foreign> when we returned to Gallinas to relate the
                     story, and he Don promised I should command his next vessel.</p>
                  <p>Active life and a prospect for the future had made me a comparatively sober man
                     during five or six years. With the addition of my clipper salvage, I had
                     amassed some ten thousand dollars; and feeling flattered by Blanco's estimate
                     of my skill and judgment, I thought to make a stroke at once for another
                     fortune. When the Don offered me a second trip, as captain of a vessel, I
                     eagerly accepted it, together with permission to invest in half the cargo. The
                     demand for negroes at the Brazils had increased, and prices were understood to
                     be as good at Bahia, as at Cuba. But not satisfied with this, I proposed to Don
                     Pedro, that we should risk the landing of this cargo at a place called Ponta
                     Negra, between Bahia and Cape Frio. He liked the project, as it promised large
                     returns, and offered me my choice of some half dozen vessels then at Gallinas.
                     There were two handsome American craft, the Fanny Butler and the Venus, from
                     Philadelphia, Baltimore built, then to be had; a Monte Videan brig, the Banda
                     Oriental, and a Brazilian bark, which last I selected, on account of her
                     capacity and serviceable look. We loaded her with 520 prime slaves, and I took
                     leave of Africa, on my first voyage as a captain, and in high hopes of a
                     fortune.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>THE BRAZILIAN BARK AGUILA.</head>
                  <p>I hauled out of Gallinas flats, on the 6th of September, 1836, in the bark
                     Agulia, and set sail for the Brazils. I took an oath, before going on board,
                     not to touch a<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6322-00000052"/> drop of liquor during
                     the voyage. The Aguila was 200 tons burden, and I had taken particular care to
                     have her well fumigated and amply supplied with provisions and water, and
                     arrangements made for health and comfort, as far as possible, of our valuable
                     stock. All things promised well. I had the gangs up every day, in rotation,
                     under their overseers, to exercise and sing. I made them dash buckets of cold
                     water on each other, regularly, and fed them well, with rice and yams.
                     Altogether I looked for a prosperous trip; but I was doomed to woeful
                     disappointment.</p>
                  <p>The mid-passage was safely accomplished, and on sighting the Brazilian coast, I
                     stood for Ponta Negra, to make a landing. I knew the place well, having visited
                     it with Captain Mendez, and also the factor, who would take charge of my slaves
                     for dispersion up and down the coast, to different markets. Finding good
                     anchorage off the cliffs, I lost no time in going ashore, under a bright moon,
                     discovering thereby a sheltered creek, which promised the desired facilities
                     for landing. My mate and myself left the boat in this creek, and walked about
                     half a league, to the handsome cottage and lookout of Don Felix, a noted and
                     courteous smuggler, whom I had met once before. He received us with Brazilian
                     hospitality, placing his house, servants, family, and fortune at my disposal,
                     and gave us a sumptuous dinner, after which we walked to his observatory, to
                     smoke our cigars. The prospect from this elevation of the moonlit ocean and
                     coast was a magnificent one; but the most interesting object to me, was the
                     Aguila, at anchor, with her cargo that was to make me a wealthy man once more,
                     in spite of all my past ill-fortunes; and I was impatient to close
                     preliminaries, that the disembarkation might proceed at once.</p>
                  <p>But Don Felix puffed and sipped his wine for a half hour, before we rose, for
                     business. I was turning one more look at my vessel, when suddenly I saw a
                     bright flash run along her deck. The next moment an explosion rent the air, and
                     shook the rocky foundation of the house with roaring echoes. A volume of smoke
                     and flame shot up from the water, and hung like a black cloud, before its
                     contents descended. When we could discover the sea again, my vessel was no
                     longer there, but a confused mass darkened the moonlit water. The Aguila's
                     magazine had blown up, and every soul perished on all her close-packed cargo of
                     500 human beings. My mate and the boat's crew were all the survivors, save one
                     poor maimed sailor, who was cast ashore alone, to tell of his escape from the
                     frightful accident, that sent his comrades to eternity.</p>
                  <p>Three long months passed away before I was able to leave my bed, at the
                     hospitable house of Don Felix. The blow shattered my constitution and left me a
                     mere wreck. It was a year before I could count myself able to undertake the
                     shortest voyage. I found friends and sympathy, but felt myself a ruined man.
                     Nevertheless, it was now necessary for me to make a struggle for existence, and
                     I found myself, in 1838, once more on the African coast.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I WENT to Africa from Rio, in 1838, to act in the capacity of interpreter for a
                  party of slave-traders, who designed visiting some of the interior African kings,
                  at their capitals. There were three, beside myself, and we landed at Cape
                  Appolonia, on the Gold Coast. After a short visit to the town of the Appolonia
                  negro king, we procured guides and burden-slaves, and started across the Fantee
                  country, for Ashantee; falling in with several black slave-traders on our path. At
                  the river Proh, we hired an escort of Ashantee warriors, and went by short stages
                  to different negro towns, holding palavers with the savage chiefs. As we had a
                  large supply of goods, for presents, or "dashes," and dispensed them liberally on
                  our way, the news of our march was soon carried forward to the king, who sent
                  messengers to meet us. These negro-envoys were dressed in red velvet vests, yellow
                  cotton shirts, white breeches, and carried gold swords and canes in their hands.
                  They had a red velvet umbrella, large enough to cover a half dozen men. With these
                  special guides we then hurried on to Coomassie.</p>
               <p>Quacoe Dooah, the King of Ashantee, was not to be seen till the third day after
                  our arrival, but he had given orders for our good treatment. We were comfortably
                  lodged and a guard set over our goods. Meantime, I began to take notes of the
                  place and people, some scraps of which I have preserved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Feb. 9, 1839.—This is the capital town of the great Ashantee
                  Kingdom, of which I have heard so much. It must be very populous; for at least
                  50,000 persons were collected in the great market place, on our arrival. Hundreds
                  of richly-dressed black officers are to be seen strutting about, with gold-covered
                  canes, and wearing bracelets and anklets of the precious metal, larger than
                  slave-shackles. Apakoe, the royal interpreter, called on us to-day, and I
                  astonished him by my knowledge of Ashantee. I hear the big drum beating,
                  announcing a great human sacrifice to the king's fetish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Feb. 10.—The Ashantee sacrifice has commenced, and I hear that 500
                  men, girls, and boys are to be offered. The orgies began last night, and I was
                  awakened at daybreak by the war drum. A procession of the victims passed our huts
                  soon after. One poor wretch had a knife passed through both cheeks, and his two
                  ears cut off, and dangling from the blade and handle. A long spear was thrust
                  under his shoulder-blades, through the tendons, and he was led along by this,
                  bleeding like a bullock. The crowd blew horns and beat drums on both sides. Then
                  followed a young woman, stark naked, with both breasts cut smoothly off, and her
                  hips and belly stuck full of arrows. Another female walked behind, with her two
                  breasts skewered by a knife, and a cord passed through her nostrils, to conduct
                  her. There was no end to the horrid ingenuity of torture exhibited. To-morrow our
                  great palaver takes place with King Quacoe Dooah.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Feb. 11.—To-day I saw the King of Ashantee, and was present at a
                  bloody sacrifice. We were presented by the gold-sworded fellows who had been our
                  hosts. The king sat in a gilded wooden chair, in the midst of his chief men.
                  Velvet umbrellas, with immense brass-mounted handles, covered them like a canopy.
                  The tops of these umbrellas blazed with gold figures of beasts and birds. A long
                  retinue of guards and household attendants stood around, carrying gold swords,
                  silver and gold dishes, tobacco-pipes, and silk flags. The display of barbarian
                  riches was dazzling to the eye. All this wealth of the Ashantee king is derived
                  from the enormous profits of his slave-sales. Apakoe tells me he has sold ten
                  thousand slaves, since the last rainy season, a little over five months, beside
                  killing as many in slave-hunts and sacrifices.</p>
               <p>After our interview with the king, we followed a grand procession to the palace.
                  Before reaching it, a great musket-firing commenced, the big drum was beaten, and
                  a rush of the populace announced a change of scene. The frightful orgies then
                  began, by a gigantic savage dashing out the brains of a victim with his club. A
                  gourd was held, to catch his smoking blood, and his heart was cut out with knives,
                  and held up to the king. I had heard that it was usual for each chief to sink his
                  teeth in the bloody heart, but this ceremony was dispensed with. Some of the
                  brutal soldiers, however, actually drank, before our eyes, of the victim's blood,
                  from the gourd in which they caught it. The rest of this unnatural sacrifice, I
                  will not relate. It was a confused massacre. Heads and limbs were severed, or
                  sawed off by dull knives, and danced on poles; bodies of men and women were
                  disembowelled, and dragged about, and at last left to the dogs to devour. Such was
                  the sacrifice at Coomassie.</p>
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6322-00000053"/>
               <p>We remained in Coomassie ten months, stipulating for slaves; and before we left,
                  the place was visited by an English missionary, Rev. Mr. Freeman, who seemed to be
                  in favor with the king. He preached once or twice to the same wretches whom I had
                  seen perpetrate the massacres, and they appeared to be quite attentive. From
                  Ashantee we travelled inland through various districts of a beautiful country.</p>
               <p>We spent the rainy season at the Portuguese settlement on the Rio Cacheo. In
                  September, 1839, we set out for Dahomey, and in October we reached Abomey, the
                  capital. I need not dwell on the scenes witnessed at that place. The Dahoman king
                  collected his fetish men, and gave a great feast, it being the season of the
                  annual "customs" or slave-markets. Four thousand slaves were sold to the traders,
                  of which we bought and branded 700, and dispatched them with the kaffles, to the
                  great slaving depot of Whydah. A hundred of our purchase were Amazons, or
                  women-soldiers of the king's guard, who had been engaged in a revolt, and were
                  punished by being sold off. They were fine-limbed and robust females, made healthy
                  by their exercise in military service. From Abomey, we started for Ayudah, or
                  Whydah, where I met with an old acquaintance. My notes will explain who this
                  was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 5, 1840.—This day I have met my old friend and enemy, Da Sonza,
                  the Brazilian creole. I have never suspected before that the great Whydah
                  slave-trader was my quondam rival. His negro <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >sobriquet</foreign> of Cha-Chu was the only name I knew him by. He recognized
                  me as soon as I did him, and I am to dine at his house to-morrow; with our trading
                  party. Da Souza, or Cha-Chu, as everybody calls him, is apparently a reckless
                  voluptuary, but the shrewdest slave-trader on the African coast. Whydah has been
                  built up by his enterprise, and he lives the life of a prince. His mansion here is
                  like a palace, and he has a harem filled with women from all parts of the world.
                  He keeps up, it is said, a continual round of dissipation, gambling, feasting, and
                  indulging in every sensual pleasure, with his women and visitors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 6.—Last night I was at Cha-Chu's orgie, and it was an orgie
                  indeed. His house is the very abode of luxury. He must squander thousands. But
                  what is money to a man who has a slave-mine in Dahomey, bringing him hoards of
                  wealth yearly, by a hundred vessels. Da Souza enjoys almost a monopoly of the
                  coast-trade. Blanco has been his only rival of late years, it is said. This
                  mulatto is revelling in wealth, whilst I, whom he plundered and disgraced, am a
                  dependent, poor and broken down wretch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 8.—This morning Cha-Chu met me, and proposed to lend me a wife
                  whilst I remained in Whydah. "You shall have French, Spanish, Greek, Circassian,
                  English, Dutch, Italian, Asiatic, African, European, or American," he said,
                  laughing; "or, if you prefer an old flame, there is Donna Emelia." I started, and
                  repeated the name. "Yes!" cried Cha-Chu, "she's here, though, I confess, rather
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">abattu.</foreign> I've not seen her for a year or two.
                  I advise you to select a younger companion." This ended our confab. And so the
                  brilliant, unprincipled woman is here, in the seraglio of Cha-Chu, with blacks,
                  whites, and browns. A cast off, forgotten concubine. 'Tis a wonder she has not
                  poisoned Da Souza!</p>
               <p>I left Whydah, to return with our traders, in a ship, which had been consigned to
                  them from Brazil. We took a cargo of 1,000 Africans, and lost only 80 on the
                  return voyage. My life in Africa was finished, and I was glad to be offered a
                  permanent situation in Brazil, under the trading company which I had served as
                  interpreter. Of Donna Emelia I received news, a year after my visit to Whydah. She
                  had been transferred, at her own request, from Cha-Chu's harem to that of the king
                  of Dahomey, and there died miserably. This was the end of that splendid, but
                  wicked woman, who had been the ruin of my uncle and me.</p>
               <p>My business in the Brazils was partially professional. A few miles from Rio, on
                  the bay, was located a large slave-depot, and hospital ground. This was for the
                  reception of sick and disabled negroes. It was by no means a charitable
                  institution, however; but planned with a close eye to profit. It was owned by the
                  joint-stock company, of which I was an employee, and my Ponta Negra friend, Don
                  Felix, a director. This company had established agencies along the coast, at
                  intervals, for 2,600 miles, and controlled an immense smuggling traffic in
                  negroes. Its agents to Africa, whom I had accompanied as interpreter, made
                  extensive arrangements whilst there with all the kings we met, for an increase of
                  the trade, and provided also for consignments of stock from the coast. Its South
                  American head-quarters were at Pernambuco.</p>
               <p>My specialty, under this company, was to superintend the slave-nursery, or
                  fattening-farm, for negroes who were not merchantable on arrival. Here they were
                  brought in feluccas, or driven by squads, overland, to be "doctored" for the
                  market. On arrival, they presented the most deplorable and disgusting spectacle.
                  The greater part were living skeletons; some unable to stand; some covered with
                  ulcers; some with cramped limbs, from packing on shipboard. They often dropped
                  dead in the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">corrals,</foreign> or yards. Others were
                  ophthalmic, others scrofulous, and many insane. These wretches were to be
                  "doctored," and fatted for sale, or, if that could not be done, allowed to die
                  speedily. The majority were reduced by dysenteries, and required delicate
                  handling, in order to save them. Very often, gangs would be brought to our pens,
                  by outside traders, or by farmers, and offered for sale as low as five, three, and
                  even one dollar a-piece. We lost about forty per cent., on the average, of all
                  that came. When seasoned, we sent the survivors off in gangs to market. I might
                  relate many horrors connected with this service, in which I continued nearly seven
                  years, till I became sick of a fever, and was nearly dying myself. On recovering,
                  I was transferred, through the influence of Don Felix, to other masters, and
                  another establishment.</p>
               <p>I now hurry to the conclusion of the record of my wretched life. I was verging on
                  toward three-score, and had nothing to look back on, but disasters and crimes;
                  nothing to hope for in the future. My health had long ago been shattered, and my
                  earnings soon went in dissipation; for I remained addicted to the habit of
                  drinking, which first occasioned my downward fortunes. My new location was on one
                  of the Bay Islands, so called, near the coast of Honduras, in the Gulf of Mexico.
                  Here, a slave-depot and farm were established, to which cargoes were brought, in
                  American clippers, from slave settlements near Cape Mesurado, in Africa. The
                  negroes were landed, under the name of colonists; and the company had permits from
                  Central American authorities. They had a branch farm on the Rio Grande, in Texas,
                  which was broken up, and its stock dispersed, at the breaking out of the war
                  between the United States and Mexico.</p>
               <p>Our island depot was admirably suited for its purpose, being near the mainland,
                  and with good anchorage on the ocean side. It was about seven miles long, by three
                  in width, and well wooded. Our farm and nursery were in the centre, on a navigable
                  creek. Here we received Bozal blacks, of all ages, and set them at work in
                  agricultural operations, and making goods for the African market, to exchange for
                  their fellow-countrymen. They were taught to gabble broken Spanish and English,
                  accustomed to discipline, and well fed and treated. I saw no misery among these
                  negroes, such as I had been accustomed to witness all my life; as it was our
                  company's object to get them in prime marketable condition.</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6322-00000054"/>
               <p>This joint-stock company was a very extensive one, and connected with leading
                  American and Spanish mercantile houses. Our island was visited almost weekly, by
                  agents from Cuba, New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, and New Orleans.
                  During the continuance of the Mexican war, we had 1,600 negroes in good order, and
                  were receiving and shipping constantly. The seasoned and instructed slaves were
                  taken to Texas, or Florida, overland, and to Cuba, in sailing-boats. As no squad
                  contained more than half a dozen, no difficulty was found in posting them to the
                  United States, without discovery, and generally without suspicion. A single negro,
                  sent by special agent, as far as Savannah, would pay all his cost and expenses,
                  and fifty per cent. profit in the market. The only large loss the establishment
                  had suffered, before I arrived, was that of a vessel, called the Amistad, in which
                  the slaves rose, and took possession, after killing the captain. They then
                  threatened the helmsman with death, if he did not steer them back to Africa; but
                  he deceived the negroes, and ran for the United States coast.</p>
               <p>The Bay Island plantation sent ventures weekly to the Florida Keys. Slaves were
                  taken into the great American swamps, and there kept till wanted for the market.
                  Hundreds were sold as captured runaways from the Florida wilderness. We had agents
                  in every slave State, and our coasters were built in Maine, and came out with
                  lumber.</p>
               <p>I could tell curious stories, if it were worth while in my condition, of this
                  business of smuggling Bozal negroes into the United States. It is growing more
                  profitable every year, and if you should hang all the Yankee merchants engaged in
                  it, hundreds would fill their places. Take the word of a dying man, there is no
                  way the slave-trade can be stopped but by breaking up slave-holding. Whilst there
                  is a market, there will be traders; and the entire system is a premium on
                  wholesale robbery and murder. Men like me do its roughest work; but we are no
                  worse than the Christian merchants whose money finds ships and freight, or the
                  Christian planters who keep up the demand for negroes.</p>
               <p>My connection with the island terminated in 1853, when I came out to Baltimore, on
                  business, connected with the depot. Unfortunately, I was intrusted with money, for
                  a firm in New York city, on account of goods for the African trade. In Baltimore,
                  I was overtaken by my old courses, and after a drunken spree of a week, found
                  myself without a dollar, in a low lodging-house, at Fells' Point, the resort of
                  thieves, gamblers, slaving sailors, and such company. Whether I gambled away the
                  money in my possession, or was robbed during my debauch, I never knew. But I was
                  left in a state of helpless destitution, and shortly afterward committed to the
                  city workhouse as a vagrant. Since that day I know not how I have existed half the
                  time. I begged my way to Philadelphia, and to this city. Here I shall end my
                  miserable life, without being able to look back on one day of happiness in my
                  entire career. May God forgive me for my crimes, and have mercy on me hereafter;
                  and may my story serve some good purpose in the world I am leaving.</p>

               <p>The ship Venus, mentioned above, was an American clipper, said to be the sharpest
                  ever built at Baltimore. She left that place, July, 1838; went to Mozambique, and
                  took a cargo, all the while under United States colors; landed 860 negroes near
                  Havana, under Portuguese colors; and was afterward sold, and her name changed to
                  "Duquesa di Braganza." Her original cost was estimated at $30,000. Her entire
                  expenses, including first cost, up to the time of her landing the 850 negroes,
                  could not have exceeded $100,000. Her<pb n="100" xml:id="VAC6322-00000055"/>
                  negroes actually, it is said, brought $340 per head, or nearly $300,000; of which
                  nearly two-thirds was net profit.</p>
               <p>Gov. Maclean, of Cape Coast Castle (whose wife was the celebrated poetess, "L. E.
                  L"), makes the following estimate: "A prime slave, on that part of the coast, with
                  which I have most knowledge, costs about 50 dollars, in goods, or about 25 to 30
                  dollars in money, including prime cost and charges. The same slave will sell in
                  Cuba for 350 dollars readily; but from this large profit must be deducted freight,
                  insurance, commission, cost of feeding during the middle passage, and incidental
                  charges, which will reduce the net profit to, I shall say, $200 on each prime
                  slave; and this must be still further reduced, to make up for casualties, to
                  perhaps, $150 per head."</p>

               <p>The N. Y. <title>World,</title> in an article on this subject, remarks that, in
                  1856, during the month of July, the deputy U. S. Marshals said they were satisfied
                  that, during the preceding <emph>three</emph> weeks; at least <emph>three</emph>
                  vessels a week had sailed from this port to engage in the slave-trade, and that
                     <emph>fifty</emph> had sailed during the year. From that time the fitting out
                  of slave vessels has been on the increase. Not a week passes but a vessel is
                  seized in our harbor or at the wharves, and every arrival from Cuba brings us news
                  of the capture of a slaver, most of which sailed last from New York.
                  Notwithstanding the vigilance of cruisers, hundreds of Africans are landed in Cuba
                  every month. Over 2,500 negroes have been taken from slavers this year, and landed
                  at Key West, to be sent back to Africa by our government.</p>
               <p>The nefarious business is assuming gigantic proportions. Humanity, justice, and
                  national character, demand some strong interposition; and it is to be hoped the
                  foregoing "Revelations" will have a tendency to awaken public interest to our
                  awful responsibility as a Christian nation.</p>
