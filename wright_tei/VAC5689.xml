               <p>"To-morrow is my last day at school. It hardly seems possible that the time has indeed drawn near when I must bid adieu to my kind teachers and the dear school companions I have learned to love so well, and go out into the great world, where I shall meet nothing but strange faces and cold, repellant glances. If I had dear parents to welcome me to their home, with tender words and loving caresses, I should feel the separation less. But, alas! I am an orphan. Oh, the bitterness of that word! None but those who have felt the loss of a parent can realize the loneliness of an orphan's life; none but those can tell what it is to lie upon a bed of sickness, and listen in vain for the soft, tender accents of a mother's voice, or long for the pressure of her cool hand upon the burning, fevered brow. Yet I am not quite alone. When I leave school, I shall go to live with Aunt Agnes, at Graham Lodge, as her beautiful home is called. I know but little about her, save that she<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC5689-00000005"/> is the only sister of my mother; and I will try to love her for her dear sake."</p> 
               <p>Thus was I musing in the stillness of my own room at Madame Lyle's Establishment for Young Ladies, a few days before the time fixed for my departure. I was soon to leave the place which had so long been to me a home, for new and untried scenes, and imagination was busy with the future, until, under her magic pencil, things appeared to me through a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coleur de rose</foreign> medium. I had been placed in Madame Lyle's care when but a child, and could remember little of my former home, unless visions of a darkened room in which lay a pale invalid, with great hollow eyes, which, in their restless glitter, were painful to look upon, and a tall, dark gentleman ever by her side, ministering to her wants with the gentleness of a woman, could be called remembrance. After that, my garments were all of mourning, and people looked upon me pityingly, for they said I was an orphan. I was too young then to realize the loss I had sustained, but as I grew older, and heard my companions talking of home and friends, I would sigh as I thought, I am not like them-I am an orphan. Thus my school-days passed. During the vacations, the other pupils would leave for their respective homes, but I always remained. Sometimes a tall, dark, regal-looking lady would come and visit me, who Madame informed me was my Aunt Agnes Graham, and for whom that lady seemed to have a great respect; and she would bend her stately head and press upon my lips a little frosty kiss that would burn long after she had left me, and was just like the sensations I experienced after pressing the cool, white snow to my brow. But I always shrank from her-caring nothing for the costly presents which she gave me-and at length, from some cause, her visits ceased<pb n=""/> entirely. A few weeks before the time appointed for my departure, Madame had showed me a letter she had that day received from Aunt Agnes, bidding me come to her when I left school, and I now sat dreaming of my future in my Aunt's stately home. While I was thus occupied, my roommate and most intimate friend, Jessie Irving, entered. There was a happy light in those soft, blue eyes as she approached, and, laying one little white hand upon my arm, said, persuasively, "Claude has arrived, Laura darling, and has expressed a wish to be presented to the dear friend about whom I have written him so often. Will you not gratify that desire, dearest?" There was no denying to Jessie Irving anything that she plead for, so I allowed her to lead me to the drawing-room; where her brother awaited our coming. Although prepared to behold an unusually interesting specimen of masculine humanity, by the glowing accounts of Jessie, who considered her brother perfection itself, yet I felt that she had not said any too much in his favor. Claude Irving was tall, and finely formed, with a pale, intellectual face, and deep, earnest, spiritual blue eyes, which seemed to read the hidden thoughts of the person they rested upon. Before the interview was over, I found myself almost envying my friend the possession of such a brother. Somewhat of my feelings I imparted to her, as we sat in the dusky twilight of our own room, when, with a merry laugh, she replied, "Do you know, Laura dear, that I had been weaving together, for my own amusement, a pretty little romance, in which you were to be the heroine, while Claude took the part of the hero, and which was to end, as all true love stories do, by the marriage of the two most important personages; and had quite made up my mind that some not distant day was to behold the consummation of my plans? for I know that you<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5689-00000006"/> are in every way worthy of each other; but to day I learned, for the first time, that my anticipations were never to be realized, for Claude is engaged to the daughter of one of his parishioners. But," she added, musingly, "it is, no doubt, all for the best. My queenly Laura seems hardly fitted for the onerous duties of a country minister's wife."</p> 
               <p>I was surprised to hear Jessie speak thus. I had not given my little friend credit for such wise ideas, and the thought of her turning match-maker amused me excessively; but there was not one regret in my heart for the failure of her plans. I was young and enthusiastic, with all a young girl's dreams of happiness, and a future filled with admiration and conquest. With my free, proud spirit, I scorned the narrow limits of a country village, and, though I already admired and reverenced Claude Irving, yet I would not have given him my hand. I wished him to be my friend, but nothing more, and therefore, though I knew not why, I drew a sigh of relief at the announcement of his approaching marriage.</p> 
               <p>The following day brought a crowded house to witness the closing exercises of the school. Jessie looked sweetly in her simple dress of white muslin, and a murmur of admiration greeted her appearance before the audience. Her theme was "The Moral Sublime," and the graceful, yet forcible manner with which the subject was treated, proved the fair authoress to possess talents of no mean order. My turn came last-for I was to read the valedictory. I was conscious that I looked well as I stood before the throng of people, all waiting curiously to hear my production, and I read in a voice which never wavered, but which fell in clear intonations upon my ear like the voice of another, until I had finished my essay. Then there was one universal burst of applause, and a perfect shower of bouquets rained upon the stage. As<pb n=""/> I was bowing over the last bouquet, I encountered the gaze of Claude Irving, riveted upon my face with an expression which caused the blood to dye my cheeks with scarlet and my heart to throb with a new and strange emotion. It must have been magnetism that drew my eyes in that direction, for he was seated in an obscure corner of the room; yet I felt that some one was watching me, and not as the others-from motives of curiosity-but with a feeling of strong interest. He was leaning forward and regarding me intently, and the look which flashed from those earnest eyes haunted me long after. When it was all over, however, and he came to congratulate me, he was the same as before-grave, ministerial and polite, even friendly-but nothing more.</p> 
               <p>When the hour of parting came, Jessie gave vent to her sorrow at the separation in a flood of tears, and though I tried to comfort her by promising to write often, yet, after she had gone, I went to the little room where we had spent so many happy hours, and wept, as I thought that the parting might be forever. When my escort called for me, two hours later, I had cried myself into a severe headache; and when the last familiar object had receded from view, I leaned back in the carriage, and drawing my veil over my face, gave myself up to the thoughts which thronged my mind, firmly believing I should never be happy again in this world.</p> 
               <p>It was a lovely June morning when I reached Grahamville, the village in which my aunt resided. I found a carriage waiting for me at the depot, in which was seated an elderly lady, of mild and pleasing countenance, who introduced herself as Mrs. Miller, the housekeeper at Graham Lodge. There was an air of dignity and refinement in Mrs. Miller's appearance, unusual in one in her situation in life, and I felt instinctively that she must have seen "better days." We<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5689-00000007"/> chatted pleasantly as we rode along, and my opinion of the lady increased as I listened to the choice language that fell from her lips, and the high-bred repose of her manner heightened the charm of her fascinating conversation.</p> 
               <p>At length, after riding for a considerable distance, my companion announced our approach to Graham Lodge, and, in a moment more, we were sweeping up the long, circular avenue that led to the house. It was a stately mansion-gray with age-and reminded one of the descriptions I had read of the old English manors. Upon the veranda stood a lady, whom I felt could be none other than my Aunt Agnes. Looking back now, over the past years, I can remember that her appearance impressed me as singular. She must have been very beautiful in her youthful days, for, though one guessed, from her prematurely aged appearance, that some great sorrow had crushed all the young blossoms of hope that had sprung up in her pathway, and left it forlorn and desolate; yet there was still almost a weird beauty in the pale, haughty face, from which the dark, haunting eyes looked forth, like clouded stars in their misty splendor. As she took my hands and pressed her lips to my forehead, uttering, in a cold though not unmusical voice, a welcome to Graham Lodge, there rose before me a thought of the future spent in her society, and I realized somewhat of the utter uncongeniality between this cold, proud woman, and one of my ardent, southern temperament, as my school-mates had been wont to call it. Still there was something fascinating about her, and, after the day was done and I laid my head upon my pillow, in one of the elegant suite of apartments which had been appropriated to my use, there were not as many regrets for the past as anticipations of future happiness that mingled with my dreams on that my first night at Graham Lodge.</p>

               <p>The first few weeks of my life at Graham Lodge flew quickly by; but after the novelty of my situation wore off, and I became somewhat accustomed to the monotonous life led by the mysterious inmates of that gloomy abode, I began to feel lonely, and sigh for more congenial companions than Aunt Agnes, who, wrapped in the mantle of coldness and distrust, allowed my little overtures of friendship to pass unheeded by her, whom, as the sister of my dead mother, I would have loved with a daughter's love and affection, and the warm-hearted, though equally reserved, Mrs. Miller.</p> 
               <p>Of Aunt Agnes I saw but little, as she kept her room most of the time. I was certain there was some dark mystery connected with her past life, though how or what it was I could not then determine. She never went into society, and no company ever found their way to Graham Lodge-a state of things which surprised me not a little, for I had learned that the society in <choice>
                     <sic>Gramhamville</sic>
                     <corr>Grahamville</corr>
                  </choice> was unusually good for so small a place. It was a beautiful spot-shut in by mountains upon one side and a broad expanse of water upon the other, and possessed great attractions for the refined and wealthy. A number of tasteful villas had been erected here, which were occupied during the summer months by the families of the rich merchant princes and others of B--, while here and there a professional gentleman was to be found, or perhaps<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5689-00000008"/> haps a party of tourists, attracted thither by the beauty of the scenery. It seemed indeed as if nature had spared no pains to make this place agreeable and attractive. So I knew that it was not the want of congenial society that caused my relative to lead such a hermit life, and though I said little upon the subject, yet I wisely drew my own conclusions. I think Aunt Agnes perceived the necessity of my having something to love, for, to my great delight, she presented me with a beautiful little black pony, to which I gave the somewhat fanciful name of Hyacinth. I was less lonely during the rest of the Summer, for when I got tired of the house I would have a race over the hills with Hyacinth, or a ramble in the woods after wild flowers. When Autumn came to our quiet home, it brought no changes, unless the bright-robed trees, gorgeous in crimson and scarlet and golden purple, gave to the old mansion a gayer and more cheerful aspect.</p> 
               <p>I had written regularly to Jessie Irving since we parted, and her loving letters had often had the effect to "drive dull care away," and while away many an hour that would have otherwise hung heavy on my hands. And now I received another letter, containing the announcement of Claude's approaching marriage, and pleading hard for me to be present at the wedding. Aunt Agnes readily gave her consent when I asked her if I might go, and, one lovely September day, I started for Cheswell, the village where my friend resided, and where Claude was pastor of a small church. Jessie was delighted to see me, and taking me to her room, insisted upon my lying down, though I assured her I was not in the least fatigued, and, as the weather was quite warm, sat by my side fanning me and talking in her low, musical tones, till at last, in spite of my assertions to<pb n=""/> the contrary, I fell into a sound and refreshing slumber. When I awoke Jessie was nowhere to be seen; but, hearing her voice floating up from the little parlor below, I arose, and after brushing my tangled curls and donning a dress of snowy muslin, with no ornament, save a cluster of scarlet berries lying upon my bosom, I descended the stairs and entered the parlor unannounced. Claude was seated beside her, and, though it seemed to me, in the first glance that I gave him, that he was looking paler than formerly, yet it must have been imagination, for Jessie would have been the first to have noticed any change in one so dear to her. His greeting to me was cordial in the extreme, though at times there seemed to be a slight constraint in his manner, and I often felt him watching me, though when I raised my eyes he would avert his gaze and appear almost unconscious of my presence. He was a very agreeable and entertaining companion, however, and could I have rid myself of the impression that he was trying to study my character, whenever I found the deep, earnest eyes fastened upon my face, as though striving to penetrate the hidden recesses of my soul, I am afraid I should have been led to think him almost as near perfection as Jessie herself.</p> 
               <p>That evening, after we had retired to our room, I asked Jessie to tell me of Claude's future wife, and, in compliance with my request, she related the following:</p> 
               <p>"Two years before, while Jessie was an inmate of Madame Lyle's boarding school, Claude Irving had come to preside over the little church at Cheswell, and, being a stranger in the village, had taken board at the house of one of his parishioners. Mr. Gordon had but one child-a beautiful but fragile girl, the idol of her parents, and, indeed, of the whole village; for Lily Gordon's amiable disposition and modest<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5689-00000009"/> deportment won her many friends, both among the rich and poor. As the daughter of his host, Lily was much in the society of the young minister-and what wonder is it that, unconsciously to herself the gentle girl, in her guileless innocence, revealed to Claude Irving that she loved him? She had not even confessed it to herself; and yet, to others, it revealed itself in the radiant beauty of her young face and the varying tint of her cheek when he sat beside her, and the restlessness which pervaded her manner when he was absent. Claude Irving saw it, too, and, although in his brief day-dreams there had mingled visions of a stately, dark-eyed woman with a lofty, intellectual countenance, who would call him husband; yet, after all, he might never find such an one, and if he should ever chance to meet the embodiment of his ideal, would she love him as purely and unselfishly as did this girl-woman, whose love for him amounted to veneration? Oh, Claude! did there not, in the dim vistas of the future, which your questioning glance sought so eagerly to penetrate-did not visions arise of a time when, in anguish of spirit, your pale lips would murmur those saddest of words, it might have been? But no! the future was hid from his view, and no warning voice whispered of disappointed hopes and vain regrets, and Claude Irving asked the beautiful Lily Gordon to be his wife, believing that he loved her quietly and unselfishly, while Lily was supremely happy in the love of the man whom she almost adored. But, Laura darling,"-and Jessie's blue eyes, so like her brother's, sought mine in the moonlight-"until I met Lily Gordon, I could never bear to think that my cherished plan would remain unfulfilled-that my Laura would never be to me in name what she has so long been at heart-a sister. But I now know that it can never be. Claude loves Lily and will make<pb n=""/> her happy, and my queenly Laura will yet rejoice in the love of some kindred soul, leaving me to laugh over the failure of my matrimonial schemes, and say it was all for the best, and I would not have it otherwise."</p> 
               <p>But that night, in the stillness of the midnight hour, when Jessie was slumbering sweetly by my side, and my thoughts were busy with the story I had heard, I sighed involuntarily as I thought of the beautiful Lily Gordon as though, unconsciously, a great wrong was done her. The next morning, when I awoke, the sun was streaming brightly in at the window, and, chiding myself for my indolence, I arose, and making a hasty toilet, descended the stairs in search of Jessie. As I expected, she was out in the garden gathering a bouquet; and, after the usual morning greeting, Jessie proposed that we waive ceremony and pay a short visit to Lily Gordon, whom I was anxious to see; and as I gave my consent readily enough, we started, a few hours later, for Ivy Cottage, the home of the Gordons. When we reached our place of destination, we were shown into the cool parlor, while the servant went to inform her mistress of our arrival. Soon there was the patter of light footsteps upon the stairs, and the rustle of a lady's garments, and in another moment Lily Gordon stood before us. She was a beautiful girl of about seventeen summers, but fragile and delicate as the flower whose name she bore. She was very pale, without a tinge of color in the waxen cheeks, and the dark, changing gray eyes, shaded by the long, silken lashes which swept her fair cheek, gave a serious, thoughtful expression to the fair young face. The golden brown hail rippled back in wavy masses from the blue-veined temples, and was gathered in a careless knot at the back of the finely shaped head. She wore a dainty, white morning-wrapper, which well became<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5689-00000010"/> the slender, graceful form, and which was confined at the white throat by one single rare and costly gem. Altogether, she seemed like a beautiful vision, as, in her etherial loveliness, she floated into the little green parlor, a smile of welcome parting the rosebud mouth as she took my hand and told me, in a graceful, winning way, that I hardly seemed a stranger, as our mutual friend, Jessie, had so often talked to her of me that she already felt somewhat acquainted. After a cosy two-hours' visit, we returned to the parsonage, and I was as deeply in love with the fair girl as even the enthusiastic Jessie could have wished.</p> 
               <p>During the few days which intervened before the wedding, Jessie and I were often at Ivy Cottage; and as I saw more of the beautiful Lily Gordon, my love and respect for her insensibly deepened.</p> 
               <p>At Claude's request, the marriage was to take place in the little church of which he was pastor, so that all those who felt so disposed could be present at the ceremony; and, as Lily agreed with him in everything, it was settled that the wedding was to take place in the morning, and that later in the day the bridal party would start on the wedding tour, which would necessarily be a short one, as Claude did not wish to neglect his ministerial duties. The arrangements were simple and unostentatious-only a wedding breakfast, at which a few select friends were to be invited. Jessie and I were to remain at the parsonage during their absence, and we promised ourselves much quiet enjoyment in that time.</p> 
               <p>The wedding-day dawned bright and clear, and, at the appointed time, the bridal party swept down the aisles of the dim old church and stood before the altar. Very beautiful was the sweet Lily Gordon in her white robes, with the bridal veil falling so gracefully about her slender form, and very touching<pb n=""/> ing was the expression of perfect love which rested upon her fair young face, as she stood by the side of him who was even then vowing to love and cherish her; and the bright sunshine crept in at the window and rested like halo of glory 'round the pure brow, making her look almost angelic, as she made the responses. Many were the murmurs of admiration at the almost unearthly loveliness of the bride and the manly beauty of the bridegroom, as they left the church; but a touch of sadness rested upon every face, for such loveliness seemed too fair for earth.</p>

               <p>At last it was over-the good-byes had all been spoken, and the newly married pair were on their way to a distant city, as fast as the "iron-horse," which had stood so impatiently at the station but a half hour before, could carry them; and, wishing them "God-speed," Jessie and I went back to the parsonage to while away the time as best we could until their return.</p> 
               <p>That evening, as we sat in the parlor, looking out of the long window into the pretty garden, over which the moon poured a flood of silvery radiance, we talked of the past and the long halcyon days we had passed together at Madame Lyle's.<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5689-00000011"/> Then, at last, our conversation turned upon Claude's marriage, until, at last, we came to talk of love, and which was the most lasting-the ardent love of youth, of which the poets have so often sung, or the calmer and deeper emotion of our maturer years? I said to Jessie-speaking rapidly in my earnestness-that I could not imagine how one, who had once truly and earnestly loved, could ever, under any circumstances, feel the same emotion for another. If I ever loved, it would be with a deep, undying, never changing affection, which would be as lasting as my life; while Jessie thought that a person who had once loved and been disappointed in the one on whom they had lavished the wealth of their heart's best affections, might, in after years, love again; but it would be calmer and more gradual, and proceeding from the esteem which they felt for the object which inspired it, and which, from constant intercourse, gradually deepened into love. As an example, she cited the case of a widow lady, whose wedding we had recently attended. Years before, while she was but sixteen years of age, she had met and loved a man some years her senior, of polished and pleasing exterior, but to whom the parents of the girl objected, as they did not think he was calculated to make their daughter happy. But love is proverbially blind, and the willful girl, who thought her parents were prejudiced, and that they objected to her lover on account of his poverty, determined to marry him at all hazards; and, accordingly, they eloped together, and, proceeding to a neighboring <choice>
                     <sic>vilage</sic>
                     <corr>village</corr>
                  </choice>, were married. The parents of the girl, when they discovered how matters stood, determined to "make the best of it,"-as the saying goes-and took her back to her old home, and endeavored to make everything as agreeable as possible to their children. For a few months after their<pb n=""/> return everything went on smoothly; but, after a while, the man's real disposition began to show itself. He was a cold, selfish, calculating person-harsh and tyrannical to the wife whom he had married for her money, and a certain share of good look which she possessed-and the young wife soon learned that there was nothing congenial between them. When they had been married some two years, she awoke to the knowledge that there was no love left in her heart for the man, the very tones of whose voice had once the power to thrill her whole being; and, from that time, she lavished all the wealth of her affection upon the child which had come to cheer and bless her lonely life. From the hour she made that discovery she was a changed woman. The lesson was a bitter one, but she was the better for having learned it, and its beneficial effect upon her character was apparent during the whole of her after life. At length her husband died, and, with her little boy, she came to reside with a relative in Cheswell, where she had led a very praiseworthy life-going about among the poor and afflicted, and actively engaging in all benevolent works. About three years before, she had met her present husband, and the warm friendship which grew up between them had gradually ripened into love; and when, for the second time, she took upon herself the marriage vows, it was with a firm reliance upon the good qualities of mind and heart which a long acquaintance with the man of her choice had proved him to possess. And thus she was once more happy.</p> 
               <p>Ah, Jessie! we little knew, as we sat talking in that quiet parsonage, what our own life experience would be-but it was well that we did not. What a wise provision of Providence it is which throws a veil over the future and shuts it from our sight!</p> 
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5689-00000012"/> 
               <p>Time passed quickly, and the day arrived when we expected the return of the absent ones. All day we had been busy in making the parsonage look as cheerful and home-like as possible, and now the tea-table stood in the pretty back parlor, laden with the choicest delicacies of the season; and the kind neighbors who had been assisting us in our endeavors, withdrew-leaving Mrs. Gordon, Jessie and myself to welcome back the loved ones. At length a carriage drew up before the door, and in a moment more Lily was in the arms of her mother, while Claude returned our greeting in a less demonstrative but not less cordial manner.</p> 
               <p>We were a merry party as we sat around the table that evening, and as the laugh and jest went 'round, perfect satisfaction shone upon every face. After supper, we adjourned to the parlor, and as Lily's piano-a splendid toned instrument-had been removed to the parsonage during her absence, we enjoyed a rich musical treat in listening to her clear, young voice, warbling some pleasing ballad, or singing some grand old anthem, in which Claude's rich tenor joined. Afterwards, I took the vacant seat and sang several pieces-some quaint old Scottish songs, and then, by special request, some in the liquid Italian tongue-to all of which Claude listened with wrapt attention; and, when I had finished, thanked me eagerly, with glistening eyes, complimenting my voice and execution, and telling me I had indeed given him a rare treat.</p> 
               <p>That was my last night at the parsonage. The next morning I bade adieu to my kind friends and started for Graham Lodge. Claude accompanied me to the station, and after doing everything in his power to make me comfortable, bade me a kind good-bye, and left me. A few moments after, and just as the cars were starting, I<pb n=""/> glanced out of the window and saw him standing upon the platform, with a shade of melancholy resting upon his brow. I waved my handkerchief-a bright, eager smile quickly dispelled the cloud, as he bowed gracefully, and in another moment he was out of sight. With an unconscious sigh I turned from the window, and taking up a book which I had brought with me, was soon so absorbed in its contents that I did not notice that I was nearing home until, with a shrill whistle, the train thundered into the little station at Grahamville.</p>

               <p>Graham Lodge seemed gloomier than ever, after my return. The weather, which had heretofore been as mild as summer, suddenly changed, and a dull, miserable rain set in, which lasted for several days, making everything look dreary and desolate. For a few days after my return, I felt homesick and desolate, for I missed the congenial society at the parsonage; but at last I aroused myself from the listless state into which I had fallen, and determined to make the best of my present situation. I determined to commence immediately a course of reading, thinking that would be a pleasant and instructive manner of passing the time. I found all the books which I wanted, in the library-a large room filled with rich old-fashioned furniture. A capacious library covered one side of the room, filled with a choice selection of books by the best authors, and which proved to me a perfect mine of treasure. In this room I now spent most of my time, reading in the quaint old volumes or writing in my journal-which I kept regularly, though I had but few incidents to furnish me with something to write about-while the faces of my ancestors looked down upon me from the<pb n=""/> opposite wall. There was the portrait of my mother, a fair blue eyed lady, with her rosy mouth just dimpling into a smile, and those of my grand-parents, in powdered hair and ancient costume, looking like some lord and lady of the olden time. The picture which interested me most, however, was that of Aunt Agnes, taken when she was about my own age, but which bore little resemblance to the Aunt Agnes of the present time. It was wondrously beautiful. The attitude was one of careless grace, which well became the proud, queenly form. The face, even then, was a haughty one, and in the proud curve of the beautiful mouth was revealed somewhat of the pride of the haughty Grahams. But the chief glory of the face was the beautiful Oriental eyes, just shaded by the long silken lashes-those dark brooding eyes, in the dusky depths of which there was such a world of passionate tenderness, and which made the proud, face glorious in its matchless beauty. Often, when tired of reading, I would sit and gaze upon the face before me, and wonder what had transformed that splendid woman into the cold, statue-like being who now bore her name, and I made up my mind that there was some strange mystery connected with her fate, which as yet I could not explain. Although I lived so near Aunt Agnes, yet I saw but little of her. She kept her room most of the time, seldom joining us, even at meals; and that some secret sorrow was wearing out her life, I felt certain, for often in the stillness of the night, I would be awakened from slumber by the sound of her restless footsteps, pacing hurriedly to and fro in her apartment, which adjoined mine, and I would long to go to her and comfort her; but I knew too well she would not let me.</p> 
               <p>I was sitting alone in the library one day, with my eyes fastened upon the portrait and my thoughts busy with the<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5689-00000014"/> mystery which enveloped her life, and as usual, filling my mind with vain conjectures as to the cause of her present seclusion from the world. It was Winter now. The snow was piled high upon the terraces and along the garden walks, and the winter winds shrieked and moaned dismally through the leafless branches of the trees, like the wail of a human voice in agony. But I did not heed the storm without, as I sat contemplating the portrait, for I now noticed what had before escaped my observation, that there was a vacant niche in the wall in which there had probably once hung a portrait. Could it have been that of any member of the family, which was removed from its appropriate niche? No. There were the faces of each of my relatives, smiling down upon me in my perplexity. What could it mean? I would ask Mrs. Miller to inform me, for I felt that she could tell me everything that I wished to know, if she was so disposed, for, from careful observation, I had discovered that she was in the confidence of my Aunt, and was probably acquainted with all the family secrets. As if in answer to my wish, the door opened, and the housekeeper entered with the day's mail. She saw me regarding the portrait, and remarked upon the great resemblance which I bore to that of Aunt Agnes, saying that a stranger would certainly take it for my own. I eagerly seized the opportunity thus presented, and inquired, in as careless a manner as I could assume, if there had not formerly been another portrait in the library. She looked at me curiously and eagerly a moment, and then gave an evasive reply, which only served to confirm my previous conjectures about the mystery, and also showed me that I could learn nothing from the housekeeper in regard to it.</p> 
               <p>We chatted a few minutes upon indifferent subjects, till we came to speak of the collection of books in the library, when<pb n=""/> Mrs. Miller remarked that I seemed to have taken a strange fancy to the room. I replied that it did certainly possess great attractions for me, and I wondered that Aunt Agnes, with her refined and cultivated taste, did not prefer it to every other room in the house. Again the housekeeper's eager, questioning glance sought my face, and again she gave some trivial reply, which was far from satisfying me as the true one, and, in a few minutes after, withdrew. Her manner had only confirmed what I had before surmised; and, determined to know more of the mystery, I turned to the table where lay the letters Mrs. Miller had deposited, and selecting one in Jessie's familiar hand-writing, sat down to read it. It was a kind, sisterly letter, full of little agreeable nothings, and describing her little school in the village-composed of poor children, whom she taught gratuitously-and the other and various objects of her charity among the poor of the parish. She was very busy this Winter-she wrote-trying to relieve Claude of the burden of care resting upon him, and had not much time for vain regrets, but still she often thought of me, and wished that I could be with them those long, winter evenings, where my presence alone was needed to make their happiness complete.</p> 
               <p>It was sweet to be thus remembered, and only those who have felt so isolated and <emph>alone</emph> as I did at that time-only those, can know how I echoed the kindly wish. But it was all in vain; and I sighed as I closed the letter, and thought of the pleasant family circle gathered around the fire during the long evenings, and contrasted it with the many desolate hours I often spent at Graham Lodge. The Winter dragged slowly by in this manner-each day being counterpart of the other-until I grew weary of the dull routine, and longed for Spring to come, when I could get out<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5689-00000015"/> into the glad sunshine again. At length March came, with its blustering winds and rainy weather, but stern old Winter seemed loth to resign his reign, and the snow still covered the earth with its white mantle; but, after a time, the sun appeared, and before his cheering rays the snow rapidly melted from the earth. I was delighted with the mild weather, and Mrs. Miller and I had planned to go to the village the first pleasant day to procure a servant, the first time the weather appeared favorable to our wishes. I had grown so weary of my monotonous life that I eagerly welcomed any excitement, and had been looking forward to the ride with almost childish? impatience. Mrs. Miller was almost as much pleased as myself at the simple amusement, and we decided to go immediately after dinner. But, alas for our prospects! When the dinner-hour arrived, the rain was pouring down steadily, and of course we had no other alternative than to remain at home. This to me was a sore disappointment, especially as the rain gave promise of continuing for some time.</p> 
               <p>That night, when I retired, it was still raining, and the last sound that I heard before my ideas were lost in slumber, was the pattering of the rain-drops against the casement. It must have been near midnight, when I was awakened by a strange sound in an uninhabited part of the house. Raising myself upon my elbow, I listened eagerly to what seemed to be the sound of a woman's voice, sobbing and weeping bitterly, as though in great distress of mind. The room which I occupied was in the main part of the building, and adjoining Aunt Agnes', while beyond were those of the housekeeper and other dependents. The voice which I now heard proceeded from none of these rooms, nor, indeed, from that part of the house. Across the wide hall, and in what<pb n=""/> was familiarly known as the "east wing," were several uninhabited rooms, from one of which the voice evidently proceeded. I had frequently heard similar sounds before, coming from that direction, but never so plainly as now, and I had supposed that it was my imagination, or the wind sighing through the deserted rooms; but now I distinctly heard broken exclamations, uttered in a voice which I did not recognize. I had never been in the east wing, but had always supposed the guest chambers to be in that part of the house, and considered that a sufficient reason for their not being used. While I listened, the sounds continued, and rising and hastily throwing on a wrapper, I stole softly to the door of my room and opened it. The great hall was dark and silent, and there was not a living being in it that I could discover. There must have been some door leading out of it ajar, and which, in my hasty survey, I had not noticed; for, while I stood peering into the darkness, a sudden rush of air-so damp that it might have come from the tomb-extinguished the lamp which I held in my hand, and left me shivering as with an ague fit. With an undefined feeling of awe and dread stealing over me, I closed the door and endeavored to re-light the lamp, but my hand trembled so violently that it was some minutes before I was successful. After I was once more in bed, I could hear that singular voice, sounding like the wail of some lost spirit-now rising into fitful sobbings, and anon sinking into low, mournful cadences; and I went to sleep with the voice still ringing in my ear. When daylight came, however, I was ready to laugh at the absurd fancies which had filled my mind during the preceding night, yet I could not account for the mysterious voice, and determined to watch and wait, feeling sure that all would yet be satisfactorily explained. But during the day I heard<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5689-00000016"/> that which caused me to think the adventure more singular than ever. It was after dinner, and I stood looking out of the long window in the dining-room, wondering if the rain would ever cease, when the voices of the servants, in earnest discussion, came floating in from the kitchen, and I could easily hear their conversation. I took no notice of it at first, but after a few moments I became an interested and eager listener. The voice of the cook, a broad-shouldered Irish girl, first attracted my attention.</p> 
               <p>"Faith," she was saying, "it's meself as knows whin I hears a thing, an' may I niver agin recave absolution ef I didn't hear a cryin' an' a groanin' the live long night. I've heard it before, an' Mis Miller kin say what she plazes, but I'd belave the ividence ov me own sinses before even the praste himself. The house is haunted, an' if it wan't for me poor owld mother starvin' in Ireland, I'd pack up me duds an' be off wid meself this very day, for it's not meself as likes to stay in a place that's haunted, at all, at all."</p> 
               <p>Here the voice of the head gardener was raised in earnest expostulation. Old Timothy had been long in the service of the family, and his words generally carried great weight with the rest of the servants. With an earnest, authoritative voice, he exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Out upon ye now, Bridget! for a simple girl as ye are; enny won wud know, to hear ye, ye was but a few years over. Aint it meself as has lived in the family when Miss Agnes was a grand young leddy, like Miss Laura-bless her purty face!-an' niver the sign ov a ghost hav I seen; an' now be quiet, an' don't let me hear ye talkin' enny more about ghosts, for ye left 'em all in owld Ireland, and indade there's none in the house."</p> 
               <p>Upon any other subject Timothy would leave been listened<pb n=""/> to with respect, but now Bridget vehemently declared that she would believe the evidence of her own senses before the word of any man. Nor could I blame her, for although myself not a believer in spiritual manifestations, yet I, too, had felt a superstitious awe steal over me as I listened to that wailing voice. But, as time wore on and I did not hear anything more of it, the whole affair passed from my mind.</p> 
               <p>After continuing for three days the rain suddenly ceased, but the roads had become impassable from the effects of the flood, so that it was nearly a week before Mrs. Miller could fulfill her promise of going to the village. At length everything seemed favorable, and we started off, feeling like escaped prisoners, so keen was our sense of enjoyment of the pure air and pleasant sunshine. We drove into the village, attracting considerable attention from the inhabitants, and stopped before the door of a small cottage, in which resided a poor widow and her daughter-the girl whom Mrs. Miller wished to engage as a servant. We found the girl at home, and soon made known our errand. She was delighted with the idea of living at Graham Lodge, which she evidently regarded as a very fine place, and she was soon ready to return with us.</p> 
               <p>On our way home we stopped at several stores, in one of which the proprietor, who seemed to be an old acquaintance of Mrs. Miller's, remarked to her, in an undertone, upon what he seemed to consider the remarkable resemblance between Aunt Agnes, when she was near my age, and myself, saying, "he could almost believe that she stood before him." At the Post Office there was a crowd of gaping loungers, who stared at us imprudently as we drew up, and remarked upon us with more freedom than politeness. The ride home was delightful, and I enjoyed it hugely, forgetting<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5689-00000017"/> all the dismal fancies of the last few months, and almost fancying, I was a merry school-girl again.</p> 
               <p>The weather grew milder, and when April came with its smiles and tears I felt that Winter had indeed passed away, and that, Summer, in her regal robes of emerald velvet, would ere long, be with us. As the weeks flew by, my curiosity about the portrait still remained unsatisfied-a state of things I found very likely to continue, if sole happy accident did not reveal it to me. As there had been no recurrence of the ghostly sounds, which had before disturbed my slumbers, the incident had almost entirely passed from my mind.</p> 
               <p>One night, being ore than usually fatigued, I retired at an early hour, and was soon in a sound refreshing slumber. I must have slept for some hours, for it was far into the night when I was suddenly awakened by some one throwing themselves violently upon the bed by my side, while I was seized by the shoulders and shaken violently, a voice exclaiming, "Oh! for the blissid vargin's sake, wake up! for it's frightened to death that I am with the doin's in this same house. Wake up, Miss Laura, there's a darlint, an' pray to the blissid vargin to deliver ye out of the power of the evil speerits as is stalkin' around this house, an' scarin' honest folks out of their sivin senses!"</p> 
               <p>As soon as I could collect my ideas, I discovered that the intruder was none other than Catharine, the new servant girl, from whose incoherent ravings I gathered that she believed she had seen a ghost and was very much frightened. I could not repress a smile, as she went down on her knees before a little crucifix which she took from her pocket, while she commenced to pray vigorously to all the saints in the calendar to deliver her out of the power of the "evil<pb n=""/> speerits," as she termed them, who were after her. I tried to reason with the poor girl, telling her there was no such thing as ghosts, but it was some time before I could soothe her, for she was thoroughly frightened, and persisted in declaring she had met a being in the hall, dressed in white, with long hair falling about her shoulders, and great eyes which looked her straight through. After a good deal of persuasion she promised that if I would accompany her she would return to her room, and accordingly I took a small lamp in my hand and preceded her into the hall. We had nearly reached the centre of the hall, when one of the doors, opening from the east wing, swung slowly upon its hinges with a creaking sound, and a tall figure, clothed in white, as Catharine had described, appeared upon the threshold. For an instant I stood spell-bound, and for the first time in my life felt my doubts, in regard to the supernatural, shaken. I could not see the face, for the long hair had fallen over it, concealing it from view; but a sickening feeling of horror stole over me as I gazed upon the apparition. Just then, Catharine, who had remained in blissful ignorance of the close proximity to the object of her terror, uttered a shriek of horror, and with a muttered prayer to the virgin, seized me in her stout arms, and darting back into the room we had left, shut the door and carefully secured it. The shriek of the terrified girl had aroused the rest of the household, and when I was once more at liberty, Mrs. Miller, with a troop of frightened servants at her heels, was inquiring the cause of the uproar. In as few words as possible I explained the cause of the disturbance, at which Mrs. Miller affected to laugh, but there was that in her manner which convinced me that such scenes were nothing new to her at least. The servants crossed themselves rapidly while Bridget stoutly<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5689-00000018"/> asserted her belief in the story of the apparition, relating what she had seen and heard on former occasions, and the rest of the servants each had something to say about the mysterious sounds they had so often heard in the dead of night. At length Mrs. Miller put an end to their loud conversation, by remarking, "that Aunt Agnes might be disturbed;" but I thought that if she had failed to be aroused by the confusion of the last few minutes, nothing we could say could possibly have that effect. It certainly did seem very mysterious that Aunt Agnes neither came herself nor sent to inquire the cause of the strange disturbance. Catharine, the servant girl, was lifted from the room, where she had fallen in a fainting fit, and carried to the housekeeper's room, where for a long time all efforts to restore her to consciousness were in vain; and when at length animation was restored, she was unable to answer the questions put to her. She was extremely superstitious, and the events of the night had made her really ill, so that she was unable to rise from her bed for several days. The housekeeper spent most of her time in the girl's room, nursing her carefully, and endeavoring to drive from her mind all remembrance of her nocturnal adventure, but without success, for she persisted in talking of it, and saying that as soon as she was able she would leave the house, for all the money in the world could not tempt her to remain in a house inhabited by spirits from an unseen world. And she was true to her word. A few mornings after I heard her bidding good-bye to Bridget in the passage below.</p> 
               <p>"So ye're goin', Catharine," said Bridget, in a low tone. "I think ye're kind ov foolish for lavin', after all, for it's not very often ye'll find the likes ov this place-asy times an' big wages, an' niver a cross word spoken from won day's ind to<pb n=""/> another. Faith it aint for poor girls like us to say how things suit, an' I'm afraid ye'll soon be after repintin' the day ye left."</p> 
               <p>"Niver a bit, then," replied Catharine; "sorra the day whin I iver came into the house at all, at all; an' indade I'll be after thinkin' meself lucky if I git out of it safe, so I will."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't know but yer right, Catharine," said Bridget, "but if I was to lave, where wud I be goin', with niver a frind in all Ameriky to keer for me; an' if I kape a little holy wather in my room, an' sprinkle it over the threshold of the door whin I go to bed at night, an' say my prayer like a good Catholic, an' an extra one for protection, I guess the speerits won't be after coming' nigh me. Mis Miller has raised me wages, an' I can't afford to lave a good plase like this, for ye see (and here her voice took a sharper tone,) with money ye can do a good dale in this wurld."</p> 
               <p>I could but think, as I listened to the speech of this ignorant Irish girl, vacillating between her superstitious fears and avarice, that the love of which we are told is the "root of all evil," had often proved successful in quieting the fears of wiser people than Bridget. Alas! for poor human nature that it is so.</p> 
               <p>That afternoon I paid a visit to Mrs. Miller's room, and our conversation turning upon the late singular occurrences, I related what I had myself heard and seen, adding that had it not been for the frightened Catharine I should have followed the mysterious figure, to discover, if possible, whom it could be; but that when I succeeded in releasing myself from her energetic grasp, and opening the door, the apparition had vanished. The housekeeper looked troubled, and, as I<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5689-00000019"/> finished speaking, seemed upon the point of making some strange revelation, but when she at last spoke it was in a far different manner from that which I had anticipated: "Perhaps it was one of the servants who thought to frighten the new girl in this manner." She had "often heard of such things among servants, especially the Irish, who were a very superstitious people." This seemed the most natural explanation of the affair, and thus I accepted it, though when I found myself alone in the hall, after dark, I would think of the "woman in white," and unconsciously quicken my steps towards my own room.</p>

               <p>One pleasant April morning I arose somewhat later than usual, and, after a hasty toilet, descended to the breakfast room, expecting to see Mrs. Miller already there and awaiting my appearance. But to my surprise, the housekeeper, who was the personification of punctuality, was not there, and the servant in attendance informed me that I need not expect her at breakfast. So I sat down to my solitary meal, thinking the housekeeper had some good reason for her non-appearance. But as the morning wore slowly away and I saw nothing of her, I thought she might be ill, and resolved to go to her room to inquire. My rap at the door was answered by a low "come in," and to my astonishment, I saw Mrs. Miller seated before the window with her face bathed in tears. This was something unusual, for she was generally serene and even cheerful. Since I had resided at Graham Lodge I had learned to love the gentle lady, for Mrs. Miller was a lady despite her humble situation in life, and now when I saw her in trouble, I went forward, impulsively, and throwing my arms around her, entreated her to tell me the cause of her grief. Her tears flowed freely as she returned my caresses, and she was too much affected to reply in words. Drawing a low cushioned seat beside her,<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5689-00000020"/> I sat down and waited for her to recover herself. This she did in a few moments, and was soon calm and serene as ever. Passing her hand caressingly over my curls, she said:</p> 
               <p>"I am grateful, Miss Laura, for the sympathy you have shown me, but it is nothing more than I expected from one of your generous nature. Where others would have appeared haughty and overbearing, you have been kind and considerate to those beneath you in station, and, insensibly, you have crept into my heart until I love you as a daughter. You are not happy in this lonely house, with no young companions, and there is no love in your heart for the one whom you should have found a mother. But do not blame Agnes Graham for steeling her heart, even against the orphan-she has seen a great deal of trouble, and has learned to distrust mankind. Pity her, but do not blame her. Once she was, like you, young and beautiful-the life of every company and the belle of the village-the 'bright particular star,' whom all admired for her brilliancy and beauty. But I did not intend to speak of her when I commenced, for the secrets of another are sacred things which we ought never to reveal; but I so want you to love her, for I am sure you would pity her if you knew her life history."</p> 
               <p>"And why may I not know it, Mrs. Miller?" I asked, impetuously. "What has blighted the life of Aunt Agnes, and left the fair promises of her girlhood unfulfilled? Why should I not become acquainted with her past life; for, as she is my only relative, it must concern me?"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps, in time, you will know all; but not now, nor by me. That would be wrong, and perhaps it is better as it is; but, if you would like to hear the story of my not uneventful life, I should be pleased to gratify you."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>I answered, eagerly, that nothing would suit me better; but, before she commenced, I wished to say that she would oblige me by hereafter addressing me simply as Laura; for I wished no distinctions-no barrier raised to separate from me my best of friends. With another caress, and a few low-spoken, grateful words, Mrs. Miller related the following:</p> 
               <p>"My childhood days were passed among the green hills of New England. My parents were poor, but we were very happy in our pretty cottage-home, for my father managed, with rigid economy, to obtain sufficient for our frugal wants from the rocky soil of which our farm was composed. My mother was the only child of a wealthy merchant-a proud, arrogant man, who, when his daughter married in opposition to his wishes, disinherited her; and the wealth, which should have flowed in upon Marcia Raymond, went to enrich her already wealthy relatives, after her marriage with Hugh Miller. But, as the wife of the man she loved, Marcia Raymond was happy, and had not one regret for the former splendor which was now lost to her forever. I was their only child, and on me they lavished the wealth of their affections-the love of their fond hearts. My mother, who possessed an excellent education, instructed me at home, so that, when I grew older, I ranked far above the rest of the village maidens in intellectual attainments. One day, on returning from a walk, I found my mother in the little parlor, deeply absorbed, to my great surprise, in the contents of a letter. Now, this was so unusual an occurrence-for neither of my parents could boast of a single correspondent-that I stood lost in astonishment at finding her thus occupied, and waited impatiently, it must be confessed, to have my curiosity in regard to it satisfied. It proved to be from<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5689-00000021"/> an early friend of my mother's, who, he wrote, was desirous of escaping from the hollowness and deceit of fashionable life, and seek some quiet place where he would be free to follow the bent of his own inclinations, without being restricted by the fetters of 'society.' He wished to know if he could obtain board at our house during the Summer. That evening, my parents held a long consultation together, and the result was, that a letter was despatched to Middleton Leonard, telling him to come to us; and mother proceeded to arrange things so as to add as much as possible to the comfort of our expected guest. He came. We had been expecting him all day, and everything was in readiness for his reception. My mother looked what she was, the lady, in her simple lawn dress and tasteful collar, and I felt a glow of pride as I regarded her. I was just placing a freshly-gathered bouquet in one of the vases upon the mantel, when there was a low rap at the door, and I knew that our guest had arrived. My mother welcomed him cordially, and then presented him to me, and I felt the fond pride in her tones as she said 'my daughter.' My first impression of Middleton Leonard was an agreeable one. He must have passed the meridian of life, yet he was so dignified and stately, and yet so courteous and affable, that it quite made up for the lack of youth. Altogether, I quite fancied him, and we soon grew to be the best of friends. He was splendidly educated, and had traveled in foreign lands, and had that polish of manner only to be acquired by constant intercourse with the world. Then he had rare conversational powers, and would keep me an entranced listener, for hours together, to the rich gems of thought, which seemed to flow without an effort from his lips. Those halcyon summer days flew quickly-so quickly that I never dreamed the end was so near, until the<pb n=""/> time for the departure of Middleton Leonard drew near-the time to which (seek to hide it as I would) I looked forward with fear and trembling.</p> 
               <p>We had been out in the grand old woods, one pleasant day in August, and, becoming tired, sat down upon the trunk of a fallen tree to rest, before starting to return. The very spirit of silence seemed to possess my companion, for he sat for some time without speaking, watching my fingers, as I arranged the flowers we had gathered into a wreath to adorn his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chapeau</foreign>. When it was finished, I arose to go, saying that my mother would be alarmed at my absence. My companion, aroused by my words, took my hand in his, and, drawing me again to a seat by his side, said, earnestly, while his voice trembled with the emotion he could not conceal, 'Amy, darling, I must soon leave this place, perhaps forever; but I cannot go without revealing to you what is in my heart. During the past few months I have learned to love you as I never expected to love again, and I want to know if you will bestow upon me the sunlight of your dear presence to cheer me in my desolate home. I know that I am older than you, Amy, but I love you with a deep, abiding love. Amy, dearest, will you be my wife?' The thought of the proud and stately Middleton Leonard loving me, a little, simple country girl, seemed too good to be true; for, at that moment, I realized the void there would have been left in my heart when he was gone from me. So I told him, shyly, that I would go anywhere to be with him, and felt so happy when he folded me in his arms and called me his bride-his dear, beautiful Amy! After we had become more composed, he told me of the home where I should reign a very queen, till my foolish heart throbbed with delight, and I wondered how such good fortune could ever have happened to poor little me. Then I asked him<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5689-00000022"/> why he, who was so well calculated to win the love of woman, had never before married; and there, in the deepening twilight, he sat and told me the story of his first love.</p> 
               <p>"Several years before, while visiting a friend, he had met and loved a young lady, who was also visiting at the mansion. Lilian St. Erme was but seventeen years of age, yet she had all the tact and generalship of a practiced flirt. To her, beauty was a fatal gift; for she possessed extraordinary personal attractions, and used the power which it gave her over the hearts of others. She was a blonde, with a lithe, slender form, graceful and willowy. Her face was one of incomparable beauty. Eyes of liquid azure looked out from a broad, low brow, white as polished marble. The sweet mouth, around which hovered a continual smile, looked like a half-opened rosebud. A mass of golded hair floated in silken curls around her small, well-shaped head and graceful form, nestling lovingly upon the dimpled shoulder, or dancing about the beautiful face like a silken veil. Her very movements were full of the 'poetry of motion;' her manners combined the artlessness of a child with the dignity of a woman. To be brief, Middleton Leonard fell madly in love with this bewitching creature, and lived only in the sunshine of her presence; but, when he avowed his love, she rejected him. This coquette-this accomplished flirt at seventeen-spurned him from her; and, after having lured him on to a proposal, the syren laughed at the pain she had caused, saying, hearts were not so easily broken, for, if they were, she must have died long ago.</p> 
               <p>"From that time, Middleton Leonard distrusted the whole sex, and was fast becoming a misanthrope, when chance, or rather Providence, led him to our quiet<pb n=""/> country home, and then he told me, with an added tenderness in his voice, he had learned to think differently. The evening dews were falling as we walked homeward together, and my mother was watching anxiously for our approach. I was turning to go up stairs when my companion detained me, and leading me to my mother, asked, 'Can mamma consent that her little blossom be claimed by another, and transplanted from her native soil to bloom in a more congenial clime?' And with fast falling tears my mother replied, 'Take her, Middleton, and cherish her in your heart as one of heaven's choicest gifts, and never let blight or mildew fall upon and wither the freshness of her young heart's affections, and then my little blossom will yield nothing but fragrance.' So I became his wife, and went with him to his beautiful home, where I was surrounded by everything that wealth could procure, or an <choice>
                     <sic>ingenius</sic>
                     <corr>ingenious</corr>
                  </choice> taste devise, and for a time I was happy. As the wife of the wealthy Middleton Leonard, my society was much sought after, and I was soon surrounded by a large circle of acquaintances. My mother's former friends, who had slighted her when she became plain Mrs. Miller, now came thronging around me with many protestations of love and affection. Among them all there was but one whom I cared to recognize, and that was my cousin Frank Vivian. He was handsome, witty, and agreeable, though something of a dandy; but he was good-natured and amiable, and I liked him. He soon became a frequent visitor at our home, dropping in at all hours of the day, and always sure of a cordial welcome from both my husband and myself. Mr. Leonard was a merchant and spent much of his time in his counting-room; but Frank, who really seemed to have nothing to do but amuse himself and others, was always at liberty to go where inclination led him, and so it happened<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5689-00000023"/> that he spent much of his time with me; often, when my husband did not feel disposed, escorting me to parties, concerts and other places of amusement. There was another frequent visitor at our house-Rupert Southbank, the partner of my husband-and I always bade him welcome, yet, for some reason which I could not explain to my own mind, I disliked him. He was a tall, dark, stern looking man, but eminently handsome, and my husband considered him as honorable and trustworthy, yet to me there was something sinister in the expression of the bold black eyes, and instinctively I shrank from him as a thing of evil. And truly Rupert Southbank became my evil genius.</p> 
               <p>"A year of unalloyed happiness went by, and then two beautiful children came to fill my heart with a new and blissful feeling-maternal love. My husband became, if possible, more tender of me than ever, and my cup of happiness seemed full, for my little twin babies grew and flourished under my fond care, till I thought, with the pride of a mother, that there never were two more beautiful children than my little Clarence and Florence. I mingled less in society now, for my love for my children kept me ever by their side, but I felt far happier than when in the crowded drawing-room, receiving the adulation of a brilliant throng. Frank Vivian came often to see me, and he learned to love my beautiful babies as fondly as even I could desire. One day, when I was in the library, playing upon the small cabinet piano which stood in one corner, and trying to amuse the children with my songs, the door opened and Frank entered. There was a dark frown upon his handsome face, and he sat down with such a dejected air that I could not but notice his changed manner and inquire<pb n=""/> the cause. The children, too, missed their accustomed frolic, and tried with their pretty infantile ways to attract his attention, but in vain, for he at last exclaimed, impatiently:</p> 
               <p>"'Do, Cousin Amy, send those children to the nursery! I would like to talk with you, if you would allow me.'</p> 
               <p>"Though astonished and somewhat hurt, for I had never seen Frank so impatient and unreasonable before, I complied with his request, and seated myself in a listening attitude to hear what he had to say. He was in trouble, poor fellow, and I pitied him. Amy Lee, my pretty neighbor, to whom Frank was engaged, had given him the heart-ache by flirting desperately with a magnificently bewhiskered foreigner, and, when Frank, half devoured with jealousy, had accused her of coquetry, a quarrel ensued, and they parted, with angry feelings upon both sides. To conclude, Frank declared himself the most miserable fellow in existence! I consoled him to the best of my ability-telling him lovers' quarrels never lasted long, and that though Amy was a little given to flirting, she possessed a warm, loving heart, and would soon repent of her folly. But Frank seemed so unhappy that I resolved to bring matters to a climax; so I invented a little scheme which I thought would bring it all out right. Telling Frank to happen in sometime during the afternoon, I dismissed him, and, going to my room, wrote a little note to Amy Lee, asking her to come and stay with the children, while I spent the afternoon with a friend, as I did not like to leave the darlings in the care of a servant. In a few minutes, an affirmative answer was returned, and, with a light heart, I made my preparations to pay a long promised visit. Punctual to her appointment, Amy came, and I thought I had never seen her look prettier, as she came<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5689-00000024"/> bounding into the room, her eyes sparkling and cheek glowing with life and animation. I embraced the favorable opportunity thus presented, to say a few words upon the folly and sin of flirting, and spoke touchingly of Frank-dwelling long upon his melancholy appearance-until, when I left her, Amy was as penitent as I could have desired.</p> 
               <p>"I spent the afternoon agreeably in the society of my friend, and the stars that 'glitter and glow in their sweet unrest' were shining down upon me as I retraced my steps homeward. Frank and Amy were still in the drawing-room when I entered, and it needed but one glance at Amy's happy blushing face, to learn the result of my maneuver. After they had gone, I sat some time awaiting my husband's appearance, who, the servant informed me, had not yet returned. After having waited for some time in vain, I went to my room, and being more than usually fatigued, did not, as was my custom, visit the nursery before retiring. The next morning, however, I arose and went directly to the nursery. Florence was there, and still sleeping sweetly, but my little Clarence was missing. I was surprised at this, for the children were always together; but thinking the nurse, who was also absent, had taken him into the garden, I descended the stairs in quest of them. The first person I encountered below, was Rupert Southbank, who had 'called,' he said, 'to see Mr. Leonard upon important business.' I replied 'that I had not seen my husband,' having retired before his return the evening previous, but had supposed him to have arisen early, as was his custom, and gone to the store. I was astonished and alarmed, when Southbank informed me 'that Mr. Leonard had not been seen at the store that morning, and wondering at his non-appearance, and<pb n=""/> having important business which required his immediate attention, he had concluded to come to the house in search of him.' While we were speaking, the door-bell rang, and a moment after a servant entered and handed me a letter. It was in my husband's familiar handwriting, and I broke the seal with trembling eagerness. I read the cruel letter which told me that Middleton Leonard had deserted me, and taken with him my boy, my beautiful Clarence, and then I fell fainting to the floor. It was weeks before I was able to realize the misery of my situation-a deserted wife! The thought nearly deprived me of reason. The blow fell with crushing weight upon me. To feel that I was declared guilty, without the means of proving my innocence, seemed hard to bear. I could not imagine of what I was suspected, for I could remember nothing in my past conduct that would lead any one to suppose me capable of an unladylike action. My husband's letter was unsatisfactory, merely avowing his belief in my guilt, but mentioning no names, saying I would know best to whom he alluded, adding that he had left me forever, and taken with him his son in whom he recognized his own features. He besought me to return to the path of virtue and bring up our little Florence, whom he had left to me, knowing that I would feel miserable enough as it was, in the paths of virtue and peace. He concluded by bidding me a last farewell, saying that we should never meet again until that great day when the quick and dead are summoned to the judgment seat of God.</p> 
               <p>"During the long, wretched days that followed, Rupert Southbank was my only visitor, and though I had not entirely conquered the feelings of distrust which I still felt for him, yet his kindness won upon me, until at last I grew to regard him as a friend. The news of<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5689-00000025"/> my husband's desertion had become known, and of the many who once professed the warmest friendship for me, Frank Vivian, with his bride elect, and Rupert Southbank were now my only friends, But Frank and Amy were busy with preparations for their wedding and subsequent European tour, and I necessarily saw but little of them, consequently I passed many lonely hours, as I scarcely ever went out, for I dreaded the haughty glances and cutting remarks I was sure to meet.</p> 
               <p>"I was sitting alone in the library, some six months later, thinking of the future, and wondering what it had in store for me. I could not, I was convinced, remain where everything so forcibly reminded me of my former happiness; but what should I do if I went away? The disgrace cast upon my name would follow me wherever I went, and I would be no happier in any other position. My parents had died since my marriage, and there was now no one to bid the deserted wife welcome to their home. While I was thus occupied, Rupert Southbank entered. He had been so friendly and attentive to me in my trouble, that I was now rejoiced to see him. I told him what was in my mind, and that I could remain no longer where I felt so unhappy. While I was speaking, his face wore an expression I had never seen there before, and after I had finished he said abruptly: 'Why need you leave it, Amy? I love you,' and he attempted to take my hand, 'love you better than life. Come to my protecting arms, where you will be safe from further persecution. Your husband has basely deserted you, and you no longer owe him any allegiance. Come to me then, darling, and once more be happy.' Words cannot express the loathing I felt for this man who had called himself my friend, as the full meaning of his words dawned upon<pb n=""/> my mind, and with words of stinging sarcasm and bitter contempt, I spurned him from me. But what a change had come over Rupert Southbank as I spoke. The evil eyes sparkled and glowed, and the whole face was distorted with malignant passion, as these words came hissing from between his shut teeth:</p> 
               <p>"'You have chosen, Amy Leonard. You have spurned with contempt the love and protection I offered you, and now <emph>beware</emph>. Know that Rupert Southbank never forgives those who humble him. All the deep love which I once felt for you is, by your own rash words, turned into the direst hate, and in proportion as I loved you before, do I hate you now. You shall yet be mine, body and soul, for I am not a man to be foiled in my purposes. I must leave you now, but before I go, a word for your ear. Behold in me the author of all your misery. Yes, I was the one who wrecked your domestic peace and happiness. I was the author of those anonymous letters, which declared to the astonished and indignant Middleton Leonard your intimacy with Frank Vivian. Aye, writhe in agony! This is sweet revenge! Your husband is naturally jealous, and, if you were successful in finding him, would not believe in your innocence without proof, and that is impossible. Frank Vivian and his pretty bride are now in Europe, and he alone could aid you. And now adieu. You will hear from me when you least expect it-when possibly you may be prevailed upon to retract the scornful words you have spoken,' and with a bow of mocking politeness, he withdrew.</p> 
               <p>"For hours after he left me, I sat like one bereft of sense, stupefied by my great grief; but at length tears came to my relief, and sinking down upon my knees, I<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5689-00000026"/> prayed to my Heavenly Father as only the friendless and forlorn can pray, to deliver me out of the power of this evil man, and if it was his will, restore me to my husband. I was a christian, Laura, and when others proved faithless and recreant to the trust reposed in them, I had learned there was one Friend who never fails us; who, while Himself upon earth, was indeed a 'Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.' After this, I felt somewhat better, and I was not long in deciding upon what course of action was best to pursue. My only safety lay in flight. I knew the iron will of the man I had to deal with, and I felt sure he would fulfill his threat, though actuated only by a longing for revenge. Once out of his reach, and I had nothing to fear. I did not hope for happiness again on earth. I only sought submission to His will, knowing that 'all things work together for good to them that love the Lord.'</p> 
               <p>"That night I collected all my jewelry and what ready money I had in my possession, and taking my little Florence, stole out into the friendly darkness, and was soon on my way from the city. I changed my name back to Miller, and came to Grahamville, where I was unknown, to seek rest, and if possible, forgetfulness. I took board in the house of a widow, and passed my time in the strictest seclusion.</p> 
               <p>"At length I heard, accidentally; from my hostess, that a housekeeper was wanted at Graham Lodge, and I at once decided to apply for the situation, knowing that in plain Mrs. Miller, the housekeeper at the Lodge, no one would recognize the once beautiful and admired Mrs. Middleton Leonard. My application for the position of housekeeper was not rejected, but seemed to have been accepted the<pb n=""/> more readily on account of my being a stranger in Grahamville, and so I came with my daughter to reside at the Lodge. Many years have elapsed since I became an inmate of the dwelling, and I now hope to spend the remainder of my life in this loved home.</p> 
               <p>"A few weeks after I had taken up my abode here, my little Florence was called away by death, and is now, I trust, among that white-robed throng, walking the gold-paved streets of the Celestial City. At first I was overwhelmed by despair, that my last blossom should be taken from me, but I grew to recognize the hand of God in all that had occurred, and to bow in submission to the Divine will.</p> 
               <p>"I have never been troubled by Rupert Southbank since the night I fled from him, and I have long since ceased to fear him. I am an old woman now. My once beautiful brown hair is frightfully streaked with silver, and my dark eyes, my husband used to call 'deep wells of thought,' are faded and dimmed by unshed tears. Inexorable Time has left his mark upon my brow, and I know that each year is bearing me swiftly onward to the tomb. But I do not fear; I rather welcome the silent repose of the grave after the labor of life is, ended; to hear the 'Well done thou good and faithful servant' from the lips of my Judge. I never hope to meet the loved ones again on earth, but at the last great day, when the secrets of the world are made known, I trust all will be made right.</p> 
               <p>"I have finished the story of my life, dear Laura, and I would be alone with the past. I thank you for, your kind attention, and hope that your fresh young life may never be blighted by such sorrow as I have experienced."</p> 
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5689-00000027"/> 
               <p>Her story was ended, and with my warmest thanks and one kiss upon her upturned lips, I withdrew. As I mused in the silence of my own room, upon the life-history I had just heard, I contrasted the life of that calm-browed woman putting resolutely aside her own griefs and thinking most of the welfare of others, going among the sick and destitute, like a ministering angel, with pleasant words and many little nameless acts of kindness, with that of the gloomy, misanthropic Agnes, nursing her sorrows in solitude, a burden to herself and others, and could but admit that there was indeed something in the Religion which should make such a difference in the lives of those two people.</p>

               <p>May at last; sweet, smiling May, with its buds and blossoms, its blue skies and balmy spring breezes. As I sit by the open window in the library, my eyes wander from the page before me out into the broad meadows to the dark forest beyond, and everything, from the green-robed trees to the yellow dandelions springing up by the wayside, tells me that Spring is here. The trees in the apple orchard are in full bloom, and the faint odor of the pale blossoms steals in at the open window as I sit and listen to the joyous bird-songs which are gushing from the tiny throats of the feathered songsters, as if each were vying with the other in rejoicing with all nature on this beautiful May-day, and, to my imagination, calling upon others to feel as grateful and happy as themselves. Everything out of doors looked so inviting that at last I arose, and, throwing on hat and shawl, went out into the bright sunlight to while away the long hours which yet remained before the close of day. Perfect stillness reigned around. Not a leaf rustled. Not a sound disturbed the monotonous stillness. I wandered along in a kind of listless, aimless way, now and then stopping to gather a few spring flowers which grew around, till at last,<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5689-00000028"/> tired of walking, I threw myself down at the foot of a large tree, and, for want of better employment, began to arrange the flowers I had gathered into a boquet. My task was an easy one and soon completed, and I had plenty of opportunity to admire the beautiful landscape which lay stretched out before me. I had walked farther than I had at first intended, and now the pretty village of Grahamville lay before me, looking sufficiently picturesque to please the eye of the most fastidious, while in the distance Graham Lodge loomed up tall and stately from amid a grove of trees, seeming a fitting habitation for the last of the haughty Grahams. I had learned much of late of the history of my family.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Agnes had given me permission to appropriate a small piece of ground for my own use as, a flower-garden, and I had spent much of my time in taking care of it, planting seeds, taking care to select the choicest varieties, in which I was aided by the old gardener, Timothy, who seemed to take almost as much pride as myself in the arrangement of it. He was a shrewd, sensible old fellow, but very talkative, and, while assisting me in my little garden, would tell me long stories about the former grandeur of the Lodge, when my grandfather was in his prime, and my mother and Aunt Agnes beautiful young ladies-for he had been long in the service of the family, and could tell me much that I wished to know. "Miss Agnes," he would say, "was the belle of the village. None could equal, and all admired her as with stately grace she glided about, doing the honors of her father's mansion. But Miss Alice, poor birdie, was the pet of them all. She was of a lively, cheerful disposition, excessively fond of society, and, surrounded with gay young companions, would make the house ring with her gleeful laughter, dancing in and out like a sunbeam,<pb n=""/> and drawing allay hearts to her by the unaffected kindness of her manner and the sweetness of her disposition." He described, with tearful earnestness, the day when my mother, with her young husband, Marcus Clifford, left them for a distant home; the sorrow of the aged father about to part from his favorite child, the darling of his heart, and the solace of his declining years; the grief of the gentle Agnes, and the sobs and lamentations of the servants, who feared they would never see Miss Alice's sweet face any more; of the fond care and tenderness with which Agnes cherished her father, striving nobly to fill the place of the lost Alice, and how, as he descended into the vale of years, he learned to lean upon her for support and strength. Oh! those were indeed happy days, but the old master died, and blight and mildew fell upon that bright young blossom, leaving it the withered thing which it now appears. Then he would tell me of my mother's illness and death, and of my father's inconsolable grief. How I, who was then but a child, was placed, in Madam Lyle's, after which Marcus Clifford started in an outward bound vessel for France. Then came the sickening details of an awful shipwreck, which made me fatherless and left me alone in the great world a helpless orphan. All this he would tell me with pleasure, yet when I questioned him concerning the great sorrow to which he alluded, he would reply briefly, and leave me as if fearful of imparting something which it was not right for me to know. All that I learned only served to convince me that there was some painful and unhappy mystery, which I had yet to unravel. The more I learned of it, the more complicated it became. I had fathomed the mystery of the ghost, but this only served to increase my perplexity. This is how it happened: I had found an unusually interesting book in<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5689-00000029"/> the library, one evening a few weeks previous, and becoming absorbed in its contents had read on regardless of the lapse of time, till, on looking at my watch, I was astonished to find it was near midnight. The family had all retired, and thinking to reach my own room without awakening them, I stole noiselessly through the dark hall and up the broad staircase, and was about to enter my room when my eyes rested upon an object which caused me to turn, faint with terror, and to shrink back into the darkness, while the beating of my heart became almost audible. On came the mysterious figure, proceeding directly toward me. It was the same that Catharine, the servant girl, had seen, and, as it approached me, the light from the lamp which it carried fell upon the pale face, giving them such an unearthly look that it made me shudder to behold them. On it came directly toward me, as I stood near the door of Aunt Agnes' room, and, could it be possible? I recognized in the face which was turned toward me-Aunt Agnes! She stood for a moment glancing around the hall, and then, with a dreary sigh, opened the door of her room and disappeared within the apartment. For a moment I doubted the evidence of my own senses, but at last I was forced to confess that it was, indeed, too true. The melancholy, reserved Agnes Graham, was the ghostly visitant which had aroused the superstitious fears of the servants, and, I must confess, disturbed, in no small degree, my usual serenity. What could it mean? I asked myself the question, but could find no solution of the mystery, and though I had repeated it many times since, it was always with the same result, and now, on this May afternoon, I was forced to acknowledge to myself that I was no nearer finding a solution of the mystery than I had ever been.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>I found tea waiting when I reached home, and proceeded to my room to bathe my face and smooth my tangled curls before appearing at table. My toilet was soon completed, and I prepared to descend to the dining-room. What was my astonishment on reaching that part of the hall from which the rooms in the east wing opened, to find one of the doors, which had been left ajar, swinging in the breeze which came in from an open window. Opposite the door, and in full view, hung a veiled portrait which I felt instinctively to be the one which formerly occupied the vacant niche in the library. At that moment, a sudden draft of air slowly lifted the veil which hung before it, and I stood spell-bound before the vision of loveliness there revealed. It was the picture of a young and beautiful lady of the blonde style of beauty, with sheeny golden hair falling like a silken veil around. the polished shoulders, and a face which, even the hasty glimpse I had of it, showed me to be radiantly, matchlessly beautiful. One little hand was half upraised, and the whole attitude was one of earnest entreaty, while the beautiful eyes were raised beseechingly, like a child pleading for some forbidden pleasure. As I stood gazing eagerly upon the beautiful face before me, the veil settled down over it and concealed it from my sight. Curiosity urged me strongly to enter the apartment and discover, if possible, the strange mystery which enveloped it. Here was presented a favorable opportunity, better, probably, than I would ever have again, and why not improve it? Had I not a right to know the reason why I was forced to lead my present uncongenial life, and why Aunt Agnes, my only relative, was so unlike other people? What was there improper in my adopting this method of fathoming the mystery? Once I would have entered gladly, and now why<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5689-00000030"/> hesitate when I could have learned all with scarcely an effort? But this was specious reasoning, and I would not linger longer to listen. I would not allow curiosity to urge me on to an unworthy action; my better nature triumphed, and I turned resolutely away, thinking, as I went, that I would never again attempt to fathom it. If Aunt Agnes did not wish to inform me, it could not be right for me to know.</p> 
               <p>Time dragged slowly by at the Lodge until June came again; then an incident occurred which changed the whole current of my after life. One mild, sweet summer's day, tired of the monotonous stillness of the house, I started for a ride through the woods upon Hyacinth, the pony which Aunt Agnes had given me, and which had now grown into a famous horse. The trees looked beautiful in their green livery, and I rode slowly through the grand old woods, with a strange sense of quiet and security in the peaceful solitude. Filled with enjoyment of the scene, I prolonged my ride till the declining sun warned me of the lateness of the hour and the necessity of returning immediately. I was some distance from home, and though I urged on my horse, twilight was stealing over the earth before I had accomplished a third of the distance. I shuddered as I entered the woods, they looked so gloomy and sombre, and as Hyacinth went stumbling over the obstacles which every now and then obstructed our path, I felt that I would have given much to have been once more safely ensconced in my own room at Graham Lodge. As I was just emerging from the edge of the wood, a shrill whistle startled my horse, which plunged forward so suddenly as to throw me from my seat with great violence. For a long time I was unconscious, and when my ideas came back to me I was reclining in the arms of a<pb n=""/> gentleman whom I had never seen before, and who was bathing my face with water, which he had brought from a small stream near by. As soon as I was able to converse, the stranger, who gave his name as Percy Eveleth, informed me that, as he was riding leisurely along, he had been alarmed by the sight of a riderless horse plunging madly past him, and, fearing an accident, he had hastened forward and found me lying senseless by the roadside. He had used every means in his power to bring me back to consciousness, and now, with a graceful bow, he said he was happy to congratulate me upon my restoration. I thanked him for his kindness and attempted to rise, but a sudden pain in my ankle caused me to sink back again, and on examining the injured member, I found that it had been badly sprained by the fall. Here was a new and unlooked for cause for anxiety. What was I to do? Still at quite a distance from home,-the pain in my ankle so great that I could only by great effort of the will keep back the tears which forced themselves into my eyes;-my horse already, probably, waiting at the door of his stable, and my only hope a faint, dim idea that possibly the return of my riderless horse might be discovered in time for them to send some one to my relief. I had been so long used to going when and where I chose since my residence at the Lodge, following in all things the bent of my own inclinations,-for there was no one to oppose my wishes, Aunt Agnes being wrapped up in herself, and Mrs. Miller having no authority to do so had she felt disposed,-that I knew that I would not be missed, and, therefore, when my companion gallantly offered his services as escort, there was no alternative left for me but to accept them. Despite the pain in my ankle, I enjoyed that ride home in the moonlight, my companion walking slowly by my side and endeavoring to<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5689-00000031"/> make me forget the embarrassment of my situation in his brilliant conversation, as I had not enjoyed anything before since my life at Graham Lodge began. When we reached the Lodge they were just beginning to be alarmed at my absence, having discovered Hyacinth standing outside the stable door neighing for admittance, and Mrs Miller was just dispatching a servant to go in search of me, when I rode up. My appearance relieved that good lady of considerable anxiety, and she hastened with alacrity to arrange the sofa pillows and adjust a footstool, while my companion lifted me from the saddle and carried me into the drawing-room. He was just about to wish us good evening, when Aunt Agnes entered the room. She started and turned deadly pale, and would have fallen had not the stranger handed her a chair, into which she sank helplessly, with her eyes riveted on his countenance in such a manner as to slightly embarrass the gentleman and also disconcert me not a little. However, I regained my self-possession and attempted to present him, but at the name of Eveleth, Aunt Agnes grew still whiter, and, with a low moan, sank upon the carpet utterly insensible. Everything was now in commotion-the frightened servants collecting, each in the other's way, and none with presence of mind enough to assist, until Mrs. Miller appearing, had Aunt Agnes conveyed to her own room, and a physician who had been sent for, arriving opportunely, I soon had the satisfaction of hearing that Aunt Agnes was recovering. Meanwhile Mr. Eveleth had taken his departure and I was carried to my room, where, after dressing my ankle, the physician left me, with the not very comforting assurance that it would be some time before I would have a chance to repeat my performance of that day and evening. In the retirement of my own room I had plenty of time to muse<pb n=""/> upon the singular conduct of Aunt Agnes on the night of the accident, and I at length came to the conclusion that Mr. Eveleth must have resembled some one whom she had formerly known.</p> 
               <p>Everything must have an end, and at length I was able to venture out again, and even to take an occasional ride, for I excelled in riding and was not afraid of another accident, and even if I had have been. Hyacinth showed by his looks of contrition that I had nothing to fear from him. Aunt Agnes always had a servant accompany me now, but as I had been used to going where inclination led, the presence of an attendant proved irksome, so at length I gave up riding almost entirely-only going out at rare intervals. One morning, however, I arose earlier than usual, and, opening the window, seated myself to enjoy the fresh morning air. A thousand diamond drops sparkled on tree and shrub, and the green hills looked so charmingly in the distance, with the mist sleeping on them, that I could think of nothing but the beauty around me and how delightful a race would be "over the hills, and far away." At last, yielding to the impulse, I ordered my horse brought around to the door, and, donning my riding habit, was soon careering through the valley at break-neck speed. I felt a keen sense of enjoyment in knowing that there was no one to observe me, and that I was alone among the free hills, with nothing but the blue sky above me and the velvet sward beneath my feet. As I rode along, I took off my little riding hat and waved it in the air in the exuberance of my spirits, my curls falling about my face in careless freedom. On I went, singing snatches of gay song-on, through meadows and green fields dotted with daisies, feeling, in the inspiration of the moment, that I was free as the birds of the air, with no one to observe me if I<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5689-00000032"/> chose to enact the romp for one blessed morning, and, best of all, that Graham Lodge, stately and sombre, with all its mysteries, was fast receding in the distance. So, singing gaily, I dashed down a steep hill, my head thrown back and my hair waving in the wind, while Hyacinth, seeming to have entered into the spirit of the race, was making unusually good time, when, just as I had taken a flying leap over a brook which wound noiselessly among the hills, a bend in the road discovered to my astonishment and horror the companion of my former adventure pursuing his way leisurely along the road. I was going with too much impetus to stop, so, as there was no other alternative, I dashed past him at a rapid rate, but not before I had time to notice the surprise depicted upon his countenance. He turned his horse's head and looked after me, and, evidently, coming to the conclusion that I was being run away with, spurred his horse into a canter and pursued me at a rapid rate. As soon as I heard the clatter of his horse's hoofs behind me I divined the whole, and a feeling of inexpressible chagrin and mortification taking possession of me, I thought of nothing but making my escape, and, accordingly, urged Hyacinth into a still faster gait. On I sped with the swiftness of an arrow, my long riding skirt streaming out behind me and my tangled curls flying in all directions, for my hat had slipped off and been trampled into the dust; still, on I went, tears of vexation filling my eyes as I thought of my ridiculous appearance, and then, overcome by the ludicrousness of the scene, I would laugh outright, until, like a haven of rest to the shipwrecked mariner, Graham Lodge rose in the distance, imparting new courage to my flagging energies, and seeming to reanimate Hyacinth, for he neighed loudly as I cheered him on, till at last, clearing the low fence at one leap, I rode panting and<pb n=""/> breathless up to the door. The servants congregated there, stared in speechless astonishment; but, ordering my horse to be taken care of, I hurried to my room, only too glad to be alone once again. When there, my love of the ludicrous triumphed, and I laughed loud and long at the whole affair. During the rest of the day I astonished Mrs. Miller by suddenly breaking into peals of laughter, and the injured look upon that good lady's countenance contributed not a little to my amusement.</p> 
               <p>I remained in the house for days after, not daring to take my accustomed ride, for fear of meeting Mr. Eveleth. But at length the stillness and lack of animation in all around me becoming unendurable, I started out for what I at first intended to be merely a short walk. I had chosen a rather warm day, and after walking some distance I threw myself, tired and heated, under the shade of a large spreading willow on the edge of the wood. Thinking to remain here until sundown, that I might the better enjoy the walk home, I took a book from my pocket, and, absorbed in the sublime strains of Milton's Paradise Lost, became unconscious of what was passing around me. I had read on perhaps for an hour, when I was startled by a low, deep growl, and looking up I beheld, rapidly approaching me, a large, ferocious looking dog, uttering a deep, hoarse baying, which made the blood curdle in my veins and rendered me utterly powerless to move. On he came with fearful rapidity, and as he approached nearer I knew by the glaring eyeballs and foam-covered mouth that the dog was mad. Involuntary I looked around for some means of escape. Before me lay the woods, and if I could reach them in time I would be safe; but this I soon saw was impossible. Every moment brought the animal nearer to me, and, sick with terror, I sat helplessly<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5689-00000033"/> awaiting my fate. It was hard to die thus early in the flush of youth and health when life seemed so attractive; to sit there calmly and anticipate death; oh! it was horrible! The animal was now but a few yards from me, and I could hear his deep panting breath as he came bounding on. One long lingering look around, there was no way of escape. The sickness of despair rolled over me. In one agonizing moment every word and act of my past life rose before me, standing out painfully distinct and seeming to rise up to condemn me. Then a strange stupor stole over me mercifully sealing my senses so that I uttered no sound, even when I felt the hot breath of the maddened animal upon my cheek. The sharp, quick report of fire-arms aroused me, and as I heard the distant echoes dying away among the hills I awoke to new life. A sudden wild thrill swept over me; a conviction that my dreadful peril was past. I opened my eyes and beheld the dog writhing in the dust at my feet, while I was safe and unharmed. Never more fervent, heartfelt prayer ascended to heaven than that which welled up from my heart, at my deliverance. Oh, that I had but dedicated to His service the life He had so mercifully preserved.</p> 
               <p>The sound of footsteps and a voice, not entirely strange, ringing in my ear, caused me to glance in the direction from whence the sound proceeded, and I beheld the companion of my former adventure, Mr. Eveleth, clad in hunting costume, bending over the form of the animal lying before me. I soon learned from him, what I had before divined, that I was indebted to his providential arrival for my deliverance. He would not listen to the thanks with which I would have overwhelmed him, but as we were about to separate, he asked permission to call at the Lodge the next day.<pb n=""/> This I did not feel at liberty to grant without first consulting Aunt Agnes, and wishing to be perfectly frank, I explained to him how I was situated, and also told him of my aunt's dislike of company and of the secluded life which she led. When I left him I promised, with Aunt Agnes' permission, to receive him as a visitor at the Lodge, and in spite of the misgivings which I felt about mentioning it to Aunt Agnes, my mind was busy with thoughts of future happiness in the society of Percy Eveleth.</p> 
               <p>I sought my aunt's room the moment I reached home. Since I had been an inmate of the Lodge I had never before ventured to intrude on her privacy, and my heart beat audibly at my own temerity; as I responded to her low "come in." I did not fail to observe the look of surprise which crossed her face as her eyes rested upon me, but crushing back all feeling I went to her and respectfully preferred my request. She listened with the deepest interest to my narration of the afternoon's thrilling adventure until I mentioned the name of my preserver and repeated the request he had made; then, with ashen lips, she sternly refused it. Pained by the refusal, and yet dreading to carry her reply to Mr. Eveleth, I urged my request, but with blanched features and voice trembling with emotion, she replied:</p> 
               <p>"Child, you know not what you ask. Admit an Eveleth again beneath my roof? Never."</p> 
               <p>"But why not, Aunt Agnes?" I asked, eagerly forgetting my awe of her in the new feeling which had taken possession of me. "What have you against this gentleman who, though a stranger, brings letters of introduction to the first people here, and from the most reliable sources? Oh, Aunt Agnes, what is all this strange mystery? Why do you, who<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5689-00000034"/> were once so fond of society, now prefer to live in solitude? Why is my life so unlike others of my own age? Aunt Agnes, on my bended knees I implore you to have mercy on the child of your dead sister. I conjure you, by the love which you once bore that sister, to tell me why my life is so unlike others, so strange and dreary. God knows I have tried by every means in my power to win your love, but it has been denied me. You would not let me be to you a daughter."</p> 
               <p>In my earnestness I had knelt before her, but the cold, stern look which gradually settled on her face, chilled and deprived me of the power to say more. She sat regarding me intently, and when I had finished, said, in a voice frostily clear,-</p> 
               <p>"Child, you rave; you have forgotten yourself. In refusing to grant your petition I have acted according to the dictates of my own judgment and for reasons which I do not see fit to explain. Enough, that I have acted wisely and for your good. You can go now and remember that I warn you to avoid a repetition of this scene in the future, and above all, never let me hear the name of Eveleth from your lips again."</p> 
               <p>She waved me from her with the air of a queen, and, too much bewildered for words, I obeyed her commands and silently left the room. I felt miserable enough after that and staid in the house for days after, as I wished to avoid a meeting with Mr. Eveleth. But at length I got in that frame of mind where everything seemed hateful to me, and I started out to see if I could not walk off some of my impatience. All day the clouds had portended rain, but I was just in that don't-care spirit which would not allow a shower of rain to impede my progress, so I started<pb n=""/> out for a solitary walk in no enviable frame of mind. I was nearly a mile from home when the clouds began to gather and large drops of rain fell upon my face and hands. I looked about for some shelter, under which I could remain until the worst of the storm was over. At a little distance I discovered a small, old-fashioned house, falling to decay, and looking so dismal, that I stood for a moment almost afraid to venture in; but the falling rain quickly decided me and I passed in at the gate, which creaked dismally, and up the narrow walk, overgrown with moss and weeds, and into the house, which I entered so hastily, for the rain, was now pouring down in torrents, that I ran against a gentleman, who had also sought shelter there from the rain, and whom, on a nearer survey, I found to be none other than Mr. Eveleth. He was evidently delighted at this unexpected meeting, and inquired kindly after my health, and if I had recovered from the effects of my late fright? My manner must have been constrained for he looked troubled and surprised, but was nevertheless just as anxious for my comfort, looking around and finally bringing me an old stool, the only thing in the shape of a seat to be found upon the premises, and placing me upon it. Bitter, rebellious feelings took possession of me, as I sat silently looking out at the pouring rain, while he, the preserver of my life, stood beside me and talked carelessly on, seeming hardly to expect a reply, as if with almost feminine instinct he divined the state of my mind, and at the same time wished to appear perfectly unconscious, hoping thereby to divert my thoughts from their unpleasant channel, in which last effort he succeeded only too well. It was impossible to listen to the beautiful, original ideas clothed in the glowing, graceful language, which betokened the<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5689-00000035"/> well-educated, well-read gentleman, without becoming deeply interested. And at last my eyes wandered from the gloomy prospect without to the earnest face of my companion, and my admiration and respect insensibly deepened as I looked and listened. I was an ardent admirer of the beautiful, and the picture before me was just the one to suit my "artist's eye," as Jessie used laughingly to say.</p> 
               <p>He stood opposite me, leaning against a rude beam, but the attitude was one of careless grace. One hand, white and soft as a lady's, supported the well-shaped head. The black, curling hair was thrown carelessly back from the white forehead, and the brilliant, eyes, like twin stars, looked kindly down upon me, yet their glance seemed to read the untold secrets of my heart as they rested upon me, and, though I knew not why, yet I felt ill at ease. Then, too, I was nervously dreading to have him mention the request he had made when we last met. It was too much to give him the short emphatic answer of Aunt Agnes, He was an honorable high-souled gentleman, and, having met by accident, wished to continue the acquaintance which promised to be a source of pleasure and profit to both. Of an old and highly respectable family, rich, talented and agreeable, why should Aunt Agnes hesitate to grant his simple request? I must prove my gratitude to the preserver of my life by declining further intercourse with him! But I could not bear to have him think ill of me; I would tell him all, and prove to him that it was out of my power to grant his request. So, walking home after the rain was over, with God's bow of promise spanning the heavens above us, and the rays of the setting sun gilding the tall tree-tops and making every leaf and tiny blade of grass sparkle with a thousand diamond drops, I told him of my life at Graham Lodge,-of the reserved, misanthropic<pb n=""/> thropic Agnes, whose very presence chilled me and made me feel so painfully the gulf between us,-of my thoughts and feelings, my wishes and desires. All this I poured into his listening ear, relating even that which, after my impetuous feelings had had time to cool, I regretted having told, namely, the mystery of the east wing. He listened with profound attention until I had finished, and then walked on for some moments in silence. At length, arousing himself as with an effort, he said, looking down upon me pityingly:</p> 
               <p>"I have heard somewhat of this before, Miss Laura. Perhaps you are not aware that your aunt's singularities are the frequent subject of remark among the gossips in the village, though no one seems able to throw the least light on the painful mystery to which you have alluded. However, it cannot be right for her to seek to deprive you of all society. I cannot imagine why Miss Graham should be so prejudiced against all who bear the name of Eveleth. Perhaps it is but the hallucination of a disordered fancy, or it may be that the name brings up disagreeable reminiscences of her former life; but, however that may be; Laura Clifford will surely not allow an idle prejudice to banish from her side one who would be only too proud to be called her friend."</p> 
               <p>Standing there, with a pleading earnestness in his voice, and the great, dark eyes looking so entreatingly into mine, with the full consciousness that he had so short a time before rescued me from a horrible death, and, feeling above all that it was as much pity for my loneliness as anything else that actuated him, was it a wonder that the warning voice of Aunt Agnes faded and was forgotten, or if remembered for a moment at best, appeared but an idle fancy, and that I then and there promised him the friendship. of Laura Clifford as long as he should value it. The look of earnest<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5689-00000036"/> gratitude which he gave me, and the almost tender voice in which he bade me good-bye filled me with a strange happiness, and gave me food for thought long after.</p> 
               <p>After that, I often met Mr. Eveleth in my walks, and we became much more intimately acquainted with each other than would have been possible had we met in society. Sometimes the thought of Aunt Agnes' displeasure, if she knew that Percy Eveleth was my constant companion, would steal in to mar my enjoyment, making me wretched and miserable, and I would at times make up my mind to tell her what troubled me; but then would come the recollection of her stern face and cold words, and I would shrink from my self-imposed task. I was weak. I could not summon the requisite courage to pass through the trying ordeal again.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <p>There was one other inmate of Graham Lodge, whom I have omitted to mention, and this was Miss Nancy Redfield, a kind of maid-of-all-work, who had been installed in her present position just before my arrival at the Lodge. She was a genuine specimen of a Yankee, this Nancy, and afforded me no little amusement. Her personal appearance was certainly not what might be called attractive. Her form was tall, gaunt and bony, with hands and feet of enormous size, and a broad, good-natured moon face, which was, however, considerably freckled, while her eyes, which were of a light blue, reminded me of an owl's-they were so round and staring. Then her hair was of that peculiar shade which, though denominated by its possessor of "paly gold," was certainly unmistakably yellow, and her voice-but here I must pause, for it would be absolutely impossible for any one who had never heard her mellifluous accents to gain any idea of Nancy Redfield's voice. Added to this, her manners were very eccentric-she possessing great ideas of her own importance. Wasn't her father a "well-to-do farmer in Varmount," and "couldn't Miss Nancy have remained at home and helped <emph>mar</emph> make butter and cheese if her Yankee go-aheaditiveness and desire to see something of life beyond the borders of her father's farm, and a love of such fineries as <emph>par</emph> declared couldn't be bought with his money, had not launched her out upon a cold, unfeeling world?" Certainly<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5689-00000037"/> Miss Nancy considered herself on an equality with the best of them, as she herself declared, and was perfectly willing to have it made known. On my arrival at the Lodge I was fortunate enough to make a conquest of Miss Nancy, for she seemed to take me under her special charge, and the present of a gay, flounced robe, together with some bright colored ribbons to adorn her flowing locks, made her my firm friend forever. She took upon herself the entire charge of my apartments, never allowing any of the other servants to enter them, while, if the bell of my dressing-room rang, Nancy's good-natured face was the first to appear, with a look of anxious expectancy upon her countenance truly amusing. But, though extremely honest and good-natured, Nancy did not lack common sense, as I soon learned. She possessed the true Yankee shrewdness, with great powers of observation, and had a way of finding out secrets and a love of the marvelous such as no daughter even of curious Eve ever had before or since. How she learned, however, of the growing friendship between Percy Eveleth and myself, I could not imagine, but I soon became convinced that she was perfectly aware of the accidental meetings between us, and, also, that Mr. Eveleth had been denied admittance to the Lodge.</p> 
               <p>After this discovery I unconsciously began to place confidence in Nancy, which I never had cause to regret, as she proved always loyal and true. Good Nancy Redfield, how many in this world like thee hide the most generous impulses beneath an almost repulsive exterior!</p> 
               <p>I met Mr. Eveleth often now, and many of the happiest moments of my life were passed in his society. The Summer glided away like a dream of heaven, and ere I was aware of it, the leaves began to fall and the autumn blasts<pb n=""/> to whistle dismally through the naked branches of the trees. Then Percy Eveleth, who had already lingered longer in Grahamville than he had at first intended, left for his home in the metropolis. Our parting was a hurried one, but before his departure he exacted from me a promise to correspond regularly with him. Oh, how lonely I felt after he had gone, and I shuddered as I thought of the long Winter to be spent in that dismal abode, with its dread mysteries and solemn splendor, but already hope beckoned me on to a future which looked so bright and alluring that I forgot the present gloom in anticipation of a future all sunshine and happiness.</p>

               <p>The Winter passed much as the former one had done, nothing occurring to relieve the monotony of our lives. The Christmas holidays came and went, and though Aunt Agnes gave me presents of great value, yet I would have given them all for one word of love and sympathy, so great was my longing for affection. Mr. Eveleth's letters, however, served to enliven many tedious hours, and from being at first merely letters of friendship they grew almost insensibly warmer till they seemed more like those of a lover than a friend. But though those tender missives came like a healing balm to my troubled heart, still I considered this merely platonic friendship, not admitting that they were growing still dearer to me every day.</p> 
               <p>But with the buds and blossoms of May, Percy Eveleth came again, and, after greeting me with rapturous delight, told me of the deep, fervent love which he bore me. I felt my whole being filled with new happiness, and I breathed a prayer of glad thanksgiving to the wise All-Father for this most precious gift-the love of a kindred spirit that could fully satisfy all the cravings of my nature.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Oh, how I reveled in this dream of bliss. A new world seemed suddenly to open before me. It seemed as if I was commencing a new existence-that a radiant and blissful future dawned upon me, where I was to walk amid the glowing beauties of an Eden luxuriating in a dream of bliss. I was delirious with joy. I, who had so yearned for love, who had all my life-long been seeking a kindred soul; I, who had famished for love and affection; I, to possess all this priceless wealth of sincere affection!</p> 
               <p>As I stood in my own room, brushing my curls before the mirror, it seemed to me that I had undergone a strange metamorphosis; that I was not the same person who had, only a short time before, stood in that same position, pale and listless, languidly performing my wonted task. Now my cheeks were flushed to a vivid crimson, and my eyes lustrous and radiant with the light of my new-found happiness. It seemed to me that there was a dream between every stroke of the hair-brush. It was a long time before I stopped to think of anything but my rare good fortune, but I was at length aroused by the request of Percy, to be allowed to acquaint Aunt Agnes with the fact of our engagement. He had never been within the walls of Graham Lodge since the night of the accident which first made us acquainted. Our interviews had all been beyond the boundaries of the park, with nothing but the blue ,sky above and the velvet sward beneath our feet. It had never entered my mind that I was thus wilfully deceiving Aunt Agnes. It had seemed fit that we should meet where there was nothing to remind us of Graham Lodge and its hateful mysteries, but now, with the clear dark eyes of Percy Eveleth looking down upon me, as if to read my very soul, a feeling of shame and self-condemnation stole over me, mingled with regret, that I should<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5689-00000039"/> ever have been led to adopt a course calculated to compromise my dignity in the eyes of him for whose good opinion I would have given more than that of all the world beside. Now I said I would go to her immediately and ask her to sanction our engagement, but then arose that "sober, second thought."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Agnes' health had been failing, slowly but surely, during the past Winter, and she was now confined to her room most of the time. I had often, of late, when she had appeared more restless than usual, entreated her to let me read to her, or perform any of those little acts of kindness dictated by love and affection, but she had refused, at first coldly, but lately in. a kindlier manner, though still firmly. The question now arose in my mind, Would it be right to go to her with the forbidden subject when she was ill and suffering? It was clearly impossible for the present, and, coward that I was, as I remembered her vehement language upon a former occasion, I felt glad that circumstances had placed it out of my power to communicate with her again upon the subject. So the revelation that should have been made long before was kept back, while I reveled in the ecstasy of "love's young dream."</p> 
               <p>In the companionship of Percy Eveleth, by his side, drinking in the rich music of his voice, or gazing into the depths of those dark eyes, full of tenderness and love, I had no thought of duty. In this heaven on earth, I forgot all else save that I was his beloved, his chosen one. That was enough. God forgive me, if I yielded to idolatry! It was my nature to love deeply, passionately, and I would not have had it otherwise. It seemed almost as if I lived a lifetime in those few short months; and the knowledge that I was loved as deeply, with a love as pure and innocent as my<pb n=""/> own, filled me with joy; this made for me an earthly paradise. But I was suddenly and rudely awakened from my blissful dreams by an event that shrouded our household in gloom. One sultry August evening, Aunt Agnes was taken with strong convulsions, and though she rallied and grew better, it was the opinion of her physician that, ere the approach of Autumn, she would have passed to "that bourne from whence no traveler e'er returns." I was struck with consternation at this announcement,, and all her former coldness and indifference departed from my mind. Perhaps my heartfelt sorrow touched the cold heart of the unhappy woman, or it may be that a foreshadowing of her coming doom softened her stern nature, for she came to treat me with more cordiality, until, at last, I dared to think my visits were welcomed by her. Thinking thus, I visited her oftener, and at length came to be an established nurse, second only to Mrs. Miller in the sick room. I had so hungered for her love that I considered this a precious boon, and sometimes, when sitting by her bedside, I would find her watching me with her great, black eyes, with a look almost of affectionate regard, and which made me strangely happy.</p> 
               <p>I was so constantly in attendance upon Aunt Agnes that I saw but little of Percy Eveleth, yet those hours in the sick-room almost compensated me for the loss of his society. A few short, blissful moments, when I went out to breathe the pure air, and one or two tender, love-fraught missives was all that I had of him during those long weeks. Aunt Agnes lingered on, strangely, even after the leaves began to assume their autumn garb, but we dared not hope for her recovery. We knew that the fiat had gone forth-that the star of her destiny had set, and she would soon be lost to us forever.</p> 
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5689-00000040"/> 
               <p>One night, after a day fraught with a mournful happiness to me, such a day as would give me food for thought long after, sitting by her side with her hand clasped in mine, she fell into a fitful slumber. As I sat gazing upon her pale, face, marked with lines of terrible suffering, a feeling almost of remorse and self-condemnation filled my soul as I thought of my intimacy with one whom she had forbidden me ever to mention in her presence, and I saw how wrong I had been not to have confided in her, even after our engagement, to tell her how dear he had grown to me, and then to throw myself on her compassion after having given her this proof of my confidence. But it was now forever too late! Already treading upon the confines of another world, I dared not call her soul back from the contemplation of the glories of that heavenly land. I could not agitate her mind, already weakened by sickness, by matters of mere worldly interest. I could only heave a sigh of regret that it was now too late. The tears gathered in my eyes, and, as I brushed them away, I found the gaze of Aunt Agnes fixed upon me inquiringly. With affectionate solicitude, she asked the cause of my grief; and though I tried to evade the subject, yet she returned to it again after responding to my remarks.</p> 
               <p>"You are unhappy," she said, "and I do not wonder at it. You are formed for society, fitted to become one of its brightest ornaments, and it is wrong for you to waste the dewy freshness of youth within these solemn, cloister-like walls. I have been selfish. I have allowed my own grief to become inordinate in its indulgence, forgetting that happiness is to be found in ministering to the wants of others. Alas! that I have obtained this knowledge too late to profit by it. I have spent the years of my life in nursing the<pb n=""/> memory of the bitter wrongs of my early days, not thinking or forgetting that this was selfish. Take solemn warning from my unhappy life and live not for yourself alone. I have had wrongs which have changed the whole current of my life, and only upon my death-bed have I brought myself to throw the veil of charity over the misdeeds of others. But now, standing upon the brink of the dark river, with the solemn murmur of the waters sounding in my cars, and, beyond the river, the forms of those radiant ones waiting to welcome me to a home where all is joy and peace, I can say from the depths of my heart, 'Father, forgive them; they know not what they do.' I shall soon pass away from earth. Even now I feel death's icy hand upon my brow and chilling the life blood in my veins. A few more throbs of this weary heart and I am at rest forever. Deal charitably with my memory after I am gone, and remember that Aunt Agnes died blessing you for your forgiving love and kindness. In an apartment in my private desk there is a manuscript written after my failing health warned me of the approach of the destroyer. It contains a faithful history of my life. I feel that it is due to you, my darling, and it does not pain me to know that when I am gone you will read the written record of my heart secrets. Would that I had the strength to give you the story from my own lips, but that will tell you all you desire to know, and, perhaps, after all, it is for the best."</p> 
               <p>She closed her eyes wearily, and her lips moved as if in prayer. Then the pallor of death crept over her face, a gray ashen hue settled around her lips, and her breath came quick and short. Then, as I rang the bell violently, she opened her eyes and said, imploringly,-</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Laura, can this be death? Yes, I feel it creeping<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5689-00000041"/> over me. Farewell, Laura darling. Father,-mother,-I come, I come! Eveleth, this is indeed heaven!"</p> 
               <p>A smile of ecstatic joy illuminated her countenance; the dark eyes grew almost unearthly in their splendor, and with the name of Eveleth trembling upon her lips, the name that was dearer to me than all others, her spirit passed from this world forever. When the rest of the household came pouring into the room, in answer to my summons, there was nothing left but the corpse of Agnes Graham!</p>

               <p>At last it was over, and all that was left of my last relative had been yielded back to mother earth. Yes, my only friend "slept the sleep that knows no waking, in the narrow house appointed for all the living." I was now completely friendless and alone-alone! I repeated the word, and the slumbering echoes woke and answered, mockingly, alone! The night wind swept up damp and chill from the river, and rustled the papers upon the table before me, creeping among the little mementos of the departed, which covered it-for it was her room which I now occupied-and then fanning my cheek caressingly, till it seemed like the touch of fairy-fingers upon my forehead, and wooing me with an almost mesmeric influence to a drowsy, slumberous mood. A mysterious influence seemed to throw a sort of spell upon me, and I could only sit idly thinking of the past, and shudder as I thought of the dread presence that had entered so short a time ago and borne away the spirit of Agnes Graham. As I sat thus absorbed in thought, I suddenly remembered the mysterious packet to which my aunt had alluded in our last conversation, and wishing for something to occupy my mind I arose from my seat, and going to the<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5689-00000042"/> receptacle for her private papers, secured the manuscript, and was soon attentively absorbed in its contents. It ran thus:</p> 
               <p>"I will try to be calm, dear Laura, while I inscribe upon these pages the story of a woman's love and a woman's wrongs-the old, old story, and which is still new to every one who live and love and suffer. I will unveil to your eyes that which, until I had known and loved you, I never expected would be made known until that great day when the quick and dead are summoned to the judgment-seat of God. Once I was as warm-hearted and affectionate as yourself. Your mother and myself were the only children of kind and indulgent parents. I was the eldest. We were reared in affluence, and when I attained the age of sixteen I was sent away to a fashionable boarding-school, at some distance from home. There I met a young lady who was to exert a powerful influence over my destiny. Lilian St. Erme was just the opposite of myself, both in character and personal appearance. I was more like the passionate daughter of the south, while Lilian's pure blonde beauty and artless, childlike manners, won all hearts at once. But beneath that calm exterior I learned, all too soon for my happiness, there lay concealed the most malignant passions; that she was revengeful and jealous, and she would make it the study of her life to revenge herself on one who had wronged her.</p> 
               <p>"Not far from the seminary stood a medical college. One of the students, a handsome young southerner, attracted the attention of Lilian, who was an ardent admirer of his dark style of beauty. Accident brought them together, and the result of their acquaintance was a violent attachment on Lilian's part, which she fondly imagined was fully reciprocated by its object. I, as Lilian's most intimate friend, was<pb n=""/> of course in her confidence, and I listened eagerly to a story calculated to interest my feelings and enlist my sympathies. I saw that it was no feeble passion, her love for this man, but that it was deep and all-absorbing. But I was not so sure of Wayne. He seemed to regard Lilian more as a friend, and I had more than once been startled by his glances of warm admiration and the nameless little tender acts, which made me fear that I was becoming the rival of my friend. But this thought troubled me, and I dismissed it from my mind, chiding myself for my vanity in supposing for a moment that I could successfully rival the beautiful Lilian.</p> 
               <p>"I had nearly forgotten the subject when an incident occurred which brought it forcibly to my mind again. I was alone in my room one day, industriously preparing my lessons which were unusually long and difficult, when one of the servants, whom the girls had often bribed to perform little offices for them, knocked stealthily at the door, and on gaining admittance placed a letter in my hand and vanished without stopping to reply to my exclamations of amazement. It was from Carl Wayne, and contained an offer of his heart and hand. As I finished reading it and looked up involuntarily for Lilian, she entered, and without stopping to consider, I handed her the letter. She read it to the end; then with a face of deathly pallor, and eyes blazing with passion, she confronted me, and in language unbecoming one who professed to be a lady, poured forth her rage and despair in one resistless tide. She raved like an insane creature, called me a false-hearted hypocrite, adding, with looks of malignant hatred, that she detested me, and would surely be revenged; and then she left me overwhelmed with sorrow that the one I had so loved and trusted had proved unworthy of my affection.</p> 
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5689-00000043"/> 
               <p>"As soon as I could command myself sufficiently, I wrote an answer to Carl Wayne, telling him in as few words as possible that I did not love him and could never be his wife, and dispatching it by the servant I have mentioned, seated myself in no enviable frame of mind to indulge in a passionate burst of tears. After that I felt better, and the thought that I had not intentionally wronged Lilian did much to calm my excited feelings, though I felt the profoundest pity for the unhappy girl.</p> 
               <p>"The next day I was called home to the bedside of my dying mother, and in my wretchedness at the loss of my beloved parent, I forgot all about the unfortunate affair at school; and as I did not again return to it, I forgot it all the sooner. Nearly two years had elapsed when I unexpectedly received a letter from Lilian, saying, 'that a maiden aunt, who had long filled the place of mother to her, and from whom she had expected to inherit a large amount of property, had suddenly taken it into her head to get married, and she was now left alone, penniless, and without a friend in the world,'-the new husband possessing several children of his own and regarding Lilian as an interloper.</p> 
               <p>"She now appealed to me in this dire extremity, 'trusting,' as she said, 'to my generous nature to forgive the words uttered in the heat of passion and long since forgotten.' At this news of Lilian, all my old love for her revived, and I wrote a speedy reply to her letter, telling her to come to me without delay, and she should fill the place of a sister. I was alone with my father, for my sister Alice, (your mother, Laura,) had left us with her young husband, and I rejoiced in the anticipation of the pleasure I should experience in Lilian's society. She came, I received her with the greatest cordiality, and tried to make her feel that<pb n=""/> henceforth she was to be one of the family. She appeared to feel the deepest sorrow for her former conduct, and though I bade her not to mention it, yet she persisted until I was obliged to listen.</p> 
               <p>"'She had avoided Mr. Wayne,' she said, 'after the discovery that she had given her love in vain, and tried to conquer her too absorbing, but vain passion for him. But he had at last contrived to meet her, and asked eagerly for news of Agnes, and if there was indeed no hope of his love ever being returned, and,' she added, 'as I slowly repeated the words <emph>no hope</emph>, the look of despair that settled upon his bright, eager face, was terrible to witness, and without a word he left me for the last time. I never saw him more. He died soon after, of fever, and in his delirium called constantly on the name of Agnes Graham.'</p> 
               <p>"I knew, by the expression of anguish on the features of Lilian, as she closed her narration, that she still suffered from the pangs of unrequited love, and that time had done little to soften her grief, and the strange expression in her blue eyes, as she regarded me fixedly during the silence that followed, almost frightened me, and brought back vividly to my mind that scene at school when. Lilian first knew of Carl Wayne's love for me, but the look faded from her eyes, and twining her arms about me she called me her dearest earthly friend, telling me that henceforth she would dedicate her life to one who had befriended her when all beside had deserted her, and prove that there was something sacred in the name of friendship. As I sat clasped in her arms, her eyes looking lovingly into mine, her rich voice pouring subtle flatteries into my ear, is it to be wondered at that I forgot, in the fascination of her presence, that she who was<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5689-00000044"/> uttering those honied words had vowed to be revenged upon me sooner or later, or forfeit her life in the attempt. Ah! I little knew then, in my innocence of the world's ways, that we are not to expect sincerity or truth from any one, and that those who are the most lavish in their professions of friendship are often our worst enemies. So I loved and trusted Lilian St. Erme, all unconscious of the deep hatred she bore me. But, though I loved Lilian, there was one who considered her presence at the Lodge an intrusion, and this was Walter Eveleth, my affianced husband. I had met him after my return from school, and from learning to value him as a friend I had grown to love him with a love lasting as life itself. He grew jealous of my devotion to the friendless Lilian, and when I laughingly accused him of selfishness in wishing to monopolize me entirely, he answered, seriously,-</p> 
               <p>"'No, Agnes, I am not selfish when I wish so much for your dear society, but it seems to me that you place too much confidence in this stranger. It seems, though I do not like to say it of your friend, that treachery lurks in the depths of those beautiful eyes, and that the smile which hovers continually round the delicately chiseled lips has something in it of insincerity, but,' he added, seeing that I looked annoyed, 'perhaps I am prejudiced, for I'll confess I don't like to have Miss St. Erme break in upon our <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tete-a-tetes</foreign>, as happens so frequently now-a-days. Oh! Agnes,' and a shade crossed his handsome face, 'I fear that the old days, when we were so happy together, will never come again. I feel a strange presentiment of coming evil; my mind is oppressed with gloomy forebodings, which I try in vain to shake off.'</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I was so annoyed at Walter's thoughts of Lilian that I did not reply to his last remark. His comments upon my friend brought before my mind the similar warnings I had received from my school companions not to place confidence in Lilian St. Erme. But I was already fascinated with her and turned coldly from them, ascribing their remarks to jealousy. I had never seen anything exceptionable about her, save when I surprised her with Wayne's confession of love. Then, in an unguarded moment, she had betrayed traits of character which I had never dreamed she possessed, but subsequently she had shown such humility and gentleness that the memory of the stormy interview had nearly faded from my mind, and I was ready to believe Lilian St. Erme all that she appeared to be. So, in my impetuosity, I poured all her troubles into the ear of my companion, dwelling upon her forlorn condition until Walter's dark eyes grew moist with feeling, and his fine face glowed with sympathy, and he promised to aid me in every way which lay in his power to make the orphaned Lilian once more happy. After our conversation, Walter exerted himself to please Lilian, and as the weeks flew by, I noticed with pleasure the growing friendship between them.</p> 
               <p>"Lilian was extremely fascinating, and when she exerted herself to please, her efforts were always sure to be crowned with success. And that she did exert herself to suit the fastidious taste of Walter Eveleth, though without appearing to do so I felt sure; but I supposed it was solely because I loved him that she wished to win his regards. As the weeks flew by Walter grew more and more fascinated with Lilian, and they were much in each other's society, for my dear father had become an invalid, and I spent most of my<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5689-00000045"/> time by his bedside. So I was thankful that I could have Eveleth in such good society. Once when he had been dwelling with admiration in every look and tone upon Lilian's beauty and goodness I rallied him upon his former judgment of her, asking if he now detected treachery and insincerity in her countenance, and what he now thought of those eyes with their snake-like glitter. At first he looked incredulous, seemingly to have forgotten that he was ever the author of the words, then a look of annoyance overspread his face as he expressed his astonishment at his ever having been so prejudiced as to have mentioned treachery in conjunction with such a peerless creature, adding that she was pure and beautiful as an angel. The long days of Summer passed slowly by. I was in constant attendance upon my suffering parent, and though I was thankful that I was permitted to be the comfort and solace of his declining years, yet I could not repress a sigh of weariness when I saw Lilian descend the stairs looking so piquant and sparkling in her fresh young beauty, habited for a ride, and listened to her silvery laughter which came floating in at the open window clear and musical as a bird-song, and heard the deep voice of Walter complimenting her upon her appearance in his earnest, heartfelt tones, and I would turn with a feeling of strange unrest from the window to try and repress my selfish longing for a ride over the hills where I could feel the pure air upon my aching brow.</p> 
               <p>"Then at evening when I sat by my father's couch, soft, sweet strains of music would come stealing into the room, like the strains of an Eolian harp. Then the pure voice of Lilian, accompanying the instrument, filled the room with a flood of harmony-now rising clear and powerful in some<pb n=""/> triumphal chorus, and then dying away into low, dreamy cadences, until one almost imagined the music of the spheres had stolen in upon mortal senses. Then, though I would chide myself for my foolishness, yet the tears would fall thick and fast as I thought of Eveleth's passionate fondness for music, and how, in the good old days that were past, he used to hang over the piano and speak in glowing terms of my singing. Now it was Lilian who sung for him and discussed his favorite authors, lingering over the little tender passages which we had conned together, and which he had marked for my eye alone. I was very rarely with them now, and though my absence was deeply regretted at first, yet I saw with pain what was but too evident, that now I was hardly missed.</p> 
               <p>"Well, my kind old father died, leaving me so occupied with my grief, that I thought less of the growing intimacy between Lilian and Eveleth. But I was aroused to the knowledge of the fact all too soon for my peace of mind. I arose late one morning, and on entering the breakfast room, found that Lilian had not yet made her appearance. This did not surprise me, as she was never an early riser, and telling the servant to call her I ordered in the breakfast. The moments flew by, and as she did not appear, I was just sitting down to breakfast when the servant reappeared, saying she had rapped again and again upon the door of her room, and called loudly several times without receiving any reply. Fearing she was ill I ordered the servant to forcibly enter the room, and waited with great anxiety for her return. In a few moments she came back with the announcement that Lilian was nowhere to be seen, but a note had been found upon the dressing-table of her room, bearing my address. With a sickening feeling of<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5689-00000046"/> despair I seized it, and, hastily tearing it open, read the following:</p>

               <p>"Laura, that brief note wrought a complete change in Agnes Graham. From being one of the most confiding of human beings I became a perfect misanthrope; hating the sight of my fellow-creatures, distrusting everybody, and firmly believing there was no sincerity in the world. Years after, when the name of Eveleth was among the things of the past, I received a letter in his familiar handwriting. He was then living in Havana with his wife and child. His object in writing was to crave my forgiveness for his cruel desertion, and tell me that he had never ceased to love me and me alone. He had been infatuated with the false one, and lured on by the syren, had recklessly staked all his happiness in one fatal throw and lost. Once the husband of<pb n=""/> Lilian and the scales fell from his eyes. He saw things in their true light. He learned, when too late, that his fancied love for Lilian was but the fleeting illusion of a dream. He had now not long to live. He was dying slowly, but surely, of consumption, far away from the loved scenes of his youth, and with his dying breath he conjured me by the love I once bore him, to forgive the wrong he had done me as I hoped to be forgiven. I wrote a brief answer to his frenzied appeal granting the forgiveness he asked, but telling him nothing of the love which I still felt for him, and which through all those long dark years I had striven in vain to conquer. But this did not dispose me to look more leniently on the faults of human nature. I only felt a deeper indignation toward the woman who had wrecked the happiness of two lives, and I became more distrustful than ever.</p> 
               <p>"When you came to me, Laura, I longed to take the child of my dead sister to my heart and love her for her mother's sake, but I had learned wisdom, as I thought, by bitter experience, and I said she would prove like all the rest, and repay with falsehood and treachery the love which I lavish upon her. So I turned coldly away and would not heed your efforts to win my love. Then when you brought an Eveleth beneath my roof, <emph>her</emph> son as well as <emph>his</emph>, I thought that by some strange transformation you too would become a secret enemy, and when you came to me in your innocent frankness and entreated my permission to allow Eveleth's visits at the Lodge you well know the result. But as my health failed rapidly and I knew that I must die, the old hardness vanished and I began to question if my course in life had been a wise one, and if before God,-that God whom I should soon meet face to face in his majesty,-I had done right to withdraw myself from the world and coldly repulse<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5689-00000047"/> those who would have won my love and given me theirs in return. And I found that my life had been a failure. Oh, it is a dreadful thing to lie upon the bed of death, and learn that you have lived in vain! That instead of following the example of Him who went about doing good, that you have used all the glorious gifts with which He has endowed us to no purpose. Heaven preserve you, child of the lost Alice, from such a fate! Laura, darling, my strength is failing rapidly. I shall soon bid adieu to earth, and the places which know me now shall know me no more forever. When your eyes follow these feeble lines I shall lie in the church-yard where the ashes of my family have long reposed. I know you will not judge me harshly, but will deal leniently with my faults, for remember, if I have sinned, I have also suffered. Take my melancholy fate as a warning and pray that your life may not be as mine. Farewell, Laura. My darling, farewell forever! AGNES GRAHAM."</p> 
               <p>Tears fell from my eyes as I finished the narrative of my unfortunate relative-tears of pity for her sad fate. I did not wonder, after reading the wonderful story, that her life had been clouded by that sinful act. But though I was shocked at the duplicity and meanness there revealed, yet I would not believe the false Lilian to be the type of womanhood. It could not be. I would not have it so. I knew, I said to myself, that in this great world which God has made so gloriously beautiful, there are high and noble natures whom to know are to love and reverence. All around me are beings animated by the purest and loftiest aims, and who are animated with a desire to benefit their fellow-creatures. Has not the world brought forth martyrs who have gone, shouting, to the stake, happy that they can die in the cause of Him who<pb n=""/> gave His only begotten Son to die on the cross that we might live? Has not history given us glorious examples of what men will do and dare in the cause of truth and justice? It is rank injustice to judge the many because the few have proved unworthy-because one has been tried and found wanting. No. Come what will, I will try to preserve a firm trust in the integrity of man.</p> 
               <p>Then, as I thought of the false Lilian as the mother of Percy-my Percy-I shuddered as I thought what the son of such a mother must be; but I dismissed the thought with scorn. Percy Eveleth was all that was good and noble, and I would not wrong him by entertaining base suspicions. My dreams were strangely haunted by visions of the past. The face of Lilian St. Erme would smile down upon me, and an earnest, pleading look, would steal into the beautiful eyes, and the face assume the look of a grieved child. Then the expression would change to one of vindictive triumph until she looked like a beautiful demon, and her mocking laugh ring in my ear until I awoke with an exclamation of horror to find myself alone in the darkness and silence of midnight. Then the beautiful face of Aunt Agnes appeared to me, as I had seen it in the portrait taken in her youthful days, the dark Oriental eyes looking like clouded stars in their misty splendor and half shaded by the drooping lashes, and then the face of Walter Eveleth, so like my own Percy's, and then all seemed to float afar off into shadow-land, and I slept soundly and sweetly as an infant.</p>

               <p>The next morning I imparted to Mrs. Miller all that I had learned of Aunt Agnes' life and then questioned her concerning the portrait which I had seen in the East Wing, and what possible connection it could have with the history I had just heard. Mrs. Miller, who was delighted that all mystery was at an end, and that there was now nothing to conceal, replied, that it was a portrait of Lilian St. Erme taken after her arrival at Graham Lodge. It had formerly hung among the family portraits in the library, for Agnes had adopted her as a sister, and with the warmth of a generous nature, wished her to feel as one of the family. But on the discovery of her treachery it was veiled and removed to the apartments formerly occupied by Lilian in the East Wing, and her name was never again mentioned in the family.</p> 
               <p>As I had never been in that part of the house I visited the apartments with Mrs. Miller after breakfast. Here everything that could remind one of the false one, as well as the recreant Walter Eveleth, had been carried. The apartments had been kept in good order by the housekeeper, no one else being admitted to them, and I gazed in wonder and admiration upon the richness and beauty of the furniture and<pb n=""/> the exquisite taste of the arrangements. Here was a fairy boudoir where everything that wealth could procure or an ingenious taste devise to add to the comfort of its occupant, was scattered in lavish profusion. Rose-colored curtains draped the windows, casting a rich light over the room. A beautiful guitar lay in one corner, and, as I thought of the jeweled fingers which had swept its strings on those memorable evenings when Aunt Agnes sat by the bedside of her invalid father, tears of pity filled my eyes for the lonely Agnes. All around were mementos of those who were gone. On a center-table were volumes of choice poetry which the lovers had conned together before the false one had appeared to mar their happiness, and upon the blank page of each was written, in a bold masculine hand, "To my beloved Agnes."</p> 
               <p>Upon a little bijou of a table lay a jeweled locket, and upon opening it, the very counterpart of the face of Percy Eveleth smiled upon me. Yes, there were the same dark eyes, the clustering rings of raven hair which I had so admired, and the same sweet smile hovering round the perfect mouth.</p> 
               <p>I drew a sigh of relief. Thank heaven! Percy Eveleth resembled his father, and there was not a feature, an expression of that handsome face, nor movement of the graceful form, to recall the memory of the hateful Lilian. I could bear to know my Percy was like his father, whose only fault had been in listening to the syren voice that lured him on till love, Agnes, honor, all were alike forgotten. I could bear to think of Percy as the son of Walter Eveleth, but of the false-hearted Lilian, <emph>never</emph>!</p> 
               <p>I turned with a feeling of strong disgust as my eye fell upon the portrait, which was now unveiled, and I thought<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5689-00000049"/> Aunt Agnes must be right, there could be little truth in the world if all were like Lilian St. Erme, and that it was right in her to withdraw from a world where she had experienced so much misery-where she could only be contaminated by the evil influence of others. But while I was thinking thus, these words, which I had read somewhere in a little book designed for the young, but which had in it many a lesson for older minds, stole, like an accusing spirit, into my mind:</p> 
               <p>"Our Creator has so constituted us that none can live unto himself, and if the attempt be made it is sure to result in unhappiness. When the flower folds its petals closely around its heart, refusing to give out bright colors and sweet odors, mildew and blight gather upon it and it soon withers without fulfilling the object of its creation. From the very nature of things no true happiness can be derived from self and selfish purposes."</p> 
               <p>Yes, this must be true. We should try and follow the example of the meek and lowly Jesus, and live "not for ourselves alone." After much thought upon the subject, I decided that after the period of mourning had expired I would seek the society of the refined and intellectual. I would fill my stately home with the brilliant society of the metropolis. I felt, too, a thrill of joy in knowing that I could welcome to its halls Percy Eveleth, my affianced husband, and feel that in so doing I was not violating the wishes of the dead. Aunt Agnes had taken back the words that had banished him, and now I could sit and dream of the blissful future without one guilty pang as I thought of his visits becoming known. But as I thought of the future, a strange fear stole into my mind, making me more and more miserable. It had been some time since I had heard<pb n=""/> from Percy, and after my mind had somewhat recovered from the shock of Aunt Agnes' death, I had felt a vague uneasiness about his strange silence, and as the weeks went by and I saw nothing of him I grew more and more alarmed, wondering why he had not called at the Lodge, or at least, if that were impossible, send me some message, if only a word, to show me that I was not forgotten.</p> 
               <p>It was now the last of October. The trees were brilliant in their autumn dress, flaunting their leaves of crimson and purple and gold in every direction, giving an air of cheerfulness to the gray old Lodge, while the woods, amid whose leafy bowers I had spent so many happy hours in his company, were dyed in purple, and amber, and scarlet, and with the rich sunset lingering lovingly upon them were bathed in a flood of glory. As the days passed I watched them with a feeling of sadness as one by one the little fluttering leaves, in their glowing beauty, fluttered and fell to the ground. But they fell silently, and while I watched them the days flew swiftly by, and. still he came not. At last even I, loving as I had loved, trusting as I had trusted, yielded to the suspicions which were filling my mind-suspicions that my lover was false. The thought was agony, but all too soon came the dreadful proof.</p> 
               <p>It was a mild day in the Indian Summer. There was a pensive beauty in the autumn landscape and a soothing power in the soft hazy atmosphere that calmed my troubled spirit as I stood at the window and listened to the Sabbath bells. I had been so lonely since Aunt Agnes' death that I longed to be out in the mellow sunlight again, and telling Mrs. Miller that I would not wait for the carriage, I went to my room, and making a hasty toilet, started for church in spite of Mrs. Miller's remonstrances against my taking so<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5689-00000050"/> long a walk. The bell was tolling when I entered the family pew which the Grahams had occupied from time immemorial, and as I gazed upon the cushions where my mother had knelt, in her innocent girlhood, by the side of the proud, beautiful Agnes, both now in heaven, great tears welled into my eyes, and the wish rose up in my heart that I, too, had been taken with my last earthly friend. With my mind filled with melancholy thoughts I did not notice the entrance of strangers until an excited whispering and turning of heads, and the rustle of silken robes caused me to raise my eyes in time to see three persons enter the seat before me. The first was a lady somewhat advanced in years, but still beautiful, of the blonde type of beauty. The other was considerably younger, a dark, sparkling brunette, petite and slender, richly dressed as a bride, while beside her was Percy Eveleth-my Percy, as I had once fondly hoped to call him. I became nearly stupefied with grief and horror at this proof of what I had begun to suspect, namely, the perfidy of him who had pledged himself to me. The pealing of the organ joined to the pure voices of the singers, fell on my ear as if to mock my agony-then the gaze of Eveleth, wandering over the house, felt upon my face. He turned deathly pale, and quickly averted his eyes. I leaned forward upon the cushions, and pressed my cold hands to my throbbing temples. I was conscious only of a feeling of oppression and a desire to escape from the house, and, mechanically obeying the impulse, I arose and hastily left the church and knew nothing more until I found myself prostrate upon Aunt Agnes' grave. It seemed an age-it might have been an hour that I lay there shedding no tears, but quivering like a leaf shaken by the wind, uttering only dry, gasping sobs, when a clear, ringing laugh<pb n=""/> in my ear startled me from my recumbent position, and hastily rising I encountered the scornful gaze of Percy Eveleth's mother. I knew her now, though when I had looked upon her before that morning I had tried in vain to recall her countenance. Now I recognized her in the silence that followed, as we stood face to face, regarding each other with no common interest. My face must have shown how fearfully I had suffered. It certainly must have done so had it been a faithful index to my mind, for it seemed to me that years of suffering had passed over my head since m morning. Again that mocking laugh rang out in the Sabbath stillness, and with the slightest possible inclination of the head as she met my glance, she spoke,-</p> 
               <p>"Miss Clifford, I presume, I have the honor of addressing?"</p> 
               <p>Something in the woman's voice, in the cool, polished accents, glinting like sharpened steel into my frozen heart, roused the slumbering pride of my nature, and crushing back the weight of misery that all the time lay heavily upon my heart, and which I felt in my despair I was to bear through life, I returned her bow with one as haughty and contemptuous as her own. She noticed the change, and my <choice>
                     <sic>imperiou</sic>
                     <corr>imperious</corr>
                  </choice> manner seemed to anger her, for a lurid light flamed into the eyes that a moment before had appeared so unreadable, but now kindled into sudden anger, but her voice was still coldly sarcastic as she said,</p> 
               <p>"I should have known you anywhere by your remarkable resemblance to Agnes Graham. Yes," she added musingly, "that look was the same as that which overspread her face when I accused her of treachery in winning the love of Carl Wayne. Ah! was I not revenged?"</p> 
               <p>And again the laugh which I had before heard fairly<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5689-00000051"/> curdled the blood in my veins. She again suddenly asked, "Do you know who the lady and gentleman were who accompanied me to the church?"</p> 
               <p>Stung by her manner more than her words, and resolved to conceal as much as possible the anguish I suffered, I replied calmly,</p> 
               <p>"You allude to your son and his bride."</p> 
               <p>"Right," she responded, still searching my countenance to detect some trace of emotion, and then added maliciously, "I might have omitted to ask you concerning the gentleman, for Laura Clifford who, until this morning, fondly believed she was destined to occupy that enviable position, might justly consider it an absurd question for his mother to ask her."</p> 
               <p>So she knew the secret I had so carefully guarded, even from Aunt Agnes. She could have gained her information from but one source, Percy-and overcome by the thought that I had been the subject of remark, I sank upon a rustic seat by the grave of her whose happiness had been so fearfully wrecked by this fiend in human form, and, burying my face in my hands, burst into a passionate flood of tears. So absorbed was I in my grief that I did not heed the words that she uttered until a sudden feeling of mortification that I had not been able to control my feelings throughout the trying scene, swept over me, and hastily rising and brushing the damp curls from my tear-stained face, I bade her begone-to leave the grave of her whom she had so cruelly wronged, and not intrude her unwelcome presence upon me again. The suddenness of my action astonished her and she listened in silence until I had finished, then throwing her baleful glance full upon me she said,-</p> 
               <p>"You have spoken wisely-my revenge is complete-why<pb n=""/> should I linger here? I have humbled the last of the Grahams into the very dust at my feet. I have triumphed over her who once treated me with contemptuous pity, and now above the sod where she lies buried, I fill out the measure of my hatred for one <emph>she</emph> loved-another Agnes Graham whom I have crushed as relentlessly as I did the first." Then coming a step nearer, while I recoiled from her as I would from a serpent, she added:</p> 
               <p>"I leave you now, Laura Clifford, to your fate to follow in the footsteps of your predecessor, to live as she lived and die as she died, unloved in life and unlamented in death."</p> 
               <p>It seemed as if she had pronounced my doom, standing there regarding me with gleaming eyes and face livid with passion, and as she turned and left me I sank senseless to the earth. When I awoke to consciousness I was being driven rapidly in the direction of Graham Lodge, while Mrs. Miller held me in her arms applying restoratives and smoothing back the hair from my damp forehead with all a mother's fondness and solicitude. But all her fond care could not alleviate my suffering, and though I rallied my waning strength and strove to <emph>forget</emph>, to banish all thoughts of Percy Eveleth from my mind, yet I strove in vain. I loved him still.</p> 
               <p>The Autumn passed slowly. I avoided even Mrs. Miller, and I passed my time in solitude and alone with my misery. It was a beautiful evening in the mild Indian summer as I sat by the window of the room which had been formerly occupied by Aunt Agnes. I could see the lights in the village gleaming through the foliage, and now and then a pedestrian hurrying along in that direction passed the house. The moonlight fell upon the spire of the little church, and I knew it rested lovingly upon the graves of my kindred. I<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5689-00000052"/> felt so weary of life that I longed to die and be laid beside them. Life to me was a burden. There was not one tie to bind me to earth, and at times it seemed to me if it had not been for a dread of a hereafter I should have been tempted to have <choice>
                     <sic>sough trest</sic>
                     <corr>sought rest</corr>
                  </choice> and forgetfulness in death. Now, as I sat and listened, I could hear the sullen roar of the river as a breeze swept up from the waters, seeming to bear upon its wings a promise of Oblivion. I shuddered at the thought of such a death-the death of the suicide-and turned resolutely away from the contemplation of the subject. No; I would not be so weak. I would try to meet bravely the vicissitudes of fortune, knowing that it was <emph>His</emph> hand that sent affliction, and bow to the chastening rod. I was turning from the window when the loud rumbling of a carriage arrested my attention, becoming each moment louder and rapidly approaching the Lodge. At this moment a loud call for help was heard, and the next moment a carriage emerged from the gloom drawn by two powerful horses, rushing with headlong speed down the road until just in front of the house the carriage came into collision with some object and its occupants were precipitated upon the ground. There was a piercing shriek, then a deep groan, and all was still. Shivering with horror and excitement, I still retained presence of mind sufficient to summon a servant and order him to go to the assistance of the strangers, and if injured, bring them into the house. In a few moments there was a sound of footsteps, and the form of a woman was borne in and placed upon the sofa in the drawing-room. She was young and beautiful. Her hair had escaped from its confinement and hung in rippling, wavy masses about the marble countenance. The eyelids drooped heavily and the dark lashes swept the waxen cheeks. Mrs. Miller was already applying<pb n=""/> restoratives when I went to her assistance, and she assured me confidently that it was only a fainting fit resulting from fright, and that she was otherwise uninjured, and while she was speaking a quiver ran through the girl's slight frame, and then a long drawn sigh parted the beautiful lips, and the dark eyes slowly opened and fastened themselves on my face. There was something familiar in their dusky depths, and I became spell-bound beneath their gaze trying to remember where I had met her before. Suddenly the truth flashed across my mind. I had indeed seen that face before when it had gleamed upon me from out the sombre gloom of the old church. Then the hair was parted in smooth bands away from the white forehead and a snowy bridal bonnet contrasted with its midnight blackness. Yes it was the face of Percy Eveleth's bride that I now looked upon lying white and drooping among the crimson velvet cushions at Graham Lodge.</p> 
               <p>God help me! A deadly faintness came over me as I gazed upon the face of my successful rival. Then a feeling of deep hatred filled my heart and a longing for revenge stole over me so strong and powerful that it deprived me for the moment of reason. Her protracted gaze maddened me. I drew nearer with hands clenched in mortal agony. I was wild with grief and realized nothing but that she had wronged me. I did not stop to question if she had done it unconsciously; only a mad desire for revenge burned with fever heat in my veins. Not one gleam of pity filled my soul as I looked upon her helplessness, nor wish to guard the life so strangely committed to my care. I regarded her so fixedly that she turned uneasily-then her eyes grew more intensely black and seemed to dilate with terror. I thought it was from fear of me, and I gloated over it in my frenzy for<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5689-00000053"/> it seemed to me that she must know my thoughts, but as my glance followed the direction of her eyes I, too, became transfixed with horror. Through one of the long French windows, their forms boldly outlined against the moonlit sky, appeared two of the servants bearing in their arms the form of a man which they laid at full length among the crimson roses of the carpet. There were wounds from which the blood was slowly oozing, and I knew the moment my eyes rested upon that countenance, glorious even in that death trance, that Percy Eveleth had been brought beneath my roof to <emph>die</emph>. That thought restored me. I was myself again, and casting one glance upon <emph>his</emph> wife, now again insensible, I knelt by the still figure and pressed passionate kisses upon the upturned brow and the limp, listless hand which I had taken in mine. He was <emph>mine in death</emph>. I felt a thrill of exultation in knowing that to <emph>me</emph> was given the precious privilege of ministering to the wants of him to whom I had given such heart-worship in the past, and I could not repress a feeling of pity as I saw them lift the silent figure from the sofa, still in a state of insensibility, and carry it to the room above. I was calm now. My fit of insanity had passed away, and I shuddered as I thought of what people had done in many a similar mood.</p> 
               <p>At length the dark eyes of Percy unclosed and sought my face. A look of eager joy flashed into them as he recognized e, and he murmured feebly, "Laura, darling, is this heaven, and are you here to welcome me to eternal happiness?" I bent over him fondly, but the eagerness died out of his face and he whispered, "Oh, I recollect, there was an accident-yes! yes! I remember now-and Bertha?" He tried to raise his head but sank back exhausted-then lower-"I am dying; I shall soon be free-free to wait and welcome<pb n=""/> come you home at last, where there is no sorrow nor dying, neither is there any more pain. I will meet you there Laura, darling, my first and only love, where there is no marrying or giving in marriage, and we will together walk the gold paved streets of the celestial city." He closed his eyes languidly and I thought he had gone, but opening them again he whispered, "bury me in the churchyard, Laura, and plant the flowers we loved so well above my grave, and remember, if spirits are permitted to visit those they have loved on earth, I will watch over you, though unseen to mortal eyes. Kiss me, dear one, for the <emph>last time</emph>-farewell, darling, farewell!" and with a long, quivering sigh he was gone from this earth forever.</p> 
               <p>Tears filled my eyes, the first I had shed since the day when I learned of his marriage. I could bear to give him up to death, but not to <emph>her</emph>. I thought of the long, halcyon days of the past, when we were everything to each other, and as I looked upon the pale sleeper lying before me so beautiful in death, the memory of the past softened the grief of the present. "Laura, my first and only love;" how I blessed the words uttered by those dear lips-the lips of him who was even then standing upon the portals of an unseen world. It was some compensation for my lost happiness.</p> 
               <p>While I was still kneeling by the inanimate form, there was the sound of carriage wheels which paused before the door, then a murmur of voices, and in a moment more the mother of him who had left us entered. She gave one comprehensive glance around, seeming to take in every feature of the familiar room until her eye rested upon the form of her son, then she uttered a shriek so piercing and heart-rending that it froze the blood in my veins; she knelt beside him, uttering incoherent words of endearment to ears that were<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5689-00000054"/> deaf to all earthly sounds, and pressing kisses upon lips that gave no return. Then, when the dark eyes refused to welcome her, and the hand which she took in both her own chilled her with its icy touch, did the wretched woman know that he was indeed lost to her. It was pitiable to see her trying by every means in her power to win him back to life; but when the physician, who had been summoned, tried to draw her from his side, she hurled him from her with a strength born of the dreadful insanity which had clouded her brain and dethroned her reason <emph>forever</emph>. I had already endured so much that when this dreadful discovery was made known, a merciful Providence sealed my senses in oblivion and I knew no more of the horrors of that dreadful scene.</p>

               <p>When I awoke to consciousness, dismal November blasts were howling around my home telling me of the rapid flight of time that had borne with it all the light and joy of my existence. My first thought, as the tide of remembrance flooded my soul, was a wish that I had died ere the dreadful delirium, which had for weeks steeped my senses in oblivion, had left me, so great was my longing to be at rest. I felt so weak and ill-fitted to take my place once more among those scenes which spoke so eloquently of departed joys. Then, as the days dragged slowly by and I lay ill and suffering, with no one but menials to minister to my wants, I grew hardened and wicked. I said to myself, I will follow the example of Aunt Agnes, and withdraw from the world where there is no happiness to be found. I had been very ill since that terrible night. My soul had trembled on the confines of eternity-but I had been saved for what? I asked myself the question and it echoed drearily back-saved for what? I could not feel thankful for the gift of life. I was like many another suffering one, with a faith too weak to leave<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5689-00000055"/> the future in God's hands, trusting Him. I rose up from that sick bed hardened, resolved in the future to lead a very hermit life within the walls of Graham Lodge. So I passed all that long, dreary winter alone, with no companionship but my books, for I shunned even Mrs. Miller, for ever as I gazed upon her sweet, placid face, with its look of resignation and trust, it seemed to reprove me for my course.</p> 
               <p>Among the many relics which I found in the apartments in the East Wing, were some well-worn volumes upon infidelity. I shuddered as if in the presence of evil when I first beheld them, and turned away no longer wondering that her who chose them for her guide had proved recreant to the trust reposed in her, but in the oppressive stillness of the house, when my heart grew sick in thinking of the past, there would steal upon me a desire for something to occupy my mind, which would make me forget the past. In this frame of mind I took one of the volumes in my hand one day, and sinking upon the rose-colored couch were she had so often sat in luxurious repose, I opened it and began to read, at first critically, but as I grew interested I forgot to doubt. The perusal of that book made me an infidel. I had never, during my childhood, had what might be called a religious training. Those beautiful truths of religion had never been instilled into my mind by careful parents. In the crowded boarding-school such instruction had been forgotten or considered unnecessary in preparing the pliant mind of youth for the battle of life, in fitting them to take their place in the world. So, while I received careful instruction in music, drawing, painting, and other of the interminable list with which every school-girl is familiar, my Bible lay neglected upon the table, and I only looked into it upon the Sabbath. Then the words of the sermon would<pb n=""/> follow me, and while my merry companions would be talking of the lessons for the coming week, my mind would be dwelling with awe upon our Saviour's life while upon earth, and visions of the cross where He laid down would rise with fearful distinctness to my mental view, and in imagination I could behold the divine beauty of that heavenly countenance, even with the crown of thorns upon His brow. But the picture would fade before the reality of my daily life.</p> 
               <p>A boarding-school is a miniature world in itself, and its little cares and vexations are as grievously felt as any which come to us in after life. I soon became as vain and worldly as my companions, and after I left school my life had been so different from what I had anticipated, that I forgot all my resolutions in regard to the occupations of my time; and now all the beautiful fancies in which I had indulged, faded away like bright day-dreams, and I grew cold and cynical, loving no one, trusting no one. So the winter left me as it had found me, wretched and unhappy. When the buds and blossoms of May greeted my view; when Spring, radiant in youthful beauty, again appeared, my heart gave no response to the gladness and beauty without, and as her fragrant breath floated in at the open window, freighted with the odor of May blossoms and blue-eyed violets, it brought but the remembrance of departed joys. So I turned to the darkness and gloom within, resolutely closing my heart to the sweet influences without. But with the advent of Summer came a fearful pestilence, and Death, with his sable wings, overshadowed the land, reveling in the feast prepared for him. All around were faces blanched with fear, but I stood unmoved, viewing the dread work of the destroyer with indifference. I had grown so weary of the burden of life that I would have gladly welcomed the repose of the grave. So when others fled in terror<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5689-00000056"/> from the contagion, I remained and mingled fearlessly with those ill and dying, and though I tried with the tenderest care to win them back to life, yet as I closed the dying eyes I could not but think it were better so, and almost envy them their dreamless slumber. I could but hope that the time would soon come when I should follow them. But that time never came. I seemed to have a charmed life. Good Mrs. Miller, who had in vain remonstrated with me upon my course, marveled that I had so long escaped. She thought I was alone actuated by the promptings of humanity, in seeking the homes of the sick and sorrowing. In her child-like trust she could not imagine any other motive, and I kept my own counsel. We stood together by the death-beds of unnumbered victims, and then she, too, was taken ill with the disease. Then I devoted myself wholly to the care of her, striving with almost superhuman energy to avert her threatened doom. I did not know how dear she had become to me until she was smitten down by the dire disease. I now used every effort for her recovery, and at length I had the happiness of hearing her pronounced out of danger. But she was very weak, and her recovery was so slow that I again feared for her, dreading a relapse.</p> 
               <p>The physician recommended change of air, and in pursuance of his advice I engaged a pretty cottage in the vicinity of a fashionable watering-place and removed to it, taking with me some of the servants at the Lodge, and among them Miss Nancy Redfield. She was not just the one I would have chosen, but she begged to go and promised strict obedience, and as she had proved to be such an excellent nurse, and had been indefatigable in her efforts to make Mrs. Miller comfortable that 1 consented to take her in place of Annette, my French maid, whom I left behind.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Nancy was as good as her word and proved of incalculable value to me. She made herself useful in arranging the furniture, and in her uncouth, but faithful way, made everything look as cosy and comfortable as possible in our pretty home.</p> 
               <p>We led very secluded lives and did not mingle with the throng of people who came there to pass the Summer. But when our arrival at N-- became known, many who had known Aunt Agnes called and left their cards at the cottage, and there came frequent invitations to rides, parties and excursions, all of which were kindly but firmly refused.</p> 
               <p>Soon after our arrival I learned that among the guests at one of the principal hotels was Percy Eveleth's widow. She was the reigning belle, and I used often to meet her in my walks, surrounded by companions as gay as herself. One sultry August evening I started for a lonely walk upon the beach. The -- Hotel was brilliantly lighted and strains of delicious harmony floated out upon the evening air. As I passed along a sudden wish took possession of me to mingle in those scenes of pleasure which seemed so attractive to my unaccustomed eye, but I quickly banished the desire and hurried on until the sullen roar of the waters breaking upon the beach was borne to my ear. I seated myself beneath a sheltering rock where I could listen unmolested to the anthems of the sea and watch the curling waves dash high upon the beach and break at my feet.</p> 
               <p>I had always loved the ocean even in its stormiest moods. It possessed a strange fascination for me and to-night it seemed to throw an almost <choice>

                     <corr>weird</corr>
                  </choice> spell over me as I sat and looked upon the moonlit waters. I had been sitting for perhaps an hour in deep thought when the sound of footsteps woke me from my reverie, and soon two gentlemen<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5689-00000057"/> sauntered slowly by my place of concealment and paused so near me that I could distinctly hear every word of the conversation which followed. They were both young and handsome, and I judged by their appearance were persons of wealth and influence. I did not heed their remarks till these words came distinctly to my ear:</p> 
               <p>"So you are courting the widow, Tom?" said one, a fair-faced, aristocratic looking young man, balancing his cigar between the tips of his white fingers; "You're a lucky dog, for she's rich and handsome, and any one can see that she's madly in love with you; the rest of the fellows are dying with envy, but you always did have a way of ingratiating yourself into the affections of the fair sex that I never could understand, much less imitate. Come, old fellow, tell us where the charm lies."</p> 
               <p>The other laughed a little, insincere laugh and stroked his moustache complacently some moments before replying; then he said in a tone of triumph:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I am in a fair way to win the love of Bertha Eveleth, to say nothing of her fortune, which is by no means inconsiderable, and I don't mind telling you, my dear Jack, since you are in my confidence, that the said fortune is no small item in my mind. She is a beauty though, and no mistake, and as she seems disposed to make me a present of herself and her liberal income, why I sha'nt quarrel with fate," and he closed his eyes affectedly and brushed the dark hair from his white forehead with his jeweled fingers, while his companion gazed with seeming awe upon his magnificent friend. But suddenly opening his eyes he said in a far different tone,-</p> 
               <p>"But I tell you, Jack, I'm not quite as enthusiastic about<pb n=""/> the little widow as you may imagine, since I have seen the last arrival."</p> 
               <p>The one designated as Jack looked exceedingly mystified, and bestowing a pitying glance upon him, his companion proceeded,-</p> 
               <p>"The lady to whom I refer is Miss Laura Clifford from Grahamville, who came here a few weeks ago in company with an elderly lady, a relative I suppose, and took possession of a handsome cottage a short distance from here. They live very retired, and are, I expect, very exclusive, so that I have obtained but a glimpse of the lady, but the one glance that I received from the magnetic eyes of Miss Clifford was sufficient to make a complete conquest of the not very susceptible heart of Tom Granville. Since they came I have made inquiries and learned that the lady is the sole heiress of unbounded wealth and is the mistress of a place called Graham Lodge, with miles of the richest territory around it, enough for a small principality. The Grahams, from whom she is descended, was one of the oldest and proudest families in the land and boasted a lordly title from English ancestors. She is so beautiful that before her all the other belles who have queened it here season after season, would sink into insignificance. By her side the beauty of Bertha Eveleth would pale and she would seem fairly insipid. Let me once obtain an introduction to this proud beauty and all my powers of fascination and conquest shall be brought into play. I do not doubt my success, for when did Tom Granville fail in winning a woman's heart."</p> 
               <p>"Well, by Jove, you're a cool one," the other burst forth, "to speak as lightly as you have done of the love of Bertha Eveleth, the belle of the season! Wouldn't there be a scene if she could hear you? Why, man alive, there are<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5689-00000058"/> plenty who would give all they possessed to be favored with the lady's smiles. Recollect, while you are raving about the beauty of Miss Clifford, that 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, never fear for me," was the reply, "it is not often that I indulge in such rhapsodies. Trust me to look out for my own interests. I sha'nt transfer my devotion from the fair Bertha until I find that I am likely to succeed in another direction," and humming carelessly, he turned away followed by his companion, and their forms were soon lost to view in the darkness.</p> 
               <p>When the last echo of their departing footsteps had died away in the distance, I sprang to my feet and began to pace restlessly up and down the beach. My mind was in chaos, and in the tumult of feelings that had been excited by the conversation to which I had been an unwilling, but still an eager listener, I was only conscious of a new sense of power, and my cheeks flushed with triumph as I pondered upon what I had heard. That night my resolution was taken. I would no longer avoid society, but would seek in its whirl and excitement forgetfulness and my revenge. Beauty, wealth and station; I had never realized their power until now; I had never prized them till I learned that through them and by them I could humble my haughty rival-that I could be revenged upon Bertha Eveleth.</p> 
               <p>Yes, I would triumph over her as she had triumphed over me in the days gone by; for I had learned, since the death of Percy, that she had known of his love for me, and striven to win him from one to whom he was bound in honor, and she had exulted in her success.</p> 
               <p>The next day, when the fashionable Mrs. Belden called, I received her, and as Mrs. Miller was still unequal to exertion,<pb n=""/> although quite convalescent, I promised to attend the grand ball of the season, chaperoned by that lady. When the eventful moment arrived, I stood before the mirror in my own room, gazing with proud satisfaction at the image there reflected. To-night I made my debut in fashionable society, under the most favorable auspices. The toilet I had chosen for the occasion was rich and elegant, but without conveying the idea of being over-dressed. A robe of the finest India muslin fell in fleecy folds around me. I wore no jewels, but flowers-sweet flowers were bound around my head like a coronal, and their fragrant breath swept my cheek caressingly, as if, like the child in the fairy tale, they acknowledged me as their earthly queen to rule over the flowery realm, with pale flowery spirits for my subjects.</p> 
               <p>When I entered the ball-room there was a subdued murmur of admiration, and I heard my name repeated from lip to lip with various comments, all of them most flattering to a youthful <foreign xml:lang="FRA">debutante</foreign>.</p> 
               <p>During the evening I was presented, among others, to Mr. Thomas Granville, whom I soon saw was considered a "catch" by maneuvering mammas with marriageable daughters. I knew from what I had heard of the conversation on the beach, that rumor had assigned him to Bertha Eveleth. It was part of the role I had decided upon enacting, to be very gracious to the gentleman, for I thought by the almost tenderness of her manner towards him that she had indeed given him her love, and here, I thought, was the chance for the revenge I had promised myself. Already prepossessed in my favor, I saw that the conquest of Mr. Granville's heart would be an easy task-nor was I mistaken. That gentleman was very attentive during the evening, seeming to take courage by the graciousness of my manner, and after it was all over Mrs.<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5689-00000059"/> Belden said, all in a quiver of delight, at parting, "It was a perfect success, my dear; and you may justly be proud of the attention and admiration excited by your beauty. You have outshone all the others and thrown even Bertha Eveleth, hitherto the acknowledged 'queen of hearts,' completely into the shade."</p> 
               <p>I could not have been a woman and not felt flattered by this language, though something seemed to whisper that if Laura Clifford had been divested of the golden charms that had been ascribed to her, mere beauty of form and feature would not have been sufficient to have retained the dear "five hundred friends" by whom I now found myself surrounded. Invitations poured in rapidly after the ball, and I found myself fairly launched into fashionable society. At my earnest solicitation, Mrs. Miller, who had now fully recovered from her recent illness, began to mingle more with the gay society at N--, and I was pleased to see the good lady welcomed and appreciated as her merits deserved.</p>

               <p>The days flew quickly to one unaccustomed as I had been to the excitement of fashionable life. We had hardly a moment to ourselves. The cottage was thronged with visitors at all hours of the day. Among those who were most assiduous in their attentions, was Mr. Granville, and as I encouraged them for the reasons I have before given, it came to be generally talked at -- Hotel, and various were the comments upon the fact of my having eclipsed one who had hitherto reigned supreme. There were times when I almost pitied my rival, she seemed so crushed and humiliated. She could not, I knew, fail to hear the remarks which were made freely by the habitues of the house, and knowing also her great pride, I sometimes almost regretted the course I had taken. Then came the thought of Eveleth and all I had suffered, and if I faltered it was only to gain renewed strength and energy to effect my purpose. It might have been unwomanly-I know it was wicked, but let another suffer as I had suffered and see if they would not do likewise. If Bertha had loved Percy Eveleth and had won him fairly from me, and he had given her his love in return, I would have been silent. I<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5689-00000060"/> would have suffered "but gave no sign." But as she had had no mercy, so would I prove merciless. The long August days wore away, and though I was fearfully interested in the success of my plans, yet when away from under the watchful eyes of Bertha, those eyes that seemed never to slumber, but sought mine always with their baleful glance, my interest would flag.</p> 
               <p>I was troubled about the issue of the affair. I could not still the remorseful whispers that filled my soul when I thought of the heart I had won to be cast away lightly. I was not quite world-hardened, and I could not think calmly of the suffering I knew my hand was preparing for one whose only fault consisted in loving me too well. I knew that Mr. Granville was seeking an opportunity of making me a formal declaration of the love he had evinced for me in a thousand nameless ways. I dreaded it, and though I could not avert the trial, yet, coward that I was, I put off the dread ordeal, trying in vain to summon the requisite amount of courage to meet it.</p> 
               <p>I had learned to value and respect the young man as he deserved, for aside from his vanity and affectation, which was the result of a false system of education, I knew him to possess excellent qualities of mind and heart, and talents that, had fate withholden from him the wealth of which she had been so lavish, might have made him something more than a mere man of fashion.</p> 
               <p>Nature had not made me a coquette, and knowing his love for me I sometimes almost decided to accept his hand. It might make some atonement for my past folly and wickedness. I would, I thought, inspire him with a worthy ambition to achieve noble deeds-for I knew that underneath that careless, graceful manner was a will to do and to dare, which,<pb n=""/> directed in a proper channel, would make him a blessing to his fellow-creatures. But I could not return his love. My heart was buried in the grave of the dead Percy-I must not think of it-it would be a sin.</p> 
               <p>That evening, as I was walking alone in the garden, thinking as calmly as possible of the future which looked so dreary as I contemplated it, there came a quick, manly step behind me, and a well-known voice pronounced my name. I knew that the hour of trial had come and nerved myself to meet it.</p> 
               <p>"Miss Clifford-Laura," murmured the low voice, "you cannot be ignorant of the cause of my having sought you here to-night. Does not your heart tell you the reason? Dearest, I love you. I have been tortured with suspense. Sometimes I have thought that you were almost mine, and then you have seemed to drift far away from me. I cannot longer endure uncertainty. Laura, dear Laura, will you be my wife?"</p> 
               <p>We had reached a vine-covered arbor, and seeing that I trembled with agitation, he led me to a seat and sank upon his knees before me. There was a world of passionate entreaty in the beautiful eyes upturned to mine, and as the moonlight fell full upon the face before me, I could see the anxious pleading that had quivered in the rich voice. I turned heart-sick, but summoning all my resolution, I bade him rise, for it was in vain. I did not love him-I could never be his wife; and in palliation of my conduct, and feeling that it was also due him, I told him all the wretched past-the dark, dreary, sinful past. When I had finished, he rose up white and still and stood before me, and from the rigid lips came in changed hollow tones:</p> 
               <p>"Laura Clifford, may God forgive you for having trifled<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5689-00000061"/> with my love. I know that I am far from perfect, that my life, short as it is, has in it many dark memories-hours of sin and consequent suffering; but I loved you truly, deeply, with a fervor of which you have no conception, and for which you would not give me credit. I do not reproach you-I only pity and love you-but I know now that my love is in vain-that it can have no return. I must leave you now; God bless you, Laura Clifford, and keep you in his holy keeping. I cannot say farewell, but I will tell you a last good night on earth. In the light of that morn of Eternity we shall meet again-there before the great white throne, and we may dwell together where 'there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage.' Laura, your companionship has made me better and purer, and my deep love has lifted my heart in thankfulness to the Giver of all good; my grief will only draw me nearer to Him who 'pitieth like as a father pitieth his children.' Trusting we shall meet again in 'the morning,' I bid you a last good night!"</p> 
               <p>He was gone. Only the calm-browed moon and the holy stars witnessed my humiliation and regret, or heard the murmured prayer for forgiveness. The night breeze seemed to echo a good night, and the rustling leaves bent to catch the murmur of the waters, over whose crested billows seemed to steal a mocking good night. I never saw Mr. Granville again. He left the next morning on an early train for the West. A few days after, Mrs. Miller returned to Graham Lodge, and after a few week's travel through New England I accompanied Mrs. Belden to New York to remain until the ensuing Spring.</p>

               <p>The life which now opened before me gave promise of being, if possible, gayer than anything I had before experienced. Mrs. Belden was an acknowledged leader of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ton</foreign>, and prided herself especially upon her patronage of genius-her appreciation and encouragement of talent. Foreign artists, literary celebrities, politicians, popular preachers, and all <emph>lions</emph> were feted and caressed by the hospitable lady, and her reunions, soirees, receptions, etc., were attended by the very <foreign xml:lang="FRA">creme de la creme</foreign> of the aristocratic people, constituting the upper-ten-dom of the metropolis.</p> 
               <p>Nothing delighted the good lady more than having a young lady under her especial charge, for she was an inveterate match-maker, and having no daughters of her own, had taken successively all those of her relations who were less favored than herself, and procured for them eligible matches, until the supply was exhausted. She had planned for me a season filled with conquest to be crowned at the close with a brilliant wedding, on a scale of more than usual magnificence. She<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5689-00000062"/> confessed herself somewhat puzzled, however, at my rejection of Mr. Granville, whom she declared was unexceptionable. But when I laughed and called it only a flirtation, she seemed satisfied that my affections were not, as she had feared, already engaged. An heiress, and descendant of one of the proudest families in the land, my society would have been sought had I possessed in addition, neither "beauty, wit nor manners." Realizing this, and being no novice in the depravity of the world, I felt a supreme contempt for the be-whiskered dandies who fluttered around me like moths round a candle, and coolly rejected one after another as they offered themselves, to Mrs. Belden's infinite surprise and annoyance. But among the many habitues of the house was a dark, handsome gentleman, whose calm, assured manner and perfect indifference to the attractions of the fair sex first arrested my attention. I used often to watch him furtively, and he became a perfect enigma to me. He was young-he could not have been thirty years of age, with midnight eyes and glossy, purple-black hair, regular, aristocratic features revealing pride and an indomitable will, and a smile rare as it was sweet, that lit up his face like a sun-burst, making it one of incomparable beauty. His name was Southbank-Roderic Southbank-and, as I repeated it to myself watching him one evening as he leaned in an attitude of careless grace against the marble mantel, with a look of weariness and unrest in the splendid eyes, I asked myself why it was, when I looked at him, that I seemed to be recalling some once familiar, but long forgotten face among the many shrouded in gloom and twilight, in the dusk aisles of memory. The name, that too, seemed familiar-where had I heard it? Ah! it flashed across my brain. In the story Mrs. Miller had told me, Rupert Southbank had lured, by the false beacon of his<pb n=""/> passion, the hopes and faith of two loving, trusting souls and wrecked their earthly happiness.</p> 
               <p>I scanned closely the unreadable features. He certainly bore a resemblance to Mrs. Miller's description of her persecutor. And then the name-I knew it was not the same. The years that had bowed the form of the once beautiful Amy Leonard, and threaded her hair with silver, had not dealt less relentlessly with her old time enemy. But it must be some relative-perhaps a son. I shuddered perceptibly, and the still figure by the mantel raised his superb eyes and fastened them on my face. They seemed to be reading my inmost thoughts, and I felt the warm blood crimson my cheeks, but the steady gaze fascinated me and riveted mine, like the charmed bird in the fatal power of the serpent, which fascinates but to destroy. The mesmeric eyes chained mine captive until with a quiet smile, the gentleman turned away, and I stood like one suddenly awakened, trying to collect my thoughts.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly a voice near me said, "Allow me-Mr. Southbank-Miss Clifford," and looking up I again encountered the midnight orbs fastened upon my face. A few moments later and I sat an entranced listener to the musical voice which spoke in low tones to my ear. And this was the commencement of our acquaintance. After this, Mr. Southbank came often to Belden Place, and Mrs. Belden looked on, complacently congratulating me upon my conquest, as she termed it. "Mr. Southbank will be an excellent match, Laura," she said; "handsome, rich and agreeable, with talents that will procure for him the highest honors of his profession, and perhaps, eventually, a position at Washington in the council halls of the nation. He is just the one for you, dear. All the <choice>

True, there has been some rather ugly stories afloat about him, but you know men of wealth cannot be expected to be above the follies and weaknesses of mankind; we do not look for them to carry themselves like mere plodding money-getters. There is great allowance to be made for him-no mother nor sisters, and so fastidious that he could never before find a wife to suit him-quite a compliment to you, dear," (tapping my cheek familiarly,) "and we can forgive the youthful indiscretions of a man, such as Roderic Southbank gives promise of becoming."</p> 
               <p>I was not sufficiently curious to question what might be the youthful indiscretions to which Mrs. Belden had alluded, and though I had learned to look for and welcome the gentleman's visits, yet I was not quite so proud nor so sure of the conquest Mrs. Belden had thus early congratulated me upon having achieved. Of one thing I was certain, whatever his intentions might be concerning myself I could never look upon Roderic Southbank as a lover-at some future time to be my husband. True, I was fascinated, felt drawn toward him as it were by some invisible power, yet when alone and away from the influence of the mesmeric eyes, it seemed to me more the attraction of repulsion that drew me so constantly to his side. Therefore I did not care to investigate further in regard to his antecedents and character than what I already knew. Still, the time passed agreeably to me and I was happier than I had ever dared to hope that I would be again. Time, that brings a healing balm to every wounded heart, had softened my grief and sorrow for the past, and hope whispered there might yet be something of happiness in life even for me.</p> 
               <p>I sometimes felt homesick and longed to behold the dear,<pb n=""/> familiar face of Mrs. Miller, my more than mother, but the long letters that came weekly from the good lady somewhat recompensed me for the loss of her society. She was well and very busy. The Winter was an unusually severe one, and the poor of Grahamville were to be fed and clothed by the benevolent people who could bring time and money for their assistance. Mrs. Miller actively endorsed all measures tending to relieve the necessities of the unfortunate and afflicted, and when I had finished one of her long letters filled with descriptions of her daily life and some of the more interesting of the numerous objects of her care, a still, small voice seemed to whisper, that was the only true way to live. Was I mistaken? Could I be groping in the blackness and darkness that threatened to engulf me forever unaware of danger? The Bible had been the guide of my mother; she had early acknowledged its divine precepts and striven to follow them. Would that I too could believe with her childlike faith. One had said in that Word, "I am the way, the truth and the life." If that Book was true-if there was a God-then I, as an accountable being, was following a way that led far from Him, down, down into endless misery. I felt strangely troubled-my awakened conscience gave me no rest. Ah! had I but listened to its warning voice, what peace would have filled my soul! But while the angel troubled the waters, the tempter again appeared to me.</p> 
               <p>Roderic Southbank was an infidel. He saw my scarce concealed misery and questioned me as to its cause. Mechanically seeming but to obey a will more powerful-that had striven and mastered mine, I told him all that was in my mind. He laughed away my fears, and strengthened by<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5689-00000064"/> his arguments I too at last admitted them to be idle; said they were weak and womanish.</p> 
               <p>A few days later, Nancy, who had insisted on following me to New York "to take care o' me," as she asserted, answered the bell of my dressing-room with an unusual amount of gravity upon her good-natured face. I questioned her as to its cause, and having, as I had supposed, only waited for permission to speak, burst forth:</p> 
               <p>"I declare, Miss Laura, I'm clar beat out when I see so much want an' wickedness as there is in this great city. Glad am I that I sha'nt have to live here always; that I'm a sojourner among strangers so to speak, for I'm certain I should go into a decline and die out o' pure sympathy for my sufferin' feller mortals."</p> 
               <p>I thought as I glanced at the girl's buxom figure, that she did not seem to be in immediate danger of such a result and that she could probably dwell there some time with impunity, but I wisely controlled my risibles and kept silent. She continued:</p> 
               <p>"A few days ago the butler," and here Nancy's face became suffused with scarlet, "told me one of the sorrowfulest stories I ever heard. Sez he, 'A good while ago there used to come to Belden Place a young girl as sweet and nice behaved as your young lady. The mistress hired her to do fine sewin', and she used often to come with bundles of work and ask to see Mrs. Belden. Then all of a sudden she stopped, an' I didn't hear anything more of her. I thought often I'd kinder like to know what had become of her, for I hadn't forgot how perlite she used to be and how she'd say "good morning James," in her sweet pretty voice. I kept wonderin' about her, for I couldn't help thinking how I'd feel if a sister of mine had to go out in all kinds of<pb n=""/> weather and work so hard, and she all the while so kind o' delicate like, an' one day I made bold to ask Mrs. Belden about her. The mistress drew herself up an' looked real sharp at me, "an'," sez she, "James, I hope you don't know anything about this Dora Lansing. I have every reason to believe she has proved unworthy of my trust and confidence." I told her I had only inquired because I feared some harm might have come to her, for though I was only a poor servant with a mother an' a little sister to support I thought I might help her in some way. The mistress winced a little at this, "an'," sez she, "well, James, I am glad to find you are actuated by such good motives, but you need not trouble yourself about her. She might have <choice>
                     <sic>fonnd</sic>
                     <corr>found</corr>
                  </choice> friends who would have helped her to gain an honest living, but she proved ungrateful and followed her own course. I trust I am ever willing to help the really needy, but, of course, I can do nothing for a wretched creature like Dora." I thought then the mistress must be right and forgot all about it, until long after I met the girl, looking so changed I hardly knew her. I stopped an' spoke to her, an' though the tears came into her brown eyes, she brightened up amazingly-says she, "Oh James, it's a long time since I've had anybody speak a kind word to me." I could'nt keep the tears out o' my own eyes, and I told her I would be a friend to her if she had no other. She might have gone wrong, but any one could see she wasn't hardened. I had a mother an' sister, an' I never see any one buffetin' the storms of the world but I thought of them. I asked her where she lived an' she told me in an alley in the fourth story of an old tenement house. She supported herself an' little baby by takin' in slop-work from the shops. She tried to earn an honest livin', an', she said, with the tears rollin' down her pale<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5689-00000065"/> checks, "Oh, James, God knows it wasn't willful wrong; I've been more sinned against than sinning." I told her I believed that, every word of it, and her life proved its truth. I promised to call on her, and left feelin' down hearted enough I can tell you.' And," continued Nancy, great sobs welling up as she spoke, "he did go an' see her, an' when the baby was taken sick an' died, he told me about it, an' though I say it as should'nt say it, we've stood by her through thick an' thin till now. I did'nt want to trouble you, Miss Laura, who have had trouble enough already, but the child's loss seemed to have a bad effect, an' she's took to her bed since then. I'm only a poor, awkward country girl, an' though I mean well, I know I ain't no 'count in a sick room, an' she's a real lady if she is poor, an' has done wrong. I thought if I told you, you might go an' see her an' comfort her like, an' talk to her as I know she needs. It ain't money she wants; James an' I have seen to all that," said Nancy, with an air of pardonable pride, "but its a comfortin' word from somebody like yourself, an' some one to tell her if she's taken one wrong step she ain't lost forever. I ain't the one to encourage wickedness, but I know the blessed Saviour told the sinning Magdalene 'go and sin no more,' an' I could'nt ask a better example."</p> 
               <p>Nancy's eyes rested upon my face, studying the effect of her narration, and when I promised to visit her protege, she caught my hand and covered it with kisses. The exhibition of deep feeling and charity manifested by this rude, uncultured girl, brought the tears to my eyes, and after she had left me to silence and my thoughts, I could not help contrasting her native goodness with the depravity of others more favored.</p> 
               <p>On the occasion of Nancy's next visit to Dora Lansing I<pb n=""/> accompanied her, and after ascending innumerable flights of stairs found myself in a small, meanly furnished room, in that part of the city occupied by the very poorest classes. Upon a couch, made more nearly approaching comfort than anything in the room by the hands of the indefatigable Nancy, lay a pale, spiritual creature, with such an expression of patient resignation in the brown eyes and around the sensitive mouth, as was painful to look upon. Her pale cheek flushed slightly as I approached, but the voice in which she responded to my greeting was sweet and low, but with a quiver of sadness my ear at once detected. Poor child; poor crushed little blossom. Somebody's darling; perhaps once the light and joy of fond parents-their only hope; must this star set in the darkness of eternal night as others had, just from one wrong step? With a feeling of deep, yearning pity stirring my heart-depths, I sat down by the bedside, and taking the thin, white hands in mine, told her I had heard from Nancy all of her history that it was necessary for me to know. She need not cause herself needless pain by a narration of past sufferings. I knew that she was a wronged woman, and believing her to be innocent of premeditated guilt, I had come to offer my sympathy and aid. I felt my own inability to help her-I could not point her to a future that another would have told her was freighted with promises of eternal happiness for the faithful. I had had no sure support in my own affliction. I could not believe. I had not faith in One powerful to save. I had no rock of ages to lean upon; I gave her my sympathy, and that was all I could do. That was enough, and I left that bedside better, I trust, for having tried to help a struggling fellow-creature. I was conscious of having given pleasure, and in the effort I had realized a pure, exquisite happiness. Let those who draw themselves<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5689-00000066"/> up in scorn, and hold their garments aside from contact with crime and misery, as if fearful of contamination, remember that in the Book they profess to choose as their guide through the labyrinthine mazes of life, it is written, "Lead us not into temptation," and again, "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." I looked at the fair, sweet face of Dora Lansing, lying white as the pillow upon which her head reposed, and vowed to help her as I would a sister, if I had had one, to lead a better life.</p>

               <p>It was late one stormy December evening. The weather precluded all possibility of going out, and, as we thought, of having calls, and as this was something unusual for the inmates of Belden Place, I felt a keen sense of enjoyment in the anticipation of a quiet evening, but hardly had I taken up the new book that lay so temptingly before me with its leaves yet uncut, than there was a ring at the street door, and soon after a servant entered and handed me a card bearing the name of Roderic Southbank. With mingled feelings of regret and pleasure I descended to the drawing-room. Mrs. Belden had retired with a headache, Mr. Belden was deeply immersed in the commercial column of the evening paper, and upon me devolved the duty of entertaining the visitor. I thought he looked rather pleased than otherwise when I presented Mrs. Belden's excuses, but he made no comment other than to apologize for his calling upon such an evening, but remarked, "fortune favors the brave," and I am already sufficiently rewarded by a glimpse of Paradise. A sudden, undefined feeling of dread thrilled through me for an instant, and to relieve myself of a slight feeling of embarrassment, I<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5689-00000067"/> hastened to accede to his request for music. He followed me to the piano, and turned my music while I sang for him his favorite songs. Then when the last note died away, a hand, white and tapering as a woman's imprisoned mine, and a voice low, but full of passion, murmured in my ear, "Laura, Laura Clifford, <emph>I love you</emph>!" I started and turned to meet the midnight eyes bent full upon my face; then before I could collect my thoughts, he caught me in his arms and covered my face with burning, passionate kisses.</p> 
               <p>"Beautiful creature," whispered the voice, "you are mine-it is your fate; why struggle to escape it? Angel, I never truly loved till I met you. The star of my destiny has set; you shall be my wife."</p> 
               <p>I shivered with fear and dread, and strove to escape, but the strong arms held me fast, and feeling as if some fearful doom hung over me, I sank away and knew no more. When consciousness again returned, Nancy was chafing my hands with fierce energy, and a voice said, "She is recovering; the room was too warm-she will be better in a moment." That roused me. I rose up and drank the water Mr. Southbank handed me without looking at him, and said, "Yes it was too warm, and I was fatigued with the long walk I had taken in the early part of the day. I shall be well again to-morrow, but with your permission I will now retire. Good night." I held out my hand and it was taken in the warm clasp of another, and the voice again murmured, "Poor darling; my fierceness and impetuosity frightened her. I should have been more gentle; I could not have been more sincere." I averted my eyes and did not reply, only to utter a cold good night.</p> 
               <p>Then I was left to my own thoughts. They were not pleasant company, but they were more agreeable than the<pb n=""/> curious eyes Nancy fastened upon my face, and rather peremptorily I bade her take herself off for the night. After she was gone I fastened the door securely, and sitting down before the glowing grate bowed my head upon my hands and yielded myself up to gloomy reverie. The clock upon the mantel, striking the hour of midnight, first aroused me, and I rose to prepare for bed. Then for the first time my eye fell upon a letter lying upon the table. I picked it up and found it was in Jessie's familiar handwriting. I opened it and read with but little real interest till these words riveted my attention:</p> 
               <p>"And now before I close, darling, I must tell you that which I had intended you to know long ago, but which I never could summon courage to impart. How can I tell you? In what manner can I express the joy that fills my heart as I write? Words are powerless to express my happiness. Would that I could fly to you and whisper my glad secret in your ear. But I will be calm and tell you all. Last Summer when your long letters came to me from N--, filled with descriptions of your enjoyments and the people whom you met, I often sighed at the monotony of my secluded life, and longed to share your pleasures. About that time there came to Cheswell a party of gentlemen, ostensibly for hunting and fishing. Accident made me acquainted with one of their number, and as we came to know each other better, the enjoyment we found in each other's society proportionably increased, and at length I had the happiness of knowing that I was beloved even as I had loved. For once, the 'course of true love' has run smooth. The gentleman is, as Madame would say, of genteel extraction, rich, talented, and altogether unexceptionable, and there seems to be no obstacle to the marriage, which I have promised<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5689-00000068"/> ised shall be consummated in the ensuing Spring. He is, at present, in New York, where he expects to remain during the Winter. How I wish that you could meet, for you must know I have given him glowing accounts of my darling. His name is Southbank-Roderic Southbank-ah! how I have learned to love it. It is a stately name-fit for the one who bears it; and to think that some day it will be <emph>mine</emph>. I am so perfectly happy that sometimes my coward heart whispers that it cannot last; but I will not allow idle fears to trouble me. While he is true I can cheerfully encounter all the ills of life."</p> 
               <p>What a revelation was here-the cup of sorrow put to her very lips so smilingly, blissfully unconscious. Ah! bitter, bitter agony! Must mine be the hand to offer it? I could not have it so. I bowed my head and the tears I could not shed for myself burst forth for another's woes. I had that night received another lesson in man's wickedness. For myself I could have borne it, and in my deep trouble I shuddered at the lower depths I had escaped-at what might have been had I returned the love of Roderic Southbank.</p> 
               <p>I shrank from the task before me when I thought of Jessie, but I sought not to evade it. I passed a sleepless night, and the next morning the face that gleamed upon me from the mirror startled me, it looked so worn and haggard. Nancy seemed distressed at my appearance, but I assured her I was well and there was no cause for anxiety. As she stood combing out my curls, she said as if to herself, "who would have thought it, such a nice young gentleman as he seemed to be," and when I questioned her sharply as to whom she referred, she replied humbly, "Only Mr. Southbank, ma'am. I was sayin' what a pity it was that a handsome young gentleman like him should do all the dreadful things they say<pb n=""/> about him. Why, Miss Laura, James told me yesterday, it was him that wronged poor Dora Lansing by promises of marriage, and brought her where she is; only for him she'd be as sweet an' innocent as ever. And Mrs. Belden knowin' it all the time an' bein' so hard on poor Dora, an' so perlite an' smilin' to him all the time, askin' him here an' treatin' him with the greatest favor. I'd never thought it of her; never, with her name headin' the list for every charitable institution an' talkin' so grandly in the parlor about moral reform an'. all that. Oh I tell you there'll come a day when they'll get their reward, and they can't make anybody else the scape-goat, thank fortune. They'll all share alike in that day, and no favor shown on account of their riches. That's the only bit of comfort 1 have when I think of it."</p> 
               <p>Here Nancy's hair-dressing and moralizing both came to an end, and I descended to the breakfast room with a heavy heart. Mrs. Belden had not yet made her appearance, and I poured coffee for Mr. Belden, who was in haste to be at his place of business.</p> 
               <p>"Southbank here, last evening?" he asked abruptly, and added, taking a second cup of coffee and buttering another roll, "Somehow I don't like the fellow; he's got money and good looks, and all that sort of thing; more's the pity, I say, if he can't make better use of them than he has done. Seems to me he comes here pretty often. Belden Place seems to present unusual attractions for him now-a-days-must be as Mrs. Belden says about it. But don't be rash, my dear. I like you; you've got more sense than all the rest of the crinoline my wife has had about her, and I hate to see you thrown away on an idle fellow like Southbank. He's got talents if he would make use of them; but he wont, there's the trouble; he wont make use of them; had rather lounge<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5689-00000069"/> round on sofas and talk nonsense to young ladies no wiser than himself, (present company excepted, of course.) He's no more account than my wife's poodle. Young lady, I'm old enough to be your father, and I havn't lived so long in the world for nothing. Take my advice and don't let the women wheedle you into a marriage just for show and splendor, and all that sort of things women delight in. Wife says you can reform him, make somebody out of him-energize him; that's the word she used, but I say that's all bosh! If you could, he ain't worth the effort, and you're too good for him. Pardon my freedom, and take my remarks as they're meant for your good. I'm off. Good morning;" and he was gone, leaving me astonished and not a little amused at the advice given in such an off-hand manner. He was a shrewd business man, very eccentric, and a person of very few words; when he did speak, however, it was always to the point, and any one who was wise would not let his advice go unregarded. On this occasion I acknowledged the truth of his words, and going to my own room with a heavy heart, bent all my energies to the painful task before me. In a short time I had a letter written and sealed for Jessie, containing an account of the true character of Roderic Southbank, given in as mild a manner as possible, but I knew that nothing that I could say would alleviate the pain that news would cause her. It might break her heart and my hand might be the one to give the death-stroke. The thought was too horrible to bear. I put it resolutely aside and drawing a fresh sheet before me, wrote a cool, firm refusal of his suit to Southbank, with a command never to seek nor communicate with me again, adding that the perjured lover of Jessie Irving, the betrayer of the wronged Dora Lansing, never need hope for forgiveness from one who felt keenly all the<pb n=""/> wrongs of her sex. These were despatched as soon as written, and feeling that I had done my whole duty, I became more calm; but the reaction that follows great excitement left me as Nancy declared, down sick, and for days I did not leave the house.</p>

               <p>Nearly a week passed, and in all that time I had heard nothing from Dora Lansing. As I sat in my room gazing listlessly into the glowing sea-coal fire a servant came to the door with a letter. It was from Dora and seemed written in the most extreme anguish of mind. It stated that from some reason which she could not there explain, she had been obliged to remove to a room in -- Alley; that she was in great trouble and begged me, in the name of humanity, to come and help her. The letter further requested that I would come alone, or I might be unable to see her. A feeling of suspicion crossed my mind, but I instantly dismissed it, for I thought I could have nothing to fear from a visit to Dora, wherever she might be, and I might do much good. I had grown to love the gentle girl with the yearning tenderness a woman feels for one dependent on them and I longed to hasten to her relief. I hastily arrayed myself for a walk and having left a message for Mrs. Belden, stating that I should be absent some hours, started for the locality named in Dora's letter, which, after much trouble and inquiry, I succeeded in reaching. It proved to be a crazy tenement in one of the most wretched of the many wretched alleys in<pb n=""/> that great city, and with a sudden feeling of fear I drew back scarcely daring to hazard an entrance into the ill looking place. The thought flashed across my mind that I might have been decoyed there for evil, but in a moment I laughed at my foolish fancies, and impelled by curiosity and a desire to benefit Dora, I rapped distinctly upon the dingy looking door. A coarse, brazen-looking woman answered my rap, but though she eyed me curiously and surlily she answered me civilly enough, and conducted me through a long hall and threw open the door of a room in which she said I would find the object of my search. The sudden change from the broad glare of light without to the dim twilight in which the room was shrouded, at first deprived me of the power to distinguish objects, but the strange silence that hovered over the place appalled me. There seemed to be no living creature in the room beside myself. I called aloud, "Dora-Dora Lansing," but there was no response, only the slumbering echoes took up my words and repeated them to my startled senses. A horrible fear took possession of me. I ran to the window and drew back the curtain and let in a flood of light, but could discover nothing animate only my own startled face in a little mirror upon the opposite wall. I was alone. Then I went to the door and tried to open it, but it would not yield. I called aloud frantically, but there came no reply. I was a prisoner. I sat down and sought to collect my bewildered senses and contemplate as calmly as possible my trying position. I could think of but one person to whom to ascribe the present outrage. Roderic Southbank I felt sure was the author of my present misery. I had heard nothing from him since my rejection of his suit. His silence boded me no good. Yes, it could be him alone. While I had supposed myself effectually<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5689-00000071"/> ually rid of him he had been plotting against my happiness. I took out my watch-the hand pointed to the hour of twelve. I glanced again around the meagerly furnished apartment and wondered how long the term of my imprisonment was to be, and tried to comfort myself with the hope that my prolonged absence might excite the suspicions of the faithful Nancy and bring somebody to my relief. But it was a dreary time and I felt intolerably wretched. I could not deny that my situation was one of great danger, and I could not help feeling terribly depressed. After a time the woman I have before mentioned, entered, bearing on a tray quite a neatly arranged luncheon. But my appetite had fled, and had I been disposed to have partaken of the food fear would have kept me from it. The woman refused to answer any questions and departed, looking quite injured at my not having done justice to her repast which had evidently cost her no little trouble to prepare.</p> 
               <p>The long hours of that dreary winter day dragged slowly by and darkness at length set in, and with it a furious storm. The moaning of the wind and the beating of the tempest against the window made me feel sadder than before. There was a lamp and matches standing upon a greasy shelf, and unable to encounter the darkness and the sombre thoughts that partook of its nature, I took it down from the shelf and carefully lighted it, and then placed more fuel upon the fire. The room assumed a more cheerful aspect and I felt more than rewarded for the effort I had made. As I sat with my head bowed upon my hands there was the sound of footsteps without, then a firm, quick tread,-a key turned in the lock of my door, and I stood face to face with Roderic Southbank. He closed the door and carefully secured it, then came forward with a triumphant smile lighting up his whole face which also<pb n=""/> wore a look of determination and conscious power. I felt, as I looked upon him, that all hope had fled, but resolved not to let him see the extent of my misery. I did not reply to his somewhat familiar salutation, but haughtily demanded the reason of these very singular and uncalled for proceedings. His face flushed deeply, but he replied quietly:</p> 
               <p>"Softly, softly, Miss Clifford; your good sense will show you at once that you are wholly in my power, and that your wisest course would be rather to conciliate than excite me to anger. I have made a desperate move and am not a man to be thwarted in anything that I undertake. I offered you honorable marriage; you scorned my suit and I have vowed to possess you at all hazards. My object in bringing you here was to accomplish the purpose I had in view more speedily than I could in any other manner. If you will retract your scornful words and unite yourself to me, I will overlook your contemptuous treatment and call it only a woman's caprice. Mine you must be; I have sworn it. It remains for you to say how; your own good sense will convince you of the truth of what I tell you. I have never before honored a woman with any real love. I always felt a contempt for the whole sex until I saw you. Your dark, splendid, regal beauty, your superiority to those of your sex whom I had before met, first attracted me; then I learned to love you; I vowed to have you for my wife. I have made a desperate move and there is none to avert your doom." And an expression of cruel triumph gave a sinister expression to the dark features. "Unless I am altogether mistaken in her character, once my wife, and pride would forever seal the lips of Laura Clifford."</p> 
               <p>He paused as if awaiting a reply. A deadly fear filled my whole being. I realized that, as he had said, I was wholly<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5689-00000072"/> in the power of a desperate man, one who, had fortune so willed it and placed him amid other scenes, might have been the boldest and most daring chieftains that ever led an outlaw band amid the mountain fastnesses of Spain, or a horde of the banditti of Italy, in the olden days of romance. He was reckless, and would dare everything to gain the end he desired. The storm had continued to increase and now gusts of wind swept drearily through the passage and rattled the casements furiously. The wind-spirits seemed holding a revel and peering curiously in with elfin faces, mocking my anguish and then rushed shrieking away, the sound of their goblin laughter ringing out wild and defiant for an instant and then dying away in a low, dismal moan and then rising into fitful sobbing. For a moment I gave myself up to the contemplation of the dark picture-the picture of my future as the wife of that man. It was impossible; it should never-never be; I would prefer death. With a wild energy born of the terrible despair that filled my soul, I rose up and defied him-bade him do his worst-hurled at him the scorn and contempt, that one of my sex alone can feel toward one who has wronged her woman nature. He stood silent, but with a look of dogged resolution shining out from his volcanic eyes, and I knew it was hopeless to expect mercy from him. I sank down upon a seat and buried my face in my hands. He approached nearer and bent over me till I felt his warm breath upon my cheek. But my ear had caught a sound unheard by him, that was far different from the wailing voices of the night. There was a dull, heavy sound, as of something falling, then a rush of footsteps in the passage, a heavy body pushed against the door, which fell with a crash, and I beheld James, the butler at Belden Place, together with the coachman, another well-known functionary,<pb n=""/> and behind them the broad, good-natured face of Nancy Redfield. Roderic Southbank saw the same, and with an oath he sprang over the burly figures and disappeared into the darkness and gloom without. Meanwhile Nancy was crying and laughing by turns, and awkwardly trying to envelop me in my walking attire. James, the butler, picked himself up slowly from among the broken pieces of what once constituted the door of my prison, and came forward. There were tears of thankfulness in his honest eyes as he exclaimed, "Thank the good Lord, Miss Laura, that you're safe. There ain't a moment to lose; some of the low creatures round the place may try to stop us; it's the worst part of the city-all sorts of crime committed here."</p> 
               <p>I felt no disposition to linger, and half leaning upon the arm of the faithful Nancy, went out into the night. After walking the length of a block we came to a broader street, where we found the Belden family carriage awaiting us, and I sank wearily upon the crimson cushions feeling that here, at least, was safety. As we were whirling rapidly along, I asked Nancy how she came to be able to afford me such timely relief. She replied, "Why, you see somehow, I'd felt a kinder presentiment sumthin' was goin' to happen; and, after you'd gone I went up stairs to see to the fire; I saw sumthin' on the floor, and thinkin' you'd throwd it away I was just goin' to put it in the fire, when I just stopped to admire the writin', so purty and lady-like, then 'fore I know'd it I'd read it, an' when I cum to the place told about in the letter, I say's mark my words, there's a trap set for somebody; all ain't right. So I hurried away to James an' I slowed him the letter, an', says he, 'Good Lord, Nancy, that's the wickedest place in the hull city; nobody goes there for any good. Somethin' dreadful will happen to poor, dear<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5689-00000073"/> Miss Laura. Let us go and tell the mistress.' But I very soon showed him how foolish that would be. It might be poor Dora Lansing was in trouble, and then it would make Miss Laura angry to know that the servants meddled with her affairs. But, says I, I'll tell you what we will do, James. We will do everything quiet like an' not let any one suspect anythin', and then if there ain't any occasion for fear, Miss Laura, who is a real noble lady, will only thank us for tryin' to dew our best, an' as she says, take the will for the deed.' So we went and told Jonson, the coachman, a real trustworthy man, an' we came off down here to make sure there wasn't going to be any foul play. James brought along the master's pistols, which he know'd how to use, an' says he, 'Nancy, I'll dare everything in the young lady's defence, even if its to give my life for her, and so put an end to all our dreams of future happiness.'" Here Nancy indulged in a sentimental sniffle at which I could not forbear smiling, despite the late imminent danger I had been in. But I thanked her warmly for her timely aid and praised her tact and sagacity in making so little noise about the matter. When we reached our place of destination I divided the contents of my purse, which was no inconsiderable sum, among my brave rescuers, and after enjoining silence, which was readily promised, I entered the house. Mrs. Belden, who suspected nothing, met me with an affectionate welcome, but pleading fatigue, I escaped to my own room. Wishing to avoid remark and believing that there would be no more of the like proceedings, I determined to say nothing about the matter. The next morning I read the name of Roderic Southbank among the list of passengers in the Ariel for Europe. I was inexpressibly relieved, and after I had had time to recover from the effects of the excitement,<pb n=""/> felt a tranquility I had not before experienced since I had first become acquainted with him. However, this was not the case with Mrs. Belden. She was greatly disappointed at Southbank's abrupt departure, and questioned me closely as to its cause. Mr. Belden, on the contrary, was as pleased as his lady was annoyed, and took an early opportunity to express his gratification at my line of conduct, and at length even Mrs. Belden, being won over to his opinion, declared it was all for the best, and immediately commenced planning more important conquests for the future.</p> 
               <p>Bertha Eveleth, about this time, created a stir in the fashionable world, by exchanging the dear name I had so loved for the title of a countess, and was now, rumor said, "the observed of all observers," reveling amid the gaities of a Parisian court. But it did not in the least disturb my peace of mind to know that she rode grandly in a coroneted carriage, or as the wife of the Count de Valeurs mingled with the proudest nobles of the court of France. I had long ago repented of the petty jealousy and desire for revenge that had caused me to send despair into one heart, and when I thought of Mr. Granville I felt more pity for the insane folly of Roderic Southbank. Thank Heaven he had gone and I could remain unmolested. But Jessie, I longed yet dreaded to hear from her. I had not long to wait. She wrote,-</p> 
               <p>"DEAR LAURA:-That All-seeing eye which readeth the secrets of every heart, alone saw what I have suffered in the past few weeks. The 'bitter waters' have flowed over my soul until I have cried out in my agony, 'my suffering is greater than I can bear.' 'Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow,' has been the cry of my bruised and bleeding heart. Many so situated would have turned<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5689-00000074"/> from the world saying, 'I have no pleasure in it.' No strength of my own, only the infinite mercy of the God I had nearly forgotten in my blind worship of a false idol, saved me. I went unto Him who has said, 'Come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest,' and the blessed promise was graciously fulfilled. I bow to a higher will than man's; I lean upon the Rock of Ages."</p> 
               <p>I crushed the letter in my hand. The innocent faith of this young Christian was a rebuke to me. Oh, how inexpressibly I longed to possess it! Every one else had some kind of religion. The devotee, kneeling at the shrine-the children of the Sun worshipping him as the Deity-the heathen mother casting her innocent offspring into the sacred waters-even the dark children of the forest looking forward to the happy hunting grounds beyond and upward to the Great Spirit-all had something to reverence, to adore, and I-I had nothing. I felt like a thing accursed. Oh! that I could believe, there was no penance so severe that I would not gladly undergo it, no sacrifice so great that I would not make it for the child-like faith Jessie possessed, that "peace that passeth all understanding." Even the intellect I had secretly prided myself upon possessing, my talents, all these would I give for the blessed assurance that I had found the true source of all light. But though I longed and tried blindly to seek it, this source of consolation was not mine. I still groped in darkness.</p> 
               <p>I did not hear from Jessie again until some time had passed-then came a hastily written letter, blotted here and there with tears. "Laura," it said, "Come to us-come at once. Our Lily is dying-slowly but surely dying. Fading away before our eyes, each day growing more ethereal, less earthly and more like the angels. It is her wish that<pb n=""/> she may be privileged to behold you once more on earth. It is her last wish, darling, and we all unite our petitions to hers. Will-you-come to your afflicted Jessie?" Two days later I bade New York a last adieu, and started for Cheswell, hoping to reach there before the pure spirit of Lily should have winged its flight to a happier world.</p>

               <p>A pale sad face met me at the depot, but I would have known Claude Irving among a thousand, and I clasped his hand with a glow of real pleasure, such as I had not believed my worn heart capable of again experiencing. Our ride home was a pleasant one, despite its mournfulness. Claude seemed to feel deeply for <choice>
                     <sic>Lilly's</sic>
                     <corr>Lily's</corr>
                  </choice> sufferings, which he told me, had been very great. The tears filled his fine eyes, as he spoke of her leaving him, but his conversation showed a resignation to the Divine will, whatever it might be. Jessie came down the garden walk to meet us, and though bright crystal drops welled up into her eyes, as she spoke of my sad<pb n=""/> errand, we were both deeply thankful that we had been permitted to meet again. Lily had been failing fast, and the physician said that her days were numbered. She would soon "have passed that bourne from whence no traveler e'er returns." She was conscious of her danger, and knew that the hour of her dissolution approached. The white, death-like countenance, with its great hollow eyes, the attenuated form and the little transparent hands that crept into mine, told their own story of what our darling had suffered. She was delighted to see me, and whispered that now her friends were around her, she could die content. Her illness had been of long duration and as both Claude and Jessie were wearied with watching I insisted upon taking their place at Lily's bedside during the night, and as the invalid seemed to desire it they yielded to my wishes and sought the repose they so much needed. Dear Lily seemed to have taken a strange fancy to have me near her, and when we were alone together, with nothing but darkness and silence around us, she clasped my hand affectionately in both her own and told me how earnestly she had desired to see me, and how she believed her longing had kept her yet a little longer among the living.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Laura!" and the cry of her heart rose up strengthening the feeble voice and lending an unnatural brilliancy to the dying eyes, "how I wish that you were a Christian! It has been the one wish of my heart that you could have an interest in Christ-that you might become a 'follower of the meek and lowly Jesus.' Jessie has told me how you have been groping in the darkness of infidelity without the blessed light of the Gospel and I have prayed for you-that was all that I could do. I have interceded in your behalf until it seems that my prayers must be heard and answered. Laura dear, I believe that I have not striven in vain. I believe<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5689-00000076"/> that my Heavenly Father who sent His only begotten Son into the world to die that we might live, will grant the prayer of my dying lips. And though as yet you are a stranger to Him, in the future when the sod of the valley rests upon my bosom, and flowers are blooming over my grave, you will acknowledge the error of your ways and come humble and penitent as a little child to kneel at the feet of Jesus."</p> 
               <p>She ceased and her lips moved silently. I knew that she was praying for <emph>me</emph>. Then, as though she had cast all her cares on One powerful to save, she closed her eyes peacefully and seemed to sleep. Dear, dear Lily! As I looked upon her sweet face lying helplessly among the pillows, white as the snowy drifts of lace that floated about it, I thought of the olden story about entertaining angels unawares. She was too pure and fair for earth.</p> 
               <p>I knew then as I looked upon the face of this dying saint that she would live forever in a home beyond the skies. I knew in that moment, as fully as I realized it afterwards, that there <emph>was</emph> a reality in religion. Somewhat of the glory of that heavenly land broke upon my vision, and in imagination I beheld that loved one among that throng of "radiant ones" who, with harps in their hands, are forever praising Him amid the glories of the Celestial City. The Bible that was <emph>her</emph> dearest treasure had been <emph>my mother's</emph> guide. Oh! that it might lead me, too, weak, wicked worldling as I had been, far as my feet had wandered in the forbidden path, that it might lead <emph>me</emph> "into the green pastures and beside the still waters" to a "blest land beyond the river." I will seek diligently, I said, for the promise-perhaps there is hope for me, even <emph>me</emph>.</p> 
               <p>"Thank God that you have made that resolve. Now I can die in peace, trusting that we shall meet again in the morning<pb n=""/> ing. He has promised, 'they that seek me early shall find me.' 'Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.' Take your burden of guilt to Him who will abundantly pardon."</p> 
               <p>It was the dying voice of Lily who had awakened and heard the thoughts I had uttered aloud in my earnestness. A great change had come over her. The hand of death was upon her, but her face shone like the face of an angel. I hastily awakened Claude who was sleeping soundly in an adjoining apartment, then roused Jessie and hurried back to my charge. She was sinking rapidly, and I knew before the physician who had been hurriedly summoned entered, that she had but a few moments longer to live. She was perfectly conscious and bade her friends all a last good-bye, pointing them upward for strength and consolation. Mrs. Gordon was carried fainting from the room.</p> 
               <p>"Poor mamma," murmured the dying one, "she will miss me. Comfort her, Jessie, for you must take my place; tell her how happy I felt, and you, too, Laura, give her a daughter's love. Claude come nearer; my eyes are growing dim. I would look. upon your face again. This is the only bitterness to leave you-my precious, darling husband. Oh, God, give us both strength for this parting hour. But do not grieve dearest; I shall be happy. Claude, Jessie, Laura,-love one another and live so that we may meet again when you, too, shall have passed 'over the delectable mountains.' Farewell; a last farewell."</p> 
               <p>A sweet smile lit up the dying face; there was a half drawn sigh, a short, quick gasp and Lily Gordon was among the angels. She would henceforth walk the gold paved streets of the New Jerusalem. She had found peace and rest. There "where God shall wipe away all tears from their<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5689-00000077"/> eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain."</p>

               <p>It was night; clear, cold and starlight; with a pale, cold moon gazing calmly down upon the sleeping earth. Within the little parlor of the parsonage all that was mortal of our darling lay robed for the grave. The wee hands were folded calmly over the pulseless breast; the dark lashes drooped silently over the dear eyes that had ever beamed with the gentle light of affection, but which, alas! would never look upon us again in love; and the bird-like voice that had been wont to ripple over the coral lips in gushes of fairy music was hushed forever. But above amid the angel choir there beamed another seraph face and another voice mingled with those ascending with songs of praise to the Redeemer: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"He came-an angel, bearing from on high</l>

               <p>When I looked at the dear face, so happy even in death, I thought of the words she had addressed to me in that last hour, and the dying voice in its sweet pathos rang again in my ear: "Laura, darling, how I wish that you were a Christian." I bent over the coffin and pressed a kiss upon the pale brow of the sleeper, then stole softly from the room and<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5689-00000078"/> out into the night. The pale Lady of the Heavens smiled calmly down upon me, and the stars glittered and glowed all unconscious of the anguish of my troubled spirit. The glory of His handiwork broke upon my vision as it had never done before. A deep awe fell upon me. I had never so realized my own utter insignificance as I did now when I thought of the worlds beyond, and that I was but a tiny atom in His great, glorious Universe. I fell upon my knees and besought Him who had brought the Israelites of old out of bondage, "under the cloud and through the sea," to bring me out of the bondage of sin, out of the power of the adversary who was luring me by a false beacon down into the blackness of darkness forever. In my helplessness and misery I brought all my burden of sin and east it at His feet, and when I rose up I knew that the prayers of that dear saint had been answered, and I was saved. A low voice near me uttered fervently, "Thanks to the Giver of all Good for this great boon. Consecrate, in this moment when you feel His ineffable goodness, all your talents and the wealth He has given you to His service." I looked up. Two dark earnest eyes bent above me, and the voice of Claude Irving came to me as a blessed benediction. Two days after, Lily was laid to rest and we took up the burden of life again with a subdued sorrow for her who was "not lost but gone before." It was decided that I should spend the remainder of the Winter with Jessie, which arrangement proved perfectly satisfactory to all parties. We were sitting, Jessie and I, one evening in the cozy little library Lily had been wont to fill with the sunshine of her presence. Claude was absent at the bedside of a dying parishioner, and we were alone with only the wailing winds and our own sombre thoughts for company. An unusual shade of sadness rested upon Jessie's fair face, and<pb n=""/> when I sought to know the cause she only rested her head upon my shoulder and wept.</p> 
               <p>By a tacit agreement we had not mentioned the name of Roderic Southbank since I had been at the parsonage, but I knew now that she was thinking of him and believing it to be better for her to know the truth I told her all that I knew of him, not omitting, though I would. gladly have done so, his cowardly conduct upon the last occasion when I had met him, and the reason for his abrupt departure to foreign shores. She had long known that her love was hopeless and had tried to feel resigned to the will of Providence and forget the false one, but the white lips quivered, and she said drearily:</p> 
               <p>"I have suffered so! I have sometimes almost wished to die and end the struggle. Your letter which I had expected and waited and longed for came, and where I had thought to trace words of heart-felt affection and congratulation I read the cruel lines that gave the death blow to all my hopes. It was good and kind in you to tell me, and you were not to blame. How could he help loving so peerlessly, so regally beautiful. Even in the first bitter agony I felt grateful, but <emph>oh! I loved him so!</emph> The old year went out and its last echoes seemed the death knell of my departed hopes. And the dawning year to which I had looked forward with such joyful anticipations, which was to have witnessed my bridal, broke in upon me white and rigid with the terrible despair that gnawed at my heart and seemed to have frozen the very life blood in my veins. Wretched, despairing, forsaken, I had still the One Friend who never faileth-only that saved me from cursing the hour of my birth. I went and knelt at His feet and angels came and ministered unto me."</p> 
               <p>The keen anguish that had made the young face look old<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5689-00000079"/> and worn faded out, and into the calm eyes there stole a heavenly light. The sweet lips parted in a reverent smile and "Not my will, O Father, but <emph>thine</emph> be done," came to me in an awe-struck whisper.</p> 
               <p>I knew then that the first bitter agony was past and that time would bring a healing balm to her troubled spirit and shroud the dark past in the veil of oblivion. The short winter days wore quickly away, and the time drew near when our pleasant circle was broken up. I was to return to Graham Lodge, Claude to make the tour of Europe to recuperate his exhausted energies, and my sweet Jessie to take up her residence with the Gordons, to take the place of the lost Lily. Our parting was a sad one, though cheered by the hope of a reunion again in a few short months, and fixing my mind steadfastly upon the brighter future and shutting out, as far as possible the sombre present, I bade Cheswell again adieu.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Miller met me with the welcome a mother might have given to a loved daughter, and I was pleased to witness a marked improvement in the good lady's health. I found her more than ever occupied with her benevolent projects, and soon after my return I accompanied her upon her round of daily visits. It was a balmy spring day, and, as we rode along, we recalled the ride we had taken together so long ago in search of help. We drove to the same house where, so long before, we had found the girl Catharine, where Mrs. Miller informed me, there lived a sewing-girl in whom she was deeply interested. We entered the little back parlor, and there, bending over some fine sewing, sat Dora Lansing. She started up with a cry of delight and came towards me with outstretched hands; but believing her to have been an accomplice of Southbank in his villainy, I retreated with averted face, at which she sank down again, cowering and looking like a frightened bird. Not wishing a scene, I drew her hastily aside and questioned her. I succeeded in eliciting the facts that she had been abducted from her home by persons unknown, hurried into a carriage and driven rapidly a long distance, and set down penniless and alone upon the<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5689-00000080"/> outskirts of a village, that she had wandered on until her weary limbs refused longer to support her and had sunk down to be taken up and cared for by kindly, but stranger hands. Some benevolent ladies, among whom was dear Mrs. Miller, had interested themselves in her case and provided her with a home and employment. This was all she could tell me. It was impossible to look into those honest eyes and not read truth in their clear depths. So kissing her I told her I was glad to learn "her lines had fallen in pleasant places," and promising her all the assistance that lay in my power, I left her, without hinting to the unsuspicious girl, that she had been again the victim of the machinations of Southbank. Mrs. Miller was more than satisfied with the explanation I gave of Dora's having been a protege of mine, and was rejoiced that she had been permitted to be of the least assistance to the wronged one.</p> 
               <p>The Spring passed swiftly by and Summer came again, smiling and bright in her robe of beauty, to gladden all hearts. I heard from Jessie regularly, and, of late, her letters had assumed a more cheerful tone. She spoke highly of Mr. Leonard, the gentleman who presided over the church in Claude's absence. He was handsome and intellectual and deeply pious. She dwelt long upon his excellencies, and the good he was doing in the village, and to her dear adopted parents, whose house he made his home. Being brought in daily contact with him, she had learned to esteem and respect him as he deserved. Ah! Jessie, respect and esteem are closely allied to love.</p> 
               <p>About this time I read in the paper the marriage of Mr. Thomas Granville to a very estimable young lady, one whom I had known and loved. He was advancing rapidly in his profession and gave promise of being one of its brightest<pb n=""/> ornaments. I breathed a prayer of glad thanksgiving to Him who had saved me from that sin-dooming a fellow-creature to despair. Truly "He doeth <emph>all</emph> things well."</p> 
               <p>It was a calm, summer's day; the breeze whispered softly through the trees, drooping their long branches lazily, and stole softly in at my window, rustling the papers upon my writing desk, and sending a shower of rose leaves across the open page before me. Nature, in her glowing beauty, seemed to beckon me out into the pure air and pleasant sunshine, and yielding to her enchantment I awoke from the reverie into which I had fallen, and went out to view the glorious prospect. Unconsciously I bent my steps in the direction of Dora Lansing's humble home. The door stood open and I heard voices, and these words floated out to me:</p> 
               <p>"Dora-my wife-can you forgive me all I have caused you to suffer? Call you forget the cruel past and take me, humble and penitent and help me to live a better life?"</p> 
               <p>The sweet, silvery voice of Dora answered softly, "I will be true to my trust; Jesus pardoned the thief on the cross and shall I, weak and erring mortal, be less forgiving."</p> 
               <p>I moved, involuntarily, a step forward; a stately form knelt before the low seat in which Dora sat, and as my step sounded upon the gravel walk, <emph>Roderic Southbank</emph> rose to meet me on the threshold. There was a moment of silence, then Dora started up, her white hands clasped imploringly,</p> 
               <p>"Laura," she said, "Miss Clifford, do not look so cold; you are all generosity and nobleness; I know that you will grant the forgiveness he supplicates."</p> 
               <p>I looked and behold, and there upon his knees before me, knelt my old time enemy, and a voice deep and earnest said, "Miss Clifford, here upon my knees I ask you to forgive the past. I came here seeking one whom I had made my victim<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5689-00000081"/> by entrapping her into a false marriage, not knowing that I should meet another whom I had wronged; but if you will grant me pardon, I shall feel that Providence has dealt kindlier by me than I deserve. I ask this in the name of Him who said, 'Judge not lest ye be also judged.'"</p> 
               <p>Fully convinced of his sincerity, I freely forgave him the injury he had done, or sought to do, me; and Dora's happy look was a sufficient reward, even if an approving conscience had not added to my pleasure. Poor Dora; I had never imagined how she had suffered until I saw how happy she was, now that Southbank was restored to her, "clothed and in his right mind." He was indeed a changed man. A nearly mortal sickness that had left him weak and helpless among strangers, had shown him the error of his ways and he had risen from that couch of suffering a new man. Before the sun that shone so brightly upon her young head had sunk to rest, Dora Lansing was on her way to a distant city, the lawful wife of Roderic Southbank. She had loved him from the first, and now went cheerfully to share his future, which was to be that of a Western missionary. God speed them both and make them happier in the future than they have been in the past, was the prayer that I sent after them as I left them to muse upon the singular and romantic change in the fortunes of my little protege. Truly "His ways are not as our ways."</p>

               <p>Time, bearing on his swift wings the hopes, the joys and the lives of many, passed on until two more years were numbered with the past. What changes had they brought to our loved ones? First and best of all it had restored to Mrs. Miller one long mourned as dead. Clarence Leonard, whose goodness and eloquence had made him beloved by all, was the loved Clarence of Mrs. Miller's story. His early years had been spent in Europe, whither his father had taken him with the English nurse who had consented to go with them in that capacity. They had led a very secluded life in Italy, until chance, or rather Providence, had thrown in their way Rupert Southbank, a wretched wanderer, in a strange land dying of the remorse that had embittered his life. A mortal illness was upon him, and in his last moments he had imparted to the almost distracted man who hung over him,<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5689-00000082"/> the dark scheme by which he had ruined his happiness, and then gone, wildly imploring pardon, into the presence of the Judge. Scarcely waiting to see the wretched man decently interred, Middleton Leonard had taken passage in the first vessel bound for America. But alas! the good ship in which he sailed was never heard of more. He had found an ocean grave. The young Clarence had been adopted by some English tourists when the fate of his father became known, and went to reside with them in England. Just before his departure the faithful nurse sickened and died, but perfectly conscious to the last, she related to the youthful Clarence the story of his parent's wrongs. He was old enough to realize the sad story, and promised to visit America in quest of his mother when he became of a suitable age; a promise which he had religiously kept. So giving him a portrait of his young mother painted upon ivory, she died praying for blessings on his young head. But Mrs. Miller was right. In the prematurely aged, grief-bowed woman filling the humble, though honorable position of housekeeper at Graham Lodge, no one would be able to recognize the once courted and admired Mrs. Middleton Leonard. But He who ruleth all things, "whom even the winds and waves obey," had brought them together, and thus filled the measure of their happiness. Mrs. Miller had not only a son, but she was soon to have a daughter also. My sweet Jessie had verified her theory of second love by promising her hand to one for whom she had first felt a deep respect and esteem, which is the basis of all true love. They were all happy, while I could not help contrasting my own fate with theirs. I did not envy my darling, who deserved the most exalted happiness. I could not be so base-but-how lonely I felt, and how hopeless! The future rose before me; alone-alone!<pb n=""/> It had a dreary sound. I had never dreaded having the appellation of "old maid" applied to me. Laura Clifford, spinster! Well, I rather liked the sound; but it looked so dreary when I peered curiously down the long, dim vistas of the future. No strong arm to uphold me when I grew weary of the strife of living; no dear voice to whisper words of comfort and consolation; no lisping child-voices to whisper the dearest of all words, mother. Oh, it is a woman's nature to be loving and dependent. I care not how strong-minded, how stern and unflinching in her ideas of duty, how seemingly independent she may be, there are times when the strongest spirit will faint, and she <choice>

                  </choice> long for some one to whom she can turn for advice and sympathy. Still I had much to be thankful for. Life, health, many dear friends, and the means of doing good to others, all these I possessed. Better strive to merit these blessings than murmur that I had not all.</p> 
               <p>Thus I sat absorbed in reverie while the <q>
                     <l>"Cold wintry winds of December"</l>
                  </q> shrieked and moaned around the house. The storm king seemed holding a revel with his subjects, and ghostly voices sounded above the storm. Wilder grew the night and higher drifted the snow upon the terraces and along the garden walks. The casements rattled and the storm beat against the windows, and I said shudderingly: "God pity the poor wretch who is abroad to-night!" At that moment, old Timothy, the gardener, appeared upon the threshold. There was an expression of concern upon his face as he informed me that having heard, as he thought, a human voice above the storm, he had gone out and discovered a woman's form lying white and rigid in the snow; that he had brought her<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5689-00000083"/> into the kitchen where Nancy was now faithfully administering restoratives. I arose and followed him below, and there before me cold and white, with a face like the face of the dead, lay-Bertha, Countess de Valeurs! I bent over her. It seemed as if the vital spark had fled; but after placing her in a warm bed, in a room above, and using every means at our command, we had the satisfaction of seeing the color come back into the pale cheeks and lips and the great dark eyes open and gaze wonderingly around the room. When they fell upon my face she uttered a feeble cry and covered her face with her hands. Thus she lay for a long time, then as with an effort, she removed her wasted fingers and motioned me to her. I bent my ear and she said faintly, "Those people, send them away; I want to die alone with you." Then, when they had left us to silence, she spoke again:</p> 
               <p>"Laura Clifford, I am dying; I shall never see another day dawn upon earth. I feel, I know that death will soon claim me for his own. Would that I were ready to meet him, but it is too late now-too late I too late!" Then, a moment after, "You wonder how I came to be here in this predicament. My trust was betrayed. The man I married for a title, was a vile imposter, a professional gambler and had not even an honorable name to offer me. I dragged out the weary, wretched days after my marriage, alone in a land of strangers, with whose language even I was unacquainted. Then when my fortune was all gone he left me, and I turned hopeless and despairing towards my native land to die among my friends. But when I reached New York I found that I had no friends. Among all those who had expressed the deepest regard for me, there was not one to extend a helping hand; they did not even appear to know me; and then when all<pb n=""/> had scorned me I thought of you my former rival, and I knew you would take me in and give me shelter. I knew you were different from them all, and would grant the forgiveness I asked and smooth my path to the tomb."</p> 
               <p>I bent down and kissed the pale cheeks, and told her as I would a sister how I pitied and wanted to help and love her, and tried to point her to the precious promises of the Gospel. But she only shook her head mournfully and murmured, "too late!" Then she sank into a half slumber from which she roused up wildly murmuring, "Lilian Eveleth-mother, don't, don't hurt me;" then slowly, "they told me she was dead-dead by her own hand, in the asylum." Then again, "Bury me in the church-yard, and sometimes come and look upon my grave. It grows dark! Oh, God! can this be death? Father have mercy oh my soul!" She started, flung her arms up wildly, a heavy moisture gathered on her forehead, there were two or three short, gasping breaths, and the soul of Bertha Eveleth had left its earthly tenement forever. The grey dawn of morning stealing in at the window rested upon a brow bearing the seal of death; a corpse shrouded for the tomb; the stiffened limbs outlined under the snowy linen, the white, tapering fingers folded over the heart that had beat so fiercely, had loved so madly, and suffered so deeply, but pulseless now-<emph>silent forever</emph>; the midnight eyes that had flashed scorn and defiance, or dazzled by their misty splendor her train of worshippers, the proud, curving lips that had sent despair into many a warm young heart that beat for her loyal and true, were powerless now for good or evil-only the beautiful clay remained. Poor child of passion and sorrow, how I pitied her sad fate!</p>

               <p>Summer again-the glad, beautiful Summer. The flowers that I planted with careful hands are blooming over the grave of the dead Bertha, and the trees wave green above the marble bearing the name and age of her who lies beneath. More changes have come with the lapse of time. Mrs. Miller is soon to leave me to occupy the home her son has made ready for her. How can I part with her, my dear, loved friend-my more than mother? And yet I am not sad. My heart echoes the gladness and beauty around. Ah, I am so happy! Claude Irving loves me. He has loved me, he told me, a long, long time. Can it be that such happiness is mine? To-morrow is our wedding day-Jessie's and mine. <emph>Mine, all mine!</emph> Claude, my darling! my own! my own! God grant that I may prove true to the vows I shall take upon myself at the altar! that I may be a help-meet indeed to him, sharing his labors, his joys and sorrows, and when the end shall come, go with him "over the Delectable Mountains," and dwell together amid the glories of the New Jerusalem! This is my earnest prayer, O Father. Amen and Amen!</p>
