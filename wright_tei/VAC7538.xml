INTRODUCTORY.&#xD;
IN giving what follows to the world, no one can be&#xD;
more alive to the fact that this is the latter half of&#xD;
the, nineteenth century, and that the present is&#xD;
emphatically the era of the grandest Utilitarianism,&#xD;
Revolution, Matter-of Fact, and Doubt that the world&#xD;
ever knew, than is the editor of the following extraor-&#xD;
dinary tale. He has no apologies to make for offer-&#xD;
ing it-no excuses, even as a novelist, for departing&#xD;
from the beaten track of "War, Love, Murder, and&#xD;
Revenge," "Politics, Passion, and Prussic acid,"&#xD;
which constitute the staple of the modern novel.&#xD;
Disliking all long exordia, we propose to enter&#xD;
at once upon the work before us, by inquiring: Is&#xD;
there such a thing as real magic-not the ordinary,&#xD;
chemical, angbidextral jugglery, that " passes current&#xD;
among the vulgar as magic-but the real old myste-&#xD;
rious thing, whereof we read in old black-letter&#xD;
tomes?&#xD;
Utterly repudiating the pretensions of modern&#xD;

IV                INTRODUCTORY.                                            hTODC0YV&#xD;
&#xD;
charlatans, and conscienceless impostors, who deal in'&#xD;
"spirit photographs," and utter misty phrases about&#xD;
"Life in the Spheres," " Gloria," and "Jubilo," to-&#xD;
gether with schemes to reform the world-namely,&#xD;
by means of Indiana     divorces, improved   "Lie-&#xD;
ceums," " Air-lying dispatches," via caput Assino-&#xD;
rum, and much other&#xD;
"Canting, radical jabber and jaw,.&#xD;
'Bout Mornia and Hornia, and Starnos and 'Cor,&#xD;
Hocus and pocus, and nong-tong-paw;&#xD;
All stupid crams, not worth a straw."&#xD;
Not because there are no spirits, for one case in a&#xD;
million of reported spectral phenomena, may be true,&#xD;
but all are totally unreliable-that is, they lie-and&#xD;
the person who places the least confidence in them in&#xD;
one thousand instances, is sure to be deceived nine&#xD;
hundred and ninety-nine times, and only reach ap-&#xD;
proximate truth and fact in the thousandth.&#xD;
Spiritualism is yet the great non sequitur of the&#xD;
age, so far as the vast majority of mankind is con-&#xD;
cerned-for while one portion of its phenomena may&#xD;
be really spiritual, the remaining nine hundred and&#xD;
ninety-nine portions are referable to something else&#xD;
than human ghosts. Spiritualism has done no good&#xD;
whatever, save in that it has-called attention to new&#xD;
directions, thereby stimulating the spirit of inquiry ;&#xD;
&#xD;
bat in itself it is yet far from being among the&#xD;
certainties.&#xD;
I here disavow all intention to deride true spirit&#xD;
phenomena, if such there be; nor do I question the&#xD;
transmundane life of man-for the belief in immor-&#xD;
tality is a part of my very being-but, while ignor-&#xD;
ing the claims, and deriding the absurd pretensions&#xD;
of the vast majority of modern Eolists and self-&#xD;
styled mediums, I repeat the question: Is there any&#xD;
positive means or ways whereby even a favored few&#xD;
can penetrate the mysterious veil that hangs like an&#xD;
iron pall between the great human multitude and the&#xD;
infinitely greater BEYOND?2 Is it possible to break&#xD;
through the awful barrier-to glimpse through the&#xD;
Night-Curtain that screens and shrouds us from the&#xD;
Phantom-World ?-if such there be.&#xD;
"Deep the gulph that hides the dead-&#xD;
Long and dark the way they tread."&#xD;
Can we know it? Can we by any possibility scan&#xD;
its secrets ? Nor are we alone in propounding ques-&#xD;
tions such as these ; for every intelligent person, at&#xD;
some period or other, puts them to himself and&#xD;
neighbor, but, in the majority of cases, vainly. The&#xD;
writer hereof, like the great mass of people, has often&#xD;
propounded these queries, the result being a con-&#xD;

THE WONDERFUL STORY OF RAVALETTE.&#xD;

BOOK I.&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE STRANGE MAN.&#xD;
In the most high and palmy days of Rome,&#xD;
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,&#xD;
The graves stood tenantlees, and the sheeted dead&#xD;
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets."&#xD;
AND he sat him down wearily by the side of the road.&#xD;
Wearily, for he had journeyed far that day. He was foot-&#xD;
sore, and his bodily powers were nearly exhausted by reason&#xD;
of the want and privation he had undergone. His looks&#xD;
were haggard, and a pathetic pall, gloomy and tearful, hung&#xD;
and floated around him, invisible to, but sensibly felt by, all&#xD;
who lingered near, or gazed upon him. A sorrowful man&#xD;
was he.&#xD;
And as he sat there by the roadside, he leaned his head&#xD;
upon the staff which he held in his hand ; and as he bowed&#xD;
him down, the great salt tears gushed from between his fin-&#xD;
gers, and watered the ground at his feet. In other days the&#xD;

cypress, plant of sorrow, sprung up there, and throve in sad&#xD;
and mournful beauty, as if to mark and guard the spot&#xD;
whereon the strong man had lifted up his voice and wept&#xD;
aloud--,once upon a time.&#xD;
This was many years ago; and this was the occasion on&#xD;
which I became acquainted with the personage who figures&#xD;
so remarkably in this volume.*  At that time the writer&#xD;
practically accepted, but mentally disbelieved, all t ie li-&#xD;
gious and psychologic faiths of Christendom ; and, had an&#xD;
man even hinted at certain mysterious possibilities that have&#xD;
since then been verified and demonstrated, I should most&#xD;
certainly have laughed in his face, and have reckoned him&#xD;
up as a first-class fool or idiot. Things have changed since&#xD;
then.&#xD;
He was a man of middle height, was neither stout nor&#xD;
slender, but, when in full flesh, was a happy medium between&#xD;
the two. His head and brain were large, and, from certain&#xD;
peculiarities of form, really much more massive than they,&#xD;
appeared. The skull was long and narrow at the base,&#xD;
especially about the ears ; but above that line the brain was&#xD;
deep, broad and high., indicating great powers of endurance,&#xD;
with but moderate physical force, it being clearly apparent&#xD;
that the mental structure sustained itself to a great degree&#xD;
at the expense of the muscles, his nervous system, as in all&#xD;
such organizations, being morbidly acute and sensitive.&#xD;
There was, naturally or organically, nothing about him either&#xD;
* The same personage is the principal character in the romance of "Dhoula&#xD;
Bel, or the Magic Globe," which will ere long be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
PORTRAIT OF THE MAN.          9&#xD;
&#xD;
coarse, brutal, low or vulgar, and if, in the race of life, he&#xD;
exhibited any of those bad qualities, it was attributable to&#xD;
the rough cii-cumstances attendant upon him, and the treat-&#xD;
ment he received from the world. By nature he was open,&#xD;
frank, benevolent and generous to a fault, and of these traits&#xD;
men availed themselves to his sorrow. With abundant&#xD;
capacity to successfully grapple with the most profound and&#xD;
abstruse questions of philosophy or metaphysics, yet this man&#xD;
was totally incompetent to conduct matters of the least busi-&#xD;
ness, requiring even a very moderate financial ability., Such&#xD;
are nature's contradictions, such her law of compensation.&#xD;
As a consequence, this man, with abilities universally con-&#xD;
ceded to be good, was the ready victim of the first plausible&#xD;
knave that came along, from, the "friend " who borrowed&#xD;
half his cash, and undertook to invest the balance--and&#xD;
kept the whole, to the printer of his books, who swindled&#xD;
him of both time and money.&#xD;
His complexion was tawny, resembling that of the Arab&#xD;
children of Beyroot and Damascus. The shape and set of&#xD;
the chin, jaws and lips, were indicative rather of power than&#xD;
force. The mouth, in its slightly protruding upper lip, and&#xD;
two small ridges at the corners, betokened executive ability,&#xD;
passion, courage, affection, humor, firmness and decision.&#xD;
The cheeks were slightly sunken, indicating care and trou-&#xD;
ble, while the cheek-bones, being somewhat high and broad,&#xD;
betrayed his aboriginal ancestry, as did also his general&#xD;
beardlessness, for, save a tuft beneath the chin of jet black&#xD;
silky hair, and a thin and light mustache, he could lay no&#xD;

&#xD;
claim to hirsute distinction. His nose, which had been&#xD;
broken by a fall when a child, was neither large nor small,&#xD;
and as a simple feature, was in no respect remarkable ; but&#xD;
taken with the other features, was most decidedly so, for&#xD;
when under the influence of passion, excitement or emotion,&#xD;
there was an indescribable something about the ale and&#xD;
nostrils that told you that a volcano slumbered in that man's&#xD;
brain and heart, only it required a touch, a vent, in the&#xD;
right direction, to wake its fires and cause it to blaze forth&#xD;
vehemently, transforming him in an instant from a passive,&#xD;
uncomplaining man, into the embodiment of virtuous cham-&#xD;
pionship of the cause that was true, or into a demon of&#xD;
hatred and vindictive fury. The good prevailed : for the&#xD;
evil spasm was ever a spasm only-save in a very few&#xD;
marked cases, where he had suffered wrongs, deep and griev-&#xD;
ous; at the. hands of men whose meanness and duplicity&#xD;
toward himself he only discovered when they had gained&#xD;
their points and ruined him. These men he hated-and yet&#xD;
that word does not convey the true idea. His feeling was&#xD;
not vindictive, but was a craving for, and determination to&#xD;
exact justice for his wrongs. This satisfied, his ill will'died&#xD;
on the instant. His eyes, or rather eye-for one was nearly&#xD;
lost from an accident-was a deep, dark hazel, and such as&#xD;
people are in the habit of describing as jet black. It shone,&#xD;
with a lustre peculiar, and strangely magnetic when he let&#xD;
his soul go forth upon winged words from the rostrum, for&#xD;
he, had been a public speaker in his time, and had won no&#xD;
small degree of fame on that field.&#xD;
&#xD;
PRE-EXISTENCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I^&#xD;
&#xD;
Once seen and heard, this man was one whom it was&#xD;
impossible ever to forget, so different was he from all other&#xD;
men, and so marked and peculiar were his characteristics.&#xD;
Such, in brief, were the externals of the person to whom&#xD;
the reader is here introduced.&#xD;
A very singular man was he-the Rosicrucian--I knew&#xD;
him well. Many an hour, subsequent to that in which he is&#xD;
here introduced, have we sat together beneath the grateful&#xD;
shade of some glorious old elm on the green, flower banks&#xD;
of Connecticut's silver stream, and under some towering&#xD;
dome palm beside the bosom of still older Nilus, in the&#xD;
hoary land of the Pharaohs, of magic and of myth, he all&#xD;
the while pouring into my ear strange, very strange legends&#xD;
indeed-legends of Time and the other side of Time-all of&#xD;
which my thirsty soul drank in as the sun-parched earth&#xD;
drinks in the grateful showers, or the sands of Zin the tears&#xD;
of weeping clouds. And these tales, these legends put to&#xD;
shame the wildest fictions of Germany and the terror-&#xD;
haunted Hartz. Particularly was I struck with a half&#xD;
hint that once escaped his lips, to the effect that some&#xD;
men on the earth, himself among the number, had pre-&#xD;
existed on this sphere, and that at times he distinctly re-&#xD;
membered localities, persons and events that were cotempo-&#xD;
rary with him before he occupied his present ~form, and&#xD;
consequently that his real age exceeded that even of Aha-&#xD;
suerus, the Jew, who, in the dolorous road, mocked the Man&#xD;
of Calvary, as he bore his cross up the steep and stony way,&#xD;
for which leze majeste he was doomed to walk the earth, an&#xD;

HIS MYSTIC SEERSHIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
outcast and vagabond, from that hour till Shiloh comes,&#xD;
according to the legends of Jewry.&#xD;
My friend, during our intimacy, often spoke concerning&#xD;
white magic, and incidentally insisted on his curious doctrine&#xD;
of transmigration. Nor was this all: He taught that the&#xD;
souls of people sometimes vacated their bodies for weeks&#xD;
together, during which they were occupied by other souls,&#xD;
sometimes that of a permanently disembodied man of earth ;&#xD;
at others, that of an inhabitant of the aereal spaces, who,&#xD;
thus embodied, roamed the earth at will. He, when closely&#xD;
questioned, declared his firm belief that he had lived down-&#xD;
through many ages, and that for reasons known to himself,&#xD;
he was doomed to live on, like the great Artefius-that&#xD;
other Rosicrucian-until a certain consummated act (wherein&#xD;
he was to be involuntarily an active party) should release&#xD;
him from it and permit him to share the lot of other men.&#xD;
As a consequence of his dissimilarity from others he ap-&#xD;
peared to have been endowed with certain hyper-mental&#xD;
powers, among which was a strange intro-vision, not the&#xD;
fraudulent clairvoyance claimed and palmed off upon the&#xD;
world by the arch impostor of Poughkeepsie, and others of&#xD;
the same kidney, but something analagous to that attributed&#xD;
to the oracle-priestesses. of Delphos and Delos. This&#xD;
power, which was not always present, enabled him to behold&#xD;
and describe things, persons and events, even across the&#xD;
widest gulfs of ocean; and to read the secret history and&#xD;
thoughts of the most secretive, self-possessed and subtle-&#xD;
minded man as easily as if it were a printed scroll. When&#xD;

this ecstasy was on him he looked as if, at that moment, he&#xD;
beheld things forever sealed from the majority of eyes, and&#xD;
that too both with and without his wonderful magic mirror.&#xD;
At first I doubted his pretensions, mentally referred them to&#xD;
an abnormal state of mind, and, until they were abundantly&#xD;
demonstrated, laughed at the preposterous idea, as I con-&#xD;
sidered it, of any one seriously claiming such extraordinary&#xD;
powers in the middle of the nineteenth century of the Christ-&#xD;
ian era. As previously remarked, his complexion told that&#xD;
he was a sang melie-not a direct cross-but one in which&#xD;
at least seven distinct strains of blood intermingled, if they&#xD;
did not perfectly blend. Save when in high health and&#xD;
spirits, and weather extremely cold-at which times he was&#xD;
pale-his color was a rich, light bronze, like that of the&#xD;
youngsters one sees in such profusion, scampering like mad&#xD;
through the narrow and tortuous streets of Syrio-Arabic&#xD;
cities, demanding "Bucksheesh" from every Frank they see.&#xD;
With his large, broad, high brain, arched and open brow,&#xD;
his massive, elliptical and angular top-head, he was a marked&#xD;
man, and when his soul was at high tide, and his deep and&#xD;
mystic inspirations thrilled and filled him to the brim, his&#xD;
eye beamed with unearthly fire, glowed like the orbs of a&#xD;
Pythoness, and scintillated a light peculiarly its own. Who-&#xD;
ever saw him then never forgot the sight, for he seemed to&#xD;
have the power of glancing instantaneously through the&#xD;
world-Time, space-everything and everywhere. Judging&#xD;
by his speech alone, one would have thought his education&#xD;
might not have been altogether neglected, but that it cer-&#xD;

tainly was of a kind and quality entirely different from that&#xD;
usually received in Christian lands. There was very little,&#xD;
if any, polish about him-not that he lacked urbanity, cour-&#xD;
teousness or smoothness-not that he was rude or rough in&#xD;
any way, but his placidity was that of the river, forest or&#xD;
lake, not that of the boudoir or the schools of politesse.&#xD;
He was extremely enigmatical, and the most so when he&#xD;
appeared most frank in all that pertained to his inner life&#xD;
and world ; and was more sphynx-like to me at the end of&#xD;
ten years' intimacy than on the first day of our acquaintance.&#xD;
He had, though poor, travelled extensively. Oriental in per-&#xD;
sonal appearance and physical tastes, he was still more so in&#xD;
disposition and mind, and in all that pertained to dreamery,&#xD;
philosophy and the affections.&#xD;
With this description of the principal personage of this.&#xD;
narrative, I now proceed to sketch another part of the man.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
HIS EARLY DAYS-THE STRANGE LEGEND.&#xD;
AND there sat the man at the side of the road-sat there&#xD;
mournfully, silently weeping-the strange man !-as if his&#xD;
heart would break, and not from slight cause was he sorrow-&#xD;
ing. Not from present want of food, shelter, or raiment, but&#xD;
because his heart was full, and its fountains overflowing.&#xD;
The world had called him a genius, and as such had petted,&#xD;
praised, admired, and starved him all at once ; but not one&#xD;
grain of true sympathy all the while ; not a single spark of&#xD;
true disinterested friendship. The great multitude had&#xD;
gathered about him as city sight-seers gather round the last&#xD;
new novelty in the museum-a child with two heads, a dog.&#xD;
with two tails, or the Japanese mermaid-duly compounded&#xD;
of codfish and monkey-and then, satisfied with their in-&#xD;
spection, they turned from, and left him in all his deep&#xD;
loneliness and misery, all the more bitter for the transient&#xD;
light of sympathy thrown momentarily upon him. Genius&#xD;
must be sympathetically treated, else it eats its own 'heart,&#xD;
and daily dies a painful, lingering death.&#xD;
Throwing aside all his theories about preexistence, and&#xD;
triple life, as being too recondite for either my readers or&#xD;
myself, we come at once to his natural, matter-of-fact his-&#xD;

tory. At eight years of age he had been christened in the&#xD;
Roman Catholic Church, by the name of Beverly. From his&#xD;
father our hero inherited little save a lofty spirit, an am-&#xD;
bitious, restless nature, and a susceptibility to passional&#xD;
emotions, so great that it was a permanent and positive in-&#xD;
fluence during his entire life. His fifth .year began'and com-&#xD;
pleted the only school education the boy ever had, and for all&#xD;
his subsequent attainments in that direction he was indebted&#xD;
to his own unaided exertions. His father loved him little ; his&#xD;
mother loved him ast he apple of her eye-and all the more&#xD;
because being born with a full and complete set of teeth,&#xD;
old gossips and venerable grey-beards augured a strange and&#xD;
eventful career ; beside which, certain singular spectral visi-&#xD;
tations and experiences of his mother, ere, and shortly after&#xD;
the young eyes opened on the world, convinced her that he&#xD;
was born to no common destiny-much of which has already&#xD;
been detailed at length in "Dhoula Bel : or the Magic&#xD;
Globe." Two or three and twenty years prior to the open-&#xD;
ing of this tale, there lived at what then was No. 70 Canal&#xD;
street, New York city, a woman whose complexion was that&#xD;
of a Mississippi octoroon. She was a native of Vermont,&#xD;
had the reputation of being the most beautiful woman in the&#xD;
State, if indeed she was surpassed anywhere. Her mind was&#xD;
as rich in its stores and resources as her person was in femi-&#xD;
nine graces. Her life up to that time had been a checkered,&#xD;
and in the main, a very unhappy one, for her refinement,&#xD;
nature, education, character and acquirements, were such as&#xD;
to demand a broader, higher, better social sphere than what,&#xD;
&#xD;
TEE MOTHER.&#xD;
&#xD;
from pecuniary want, she now occupied and moved in. An-&#xD;
other cause of unrest was that she was maritally mismatched&#xD;
altogether, for her husband, after years of absence, during&#xD;
which she had deemed him dead, and contracted a second&#xD;
alliance with the father of her boy, had suddenly returned,&#xD;
and never from that moment did she receive one particle of&#xD;
what her heart yearned for-that domestic love and sym-&#xD;
pathy, ever the matron's due, and which alone can render life&#xD;
a blessing, and smooth the rugged, thorny pathway to the&#xD;
tomb.&#xD;
Flora Beverly claimed immediate kindred with the red-&#xD;
skinned sons of the northern wilderness, but that blood in her&#xD;
veins mingled with the finer current derived from her ances-&#xD;
tor, the Cid-a strain of royal blood that in the foretime&#xD;
had nerved noble-souled men to deeds of valor, and fired the&#xD;
souls of Spanish poets to lofty achievements in the rosy fields&#xD;
of immortal song. She had been tenderly reared-perhaps&#xD;
too much so--for her strange and wonderful beauty, flashing&#xD;
out upon the world from her large and lustrous eyes, and&#xD;
beaming forth from every feature and movement, had been&#xD;
such that she had become marked in community from early&#xD;
childhood, and her parents, looking upon her as a special pro-&#xD;
vidence to- them, had unwisely cultured qualities in her that&#xD;
had better have been held in abeyance. By over-care and&#xD;
morbid solicitude they had nearly spoiled God's handiwork,&#xD;
and she grew up an imperious, self-willed, exacting, and sen-&#xD;
sitive queen. She married, and expected to find herself the&#xD;
centre of a realm of unalloyed joy and delight, wherein her&#xD;
&#xD;
16&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7538-00000010"/>&#xD;
reign would be undisputed. The man she wedded took her&#xD;
for her beauty, expecting to realize a perfect heaven in its&#xD;
possession.  Both were bitterly disappointed.  The man&#xD;
could appreciate only the external and superficial qualities&#xD;
and excellences of his wife, while her inner, higher, better&#xD;
self-her soul, was a terra incognita to him, which, like so&#xD;
many other husbands, he never even once dreamed of explor-&#xD;
ing ; he had no idea whatever of the inestimable qualities of&#xD;
her heart, intellect, or spirit, and he had never found out&#xD;
that her body is the least a woman gives away-that she has&#xD;
gifts so regal for the man she loves, that glittering diamonds&#xD;
are sparkless, insipid, valueless in comparison.&#xD;
And so, the first delirious joy-month over, they both began&#xD;
to awaken-the man to the fact that to him his wife was a&#xD;
" very pretty doll," the woman that her husband was-a&#xD;
brute, whose soul slept soundly beneath the coverlets of&#xD;
sense, and herself its victim and minister. It was horrible ;&#xD;
she lost heart, she despised this surface man, and sunk and&#xD;
lost bloom beneath the terrible weight of the discovery and&#xD;
its fearful results. Married, she had expected to move in&#xD;
a sphere very far above that which, by the laws of moral&#xD;
and mental gravity, she was compelled to occupy. Her&#xD;
horizon was henceforth to be bounded by that of her master&#xD;
and his associates. Her husband was vain of his conquest,&#xD;
and one of his greatest joys was found in parading and show-&#xD;
ing off her beautyto the best advantage, like a jockey does&#xD;
a fine horse-and feeling4ockey-like the while, " all this is&#xD;
mine !" Neither himself nor his associates in life could ap-&#xD;

preciate that more than royal loveliness which dwells within&#xD;
the breasts of educated and refined Women-a beauty which&#xD;
eye hath never seen, which eye can never see, but which,&#xD;
like soft and delicate perfume, radiates from such to all who&#xD;
are fine enough to perceive it.&#xD;
As a matter of course, she soon grew weary and disgusted&#xD;
with this surface-life. Feeling that she was unappreciated&#xD;
by the living thousands around her, she, with the true in-&#xD;
stinct of the Indian, spurned their contact, fell back upon&#xD;
herself, and then, with every tendril of her soul, turned and&#xD;
yearned toward the teeming millions of the dead. She in-&#xD;
voked them to her aid, and religiously believed her prayers&#xD;
answered-as I do-and delivering herself up wholly to their&#xD;
weird care and guidance, thenceforward lived a double life&#xD;
-a shadow-life in the world, a real life in the phantom land.&#xD;
True to the natural instinct of the human heart, just in pro-&#xD;
portion as she withdrew from the world, so did she approach&#xD;
that awful veil which is only uplifted for the sons and&#xD;
daughters of sorrow and the starbeam. She became a seer-&#xD;
ess, a dreamer, and, in what to her was an actual, positive&#xD;
communion with the lordly ghosts of the dead nations,&#xD;
whereof, in both lines, her forefathers had been chiefs, she&#xD;
sought that sympathy in her sorrows, and in her strange&#xD;
internal joys-that mysterious balm of healing, which the&#xD;
red man in his religion-or superstition, if you will-believes&#xD;
can only thus and there he had. And she found what she&#xD;
sought, or what to the spontaneous and impulsive soul&#xD;
amounts to the same thing, believed that she had found it.&#xD;

THE HAUNTED HOUSE.           21&#xD;
&#xD;
At first she had some difficulty in correctly translating into&#xD;
her human language of heart and word that which she took&#xD;
to be the low whisperings of the aerial dwellers of the view-&#xD;
less kingdom of MANAToU. She ardently longed for a more&#xD;
open intercourse with the dead, and, as herein stated, as well&#xD;
as i "Dhoula Bel," was gratified.&#xD;
Poor Flora ! half-child of Nature and of Art, was des-&#xD;
tined to bear a child, and that child the man of these&#xD;
volumes--in the very midst of the conditions here sketched,&#xD;
under these conditions he was born.&#xD;
As already stated, beneath this woman's heart there&#xD;
slumbered the fires of a volcano, intense, fervent, quench-&#xD;
less, the result alike of her peculiar ancestry and peculiar&#xD;
training. Her full soul became re-incarnate in the son she&#xD;
bore ; and with it she endowed the child with her own in-&#xD;
tense desire to love and be loved ; all her mystic spirit, her&#xD;
love of mystery ; all her unearthly aspiration toward un-&#xD;
earthly association,; all her resolute, yet half-desponding,&#xD;
quick, impulsive, passionate, generous nature ; all, all, found&#xD;
in him a local habitation and a name, and that name was&#xD;
Genius.&#xD;
Thus moulded came he into the world, doomed from birth&#xD;
to strange and bitter experiences-to face alone and un-&#xD;
friended the bitter blasts of wintry storms, and the burning&#xD;
heats of summer sans; to cling to the hope of speedy death,&#xD;
all the while grasping existence with ten-fold the tenacity&#xD;
of others, yet daily pleading for life-strange contradiction 1&#xD;
-dear life, at the world's stern bar ; pleading daily, yet as&#xD;
&#xD;
often losing his suit, and being by that world sentenced to&#xD;
be utterly cast adrift on the fickle tide of Fate and Chance,&#xD;
and that too with a mind and body acutely sensitive, and&#xD;
constantly at war with each other.&#xD;
Compensation is a universal principle. While so alive to&#xD;
pain, he was equally so to the jouissant emotions, and his de-&#xD;
lights, when they came, were keen, fine, exquisite, to a&#xD;
remarkable degree. As throwing some light on the charac-&#xD;
ter of this man-who is not a myth, but an actual existence&#xD;
--I will here repeat the substance of an account himself&#xD;
gave of his early life and weird and ghostly experiences.&#xD;
He had been questioned in regard to certain powers of an&#xD;
unusual kind attributed to him, and the following reply was&#xD;
elicited :&#xD;
" When I was a very young child, my mother dwelt in a&#xD;
large, sombre and gloomy old stone house on Manhattan&#xD;
Island. At that time New York was about one quarter as&#xD;
large as at present, and that house was a long way out of&#xD;
town. It still stands in the same place, but the city has&#xD;
grown miles beyond it. The building, in times of pestilence,&#xD;
fever, smallpox, and cholera, had been used as a. pest-house,&#xD;
or lazaretto, and in it thousands have died of those dis-&#xD;
eases, and from there, in my fifth' year, the soul of my&#xD;
mother took its everlasting flight.&#xD;
" Scores of people there were ready to testify on oath that&#xD;
the old house was haunted by ghosts, who strode grimly and&#xD;
silently through the solemn, stately halls of that massive&#xD;
island castle. But it generally happened that the witnesses&#xD;

&#xD;
of these spectral visitants had neither time nor inclination to&#xD;
cultivate their acquaintance-save one, an apothecary named&#xD;
Banker, who cursed and swore at one of them on a certain&#xD;
occasion, whereupon the ghost slapped his face, and com-&#xD;
pletely turned and withered his lower jaw by way of punish-&#xD;
ment for the leze majeste. With this exception, those who&#xD;
met one of these ghosts, invariably had urgent business in an&#xD;
opposite direction, and it was quite surprising with what&#xD;
wonderful speed lame persons got over the ground whenever&#xD;
a ghost was declared to be around, by those who being born&#xD;
with a 'caul' over the face, were thereby endowed with the&#xD;
spectre-seeing faculty ; and as such gifted ones could see, I&#xD;
used often to wish I could meet some who had been born&#xD;
with two cauls, so that they might speak to as well as see&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Some people do not believe in ghosts. I do, ghosts of&#xD;
various kinds. I. It is possible to project an image of&#xD;
one's self, which image may be seen by another however dis-&#xD;

nevertheless, ar of so fine texture as to defy the material&#xD;
laws which we are compelled to obey, and who, coming&#xD;
under the operation of those that govern disembodied men,&#xD;
are enabled to do all that they do. VI. I believe that hu-&#xD;

quently call into being spectral harpies-the horrible embo-&#xD;
diment of their evil thoughts. These are demons, subsisting&#xD;
so long as their creators are under the domination of the&#xD;
evil. VII. I believe in a similar creation emanating from&#xD;
good thoughts of good people, lovely out-creations of&#xD;
aspiring souls. Remember these seven. This is a clear&#xD;
statement of the Rosicrucian doctrine of the higher order&#xD;
of their temple. In the lower, these seven pass under the&#xD;
names of Gnomes, Dwarfs, Sylphs, Salamanders, Nereiads;&#xD;

" One day, when I was about five years old, I returned&#xD;
from school, .and found the clayey vestment-the fleshly&#xD;
form of the only friend I ever had,, my mother, cold and&#xD;
prone in the arms of icy cold, unrelenting Death. AhI&#xD;
what a shock was that to my poor little childish heart !&#xD;
She had that morning grown weary of earth, had serenely,&#xD;
trustingly closed her darling eyes, and I was left alone .to&#xD;
battle single-handed against four mighty and powerful ene-&#xD;
mies-Prejudice, Poverty and Organization were three of&#xD;
them. The fourth is almost too terrible, too wild and fanci-&#xD;

THE LEGEND.&#xD;
"Many, very many centuries ago, there lived on the soil&#xD;
where in subsequent ages stood Babylon and Nineveh the&#xD;
first, a mighty king, whose power wacs great and undisputed.&#xD;
He was wise, well-learned and eccentric. He had a daughter&#xD;
lovely beyond all description. She was as learned as she&#xD;

was beautiful. Kings and princes sought her hand in vain ;&#xD;
for her father had sworn to give her to no man save him who&#xD;
should solve a riddle which the king himself would propound,&#xD;
and solve it at the first trial, under penalty of decapitation&#xD;
on failure. The riddle was this, 'What are the three most&#xD;
desirable things beneath the sun, that are not the sun, yet&#xD;
which dwell within the sun ?' Thousands of the gay, the&#xD;
grave, the sage and ambitious who essayed the solution, and&#xD;
failed, left the presence to mount the horse of death.&#xD;
"In the meantime, proclamation was made far and wide,&#xD;
declaring that robes of crimson, chains of gold, the first place&#xD;
in the kingdom and the princess should be the reward of the&#xD;
lucky man.&#xD;
" One day there came to the court a very rich and royal&#xD;
embassy from the King of the South, seeking an alliance,&#xD;
and propounding new treaties ; and among the suite was a&#xD;
young Basinge poet, who acted as interpreter to the embassy.&#xD;
This youth heard of the singular state of things, learned the&#xD;
conditions, and got the riddle by heart. For four long&#xD;
months did he ponder upon and study it, revolving in his&#xD;
mind all sorts of answers, but without finding any that ful-&#xD;
filled the three requisites.-&#xD;
"In order to study more at his ease, the youth was in the&#xD;
habit of retiring to a grotto behind the palace, and there re-&#xD;
peating to himself the riddle and all sorts of possible responses&#xD;
thereto. The princess hearing of this, determined to watch&#xD;
him, and did so. Npw, poets must sing, and this one was&#xD;
- particularly addicted to that sort of exercise ; and he made&#xD;
&#xD;
24               RAVALETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
s&#xD;
&#xD;
it a point to imagine all sorts of perfections as residing in the&#xD;
princess, and he sung his songs daily in the grotto-sung him-&#xD;
self desperately in love with his ideal, and so inflamed the&#xD;
girl herself, who had managed to both see and hear him,&#xD;
herself unseen, that she loved him dearer than life. Here,&#xD;
then, were two people made wretched by a whim.&#xD;
"Love and song are very good in their places,'but, for a&#xD;
steady diet, are not comparable to many other things ; and,&#xD;
as this couple fed on little else, they both pined sadly and&#xD;
rapidly away.&#xD;
" At length, one day, the youth fell asleep in the grotto,&#xD;
and his head rested directly over a fissure in the rock through&#xD;
which there issued a very fine and subtle vapor, which had&#xD;
the effect of throwing the young man in a trance, during&#xD;
which he fancied he saw the princess herself, unveiled, and&#xD;
more lovely than the flowers that bloomed in the king's&#xD;
garden. He also thought he saw an inscription, which bade&#xD;
him despair not, but TRY ! and, at the same time, there&#xD;
flowed into his mind this sentence, which subsequently be-&#xD;
came the watchword of the mystic fraternity which, for some&#xD;
centuries, has been known as that- of the Rosie Cross-&#xD;
'There is no difficulty to him who truly wills.' Along with&#xD;
this there came a solution of the king's riddle, which he re-&#xD;
membered when he awoke, and instantly proclaimed his&#xD;
readiness to attempt that which had cost so many adven-&#xD;
turers their lives.&#xD;
" Accordingly, the grandest preparations-including a man&#xD;
with a drawn blade ready to make the poet shorter by the&#xD;

head if he failed-were made, and, at an appointed hour, all&#xD;
the court, the princess included, convened in the largest hall&#xD;
of the palace. The poet advanced to the foot of the throne,&#xD;
and there knelt, saying, '0 king, live for ever ! What&#xD;
three-things are more desirable than Life, Light and Love?&#xD;
What three are more inseparable ? and what better cometh&#xD;
from  the sun, yet is not.the sun ?  0 king ! is thy riddle&#xD;
answered ?' 'True !' said the king ; 'you have solved it,&#xD;
and my word shall be kept!'   And he straightway gave&#xD;
commands to have the marriage celebrated in royal style,&#xD;
albeit, through the influence of a high court official, he hated&#xD;
poets in general, and this one particularly so, because he&#xD;
thought the young man had foiled him in one of the treaties&#xD;
just made. Now, it so happened that the grand vizier had&#xD;
hoped by some means to get a solution'of the riddle, and&#xD;
secure the great prizes for a young son of his own ; and, as&#xD;
soon as the divan was closed, that very day, he hastened to&#xD;
the closet of the king, and there still further poisoned the&#xD;
mind of his master against the victor, by charging him with&#xD;
having succeeded through the aid of sorcery, which so en-&#xD;
raged the king that he readily agreed to remove the claimant&#xD;
by means of a speedy, secret, and cruel death that very night,&#xD;
to which end the poet was drugged in his wine at the even-&#xD;
ing banquet, conveyed to a couch openly, and almost imme-&#xD;
diately thereafter removed to the chamber allotted to the&#xD;
refractory servants of the court. This apartment was under&#xD;
ground, and. the youth, being thrown violently on the floor,&#xD;
revived, and was astonished to find himself bound hand and&#xD;
&#xD;
foot in presence of the king, his vizier, a few soldiers, and-&#xD;
death ; for he saw at a glance that his days were numbered.&#xD;
He defended himself from the charge of sorcery, but in vain.&#xD;
He was doomed to die, and the order given, when, just as the&#xD;
blow was about to fall, there appeared the semblance of a&#xD;
gigantic hand, moving as if to stay the uplifted blade ; but&#xD;
too late. The sword fell, and, as it reached the neck of the&#xD;
victim, he uttered the awful words, 'I curse ye all who-'&#xD;
the rest of the sentence was spoken in eternity ; but there&#xD;
came -a clamor and a clangor as of a thousand protesting&#xD;
spectral voices, and one of them said, in tones of thunder,&#xD;
' This youth, by persistence of will, had unbarred the gates&#xD;
between tis world and that of mystery. He was the first&#xD;
of his an$ thy race that ever achieved so great an honor.&#xD;
And ye have slain him, and he hath cursed thee, by reason&#xD;
of which thou, 0 king ! and thou, 0 vizier !- and the dead&#xD;

is the dreadful fate to which I was left so pitilessly exposed&#xD;
on the morning that my mother died on Manhattan Island&#xD;
-left to pay the penalty of a crime committed thousands of&#xD;
years ago."&#xD;

CHAPTER III&#xD;
A SPECTRAL VISITANT.&#xD;
IT must be confessed that this was a singular story, and&#xD;
smelled very strongly of either Hartz-mountainism or its&#xD;
equivalent, imagination. He continued his story thus:&#xD;
" I did not know all this at five years old, of course. The&#xD;
only thing I did fully comprehend was the loss of my mother&#xD;
-her strange silence-the woeful look of those who hugged my&#xD;
little head and said 'Poor child!1' I tried hard to be manly&#xD;
and not cry, as they bade me, but it was useless, and the&#xD;
tears welled up in floods from my poor little childish. heart.&#xD;
Have you ever lost a mother ?&#xD;
" As I nestled on the bed where she lay so very still, I&#xD;
asked the bystanding mourners where the talking part of my&#xD;
mother had gone to ? If she would never talk to, love and&#xD;
pet me any more ? and they said 'Never more,' and they&#xD;
repeated that dreadful but. untrue refrain till my poor heart&#xD;
was full almost to bursting, with its load and pressure of&#xD;
grief ; and then I threw myself upon her dear body, and&#xD;
cried till tears refused to flow; for I had lost my mother,&#xD;
sirs-I had lost my mother ! Would that. I could weep&#xD;
now as I did then; it would relieve my over-burdened heart.&#xD;
But I cannot, for the tear fountain seldom thaws. The&#xD;

floods still gather and well up, but they freeze ere they&#xD;
reach the surface, and the heart strings snap and crack, but .&#xD;
they will not break. I wish they would, so that I might&#xD;
join, even for a while, that dear mother whom  I loved&#xD;
so well.&#xD;
" Childhood's griefs are written with a feather, upon warm&#xD;
parchment, with stainless ink ; but the heart's greater woes&#xD;
are burned into the memory with a fiery iron stylus ; the&#xD;
first lines speedily wear away; the last are ineffaceable.&#xD;
As I lay upon the cold breast of my darling mother, a&#xD;
woman said to me, 'Do not cry, poor child ! She is happy&#xD;
now ! She has just gone up, on her way to heaven !&#xD;
And I believed what that woman said ; and I looked out&#xD;
through the deep foliage of the trees hard by ; looked&#xD;
eagerly up into the sky, expecting to see her ascending soul ;&#xD;
and tas- my eye caught the .shadowy fleece of a melting&#xD;
silvery cloud, I thought and believed it to be my mother's&#xD;
sainted soul. I half believe so still ; for as the cloud van-&#xD;
ished into nothingness on the breast of the blue, I distinctly&#xD;
heard a voice, gentle, soft, and sweetly mournful, like unto&#xD;
the dying notes of a wind-harp, lightly touched by the&#xD;
zephyr's breath, whisper in my' ear these words-which at&#xD;
that time I could not fully comprehend-' Lonely one of the&#xD;
ages ! there may be rest for thee in the life thou'rt now&#xD;
commencing. Let thy motto be-TRY ! Despond not, but&#xD;
ever remember that how'bitter soever our lot may be, that&#xD;
despite it all, WE MAY BE HAPPY YET ! Peace,&#xD;
poor child ! Thou'rt watched and guarded by thy mother !'&#xD;
&#xD;
'and the stranger,' added another, and more silvery voice&#xD;
from ,out the deep stillness of that noon-tide heaven. I&#xD;
knew that mystic voice-the first one-arnd felt that it was&#xD;
from beyond Time's threshold. I 'trusted it's sacred words&#xD;
of 'promise, for I had, child as I was, an unshaken faith, an&#xD;
intuition, if you will, that instant flowing to me, that my&#xD;
blessed mother still lived.&#xD;
" From that hour commenced a strange, double existence&#xD;
to and in me. Two instances, perfectly true in all'respects,&#xD;
I will relate, either of which forever settled in my mind that&#xD;
some human beings consciously survive the ordeal of death.&#xD;
Not long after my irreparable loss, I, along with several&#xD;
other children, went to bed in the roof chamber of that&#xD;
dark old house. Something had occurred of a merry turn,&#xD;
and we were all brimful of joy and glee, and our mirth was&#xD;
as loud as it dared be for fear of the'ogres down stairs, who&#xD;
had a bad habit of enforcing silence through the medium of&#xD;
sundry straps and birch twigs. In the very midst of the&#xD;
uproar the bed-clothes were slowly, carefully lifted from off&#xD;
us by agencies totally invisible. We pulled them back ; but&#xD;
again and again they were removed, and the movement&#xD;
was accompanied by a din and clatter, as if fifty cannon&#xD;
balls were rolling on the floor ; and it immediately brought&#xD;
the ogres and their straps from down stairs to see what was&#xD;
the matter. So far as terror permitted we explained,&#xD;
whereupon the ogres looked scaredly wise, readjusted the&#xD;
quilts and retreated. No sooner had they left than the&#xD;
cannon balls began again to roll over the floor, and niuster-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

RAVALETTE.&#xD;
ing courage to rise and grapple for the coverlet, which had&#xD;
again been pulled from us, I clearly and distinctly saw a&#xD;
female figure calmly standing at the foot of the bed, but&#xD;
not upon the floor, for she floated like a vapor on the air.&#xD;
There was but little, if any, light in the room, save that&#xD;
which surrounded, and appeared to emanate from the spec-&#xD;
tral figure. She stood in the midst of a silveryor phos-&#xD;
phoric haze. It was by no means phantasmal in appearance,&#xD;
but so clear, sharp, well defined did the apparition seem,&#xD;
that to this day I remember distinctly the figures on what&#xD;
appeared to be the dress she wore, which fact involves a&#xD;
mystery no psychologist has yet been able to fathom satis-&#xD;
factorily. The children who also saw this sight were terri-&#xD;
fled,; I was not, for I felt she would not harm me, for the&#xD;
reason that mothers love their offspring, and that figure was&#xD;
my mother.&#xD;
" Some considerable time elapsed after this. I had grown&#xD;
into a stout and active boy, having already drifted for some&#xD;
years up and down the world, and once found myself regis-&#xD;
tered as cabin boy on board the brig Phoebe, of New Bed-&#xD;
ford, whereof one Alonzo Baker was captain-not of New&#xD;
Bedford-but the brig.&#xD;
"In this vessel I served for several months, to the satisfac-&#xD;
tion of no one, myself included, being too small, weak and&#xD;
delicate for the arduous duties required of me, and conse-&#xD;
quently had to pay the usual penalty.&#xD;
"Sailors, to a man, are superstitious, though less so now&#xD;
than in the days whereof I am speaking. Still, at present,&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
it is not hard, in spite of the march of intellect, to find&#xD;
sailors who,.between the dog-watch and eight bells, will spin&#xD;
you, a yarn under the weather rail that will 'make a man's&#xD;
hair stand on end like hairs on an enraged kitten.&#xD;
" On board the Phoebe there were several old salts, and&#xD;
many were the tales they told of the' ghosts.of murdered&#xD;
sailors, appearing in the midst of dreadful storms, to encour-&#xD;
age foremast. Jacks, and frighten the souls of guilty mates&#xD;
and captains.; and of course all this tended to deepen the&#xD;
vein of superstition and mysticism  running through me.&#xD;
Often have I been apprised; of the presence and power of the&#xD;
dead or of those who never die, and, when tempted'to share&#xD;
the dangerous pleasures of my older comrades; been: myste-&#xD;
riously saved.&#xD;
" Sailors, like everybody else, are fond of power, and delight&#xD;
in lording it over those whom' chance or accident.places 'in&#xD;
their power ; and .on every vessel there is one man who is&#xD;
sure to be the butt and target for petty tyranny and abuse.&#xD;
On board the Phoebe this fell to my lot.; and not being able&#xD;
to forcibly resist, I- took ,care to hide in my chest about a&#xD;
gallon.of rum, into which about half an ounce-of croton oil,&#xD;
fromr the, medicine chest had previously been poured'-I-&#xD;
labelled the jug 'Poison  Croton oil is the most infamously.&#xD;
active purgative known. The sailors found the. jug, .read the&#xD;
label-didn't believe it-drank the liquor, and were actively&#xD;
engaged fir several. hours thereafter, as,- a consequence.&#xD;

They had no relish for supper that night. They beat me&#xD;

unmercifully, but I was -revenged. Still they abused me,&#xD;
until one day a sailor tweaked my nose in the galley, and for.&#xD;
his pains received half a gallon of hot lard in the waist-band,&#xD;
which troubled him wonderfully. . . At last I meditated&#xD;
suicide as a relief, and, in a paroxysm of rage and despair,&#xD;
such as boys only are subject to, actually ran aft to accom-&#xD;
plish it by leaping over the taffrail into the surging sea,&#xD;
when I was arrested by a narrow blast of warm-almost hot&#xD;
air, which thrilled me to the very centre of my being, and&#xD;
almost pinned me to the deck, while at the same time there&#xD;
flowed into my soul an eloquent and indignant protest against&#xD;
my -supreme folly, accompanied by the spoken words, 'Be&#xD;
patient;! TRY !'&#xD;
" It is impossible to attribute all these things to imagina-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
" One evening, a long time after the occurrence just&#xD;
related, company of ladies and gentlemen, in a house situ-&#xD;
ated near the observatory, Portland, Maine, were conversing&#xD;
upon the general subject of ghosts, and rewards and punish-&#xD;
ments after death. When we sat down there were thirteen&#xD;
persons in the room, and thirteen persons only. We became&#xD;
deeply absorbed in the discussion, indeed so much. so, that&#xD;
the host gave the servant strict orders not to disturb us, and&#xD;
to refuse admission to any person whatever. And thus we&#xD;
all talked freely, the servant seated in the hall, close by the&#xD;
door. No one -was admitted. Presently one person, by&#xD;
* reason of his eloquence and venerable appearance, engrossed&#xD;
all our attention by the thrilling things he told, although he&#xD;
&#xD;
A MYSTERIOUS GUEST.&#xD;
&#xD;
did not join the conversation till over an hour after we had&#xD;
begun it ; nor did his conversation appear at all intrusive.&#xD;
He was the fourteenth person, although we did not realize&#xD;
the fact till we were separating, and he had disappeared.&#xD;
Upon inquiry no one knew him, had ever seen him before,&#xD;
or observed his departure-not even the servant, who&#xD;
declared that for two hours no one had passed him either&#xD;
way. It, was voted 'very strange,' and that for our own&#xD;
credit sake the matter should be 'hushed up ;' but we agreed.&#xD;
to meet again at the same house, that day-week, to discuss&#xD;
the matter, and compare opinions arrived at in the interim."&#xD;

CHAPTER      IV.&#xD;
A VERY STRANGE STORY-ETTELAVAR IV      .&#xD;
" ON the appointed evening a select party of us met pursu-&#xD;
ast to agreement ; but not one had reached a solution of&#xD;
the mystery. In those days the impostor Davis had not&#xD;
foisted his blasphemous absurdities on the world ; nor had&#xD;
his peculiar system of morals made rogues of the one half of&#xD;
his deluded followers, or shameless harlots of the other : nor&#xD;
had lunatic asylums then been packed, as they have since,&#xD;
with sufferers ruined by his teachings ; nor were graveyards&#xD;
dotted with the mounds raised. by weeping friends over loved&#xD;
ones driven to suicide by his doctrines. In those days a&#xD;
man's wife was comparatively safe, nor were divorces half so&#xD;
common as they have since become. In those days husbands&#xD;
did not sneak off to Indiana, and by blank perjury procure&#xD;
divorce in order that they might revel in barefaced, shame-&#xD;
less, open lust with their worthy paramours. In those days&#xD;
spiritualism had not broken in on the world, nor had the&#xD;
goblin philosophy made millions of fools and idiot fanatics&#xD;
out of material that God created for better purposes. In&#xD;
those days Joe Smith had not convinced thousands that har-&#xD;
lotry is the straightest road to heaven; nor had Noyes founded&#xD;
his huge religious brothel in the centre of the State,, con&#xD;
R8&#xD;
&#xD;
THE STRANGE TRANCE.                37&#xD;
taminating the country for leagues around ; and the handy&#xD;
system of ghostology, with its hundred truths and thousand&#xD;
falsehoods, had not then afforded a ready explanation of&#xD;
mysteries such as those I have recounted ; nor had any man&#xD;
dared claim to be the confidential secretary of Almighty&#xD;
God.&#xD;
" On the night in question our conversation became, if pos-&#xD;
sible, more interesting and absorbing than on the first occa-&#xD;
sion, owing to the novel fillip it had then received. So ab-&#xD;
sorbed did I become during the evening, that on one or two oc-&#xD;
-easions I partially lost myself in a sort of semi-mesmeric coma,&#xD;
which gradually deepened as the discussion waxed warmer,&#xD;
until my lower limbs grew cold, and a chilling numbness&#xD;
crept upon me, creating such a terror that I resolved to&#xD;
make my condition known, even at the ;risk of interrupting&#xD;
the discussion.&#xD;
" I made the trial, and found, to my consternation, that I&#xD;
could not utter a syllable-I could not move an inch. Hor-&#xD;
ror ! The company were so engrossed with the matter be-&#xD;
fore them, that no notice was taken of any change that&#xD;
might have been perceptible in me ; nor did one person there&#xD;
suspect that I was not attentively drinking in the discourse.&#xD;
"With inexpressible alarm, I felt that life itself wag fast&#xD;
ebbing from  me, and that death was slowly and surely&#xD;
grasping, clutching, freezing my vitals. I was dying.,. Pre-&#xD;
sently-it appeared as .if a long interregnum had occurred&#xD;
between the last previous conscious moment, and the present&#xD;
instantaneous, but positive agony---a sudden, sharp, tingling&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7538-00000020"/>&#xD;
A STRANGE OCCURRENCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
pang, like that of hot needles thrust in the flesh, shot&#xD;
through my brain. This was followed by a sinking sensation,&#xD;
as if the body had resigned itself to passive dissolution, and&#xD;
then came, with electric rapidity, a succession of the most&#xD;
cruel agonies ever endured 'by mortal man. When it ceased&#xD;
consciousness had ceased also, and I fell to the 'floor as one&#xD;
suddenly dead, to the amazement of the company, as was&#xD;
afterwards declared.&#xD;
"How long this physical inanition lasted, I cannot now&#xD;
say, but during it the spiritual part of me was roused to a&#xD;
tenfold degree of activity, consciousness and power ; for it&#xD;
saw things in a new and cryptic light, and far more distinctly&#xD;
than it ever had through the bodily eyes. An increase of&#xD;
hearing power accompanied this accretion of sight, and I&#xD;
heard a voice, precisely like that heard when my mother&#xD;
died, and when about to throw myself into the sea, which&#xD;
said, 'Awake ! a lesson awaits you ;' and with this there&#xD;
came a partial rousing from the lethargy, and I was led up-&#xD;
stairs and threw myself upon a sofa, mechanically, at the&#xD;
same time fixing my eyes upon the bald white face of a rare&#xD;
old Flemish clock that occupied the entire southern angle&#xD;
of the room. Here I was left alone by my friends, who&#xD;
again resumed their conversation in the parlor below.&#xD;
" Gradually the old clock-face seemed to clarify and ex-&#xD;
pand, until, no longer obstructed by substance, I gazed out,&#xD;
and down, and up, through an avenue of the most astonish-&#xD;
ing1ight I had ever beheld. It seemed to me that I no lon-&#xD;
ger occupied my body, but that, freed from flesh and time, I&#xD;
&#xD;
38&#xD;
&#xD;
EAVALETTE-&#xD;
&#xD;
had become a-denizen of Eternity ; and on a fleecy vapor I&#xD;
was sustained in mid-air by the potent arm of a strange-look-&#xD;
ing old man-the veritable and precise image of him who,&#xD;
ten days before, had occasioned us such a fright by his mys-&#xD;
terious conversations and evanishment. He told me not to&#xD;
fear, but to repose implicit confidence in myself and him ;&#xD;
that he would not injure me, but do me good : that his name&#xD;
was Ettelavar : that his years were-ages long ; that'he was&#xD;
the companion of those who die-who die, and live again-&#xD;
and of those who never taste of death. All this, and more,&#xD;
he told me; and he said that his design was to serve both him-&#xD;
self and me ; that he was familiar with certain mighty secrets,&#xD;
that had been claimed to be possessed,'through many ages,&#xD;
by the wise and learned of earth-the Narek El Gebel, the&#xD;
Hermetists, the Pythagoreans, the three temples of the Rosie&#xD;
Cross, the medieval and modern Rosicrucians, and the scat-&#xD;
tering delvers after -mystery in all ages, times, and places.&#xD;
He said that among the things that I might learn from him,&#xD;
were the priceless secret of compounding the Elixir of Life,&#xD;
the drinking of which, by mortals, would confer perpetual&#xD;
youth and surprising beauty. Then there was the Lethean&#xD;
Draught, and whomsoever drank thereof, forthwith forgot&#xD;
all care, was oblivious to all that concerned the Future, and&#xD;
lived intensely in the' Present. Then there was"the Water&#xD;
of Love, and whoever drank thereof became irresistibly mag"&#xD;
netic to the opposite sex, and could kindle affection in Ythe&#xD;
heart of ice by mere personal presence. Then there was the&#xD;
Wondrous Stone of the Philosophers, not capable of trans-&#xD;

muting, by a touch, whole tons of grossest substance into&#xD;

was the Magic Crystal Ball, in which the gazer could behold&#xD;
whatever he wished to, that was then transpiring on this&#xD;
earth, or any of the planets. 'All this;knowledge,' said he,&#xD;
'I will expound to you, on certain conditions to be hereafter&#xD;
mentioned.'&#xD;
"I relate these things in the briefest possible manner, and&#xD;
make no allusions to my feelings during the time I listened&#xD;
to the strange being, Ettelavar, further than to remark, that&#xD;
during the-temptation, shall: it be called ?-I seemed to be&#xD;
hovering in the aerial expanse, and realized a, fullness and&#xD;
activity of life never realized before, and knew .for the first.&#xD;
time what it was to be a human being. My freed spirit&#xD;
soared away into the superincumbent. ether, and :far, very.:&#xD;
far, beneath us rolled thegreat revolving globe ; while far'&#xD;
away in the black inane, twinkled myriads of fierysparks--&#xD;
the starry eyes of God, looking through the tremendous-vault&#xD;
of Heaven. Picture to yourself .a soul, quitting earth,. per-:&#xD;
haps forever, and hovering over it like a gold-erested cloud,;&#xD;
at set ofsun, when all the winds are hushed to sleep on the.&#xD;
still and loving bosom of its protecting God, and' thine !.&#xD;
"By tlie exercise of a.power to me unknown, Ettelavar&#xD;
arrested our motion, and the cloud on which we seemed to-&#xD;
float stood still in mid-air, and he said to me, ' Look .and&#xD;
learn 1'&#xD;
"Like busy insects in the, summer sun, afar. off in the&#xD;
distance I beheld large masses of human beings toiling wea-&#xD;

THE VISION.&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
rily up a steep ascent, over the summit of which there&#xD;
floated heavily, thick, dense, murky, gloom-laden clouds.&#xD;
Crimson and red on their edges were they, as if crowned&#xD;
with thunder, and their bowels overcharged with lightnings ;&#xD;
and their sombre shadows fell upon the plains below, heavy&#xD;
and pall-like, even as shrouds on the limbs of beauty, or the&#xD;
harsh critic's' sentence upon the first fruits of budding and&#xD;
aspiring genius. 'It is nothing but a crowd,' said I ; and&#xD;
the being at my side repeated, as if in astonishment, 'No-&#xD;
thing but a crowd ? Boy, the destinies of nations centre in&#xD;
a crowd. Witness Paris. Look again!I' Obeying mechan-&#xD;
ically, I did so, and soon beheld a strange commotion among&#xD;
the people ; and I heard a wail go up--a cry of deep an-&#xD;
guish-a sound heavily freighted with human woe and&#xD;
agony. I shuddered.&#xD;
" On the extreme apex of the mountain stood a colossal&#xD;
monument, not an obelisk, but a sort of temple, perfect in&#xD;
its proportions and magnificent to the view. This edifice&#xD;
was surmounted by a large and highly polished golden&#xD;
pyramid in miniature. On all of the faces of this pyramid&#xD;
was inscribed the Latin word FELIcITAS ; I asked for an&#xD;
explanation from my guide, but instead of giving it, he&#xD;
placed his air-like hand upon my head, and drawing it gently&#xD;
over my brow and eyes, said, 'LookI'&#xD;
" Was there magic in his touch ? It really seemed so,&#xD;
for it increased my visual capacity, fifty-fold, and on again&#xD;
turning to the earth beneath me, I found my interest almost&#xD;
painfully excited by a real drama there and then enacting.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7538-00000022"/>&#xD;
]AVALETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was clearly apparent that the great majority of the people&#xD;
were partially, if not wholly blind ; and I observed that one&#xD;
group, near the centre of the plain below the mountain,&#xD;
appeared to be under much greater excitement than most of&#xD;
the others,'and their turbulence appeared to result from the&#xD;
desire of each individual to reach a certain golden ball and&#xD;
staff which lay on a cushion of crimson velvet within the&#xD;
splendid open-sided monument on the mountain. In the&#xD;
midst of this lesser crowd, energetically striving to reach the&#xD;
ascending path, was one man who seemed to be endowed&#xD;
with far more strength and resolution-not of body, but of&#xD;
purpose--than those immediately around him. Bravely he&#xD;
urged his way toward the mountain's top, and, after almost&#xD;
incredible efforts, succeeded. Exultingly he. approached the&#xD;
temple, by his side were hundreds more ; he outran them,&#xD;
entered, reached forth to seize the ball and sceptre--it&#xD;
seemed that the courageous man must certainly succeed--&#xD;
his fingers touched the prize, a smile of triumph illumined his&#xD;
countenance, and then suddenly went out in the blight of&#xD;
death, for he fell to the earth from a deadly blow, dealt by&#xD;
one treacherous hand from behind, while others seized and&#xD;
hurled him down the steep abyss upon which the temple&#xD;
abutted, and he was first dashed to pieces and then tram-&#xD;
pled out of existence by the iron heels of advancing thou-&#xD;
sands--men who saw but pitied not, rather rejoicing that&#xD;
one rival less was- in existence.&#xD;
q'Is it possible,' cried I, internally, 'that -such hell-broth&#xD;
of vindictiveness boils in human veins ?'&#xD;
&#xD;
42&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Alas, thou seest !' replied Ettelavar, by my side.&#xD;
' Learn a lesson,' said he, 'from what you have seen. Fame&#xD;
is a folly, not worth the having when obtained.  ' Felicitas'&#xD;
is ever ahead, never reached, therefore not to be looked for.&#xD;
Friendship is an empty name, or convenient cloak which&#xD;
men put on to enable them to rob with greater facility. No&#xD;
man is content to see another rise, except when such rising&#xD;
will assist his own elevation ; and the man behind will stab&#xD;
the man in front, if he stands in his way. Human nature is&#xD;
infantile, childish, weak, passionate and desperately depraved,&#xD;
and as a rule, they are the greater villains who assume the&#xD;
most sanctity ; they the most selfish who prate loudest of&#xD;
charity, faith and love. I begin my tutelage by warning,&#xD;
therefore arming you, against the world and those who con-&#xD;
stitute it. If you wish to truly rise, you must first .learn to&#xD;
put the world and what it contains at its proper value.&#xD;
Remember, I who speak am Ettelavar. Awake!'&#xD;
" Like the sudden black cloud in eastern seas, there came&#xD;
a darkness before me ; my eyes opened, and fell upon the old&#xD;
clock face. Its hands told me that it was exactly thirteen&#xD;
minutes since I had marked the hour on the dial. Since&#xD;
that hour I have had much- similar experience, and it is this&#xD;
that affords ground for the unusual powers in certain respects,&#xD;
not claimed by, but attributed to me."  .    .    .&#xD;
Such was the substance of the young man's narrative, in&#xD;
answer to questions propounded to him long before the date&#xD;
at which he is introduced to the reader.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
LOVE. EULAMPIA-THE BEAUTIFUL.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE golden sun was setting, and day was sinking beneath&#xD;
his crimson coverlets in the glowing west. The birds, on&#xD;
thousand green boughs, were singing the final chorus of the&#xD;
summer opera ; the lambs were skipping homeward in the&#xD;
very excess of joy ; while the cattle on the hills lowed and&#xD;
bellowed forth their thanksgiving to the viewless Lord of&#xD;
Glory. Man alone seemed unconscious of his duty and the&#xD;
blessings he enjoyed. Toil-weary farmers were slowly plod-&#xD;
ding their way supper and bed-ward, and all nature seemed&#xD;
to be preparing to enjoy her bath of rest. Still sat the wan-&#xD;
derer by the highway side ; still fell his tears upon the&#xD;
grateful soil ; and as the journeyers home and tavern-ward&#xD;
passed him by, many were the remarks they made upon him,&#xD;
careless whether he heard them or not. Some in cruel,&#xD;
heartless mockery and derision, some few in pity, and all&#xD;
in something akinto surprise, for men of his appearance were&#xD;
rarely seen in that neighborhood. At last there came along&#xD;
three persons, two of whom were unmistakably Indiaus, and&#xD;
the third, a girl of such singular complexion, grace, ferm, and&#xD;
* Romaic - EvXapffa --Eulampia - Evlamb.ah. " Bright-shining."-Lovely,&#xD;
mystically beautiful.&#xD;

&#xD;
extraordinary facial beauty, it was extremely difficult to&#xD;
ethnologically define what she was. This girl was about&#xD;
fourteen ; the boy who accompanied her and the grey-haired&#xD;
old Indian by her side, was apparently about twelve years&#xD;
old. This last was the first to notice the stranger.&#xD;
"Oh, Evlamb6a," said he, "see ! there's a man crying, and&#xD;
I'm going to help him !" The boy spoke in his own verna-&#xD;
cular, for he was a full blood of the Oneida branch of the&#xD;
Mohawks, fearless, honorable, quick, impulsive, and generous&#xD;
as sunlight itself. To see distress and fly to its relief was&#xD;
but a single thing for him, and used to be with his people&#xD;
until improved and " civilized " with bad morals and worse&#xD;
protection. The Indian was Ki-ah-wah-nah (The Lenient and&#xD;
Brave) chief of the Stockbridge section of the Mohawks.&#xD;
The girl, Evlambda, nominally passed for his grandchild, but&#xD;
such was not the case, for although she might well be taken&#xD;
for a fourth blood, she really had not a trace of Indian about&#xD;
her, further than the costume, language, and general educa-&#xD;
tion and habit. Her name was modern Greek, or Romaic,&#xD;
but her features and complexion no more resembled that of&#xD;
the pretty dwellers on Prinkipo or the shores of the Bos-&#xD;
phorus, than that of the Indians or Anglo Saxon. Many&#xD;
years previous to that day, this girl, then a child of three or&#xD;
four months age, had been brought to the chief and left in&#xD;
his care for a week, by a woman clad in the garb of, and be-&#xD;
longing to a wandering band of gipsies, who, attracted by&#xD;
the universal reputation of the New World, had left Bohemia&#xD;
and crossed the seas to reap a golden harvest. This band&#xD;

THE MEETING.47&#xD;
&#xD;
RAVALETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
had held its headquarters for nearly a year on Cornhill,&#xD;
Utica, whence they had deployed about the country a cir-&#xD;
cle whose radius averaged one hundred and twenty miles.&#xD;
The woman never came back to claim the child, for the&#xD;
members of the band suddenly decamped after having&#xD;
financiered a gullible old farmer out of several thousands&#xD;
of dollars in gold, which they had persuaded him it was&#xD;
necessary that he should put in a bag and bury in the ground&#xD;
at a certain hour of a certain night, in order to the speedy&#xD;
discovery of a large mine of diamonds that was certainly&#xD;
upon his farm, and would as surely be brought to light when&#xD;
the gold was exhumed after a certain time, which time was&#xD;
quite long enough for the band to dig up the gold and&#xD;
disperse in all directions, to meet again three thou-&#xD;
sand miles away.  This bit of Cornhill swindling was con-&#xD;
sidered rather sharp practice, even for that locality, and&#xD;
ended by shrouding;the girl in an impenetrable mystery, and&#xD;
giving to the old- chief a child, who, as she expanded ,and&#xD;
grew up became quite as dear to his heart as any one of his&#xD;
own offspring ; and in fact, by reason of her superior intelli-&#xD;
gence, she became far more so, for mind ever makes itself&#xD;
felt and admired. Not one of the ethnological, physical, moral,&#xD;
or mental characteristics which mark the Romany tribes was&#xD;
to be noticed in this girl, and wise people concluded that she&#xD;
had somewhere been stolen by the woman, who from fear or&#xD;
policy had left her to her fate and the godd old Indian's care.&#xD;
Esthetics is not my forte, hence I shall not attempt to&#xD;
describe the young girl. The name she bore was marked on&#xD;
&#xD;
her clothing in Greek letters, which were afterwards rendered&#xD;
into English by a professor of a college whose assistance had&#xD;
been asked by the Indian.&#xD;
Besides being known far and near as the most beautiful&#xD;
girl of her age, she was also distinguished as by far the most&#xD;
intelligent. She was undisputed queen on the Reservation,&#xD;
not by right, but by quiet usurpation. She looked and acted&#xD;
the born Empress, and her triplicate sceptre consisted of&#xD;
kindness, intelligence, and that nameless dignity and presence&#xD;
inherent in truly noble souls.&#xD;
Such was the bright-shining maiden, who, acted by&#xD;
the boy's cry and actions, now crossed over to the side of&#xD;
young Beverly. Observing his sorrowful appearance, she&#xD;
placed her soft hand tenderly upon his head, and said in&#xD;
tones heart-felt and deeply sympathetic, " Man of the heavy&#xD;
heart, why weep you here ? Is your mother just dead ?"&#xD;
The young man raised his head, saw the radiant girl before&#xD;
him, and, after a moment's hesitation, during which he shud-&#xD;
dered as if at some painful memory, murmuring, "No ; it&#xD;
cannot be possible !-cannot be-in this part of the world,&#xD;
too ! no !" he replied to her, saying, " Girl, I am lonely, and&#xD;
that is why I weep. I am but a boy, yet the weight of years&#xD;
of grief rest on and bear me down. To-day is the anniver-&#xD;
sary of my mother's death, and, when it comes, I always pass&#xD;
it in tears and prayer. Since she went home to heaven, I&#xD;
have had no true friend, and my lot and life are miserable in-&#xD;
deed. Men call themselves my friends, and prove it by rob-&#xD;
bing me. Not long ago, there came a man to me-he was&#xD;

very rich-and said, 'People tell me that you are very skillful&#xD;
with the sick. Come ; I have a sister whom the physicians say&#xD;
must die. - I love her. You are poor ; I am rich. Save her ;&#xD;
gold shall be yours.' I went. She was beyond the reach of&#xD;
medicine, and it was pos bible to prolong her life only in one&#xD;
of two ways-either by the transfusion of blood from my&#xD;
veins to her own, or by the transfusion of life itself. I was&#xD;
young and strong, and we resolved to adopt the latter alter-&#xD;
native, as being the only possibly effective one ; and for&#xD;
months, during three years, I sat beside that poor sick girl,&#xD;
and freely let her wasted frame draw its very life by magneti-&#xD;
cally sapping my own. Finally, I began to sink with ex-&#xD;
haustion and disease similar to her own, and, to save my life,&#xD;
was forced to break the magnetic cord, and go to Europe.&#xD;
As soon as it was severed she sunk into the grave, and then&#xD;
I returned, and received a considerable sum of money in the&#xD;
nature of a loan. This favor was granted me as a reward&#xD;
for my pains, time, and ruined health. I was to return it&#xD;
from the proceeds of a business to be immediately established.&#xD;
At that time I resolved to purchase a little home for those&#xD;
who depended on my efforts for the bread they ate, and so&#xD;
wrote to a man who called himself my friend, but who is the&#xD;
direct cause of most of the evil I have for ten years experi-&#xD;
enced. This fellow pretended to deal in lands. I put nine&#xD;
hundred dollars-half I had in the world--in this man's&#xD;
hands, to purchase a fine little place of a few acres, which&#xD;
place he took me to see. I was pleased with it, and saw a&#xD;
home for those who would be left behind me when I was dead,&#xD;
&#xD;
A few days thereafter this ghoul came to me again, and re-&#xD;
presented that gold bullion being down he could make con-&#xD;
siderable profit for me in three days, would I make the&#xD;
investment. I handed over the remainder of my money.&#xD;
The three days lengthened into years. Instead of being a&#xD;
capitalist he was a bankrupt-was not in the gold business,&#xD;
and had no more control of the land he showed me than he&#xD;
had of Victoria's crown. Meantime, my furniture was seized ;&#xD;
I lost my name with the friend who advanced the sum ; I&#xD;
became ill, and, in my agony, called this man a swindler. To&#xD;
silence me, he gave me a check on a bank. I presented it.&#xD;
'No funds I' And yet he dared call himself an honest man.&#xD;
'You have but to u say the harsh things said about me,' said&#xD;
this semblance of a an to me one day, 'and I am ready to&#xD;
pay you everythg I owe.' My mind was unsettled ; I&#xD;
listened to him, and the result was that, by duplicity and&#xD;
fraud, more mean and despicable than the first, if there be a&#xD;
depth of villainy more profound, he obtained my signature to&#xD;
an acknowledgment that the money of which he had openly&#xD;
swindled me, then in his hands, was 'a friendly loan.' And&#xD;
then he laughed, 'Ha ! ha!1' and he laughed, 'Ho ! ho!1' at&#xD;
me and my misery, and actually suffered a child in our family&#xD;
to perish and wretchedly die for the want of food and medi-&#xD;
cine. But then he told me that he had buried it properly,&#xD;
respectably, up there in the cemetery, and it was the only&#xD;
truth I ever heard from his lips, But then he sent the&#xD;
funeral bills for me to pay-all the while laughing at my&#xD;
misery"--while the lordly house he occupied was redeemed&#xD;

luxuriously every day on what was the price of    heart's&#xD;

my blood. I still have the memory of a dead child, up there&#xD;
in the cemetery. Poor starved child !  It is no satisfaction&#xD;
to me to know that this man will die-a disgraced pauper, de-&#xD;

do that the brothel and the gibbet, the gambling hell and&#xD;
massive prisons, are shadowed in the foreground of his line,&#xD;
and that it will utterly perish from off the earth in ignominy&#xD;
and horror. I would not have it so, but fate is fate ; and I&#xD;
see at least, one dangling form of his race swinging in the&#xD;

As the men uttered these terrible sentences, he shuddered&#xD;
'as if -horror-stricken at the impending fate of this wronger of&#xD;

would have freely averted the doom, had such a thing been&#xD;

" We may all be happy yet," said she,; "for the Great Spi-&#xD;

and, she threw, by a toss of the head, her lon  black seaof&#xD;

faith and hope, as if her upturned eyes met God's glance from&#xD;
Heaven. The old chief and the boy at his side said nothing,&#xD;
but each instinctively folded his hands in the attitude of con-&#xD;
fidence and prayer. The combined effect of all this upon the&#xD;
young man was electric. The singular incident struck him&#xD;
so forcibly that he rose to his feet, placed his hand upon the&#xD;
girl's head, uplifted his eyes and voice to heaven, and, from&#xD;
the depths of his soul, responded " Amen, and Amen."&#xD;
It was at this critical instant that I, the editor of these&#xD;
papers, chanced to come up to where this scene was being&#xD;
enacted. A few words sufficed for an introduction, and on&#xD;
that spot begun a friendship between us all that death him-&#xD;
self is powerless to break.&#xD;
Two hours thereafter, the chief, his son, the girl, the youth,&#xD;
were, with myself, partaking of a friendly meal at the old&#xD;
man's house. After the repast was over, the conversation&#xD;
took a philosophic turn, in which the chief, who was a really&#xD;
splendid specimen of the cultivated Indian, took an active and&#xD;
interested part.&#xD;
Presently the old people took their pipes, the younger ones&#xD;
went to bed, and Beverly and 'Levambea, as she was almost&#xD;
universally called, walked out, and sat them down beneath an&#xD;
old sycamore that stretched its giant limbs like the genius of&#xD;
protection over the cottage. There they talked gaily enough&#xD;
at first, but presently in a tender and pathetic strain ; and it&#xD;
was clear that there had sprung up between them already&#xD;
something much warmer than friendship, yet which was not&#xD;
love. When they rose to enter the house, the last words&#xD;
&#xD;
52&#xD;
&#xD;
52                                                                                                   53&#xD;
&#xD;
53&#xD;
&#xD;
uttered by the girl-uttered in the same singularly inspired&#xD;
strain observed on their first meeting-were, "Yes! Iwill&#xD;
love you ; but not here, not now, perhaps not on this earth.&#xD;
Yet I will be your prop, your stay, though deep eas between&#xD;
us roll. Listen ! When I am in danger you will know it,&#xD;
wherever you may be. When you are in danger you will see&#xD;
me. Forget not what I say. Ask me no questions. Your&#xD;
fate is a singular one, but not more so than my own. Good&#xD;
night !  Good-bye ! We will see each other no more at&#xD;
present--it is not permitted!"  And without another word&#xD;
the abruptly left him, darted into the house, passed up the&#xD;
stairs, and was gone like a spirit.&#xD;
Next day, at the solicitation of the chief and others who&#xD;
took an interest in young Beverly, he consented to go with&#xD;
me to my home, many leagues from that spot ; and, accord-&#xD;
ingly, in due time we arrived there, and for several months he&#xD;
was an inmate of my house ; and, while under the shadow of&#xD;
ill health and its consequent sympathetic state, I became in-&#xD;
timate with many of the loftier and profound secrets of the&#xD;
celebrated Rosicrucian fraternity, with which he was familiar&#xD;
and which he gave me liberty to divulge to a certain exent,&#xD;
conditioned that I forbore to reveal the locality of the lodges&#xD;
of the Dome, or indicate the persons or names of its chief&#xD;
officers, albeit, no such restriction was exacted in reference to&#xD;
the lesser temples of the order--covering the first three de-&#xD;
grees in this country-to the acolytes of which the higher&#xD;
lodges are totally unknown. Oh ! how often have I sat beside&#xD;
him, on the green banks of a creek that ran through my little&#xD;

famm and raptly listened to the profoundest wisdom, the 0most&#xD;
eQalted conceptions and descriptions of the soul, its origin,&#xD;
nature, powers, and its. destinies-listened to metaphysical&#xD;
speculations that fairly racked my brain to comprehend, and&#xD;
all this from the lips of a man totally incapable of grappling&#xD;
successfully with the money-griping world of barter and of&#xD;
trade. Here was the most tremendous contradiction, in one&#xD;
inan, that I had ever known or heard of. One who revelled&#xD;
in mental luxuries fit for an angel, yet had not forecast&#xD;
enough to foil a common trickster ;-who blindly, and for&#xD;
years, reposed his whole trust in one whose sole aim was to&#xD;
rob him not only of his little competence, but of his character&#xD;
as a man-who suffered one near and dear to him to starve,&#xD;
literally, starve to death, and then be buried, at the very&#xD;
moment that himself and his were luxuriating on the very&#xD;
money for which that man had bartered health, and almost&#xD;
lif .itself.! Was it not very singular ?  I have wondered,&#xD;
ne and again, how such things could be, and intensely :so&#xD;
when be has been revealing to me some of the loftier mysteries&#xD;
of the Order ; when talking of Apollonius of Tyanae, the&#xD;
Platonists, the elder Pythagoreans ; of the Sylphs, Sala pan-&#xD;

Cabalistic Light ; of Hermes Trisuegistus, and the Sarag-&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
NAPOLEON III. AND THIE ROSICRUCIANS-AN EXTRAORDINARY&#xD;
MAN AND AN EXTRAORDINARY THEORY.&#xD;
BEVERLY continued his very singular narrative, saying :-&#xD;
"You have already been informed of the singular doom that&#xD;
hangs over me-that I am condemned to perpetual transmi-&#xD;
grations, unless relieved by a marriage with a woman in&#xD;
whom not one drop of the blood of Adam circulates-and&#xD;
even then, the love must be perfect and mutual. Thus my&#xD;
chance is about as one in three hundred and ninety-six bil-&#xD;
lions against, to a single one for me. This doom has&#xD;
brought around me, as it did around others before me, cer-&#xD;
tain beings, powers, influences, and at length I became a&#xD;
voluntary adept in the Rosicrucian mysteries and brother-&#xD;
hood. How, when, or where I was found worthy of initia-&#xD;
tion, of course I am not at liberty to tell ; suffice it that I&#xD;
belong to the Order, and have been-by renouncing certain&#xD;
things-admitted to the companionship of the living, the dead,&#xD;
and those who never die ; have been admitted to the famous&#xD;
Derishavi-Laneh, and am familiar with the profoundest secrets&#xD;
of the Fakie-Deeva Records ; and through life have had ever&#xD;
three great possibilities before me : one of these-I being a&#xD;
neutral soul-is that of becoming after death a chief of a su-&#xD;
&#xD;
preme order, called the Light ; or of its opposite, called the&#xD;
Shadow-to Which I am tempted by invisible, but potent agen-&#xD;
cies ; and the third of which is.the one I dread most-the per-&#xD;
petuation of the doom to wander the earth for ages, in various&#xD;
bodies, as the result of the curse pronounced by a dying man&#xD;
ages ago, as you already have been told, unless I be redeemed&#xD;
by a true marriage with a woman in whom not one drop of&#xD;
the blood of Adam circulates. I desire to avoid all three&#xD;
if possible, and to share the lot of other men.&#xD;
" I have another mysterious thing to relate to you.&#xD;
Doubtless you recollect that the curse was uttered by the&#xD;
young poet-and that the mysterious voice heard in the dun-&#xD;
geon where he was slain, declared that thenceforth, until the&#xD;
doom was fully accomplished, this youth during all his ages&#xD;
should be Known as the Stranger. Well, in the course of&#xD;
the centuries that rolled away, this Stranger became a mem-&#xD;
ber of an august Fraternity in the Heavens, known as the&#xD;
Power of the Light. You know, also, that I, who was the&#xD;
:king, incurred the penalty of wandering till relieved; and&#xD;
you are also aware that him who was the Vizier was sen-&#xD;
tenced to- a singular destiny under the name of Dhoula Bel.&#xD;
Welly.e also became an active'member of a vast Associa-&#xD;
tion in the Spaces, known as the Power of the Shadow.&#xD;
This is but one half of the mystery, for it became the object&#xD;
-of both Dhoula Bel and the Stranger-,who both knew that&#xD;
in my: birth from the woman Flora-years before I under-&#xD;
went my present incarnation-that I would be in every re-&#xD;
spect a Neutral man  ; one having no tendencies. whatever,&#xD;

naturally, to either good or evil, abut only toward .AAu&#xD;
RENT ;, and as such neutral man, it became possible to forego&#xD;
-my doom, and to become supreme chief of either of -the Or-&#xD;
-ders named ; hence both Dhoula Bel and the Stranger, be-&#xD;
side their original, have the strong additional motive of mak-&#xD;
ing me subservient to their loftier views ; and to achieve it,&#xD;
they frequently attend me in visible and invisible shapes-&#xD;
tempting, nearly ruining, and as often saving me from dan-&#xD;
gers worse than death itself-in what way has already been&#xD;
partly told, and will be hereafter seen.&#xD;
" In one of my frequent sojourns in Paris, I became ac-&#xD;
Iqainted with a few reputed Rosicrucians, and after sounding&#xD;
their depths, found the water very shallow, and very muddy&#xD;
-=as- had been the case with those I met in London--Bul-&#xD;
wer, Jennings, Wilson, Belfedt, Archer, Socher, Corvaja, and&#xD;
-other pretended adepts--like the Hitchcocks, Kings, Scotts,&#xD;
and others of that ilk, on American soil. At length, there&#xD;
came an invitation from Baron Dft, ornme to attend,&#xD;

-the reputation I gained on that occasion, but a few days&#xD;

wards became the Duke de Malakoff, if they would submit&#xD;
to a trial of mesmerism by either of the three professors of&#xD;
the art, named.  They declined;-whereupon the Emperor&#xD;
speaking aloud, asked 'if any of the company were willing&#xD;
to test, in their own persons, thevaunted powers of his ex-&#xD;
cellency, the Italian Count ?' whose methods ,of inducing his&#xD;
magnetic marvels differed altogether from those uspall&#xD;
adopted; -,inasmuch as he, like Boucicault, the actor, in his&#xD;
famous play-'The Phantom'-makes no passes,. scarcel&#xD;
glances for an instant at his subjects, and invariably looks&#xD;
away from, not toward them. Now, it is a well-known fact&#xD;
that everybody believes everybody else, save themselves, sub-&#xD;
ject to mesmeric influence, as is often demonstrated at the&#xD;
weekly seances of the Magnetic Society, held in the Rue&#xD;
Grenelle St. Honoree&#xD;

"At the date of this Imperial Seance, spiritualism  had&#xD;
not yet made public pretensions in France, and although the&#xD;
Scotch trickster, Daniel fHume, had crossed the Atlantic,&#xD;
and was at that time living at Cox's, in Jermyn street, Pica-&#xD;
dilly, London-yet he had not then obtained the notoriety&#xD;
that subsequently became his, nor had half Europe ran after&#xD;
those in whose presence tables tipped by heel, toe, and genu-&#xD;
ine spirit power. Of course, then, spiritual phenomena, so&#xD;
called, being then under bann, it could not be, and was not&#xD;
depended on as a means of explaining what there and then&#xD;
took place.&#xD;
"'With great pleasure,' said the Count, in reply to a re-&#xD;
quest to exhibit his power. 'With great pleasure, your&#xD;
majesty,' and forthwith he turned and looked straight into&#xD;
a massive mirror that occupied the entire space between two&#xD;
windows of the saloon. As he spoke it struck me that,&#xD;
somewhere, at some time, I had met this Italian Rosicrucian,&#xD;
but where, for the life of me, I could not tell ; yet I was&#xD;
certain that I had heard that voice, and still more certain&#xD;
that I had beheld that strange, sweet smile.&#xD;
The Count's position before the mirror was such that, sup-&#xD;
posing his eye had been a flaire, the reflected rays would&#xD;
strike the forehead of one of the company fairly in the cen-&#xD;
tre. The person upon whom it struck had not the least sus-&#xD;
picion of what was being done. He did not make the dis-&#xD;
covery until it was too late, for no sooner did the operator&#xD;
get him airly in focus, then he clenched his hands,.looked&#xD;
with ten-fold earnestness at the mirror, muttered to himself&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MESMERISM   EXTRAORDINARY.             6&#xD;
a few unintelligible words, and the gentleman fell to the floor&#xD;
as if his heart had been perforated by a bullet, or as if he&#xD;
had been struck down with a club. In an instant all was&#xD;
confusion, everybody thinking it a fit of apoplexy, except the&#xD;
Emperor, the operator, myself and the Russian.&#xD;
"Several went to raise him, but before they could do so he&#xD;
sprung to his feet, began to sing and dance--the truth, at the&#xD;
same time, flashed upon the company, that the phenomenon&#xD;
was mesmeric-and in another minute to plead for his life, as&#xD;
if before his judges, with the prison and the 'axe before&#xD;
him. The scene was solemn to the last degree.&#xD;
" Suddenly, and without a word from the Count, the plead-&#xD;
ing changed to a musical scena ; and although, at other&#xD;
times totally incapable of singing or playing in the least -de-&#xD;
gree,.he performed several difficult pieces in magnificent style,&#xD;
on the harp and piano, acompanying'the performances&#xD;
vocally, and in a manner that drew involuntary plaudits&#xD;
from every person present.&#xD;
This part of the performance was suddenly terminated ;&#xD;
for these sleeping subject placed himself in the exact spot in&#xD;
which the Italian had stood, and, like him, gazed steadily at&#xD;
the mirror, and in twenty seconds.the man who stood in the&#xD;
line of reflection fell to the floor, and a lady who, in going&#xD;
to his assistance, chanced to strike that line, instantly seized,&#xD;
raised him as easily as if je had been a doll, and with him&#xD;
commenced a dance unique, wild and perfectly indesetibable.&#xD;
It was infectious, for in less than half a minute seventeen&#xD;
persons,-high lords and stately dames, were wheeling, whirl.&#xD;

ere ever performed by mad Bachantes. They. had all been&#xD;
agnetized by proxy.&#xD;
"Astonished beyond measure at this extraordinary display,&#xD;
I retired, the better to watch the progress of the strange&#xD;
scene,- to the opposite side of the saloon, and leaned care- .&#xD;
lessly against one of two colossal Japanese josses that stood&#xD;
^here. No person was anywhere near me, and in my surprise&#xD;
I murmured below my breath: ' What astonishing power 1'&#xD;
and am certain that a person standing close at my side could&#xD;
not have discerned what I said, yet nevertheless the thought&#xD;
was scarcely framed before the Count turned square upon his&#xD;
heel, advanced straight toward me, smiled sweetly, strangely,&#xD;
as he did so, and said: ' All this power is yours-and mueh&#xD;
Abat is still.ore mysterious-if you but say the word I.&#xD;
What. word?' asked I, surprised that a man should so&#xD;
readily read my thought-for it is impossible that he could&#xD;
have heard my exclamation.&#xD;
"' That you will voluntarily join the most augtilt fraternity&#xD;

"'When?' where?' I asked huredly, for the august&#xD;

pQwers, and the methods of their developement. Instead of&#xD;
being surprised at modern scientific revelations, we of the&#xD;
True Temple        ' ' What Temple ?' I interrupted him&#xD;
to ask. ' Of the Supreme Dome of the Rosie Cross,' said he.&#xD;
"The Emperor must have heard 'this question and its&#xD;
answer, for he directly crossed over to us, and actually&#xD;
joined this curious tgte-4-tete. The Count bowed ; did not&#xD;
seem at all embarrassed by the presence of the son of Admi-&#xD;
ral Verhuiel,-the great Dutch founder of the Second Empire&#xD;
-or Emperor&#xD;
"'As I was saying,' the Count resumed, 'instead of being&#xD;
elated at what Western science has done, we are ashamed of&#xD;
the tardy steps of " Progress "-Progress indeed! Where&#xD;
is it, save in wretchedness, poverty, crime, selfishness, and in&#xD;
the accrement of misery. Progress is more fancied than real.&#xD;
Civilization is a misnomer, utilitarianism a desecration .of&#xD;
man's soul, Philosophy an imposture, and learning altogether&#xD;
false '&#xD;
"I was pleased to see the Emperor join the conversation at&#xD;
this point, for two reasons : first, to hear what he had to&#xD;
say ; and secondly, to observe whether the subjects on the&#xD;
floor could be kept under the Count's influence while his mind&#xD;
,was abstracted from them and centered on matters entirely&#xD;
different.&#xD;
"'Do not be disturbed at what he says,' said his majesty,&#xD;
'for these Mesmerists are all slightly mad.' And he smiled,&#xD;
while the Count shrugged his shoulders, and exclaimed:&#xD;
"' With a method, however 1'-"&#xD;
&#xD;
A SPLENDID POSSIBILITY.&#xD;
&#xD;
65&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
" Then turning his attention toward the company, by some&#xD;
inscrutable power he stopped the dance, restored the subjects&#xD;
to their normal state, and almost instantly thereafter exer-&#xD;
cised it upon Madame Dablin, who straightway, with closed&#xD;
eyes, approached a grand piano, swept its keys with match-&#xD;
less skill, as a prelude, and then launched forth into one of&#xD;
the strangest, most brilliant, yet wild and weird fantasia,&#xD;
that genius ever dreamed of. I cannot now stop to describe&#xD;
its; effect upon the company, nor upon myself, for my whole&#xD;
being was absorbed at that moment in matters far more im-&#xD;
portant to me than a mesmeric experiment, however inter-&#xD;
esting and successful it might be ; for at best, its effect and&#xD;
memory would be transient and ephemeral, while, on the&#xD;
contrary, the things I might learn from the Italian might&#xD;
last so long as my conscious soul endured. I was not, there-&#xD;
fore, disappointed when he resumed his talk. I cannot now&#xD;
repeat the ipsissima verba of what he said, but the substance,&#xD;
in reply to questions by the Emperor and myself, was in&#xD;
effect this :&#xD;
"'The soul and its -qualities, passions and volume are all&#xD;
clearly marked upon the physique, and are apparent to all&#xD;
who possess the proper key ; to all others, the difficulty lies&#xD;
in correctly reading these signs, and a still greater in assign-&#xD;
ing to- each faculty its actual, its possible, and its relative&#xD;
strength and value. Every act that a man does has an&#xD;
effect upon both his body and soul, and the imprints thereof&#xD;
are indelibly stamped upon his features ; therefore his past&#xD;
-even his most secret act or thought-can be read by the&#xD;

adept with as much ease as if his face were a printed; page,&#xD;
ihe ype being large, smooth and clear. Every man ris&#xD;
ceptible of being controlled mesmerically by another, because&#xD;
no man is collectively stronger than his weakest faculty ;F a&#xD;
.chain is no stronger than its most defective link. Now I&#xD;
control men ;because I know at a glance which is the most&#xD;
vulnerable portion of their nature. Self-love, Emulation and&#xD;
Will are the trinity in unity around which the Psychal Ee-&#xD;
public revolves. One of these is always vulnerable ; subdue&#xD;
that, and you subdue the man. Now, ylin I perform such&#xD;

speedily subdues all the rest. The mind of man is a mirror&#xD;

ing wheel. .The subject reflects my action ; then in fancy,&#xD;
sing, dance, play, and the subject reflects my thought by&#xD;
appropriate action.'&#xD;
"'But,' said one, 'suppose your subject understands no'&#xD;
thing about these accomplishments. How then ?'&#xD;
"'All. souls understand them. Tpdies may not ; and I,&#xD;
bring the soul under subjection,.not the body merely.'&#xD;

the rule is dual : it is also possible to kill a healthy man by&#xD;
the same mysterious ieans ;- and indeed it has often been&#xD;
-done, especially by the natives of Africa.&#xD;
'I persuade my soul that you are sick and will die, and&#xD;
if I keep up the will and wish, nothing is more certain than&#xD;
that both will be accomplished.. Some men naturally possess&#xD;
enormous powers of will, and are able to project visible&#xD;
images, like those of a phantasmagoria---images of whatever&#xD;
they choose to fancy-a flower, -a hand, arm, or a human&#xD;
m-and these spectra will be visible to scores of startled&#xD;
observers, who, in their utter ignorance of the human mind&#xD;
and body, and their respective and ,conjoined powers, believe&#xD;
them to be the veritable ghosts of . dead men, and objects&#xD;
produced by them. I learned recently that in London; is at&#xD;
this moment a young Scotchman, named iHume, who pos-&#xD;
sesses this power to a remarkable degree, and also that of&#xD;
levitation, and who is coining fame and fortune by pretend-&#xD;
ing that the psychical phenomenon is really and truly&#xD;
spiritual-.which is not the case. I learned this great secret -&#xD;
in the Punjaub, of Naumsavi Chitty, the chief of the&#xD;
Rosicrucians of India, and the . greatest reformer sines&#xD;
Budha.&#xD;
"At this  point the Emperor asked    the Count - to&#xD;
exhibit a specimen of. his spectre-producing power, to&#xD;
.hich the   latter 'assented.  First he walked  rapidly&#xD;
several times up and down the .saloon,: gave directiona&#xD;

&#xD;
he stood still directly in front of the mirror for a minute&#xD;
or two,' and then, in a sharp, cracked tone, repeated&#xD;
thrice the word 'Look I' We did so, and as I live, there&#xD;
flashed the semblance of a thousand chains of vivid lightning&#xD;
across the face of the mirror, along the floor, over the ceil-&#xD;
ing, up and down the walls ; now like forks, then as chains&#xD;
of electric fluid ; anon changing to fiery acorns, which gradu-&#xD;
ally formed themselves into a fiery crown, rose gently, floated&#xD;
over the company for a few seconds, and then rested in the&#xD;
air about five inches above the head of Napoleon III.-a&#xD;
crown of fire !&#xD;
"'Mind,' said he, after this splendid proof of his weird&#xD;
ability, 'I do not aver that all the phenomena exhibited in&#xD;
these days as spiritual are produced as I have these ; but I&#xD;
do say that not one-tenth part is attributable to spiritual&#xD;
agencies. That which is indeed spiritual is not all the pro-&#xD;
duct of dead men, but much of it proceeds from the Larva&#xD;
and inhabitants of the spaces between the rolling globes.'.&#xD;
" Then turning to me, he repeated his invitation to become&#xD;
an acolyte of the Temple; said we should meet again; and&#xD;
shortly thereafter the seance broke up, and I~ left the&#xD;
palace, greatly wiser than when I entered it five hours&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"Calling a voiture de remise, I entered it and rode home to&#xD;
my hotel. Arrived there, I dismounted beneath the glare&#xD;
of a street lamp, and drew forth my pocket-book to pay my&#xD;
fare. On opening it, what was my surprise at finding- a&#xD;
letter, closely sealed, within it. directed to myself. I paid&#xD;
&#xD;
the coachman, hastened to my chamber, and then, eagerly&#xD;
tearing the envelope, I read the following very singular let-&#xD;
ter, written in a female hand, and in the English language :&#xD;
"'MoNSIEUR,&#xD;
"'Remember that you have met one human soul who&#xD;
knows and thoroughly understands your strange, mysterious&#xD;
and inexplicable nature-your heaven's heights, your hell's&#xD;
depths, your spacic breadth, your volcanic eruptions, yout-&#xD;
ocean of god-like calmness, and all-pervading, all-sustaining,&#xD;
holy stillness and quiet, wherein the soul in its magnificent&#xD;
grandeur sweeps over all space and all time, and. lives an in-&#xD;
finity of lives in its own self-created world ! As such I see&#xD;
and know you. Yet in all this I see still other and a&#xD;
greater character to arise in your being than now exists&#xD;
there; I see a character is to arise, if you will allow the&#xD;
grander, diviner elements of your being, and also the hea-&#xD;
venly elements that surround you, to blend into one united&#xD;
force of harmonic intelligence, that will mould your entire&#xD;
self into a man such as I cannot now describe. Two ways,&#xD;
my friend, are now before you. One so grand, so sublime,&#xD;
that I would (in order to explain it) demand the eloquence&#xD;
of a Patrick Henry, the strength of a Casar, the love of a&#xD;
greater still, the wisdom of a god ; the other, not all these&#xD;
combined could give me power to depict.&#xD;
"' In the name of Him and humanity, choose the right.&#xD;
"'Such are the feelings of one who knows you.&#xD;

" This was Greek, Hebrew, Sanscrit, all combined, to me;&#xD;
and it continued so for a long, long time. It was evidently.&#xD;
written by some one who, while fully aware of one of my&#xD;
weaknesses--a susceptibility to flattery-yet knew not the&#xD;
man himself. Still, the allusions to my awful secret were&#xD;
too palpable to admit a doubt that the writer knew far more&#xD;
than that strange letter said or hinted at. Was it the mys-&#xD;
terious Count ?  If so, why did he take so great an interest&#xD;
in e stranger ? I could not understand it.&#xD;
"Of course I thought much of the Italian Count, and&#xD;
ardently longed to know more of, if I did not join,, the mys-&#xD;
tic Fraternity whereof he was a member ; but to no human&#xD;
being had I ever opened my mind upon the subject, either in&#xD;
Paris, or Naples, whither I repaired on my way to the&#xD;
Orient. Indeed, in the latter city the subject lay prdu in&#xD;
the cellars of my mind, for I sought to banish all care while&#xD;
in Italkin order to drink full draughts of music-that balm&#xD;
for fevered souls.&#xD;
"Wiile there,. I one night went to San Carlos to hear the&#xD;
opera of the 'Barber of Seville,' and to listen to the glorious&#xD;
strains of Mario, Grisi and Gassier. I had been charmed&#xD;
out of all my griefs by the celebrated 'Music. Lesson' of&#xD;
the latter cantatrice, and as I walked homeward I hummed&#xD;
its notes as I passed along, and it rung in my ears long after&#xD;
I had lain down to sleep. With the peculiar caution of&#xD;
Americans generally, but of Californians especially--whose&#xD;
habits I had imbibed during my short residence within the&#xD;
Golden ;ate-before retiring I had carefully examined the&#xD;
&#xD;
room, for Italians, especially Neapolitans, bear watching, to&#xD;
see that all was safe and right. It was so. Then securely&#xD;
fastening both doors and windows, I was soon drifting up&#xD;
and down the Dream -Sea. Beneath my pillow was my&#xD;
money belt, in which was about two thousand dollars in gold,&#xD;
which, together with a revolver, loaded to the muzzle, was&#xD;
the property of my friend T-s.&#xD;
"In the morning the room was as when I slept ; but the&#xD;
charges were drawn from the pistol, and the gold lay on the&#xD;
table arranged in the form of a triangle, surmounted by the&#xD;
letter 'R' while, pinned to the bosom of my sleeping robe,&#xD;
was a note in English, in a bold, clear handwriting, but in&#xD;
red ink. That note was not there the night before ; it&#xD;
could not have been placed there by human hands! 'Do&#xD;
not fail,' it read, 'to remember the purpose for which you&#xD;
crossed the seas, for your enterprise concerns the future ages&#xD;
of'the world ! It is not yet accomplished. Achieve it. I&#xD;
will yet serve and save you.-E.'&#xD;
"I was thunder-struck. Again some mysterious being was&#xD;
crossig my path ; that being whose strange domain lay on&#xD;
either side of Time, and whose will seemed ever to hedge me&#xD;
about like a wall of fire, so that escape from the strange&#xD;
destiny that hung over me seemed almost impossible. I was&#xD;
in despair, for already had grey hairs shown themselves; I&#xD;
felt that I was growing prematurely old, and that the chances&#xD;
were greatly against me, a son of Adam, ever wedding with&#xD;
a daughter of Ish."&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
ABOUT THE ROSICRUCIANS.&#xD;
IT is no part of my (the editor's) design to recount all the&#xD;
adventures of Beverly, nor to trace his paths through Egypt,&#xD;
Syria, Turkey, nor Europe. Suffice it, that I became so inte-&#xD;
rested in his story that I accompanied him on more than one&#xD;
long journey. Occasionally I would lose sight of him for&#xD;
months together, but by the strangest seeming accident we&#xD;
would meet again, now on the top of Ghizeh's great pyra-&#xD;
mid, now in the deserts of Dongola and Nubia ; then in a&#xD;
French cafe, anon in the columned groves of Karnak and&#xD;
of Thebes. We often parted, and as often met again ; and in&#xD;
the interim I had not failed to investigate certain grave&#xD;
secrets which he had confided to me. I did not fully believe&#xD;
his strange doctrines ; but I am sure that he did, and there.&#xD;
fore he commanded my sympathy and respect. As previously&#xD;
indicated, on my first acquaintance with him I was exceed-&#xD;
ingly sceptical in regard to the existence, in these days, of&#xD;
the Brotherhood of the Rosie Cross, and derided his assertions&#xD;
respecting their powers. True I had heard much, and read&#xD;
-     -&#xD;
&#xD;
more, concerning the celebrated fraternity-an association&#xD;
that has proved a veritable God-send to scores of paper-&#xD;
stainers in all parts of the globe where letter s reign, as wit.&#xD;
ness Charles Mackay, Kingsley, Robert Southey, and fifty&#xD;
others, not omitting Buiwer Lytton, his "Zanoni," and&#xD;
" Strange Story," nor Hargrave Jennings -and his " Curious&#xD;
Things" about " Fire " and the " Outside World."&#xD;
In my varied travels through Europe and the East, as&#xD;
well as in this, my native land, I have met with scores, not&#xD;
to say hundreds, who boasted themselves Rosicrucians ; and&#xD;
it is but a little while since there appeared, in a " spiritual"&#xD;
sheet in Boston, first a learned lecture, by a female "medium,"&#xD;
on the Rosicrucians, and a long communication, purporting&#xD;
to come from a deceased adept of the Order, both of which&#xD;
were quite laughable by reason of the total and utter igno.&#xD;
rance displayed. Probably both of these " enlighteners" had&#xD;
heard or read of Dr. Everard's " Compte de Gabalis," and&#xD;
took that humorous bit of badinage as the real, simon-pure&#xD;
explanation of Rosicrucianism  as, indeed, was natural, see-&#xD;
ing that hundreds have fallen into the same comical error;&#xD;
for, upon applying the touch-stone to all these pretended&#xD;
adepts in the secrets, sublime and mighty, of the Order, it is&#xD;
found that, exceptionless, they are woefully deficient in even&#xD;
the rudiments of the genuine fraternity ; nor have these&#xD;
modern pretenders any more real claims to the. truth than&#xD;
the hordes of fanatics which swarmed all over Europe an age,&#xD;
or two ago, and who brought ineffable disgrace both upon&#xD;
themselves and the sublime name which they stole.&#xD;

created.a sensation, and then disappeared, only occasionally&#xD;
jingling their bells to let the world know that the fools were&#xD;
not all defunct ; while the true Brotherhood went on, and&#xD;
still goes on, quietly performing its mission.&#xD;
Every student of history is, or ought to be, aware that&#xD;
the pretended " adepts" in past times laid claim to enormous&#xD;
amounts of the most wonderful knowledge, but when put to&#xD;
the proof; invariably failed to substantiate their claims.&#xD;
Such were the men who sought, and, in some instances, pre.&#xD;
tended to have succeeded, in accomplishing the composition&#xD;
of the Philosopher's Stone and the great Elixir.&#xD;
Vaughan, in.his "Hours with the Mystics,' laughs at the&#xD;
idea that there"ever was really such a society as that of the&#xD;
Brethren of the Rosie Cross, and alleges that they were but&#xD;
the "Mrs. Harris" of certain romancers of the past two&#xD;
centuries ; in other words, that they are altogether mistaken&#xD;
who suppose such a society ever had existence. Baron&#xD;
Fischer, now of San Francisco, declares that there  ally was&#xD;
such an order, but that it was composed of Fools, Fanatics,&#xD;
and Moon-struck Madmen, who in time became the laughing-&#xD;
stock of all Europe. On the other hand, Lyd/e, the traveller,&#xD;
asserts positively, in his great work, " The Asian Mystery,",&#xD;
that he has traced the Order, under one or more of its names,&#xD;
back into the very nighttime of the world's history. And-&#xD;
Abdul Rahman, the Arabian author, boldly declares that -&#xD;
&#xD;
has proved, the existence of this Brotherhood in ages so&#xD;
remote that Christian and Jewish history is modern in come&#xD;
parison.&#xD;
Hein, Hun--Tse-Foh, the Chinese annalist, asserts, that&#xD;
the Order originated in Tartary thousands of years before the&#xD;
foundation of the. Chinese empire, itself claiming- an age of&#xD;
over thirty thousand solar years ! From Tartary it went to&#xD;
Japan, thence to China, thence to Persia, thence to Arabia,&#xD;
thence to India, and, by stages, to Europe, having passed&#xD;
through Egypt, Jewry, and Phenicia on its way down the&#xD;
ages.&#xD;
So much for Vaughan ; now for another "authority."&#xD;
Under the letter "R," in the American Encyclopedia, oc-&#xD;
curs the word "Rosicrucians," followed by-.-" Members of a&#xD;
society, the existence of which became unexpectedly known&#xD;
at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Its object was&#xD;
ostensibly the reformation of Church, State, and individuals,&#xD;
but closer examination showed that the discovery of the&#xD;
Philosophers' Stone was the true object of the fully initiated.&#xD;
A ce-tain Christian, Rosenkrauze, who was said to have&#xD;
lived long among the Brahmins in Egypt, etc., was pretended&#xD;
to have founded the Order in the fourteenth century; but the&#xD;
real. founder is believed to have been one Andrea, a German&#xD;
scholar, of the beginning of the sixteenth century, whose ob-&#xD;
ject, as is thought, was to purify Religion, which hadbeen&#xD;
degraded by Scholastic Philosophy. Others think that he&#xD;
.only gave a new character to a society founded before him&#xD;
by Cornelius Agrippa, of Nettesheim. Krause, the author,&#xD;

STILLING AND THE ROSICRUCIANS.     77&#xD;

76&#xD;
&#xD;
- RAVALETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
says, that "Andrea occupied his time from early youth with&#xD;
the plan of a secret society for the improvement of mankind.&#xD;
In 1614 he published his famous " Reformation of the Whole&#xD;
Wide World," and hi-" Fama Fraternitas." . Christian en-&#xD;
thusiasts and alchemists considered the poetical society, par-&#xD;
tially described in these. books, as having 'a real existence,&#xD;
and thus Andrea became the author of the later Rosicrucian&#xD;
fraternities which extended over Europe. After a number&#xD;
of books had been written on the Rosicrucian system, and&#xD;
the whole exploded, the interest in it was revived in the lat-&#xD;
ter half of the eighteenth century, in consequence of the 'abo-&#xD;
lition of the Order of Jesuits, and the story of their machina-&#xD;
tions, as well as of the frauds of Cagliostro and other noto-&#xD;
rious impostors."&#xD;
So much for the wiseacre who wrote this account at so&#xD;
much a line for the " American Encyclopedia."&#xD;
In juxta-position to the above, I quote part of pages.&#xD;
132-3-4 and 5, verbatim, of the autobiography of Heinrich&#xD;
Jung, Stilling, late Aulic Counsellor to the Grand' Duke&#xD;
of Baden. London : 1858. James Nisbet, Berners street.&#xD;
3d Edition. Says this incomparable man :&#xD;
" One morning in the spring of 1.796, a handsome young&#xD;
man, in a green silk-plush coat, and otherwise well dressed,&#xD;
came to Stilling's house at Ockershaussen. This gentleman&#xD;
introduced himself in such a manner as betrayed a polished&#xD;
and genteel education. Stilling inquired who he was, and&#xD;
learnt that he was the remarkable       . Stilling was&#xD;
astonished at the visit, and his astonishment was increased&#xD;
&#xD;
by the expectation of what this extremely enigmatical indi-&#xD;
vidual might have to" communicate. After both had sat&#xD;
down, the stranger began by saying that he wished to con-&#xD;
sult Stilling relative to a person diseased in the eyes. How.&#xD;
ever, the real object of his visit pressed him in such a manner&#xD;
that he began to weep ; kissed, first, Stilling's hand, then his&#xD;
arm, and said: 'Sir, are not you the author of the "Nos-&#xD;
tolgia ?"' 'Yes,. sir.' 'You are,- therefore, one of my&#xD;
secret superiors' (in the Grand Lodge of the R. C.)  Here&#xD;
he again kissed Stilling's hand and arm, and wept almost&#xD;
aloud. Stilling, answered : 'No, dear sir ; I am neither&#xD;
your nor any one else's secret superior. I am not in any secret&#xD;
connection whatever.' The stranger looked at Stilling with&#xD;
a fixed eye, and inward emotion, and replied : 'Dearest&#xD;
friend, cease to conceal yourself ! I have been long tried, and&#xD;
severely enough. I thought you.knew me already' Stil-&#xD;
ling : 'No, Mr. ---, I assure you solemnly that I stand&#xD;
in no secret connection, and in reality understand nothing of&#xD;
all that you require of me!1'&#xD;
"This speech was too 'strong and too serious to leave the&#xD;
stranger in uncertainty. It was now his turn to be aston-&#xD;
ished and amazed. He therefore continued : 'But tell me,&#xD;
then, how is it that you know anything of the great and vene-&#xD;
rable connection in the East which you have so circumstan-&#xD;
tially described in the "Nostolgia," and have even pointed&#xD;
out their rendezvous in Egypt, on Mount Sinai, in the Mon.&#xD;
astery of Canobin, and under the Temple at Jerusalem?' 'I&#xD;
know nothing of all this,' replied Stilling. ' But these ideas&#xD;

&#xD;
presented themselves in 'a very lively manner to my inagina-&#xD;
tion. It was, therefore, mere fable And fiction.&#xD;
"'Pardon me, the matter is the truth and reality as you have&#xD;
described it. It is astonishing that you have hit it in such a&#xD;
manner-this cannot have come by chance!1' The gentleman&#xD;
now related the real particulars of the association in the East.&#xD;
Stilling was amazed and astonished beyond measure-; for he&#xD;
heard remarkable and extraordinary things, which are not,&#xD;
however, of such a nature as can be made public. I only&#xD;
affirm that what Stilling learnt from the gentleman had not&#xD;
the most remote reference to political.matters.&#xD;
"About the same time a certain great prince wrote to&#xD;
Stilling, and asked him 'How it was that he knew anything&#xD;
about the association in the East, for the thing was as he had&#xD;
'described it in the " Nostolgia."' The answer was naturally&#xD;
the same as that given verbally to the above-mentioned&#xD;
stranger. Stilling has experienced several things of this&#xD;
kind, in which his imagination exactly accorded with the real&#xD;
fact without previously having the least knowledge or pre-&#xD;
sentiment of it. How it is, and why it is, God knows.&#xD;
Stilling makes no reflections upon the matter, but lets it&#xD;
stand upon its own value, and looks upon it as a direction of&#xD;
Providence, which purposes leading him in a distinguished&#xD;
manner. The development of the Eastern mystery is, how-&#xD;
ever, a most important matter to him, because it has relation&#xD;
to the Kingdom of God. Much, indeed, remains in obscu-&#xD;
rity ; for Stilling afterwards heard from another person of&#xD;
great consequence, something of an Oriental Alliance which&#xD;
&#xD;
was of a very different kind. It remains to be developed&#xD;
whether the two are distinct or identical."&#xD;
Thus: far Jung Stilling. Quite recently I became aware&#xD;
of the existence of Rosicrucian Lodges in this country,&#xD;
obtained much information concerning the Fraternity, and&#xD;
have been- privileged to publish the following Seven Para-&#xD;
graphs, concerning the exoteric practice of the Temple:&#xD;
THE ROSIORUCIANS,&#xD;
WHO    AND WHAT THEY        ARE.&#xD;
Honor, Manhood, Goodness.&#xD;
TRY.&#xD;
I. The Rosicrucians are a body of good men, and true,&#xD;
working under a Grand Lodge Charter, deriving its_ power-&#xD;
and authority from the Imperial Dome of the Third Supreme&#xD;
Temple of the Order, and the last (claiming justly to be the&#xD;
oldest association of men on earth, dating from the sinking of&#xD;
the New Atlantis Isle, nearly ten thousand years anterior to&#xD;
the days of Plato), and as a Grand Lodge, having jurisdiction&#xD;
over the entire continent of North America, and the Islands&#xD;
of the Sea. The Grand Lodge, and Temple, grant charters&#xD;
and dispensations to found or organize subsidiary lodges-and&#xD;
temples, anywhere within the limits of its jurisdiction.&#xD;
II. All Rosicrucians are practical men, who believe in&#xD;
Progress, Law and Order, and in .Self-development. They&#xD;
believe firmly that God helps those that help themselves ;&#xD;
and they consequently adopt as the motto of the Order, the&#xD;

word TRY, and they believe that this little word of three&#xD;
letters. may become a magnificent bridge over which a man&#xD;
may travel from Bad to Better, and from Better to Best---&#xD;
from ignorance to knowledge, from poverty to wealth, and&#xD;
from weakness to power.&#xD;
III. We constitute a large society in the world, and our&#xD;
ranks bid fair to largely swell in this land of Practical Men.&#xD;
There are hundreds of men of large culture, deep intuitions&#xD;
and liberal minds, who actually languish because they do not&#xD;
know each other-there being no organized body, save our&#xD;
own, which invites such men to join its ranks and find the&#xD;
fellowship which such men of such minds need. In our&#xD;
Lodges such men find all they seek, and more ; in our&#xD;
weekly reunions the rarest and best intellects are brought in&#xD;
contact, the best thoughts are elicited, and the truest human&#xD;
pleasure experienced ; forasmuch, as nothing impure, igno-&#xD;
ble, mean or unmanly, is for an instant tolerated under any&#xD;
circumstance whatever ; while, on the .contrary, every in-&#xD;
ducement is held out to encourage all that is noble, good,&#xD;
true, beautiful, charitable and manly-and that, too, in a&#xD;
way totally unknown and unpractised in any other order, or&#xD;
association of men.&#xD;
IV. Every Rosicrucian is known, and is the sworn brother&#xD;
of every other Rosicrucian the wide world over, and as such&#xD;
is bound to render all possible aid and comfort (except when&#xD;
such aid would sanction crime or wrong doing, or interfere&#xD;
with the demands of public justice, social order, decency,&#xD;
sound morals or National prosperity and unity). In all&#xD;
&#xD;
RULES OF THE ORDER.&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
things else, every Rosicrucian is bound to help* another, so&#xD;
long as he' can. do it with a clear conscience, and not violate&#xD;
his. honor, derogate from  his personal dignity, or sully his&#xD;
own manhood. In all things worthy, one assists the other ;&#xD;
in sickness, sorrow, life, death, and the troubles and trials of&#xD;
the world and society. Each man is eligible to one, two, or&#xD;
three degrees ; and after once becoming a true Rosicrucian,&#xD;
it is next to impossible that he can ever afterward come to&#xD;
want, either for protection in all that is just, counsel in diffi-&#xD;
culty, food, raiment, shelter, and all true human sympathy ;&#xD;
-all of which is freely rendered so long as the man remains&#xD;
a worthy DWELLER IN THE TEMPLE!        .&#xD;
Thus the Temple ensures its acolytes against want, miti-&#xD;
gates their sorrow, enhances their usefulness to themselves&#xD;
and the world, braces and sharpens their intellects, fires their&#xD;
emulation, encourages all manly effort, assuages their grief,&#xD;
cultivates their hope, strengthens their self-reliance, self-&#xD;
respect, self-effort ; it frowns on all wrong doing, seeks to&#xD;
elevate man in his own esteem, teaches due and loyal respect&#xD;
to woman, the laws, society and the world ; it promotes sta-&#xD;
bility of character, makes its votaries strive for MANHOOD in&#xD;
the full, true sense ; adopts " Try" and " Excelsior" -as liv-&#xD;
ing, practical mottoes ; and thus, both directly and indi-&#xD;
rectly, does the Temple of Rosicrucia seek to increase the&#xD;
sum total of human happiness in the world, within and with-&#xD;
out its walls.&#xD;
V. Every man pays an initiation fee, and a monthly tax&#xD;

of one dollar.   In return for which, the member has the aM.&#xD;
vantage of all information the Lodge may be able to procure&#xD;
in the shape of lectures, debates, books, scientific papers,&#xD;
models, experiments in all the physical sciences, essays on&#xD;
philosophy, etc.; 'in addition to which he is allowed a sum,&#xD;
varying from four to fourteen dollars' a week when sick, pro-&#xD;
vided he needs such aid ; he is visited, comforted, nursed,&#xD;
doctored, and, should he die, the Temple buries him-as a&#xD;
man and a Rosicrucian should be buried.       If he dies an offi-&#xD;
cer (and every man is eligible), his widow and children are&#xD;
properly cared for by the Order.*&#xD;
VI. This Order is a school of the highest and best know-&#xD;
ledge the earth affords.   It is unlike any and all others, for,&#xD;
in-addition to being a Mutual Protection Society, it reaches&#xD;
out in far higher and nobler aims-only a few, very few, of&#xD;
which   are  alluded to in this hand-book, which is merely&#xD;
printed to save much explanatory talk oil the part of Rosi-&#xD;
crucians who are being continually importuned for informa-&#xD;
tion respecting the said Order. One of its main objects is&#xD;
to be a School of Men ; to make men more useful by ren-&#xD;
dering them stronger, more knowing, therefore wiser--there-&#xD;
fore happier.   As Rosicrucians we recognize the immense&#xD;
* The Grand Lodge contemplates the enactment of laws looking to the&#xD;
providing for the families of members when sick, and to their burial when dead,&#xD;
which *111 be- secured by the payment of additional fees from time to time.&#xD;
It also contemplates a system of life insurance of its members, who, by the&#xD;
payment of certain fees, may secure a certain sum to their families at death&#xD;
sufiolent to maintain them in comfort, but not in luxury or idleness. The&#xD;
system will probably be one of graduated annuities.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
value of Sympathy, Encouragement, Emulation and Per-&#xD;
sistency--&#xD;
Nil mortalibus, ardum est.&#xD;
THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY. TO HIM WHO TRULY WILLS I&#xD;
Whatever of good or great man has ever done, may still&#xD;
be accomplished by you and I, my brother, if we only think&#xD;
so, and set about in right good earnest, and no mistake.&#xD;
TRY ! We proclaim the OMN4POTENCE OF WILL ! and we&#xD;
-declare practically, and by our own achievements demon-&#xD;
strate, the will of man to be a supreme and all-conquering&#xD;
force when once fairly brought into play, but this power is&#xD;
only negatively strong when exerted for merely selfish or per-&#xD;
sonal ends; when or wherever it is called into action for good&#xD;
-ends, nothing can withstand its force. Goodness is Power ;&#xD;
wherefore we take the best of care to cultivate the normal&#xD;
will, and thus render it a mighty and powerful engine for&#xD;
Positive Good. You cannot deceive a true Rosicrucian, for he&#xD;
soon learns how to read you through and through, as if you&#xD;
were a man of glass ; and he attains this power by becoming&#xD;
a Rosicrucian only, nor can it be had through any other&#xD;
means whatever. -The Temple teaches its acolytes how to re-&#xD;
build this regal faculty of the human soul-the will ; how to&#xD;
strengthen, purify, expand, and intensify it ; and one of the&#xD;
first results observable after a man has become a true Rosi-&#xD;
crucian, is that his vanity grows smaller by degrees, and&#xD;
beautifully less; for the first thing he fully realizes is that -all&#xD;
he knows would probably make quite a large book, but that&#xD;
all he does not know would make a book considerably larger,&#xD;

&#xD;
and he therefore sets himself to learn. Where there's a will&#xD;
there's a way ; and after getting rid of self-conceit, the man&#xD;
finds himself increasing in mental stature by imperceptible&#xD;
gradations, and finds himself a learned man by a process&#xD;
which he cannot fairly comprehend, and one which is neither&#xD;
appreciated or known outside of the Temple.&#xD;
As a consequence of travelling on this royal road to know-&#xD;
ledge, the Posicrucian soon learns to despise the weakness&#xD;
of wickedness, not by reason of any long-faced cant being&#xD;
poured into his ear, but because he finds out practically that&#xD;
manhood and virtue are safe investments, while badness or&#xD;
meanness won't pay. It is the universal testimony of all&#xD;
who have become true Rosicrucians, that within its symbolic&#xD;
walls there is a deeply mysterious influence for good pervad-&#xD;
ing its atmosphere, under which every man Hof the Order be-&#xD;
comes rapidly but normally individualized and intensified in&#xD;
/ character, manhood, and influence.  ,&#xD;
VII. The doors of our Lodges are never closed against the&#xD;
honest, honorable or aspiring man ; nor can any earthly po-&#xD;
tentate, no wielder of an empire's sceptre, no wearer of a&#xD;
kingly crown, gain admission by reason of his eminence ; for&#xD;
though he be a king, he may not be a MAN, a title far above&#xD;
all others on the earth--a title nobler than any other ever&#xD;
earned by mortals ! We Rosicrucians are proud of our emi-&#xD;
nence-and justly so-.-for we are a BROTHERHOOD OF MEN!I&#xD;
and recognize MANHooD as the true kingship; hence we honor&#xD;
that man highest who knows the most, and puts his know-&#xD;
ledge to the highest and noblest uses; not only toward .his&#xD;
&#xD;
brothers, but in any field in the world's great garden, for&#xD;
are not we all brethren ?  Does not the one great God rule&#xD;
over and love us ? Even so ! No man can enter our doors&#xD;
by reason'of his wealth, for riches, unless put to manly uses,&#xD;
are detrimental ;-bad-positively injurious !  No man can&#xD;
enter our doors by reason of his fame, politics, or religion.&#xD;
The Order has nothing to do with a man's politics or religion,&#xD;
and it matters not what a man's creed is, so long as he is A&#xD;
MAN. The Baptist is welcome, but not as a Baptist ; and so&#xD;
with men of all other faiths. No religion, no faith, no poli-&#xD;
tics can be discussed from our platform, nor will their intro-&#xD;
duction be- tolerated one moment. We accept men of all&#xD;
creeds, except such as outrage decency, manhood, sound&#xD;
morals, and public order, such as Free Lovers, Mormons,&#xD;
and birds of that feather ; nor can any such person enter&#xD;
our ranks, no matter who he may be, or how high in fame or&#xD;
social place. Noman is barred out of our Temple by rea.&#xD;
son of his poverty, for physical beggars are often kings in&#xD;
mind. All we ask or seek for in a man is HoNoR, HONESTY,&#xD;
and ambition to KNOW MORE AND BE BETTER.&#xD;
Usually the Lodges of Rosicrucia meet once a week to&#xD;
hear lectures, exchange courtesies, thoughts, news ; to listen&#xD;
to invited guests, debate questions in art, science, and philo-&#xD;
sophy ; to mutually inform and strengthen each other ; to&#xD;
investigate any and all subjects of a proper nature, and to&#xD;
cultivate that manly spirit and chivalric bearing which so&#xD;
well entitles their possessor to be called A MAN. These are a&#xD;
few of the good things of Rosicrucia. We seek no man--&#xD;
men seek us. Our facilities for obtaining knowledge end in-&#xD;

SCOPE OF ROSICRUCIA.            87*&#xD;
&#xD;
formation on all subjects are, as may well be conceived, un-&#xD;
surpassed-unequalled. Financially we are satisfied. A&#xD;
Temple of Rosicrucia never yet felt the pressure of an ex-&#xD;
hausted exchequer, and probably never will. But this last&#xD;
is the least commendable thing about the Institution ; yet it&#xD;
uses money for good purposes, and therefore has its chest&#xD;
supplied.  All other essential information respecting the&#xD;
Order can be obtained BY TRYING!   -&#xD;
It will be seen that there is nothing magical here, yet I&#xD;
do not doubt but the members could tell strange stories if&#xD;
they chose.&#xD;
Many, but by no means all, the Alchemists and Herme-&#xD;
tic Philosophers were acolytes of that vast secret Brother-&#xD;
hood, which has thrived from the earliest ages, and, under&#xD;
different names in different lands, has performed, is still per-&#xD;
forming its mission. The members of this mystic union were&#xD;
the Magi of old, who flourished in Chaldea (Mesopotamia)&#xD;
ages before one of their number (Heber) left his. native&#xD;
plains, and on- foreign soil founded the Hebraic confedera-&#xD;
tion. They were the original Sabi and Sabeans, who for&#xD;
long ages preceded the Sages of Cbaldea. They were the&#xD;
men who founded that Semitic civilization, the faint shade&#xD;
of which we find, having leaped long avenues of centuries,&#xD;
in the mouldy records of early China, itself numbering its&#xD;
years by the thousand. Of this great Brotherhood sprung&#xD;
Brabma, Buddha, La-tze, Zoroaster, Plato, the Onostics,&#xD;
the Essenes, and therefore Christ himself-who was an&#xD;
Essene, and who preached the sacred doctrines of the Moun-&#xD;
&#xD;
tain of Light. They were the Dreamers of the ages-the sun&#xD;
of the epochs-eclipsed occasionally, but anon bursting forth.&#xD;
in glory again. They were the men who first discovered the&#xD;
significance of Fire ; and that there was something deeper&#xD;
than Life in man ; profounder than Intellect in the universe.&#xD;
Whatever of transcendent light now illumes the world, comes&#xD;
from the torches which they lit at the Fountain whence all&#xD;
light streameth upon that mystic mountain which they alone&#xD;
had courage and endurance to climb, and climbed, too, over&#xD;
a ladder whose rungs were centuries apart. Hermes Tris-&#xD;
megistus, Egypt's mighty king, and that other Hermes&#xD;
(Asclepius IX.), was an adept, a brother, and a Priest--as&#xD;
was Malki Zadek before him-that famous Pre-Adamite&#xD;
monarch, that Melchisedek, who was reputed to have been&#xD;
born of a Thought, and to have lived for countless ages.&#xD;
And so with the Greek Mercurius. Theirs, too, was that&#xD;
wondrous learning wherein Moses was skilled ; and at their&#xD;
fountain the Hebrew Joseph drank. Nothing 'original in&#xD;

Philosophers thought they had gained new thoughts and&#xD;
truths, the records of the Order prove them,-to have been old&#xD;
ages before the Adamic era of Chronology, and to have&#xD;
been the common property of the adepts.&#xD;
I have been led into these remarks and explanations,&#xD;
first, for the purpose of finally and authoritatively settling the&#xD;
vexed question concerning the Rosierucians, and, to throw&#xD;
light on that which is-to follow.&#xD;

MRS. G., THE ccMEDIU8M.9&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
wHo wAS HE ?--WHAT WAS IT?&#xD;
"I MADE," said Beverly to me one day, " my projected&#xD;
tour, and had returned much wiser than I went, but no nearer,&#xD;
the consummation of my chief hope.i I had begun the practice&#xD;
of medicine in the city of Boston, and occupied an office&#xD;
reputed to have been haunted by the troubled ghosts of sun-&#xD;
dry persons who were there -attracted by some strange influ-&#xD;
ence. I laughed a't, and ridiculed the pretensions of scores&#xD;
of so called seers, who claimed to behold these flitting gentry.&#xD;
"There came to my office one day-it was a very stormy&#xD;
day in the latter part of the winter of the year in the spring&#xD;
of which I was so neatly. swindled-there came, I repeat, on&#xD;
a stormy day, when the snow fell thick and fast; when the&#xD;
fierce wind blew, and the Frost-king was busily engaged in&#xD;
putting icy manacles upon all that he could reach-a lady to&#xD;
consult me upon a case'of scrofula in her child. At that&#xD;
time my reputation in that specialty was great and con-&#xD;
stantly increasing ; for I had but a few months before intro-&#xD;
duced and practised the method 'of treating that order of&#xD;
diseases, taught me in Constantinople by the famous negro&#xD;
sage of that metropolis. I prepared the materials required,&#xD;
and stood waiting for her to leave, the office, as I was anxi-&#xD;
40$ 0&#xD;
&#xD;
ous to continue the perusal of some Hieratic manuscripts lent&#xD;
me. that day by a lettered friend in Dedham. She made no&#xD;
movement indicative of leaving ; but instead, challenged, me.&#xD;
to a discussion of some spiritual subject or other, which chal,&#xD;
lenge I, from an innate horror of all strong-minded male-&#xD;
feminines, respectfully declined. She called herself my friend,&#xD;
and was, if sticking to one is a title to the name. She pos-&#xD;
sessed all the qualities of the be  adhesive plaster-it was&#xD;
impossible to get rid of her presence. She declared that she&#xD;
constantly saw, and held conversations with the dead, and she&#xD;
would then and there give a proof of her qualifications in that&#xD;
direction ; whereupon she was instantly seized with an ex-&#xD;
ceedingly violent trembling, accompanied with any amount of&#xD;
spasmodic jerks and twitchings; I had witnessed such things&#xD;
before, and consequently did not feel alarmed at Mrs. Gra.&#xD;
ham's condition, but going into the rear office I procured a chair&#xD;
and sat down to wait for demonstrations; which, when they&#xD;
came, were but so many pretty word-paintings---commonplae&#xD;
counsel and advice addressed to me by what purported' tobe&#xD;
my mother-which latter, however, appeared to have for-&#xD;
gotten her name, my own, and when and where she departed&#xD;
this life. I was perfectly certain that it was not my mo-&#xD;
ther, and equally so that Mrs. Graham was not consciously&#xD;
acting the part of an impostor, and I accounted for the phe-&#xD;
nomenon on the Rosicrucian theory, then quite new to me,&#xD;
that she was obsessed, or possessed, by and with a distinct&#xD;
individuality entirely foreign to her own. To my mind the&#xD;
thing was certain that she, like scores of thousands of others&#xD;

THE STRANGE LITTLE OLD MAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
are, was for the time being under the absolute control and&#xD;
dominion of a Will a myriad times stronger than that of any&#xD;
living human being that ever tenanted a body on this terraque-&#xD;
,ous globe of ours-beings perfectly intelligent, powerful, invi-&#xD;
sible, and totally conscienceless, wherein is a great difference&#xD;
from human beings.&#xD;
" The lady came around in a few minutes, and I frankly&#xD;
stated my opinion to her. It was new and startling. 'Not&#xD;
minan spirits-yet intelligent ?  An intelligent thing--and&#xD;
guileful? It is dreadful! Horrible I What, then, is that&#xD;
Thing ?  Angels ? -"No !  Devils ?  If so, whence come&#xD;
they ?  Why?   For what end ?'&#xD;
"These were terrible questions ; and we talked about the&#xD;
matter, the lady and I, as we sat in the back office, near the&#xD;
fire, for it was very cold ; and she sat leaning on the desk&#xD;
near the window, and I sat near the door between the offices,&#xD;
by back nearly touching it. The outer door, which opened&#xD;
on the stair-landing, was closed, and a wire was so attached&#xD;
to it that it could not be opened, or even the latch be raised,&#xD;
without touching a spring that instantly rung a bell that was&#xD;
suspended directly over my head in the rear office. I used&#xD;
this rear office as a reading-room and laboratory, and I fre-&#xD;
quently became so absorbed in my reading or chemistry, that&#xD;
nothing less than the ringing of that bell would suffice to&#xD;
divert my attention.&#xD;
"And there and thus we sat and talked for more than three&#xD;
long hours. The .strong-minded woman's soilr had at last&#xD;
really been aroused ; while I once more brought to the sur-&#xD;
&#xD;
face my Rosicrucian lore. In thought and speech we tra-&#xD;
versed a score of conjectural worlds and labyrinths of Be-&#xD;
ing ; until, at' last: 'Are there, really, any intelligent, but&#xD;
viewless bei gs, other-than man, in all the broad universe--&#xD;
I mean othe- than man as he is here, and disembodied like-&#xD;
wise ?---that's t e question,' said the lady by the desk.&#xD;
"'Of corse there are ! MYRIADS !' said a clear, manly voice&#xD;
in the room, right straight from the centre of the triangle&#xD;
formed by the desk, the door and the southern wall of the&#xD;
office ! It was not the lady who thus relief to her own&#xD;
question ! It was not I who spoke ; nor, strange as it after-&#xD;
wards appeared, did the circumstance strike me as being at&#xD;
all out of the common. And, therefore, without an instant's&#xD;
hesitation, I rejoined to the observation of the speaker, whom&#xD;
I subsequently remember to have observed was a thin, strange-&#xD;
looking, scrawny, shrivelled little old man, with the queerest&#xD;
possible little sharp grey eyes. He looked half frozen, and&#xD;
acted so, for he advanced toward some shelves and proceeded&#xD;
very leisurely to warm his hands over my laboratory furnace,&#xD;
between the door and wall. The lady appeared no more sur-&#xD;
prised than myself at the inexplicable presence of this singu-&#xD;
lar intruder.&#xD;
"' I am not so sure of that,' I replied, in answer to the&#xD;
words uttered by the strange old man-.' I am not so sure&#xD;
that there are such beings in existence.'&#xD;
"'Then you're a greater fool than I took you for I Good&#xD;
evening!1' And he moved slightly toward the door, against&#xD;
which my chair firmly stood.&#xD;

"'Don't go yet, for I want you to explain,' said the lady.&#xD;
'Don't you think he ought to ?' turning to me with a very&#xD;
peculiar earnestness expressed in her countenance, especially&#xD;
in her eyes-very peculiar eyes at all times, but lit up in the&#xD;
most extraordinary manner at that moment.  'I think he&#xD;
ought to prove his statement, and not leave us in this state of&#xD;
uncertainty. It is positively cruel 1' And, as she spoke, her&#xD;
eye met mine, and fastened it as if the encountering glances&#xD;
were riveted together.&#xD;
"There must be some magic in the soul that is only flashed&#xD;
forth on very rare occasions, else why did her glance so fix&#xD;
my gaze for ten seconds that I could not stir ? At the end&#xD;
of that space of time the fascination ended, and, raising my&#xD;
eyes, I answered-.&#xD;
"'CertainlyI he ought to explain ; and, of course,' said I,&#xD;
turning towards the man-' of course, you will explain your-&#xD;
self, and----?&#xD;
" There was no man there ! Not even a sign that he had&#xD;
been. He had disappeared, gone, utterly vanished-not&#xD;
through the window, for that was a clear fall of seventy feet&#xD;
to the ground, besides which it had been securely nailed down&#xD;
for over four months-not through the door, for my chair&#xD;
and back were against it I&#xD;
"Mrs. Graham fainted, and fell prone upon the floor !&#xD;
" Ilived in Charlestown, and reached home rather early that&#xD;
evening. Not that I was frightened. Oh, no! but because home&#xD;
seemed cheerier than the office; for the weather was bitterly&#xD;
&#xD;
CHARLESTOWN, MASS.&#xD;
&#xD;
93&#xD;
&#xD;
cold, and the storm-spirits were holding high, tempestuous revels&#xD;
in the common and the bay ; and, ever and anon, as the shiver-&#xD;
ing pedestrian jogged along, and turned the sharp corners of&#xD;
what is literally and emphatically, and in more senses than&#xD;
one, the most angular city in the world, the blast would meet&#xD;
him square in the face, side-ways, and all around him in the&#xD;
same blessed moment of time, no matter which way he headed ;&#xD;
for a Boston snow-storm blows every way at once-here it is&#xD;
due north, around the corner it is south-east, behind you it is&#xD;
north-west; over the way it blows straight up, and in the&#xD;
middle of the street it blows straight down.&#xD;
" It was hard work travelling the four miles to my home that&#xD;
night, for every step had to be wearily footed. True, there&#xD;
were street cars, but no man in Boston ever remembers one&#xD;
going the right way when most it was wanted ; but every-&#xD;
body can find scores coming, when everybody is bent -upon&#xD;
going.&#xD;
" Well, after a perilous walk, I at last reached home, and&#xD;
gladly sat down to my comfortable supper of toast and tea&#xD;
in my snug little parlor-the same little parlor where I wrote&#xD;
my book and received the loan of money to publish it, which&#xD;
money I was afterwards deprived of by the financial acumen&#xD;
of as great a soundrel as ever went loose upon the world.&#xD;
" Oh, how it stormed outside ! and oh, how warm and cosy&#xD;
was the little snug harbor into which I had just moored&#xD;
myself !&#xD;
"It was the second cup of tea-orange pekoe it was, for I&#xD;
had bought it of a Chinaman in Boston, who knew all about&#xD;
tea---and the second slice of, toast that I was discussing, along&#xD;

SECRET OF PERPETUAL LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
RAVALETtE.&#xD;
&#xD;
with my daily paper, when suddenly there came a loud, im-&#xD;
perative double knock at the door, similar to that of an Eng-&#xD;
lish postman. when in a hurry to deliver his letters.  The&#xD;
door was immediately opened by a servant, who thought some&#xD;
one had been taken suddenly, ill, and that I had been sent for&#xD;
professionally. But what was my astonishment when in&#xD;
stalked, with as much ease and nonchalance as if he belonged&#xD;
there, no less a personage than the mysterious little old man&#xD;
of the afternoon. I was thunderstruck. It was the same&#xD;
person who had treated me so rudely, and who had first come&#xD;
and then gone again so unaccountably, and who had induced&#xD;
an illness in Mrs. Graham that resulted in causing her to for-&#xD;
ever abandon her mediumatic practices--the same that has&#xD;
sent so many scores of people to premature graves, and will&#xD;
send thousands more. The strange man advanced toward&#xD;
the fire, and exclaimed-&#xD;
"'What a fright I caused you and your guest this after-&#xD;
noon ! Ha! -ha ! It was 5apital-was it not?'_&#xD;
".And again he laughed, but this.time in a manner and with -&#xD;
a voice which, had it not been, for the immense physical dis-&#xD;
parity apparent, I could have sworn was that of the Italian&#xD;
Count in Paris. But this supposition was hardly possible.&#xD;
The man before me was so decidedly human, that, by a rapid&#xD;
and comprehensive induction, I concluded that Mrs. Graham&#xD;
and myself had been victimized for sport by one who was&#xD;
perfect master of the mesmeric art. This hypothesis was&#xD;
quite pOausible, only I could not- account for tire non-ringing&#xD;
of the office bell.; and the-idea seemed at that time quite pre-&#xD;
posterous that any one could successfully magnetize the clap-&#xD;
&#xD;
per of a bell into silence. I learned more afterwards. Neither&#xD;
did it seem quite reasonable that this man had, before enter-&#xD;
ing the office at all, exerted his power upon our senze of&#xD;
hearing, rendering us deaf.&#xD;
"To his remark I replied, rather sententiously,.with 'V ery'&#xD;
and said no more,'for I did not fancy his joke, if such it was,&#xD;
nor his brusquerie, nor his decided lack of good manners, nor&#xD;
his rude speech ; in fact, I did not fancy the man at 11, nor&#xD;
anything about .him. Not that he was hated or dEpised,&#xD;
but because there was a something about him that m, ,de my&#xD;
very flesh creep again, and caused me to instinctively shrink&#xD;
from his contact.&#xD;
" It is well known that one of the cardinal points of the&#xD;
Rosicrucian belief is that bodily life can be prolonged I rough&#xD;
whole ages in two different ways ; first, by means of the&#xD;
Elixir of Life; secondly, by means of mere will alone. In the&#xD;
first case beauty and youth accompany age; but in the second,&#xD;
age is apparent all along the centuries. This latter secret&#xD;
and the processes were revealed by a degenerate Rosicracian&#xD;
in 1605'; and all students of medicine are aware that great&#xD;
capital was made of it in later times by a French physician&#xD;
named Asgill. This writer undertook to publicly demon-&#xD;
strate and teach the art of life-prolonging, laying it down&#xD;
positively, that man is literally immortal, or rather that any&#xD;
given man alive could, if he choose, utterly .laugh at and&#xD;
defy death ; that he need not, if so disposed, ever die, if he&#xD;
used sufficient prudence, and forcibly and constantly exerted&#xD;
his will in that direction. Asgill used to complain of the&#xD;
cowardly practice of dying, considering it a mere trick, and&#xD;

unnecessary habit. The records tell us that several men&#xD;
have used both these means to perpetuate existence, and I&#xD;
have not the slightest doubt that it has been attempted and&#xD;
proved measurably successful; and now, on this stormy night,&#xD;
as I gazed on the withered wreck before me, it struck me that&#xD;
he was one of those wretches who had attained indefinite&#xD;
"length of years by the second method, and, as a necessary&#xD;
consequence, had lost all fire, all feeling, all love, and all&#xD;
conscience. I shuddered a3 the possibility flashed upon me.&#xD;
He saw the motion, and a smile of ineffable scorn curled his&#xD;
lip as he did so. I abandoned my notion.&#xD;
"People who observe things as they plod their way through&#xD;
the world, and who have at all made the human soul a study,&#xD;
have often been made'aware that there is a certain nameless&#xD;
something that comes over a man, that with resistless elo-&#xD;
quence persuades his inner soul that some danger approaches,&#xD;
some peril besets, some disaster impends over him. There&#xD;
are times, when calm reigns all around him, and peace blos-&#xD;
some in his heart, that he suddenly is apprised that Calamity&#xD;
is flapping her way toward him- through the terrible nebu-&#xD;
lous gloom of the Future. Many a man and woman has felt&#xD;
this ; and some such feeling, some such horror-form, now&#xD;
seemed hovering, cowering, crawling near me, and preparing&#xD;
to seize upon and fang my very soul, in the presence of the&#xD;
queer little man at my side. It was a mixed feeling of guilt&#xD;
and dread, and yet no guilt was mine. I had not cheated,&#xD;
robbed, lied, to my best friend. I had not fared sumptuously&#xD;
every day on the proceeds of villainy; my wife and daughters&#xD;
did not dress in purple and fine linen, bought with the money&#xD;

wronged from a poor man, or any man at all. I had aota&#xD;
fine piano, and parlors full of guests enjoying funds thus ggt-&#xD;

and fattened on the money of a man whose child was at that&#xD;
very moment struggling, gasping, choking in the clutchesqf&#xD;
grim death for want of bread and medicine. True, there&#xD;
were those who did all this--and the corpse of a pretty little&#xD;
girl attests it-but I did not; why then should I be afraid?&#xD;
'here is no answer to that, and yet I was in dread.&#xD;
"After saying 'Very!' I spoke no more, but striving to&#xD;
repress the horror creeping over me, I tried to 109k as indig-&#xD;
nant as possible, which he was not slow to observe;forle&#xD;
approached, slapped me familiarly on the. back, poured ot&#xD;
and drank a cup of tea and ate a rusk, which settled the&#xD;
question as to his being no ghost; then he, dropped carelessly&#xD;
into my easy-chair, rubbed his little per   nose with his&#xD;
thin, little, bluish-pale fingers, and throwing himself forward,&#xD;
so as to look right up into my face, he laughed heartily, and&#xD;
then bawled out, rather than sung, at the top of his voice:&#xD;

And then he again burst out into one of the wildest,&#xD;
onost outrd,. and ridiculous laughs that ever fell on mortal&#xD;
" The wretched doggerel that I had just heard was beneath&#xD;
my notice ; and little did I know of the singer, and still less&#xD;
did I imagine that those lines were to me the most important&#xD;
IThad ever heard.&#xD;
Gradually, and by imperceptible degrees, my prejudices&#xD;
began to wane ; I conversed with him upon a variety of sub.&#xD;
jects, and the conference was maintained during four long.&#xD;
hours, perhaps more ; for if my memory serves me, it was&#xD;
-nearly eleven o'clock when he arose from his seat, shook me&#xD;
cordially by the hand, said he was going, promised to call&#xD;
again 'when he wanted to serve me,' and then, opening. the&#xD;
oors, passed out into the midst of one of the most fierce and&#xD;
4dictivd tempests that ever desolated the shores of Boston&#xD;
Ba. A singular thing was this : in the depth of winter, tiis&#xD;
am who refused steadily'to speak concerning himself was&#xD;
idd' in the very thinnest summer raiment, not having enough&#xD;
4ven for a northern June, much less for such fearful weather&#xD;
as prevailed on the night of that 4th of February-a night*&#xD;
when the glass in Boston told of cold twenty degrees below&#xD;
zero, and in New Ham shire nineteen lower still--a night&#xD;
so bitter that many and many a man went to eternity, borne&#xD;
thither on the frosty pinions of the Ice-king.&#xD;
"'After all it is a man, and mesmerism furnishes a key to&#xD;
all this seeing mystery,' thought I ; and with this consoling&#xD;
supposition I went to bed, and there reproduced all that he&#xD;
&#xD;
ft&#xD;
&#xD;
had said or done.      Now, although little was said in regard&#xD;
to himself, yet, from    that little, I gathered that he was an&#xD;
Armenian by birth, that his name was MIAKUs, which is the&#xD;
ancient Chaldaic for Priest of Fire. He told me this as he&#xD;
bent down to kiss a sweet little prattling Cora, and said that&#xD;
he was very fond of children, and felt particularly so toward&#xD;
the little fairy, who, seated in her chair, was busily engaged&#xD;
in laying down the law to a culprit kitten, who, it appeared,&#xD;
had been guilty of leze majeste to her Christmas doll. After&#xD;
the child had been sent to bed, Miakus produced from his&#xD;
bosom   a little square, flat case, apparently of rose or olive&#xD;
wood, and     about seven    inches across by     two and a half&#xD;
deep.* It was locked, and the key, a silver one, hung by a&#xD;
golden clasp to an ordinary steel watch-chain round his neck.&#xD;
The little man laid this case upon the bureau, where it lay&#xD;
undisturbed, although it became clear to me that his business&#xD;
there was in some way associated with that box and myself.&#xD;
It was equally clear that his air was more than half assumed&#xD;
and that, in spite of his nonchalance and brusque surface, great&#xD;
B Both the incidents of the magic mirror are actual, literal facts, as is alsotits&#xD;
curious construction and effects as herein related. I have witnessed many astou.&#xD;

have seen several exactly similar-one in Zagazik, Lower Egypt, in the hands of a&#xD;
Hindoo magician, two in Cairo, one in Thebes, two in Constantinople, and one in&#xD;
London. In the East, owing to the scarcity of the peculiar material wherewith&#xD;
the space between the glasses is filled, they cost enormous prices, and then can&#xD;
only be had by a Christian through favor. In this country, or England, they&#xD;
might cheaplybe n ade. I have one in my possession that I would not part with&#xD;

trouble reigned beneath ; for, occasionally, as he spoke, therm&#xD;
was a melancholy cadence and plaintive modulation in his&#xD;
tones, that, to practised ears, spoke, if not of a breaking&#xD;
heart, at least of one most deeply injured and bereaved. This&#xD;

one who grieved with those in grief, and joyed with those in&#xD;
joy. Then, after a little, he told me that one of his objects&#xD;
Was to initiate me into certain mysteries of white magic, to&#xD;
teach me how to construct the magic mirror in which the&#xD;
majority of persons could glance through space, see and talk&#xD;
with the dead, and in all things, save a few, have an unerring&#xD;
guide through life. Said he-' I have such a curious look-&#xD;
ing-glass in yonder box, and perhaps-and perhaps not--you&#xD;
may test its qualities before I leave you. The fact is, I feel&#xD;
down-hearted, have been so all day, and all the more because&#xD;
I hurt your amour propre by calling you a fool, which, of&#xD;
,course, I do not apologize for. It struck me that I would take&#xD;
advantage of the weather to chat with you, without infriig-&#xD;
ing upon your business, and that, possibly, you might learn&#xD;
something and I find relief in teaching you, and thus with-&#xD;
draw us both for a time from the great Failure '-by which he&#xD;
meant the world. 'I am weary of myself, the world, philoQ-&#xD;
sophers and philosophy. There's nothing good but magic !1&#xD;
You have been a fool while striving to be wise ; and are am-&#xD;
bitious to know what you have hitherto merely imagined.'&#xD;
"He rose, took the case, laid it on. the table between us,&#xD;
and, while playing with the key, continued-' If you really&#xD;
desire to pierce through the gloom that palls the human&#xD;
&#xD;
1o%&#xD;
&#xD;
senses, .you must abandon all human loves and passions, ,most&#xD;
especially all' that relates to woman ; for woman's love de.&#xD;
stroys-in the very moment of man's victory over her, she&#xD;
triumphs-he yields his life, and offers up existence itself oi&#xD;
her altars, and then she laughs ! Is it not so ? Does no$&#xD;
every mau's experience corroborate this ?  Strong as iron&#xD;
alone, no sooner does he reach the goal of love than he se&#xD;
lost in a sea of weakness, lethargy, deadness ! Bah ! avoid&#xD;
woman. You want high knowledge, and must pay high&#xD;
prices. God gives nothing--he sells all,; and he who would&#xD;
have must purchase, and the price is suffering. So with love.&#xD;
Its life is bought with the coin of death. Woman is like the&#xD;
ivy vine mantling round some hoary tower, and the more you&#xD;
are ruined the closer she clings, and the closer she clings the&#xD;
more you are ruined ! Listen. No one acts Without .a mo-&#xD;
tive. I have' one with regard to yourself, and it is a.selfish&#xD;
one. It so happens that the possessor of the magic mirror&#xD;
can in it behold all other horoscopes but his own, beyonda&#xD;
certain point ; and, if he would know it, he must consul4&#xD;
other seers.  Now,- there are certain beings in existence&#xD;
whose future cannot be read except by certain persons&#xD;
specially constituted. You are one of the latter, I am ones&#xD;
qf the former ; and such as we only meet at the beginning&#xD;
and the end of - chs -and eras. The present is one of these.&#xD;
I will present you with the mirror when you have done me&#xD;

awful depths. To this I pledge a word that never yet was&#xD;
broken, and an oath that never will be. For this purpose I&#xD;
have followed you for years, patiently waiting for the hour&#xD;
that dawns at last. To successfully do the thing I ask, two&#xD;
things are essential. 1st, That, in a perfectly pure state of&#xD;
body, health, mind, intent, and morals, you gaze into the&#xD;
glass. 2d, That, while doing so, you make no resistance&#xD;
against certain sleepful influences that may assail you, which&#xD;
influences will not be mesmeric, nor assisted by myself in any&#xD;
way, but is the sacred slumber of Sialam Boaghiee, which can&#xD;
only be enjoyed once in a hundred years, and then only by&#xD;
persons who are singularly constituted as you are-whose&#xD;
veins are filled with the mingled blood of all the nations that&#xD;
sprung from the loins of the Edenic protoplast, the Biblical'&#xD;
Adam, and who, temperamentally, and in all other respects,&#xD;
save sex, are perfectly neutral. Certain great advantages will&#xD;
accrue to you from this concession that are unattainable&#xD;
without From this slumber you will awaken doubly ; first,&#xD;
to the old life without ; and, second, to another and a fuller&#xD;
though stranger life within, and to the power of comprehending&#xD;
innumerable mysteries that lie enshrouded in dim regions far&#xD;
beyond the ken of ordinary man. Dreamer ! you shall cow-&#xD;
prehend your dreams. Rosicrucian ! you shall comprehend'&#xD;
the Light, the Tower, and the Flame, and where Artefius&#xD;
and Zimati failed you shall find success ! It is difficult, if&#xD;
not impossible, to either over-rate the advantages to be derived&#xD;
ly. the possession of the power I allude to, or to define and&#xD;
characterize it in words, mainly for the reason that, although&#xD;

the idea stands out well marked and distinct before the mind&#xD;
fet the language which you speak has no terms or symnbo1i&#xD;

coarse raiment for thought, and no more show the beauty&#xD;
of what they cover, than the preposterous costumes of Chris=!&#xD;
tendon display the superlative glories of the human form.&#xD;
The soul that sleeps this slumber passes through a gate which&#xD;
even the privileged dead cannot enter, save once in a century&#xD;
and then only by reason of neutrality, for positive people&#xD;
are to be counted by the billion on either side the grave,&#xD;
negative people outnumber them ten million to one, while&#xD;
neutrals are, like cold heat, very rare indeed. I trust we&#xD;

" Now, I had, two hours before, on seeing him eat and drii,&#xD;
hastily abandoned my ghostly hypothesis regarding the littid&#xD;
queer old man. But now, as he talked so strangely, and so&#xD;

much so, indeed, that, but for his eating, and the fact that&#xD;
several persons in the house beside myself had seen and ex-&#xD;

have doubted the evidence of my senses, and set the whole&#xD;
thing down, from the scene in the office till his departure, to&#xD;
the account of a disturbed imagination. There was a some-&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
PHOSPHORUS AND THE ELIXIR OF LIFE.&#xD;
"MARVELLING," said Beverly, continuing his wonderful&#xD;
story---" Marvelling on the strange events of the day and&#xD;
night, as said before, I retired to my chamber, but not to&#xD;
rest, for ere the morning dawned upon the world again, there&#xD;
came to me an experience that in some respects totally&#xD;
changed the current and character of my life. These inci-&#xD;
dents are already recorded in my narrative concerning 'Cyn-&#xD;
thia and Thotmor,' long since given to the world.*&#xD;
On the morning following this eventful night, I repaired&#xD;
to the office of a reputed to be Philosophic toothdoctor.&#xD;
whose brain is a far more curious museum than the one near,&#xD;
his office. With him I conversed awhile, and by him was&#xD;
introduced to a real thinker, whose name, I think, was&#xD;
Blood. After smoking a segar-and each other-in his .labor&#xD;
tdry, I repaired to Nichols', the chemist, made a few purr-.&#xD;
chases, and forthwith went to my office.&#xD;
"Now, it so happened that sometime previously I had&#xD;
purchased a chemical apparatus, conducting my experiments&#xD;
secretly, and mainly after 'twelve at night-for the piupose&#xD;
of repeating La Briere's great experiment for the removal of&#xD;

the poisonous and igneous properties of Phosphorus without&#xD;
decreasing its revivifying and medicinal qualities. I had ex-&#xD;
perimented untiringly for five months, at a cost almost rain-&#xD;
ous to me, but still with an invincible conviction that I&#xD;
should succeed, and give my secret to the world, instead of&#xD;
perishing like the'poor Frenchman, who burst an artery from&#xD;
excitement at his success, having made about eleven ounces&#xD;
that fulfilled his entire expectations. Part -of his process&#xD;
only survived him, and many a man, like myself, had at-&#xD;
tempted to fathom the secret and gain the enormous fortune&#xD;
that must result from complete success, but hitherto in vain.&#xD;
The experiment was a most important one. Churchill&#xD;
had produced his hypophosphites, and they had lamentably&#xD;
failed of the intention ; hence, in working at this mine, I&#xD;
had avoided his and others' formula. Success, I felt, would&#xD;
not only benefit my own private practice, but would be of&#xD;
iriealculable service to the medical profession, and still more to&#xD;
that large class of persons who by over mental exertion,&#xD;
severe intellectual and sedentary occupations, and by pas-.&#xD;
sional and other imprudent excesses, had deprived themselves&#xD;
of the wine of life, by draining themselves of nervous force ;&#xD;
and become spiritless, semi-insane, gloomy, and despondent.&#xD;
Such a discovery I knew would place in. the hands of the&#xD;
profession a true, positive, but perfectly harmless aphrodision&#xD;
nervous stimulant, mvigorant and tonic. It was, therefore,&#xD;
worth all the time, trouble, and expense I devoted to it, for it&#xD;
would be one of the best things medical science had yet given&#xD;
to the world.'&#xD;

It had long been demonstrated : 1st. That Phospheid&#xD;
abounded in the bones, nerves, and tissues of the human&#xD;
body, but especially in the human brain. 2d That 1Thos-&#xD;
phorus was invariably present in large quantities in the&#xD;
brains of healthy men who had been killed, and analysis'there-&#xD;
after made ; and invariably as the brain thus analyzed 'was&#xD;
that of an intellectual, fine-strrng, high-toned, ambitious&#xD;
ecutive, or spiritual person, just in proportion was the vo-&#xD;
lume of phosphorus found in their remains ; while the low,&#xD;
the ignorant, coarse and brutal had comparatively little' phos&#xD;
phorus in them. 3d. It had been proved that in the adminis&#xD;
tration of phosphorus to old people; to the class of patients&#xD;
who-seek private advice ; to those exhausted by mental la-&#xD;
bor or excess, it invariably acted as a revivifier, and seemed&#xD;
iot only to restore health,-strength, and fire to the body,&#xD;
but to rejuvenate and tone up the mind to its 'i-stine&#xD;
strength, power, and activity ; while insanity, idiotcy,brain-&#xD;
sofening, and causeless terror, disappeared in the ratio of&#xD;
its exhibition, for one half of the diseases of civilizationresuIt-&#xD;
from the waste of phosphorus from the system, and for thirt&#xD;
years medical chemistry had sought to so prepare the' article&#xD;
that it'would at once assimilate with the tissues and fluids.&#xD;
It had not succeeded. True, La Briere 4ad, bu then his&#xD;

dred failures, produced what he had named Phymyle.&#xD;

This preface is essential to the understanding of what follows,.&#xD;
" Now, it so happened that a few days before I saw Mrs.&#xD;
Graham, that I had placed about four pounds of phosphorus,&#xD;
together with about five times that weight of other materials,&#xD;
in a strong glass vessel, in a sand-bath, ready for the produce.&#xD;
tion of, perhaps, one quart of the precious medicine ; and,&#xD;
the first thing I did on entering my office from the dentist's,&#xD;
was to light the gas beneath it. For a few minutes I stood&#xD;
watching the rich and beautiful scarlet and purple vapor as&#xD;
it rose and curled through the neck of the retort, and the&#xD;
long glass pipes leading to the, condensing apparatus.&#xD;
"While thus intently engaged, I was suddenly startled by&#xD;
the exclamations, ' Careless eol! Look out ! Run!I' Me-&#xD;
chanially I obeyed, leaped into the outer office, and had&#xD;
scarcely done so, than there occurred a loud explosion. The&#xD;
retort had burst into a million fragments, shattering the win-&#xD;
dows. and apparatus into -fin pieces, and scattering some&#xD;
pods of ignited phosphorus upon the floor. Here was&#xD;
trouble. Iut not to the speaker-for, quick as light, he tore,&#xD;
the carpet off the office floor, and burled it, phosphorus and.&#xD;
all into the snow-drifts in the yard below, which soon melted&#xD;
under the intense blaze of tljat almost quenchless fire, until,&#xD;
hagig consumed itself, nothg but a white smoke was left,&#xD;

"It has been the habit of the wiseacres of this world:.&#xD;
deride the idea that it is pos  e to make gold ; to laugh in&#xD;
face of the notorious fact that nature is constantly making it,&#xD;
and that, too, of gasses in the earth, as all things else, save&#xD;
souls, are made. It has been fashionable to laugh at the&#xD;
idea of compounding a material capable of freeing the system&#xD;
of all its gross and clogging impurities-the only friction to,&#xD;
the wheels of life ; a mixture which would exhilarate, purify,&#xD;
strengthen, and supply to the body the chemical and dyna-&#xD;
mic forces of which it is constantly being robbed. But these&#xD;
wise people will have done laughing by-and-by ; not by any&#xD;

metals would change them into gold. We of this century are&#xD;
too knowing for that ; nor that I hoped to discover, from&#xD;
the application of the old man's suggestions, that wondeifuil&#xD;
fluid alluded to awhile since ; but I did believe it possible&#xD;
that I could compound a draught that when quaffed would&#xD;
repair the waste of nature, and believed until that moment,&#xD;
that in Phymyle I had found it. - What, then, was my aston&#xD;
ishment when the weired old man whispered in my ear that I&#xD;
stood upon the brink of the grandest success conceivable,&#xD;
that the grand Secret of secrets was all but in my grasp?&#xD;
To describe my sensations at that moment is impossible, and&#xD;
the more so because the old man told me the whole process&#xD;
and constituents.&#xD;
: What cared I even if it was necessary for me to go to&#xD;
Jerusalem, and gather the precious seeds of a fruit that&#xD;
grows upon its walls, wherewith to prepare the water ?  In&#xD;
other years I did go, and the treasured seeds are mine. .&#xD;
In that awful moment of success I blessed the old man and&#xD;
internally vowed that in return I would read his horoscope,&#xD;
and sleep the sleep of Sialam; for was not the desire of my&#xD;
soul gratified ? Why then should I not return the favor ?&#xD;
" Such, in that tumultuous moment, were my thoughts.&#xD;
Soon I became calmer, and then, 'How came the old man to&#xD;
know the materials that were being used ?' 'Perhaps he saw&#xD;
the fumes, and thus knew them !' But how of the contents of&#xD;
the condensing-chest through which the vapor was forced for&#xD;
the purpose of nullifying its injurious qualities ? for no living&#xD;
human being had seen me compound or place them there.&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE MAGIC MIRROR.&#xD;
"'LET me give you a piece of advice,' said Miakus, 'for&#xD;
you need it. First, never intrust any secret to a friend,&#xD;
which, if revealed, would bring trouble or disgrace. Never.&#xD;
interfere in a brawl or quarrel, no matter who is right orf,&#xD;
who wrong ; but always let the world do its own fighting,-&#xD;
while you stand by to avail yourself of any advantage that&#xD;
chance may disclose ; and lastly, keep what you know until&#xD;
there shall be a market for it. Now we will test our magic&#xD;
glass,' and forthwith we went into the rear office, which by&#xD;
that time had been refitted, so far as glass and carpet were&#xD;
concerned.&#xD;
" In his hands he bore the rose-wood box, which he, laid.&#xD;
upon the table, while, by the aid of four gimlets, he fixed a&#xD;
silken screen, or curtain, entirely across the room, having&#xD;
previously closed the shutters to exclude every ray of day-&#xD;
light from the apartment.&#xD;
that,' said he 'is a magic screen. You have seen a&#xD;
magic-lantern exhibition.  Well, this is to be a similar onen&#xD;
without the lantern. I now open this box, as you see, and&#xD;
take from it this mirror, which is, as you observe, merely two&#xD;
plates of French glass, with strips of wood around their&#xD;

&#xD;
edges to keep them half an inch apart, and so that a fluid&#xD;
poured between them shall not escape. Nothing depends for&#xD;
success upon either the box, the curtain, or the glasses, but all&#xD;
depends upon the peculiar fluid between them, which is, as&#xD;
you perceive, of a dark brown color, but at a distance,&#xD;
quite inky to the eye.&#xD;
"'I now hang this mirror by this hook, to the ring sewed&#xD;
to the upper central edge of the screen. Then closing and&#xD;
locking both the doors, thus, I place these two chairs for you&#xD;
and I to sit upon. Then I take this reflector and place it&#xD;
near the gas jet in such a manner as to throw a strong light&#xD;
-a perfectly circular and brilliant disk upon the very centre&#xD;
of the glass tablet,'thus,-and he suited his actions to his&#xD;
words ; after which we took our seats before the curtain,&#xD;
and I observed that the liquid between the glasses was of&#xD;
such a nature as to reflect a sort of semi-opalescent hue.&#xD;
"'Before proceeding to demonstrate the truth of Hamlet's&#xD;
remark to Horatio,' said the experimenter at my side, 'I&#xD;
find it essential to give you a why and wherefore. Know,&#xD;
then, that not only is there a mysterious and powerful syrn-&#xD;
pathy between man's body and all things outside of it, but it&#xD;
is still more true that a greater one exists between these out-&#xD;
side things and his soul within, as is proved by the astonish-.&#xD;

&#xD;
vegetable preparations that might be named, and every one&#xD;
of which will not merely affect the body, but the tremendous&#xD;
mystery that lies concealed within it. They expand the soul;&#xD;
but they also damn it ! Let us ascend from gross matter to&#xD;
the volatile-Light, for instance. By concave mirrors we can&#xD;
throw an image in open space that shall be seen by thousands.&#xD;
We chain a shadow, and whoever has a photograph possesses&#xD;
one such prisoner. We make a few passes over a glass of&#xD;
water, and charge it thus with any specific quality we choose,&#xD;
nauseous or pleasant, and it produces corresponding effects&#xD;
Upon the patient who takes it. Here you have mind and&#xD;
matter united by an act of mere volition. But we go still&#xD;
further : for we select materials, and with them render the&#xD;
Water still more highly sensitive. We then charge it with&#xD;
our souls, to such an extent that it shall comatize a man's&#xD;
body, and illuminate his soul to the sublimest degree of clair-&#xD;
voyance. Still higher : it is possible to compound a liquid&#xD;
that shall seize on, and for a time. retain, by its subtle power,&#xD;
any mental image thrown upon it. Still higher : there are&#xD;
direct and positive affinities and co-relations between every&#xD;
thing and person on this earth and off it. By certain know-&#xD;
ledge, certain persons are able to select those things that pos-&#xD;
sess certain affinities to and for the inhabitants of the upper&#xD;
worlds, and the dwellers in the Spaces. Now that glass disk&#xD;
before you contains such a liquid, thus compounded-"&#xD;
i here he gave me the most minute explanations of the pro-&#xD;
cess of constructing such curious mirrors, and-how to charge&#xD;
them with a liquid which I at once saw must of necessity be&#xD;

&#xD;
electrical, magnetic, highly odyllic and ethereal.. Then he told&#xD;
me how to charge it differently for different uses-as a toy,&#xD;
a means of medical diagnosis, for the purpose of interpreting&#xD;
dreams, seeing earthly things, discovering lost treasurer,&#xD;
reading the past or the future, and for many otherpurpose;&#xD;
as no one mirror would serve more than one end, or work in&#xD;
more than a single direction, unless specially constructed for&#xD;
such general use, which would render them too costly.&#xD;
"'Properly prepared,' he continued, 'your mirror becomes&#xD;
so amazingly sensitive as to not only receive and retain images&#xD;
of things too subtle for solar light, but to bring out and ren&#xD;
der them visible. Nor is this all. There is light within. light,&#xD;
atmosphere within atmosphere, and intelligent beings who&#xD;
dwell within them, and who can commune with man only&#xD;
through such mirrors, upon which they can photograph thq&#xD;
information they wish to convey, either by scenes depicted&#xD;
therein, or by words projected thereon. Now, observe,&#xD;
Thoughts are things--they are real, substantial actualities, if&#xD;
not actual matter'. They are things that .have shadows,&#xD;
shape, form, outline, bulk. Some are fiat, others are sharg&#xD;
cutting, pointed, and go on boring their way through the&#xD;
world from age to age. Others are solid, round, bulky, and.&#xD;
stagger when they strike you or impinge. upon the world.&#xD;
Thoughts live, die, and grow. Now, attend. Gaze steadily&#xD;
and firmly; desire to see something, no matter what.'&#xD;
" I smiled incredulously, and observed that one could see&#xD;
one's face in any bit of glass.&#xD;
"''True,' replied he, 'but you have never seen your soul ,&#xD;

id this bauble will show you that. It will reveal events&#xD;
already past, that are now occurring, or that will transpire&#xD;
in the future, on the earth or off it.'&#xD;
" " Much doubting what he said,. I told him that, just then,&#xD;
the sceptical mood was on me, and my belief must be forced.&#xD;
He well knew the singular constitution of my mind, and that,&#xD;
in spite of much contrary seeming, I was one of the most ob-&#xD;
durate sceptics concerning the supernatural that ever lived.&#xD;
To most of those who have known me, or read what I have&#xD;
written in past years, it may appear strange that I, who have&#xD;
been the accepted champion of all things spectral, should now&#xD;
make such a seeming confession. But human nature is a very&#xD;
strange- compound !  My heart, my loves, desires, and emo-&#xD;
tional nature were all on the side of the ghostly, and eagerly&#xD;
grasped and nursed the occult and weird ; and when these&#xD;
reigned in my soul I bravely defended the spiritual theory&#xD;
against all comers. I rose to sublime heights of inspiration&#xD;
and speculation, and being thereby rendered morbidly sensitive&#xD;
Saffectional influences, readily yielded to the specious social&#xD;
kophistry of the hour, and, for a while, pursued a course from&#xD;
which, had not reason been utterly blinded, I would have&#xD;
shrunk with ineffable horror ; but, being surrounded by scores&#xD;
of thousands similarly deluded, it was impossible for a wbil'&#xD;
to break through the accursed meshes of this devil's net into&#xD;
ecslear, cool light of truth beyond.&#xD;
'This was one side of the lifemweb I was weaving. But&#xD;
there came moments wherein enthusiasm was exchanged fdr&#xD;

most of what heart had drank in, and challenged the conclu-&#xD;
sions of my own and others' in regard to the Phantom-Philo-&#xD;
sophy. People cried, 'Inconsistent !' 'Variable !' mistaking&#xD;
honesty for whim-and just as if anything or person wasever&#xD;
consistent !&#xD;
" In the present seance, logic held the reigns of mind, and&#xD;
I laughed, which Miakus observing, said : 'Laugh on,-laugh&#xD;
on ; but you must be careful or the laugh will be against you.&#xD;
Truth is a dainty and a jealous dame, and never relishes&#xD;
practical jokes at her expense. But, look ! the mirror begins&#xD;
to operate.' And, instantly bending down, he veiled his face&#xD;
in both his hands, and remained thus for perhaps a minute,&#xD;
when he spoke, saying, 'What see you in the glass ?'&#xD;
"'Nothing,' I replied, 'but the images of -ourselves.'&#xD;
"'Have patience ! Look again ! Try !'&#xD;
"A short silence then followed, when-&#xD;
" 'Do you see anything yet ?'&#xD;
"'Yes ; but nothing extraordinary. Only a clear spot-.&#xD;
an atmospheric-looking aperture in the centre of the glass.&#xD;
Yes ! now   there comes a change-faint, misty, dusky&#xD;
shadows flit across ; but nothing positive or -distinct.',&#xD;
"'Is that all ?'&#xD;
"'It is.'&#xD;
"'Look again.'&#xD;
"'Clearly and distinctly I see the forequarters of a large&#xD;
.greyish-white dog. It grows ! Now it is complete ! -The&#xD;
.image stands out, bold and clear, from the.mirror!'&#xD;
"So perfect was this appearance, that I could not realize&#xD;
&#xD;
that it was a phantasm. The thing was impossible. it&#xD;
looked like the reflection of a dog in a looking-glass, and I&#xD;
actually turned my head, not to look for the dog, but for the&#xD;
picture of one upon the wall, that might have caused the&#xD;
image in the mirror. There was no such picture. The old&#xD;
man enjoyed my surprise, and muttered-.&#xD;
"'Nothing supernatural, ha ?  Remember that idiots,&#xD;
bigots, and fools only dispute the existence of that whieh&#xD;
others do, but they do not understand. True, many pin their&#xD;
faith in a hereafter upon the curious phenomena attributed to&#xD;
disembodied souls, but they err in so doing. The demonstra-&#xD;
-tion can never be afforded through any process of either&#xD;
phenomena or intellection. Of that, be assured. Immor-&#xD;
tality can never be thought ; it must be felt... Your philo-&#xD;
sopher cannot possibly grasp the idea, because it is not an&#xD;
idea at all. It is a reality, and comes to man never through&#xD;
the intellect, but ever and always through other channels of&#xD;
the spirit-comes over roads that begin on earth and ter-&#xD;
minate directly at the foot of God's throne. Thus, when&#xD;
storms fall on the philosophic soul it shrinks and plays the&#xD;
coward. Not so the truly intuitional man. He feels, and,&#xD;
feeling, sees God through the gloom ; and that, to him, is gn&#xD;
insurance against loss or annihilation.. He rides triumphant&#xD;
over circumstances that bar themselves effectually againstall&#xD;
philosophers. Even when the shadow rests heaviest on the&#xD;
sky of life, such a soul beholds God enthroned in- auroral&#xD;
splendor everywhere;. he .catches the sound of his voice from&#xD;
every echoing hill and dell, and it speaks to him of life ever-&#xD;

THE PROOF OF IMMORTALITY.&#xD;

lasting, and its tones carry a thrilling demonstration of an bere-&#xD;
after that all the spiritualism of the earth could never impart.'&#xD;
" Now while I looked upon the mirror I silently marvelled&#xD;
whether it were possible, through that glass, to solve the&#xD;
grand secret of the ages, and the old man's speech could not&#xD;
possibly have been more apropos than it was. But in a mo-&#xD;
ment afterward I felt indignant at having beheld such a&#xD;
figure, when he had promised I should see my soul, and told&#xD;
him so. ' Let not that offend you,' he replied, 'that figure&#xD;
is not spectral, it is correspondential. What is the type of&#xD;
enduring fidelity, perfect trust and confidence, unbounded&#xD;
love 'and faith, if its symbol be not a dog? Such it the&#xD;
quality of your soul, nor is it very bad.'_&#xD;
"There now came a broad clean space on the glass, and&#xD;
the whole of it became clear and pellucid as the finest crys-&#xD;
tal ; and in its very centre appeared a tiny, but very brilliant&#xD;
speck of white light, and its lustre increased till it became&#xD;
painful to gaze upon it. Gradually this expanded, and there&#xD;
came a space in its middle clearer than the brightest noon-&#xD;
day, into which I gazed with rapture, for the intense light&#xD;
faded away into a sort of hazy- vapor surrounding this&#xD;
=pot.&#xD;
'Into such, and through such do I wish you to look&#xD;
for me. But not now. The time is not propitious.&#xD;
That which you behold is the lense of a mystical telescope,&#xD;
wherewith you may scan and sweep the fields where revolve&#xD;
f myriad worlds like this, and of other millions whereof man&#xD;
is yet profoundly ignorant. Through it you can and may&#xD;
&#xD;
120&#xD;
&#xD;
RAVALETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
witness not only the worlds of which I speak, but also their&#xD;
tenants and all that they are doing.'&#xD;
"'What ! Do you mean to tell me that through that&#xD;
telescope, as you call it, a living man can behold all that is&#xD;
going on in Mars and Jupiter?'&#xD;
"'Aye!l' said he, 'and half a million planets, suns and&#xD;
systems more. It will reveal the fate or fortune of any one,&#xD;
alive or dead. But to the proof.' As he spoke, it seemed&#xD;
that a sort of tube of light extended itself toward my eyes,&#xD;
and through it I beheld, as in a diorama, each and all of the&#xD;
terrible and painful scenes of what I believe to be my most&#xD;
recent life on the earth. I beheld all my few joys and suc-&#xD;
cesses, and all the countless agonies of body and soul, by&#xD;
which they had been girdled. Men met the phantom of my-&#xD;
self, with smiles upon their faces, and seemed to speak in&#xD;
honied phrases, to make themselves believed, and then these&#xD;
shadows stabbed at the' listener and he fell, but did not seem&#xD;
to die, for a grisly phantom ever hovered over him, but from&#xD;
pity forbore to strike.&#xD;
" The scene changed. It appeared to be a rural village-.&#xD;
the date, in fiery figures on the corner of the field, was 1852.&#xD;
It was a barber's shop, .and a light, happy-hearted youth&#xD;
was therein pursuing his avocation, and earning bread and&#xD;
health. This youth was apparently gifted to look beyond&#xD;
the veil, and into the dim regions of the dead; and it&#xD;
seemed that this was known,' for presently people flocked&#xD;
about him, and the scene closed.&#xD;

life ; cliques made use of him, flattered his vanity, and he&#xD;
was led into errors of conduct and judgment, but none so&#xD;
great as manifested by others around him ; but, on the in-&#xD;
stant that this man discovered his error, and announced it,&#xD;
ten thousand daggers were levelled at his heart, ten thousand&#xD;
tongues defamed him-and for what?  Because he had been&#xD;
true to his knowledge, his conscience and his God. He fell&#xD;
beneath the strokes of those who had sworn themselves his&#xD;
friends and the friends of all mankind. See him now with&#xD;
his heart bowed down.&#xD;
"It shifts ; and lotI the man, appears again. Consumed&#xD;
by the fires of hatred, envy,'ingratitude and venom of his&#xD;
former friends, he has risen again. ',e renais de mes cendres,'&#xD;
was. the motto on the banner that he floated to the breeze.&#xD;
He changed his mode of life. One of those who were the&#xD;
very first to take him from his labor, and bring him before the&#xD;
world, still clung to him, declared that even death should&#xD;
never alienate him (for the pantomime was as readable as&#xD;
speech), and the deceiver was believed.&#xD;
"Again the phantorama changed. The barber-orator had&#xD;
reached to competence-had gained much gold, a deal of&#xD;
philosophy, and but very little wisdom with it all, for he still&#xD;
blieved the speech of people ;.measured men and women&#xD;
by the standard of his own heart, and believed that honest&#xD;
say was honest mean. He had forgotten that, after all, this&#xD;
is but a baby world, and still went on in the same old way,&#xD;
trusting and suffering.&#xD;
" He had one to provide for-a female relative-in whom&#xD;
&#xD;
his 'neart was bound, but this was not reciprocal. The rela-&#xD;
tion was that of religious duty on his side, and self-interest on&#xD;
hers. Still the man nobly struggled for her-so it seemed-&#xD;
and the picture faded, but another came. His 'friend' by&#xD;
fraud obtained all the man had, and then, with malignant&#xD;
purpose, deLfmed the female to his dupe, having first re-&#xD;
duced the man to beggary.     All this, working on the&#xD;
barber, nearly upset his reason, and the victim raged in his&#xD;
agony, and the financier laughed at him,. and fed sump-&#xD;
tuously, 4aily; and, having previously obtained by double&#xD;
fraud, a signature to the effect that robbery was a legal&#xD;
loan, gloated over the misery he had caused, and denounced&#xD;
the victim himself had made. Once more the picture flew&#xD;
on, years had gone by, the despised man-despised because&#xD;
his skin was darker than his destroyer's-had risen into emi-&#xD;
nence and fame.&#xD;
" It changed again. Disgrace, poverty, the prison and the&#xD;
halter had avenged him.&#xD;
"' The way of the world!I' said Miakus, 'but recollect&#xD;
that&#xD;
"'Ever the Right comes uppermost,&#xD;
And ever is justice done!,&#xD;
What could you expect else from so small a portion of&#xD;
a man ?  Trust no one. This was fate. Fate cannot be&#xD;
evaded. Submit. It will be well in the sequel. WE MAY&#xD;
BE HAPPY YET!I&#xD;

that should be as plain as the pictures of the past had bee&#xD;
and if there was any means whereby the blows of fate might be&#xD;
softened, any field in which to live and act free from the lone-&#xD;
liness hitherto endured, and when next my eyes glanced&#xD;
through the magic tube, there passed across the field of&#xD;
vision a solitary human head and bust. So swiftly did it&#xD;
glide past that only an electric sense of its beauty remained&#xD;
with me, but there was a something that told me the head I&#xD;
saw was that of Evlambda-that by woman alone could re-&#xD;
demption come.   But then the curse said, 'A daughter&#xD;
of Ish,' and she was a child of Japhet.&#xD;
'Scarcely had this figure flitted by than the glass became&#xD;
clouded, black, and finally resumed the appearance it had&#xD;
when first taken from the box.&#xD;
"'Nothing further can be seen to-day,' said Miakus, 1.&#xD;

forth to the world and heal the sick, restore the insane, mako&#xD;
mirrors and the Elixir, and read the past and future, and&#xD;
yet all this is as nothing to that which you may expect after&#xD;
you shall have solemnly sworn to sleep the sleep of Sialam&#xD;
for me.'&#xD;
"Readily acknowledging all he said, gratitude prompted&#xD;
me to assent, and the words were on my lips, when suddeily&#xD;
the same bust and head passed before me very slowly, within&#xD;
one foot of my face. It was unmistakably Eviambda, and&#xD;
the countenance looked tearfully reproachful as it once more&#xD;
disappeared , but even as it did so there came a soft, low,&#xD;
musical voice, but sorrow-toned, say ing: 'When I am in&#xD;

The identical words uttered by the girl at the door of the&#xD;
chief's cottage, years agone, when we had so sadly parted!&#xD;
Thus mysteriously warned, my consent was withheld.&#xD;
Miakus looked pitiful and disappointed. He said nothing,&#xD;
however, but silently repacked his paraphernalia, said he&#xD;
wished me well, and then, passing with me into the street,&#xD;
we struck hands and parted.&#xD;
"It were useless attempting to describe my feelings, conse-&#xD;
quent. upon these strange events. I could not help being&#xD;
grateful for the favors-shown me by the Enigma, and yet was&#xD;
I certain that I had, by ghostly aid, triumphed over a great&#xD;
temptation, and that Miakus might, after all, mean me no&#xD;
good. Involuntarily clinging to the memory of the maiden&#xD;
of the valley, I blessed her from my soul, and offeredup a&#xD;
prayer that, if it were possible, she might be the redeeming&#xD;
angel for whom   my lonely soul so ardently longed ang&#xD;

"'Ywis rolled away," continued Beverly.  "I had visited&#xD;

pose, and knew that I had foresworn wealth and place in&#xD;
favor of usefulness, poverty and knowledge; -and had there&#xD;

of diffusing infinite blessings to all around, languished for&#xD;

"Months passed, and a continent and an ocean lay between&#xD;
the Golden Gate and me. I was on my second journey toward -y&#xD;
the Orient, and had taken London- and Paris on my way.&#xD;
-My objects in the journey were triple : First, to visit the Su-&#xD;
preme Grand Dome of the Rosicrucian Temple ; to make&#xD;
my obeisance to its Grand Master ; to study its higher doc-&#xD;
trines. and visit the Brethren. Second, to obtain the mate-&#xD;

rials, in Jerusalem, for the composition of the Elixir of Life-;&#xD;
not that I intended to make it, but because I wanted to use&#xD;
them in my medical practice, which I purposed to resume on&#xD;
my return to America. And, third, I needed rest, relaxar&#xD;
tion, and change of scene ; for I felt that if I did not go,&#xD;
what between the fraud I had suffered, the wretch's scan-.&#xD;
dal, the woman, the dead child in the cemetery, and a vari-&#xD;
ety of other troubles, I should die; and if I died-what then?&#xD;
-And so I went.&#xD;

" The scene I now present before you is Paris ; the date,&#xD;
any day you choose to imagine between the 16th of August,&#xD;
1863, and the 11th of June, 1854. I had just contracted&#xD;
for an anatomical Venus and cabinet, designed for one of&#xD;
the Rosicrucian Lodges in America, and had paid out some&#xD;
fourteen hundred dollars thereon, when, being weary, L&#xD;
strolled to the Batignolles, from there to La Plaissance&#xD;
and - Luxembourg, when I met a person whom I had-known&#xD;
in London, and he advised me by all means to again visit the&#xD;
Emperor, and also to go to certain localities named, before I&#xD;
left Paris. Promising that the advice should be followed, I&#xD;
accordingly on day found myself in the Palace of the Louvre,&#xD;
not for the first time, however, but for, perhaps, the tenth.&#xD;
On each of these,  ions my time had been mainly spent&#xD;
admiring and examining the contents of the Galleries Ass&#xD;
riewne and Egyptienne. The bas-reliefs, or coarse engravings&#xD;
rather, had commanded my attention on previous occasions,&#xD;
along with the sphinxes of Rhampses and Menepthah, as&#xD;

well a, the curious statues of.Amenophis, Sevekhatep, Osi.&#xD;
ris aid Seti, from all of which I had learned much of that&#xD;
strange civilization of the long-agone, usually assigned to the&#xD;
past four thousand five hundred years, but which had in re-&#xD;
ality utterly perished from off the:earth at least ten thousand&#xD;
years earlier than the first year of that dateI for, but a lit-P&#xD;
tle while before I saw those statues Mariette had exhumed&#xD;
from the sands of Egypt, the celebrated sarcophagi and&#xD;
mummy, to which the best Egyptologers, including the Che-&#xD;
valier Bunsen, had, with one voice, assigned an age of not&#xD;
les than twelve thousand years.&#xD;
' On this visit I stood rapt in wonder and conjecture before&#xD;
the euneiform inscriptions upon a series of tablets, and which&#xD;
archaeojogy has never yet interpreted-Bunsen, Layard,&#xD;

'age, air, and manner-refined, polished,.yet simple in the&#xD;

"On previous occasions when we met there ha4 passed&#xD;
between us merely the compliments of the day, and those&#xD;
general courtesies due between well-4red people. This time,&#xD;
however, as if by mutual concession .and attra ctien, our&#xD;
greeting was much warmer and more prol-nged; for, after&#xD;
saluting, we drew chairs .before the tablets and began con-&#xD;
versing about the arrow-headed characters ; and the old&#xD;
gentleman, whose name was .avalette, said : 'Sir, how is&#xD;
it that I see you daily pere, taking copies, and. trying tode-&#xD;
cypher .letters that the bst scholars in Eirope have aban-&#xD;

"'True,' was the reply, 'they may despair, but is that a&#xD;
reason why others should?  I believe I shall yet correctly&#xD;

merely remarked, that 1eses and the chronologists had bet-&#xD;

there are at least ten separate an, distinct families of human&#xD;

upon a wide separation of the constituents of an original&#xD;

"'No ; because that will not account for different lan-&#xD;

'Well,' said Ravalette, 'ou inform me that you desire&#xD;
to learn, being already learned to some extent. The views&#xD;
you entertain upon the Past are, in some sense, consonant&#xD;
with my own ; and if you are willing to be taught, I an&#xD;

" I was delighted to hear Ravalette talk in this manner ;&#xD;
for I felt that he was in some sort, notwithstanding ow rela-&#xD;
tive disparity of years, a congenial spirit, and I longed for him&#xD;
to unfold to me the rich fabric of his thought and experience.&#xD;
I had concluded, from a word dropped here and there, that&#xD;
he was at heart a believer in the Faith of Christendom, but&#xD;
in order to silence the lingering doubt I still entertained on&#xD;
that point, I put to him the following questions, and atten-&#xD;
tively noted the substance of his somewhat curious responses&#xD;
thereto.&#xD;
"1st. Question. 'You, Monsieur Ravalette, have doubtless&#xD;
travelled much, and seen a great deal of this world of ours ?'&#xD;
"Here he interrupted me by saying, 'And several others&#xD;
beside ' I asked for an explanation, but he merely waved&#xD;
his hand'and. motioned me to go on. - I did so. 'Let me&#xD;
ask you if the result of your observations abroad, amongst&#xD;
men of different nations and faith-complexions, has not&#xD;
been a strengthening of your belief in the Mosaic teach-&#xD;
ings, generally, and in what is popularly known as Chris-&#xD;
tianity?'&#xD;
"Answer. 'No i In the many countries I have visited&#xD;
I found human nature essentially the same as we find it here&#xD;
in France. Men are ever the same at heart. Inwardly&#xD;
they are all alike, sincere, beautiful, good, and religious ; out-&#xD;
wardly, the same selfish, heedless, careless, and materialistic&#xD;
beings, as untamable, set, willful, and unreasonable as the&#xD;
heartiest cynic could wish.&#xD;

call believed, but practically ignored and set aside on the&#xD;
sore of inexpediency.&#xD;
In all my travels I found but one religion, yet that&#xD;
religion passed current under a vast variety of names. All&#xD;
men alike believed in-good and evil, a Heaven of some port,&#xD;
and some sort of Hell likewise.  I found that while at&#xD;
bottom Faith was everywhere the same, yet the names by&#xD;
which that faith was known, differed widely in different&#xD;
places and latitudes. For instance, I found that the Catho-&#xD;
lic or Papal, the Protestant or reformed, the Hindoo and&#xD;
Brahminical, the Boodhistic, Lamaic, Greek, Polytheistic,&#xD;
4theistic, Deistic, Magian, Guebre, Islamic, Fetisch, and&#xD;
all other systems and modes of belief, were, instead of being&#xD;
antipodal, in fact the same at bottom. This may surprise&#xD;
you. Doubtless it would, were I to leave the subject just as&#xD;
it is. But I will explain. They are all one at bottom, inas-&#xD;
much as that each and all of their respective and apparently&#xD;
dissimilar devotees do homage at the same 'shrine, of the&#xD;
sae( Great Mystery. The modes and names differ with&#xD;
latitude, but the meaning and the principle are everywhere&#xD;
the same.&#xD;
"'Popular estimate or opinion can never be a true crite-&#xD;
rion either of persons, thoughts, events, principles, or things..&#xD;
We grow daily beyond our yesterdays, and are ever reaching&#xD;
forth for the morrow. The world has had a long night, as it&#xD;
has had brght days; and now another morn is breaking,&#xD;
and we stand in the door of the dawn.&#xD;
"'1 agree with you that conld the dates on the tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
here before us, !e revealed, they would prove that human&#xD;
history really extends much further back into the night&#xD;
of Time than    the period %assigned  by  Moses as its&#xD;

human n monuments are in existence that indubitably&#xD;
prove not only that the world is much older than people give&#xD;
it credit for, bt also that civilizations, arts, sciences, philo-&#xD;

what exists, to-day, have blessed the earth in by-gone ages,&#xD;
and been swept away, leaving only scattered vestiges of the&#xD;
wrepk behind to inform posterity that such things have been,&#xD;
but are not.&#xD;
"' But whit .is still stronger food for thought, is the fact&#xD;
that amidst these ruins of the dead Ages, we find .others that&#xD;
are evidently relics of times and civilizations still more&#xD;
remote-the debriss of a world-wreck remembered only by&#xD;
the seraphim ! A demonstration of-this assertion is found in&#xD;
the pyramids, the date and purpose even of the building of&#xD;
which is wrapped in conjecture, and has been for age past.&#xD;
The authentic history of Egypt can be traced for over 6,000&#xD;
years, yet .even J4 that remote past the pyramids were..&#xD;

have elapsed since it did occur ! Now I foresee an objection&#xD;
in your mind. " How is it known that the ancient diagrams&#xD;
refer to any two particular stellar bodies ?"  -&#xD;

what has been exhumed from Earth's bosom. In that city&#xD;
of palaces is the wreck of one, which, from its situation with&#xD;
respect to other ruins, must have been merely a third or&#xD;
fourth-rate edifice in the golden days when AzNAt flou-&#xD;
rished ; yet the portico of this fourth-rate structure, situated&#xD;
in a suburb of the city, the name of which suburb was&#xD;
KARNAK, consisted of 144 Porphyritic columns, 26 feet&#xD;
6 inches apart. Each one was 39 feet 5 inches in circum-&#xD;
ference, and not less than 52 feet- high, and every one was&#xD;
hewn out of a single stone !&#xD;
"'Moreover, this fourth-rate palace was two miles, five&#xD;
furlongs, and eight feet long, by actual measurement of the&#xD;
ruins, and it required a journey of quite nine miles to go&#xD;
around it.&#xD;
"' This palace faced the Sacred River (Nile), from which&#xD;
led a broad avenue lined with colossal statues on each side, as&#xD;
close as they could stand, for a distance of over one English&#xD;
league, and every one of these statues commemorated either&#xD;
a king or a dynasty of that more than regal country.&#xD;
"' Now, mark what I say : Proof, positive proof exists&#xD;
that this palace, itself so imperial, so grand, so immeasurably&#xD;
superior to aught of the kind attempted by man in this&#xD;
"Progressive age (?)" was, after all, but a mere addition,&#xD;
an inconsiderable wing, a sort of appendage, a kind of out-&#xD;
house to one of the main edifices of that immortal city.&#xD;

"'Railways I steam  power ! wheels ! pulleys ! screws !&#xD;

"'Sir, all these things existed long ago, else how could so-&#xD;
lid obelisks of five hundred tons weight have been transported&#xD;
a distance exceeding one thousand one hundred miles, from&#xD;
the :nmuntains where they were hewn, to the places where&#xD;
they were set up, and where we. find them to-day ?&#xD;
"'Without all the appliances enumerated, how could these&#xD;
monuments, some of which measure eighty-nine. feet in length,&#xD;
have been erected after they were brought ; and take notice,&#xD;
that some 'of these stone monsters were placed upon pedes-&#xD;
tals, themselves ten or twelve feet high ?    .&#xD;
"' It would strain the treasury of a modern state to pay the&#xD;
expense attendant upon the erection of jalf-a-dozen ,such-as&#xD;
was proved here in Paris in the case of the Obelisk .of Luxor,&#xD;
the smallest of two that stood before the Temple of Thebes,&#xD;
and which cost France over two million dollars to place where&#xD;
it now stands. Without steam power and railways, how could&#xD;
such immense masses of stone have been transported over and&#xD;
through vast plains of shifting, 'burning sands, especially for&#xD;
such immense distances as it is certain: they were brought?&#xD;
A :ingle further remark on chronology, and I-have done.. It&#xD;
has been established among the learned, that it -takes not less&#xD;
than a period of ten thousand years for a language to be&#xD;
perfected, and then .die ,out, to give place to ian improved&#xD;
but entirely different one. Now, observe : Champollion de-&#xD;
&#xD;
clares that he, through the assistance of modern Egyptian,&#xD;
was able to master ancient Egyptian. This furnished a key&#xD;
to certain hieroglyphs; these latter proved instrumental to-&#xD;
ward simplifying a series of three more. He concludes that&#xD;
he has sufficient evidence to establish the fact, that several&#xD;
successive languages had been spoken in the two Egypts&#xD;
(Upper and Lower).&#xD;
"'But let us return to the original topic of conversation.&#xD;
How is it that you expect a mere dream will aid you in&#xD;
researches of a nature so profound as these ? How do y6u&#xD;
suppose that a mere idle dream, even supposing you to have&#xD;
one on the subject, could furnish you with the key ? There&#xD;
might be fifty persons, or fifty thousand, for that matter,&#xD;
each one of whom might feel an interest and have a dream&#xD;
about it, and, like yourself, discover a fancied key, and yet&#xD;
upon comparing notes no two dreams and no two keys would&#xD;
be found alike amongst the whole fifty or fifty thousand !'&#xD;
"Vulgarly, this was a ' poser;' still, an answer was ex-&#xD;
pected, and so I said: 'Very true, there might ; but the true&#xD;
key would be that which, whenever and wherever it was ap-&#xD;
plied, would yield uniform and concordant results.'&#xD;
" This reply appeared satisfactory to the old gentleman,&#xD;
who, after a little further conversation, invited me to-attend&#xD;
him to his residence and partake of a dinner with him at his&#xD;
own table. 'Tis but a short and pleasant walk,' sid he ;&#xD;

old gentleman's arm, and together we proceeded to his resi-&#xD;
dence-which I found to be one of those stately old man-&#xD;
sions built by the nobless of the times of Louis le Grande.&#xD;
We entered, and in due time sat down to a repast at once&#xD;
rich, liberal and. friendly, .and which gave me a very high no-&#xD;
tion of the man who presided over it. Wine of the rarest&#xD;
graced his board ; plate of the richest adorned it ; servants&#xD;
most attentive served it ; coffee of the best followed, and to-&#xD;
bacco of the finest finished it ; all of which strengthened&#xD;
Ravalette in my esteem. After partaking of his elegant hos-,&#xD;
pitality, he proposed a walk, and accordingly we withdrew&#xD;
from the -house together, and arm in arm strolled into the&#xD;
Rue du Temple, and kept that route until we reached the&#xD;
limit of Paris in that direction, and entered one of its suburbs&#xD;
known as Belleville.&#xD;
"Before quitting the street where I dined, I had taken&#xD;
the precaution to. mark well the locality of the house, and to&#xD;
note its number on my ivory tablets, which I invariably car'&#xD;
ried with me.&#xD;
"And now we-ascended the hills overlooking Paris ; and&#xD;
then we descended to the plain, and gratified the eye in view-&#xD;
ing the rich market gardens, and the conservatories-of ch ice&#xD;
and rare flowers, cultured carefully for the tri-weekly  ar-&#xD;
kets on the esplanade de la Madeleine and the Chateau'&#xD;
d'Eau. Again ascending the hill, we entered a cafe together,&#xD;
and together partook of some frozen coffee and other ices,&#xD;
after which he took me to see a guinguette--or tea garden-&#xD;
lately established for the common people, where the custo.-&#xD;
&#xD;
mer for ten sous might ape royalty, and sip his coffee from&#xD;
silver cups, and take his wine from Sbvres porcelain. Here&#xD;
we both talked to the proprietor concerning the novelty of&#xD;
his enterprise, and made inquiries as to whether his customers&#xD;
-who were all of the lower classes of society-did not bear&#xD;
a great-deal of watching; and whether they did not now and&#xD;
then run off with a few silver spoons, a chased goblet, or a&#xD;
silver-gilt fruit dish ?&#xD;
" ' No,' replied the man, 'I have seen enough of life and&#xD;
mankind to warrant the step, apparently foolish, certainly&#xD;
quite novel, which I have taken ; and I have found out that,&#xD;
treat a man as if you regarded him a thief, and you do muck&#xD;
toward making him one. Watch a man closely, and you&#xD;
that instant suggest rascally thoughts to him, which may&#xD;
bear fruit, and that fruit be crime. . But place full and free&#xD;
confidence in those you' deal with, and let the fact be known,&#xD;
and your conduct sanction your words, and take my word for&#xD;
it, your confidence will very rarely be abused, if at all. My&#xD;
place is the resort of thousands ; my invested capital is&#xD;
large, yet I have never lost ten francs from the costly expe-&#xD;
riment of making the poor man realize the comforts and&#xD;
habits of the rich at the expense of ten sous.'&#xD;
"'We -.could but admire the tact of Monsieur Popin-&#xD;
arde, and frankly told him so as we left his place, for we felt&#xD;
that there was a rich vein of truth at the bottom of his philo-&#xD;

place, Ravalette and myself, still arm in arm, pursued our&#xD;

birds, the quietude of the deep green canopy of leaves, the&#xD;
hLnming of distant sounds, and the serenity of unruffled&#xD;
spirits, we entered upon the discussion of a topic of singular&#xD;
interest. That topic was, 'The human soul, and its resources.'&#xD;
I shall only record the latter part of. this conversation. Said&#xD;
the old gentleman-&#xD;
"'Then you really believe, as did a very ancient society of&#xD;
philosophers, known to some students of the past as the&#xD;
Sacred Twenty-four, that there is a kind of natural magic in&#xD;
existence, far more wonderful in its results than the lamp of&#xD;
Aladdin, or the ring of the Genii?'&#xD;
"' Most certainly I do.'&#xD;
"'How have you learned of its existence, and how do you&#xD;
propose to become a noviciate, and avail yourself thereof for&#xD;
certain contemplated translations?  Perhaps you believe in&#xD;
Elfins, Fairies, Genii and Magicians ?' said he, half laughingly.&#xD;
I do not absolutely know,' I replied, 'that such a&#xD;
magic exists, yet. firmly believe it does. The idea came to&#xD;
me I know not how. By striving, perhaps, it may be found.&#xD;
There are steps leading to it, doubtless, and, if we can discover&#xD;
the first (which I think we have already in Mesmerism), we,&#xD;
can follow till we reach the great goal. I do not believe that&#xD;
Elfins, Fairies, Genii and Magicians are altogether mythical&#xD;
personages. There must, it seems to me, be a foundation of&#xD;
truth underlying the rich and varied accounts of such beings&#xD;
that have filled, and still do fill the reading world with&#xD;
yonder.'&#xD;
&#xD;
CAN YOU ANSWER ME THAT?&#xD;
&#xD;
141&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Very good. But, tell me, have you an idea that such&#xD;
things belong to this world or the world of spirits ?'&#xD;
" At that instant it seemed as if I lost my self-hood, and&#xD;
that a power foreign to my soul for a moment seized my&#xD;
organs and answered for me-.&#xD;
" 'They belong to neither, but to a different world!'&#xD;
"Ravalette, at this answer, looked in astonishment ;and,&#xD;
after gazing attentively at me for nearly a minute, muttered,&#xD;
in an almost indistinguishable tone, the words, 'It shall be&#xD;
Tou spoke of Mesmerism as the first step toward the true&#xD;
magic, which you believe, and I know exists ; and you thought&#xD;
it might be made successful use of in the obtainment of know-&#xD;
ledge not to be arrived at by or through ordinary means,&#xD;
methods or agencies. Tell me in what manner ?  Surely not&#xD;
through ordinary clairvoyance, which ever reveals foregone&#xD;
facts, and none other ; and, therefore, can be of little use to&#xD;
the true student ? You believe, as I do myself, that all ancient&#xD;
history, as it comes to us, is at best a mere fable, or bundle of&#xD;
myths generally, albeit, certain portions are composed of ro-&#xD;
mance, that is to say, are tales of fiction founded on a -basis of&#xD;
fact, the superstructure being ten thousand times larger than&#xD;
the foundations would justify, provided things went at their&#xD;
proper value and importance. How, then, through the ines-&#xD;
meric force, do you expect to dive beneath this superincumbent&#xD;
ocean of fancy, and fetch up what few grains of truth yet&#xD;
sparkle at the bottom ?  Can you answer me that ?'&#xD;
"Ravalette smiled, gazed sorrowfully at me, and then&#xD;
went on-&#xD;

RAVALETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Believe me, my excellent young friend, that Mesmerism&#xD;
is a fine thing for inducing a "superior condition," enabling one&#xD;
to write books which send their readers to suicides' graves&#xD;
to discover the art of marrying other people's spouses ; for&#xD;
procuring " Air-line " dispatches, and filling lunatic asylums&#xD;
with poor reason-bereft creatures ; for stultifying a man's&#xD;
conscience, and for emboldening one to pass for a philosopher&#xD;
when one is but an ass!1' and Ravalette smiled gravely.&#xD;
'Distrust all mesmeric railways,' said he, 'for many of the&#xD;
passengers, like Andrew Jackson Davis, after riding on that&#xD;
train for many years, have landed either in the .swamps and&#xD;
mires of fantasy, or on the sides of moonshine mountains,&#xD;
called " Mornia," and "Hornia," " Forlornia," and " Starnos,"&#xD;
and "Sternas, " and "Cor," and " Hor," and " Bore," " dup.&#xD;
turion," and " Spewrion," and forty thousand more!1'&#xD;
" I bit my lip with vexation ; for I had devoutly believed&#xD;
in and loved the subject and its advocates. I had always&#xD;
loved Davis, and highly admired his philosophy and writings,&#xD;
especially since a great free convention he once held in Cen-&#xD;
tral New York.. I was aware that he had foes-people who&#xD;
refused to believe .that God had appointed him his mouth-&#xD;
piece ; who pointed to the graveyard in Quincey, Massachu-&#xD;
setts, where lie the bodies of John and Hannah Grieves,&#xD;
surmounted by a stone that tells that these poor suicides&#xD;
came. there, lost, ruined, from reading his books. I was&#xD;
well aware that there were painful rumors concerning a&#xD;
couple of divorces,' and that some friends of mine had cut their&#xD;
throats in order to all the quicker reach the 'Summer-land'&#xD;

U&#xD;

&#xD;
which he so elegantly described; but still I loved-still love&#xD;
him dearly. But now, when Ravalette suggested that he&#xD;
was a humbug, it struck me that-Ravalette was right ; for I&#xD;
suddenly recollected that once the great clairvoyant lost a&#xD;
little dog named 'Dick,' which his seersluip could not trace.&#xD;
I remembeitd that nineteen-twentieths of his prophecies from&#xD;
the 'superior condition' never came to pass, while the twen-&#xD;
tieth any school-boy could guess at. I recalled the fact that&#xD;
his philosophy was most decidedly medical-highly emetic, and&#xD;
very cathartic-and that his followers soon lost what little&#xD;
common-sense they formerly had, else it were impossible for&#xD;
them to accept the teachings of one who constantly contra-&#xD;
dicted himself. Still, I respected and loved him dearly, albeit&#xD;
Ravalette had utterly demolished his pretensions ; and I saw&#xD;
clearly that, in believing the stuff he wrote and talked, I was&#xD;
like one who reads 'Jack the Giant-killer,' or 'Gulliver's&#xD;
Travels,' or 'Baron Munchaussen,' and believes the stories&#xD;
real and true."&#xD;

nothing. In fact, most of the popular clairvoyance may be&#xD;
said to resemble an edifice having&#xD;
' Rich windows that exclude the light,&#xD;
And passages that lead to nothing.'&#xD;
There are, of course, a few, very few exceptions to the rule,&#xD;
b'ut the rule obtains vastly,.&#xD;
"'The sentimentalities of a puling, hysteric girl, half afflicted&#xD;
f&#xD;
with catochus, and the other half love-sick--as most modern&#xD;
clairvoyants are---count small in the list of Fact-truths, and&#xD;
the mad ravings of crack-brained somnambules of the other&#xD;
gender go for hardly as much, for the first has at least a de-&#xD;
gree of poetry about her, but the latter none at all. No, no&#xD;
friend, do not place too great reliance on the ability of Mag-&#xD;
netism to aid your researches, for you will run a narrow&#xD;
chance of disappointment, and regret when too late that from&#xD;
Nature's stable you selected the very worst animal of -the&#xD;
lot ; one that is ring-boned, lame, spavined, and very baulky&#xD;
withal. Take my advice, and choose a better.'&#xD;
As the old gentleman finished what I at first regarded&#xD;
as a diatribe against Animal Magnetism--a thing, by the&#xD;
way, that I always doted on---I felt silent, and was so for&#xD;
the space of a minute, during which time I rap y reviewed&#xD;
my entire experience in, and knowledge of, Menterism, and&#xD;
the result of the inspection surprised me not a little,:for on a&#xD;
calm, disinterested view of the whole subject, I found it ut-&#xD;
terly impossible to gainsay or invalidate his position and as-&#xD;
sertions.  Yet it was equally impossible to help feeling&#xD;

&#xD;
chagrined, and in no small degree mortified to have my pet&#xD;
hobby thus mercilessly cut up and dissected, laughed at, and&#xD;
thrown out as dog-deed. 'Twas very hard fare, at least to&#xD;
me, and at first seemed unfair also. For a long time I had:&#xD;
almost worshipped it as a divine science; holding it to be the&#xD;
true Spiritual Telegraph, by means of which we earthlings'&#xD;
might flash thought, not. only to the bounds of the globe and&#xD;
the Present, but also to the ends of Time and the Ages Past,&#xD;
or nerved by Hope and Curiosity, dispatch a message to the&#xD;
Great Future and drag back the answer. It was looked&#xD;
upon as the great Messenger of Light, through whom we&#xD;
might easily read the records of a Past so distant that the&#xD;
coal-beds are but yesterday's creations in comparison. And&#xD;
here, at one fell stroke, Ravalette had toppled the castle re-&#xD;
owrselessly about my ears  I bit my lip with vexation, and&#xD;
ur awhile' was silent as, together, we walked up and down a&#xD;
sort of natural esplanade on the sides of the hill next Paris.&#xD;
Mechanically as we walked back and forth, I trod in the&#xD;
footprints made while going, on each return, and just as me-&#xD;
chanically observed that Ravalette did the same. One&#xD;
thing struck me as curious,' even while my mind was pro-&#xD;
foundly engaged in the search for arguments wherewith to&#xD;
confute and break down the old gentleman's positions; and&#xD;
that fact was this : The shoes worn by Ravalette were of a&#xD;
very singular pattern, totally unlike any I had ever seen be-&#xD;
fore  Upwardly, they were decidedly triangular-almost&#xD;
perfectly so. Previously this fact had escaped my notice ;&#xD;
low, it struck me as being very singular. But what was&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I-&#xD;
&#xD;
CU1EIOU8 INSIGNIA.;&#xD;
&#xD;
147&#xD;
&#xD;
equally surprising was, that instead of the ordinary heel and&#xD;
sole, his feet-gear had four circular rims of brass, covered&#xD;
with rubber, and the track, he made on the yielding, but&#xD;
plastic ground was indeed remarkable. The track and the&#xD;
shoe almost upset my cogitations. I looked up and observed&#xD;
a smile on Ravalette's face as he saw my surprise at behold-&#xD;
ing the novelty of one cross, two crescents and two triangles,&#xD;
and a solid bar (part of the dross), ornamenting the sole of&#xD;
a shoe, if shoe it could be called.&#xD;
"'That,' said he, divining my thought, 'is and yet is not&#xD;
a mere fancy of mine. I have a peculiar reverence for those&#xD;
figures, as you may plainly see.' And with this he drew my&#xD;
attention to an exquisite brooch or pin in his bosom.&#xD;
" This rare jewel, which I had previously seen but not&#xD;
noticed particularly, consisted of a triangle formed of a&#xD;
crescent or quarter circle and a compass, or, as the instru-&#xD;
ment is improperly called, a pair of compasses. In the&#xD;
centre of this was a tiny cross formed of minute stars, and&#xD;
just where the two bars met was a rose just blooming, and&#xD;
colored with enamel to the life. Gazing still closer at this&#xD;
novel breastpin, with the aid of a fine eye-glass, I discovered&#xD;
a legend engraved in minute and-strange characters upon the&#xD;
rim of the crescent ; upon the left quarter of this crescent&#xD;
was a pelican feeding her young with her heart's blood ;&#xD;
midway was a tiny black rose, and on the right corner was&#xD;
one of deep crimson.&#xD;
. The workmanship was exquisite, indeed quite extraordi-&#xD;
nary, for the entire jewel was not larger than a golden dollar&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7538-00000075"/>&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
148&#xD;
&#xD;
RAVAkETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
He also showed me a large and massive seal, pendent from&#xD;
his watch, and on its face was engraved a ladder of twelve&#xD;
steps, the first and fifth of which were broken. The foot of&#xD;
this ladder rested upon a broken column, near which lay a&#xD;
mason's trowel, and its top leaned against the beam and ring&#xD;
of an anchor, reversed, the lower part being lost in what&#xD;
represented a cloud. After I had suffciently admired the&#xD;
seal, he semi-playfully drew forth his watch, to which it was&#xD;
attached by a fine gold 'rope'-chain, and observed: 'I have&#xD;
more of the same kind,' at the same time placing it in my&#xD;
hand,&#xD;
"The watch was an ordinary smooth-backed, hunting.&#xD;
cased gold chronometer, worth perhaps fifty or sixty pounds&#xD;
sterling, the extra value being acquired by an anchor fouled,&#xD;
done in diamond points upon the internal face. The o po-&#xD;
site side presented some excellent enamel-work representing&#xD;
the cardinal points of the compass. Three stars gave light&#xD;
from the West; a tomb, with its door partly open, stood in&#xD;
the East ; broken columns adorned the South ; and a circle&#xD;
composed of small triangles was in the North ; in the centre&#xD;
of this circle was a rose on the bars of a dotted cross; the&#xD;
whole executed in the same exquisite style as that marking&#xD;
the seal and pin.&#xD;
"To a question as to what it all meant, an evasive answer&#xD;
was returned. Waiving all my solicitations to explain the&#xD;
emblematic devices, the old gentleman resumed his remarks,&#xD;
byobserving : 'Never mind now what these- things mean ;&#xD;
.you will know one of these days. At .present let us continue&#xD;
&#xD;
HUMAN MAGNETISM-&#xD;
&#xD;
149&#xD;
&#xD;
our talk on other matters. A little while ago you observed&#xD;
that Mesmerism was a force Spiritual ; but I am not so&#xD;
sure that you are correct. In my view it is a power Phy&#xD;
sical-ultra physical or material it' may be, but physical&#xD;
still.'&#xD;
" ' What!t' said I, in amazement, 'human magnetism, that&#xD;
mighty agent or power, which effects such grand effects, and&#xD;
works such wonderful effects, Physical ?  Impossible !  The&#xD;
very idea, excuse me, is absurd ; the assertion is simply ridi-&#xD;
culous !'&#xD;
"'So I once thought,' rejoined Ravalette, 'but think so&#xD;
no longer ; and, mark me, the time is not very distant when&#xD;
you will come to my side of the question. I will endeavor&#xD;
to illustrate the point, one point of many, that comfirms my&#xD;
view. For instance, the serpent tribe. We know      that&#xD;
those reptiles charm birds and other animals, and that they&#xD;
exert an influence upon their prey precisely like that exerted&#xD;
by the magnetizer upon his subject, with this difference, that&#xD;
the human subject exhibits none of that peculiar terror mani-&#xD;
fested by the lower orders of being when under the spell of&#xD;
fascination, and this difference arises from the fact that the,&#xD;
animal has a clear instinct that the power is exercised for its&#xD;
destruction, which the human subject is, of course, entirely&#xD;
free from.&#xD;
"' We see the snake exert the same marvellous power that&#xD;
the human magnetizer does, and observe effects resulting&#xD;
therefrom no less remarkable, and yet no- one for an instant&#xD;
supposes that serpents are spiritual beings '&#xD;

&#xD;
RAVALETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Now you are completely at my mercy.' thought I,&#xD;
as I responded : 'Certainly the snake is a spiritual being&#xD;
so long as he is alive, and exerts volition. He is a spiri-&#xD;
tual thing-just as much as you or I.'&#xD;
"'And dead ?' said Ravalette, inquiringly, 'is a mere&#xD;
lump of clay--nothing more.&#xD;
"'Then, Monsi ;ur Beverly, the argument is against you,&#xD;
and is mine par -un coup majestique ! for the snake charms&#xD;
just as powerfully when his skin is stuffed with straw and&#xD;
cotton, as when with his own proper flesh, blood, and bones.&#xD;
Innumerable experiments, instituted expressly to test this&#xD;
question, have been made, and it, has been over and over&#xD;
again decided that the charming or fascinating power is just&#xD;
as strong after as previous to death.  This has been settled&#xD;
by the actions of birds, who utter the same plaintive and pa-&#xD;
thetic cries, exhibit the same terror and other phenomena, in&#xD;
presence of a stuffed as in that of a living serpent., This is&#xD;
a strong point in my favor; but one that is still stronger, in-&#xD;
deed quite irrefutable, shall now be adduced. Persons em-&#xD;
ployed in the fardin des Plants, and other zoological institu-&#xD;
tions, find it dangerous work to clean out the dens of certain&#xD;
serpents, even for weeks after the occupants have been re-&#xD;
m ved, for the effiuvium--which, I take it, you will not&#xD;
cla 1 to be other than physical-which they have left behind,&#xD;
and hich constantly exhales from the floor and sides of the&#xD;
den, is ound to be identical with that aura or sphere which&#xD;
it is known they exhale when excited by the presence of&#xD;
prey : 9nd the effects of this emanation from the den are&#xD;
&#xD;
A SINGULAR EXPERIMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
151&#xD;
&#xD;
precisely those that characterize the action of the living, pre-&#xD;
sent, excited snake. Now, these facts had long been noticed,&#xD;
and the results attributed to the fancy of the human subject,&#xD;
until, at length, an unusual circumstance led to the institu-&#xD;
tion of a course of experiments to set the matter at rest for-&#xD;
&#xD;
ever.&#xD;
India is the paradise of charring snakes, and a com-&#xD;
mission was sent thither by the joint governments of Eng-&#xD;
land and France, to test this matter thoroughly. This com-&#xD;
mission settled upon Candeish, a province of the Decan,&#xD;
where serpents most abound, and the experiments were made&#xD;
simultaneously in the towns of Nunderbar, Sindwa, Dowlea,&#xD;
Chapra, Jamneer, Maligaum, Chundoor, Kurgoon, Chorwa;&#xD;
Bejagur, Hurdwa, Asseergurh, Hashungabad, and Boor-&#xD;
humpore ; and they were made with thirty different species&#xD;
of serpents, on eleven hundred and fifty-three human subjects,&#xD;
of twenty-three different nations, and all sorts of tempera-&#xD;
ments. First, these persons were subjected-under proper'&#xD;
precautions, of course-to the mesmeric glance of hungry,&#xD;
quiet, and enraged serpents. In all three cases the effects&#xD;
were bad, all the subjects alike complaining of constriction of&#xD;
the chest, loss of memory, and a very strange sort of vertigo.&#xD;
As soon as the last. symptom manifested itself, the curtain&#xD;
that separated the serpents from the men was dropped, and&#xD;
proper baths and other restoratives resorted to. Secondly-&#xD;
these same persons were all invited subsequently to a feast,&#xD;
as a reward for their services. Serpents were securely fast-&#xD;
ened in wooden boxes beneath the seats of three hundred&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
and sixteen of them, and of these two hundred and eighty.&#xD;
four manifested the same symptoms as when under the direct&#xD;
gaze of the serpents. Two months afterwards ninety-four of&#xD;
the same persons, unknown to themselves, were placed to work&#xD;
in an apartment built of the boards that had composed the&#xD;
serpent dens, and the effects, a third time, were absolutely&#xD;
identical ! Now, in this light, what becomes of your spirit-&#xD;
ual hypothesis ! It is gone to the four winds of earth. But&#xD;
to set the matter entirely at rest, and to give your spiritual&#xD;
notion respecting Mesmerism its eternal quietus, let me call&#xD;
your attention to the fact that if a man, any man, sits before&#xD;
a swinging disk of black glass, and fixes his eye upon it, he&#xD;
will eventually be as deeply magnetized and as lucidly clair.&#xD;
voyant, as he would under the operation of the most power&#xD;
ful magnetizer on the globe!l'.&#xD;
"I felt that the tables were turned, and that the old&#xD;
gentleman held me at his mercy. However, he forbore to&#xD;
triumph, but went on; saying--&#xD;
"' I do not say that the soul of man is physical, but I&#xD;
know that his spirit is so ; for I proved that over sixty&#xD;
years ago, to my complete and entire satisfaction. Do not,&#xD;
I beg you, consider me a Materialist, or that I dispute the&#xD;
existence of spirit. Far from that ! Your humble servant&#xD;
is a firm believer, not only in spirit, but in a great Spirit-&#xD;
ual Kingdom, more vast, varied, and beautiful than&#xD;
this Material one; and believe .me, mon amri, when I affirm&#xD;
that-. not more that one man in ten thousand has any&#xD;
adequate idea of what he means when pronouncing the&#xD;
&#xD;
IS IT r'OSSIrL1 ?&#xD;
&#xD;
158&#xD;
&#xD;
word Spirit ; not one man in thrice that number can properly&#xD;
define it.&#xD;
"'Furthermore, as a prehiade to what may yet befall you,&#xD;
permit me to say that, in the face of modern philosophy, and&#xD;
in direct contrariety to popular belief, it is my opinion that&#xD;
spirit cannot produce on spirit the singular movements and&#xD;
effects witnessed in mesmeric-and analogous phenomena ; but&#xD;
I do not at all doubt the ability of matter to effect it all.&#xD;
Yes, my friend, I believe that matter alone, without extrinsic&#xD;
aid, is competent to the production of the magnetic wonders,&#xD;
and a hundred others still more marvellous. For instance, I&#xD;
do not believe that any merely mesmeric power whatever,&#xD;
much less the dream-force of ordinary sleep, can, or, under&#xD;
any conceivable circumstances, could enable you to correctly&#xD;
read the inscriptions on the tablets in the Louvre, or probe&#xD;
the secrets of Karnak, Baalbec, Nineveh, or Ampyloe ; but&#xD;
I can name purely material agencies that are more than ade--&#xD;
quate to the accomplishment of these, and infinitely greater&#xD;
things. I know a material means that will enable the soul&#xD;
to lay bare before its gaze the deepest mysteries of the highest&#xD;
antiquity, strip the Past of its mouldy shroud, and trium-&#xD;
phantly lift the veil that conceals the Future from our view&#xD;
-or rather, your view.'&#xD;
" The strange old man ceased, and, for a little time, my&#xD;
mind lingered on his concluding words. It was .plain and&#xD;
clear, so I thought, that he alluded to certain medicaments&#xD;
which have long been used for the production of a species of&#xD;
ecstatic dream, and so I replied-&#xD;

"'You are doubtless correct, and can, by physical agents,&#xD;
produce strange.psychical phenomena, and curious exhibitions&#xD;
of mental activity and fantasy ; but, beyond all question,&#xD;
you over-rate their importance and power, for not one of them,&#xD;
is adequate -to the office of enabling a clear, strong mind to&#xD;
move within the sphere of the Hidden, but the Real,'&#xD;
"' To what do you allude particularly, mon ari ?'&#xD;
"' I allude to various chemical and botanical compounds ;&#xD;
for instance, those plants which furnish a large per centage&#xD;
of the chemical principles Narcotine, Morphia, and others of&#xD;
the same general characteristics, as Opium, Beng, and Hemp,&#xD;
the preparations of the delightful but dangerous -,, the&#xD;
equally fascinating decoctions of .-===, not forgetting&#xD;
Hasheesh, that accursed drug, beneath whose sway millions&#xD;
in the Orient have sunk into untimely but rainbow-tinted&#xD;
graves, and which, in western lands, has made hundreds of&#xD;
howling maniacs, and transformed scores of strong men into&#xD;
the most loathly, drivelling idiots.'&#xD;
"We lapsed into silence, which at length was broken by&#xD;
Ravalette, who said, as he clasped my hand with fervor-&#xD;
"'My dear young friend, there is here, in Paris, a high&#xD;
and noble society, whose chief I am. This society has many&#xD;
Rosicrucians among its members. Like the society to which&#xD;
you belong, ours, also, has its head-quarters in the Orient,&#xD;
Ever since I have known you, I have been anxious to have&#xD;
you for a brother of our Order. Shall I direct your initia.&#xD;
tion ?  Once with us, there is no branch of knowledge,&#xD;
mystic or otherwise, that you will not be -able to attain, and,&#xD;
&#xD;
compared to which, that of even the third temple of Rosi-&#xD;
crucia is but as the alphabet to an encyclopaedia.'&#xD;
"Much more lie said, but I had no desire to join his fra-&#xD;
ternity, and firmly but respectfully told him  so ; where-&#xD;
upon he cut short our conference by rising, as he did so,&#xD;
observing--&#xD;
"'You may regret it. I can tell you no more. The&#xD;
society exists ; if you need it, find it-it may be discovered.&#xD;
But see ! my groom and horse have arrived, and have long&#xD;
been waiting.  I must, therefore, leave you.  Take this&#xD;
paper ; open it when you see proper to do so. You will quit&#xD;
Paris to-morrow, next day, or when you choose. You may&#xD;
turn your face southward, instead of to the north as you pro-&#xD;
posed. Seek me not till in your hour of greatest need. In&#xD;
the meantime, I counsel you to obey, to the letter, your&#xD;
highest intuitions. Adieu!'&#xD;
" And so we parted. I loved Ravalette, but not his fra-&#xD;
ternity. This conversation with Ravalette, and, indeed, my&#xD;
entire intercourse with him, was invested with a peculiar halo&#xD;
of what I may justly call the weird. It was evident that all&#xD;
his words and allusions contained a deeper meaning than ap-&#xD;
peared upon the surface. His conversation had filled my soul&#xD;
with new and strange ideas and emotions ; and I felt that he&#xD;
had left me at the inner door of a vast edifice, after skillfully&#xD;
conducting me through the vestibule. What worlds of mys-&#xD;
tery and meaning lay just beyond, was a theme of profound&#xD;
and uneasy conjecture. I felt and knew that he was no come&#xD;
mon or ordinary man ; and well and strangely was this proved&#xD;
afterwards.&#xD;

.AVALErT.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I had solaced myself with the hope that, by deferring my&#xD;
contemplated tour through Picardy and La Normandy, I&#xD;
should draw closer the bonds of common sympathy between&#xD;
us, and be made wiser through the abrasion of such an intel-&#xD;
lect as his. How suddenly and how rudely was this hope&#xD;
shattered !.&#xD;
"When he dismissed me so abruptly, after baiting my soul&#xD;
with such a splendid lure, I could but feel both astonished&#xD;
and aggrieved. Thousands would have been too small a price&#xD;
to pay for even one'"day more of his society ; but, alas ! thou-&#xD;
sands could not purchase it. Still, I learned a lesson. There&#xD;
are things in this world more valuable than even boundless&#xD;
material wealth-knowledges, that neither Peru's treasures nor&#xD;
the mines of Ind can buy ; and that Ravalette possessed an&#xD;
abundant store of these priceless riches, there was not a single&#xD;
lingering doubt.&#xD;
" As his last words sounded the death-knell of all my&#xD;
fondly air-built castles, I became apprised of a pact that had&#xD;
heretofore escaped my notice ; and this was, that, for the&#xD;
last ten minutes, a mounted groom, having a led horse in&#xD;
hand, had stood patiently waiting under a large tree at the&#xD;
south-eastern terminus of our promenade. As the old man&#xD;
placed the sealed paper in my hand, this groom advanced aind&#xD;
assisted his master to mount, and, as soon as he was firmly&#xD;
seated in the saddle, they both gave rein and spur, and, urg-&#xD;
ing the steeds into a round gallop, both horsemen were out&#xD;
of sight before °'could recover from the stupor of surprise&#xD;
/ into which the proceeding had thrown me."&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
NOW COMES THE MYSTERY--A MAN GOES IN A CAB IN #*&#xD;
SEARCH OF HIS OWN GHOST.&#xD;
"PERHAPS three minutes elapsed before a full recovery&#xD;
took place, and, at the end of that period, I had come to the&#xD;
conclusion not to be baulked in quite such a cavalier style,&#xD;
but to seek and obtain one more interview, come what might&#xD;
therefrom. With this intention, I dashed along the hill-side,.&#xD;
and at full speed through the principal thoroughfare of Belle-&#xD;
ville, till I reached the barriere leading into the Rue Fau-&#xD;
bourg du Temple, where, calling a cabriolet, I ordered the&#xD;
driver to land me in the Rue Michel le Compte---where, a few&#xD;
hours previously, I had dined with Ravalette-in the shortest&#xD;
possible space of time.&#xD;
" A curious thing took place while giving my orders to the&#xD;
driver. It was this : Everybody knows that, at any of the&#xD;
barrieres leading from Paris, a large crowd of blouses, men&#xD;
and of office, women and children of the lower orders, may,&#xD;
,im fair or foul weather, always be found-.-loiterers, having&#xD;
nothing to do, apparently, except to lounge about, to see and&#xD;
be seen. Such a crowd I found at the barriere, and amidst&#xD;
it I noticed a bonnie, or nurse, having in charge three beauti-&#xD;
ful children, one of whom, a lad of seven years, appeared to&#xD;

&#xD;
take an unusual interest in myself, doubtless observing that I&#xD;
was in a great hurry to accomplish something. This child,&#xD;
as it saw me, ran to the nurse, and said, 'JIMa bonnet, Fran-&#xD;
chette, what's the matter with the gentleman ?  Is he sick ?&#xD;
What makes'him look so queer ?'&#xD;
"'Hush, child,' said the woman in reply ; 'that gentle-&#xD;
man is in search of what he won't find this long time!1'&#xD;
"'What is that, Franchette ?'&#xD;
" 'That gentleman is in search of his own ghost, mes en-&#xD;
fants!' replied the nurse, as the children clustered around&#xD;
her to hear the answer.&#xD;
"'JMa foi!' echoed the crowd.of idlers, as they caught the&#xD;
woman's words-whether'spoken in jest or seriously I cannot&#xD;
say-' M1a foi ! the gentleman takes a cab to go in search of&#xD;
his own ghost!1' And the cab drove off as these words were&#xD;
echoed by a hundred tongues.&#xD;
" 'What the devil does it meani?' asked I of myself, rather&#xD;
irreverently, as a Guebre would say, had one heard me. 'What&#xD;
does it mean?' -What put such a queer notion as that in the&#xD;
woman's head ?' And, while cogitating for an answer, the&#xD;
cab stopped before the required gateway. Hastily dismount-&#xD;
ing,   aid the, man half a gold louis, refused the offered&#xD;
chang , but, dismissing him with a word of praise at his&#xD;
alacrity,  hastily rang the bell to summon the concierge or&#xD;
porter.. That personage speedily made his appearance, all&#xD;
the quicker from the unwonted vigor applied to the bell-rope,&#xD;
"'Is your master in the house, mon ami ?'&#xD;
"' 0ui, monsieur: he has not been absent to-day.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"'WhatI' Not been absent, when he left me not thirty&#xD;
minutes ago? Impossible ! Monsieur Ravalette must have&#xD;
been absent.'&#xD;
"'But who is Monsieur Ravalette ? I know of no such&#xD;
person. Monsieur Jacques d'Einprat is my master, and not&#xD;
the person you have mentioned!I'&#xD;
" Here was a fresh mystery. 'Call Monsieur Jacques&#xD;
d'Emprat, if you please.'&#xD;
" 'G ertainement, monsieur. Jeanette, ny dear, go up-&#xD;
stairs and tell the patron here's a gentleman wants to see&#xD;
him.'&#xD;
" Jeanette, a little girl of twelve years, flew to execute&#xD;
the errand, and in a few moments the landlord himself apd&#xD;
peared ; and I was surprised to find that the well-aproned&#xD;
butler who had attended upon us at dinner and the proprie-&#xD;
tor of the house were one and the same person. An expla-&#xD;
nation soon followed, and I learned that Ravalette, who was&#xD;
an entire stranger to the landlord, had come there two days&#xD;
previously for the purpose of engaging a sumptuous dinner&#xD;
for two persons, that being the landlord's business-a caterer.&#xD;
For the dinner he had paid a round price in advance, and&#xD;
had given the proprietor a small silver coin of peculiar work-&#xD;
manship as a memorial of his visit. This coin or medal the&#xD;
man produced, and, -lo I it was a  perfect fac-simile, on a&#xD;
larger scale, of the jewel I had that very day examined in&#xD;

when he last saw my mysterious friend, the patron answered :&#xD;
'I do not know him, where he is, when I next shall see him&#xD;

-nothing whatever. He left with you, and has not&#xD;
since returned.' He is   evidently a  mysterious man ;&#xD;
and were it not that I have this little medal to com-n&#xD;
memorate his visit, together with three hundred and ten&#xD;
francs in gold in my pocket, Which he paid me for the wines&#xD;
and dinner, I should more than half believe that he was the&#xD;
Devil himself out for a lark in Paris. But the Devil never&#xD;
pays in gold, so those say who ought to know, and I am&#xD;
sure Ravalette paid me in bran new coin, which, on account&#xD;
of its beauty and full weight, I just tied up in one end of my&#xD;
long leather purse, meaning to give it to my daughter, at&#xD;
school in Dijon, for a birth-day gift. Here's the money, as&#xD;
you perceive, nicely tied up, and sealed with wax, just as I&#xD;
fixed it an hour or two after Ravalette paid me.&#xD;
" With these words the honest landlord dcrew forth A&#xD;
most formidable-looking bourse, one end of which was, as he&#xD;
said,-- securely tied with twine, and sealed with a great blotch&#xD;
of red wax.&#xD;
"'Yes, monsieur, here's the cash ; I cannot show it to&#xD;
you, because I don't like to break the string or wax ; but as&#xD;
a sound is worth as much as a sight, you shall hear it jingle&#xD;
to your heart's content.'&#xD;
"And so saying, he struck the purse against the side of&#xD;
the gateway ; but, instead of the merry clink of gold coin,&#xD;
we heard only the dull sound of a far less valuable metal.&#xD;
This startled him not a little. He changed color, then drew&#xD;
his knife, and in an instant cut the string, and emptied the&#xD;
contents of the purse upon his open palm.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Horrible I Instead of bright golden Louis, he held in&#xD;
his hand a small pile of leaden disks ?  Each one of these&#xD;
disks had a number and a letter on it, and one of them was&#xD;
engraved, on the obverse side, with the simple words-' Place&#xD;
the coins in order.' We did so, and found that each letter&#xD;
formed part of- a word. When they were all placed, the in-&#xD;
scription read, 'All is not gold that glitters!'&#xD;
" My soul quailed before the mystery. I could scarcely&#xD;
move or speak, so great was my bewilderment ; and as for&#xD;
the patron, it is impossible to describe his terror and con-&#xD;
sternation, as he stood there, with open mouth and protrud-&#xD;
ing eyeballs, gazing on the coins upon the board where he&#xD;
had laid them. I too looked upon them ; and even while we&#xD;
did so, a terrible thing took place ; for the letters upon the&#xD;
disks changed color before our very eyes, first to a light blue,&#xD;
changing to deep crimson, and finally assuming a blood-red&#xD;
color. When, at the end of thirty seconds, this color did not&#xD;
change, we looked closer at them, and, to our absolute amaze-&#xD;
ment, found that the characters themselves had altered, and&#xD;
instead of the sentence above quoted, we read the following :&#xD;
"' Remember Ravalette ! Fear not I'&#xD;
" With a cry of agony the man dashed the- accursed coins&#xD;
to the ground, and instantly fell himself in a deathly swoon.&#xD;
A. great excitement now ensued. The porter, Jeanette, and&#xD;
half a dozen other inmates, rushed to the assistance of their&#xD;
fallen master.&#xD;
"Tenderly and carefully we bore him into the house, and&#xD;
speedily resorted to-those well-known means of restoration used&#xD;

in such cases, which it were superfluous to mention ; suffice it&#xD;
that, at the expiration of half an hour, the mai revived, and&#xD;
bidding him and the rest a short good-bye, and promising to&#xD;
return on the morrow if I did not quit Paris, I took my de-&#xD;
parture.&#xD;
" Before I ieft, however1, it occurred to me that I would&#xD;
secure the marvellous coins, or, at least, a few of them ; and&#xD;
for this purpose I, accompanied by the concierge, who had&#xD;
seen his master dash them away, went into the court-yard&#xD;
where he had thrown them. Carefully and long we searched&#xD;
over the smooth -stone pavements. The marks where they&#xD;
had struck were there, but not a single coin could be found.&#xD;
It was absolutely certain that no person in the house had&#xD;
picked them up, for all these were'n attendance on the pat-&#xD;
ron. It was equally certain that no one from the street had&#xD;
done so ; for the gate was fast bolted and shut, and had been&#xD;
ever since I had entered the premises to inquire of the porter.&#xD;
" At length we gave up the task of finding them as utterly&#xD;
hopeless. I looked at the porter and shook my head; the&#xD;
porter looked at me and shook his head in return, as much&#xD;
as to say, 'It is a very strange affair!i' At that moment a&#xD;
voice, coming from. God knows where, for it seemed to issue&#xD;
neither from above nor below, in the house or out of it-a hol-&#xD;
low, half-pathetic, half-cynical voice, echoed our unspoken&#xD;
thought-'It is a vERY strange affair!' The horror-stricken&#xD;
porter crossed himself devoutly, and, falling on his knees, be-&#xD;
gan to pray, while I in the meanwhile undid the bolts, opened&#xD;
the port, and rushed into the open street.&#xD;
&#xD;
",The thing was altogether of so weird a character.&#xD;
that I almost doubted the evidence of my senses ; yet,&#xD;
on recalling all the circumstances from first to last, the&#xD;
testimony affirming the events was altogether too strong,&#xD;
overpowering and direct, to be doubted for an instant.&#xD;
" In books of ancient lore ; in the old Black letter vo-&#xD;
lmes of antiquity ; in the recital of the exploits of Appolo-&#xD;
nius of TYAN4E; in the Life of Darwin ; in the story of Gru-&#xD;
gantus, and in the 'Records of the Weird Brethren of Ap-&#xD;
pulia,' I had read of Magic Marvels, almost too wonderful&#xD;
for the belief of those ignorant masses contemporaneous with&#xD;
the authors and heroes of the various legends. But in the&#xD;
light of modern learning, all these things had been resolved&#xD;
into three primitive elements, and these were :1st., and&#xD;
principal. Ignorance of the Masses. 2d. The clouds of super-&#xD;
stition which for long ages hovered over the world. And, 3d.&#xD;
The amazing skill possessed by the various arch-impostors of&#xD;
antiquity. Thus I accounted for much that was reported to&#xD;
have taken place in 'ye Olden Tyme;' but how to explain&#xD;
away what myself and several others had just witnessed, on the&#xD;
same easy and general hypothesis, was a task altogether be-&#xD;
yond achievement. To attempt to get rid of the difficulty on&#xD;
the supposition of mere 'Fancy,' was simply ridiculous : and&#xD;
yet, while one does not feel at liberty to admit the idea of&#xD;
Magic, here were circumstances of such a tremendous cha-&#xD;
racter, as to utterly forbid and defy explication upon any&#xD;
other ground whatever.&#xD;

RAVALETTE'&#xD;
&#xD;
of Michel le Compte, and turned up that of the T   apk&#xD;
As I slowly walked along, buried in a labyrinth of conjec&#xD;
;ure, the idea suddenly occurred to me that perhaps, aftei&#xD;
all, Ravalette and the people of the house in the Rue Michel&#xD;
le Compte, might merely have been performing parts in a.&#xD;
very cleverly designed, and capitally acted drama ; though&#xD;
how to account for the kaleidoscopic changes of the coins, I&#xD;
could not at first imagine. 'Ah 1' said I, at length, 'I have&#xD;
it ! Hurrah !   Bravo !   Eureka, ten times over ! The&#xD;
secret's out, and I'm the man that found it!1' A sudden.,&#xD;
thought occurred to me, by the aid of which, even the coin&#xD;
mystery, was cleared up most satisfactorily ; and that which&#xD;
ten minutes before was a profound and horrible mystery,&#xD;
was now, apparently, as clear as the noontide sun. Here is&#xD;
the train of reasoning which led me to this hopeful result: Ra-&#xD;
valette was a wealthy and eccentric gentleman, who, observ-&#xD;
ing my natural enthusiasm for the antique, and aptitude to&#xD;
the occult, had determined to either amuse himself and friends&#xD;
at my -expense, possibly for the purpose of curing some of&#xD;
them of what, perhaps, he regarded as the same weakness&#xD;
or, taking pity on what he looked upon as a sad and danger-&#xD;
ous infatuation, had resorted to this rather costly experi-&#xD;
ment, in the hope that at its termination a perfect cure&#xD;
might be effected. The people in the house were, together&#xD;
with the woman and children at the Barriere, his confederates&#xD;
in the scheme. He was a learned inan ; saw that I could&#xD;
not be easily taken in ; and therefore brought the wonders&#xD;
of chemical and ventriloquial sciences to his assistance-the&#xD;

latter in the affair of the floating voice, the former in the&#xD;
matter of the coils or disks, .These coins had been coated&#xD;
with a substance that would, on exposure to the atmosphere,&#xD;
exhale away ;- and with this exhalation the first set of cha-&#xD;
racters would of course disappear. Beneath this external&#xD;
coating was another, which, on contact with the air, would&#xD;
assume a peculiar color ; beneath this, in turn, was another,&#xD;
and-,still another ; the last of all, being that on which was&#xD;
written the last series of letters composing a sentence. The&#xD;
appearance of these words was the cue to the patron to utter&#xD;
his cry, dash the coiiis from his hands, and pretend to swoon,&#xD;
In the commotion resultant therefrom, attention would be&#xD;
drawn from the cause of the apparent disaster, and afford&#xD;
ample opportunity for their removal, The sentence, 'It is a&#xD;
very strange afair,' would be the very one naturally sug-&#xD;
gested under the circumstances, and had happily been-selected&#xD;
as the most fitting one to afford exercise to the ventriloquist&#xD;
employed ; and this apparent echoing of an unspoken thought&#xD;
.would add additional piquancy to the scene, and materially&#xD;
assist in piling up the horripilant.'&#xD;
" There ! was not that a fine specimen of analysis-? it&#xD;
was almost perfect, and would have answered most admira-&#xD;
bly had it not been for one little thing, and that was, simply,&#xD;
that it was not true-a trifling objection, perhaps, yet one&#xD;
absolutely fatal. Why, will be seen hereafter.&#xD;

took the helm. Be it true or false, I determined to go back&#xD;
to Belleville and pursue my investigations a little further. A&#xD;
passing omnib         rought me to the Barriere, and to&#xD;
my great joy   saw the identical party that had made the&#xD;
curious remark about my being in search of my own ghost.&#xD;
The nurse and children were intently watching the evolutions&#xD;
of a set of nomadic marionettes, and listening to the stereo-&#xD;
type drolleries of the man in the box who worked the little&#xD;
puppets. Luckily the whole party, with at least three hun-&#xD;
dred others,'were so taken up with the antics of Polichinel&#xD;
and his shrew of a wife, that the young ones nor the nurse&#xD;
saw me. I therefore stepped into a coffee-shop close at hand,&#xD;
called for a tasse, and then sent one of the waiters to fetch&#xD;
the woman with tile three children dressed in yellow velvet-&#xD;
een.   The man obeyed, and speedily returned, followed by&#xD;
the party sent for.&#xD;
"Upon seeing who it was that had summoned her, the&#xD;
young woman felt alarmed, fearing that the remarks she had&#xD;
made, when I entered the cab an hour or so previously, had&#xD;
offended me, and that my present business was to cause her&#xD;
to be punished for her insolence. For of all places on this&#xD;
civilized earth, Paris is the one where a stranger is best&#xD;
protected from injury or impertinence-at least, it then was.&#xD;
I soon set the woman's mind at ease on that point ; and hav-&#xD;
ing purchased some g&amp;amp;teaux for the children, and the same,&#xD;
with a vessel of coffee, for the nurse, I requested her to be&#xD;
seated, and tell me what caused her to use such curious terms,&#xD;
with regard to myself, a little while before.&#xD;

"' Lord bless you, sir,' she said, 'I did but repeat what&#xD;
an old man said who stood on the side of the carriage oppo-&#xD;
site to that by which you entered. I had just crossed over&#xD;
from his side when you saw and heard me. As you came&#xD;
running down the street, everybody saw you, and that you&#xD;
were in a hurry, and several persons made observations as to&#xD;
the cause of your great haste. Said one, "The man's mad 1"&#xD;
said another, "His woman has just run off with a lover, tak-&#xD;
ing his twins along for company's sake, and he's after them&#xD;
with a sharp stick '" .Said the old man at my side, "He's in&#xD;
search of what he won't. find very soon." " What's that,&#xD;
sir ?" I ventured to ask., " He's in search of-ahem !--in&#xD;
search of-his own ghost, my dear !" said the old man, as he&#xD;
darted up the street. The notion was so funny, that I re--&#xD;
membered it all the while I was crossing the street-a very&#xD;
long time for us Bonnes to recollect anything, mon c/icr ami;&#xD;

looked wise, and repeated the grey-beard's observation, and&#xD;

went on to describe---Ravalette ! as well as I could have done&#xD;
myself, had that mysterious individual stood before me then&#xD;

bered, Ravalette and myself had visited together. I went&#xD;
to the first one, and asked the gardener if he had seen the&#xD;
old man who had bee .my companion on a recent visit, an&#xD;
hour or two before:?&#xD;
"'Old man.?   Well, you are a funny man, to call a boy&#xD;
of seventeen years an old man:  I recollect you well enough,&#xD;
for you bought.a fine bouquet, one of the damask roses com-&#xD;
posing which you now carry in your button-hole. I remem-&#xD;
ber you well enough, apd the beardless stripling, your com-&#xD;
panion ; but I have nbt seen him since you both left to-&#xD;
gether.'&#xD;
"'Bah, my friend I' said I, 'it won't do. I know per-&#xD;
fectly well that my comrade here was not a youngster, but a&#xD;
man of full seventy years of age, if a single day !''&#xD;
"' Sacri bleu ! You'd better tell me I lie at. once, and be&#xD;
done with it ! You may say it was an old man, but I'l be&#xD;
cursed if it wasn't a young one, not yet out of his teens ; and&#xD;
.what's more to the purpose, I'll back my opinion, and bet you&#xD;
an even bottle of Jean Laftte, forty-two years old, that the&#xD;
person who accompanied you here this day was a small, thin,&#xD;
sallow-faced youth of not over fifteen years ! Will you take&#xD;
the wager ?'&#xD;
"'Yes, and forty more just like it ; but who shall be our&#xD;
umpire, and decide the bet ?'               ..&#xD;
"'pWhy, let the witnesses, my men, and my wife or dauigh-&#xD;
ter, decide. I'll warrant they won't-1ie for the sake of a&#xD;
bottle of wine. Are you agreed?'&#xD;
" 'Yes, call them on ; I'14 trust them.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Of curse you may, for they are honest folks. JMy wife&#xD;
let you both in at the door ; I sold you a bouquet; one of&#xD;
my men went round the garden with you, and the other ran&#xD;
to fetch change for the five-franc piece'you gave me to take&#xD;
pay from. Here, wife, Joseph, and Pierre; come here all&#xD;
of you. I've made a bet with the gentleman, and want you&#xD;
three to decide it.'&#xD;
"In a moment the persons called stood before us, and the&#xD;
gardener said to me : 'Now, monsieur, you and I will go to&#xD;
the other end of the garden ; when there, I will describe to you&#xD;
the person who accompanied you here this afternoon. Then&#xD;
we will call the witnesses, one at a time, first separating them,&#xD;
so that they cannot. agree upon a uniform story for or against&#xD;
me, but give the truth exactly, as the truth appears to each&#xD;
one.'&#xD;
" Nothing could be fairer than this proposition, and there-&#xD;
fore I gave my asse.nt. to it immediately; whereupon the two&#xD;
men were sent to stand at opposite ends of the garden, his&#xD;
wife took her place in a third, while her husband and myself&#xD;
went ,to the fourth. Having arrived there:&#xD;
"'Your friend,' said the gardener, 'was just as I have de-&#xD;
scribed him, with this addition, that he wore polish-leather&#xD;
shoes, a Leghorn or Panama hat, carried a switch cane, wore&#xD;
light jean pantaloons, a coat au saque, and vest of white&#xD;
Cashmere. Remember this. Now, Joseph, come here,' said&#xD;
he, raising his voice and motioning the man toward us. ' Be&#xD;

feet, tremendous hands, broad, flat face, a nose that would&#xD;
weigh a pound, and lips twice as heavy. His hair was&#xD;

" It is difficult to say which of us two looked most aston-&#xD;

flatter a French woman, and madame was French all the&#xD;
way through ; consequently she determined, on so fitting an&#xD;
occasion, to prove her husband's encomiums perfectly well&#xD;
founded ; and she began the display with a quotation from&#xD;
the Bard of Avon's Midsummer Night's Dream.&#xD;
"'Ah, mon ange avec les bottes-my angel in boots-do you&#xD;
not know that Joseph has been a poet ever since I instructed&#xD;
him in trochees, dactyls, spondees, dythyrambics, hexameters,&#xD;

"Here I stepped in and told the gardener that his lady&#xD;
did not mean cats or females, but simply feet, measures, and&#xD;
seansions of poetry. This mollified him, and the lady cour.&#xD;
tesied to me, and resumed :&#xD;
"'Yes, darling--ogre'-this last was spoken sub voce--&#xD;
'yes, dearest, the gentleman's right. Joseph is a poet ; Pierre&#xD;
is a lunatic ; and the gentleman himself is beyond all question&#xD;
as deeply in love as he can get ; and these are the reasons&#xD;
why neither describes the person who attended with him&#xD;

you and your Shake-the-spear loving once. I'd fix him and&#xD;
you too, my lady, that I would ! I'd fix his flint so that he&#xD;
wouldn't shake any more spears around my garden, that I&#xD;
would ! Will you have done with all your rigmarole, and&#xD;
tell what you know ?'&#xD;
"' Certainly. The gentleman's sweetheart, who came&#xD;
with him to-day, and who went with me into my private, room&#xD;
to arrange her hair and adjust her petticoats, was as fine and&#xD;
pretty a young blonde of eighteen years as ever sat a man's&#xD;
heart beating triple bobmajors against his ribs. Such ankles,&#xD;
such feet, such a bloom upon her cheeks and lips !-ah ! and&#xD;
such a tournure ! such hips, such embonpoint ! Sacristie !&#xD;

monsieur to mourn his loss, while I revelled in the essence of&#xD;
love with his fiance. Besides that'--&#xD;
"'Stop, stop, Ninette-for God's sake stop ! I have lost&#xD;
a bottle of Jean Lafitte, forty odd years old, and lost my&#xD;
brains besides!l'&#xD;
" Here the whole five of us collected in a group, and an&#xD;
explanation followed which instantly banished all mirth from&#xD;
Pierre, and all poetry from la fardiniere.&#xD;
" Declining all thoughts of the wager and the wine, I left&#xD;
the party in a maze of stupor, and sped as hastily as I could&#xD;
to the Guinguette, or Tea-Garden, where, it will be remem-&#xD;
bered, Ravalette and myself had entered to converse with&#xD;
the' proprietor regarding his novel and costly experiment in&#xD;
the way.of.feasting poor people a la les rickeuse.&#xD;
"Entering this place, I put the same question to the pro-&#xD;
prietor that I had to the gardiner and the man of Michel ale&#xD;
Compte.; but instead of .surprise at his answer, :I was&#xD;
absolutely dumb-founded, for the man insisted that I en-&#xD;
tered the shop quite alone, but that I had conversed with&#xD;
,him in two separate and perfectly distinct voices, au ventril-&#xD;
oque-which he had regarded as very singular, but concluded&#xD;
that ,I was astudent of ventriloquism, and took every oppor-&#xD;
tunity to test my proficiency, and had now come back to&#xD;
ascertain what success attended -the experiment.&#xD;
" I was too much horrified to -speak-; but, simply nodding&#xD;
my adieux, took my. departure in a mood much easier to be&#xD;
imagined than described.&#xD;
"Not yet content. I made inquiries :as to whether any&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
one had seen two horsemen of a peculiar description pass&#xD;
through any of the streets of Belleville.&#xD;
"Nobody had seen any such, or indeed any horsemen&#xD;
whatever. I was thunderstruck.&#xD;
"' I'll track them 1' I cried, as a last resource; 'for the&#xD;
place where we walked, where the horse and groom stood&#xD;
waiting, and where the old man mounted, was a soft, yield-&#xD;
ing, grassless turf. This will decide whether I have been&#xD;
dealing with the living or the dead, and that too in this&#xD;
broad daylight.'-&#xD;
" I ran thither. Not a trace of a horse's hoofs ; not a&#xD;
single vestige of Ravalette's footprints save one, and that one&#xD;
the fac-simile of the description formerly given. My own&#xD;
foot-marks were plain enough, but only the one other was to&#xD;
be :found ! Here the mystery grew thicker and thicker, nor&#xD;
could I see the first glimmer of a way to clear it up.&#xD;
" Slowly and despondently, I retraced my steps toward&#xD;
Paris, taking care to inquire as I went, whether any person&#xD;
had seen two men on horseback go toward Charronne, Vil-&#xD;
lette, Menilmontant, or through the Barrieres. I might&#xD;
just as well not have asked.&#xD;
" But the chapter of devilry was not yet concluded, for&#xD;
what subsequently took place actually threw all that had&#xD;
gone before it entirely in the shade. These things I will now&#xD;
relate, first premising my narrative.&#xD;
" One day, about a week before I first spoke to Ravalette&#xD;
in- the Louvre, I happened to be spending an afternoon in&#xD;
the Palais Royale, along with my friends the Barons di Cor-&#xD;

from America. On the day alluded to, I met at D-    's&#xD;
room in the Rue Beaujolais, and then and there became ac-&#xD;
quainted -with, an English gentleman of easy means and&#xD;
polished mind, by the name of Carr. This gentleman resided&#xD;
with his family in a splendid mansion in the Rue du Chemin&#xD;
Vert. After a long and interesting conversation, we parted,&#xD;
but not till Mr. Carr had cordially taken me by the hand,&#xD;
expressed a desire to maintain the acquaintance, and invited&#xD;
me to call on him at his residence in the Rue du Chemin&#xD;
Vert. I felt gratified at his frankness, and accepted his&#xD;
polite invitation. Mr. Carr named the day, and I agreed to&#xD;
go ; and accordingly had spent the evening and took tea wilh&#xD;
him,. his family and a few select guests, some five or six days&#xD;
before the eventful day, the achievement of which I have just&#xD;
recounted. The thing which I am aboat-to narrate is not&#xD;
only strange, but in many respects horrible, and my mind is&#xD;
agitated to the last degree by the astounding occurrences--.&#xD;
things which I beheld with my own eyes, felt with my own&#xD;
senses, realized with my own spirit ; and yet I scarcely dare&#xD;
give credit to that which I am sensible cannot, could not have&#xD;
been an illusion. My soul is filled with wonder; and I&#xD;
hasten to give a true version of the affair while all is yet&#xD;
fresh and vivid before me ; indeed, it will ever be so, till&#xD;
age shall umb my faculties."&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
MURDER WILL OUT.&#xD;
" THE circumstances were, briefly, these :&#xD;
" I attended, as before observed, the f~te seiale, at tho&#xD;
house of my friend Mr. Carr-Leonard Carr. The party&#xD;
was given in honor of a young literary friend of the family,&#xD;
who had recently gained great renownas a writer of fiction.&#xD;
To this young man I was introduced just before we all sat&#xD;
down to the festive board to partake of the many good&#xD;
things so bounteously set before us.&#xD;
" After the repast was concluded we all adjourned to the&#xD;
parlor and entered into conversation. Topic after topic had&#xD;
been discussed, and at length the 'Turning tables,' then so&#xD;
rife in all parts of .the world, and Paris especially, became&#xD;
the theme of observation and criticism.&#xD;
"'Bah!' said Mrs. Carr, 'I deem the whole thing silly,&#xD;
besides being one of the most contemptible humbugs ever ran&#xD;
after by a pack of silly people-I was going to say-fools : I&#xD;
am convinced there is really nothing in it, and that all this&#xD;
stuff about moving furniture, and ghosts, and other spectral&#xD;
gentry, is but the product of heated fancy, if not of heads and&#xD;
hearts devoid of truth, principle, and moral rectitude ; stories&#xD;
got up for swindling purposes, and to gull that credulous&#xD;

pack of ninnies known as " The Public,"-and a precious set&#xD;
they are, to be sure ! Who believes, for instance, a tithe&#xD;
of the reputed wonders of the famous American "Miracle&#xD;
Circle," or that they are anything more than clever tricks&#xD;
played off by a set of waggish fellows on a gullible commu-&#xD;
nity of Yankees, having in view the ultimate object of expos-&#xD;
ing and exploding the whole so-called spiritual mysteries ? I&#xD;
don't, I'm sure.'&#xD;
- Poor ,lady'! She little dreamed under what cruel cir-&#xD;
cumstances she was doomed so soon to.verify the truth of the&#xD;
Latin motto,&#xD;
"Nemo mortalium, omnibus horis sapit,'&#xD;
so meaningly quotedto myself by Ravalette. Little did she&#xD;
then dream, in the plenitude of intellect, that not many days&#xD;
would elapse ere she admitted all she now so mockingly and&#xD;
scornfully derided and laughed at, and that ere long she would&#xD;
cower in the very extremity of terror and mental dread,&#xD;
before these very mysteries she now so dogmatically denied.&#xD;
" Her husband took upon himself the task of answering&#xD;
her, thus relieving us guests of the always unpleasant office&#xD;
of holding a -wordy contest with a woman. He said:&#xD;
"'You are, my dear, permit me to say, in behalf of my-&#xD;
self and these gentlemen, a little too hasty in your .conclu-&#xD;
sions, too- sweeping in your remarks, and in the characteriza-&#xD;
tion of the wonderful phenomena of these latter days. I&#xD;
know, my love, that' you will give me credit for rather more&#xD;
than the -usual share of suspicion, scepticism, and doubt,&#xD;
regarding -certain marvellous- things said to have recently&#xD;

&#xD;
'7.;9&#xD;
&#xD;
taken place in England, America, and even here in Paris.&#xD;
You know that it is my nature to admit nothing as proved-&#xD;
especially of such an implied nature-without absolute demon-&#xD;
strative evidence. The proof must be irrefragible--the tes-&#xD;
timony unbroken and indubitable, else .I accept nothing.  I&#xD;
certainly do not believe in spirits, much less that such things&#xD;
come to this world and flit and move around us, taking in-&#xD;
terest in all our affairs, and meddling with pur business in a&#xD;
thousand ways, as it is alleged they do by those who be-&#xD;
lieve in them. And yet, with all, this, :I confess, that I have&#xD;
seen things that stagger me-indeed, that demonstrate be-&#xD;
yond dispute the existence of a, power, mighty, secret, occult,&#xD;
and working out its marvellous designs without the, slightest&#xD;
human aid or influence whatever. Mind me, I do not .attri-&#xD;
bute any or all of these results to spiritual agency, but I do say&#xD;
that, the force at bottom is marvellously intelligent, and for all&#xD;
the world like that of man's. for instance, you will remem-&#xD;
her F   -, who came from America to astonish the:French.&#xD;
Well,.actuated by curiosity, I resolved to form one of a cir-&#xD;
cle of, six,.who had made arrangements to test his powers at&#xD;
his own roomns. Accordingly we met him by appointment&#xD;
at the Cafe Jouony near the Palaise Royal, and together&#xD;
we, seven started for his:,hotel. Now,.as I walked.along, the&#xD;
idea suggested itself, that perhaps the fellow  had made&#xD;
arrangements in his rooms to surprise us by a resort to some&#xD;
mountebankish performance, and therefore, in order. to try&#xD;
his sincerity, and at the same time guard against any mere&#xD;
trickery or legerdemain, , I. suggested that we repair to-&#xD;

apartments elsewhere than at his hotel. To my surprise he&#xD;
assented to this arrangement without a murmur, and we&#xD;
repaired to a room at the house of one of the company, Mon-&#xD;
sieur Benjamin, in the Rue de Olichy. When there, we all&#xD;
sat around a- small table with our fourteen hands laid flat&#xD;
upon its top. For a while nothing occurred, save a few&#xD;
knocks or thumps upon the table, which F  attributed to&#xD;
spirits, but which I suspected his knees produced. While&#xD;
thus we. sat (it was broad daylight, and the sun shone&#xD;
brightly through  the windows), we distinctly saw, and&#xD;
I actually, palpably felt of, a fifteenth hand. This hand was&#xD;
apparently solid flesh and blood. It appeared to be that&#xD;
of a mulatto girl of fifteen or sixteen summers, and one of" the&#xD;
party subsequently told me in confidence that it was the very&#xD;
fac-simile of the right hand of a.girl whom he once know in&#xD;
the Isle de Bourbon, and who had destroyed herse " by&#xD;
poison for love of the very man who told me the story t This&#xD;
hand came from beneath the table and extended itself eight&#xD;
or ten inches over the edge at first. Then it gradually rose&#xD;
in the air, displaying a magnificent set of fingers, apon the&#xD;
middle joint of one of which appeared the sembl-nco of a&#xD;
large and peculiarly-shaped brown mole, surrounded by three&#xD;
smaller ones, and it was by these marks that my friend pre-&#xD;
tended to recognize it. The hand was attached to about two-&#xD;
fifths of a fore-arm, completely covered with the semblance of&#xD;
a lace sleeve, terminating at the wrist in a jewelled band, and&#xD;
at the other extremity by a flaring and projecting ruffle. The&#xD;
hand, after a while, rose into the air, *here it floated fo&#xD;

two minutes. It then descended, seized hold of a small&#xD;
silver bell upon the mantel and rung it sharply all over&#xD;
the room ; after which it replaced it, took hold'of a pencil&#xD;
and wrote forty-seven words upon the ceiling of the lofty-&#xD;
vaulted apartment ; threw down the pencil, patted each of&#xD;
our hands, and then gradually faded away in the air, just&#xD;
over the centre of the table. We rose after it had gone,&#xD;
placed a stand upon the table, a chair upon that, so as to&#xD;
reach the writing on the wall (which yet remained there),&#xD;
and found a short message to the company in general, and&#xD;
signed by the very name of Mr.      's inamorata of the&#xD;
Isle de Bowrbon !   Now, my dear, was all this hum-&#xD;
bug ?"&#xD;
"To this, the lady, whose scepticism would not abate one&#xD;
jot, even in the face of such an-to all but a Rosicrucian-&#xD;
overwhelming demonstration as this, replied :&#xD;
"'Why, I presume you had all taken a little too much&#xD;
wine, fell asleep, got up, wrote on the wall, and-Bah ! It's&#xD;
all humbug ! and that settles the question at once 1'&#xD;
" The lady was silent, and the literary lion--I will call&#xD;
him Mr. A-, for whom the party was gotten up, entered&#xD;
the arena of conversation, and observed that : 'Spectral&#xD;
or Spiritual science-he preferred the former term-was yet&#xD;
but in its infancy in Christendom, provided what a casual&#xD;
acquaintance of his, a man of extraordinary research in all&#xD;
things occult, and whom he had met under peculiar circum-&#xD;

" 'This individual,' pursued Mr. A-, 'is. a firm and&#xD;
devout believer in Spiritualism, and yet contends that not&#xD;
over: two-tenths of what passes current under that term, is&#xD;
really that which it is claimed to be. Nay, further : e&#xD;
declares, and gives his reasons .why, which latter are very&#xD;
just and tenable,;thatnot more than once in fifty times are&#xD;
the actions and speeches delivered under trance the result, of&#xD;
Spiritual action ; but that when not the absolute offspring of&#xD;
imposture, which is rarely the case, other, and very oftenp relf&#xD;
physical. causes are at work, which, are frequently far more&#xD;
potent than what is known as " spiritual influence," inasmuch&#xD;
as the- results are productive of better, greater, and more&#xD;
satisfactory phenomena, and of far more interest and, value to&#xD;
mankind, and which have been entirely overlooked in the&#xD;
haste and zeal:,with which people seek to gratify their thirst&#xD;
for the . marvellqus, by attributing whatever ,baffles their&#xD;
powers of analysis. to-a. supermundane origin.&#xD;
" 'This person,' continued Mr. A., 'asserted also that he&#xD;
could himself produce similar and even far more wonderful&#xD;
and startling effects, by means entirely material, than many&#xD;
which are. claimed to originate beyond the earth. ".This"&#xD;
said: he, " I can do, under circumstances that..will forever put&#xD;
the quietus on one portion of the spiritual theory. There is&#xD;

As .to the means used, that must remain.a secret, for he had&#xD;

before a select ! few, that there really is more betwwe earth&#xD;

SATAN IN PARIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
RAVALETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
versation at Mr. Carr's took place before I had ever seen&#xD;
Ravalette at all to speak with him. And now, if you please,&#xD;
we will continue the train of events in-progress before I made&#xD;
this digression.&#xD;
"You will remember that, after making fruitless inquiries&#xD;
for the two horsemen, and an equally fruitless search after&#xD;
foot-prints on the soil near Belleville, that I took my way to-&#xD;
ward Paris, slowly, on foot, musing deeply as I went along.&#xD;
As I passed down the Rue Faubourg du Temple, the tolling&#xD;
of a distant clock announced the hour of four. I remembered&#xD;
gny engagement at the Baron's, but, as I had fully two hours&#xD;
left in which to dress for the occasion, I determined to drop&#xD;
in at D'Embrat's, in the Rue Michel le Compte, as I went&#xD;
by, and hear whatever might have turned up in my absence.&#xD;
" I reached the street, and was greatly surprised to find a&#xD;
large and highly excited crowd of people before the gate,&#xD;
and the more so, as I beheld the surplices of at least a dozen&#xD;
priests of the Order St. Lazare, elbowing their way, and&#xD;
trying to pass both in and out of the house.&#xD;
"With heart palpitating with vague and dread uneasiness, I&#xD;
approached an intelligent-looking man, and, assuming a care-&#xD;
lessness by no means felt, asked him the cause and reason of&#xD;
the gathering.&#xD;
"'Lord bless you, sir!l' he said. 'Do you not know that&#xD;
the devil and five of his imps have just been on a visit to that&#xD;
house, and carried off three or four of the inmates through&#xD;
the roof in a flame of blue fire?  If you don't know it, I&#xD;
assure you it is a fact!I'&#xD;
&#xD;
"I saw in this answer the legitimate effect of superstition,&#xD;
and that the man's cloth belied his intelligence ; I, there-&#xD;
fore, drew out a sheet of paper and a pencil, and began to&#xD;
flourish them in the eyes of the crowd for the purpose of&#xD;
attracting its attention.&#xD;
" My ruse succeeded ; the people set me down as a reporter&#xD;
of the press, and instantly gave way right and left ; so that&#xD;
I had but little difficulty in gaining an entrance to the build-&#xD;
ing.  Once there, I soon learned that the poor D'Emprat&#xD;
had relapsed into the swoon occasioned by his first fright, and&#xD;
had passed thence into the most frightful convulsions, ex-&#xD;
claiming all the while, as the thick foam rolled from his&#xD;
bloodless lips, 'Oh, the devil ! the devil has come for my&#xD;
soul, because I killed Baptiste Lemoine thirty-seven years ago?&#xD;
Mon Dieu ! Mon Dieu ! They will drag me to hell! Ah, God!'&#xD;
" His wife had exerted all her influence and power to stifle&#xD;
these dangerous cries, but without avail. His cries still in-&#xD;
creased in fury, until at last the police had forced an entrance&#xD;
into the house, and were speedily followed by a score of&#xD;
priests, who, hearing that the devil was in Paris, in proper&#xD;
person, were very anxious to try the effect of a little shower-&#xD;
bath of holy water, as well as to get a sight of their arch&#xD;
enemy, whom, doubtless, the vast majority-of them regarded&#xD;
secretly as nothing more than a man-or, rather, devil-of&#xD;
straw.&#xD;
" The news spread like wild-fire that the devil had ap-&#xD;
peared, and to the questions asked by priest and bailiff of the&#xD;
porter, he confirmed the rumor, and told, as best he could,&#xD;

the incidents of the afternoon. His story did not rest here,&#xD;
however, but, taking two of the officers aside, he told them&#xD;
something which caused them to start back in the wild-&#xD;
est horror, and cross themselves most devoutly. The re-&#xD;
sult of the interview was, that the officers cautioned the porter&#xD;
from uttering one word of what he had just told them to any&#xD;
person else. After this, they all again entered the room&#xD;
where D'Emprat was still struggling in all the terrors of&#xD;
delirium, still accusing himself of a long-committed homicide,&#xD;
still calling on God and the priests to save him from the&#xD;
clutches .of -the devil, whom  e averred he saw beside him&#xD;
armed with fork and trident, ready to drag his unfortunate&#xD;
soul to perdition and the damned. During all this fearful&#xD;
scene, Madame D'Emprat was doing all she could to quiet&#xD;
her husband, but without avail. The man went on harder&#xD;
than before. The ghosts of evil deeds were there, and aveng-&#xD;
ing angels lashed his soul to frenzy.&#xD;
"'Be still,' she cried, 'for Jesus' sake, be still ! They will&#xD;
carry you to Bicetre, and from there to le Boreau, and you&#xD;
will die au coupe -tite 1*  Oh, be still.! or, if you must talk,&#xD;
say something else than that !'&#xD;
" Every word uttered by the woman and the man was&#xD;
quietly written down, unobserved, by one of the officers, who&#xD;
used my pencil and paper, and the back of his comrade as a&#xD;
desk.&#xD;
"What strange, mysterious power was it that caused me&#xD;
I     '* On the guillotine.&#xD;

&#xD;
mechanically to purchase a pencil and paper on my way from&#xD;
Belleville down to Michel le Compte ?&#xD;
"God's ways are mysterious, altogether past finding out ;&#xD;
and I inwardly praised him as the mighty fact became ap-&#xD;
parent, that the people of the house were not in league, as I&#xD;
had conjectured might be the case, with Iavalette; and that&#xD;
the mysterious agent of Divine Retribution was not of an in-&#xD;
fernal nature, be it or he whatever else. A. load was lifted&#xD;
off my heart-too soon, alas ! to be let down heavier than&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"'You did not :kill him, D'Emprat !. So.don't say you did&#xD;
any more!1' exclaimed the woman in the accents of despair.&#xD;
" ''Tis a lie ! I did!1' yelled the unfortunate man. -'I&#xD;
-killed him with the hatchet in the cellar, and buried him.under&#xD;
the grey horse's stall in the stable 1'&#xD;
" ' My God.! we :are ruined!1' screamed the now frantic&#xD;
woman. 'I always suspected that you killed my brother,&#xD;
-but never -believed it until now. And, yet, I do not even now&#xD;
,believe it ; for'&#xD;
" 'I can prove it ; for I well remember a ,bloody hatchet,&#xD;
and that master never would let me clean the stable of the&#xD;
grey horse ; and, that I have watched him dig.gold from the&#xD;
ground there, and heard him accuse himself in his sleep !' said&#xD;
the concierge, coming forward.&#xD;
"'Then, D'Emprat, and you, madame, I arrest in the&#xD;
name of the law ; and you, porter, as a witness. Officers,&#xD;

"Five minutes afterwards, the unfortunate people were&#xD;
being led to prison, and I was on the way to my hotel to.&#xD;
dress-even under such circumstances-for the soiree at the&#xD;
Baron's, but in a frame of mind that little fitted me to be a&#xD;
spectator of philosophical experiments. Yet my word was&#xD;
pledged, and go I must, and go I did-six o'clock finding&#xD;
me in the Baron's parlor.&#xD;
"I am   perfectly sensible that, even in what I have&#xD;
narrated, the credulity of many persons would be taxed&#xD;
to the utmost. It is easy enough to believe that such&#xD;
things as I have described occurred long ages ago, in&#xD;
the green and halcyon days of Magic, but it. is difficult to&#xD;
imagine such things as taking place in the broad light of this&#xD;
nineteenth century. Millions, aye hundreds of millions, have&#xD;
believed, do, and, in coming years,. perhaps ages, will believe&#xD;
in the startling records of a magic similar to that I have de-&#xD;
tailed, and which is described so briefly, yet so graphically,&#xD;
in the Book of Exodus ; and yet these people will strenuously&#xD;
insist that the day of such things-of such exhibitions of the&#xD;
Upper Magic-has for ever passed away, totally unmindful&#xD;
of the great fact, that, when the astonishing things there re-&#xD;
corded were accomplished, there must of necessity have been&#xD;
a law-a natural law-in accordance with, and by which,&#xD;
they were done, and that no law of Nature has ever yet&#xD;
been repealed ; consequently, they must exist to-day in as full&#xD;
perfection and power as ever.&#xD;
"What remains of the present affair to be told, may, with&#xD;
what has already been related (and the truth of which may&#xD;
&#xD;
be ascertained most readily by correspondence with the&#xD;
parties named), be implicitly relied on as correct in all essen-&#xD;
tial particulars ; and yet, the occurrences that took place on&#xD;
that eventful night are of a kind so horrible, so utterly mon-&#xD;
strous, that, at times, I almost believe that we all-twelve&#xD;
healthful men, and six women-were laboring under some&#xD;
strong delusion. I should still cling to this belief, with&#xD;
the pertinacity of a miser to his golden god, the bigot to his&#xD;
creed, or the drowning wretch to the narrow plank that pro.&#xD;
mises a renewal of life's tenure, were it not that facts, appal-&#xD;
ling in themselves, forever and utterly precede the possibility&#xD;
that I-that we-were mistaken and deceived. What these&#xD;
facts were, will be most clearly shown in the sequel."&#xD;

SEANCE AT THE BARONS--DIABLERIE EXTRAORDINAIRE.&#xD;
" with'features horribler than Hell e'er traced&#xD;
On its own brood; no Demon of the waste,&#xD;
No church-yard ghoul, caught lingering in the light&#xD;
Of the blest sun, e'er blasted human.sight&#xD;
with lineaments so foul, so fierce as those&#xD;
The Impostor now, in grinning mockery shows."&#xD;
" WHEN I reached the house I found the company above&#xD;
enumerated seated in the parlor, and all most anxiously&#xD;
awaiting the appearance of the individual who was to afford&#xD;
us entertainment, and, if possible, some instruction    also.&#xD;
For awhile it appeared that we were doomed to be disap-&#xD;
pointed. The expected party had promised to attend at&#xD;
thirty minutes to-eight, and it was nearly that°time already,&#xD;
and still there were no signs of his coming ; but, as St.&#xD;
Eustache tolled out the half hour, a ring at the door-bell&#xD;
announced his arrival.&#xD;
"The man was a tall and comely personage, apparently of&#xD;
Irish extraction, and had nothing whatever about him at all&#xD;
remarkable ; indeed, he was a very so-soish sort of individual,&#xD;
who at first refused his name to everybody, because, to quote&#xD;
his own words: 'If I remain incog. I shall not be lionized,&#xD;
which in other terms means " bored," and pestered by per-&#xD;
sons seeking to gratify a morbid and impertinent curiosity--&#xD;

&#xD;
people who look for full-grown -miracles, and expect to find&#xD;
them, instead of studying arts and sciences, and therewith&#xD;
increasing their knowledge and enriching their experience by&#xD;
a more intimate acquaintance with philosophic truths, and&#xD;
the recondite mysteries of mighty Nature.'&#xD;
"The gentleman was very polished and polite, entering&#xD;
freely into conversation, and-- seemed  altogether so well&#xD;
pleased with his audience that he threw off all reserve,&#xD;
laughed, joked, made puns, played upon words, and kept us&#xD;
in good spirits for half an hour, at the end of which time he&#xD;
gave us his name as a profound secret, to go no further.&#xD;
That name was a singular one. It was Mai Vatterale-a&#xD;
very curious name ! He soon proposed an adjournment to&#xD;
the back parlor, and after reaching it he proceeded to&#xD;
arrange the chairs, six in a line, in the form of a triangle ;&#xD;
after doing this, Monsieur Vatterale signified to the Baron&#xD;
that his part of the preliminaries was completed, whereupon&#xD;
that gentleman, turning to his guests, said: 'I Was informed&#xD;
on the day that the present meeting was arranged with Mon-&#xD;
sieur, that in all cases it was- absolutely necessary that the&#xD;
physical systems of all who assist at, or witness his expeti-&#xD;
ments, should be duly fortified with food, for what particular&#xD;
reason I cannot imagine, nor is it necessary that I should&#xD;
inquire, seeing that it is his rule, of which all present were&#xD;
duly notified, so that all might forego their usual repasts at&#xD;
their own homes, and partake of a little souper with me, pre=&#xD;
vious to commencing our experiments, and'---&#xD;
"' Jermettez moi, s'il vous plait,' said Vatterale, courteously.&#xD;
&#xD;

192                   RAVALETTE.&#xD;
'Si cela vows est agriable'-4t is my custom, and is for the pur-&#xD;
pose of preventing any ill effects that might result from a shock&#xD;
of the nerves, which, believe me, you will be apt to experience&#xD;
before we have done.' Of course such an explanation, indi-&#xD;
cating, as it certainly did, no small degree of preventive so-&#xD;
licitude on the part of the illustrious foreigner, was perfectly&#xD;
satisfactory, and was accepted in a proper spirit by the&#xD;
whole company.&#xD;
"'This way, ladies ; this way, gentlemen, follow me,' said&#xD;
the Baron, gaily giving his arm to his wife, and leading the&#xD;
way to his splendid salle a manger.&#xD;
" The worthy noble had called it un petit super, but the&#xD;
magnificent spread before us rendered it a somewhat difficult&#xD;
task to imagine what would constitute a grand supper in his&#xD;
estimation. To describe it is no part of the task I am en-&#xD;
gaged on ; and, therefore, I shall merely observe that it was&#xD;
a most recherche affair. The furniture of the table, as well&#xD;
as the viands themselves, was of the most sumptuous descrip-&#xD;
tion, everything on it being of the richest and heaviest gold&#xD;
and silver plate-heir-looms of the old Noblesse, from whom&#xD;
the Baron was descended.&#xD;
"Dinner or supper once over, we all left the table, and once&#xD;
more adjourned to the back parlor, and took seats in the&#xD;
chairs arranged in a triangle, the ladies, six in number, occu-&#xD;
pying those which formed the western arm thereof. When we&#xD;
all were properly and comfortably seated, there was quite a&#xD;
la e vacant space before us, into which Vatterale placed&#xD;
two chairs facing each other, and also two foot-stools&#xD;

covered with damask plush-velvet close together in the&#xD;
other angle. He then proceeded to lock all the doors lead-&#xD;
ing into the apartment, tied all the keys together with a&#xD;
piece of scarlet ribbon, and then hung them to one of the&#xD;
glass prisms pendent from a large gas chandelier directly&#xD;
over the centre of what I may call, not inappropriately, our&#xD;
circle. The jets of this chandelier, seven in number, were all&#xD;
in full play under a strong head of gas, and the room in all&#xD;
parts was quite as light as if the sun shone into the windows,&#xD;
two of which occupied the northern end of the, parlor, both&#xD;
being very richly curtained, and both quite shut. I repeat,&#xD;
lest trickery in what followed should be suspected by your-&#xD;
self, that the seven jets of gas were brightly burning, and&#xD;
continued so all the evening, except when extinguished, with-&#xD;
out the aid of kumdai hands; and as they were put out, so&#xD;
also were they relighted more than once.&#xD;
"cHaving disposed of the bunch of keys, Vatterale went&#xD;
to both windows, exatmed them closely, fastened them&#xD;
down securely---that is to say, the lower sashes ; for he let&#xD;
down one of the upper ones, and threw the eastern external&#xD;
blinds wide open, and fastened them  so. Of course, the&#xD;
master of cerenionies had never been in that dwelling before,&#xD;
and of course could not have obtained information respecting&#xD;
it by the usual methods of visit and inquiry, yet, turning to&#xD;
the BarOn, he requested hin to ring for the servant, and&#xD;
through the closed door bid him remove an ornamental iron&#xD;
sofa from the chamber immediately above our heads, into the&#xD;
dark bed-room on the third floor, as its presence where it&#xD;

&#xD;
then stood would materially affect the experiments to be&#xD;
made&#xD;
"This request, made under such circumstances, surprised&#xD;
us all, but particularly the Baron, who stared at the man&#xD;
who made it, as if he regarded him as one risen from the&#xD;
dead ; and it was, forsooth, rather a startling circumstance,&#xD;
to say the least. He admitted that there was such a room,&#xD;
and such a dark chamber, au troisieme. Yet how the man&#xD;
knew it, was very strange, considering that he had been in&#xD;
,    the house but a short time, and had not left us for a mo-&#xD;
ment, nor spoken a single word to any of the servants, save&#xD;
on entering, to inquire if this was the Baron's residence.&#xD;
"Scarcely had we recovered from the surprise natural on&#xD;
such an occasion, than we were again made sensible that we&#xD;
were dealing with an extraordinary man, for, turning to me,&#xD;
he begged the loan of a small metallic coin which I had re-&#xD;
ceived as a present from Mr. Carr less than ten minutes before&#xD;
Vatterale entered the house, and which coin was remarkably&#xD;
curious and valuable on account of its high antiquity, and it&#xD;
was one of the only two known to be in existence, and had&#xD;
been begged for me by Mr. Carr, from his friend Blaise de&#xD;
Jong6, the celebrated Eastern traveller, and had only been&#xD;
sent in a note to Mr. Carr, by that eminent savant, the night&#xD;
;          previous. Having received the coin, Vatterale placed it in&#xD;
his pocket, and then taking out a set of ivory tablets, wrote&#xD;
a request thereon, and handed it to Madame la Marquise de&#xD;
la, Fronde, an elderly lady, foster sister to the Baron. The&#xD;
request was altogether so singular and so novel, that the old&#xD;
&#xD;
lady immediately read it aloud : ' Will Madame la Marquise&#xD;
have the goodness to retire to the alcove and remove from between&#xD;
her feet and stockings the metallic plates, and, separating the&#xD;
zinc from the copper ones, place each metal plate with its&#xD;
own kind, and restore them to her feet outside the hose!' The&#xD;
lady almost fainted with astonishment, for she averred that&#xD;
no mortalknew that she wore such plates, but that she had&#xD;
for ten years, and found them, by reason of the electric cur-&#xD;
rents they elaborated and imparted to her system, highly&#xD;
beneficial to her health. She retired as requested, and, re-&#xD;
turning in a minute, convinced us of the marvellous seeing&#xD;
faculty of the mysterious Mai, by exhibiting the plates, which&#xD;
were precisely as he had described. She again retired, and,&#xD;
shortly returning, resumed her seat. These preliminaries being&#xD;
concluded, Vatterale brought into the open space before us a&#xD;
small portmanteau, which he carried in his hand when he en-&#xD;
tered the mansion. From this he now took a coil of wire-in-&#xD;
deed, three small coils tied together-also a saucer of large&#xD;
dimensions of stone China, or thick, very thick porcelain, a&#xD;
large vial containing a colorless liquid, a box of paste or&#xD;
gum, two large, and entirely empty, thin bottles-so thin&#xD;
that we all looked through them at the light, as he handed&#xD;
them to us for that purpose. They were as clear as the best&#xD;
dow glass, as thin and as brittle, apparently, as the finest&#xD;
crystal. From the same receptacle he also took what&#xD;
looked like three rolls of paper, one very large when un-&#xD;
folded, the others quite small indeed. . The larger bundle he&#xD;
unrolled and spread upon the floor, on the space between the&#xD;

&#xD;
chairs and fautetils. It was aboat three teet in diameter,&#xD;
and was painted in all sorts of colors, and figures entirely&#xD;
nondescript. The centre of this article was immediately that&#xD;
of the triangle, 'The Symbolical figure of the Universe, or&#xD;
Oneness,' as he called it, and of course was directly beneath the&#xD;
large chandelier. This done, he placed the saucer right upon&#xD;
the centre of the symbolical chart, if I may so term it. Then,&#xD;
unfastening the coils of wire, he laid one along the laps of&#xD;
the gentlemen on one side, and fastened it by means of a link&#xD;
and hook to two others, which passed in front of the other two&#xD;
sections of the human trine. The wire held by the ladies (for&#xD;
we all were directed to grasp the wire before us with one hand,&#xD;
and the hand of the next neighbor with the other) was common&#xD;
iron, wound with silver foil ; the one before myself was steel,&#xD;
wound with gold wire ; and the other was of solid gold,&#xD;
wound, as were the others, at intervals, with floss silk. The&#xD;
ladies grasped with the left hand, and joined their right, while&#xD;
with the gentlemen this order was reversed. The next pro-&#xD;
ceeding on the part of Mai, was to place half of the gum&#xD;
into the saucer ; upon this he emptied the vial of colorless&#xD;
liquid, and set fire thereto. It burned with a clear and steady&#xD;
bluish flame. The gum was gradually consumed, and a pecu-&#xD;
liar and most delightful fragrance floated through the r .&#xD;
"During the burning process, the operator sat upon the&#xD;
stool, and gazed fixedly and intently upon, or rather toward,&#xD;
the open sash, while the rest of us were chatting merrily, and&#xD;
wondering what would be the result of all these weird and&#xD;
curious preparations.&#xD;

"I said the rest of us were merrily chatting, but. must&#xD;
qualify that observation by excluding from this employment&#xD;
one person, and that person was-myself, for I found its at.&#xD;
terly iinpossible to mingle in the conversation with that aban-&#xD;
don and uireserve which characterized the others. It was&#xD;
altogether beyond my power to forget the tremendous expe&#xD;
riences of that very day, which I had undergone. A weight&#xD;
was on my spirit that could not be lifted off. The 'Ghost&#xD;
of Ravalette' seemed to be invisibly hovering over me, and.&#xD;
although unseen, his presence seemed to be palpably felt by&#xD;
me. The events at Belleville constantly obtruded themselves&#xD;
before the eye of the mind ; the affair at the gardener's, the&#xD;
singular result of his impromptu wager, the woman at the&#xD;
Barriere, and, above all, the frightful occurrences at the Rue&#xD;
Michel le Compte, with its sure-absolutely sure-termina-&#xD;
tion on the Guillotine-the miserable and ignominious death&#xD;
of D'Emprat, and the unearthly means whereby his deed of&#xD;
crime-the crime a horrible murder, committed thirty-seven&#xD;
years before-the unearthly and mysterious means, I repeat,&#xD;
by which his guilt was brought to light--this, all this, sq&#xD;
oppressed me that I could not take a present interest in what&#xD;
wasrranspiring about me. Indeed, I cared little for either&#xD;
or his tricks-which, from observing the method of bia&#xD;
preparations, I had already not only despised, but put down&#xD;
to the score of legerdemain-clever and surprising, but still&#xD;
nothing more than legerdemain.&#xD;

was convinced of my mistaken. estimate of the man before us,&#xD;

will very soon be seen. As for his skill in detecting the&#xD;
coin, the* sofa, and the plates, I had already secretly ac-&#xD;
counted. I remembered Caspar Hauser, and several other&#xD;
ensitives, who could detect the presence of metals by what&#xD;
may be called 'magnetic sense.' His description of the&#xD;
dark bed-room au troisieme, was very simple, for nearly all&#xD;
old houses have such chambers on that floor ; this was an&#xD;
old house ; Vatterale saw it, and made what preliminary&#xD;
capital he could from his acuteness. With the present weight&#xD;
of experience ; with the memory of the deeds of the mystical&#xD;
Ravalette still fresh in mind, of course I could not be very&#xD;
highly interested in such displays of minor magic as I felt&#xD;
convinced were very shortly to be made by the conjuring&#xD;
gentleman before us.&#xD;
" Suddenly the man whose pretensions I had just been in-&#xD;
wardly criticising, partially raised himself from the stool,&#xD;
threw back his head until his long, wavy locks fell upon his&#xD;
shoulders, and muttered between his teeth, as if the word-&#xD;
birth was extremely painful, ' HE IS COMING I' and we noticed&#xD;
that his face, naturally of a dingy yellow, suddenly became&#xD;
of an ashen-hued paleness, and his eyes darted forth lumi-&#xD;
nous sparks that were plainly visible even amid the glair of&#xD;
that brilliantly-lighted apartment ; and at the same instipt&#xD;
he placed his right hand over the region of his heart-that&#xD;
is to say, over that part where nine-and-ninety of every hun-&#xD;
dred suppose the heart to be, namely, under the left breast.&#xD;
He did this as if to repress a rising pang, then turning to his&#xD;
audience, he exclaimed---' Look sharp ! Be firm ! be fear-&#xD;

Grasp the cord, retain each other's hands, make what re-&#xD;

"We all assented verbally, and not a few of the company&#xD;
began even to joke him on his sorcery and magic, when we&#xD;
all started from our seats, but were instantly motioned back&#xD;
by an anxious frown and a commanding, magisterial wave of&#xD;
his right hand. The simultaneous movement on our part,&#xD;
was caused by a yell, for such it was, that proceeded, not,&#xD;
as might be anticipated, from a female, but from a Mr. The-&#xD;
odore Dwight, an American gentleman, having from Phila-&#xD;
delphia-and at the present time still dwelling there.&#xD;
" This person, as all who know him will certify, is no weak,&#xD;
puling, nerveless man, for a man more the opposite of all this&#xD;
could scarce be found in a month's search.&#xD;
"The sound which came from his lips was a shriek of ter-&#xD;
ror, horror, and agony combined, as might well be fancied to&#xD;
come from the throats of the damned souls of the nether hell.&#xD;
It was, indeed, a paroxysm of deadly fright. In an instant&#xD;
all eyes were turned toward him. He was paler than a&#xD;
corpse, the very image of Death itself ; his eyes protruded&#xD;
from their sockets, and he trembled as if he stood before the&#xD;
final bar ; his lips refused to tell the cause of his distress, but&#xD;
his gaze was intently fixed, with an immovable expression of&#xD;
horror, upon the saucer on the floor. Instinctively our eyes&#xD;

followed the same direction, except Vatterale's, who still was,&#xD;
looking toward the open sash. With this exception, I re-&#xD;
peat, we all looked toward the floor, when, great God ! what&#xD;
a sight was there! The saucer was still there, but the two&#xD;
small rolls of paper were. gone ! Tey had disappeared, but&#xD;
in their stead we distinctly saw-for, recollect, there were&#xD;
seven full jets of gas in full blaze right over our heads-we&#xD;
saw, I reiterate, with our, eyes-physical, bodily eyes--three&#xD;
horrible beings, somewhat resembling overgrown scorpions--&#xD;
only, that instead of claws, they had-hands and arms !&#xD;
for all the world like those of a newly-born negro child !&#xD;
These detestable things, for I dare not blaspheme the Great&#xD;
Etprnal by calling them creatures, were about fiye inches&#xD;
broad on the back, by some eighteen in length. Their color&#xD;
was a deep crimson, mottled with purple, green, and yellow&#xD;
stripes and spots, and they were completely covered with&#xD;
scales, like thse" of an armadillo. Conceive, if you can, of a&#xD;
tarantula or spider so large, and which-each one of them-&#xD;
uoved about on the very tips of twelve legs, sixteen or&#xD;
eighteen inches long, and all the while whirling and twirling its&#xD;
h 1s and arms (two of each), eighteen, inches long and three-&#xD;
fourths as large as its body, and you will form a tolerable&#xD;
picture of the repulsive, unsightly, hideous monstrosities&#xD;
crawling, or rather 'stilting,' round that saucer 9nf the floor.&#xD;
"jF1ach one of these loathsome things had four large, pro&#xD;
trading eyes, closely resembling those of the monster Frog&#xD;
of India ; but these eyes, unlike the frog's, were. not leaden-&#xD;
hued; i stead of this being the, case, I think no spark of fire&#xD;
&#xD;
ever shone brighter--in fact, they. fairly gleamed;with what&#xD;
I can indicate by no other term than infernal, redness.; for&#xD;
it seemed that at every flash they emitted. the concentrated&#xD;
venom of a gorgon ; and beneath the fearful spell we-all, sat&#xD;
perfectly immovable with fear.&#xD;
- Wist our agony would have been had; the accursed&#xD;
things ventured to ;move toward us, I dare not even imagine,&#xD;
but they still and ever kept in the one track, moving with or-&#xD;
derly march around that saucer on the floor. We felt and&#xD;
knew that they were living,, actual realities, a. genuine and&#xD;
horrid trinity of fa4s, apd not a mere optical illusion, or the&#xD;
result of a plpy upon our fancies, mesmerie or otherwise.&#xD;
This opinion was confirmed by the most positive and; blasting.&#xD;
testimony, for, as they solemnly, demoniacally marched about&#xD;
the, centre of that symbolic. chart, they left a trailing streak&#xD;
of greenish-deed, hard, greenish ichor or pus, behind them&#xD;
at each;revolution, and; .a few drops of this fell upon the Ba-&#xD;
ron's carpet. Sqme months afterward, he and I exchanged&#xD;
letters on the events of that night, and he assured me that&#xD;
not a single chemical amongst the hundreds applied for the&#xD;
purpose had beg   of the least effect toward removing the&#xD;
stauh,, 'The carpet.has been discharged of its colors and re-&#xD;
dyed, yet no dye w41.cover those spots!l' This was not all,&#xD;

"'Talk not to me of legerdemain after this!, Speak not&#xD;
to me of optical illusion, or deceptive appearances, in the face&#xD;
of such facts as these, for here are .marks,' wrote the Baron&#xD;
to me, 'here are palpable evidences that defy contradiction.&#xD;
They were made on that night, and there they yet remain,&#xD;
and, albeit I cry, " Out, damned spots !" they will not, but&#xD;
persist in remaining absolute confirmations of vivid, strange,&#xD;
incontrovertible fads!'r&#xD;
"' But why did you not get up, under such circumstances,&#xD;
all of you, and escape from the room ?' is a very natural and&#xD;
perhaps not unreasonable question, that may without impro-&#xD;
priety be asked just here, and I reply : For several reasons ;&#xD;
among which a few shall be named. First, the doors were&#xD;
all securely locked, and although we had seen Mai mount a&#xD;
chair, and hang the keys to one of the glass pendants, yet&#xD;
upon looking there, we found that they, as well as the two&#xD;
rolls of paper, had disappeared. Secondly, the windows were&#xD;
fastened own, besides being many feet from the ground-at&#xD;
least fift n-and to leap that distance was altogether out&#xD;
9f the question, even had we thought of it, which we did not.&#xD;
Thirdly, the earnest and solemn warning given by Vatterale&#xD;
before anything took place ; his assurance that if we obeyed&#xD;
his injunctions not to stir-that, although we might be&#xD;
frightened, yet no harm could or would- befall us-acted,&#xD;
amidst all our terror, as a sort of stopper upon any precipi'&#xD;
tate movement, after the first shock was over.&#xD;
"We could not quit the room provided even all the doors&#xD;
had been flung wide open. Hast never heard tell of the fas-&#xD;

&#xD;
ciiatiom of Danger? If so, then know that it was upon us&#xD;
in all its terrible force and power. We were bound, chained,&#xD;
rooted, riveted to the spot, by a potentiality never to be&#xD;
questioned, never to be despised, for its might, when once it&#xD;
fastens upon its victim,4is merciless, griping, stern and unre-&#xD;
lenting. We felt that to stir, was to incur the hazard of an&#xD;
unknown, unguessed-at danger.   ALL were fascinated by&#xD;
terror ; to move was to add ten-fold to its power ! It was&#xD;
a feeling akin to that experienced by the native of Ind, who&#xD;
roused from his mid-day slumber, wakes to feel the clammy&#xD;
folds of the cobra-capello, the dreadful hooded serpent of his&#xD;
clime, slowly writhing and winding beneath his garments&#xD;
about his naked flesh ; and who realizes, as his heart stops&#xD;
beating and his blood runs icily with agony, and as the great&#xD;
big beaded drops of cold sweat ooze out from every pore,&#xD;
that to stir, to breathe, to even quiver under the pressure of&#xD;
his mortal fear, is certain, irrevocable, positive death-&#xD;
knowing as he does, that nor man nor beast hath ever yet&#xD;
lived a single hour after the fangs of the hooded snake have&#xD;
once opened a passage for the entrance of the King of&#xD;
Terrors!&#xD;
" And such was the pall that rested upon the eighteen&#xD;
persons in that room, as the detestable trinity moved slowly&#xD;
around that saucer on the floor ; their eyes-their great,&#xD;
.horny, bulging eyes-all the while scintillating and flashing&#xD;
with the very essence of intense malignity-malignity as of a&#xD;
devil ! The female portion of the company I fear may never&#xD;
recover from the shock that night received. They did not&#xD;

faint, or scream, or swoon, as perhaps it might have been&#xD;
suspected they would under such diabolic circumstances,&#xD;
simply, however, for the reason that the tension of soul and&#xD;
nerve was altogether too severe and great to permit, even for&#xD;
an instant, the reaction which is an absolute prerequisite to&#xD;
relief by or through the methods indicated.&#xD;
"Probably the length of time that elapsed from    the&#xD;
shriek of our comrade, till the final disappearance of the&#xD;
three monsters, did not exceed three minutes, yet in that&#xD;
brief space we had undergone years of terror.&#xD;
" Truly, the real lapse of time is not to be reckoned by&#xD;
the beats of the clock, but only by sensations and heart-&#xD;
throbs. Mai, at the termination of the time specified, rose&#xD;
from his stool, took a small basket from his portmanteau, and&#xD;
then fearlessly seizing the things, one at a time, he carefully&#xD;
doubled up their legs under them, and placed them in it.&#xD;
Then taking the two crystal bottles already alluded to, he&#xD;
placed them. lengthwise on the chart, with their necks and&#xD;
apertures facing. each other, after which he resumed his seat&#xD;
upon: the. foot-stool, addressing no word or sign to the specta-&#xD;
tors of his movements. And now it began to grow dark i&#xD;
The jets of gas appeared to burn less clear and fully, just as&#xD;
if{ some one was slowly turning the cocks which let it on,&#xD;
with a gradual movement. In a little while the room was&#xD;
darkened, .though not ,exactly dark, for there was still a dim.&#xD;
half light-a sort of semi-blue, semi-dull red, misty radi,&#xD;
ance,.just sufficient to enable us to distinguish objects vaguely,,&#xD;
indistinct and= dimly.&#xD;

"'Stir. not ! fear not!l' said the thick, husky. voice of&#xD;
Yatterale ; and before we could reply, a scene commenced,&#xD;
such as it hath seldom fallen to man's lot to witness.&#xD;
"'Allow me to explain a modern mystery,' said Vatterale,&#xD;
'but first let me remove your fears. Look 1'&#xD;
"-Scarcely had he spoken these words, than the room&#xD;
was suddenly illumiinated, as if the very air was aglow&#xD;
with the most brilliant light, and we saw the two bottles&#xD;
quite plainly. As we gazed upon these, there came from one&#xD;
the appearance of an enormous serpent, which proceeded to&#xD;
coil itself up, until its bulk thrice exceeded that of both the&#xD;
bottles. Then there came still another, and another, until no&#xD;
less than twelve lay there, coiled up in a loathsome pile ;&#xD;
but as the last one, emerged from one bottle, the first one&#xD;
entered the other, until all had.disappeared as.they had come.&#xD;
"'I will now show you that you.cannot always trust your&#xD;
own senses,' said Vatterale, 'nor account for what you. see;'&#xD;
and he straightway emptied the basket, and broke the bot-&#xD;
tIes. All three were empty I Not a sign of snake or scor-&#xD;
pion was there!&#xD;
"r' Again, I will show you a curious .thing, You will&#xD;
please call a servant, seat her, on one of those chairs and bid&#xD;
her on a wager hold. a skein of sik while it is being wounded&#xD;
merely to keep her attention-that is all. But,' and be&#xD;
spoke veryearnestly, '.whatever you see .or hear, L beg you&#xD;
will not utter a single word.'&#xD;
" This was assented to ; a skein of silk was.ordered, but&#xD;

WHAT MAKES THE RAPPINGSI       207&#xD;
&#xD;
"'It will be. just seventeen minutes before the girl is&#xD;
ready,' said Mai; 'and while waiting, I will demonstrate a&#xD;
fallacy. The creatures you have beheld to night are real,&#xD;
but ephemeral-they are Will-creations, and perish when the&#xD;
power ceases to act which called them into being. As proof&#xD;
of what I say,. Behold '&#xD;
"From the floor in the eastern corner. of the room there&#xD;
straightway begun to arise a light mist, which increased in&#xD;
bulk until a ball of vapor, three feet in diameter, floated in&#xD;
the air. Thus it remained for a minute ; and then, right be-&#xD;
fore our eyes, began to condense and change its shape, until.&#xD;
at the end of four minutes, it had assumed a human sem-&#xD;
blance-but, Heavens ! what a caricature !&#xD;
" At first it was a mere vapory outline, but it rapidly con-&#xD;
densed and consolidated, until what looked like a hideous,&#xD;
half-naked, bow-legged, splay-footed monster stood before&#xD;
us. Its height was less than three feet ; its chest and body&#xD;
were nearly that in width; its legs were not over eight inches&#xD;
long ; its arms were longer than its entire body ; its head&#xD;
was gigantic ; and it had no neck whatever, while from its&#xD;
horrible head there hung to the very ground the appearance&#xD;
of a tangled mass of wire-like worms. Its mouth was a fear-&#xD;
ful-looking red gash, extending to where ears should have&#xD;
been, but were not. Eyes, nose, cheeks, chin, lips or fore-&#xD;
head, there were none whatever. Do not imagine that this&#xD;
creature was merely an appearance ; it was not, for although&#xD;
born of vapor, in five minutes it became solid as iron, demon-&#xD;
strating the fact by stalking heavily across the floor right&#xD;
&#xD;
into the centre of the open space between us-the chains be-&#xD;
ing dropped as it approached-where it stood, slowly sway-&#xD;
ing to and fro, as if its heart was heavy.&#xD;
"' Show your quality,' said Mai to the thing. ' I will,' it&#xD;
hissed, and straightway proceeding toward a table, it stood&#xD;
by it a few minutes, and it became apparent that it was&#xD;
charging the wood with something from itself, for soon the&#xD;
table began to turn, to -tip, to move, to rise and float in the&#xD;
air, precisely as is done in spiritual circles.&#xD;
"'Now, ladies and gentlemen, you will please act just as&#xD;
if that before you was a human spirit, invisible to you, and&#xD;
desirous of imparting information. I dare say you will be&#xD;
surprised at the results. You see already that it is a capital&#xD;
table-mover, and I beg you to test its mental and physical&#xD;
powers also-for I assure you there is nothing to fear, now&#xD;
that I give you leave to break the silence-which was quite&#xD;
essential in the first part of the curious experiment.'&#xD;
" Thus assured, several of us asked the thing to show us&#xD;
what it could do. Whereupon it made motions as if it wanted&#xD;
to write. Paper and pencil being placed upon the table, it&#xD;
seized the pencil with its long claw-like fingers, and its hand&#xD;
flew over the page like lightning, and in ten seconds it fin-&#xD;
ished, and striking the table three heavy blows with its fist,&#xD;
signified that it had finished ; whereupon Mr. D-- reached&#xD;
for the sheet, and read therefrom one of the most tender mes-&#xD;
sages conceivable, from a dead mother to a living son.- Even&#xD;
the hand writing was a perfect fac-simile of his mother's ;&#xD;

How SPIRITUAL " ,USIO IS MADE.&#xD;
&#xD;
pbrases, used by her when alive, were given with minute pre,&#xD;
cision and fidelity ; As, for instance, 'sweet one, mine,' in-,&#xD;
stead of 'my sweet ,re.' Mr. D-- turned pale.     'Is it&#xD;
possible I have been so imposed upon-so horribly deceived ?'&#xD;
said he, for. he was a .devout follower of the modern .thau-&#xD;
maturgy.&#xD;
"Several further tests, equally successful and decisive,&#xD;
were then given by this ghostly thing, both by writing, tip-&#xD;
ping, rapping, and the production of beautiful phantom hands,&#xD;
faces,:flowers, and other objects, many of which were not only&#xD;
singular but .magnificent. Probablythousands of persons have.&#xD;
seen the curious pencil drawings, executed by 'mediums,' and&#xD;
which, are said to be portraits of.' Spiritualif.owers'-for .most&#xD;

the:eyeless monster, executed thirteen such--and they would&#xD;

" Now,' said, Vatterale, 'for something else.' And then&#xD;
addressing the thing, he- said: 'r You.. will- now render your-&#xD;
self viewless, and show what you can do. And first let, us have.&#xD;
some music.', Thenturning to the company, he stid: 'Real&#xD;
spirits love the light, but such as that invariably act most&#xD;
efficiently in the.dark-for then they have the.advantage: of&#xD;

incarnated to the incarnator-for it must not be forgotten&#xD;
that the entire phenomena exhibited by this wondrous per-&#xD;
sonage, were the creatures of his conscious will, brought into&#xD;
being and again cast out by a thought, and accord ing to a&#xD;
known and transferable form. True, there were others in&#xD;
whom this creative faculty existed, but then such persons&#xD;
either exercised the power involuntarily through the mechan-&#xD;
ical processes of mind and will, or else they are but- the&#xD;
proxies of the Larva. When he ceased speaking the m'n-&#xD;
ster was gone from our sight, but not from our hearing, for&#xD;
Mai gently waved his hand, and as he did so there came to&#xD;
us the softest, gentlest, sweetest, and the most soul-stirring&#xD;
strains of music that ever fell on human hearing. Above,&#xD;
below, around, now here, now there, close at hand, and then&#xD;
afar off, it sounded ; and the only comparison I, can make is,&#xD;
that it sounded like a solemn requiem chaunted by angels&#xD;
over the perished form of what was once a god-the tones&#xD;
were so pathetic, so solemn, so supremely sorrow-freighted&#xD;
--reminding one of the plaintive&#xD;
"'Huhm, meleagar malooshe,&#xD;
Huhm meleagar, ma-looshe,'&#xD;
only that it was ten-fold more profound, and stirred. depths&#xD;
the other could ,never reach.&#xD;
" This strange music was a perfect corroboration of the&#xD;
theory advanced by the Italian Count at, the seance before&#xD;
Napoleon, already mentioned ; for, ao wing that the being&#xD;

impossible for such conceptions to exist in it, for the reason&#xD;
that none but a mighty soul could create them, and the&#xD;
thing itself was exceedingly, revoltingly low in the scale of&#xD;
organization. But, on the other hand, if the thing were the&#xD;
creature of Mai's will, it was conceivable that it vocally ex-&#xD;
pressed his unuttered thought, itself totally unconscious of&#xD;
either the music or its meaning.&#xD;
"It ceased. It still remained invisible, and Mai proposed&#xD;
that Count de M      should hold one -end of an accordion,&#xD;
while the thing invisibly held and played upon the other.&#xD;
This was assented to, and the instrument, bottom up, was held&#xD;
at arm's length, directly beneath the light. It was played on,&#xD;
in masterly style, while in that position. It, as well as a&#xD;
guitar, harp and piano, were played on when no one was near&#xD;
them, and nothing to be seen ; and then, at the command&#xD;
of the arch-magician, the whole performance was repeated by&#xD;
the terrific thing in its perfectly visible form.&#xD;
"Presently, a knock at the door told us that the servant&#xD;
sent for had arrived, with the silk in her hand. She was ad-&#xD;
mitted ; the thing retired from view.&#xD;
"'Marie,' said the Baron, 'a wager is laid that one of&#xD;
these gentlemen cannot unwind a skein of silk which you are&#xD;
to hold, both of you being blindfolded. I wager that it can&#xD;
be done. If I win, you shall have three days to visit your&#xD;
family, besides something to carry to the old people and the-&#xD;
little ones. Now, you must not laugh or speak while the silk&#xD;
is being wound ; if you do I lose. Will you try?'&#xD;
" 'Certainly,' replied the girl ; 'and you shall see that I&#xD;
&#xD;
A ' MEDIUM' SCENA!&#xD;
&#xD;
211&#xD;
&#xD;
will ot laugh. Oh, papa, marnan, I shall have three days !&#xD;
Mon Dieu! but it is a fine thing !' And, taking the. seat&#xD;
offer d, she suffered the silk to be placed across her wrists,&#xD;
and e blindfolded by the Baroness.&#xD;
"This having been done, Mr. D      , at a sign from&#xD;
Vatterale, took the end of the cord, and began slowly to un-&#xD;
wind it.&#xD;
"'And now begin,' said the latter, speaking toward where&#xD;
the thing had disappeared. The command was heard. It&#xD;
came forth, touched the girl's hand, and instantly she was&#xD;
thrown into a profound trance, whence another touch revived&#xD;
her, but not to wakeful consciousness. Instead of this, she&#xD;
rose, threw down the silk, approached several musical instru-&#xD;
ments in succession, and played upon them most exquisitely.&#xD;
The thing touched her head, and she made love in the most&#xD;
tender terms to three gentlemen in succession, 'declaring to&#xD;
each in turn that he was her 'eternal affinity,' and had been&#xD;
so from the foundation of the world.&#xD;
" Again it touched her ; and, suddenly changing her man-&#xD;
ner, she declaimed in lofty strain. Now she was Charlotte&#xD;
Corday, then Maximillian the Incorruptible ; again, she was&#xD;
the Maid of Orleans, and then a simple Indian maiden. Now&#xD;
she was Malibran; and sung divinely ; anon, she was a strong-&#xD;
minded woman, and talked about the Divine creative work of&#xD;
woman ;-about love--that man had made it special when it&#xD;
should be general, and, therefore, free. She raved about the&#xD;
Bible, called it excellent soft bark ; called the Saviour the&#xD;
Nazarene ; spoke of the Deity as the Great Positive Mind ;&#xD;

how to get them ; progress and humbug, milky ways, and the&#xD;
people of Jupiter, with a hundred other follies, but which she,&#xD;
unlike her exemplars,. for the time believed. The scene con-&#xD;
tinued for at least two hours, at the end of which time Mai&#xD;
dismissed the thing, and restored the girl, who was totally ob-,&#xD;
livious of all that had occurred. She received sundry pieces&#xD;
of gold from those present, and left the room, doubtless desir-&#xD;
ing to unwind more silk at the same rate.&#xD;

Mai, 'and, perhaps, quite as interesting as anything you have&#xD;

of various-colored fire-red, green, blue, purple, scarlet, gold,&#xD;
silver, crimson, white and violet-leaping, flashing, dancing&#xD;
and frisking about, as if endowed with sensuous, joyous gaiety.&#xD;
Apparently, there were thousands of them, all moving in dis-&#xD;

suspended from the wall, now collecting in great masses in&#xD;
front of the splendid mirrors, and, anon, gliding along the&#xD;
floor, under our seats, through our feet, over the chairs, and&#xD;
about the carpet, as if in the very watonness of sport, their&#xD;
every motion being accompanied by a hissing sound, in kind,&#xD;
though not in volume, like that emitted by au ascending&#xD;

"' I told you we should meet again ! Be patient--this&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
ARRIVAL OF THE EDITOR.&#xD;
"Too excited to sleep, I threw myself upon the sofa, and&#xD;
turned the strange series of events over in my mind. Two&#xD;
things were absolutely certain, nay, three--1st, That neither&#xD;
Ravalette, Vatterale, nor the Italian Count, were men as are&#xD;
other men ; 2d, that not one of the company suspected this&#xD;
fact ; and 3d, that myself was the object, sole and alone, of&#xD;
these extraordinary visitations. Above and beyond all&#xD;
these, it was plain that my destiny was rapidly approach-&#xD;
ing a crisis, and that the Stranger (mentioned in the- le-&#xD;
gend), as well as Dhoula Bel, were still influencing me for&#xD;
purposes which I could not divine to their full extent.&#xD;
I had already become a Rosicrucian, had passed through&#xD;
five degrees, had visited the Orient, and was about to&#xD;
go again, had learned many dark   and solemn mysteries,&#xD;
been instructed in several degrees of magic, knew all about&#xD;
the Elixir of life, the power of will, the art of reading others'&#xD;
destinies, of constructing and using magic mirrors, and how&#xD;
to discover mines of precious metal, and had deeply regretted&#xD;
that the terrible oath whereby the true Rosicrucian binds&#xD;
himself never to seek wealth for himself, and never to accept&#xD;
riches as the price of the exercise of his power, prevented me&#xD;

-that she held one portion of my soul captive at times, but&#xD;
never filled it-that there was a possibility of escaping what&#xD;
I dreaded, could I meet and mingle with a certain soul in&#xD;
whose body ran no drop of Adamic blood ; and I almost re-&#xD;
solved to abandon all hope, perform the part required of me&#xD;
by my tempters of Belleville, the Tuilleries, and Boston, when&#xD;
suddenly I remembered the paper that Ravalette had placed&#xD;
in my hand, as also the present left for me by Vatterale, but,&#xD;
resolving to omit all care concerning them till morning, at&#xD;

plete the narrative of Beverly, his friend.&#xD;
I had just reached Paris from Marseilles, where I had&#xD;
arrived a few days before, by way of Malta, from Alexan-&#xD;
dria. On reaching Paris it was my intention to rest but one&#xD;
night there, and then pursue my way via Rouen, in Nor-&#xD;
mandy, to Dieppe and England, and thence home to Ame-&#xD;
rica. Like all other travellers, I desired to spend a week in&#xD;
Paris, but business prevented, consequently I made prepara-&#xD;
tions to leave the famous city on the day following my&#xD;
arrival ; but I resigned myself to this necessity with all the&#xD;
more fortitude, for the reason that by so doing I should be&#xD;
able to retain the company of a very pleasant gentleman,&#xD;
whose society I had enjoyed continually from Cairo, where&#xD;
we first met, to Paris, and which I  eight, by making no&#xD;
stop in the latter place, continue to enjoy all the way home,&#xD;
as he intended to start just so soon as he rejoined his daugh-&#xD;
ter, who, for about three years had been receiving her edu-&#xD;
cation in Paris, and whom he was about to, conduct to his&#xD;
home-a newly-purchased one in New York.&#xD;
The history of Mr. Im Hokeis and his adventures, as&#xD;
216&#xD;
&#xD;
m HOKEIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
related to me on our journey, are so well worth repeating&#xD;
that I shallgive a short abstract, even at the risk of enlarging&#xD;
this chapter.&#xD;
" I was born," said he, "onethe banks of the Caspian Sea,&#xD;
of the family of Hokeis-a sacred family, in whom was invested&#xD;
the highest order of Priesthood, and on whom devolved the&#xD;
care of the sacred fire, for we were Guebres, and the fire&#xD;
must never be extinguished, nor had it been, so say our&#xD;
records, for many thousand years, foi Religion with us is&#xD;
quite a different thing from what it is among the men of&#xD;
Islam, India, Rome, or the West. We pride ourselves upon&#xD;
the purity of our faith, and its superiority to all that is pro-&#xD;
fessed by the children of Adam, quite as much as we do our&#xD;
Pedigree from Ish, the great founder of our race and a power-&#xD;
ful pre-Adamite king and conqueror."&#xD;
I cannot now afford time to repeat the arguments by which&#xD;
Im Hokeis demonstrated the startling proposition that there&#xD;
were other people living on earth besides those who claimed&#xD;
Adam as their founder. All this may be found elsewhere.*&#xD;
He said that he was destined from birth to be chief priest of&#xD;
the Faith, and had married a woman of his tribe and rank,; at&#xD;
the early age of seventeen. Near the time he was about being&#xD;
ordained, war had broken out between the Guebres and; their&#xD;
Persian tyrants. Himself and wife were captured,. taken. to&#xD;
Herat, and there condemned to lose their -eyes, from which&#xD;
*The argument proving the existence of the human race thousands of years&#xD;
anterior to the date of Adam, may be found in "Pre-Adamite Man." By Grlia&#xD;
Lee. New York. S. Tousey. 1868.&#xD;

&#xD;
horrible fate they were rescued by a member of the British&#xD;
Embassy, with whom they remained for nearly three years,&#xD;
by which. time they had mastered the English language.&#xD;
While in the service of the minister, Hokeis had the good&#xD;
fortune to save his life, in consequence of which a friendship&#xD;
sprung up between them so strong, that when the Embassy&#xD;
returned to Britain the two Guebres went with it. Arrived&#xD;
in London, Hokeis received an appointment as interpreter,&#xD;
and soon acumulated means, after which he entered into a&#xD;
direct trade with Persia, and ' although, during the nine&#xD;
years in which he was engaged therein, heaven had not sent&#xD;
him any children, yet it had blessed him with abounding&#xD;
wealth,-&#xD;
At length, in the thirteenth year of their married life,'&#xD;
their prayer was answered, and it became evident that God&#xD;
was about to send them a child. He did, and a beautiful girl&#xD;
was born, but the eyes of her mother were closed in death at&#xD;
the moment it first saw the..light.&#xD;
One day the nurse, who was a relative of Hokeis' wife,&#xD;
was wheeling the child around the walks of Hampstead Heath,&#xD;
when they wandered within the precincts of a gipsy encamp-&#xD;
ment, and the girl was persuaded to have her own and the&#xD;
child's fortune told. The complexion and features of the&#xD;
twain led to remarks on their nationality, and by skillful&#xD;
maneuvering the gipsy woman ascertained that the couple&#xD;
before her were Guebres by birth, and had been by religion.&#xD;
The miummery over and the fee paid, the girl went home&#xD;
with her charge. They were followed, and on that very&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE STOLEN CHILD?&#xD;
night, while the nurse slept, the child was stolen., Search&#xD;
was made for the gang of gipsies-the abduction having&#xD;
been clearly traced to them, by reason of a note left behind&#xD;
by the robber, stating that the child would be well cared for&#xD;
-but in vain, for on the very next day the whole gang,&#xD;
thirty in number, had sailed in a packet from t  4 ndon&#xD;
Docks, for America.&#xD;
Many years rolled by, when one day, as the disconsolate&#xD;
father was walking in the garden of the same house whence&#xD;
the child was stolen, he was accosted by an old beldame,&#xD;
who asked him what he would pay in gold in return for in-&#xD;
formation respecting his child. It is needless to narrate the&#xD;
successive steps taken. Suffice it that within twenty-four&#xD;
-     hours the father and the gipsy were on the ocean, going as&#xD;
fast as steam would carry them toward the Western World.&#xD;
-. . .The child, now a regal woman, was found, and father&#xD;
and daughter lived with each other for a time in New York,&#xD;
where a fine property had been bought ; for the old gentle-&#xD;
man so liked the New World that he determined to settle&#xD;
there for life, after his daughter had been properly cultured&#xD;
in Europe, whither he soon took her, and then, after trans-&#xD;
mitting the bulk of his fortune to America, went on a final&#xD;
visit to his people in Persia, his friends and co-religionists in&#xD;
the East. I had met with him as already stated, when on&#xD;
his return from Egypt to France.&#xD;
This brings us to the night of my' arrival in Paris. It&#xD;
being impossible to join his child that night, Hokeis and&#xD;

myself drove to a hotel in the Palaise Royale, and were at,&#xD;
the -satisfactory end of a supper, when a person who was&#xD;
totally unknown to either of us entered the salle a manger,&#xD;
and, making a profound obeisance to us both, said: "$gute!&#xD;
I come to tell you, Im Hokeis, that you will lot quit Paris&#xD;
to-morrow. But at the hour of four you will take your&#xD;
daughter to the house that is last but one. on the left ascend-&#xD;
ing the Boulevart de Luxembourg. You will ask me no ques-&#xD;
tions, but will obey. My authority I thus give. you," and he&#xD;
whispered three words in the ear of Hokeis, that caused the&#xD;
latter to start as if he hacd been shot. He had received te&#xD;
secret countersign of the priests of fire!' Then turning to me,&#xD;
he said, "You will go early in the morning to the Hotel&#xD;
Fleury. There you will find Beverly, your friend, join him ;&#xD;
go where he goes, and quit him not for an instant for the&#xD;
next two days-his salvation depends upon it ! Now I go.&#xD;
Forget not the words of the Stranger."&#xD;
I was thunderstruck. Hokeis and I talked much that&#xD;
night before we slept. What we spoke of is easily to be&#xD;
conceived.&#xD;
This brings me to my next meeting with Beverly, whose&#xD;
fortunes we will now follow.&#xD;
It will be remembered that Ravalette had given him a&#xD;
paper just before they parted in Belleville, and that Vatterale&#xD;
had also left something for him at his hotel. Bearing this in&#xD;
mind, observe what* followed.&#xD;

placed by Ravalette inthe hands Of Beterly When they parted&#xD;

The identical direction, and aliiost in the very words giveit&#xD;
by the mysterious personage to Hokeis, in the hotel of the&#xD;
Palais Royale on the previous night. The circumstances&#xD;
zrade a great impression on my mind, but prudence forbadd&#xD;
all mention of it to Beverly. He seemed quite glad of this&#xD;
opportunity of solving the strange riddle, and, to my great&#xD;
delight, begged and insisted that I should spend the day with&#xD;
him, and in .he evening we would investigate the subject to-&#xD;
gether; and that I readily consented, maY be easily imagined&#xD;
There were several motives prompting tue in this affa{-nfi-&#xD;
osity, friendship, and a vague hope of baffling what Beeilf&#xD;
regarded as his doom. Those who have read carefully tat&#xD;
has here been written, will remember that Beverlf had con-&#xD;
vinced me that there was more in the strange legend, rega  .&#xD;
ig the king, the princess, the riddle, the mi-der, and the chi6&#xD;
and its fulfillment, than the majority of people would be *iI .&#xD;
ing to concede. In short, I Was decidedly inclined to be1%&#xD;
in Dhoula Bel aid the other doomand one, but I had  o fitb&#xD;
whatever in either Mikkus, Ravalette, the Italian Doitit,ot&#xD;
Vatterale. I did not believe all these named belonged to one&#xD;
person, and I finally settled dow  on the following theory,&#xD;
point by point :-=1st, That tiere was in existence a society,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE HOUSE O ! T b )OULEVABT..&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7538-00000112"/>&#xD;
222&#xD;
&#xD;
having its head-quarters in Paris, the members, of which were&#xD;
practisers of Oriental magic and necromancy, in which they&#xD;
were most astonishingly expert. 2d, That the organization&#xD;
had for its object, not the attainment of wealth or political&#xD;
position, but abstract knowledge, and the absolute rule of the&#xD;
world through the action and influence of the brotherhood&#xD;
upon the crowned heads and officials of the world. 3d, That&#xD;
this association was governed by a master-mind, and that&#xD;
mind was Ravalette's. 4th, That this society had cultivated&#xD;
mesmerism to a degree unapproachable by all the world be-&#xD;
sides That they had exhausted ordinary clairvoyance, and&#xD;
eagerly sought a brain which would admit of the most&#xD;
thorough magnetization, and whose natural tendency was to-&#xD;
ward the mystical, transcendental and weird, yet strong,&#xD;
strong-willed, logical, emulative, daring and ambitious ; and&#xD;
that, to discover such, their agents had traversed all four&#xD;
continents of the globe ; and that finally they had heard of&#xD;
Beverly, whose fame as a seer was world-wide ; that they had&#xD;
found him, and, beyond doubt, had learned the strange parti-&#xD;
culars of his life, the legend, and his hope. They had seen&#xD;
him, and at once decided that, under their wonderful manipu-&#xD;
lation, he could be placed in a magnetic slumber many degrees&#xD;
nore profound than is possible in one case in five millions, and&#xD;
reach a degree of mental lucidity and psycho-vision that would&#xD;
not only surpass all that the earth had yet witnessed in that&#xD;
direction, from Budha, Confucius, Zoroaster, and the Oracles&#xD;
of Greece, down to the days of Boehme and the Swede,&#xD;
since when there has been no clairvoyant really worthy of the&#xD;

name. True, there were semi-lucides in abundance, but these&#xD;
either were only capable of reading or noting material objects,&#xD;
and, at best, repeating the thoughts of other men, or giving&#xD;
the contents of books as original matter, heaven-derived---as&#xD;
the self-styled "great (sic) American seer" gave forth the&#xD;
contents of a volume written by Pierpont Greeves, mixed and&#xD;
muddled up with a few really sublime thoughts taken from&#xD;
the minds of his scribe, his mesmerizer, and the highly intel-&#xD;
lectual coterie who gathered round him during his stances.&#xD;
5th, They knew that, unless Beverly's will accorded with&#xD;
their desire, it would be useless to attempt to gain their ends&#xD;
through him ; and hence, all their efforts by playing the shining&#xD;
bait of magic for the purpose of inducing him to consent to&#xD;
anything in order to gain their power. Hence, too, their gift&#xD;
of the secrets of the Magic Mirror, the Elixir of Life, of Youth,&#xD;
of Love, and a score of others equally curious and invaluable&#xD;
to the student of the soul. 6th, It was clear that, while&#xD;
these men knew much of the Rosicrucian system, they were&#xD;
not in full harmony or accord with that brotherhood.&#xD;
. Thus I reasoned, and it was easy to account for the scenes&#xD;
in the Boston office and at Beverly's home-the apparent&#xD;
immunity Miakus enjoyed from the effects of the fire, which&#xD;
burnt the chair but not his thigh, I accounted for on the&#xD;
ground that chemistry helped him, as it had a score of " fire-&#xD;
kings " beside.&#xD;
Thus far, I felt that my theory covered the whole ground&#xD;
of this clever fraternity ; but when I recurred to the scenes&#xD;
witnessed by no less than eighteen people at the house of the&#xD;

If.&#xD;

Baron, I confess, candidly, that it utterly failed. Still, I&#xD;
totally rejected all supernaturalism as connected with the&#xD;
affair, and, attributing the whole to expert trickery, I deter-&#xD;
mined to lay a trap to catch the performers in the very act,&#xD;
and flattered myself that it would be successful. " Ho ! ho !&#xD;
Mr. Yatterale, I'll show  you !" I exclaimed, as I shook&#xD;
Beverly's hand, and leaving him, to bathe, dress, and break-&#xD;
fast alone, I hurried out, ostensibly to go to the post-office,&#xD;
but, in reality, to visit the head-quarters of the Paris Police,&#xD;
which .I did, and, when there, briefly but clearly stated my&#xD;
belief that a friend of mine was being victimized in the man-&#xD;
ner stated ; to all of which the chief official lent an attentive&#xD;
ear, caused my proces verbal to be recorded, directed me how&#xD;
to proceed so as not to alarm the suspected parties, and pro-&#xD;
minsed to have a posse on hand very close to the house on the&#xD;
l3oulevart de Luxembourg by the hour named. On my way&#xD;
back to the Hotel Fleury, I dropped in to see if Hokeis was&#xD;
home, but found only a note, informing me that he had gone&#xD;
to Versailles after his daughter. I rejoined Beverly.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE BOULEVART DE LUXEMBOURG.&#xD;
IMPATIENT as I was for the hour to arrive, iii which all my&#xD;
doubts might be far'ever solved, yet Beverly was atil more&#xD;
so. No condemned man evei wished inor6 afdentlf for the&#xD;
moment when, by the halter or the glaive, the grand secret&#xD;
should be revealed to him, than did my friend for that in&#xD;
which he should know the best or the worst for him.&#xD;
Three o'clock found us within a stone's throw of the house&#xD;
designated as the rendezvous, and the three or foin little&#xD;
shingles in front of it with " Appartements a loi'er," ' Chamn-&#xD;
byes garni;" and "Cabinets mueubles," told at onde that it=&#xD;
was one of those tniddle-class establishments where a p49o4i&#xD;
might hire rooms and live undisturbed for a whole lifetime&#xD;
provided the rent was duly paid.&#xD;

before the least inquiry Was made, the codierge canm dut Of&#xD;

&#xD;
* Following his directions, we ascended a broad, winding&#xD;
stairway of stone, and found ourselves on a landing. From&#xD;
this landing one stairway ascended, and another led to the&#xD;
court below. At the further end, but on the side/ was a&#xD;
door, and at the hither end another. The house itself stood&#xD;
quite isolated from all others, and the windows of the rooms,&#xD;
it was clear, must overlook the boulevart and a lane crossing&#xD;
it at right .angles. We entered the first door, and found&#xD;
ourselves in a very plainly-furnished; large, square room, hav-&#xD;
ing two windows at the end, two more on the side, a cup-&#xD;
board, recess, and two large folding doors, both standing&#xD;
wide open, so that, finding no person in the first room, we&#xD;
passed through them into the second, but still failed to see or&#xD;
even hear the least indication that their occupant was any-&#xD;
where around. I was glad of this, for it gave opportunity&#xD;
for an examination of the premises ; therefore calling the&#xD;
concierge, I asked him the name, occupation, and period of&#xD;
occupancy of his second-floor tenant, to which he very&#xD;
readily responded, by saying that his tenant was a foreign&#xD;
scholar named Elarettav ; that he was wealthy, had lived&#xD;
there five years, and saw very little company, never dined or&#xD;
eat in the house, and in short was a very fine man, indeed-&#xD;
he paid two louis a month for porter's fees !. The concierge&#xD;
left, and I carefully remarked the place, and found the floor&#xD;
and ceiling was of stone, as are all French -houses. The&#xD;
cupboard was low, narrow, and filled with wine bottles and&#xD;
glasses, far more like a student's quarters than a grave phi-&#xD;
losopher's like Ravalette, if, indeed, that personage was the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ELARETTAV IS RAVALETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
227&#xD;
&#xD;
same described as Elarettav by the porter. The recess was&#xD;
small and simple, and contained nothing but a cot bedstead&#xD;
and its appropriate furniture. I concluded that there was&#xD;
no preparation for magic, if any was intended, and as this&#xD;
notion passed through my mind, the clock struck four, and&#xD;
we heard the footsteps of a man in the other room, notwith-&#xD;
standing the door was not seen to open. We went to that&#xD;
other room, and, "Ravalette, as I live !" exclaimed Beverly;&#xD;
and, sure enough, there stood, calmly smiling, just such an&#xD;
old gentleman as I had heard described.&#xD;
"You have sought, and you have found me ! I hope you&#xD;
will profit by the finding," said he to Beverly ; "and you,&#xD;
sir, have done well to accompany your friend,". addressing&#xD;
me in a tone slightly insulting, and all the more so from&#xD;
being slight. It was evident that he did not relish my pre-&#xD;
sence in the least, and as for me I had no sooner set eyes on&#xD;
my man than I felt assured of the truth of my theory, and&#xD;
that. I stood in presence of one of the ablest intellects on&#xD;
earth-a man capable of all that had been attributed to&#xD;
him, and one who would reach his goal and carry his point&#xD;
at all hazards, even if in doing so it were necessary to sail&#xD;
through seas of human blood. I flatter myself on my&#xD;
ability to measure men and to circumvent deliberate villainy,&#xD;
and no sooner had I heard the tones of Ravalette's voice,&#xD;
and seen the clear-cuit features of his face, than I at once&#xD;
suspected some sort of foul.play was on the tapis, and which&#xD;
I determined to thwart, even if I had to give him the solid&#xD;
contents of a couple of Derringers and a Colt's revolver,&#xD;
&#xD;
226&#xD;
&#xD;

229&#xD;
&#xD;
which I had taken care to provide myself with before 'ven-.&#xD;
turitg into what night have been the den of unscrupulods&#xD;
wretches, for aught I knew to the contrary. It may be that&#xD;
Etaalette read my thoughts, for he certainly looked uneasy,&#xD;
but said nothing, for at that moment the contcierge threw&#xD;
open the door and announced " Monsieur IRokeis et fle," and&#xD;
my travelling companion and his daughter-the most volup-&#xD;
t ous and glorious looking woman that I had ever beheld in&#xD;
say land, not even excepting the glowing beauties of Beyrout&#xD;
or Stamboul-entered the room.&#xD;
Ravalette seemed to have been expecting them, and did not&#xD;
appear at all surprised at their uninvited presence ; but the&#xD;
effet upon Hokeis and his daughter, the very moment they&#xD;
beheld his face, was perfectly electrical, yet totally dissimilar,&#xD;
for Hokeis instantly threw himself upon his knees before&#xD;
Ravalette, bent his head, and folded his hands in an attitude&#xD;
half supplieatory, half adoring, and said :&#xD;
" Oh, dread genius of the Fire and the Flame! do I see&#xD;
thee 4e6he   Alas I I am a wretched man, but thou art pow-&#xD;
erftd and will forgive I My defection was not my choice,&#xD;
but that of accident, and in, the religion of Isauvi have I&#xD;
f tnd note peace than ever in thy temples or the temples of&#xD;
Astartes I"&#xD;
My berin fairly reeled beneath the tremendous rush of&#xD;
etetions, confticting as a whirlwind, excited by this extraor-&#xD;
diiWry see e&amp;amp;; while, as for Beverly, his face was like an&#xD;

change, for the woman, who appeared not to have taken the&#xD;
least notice of her father's action or speech, went straight up&#xD;
to Ravalette, placed her jewelled hand upon his shoulder,&#xD;
looked him straight in theeye, as if she would wither and&#xD;
crush him at a glance, and in a voice low, but clear and&#xD;
deep, said : " And so, thou fiend, we meet again ! Art going&#xD;
to essay more of thy tricks and magic spells ? Art going&#xD;
to set more snares for the daughter of Im Hokeis ? Wretch,&#xD;
thou art foiled again ! What, tell me, what i thou fiend of&#xD;
Darkness, couldst thou gain by persecuting me now, as in&#xD;
my loneliness ? What wouldst thou gain by seeing me&#xD;
wedded-to 'no matter who'm'-as you. said, so long as&#xD;
I wa   wedded ?   Why   have you haunted   me, asleep&#xD;
and awake, tempting, -driving me toward a marriage ?&#xD;
What hadst thou to gain?   You do not answer. Well,&#xD;
I will answer for you :                       -&#xD;
"Do you remember a day, long years ago, when I was a&#xD;
child, beyond the great salt sea, that you came to an old&#xD;
man's door and craved shelter for the night ? Well, I do.&#xD;
You were received by the generous Indian. You shared his&#xD;
table, his pipe, and his cider. Then, as you sat by the fire,&#xD;
you noticed me, and must needs tell my fortune. You did&#xD;
so, and truly. You said that in one month from that day.I&#xD;
should. meet a sad-hearted youth, weary, weeping, miserable,&#xD;
lonely ; that he would engage my heart, and that I would&#xD;
easily be led to love and wed him ; but that if I did so,&#xD;
black clouds would lower over us, and that our morn of love.&#xD;
would bring a noon of dislike, an evening of sorrow, and a&#xD;

THE DRAMA INTENSIFIES.           231&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
night of crime, 'ignominy and death. You said that my&#xD;
union with any other man would bring all that could render&#xD;
life desirable. I believed you, for a hundred things that you&#xD;
foretold came to pass. At length, three weeks of the month&#xD;
elapsed ; and one night I had a dream, and in it I saw you,&#xD;
and the young man, whom in the body I had never yet beheld.&#xD;
In that dream you repeated all that you had said before,&#xD;
and then you disappeared ; but your hateful presence had no&#xD;
sooner quit me than there came a glorious being, robed in&#xD;
majesty and beauty, who bade me heed you not, but to love&#xD;
this poor creature whose shadow was then before me-to&#xD;
love, but not confess it till the proper time should come ;-&#xD;
that if I wedded another than him I might be happy, but&#xD;
that if I married him I would redeem a soul from a terrible&#xD;
fate. He bade me resist you, and to encourage the youth,&#xD;
cheer up his heart, and tell him not to despair, for he might&#xD;
be happy yet. He also "-but she had not time to say an-&#xD;
other word; for Beverly rushed forward, pushed Ravalette&#xD;
away, seized the woman's hand, kissed it, and exclaimed :&#xD;
"'Evlambea '&#xD;
"'Beverly 1'&#xD;
And in an instant they were locked in each other's&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
It was indeed'*the friend of long-gone years, and yet I had&#xD;
not even suspected this fact, even after hearing the story of&#xD;
Im Ilokeis and the gipsy adventure.&#xD;
I felt that this drama was getting deeper every minute,&#xD;
but had not time to think of one half of what was occurring&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ere the door was opened by no less a personage than the&#xD;
Commissary of Police, followed by two of the garde de ville,&#xD;
while, through the open door, I saw that the stairs and land-&#xD;
ing were literally crowded with gens d'arms.&#xD;
The drama was getting very serious.&#xD;
Ravalette stood unmoved, and smiled, saying :&#xD;
" Your trouble is in vain, monsieur ! You are not wanted&#xD;
here, and will immediately return whither you came, while&#xD;
monsieur here, who engaged you to come, is at liberty to re-&#xD;
main."&#xD;
This cool speech disconcerted the official a little, but he&#xD;
replied : " It is my duty to protect all who demand it for&#xD;
themselves or others."&#xD;
"True ; but in this case no act has been committed or&#xD;
designed that could in the least afford just ground for such&#xD;
a demand. Still, as you are here, why here you may&#xD;
remain until you Ore satisfied of the truth of my remarks.&#xD;
Pray be seated."&#xD;
The term "intensely dramatic " would not begin to give an&#xD;
adequate notion of the "situation" at this particular junc-&#xD;
ture of affairs. The only person who was, completely at&#xD;
ease was Ravalette. As for Hokeis, the brush of Michael&#xD;
Angelo and Raphael combined could not have done justice&#xD;
to his portrait, nor have limned one-hundredth part of the&#xD;
intense and overwhelming astonishment and horror depicted&#xD;
on his countenance at what he beheld and heard. No two&#xD;
persons looked at the affair in the same light, nor regarded-&#xD;
the Enigma from the same point of view, neither did they&#xD;

comprehend each other, but all were comprehended by the&#xD;
giet master before them.&#xD;
For a While -an unpleasant silence reigned, which was at&#xD;
length, much to my surprise, broken by my Rosicrucian&#xD;
friend, Beverly, who, looking Ravalette straight in the eye,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
" Whoever you are, I forgive you for the attempt to pre-&#xD;
vent myself; a son of Adam, wedding with this woman, Ev-&#xD;
lamba, the Bright-shining Daughter of Ish ; I forgive yob&#xD;
for persecuting her toward a marriage with another, which&#xD;
.marriage must have doomed ime to a fate I have for centuries&#xD;
shrunk fromh ; I forgive you all the woe yon have caused me,&#xD;
because gratitude for what you have done for brie exacts this;&#xD;
and because I suspect your agent saved mhy life when the re-&#xD;
toift buist in Boston, when I was repeating La Briere's en&#xD;
pierinient with phosphorus. Through you, of such as you, I&#xD;
have learned priceless secrets. The mystery of Magic Mir-&#xD;
rors I am grateful for being taught. The se8&amp;amp;t of ad ,&#xD;
-the art of making the Elixir of Life, whereof whosoever&#xD;
shall drink shall never know decay, but so long as once a&#xD;
year he shall qQff thereof, may enjoy perpetual youth-I am&#xD;
inexpressibly thankful for. I shall never use this secret for&#xD;
that purpose, but five of the seven ingitedients, *hen mii-&#xD;
gled, constitute what chemistry has sought in vain; and bd-&#xD;
queathing this portion of the formuhe to my friend, and&#xD;
through him to the medical world, I shall atone for my few&#xD;
faults by giving 'life to thousands.&#xD;
SFreely, without force or compulsion, I solemnly promise&#xD;
&#xD;
" PIERRE, CALL TZE GUARD I"&#xD;
&#xD;
to sleep the sleep of Sialam before I quit this house, and in it&#xD;
will truly answer you all I may be able to, on condition that&#xD;
you previously clear up the mystery surrounding yourself ;&#xD;
thus voluntarily giving you what an age of fraud would not&#xD;
enable you to obtain, you first solemnly promising, by Him&#xD;
by whose will you exist, be you man or demon, not to influ-&#xD;
ence mne, either now or when I shall slumber."&#xD;
A gleam of sudden joy flashed from the eyes of the strange&#xD;
being before us. He looked like a bridegroom in the fullness&#xD;
of his joy, and clasping both hands-pale, thin, bluish-white&#xD;
.hands-upon his breast, he looked up and said :&#xD;
So be it ! I solemnly bind myself, by the most terrible&#xD;
oath conceivable, that I accept all your conditions."&#xD;
Then going to the recess mentioned before, he brought&#xD;
thence a semi-circular screen, a little taller than a man, and&#xD;
about four feet in diameter. This he requested the Comn-&#xD;
missary of Police to examine, who did so, and declared it to&#xD;
be nothing but a common bedside screen.&#xD;
"You are right ! it is nothing but a bedside screen. Such&#xD;
as it is, however, I request you to select for it any spot yow&#xD;
choose upon the stone floor of either of these rooms. I shall&#xD;
want to go behind it ; and that you may not harbor a&#xD;
thought of an intended evasion on my part, I request that&#xD;
you call your men intothe room and give them orders to&#xD;
shoot me if I attempt to pass them 1"&#xD;
" Just as you please, nionsieur I Pierte, call the guard."&#xD;
In obedience to this summons, the corps de garde filed,&#xD;
into the room, twenty-seven strong, and as soon as the last&#xD;

man entered, the officer addressed them, saying, as he pointed&#xD;
to Ravalette, " This gentleman thinks to escape. See to it&#xD;
that he does not pass you alive. The very instant that, he&#xD;
appears unattended by myself, fire upon him. I so command&#xD;
you : see that my orders are executed. Does that suit you,&#xD;
Monsieur Ravalette ?"&#xD;
" Perfectly-perfectly ! nothing could be better," said the&#xD;
latter&#xD;
"You will place fourteen  men around the house to&#xD;
watch the windows, and the other thirteen you will distribute&#xD;
on the stairs and landing," said the commissary.&#xD;
"It shall be done," said the sergeant, as he marched his men&#xD;
from the chamber-but not till I had placed a double-barrel-&#xD;
led Deringer and a Colt's revolver, both freshly capped and&#xD;
loaded, in his hands-for I hated Ravalette ; man or demon, I&#xD;
hated him religiously-that being the strongest kind of dis-&#xD;
like-and I had an intense desire to, ascertain whether he&#xD;
was bullet-proof or not&#xD;
During all this time, the father, daughter, lover, myself,&#xD;
and the commissary's two comrades had said nothing, but at&#xD;
a sign from Ravalette we took our seats in such a position&#xD;
that we commanded the hall-door, that between the two&#xD;
rooms, the recess, the cupboard, and the windows on either&#xD;
side. The commissary placed the convex side of the screen&#xD;
toward us, in the middle of the room, and then taking a&#xD;
seat by my side, said, that so far . as he was concerned, all&#xD;
was ready, and from the pallor of his lips, the tone in which&#xD;
he spoke, and from the frequency with which he crossed himself&#xD;

D&#xD;
&#xD;
RAVALETTE EXPLAINS.              28&#xD;
and muttered an orison, compounded of bad French and worse&#xD;
Latin, it was clear that he wished his hands well washedof&#xD;
the whole affair.&#xD;
" I, too, am ready," observed the wizard, "and I, who&#xD;
have nothing to conceal, declare that I am he whom yonder&#xD;
man-Im Hokeis, and his Guebre-tribe, have for centuries&#xD;
believed to be the God of Fire and of Flame. The mystery&#xD;
of my being cannot yet be solved. I ,am not alone ! The&#xD;
mastery, over Matter and over Magi, is an inheritance of the&#xD;
ages. We who were once as others are, became doomed&#xD;
ones by reason of the curse of a dying man, and like Isaac&#xD;
Ahasuerus, the Hebrew of Jerusalem, who cursed and spat&#xD;
upon the Man of Sorrows when bearing his gibbet up the&#xD;
steep lane of the Dolorous Way, and whom the Meek one&#xD;
cursed, and bade tarry'on earth till he came-even so is he&#xD;
not alone. Powerful in all else, not one of us can read his&#xD;
own future ; but for that must depend on gifted ones like&#xD;
yonder Beverly. Such are seldom born ; but when they&#xD;
are, there is only one opportunity to make them subservient&#xD;
to our aid-they must be unwedded in soul, else they cannot&#xD;
enter the sleep of Sialam, and in no other way can the scroll&#xD;
of Fate be read for us. Hence the obstacles thrown in- his&#xD;
path and in that of yonder girl... It is possible to shift our&#xD;
fate upon the neutral, whoever he may be ; but in this case a&#xD;
strong motive existed to saddle the centuries upon yonder&#xD;
man, who has, in various forms, been my contemporary since&#xD;
ages previous to the laying of the foundations of Babylon&#xD;
and Nineveh.&#xD;

" There is one more in being-by him I have been foiled&#xD;
-the. Stranger-and still another-the mother of this Be-&#xD;
verly's body. I hoped to win him by Magic; I have failed. He&#xD;
has seen me thus, as I am,"-and so saying, Ravalette slowly&#xD;
moved around the screen, continuing to speak all the while,&#xD;
until he reappeared on the other corner-and saying, "and&#xD;
thus." We were astonished beyond measure at the change&#xD;
that had, in less than twelve seconds, taken place.&#xD;
Ravalette no longer stood before us, but instead, we saw&#xD;
a thin, lean, little, wrinkled old man, the perfect opposite in&#xD;
everything of the person we had just conversed with. " Mia-&#xD;
kus ! as I live-the man of Portland and of Boston-the&#xD;
same !" exclaimed Beverly, as the figure passed once more&#xD;
from view behind the screen, and almost instantly reappeared&#xD;
in a totally dissimilar guise. " And thus I" said the wizard.&#xD;
"My heaven !" said Beverly, " it is Ettelavar, my myste-&#xD;
rious. guide and teacher in the kingdom of Trance and&#xD;
Dream !"&#xD;
Again this strange being passed around the screen, saying,&#xD;
" and thus," as he reappeared successively as the Italian&#xD;
V Count and Vatterale. The wizard said, when in the last form,&#xD;
"Mai is but a transposition of I am ; 'Miakus' is 'Myself,'V&#xD;
Vatterale is a anagram of Ravalette, and a school-boy/&#xD;
would have told you that Ettelavar is but Ravalette reversed K&#xD;
-the name meaning 'The Mysterious.' To you, Beverly, I&#xD;
have been all these.  Behold me now as I really am," and&#xD;
he passed 'round the screen, and reappeared again as a little,&#xD;
withered old man, clothed in flaming red from head to heel.&#xD;
&#xD;
CLEARING UP.           237&#xD;

"The Vampire, Dhoula Bel !" shrieked both Beverly and&#xD;
Im Hokeis in the same breath.&#xD;

What passed during the nett half hour, it would not be&#xD;
proper for me here to relate. Suffice it, that at the end of&#xD;
that time Beverly had fallen asleep, apparently of his own free&#xD;
will. What followed will be seen in the next, and concluding&#xD;
chapter of this work.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
THE   SLEEP OF SIALAM.&#xD;
DEEP was the silence, hushed were our breaths. Quick&#xD;
beat our hearts, tearful were our eyes, for a greater than&#xD;
even Death was in that room on the Boulevart de Lux-&#xD;
embourg !&#xD;
Seated in a large office-chair, his limbs stiff and cold with&#xD;
the damps of dissolution ; his face paler than the Genius of&#xD;
Consumption ; his heart and pulses totally moveless ; his&#xD;
eyes wide open, and so upturned that not a speck of aught&#xD;
but the uncolored portions thereof were visible, was my friend.&#xD;
In previous years I had often seen him and hundreds of&#xD;
others in both the mesmeric and' odyllic trance-the latter&#xD;
being the very common semi-comatic state into which sensi-&#xD;
tive persons often pass by the merest effort of volition, and&#xD;
in which they give off such high-sounding platitudes and call&#xD;
them philosophy transmitted direct from spirit-land to erring&#xD;
mortals, when the fact is, that the whole phenomena-when&#xD;
not simulated, which is not the case in over nine hundred and&#xD;
ninety cases in each thousand of its display-is but the con- .&#xD;
current action of a diseased body and an abnormal, unhealthy&#xD;
mind, and in many cases morals also, for it makes no matter&#xD;
how good or well-intentioned the subjects may be in the&#xD;

start, they are sure to yield before the accursed blast, and&#xD;
only the fires of hell itself can stop their mad career and turn&#xD;
them back to normal paths.&#xD;
Not such a trance was that we. now were witnessing. In&#xD;
the course of five minutes there came a change in the sleep-&#xD;
er's face, which became lighted up as if at that moment his&#xD;
soul beheld the ineffable glories of the great Beyond.&#xD;
He spoke : " Now 1"&#xD;
As this one word escaped his lips, the door of the room&#xD;
was silently opened, and two men entered and were about&#xD;
taking seats, when the Commissary of Police suddenly rose,&#xD;
made a low obeisance, saluted one of them in military style,&#xD;
and exclaimed, " The Emp-    "&#xD;
"Silence I" said the person addressed ; " all are strangers&#xD;
here !" And then turning to Dhoula Bel, with whom he&#xD;
appeared quite familiar, this person said to him, " At last ?"&#xD;
"At last !" echoed the latter ; whereupon the two new&#xD;
comers helped themselves to seats.&#xD;
The whole affair had gone thus far so directly opposite to&#xD;
all my calculations ; events had taken such sudden and totally&#xD;
unexpected turns, that I ceased to marvel at this new game&#xD;
of cross-purposes, but determined to watch the results' care-.&#xD;
fully, whatever they might be. Of course I expected that&#xD;
the new comer would now take the lead of affairs.. But no ;&#xD;
for Dhoula Bel, as I shall henceforth call him, addressed&#xD;
the shorter of the.two intruders as follows:&#xD;
StWhy do you, too, seek to thwart me ?  Many years ago&#xD;

you had been consigned because you had failed on two occa,&#xD;
sions. I rescued you, gave you liberty, influence, power,&#xD;
prestige, and seated you firmly on the proudest throne on&#xD;
earth ; I have made you famed and feared ; I have humbled&#xD;
Britain in your name ; for you I have broken the power of&#xD;
ages-the Papacy ; for you I have severed Austria, and&#xD;
built a new empire on the earth. For you I have fomented&#xD;
the most awful war the world has ever seen, and have divided&#xD;
a nation of brothers into two parties, each thirsting for the&#xD;
other's blood ; and while you have been the silent automaton,&#xD;
I have prompted your speech and moved the wires that&#xD;
govern' the world, asking nothing whatever in return, and&#xD;
yet you are here to thwart me who have ever been your&#xD;
friend. Why is this ?"&#xD;
"I admit-nothing. I am a man of Destiny !"&#xD;
" Shall I reveal it ?"&#xD;
" I care not."&#xD;
" Well, I forbear ; but let this sleeper tell it."&#xD;
"I am content. Interrogate him. This is the hour, and&#xD;
this the scene for which I long have waited. Let the oracle&#xD;
speak."&#xD;
"Listen-to me," said the taller of the two intruders. "Ye&#xD;
have both been proxies of a power beyond us all ; and even&#xD;
as I, the Stranger, have foiled each of ye, yet my action&#xD;
was decreed. The drama of ages may end to day. Not&#xD;
one of us can read his own future ; there is but one on earth&#xD;
who can read it, and there is but one hour in which it may&#xD;
be done. That person is here ; that hour has come. Not&#xD;

&#xD;
with the magnetic afflatus of puling, babbling somnambules ;&#xD;
not with the boastful confidence of self-styled explorers of&#xD;
mythical Summer Lands, or imaginary spheres ; but with a&#xD;
vision, simple, pure and accurate, shall yonder sleeper sweep&#xD;
the horizon of the future, and reveal it. Therefore let there&#xD;
be quietude and peace, while the mystic scroll is being&#xD;
read."&#xD;
Then turning to the slumberer, he said : ",What seest&#xD;
thou, 0 Soul ? Look ! investigate ! reveal ! What seest&#xD;
thou concerning France and her ruler ?"&#xD;
" France will experience another Revolution. It will be-&#xD;
gin in Water and end in Blood and Fire ! but the end will&#xD;
be delayed. Crown, Sceptre, Dynasty-all are swept away&#xD;
before the resistless tide of Political Reformation, and the&#xD;
last noble and priest shares the fate of the last crowned head&#xD;

" What of the other Nationalities ?"&#xD;
" Prussia, under a new rigime, becomes indeed a Father-&#xD;
land to her people ; Belgium, Holland, and other of the&#xD;
Germanic lands, become consolidated with empires now&#xD;
existing; Spain's night draws near-her colonies, erected&#xD;

As the sleeping man gave utterance to these inspired&#xD;
prophesies, the less tall of the two strangers appeared dis-&#xD;
turbed, and almost rising to his feet with excitement, he said-&#xD;
"Then this man's career will resemble my own ?"&#xD;
" As fire resembles ice. This man's career will be peace-&#xD;
ful ; his path will not be stained by one single drop of blood.&#xD;
No maimed men will curse, no widows weep, no orphans cry&#xD;

" But I am strong !-Mexico !-Empire !-The Latin&#xD;
race !-The Church !-Maximilian! What can break this&#xD;
chain, supposing I establish the last link, as I intend to ?"&#xD;
"Fate ! The United States will, in that case, soon find&#xD;
time to breathe upon France and the New Empire ! That&#xD;
breath will settle as a cloud, but, when it rises, two dynasties&#xD;
will have disappeared forever !"&#xD;

prophesying the fate and destinies of Empires.&#xD;
For a moment there was silence. At length Ravalette&#xD;
spoke-&#xD;
"And now my turn. What, 0 sleeper ! what of me ?"&#xD;
The seer smiled blandly, stretched forth his hands toward&#xD;
both the tall personage and the Enigma. They went forward,&#xD;
grasped the sleeper's hands in their own, and-&#xD;
"The Enmity of Ages is ended 1"&#xD;
"It is ended !" repeated the tall one.&#xD;
" It is finished  Thy work is done-and mine-and&#xD;
thine "-indicating Ravalette-said the seer.   "Hence-&#xD;
forward, there is rest for the weary-there is rest for thee!1&#xD;
No longer doomed to walk the earth,.we three quit it. Our&#xD;
paths diverge frdm this moment. Above our heads is a scroll,&#xD;
on which is written-&#xD;
'YE MAY BE HAPPY YET 1&#xD;
"Thank Heaven 1" said Dhoula Bel.&#xD;
"Thank Heaven 1" repeated the Stranger.&#xD;
"It is finished !" said Beverly, and, as he spoke, Dhoula&#xD;
Bel moved behind the screen, and, the very instant that he&#xD;
did so, there came the sharp crack of fire-arms in the ha,11and&#xD;
on the stairs, accompanied with any amount of oaths uttered&#xD;
in not very choice French.&#xD;
Immediately, running to the door along with the Commissary&#xD;

Muse of the disturbance.&#xD;
"By the Holy Evangelists ! I fired straight into his head,&#xD;
and it didn't faze him an inch !" said the sergeant.&#xD;
"'And I struck him square in the middle of the head, and&#xD;
that didn't harm him in the least !" said another.&#xD;
" And I put two Derringer bullets anti four Colt's fair into&#xD;
his breast, at ten inches, and blast me if all six didn't fly&#xD;

" And I'll swear that he didn't come through the open&#xD;

" It was the devil I" said a fifth.&#xD;
" Or his imp !" said the sixth.&#xD;

Come hither into the room and tell us what you are&#xD;

" I'm  driving at nothing just now," said the sergeant,&#xD;
as he came in " but I have been trying to drive somerbullets&#xD;

said he, and he marched straight for the stairs, and four o&#xD;
us undertook to clinch him, and did so. Gentlemen, have&#xD;
you ever picked p a hot potatoe? Well, I have, and did&#xD;
not let it drop quicker than we four let go of that individual l&#xD;
only that instead of burning us, it felt for all the world like&#xD;
one feels at the Polytechnic when he takes hold of those in-&#xD;
fernal things with wires to them, and which discharge a&#xD;
quart or two of lightning into you before you can say-Jack&#xD;
Robinson ! We let go of the gentleman very quickly, and&#xD;
he passed two or three steps downward, all the while.latugh-&#xD;
ing at us, which made me furious, and I fired point-blank at&#xD;
him, and we all attempted to cut him down, but you nght&#xD;
just as well have tried to kill a shadow. Messieurs, that&#xD;
man disappeared in the smoke of our pistols i He never-&#xD;
passed out in visible form I"&#xD;

" As certain as I am that he is not now in this room.&#xD;
"Which shows how easily people may be deceived," said&#xD;
a voice from behind the screen and instantlyy thereafter&#xD;

My hair stood up with fright and horror ; not so the seven&#xD;

the screen, exclaiming: "But we have you now, man or&#xD;

There was no one whatever behind it.&#xD;
The sergeant fell as if he had been shot.&#xD;
Determined to preserve myself from surprise, I steadily&#xD;
kept my seat and watched the Stranger and his companion.'&#xD;
The latter rose from his chair, advanced toward Hokeis and&#xD;
his daughter, who had both sat silent and spell-bound dur-&#xD;
ing the whole of this extraordinary scene of diablerie, and&#xD;
spoke a few words in a low tone to them.&#xD;
While this was going on, the tall Stranger passed into the&#xD;

followed, but he too had disappeared&#xD;

THE MAN.&#xD;
HE used to pace rapidly up and down the deck for a&#xD;
minute or two, and then, suddenly striking his forehead, as if&#xD;
a new thought were just pangfully coming into being at the&#xD;
major foci of his soul, he would throw himself prone upon&#xD;
one of the after seats of the old " Uncle Sam," the steamer in&#xD;
which we were going from San Francisco to Panama, and&#xD;
there he would lie, apparently musing, and evidently enjoying&#xD;
some sort of interior life, but whether that life was one of&#xD;
reverie, dream, or disembodiedness, was a mystery'to us 4ll,&#xD;
and would have remained so, but that on being asked, he very&#xD;
complaisantly satisfied our donibts, by informing us that on&#xD;
such occasion he, in spirit, visited a place not laid down in&#xD;
ordinary charts, and the name of which was the realm of&#xD;
" Wotchergifterno," which means in English, "Violinist's&#xD;
Meadow" (very like " Fiddler's Green"). When not pacing&#xD;
the deck, or reclining, or gazing at the glorious sunsets'on&#xD;

tains, he was in the habit of---catching flies; which flies he&#xD;
would forthwith proceed to dissect and examine by means of&#xD;
a microscope constructed of a drop of water in a bent broom&#xD;
wisp. Giadually the man became quite &amp;amp; favorite. itly both&#xD;
passengers and officers of the ship, and not a day passed but&#xD;
a crowd of ladies and gentlemen would gather around him to&#xD;
listen to the stories he would not merely recite, but cotnpose&#xD;
as he went along, each one containing a moral of more than&#xD;
ordinary significance. It was apparent from the first that&#xD;
the man was some sort of a mystic, a dreamer, or some such&#xD;
out-of-the-ordinary style of person, because everything he&#xD;
said or did bore an unmistakable ghostly impress. lie was&#xD;
sorrowful withal, at times, and yet no.one on the ship had a&#xD;
greater or more humorous flow of spirits. In the midst,&#xD;
however, of his brightest sallies, he would suddenly stop short,&#xD;
as if at that moment his listening soul had caught the jubi-&#xD;
lant cry of angels when God had just pardoned some sinful,&#xD;
stornm-tossed human soul.&#xD;
One day, during the progress of a long and interesting&#xD;
conversation on the nature of that mysterious thing called&#xD;
the human soul, and in which our fellow passenger had, as&#xD;
usual, taken a leading part, with the endeavor to elicit, as.&#xD;
well as impart, information, he suddenly .changed color,&#xD;
turned almost deathly pale, and for full five minutes, perhaps&#xD;
more, looked straight into the sky, as if gazing upon the aw-&#xD;
ful and ine1able mysteries of that weird IFhantem-land which&#xD;
intuition demonstrates, but cold reason utterly rejects or&#xD;
challenges for; tangible proof. .Long, and steadily gazed the&#xD;

nman ; and then he shuddered--shuddered as if hebd just&#xD;
received some fearful, solution of the problem near his heart.&#xD;
And I shuddered also-in pure sympathy with what I e nld&#xD;
not fairly understand. At length he spoke; but with. hated&#xD;
breath, and in tones so low, so deep, so solemn, that it seem-&#xD;
ed as though a dead, and. not a living man, gave, utterance&#xD;
to the sounds : " Lara ! Lara I Ah, Lovely I would that. I&#xD;
had gone then--that I were with thee now I" and he relapsed&#xD;
into silence.&#xD;
Surprised, both at his abruptness, change; of manner- and&#xD;
theme--for ten minutes before, and despite the solemnity of&#xD;
the conversational topic, he had been at a fever-heat of fun&#xD;
and hilarity-I asked him what he meant. . Accustomed, as&#xD;
we had been, to hear him break in upon the most grave:.and&#xD;
dolorous-talk with a droll observation which instantly ,pro-&#xD;
roked: the most unrestrainable, hilarious mirth ; used, as we&#xD;
had been to hear him perpetrate a 'joke, and set us all in *&#xD;
roar in the very midst of some heart-moving tale of woe,&#xD;
whereat our eyes had moistened, and our pulses throbbed&#xD;
tumultuously, yet I was not, even by all this, prepared for&#xD;
the singular characteristic now presented. In reply to ;my&#xD;
question, he first wiped away an involuntary tear, a.s if&#xD;
ashamed of his weakness ; then raised his head, and ex-&#xD;
claimed:&#xD;
"Lara I Lara ! The Beautiful One I"&#xD;
"-';What of her ?" asked Colbert, who, sat opposite hiaand&#xD;
iwho was deeply moved .at his evident distress, and whose&#xD;
curiosity, as that ofxus all, wag deeply piqued.&#xD;

"Listen," said he, " and I will tell you ;" and then, while&#xD;
we eagerly drank in his words, and strove to' drink in their&#xD;
strange and wondrous meaning (first warning us that what&#xD;
he was about to say was but the text of something to be&#xD;
thereafter told), he leaned back upon the taifrail, and while&#xD;
the steamer gently plowed her way toward Acapulco and&#xD;
far-off Panama, said :&#xD;
"Fleshless, yet living, I strode through the grand old hall,&#xD;
of a mighty temple. I had been compelled to climb the hills&#xD;
to reach the wall that bars the Gates of Glory, and now&#xD;
within my heart strange pulses beat the while. I found my-&#xD;
self upon the verge of a vast extended plain, stretching out&#xD;
to the Infinitudes, as it seemed, through the narrow spaces&#xD;
wherein the vision was not obstructed by certain dense, con-&#xD;
volving vapor-clouds that ever and anon rose from off the&#xD;
murky breast of the waters of the river of Lethe, that rolled&#xD;
hard by and skirted the immense prairie on and over which I&#xD;
proposed to travel, on my way from Minus to Plus--from No.&#xD;
thing to Something, from Bad to Good, and from Better to.&#xD;
BEST-travelling toward my unknown, unimagined Destiny&#xD;
-travelling from the Now toward the Shall Be. And I&#xD;
stood and mutely gazed-gazed at the dense, dark shadows&#xD;
rolling murkily, massily over the plain and through the spaces&#xD;
-dim shadows of dead worlds. No sound, no footfall, not&#xD;
even mine own-not an. echo broke the Stillness. I was&#xD;
alone 1!-alone upon the vast Solitude-the tremendous wastes&#xD;
of an unknown, mysterious, unimagined Eterne--unimagined&#xD;

heart, but no pulse went from it bounding through my veins ;&#xD;
no throb beat back responsive life to my feeling, listening&#xD;
spirit. I and my Soul were there alone ; we only-the&#xD;
Thinking self, and the Self that ever knows, but never thinks&#xD;
--were there. My heart was not cold, yet it was more : it&#xD;
was, I felt, changed to solid stone-changed all save one&#xD;
small point,. distant, afar off, like unto the vague ghost&#xD;
of a long-forgotten fancy ; and this seemed to have been&#xD;
the penalty inflicted for things done by me. while on the&#xD;
earth ; for it appeared that I was dead, and that my soul&#xD;
had begun an almost endless pilgrimage-to what ?-to&#xD;
where ?  A penalty ! And yet no black memory of red-&#xD;
handed crime haunted me, or lurked in the intricacies of the&#xD;
mystic wards of my death-defying soul ; and I strode all&#xD;
alone adown the uncolumned vistas of the grand old temple&#xD;
-a temple whose walls were builded of flown Seconds, whose&#xD;
tesselated pavements were laid in sheeted Hours, whose win-&#xD;
dows on one side opened upon the Gone Ages, and on the&#xD;
other upon the Yet to Be ; and its sublime turrets pierced&#xD;
the clouds, which roll over and mantle the hoary summits of&#xD;
the grey Mountains of Time 1 And so I and my Soul walked&#xD;
through this temple by ourselves-alone,!&#xD;
"With clear, keen gaze, I looked forth upon the Vastness,&#xD;
and my vision swept over the floors of all the dead years ;&#xD;
yet in vain, for the things of my longing were not there. I -&#xD;
beheld trees, but all their leaves were motionless, and no carol-&#xD;
ing bird sent its he'art-notes forth to waken the dim solitudes&#xD;
into life and music-which are. love. There were stately&#xD;

groves beneath the arching span of the temple's massy dome,&#xD;
but no amphian strains of melody fell on the ear, or filled the&#xD;
spaces,,from their myriad moveless branches, or from out their&#xD;
fair theatres. All was still. It was a palace of frozen tones,&#xD;
and only the music of Silence (which is vocal, if we listen&#xD;
well) prevailed ; and I, Paschal the Thinker, and my Thought&#xD;
-strange, uncouth, yet mighty but moveless thought-were&#xD;
the only living things beneath the expansive dome. Living,&#xD;
I had sacrificed all things--health, riches, honor, fame, ease,&#xD;
even Love itself, for Thought, and by Thought had overtopped&#xD;
many who had started on the race for glory long ere my soul&#xD;
had wakened to a consciousness of itself--which means Power.&#xD;
In life I had, so it seemed, builded stronger than I thought,&#xD;
and had reached a mental eminence-occupied a throne. so&#xD;
lofty-that mankind wondered, stood aloof, and gazed at me&#xD;
from afar off; and by reason of my thought had gathered&#xD;
from me, and thus condemned the Thinker to an utter soli-&#xD;
tude, even in the most thronged and busy haunts of men;,&#xD;
and I walked through earth's most crowded cities more lonely&#xD;
than the hermit of the desert, whose eyes are never gladdened&#xD;
by the sight of human form, and through the chambers of&#xD;
whose brain no human- voice goes ringing. Thus was it on&#xD;
earth ; and now that I had quitted it forever, with undaunted&#xD;
soul, strong purpose, and fearless tread, assured of an endless&#xD;
immortality, and had entered upon the life of Thinking, still&#xD;
was I alone. Had my life, my thinking, and my action on&#xD;
thought been failures? The contemplation of such a possi-&#xD;
bility was bitter, very bitter-:--even like unto painful death--&#xD;
&#xD;
and yet it seemed true that failure had been mine--failure,&#xD;
notwithstanding men by thousands spoke well of me and of&#xD;
my works-the children of my thought-and bought my&#xD;
books in thousands. Failure ?  My soul rejected the idea in&#xD;
utter loathing. For a moment the social spirit, the heart-&#xD;
ness of my nature -over-shadowed Reason, and caused me to&#xD;
forget that, even though confined by dungeon walls, stricken&#xD;
with poverty, deformity, sin or disease-even though left out&#xD;
to freeze in the-cold world's spite-yet the thinker is ever the&#xD;
world's true- and only King. I .had become, for a moment,&#xD;
oblivious of the fact that failure was an impossibility. Rosi-&#xD;
crucians never fail!&#xD;
" But now, as I slowly moved along, I felt my human&#xD;
nature was at war with the God-nature within, and that Heart&#xD;
for :a while was holding the Head in duress. I longed for re-&#xD;
lease from Solitude; my humanity yearned for association,&#xD;
and would have there, on the breast of the great Eterne; given&#xD;
worlds for the company of the lowliest soul I had ever beheld--&#xD;
and despised, as I walked the streets of the cities of the far-off&#xD;
earth. I yearned for human society and -afection, and could&#xD;
even have found blissful solace with-a dogi just such a dog as,&#xD;
in times past, I had scornfully kicked in Cafro axnd Stambol-&#xD;
Even a dog was denied me now-all affection withheld from&#xD;
me--and in the terrible presence of its absence I longed for&#xD;
death, forgetting again that Soul can never die. I longd&#xD;
for that deeper extinguishment which should sweep the soul&#xD;
from being, and crown it with limitleseeternal Night-=oi-&#xD;

the rememberer cease to be, and that hence Horrors would&#xD;
echo through the universe--children mourning for their sui-&#xD;
cidal parent, and that parent myself !  -&#xD;
" And I lay me down beneath a tree in despair.-a tree&#xD;
which stood out all alone from its fellows. in a grove hard by&#xD;
--a tree all ragged and lightning-scathed--an awful monu-&#xD;
ment, mute, yet eloquently proclaiming to the wondering on-&#xD;
looker that God had passed that way, in fierce, deific wrath,&#xD;
once upon a time, in the dead ages, whose ashes now bestrewed&#xD;
the floors of the mighty temple of Eterne.&#xD;
"It was dreadful, very dreadful, to be all alone. True, the&#xD;
pangs of hunger, the tortures of thirst, the fires of ambition,&#xD;
and the raging flames of earthly passion no longer marred my&#xD;
peace. Pain, such as mortals feel, was unknown ; no disease&#xD;
racked my frame, or disturbed the serenity of my external&#xD;
being-for I was immortal, and could laugh all these and&#xD;
Death itself to scorn ; and yeta keener anguish, a more fear-&#xD;
ful suffering, was mine. I wept, and my cries gave back no&#xD;
outer sound, but they rang in sombre echoes through the&#xD;
mighty arches, the bottomless caverns, the abyssmal deeps of&#xD;
Soul-my soul-racking it with torments such as only think-&#xD;
ing things can feel. Such is the lot, such the discipline of&#xD;
the destined citizens of the Farther Empyrean-a region&#xD;
known only to the Brethren of the Temple of Peerless&#xD;

dreamed. Methought I still wandered gloomily beneath the&#xD;
vast arches of the grand old hall, until at last, after countless&#xD;
cycles of ripe years had been gathered back into the treasury&#xD;
of the .Etre Supreme, I stood before a solid, massive door,&#xD;
which an inscription thereabove announced as being the en-&#xD;
trance to the Garden of the Beatitudes. This door was&#xD;
secured by a thousand locks, besides one larger'than all the&#xD;
rest combined. Every one of these locks might be opened,&#xD;
but the opener could not pass through unless he unfastened&#xD;
the master-lock having ten thousand bolts and wards.&#xD;
"Once more despair seized on my soul, in this dream which&#xD;
was not all a dream ; for to achieve an entrance through the&#xD;
gate without the master-key was a task, so said the inscrip-&#xD;
tion, that would defy the labors of human armies for periods&#xD;
of time utterly defying man's comprehension-so many were&#xD;
the difficulties, so vastly strong the bolts.&#xD;
"Sadly, mournfully, I turned away, when, as if by chance&#xD;
-forgetting that there is no such thing as Chance-my eye&#xD;
encountered a rivetless space upon the solid brazen door-a&#xD;
circular 'space, around the periphery of which was an inscrip-&#xD;
tion running thus : ' MAN ONLY FAILS THROUGH FEEBLE-&#xD;
NESS OF WILL 1' Within this smooth circle was the&#xD;
semblance of a golden triangle, embracing a crystalline&#xD;
globe, winged and beautiful, crowned with a Rosicrucian&#xD;
cypher, while beneath it stood out, in fiery characters, the&#xD;

THE SECRET OF GREATNESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM.&#xD;
" What a change ! During my slumber it seemed that I&#xD;
had been transported to the summit of a very lofty ujountain,&#xD;
yet still within the Temple. By my side stood an Iged and&#xD;
saintly man, of regal and majestic presence. He was clad in&#xD;
an oriental garb of the long-gone ages, and his flowing robes&#xD;
were bound to his waist by a golden band, wrought into the&#xD;
similitude of a shining serpent-the sacred emblem of eternal&#xD;
wisdom. Around his broad and lofty brow was a coronet&#xD;
of silver, dusted with spicule of finest diamond.    On the&#xD;
sides of the centre were two scarabei, the symbol of immor-&#xD;
tality ; and between them was a pyramid, on which was in-&#xD;
scribed a mystical character which told, at the same time,&#xD;
that his name was Ram us the Great.*&#xD;
3'This royal personage spake kindly to me, and his soft&#xD;
tones fell upon the hearing of my soul like the words of par-&#xD;
don to the sense of sinners at the Judgment Seat.    'Look,&#xD;
my son,' said he, at the same time pointing toward a vast&#xD;
procession of .he newly-risen dead-a spectral army on the&#xD;
sides of the mountain, slowly, steadily, mournfully wending&#xD;
their way toward the part of the temple I had quitted pre-&#xD;
vious to the commencement of this dream within a dream.&#xD;
Said the man at my side: 'Yonder host of pilgrims are&#xD;
* The same known historically as Thothmes, or Thotmor the Third, King of all&#xD;
Egypt, in the 18th dynasty, and sixty-ninth Chief or Grand Master of the Superla-&#xD;
tive Order ofGebel Al Maruk-since known, in Christian lands, as the Order of the&#xD;
Brethren of the Rosie Cross, and now known in America and Europe, where it still&#xD;
thrives, as the Imperial Order of Rosicrucia.&#xD;

men and women who are seeking, as thou hast sought, to&#xD;
unbar the Gates of Glory, that they may pass through them&#xD;
into the delightful Garden of the Beatitudes. It is one&#xD;
thing to be endowed with Intellectual Strength, Knowledge&#xD;
and Immortality ; it is another to be Wise and Happy. The&#xD;
first is a boon granted to all the children of earth alike ; the'&#xD;
last can only be attained by integral development-by self-&#xD;
endeavor, by innate goodness and God-ness continually man-&#xD;
ifested-and this in material and aromal worlds alike. Man&#xD;
is man and woman is woman, wherever they may be ! The&#xD;
true way to the garden lies not through Manifestation Cor-&#xD;
ridor, but through the Hall of Silence ! and each Aspirant&#xD;
must open the door for himself alone. Failing to enter, as&#xD;
thou hast failed, each must turn back, and, like thee, come&#xD;
hither to Mount Retrospect, and entering into the labyrinths&#xD;
within its sides, must search for the triple key, which alone&#xD;
can unbar the Gate, and admit to the Beautiful Garden I&#xD;
Remember ! Despair not ! Try!I' and in an instant the&#xD;
Phantom-man turned from me, and with outstretched arms,&#xD;
and benignance beaming from every feature, hied him toward&#xD;
the ascending army.&#xD;
"Again I stood alone, not now in despondency and&#xD;
gloom, but in all the serene strength of noble," conscious&#xD;
Manhood-not the. actual, but the certain and glorious pos-&#xD;
sibility thereof. My soul had grown. It was aware of all&#xD;
its past short-comings, failures, and its hatreds toward two&#xD;
men who had done me deadly wrong. This feeling still sur-&#xD;
vived-stronger than ever, now that I was across the Bridge&#xD;

of Hours, and had become a citizen of the inner land-a&#xD;
wanderer through Eternity. That hate was as immortal as&#xD;
my deathless soul. Will it ever be ?  And yet I had ever&#xD;
meant well. All was calm in my spirit, save this single aw-&#xD;
ful thing. In this spirit, with this consciousness-not of&#xD;
deep malignance, but of outraged Justice-I began to look&#xD;
for the mysterious key ; and as I looked, an instinct-told me&#xD;
that the key must consist of certain grand human virtues,&#xD;
and corresponding good deeds, held and done before I left&#xD;
the shores of time and embarked upon the strange and mys-&#xD;
tic sea whereon my soul's fortunes were now cast.&#xD;
" And so I searched, and at last seemed to have found&#xD;
what I sought ; and thereupon I wished myself once more&#xD;
before the brazen Gate. Instantly, as if by magic, the wish&#xD;
was realized, and I~ stood before .it, on the same spot for-&#xD;
merly occupied. The first inscription, the symbols and circle&#xD;
had disappeared, and in their stead was another circle, con-&#xD;
taining these lines : 'Speak, for thou shalt ,be heard ! Tell&#xD;
what thou hast done to elevate thy fellow men, and to round&#xD;
out the angles of thine own soul. Whom hast thou up-&#xD;
lifted, loved, hated? Speak, and when the words containing&#xD;
the key are spoken, the door will yield, and thou mayest pass&#xD;
the Threshold.'-&#xD;
" The writing slowly faded, and left naught but a surface,&#xD;
but that surface as of molten gold. I spoke aloud my claim&#xD;
to entrance, and, to my astonishment,' my voice rang out&#xD;
shrill and clear, through the vaults and arches of the mighty&#xD;
dome towering far above my head. 'I have suffered from&#xD;
&#xD;
" TRY !"&#xD;

infancy-been opposed from the cradle to maturity-been&#xD;
hated, robbed, slandered on all sides, yet pushed forward in&#xD;
defiance of all, until I reached all that I desired-all that&#xD;
earth could give me. Self-educated, I achieved. triumphs&#xD;
where others failed ; have reaped laurels and grasped the&#xD;
keys of fame, and laughed at my folly afterwards, because&#xD;
what is fame ? A canker, gnawing out one's life when liiing,&#xD;
disturbing his repose when dead-not worth a straw! lBut,&#xD;
in all this, despite the ending, I have set an example, by fol-&#xD;
lowing which man might elevate himself, society be improved,&#xD;
and its constituents realize the bliss of moving in loftier&#xD;
spheres  f usefulness!' While giving voice to these truths, I&#xD;
firmly expected to see the gate fly open at their conclusion.&#xD;
But what was my horror and dismay to see that it moved not&#xD;
at all, while the echoes of my speech gave back in frightfully&#xD;
resonant waves of sound the last word, 'USEFULNESS!'&#xD;
"Not being able to think of any nobler achievements, I&#xD;
cast my eyes groundward, and, on again raising them, I be.&#xD;
held, across the clear space on the door, the single word,&#xD;
" Taking heart again, I said, 'Alone I sought the secret&#xD;
of restoring health to the sick, and gave it freely to the world,&#xD;
without money, without price. I have made grand efforts to&#xD;
banish sloth, sin, ignorance; have ever upheld the honor of&#xD;
the Cross, and the sweet religion it symbolizes. Striving ever&#xD;
to upraise the veil that hides man from himself, in the effort&#xD;
I have been misapprehended, my motives impugned, and my&#xD;
reward has been poverty, slander, disgrace. In the strife, I&#xD;

remain-but a single instant longer.. But she was gone. I&#xD;

Thus spake the Rosicrucian. We were all deeply moved&#xD;
at the recital, and one after the other we retired to our&#xD;
rooms, pondering on the story and its splendid moral. Next&#xD;
day we reached Acapulco, and not till we had left and were&#xD;
far on our way toward Panama, did we have an opportunity&#xD;

a premature grave by a vixen-she might have added, truth-&#xD;
fully, but did not, finishing the sentence with, 'to be loved&#xD;
by a tender, gentle wife'--like her ! The lady had gotten&#xD;
bravely over all her amiable weaknesses long ago. Gentle 1&#xD;
what are tigresses ? Tender I what is a virago ? So far the&#xD;
man. Now for his mate.&#xD;
"Scarcely had her lord-' Mr. Thomas W.,' as she was&#xD;
wont to call him-gone out of the house, and slammed the&#xD;
door behind him, at the same time giving vent to the last&#xD;
bottleful of spleen distilled and concocted in his soul, than&#xD;
'Mrs. Thomas W.,' or poor Betsey Clark, as I prefer to call&#xD;
her-for she was truly, really pitiable, for more reasons than&#xD;
one, but mainly because she had common sense and would&#xD;
not exercise it sufficiently to make the best of a bad bargain&#xD;
--threw herself upon the bed, where she cried a little, and&#xD;
raved a good deal, to the self-same tune as of yore.. Getting&#xD;
tired of both these delightful occupations very soon, she va-&#xD;
ried them by striking an attitude before a portrait of the dear&#xD;
defunct--badly executed--the portrait, not the man--whose&#xD;
name she bore when she became Mistress Thomas W. This&#xD;
picture of a former husband Tom Clark had not had courage&#xD;
or sense enough to put his foot through, but did have bad&#xD;
taste sufficient to permit to hang up in the very room where&#xD;
he lived and ate, and where its beauties were duly and daily&#xD;
expatiated upon, and the virtues of its original lauded to the,&#xD;
skies, of course to the intense delight of Mr. Clark.&#xD;

back-spring and double-actioned tongue, and, what is more,&#xD;
knew well how to use it when the fit was on, which, to do&#xD;
her justice, was not more than twenty-three hours and a half&#xD;
each day. Never did an opportunity offer that she did not&#xD;
avail herself of to amplify the merits. of the" deceased, espe-&#xD;
cially in presence of such visitors as chance or business&#xD;
brought to their house, all to the especial delectation of her&#xD;
living spouse, Mr. Thomas W. Clark.&#xD;
"Just look at her now ! There she is, kneeling at her&#xD;
shrine, my lady gay, vehemently pouring forth the recital of&#xD;
her wrongs--forgetful of any one else's, as usual with the&#xD;
genus grumbler-dropping tears and maledictions, now on&#xD;
her own folly, then on the devoted head of him she had pro-&#xD;
mised to love, honor, and obey, Mr. Clark, fruit-grower, far-&#xD;
mer, and horse-dealer. Exhausted at length, she winds up&#xD;
the dramatic scene by invoking all the blessings of all the&#xD;
saints in all the calendars on the soul of him whose counter-&#xD;
feit presentment hangs there upon the wall.&#xD;
"If this couple did not absolutely hate each other, they&#xD;
came so near it that a Philadelphia lawyer would have been&#xD;
puzzled to tell t'other from which, and yet nobody but them-&#xD;
selves had the least idea of the real state of things-those&#xD;
under-currents of married life that only occasionally breach&#xD;
through and extensively display themselves in the presence&#xD;
of third parties. In the very nature of the case, how absurd&#xD;
it is for outsiders to presume to know the real status of&#xD;
affairs--to comprehend the actual facts which exist behind&#xD;
the curtains of every or any married couple in the land.&#xD;

"Tom and his wife-the latter, especially-pretended to a&#xD;
vast deal of loving-kindness-oh, how great-toward each&#xD;
other--and they were wise-in the presence of other people.&#xD;
You would have thought, had you seen them billing and&#xD;
cooing like a pair of 'Turkle Doves'-to quote the 'Bard&#xD;
?" of Baldwinsville'--that there never was so true, so perfect a&#xD;
union as their own ; and would not have entertained the&#xD;
shadow of a doubt but that they had been expressly formed&#xD;
for each other from the foundations of the world, if not be-&#xD;
fore. No sooner did they meet--before folks, even after the&#xD;
most trifling absence-than they mutually fell to kissing and&#xD;
'dearing,' like two swains just mated, all of which made&#xD;
fools wonder, but wise people to grieve. Physical manifesta-&#xD;
tions are not quite Love's methods ; and it is a safe rule that&#xD;
those who most ape love externally, have less of it within--&#xD;
and in private, so great a difference is there between Behind&#xD;
and Before, in these matters of the heart. Billing and cool-&#xD;
ing before folks acts as a nauseant upon sensible men and&#xD;
women, and in this case it did upon a few of the better&#xD;
class of the city of Santa Blarneeo, within a few miles of&#xD;
which Clark lived.&#xD;
"Betsey Clark. gave a last, long, lingering look at the por-&#xD;
trait, saying: the while: 'Don't I wish you were alive and&#xD;
back here again, my love, my darling, my precious duck?&#xD;
Lucky for him was It that such could not be ; for had it been&#xD;

THE WATCHFUL ANGEL.&#xD;

&#xD;
possible, and actualized, he would have been finely plucked,&#xD;
not to say roasted, stewed, perpetually broiled, and in every&#xD;
way done brown. 'If you were here, I should be happy,&#xD;
because you was a man ; but this one (meaning Tom), bah!'&#xD;
and the lady bounced upon her feet and kicked'the cat by&#xD;
way of emphasis. She resumed : 'I can't stand it, and I&#xD;
won't, there! that's flat ! I'm still young, and people of sense&#xD;
tell me I am handsome-at least, good-looking. I'm certain&#xD;
the glass does, and no doubt there are plenty who would&#xD;
gladly link their lot with mine if he was only dead!' And&#xD;
she shuddere as the fearful thought had birth. 'Dead ! I&#xD;
wish he was ; and true as I live, I've a great good mind to&#xD;
accomplish my wish !' And again she shuddered.   Poor&#xD;
woman, she was indeed tempted of the devil ! As the hor-&#xD;
rible suggestion flashed across the sea of her soul, it illumin'&#xD;
ed many a deep chasmal abyss, of whose existence, up to&#xD;
that moment she had been utterly unaware.&#xD;
"The human soul is a fearful thing, especially when it&#xD;
stands bare before the Eternal Eye, with myriad snake-&#xD;
forms--its own abnormal creation, writhing round and near&#xD;
it. A fearful thing ! And Betsey Clark trembled in the&#xD;
ghastly presence of Uncommitted Murder, whose glance of&#xD;
lurid flame set fire to her heart, and scorched and seared it&#xD;
with consuming heat.  Its flashful light lasted but for a mo-&#xD;
ment ; but even that was a world too long, for it illumined&#xD;
all the dark caverns of her soul, and disclosed to the horri-&#xD;
fled gaze of an aerial being which that instant chanced&#xD;
to pass that way-an abyssmal deep of Crime-possibility,&#xD;

so dense, black and terrible, that it almost shrivelled the&#xD;
eyeballs and shrouded the vision of the peerless citizen of&#xD;
the upper courts of Glory.&#xD;
"Suddenly the radiant Heaven-born ceased its flight through&#xD;
the azure, looked pityingly earth and heaven-ward, heaved a&#xD;
deep and soul-drawn sigh, and stayed awhile to gaze upon&#xD;
the Woman and the Man. Long it gazed, at first in sorrow,&#xD;
but presently a smile passed across its face, as if a new and&#xD;
good thought had struck it, and then it darted off into space,&#xD;
as if intent upon discovering a cure for the desperate state&#xD;
of things just witnessed. 'Did it succeed ?' 'Wait awhile&#xD;
and see.&#xD;
"Human nature is a very curious and remarkable institution;&#xD;
so is woman nature, only a great deal more so-especially&#xD;
that of the California persuasion. Still it was not a little&#xD;
singular that Tom's wife's mind should have engendered (of&#xD;
Hate and Impatience) the precise thought that agitated his&#xD;
own at that very minute-that very identical crime-thought&#xD;
which had just rushed into being from the deeps of his own&#xD;
spirit-twin monsters, sibilating 'Murder !' in both their ears.&#xD;
" There is as close a sympathy between opposites and anta-&#xD;
gonists, indeed far greater, than between similarities-as&#xD;
strong attractions between opposing souls as in those fash-&#xD;

nizes many notions among current philosophies and philoso-&#xD;
phers ; but it is true, notwithstanding, and therefore so much&#xD;
the worse for the philosophers.&#xD;

time, and each determined to do a little private killing on&#xD;
their own individual and separate accounts. As yet, how-&#xD;
ever, - only the intent existed. The plans were yet crude,&#xD;
vague, immature, and only the crime loomed up indistinctly,&#xD;
like a grim, black mountain through a wintry fog.&#xD;

Bad thoughts are famous for making men grow old before&#xD;
the weight of years has borne them earthward. They wrin-&#xD;

hairs faster than Time himself can possibly whirl bodies grave-&#xD;
ward. The rolling hours and the circling years are less swift&#xD;
than evil thoughts of evil doing. Right doing, innocence,&#xD;

THE ROSICRUOLAJIs' STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
The sun had set, and slowly the moon was uprising--&#xD;
blessed moon ! God's Left Eye, wherewith He at night over,&#xD;
looketh the thoughts and deeds of solitary men and solitary&#xD;
women-for only such are capable of crime-those only who.&#xD;
are, and live alone-and many such there be, even at their&#xD;
own firesides, surrounded by their own families, own flesh,&#xD;
own blood-fathers, mothers, wives (as times go), husbands&#xD;
(as they are conventionally called). Many there be who exist&#xD;
in dreadful solitudes in the very midst of human crowds-Who&#xD;
live alone and pass through life, from the cradle to the grave,&#xD;
perfect strangers, perfect hermits, wholly unknowing, totally&#xD;
unknown, like interlopers on the globe, whose very right to&#xD;
be here all the world disputes. Friends, I have seen many&#xD;
such-have you?    These lonely people, these exotics, these&#xD;
insulars in the busy haunts of men--the teeming hives of&#xD;
commerce-alone in earth's well-paced market-towns-in the&#xD;
very saturnalia- of TRADE'S gala days ; and they are to be&#xD;
pitied, because they all have human, yearning hearts, filled&#xD;
to the brim with great. strangling sorrows ; and they have&#xD;
high and holy aspirations, only that the world chokes them&#xD;
down-crushes out the pure, sweet life God gave them.&#xD;
These are the Unloved ones; yet ought not to be, for are&#xD;
they not somebody's sons and daughters ? Yes ! Then they&#xD;
have rights ; and the first, greatest, highest right of all is the&#xD;
right of being loved-loved by the people of the land-our&#xD;
world-cousins, for what we do, are doing, or have done:; and&#xD;
to be loved, for the sake of the dear soul within, by somebody&#xD;
else's son or daughter.&#xD;

&#xD;
WHAT WE ALL DEMA'D.9;&#xD;
" So think we of the Rosicrucian Order; so, one day, will&#xD;
think the world."&#xD;
At this point of the Rosicrucian's narrative, Captai&#xD;
Jones, one of his auditory, interrupted him with :&#xD;
" Why, I thought the Rosicrucian system had been dead.&#xD;
buried, and forgotten two centuries ago."&#xD;
He replied : " The false or pseudo-Rosicrucian system has&#xD;
ceased to be. Truth herself is deathless. I cannot now stop&#xD;
to explain what interests you concerning the revived system&#xD;
of Rosicrucianism. You will now please to allow me to pr9-&#xD;
ceed with my story," said he, and then resumed, saying:&#xD;
" I repeat that only those who live alone, unloved, un-&#xD;
loving, are they who, becoming morbid, having all their kindly&#xD;
feelings driven back upon themselves, daily, hourly eating up&#xD;
their own hearts-brooding over their wrongs, their social&#xD;
and other misfortunes--at length engender crime, if not&#xD;
against their fellow-men, then against themselves.&#xD;
S" Oh, for something to love, and be loved by, if but a lit-&#xD;
tle pet dog ! The unloved ever are wrecked, the unloving&#xD;
ever wreck others. It is sweet to be loved by even a dumb&#xD;
brute ! But, ah, how inexpressibly, how infinitely better to&#xD;
be endeared for yourself alone [-for your integral wealth of&#xD;
soul--by a Man, a full, true Man; by a Woman, a full, gush-&#xD;
ing-hearted Woman; or, sweeter, dearer still, a child-some&#xD;
glorious hero of- a hobby-horse, some kitten-torturing Coral&#xD;
A.h, what a chord to touch ! I am very fond of children-&#xD;
dear little Godlings of the Ages. Those who reciprocate af-&#xD;
fection truly, are too full of God to keep a devil's lodgiu&#xD;

Rosicrucia's truths-that nothing is more certain than that&#xD;
somewhere, perhaps on earth, perhaps in some one of the in-&#xD;

or from amidst the mournful monodies in material creation--&#xD;

for you, my sister of the dark locks turning prematurely&#xD;

dote not like to peer down into human souls, and there be-&#xD;

horror to make her lovely face more -pale-things which dis-&#xD;
figure the gardens of man's spirit, and transform them into&#xD;
tangled brakes, where only weeds and unsightly things do&#xD;
grow. And Luna has a recording angel sitting on her&#xD;

brain, in whose service she hath ever been. He is just, in-&#xD;

And so it is poor policy to sin by night. It is equally so&#xD;

not to behold you, for he is always shining, and his rays&#xD;
pierce the clouds and light up the world, even though thick&#xD;
fogs and dense vapors conceal his radiant countenance from&#xD;
some. He sees man, though man beholds him not ; and he&#xD;
photographs all human thoughts and deeds upon the very&#xD;
substance of thesoul, and that, too, so well and deeply, that&#xD;
nothing will destroy the picture ; no sophistical 'All Right'&#xD;
lavements can wash it away, no philosophic bath destroy it.&#xD;
They are indelible, these sun-pictures on the spirit, and they&#xD;
are, some of them, very unsightly things to hang in the&#xD;
grand Memory-Galleries of the imperishable human soul ;&#xD;
for, in the coning epochs of existence, as-man moves' down&#xD;
the corridors of Time, these pictures will still hang upon the&#xD;
walls, and if evil, will peer down sadly and reproachfully,&#xD;
and fright many a joy away, when man would fain be rid,,&#xD;

shall be stranded on the shores of the grave, and his spirit is&#xD;

being wafted over strange and mystic seas on the farther&#xD;
brink of Time !&#xD;
" Night had come down, and Mr. and Mrs. Thomas W. re-&#xD;
tired to bed, each with thoughts of murder rankling in their&#xD;
hearts. Not a word was spoken, but they lay with throb-&#xD;
bing pulses, gazing out upon the night, through a little win-&#xD;
dow at the foot of the bed, whose upper sash was down-&#xD;
gazing out upon the starry lamps that skirt the highways of&#xD;
the sky, beacons of safety placed there to recall and guide&#xD;
all stray and wandering souls back on their way to Heaven 1I&#xD;
and they silently looked at the stars as they twinkled and&#xD;
shimmered in the azure.&#xD;
" The stars shone; and strange, horrible, ghastly thoughts&#xD;
agitated the woman and the man. 'Tom might get sick, and&#xD;
he might die ! Isn't it possible to feed him with a little ar-&#xD;
senic, or some other sort of poison, and not get caught at it ?&#xD;
I think it is. He, once dead, I shall be. free-free as the&#xD;
air, and happy as the birds I' Happy ! Think of it!-&#xD;
Is it not possible to push Betsey over the cliff, accident-&#xD;
ally, of course, and thus rid myself of her and misery to-&#xD;
gether, and forever 1' Forever ! Picture it ! And thus&#xD;
they lay as the night wore on, two precious immortal souls,.&#xD;
with rank Murder for a bed-fellow.&#xD;
"At the end of an hour's cogitation, both had reached&#xD;
the desperate resolution to carry their wishes into execution,&#xD;
and attempt the fearful crime.&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Come down in thy profoundest gloom-&#xD;
Without one radiant firefly's light,&#xD;
Beneath thine ebon arch entomb&#xD;
Earth from the gaze of Heaven, 0 Night.&#xD;
A deed of darkness must be done,&#xD;
Put out the moon, roll back the sun.'&#xD;
"Betsey was to 'season' Tom's coffee ; he was very fond&#xD;
of coffee. Tom was to treat Betsey to a ride in a one-horse&#xD;
shay, and topple the shay, horse, and 'Mrs. Thomas W.---&#xD;
all except his mother's only son-over a most convenient and&#xD;
inviting little precipice, a trifle over four hundred feet deep,&#xD;
with boulders at the bottom rather thicker than autumn&#xD;
leaves in Vallambrossa, and a good deal harder. All this&#xD;
was to be the result of 'accident,' and 'inscrutible Provi-&#xD;
dence,' as a matter of course. Afterwards he was to buy a&#xD;
' slashing suit' of mourning, bury what was left of her in&#xD;
grand style, erect a fine headstone of marble, announcing&#xD;
that-&#xD;
"'The Lord gave, and the Lord took away,&#xD;

right on the road between their house and Santa Blarneeo.&#xD;

Chaldea, the astrologers of early Egypt, and the whole an-&#xD;
cient world duly acknowledged the power of the astral&#xD;

the soul-expanding potentiality of a star upon Clarence&#xD;

magnetized into a sort of restless sleep from gazing at the&#xD;
star-an uneasy, disturbed, nervous, but dreamless sleep--&#xD;
as if a heavy, thick and murky cloud just floated off a stag-&#xD;
nant' marsh, there descended upon- the house a pestilent,&#xD;
slimy mist, and it gathered over and about the roof ; and it&#xD;
entered, rolling heavily, into the chamber, coming through&#xD;
that little window at the foot of the bed.&#xD;
"It was a thick, dense, iron-greyish mist, approaching&#xD;
blackness, only that there was a sort of turgid redness, not a&#xD;
positive color, but as if it had floated over the depths of hell,&#xD;
and caught a portion of its infernal luminosity. And it was&#xD;
thick and dank, and dense and very heavy ; and it swept and&#xD;
rolled, and poured into the room in thick, voluminous masses&#xD;
-into the very room, and about the couch where tossed in&#xD;
uneasy slumber the woman and the man. And it filled the&#xD;
apartment, and hung like a pall about their couch ; and its&#xD;
fetor oppressed their senses ; and it made their breath come&#xD;
thick, and difficult, and wheezing from their lungs. It was&#xD;
dreadful !  And their breath mingled with the strange&#xD;
vapor, apparently endowing it with a kind of horrid life, a&#xD;
sort of semi-sentience ; and gave it a very peculiar and fear-&#xD;
ful movement-orderly, systematic, gyratory, pulsing move-&#xD;
ment--the quick, sharp breath of the woman, the deep and&#xD;
heavy breath of the man. And it had come through the&#xD;
window at the foot of the bed, for the upper sash was down.&#xD;

ten thousand years old, and so grandI Like the waves of&#xD;
that sea did the cloud begin to move gyrally around the&#xD;
chamber, hanging to the curtains, clinging to the walls, but&#xD;
as if dreading the moonlight, carefully avoiding the window&#xD;
through which it had come, the little window at the foot of&#xD;
the bed-whose upper sash was down.&#xD;
" Soon, very soon, the cloud commenced to change the&#xD;
axis of its movement, and to condense into a large globe of&#xD;
iron-hued nebule; and it began a contrary revolution; and&#xD;
it floated thus, and swam like a dreadful destiny over the&#xD;
unconscious sleepers on the bed, after which it moved to the&#xD;
western side of the room, and became nearly stationary in an&#xD;
angle of the wall, where for a while it stood or floated, silent,&#xD;
appalling, almost motionless, changeless, still.&#xD;
" At the end of about six minutes it moved again, and in&#xD;
a very short time assumed the gross but unmistakable outline&#xD;
of a gigantic human form-an outline horrible, black as night&#xD;
-a frowning human form-cut not sharply from the vapor,&#xD;
but still distinctly human in its shapeess-but very imperfect,&#xD;
except the head, which was too frightfully complete to leave&#xD;
even a lingering doubt but that some black and hideous&#xD;

fled. The face was flat and broad, its lips the lips of incar-&#xD;
nate hate and lust combined. Its color was the greenish&#xD;
blue of corpses on a summer battle-field, suffused with the&#xD;
angry redness of a demon's spite, while its eyes-great God!&#xD;
-its eye-for there was but one, and that one in the very&#xD;
centre of its forehead, between the nose and brow-was&#xD;
bloodshot and purple, gleaming with infernal light, and it&#xD;
glamored down with more than fiendish malignance upon the&#xD;
woman and the man.&#xD;
"Nothing about this Thing was clearly cut or defined,&#xD;
except the head-its hideous, horrible head. Otherwise it&#xD;
was incomplete-a sort of spectral Formlessness. It was&#xD;
unfinished, as was the awful crime-thought that had brought&#xD;
it into being. It was on one side apparently a male, on the&#xD;
other it looked like a female ; but, taken as a whole, it was&#xD;
neither man nor woman, it was neither brute nor human, but&#xD;
it was a monster and a ghoul-born on earth of human pa-&#xD;
rents. There are many such things stalking our streets, and&#xD;
invisibly presiding over festal scenes, in dark cellars, by the&#xD;
lamp, in the cabinet and camp ; and many such are daily&#xD;
peering down upon the white paper on the desks where sit&#xD;
grave and solemn Ministers of State, who, for Ambition's&#xD;
sake and greed of gold, play with an Empire's destiny as&#xD;
cbildin do. with toys, and who, with the stroke of a pen,&#xD;

SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DEAD MEN I 9&#xD;
&#xD;
consign vast armies to bloody graves-brave men, glorious&#xD;
hosts, kept back while victory is possible-kept back till the&#xD;
foeman has dug their graves just in front of his own stone&#xD;
walls and impenetrable ramparts-and then sent forward to&#xD;
glut the ground with human blood. Do you hear me, Minis-&#xD;
ters of State ? I mean you ! you who practically. regard&#xD;
men's lives as boys regard the minnows of a brook. I mean&#xD;
you who sit in high places, and do murder by the wholesale---&#xD;
you who treat the men as half foes, half friends, tenderly;&#xD;
men whose hands are griped with the iron grip of death&#xD;
around the Nation's throat-the Nation's throat-do you&#xD;
hear ?--and crushing out the life that God and our fathers&#xD;
gave it. Remember Milliken's Bend, Port Hudson, Fort&#xD;
Wagner, and the Black Heroes of the war-Noble men-&#xD;
Black, too, but the bravest of the brave-yet treated not as&#xD;
heroes ought to be. Forget not Fredericksburg ! and&#xD;
bear in mind that this gorgon of your own creation will not&#xD;
quit you, day or night-not even on your dying day, when it&#xD;
will hiss into your ears, 'Father, behold, embrace me ?'--,&#xD;
and its slime will fall upon and choke you, as you have&#xD;
choked our country. And the sheeted ghosts of six hundred&#xD;
thousand heroes, slaughtered by a whim, will mournfully up-&#xD;
braid, and-perhaps-forgive you. Will the weeping widows&#xD;
and the countless orphans--pale, blue-cast women, pale with&#xD;
grief, blue with want ; orphans, poor little shrivelled, half-&#xD;
starved orphans-will they forgive you ? will your own con-&#xD;
science ? will the Eternal God of Heaven ?  Why did you&#xD;
sacrifice these six hundred thousand men ?  Why did. you&#xD;
&#xD;
not put your guns and swords in the hands of six hundred&#xD;
thousand men-men who had God's best gifts to fight for&#xD;
and maintain-Liberty and their wives ?  Black men, too-&#xD;
brawny, brave, strong-hearted, Freedom-nerved, God-inspired&#xD;
black men. No blade man yet ever sold his country ! Why&#xD;
don't you first remove their disabilities here in the North'?&#xD;
Why don't you bid them rise and be men? Why grudge&#xD;
freemen the pay of other free men ; the bounty, the pension,&#xD;
of other heroes of the same rank ? Do this, let the Negro&#xD;
understand that you concede his manhood, and appreciate his&#xD;
prowess ; let him once know that you are grateful for all he&#xD;
does for the country, and proclaim it to the world, and Black&#xD;
men will flock to your standard, not only from your own soil,&#xD;
but from every spot on earth where civilized black men exist.&#xD;
" See, yonder is a plain, miles in extent. In its centre&#xD;
there stands an obelisk. Go, Ministers of State, and plant&#xD;
on its top a banner, upon which shall be emblazoned this&#xD;
magic sentence: 'Freedom--Personal, Political, and So-&#xD;
cial, to the Black man-and protection of his Rights for-&#xD;
ever,' and there will be more magnetic power in it than in&#xD;
ten thousand Ministers, with their little whims ; ten thou-&#xD;
sand 'Fancy Generals,' with their 'pretty little games,'-&#xD;
and such would be History's record when she handed you&#xD;
down the ages. If you would live in the sacred page, and&#xD;
have your names shine brightly, act, act at once, cut the cords&#xD;
that now bind the Black man. Say to him: 'Come as a&#xD;
man, not as a chattel ! Come with me to Enfranchisement&#xD;
and Victory!  Let us save the Nation !' and the swift-&#xD;

4 TEN MINUTES AFTER."&#xD;
&#xD;
winged winds will bear the sound from pole to pole, from sea&#xD;
to sea, and from continent, island, and floating barks, from&#xD;
hills, valleys, and mountains, from hut, hovel, and dismal&#xD;
swamps, will come a vast and fearful host, in numbers like&#xD;
unto the leaves of the forest ; and they will gather in that&#xD;
plain around that obelisk, rallying around that banner, and&#xD;
before their victorious march Rebellion will go down as brick&#xD;
-    walls before the storm of iron ; and if. France, or England,&#xD;
or Austria, or all, combine against them-they, too, will go&#xD;
out of the battle, nevermore to enter it again.&#xD;
" This is possible destiny ! Think of it, 0 Ministers of&#xD;
State!&#xD;
" And so the fearful spectre in Tom Clark's room had its&#xD;
origin then and there-had been created by the morning's&#xD;
wicked thought-a creature fashioned by their human wills,&#xD;
and drawing its vitality from -their life and pulses-drawing&#xD;
its very soul from out those two beating human hearts. Tell&#xD;
me not that I am painting a picture, limning the creature of&#xD;
a distorted fancy. I know better, you know better, we all&#xD;
know that just such hideous creatures, just such monstrosi-&#xD;
ties, move, viewless, daily, up and down the crowded streets&#xD;
of Santa Blarneeo, up and down the streets of the Empire.&#xD;
City and Puritanic Boston ; but there are crowds of them&#xD;
in Pennsylvania Avenue, and they wear phantom epaulett.es&#xD;
upon their spectral shoulders ! You and I know that just&#xD;
such and other&#xD;
" 'Monstrous, horrid things that creep&#xD;
From out a slimy sea,'&#xD;
&#xD;
exist all over the land-but principally in high places begot-&#xD;
ten of Treason. and lust of Gold.&#xD;
" Soon the lips began to move ; it spoke: 'Father ! mo-&#xD;
ther ! I am yet weak ; be quick ; make me strong ! feed&#xD;
me ; I am hungry ; give me blood-hot streams-great&#xD;
gouts of blood ! It is well. Kill, poison, die ; it is well !&#xD;
Ha ! ha ! It is well ; ho ! ho !' and then the Thing began to&#xD;
dissolve into a filmy mist, until at last only the weight of its&#xD;
presence was felt, for it floated invisibly but heavily through&#xD;
the room, and, except the gleam-the fiery gleam of its soli-&#xD;
tary eye-nothing else of it was discernible.&#xD;
"Ten minutes elapsed after it had found voice, and faded&#xD;
away, when suddenly a fleecy cloud that had for some time&#xD;
past obscured the sky in the direction of Hesper, shutting&#xD;
out her silvery smiles, broke away, and permitted her beams&#xD;
and those of the moon to once more enter the chamber and&#xD;
flood it with a sheeted silver glory-the room where still&#xD;
lingered the hateful Thing, and where still slept the woman&#xD;
and the man.&#xD;
"Simultaneously with this auspicious event there came sigh-&#xD;
ing over the landscape, the musical notes of such a song as&#xD;
only seraphs sing-came over the wastes like the mystical&#xD;
bells that I have heard at sunset often while sailing on the&#xD;
Nile-mystical bells which thousands have heard and marvelled&#xD;
at-soft bells, silvery bells, church bells-bells, however, not&#xD;
rung by human hands. I have often heard them chiming over&#xD;
Egypt's yellow arid sands, and I believe they are rung by&#xD;
angel hands on the other side of Time. And such a sound,&#xD;

only sweeter, came floating o'er the lea, and through the s l1&#xD;
air into the little chamber. Was it a call to the angels to&#xD;
join in prayer-midnight prayer, for the sinful souls of men ?&#xD;
But it came. Low it was, and clear ; pure it was, and full&#xD;
of saintly pity, like unto the dying cadence of the prayer that&#xD;
was prayed by the Sufferer on the stony heights of Calvary ;&#xD;
that same Calvary where I have stood within a year, 'midst&#xD;
devout lovers of their Lord, and the jeering scoffs of Mussul-&#xD;
mans ! And the music came-so sweetly, as if 'twould melt&#xD;
the stony heart of Crime itself. And it proclaimed itself the&#xD;
overture of another act of the eventful drama then and there&#xD;
performing. And see I look there ! the curtain rises.&#xD;
Woman, Man, behold ! Alas ! they slumber insensibly on.&#xD;
Gaze steadily at that upper sash-above it-for it is down ;&#xD;
see, the clear space is again obscured by a cloud ; but this&#xD;
time it is one of silver, lined with burnished gold, and flecked.&#xD;
and edged with amethyst and purple. Look again ! What&#xD;
is that at the window?  It is a visible music-a glorious&#xD;
sheet of silvery vapor, bright, clear, and glittering as an&#xD;
angel's conscience'! It is a broad and glowing mantle of&#xD;
woven gossamer, suffused with rose-blushes, and sprinkled&#xD;
with star-beams ; and it flows through the space, and streams&#xD;
into the chamber, bathing all things in holy tremulous light,.&#xD;
soft, sweet, balmy, and pure as the tears of virgin innocence&#xD;
weeping for the early dead ! That light ! It was just such a&#xD;
light as beamed from your eyes, Woman-beamed from out&#xD;
your soul, when,'after your agony, your eye first fell upon the&#xD;
angel you had borne-the man-child whom God gave to your&#xD;
&#xD;
y L&#xD;
&#xD;
heart a little while ago ; just such a light as flashed fitfully&#xD;
from your soul, and fell upon the cradle, 0 father of the strong&#xD;
and hopeful heart, 'Wherein the little stranger lay;. just such&#xD;
light as beamed from your eyes, in pride, and hope, and&#xD;
strange, deep prophecies, as you- bent over her languishing&#xD;
form, heartfully pressing her first-born to her dear woman's&#xD;
bosom, when you looked so tenderly, kindly, lovingly down&#xD;
through her eyes into her spirit-the true heart beating for&#xD;
you and it, beneath folded-contentedly folded, arms-con-&#xD;
tented, too, through all the deep anguish, such, 0 man, as only&#xD;
a woman and a mother can undergo. That light ! It was&#xD;
like that which fell upon the babe she had given you, and the&#xD;
great Man-wanting world-given first for its coming uses, and&#xD;
then to Him who- doeth all things very well--well, even when&#xD;
He taketh the best part of our souls away, and transplants&#xD;
the slips in His eternal and, infinite gardens, across the deep&#xD;
dark gulfs that hide the dead ; just 'such a light as gleamed&#xD;
from her eyes and thine own, when your hearts felt calm and&#xD;
trustful once more, after the great, deep grief billows had&#xD;
rolled over them-grief for the loss of one who stayed but a&#xD;
little while on earth-all too coarse and rough for her-some&#xD;
little, cooing Winnie-like mine-whose soul nestles afar off,&#xD;
on His breast, in the blue sky, and whose body they laid in&#xD;
the cold grave, there in Utica, after they-he-had let her&#xD;
starve, perish Oadly for want of proper food and medicine,&#xD;
while I was on the deep-winsome Winnie ! child of my soul,&#xD;
gone, lost, but not forever !-just such a light played in that&#xD;
little room as streams from angel eyes when God takes back&#xD;

THE ROSIORUAJNT'S -STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
at the hands of Azrael and Sandalphon, the beautiful angels&#xD;
of Death and of Prayer, the things you had learned to love too&#xD;
well-to forgetfulness of God and all true human duty. But&#xD;
they will give back what they took : they will give back all,&#xD;
more in the clear sunshine of a brighter and a purer day, than&#xD;
these earthly ones of ours I&#xD;
" And the light streamed through and into the cham-&#xD;
ber where lay the woman and the man ; and it radiated&#xD;
around, and bathed every' object in a crystalline lumin-&#xD;
escence ; and it carried a sadness with it-just such a sad-&#xD;
ness as we feel when parting from those who love us very&#xD;
well ; as I felt on the day I parted from --, Brother of my&#xD;
soul ! when we parted at the proud ship's side-the ocean&#xD;
courser, destined to bear me over the steaming seas to Egypt's&#xD;
hoary shrines. It bore a sadness with it like unto that which&#xD;
welled up from my soul, tapping the fountains of friendship--&#xD;
and tears upon its way, in the memorable hour wherein I left&#xD;
the Golden Gate, and began my perilous journey to the dis-&#xD;
tant Orient-across the bounding seas. What an hour i--&#xD;
that wherein our bodies move away, but leave our sorrowing&#xD;
souls behind !&#xD;
" Well; a holy light, sadness-bearing light, like this now&#xD;
rested on the bodies of the sleeping pair. At first, this silvery&#xD;
radiance filled the room, and then the fleecy vapor began to&#xD;
condense slowly. Presently it formed into a rich and opal-&#xD;
escent cloud-column, which speedily changed into a large&#xD;
globe, winged, radiant and beautiful. Gradually there ap-&#xD;
peared in the centre of this globe a luminous spot, momen-&#xD;
&#xD;
tarily intensifying its brilliance, until it became like unto a&#xD;
tiny sun, or as the scintills of a rare diamond when all the&#xD;
lamps are brightly shining. Slowly, steadily, the change&#xD;
went on in'this magic crystal globe, until there appeared,&#xD;
within it the diminutive figure of a female, whose outlines be-&#xD;
came more clear as time passed- on, until, at the end of a few&#xD;
minutes, the figure was perfect, and stood fully revealed and.&#xD;
complete-about eighteen inches high, and lovely-ah, how -&#xD;
lovely 1-that figure ; it was more than woman is-was all&#xD;
she may become-petite, but absolutely perfect in form, feature&#xD;
and expression ; and there was a love-glow radiating from&#xD;
her presence sufficiently melting to subdue the heart of Sin&#xD;
itself, though robed in Nova Zembla's icy shroud. Her eyes !&#xD;
-ah, her eyes 1--they were softer than the down upon a&#xD;
ring-dove's breast 1-not electric, not magnetic-such are&#xD;
human eyes ; and she was not of this earth-they were some-&#xD;
thing more, and higher-they were tearful, anxious, solicitous,&#xD;
hopeful, tender, beaming with that snowy love which blessed&#xD;
immortals feel. Her hair was loose, and hung in flowing&#xD;
waves adown her pearly neck and shoulders. Such a neck&#xD;
and shoulders 1-polished alabaster, dashed with orange&#xD;
blossoms, is a very poor comparison ; it would be better to&#xD;
say that they resembled petrified light, tinted with the morn-&#xD;
ing blush of roses I Around her brow was a coronet of burn-&#xD;
ished, rainbow hues ; or rather the resplendent tints of polar-&#xD;
ized light. In its centre was the insignia of the Supreme&#xD;
Temple of the Rosie Cross-a circle inclosing a triangle--a&#xD;
censer on one side, an anchor fouled on the other, the centre-&#xD;

piece being a winged globe, surmounted by the sacred trine,&#xD;
and based by the watchword of the Order, 'TaR,' the whole&#xD;
being arched with the blazon, 'RosIcRuca.' To attempt a&#xD;
minute description of this peerless fay, on my part, would be&#xD;
madness :-.-her chin, her mouth, her bust, her lips ! No! I&#xD;
am not so vain as to make the essay. I may be equal to&#xD;
such a task a century or two from this, but am not equal to&#xD;
it now.&#xD;
"There, then, and thus stood the crowned beauty of the&#xD;
Night, gazing down with looks of pity upon the restless&#xD;
occupants of that humble couch ; for during all these trans-&#xD;
actions they had been asleep. She stood there, the realiza-&#xD;
tion and embodiment of Light ; and there, directly facing&#xD;
her, glowered, and floated the eye of that hateful, scowling,&#xD;
frowning Thing-scowling with malignant joy upon the&#xD;
woman and the man. Thus stood the Shadow : thus stood&#xD;
the Light. But soon there came a change o'er the spirit of&#xD;
the scene ; for now an occurrence took place of a character&#xD;
quite as remarkable as either of those already recounted ;. for&#xD;
in a very short time after the two Mysteries had assumed&#xD;
their relative positions, there came through the window-&#xD;
the same little window at the foot of the bed-the tall and-&#xD;
stately figure of a man-a tall and regal.figure, but it was&#xD;
light and airy-buoyant as a summer cloud pillowed oi the&#xD;
air--the figure of a man, but not solid, for it was translucent&#xD;
as the pearly dew, radiant as the noontide sun, majestic as a&#xD;
lofty mountain when it wears a snowy crown !--the royal&#xD;
form of a man,, but evidently not a ghost, or wraith, or a.&#xD;
&#xD;
man of these days, or of this earth, or of the ages now&#xD;
elapsing. He was something more than man; he was supra-&#xD;
mortal ; a bright and glorious citizen of a starry land of&#xD;
glory, whose gates. I beheld, once upon- a time, wherr Lara.&#xD;
bade me wait ; he was, of a lineage we Rosicrucians wot ofr&#xD;
and. only we !-a dweller in a wondrous city; afar off, real,&#xD;
actual-whose gates are as, the finest pearl-so bright and&#xD;
beautiful are they.. .  . The stately figure advanced mid-&#xD;
way of the room, until- het occupied the centre of a triangle&#xD;
formed by the shadowy Thing, the - female figure,. and the&#xD;
bed.; and then he ,waved his hand, in which was -a staff or&#xD;
truncheons-winged- at top and- bottom ; and he spake,&#xD;
saying :&#xD;
"' I, Otanethi, the Genius of the Temple, Lord of the&#xD;

That abstinence from wrong is not virtue which results&#xD;
from external pressure--fear of what the speech of people&#xD;
may effect ! It is false !-that virtue which requires bolster-&#xD;
ing or propping up, and falls when left to try its strength&#xD;

vice is that which leaves sad marks upon the soul's escutch-&#xD;

great Ledger of the Yet to Be! True virtue is good resolve,&#xD;
better thinking, and action best of all ! That man is but&#xD;
half completed whom the world has wholly made. - They are&#xD;
never truly made who fail to make themselves ! Mankind are&#xD;
not of the kingdom of the Shadow, nor of the glorious realm&#xD;

o peerless Hesperina, are the lessons I am sent to teach.&#xD;
Thou art here to save two souls, not from loss, assailing or&#xD;

Begone ! To thy labor, foul Thing, and do thy work also&#xD;

S THE regal being was scarcely gone from the chamber ere&#xD;
Hesperina and the Shadow-which had- once more become&#xD;
visible, approached the sleeping pair-drew nigh unto the&#xD;
woman and the man; and the Fay gently breathed upon&#xD;
their heads, as if to establish a magnetic rapport between her-&#xD;
self and them. She then calmly took her stand, near the&#xD;
bedside, and folded her beautiful arms across her still more&#xD;
beautiful bosom, and awaited-the action of the tempter. She&#xD;
had not long to wait, for straightway the Black Presence&#xD;
advanced, and hovered, over the bed-hovered scowlingly&#xD;
over then, glaring down into their souls, as doth the varit&#xD;
pire upon the man she would destroy-the spirit of Wrong&#xD;
peering; wistfully at all beautiful, things, and true! Sucl&#xD;

movements and postures, that the twain were rapidly cross-&#xD;
ing the mystic boundaries that divide our own from Dream-&#xD;
land-that they were just entering the misty mid-region-the&#xD;
Shadow, the Thing, the monstrous IT, ruling the hour, and&#xD;
guiding them through the strange realm---&#xD;
"'That lieth sublime, out of Space and out of Time.'&#xD;
" The man who says that dreams are figments is a fool.&#xD;
Half of our nightly experiences are, in their subsequent ef-&#xD;
fects upon us, far more real and positive than our daily life&#xD;
of wakefulness. Dreams are, as a general thing, save in rare&#xD;
instances, sneered at by the wise ones of this sapient age.&#xD;
Events, we of Rosicrucia hold, are pre-acted in other&#xD;
spheres of being. Prophetic dreaming is no new thing. Cir-&#xD;
cumstances are constantly occurring in the outer life that&#xD;
have been pre-viewed in Dream-land. Recently, while in-&#xD;
Constantinople, I became acquainted with a famous Dongo-&#xD;
lese negro, near the Grand Mosque of St. Sophia, in one of&#xD;
the narrow streets on the left, as you enter the square from&#xD;
toward the first bridge, and this man had reduced the inter-&#xD;
pretation of dreams to a science almost ; and many a long&#xD;
hour have I rapidly driven the pen, in the work of recording&#xD;
what was translated. to me from Dongolese and Arabic into&#xD;
Turkish and English, from his lips, obtaining in this way not&#xD;
merely the principles upon which his art was founded, but&#xD;
also explicit interpretations of about twenty-nine hundred&#xD;
different dreams.&#xD;
&#xD;
"THE DREAM OF THOMAS W.&#xD;
" Tom Clark was dreaming ; and, lo! great changes had&#xD;
taken place in the fortunes of the sleeping man. No longer&#xD;
a toiler at the anvil or the plow, he had become a rich and,&#xD;
as times go, therefore an honored man-honored by the&#xD;
crowd which, as a general thing, sees the most virtue in the&#xD;
heaviest sack of dollars.&#xD;
"The wealth of Mr. Thomas W. had come to him in a very&#xD;
singular and mysterious manner, all since he had become a&#xD;
widower ; for Mrs. Thomas was dead, poor woman, having&#xD;
some time previously met her fate through a very melancholy&#xD;
accident. An extract from the 'Daily Truth-Teller,' of&#xD;
Santa Blarneeo, a copy of which paper Tom Clark carried&#xD;
in his pocket all the time, and which pocket I shall take the&#xD;
liberty of picking of the journal aforesaid, and of quoting,&#xD;
will tell the story--sad story-but not the whole of it, quite :&#xD;
"' FEARFUL AND FATAL CATASTROPHE I--We learn with&#xD;
deep, sincere, and very profound regret, that another of those&#xD;
fearful calamities, which no human prudence can guard&#xD;
against, no foresight prevent, has just occurred, and by means&#xD;
of which a most estimable woman, an exemplary and loving&#xD;
wife, an excellent Christian, firm friend, and esteemed per-&#xD;
son, has been suddenly cut off in her prime, and sent prema-&#xD;
turely to her final account. It appears that the late heavy&#xD;
rains have rendered all the roads leading from Santa Blarneeo&#xD;

"'Especially is this the case along the cliff road, and' more&#xD;
particularly where- it skirts the side of the: Bayliss Gulch.&#xD;
Of late it has been exceedingly unsafe to pass that way in'&#xD;
broad ,daylight, and much more so after dark.&#xD;
"' At about ten o'clock yesterday morning; as Mr. Ellet,&#xD;
the Ranchero, was passing that road, along the, brink, of&#xD;
what is known as the Scott ravine, his. horse shied at some&#xD;
objects.; in the path; which, proved to be a man's hat and'&#xD;
woman's shawl;, on the- very edge of the precipice---al clear&#xD;
fall of something like four hundred feet. It immediately oc-&#xD;
curred, to; Farmer Ellety that if anybody had tumbled over&#xD;
the cliff, that there was a great probability that whoever it'-&#xD;
was must have been considerably hurt, if nothing more, by the&#xD;
time they reached the bottom, as' he well remembered! had.&#xD;
been' the, case with, a yoke' of steers: of his that" had run off 'at'&#xD;
the same spot some years before, and both of which were&#xD;
killed, very dead, indeed, by the accident. So, at' least, he&#xD;
informed our reporter, who' took'down theJstatement phono-r&#xD;
graphically. Mr. Ellet discovered the remains' of a horse&#xD;
and' buggy at the bottom of the ravine, and' at a little to the.&#xD;
left, about ten feet down the' bank, where he had, by a-mira.&#xD;
cle, been thrown when the horse went, over, Mr. Ellet. found&#xD;
the insensible body of: a man, desperately hurt,' but still'&#xD;
breathing. His fall. had been broken by some stbutyoutg}&#xD;

W. Clark, a well-known, honest, sober man, and a neighbor&#xD;
as well. Mr. Clark's injuries are altogether internal, from&#xD;
the shock of falling, otherwise he is almost unscathed. His&#xD;
pains inwardly are very great, besides which he is nearly dis-&#xD;
tracted and insane from the loss of his wife and horse, but&#xD;
mainly for the former. It seems that they had been riding&#xD;
out on a visit to a sick friend, and the horse had slipped on&#xD;
the wet clay, had taken fright, and leaped the bank, just as&#xD;
Clark was hurled from the buggy, and landed where Ellet&#xD;
found him. The horse, carriage, and the precious freight,&#xD;
instantly plunged headlong down through four hundred feet&#xD;
of empty air.&#xD;
"'We learn that the couple were most devotedly attached&#xD;
to each other, as is notorious from the fact, among others,&#xD;
that whenever they met, after a day's absence, and no mat-&#xD;
ter where, nor in what company, they invariably embraced&#xD;
and kissed each other, in the rich, deep fullness of their im-&#xD;
passioned and exhaustless conjugal love. Poor Clark's loss&#xD;
is irreparable. His wife had been twice married, but her af-&#xD;
fection for her first husband was but as a shallow brook com-&#xD;
pared to the deep, broad ocean of love for him who now&#xD;
mourns, most bitterly mourns, her untimely fate I'&#xD;

56           THE ROSICRUCIAN'8 STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
CLARK IN A -REVERIE.        57&#xD;
&#xD;
" At the end of two days Mr. Clark recovered sufficiently&#xD;
to go to the foot of the cliff, and when there his first work&#xD;
'as to carefully bury what was left of his wife-and her&#xD;
first husband's portrait at the same time-for he had placed&#xD;
that canvas across the backs of two chairs, and amused&#xD;
himself by jumping through it--like a sensible man.&#xD;
" There is-do you know it ?-an almost uncontrollable fas&#xD;
cination in Danger. Have you never been seized with the&#xD;
desire to throw yourself down some yawning chasm, into&#xD;
some abyss, over into the ready jaws of a shark, to handle a&#xD;
tiger, play with a rattlesnake, jump into a foundery furnace,&#xD;
write a book, edit a paper, or some other such equally wise&#xD;
and sensible thing ? Well, I know many who have thus&#xD;
been tempted--and to their ruin. Human nature always&#xD;
has a morbid streak, and that is one of them, as is also the&#xD;
horrible attraction to an execution-to visit the scene of a&#xD;
homicide or a conflagration-especially if a few people have&#xD;
been burnt up-and the more the stronger the curiosity;&#xD;
or to look at the spot where a score or two of Pat-landers&#xD;
have been mumified by the weakness of walls--and con-&#xD;
tractors' consciences. With what strange interest we read&#xD;
how the monarch of some distant lovely isle dined with his&#xD;
cabinet, off Potage aux tiet de missionaire-how they ban-&#xD;
queted on delicate slices of boiled evangelist, all of which&#xD;
viandes were unwillingly supplied by the Rev. Jonadab Con-&#xD;
vert-'em-all, who had a call that way to supply the bread of&#xD;
life, not slices of cold missionary-and did both !  So with&#xD;
Tom Clark. One would have thought that the last scene he&#xD;
&#xD;
would willingly have looked upon, would have been the bottom&#xD;
of the ravine. Not a bit of it. An uncontrollable desire&#xD;
seized him, and for his life he could not keep away from the&#xD;
foot of the cliff. He went there, and day by day searched&#xD;
for every vestige of the poor woman, whose heart, and head&#xD;
likewise, he at last had succeeded in breaking into very small&#xD;
fragments. These relics he buried as he found them, yet still&#xD;
could not forsake his daily haunt. Of course, for a time the&#xD;
people observed his action, attributed it to grief and love,&#xD;
forbore to watch or disturb, and finally cared nothing about&#xD;
the matter whatever. Such things are nothing in California.&#xD;
Well was it for Clark that it was so-that they regarded&#xD;
him as mildly insane, and let his vagaries have full swing, for&#xD;
it gave him ample time and opportunity to fully improve one&#xD;
of the most astounding pieces of good luck that ever befell a&#xD;
human being since the year One.&#xD;
" It fell out upon a certain day, that, after attending to&#xD;
other duties, Tom Clark, as usual, wound his way, by a zig-&#xD;
zag and circuitous path, to the foot of the hill, and took his&#xD;
accustomed seat near by the rock where it was evident Mrs.&#xD;
C. had landed-the precise spot where her flight had been&#xD;
so rudely checked. There he sat for a while, like Volney, in&#xD;
deep speculative reverie and meditation-not upon the&#xD;
ruins of Empires, but upon those of his horse, his buggy, and&#xD;
his wife. Suddenly he started to his feet, for a very strange&#xD;
fancy had struck upon his brain. I cannot tell the precise&#xD;
spot of its impingement, but it hit him hard. He acted on&#xD;
the idea instantly, and forthwith resolved to dig up all the&#xD;

&#xD;
soil thereabouts, that had perchance drank a single drop of&#xD;
her blood. It was not conscience that was at work, it was&#xD;
destiny. This soil, that had been imbrued with the blood of&#xD;
the horse and buggy-no, the woman, I mean.-he resolved&#xD;
to bury out of sight of man and brute, and sun and moon,.&#xD;
and little peeping stars ; for an instinct told him that the&#xD;
gore-stained soil could not be an acceptable spectacle to,&#xD;
anything on earth, upon the velvet air, or in the blue heaven&#xD;
above it ; and so he scratched up the mould and buried&#xD;
it out of sight, in a rift hard by, between two mighty&#xD;
rocks, that the earthquake had split asunder a million years&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"And so he threw it in, and then tried to screen- it from the'&#xD;
sun with leaves and grass, great stones and logs of wood ;&#xD;
after which he again sat down upon the rock to rest.&#xD;
"Presently he arose to go, when, as he did so, a gleam of&#xD;
sunshine flashed back upon his eyes from a minute spicule of,&#xD;
he knew not what. He stooped ; picked up the object, and&#xD;
found, to his utter astonishment, that he held in his hand a&#xD;
lump of gold, solid gold--an abraded, glittering lump of&#xD;
actual, shining gold.&#xD;
"Tom Clark nearly fainted ! The lump weighed not less&#xD;
than a pound. Its sides had been scratched by him as he&#xD;
dug: away the earth at the foot of the cliff where his wife&#xD;
had landed, after a brief flight through- four hundred feet of&#xD;
empty air-a profitable journey for him-but not for her,&#xD;
nor the horse, nor buggy !~1&#xD;

wiping the great round beads of sweat from off his brow. He&#xD;
wept at every pore. But it was for a minute only : in the&#xD;
next he was madly, wildly digging with the trowel he always&#xD;
carried with him, for Tom was Herb-Doctor in general for&#xD;
the region roundabout, and was great at the root and herb&#xD;
business, therefore went prepared to dig them wherever&#xD;
chance disclosed them.&#xD;
"Five long hours did he labor like a Hercules, in the soft&#xD;
mould, in the crevices of the rocks-everywhere-and with&#xD;
mad energy, with frantic zeal. Five long hours did he ply&#xD;
that trowel with all the force that the hope of sudden wealth&#xD;
inspired, and then, exhausted, spent, he sank prostrate on the&#xD;
ground, his head resting on a mass of yellow gold-gold not&#xD;
in dust, or flecks, or scales, but in great and massy lumps&#xD;
and wedges, each one large enough for -a poor man's mak-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"That morning Thomas Clark's worldly wealth, all told,&#xD;
could have been bought thrice over for any five of the pieces&#xD;
then beneath his head, and there were scores of them. His&#xD;
brain reeled with the tremendous excitement. He had struck&#xD;
the richest 'Lead' ever struck by mortal man on the surface&#xD;
of the planet, for he had already collected more than he&#xD;
could lift, and he was a very stong and powerful man.&#xD;
There was enough to fill a. two-peck measure, packed and&#xD;
piled as close and high as it could be ; and yet he had just&#xD;
begun. Ah, Heaven, it was too much !&#xD;

the foul fiend-for he, like thee, had riches inexhaustible ;&#xD;
but, unlike Valmondi, and the higher Brethren of the Rosie&#xD;
Cross, thou hast not the priceless secret of Perpetual youth.&#xD;
Thou wilt grow old, Tom Clark-grow old, and sick, and&#xD;
grey hairs and wrinkles will overtake thee. And see ! yon-&#xD;
der is an open grave, and it yearns for thee, Tom Clark, it&#xD;
yearns for thee ! And there's Blood upon thy hands, Tom&#xD;
Clark, red gouts of Blood-and gold cannot wash it off.&#xD;
" Valmondi repented, and died a beggar, but thy heart is&#xD;
cased in golden armor, and the shafts of Mercy may not&#xD;

and lofty daring for the world and for thy fellow-men. Gold !&#xD;
Ah, Tom, Tom, thou hadst better have been- a humble&#xD;
Rosicrucian-better than I, for weakness has been mine.&#xD;
It is better to labor hard with brain and tongue and hands,&#xD;
for mere food and raiment, than be loaded down with riches,&#xD;
that bear many a man earthward, and fill untimely graves !&#xD;
It is better to live on bread, and earn it, than to be a mile&#xD;
lionaire. Better to have heaped up wealth of Goodness,&#xD;
than many bars of Gold. Poor Tom! Rich you are in&#xD;
what self-seeking men call wealth ; but poor, ah, how poor I&#xD;
in the better having, which whetteth the appetite for know-&#xD;
ledge, and its fruitage, Wisdom, and which sendeth man, at&#xD;
night, to Happy Dream land, upon the viewless pinions of&#xD;
sweet and balmy Sleep ! Every dollar above labor brings ten&#xD;
thousand evils in its train.&#xD;
"Well, night was close at hand, and Tom buried his God,&#xD;
&#xD;
and went home. Home, did I say ?   Not so. He went to&#xD;
his bed, to sleep, and in that sleep he dreamed that it was&#xD;
raining double eagles, while he held his hat beneath the&#xD;
spout. But he was not home, for home is where the heart&#xD;
is, and we have seen the locality of Clark's.&#xD;
"For days, weeks, months, he still worked at his 'Lead,'&#xD;
studiously keeping his own counsel, and managing the affair,&#xD;
from first to last, with the most consummate tact ; so that&#xD;
no one even suspected that the richest man in California, and&#xD;
on the entire continent, was Mr. Thomas W. By degrees&#xD;
he conveyed to, and had vast sums coined at the mint, as&#xD;
agent for some mining companies. A few hogsheads he bu-&#xD;
ried here and there, and springled some dozens of barrels&#xD;
elsewhere about the ground. This he continued to do until&#xD;
at last even his appetite for gold was doubly, triply glutted ;&#xD;
and then he sprung the secret, sold his claim for three mil-&#xD;
lions, cash in hand, and forthwith moved, and set up an esta-&#xD;
blishment close under Telegraph Hill, in the best locality in&#xD;
all Santa Blarneeo.&#xD;
"And now everybody and his wife bowed to Mr. Thomas&#xD;
W., and did homage to-his money. Curious, isn't it, how&#xD;
long some gods will live ?  About three thousand years ago&#xD;
a man of Israel fashioned one out of borrowed jewelry, fash-&#xD;
ioned it in the form of a veal, after which he proclaimed it,&#xD;
and all the human calves fell down straightway, and a good&#xD;
many are still bent on worshipping at the self-same shrine.&#xD;
That calf has retained to this day 'eleven-tenths' of earth's&#xD;
most jealous adoration ! So now did men reverence Clark's&#xD;

money. Women smiled upon him, ambitious spins ers ogled,&#xD;
and hopeful maidens set their caps to enthrall him. He could&#xD;
carry any election, gave tone to the Money Market, reigned&#xD;
supreme and undisputed king on "Change,' and people took&#xD;
him for a happy man ; and so he was, as long as daylight&#xD;
lasted, and he was steadily employed ; but, somehow or&#xD;
other, his nights were devilishly unpleasant ! He could not&#xD;
rest well, for in the silence of the night, when deep sleep fall-&#xD;
eth upon man, an unsheeted ghost passed before his face,&#xD;
bearing a most damnably correct similitude to a former fe-&#xD;
male acquaintance of his, now, alas I deceased ; and not unfre-&#xD;
quently, as he hurried along the streets, did he encounter&#xD;
persons who bore surprising and unmistakable resemblances&#xD;
to the 'dear departed.'&#xD;
"'Black clouds come up, like sinful visions,&#xD;
To distract the souls of solitary men.'&#xD;
"Was Tom Clark mistaken ? Was it Fancy ? Was it&#xD;
Fear ?  . . . One night he went to a theatre, but left it&#xD;
in a hurry, when the actor, who was playing Macbeth, looked&#xD;
straight into his private box and said :&#xD;
"'The times have been that, when the brains were out&#xD;
The man would die--and there an end ;&#xD;
But now they rise again, with twenty mortal murders&#xD;
On their crowns, to push us from our seats!'&#xD;
And the words pushed Clark out, of the house, deadly sick&#xD;
--fearfully pale ; for the avenging furies, roused at last, were&#xD;
&#xD;
at that very moment lashing his guilty soul to madness-&#xD;
and Shakspeare's lines, like double-edged daggers, went&#xD;
plunging, cutting, leaping, flying through every vault and&#xD;
cavern of his spirit. He rushed from the place, reached his&#xD;
house, and now: 'The, bowl, the bowl!3 Wine, give me&#xD;
wine, ruby wine.' They gave it, and it failed ! Stronger drink,&#xD;
much stronger, now became his refuge, and in stupefying&#xD;
his brain he stultified his conscience. His torture was not to&#xD;
last forever, for by dint of debauchery his sensitive soul went&#xD;
to sleep, and the brute man took the ascendant. Conscience&#xD;
slept profoundly. His heart grew case-hardened, cold and&#xD;
callous as an ice-berg. He married a Voice, and a Figure,&#xD;
as heartless as himself ; became a politician-which com-&#xD;
pletely finished him ; but still, several handsome donations to&#xD;
a fashionable church--just think of it!-had, the effect of pro-&#xD;
curing him the reputation of sanctity, which lie he, by dint&#xD;
of repetition, at last prevailed upon himself to believe. Thus&#xD;
we leave him for awhile, and return to the chamber in which&#xD;
was the little window whose upper sash was down.&#xD;

THE DREAM OF BETSEY CLARK.&#xD;
'MADAME, awake, it will be remembered, had come to the&#xD;
conclusion to settle Tom's coffee-and hash, at the same time,&#xD;
with a dose or two of ratsbane, or some similar delicate con-&#xD;
diment; and now, in her dream, she thought all her plans&#xD;
wereso well and surely made as to defy detection, and laugh&#xD;
outright at-failure.&#xD;
" In California there is a small but very troublesome rodent&#xD;
known to Science as *'Pseudo-stoma bursa.rius,' and to the&#xD;
vulgar world as ' gopher '-a sort of burrowing rat, nearly&#xD;
as mischievous and quite as wicked, for the little wretches&#xD;
have a settled and special penchant for boring holes in the&#xD;
ground, particularly in the vicinity of fruit trees. My friend,&#xD;
Mr. Rumford, who has a very fine orchard in Fruit Vale,&#xD;
Contra Costa, just across the bay from Santa Blarneeo, re-&#xD;
cently assured me that the rascals make it a point to destroy&#xD;
young trees, not only without compunction, but even without&#xD;
saying, 'By your leave.' Now it so happened that Clark's&#xD;
place was overstocked with the pestilent animals alluded to,&#xD;
and the proprietors had, time and again, threatened the&#xD;
&#xD;
whole race with extermination, by means of arsenic, phos-&#xD;
phor-paste, or some other effective poison, but had never&#xD;
carried the resolution into practice. This fact was seized on&#xD;
by Mrs. Clark, as a capital point d'appui. Accordingly, with&#xD;
a dull hand-saw, the lady hacked a few dozen of the very&#xD;
choicest young trees, in such a way as to make them look like.&#xD;
unmistakable gopher-work, thus subjecting the brutes to&#xD;
charges whereof phey were as innocent as two unborn babes.&#xD;
Gophers and the Devil have to answer for a great deal that&#xD;
properly belong to other parties. Her act was a grand&#xD;
stroke of policy. She meant that Tom should voluntarily&#xD;
get the poison, which she intended he-not the gophers-&#xD;
should take at the very earliest possible opportunity.  She&#xD;
didn't mean to purchase arsenic-oh, no, she knew too much&#xD;
for that ! The ravage was speedily discovered by Clark. He&#xD;
raved, stamped his foot in his wrath, turned round on his.&#xD;
heel, pulled his cap over his eyes, ejaculated, 'Dod dern 'em !&#xD;
started for the city, and that very night returned, bearer of&#xD;
six bits' worth of the strongest and deadliest kind of poison-&#xD;
quite as deadly, almost as strong, as that which stupid fools&#xD;
drink in corner stores at six cents a glass.&#xD;
"That night about half the poison was mixed and set.&#xD;
Twelve hours thereafter there was great tribulation and&#xD;
mourning in Gopherdom ; for scores of the little gentry ate&#xD;
of' it, liked the flavor, tried a little more-got thirsty-they&#xD;
drank freely (most fools do!) felt uncomfortable, got an-&#xD;
gry, swelled-with indignation and poisoned meal ! and not&#xD;
a few of them immediately (to quote Mr. Clark), 'failed in&#xD;

Alas, poor rodents!'&#xD;
"Next morning Tom's coffee was particularly good. Betsey&#xD;
fairly surpassed herself, in fact she came it rather too strong.&#xD;
About ten- o'clock he felt thirsty, and inclined.toward cold&#xD;
water ; fo.r the weather was hot, and so were his 'coppers,'&#xD;
to quote the 'Ancient Mariner. He would have taken much,&#xD;
water, only that Betsey dissuaded him, and said :'It was&#xD;
just like him, to go and get sick by drinking ever so much&#xD;
cold water! Why didn't he take switchel, or, what wag&#xD;
much better, cold coffee, with. plenty of milk in it,-=and&#xD;
sugar, of. course.;' and so he (Tom) tried her prescription,&#xD;
liked it, took a little more, and that night followed the&#xD;
Gophers !&#xD;
"Three days afterwards a kindly neighbor handed Mrs.&#xD;
Clark a fresh copy of the 'Santa Blarneeo Looking Glass,'&#xD;
wherein she read, with tearful eyes, the following true and&#xD;
veracious account of&#xD;
"'A MOST DISTRESSING AND FATAL SUICIDE I&#xD;
"'We regret to announce -the fearful suicide, while labor-&#xD;
ing under a fit of temporary insanity, caused by the bite of&#xD;
a gopher, of Mr. Thomas W. Clark. It appears, that in or-&#xD;
der to destroy the vermin, he purchased some arsenic, gave&#xD;
some to the animals, got bitten by them, ran stark mad in&#xD;
consequence, and then swallowed the balance (about a pound)&#xD;
himself. His unfortunate wife now lies at the point of death,&#xD;
by reason of the dreadful shock. She is utterly distracted&#xD;
&#xD;
by, the. distressing and heartrending event, which is nall the&#xD;
more poignant from the fact, that probably',no married pair&#xD;
that ever lived were more ardently and devotedly attached&#xD;
than were they. The coroner and a picked jury of twelve&#xD;
men sat for two hours in consultation,' after which they found&#xD;
a verdict of "Death by his own act, while insane' from the&#xD;
bite of a gopher!"&#xD;
"In due time the body of the victim who had been killed&#xD;
so exceedingly dead, by cruel, cold poison--(if it had been&#xD;
warm he might have stood it, but cold !)-was consigned .to&#xD;
the grave-and forgetfulness at the same time ; and after a&#xD;
brief season of mourning, materially assisted before cotnpany&#xD;

no woman on the coast who could equal her in getting up&#xD;
either linen, a dinner, or a quarrel. She excelled all rivals&#xD;
in the really divine art of cooking a husband-beefsteak, I&#xD;
mean. Her pastry and bread were excellent, her tea was&#xD;
fine, and her coffee was all that man could wish, and more&#xD;
so, for it was good--perfectly killing-as we have seen.&#xD;
" Betsey took matters coolly ; was in no apparent hurry,&#xD;
for she had resolved to shoot only at high game, and, accord-&#xD;
ingly, after a time, deigned to smile upon the Reverend Doc-&#xD;
tor Dryasdust, the honored head of the new sect recently&#xD;
sprung up in the land,. and which was known as the 'Wotcher&#xD;
Kawlums,' and who rejoiced in repudiating everything over&#xD;
five years old in the shape of doctrine, tenet and discipline,&#xD;
but who went in strongly for Progress and pantaloons--for&#xD;
women ; for Honduras and the naked truth ; for Socialism&#xD;
and sugar estates ; mahogany and horticulture-a patent&#xD;
sort.&#xD;
"Now, the pastor of this promising body felt that it was,&#xD;
not good for man to be alone, and therefore cast about for a&#xD;
rib whereof to have fashioned a help meet unto him. He saw&#xD;
the widow, fell in love, proposed, was accepted, and in due&#xD;
time she became the wife of the Newlight preacher. I like&#xD;
the old lights best ; she didn't.&#xD;
" Betsey achieved a 'position'-a thing for which her sex&#xD;
almost proverbially sacrifice all they have on earth-happi.&#xD;
ness, health, long life, usefulness. She enjoyed herself quite&#xD;
well, and only two things disturbed her peace of mind:&#xD;
First, she could not bear the smell or sight of coffee, which&#xD;

drink her new lord was strongly addicted to, and insisted -on&#xD;
her making for him with her own hands ; thereby inflicting&#xD;
daily tortures upon her, compared to which all physical pain&#xD;
was pleasure. The second disturbing cause was this : by a&#xD;
very strange fatality their house was overrun with rats, and&#xD;
their garden fairly swarmed with gophers--which, with in-&#xD;
fernal malice and pertinacity, became quite tame, semi-&#xD;
domesticated, and intruded themselves upon her notice a&#xD;
dozen times a day, thereby fetching up from memory's store-&#xD;
house fearful reminiscences of other days-horrible recollec-&#xD;
tions of the gophers of the long-agone. It is hard to be&#xD;
weaned of your fears; nevertheless, after a while she con-&#xD;
quered herself, brazened down her horrors, weighed herself,&#xD;
applied a false logic, tried herself by it, and returned a cleat&#xD;
verdict of 'Justifiable all the way,' and concluded that her&#xD;
present happiness, what there was of it, fairly outweighed the&#xD;
crime by which it had been reached. She was materially&#xD;
justified in her conclusions by an accidental development of&#xD;
character on the part of her present husband, who had, in a&#xD;
fit of petulance, unfolded a leaf from the inner volume of the&#xD;
soul within.&#xD;
" Not caring to recapitulate the whole story (for reticence&#xD;
is sometimes wisdom), I will merely observe that at the end&#xD;
of a somewhat heated controversy, her husband had smashed&#xD;
a mirror, with one of Webster's quarto dictionaries, and&#xD;
roundly declared that he 'preached for pay. Hang it, Ma-&#xD;
dame, the salary's the thing !--you Bet ! How can souls be&#xD;
saved without a salary ? That's a plain question. They are&#xD;
not now, at all events, whatever may have been the case&#xD;

TOM CLARK DREAMS AGAIN.&#xD;

"AND now the Shadow-the terrible, monstrous Thing,&#xD;
that had so strangely entered the room through the window&#xD;
-the little window at the foot of the bed, whose upper sash&#xD;
was down-hovered no longer over the heads of the woman&#xD;
and the man-the unhappy woman, the misery-laden man,&#xD;
who, when the last sun had set, went to bed with Murder and&#xD;
Revenge-and Hatred-this wretched couple, who had con-&#xD;
. templated such dreadful crimes, and who, within the past two&#xD;
hours, had had such strange and marvellous dreams ! Only&#xD;
two hoursI and yet in that space had been crowded the events&#xD;
of a lifetime. They say there are no miracles ! What, then,&#xD;
is this ?  hat are these strange experiences of soul which&#xD;
we are constantly having-fifty years compressed in an hour&#xD;
of ordinary Dream I-thirty thousand ages in a moment of&#xD;
time, while under the accursed spells of Hasheesh?' The soul&#xD;
flying back over unnumbered centuries ; scanning the totality&#xD;
of the Present, and grasping a myriad Futurities-sweeping&#xD;

THE RO8IRUCIAN S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Tom Clark's dream had changed. All the former troubled&#xD;
and exciting scene had vanished into thin air, leaving&#xD;
only vague, dim memories behind, to remind his soul&#xD;
of what it had been, and what it had seen and suffered. In&#xD;
the former dream he had been on dry, solid land ; but&#xD;
now all this was strangely altered, and he found himself&#xD;
tossed on a rough, tumultuous sea ;. his lot was cast upon&#xD;
the deep-upon a wild and dreary waste of waters.    In&#xD;
his dream the rain-great round and heavy drops of rain-&#xD;
fell in torrents ; the mad winds and driving sleet-for the&#xD;
rain froze as it fell--raved and roared fiercely, fitfully; and&#xD;
the good ship bent and bellied to the hurricane, and she&#xD;
groaned as if loath to give up the ghost. And she drove.&#xD;
before the blast, and she plunged headlong into the foaming&#xD;
billows,.and ever and anon shook her head-brave ship ! as&#xD;
if she knew that ruin was before her, and had determined&#xD;
to meet it as a good ship should--bravely, fairly in the face.&#xD;
"I have yet to disbelieve that every perfect work. of man-&#xD;
ship, watch, engine-has a semi-conscious life of its own-a&#xD;
life derived from the immortal soul that gave its idea birth-&#xD;
for all these things-these ships, watches, engines, are ideas,&#xD;
spiritual, subtle, invisible, till man hides their nakedness&#xD;
with wood, iron, steel, brass-the fig-leaves of the Ideal&#xD;
World. Some people cannot feel an idea, or be introduced&#xD;
to one, unless it be dressed up in matter. Sometimes we lay&#xD;
it on paper or canvas, and draw pencil lines around, or color,&#xD;
it, and then it can be seen ; else we take one and plant it&#xD;
out of doors, and then put brick and iron, marble and glass&#xD;
&#xD;
77,&#xD;
&#xD;
sides to 'it, rendering the spirit visible, and then the people&#xD;
see the Idea's Clothing, and fancy they behold the thing&#xD;
itself, just as others, when looking at a human body, imagine&#xD;
they behold the man, the woman, or the child, A mistake I&#xD;
None but God ever yet beheld a human Soul, and this it is,&#xD;
and not the body or its accidents, that constitutes the Ego.&#xD;
" And the ship surged through the boiling seas, and .her&#xD;
timbers strained and cracked in the combat, and her cordage&#xD;
shrieked as the blast tore through, and the tattered sails cried,&#xD;
almost humanly-like a man whose heart is breaking be-&#xD;
cause his wife loves him not, and all the world for him is&#xD;
robed in mourning-and they cried, as if in deadly fear&#xD;
they were craving mercy at the Storm-King's hands. He&#xD;
heard the cries, but he laughed ' ho ! ho!1' and he laughed&#xD;
'ha ! ha!1' and he tore away another sail and hurled it in the&#xD;
sea, laughing madly all the while ; and he blew, and he&#xD;
rattled, and he roared in frightful glee ; and he laughed&#xD;
'ha ! ha!1' and he laughed ' ho ! ho!1' as the bridegroom&#xD;
laughs in triumph.&#xD;

crowned their pallid brows, that the tornado was driving&#xD;
them right straight upon a rock-bound coast-foaming and&#xD;
hopeless for them,-notwithstanding that from the summit of&#xD;
the bold, cliffs, a light-house gleamed forth its eye coldly-&#xD;
cynically .upon the night-in' mockery lighting ,the way to&#xD;
watery death and ruin. Steadily, clearly it glimmered out&#xD;
upon the darkness, distinctly showing them the white 'froth&#xD;

that he is gazing down into your eyes?  How cold is his&#xD;
glance ! how colder his breath ! It is very, very cold. Ah I&#xD;
I shiver as I think-and Death is freezing you, Tom Clark ;&#xD;
-he is freezing your very heart, and turning your blood to&#xD;
ice. He is freezing you, and has tried to freeze me, in va-&#xD;
rious ways. -But I bade him stand back-to stay his breath&#xD;
-for, unlike you, Tom Clark, I am a Brother of the Rosie&#xD;
Cross, and I have been over Egypt, and Syria, and Turkey ;&#xD;
on the borders of the Caspian, and. Arabia's shores; over&#xD;
sterile steppes, and weltered through the ."Deserts-and all&#xD;
in search of the loftier knowledge of the Soul, that can only&#xD;
there be found ; and I found what I sought, Tom Clark--&#xD;
the nature of the Soul, its destiny, and how it may be trained&#xD;
to any end or purpose. And the History and Mystery of&#xD;
Dream, Tom Clark, from the lips of the Oriental Dwellers&#xD;
in the Temple-and Pul Ali Beg-Tom Clark-our Persian&#xD;
Ramus and our lordly Chief-and I learned the worth of&#xD;
Will, and how to say, and mean,-'I will be well, and not&#xD;
sick-alive, and not deadly' and achieve the purpose. How ?&#xD;
That is our secret-the Rosicrucians'-strange order of men ;&#xD;
living all along the ages, till they are ready to die-for Death&#xD;
comes only because man will not beat him back. THEY DIE&#xD;
THROUGH FEEBLENESS OF WILL. But not so with us, -Tom&#xD;
Clark ; we leave not until our work is done, and mine is not&#xD;
yet finished. We exercise our power over others, too, but&#xD;
ever for their good. Well do I remember, how, when I&#xD;
lived in Charlestown, there was an old man dying, but I&#xD;
bade him live. He exists to-day. And long years before&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WAY OF THE WORLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
that, there reached me-lightning borne, on the banks of the&#xD;
Hudson, a message saying, 'Come,she is dying!I' and I went,&#xD;
and stood beside the bed of the sick child, and I prayed, and&#xD;
I invoked the Adonim of the Upper Temple; and they came&#xD;
and bade her live. And she liveth yet-but how ungrateful!&#xD;
" Till our work is done ! What work ? you ask me, and&#xD;
from over the steaming seas I answer, and I tell you through&#xD;
the boundless air that separates us : Our work is to help&#xD;
finish that begun lang syne upon the stony heights of Cal-&#xD;
vary ; in the shade beneath the olive in Gethsemane, where&#xD;
I have stood and wept-begun when Time was thousands of&#xD;
years younger than to-day. Our work, Tom Clark, is to&#xD;
make men, by teaching them   to make themselves. We&#xD;
strive to impress a sense upon the world of the priceless value&#xD;
of a MAN !&#xD;
"And the vessel drove before the gale straight upon the&#xD;
cliff. All hope was at an end ; all hope of rescue was dead.&#xD;
There* was great sorrowing on board that fated bark.&#xD;
Heads were downcast, hearts beat wildly, ears drank in the&#xD;
mournful monody of the scene, and lo ! the strong man lifted&#xD;
up his voice and wept aloud. Did you ever see a man in&#xD;
tears-tears tapped from his very soul ?  When they laugh&#xD;
at his misery, whose lives he has saved ? When he discovers&#xD;
that the man he has loved as a brother, and for whom he has&#xD;
sacrificed his all during long years, was all the while a&#xD;
traitor and a foe, a mean and conscienceless traitor, and a&#xD;
secret, bitter Judas Iscariot, yet wearing a smile on his face&#xD;
continually ? God grant you never may. ~&#xD;

THE ROSIORUCIANS STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The strong man wept ! the very nian,',too, who, a few&#xD;
brief hours before, had heaped up curses, 'for trifling reasons&#xD;
upon the heads of others ; but now, in this hour of agony&#xD;
and mortal terror, fell upon his knees-in the sublime presence&#xD;
of' God's insulted majesty ; who -now, in the- deadly peril,&#xD;
lashed 'to:the pump, ,trembling to his soul's deep centre, cried&#xD;
aloud to Him for--MercyI  God's ears are never deaf ! At&#xD;
that moment one of His Angels-.Sandalphon-the 'Prayer-&#xD;
bearer,. in 'passing by that way, chanced to behold the sub-&#xD;
lime and moving 'spectacle. And his eyes 'flashed gladness,&#xD;
even through his tears ; 'and he could scarcely speak for the&#xD;
deep' emnotion that stirred his angel heart ; but still he point-&#xD;
ed with one hand at the 'prostrate penitent, 'and with  the other&#xD;
he ' placed.'the: golden trumpet to his lips, and blew i blast&#xD;
that woke the sleeping echoes throughout the vast Infinitudes&#xD;
and he cried up, cried up from his very soul: 'Behold! he&#xD;
prayeth!' And the Silence of the upper courts of Heaven&#xD;
started into Sound at the glad announcement, 'Behold I.he&#xD;
prayeth !'. And the, sentence was borne afar on, the fleecy&#xD;
pinions of the Light, from Ashtoreth to Mazaroth, star echo-&#xD;
ing to star. And still the sound. sped on' nor ceased its&#xD;
flight until it struck the pearly Gates of Glory-where was&#xD;
an Angel standing-the.. Recording Angel-writing in a&#xD;
Book; and, oh! kow eagerly he penned the sentence, right&#xD;
opposite Tom  Clark's name.: 'Behold ! he prayeth I' .and&#xD;
the teams--great, hot, scalding tears, such as, at this mo-&#xD;
ment, I am. shedding--rolled out from the angel's eyes, so&#xD;
that he could scarcely see the book-mine own eyes are very&#xD;
y                         y&#xD;
&#xD;
dim-but still he wrote.the words. God grant that 'he may&#xD;
write them;opposite your: name and mine-opposite every-&#xD;
body's, and everybody's son, and daughter-opposite ALL- our&#xD;
names !&#xD;
, "' Behold! he prayeth!,' .And lo! the Angels and the&#xD;
Cherubim, the Seraphs and the Antarphim, caught up the&#xD;
sound, -and sung, through the- Dome ; sung it till it was&#xD;
echoed back from Aidenn's golden walls, from  the East to&#xD;
the West, and the North and South thereof ; until it echoed&#xD;
back in low, melodious cadence from the Veiled Throne, on&#xD;
which sitteth in majesty the Adonai.of Adonim, the peerless&#xD;
and ineffable Over Soul, the gracious Lord of both the Liv-&#xD;
ing and the Dead! Are there any Dead.?  No ! except in&#xD;
sin and guiltiness! . .. And there was much joy in the Starry&#xD;
World over one sinner that had in very truth repented.,&#xD;
"And still the ship drove on, and on, and on-great hear.&#xD;
ven I right on to a shelving ledge of rock, where she was&#xD;
almost instantly dashed into a million fragments ; masts, hull,&#xD;
sails, freight, men, all, all swept and whirled with relentless&#xD;
fury into one common gulf of waters; and yet, despite the din&#xD;
and roar, there rose upon the air, high and:clear, and shrill:&#xD;
The startling shriek-the bubbling cry&#xD;
Of one strong swimmer in his agony.'&#xD;
" And that swimmer was Tom Clark. Thrice had he been&#xD;
thrown by the surf upon a jutting ledge of rock ; thrice had&#xD;
he, with the strength of despair, clung to it, and seized upon&#xD;
the sea-weed growing on its edges, with all the energy of a.&#xD;

THE ROSICRUCIANIS STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
drowning man. In vain ; .the relentless sea swept him off&#xD;
again, broke his hold, and whirled him back into the brine.&#xD;
His strength was almost gone ; exhaustion was nigh at&#xD;
hand ; and he floated, a helpless, nerveless mass at the mercy&#xD;
of the tide. And yet, so wonderful a thing is a human soul !&#xD;
-in that dreadful moment, when Hope -herself was dead,&#xD;
and he was about to quit forever and forever this earth of&#xD;
sin and sorrow, and yet an earth so fair and bright, so lovely&#xD;
and so full of love, teeming so with all that is heroic and&#xD;
true, so friendly and so kind ; his soul, even then, his pre-&#xD;
cious and immortal soul, just pluming its wings for a flight&#xD;
to the far-off regions of the Living Dead-that soul for&#xD;
which God Himself had put forth all His redemptive energy&#xD;
-had abundant time to assert its great prerogative, and bid&#xD;
Death himself a haughty, stern defiance. With the speed&#xD;
of Light his mental vision flashed back along and over the&#xD;
valley of the dead years, and saw arrayed before it all the&#xD;
strange phasmaramas of the foretime. Deeds, Tioughts, and&#xD;
Intuitions never die ! They are as immortal as the impe-&#xD;
rishable souls that give them life and being !&#xD;
" And in that wondrous vision Tom Clark was young&#xD;
again ; his childhood, youth, maturity ; his sins, sorrows,&#xD;
virtues, and his aspirations, all, all were there, phototyped&#xD;
upon the walls of the mystic lane through which his soul&#xD;
was gazing-a lane not ten inches long, yet stretching away&#xD;
into the immeasurable deeps of a vast Infinitude. A Para-&#xD;
dox ! I am speaking of the Soul !-a thing whereof we&#xD;
talk so much, and know so very little.&#xD;
&#xD;
85&#xD;
&#xD;
" The spectres of all his hours were there; painted on the&#xD;
Wall of Memory's curved lane ; his joys, his weary days of&#xD;
grief-few of the first, many of the latter-were there, like&#xD;
green and smiling oases, standing out in quick relief against&#xD;
the desert of his life. His anxious eyes became preternatu-&#xD;
rally acute, and seemed to take cognizance both of fact and&#xD;
cause-effect and principle at the same glance. His mar-&#xD;
riage life-even to its minutest circumstance-stood revealed&#xD;
before him. He saw Betsoy as she had been-a girl, spot-&#xD;
less, artless, intelligent, ambitious ; beheld her married ; then&#xD;
saw her as she was when she joined her lot with his own.&#xD;
He beheld her as she had become-anything but a true wife&#xD;
and woman, for only her surface had been reached by either&#xD;
husband. There was a fountain they had neither tapped nor&#xD;
known. Her heart had been touched, indeed ; but her soul,&#xD;
never. He was amazed to find that a woman can give more&#xD;
than a husband is supposed to seek and find. More, did I&#xD;
say? My heaven ! not one man in ten thousand can think&#xD;
of a line and plummet long enough to fathom the vast ocean&#xD;
of a woman's affection ; cannot imagine the height and&#xD;
depths-the unfathomable riches of a woman's Love. Not&#xD;
a peculiar woman's-but any, every woman's love ; your sis-&#xD;
ter's, sir, or your wife's, sir, or mine, or anybody's sister or&#xD;
wife-anybody's daughter.&#xD;
" It appeared to Clark's vision that a vast deal of his time&#xD;
had been worse than wasted, else had he devoted a portion&#xD;
of it to the attentive study of the woman whom  he had, in&#xD;
the presence of God and man, sworn to love, honor, and&#xD;

wife, and no man can love his wife- unless he carefully studies&#xD;
her nature; .and he cannot study her nature unless he ren-&#xD;
ders himself lovable,: and thus calls out her love ;- and until&#xD;
her love is thus called out, the office of husband is a suicidal&#xD;
sham. Thus saith the canons of the Rosicrucian philosophy.&#xD;
Are they bad ?&#xD;
And he gazed in -the depths of her spirit, surprised be-&#xD;
yond measure to find that God had planted so many goodly&#xD;
flowers therein-even in virago Betsey's soul ! And he said&#xD;
to himself--as many another husband will, before a hundred&#xD;
years roll by-' What a precious fool I've been ! spending&#xD;
all my-time in cultivating thistles-getting pricked and curs-&#xD;
ing them-when roses smellso very well, and are -so easily&#xD;
raised ? fool ! I wish'----and he blamed his folly for not&#xD;
having nurtured roses-for not having duly cultivated the&#xD;
rich garden God had intrusted him with ; execrated himself'&#xD;
for not having cherished and nursed this garden, and availed&#xD;
himself of its golden, glorious fruitage. It was as a man who&#xD;
had willfully left down the bars for;the free entrance of his&#xD;
neighbor's cattle, and then wondering that his harvest of hay&#xD;
was not quite so heavy as desired... Clark saw that it had&#xD;
been in his power-as it unquestionably is in that of every&#xD;
married man-by a few kind acts, a few tender, loving words,&#xD;
to have thawed and melted forever the ice collected by ill-&#xD;
usage-and every woman is ill-used who is not truly, purely)&#xD;
loyally lovedI He saw that he might easily have warmed&#xD;
her spirit toward himself, therefore toward the world, and&#xD;
&#xD;
consequently toward the Giver. He might have made their&#xD;
life a constant summer-time-that very life that had been by&#xD;
his own short-sighted externalism, confirmed into freezing,&#xD;
stormy, chilling winter.&#xD;
" Wheat and lentils I have seen in Egypt, taken from a&#xD;
mummy's hand, where they had lain three thousand and four&#xD;
hundred years. Some of that wheat I still possess ; some of&#xD;
it I planted in a flower-pot, and it forthwith sprung up, green&#xD;
and beautiful, into life and excellence. The mummy's hand&#xD;
was crisp,. the tombs of Beni-Hassan were not the places for&#xD;
wheat to grow, for they are very dry. Do you see the point,&#xD;
the place-the thing I am  aiming at ?  It is to show that&#xD;
the ills of marriage life are to be corrected not by a recourse&#xD;
to law-courts and referees, but by each party resolutely try-&#xD;
ing to correct them in the heart, the head, the home. An-&#xD;
other thing I aim at is to seal the lips-to strike to the earth&#xD;
the brawlers for Divorce-the breakers-up of families, who&#xD;
preach-or prate of-what they have neither brains to com-&#xD;
prehend, nor manhood to appreciate-Marriage !&#xD;
" Clark saw, in the soul of his wife, in an, instant, that which&#xD;
takes me an hour to describe ; for the soul sees faster than&#xD;
the hand can indite, or the lips utter. He beheld many a&#xD;
gem, pure and translucent as a crystal, shut up in the caverns&#xD;
of her nature ; shut up, and barred from the light, all the&#xD;
while yearning for day. What seeds of good, what glorious&#xD;
wheat was there. The milk of human kindness had been&#xD;
changed to ice-froth-sour, and sugar-less, not fit to be&#xD;
tasted. Inestimable qualities had been left totally unre-&#xD;

stead of the cruel and the bitter. He saw, what every husband&#xD;
ought to see-but don't-that no woman can be truly known&#xD;
who is not truly loved 1-and that, too, not with mere lip-&#xD;
homage, nor with nervous, muscular, demonstrative, show-&#xD;
love-for no female on the earth but will soon detect all such&#xD;
-and reckon you up accordingly-at your proper value-&#xD;
&#xD;

A CHEAP BOOK AND A GOOD ONE.              89&#xD;
less than a straw ! She demands true homage, right straight&#xD;
from the heart ; from the bottom of the heart-whence&#xD;
springs the rightful homage due from man to woman-right&#xD;
straight from  the heart-without deflection. Mind this.&#xD;
Give her that, and ah, then, then, what a heaven is her pre-&#xD;
sence I and what a fullness she returns I compound interest, a&#xD;
thousand-fold repeated !-a fullness of affection so great that&#xD;
God's love only exceedeth it !-a love so rich and vast, that&#xD;
man's soul can scarce contain the half thereof. This truth&#xD;
I know. This truth I tell, because it is such. You will&#xD;
bless me for it by-and-by, when I am Over the River-if&#xD;
not before-will bless and thank me-despite of what 'They&#xD;
say.' Remember that !&#xD;
"Tom Clark was drowning, yet he realized all this. He&#xD;
regretted that he had treated his wife as if she were soulless,&#xD;
or a softer sort of man. He could have so managed as to&#xD;
have been all the world to Betsey-all the world, and some-&#xD;
thing more and better, for there are leaves in wedlock's book&#xD;
which only those can turn and read who' truly love each&#xD;
other. Marriage is, to some, a coarse brown paper volume,&#xD;
with rough binding, bad ink, and worse type, poorly com-&#xD;

" He saw, as he floated there in the brine, that he had&#xD;
never done aught to call out his wife's affection, in which he&#xD;
resembled many another whiskered ninny, who insanely expect&#xD;
women to doat upon them merely because they happen to be&#xD;
married. Dolts ! Not one in a host comprehends woman's&#xD;
nature ; not one in two hosts will take the trouble to find it&#xD;
out ; consequently, not one man in three hosts but goes down&#xD;
to the grave never havin  tasted life's best nectar-that of&#xD;
loving and being foe   '&#xD;

" Profound ejaculation !&#xD;
"'I've been an out-and-out fool t'&#xD;
" Sublime discovery !&#xD;
"Thus thought the dying man, in the dreadful hour of his&#xD;
destiny-that solemn hour wherein the soul refuses to be&#xD;
longer enslaved or deceived by the specious warp and woof&#xD;
of the sophistical robe it may have voluntarily worn through&#xD;
man a ear, all the while believing it to be Truth, as some&#xD;
peop e do Davis' and Joe Smith's 'Philosophy.' It is not till&#xD;
a dose of Common Sense has caused us to eject from our&#xD;
moral stomachs the nice philosophical sweetmeats we have&#xD;
indulged in for years, until at last they have disturbed our&#xD;
digestion-sweets, very pleasant to the palate-like the 'All&#xD;
Right-ism ' of the 'Hub of the Universe'-but which, like&#xD;
boarding-bouse hash, is very good in small quantities-seldom&#xD;

his eyes-the same that blinds so many of us during the hey-&#xD;
day and vigor of life.&#xD;
"'If I could be spared, Betsey, I'd be a better man.'&#xD;
"Bravo ! Glorious Thomas Clark!I Well said, even&#xD;
though the waters choke thine utterance.&#xD;
" I would. 0 wife, I begin to see your value, and what&#xD;
a treasure I have lost-lost--lost!'&#xD;
" And the poor dying wretch struggled against the brine-&#xD;
struggled bravely, fiercely to keep off the salt death--the&#xD;
grim, scowling Death that had sat upon the taiffrail ; that&#xD;
had stalked about the deck, and stood at the cabin door ;&#xD;
the-same:fearful Death that had whistled through the rigging,&#xD;
and ridden on the storm, and which had followed but had not&#xD;
yet touched him with his cold and icy sceptre."&#xD;

Many could successfully withstand any amount of qualms of&#xD;
conscience-but those of the stomach were quite a different&#xD;

yearnings toward  "New   York," and   many "reachings&#xD;

rough, that scarce one of us in the cabin fully enjoyed our&#xD;
breakfasts. As for me, I'm very fond of mush and molasses,&#xD;
but I really couldn't partake thereof on that occasion. No,&#xD;
sir ! The gentleman from Africa who stood behind us at&#xD;
table to minister to our gustatory wants, found his office a&#xD;
perfect sinecure that morning ; and both I and the Rosicru-&#xD;
cian, in whose welfare that official took an especial interest&#xD;
-because, in a fit of enthusiasm, we had each given him four&#xD;
bits (ten dimes)-seemed to challenge his blandest pity and&#xD;
commiseration, for we both sat there, looking as if we had&#xD;
been specially sent for and couldn't go. The waiter-kind&#xD;
waiter !-discerned, by a wonderful instinct, that we didn't&#xD;
feel exactly " 0 fat," and he therefore, in dulcet tones, tried&#xD;
to persuade us to take a litle coffee. Coffee ! Only think&#xD;
of it ! Just after Mrs. Thomas W. had poisoned her hus-&#xD;
band through that delectable medium. He suggested pork !&#xD;
" Pork, avaunt ! We're sea-sick." " Beef." Just then I had&#xD;
a splendid proof of Psychological infiltration and transmis&#xD;

ceived a strong inipression-which we directly followed-to&#xD;
arise from our seats, go on deck, and look over the lee raii.&#xD;

to the tale-and doubtless these pages will fall in the hands&#xD;
of many who heard it reported from his own lips, on the&#xD;
quarter-deck of the steamer "Uncle Sam," during. the&#xD;
voyage begun from San Francisco to Panama, on the&#xD;
twenty-first day of November, 1861. At first his auditors&#xD;
were about ten in number, but when he rose to look at the&#xD;
crimson glories of the sky, fifty people were raptly listen.&#xD;
ing. We adjourned till the next day, when, as agreed upon&#xD;
the night before, we convened, and for some time awaited&#xD;
his appearance. At last he came, looking somewhat ill,&#xD;
for we were crossing the Gulf of California, and Boreas&#xD;
and Neptune had been elevating Robert, or in plainer&#xD;
English, " Kicking up a bobbery," all night long. We had&#xD;
at least a thousand passengers aboard, consisting of all sorts&#xD;

&#xD;
THE ROSICUCIAN'S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Toward the trysting time, however, the sea smoothed its&#xD;
wrinkles, and the waters smiled again. Presently the ex-&#xD;
pected one came, took his accustomed seat, and began the&#xD;
conclusion of&#xD;
TOM CLARK2S DREAM&#xD;
"There's a tide in the affairs of men, which,&#xD;
Taken at the flood, leads on to fortune."&#xD;
SHAKSPEARE.&#xD;
" There's a tide in the affairs of women, which,&#xD;
Taken at the flood, leas---God knows where."&#xD;
BYRON.&#xD;
" Neither do I !  Last night, my friends, we left poor&#xD;
Tom in a desperate situation, from which it seems necessary&#xD;
that I should relieve him, but really without exactly know-&#xD;
ing how-not feeling particularly well from the motion of the&#xD;
ship last night, it is not easy to think under such circum-&#xD;
stances ; still, believing as I do, in the sterling motto, Try,&#xD;
why, I will endeavor to gratify your curiosity, especially as I&#xD;
perceive we are honored with the presence of the ladies, and,&#xD;
for their sakes, if not for our own, I feel it incumbent to do&#xD;
something for him.&#xD;
"Tom   Clark had, by the waves, been already taken in,&#xD;
and by this time was nearly done for, so far as easy breath-&#xD;
ing was concerned.    Slowly, but surely, his vision was&#xD;
fading away, and he felt that he was fast sinking into Night.&#xD;
"'Deep the gulf that hides the dead-&#xD;
Long and dark the road they tread.'&#xD;
&#xD;
That road he felt that he was rapidly going ; for his senses&#xD;
were becoming numb, and a nauseant sensation proved that&#xD;
if he was not sea-sick, he was remarkably sick of the sea,&#xD;
even to the point of dissolution.&#xD;
"All dying persons hear musical sounds : all dying persons&#xD;
see strange, fitful gleams of marvellous light, and so did&#xD;
Thomas Clark-low, sweet music and soft and pearly light&#xD;
it was, but while he drank it in, and under its influence was.&#xD;
being reconciled to Death, there suddenly rose high and&#xD;
shrill above the midnight tempest, a loud and agonizing&#xD;
shriek-the wild, despairing, woeful shriek of a woman-and&#xD;
it was more shrill and piercing than the ziraleet of Egyptian&#xD;
dame or Persian houri ; and it broke upon the ear of the&#xD;
perishing man, like a summons back to life and hope. Well&#xD;
and instantly did he recognize its tones. 'It must be-yet&#xD;
no !-still it can be no other than her v-voice ! It cannot&#xD;
be-and I am dy-ing !' and an angry wave dashed over him,&#xD;
drowning his utterance, and hurling his body, like a wisp of&#xD;
straw, high upon the ledge of rocks, whence the recoil, or&#xD;
undertow, was about to whirl it out again into the foaming&#xD;
waters, when it was prevented by a most wonderful piece of&#xD;
good fortune, which at that instant, intervened to save him,&#xD;
at what certainly was the most interesting and critical junc-&#xD;
ture of his entire earthly existence. Again that sharp voice&#xD;
rang out upon the storm, and a hand, small, soft, yet nerved&#xD;
with all a woman's desperate energy-desperate in Love t&#xD;
clutched him by the hair, and dragged-triumphantly-&#xD;
dragged him to the hard and solid land, just over the ledge,&#xD;

&#xD;
on a winding path at the foot of the overhanging cliff. It&#xD;
was Betsey Clark's voice; it was Betsey Clark's hand; it was&#xD;
she who saved him ; and thus he received a new lease of life&#xD;
at the hands of the very woman whom, in a former dream,&#xD;
he had sent so gaily sailing down the empty air-down&#xD;
through four hundred feet of unobstructed   space--with&#xD;
boulders at the bottom-solid boulders of granite and quartz&#xD;
--gold-bearing quartz at that, and very rich, too, but still&#xD;
quite solid and considerably harder than was agreeable to&#xD;
either the woman, the buggy, or the horse, for not one of&#xD;
them was&#xD;
'Soft as downy pillows are'-&#xD;
not even Governor Downie's of California.&#xD;
"It was, indeed, his wife's voice that he heard; it was she&#xD;
that rescued him from what, in very truth, was a most unfor.&#xD;
tunate pickle-or brine-as you choose, or botk-but at all&#xD;
events one into which he would never have got had he not&#xD;
been far greener than a cucumber.&#xD;
" In a dream strange things come to pass. And in strict&#xD;
accordance with the proprieties of that weird life and Realm&#xD;
-a life and Realm no less real than weird-Tom was speed-&#xD;
ily cared for, and emptied of the overplus of salt water he&#xD;
had involuntarily imbibed, while Mrs. Clark carefully at-&#xD;
tended upon him, and a score or two of good people busied&#xD;
themselves in saving all they could from the wreck. After&#xD;
this they all retreated to a comfortable mansion, situated on&#xD;
the summit of this cliff, in the regions of Dream, and there&#xD;
the following explanations took place : It appeared that Bet.&#xD;
&#xD;
sey had been on a visit to her uncle, who kept the light-&#xD;
house, and had for several days been on the look-out for the&#xD;
arrival of the vessel-the wrecked one--in which, some time&#xD;
previous, Tom had sailed on a voyage to Honey-Lu-Lu, the&#xD;
Bay of Fun-dee, or some other such place that vessels trade to.&#xD;
The ship had at last been descried, laboring in the midst of&#xD;
a violent storm, just before dark, and under such circum-&#xD;
stances as rendered it positively certain that she would drive&#xD;
headlong upon the rocks at the foot of the very cliff on which&#xD;
the light-house stood.&#xD;
"But by a singular coincidence, perfectly unaccountable&#xD;
anywhere else, save in Dream-land, Betsey Clark had learned&#xD;
to love Tom dearly, at the precise instant that he had dis-&#xD;
covered, and repented his own great error. At the instant&#xD;
that Tom had declared that, could he be spared, he would&#xD;
be a better man, she saw his deadly peril ; the icicles be-&#xD;
gan to melt around her heart-.melt very fast-so that by&#xD;
the time she reached him her soul was in a glow of pure affec-&#xD;
tion for the man she had until that moment hated. She now&#xD;
saw, with unmitigated astonishment, that, with all his faults,&#xD;
there was a mine of excellent goodness ; that God had not&#xD;
made anything either perfect or imperfect ; and that, after&#xD;
all was said or done, he was of priceless consequence and&#xD;
value to her.&#xD;
" Human nature and woman nature are very remarkable&#xD;
institutions, especially the latter. We seldom value either a&#xD;
man or woman, until they are either dead or a long way off,&#xD;
and then-' Who'd a' thought it ?'&#xD;

THE ROSICRUCIAN'S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
AN EPISODE.&#xD;
&#xD;
99&#xD;
&#xD;
" When Clark awoke from the gentle sleep into which he&#xD;
had fallen after the kind people had made him comfortable,&#xD;
he found his head gillo wed on a bosom a great deal softer&#xD;
than down or Downie's-that of his loving and tender wife&#xD;
-for she was so now, and no mistake, in the full, true sense&#xD;
--A Wife!&#xD;
"Tom Clark got well. He never grew rich, and never&#xD;
wanted to. He went to Santa Blarneeo, and had both their&#xD;
pictures taken in a single frame, on one canvas, and he hung&#xD;
it over the window in the little room-the little window at&#xD;
the foot of the bed, whose upper sash was down.&#xD;
"Years rolled by. Long did they live in the enjoyment of&#xD;
a domestic bliss too great for expression or description-a&#xD;
happiness unsullied by an unworthy thought, unstained by&#xD;
any blot ; for it was full, pure, husbandly, wifely ; and daily,&#xD;
hourly, did they bless and learn to love each other more.&#xD;
"' Cease dreaming,' said Hesperina--the beautiful Hespe.&#xD;
rina, the, Genius of the .Garden and the Star--' cease thy&#xD;
dream, of Perpetual Pvace, and live to actualize it on thy&#xD;
way through the World ! Cease dreaming, but awaken not.&#xD;
Remember the counsel of Otanethi, the radiant, Lord. of the&#xD;
Temple, the Spirit of the Hour ; and when thou wakest, TRY&#xD;
to be a nobler and a better man. Waken not yet, 0 frail&#xD;
and weak ! but still sleep-sweetly, soundly sleep, yet awhile,&#xD;
and only wake to be a full, true, loving man, forgiving&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
and forgiven!i' And then the peerless being waved her&#xD;
hand over the prostrate woman, and, lo ! her movements&#xD;
gave token that the strange and mighty magic was felt, and&#xD;
that she was swiftly passing the mystic Threshold of that&#xD;
sphere of new and marvellous activities where the Dream&#xD;
Fay reigns supreme."&#xD;
At this point of the story, a lady, Mrs. V., invoked the&#xD;
narrator's attention, saying : " Thus far, sir, your story is an&#xD;
excellent one, and its moral is all that could be desired ; yet&#xD;
how comes it that you, who so strongly deprecate all human&#xD;
hatreds and unkindness, are yet, in a measure, amenable to&#xD;
the very thing you decry ? In the proem to the remarkabl9&#xD;
story you have been reciting, you have admitted that there&#xD;
was one man toward whom your soul felt bitter. Is .this&#xD;
right ? Is it just to yourself, your foe, the world, or God?&#xD;
Answer me 1"&#xD;
The Rosicrucian studied awhile, and then replied : " It&#xD;
is not right or just, and yet it is very hard to forgive, much&#xD;
less to forget, a cool, deliberate injury, such as I suffered at&#xD;
the pen, and hand, and tongue of the man alluded to. It is&#xD;
hard to forget "- .&#xD;
" And still harder to forgive," said one of our company, a&#xD;
rather young-looking man, who had been one of the speaker's&#xD;
most attentive auditors. He spoke with much passion.&#xD;
Said the Stranger : " It is hard to forgive or forget. Few&#xD;
people in the world are capable of long-continued love in a&#xD;
single direction, unless self-trained ; fewer still of deliberate,&#xD;
-continued hatred, and fewer still are competent to full,&#xD;

free, unqualified forgiveness. I am not. In all my experience,&#xD;
I never knew but one man in whom unqualified Hatred was&#xD;
a paramount King-passion, over-riding and surviving all others&#xD;
whatsoever. I will tell you that man's story as he told it to&#xD;
me, for he was a friend of mine whom I dearly loved, and&#xD;
who loved me in return. One day I asked him to open his&#xD;
heart to me, which, after a while, he did as follows, saying:&#xD;
'Listen, while I briefly sketch the story of my life. There&#xD;
was a man who, because I differed with him on questions of&#xD;
Philosophy-for he claimed to be Nature's private secretary,&#xD;
which claim all sensible people laughed at, and only weaklings&#xD;
listened to and believed-he, this man, for this cause, called&#xD;
in question, not only my own, but the fair fame of the mother&#xD;
who bore me-that mother being already dead ; and for this&#xD;
I hate him, as roses hate the foul malarious swamps of earth.&#xD;
The blazoned motto of that man was-Let no man call God&#xD;
his Father, who calls not man his brother. I. rose in the&#xD;
world, and he hated me for the talent God gave me. Envy !&#xD;
I was in a sense his rival, and as such, this man, snake-like,&#xD;
used his very utmost influence and power, by tongue and&#xD;
pen, to injure me-and did-for he took the bread from my&#xD;
children by depriving meof employment. I wrote a pamphlet,&#xD;
under a noon de plume, and he joyfully exposed my secret.&#xD;
Jealousy ! He attacked me personally, grossly in his paper,&#xD;
misrepresented well known facts-LIEDI Robbing me of fair&#xD;
fame, as he had my dead mother before me. It is impossible&#xD;
for 4. to forgive B for a crime against C. I hated him for the&#xD;
dead one's sake ; that hate I once thought would survive my&#xD;
&#xD;
death, and be the thing next my heart through all the Eter-&#xD;
nities. Perhaps it will not. He crushed me for a time, but&#xD;
" Je renais de mes cendres !" We two are yet in the World.&#xD;
He will not forget it ! Will I ?  Never !-for the sake of&#xD;
my dead mother. I can overlook his crimes toward me,&#xD;
but. before the Bar I hold him ever accountable for the injury&#xD;
to her-and to my little ones, who nearly starved, while this&#xD;
fiend of hell, in the garb of heaven, triumphed in my misery,&#xD;
and gloated over their wrongs. I am the watchful proxy-&#xD;
the rightful Nemesis, of the living and the Dead ! I put forth&#xD;
books to the world. This demon in saint's garb, and his&#xD;
minions, howled them down as bloodhounds .do the panting&#xD;
slave. More bread lost to my hungry' ones, more stern&#xD;
calling for reprisals. All men have foes. I had ; and this&#xD;
man--this impostor, this conscienceless outrager of the dead&#xD;
and starver of little children, listened gladly, and covertly&#xD;
published their statements-and that when he morally knew&#xD;
them to be as false as his own black, polygamous, scoundrel&#xD;
heart. More wrong done, more little pale hands reaching&#xD;
vainly forth for bread ; and more hatred laid up for him and&#xD;
his minions at the bottom of my heart of hearts, the core and&#xD;
centre of my soul!'&#xD;
"Thus he spake, and the man's eyes flashed fire as the&#xD;
words escaped him, proving that they were not the impulsive&#xD;
utterances of temper, but the deep and cherished results of&#xD;
tong and bitter years of feeling. Said I : 'And does this&#xD;
feeling demand a physical atonement?' With a look of&#xD;
ineffable scorn, he replied: ' Not for an empire's sceptre&#xD;

would I harm a single hair of that man's head. Were his&#xD;
wife in a burning building, I would rescue her, or perish in&#xD;
the trial ; were his children-but, thank God, he cannot&#xD;
propagate his species--Monsters never do !-but had he such,&#xD;
and they were hungry, I would work till I fell from exhaus.-&#xD;
tion, in the effort to procure them bread : vere the man him-&#xD;
self in want or danger, I would joyously risk my life to save&#xD;
or serve him. Why ?  Because my revenge is one that could&#xD;
not be appeased by blood. It is too vast-too deep-and I&#xD;
will wreak it in other worlds, a myriad ages from now. To&#xD;
this I pledge my. very soul ; and when hereafter I point him&#xD;
to what I am, and what he has brought me to, I will thun-&#xD;
der, in the ears of his spirit, in the very presence of the Judge,&#xD;
" THOU ART THE MAN !" Wherever he may be, in the Vault,&#xD;
or in the Space, there will I be also. Nor can this feeling&#xD;
die before he shall undo his doing, and-no matter what. At&#xD;
length this feeling of mine grew strong. I loved. It drowned&#xD;
all love. I was ambitious, and ambition paled before it. I&#xD;
had wealth within my reach, and turned from the shining gold&#xD;
to the superior brilliance of the pole star of my passion against&#xD;
the soul of this man, not against his body. And then I said:&#xD;
--I will rise from my ashes. I will win fame and name.&#xD;
I, the Angular Character, will rise, and in my dealings with&#xD;
this fiend will be as remorseless and bitter as the quintessence&#xD;
of Hate ; I will suffer patiently, and mount the steeps of&#xD;
fame, and I will ring the bells at the door of the world till all&#xD;
the peoples wake, and then, then will I launch him down the&#xD;
tide of time in his own true colors-stripped to the centre, and&#xD;
&#xD;
show him to the Ages for the monster that he is. This is a&#xD;
revenge worthy of an immortal being ; one that merely ex-&#xD;
tends to the physical person is such as brutes enjoy, but is not&#xD;
full, broad, deep and enduring enough for a man. As for his&#xD;
minions they are too contemptible to engage my attention for&#xD;
a moment ; but in their master's soul will I fix my talons so&#xD;
deep, that an eternity shall not witness their extraction ; and&#xD;
henceforth I dedicate all my life to the one purpose of aveng-&#xD;
ing the dead !'&#xD;
Five years rolled by after this recital, when again, in a&#xD;
foreign land, we met each other. In the meantime he had&#xD;
grown grey. His foe still attacked him ; he had never once&#xD;
replied, but his hatred had crystallized in the centre of his&#xD;
soul, and, said he, 'I can wait a million years ; but revenged&#xD;
I will be yet, by the Life of God !' That is my story ; £be.-&#xD;
leve my friend will keep his oath," said the young man as he&#xD;
turned from the company on the quarter-deck, and slowly&#xD;
walked toward the bow of the steamer.&#xD;
The words he had spoken were bitter ones, and they were&#xD;
expressed with such a verve-such a vehemence of vigor, in-&#xD;
tensity and passion, that not one man or woman on the&#xD;
quarter-deck of the steamer doubted for an instant that him-&#xD;
self was the injured one, himself the vehement hater, not-&#xD;
withstanding his implied disclaimer. We saw that he fully,&#xD;
deeply, felt all he gave utterance to ; and never, until that&#xD;
Moment, did I comprehend the awful depths and capacity of&#xD;
the human soul for either love or hatred ; nor had any of us,&#xD;
even the Rosicrucian, the faintest idea but that every word&#xD;

104         THE ROSICRUCIAN'S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
of his awful threat came from his heart ; nor the slightest&#xD;
doubt that if there were a possibility of wreaking his revenge&#xD;
in the World to come, that he would find that possibility,&#xD;
and remorselessly execute it. Said the Rosicrucian, as. the&#xD;
man finished his terrible recital: "This episode comes in&#xD;
quite apropos to my own story's moral. It is well to beware,&#xD;
lest we, by some act or word of ours, so deeply plant the&#xD;
germ of hatred, that in after years it spring up to annoy us,&#xD;
and mar our peace of mind. Now, I have some knowledge&#xD;
of the soul, and am firmly convinced that the man who has&#xD;
just left us means all that he says ; nor would I incur so&#xD;
dreadful a penalty as that man's hatred, for all the diadems&#xD;
on the terraqueous globe. His passion is not merely exter-&#xD;
nal, else he would, by an assault, or by slander, seek its&#xD;
satisfaction. But his feeling is the offspring of a sense of&#xD;
outraged justice. I have not the least doubt that the object&#xD;
of his spleen laughs at the man. But Revenge will outlive&#xD;
laughter, wealth, position, influence-all things, when of the&#xD;
nature of the present case. Thus, Madame, your question, I&#xD;
hope, has been answered to your satisfaction. Of course, I&#xD;
deprecate hatred, but demand justice.&#xD;
" But see, the sun is setting again, and the conclusion of&#xD;
our story must be deferred until after supper, when, if you&#xD;
will again assemble here upon the quarter-deck, you shall&#xD;
learn what befell Mr. Thomas W., and what other events&#xD;
transpired in the little chamber with a window at the foot&#xD;
of the bed, whose upper dash- was down."&#xD;

BETSEY CLARK IN DREAM-LAND.&#xD;
Could I with ink the ocean fill,&#xD;
were all the earth of parchment made ;&#xD;
Were every blade of grass a quill,&#xD;
And every man a scribe by trade-&#xD;
To tell the love of God above&#xD;
would drain the briny oceans dry :&#xD;
Nor would a scroll contain the whole,&#xD;
Though covering all the arching sky."&#xD;
"I BELIEVE just as did the writer of these lines," said the&#xD;
Rosicrucian, as he began his recital in the cabin of the&#xD;
" Uncle Sam," after partaking of what the purveyors of that&#xD;
steamship line, in the rich exuberance of their facetious ima-&#xD;
ginations were pleased to call a supper.&#xD;
"Betsey Clark was dreaming : It was morning, and the&#xD;
glorious face of the sun shone in unclouded splendor over the&#xD;
world-this world, which, to the good man and woman, is&#xD;
ever a world of Good and Beauty, viewed from the God-side,&#xD;
whatever it may be from the human. All things were prais-&#xD;
ing Him--at least all dumb things were, for men so intently&#xD;
adore their Lares and Penates-Dollars and Dimes-that&#xD;

&#xD;
they have scarcely time to devote a worshipful thought to&#xD;
Him who is King of kings, and regnant God of gods.&#xD;
"Nature was arrayed in gala robes ; she had put aside her&#xD;
frowns, and now smiled sweetly on the world, decked gaily&#xD;
in pearls and light ; she was on her way to attend the wed-&#xD;
dings of the flowers and the birds. Betsey Clark was a&#xD;
blythe young girl again. In her dream she was gaily trip-&#xD;
ping o'er the lea, her happy heart swelling and palpitating&#xD;
with strange emotions-she was a budding virgin now, and&#xD;
her heart overflowed with innocence and love, accompanied&#xD;
with that pure, but strange, wild discontent, and longing&#xD;
for, she knew not what, but something, which all young wo-&#xD;
men feel, and are conscious of, as they pass the golden bar-&#xD;
rier that divides their youth from womanhood. It is, and&#xD;
was, the holy and chaste desire to love, and be loved in re-&#xD;
turn-from the heart, sir, right straight from the heart !&#xD;
Ah, how I sometimes wish I had been created a girl instead&#xD;
of a boy. Bah! What's the use of wishing ? especially&#xD;
when all the girls desire an opposite transmigration.&#xD;
" Betsey's bloom outrivalled the blushes of the newly-wed-&#xD;
ded roses-roses just married to sunlight, in the morning&#xD;
dew, with all the trees for witnesses, and all the birds to&#xD;
swell the sounding chorus ! And she was happy ; ah, how&#xD;
full of happiness ! and yet it was slightly dashed with bitter&#xD;
ness-just a taste of gall in her cup of honey-for she ima-&#xD;
gined a more perfect state, had vague dreamings of some-&#xD;
thing still higher. So have we all. We have it ! and that&#xD;
is a certain sign that that higher something is attainable, if&#xD;
&#xD;
ly. try. Some one said he wanted to eat his friend.&#xD;
Good , but I want to lose myself in another self-to make&#xD;
of them twain a unit, which is better ! or to thus blend, and&#xD;
then lose ourself in the great God-life, which is Best !&#xD;
"And she gaily tripped over the lea. She was going with&#xD;
a pitcher of cream, and a basket of fresh eggs, toward a hole&#xD;
in the rock, not a great way off, to present them to the strange&#xD;
' Hermit of the Silver Girdle,' who dwelt within a little&#xD;
grotto just upon the edge of a forest wild, hard by her girl-&#xD;
hood's home.&#xD;
"Now, be it henceforth known to everybody, and to eve-&#xD;
rybody's son and daughter-if the fact is not already patent&#xD;
unto them-that every female between the ages of fifteen&#xD;
and twenty-three, is naturally, spontaneously, and inevitably,&#xD;
in love ; and all that is then wanting, is a suitable and wor-&#xD;
thy object to lavish it upon. If she finds such, well and&#xD;
good ; but whether she does, or not, still she must, and will&#xD;
pour it out-either healthily, or otherwise-on a cat or a man;&#xD;
a poodle or politics ; marriage or a mirror. Between those&#xD;
ages the female heart is just as full of love as an egg is full&#xD;
of meat ; nor can she help it ; it is the birth of affection,&#xD;
love, romance-the endeared and endearing spring-tide of life&#xD;
and emotion. Alas ! that the tide too often ebbs, never,&#xD;
never to rise again this side of the grave ! Then, in the rich&#xD;
exuberance of her innocence and purity, woman, unlike man&#xD;
at the same age, thinks no wrong, fears no harm. Gentle,&#xD;
trustful, noble girl ! Blessed is he who then calls her to&#xD;
himself-who, in the morning of his life, and her own, shall&#xD;

win, and worthily wear, her heart ; and abased indeed is&#xD;
he who then shall gaze upon her with unhallowed eyes, and&#xD;
seek to lure her from the path of honorable womanhood !&#xD;
" Presently the girl reached the hermit's abode, saluted&#xD;
the reverend man, presented her welcome gift, and received&#xD;
on bended knee his blessing in return.&#xD;
" They conversed awhile, did that fair girl and that strange&#xD;
recluse ; the hermit stood on this side, the maiden stood on&#xD;
that. 'Daughter,' said he, as he placed his white palms&#xD;
upon her beaming forehead, 'the world and all it contains&#xD;
amounts to but little, if it, and they, be not improved to the&#xD;
utmost-the attainment of the soul's aliment, knowledge,&#xD;
which it assimilates and digests into Wisdom. I have par-&#xD;
taken of that food for fourscore years and ten-have con-&#xD;
verted it into wisdom, and expect to be thus engaged during&#xD;
long centuries to come. Thou seest me living here alone,&#xD;
dependent upon the charities of such as thou : poor in Cali-&#xD;
fornia, where even the rocks are retained by golden wedges&#xD;
in their places, and where diamonds sparkle in a hundred&#xD;
valleys. Thou seest me shut out from the busy world, and&#xD;
drawing life from Charity-and Heaven. Such an existence&#xD;
is suitable for me, but not for such as thee. I am a student&#xD;
and professor of a strange and mighty magic, for I possess&#xD;
the marvellous Mirror, and the still more wondrous Crystal&#xD;
Globe-both of which are heirlooms of the early foretime,&#xD;
handed down the ages to me, as I in turn shall bequeath&#xD;
them to the ages yet to be. But thou ! thou art a woman,&#xD;
and cannot afford to shut thyself out from life, society, and&#xD;
&#xD;
pleasure, as Rosicrucians do, and must, if they would obtain&#xD;
the kingdom, the password-that uplifts the sable curtains&#xD;
that hide a dozen worlds-and the key, by which the doors&#xD;
of Mystery are opened. Child, for thee there are more fit-&#xD;
ting things in store than the upper knowing--better than&#xD;
solitude ; higher charms than study, and abstruse pondering&#xD;
over recondite lore, and subtle laws of Being and of Power.&#xD;
Thou in thy way, I in mine, are, and must be, soldiers in the&#xD;
strife for holy peace ; toilers for the millions yet unborn&#xD;
mechanics for redemption of the world ; active bees in the&#xD;
busy hive-thou of active human life, I that of human des-&#xD;
tiny ;.together, marchers in the grand army whose movement&#xD;
is ever onward, and which never looks behind. I strive for&#xD;
the True ; thy destiny tends toward the Beautiful ; together,&#xD;
we shall reach the goal of Good, moving over thorny roads,&#xD;
albeit, on the way ; for there are -many dangerous pitfalls,&#xD;
deep morasses, dismal swamps, gloomy forest-solitudes, and&#xD;
stony mountains, steep and slippery, that bar man's path to&#xD;
happiness.  " Prepare ye the way.... Make His paths&#xD;
straight 1"  Such is thy business-and mine. To accomplish&#xD;
this duty I am here ; but a different field is thine to labor in.&#xD;
To achieve thy destiny thou must place thine affections upon&#xD;
a son of man--thy soul's great love on God alone. You.&#xD;
must wed, bear children in great agony, yet gloriously, to&#xD;
your husband, your country, and to Him.&#xD;

will be, and and as he may become-provided you choose to&#xD;
make him so ; for a husband is ever and always just what a&#xD;
woman makes him ! I am now about to display a phanta-&#xD;
rama of the future before you. Observe, and note well all&#xD;
thou mayest behold. Speak not thereof to vain worldlings,&#xD;
who cannot comprehend deep mysteries, such as these ; above&#xD;
all, utter not one single word while thou sittest at yonder&#xD;
table, gazing into the Future-revealing Crystal Globe.'&#xD;
"And so saying, the grey-clad hermit of the Silver Girdle,&#xD;
who dwelt in a forest wild, led the way to a recess of the&#xD;
grotto, where the light was very subdued, very dim, and ex-&#xD;
ceedingly religious. There he seated her before a tripod,&#xD;
supporting a triangular shelf or table, himself taking a seat&#xD;
directly opposite. Upon this table he then placed a small,&#xD;
square, dark-leathern box, opening on brass hinges across the&#xD;
sides and top. He opened it, while reiterating his caution,&#xD;
and disclosed to the enraptured gaze of the doubly-delighted&#xD;
girl-all girls are delighted before they get their husbands-&#xD;
and many of them are considerably delighted, if not more&#xD;
so, to get rid of them afterwards !-a magnificent globe of&#xD;
pure crystal, clear as a dew-drop, radiant as a sunbeam. It&#xD;
was not over four inches in diameter, was a perfect sphere,&#xD;
and was altogether beautiful--in this respect, infinitely trairs-&#xD;
cending that of a soap-bubble of the same size--a humble&#xD;
comparison, but a just one-for there are few things more&#xD;
beautiful than these self-same soap-bubbles !&#xD;
" The first impulse of the girl was to handle this beautiful&#xD;
trinue-as it was called ; and she made a movement with&#xD;
&#xD;
that intent, but was instantly prevented by the hermit in&#xD;
grey, who said: 'Not for a hundred husbands, should mortal&#xD;
fingers touch that sphere ; for such contact would instantly&#xD;
rob it of its virtues, perhaps never to be regainedI Look,&#xD;
my daughter, look, but touch not!l'&#xD;
" She obeyed, and withdrew her hand, but reluctantly ; for&#xD;
her fingers itched severely-as what young woman's would&#xD;
not, under similar circumstances. Vide the Apple and Eve&#xD;
-by means of which, man fell-but fell up-hill nevertheless&#xD;
A great trait is this curiosity. It is woman's nature ; it is&#xD;
her great prerogative ! Eve looked into matters and things&#xD;
generally, induced Adam to follow her exai ple, and thus was&#xD;
the main lever that lifted the race out of Barbarism, and into&#xD;
civilization and decency. So much for this much-abused&#xD;
' Female curiosity.' But for it, man had remained a brute.&#xD;
With it, he has risen to a position a long way below the&#xD;
angels, to be sure, but then he is 'Coming Up.'&#xD;
" The twain now began to gaze steadily at the magic&#xD;
globe, maintaining perfect silence for the space of ten mi-&#xD;
nutes. All was still, hushed, silent as the grave, and only&#xD;
the wild throbbings of the young girl's heart could be heard.&#xD;
Presently the crystal began to change, and to emit faint&#xD;
streams of pale light, which gradually became more pro-&#xD;
nounced and distinct, until finally there was a most magnifi-.&#xD;
cent play of colors all over its surface. Presently the rich,&#xD;
effulgent scintillas, the concentric, irridescent flashings pre-&#xD;
viously observed, ceased entirely, and in their stead the girl&#xD;
began to notice two very strange and extraordinary appear-&#xD;

THE ROSICRUCIAN 'S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
ances, which, to her and to all save those who are familiar&#xD;
with such mysteries (and which, although nearly unknown in&#xD;
this country, are still quite common in the farther East), are&#xD;
totally unaccountable. In the first place, she became con-&#xD;
scious that she was breathing an atmosphere highly charged&#xD;
with a subtle aura that manifestly emanated from the body&#xD;
of the crystal itself. This air was entirely different from that&#xD;
which floated in the grotto an hour before, when she entered&#xD;
with her offering, because it was unmistakably charged, and&#xD;
that, too, very heavily, with a powerful magnetic aura. I&#xD;
said 'magnetic;' I should have said 'magnetoid,' for whereas&#xD;
the former induces drowsy feeling and somnolence, the latter&#xD;
had a purely opposite effect, for it provoked wakefulness, and&#xD;
promoted greater and intensified vigilance on the part of&#xD;
both the woman and the man.&#xD;
In the second place, there came a remarkable change in&#xD;
'ithe crystal itself ; for, having lost its brilliant, diamond-like&#xD;
colors and interchanging rainbow spray, it now became de-&#xD;
cidedly opalescent, speedily passing into the similitude of a&#xD;
ball of clear glass, with a disk of pearly opal transversely&#xD;
through its centre. Very soon even this changed, until it&#xD;
became like a dead-white wall, upon the surface of which the&#xD;
eye rested, without the power of penetration as before.&#xD;
Gazing steadily upon this opaque frame, the girl in a short&#xD;
time distinctly and perfectly beheld, slowly moving across&#xD;
that pearly shield, as if instinct with life, numerous petite,&#xD;
but unmistakable human figures !-figures of men and women,&#xD;
tiny to the last degree, but absolutely perfect iu outline and&#xD;

movement. And they moved hither and thither across the&#xD;
field of vision ; she saw them moving through the streets of&#xD;
a city. A little closer !-' as I live, they are going up and&#xD;
down Bush street !'-an aristocratic thoroughfare in the great&#xD;
city known in this story as Santa Blarneeo. This fact she&#xD;
instantly recognized, with that strange and inexplicable an-&#xD;
achronism peculiar to Dreams, and the still stranger incon-&#xD;
sistency peculiar to dreamers and voyagers to the 'Summer&#xD;
Land.'&#xD;
"Gradually these tiny figures appeared to enlarge, or&#xD;
rather, she saw them in such a perspective, that they looked&#xD;
like full-sized persons some little distance off. Even while&#xD;
she gazed, the crystal changed again, or rather, vanished&#xD;
from her perceptions altogether, the figures enlarged--ap-&#xD;
proached, as it were-and she became a passive spectator of&#xD;
a scene at that moment transpiring-but where ?  Certainly&#xD;
not in this world of ours, nor in Dream-land, nor in fancy's&#xD;
realms, nor in the home of souls you read about in the 'very&#xD;
funny' descriptions of 'Starnos and'Cor,' nor in 'Guptarion,'&#xD;
nor around the 'Lakes of Mornia,' nor among the 'Pyra-&#xD;
midalia,' nor in 'Saturn,' nor in any of the gloriously ridicu-&#xD;
lous localities imagined by A. J. Davis, and put forth by him&#xD;
in the delusive hope that any sane man or woman could be&#xD;
found green or fool enough to swallow. Few men better&#xD;
deserve the name of impostor than the author of 'Guptarion,'&#xD;
'Mornia,' 'Foli,' ' Starnos,' 'Galen,' 'Magic Staffs,' 'Harm&#xD;
only-Man,' and 'Cor,'-not one of which has the least ex-&#xD;
istence on the earth, under, or above or around it ; but the&#xD;

true and exact location of which is on an extensive and very&#xD;
soft spot just above their author's ears, and the soft spots of&#xD;
his followers, for it is morally certain that no one with even&#xD;
an ordinary modicum of-not sanity, but common sense, can,&#xD;
would or could accept his funny 'Philosophy ?' as true,&#xD;
"'Where, then, was the true locality of the scene that&#xD;
Betsey saw taking place ?' you ask. And I answer, and I&#xD;
tell you, in nearly the words of the strange Hermit of the&#xD;
Silver Girdle, when explaining it to Betsey Clark : All these&#xD;
strange things are occurring, not in any sort of phantom-&#xD;
world, but in another material earth, quite as solid as this.&#xD;
This crystal is a magic telescope through which we may&#xD;
view whatever we desire to, whether on this earth or off it.&#xD;
" Listen ! Space is by no means limitless, but is a globu-&#xD;
lar or elliptical, definite region-the play-ground of the&#xD;
Powers-and is bounded on all sides by a thick amorphous&#xD;
Wall, of the materials of which new worlds and starry sys-&#xD;
tems from time to time are fashioned. This Wall is thicker,&#xD;
a million-fold, than the diameter of the entire menstruum&#xD;
wherein this universe is floating. Surrounding this universe,&#xD;
on all sides of this wall, are seven other universes, separated&#xD;
as is this, from all the others ; and they all differ from our&#xD;
own and the rest, as differs a volcano from a sprig of rosemary&#xD;
-that is to say, utterly-totally. The material worlds of&#xD;
each of these other universes outnumber the sands of the&#xD;
desert, yet their number is precisely that of the one in which&#xD;
we live ; but they are larger, for the earth that corresponds&#xD;
to, and bears the name of this of ours, is, in the smallest of&#xD;
&#xD;
the other universes, quite as bulky as the sun which gives us&#xD;
light, and the other solar bodies in proportion. The universe&#xD;
next higher is immeasurably larger than the one just alluded&#xD;
to. It has the same number of material worlds, and the&#xD;
earth corresponding to this of ours is as large as the solar&#xD;
system in which we are. That of the third is as large as the&#xD;
solar system of the second, and so on to the last of the series&#xD;
of seven ; but not the last in fact, for outside of, and sur-&#xD;
rounding the entire seven, is another Wall, separating them&#xD;
from forty-nine other systems, in ascending grade. I cannot&#xD;
now give you any information respecting the sublime reali-&#xD;
ties of these forty-nine, nor of the regions and realms STILL&#xD;
BEYOND ; therefore I recall your attention to this world and&#xD;
sphere of being.&#xD;
"On earth there are seven distinct classes or orders of&#xD;
men : the INSTINCTUAL, AFFECTIONAL, INTELLECTUAL, INTU-&#xD;
ITIONAL, ASPIRING, INDIFFERENT, and WISE, to all of whom a&#xD;
different destiny is decreed. Organizations determine desti-&#xD;
nies ! Every nebulae seen in the far-off heaven is a system&#xD;
of worlds. That wonderful family of stars to which our sun&#xD;
belongs is, with all its overflowing measure of star-dust, but&#xD;
a single cosmos ; and there are myriads of such within the&#xD;
confines of this present universe, and before we cross the vast&#xD;
ocean of Ethylle, and reach the Wall alluded to. All things&#xD;
are in halves ; male, female-negative, positive-light, dark,&#xD;
and so on. So is the nebulae of worlds to which we belong.&#xD;
Now, remember what I have said of the resemblances be-&#xD;

the Wall. Precisely such likenesses exist between the worlds&#xD;
of the respective halves of our own system.&#xD;
"At various distances, flecking the vault, we behold suns&#xD;
and systems innumerable. These all belong to this, the&#xD;
female half of our system. Beyond them lies a vast ocean&#xD;
of Ether, separating the Continents. Across that Ocean, at&#xD;
a distance incomputable by the human intellect, is the male&#xD;
half of our system. There-there is a sun precisely as large,&#xD;
as brilliant, and as hot as ours-and no more so. Around&#xD;
that sun fiery comets whirl, planets revolve, and meteors&#xD;
flash, just as they do hitherward. There is a Venus, Mer-&#xD;
cury, Asteroids, Mars, Jupiter, and all the other planetary&#xD;
bodies, just as here, and of the same dimensions. A globe&#xD;
there is called Earth ; it has a moon, an Atlantic, Pacific,&#xD;
Mediterranean, and 'other seas, exactly equivalent to ours.&#xD;
It has a California, a San Francisco, Paris, Berlin, Munich,&#xD;
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburg, just&#xD;
as here ; and their names, as are those of its trees, countries,&#xD;
counties, town, people, capitals, are exactly as on this earth.&#xD;
There is a President Lincoln, and General Fremont ; a&#xD;
Thurlow Weed, and Cullen Bryant ; an Agassiz, and Ho-&#xD;
race Greeley ; Atlantic Monthly, and Harper's Magazine; a&#xD;
New   York Mercury, an Independent, edited by Beecher,&#xD;
Tilton and Leavitt--and they deal the same as do their simi-&#xD;
litudes here. The streets and omnibuses are precisely as&#xD;
here ; Wall street is as full of thieves, and contractors get&#xD;
fat off their country's gore as they do here. There is a&#xD;
Rebellion there, and Union Generals sell themselves to Trea-&#xD;
&#xD;
son just as here-while the menu who could and would save&#xD;
the nation are left out in the cold, in spite of the Tribunes,&#xD;
Posts, and Times-all of which long since pointed out the&#xD;
road to Richmond and to victory-and were laughed at just&#xD;
as in our planet.&#xD;
"In that far-distant world there is at this moment a&#xD;
steamer, 'Uncle Sam,' sailing across the Gulf of California,&#xD;
as at this moment we are, and on board of her there are just&#xD;
as many men and women as on this one, and their persons,&#xD;
names, habits, features, motives, hopes, fears, characters,&#xD;
secrets, and intellectual and moral natures, are precisely the&#xD;
same as our own, on board this ship. Our namesakes there&#xD;
are at this instant doing, thinking, acting, reading, as are&#xD;
we ; and some of them are listening to a very strange story,&#xD;
and its still stranger episodes, told by a Rosicrucian-just&#xD;
such a personage as myself-indeed my Very Self-in the&#xD;
self-same form and feature. And I say, and I tell you, that&#xD;
the alter ego-the living portrait of each man and woman in&#xD;
this circle, is thinking of him or herself, and of me and my&#xD;
revelations, at this moment, with the same stupid levity, with&#xD;
the same deep and awful impression of their truth, in the&#xD;
same manner, whatever it be, as are all of you at this mo-&#xD;
ment. And some there, as here, set me and my story at&#xD;
naught-stigmatize me as an enthusiast or dreaming poet,&#xD;
as do some of you. Others believe my truths. You have&#xD;
heard that coming events cast their shadows before them,&#xD;
and that Prophecy has been demonstrated true. Behold&#xD;
the solution of the world-enigma. Events transpire in that&#xD;

THE 4"MIRANDA" THEORY,    ~119.&#xD;
&#xD;
other world a trifle sooner than they do here ; yet you must&#xD;
remember that there is a, vast interval of space, and there-&#xD;
fore time, that must be bridged by even that swift courier,&#xD;
Sympathy. According as a man there, and his counterpart&#xD;
here, are fine, aspiring, and spiritual-minded, so is their rap-&#xD;
port across the awful gulf; and the male half, the more per-&#xD;
fect portion of each man or woman's self, very frequently&#xD;
telegraphs the other, often a long time before the event be-&#xD;
comes actualized on this earth. You have heard of Fays and&#xD;
Fairies. Listen, and learn the truth concerning them :&#xD;
Remembering that no human soul can by any possibility quit&#xD;
the confines of this universe until it has exhausted the whole&#xD;
of its, the universe's, resources, and has attained all of Love,&#xD;
Will, Majesty, Power, Wisdom and Dignity, that this vast&#xD;
cosmos can give it ; after which it sleeps awhile, but will&#xD;
awake again to the exercise of Creative Energy, on the&#xD;
thither side of the Wall-both duplicates sleep at once ; for,&#xD;
after their deaths on the material earths, they exist apart,&#xD;
but sustain the same relations, in certain aromal worlds at-&#xD;
tached to their respective primary homes. At the final&#xD;
deaths, they blend forever, their stature is increased, and&#xD;
they enter, through the Wall, that earth resembling the one&#xD;
whereon the double unit had its birth originally.&#xD;
"You have heard of Metempsychosis, Transmigration, of&#xD;
Reincarnation, and of Progress. Listen, and learn more :&#xD;
Not only the inhabitants of the countless myriads of worlds&#xD;
in this material and aromal universe, but also the material&#xD;
and aromal worlds themselves, are in a constant state of pro&#xD;
&#xD;
gressive movement. By aromal worlds I mean the aerial&#xD;
globes that attend each planet. They are places where souls&#xD;
rest awhile after death, before they commence in earnest the&#xD;
second stage of their career ; and this state is an interme-&#xD;
diate one, just like sleep, only that they are conscious and&#xD;
active while there ; but it is an activity and consciousness,&#xD;
not like, but analogous to that' of Dream. Every world,&#xD;
and assemblage of worlds, is periodically reduced, by exhaus-&#xD;
tion, but at enormously long intervals, into ,Chaos, and is&#xD;
then reformed, or created anew, still, however, being the same&#xD;
world. After this passage, each system and world becomes&#xD;
vastly more perfect than before ; but, owing to the dimin-&#xD;
ished quantity of Spirit or essence which has been consumed&#xD;
in giving birth to hosts of immortal armies, each system and&#xD;
world is vastly smaller than before. This is for two reasons,&#xD;
one of which I have just stated ; the other is, in order to&#xD;
make room for new cosmi, and new worlds, both of which&#xD;
are being constantly created from the material of the Wall;&#xD;
and the wall itself is the condensed effluence of the Maker-.&#xD;
in short, it is God-Od, and therefore inexhaustible.  The&#xD;
majority of those who have lived on any world are re-born in&#xD;
it after its restitution, they, in the meantime, having grown&#xD;
correspondingly clean and perfect. The same relative propor-&#xD;
tions between a world and its occupants is still preserved, and'&#xD;
never varies ; and, 'consequently, the six-foot man and the five-&#xD;
foot woman of one career, find themselves, in their next state,&#xD;
occupying five and four-foot bodies respectively. The present&#xD;
is our thirty-fourth Incarnation. Originally we were taller&#xD;

We are smaller and better than ever before, and our worst&#xD;
man is better than the best of the preceding state. The&#xD;
worst, in the next change, will be better than our best.* To&#xD;
illustrate, let me say, that the following persons, viz.: Thur-&#xD;
low  W     -, Abraham       L-    ., Russel L     -, J. Gordon&#xD;
B  .-, Henry      J. R-      , Win. Cullen B-       , Jefferson&#xD;

Mc-, Gen. J. H-k-r, Dr. H. F. G--d--r, Charles T-n-s,&#xD;
Lizzie D-      and myself, respectively, were, previously to&#xD;
the last change : the first, a feudal lord ; the second, an edi-&#xD;
tor; the third, a Danish prince ; the fourth, a court-jester ;&#xD;
the fifth, a missionary ; the sixth, a generalissimo ; the&#xD;
seventh, a harpist ; the eighth, a theatrical manager ; the&#xD;
ninth, a knife-grinder ; the tenth, a privateer ; the eleventh,&#xD;
a preacher ; the twelfth, a schoolmaster ; the thirteenth, a&#xD;
trumpeter ; the fourteenth, a politician ; the       fifteenth, a&#xD;

* Extremes meet. The sublime impinges on the ridiculous. The substance of&#xD;
the text-save only that I have changed the names-was put forth seriously as&#xD;
truth, by a recent British author. Here, of course, it is given for what it is worth,&#xD;
which may be more than some imagine. Viewed in one light, these notions are&#xD;
almost as absurd as are the desperately-funny lucubrations of Andrew Jackson&#xD;
Davis, concerning what he calls the " Summer Land," which many people regard&#xD;
as true revelations of Man's post-mortem life, when, in fact, they ar monstrous&#xD;
abortions, devoid of even common sense, and are without one particle of truth&#xD;
from beginning to end.&#xD;

queen ; and the last, a barber's clerk ; so that it is evident,&#xD;
that though our progress is slow, still that we are ' Coming&#xD;
up.' Little as our actual worth may be, still we are better&#xD;
now, generally speaking, than in the former stage. Thus,&#xD;
we will grow smaller at every change. Some worlds, and&#xD;
their dwellers, in this universe have thus decreased, and being&#xD;
sometimes seen by people here, have been called Fays or&#xD;
Fairies. The world has yet to undergo some thousands of these'&#xD;
changes, until at last we become very small indeed, which will&#xD;
occur when conception is no longer possible in the universe,&#xD;
either in the vegetable or animal worlds ; and then will occur&#xD;
the change and transference beyond the Wall.&#xD;
" Betsey Clark was beholding persons and events of that&#xD;
other world-half of this, our little staying-house, beholding&#xD;
things through that fairy lense-that beautiful magic crystal,&#xD;
through which the human eye can see, the human brain sense,&#xD;
things that have occurred, are occurring, or are to occur,&#xD;
upon the world-stage of this our life's theatre.&#xD;
"It is an established fact that fools never dream! Wise&#xD;
people often do ! And those belonging to the latter cate-&#xD;
gory cannot have failed to notice that things, dates, persons,&#xD;
circumstances, and probabilities, are considerably mixed up,&#xD;
as a general thing, in dreams. Their anachronisms are es-&#xD;
pecially remarkable and provoking, and indicate that time is&#xD;
of but little, if any, account, so far as the soul, per se, is con-&#xD;
cerned. A dream of a minute often embraces the multifa-&#xD;
rious experience of a century. This instant you are hob-nob-&#xD;

eastern Asia, and in the next are taking wine with Pharaoh&#xD;
and Moses on the banks of the Nile ; now you are delivering&#xD;
an oration before Alexander the Great, and in a jiffy find&#xD;
yourself stuffing ballots on Cornhill in an election for ward-&#xD;
constable ; now you are contemporary with Sardanapalus or&#xD;
Thothmes III., and in half a second you are delivering a&#xD;
' Spiritual Lecture' in Lamartine Hall, having paid fifty&#xD;
cents for the privilege of listening to your own 'Splendid and&#xD;
Overpowering Eloquence' Taken together, dreams, like&#xD;
Complimentary Benefits, are queer concerns. Such was&#xD;
that of Betsey Clark ; for at one moment of time she was a&#xD;
virgin girl, a wife, a widow, and a wife again. She recog-&#xD;
nized at once the facts of her girlhood, that she had carefully&#xD;
deposited one husband in a hole in the ground, and was in&#xD;
high hopes of performing the same kind office for a second-&#xD;
Mr. Thomas W&#xD;
"Presently the view in the crystal faded away, and in its&#xD;
stead there came the appearance of a large and splendid ate-&#xD;
lier, containing numberless statues, in a more or less finished&#xD;
condition, standing on pedestals or in niches round the wall-&#xD;
sides. The sculptor was absent. It was evident at a glance&#xD;
that his images were not hewn of marble, but of some other&#xD;
material, which needed but a touch of fire to make them&#xD;
start up into life, liberty, and light. It was a man-factory---..&#xD;
a place where people were carved out to order by a wonder-&#xD;
ful Artist, who had just opened business thereabouts and&#xD;
who, judging from appearances, was already in a fair line of&#xD;
patronage, and quite likely to do well, if not better.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Standing near the centre of the apartment, propped up&#xD;
with bits of wood, Betsey saw the exact, likeness, in all&#xD;
respects, of Mr. Thomas Clark-but the. figure was unfin-&#xD;
ished-soft, puttyish, and doughy as a Northern Politician.&#xD;
"This statue stood semi-erect, and strongly suggested an&#xD;
invalid kitten, leaning on a hot brick ; or, a modern philoso-&#xD;
pher of the spread-eagle and Progressive school, when the&#xD;
contributions are small. The figure was labelled 'Tom&#xD;
Clark, as he was ;' that is to say, soft, ductile, capable of&#xD;
being moulded into the Ruffian or the Man. Directly beside&#xD;
it was another statue, closely resembling the other in many&#xD;
points, but yet different. It was labelled 'Tom Clark, as he&#xD;
is !' that is to say, it looked as if abundantly capable of feed-&#xD;
ing on tenpenny nails, dining on files, and supping upon pigs&#xD;
of iron. It looked, for all the world, as if the greatest pos-&#xD;
sible favor that could be done for it, would be to tread on the&#xD;
tail of its coat, or knock a chip off its shoulder, or as if its&#xD;
supreme delight would be to be permitted to wrap itself in a&#xD;
star-spangled banner ; move across the room in three.strides&#xD;
and a straddle ; fire off two horse-pistols, and die like a son&#xD;
of ar-gun, after having exercised a special penchant for&#xD;
divorced women-separating wives from their husbands, for&#xD;
the sake of position, wealth, beauty and passion. It looked as&#xD;
if it was troubled about stealing rain-producing theories-&#xD;
not for stealing, but for being caught at it. It loo1ged as if&#xD;
its heart was breaking, because it had not brains enough to&#xD;
be a Pantarch-or the tenth-part of one. It looked as if&#xD;
its heart would burst with envy, because other men had&#xD;

friends, and power, and applause, and merit, in spite of its&#xD;
little, perked-up, seven-by-nine, skull-cracked soul-poor cam-&#xD;
bric, needle-eyed soul, twelve hundred and eighty trillions to&#xD;
the half ounce. It looked, for all the world, as Tom really&#xD;
did the very last time he came home, just before they lay&#xD;
down upon their couch, in the little chamber in which was&#xD;
the little window, whose upper sash was down-that is to&#xD;
say, short, crusty, crisp, and meaner than 'git ;' as-he felt&#xD;
before they both lay down, and dreamed such 'very funny'&#xD;
dreams-mean, despicable, iron-hearted Tom Clark, the&#xD;
plague of her life, bane of her existence, and source of all&#xD;
her troubles. So at least it seemed to the lady in her curious&#xD;
vision. Presently both these figures slowly faded from her&#xD;
sight, and in their stead there arose through the floor a third&#xD;
figure, labelled, 'Tom Clark, as he may be.' While she was&#xD;
admiring the vast superiority, in all respects, of this new&#xD;
statue, a fourth human figure entered the atelier ; this figure&#xD;
was alive, and, mirabile dictu! the woman beheld the exact&#xD;
counterpart of-herself!-clad as a working artist-a sculp-&#xD;
tor, with apron, paper-cap, and dusty clothing, all complete,&#xD;
as if she had just left chiselling the dead marble. This lemur&#xD;
of herself appeared deeply gratified at the appearance of the&#xD;
statue ; for, after surveying it awhile, she proceeded to arm&#xD;
herself with a flame-tipped baton, wherewith she touched&#xD;
the figure in various places, but mainly on the head, and over&#xD;
the region of the heart. The effect of these touches of flame&#xD;
was to make the figure move ; and, in five minutes the dead&#xD;
mass was"warm with life, vitality and genius-for the phan-&#xD;
&#xD;
tom-artiste appeared to endow the figure with a portion of&#xD;
har own life ; and a closer inspection revealed the curious&#xD;
fact that the flame at the end of the staff-which was hol-&#xD;
low--was fed from a deep well of subtle, fine and inflam-&#xD;
mable ether in her own heart.&#xD;
"The statue lived. It was Tom Clark, and no mistake ;&#xD;
but Heaven ! what a change !-what a difference between&#xD;
the actual and the ideal man ! His features fairly blazed&#xD;
with the fires of Genius and Ambition ; and they beamed&#xD;
like a sun, with Friendship, Intelligence, Truth and Manhood&#xD;
-they all held high court in his soul, and radiated from his&#xD;
inspired features ; his very presence charged the air with&#xD;
Mind, though his lips spoke never a word, breathed never a&#xD;
syllable. And now Betsey heard her alter ego speak ; and&#xD;
it said to the living statue : 'Rise, Tom Clark ; rise, and be&#xD;
a Man-be yourself. Rise!' And it rose ; stepped from&#xD;
the pedestal, erected its head-and such a head !-while she,&#xD;
the phantom artiste, with careful tread, and anxiously holding&#xD;
her nether lip between her teeth, slowly retreated backward&#xD;
from the room, quitting it through the door by which she had&#xD;
entered a little while before. She was followed majestically&#xD;
by the statue, which moved with power and grace, as if&#xD;
charged to the brim by God's Galvanic Batteries.&#xD;
" Scarcely had the two phantoms left the room, than the&#xD;
woman on the stool-the real Betsey Clark-followed their&#xD;
example with a sudden bound, exclaiming, as she did so,&#xD;
despite the warning of the Hermit of the Silver Girdle (for&#xD;
whom at that moment she didn't care ;-not even a piece of&#xD;

especially woman nature, could stand the pressure no longer.&#xD;
She felt and acted as she felt-as every woman has, since the&#xD;
year ONE-and will, until Time and Eternity both grow grey.&#xD;
'My husband !' there spake the woman. In an instant the&#xD;
Hermit of the Silver Girdle was in a very great and unpre-&#xD;
cedented fluster.&#xD;
"Silly girl ! didn't I tell you not to speak ?  Only look!&#xD;
see how you have gone and done it !-done me ! Oh, dear !&#xD;
if I warn't a Rosicrucian, I'd get excessively angry, Dorg on&#xD;
it, if I wouldn't' and in his trouble, he pronounced 'dog,'&#xD;
with an r. Commend me to a female for upsetting the best&#xD;
calculation of the wisest Rosicrucian that ever lived. I speak&#xD;
from experience&#xD;
I told you not to open your lips, and here you've gone&#xD;
and spoken right out ! What's the consequence ?' exclaimed&#xD;
the venerable grey-beard. 'Why, the spell is broken-the&#xD;
charm fled-nor can either be recalled before the sun has set&#xD;
and rose again, and once more declined toward the western&#xD;
sea. Familiar as I am with the secrets of Galv and the&#xD;
mysteries of magic crystals, I know that you have done very&#xD;
wrong ; for no one is fit to consult Destiny by their aid who&#xD;
is not competent to keep silence for an hour, no matter what&#xD;
the temptation or provocation to break it may be. Now hie&#xD;
thee homeward. To-morrow thou mayest return again, pro-&#xD;
vided thou wilt obey me, and speak not a syllable while the&#xD;
phantasmal game of Fate is being played before thine eyes.'&#xD;
"The Hermit of the Silver Girdle had spoken truly ; for&#xD;
&#xD;
at the very first movement of her lips, the whole scene of&#xD;
enchantment vanished into thin air, leaving only a three-cor-&#xD;
nered table and a little glossy-looking ball behind.&#xD;
" To depict her chagrin and disappointment at this abrupt&#xD;
termination of a very strange affair, is a task totally beyond&#xD;
my capacities. She bounced out of the grotto in a miff,&#xD;
tossing her pretty head in a manner peculiarly adapted to&#xD;
play the very Old Scratch with the soft and susceptible heads&#xD;
and hearts of the male 'sect'-especially their heads ; but&#xD;
she had no idea of abandoning the adventure at that point--&#xD;
not she ; but was fully resolved to see it out next day, even&#xD;
if she bit her tongue in two, in the endeavor to keep still.&#xD;
Warriors, statesmen, philosophers, and well-read men can&#xD;
comprehend the sublimity of her resolution, because they&#xD;
know that of all earthly tasks, the one assigned herself was&#xD;
the greatest, most heroic, and one compared to which the&#xD;
twelve labors of the Greek god were mere child's pastime.&#xD;
At all events, to keep perfectly silent she would certainly--&#xD;
'Try,' said a voice, right beside her ear ! She started,&#xD;
attributing the circumstance to mere fancy ; but again the&#xD;
magic word was, by unseen lips, gently, softly whispered in&#xD;
her ear. 'Try,' it said-and the word went echoing through&#xD;
her very soul. Whence came the voice ?  Who was. it--&#xD;
what was it that spoke ? Certainly not - herself, nor the&#xD;
Hermit. When was it, where was it, that she had heard&#xD;
that voice- and word before ? When, how, where had it&#xD;
made so deep an impression on her mind ? Was it in a dream ?&#xD;
Who can tell? she could not. My hearers, can you?&#xD;

VERY CURIOUS S--VERY TRUE!   129&#xD;
&#xD;
"Next morning, bright and early, the young girl returned&#xD;
once more to the grotto of the Hermit of the Silver Gir-&#xD;
dle, who dwelt on the shady borders of a forest wild. An&#xD;
hour or two elapsed in friendly converse and admonition;&#xD;
and. now again behold the dissimilar twain once more seated&#xD;
silently before the little table, on which glittered, as before,&#xD;
the rare, pearl-disked, magic, wonder-working crystal globe.&#xD;
Again, as before, the glorious play of colors came and went.&#xD;
Again it faded, and she saw the atelier, the artiste, and the&#xD;
artiste's living statue ; but this time Betsey could look right&#xD;
through its body, as if it were made of finely-polished glass.&#xD;
Tom Clark stood before her. She saw and comprehended&#xD;
him on all sides-soul, spirit, body ; and though she was&#xD;
neither a strong-minded woman, a 'lecturess on philosophy,&#xD;
'The good time coming,' nor 'Woman's sacred and delicate&#xD;
work,'--and though she knew but little of the human organ-&#xD;
ism, beyond a few familiar commonplaces---yet she compre-&#xD;
hended enough of the glorious mystery before her to be&#xD;
aware that the red, pulsing lump just beneath its throat'was&#xD;
technically known and considered as the heart ; and she&#xD;
couldn't help admiring its wonderful and mighty mechanism ;&#xD;
its curious movements, mystical arrangements of parts, and&#xD;
adaptation of means to ends ; its auricles, valves, and veins ;&#xD;
its ventricles, and its pump-tapping the well of life, and&#xD;
forcing its water through a million yards of hose, plentifully&#xD;
irrigating the loftiest gardens of man's body, and hence, of&#xD;
his imperishable soul. The inspection was almost too much&#xD;
for the girl, who had. liked to have screamed out her won-&#xD;
&#xD;
derment and delight ; but having made up her mind to keep&#xD;
still this time, she, by dint of much handkerchief and tongue-&#xD;
biting, succeeded, to the eternal credit of herself-or any&#xD;
other woman !&#xD;
"'That which you see,' said the Hermit, who of course&#xD;
had the privilege of talking as he pleased, 'is a man's heart,&#xD;
in full play. It is, as you perceive, filled with blood, whose&#xD;
office is to give life to the body and vigor to the mind. But&#xD;
the heart has other chambers than those containing the&#xD;
venous and arterial fluids ; for all its walls and valves con-&#xD;
tain innumerable small cells; and these-cells secrete and con-&#xD;
tain certain aeriform fluids far more potential than blood,&#xD;
and which subserve the ends of a higher and far more won-&#xD;
derful economy. There are two kinds of blood ; so also are&#xD;
there two kinds of the subtle fluid I have mentioned : one&#xD;
sort is born with us, and we come into the world with exactly&#xD;
one half of these cells full, while the other half are entirely&#xD;
empty ; and so they must remain until they are filled from&#xD;
the heart of some one else. Males are born with the cells of&#xD;
the left side empty, females with those of the right unfilled,&#xD;
while the other cells of each are always full. These fluids&#xD;
are real, actual, perceptible, but imponderable. Their name&#xD;
is Love; and when things take their proper and natural&#xD;
course, the fluid flows out from the cells of a woman's heart&#xD;
into the empty ones of a man's ; and the full cells of a man's&#xD;
heart fill the empty ones of a woman's, in which case they&#xD;
are said to " love each other." Two men cannot thus love ;&#xD;
nor can two females. Many of either sex travel from the&#xD;

cradle to the grave without either filling, or being filled in&#xD;
turn; for it is a law that love cannot flow unless it be tapped&#xD;
by the opposite party ; and it can only be tapped by KIND-&#xD;
NESS, GENTLENESS, RESPECT-these three ! The unloved and&#xD;
unloving are only half men and half women-and, believe&#xD;
me, my child, there's a mighty sight of Halfness in this&#xD;
world of ours ! Much of it comes of not Trying to have it&#xD;
otherwise. People--married people, especially-devote half&#xD;
their days to growling because they have not got somebody&#xD;
else's wife or husband, when the fact is that their own&#xD;
partners are quite good enough-as they would find out with&#xD;
a little proper endeavor. Men expect a woman's love to&#xD;
bubble up all the time. Fools ! why don't they sound its&#xD;
depth, and bring it to the surface ? There are altogether too&#xD;
many divorces--a divorce first, and the next step-is danger-&#xD;
ous. I knew a wife of three divorces ; I knew a man the&#xD;
husband of two consecutive divorcees. Good intentions !&#xD;
Bah ! Hell is paved with such. I know of fifty broken-&#xD;
hearted women whose husbands, after wearing them out,&#xD;
sneaked off to Indiana and robbed them of name, fame, life,&#xD;
and hope ;-the demons'! Out upon the wretches ! The&#xD;
woman who has wasted her youth and bloom upon a man who&#xD;
then wants a divorce, and permits him to obtain it, is a fool.&#xD;
He promised for life. Make him keep it, even if you invoke&#xD;
the law's strong arm. If both agree, that alters the case. I&#xD;
have a legal acquaintance ,in New York who drives a large&#xD;
trade in the divorce line, at twenty-five dollars a head. I&#xD;
feel called upon to expose the infernal methods by means of&#xD;
&#xD;
which it is done, and I call upon the Legislature to see to it&#xD;
that the thing is not suffered to go on. I A. is a lawyer ; B.&#xD;
and C. are husband and wife. B. wants a " divorce without&#xD;
publicity ;" goes to A. and pays a fee to secure it, but has&#xD;
no legal quibble by means of which to obtain it. A. gives&#xD;
him the following counsel : " Go to a brothel, take up with&#xD;
an inmate thereof ; call her D. ; make three or four male&#xD;
and female acquaintances (E., F., G., and H.), introduce&#xD;
them to D. as your wife ; leave town a day or two, but take&#xD;
care that D. is well watched in the interim. Of course she&#xD;
will avail herself of your absence to ply her vocation. E., F.,&#xD;
G., and H. furnish the most incontestable and damning proof&#xD;
of her supposed guilt.' The witnesses may or may not know&#xD;
your precious scheme. You prosecute the leman under your&#xD;
wife's name-she, of course, knowing nothing about the pro-&#xD;
ceedings-poor thing ! The court takes the'evidence, hands&#xD;
it over to a referee, who passes on it ; returns it, affirmed, to&#xD;
the court, which forthwith enters a decree of perpetual&#xD;
divorce. A scoundrel goes unwhipped of justice, and an&#xD;
honest woman's reputation is forever damned !&#xD;
"'Legislators, I tell you that these things are done every&#xD;
day ! I was told it-could not believe it-and assuming to&#xD;
be 'desirous of such a decree, received the above counsel,&#xD;
word for word, from a practitioner at the New York ~bar.&#xD;
Legislators, here is a crime worse than murder ! Will you&#xD;
sanction it longer?  How prevent it ?  Summon the wit-&#xD;
nesses and performer of this marriage ; or at least prove the&#xD;
identity of the woman or the man, as the case may be-for&#xD;
women practice in that court also!I&#xD;

132         THE ROSICRUCIAN S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"'There would be far less of this sort of iniquity, if there&#xD;
were fewer blatant philosophy-mongers afloat on the tide of&#xD;
the times, inculcating their morbid, detestable, blasphemous,&#xD;
brothel-filling, "JHarmonial " theories, all of which directly&#xD;
pander to the worst vice a man can have -Meanness.&#xD;
People insanely look for and expect perfection in others--&#xD;
not only without the slightest claim thereto themselves, but&#xD;
without the least attempt in that direction-which is a very&#xD;
suicidal policy to pursue. Such soon come to be vampires,&#xD;
consuming themselves and destroying others-ravening tigers&#xD;
at their own fold's side ! Sometimes one person's affection-&#xD;
which is akin to love-goes out toward and clings round an-&#xD;
other ; but Death ever flaps, his wings by the side of such,&#xD;
when that other fails to give it back. The unloving loved&#xD;
one, if such a thing be possible, is a born thief, from the cradle&#xD;
to the clouds ; .and there are a great many such robbers in&#xD;
the world.'&#xD;
But how is one to love when one don't feel like it, or&#xD;
has attractions in another direction ?' asked Betsey.&#xD;
" ' Where duty and honor point, there should the attraction&#xD;
lie ! Whosoever shall render themselves lovable and lovely,&#xD;
can no more help being loved than smoke can help ascending&#xD;
through the air. Make yourself agreeable to the partner of&#xD;
your lot in life, and that partner can no more help loving you&#xD;
than mirrors can help reflecting.&#xD;
"'The heart of yonder statue, which is that of the man&#xD;
who is destined to be a future husband of yours,' said the old&#xD;
man--pointing to the first figure of the previous day, which&#xD;
had, together with the second, re-appeared upon the scene,&#xD;
&#xD;
' will be only half full by reasonof your withholding and re-&#xD;
fusing all tender wifeliness ; you will rob him and yourself of&#xD;
the better meat of life ; your years will be gloomy ones ; you&#xD;
will make him wretched, and be the same yourself-cheat&#xD;
your bodies of health, your souls of happiness and vigor !&#xD;
Take heed ; correct the fault. You "can't ?"  There's no&#xD;
such word. TRY-!'&#xD;
"Turning now to the second figure of the previous day, he&#xD;
observed :'See ! Tom Clark's heart is empty. All its cells&#xD;
are filled with a void-hollow as the apples of Persia's arid&#xD;
. wastes. Have mercy, Heaven, on him whose heart throbs&#xD;
not with the rapturous burden of a woman's love ! Pity&#xD;
him whose soul groweth not tender with the love-light beam-&#xD;
ing from a baby's eyes ! Ah, what a world of nameless glory&#xD;
flashes from an infant's eyes ! They are telescopes through&#xD;
which my soul sees Heaven--through which I watch the&#xD;
mazy dance of starry worlds, and behold the joys of sera-&#xD;
phim. We Rosicrucians love babies-seed of the ages-and&#xD;
their mothers, too-because they are such ; for we believe&#xD;
that after death the maids fair worst-the wives fare better ;&#xD;
but no tongue or pen can express the rapture that awaits&#xD;
those who have borne sons and daughters to the world and&#xD;
heaven ! Bachelors !  Bah ! I will pass by such cattle,&#xD;
merely remarking that their place is not t'o be found in heaven,&#xD;
or the other place. They repair in a body to Fiddler's Green&#xD;
-and ought to stay there, if they do not!I'&#xD;
"And Betsey gazed on the forlorn figure of poor Tom-&#xD;
who was all one-sided, crooked, lean ; his hopes and joys were&#xD;

THE 4 PRETTY LITTLE GAME !"     135&#xD;
&#xD;
flown, because no one loved him, not even his wife ; and who&#xD;
else should, if not she ? And so he was wretched, like full&#xD;
many another whom I have seen as I journeyed down life's&#xD;
glades. His soul was driven back upon, and forced to eat&#xD;
itself, day by day, and year after year. 'And this great&#xD;
wrong you will do,' said the hermit ; and 'This great wrong&#xD;
I have already done,' thought the girl-wife-widow-wife&#xD;
-four in one, with that strange, anomalous inconsistency,&#xD;
peculiar to Dream-Life. 'I have done badly ; but this I will&#xD;
do no more-not another second longer !'&#xD;
"Bravely, royally thought and said ! Better, if more glo-&#xD;
riously done !-and that's just the difference-saying and&#xD;
doing. The first is common ; the'last is very rare. 'Better&#xD;
still, if truly said, and still more nobly done !'-was whis-&#xD;
pered in the woman's ear, in the same low, silvery voice, she&#xD;
had heard the day before. Who was it that spoke these&#xD;
melodious words ? Not the hermit in grey. Was it the in-&#xD;
visible Hesperina, telegraphing Betsey's soul across the vast&#xD;
expanse of the Continent of Dream ? Who shall answer me&#xD;
these questions ?&#xD;
"Said the silver-girdled hermit, as he smiled a smile of&#xD;
more than human gladness-more than human meaning--' It&#xD;
is Well.' She looked again toward the magic globe, and ho !&#xD;
within a moment, its disk had changed. The first two figures&#xD;
had disappeared ; the third had once more come upon the&#xD;
scene-a conspicuous actor in such a terrific drama, as&#xD;
neither earth nor starry eyes ever saw before, may they never&#xD;
see again !&#xD;
&#xD;
"The Gorgon, WAR, had glutted himself on Europe's&#xD;
bloody fields, and had flown across the salt sea, alighting on&#xD;
our shores. The demon landed with a howl, midway between&#xD;
Moultrie and Sumter. He had seized the reins of govern-&#xD;
ment, proclaimed himself sole Lord and King ; strangled&#xD;
Reason .in his dreadful gripe, until she lay bleeding on the&#xD;
gory earth, and meek-eyed Peace fled tearfully away from his&#xD;
grim presence, and hid herself upon a distant mountain-top,&#xD;
whence she could survey the shock of armies on the plains&#xD;
beneath, and sigh, and long for Liberty and rule.&#xD;
"War and Carnage, side by side, with gory banners flying,&#xD;
xiarched from one end of the nation to the other, until their&#xD;
footsteps rested on the graves of eight hundred thousand&#xD;
men. God's precious word was disregarded, and His blessed&#xD;
soil dyed red with human blood-the rich, fat blood of the&#xD;
noblest race that ever trod His earth-the blood of your&#xD;
brother, and of mine, 0 my countrymen !&#xD;
" And now, the loud-lunged trumpets brayed their fierce&#xD;
alarums, and summoned Columbia's sons to deeds at which our&#xD;
grandsons shall turn pale-deeds of heroic daring such as&#xD;
Greece, nor Rome, nor Carthage ever dreamed of, nor storied&#xD;
page has chronicled : summoned them to Sumter's stony&#xD;
ramparts, and Potomac's grassy banks-summoned them to&#xD;
do, and-die. Eight hundred thousand Men ! And they&#xD;
went-going as tornadoes go-to strike for a Nation's life-&#xD;
to strike the foul usurper low, and fling his carcass to the&#xD;
dogs. They would have struck-struck hard and home ; but&#xD;
they were stayed. That was not the 'little game' of Generals&#xD;

and Statesmen, and of high contract-ing parties. Oh, no !&#xD;
Victory would never do !  'Let us fight the foe with gloves&#xD;
b on !' said the Minister. They fought. The foe wore gloves,&#xD;
also ; but the -palms were brass, the fingers iron, and the&#xD;
knuckles polished steel ! But the Minister had his whim, and&#xD;
unborn generations will feel its consequences ! Eight hundred&#xD;
thousand graves !&#xD;
" And the Union legions went, from decreed Fate toward&#xD;
a consummated Destiny, in spite of Ministers, their minions,&#xD;
or the 'little game ;' and Tom Clark went, too.&#xD;
" And loud the trumpets brayed ; and the heavy drums did&#xD;
sound ; and they woke strange and fearful energies in the&#xD;
slumbering Nation's heart. What a magic transmutation !&#xD;
Plowmen transformed to heroes, such as shall forever put Ci-&#xD;
cinnatus in the shade ; day laborers, carriers of the hod,&#xD;
claiming-and rightfully, too-high places in the Pantheon&#xD;
of heroic demi-gods. Look at Fredericksburg ! Forget&#xD;
not the Black Brigade ! Bear in mind the deeds of a&#xD;
hundred regiments on a hundred fields-fields, too, that&#xD;
might, and would have finally decided the carnage and the&#xD;
quarrel, but for the Minister, his gloves, his 'little game,' his&#xD;
great whim-and lo ! its consequences !&#xD;
" Tom Clark, quickened into life by the subtle, flame-tipped&#xD;
staff in the hands of the phantom-artiste-the proprietress of&#xD;
the wonderful atelier and Man-factory, now stepped forth&#xD;
-through the door of the room, and forthwith the scene ex-&#xD;
panded to such vast dimensions, that Betsey found it impos-&#xD;
&#xD;
sible to realize the magic mimicry, for the whole thing was&#xD;
too real, and on too grand a scale. She stood on the hill of&#xD;
the world, surveying its valleys at leisure. Tom Clark,&#xD;
apparently heard-deeply heard, his Country's wail of agony&#xD;
-for unchecked Treason was then griping her tightly by the&#xD;
throat. That cry called him to a field of glory, such as God's&#xD;
green earth never before afforded, nor His sun ever saw ; nor&#xD;
His moon ; nor His myriad, twinkling, starry eyes !&#xD;
" Clark's soul was in arms, as his offended ears drank in&#xD;
the hoarse, deep thunders of Treason's cannonry, pouring iron&#xD;
hail upon a prostrate Nation's head ; and his eyes beheld the&#xD;
flashing of the guns, as they vomited a hell of iron and fire&#xD;
upon Sumter, upon Anderson, and the peerless EIGHTY-&#xD;
THREE ! Tom Clark saw the storm, and his heart indignant&#xD;
swelled, at the insult to the Star-gemmed Flag of Human&#xD;
Rights and Liberty-an insult, long since wiped out in&#xD;
traitor's blood, but for the Minister, and the gloves, and the&#xD;
'little game,' and the whim, whose consequences are-eight&#xD;
hundred thousand skeletons !&#xD;
"Like a true man, Clark, inspired by a true woman-the&#xD;
phantom-wife, and artiste-ran, leapt, flew to arms .and&#xD;
deathless glory. Ah, God ! to arms, and fadeless glory ! He&#xD;
had no time to grieve, or grumble ; or to criticise this gene-&#xD;
ral or that battle. He looked over the heads of cowards and&#xD;
traitors in his own camp, at the noble men in arms, and who&#xD;
bravely fought, and nobly died, for the Country. He saw,&#xD;
and gloriously emulated such men as Lyon, Saxton, Hunter,&#xD;
Fremont-and Baker ! Baker 1-0 Oregon ! my tears fall&#xD;

with thine, for him i He was mine, yours-ours ! Ours, in&#xD;
his life ; in his nobleness ; in his soul-arousing eloquence ;&#xD;
in the valor, and the effulgent glory of his death-the result&#xD;
of another whim, and lo ! the consequences !&#xD;
" And now, see ! Behold the smoke of yonder battle !&#xD;
Death rides on cannon-balls, to-day ! And, to-night, there&#xD;
will be much mourning in the land ; for strong men in thou-&#xD;
sands are giving up the ghost. Weep not,- 0 widow, for&#xD;
God accepts such sacrifices ; mourn not, 0 orphans, He&#xD;

His keeping ; thy grateful country will not let thee want for&#xD;

'My father died to redeem the land from treason !'&#xD;
" Death rides on cannon-balls, to-day, in the fight that we&#xD;
are seeing. Tom Clark is a hero. See ! he leads the van.&#xD;
God spare him ! What a presence ! What blows he deals&#xD;
for Liberty and the Union I Lo ! the thundering battalions&#xD;
of the brave and bold, but insane, misguided, and revengeful'&#xD;
foe, sweep down the embattled plain, their war-cry ringing&#xD;
out above the belching roar of artillery ; and, with such&#xD;
might and valor do they charge, that Freedom's cohorts reel&#xD;
and stagger beneath the dreadful shock of arms. Another&#xD;
such a charge, and all is lost. But, see, there comes a man&#xD;
from the ranks--a common soldier--his voice rings clearly&#xD;
out upon the sulphur-laden air: 'Follow me 1' The inspir-&#xD;
ing words and action kindle new fire in the wavering&#xD;
breasts of hundreds. They rise ; they throw themselves&#xD;
upon the foe-they hush his battle-cry in' death. He is&#xD;
&#xD;
repulsed !  'Who did that ?' demands an aide-de-camp.&#xD;
'Private Thomas W.,' is the response. 'Hero ! greet him&#xD;
in my name, as Color Sergeant,' says the General ; and&#xD;
Tom Clark is promoted on the field.&#xD;
" The first day's fight is over. It is renewed next day,&#xD;
and, when the tired guns give over with the sun, a group of&#xD;
soldiers are gathered round a man. 'Who is it ?' 'Who is&#xD;
it ?' ' I thought you knew-why, it is the man who saved&#xD;
the Tenth Brigade-and was rewarded on the spot-Captain&#xD;
Thomas W. !'&#xD;
" With the sunrise, came the foe ! 'Pass the word along&#xD;
the line, there-Captain Clark is wanted at the tent of the&#xD;
General-in-Command !' He goes.&#xD;
" ' Captain Clark, do you see yonder battery of the enemy ?&#xD;
It must be taken, or we are lost. If I give you command&#xD;
of a regiment whose colonel was killed yesterday, can you&#xD;
take it ?' 'I will try.' . . . ' General, the battery on&#xD;
the left is ours,' says an aide-de-camp an hour afterwards.&#xD;
'It is taken, and all its men are either dead or prisoners I'&#xD;
'Indeed I So soon?   Greet the commander in my name,&#xD;
and salute him as Colonel Thomas W.'&#xD;
" Another day dawns on the ensanguined field-a field&#xD;
where privates were heroes and generals poltroons ! Hard&#xD;
fighting is before us. Up, up the soldiers spring ; and on,&#xD;
on to death or victory they rush. Oh, it was a splendid&#xD;
sight-those death-defying demi-gods, who, had they in pre-&#xD;
vious battles had but a Man to lead them, would have taken&#xD;
fifty rebel strongholds in as many hours. But such was not&#xD;
the drift of the 'pretty little game.' More men must die,&#xD;

more ditches must be dug, and more human bones must fill&#xD;
them, else how can Ministers carry out their whims ; how&#xD;
else can the enemy be fought and placated at the same time ?&#xD;
it isn't Constitutional I besides which it hurts the prospect&#xD;
for the Presidency of the re-United States--which prospect&#xD;
would be forever marred, and the 'little game' played out,&#xD;
if we fought without gloves, and violated our Constitutional&#xD;
obligations by kicking the wind out of the foe, who is trying&#xD;
might and main to strangle the Nation. He might here-&#xD;
after say: ' You, sir, fought without gloves on 1' which&#xD;
wouldn't do, you know.&#xD;
"' Damn that Colonel Thomas W. If the fellow keeps on&#xD;
at that rate, we'll surely whip somebody--badly. Curse the&#xD;
fellow, he don't believe in the glove business, or in the&#xD;
" Erring Sisters' theory,"' soliloquized somebody on a cer-&#xD;
tain day. 'This'll never do ! Aid, come here ; go tell Cob..&#xD;
nel Clark take possession of the Valley down yonder, and&#xD;
hold it at all hazards till nightfall !' 'But, General, he has&#xD;
only seven hundred men-the foe is thirteen thousand&#xD;
strong l' 'So much the 'worse for '- he meant Clark, but&#xD;
said, 'the enemy-they will fight like tigers.' And the aid&#xD;
transmitted the order-shaking hands with the Colonel as he&#xD;
rode away, muttering, 'Poor fellow ! His goose is cooked&#xD;
for a certainty! What a pity he stands in somebody's light-,&#xD;
somebody who is jealous of even aprivate's fame. Ah me!'&#xD;
and he rode back to headquarters, wondering whose turn&#xD;
next it would be to face the forlorn hope-such a singular&#xD;
number of which this Rebellion has developed.&#xD;
" But there was no flinch in Colonel Thomas W.-no&#xD;
&#xD;
flinch in his men. They all saw the hazard ; but they were&#xD;
Men and Soldiers. They knew how to obey orders, when&#xD;
their superiors did not. But then again, they had no hopes&#xD;
of success in a general election ; they had no 'little game.&#xD;
"'Their's not to reason why,&#xD;
Their's but to do or die.'&#xD;
And they done it !&#xD;
" On, on, like more than Spartan heroes, on they dashed,&#xD;
literally, as absolutely as anything earthly can be, 'into the&#xD;
jaws of death--into the mouth of hell.' I have a minnie bul-&#xD;
let on my table that plowed a furrow through a brother's&#xD;
heart of mine in that same dreadful valleyI Away they&#xD;
went-that gallant band, that gallant man ; and many a bul-&#xD;
let went crashing through skulls and bones as they went ; and&#xD;
many a soul sped its way to God ere the cohort reached the&#xD;
knoll in the valley. Once there, they were no longer men-&#xD;
they were as sublime exemplar gods. But a man fell-fell&#xD;
before the resistless force of a hundred horses charging with&#xD;
all of Treason's vehement strength, and the gallant man went&#xD;
down, and the thunder of iron hoofs exploded in his ear, and&#xD;
then the cloud passed on.&#xD;
" And Thomas Clark went down-down, as Truth, and&#xD;
Justice and I went down ; but he rose again-so ever does&#xD;
Truth and Justice ; and as for me, e renais de mes cendres-&#xD;
let those beware by whom I fell.... Down to the gory soil&#xD;
he went ;but even while the woman sat there in the grotto,&#xD;
gazing till her eyeballs fairly ached with intensity-sat gazing&#xD;

&#xD;
with suppressed breath, so still was she-sat gazing, her&#xD;
blood on fire, her pulse beating three hundred to the minute,&#xD;
beating with a deep, fierce, tumultuous fire; sat gazing stilly,&#xD;
while her heart bounded and thumped within its bony citadel&#xD;
as if impatient of its duress, and longing to burst its taber-&#xD;
nacle, and let the imprisoned soul go free ; sat gazing, while&#xD;
her eyes, large grey eyes, all the while gleamed with a light&#xD;
that proved her capable of giving birth to heroes-even&#xD;
while thus she gazed on the wheeling squadrons, the charg-&#xD;
ing hosts, and the great guns, as they gave forth their fiery&#xD;
vomit, charged with sudden deaths-the man, Toni Clark,&#xD;
sprung to his feet again, and, as he staunched his blood with&#xD;
one hand, he pointed with the other at the foe. 'Follow me!'&#xD;
he cried. 'See ! we are reinforced ! On to victory-on 1'&#xD;
And his voice rose above the tempest, and it flew over the&#xD;
spaces, and it fell upon the ears of a 'great man,' and the&#xD;
'great man' wrung his hands, and he thought : 'Not dead&#xD;
yet ! Damn the fellow I- He will make us win a victory-&#xD;
and that'll never do ! Dear me ! that cursed fool will spoil&#xD;
my little game !  Oh, for night, or a fresh division of-the&#xD;
enemy I I must reinforce him, though, else it'll get into&#xD;
that infernal Tribune-or into that cursed George Wilkes'&#xD;
paper-and that'll spoil my little game ! Ho, there ! Aid,&#xD;
go tell General Trueman to reinforce Colonel Thomas W.&#xD;
My little game !' and he arranged his epaulettes and gave his&#xD;
moustache an additional killing twist. In the meantime,&#xD;
Tom Clark had charged the enemy with bayonets with the&#xD;
remnant of his own force, followed by hundreds whom his&#xD;
&#xD;
example had transformed into something more sublime than&#xD;
fighting soldiers.&#xD;
" And now occurred one of those conflicts which make or&#xD;
mar the fortunes of a nation : one of those terrible multi-&#xD;
personal combats which mark a century's history, and strike&#xD;
the ages dumb with awe ; one of those terrific scenes in the&#xD;
world's great drama, that mark historic epochs, and enshrine&#xD;
men's names in fiery letters upon the scrolls of Fame.&#xD;
" The charge and the action were short, sharp, swift, des-&#xD;
perate ; but at its close the&#xD;
"'Flag of the Planet gems,&#xD;
With saphire-circled diadems,'&#xD;
floated proudly over the scene of Treason's battle lost--a&#xD;
Nation's battle won !&#xD;
"Day closes again ; and the wounded hero in an ambu-&#xD;
lance was borne fainting-almost dying, from the field.&#xD;
'Colonel Clark, can I do anything for you ?' said one of the&#xD;
fighting generals to the stricken man--a bullet had gone&#xD;
through him. 'You are a noble fellow, and I speak for my-&#xD;
self, your comrades in arms, and for our country. Can I-&#xD;
can they, can we, can she-do anything for you, in this sad&#xD;
hour of your destiny ? If so, I beg you to speak.'&#xD;
"'Alas ! no, my friend,' replied he, reviving, only to swoon&#xD;
again. A little cold water on his temples partially dissipated&#xD;
the coma, but not all the fog from his perceptions ; for his&#xD;
general's words, 'Can she,' considerably obfuscated his intel-&#xD;
lect, and he thought : 'He means Betsey-that's the only&#xD;

she I know of.' And then he strengthened up for a last dy,&#xD;
ing effort ; strove to collect his thoughts, partly succeeded,&#xD;
and said : 'Nothing more, dear general. Yes. No. I'm-.&#xD;
dy---ing--going--home. Tell Betsey-dear Betsey-I did&#xD;
not-find her out till-it was-too-late. Tell her that I&#xD;
loved-her from my--soul-at last. Tell her-that'-----&#xD;
" She can't stand the pressure any longer-globe, or no&#xD;
globe, hermit or no hermit-not another minute. You Bet !&#xD;
It's a pretty how de do, me a settin' here, and poor Tom&#xD;
laying there, killed a'most to death !' shrieked the fair girl&#xD;
in the grotto of the hermit of the silver girdle, waked up&#xD;
beyond endurance, by the skillful magic of the weird recluse.&#xD;
And repeating the Californian, 'You Bet !' with vehement&#xD;
emphasis on the last word, she sprung to her feet, in spite of&#xD;
the warnings of the man who dealt in magic crystal globes in&#xD;
the precincts of a forest wild-upsetting table, tripod, stool&#xD;
and hermit, in her eagerness to reach Tom's side and give&#xD;
him wifely ministry.&#xD;
"cWhat luck she might have had in bridging Phantom&#xD;
River I know not, having omitted to remain long enough for&#xD;
inquiry, not having had time, to thus devote ; but this I do&#xD;
know, namely, that she nearly kicked the veritable Mr.&#xD;
Thomas W. Clark completely out of bed-the bed at whose&#xD;
foot was a window, whose upper sash was down-the identi-&#xD;
cal window through which came all the 'funny things' of&#xD;
this most veracious history, which, of course, is all true.&#xD;
Betsey woke from excitement, Tom from being kicked, and&#xD;
both had finished their double dreams.-&#xD;
&#xD;
"' What'n thunder's up now, Bet-no, Lizzie, I mean ?'&#xD;
said he, checking the less respectful utterance, and modulat-"&#xD;
ing his voice to what he doubtless intended to be a 'velvet-&#xD;
dulcet cadence,' but which wouldn't pass for that in Italian&#xD;
opera. .'Not nothing, Tommy, dear.' 'Not nothing, Liz-&#xD;
zie ?' 'Not nothing.' .'That ain't grammar, sweet.' 'I&#xD;
was paragorically speaking, my turkle dove ! Only I've&#xD;
been having two very funny dreams.' 'You ! Two dreams ?&#xD;
That is queer !' 'You Betw' 'What about, Lizzie ?' 'Oh,&#xD;
all about how we didn't love- each other -as we ought to,&#xD;
husband.' 'And, dorg on my buttons, wife, if I haven't had&#xD;
two just such dreams myself-all about a precipice, and a&#xD;
pile-Oh, wasn't it a pile, though ?' ' You Bet !' ' And my&#xD;
dreams were all about how I ought to love you, and didn't-&#xD;
and then, again, I did.' 'That's a dear!'  'You Bet!'&#xD;
'Let's love each other this time out, will you ?' ' I will ;&#xD;
will you ?' 'You Bet!' 'Let's profit by our dreams. I&#xD;
mean to ; won't you ?' 'I'll try !' 'i'll try!' 'We'll both&#xD;
try!' 'You BET !' And they tried to forgive and forget.&#xD;
"Will you do the same ?" asked the Rosicrucian of the&#xD;
"Angular Character," who had told his own story in dis-&#xD;
guise. The latter saw that his secret was out ; yet his heart&#xD;
was touched, for, as a great tear-drop rolled down his cheek,&#xD;
he said, with smothered breath, the holy words-" I'll try!"&#xD;
" Amen !" said the Rosicrucian. " Amen !" said we all ;&#xD;
and then, turning to his auditors again, the story-teller said :&#xD;
" Friends, go thou and do likewise; and so long as you live,&#xD;
I charge you never to forget the Rosicrucian nor his story ;&#xD;

IT ISN'T ALL RIGHT ;&#xD;
Being an Answer to, and refutation of, the modern doctrine&#xD;
that " Whatever is is right." The book is an eloquent de-&#xD;

what she is. Nothing in the language speaks more forcibly&#xD;
for fallen woman than this rare pamphlet.&#xD;
