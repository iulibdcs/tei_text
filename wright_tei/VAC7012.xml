How sonorously and majestically the great cry from many-throated Valerien rang out on the crisp morning air, as we reached the hill-top, and, leaving the carriage, stood where we could see the gigantic fortress, with the tricolor still waving defiantly from its lofty top! With our glasses we could distin- guish the gunners, working by signals; and, down in front, the advanced battery loomed up, with its tre- mendous guns setting their yawning faces impudently against the sky. In the distance lay Queen Lutetia, clad in sackcloth, and dumb in her anguish. Only 'her defenders spoke, and their voices were brave and loud. The gunners had often before fired at this point, but their attention was evidently turned elsewhere on this occasion, for not a shell fell in the valley as we 9  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7012-00000006"/> 10   K.

All along our way we found suspicious sentinels, now watching long lines of wagons, laden with provisions and ammunition, or carefully observing any pedestrian, and quickly questioning him if he seemed to be making signals towards the fortress. In the little village under Marly Hill the old women were sitting in their cottage doors, trying to bask in the winter sunlight, and the Bavarians quartered there were bringing water, and aiding in the simple morning duties of the household. A tall, gaunt sergeant, who had apparently been recently wounded, was teaching a lame child how to sing. Thus hand in hand went peace and war, and no one seemed to wonder. Along the Seine, from whose farther banks the French lines were not distant, we rolled, and at noon climbed the lofty terrace of St. Germain.- The post commander, magnificent in sky-blue uniform, received us in the parlor, which he had converted into his head- quarters, vised our passes, and kindly intimated that we were at liberty to breathe thereafter. We took dinner at a little auberge in the town's centre, and people stared when we chatted loudly in broadest American. An under officer, who was rapidly absorbing a poor quality of beer by very large po- tions at the rate of one every five minutes, told his neighbor at the drinking table that he thought we   -        A I'AT MONTMORENCY.      " looked suspicious; whereupon Cocoon and Kentucky fell to talking German, and managed to convey to the beery under-offlcer's mind, without offensive person ality, the idea that he was a thorough-bred ass Meantime the coachman dined tranquilly on his box and sent to us to say that he had heard that the beer at St. Germain was excellent, and would we object to his having a glass? Kentucky, Cocoon, and I had decided to make a toui around Paris, within the Prussian lines. For twc months we had been quartered at Versailles, patiently awaiting the result of Moltke's movements. We had filled our sketch-books, and studied every nook and corner of the headquarters-general. The last bit of disagreeable weather was gone, and it seemed a dismal prospect to quit Versailles, which had become for us a jolly campmig-ground, and to wander, risking out necks and fortunes, in the dismal war-labyrinth of en- cumbered roads, among cross officers, questioning sen tinels, and deserted villages, rained upon by the inju. dicious fire of the French forts, which lay outside the gilded fence surrounding the headquarters. Little Spriggins, of the London Blanket, had clattered in on his jaded steed only the night before, after a fatiguing excursion, and declaimed furiously against the treat- ment he had received. He had been fired at by a blackguard of a Wurtemberg sentinel, who didn't x ,  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7012-00000007"/> 12      KENTUCKYS'S LO VE. know enough to stand in the sentry-box when it rained! And forage! Not so much as would feed a starving mule. The soldiers in, the villas were burn ing out the ceilings and doors for wood. The com mandants were surly, and especially cross to any one speaking the English language; and, as Spriggins was galloping through the wood of Avray, a beggar in a Bavarian uniform wanted a new kind of a pass, and dragged him to the guard-house because he could not produce it.  So said Spriggins, and even idded, with a warning gesture, that the Saxons firmly believed that every stranger who arrived in that portion of the siege lines held by them had descended in a balloon from Paris, and therefore merited ignominious and immediate death. And when Spriggins said death, he gave a horrible gurgle, and made a crackling noise with his lips, which sounded. much like the unwelcome arrival of a needle-gun bullet among the quivering tendons and sinews of some trembling victim. Allowing for exaggeration, the prospect was not engaging. Early on this very morning we had assembled in the breakfast-room at Madame Varlin's, in the second story of an elegant mansion in the Place Hoche, at Ver- sailles. Breakfast was on the table, and Kentucky grumbled satirically as he saw us linger over the chicken and the wine.   AT M ONYTM ORENCEY. Y. "' Come," he said, impatiently; " do you think that man was made for nothing but to absorb Mocha from morning till night? Let's be off. I am anxious to sleep in Montmorency to-night." And a narrow escape he had from sleeping in Mont- morency's least commodious guard-house that night. But he was not to be frightened easily - he who had followed guerrilla Morgan in his daring raids, and slept on fence-rails, with water running down his spine, night after night, because, forsooth, he thought it his duty. My gaze followed them admiringly as they stood on the hill-top together, looking at Valerien. Kentucky was tall, gaunt, yet not devoid of grace. There was a manly courtesy and chivalhic deference in his every movement, and the real look of command in his eyes. He had been serving in one of the international ambu- lances, stationed atMetz, as a volunteer aid, when that fortress was captured by the Prussians, and had been sent to Versailles as a nominal prisoner of war. His parole was irksome to him, and he gladly joined us in the prospect of an extended visit to the out- posts. Cocoon was standing close beside his friend, and leaning lightly on his arm. The cheery but cold win- ter light touched the face of the youth, and threw it into strong relief beside the grim, impressive face of the southerner. Cocoon was twenty-five, an artist,   i  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7012-00000008"/> "      gENTUCKY'S LOVE. with one of those sensuous faces on which passion and pain are so quickly and curiously written. He did not seem like a youth, but rather like a man of mature years, save for the mobility of his features, for he was bearded like a pard; and even his white teeth, his eyes of fire, and his lily hand, detracted nothing from the gravity of his appearance. He was Kentucky's opposite, but their love was unchanging and unal- terable. When they had had their fill of the landscape, they came back to the carriage, and we reached St. Ger- main with no adventure, and nothing to remark save the one phrase which fell from Cocoon's lips, - "Despite the beauty of the morning, I feel as if I were going to my own execution." "You sat up too late last night," answered Ken- tucky, grimly.  After the dinner at St. Germain, we rode away through the forest, and Cocoon and Kentucky mount- ed the two horses which we had tied behind our carriage in leaving Versailles. I rode with the coach- man on the box, and heard thrilling anecdotes of the cruelty of the invader. The grand, ancient forest was sublime in its winter garb. Through its long and dim aisles there were no sentries posted; no tired and sol- emn columns of helmeted soldiery were dragging their slow lengths along; all around was profound calm.   :His       AT MONTMORENCY.        1 Now and then the roar of the sullen cannon was faintly heard; but one might have imagined it the fall of some giant tree- which I resolutely did -delighted with even a momentary opportunity to shut out war and its dreary horrors from my thought.   ,  At the end of the wood, through which we had taken a short cut, we speedily found war again, ho-ever. A sentinel warned us to keep-away from the bank of the river, as the French pickets could easily give us a Chassepot quietus; and a mile farther on, at Maisons Lafitte, we found all the bridges gone,save that serv- ing as the railway viaduct. "Could we cross?" we asked a blear-eyed and starved-looking peasant by the road-side. He didn't know. Was he there to give information? Certainly not. Who paid him for it? Would that hinder us from taking all he had in the world, and not even thanking him for it, impolite set of beasts that we were? But we were travelling Americans -- In that case we should find the viaduct in good or- der, and we must hug along under the hill. By no means take the lower road, as there we were exposed to picket-firing and the shells. Ah! it would do our hearts good to see the manner in which the brave boys in the forts dropped them in! Doubtless; and we dared the shell-fire of Valerien   &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7012-00000009"/> 16      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. once more, this time within easy range, and soon found ourselves in the dilapidated town of Sartrouville. The road towards Argenteuil and Montmorency, in which latter town we had decided to pass the night, brought us nearer and nearer to the French lines as the afternoon waned rapidly. The roads were villa- nous, and marching columns of soldiery impeded our progress. "Coachman," said Cocoon, "if you don't whip up, we shall have to make a night of it by the road-side. Hloup-la!" and we creaked on, no faster than before. At Argenteuil the sun was dazzling, as he began his rapid descent, and we stood enchanted at the superb spectacle offered by the river, the picturesque grpup- ing of the houses, the old windmill observatory on the hill, and the long and graceful avenues, tree-bordered, impressive. But the town's water-side street resounded with the hiss of bullets coming from the French lines, and occasionally a piece of lead flew above our heads. Suddenly the sky grew dull and dun, and we were amazed to see that it was almost sundown. The coachman whipped up in earnest, and we began to climb the road to Montmorency. It was dark when we stopped on the summit of the hill, from which, at noonday and midsummer, one may see a landscape which neither Poussin nor Lorrain would have disdained. But the lovely valley was   p6g      '    MAT MONTMORENCY      1 shrouded in an obstinate mist, and even the bold forms of the hills could not be discovered through its impen- etrable veil. The mansions were all deserted; the tall shrubbery in the gardens, stripped of their straw coverings, appeared ragged and desolate; and, as we picked our way carefully along, we came suddenly upon a post of Prussians, evidently much annoyed at our arrival, and who insisted that our papers were irreg- ular. Kentucky volunteered the statement that the sentinel did not know his business, whereupon the offi- cer of the day was sent for, and we were compelled to descend from the carriage,-and allow the over-suspi- cious warriors to fumble in it in search of " anything compromising." A  tall figure, wrapped in an oil-skin coat, strode towards us. "What have we here?" he began; but Kentucky's German checked him.  Passes from  the royal headquarters- where are they?   Good; but you must all go to the commandant's." He pushed forward: we followed, down the other side of the steep hill, and our trembling coachman guided his jaded brutes as best he could along the muddy declivity. The major commanding was comfortably installed in a huge villa, and was smoking a good cigar, and reading the day's reports, as we entered. "Prisoners?" he said, darting eagerly towards us. "Yes - but American prisoners," said Kentucky: 2   &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7012-00000010"/> 18      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. The major examined us from head to foot. He took his cigar from his mouth, and walked around us; re- placed it, and walked around us the other way; then stood in front of us. "From Versailles? Your papers!"' He collected them, and, seating himself before the table, spread them out and read them. He turned them over, and, placing his hand protectingly upon them, called in a harsh, loud voice, - "Heinrich!" Heinrich appeared, clad in his fatigue uniform, and with a toasting-fork in his hand. A mysterious order delivered in a low tone of voice. Exit Heinrich. ' Guard-house," said Cocoon to Kentucky. "Not yet," answered the ex-guerrilla. The major then read the passes again. He read them between the lines; put on his glasses and exam- ined the stamp. Again, in a harsh, loud voice, he cried, - "Franz!" Franz appeared in his fatigue uniform, and with a general flour-dustiness about him. He had evidently been bringing bread from the store-wagons. !"Offer the gentlemen some cigars." We all smoked in silence. Re-entered Heinrich, "Yes," he stammered, "the butcher says if they   AT MONTMORENCY.        19 want the top room, he doesn't care, and if a bundle of straw can make them happy, well and good; but he won't cut another joint of meat to-night without ex press orders. And he says that Hans will bring you a nice bit in the morning as he passes, if-" "Gentlemen," said the major, rising, "you are quar- tered with the company butcher, in a little villa on the hill-side. If the gentlemen are artists, and wish to sketch, as the officer of the day explains, they nmust come to me in the morning, and promise to make no drawings of anything near the outposts, and to allow me to see their sketches before leaving. Otherwise-! Herr Lieutenant," addressing the tall figure in the oil- skin coat, " the gentlemen may retire. Good night." The baron, who was lieutenant in the Ninety-third Anhaltischers, quartered at Montmorency, became very affable. He accompanied us to our quarters. The coachman brought up the rear. We entered a neat villa, empty above, and with the company butcher and a dozen soldiers in the rooms below. There was a stable opposite, where the coachman soon stowed him- self and the weary beasts, and gave them to eat fionm the forage bundles brought from Versailles. We dragged our provision hampers up stairs, made a fire on the desolate hearth in the largest room, lit a candle, put blankets up at the windows, and the lieu- tenant despatched a soldier for two bundles of straw.   &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7012-00000011"/> 20      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. "Now," he said, "come to my quarters, gentlemen all, and my corporal shall play on the piano, while I give you a roaring good supper." The guns of St. Denis broke the silence. Boom! Thunderous echoes drifted up through the mist. "Never mind that," said the lieutenant baron; " we have an alarm every night. Without it we should stagnate." We accompanied him to his quarters. They were c6sy, and there was furniture. "Droll," said the lieu- tenant; "this house was a German's,-some rene- gade Heine, I suppose,- and the French drove him out long before we crme.  I found it fitted up nicely." A soldier served us a smoking hot bowl of Erbswurst soup, some black bread, cheese, and infinite red wine. The corporal entered, and played the piano. The dreamy ecstasy, the passionate glory, the divine aspira- tion of one of Beethoven's sonatas trembled on the air. The tears glistened in Cocoon's eyes; Kentucky smoked solemnly; I lost myself in the music. The guns of St. Denis boomed wearily, "On the whole, I am glad we came," said Cocoon. "Gentlemen," said the lieutenant baron, " have some fresh cigars?" I looked out of the window, and could see that the   AT MONTMORENCY.        21 T'i  mist still hung over the valley. The great voices of the hidden guns seemed like the cries of souls ir pain. Meantime the corporal played Von Weber's mourn ful "Last." x;V1, I  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7012-00000012"/> 22      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. CHAPTER II. A DYING MAN'S GIFT. HE soft, pleading, reverential glory of measures from Beethoven's Fourteenth Sonata still lin- gered in my ears. I remembered vaguely a New England parlor, with the quiet carpet, the stuffed chairs, the faint odor of flowers, the book-rack in the corner, and the piano, with a fair young girl seated at it, gently musing as her white fingers wandered over the whiter keys, and evolved the tender melody which had so stirred the great master's soul. And while the baron's corporal was playing the longing notes of the spiritual Von Weber, my thought reverted to that por- tion of the Sonata into which Beethoven poured all the fervid passion of his pent-up heart, in which his soul seems to cry out for sympathy and help, in which the theme is lost in the grandeur of the cry. I did not wonder that Cocoon was moved, and I felt like rushing out of doors, and rambling over the hills amid the enshrouding mist. "I    A D YING MAN'S GIFT.      2E Then I remembered that in less than five minutes my ramble would be rudely interrupted by the appari- tion of a gleaming gun barrel and the harsh accents of a Prussian provincial. This brought me back to the soldier world surrounding me, and I cowered in my corner of the old sofa, dejected and almost angry at the circumstances into which I had thrust myself. Cocoon, too, seemed to have overcome his emotion, and was gayly chatting with the baron, who sat, imper- turbable and grim, in his arm-chair, and regularly stretched out his arm for the huge glass containing a copious draught of the red wine, which disappeared down his capacious throat. From time to time he called a soldier-servant from the penetralia of the kitchen, and assured himself that no unusual agitation at the outposts was manifested by increased boom of cannon and crack of picket shots. "It is too misty for fighting," he said, in a business- like tone; and when we rose to go to our quarters, he threw aside his, cigar, and wrapping a -heavy cloak around him, added,- "I will accompany you. Some belated soldier might take it into his head to arrest -you, and then our good major would be awakened for nothing, and would get into a passion." The silence of death hung over the streets. There was here and there a faint light in the lower room of &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7012-00000013"/> 24      KENT UCKKY'S LOVE. some house, but no noise. Were it not for the occa- sional clamor of the forts, one might have imagined himself in Pompeii. We reached our villa without adventure, and mounted the stairs wearily. The fire had died out, and the night breeze came in coolly through a broken window pane. The baron bade us a kindly good night, and we threw ourselves on the straw without even taking off our muddy boots. Co- coon had a spasm of jollity, which the Kentuckian growled at, and I lost all note of moods and time five minutes thereafter. The loud knock of a soldier at the door awoke me before seven o'clock in the morning. The stalwart frame of a Prussian liner obscured the doorway. He bore a rough cooking pan, filled with water, in one hand, and a coarse towel in the other. "The gentle- men would perhaps like to wash," he observed, "and I am sorry to say that this is all the water we can spare." Cocoon refused to rise, but, snarling, pulled his blanket over him, and indulged in a semi-decorous snore. Kentucky rose, shook himself, and grifily surveyed Cocoon. "Come, my son," he said; "time to get breakfast." And he was soon in the yard, busily help- ing the soldier gather some pieces of the paling, with which to light the fire. I watched him from the win- dow, and saw him place a shining thaler in the Prussian's brawny hand. It happened that we had a piece of   Bj fi    A DYING MAN'S GIFT.       25 meat that morning, and the soldier was noticeably affable. And now uprose the sun through a bank of mist, and vanished again almost instantly. But the ray of light sent its gladness and its inspiration into all our hearts, and seemed to have given the gunners, at their posts in the French forts, new hope; for the thunder grew louder, and some soldiers who had been on out- post duty announced that the shells were falling very rapidly in the little town below. They thought a new skirmish was cotning on, and-hadiwe any cigars? So; thanks, and away they went, lumbering breakfast. ward in their heavy boots. While we were at breakfast, eating off from the little hamper in which our provisions travelled, Cocoon pro. posed an excursion Awards the outposts; and, after we had washed down the hastily prepared food with coffee which was only half-boiled, we donned our long coats, and set off at once for the major's villa. We found the commandant in a fiightful state of perturbation, and for some time he refused to notice us. Even after Heinrich had ushered us in, we hemmed and coughed, and Cocoon rattled his papers formidably; but all was of no avail. The major was walking up and down the room, and evidently cursing himself in German. He seemed much distressed, and when finally he awoke -.   &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7012-00000014"/> 26      EKENTUCKY'S LOVE.  From his abstraction, he turned to us and said, in the sharp, rough accents of his native province,-     ^ "Ah, there! I was thinking of you at this very mo- ment. The lieutenant, who was here just before dawn, tells me that you were surprised at my suspicions last evening. But you do not know how artfully the spies of the enemy work. Now, then, imagine my discom- fiture. I may tell you, fbr I see plainly that you are no Frenchmen, and I do not intend to let you get near enough to the outposts to do me any mischief. This post of mine is of vast importance to the investment lines, you understand. Well, despite the most ex- traordinary precautions, spies manage to come into our , lines, and to hold communication with some one or two starveling peasants who have lingered about here. Twice have I been tricked by a rascal from Paris, or  some town within the French lines, who has been here, and sent information to the French in Versailles.  Donnerwetter! if I could catch him, I would make short work of the carl! Pif! he comes into the lines; paf! he drifts all about, and scatters his accursed in- formation; and pouf! back he goes again, free as air,  light as a bird, careless as a feather. When you were  brought in last night, I was persuaded that he had  been caught, and that I was about to see him; but no!  Well, what is it?" Cocoon extended his pass; we followed his example. *       . *r X%   A DYING MAN'S GIFT.       27 "We should like to go down the hill to Enghien, and towards St. Gratien through the woods, if you have no objection. There is a good deal to be seen of the remains of the last skirmish, we were told at Ver- sailles." "No, not so much; but you can go, and remember, gentlemen, to show me whatever sketches you prepare to mail. Otherwise, the field-postmaster will doubtless bring them to me, and that will delay their departure." And he busied himself with giving our passes the ne- cessary vises. "So the French really do keep up an underground rail- road -  do they?" said Kentucky. "I hardly believed it before; and yet I have sometimes been much puz- zled to know how it happened that the people who never went outside the gates of Versailles were so well informed concerning their enemy's movements." We set off down the hill towards Enghien, under the shadow of an immense wall, and went rapidly Paris- ward. The morning was cold, and the mist had only lifted so that we could see a short distance beyond our noses. All along the way the soldiers were briskly coming and going, carrying bundles and orders from the villa of one post-commander to another; and, whenever there was a hiss more protracted than usual above our heads, we turned to listen for the dull thud of the falling shell.  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7012-00000015"/> 28      KENTUCK Y'S LO VE. At the end of an hour's walk we came to Enghien, into which the missiles of destruction were from time to time falling. "Lucky we did not come on horseback," said Ken. tucky; "we never could have made our way over these barricades." Cocoon leaped over one, singing, gayly, Rousseau's stinging lines,- "Les rois sont les mattres du monde; Les dieux sont les mattres des rois," and we came to the streets of Enghien. The great lake, which in summer was so glorious in  its basin hidden in luxuriant foliage, was frozen, and the promenades on the farther side looked desolate. A few soldiers were posted in the music-stand, which served as a kind of sentry-box and watch-tower; and one or two officers of the sappers and pioneers who were quartered there were still superintending the fell- ing of the magnificent trees. Cart-loads of fascines going up to the batteres on Montmorency Hill passed us. The drivers were pipping their muddied horses, and cursing in Alsatian patois. The lovely villas bore marks of shells, and grenades had been scattered like hail upon a superb bath-house, where all the invalids of Europe and the crippled ministers of America have attained new vigor. The soldiers had painted ;%(.   A DYING JIMA'S GIFT.      29 queer names over the doors of many of the houses. There was "Villa Napoleon," "Eugenie's Boudoir" and "Wilhelm's Rest." A brief promenade with an officer soon relieved the soldiers of their suspicions with regard to our presence, and we set off for St. Gratien, through the wood. The mist was gradually rising, and Cocoon fancied that as it rose, the firing grew heavier at the forts on our left; but Kentucky assured him that his imagina- tion played him strange tricks. The forest had a weird and fearful aspect, and as we, tramped through its long aisles over the frozen ground, I could not re- strain an occasional shudder; and I looked back, with a vague sense that something was following. Cocoon, too, seemed ill at ease, and from time lo time fell into the rear, and plodded thoughtfully, with his hands clasped meditatively behind him. Kentucky alone, of the trio, seemed alert and happy. "Come, my long-limbed son of the morning," cried Cocoon, at last, "don't stride away so rapidly. My breath is giving out. Ah, there is a house before us, at the end of yonder long avenue; let us stop and talk with the soldiers." "The soldiers" were not especially agreeable, and a sergeant lounged up, and sullenly asked if we were 6" army followers." Cocoon turned his back upon him, and Kentucky explained. We entered the gate-  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7012-00000016"/> 30      KENTUCKY"S LOVE.  way, and passed through a long avenue of queerly shaped trees into a kind of inner yard, where one un- washed veteran was playing the accordeor, and an- other was crooning a little melody in unison. There seemed some commotion in the house; uniforms flashed to and fro; a rotund voice was earnestly giving what seemed to me a vivid description of some re- markable event, and a guttural Sacramentl or Don- nerwetter! ejaculated from time to time, led me to con- clude that the intelligence was not of a pleasant char- acter. Kentucky, who listened intently while he was talking with the sergeant, who was now very attentive to us, gave us a wink from time to time, to signify that he caught the meaning, and when we were left alone for a moment, he said, hastily,- "Well, it seems that the spy over whom our friend, the major, was so excited this morning has been seen in the lines to-day, and a party is now scouring the outposts, and even venturing between the Jiines, in hopes of catching him. Those jabberers in the house are members of a party that narrowly escaped cap- ture two hours ago, venturing after him. The sergpant says that it's lucky we didn't meet any of the ex- ploring parties; they might have treated us roughly before we could have explained." Iwas just itting down on a broken chair which I was just sitting down on a broken chair which   A DYING MAN'S GIFT.      31 stood near the porch, and Cocoon was about to make some response to Kentucky, when the sharp report of a needle gun broke on the air, and was immediately followed by another. In a moment the yard was filled with the excited soldiery, many of whom rushed towards the gate bareheaded, and without their arms. The cry of Spion! Spiin! rang out loudly, and the men in the yard danced up and down with joy. "He is caught this time," they cried; and we listened eagerly.  For the next few minutes no noise was heard out- side. The picket firing seemed to have suddenly ceased. The silence became oppressive; and we were glad when the heavy tread of half a dozen in- fantrymen was heard, and they came up the alley, bearing between them the form of a tall and athletic man, clad in a bluish coat and dress trousers. He had been shot through the body, and evidently had but a few minutes to live. There was lan imploring look upon his features which was dreadful beyond expres- sion. The face had been imperious, beautiful, passion- ate; but the pain of two deadly wounds had some- what softened its haughty traits, and made it tender as that of a woman. The hands, which were white -;::: and patrician in outline, were clenched tightly, and the limbs were distorted by the agony which was fast overwhelming the life that had evidently been strong  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7012-00000017"/> 82      KENTUCKY ' LO VE. and active. A surgeon came forward and kneltiby the man, as he was laid upon a mattress hurriedly brought from the house; but he shook his head half mourn- fully, and rose at once. "Whoever he may be, he is past probing," he said. The man raised his hand feebly, and let it fall again. "You see, Herr Hauptmann," said a huge oldier with a shock head of hair and a bandaged arm, to his captain,- " you see that when I ventured outside the lines, and got this cursed Chassepot bullet through my wing, it made me angry; and I determined to have a -erack at something. So I hid in a little pile of brush that the pioneers had thrown up the other day, just in 4 the edge of the wood; and I lay in a kind of a shiver, wondering what would turn up next, and whether my arm would suffer from being bound so tightly, when all on a sudden a singular feeling comes over me, and I look straight ahead into the edge of the wood a little way off; I draw my breath hard, and I swear that I see a man's head come up out of the ground, close to the base of a huge tree, and then pop back like lightning." The soldiers all drew long breaths, and looked hard at the dying man, who had closed his eyes. "And you see, Herr Hauptmann, it flashed through my mind that it must be a spy - the spy, of course,- or a ghost. While I am deciding which, up comes the head again, slowly and cautiously, and I jump out, and   A DYING MAN'S GIFT.       33 run towards it. But I am brought up standing within ten feet of the hole, for there is an arm pointing a revolver At me, and I go down on all fours. Then I come up again just in time to find that the man is out of the hole, and running for the thicket. I am afraid I shall lose him in the mist; so I call out once, and Sacrament! I fire, for he doesn't stop. Just as I fire, some one drops him from the other side. And in the hole there were all these papers, hid where one would hardly suspect,- in the middle of a huge stone which seemed perfectly solid, but which had been sawn in two. Do you really think it is the right man?" The captain was examining the papers, and his face glowed with joy. "This is perhaps a great vic- tory," he said. "It probably saves many lives, but there is nothing very definite. We have this end of the underground railroad to Versailles, and to the French armies below Orleans;" and he hardly noticed the dying man. A convulsive shudder passed over the pale face up- turned on the bloody mattress. Cocoon knelt down beside the dying, and gazed earnestly and reverently. Suddenly the eyes unclosed, the hands were raised to the neck, and one of them convulsively clenched a locket, which had been hidden under the clothing. The spasmodic strength of the fast-failing man tore the locket from its chain, and the face was then lifted. 3  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7012-00000018"/> 34      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. The eyes fell upon Cocoon; the hands beckoned to him; and the hoarse voice said, with an indescribable agony and entreaty, this one word, in French:- "Give!"  Cocoon understood, and took the locket. The eyes, which were fastened upon the American's face with awful intentness, suddenly became lifeless; the head fell back; the man was dead. Cocoon closed the eyes, straightened the limbs, and covered the face.  "What did he give you?" said a soldier, suspi- ciously. "A locket-and   you can see-there is only a woman's picture in it." "Sacrament!" said the man who had shot the fugi- tive, coming forward; "he is dead before we could ask him anything. Well, there's one comfort; it was the spy; and many a long day will pass before the addle- headed Frenchmen can produce another like him!" The picket firing began to grow brisk again, and the gunners in St. Denis made the woods ring with the echoes from their cannon.    . THE ATTACK BY NIGHT.       35 CHAPTER   III. THE ATTACK BY NIGHT. T was, indeed, the spy for whose capture the major at Montmorency had longed so earnestly, and who had for weeks so tormented the Germans by his feats of almost incredible daring. For miles along the lines he was famous; and the post-com- manders had many times organized expeditions for his taking. A few daring fellows had lain out be- tween the lines for two or three days previous to his capture and death, hoping to see him, and to win the signal glory of taking him, dead or alive. A messenger was at once despatched to the major at Montmorency, announcing the good luck of In- fantryman Schuiiltze in shooting the dangerous and diabolical spy; and we felt much more at ease, since the soldiers now cordially received us, and were even anxious that we should make some sketches of them and of their headquarters. The dead man was laid in a room which had been  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7012-00000019"/> 36     -. KENTUCKY'S LOVE. used for an armory by the soldiers of the post, and  f his mute white face was covered with an old piece   i of drapery wrenched from the wall. His garments were. carefully searched, and every conceivable hid- ing-place for papers was minutely investigated. But nothing more than the soldier had foundin the species of cave which the spy had evidently made his refuge could be discovered. The spy had ap- parently been in direct communication with French generals in Paris, and there were certain notes, writ- ten in a curious cipher, intended for parties at Versailles. Of this we were informed by Kentucky, with whom the captain became confidential, after some little conversation concerning old days at Got- tingen university. Towards evening, the orders were passed along the lines in such a manner as to indicate preparations to repel a general attack. The "pioneers" were at work everywhere, strengthening the defences, and unusual vigilance was remarked. Many soldiers came to look upon the dead man, who was not to be buried until late on the following day. The early evening passed rapidly, as we listened to the hundred an- ecdotes of the adventures of the Frenchman, and vainly tried to unravel the mystery of his mission, and how he managed to find patriots who carried his news to Versailles.    Ir      THE ATTACK BY NIGHT       37 i, }37 Cocoon sat, almost sullenly, in a corner, paying but little attention to the hubbub of the soldiery, after the darkness and mist had driven us all into the huge kitchen of the old mansion. We had decided to remain until morning with the captain, and to return to Montmorency and our coachman (who was doubtless in agonizing suspense), during the next day, while Kentucky told strange stories, in Ger- man, of his confederacy experiences, and I mused on the events of the day. Cocoon seemed lost in reverie. He did not join in the frugal supper (which was served, and he would not even accept a glass of red wine. This was so extraordinary in the case of one whose soul ordinarily moved merrily to the music of his own happy thoughts, that we remarked it still more than did our hosts. I tried in vain to find a sufficient cause in the romantic and tragical ending of the spy, but could not satisfy myself that it was merely that circumstance which had prompted Cocoon's musing mood. Then I bethought me of the picture the dead man had so earnestly committed to Cocoon's care, and it seemed that, perhaps, the face of the woman might have wrought some charm -revived some old memory! I finally rejected that supposition, and, softly stepping over to Cocoon, quietly said,-     - "Cocoon, are you out of pills?"  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7012-00000020"/> 38      CKENTUCKY'S LOVE. He turned, half angrily, only to respond, in a fret- ful tone,-                      ' "It seems as if the mist would drive me mad. I wonder if the French will try to break out to-night? Ugh! Do you know, I fancy I can feel the hands of the dead now clutching mine, and the imploring eyes asking me to be loyal to the trust confided in me?"And he shuddered curiously, and looked un- easily over his shoulder. "Let me look upon the face, Cocoon," I said. The utter irrelevance, the pretentious cynicism, of my demand, seemed at once to astonish and wound hiIn. He turined towards me, his eyes widely opened, with an angry light in them, which, for a moment, was appalling. "I can't," he at last said, hoarsely. "It would be like sacrilege. Do you know that I feel sad and solemn over this new trust, and much as if some mysterious fate had led me here, to throw this dying man in my path, and that face before my eyes?  Will this accursed mist never lift? It weighs upon my soul!" I could ask him no more, and, turning hastily away, he fancied that I was angry, and caught at my arm, saying,- ", forgive me! I did not intend to offend you! My mood is stupid, I am sure!"   I? THE ATTACK BY NIGHT.       39 Again the old, unconquerably weird feeling which had so troubled me that very forenoon arose in my breast. I loathed and dreaded the house and all its surroundings, and would gladly have fled from it. It seemed to me that somethingi terrible beyond description-T-some nameless fate, was to date from that moment; and I felt like escaping. I could al- most fancy that we had strayed into an enchanted wood; that a magic spell had begun to work upon us, and to show us our entire helplessness before some awful and malignant power. Kentucky, meantime, was seated among two or three of the most intelligent of the soldiery, and was reading to them in English' from a little volume taken from his pocket. The soldiers were painfully following his slowly pronounced English, and listen- ing with evident delight. As I approached, his round voice rolled out this verse :-  "f So did she steal his heedless heart away, And. joyed his love in secret, unespied; But for she saw him bent to cruel play, - To hunt the savage beast in forest wide, - Dreadful of danger that might him betide, She oft and oft advised him to refrain Prom chase of greater beasts, whose brutish pride Might breed him scath unwares: but all in vain. For who can shun the chance that destiny doth ordain?"   &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7012-00000021"/> 40      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. One of the soldiers asked him to read the last line over again. "That's what I believe!" he cried, when he had got the full sense of it. And he repeated it to him- self, slowly,- "For who -can shun - the chance - that destiny- doth ordain?" "Who, indeed!" was Cocoon's refraii, as he stood looking over my shoulder, -but not at the little group. His gaze seemed fixed upon some far-off object, and his face was white and ghastly. "Are you ill?" said Kentucky, glancing up at us. "Your voice is as querulous as a woman's. Does the sight of death turn your stomach? Better take refuge in a pill." Cocoon paid no attention to his remark, but very soon went to the corner assigned him by the kindly captain, where a mattress had been laid, and wrap- ping himself in his blanket, was quickly lost in a pro- found slumber. By and by the soldiers followed Cocoon's exam- ple, and all, except the captain, and the guard corps in the next room, disposed themselves for sleep. A concert of emphatic snoring soon announced the easy triumph of Morpheus over their tired frames. The captain had a little room, in which a few   f lTHE ATTACK BY NIGHT.           41 articles of furniture had been left, and he invited Kentucky and me to step into it. As he closed the  door behind us, he said,- "Gentlemen, I have a most unaccountable desire to take another look at the dead spy. Now that the soldiers are asleep, let us step into the room where he lies, and permit me to gratify an almost irreverent curiosity." Something impelled me to refuse; but Kentucky was anxious to go, and insisted that I should accom- pany them. So we passed by a side door into the guard-room, and summoning a soldier with two can- dles, entered the room where the dead man lay. The dull odor of death smote upon our senses. The body had been decently disposed upon an ex- tempore bier, and was decorously covered. The cap- tain paused for a moment, with his hand upon his sword, as if he still feared that the dead enemy might arise and struggle with him. Then he stepped freely forward, and gently uncovered the face. "It is a fine piece of clay," said the captain, mus- ingly, as he took his cigar, which he had brought with him, from  his lips, "sand it must have been a gentleman. I suppose he was obeying some prin- ciple of enthusiasm which I cannot understand. It was almost a pity that he was dragged into this struggle. His must have been a very happy and&#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7012-00000022"/> td1   KENTUCKY'S LOVE. worthy life in normal times. Was there not a wo- man's picture in the locket he gave your young friend?" "Yes; which he wished given to her." "And how does your friend propose to find her? Was there any name upon the locket? Because- the woman must be a valuable person for us to know. Do you understand?" "There was only one word upon the locket, and that was - Margaret." "What! Margaret, spelled in the English fashion?" he asked, noticing my pronunciation. "Yes." "Queer - isn't it? That woman is of the greatest consequence to us. She must be found. She is per- haps doing us harm every day." "But, captain, she may be innocent. Perhaps it is his sister, or his sweetheart, who does not even know that lie has ever been a spy." "Sacrament! I am afraid it is my duty to ask your friend to give me up the picture." His words fell like a blow upon my heart. Give up the picture! I felt assured that Cocoon would not do it. "On the whole," said the captain, after a moment's reflection, "I don't know that that would be right, either. Only your friend must promise!fto .:have a   i; THE ATTACK BY NIGHT.      43 photograph made of it, - our field photographer has some instruments at Montmorency, - and to send me the copy." "Doubtless he will do that," said I, thinking of the possibility of Cocoon's refusal, when he knew what the captain wanted the photograph for. "No; that was not a common man, and it is a pity that we were obliged to be enemies. But I am glad that we did not take him unwounded. It would have been daylight, and a platoon of soldiers for him then, and that is horrible!" He re-covered the face, and turned away with a slight shudder. When we had regained, his room, he said,- "I shall not sleep to-night. I have some writing to do, and - You can throw yourself on my bed a while. You need it. No: lie down!" His last remark was so like a command that I obeyed; and in-a few minutes, his figure, bent wearily over his field writing-desk, faded froin my sleep- sealed -eyes. Crash!  It seemed as if, in the dream, I could see the cap- tain hurriedly approaching to awaken me from it. So grand and awful were the echoes of the cannon which I continually heard, that I felt angry that I was about  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7012-00000023"/> "     KENTUCKY'S LOVE. to be recalled from the dream world, and motioned him to be gone. Then a great cry smote through the bars of sleep, and I sprang to my feet shivering, as the captain cried harshy, - "We are attacked; and if you are to blame, you shall -" He said no more, for a tremendous rattle of mus- ketry, but a few yards away, made the windows shake, and he hurried into the yard to give orders to his men. My first impulse was to sit down; but I rebelled against it, and clamorously sought Cocoon. I found that individual quietly pulling on his great-coat, and preparing to go out. He paid no attention whatever to the really frightful tumult which seemed gradually approaching; but Kentucky, who was looking out of the window, despite the admonitions of a ser- geant, was sensible of the situation, and cried to me,- "The pickets have beenidriven in, and it's evident that a sortie is on at this point. This must be the advance guard, which has tackled the barricades a little way down the road, and the shells are falling like fun over in Enghien.- We shall be in the midst of it in less than two hours, unless these fellows are re-en- forced. Cocoon! where are you going? Comeback! Don't be a fool. Can't you see that we are suspected   TlHE ATTACK BY NIGHT.      45 now, and that it will not do to venture too far? If they had an idea that you desired to escape in the flurry, we should all be thrown into durance vile in ten minutes." Cocoon made an impatient gesture, but listened to reason, and remained tranquil. The captain re- turned, quite pale, and seeing us together said, hur- riedly,  "Gentlemen, if I am   wrong, I beg pardon; but your presence here in conjunction with this event is somewhat singular. I must trouble you to submit to a search, and if--" Just at this moment a shell fell with a tremendous crash at a little distance from the house. "And if you will comply quickly, you will save any trouble." Kentucky gave himself smilingly, Cocoon sullenly, to the soldiers. We all turned our pockets, our stock- ings, our hat crowns, inside out. Absolutely nothing compromising. Nothing in our boot soles or linings? No. At last German caution was satisfied - save in one particular. Did our passports contain no invisible writing? suggested the soldier who shot the spy in the morning. Kentucky set up a derisive howl, which effectually silenced further remark. The captain declared his be-   &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7012-00000024"/> "      KTENT1UCK Y'S - LOVE. :R lief that we were really travelling American artists, although he confessed that he could not see any excuse for our penetrating to foreign outposts so unseason- ably. While the examination was in progress, the cap- tain had been busily giving orders, and had detailed a number of soldiers to guard the immediate environs of the house. Along the line there was intense activ- ity, and the alarm-drum made the winter woods ring with its echoes. In the distance, towards Montmo- rency, we could hear the heavy rumbling of wheels from time to time; and the lessening of the musketry fire led us to the conclusion that the French (if, indeed, it was an attack, for the captain would tell us nothing) had been beaten back at the point nearest us. Finally we were allowed to go into the yard, and, climbing into an arbor which was covered with vines coiling about it like great serpents hibernating, we watched the flashes, and listened. Now and then a shell came unpleasantly near, and, responsive, defiant, we heard the round-mouthed oaths of the Germans. It was past midnight when the noise, of the ,fighting had awakened me, 'and nearly two o'clock when we climbed into the arbor. Just as we were beginning to flatter ourselves that the alarm was false, the battle noises arose again, fiercer than before, and strange lights glared atevery moment. The harsh scream of   a mitrailleuse was from time to time heard, and was inevitably attended by two or three short, spasmodic shots, which fairly shook the soil. The thunder swiftly approached, and Kentucky, whose hearing was of marvellous keenness, insisted that he could hear the French shouting. O clangorous, wild, indefinable music! Spirits of carnival and battle melted into one! How in those dread moments didst thou thrill our hearts, set the startled pulses flying, then still them with apprehen- sion, until life seemed a burden! The sensuous nature of Cocoon would not be con- trolled, and as he leaned over the arbor rail, peering into the night, I heard him softly saying to himself,- "What a vision the alarm-drum brings up! How grand it must be in the great city away beyond us! How I wish I could compass these whole vast fields now, and take in the full sublimity of the occasion! Belldrums - trumpets,-- lights of strange watch-fires on hills, -signals from r:oofs miles away, - steps on the pavements, - voices of women crying, 'May God pre- serve thee, O my loved one!' Every moment the wild burden of the music increases, and the intense, superb notes of the bugles, calling out the willing sol- diery, add to the charm. Now, mingled with this most inexplicable harmony of warlike sounds, come to my ears the thundering bursts of shells, near or    &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7012-00000025"/> 48      KENTUCKY'S LO E. far; and now the rattling of artillery wheels over the  frozen ground. How glorious the staccato of the  trumpets! The very notes have color!" Cocoon was totally unconscious that any one was listening, and said these words in a low, melodious  voice, distinct enough, however, to one so wont as I to  follow his soliloquies. Presently the battle-for it was now clear that a very decided attack upon this portion of the lines Chad partially succeeded, and that re-enforcements must soon arrive on the German side-came rapidly towards us, and some hoarse cries, in guttural anguish,  announced a retreat. Kentucky jumped into the mid-  dle of the arbor floor, and stood there for a moment, 0: listening like a sleuth-hound, his tall figure vibrating  in the darkness. "Ah," he cried, "'they are coming; there is nothing for it but to get out of these woods as rapidly as possible \ We must go with the Germans, or be lost! Come, Cocoon!"And we vaulted over the light rail as the hiss of bullets was heard all around us. "Where are you going?" cried the sergeant, run- ning in, with his arm bandaged, and his shock-hair bristling more than ever with excitement. "Stay here; don't run; there are only a few of them, and they have given some blockhead pickets a good scare. We are not strong enough here, and - Mein Gott "   THE A TTACI BY NIGHT.      49 This exclamation was forced from the sergeant by a tremendous discharge of musketry, which seemed at the very gates. A dozen Germans staggered back aghast, and, finally holding ground, began doggedly to load their guns anew. Suddenly, another dozen came rushing in in wildest disorder, crying, "They have got the barricade, and we must have more men." We stood awaiting whatever might come next, when all at once there was a trampling of feet from both ways; wild cries were heard around us; the soldiers guarding the gates fell back and fired wildly. Ken- tucky dropped down by the arbor, and was con- cealed. Cocoon and I stood as if paralyzed. Forty a  or fifty Frenchmen hurled themselves upon the men in the yard, and there was a brief and ferocious hand-to- l hand struggle. We managed to remain concealed near the arbor, and, although the bullets flew all about us, were uninjured. In suspense, the agony of which ,was beyond description, we awaited the result. The Frenchmen fought desperately, and cried out to those in the rear to come up, when a great torrent of stal- wart warriors, in glittering helmets and long drab coats, swept through the yard, searing, scorching, and maiming the little band of Frenchmen, and bearing it i away, bruised, disjointed, bleeding, dying.

The yard was cleared of the enemy, and the rough voices of the Prussian officers could be heard cursing their men, and showing them that there were no French re-enforcements com- ing at that point. "The fighting has gone farther up, and we are safe for the present," said the captain, coming in with an ugly flesh wound in one of his legs, and sitting down, to be bandaged, by a flickering can- dle's light, on the steps of the house. "Comne! get together; d'ye hear? and let me see who is dead!" In spite of their excitement, the men laughed. Kentucky came forward, rubbing his hands, and say- ing, in German,-- "It is hard to see a fight like that, and not take a hand in it! But you can rest assured that they are gone, and that the movement here has no importance. I've guerrillaed, myself, in the American war, and I know that those men were not in force. They didn't fight as if they were." The thunder receded, and nothing but the shells, which fortunately fell short of our house, were heard near us. The struggle to break through the lines was evidently increasing in intensity in the direction of Enghien. As the captain rose, and cursed one or two of his   THE A TTA K BY NIG   .     5 men for being laggard when the first alarm was given, the soldier who had shot the spy during the previous afternoon approached, with, a look of horror and amazement upon his face. He clutched a fellow-sol- dier by the arm, as if for support, and gasped, rather than said,- "Herr Hauptmann, the  body -is gone!" Every cheek was blanched with a new and nameless dread. In a minute the room where we had so lately seen the dead spy peacefully reposing Was crowded by curious gazers. The candle-light shone dimly on the rough bier where the corpse had lain, but whence it had vanished since the fight began. X  "Ja," said the captain, in musing vein, "who has got some schnapps? I begin to feel fatigued. The Frenchmen have carried off our spy, but they must X: have dropped him near here. Couldn't carry him far, :, eh  Well, we've got the papers!" and he trium- phantly pulled them out of his boot and exhibited them. "Bah!" he added; "we don't want the body as much as they do. Have some schnapps?" (to u s); and he began busily to prepare against a second attack. ;J  Cocoon went in, and threw himself wearily on his mattrass. The French had not entered any of the irooms where we had been sleeping, and the fire was still blazing bightly on the hearth; the arms hung glit-  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7012-00000027"/> terin on the wall; the saddle and lances of the two  cavaliers who had arrived in the night were undis- i turbed in the corner. It seened to me, as I looke arounld, as if I had dreamed the whole struggle, a I rubbed my eyes. But the roll of the musketry in the distance, the crashing of shells and hand-grenades in the streets of Enghien, convinced me of my error. 1 o -?e, , a r      s  asks  * 5I C* I  I r 2       } n I  ]' a ^'  -- -.-     t ^a ;-s     ;*:^b'K   CHAPTER IV.

It was the estimonial to an intense emotion of delight, a rand joy in the threnody of the forts, and in he inspiring melody of the distant musketry, which et the ashen color at his lips. Kentucky gloried 1 struggle, and his soul was delirious- drunk rith gladness. As he sat down before the fire, is wonted calm came slowly back, and he took 'om his breast pocket an ancient brier-wood pipe, lied it with tobacco, and, getting a brand from the re, lighted up, reflectively. After the few pre- minary whiffs, he turned to me, and said,- "So the body is gone. I suppose that spy is regular old Mephisto. Have a light?" "Thank you; no."

Nevertheless, that is the place for us. We shall gain nothing but suspicion if we remain here. Besides, Cocoon must get to Versailles. I prophesy a fever for the boy, and a serious one. You laugh. You always were a brute." His accent wounded me. "You are unkind, Kentucky," I said. "I have Cocoon's welfare deeply at heart. I will do what- ever you think best." Cocoon murmured in his sleep, and  his arms moved wildly about, as if he feared that some one was endeavoring to wrest a treasure from him. Morning came-dull, with the   deadening, de- pressing odor of battle filling the misty sky. There were, now and then, cool rain breaths; and when they had passed, one might have imagined himself in a charnel-house. Kentucky had taken a brief respite from the exciting events in sleep. I re- mained sleepless and miserable before the dying fire. Long before dawn, great masses of soldiery had been hurried past us, down  towards the front, and all along the line between us and the last chain of defences on our side, regiments were ranged in order for battle. The soldiers had nearly deserted our villa-post; and we found, on strolling into the yard, only a few wounded   ;s THE SORTIE FRO        PARIS.    55 men, who, regardless of the exposure, were anx- io!sly wandering about, listening intently to every discharge of musketry or cannon. The fighting in the direction of Enghien seemed to have died away. The huge fellow who had been the spy's captor came up to us, and, laughing, said, "That was a good   one last night! But it scared me when  I found  the body had been taken. Do you suppose it walked off itself?" And he eyed us as if he imagined that we had had something to do with the removal of the corpse. "Perhaps you would like to go back to Mont- morency," he added. "I am  going with a party in half an hour." "We will be ready," said Kentucky. And in thirty minutes we were all three marching silently ;  behind a file of cynical Prussians, who were de- tailed to return to the town, and recuperate their Y exhausted forces. When we reached the hill-top, two hours after, the mist was gradually rising, and we could dis- cern the great wood, spread out below, and the pretty town of Enghien in the   distance. Our coachman came rushing to us, as overjoyed as a Newfoundland  at sight of his master.

"Much good may this bauble   do you, young man," said the major to Cocoon. "Mind that it doesn't get you into trouble before you quit the lines. You must leave me; I am off again; very busy; colossal amount of work; adieu." And he left us in front of his villa, and strode away, witlh his sword clanging at his boot heels. Our coachman was a spectacle for the derision of gods and men. His cheeks were purple with fear, and his limbs trembled with excitement. He had harnessed his team twenty times during the fighting, and had made preparations to drive madly away, he knew  not whither; but each time he was stopped by the sentinels, who, on two occa- :; sions, narrowly escaped having his murder on their souls, so great was their anger at his persistence. When he saw   us marching in, pale, and night and battle worn, he became suddenly possessed of :  the idea that we were prisoners, and bout to be :X shot; and he had begun   awkwardly interceding ,for us in a broken German, which was too ludi- -:a! crous to allow even his employers to retain their :! self-possession. We laughed immoderately; and  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7012-00000030"/> 58      KIENTUCKY'S LOVrE.           i when we were "released," he did not hesitate to say that he was sure we were Prussians. Well gentlemen," he said, "you have it all your own way now; but it can't be so long!   The yen- geance of Paris will soon overtake you. Andc he crossed himself slyly, and looked askance at us, as if fearing that we were demons.               $ The mist had arisen by the time that we were ready to start on the second stage of our jour- ney; and a cold winter sunlight seemed pityingly to bathe in its impoverished beams the  gaunt and worn figures of the soldiery. The coachman shrugged his shoulders while he was hitching his poor beasts to the carriage, and murmured,- ",We shall all be massacred before night. They will kill me for a renegade." He evidently still cherished the belief that his countrymen were about to win a signal victory. Cocoon busied himself with the preparations for departure, but was abstracted and melancholy. He carefully tucked his blanket into the huge side pocket of the carriage, and placed his "map of the investment" under a cushion. He upset the pro- vision hamper, and angrily reproved the coach- man for coming to his assistance. Kentucky looked   THE SORTIE FROM PARIS.      59 quickly at me, and said, "We must get back to Versailles." But Cocoon would not listen to any such prop- osition. He was bound to undertake the whole journey throughout the investment lines, and was anxious to set off at once. The lieutenant-baron was still at the front; the major had not returned; and we rattled  away towards Gonesse, the next station of importance in the lines, coming gradu- ally nearer and nearer to the forts and to their crushing fire. Cocoon and Kentucky sat moodily together on the back seat of the 'carriage; and I, hearing the rumble of approaching wagons, mounted to my ac- customed   perch  beside the driver. Presently, through the semi-mist, a great train of lumbering carts, each drawn by a stout Norman horse, came in sight. Each of these carts contained three or four wounded soldiers, Prussians, Bavarians, Saxons, Wurtembergers, thrown, rather than lain, into the springless vehicles, each jolt of which upon the frozen road wrung groans of anguish   from   the suffering men. Many had lain upon the skirmish- ground, where they had been stricken down, for a whole day before they were cared for; and their limbs were frightfully swollen, their eyes were bloodshot, and their faces blanched by approaching  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7012-00000031"/> 60      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. death. One burly Bavarian had been shot through both cheeks, and his features were so distorted that they were appalling; but he clung desperately to the stem of his huge pipe, and from time to time blew a feeble cloud of smoke. The helmets hung on the cart stakes; and the majority of the wounded, with their fatigue caps drawn down over their eyes, lay flat upon their backs, clenching their hands and compressing their lips fiercely at each fresh agony. The drivers stopped us, and begged for water. "We can get none in this accursed country," one said, "and the wounded are getting  crazy." We were forced to admit that we had no means of relief at hand, and the train moved slowly forward again. A grimy, sodden, blood-stained, discouraged crew! A blear-eyed, bone-weary, motley gang! A section of the Inferno, ambulant and modernized! A great holocaust, thrown under the Juggernaut of Prussian ambition and German unity. And a sad and piti- ful sight, indeed, these dejected youths and bearded men, bleeding, writhing, and grasping at empty air. "Turn the cart off by the road-side a few minutes, or I shall die," cried one slender sufferer, as he was jolted past. In the following wagon, three Prussians, i badly wounded, were crooning a little song together, and interspersing it with curses and cries of agony.   THE SORTIE FROJ PARIS.       61 " X   AAn officer rode hastily by, and looked at them "curiously. "Halt!" he said; "these men must rest. One is dying;" as indeed it seemed. The Uhlans who rode beside the carts examined us curiously ^ and asked us whither we were going. Was there any graveyard made for German 'soldiers at Mont- morency yet? Because there were three dead men in one of the carts yonder, and they disliked to bury them by the road-side. On we went, throwing cigars, as we passed, to those who were strong enough to catch at them; and soon the ghastly train was left behind. We ran the gauntlet of shells at Gonesse' as the town was under fire; and after a hasty interview with the commandant, who was civil and unsuspicious we rattled  away over a level road towards the Iarne, still drawing g   ally nearer to the French :? lines. As we halted, two hours after we left Gonesse, the mist finally vanished into  ether, and the cloudless and inspiring joy of a great sunlight broke upon ind over us, deluging Cocoon's pale face with radiance. The coachman had stopped, at the command   of a party of surly Saxons, who came to   see our passes, and to growl at our  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7012-00000032"/> ;2      KENTUCKY'S LOVE.            4 [river for a rascal, when they found whither we   !: lesired to go. "He has been taking you off the  oute," cried a youthful sergeant, dressed in faded )lue, "and he ought to be hamstrung for mislead-  .? ng you!  But the coachman protested, in loud and noisy  Versailles vernacular, that to ignorance rather than nalice must his blunders be attributed; and after a careful examination of our maps, we moved for-  ward over a road in which deep ruts had been     l: worn by the passage of heavy artillery and bag-  gage wagons the day before.  Cocoon remained  silent, and apparently lost in reverie, assuming to care but little for the danger which we were slowly but surely approaching. Half an hour's painful progress over what a Saxon engineer officer was pleased to term his    road brought us to a point where three routes crossed, each leading in different directions into  the labyrinth of fields ploughed late in autumn, and i hastily deserted by the peasants, with the frozen potatoes still in their hills. Kentucky alighted  ! from the carriage, and cautiously surveyed the country round. Not a living soul in uniform was to be seen. In the distance the little River Marne  glistened cheerily under the winter sunlight, and ifii   THE SORTIE FROM PARIS.      63 the willows, clad in a garment of fiost, bent tenderly over the banks, as if peering after the men but lately drowned in a sudden and fruitless night attack upon the Wurtembergers. Afar off, a dense column of smoke rose slowly. Kentucky took his field-glass, and climbed to the carriage top. "The beggars have burned something," he said, musingly. "I can't make it out; it looks like a house, but it might be a haystack, and-" He descended quickly from  the carriage roof, for the tremendous whizzing of shell over our heads warned us that we were visible to the gunners upon one of the three forts which guarded the approaches to Paris from this direction. "It is evident," he continued, "that the coach- man is astray; whether from malice or ignorance it is difficult to tell; but I have something of the old guerrilla instinct left, and I declare for the rough road which leads through yonder field," and he pointed to an apparently unused route which led in the direction of a thicket, thence through "the field," and so on to a pontoon bridge. At this moment Cocoon came out of his ab- straction, and said vaguely, "What's the matter?" "Nothing," said Kentucky, "only we stand an excellent chance of straying into the French lines  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7012-00000033"/> "      KENTUCKY'S LOVE.  without knowing it; and, if we do, you will need a more abundant supply of your wits than you  manifest at the present moment." Cocoon uttered a scornful "Humph," and Ken-  tucky peremptorily ordered the coachman to drive down the route which he had selected.  No sooner had we passed a little gate, through which the carriage barely squeezed, than a perfect  torrent of shells came hurtling and screaming overl us, and the coachman, reining up his frightened  steeds, declared that he would go no farther.  "It's all very good for you, gentlemen," he said.  "You seem to hold life remarkably cheap; but,     i as for me, I have these two horses and a wife,  and life is worth something in my eyes. I wouldn't  pass that bridge for the best silver coin that King  William's army ever foisted on the unfortunate Frenchmen! La!" Kentucky coolly approached him, and drawing from his breast pocket one of the tiny revolversg vulgarly known in our extempore camp as "The  Neutral's Friend," gently placed it at the coachman's g head. "Forward," he said in French. "This is noi time for the same kind of nonsense which has lost  your countrymen so many battles.": The coachman mounted his box, swearing, and  we arrived at the bridge without mishap.    THE SORTIE FROM PARIS.       65 A  party of Wurtemberg  officers were seated about a fire made of fence rails, vigorously puff- ing at long clay pipes, and consulting maps. Ken- tucky accosted them in German, inquiring if it was safe to pass the bridge; and after an exhibi- tion of passes and of politeness which somewhat reassured even the timid driver, we formed what might have been called a strategic procession. "You see," said the officer who was in com- mand of the post, "the Frenchmen have pretty good glasses, and if they observe a huge black mass, they are almost sure to hit it; but go it piecemeal, and you  will get over safely."  So the two horses were unhitched, and trotted briskly over the bridge. Three soldiers then  attached themselves to the shafts of the carriage, and rat- tled it merrily across. We traversed the spring- ing line of planks without fear, and arrived safely on the other bank just as two shells struck in the iiver current with an ominous plash.   The coachman hitched the horses once more to the ark, as Cocoon denominated the carriage, and we drove vigorously towards the scene of a battle which, we were assured, had been of greater and more appalling proportions than any of the many struggles round Paris. As we arrived at Malnoue, a little town thronged 5  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7012-00000034"/> "      KENTUCK Y'S LOVE.  with dirty and drunken Wurtembergers, we were    i quickly stopped with the ejaculation from a greasy sentinel, "Fools! if you go on that way you will be at the outposts in twenty minutes, and you    g will get short' shrift there." So we drove back to Jo the bridge, and were compelled to take the main   : road which led directly to the rear and to the base of supplies in the little town of Lagny. It was very late, very dark, and a slight rain was   X falling. As we drove through the crooked streets of the old town, the coachman pulled up   his  horses with a cheery "  poup-la!" before the door  of a decayed hostelry. No friendly host came to   g the door to welcome us; no lights gleamed from the windows, but a sentinel motioned us to drive on, and the demand for quarters only provoked a derisive smile. Dreary processions of French peas- [: ants, forced by the conquerors to work upon the  roads, and to drive forward towards headquarters  i: the sheep and  oxen destined for the ravenous   : maws of the seven hundred thousand invaders, passed us without even giving a curious glance.  Lancers, infantrymen, and hussars, guarding little groups of prisoners, hurried towards the church in J  which some six hundred Frenchmen were already   tif imprisoned; and when the blood-stained and weary  ' gang faltered for a moment, the cavalrymen drove  ; :)   TitE SORTIE  FROM  PARIS.    67 briskly upon them   with their horses, nearly tram- pling them under foot, and swearing as only tired and way-worn Prussians can swear. There was no: com-- fort to be had in Lagny. We drove to the residence of the post-commander, and. received a severe re- buke; first, for appearing in the town at all; second, for being strangers; and third, for disturbing him at so late an hour. He gravely recommended us, how- ever, to turn back upon the route, assuring us that midway between Lagny and Malnoue we should' find a little hamlet, the dependency-of a castle, in which we could get shelter. The coachman swore by all the saints, canonized and uncanonized, that he would not do it -but did it. It was already midnight when we arrived before the   gates of the old chateau. A long train of post- wagons had just arrived, and the postilions were merrily sounding their horns. We drove silently to I  the rear of the procession and waited. Presently   came the responsive notes, brisk and full of cheery memories of Fatherland. Great gates opened, and I  we drove in upon a lawn, where were ranged several j!: companies of Wurtemnberg soldiers, grimly waiting the order to march. A gigantic Pomeranian, gay in all the colors of the Prussian military chrome, came forward to investigate us, and, after due explana- j  tion, we were allotted a room in a far corner of the !  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7012-00000035"/> 68      KENTUCKY'S LOV E. chateau, at the end of a long passage, which had once been enriched by many family portraits, but where now only two or three grim ancestors mourned  the departed grandeur. "We are just in time," cried one of the postilions; "there was a skirmish on our left shortly before : we reached the gates, and they say they expect an  attack this evening." The coachman was so delighted with the pros- . pect of shelter and food, and withal his courage was so fortified by the presence of the soldiery, that i he exhibited some little of the traditional French gayety; and after the horses had been stabled, brought blankets, maps, a provision hamper and a bundle of straw into the great room, barren of fur-  I niture, where many a French noble had slept in   X:h happier days. Cocoon and Kentucky, beset by the restless curiosity of the Yankee race, lit a candle  taken from the provision hamper, and strolled into  the passage to examine the portraits. I busied my- self with arranging the food, and tried to kindle a faint flame in the musty old fireplace. It was on the eve of a great battle. The previous attempts of the Parisians to break into the invest- ment lines had been worse than useless. The great struggle of the 21st of October had culminated in     9 I      ZiXTHE SORTIE PROI PARIS.     69 complete defeat of the French; forty days of suffer- ing had passed, and one more effort was to be made. General Ducrot had issued his famous motto, "I will re-enter Paris dead or victorious," and was prepar- ing to go out from the siege-stricken city at the head of one hundred thousand men. While we slept that night he crossed the River Marne on eight bridges, paused before the hill near the little town of Brie, and collected his forces into order of battle. He had chosen the weakest point in the whole investment line, --that occupied by the Saxons and Wurternberg. ers,-- and intended to break through. The spies had brought this news to the Saxon posts, and every- thing was in preparation. For miles along the line the artillerymen were standing beside their harnessed horses, and the regiments slept on their arms. At midnight came sleet and gloom. So accustomed had we become to the heavy cannonade that the crash- ing notes away beyond the hills, although they were intensified soon after midnight, did not awaken Is until nearly morning; but our hosts had been on the alert, and the Poeranian came to rattle at our door, and to warn us to be upon our guard, and not to venture among the soldiery. Kentucky did not heed this warning; but throwing his blanket over his shoulders, strolled out upon the lawn, and conversed with officers and men. Returning he said,- F^S         5^righ si,--,  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7012-00000036"/> 70-     EKENTUCKY'S LO VE. "Re-enforcements are arriving rapidly. An attack  began in the middle of the night; this is to be  grander than the little episode in the woods at En-  ghien. Stay," he said, opening a long window; " from ; this lattice you can look down upon the lawn." Inside and outside the walls large masses of sol-  diery were rapidly coming together. Commands were given in stern voices. We saw a faltering soldier  struck down by an officer's heavy hand, and heard a A great artillery train move off under the drip of the  sleet and rain.                   X Towards four o'clock the thunders approached;  the crackling of musketry, the deep voices of five  hundred cannon, spoke out; the distance was sur- charged with the angry echoes of battle. A recon- noitering party was organized, to mount a neighbor- ing hill; we obtained permission to go with it. We  went, skirting the forest which formed part of the  ancestral domain. We climbed a little hill, and,among l the masses of soldiery, waited. At sunrise a rapid and continuous firing by pla- toons began, only broken into by the furious barking  of the cannon. Every four minutes, with the cer-  tainty of desperation, intervened the hoarse scream  of the mitrailleuse. At last, so gigantic grew the  echoes, that we fancied we were about to see a rent  heaven and returning chaos.   TIlE SORTIE FROM O PARIS.  On that fateful morning some Parisian regiments W rere lying under the lee of the hill, grimly waiting the order to march. They, with the usual error thouglut that they were attacked, and no orders of the officers could rid them of the idea. They watched the brow of the acclivity. Suddenly camethe or  ore legion, to the front!" The imnemorial custom f French armies- putting the foreigners to the fro- was once more in vogue. A body of strong, valiant youJ, clad in a dun uniform, rushed forward. They formed into line and began the perilous ascent. There were Americans among them, and stout Yankee parlance was herd; there Were swart Italians, and lithe Spaniards, and brawny Irishmen. tnere and there in the lines was a Briton, cool and steady, glancing critically over the troops behind him. Two American boys and two Englishmen led the ascent.

Up the hill! up the hill' in the face of a perfectly demoniac fire; and at last, with yells of defiance, the  mass, now thoroughly aroused, dashed forward to a village. It was the little hamlet of Brie-on-the- Marne. Here the stout Saxons stood, resolved to  hold; and the constantly arriving re-enforcements put  new courage into their souls. Great heaps of masonry had been piled up to resist the enemy's fire, and can- nons grinned through the embrasures. Above the barricades appeared the heads of the Germans, who,  regardless of bullets, fired constantly. A deadly, wrecking stream of leaden missiles was poured from  the windows of all the houses. Again the ground was covered with the dead. Then the sturdy French liners went to work, and, with that terrible cry of savagery for which French troops are so famous, leaped to the  barricades, and the Saxons were driven from the town. The news was carried back over the hill, and the fifty  thousand men in the rear began to comprehend the situation. Over the masses of the dead they moved slowly up.

Cocoon studied the  maps, and I wandered, forlorn and restless as the spirit  of an unburied criminal, up and down, the trampled  and muddy lawn. The news of the taking of Cb mpigny went like lightning to Versailles along the extempore telegraph  line. Moltke sat. in his cabinet, silent, impassive, and wrote a message. Woe to the conquered then, for the whole second corps, the grand Pomeranian regiments, newly come from Metz, were moving on the enemy. The next day told the sorrowful tale. The army of Ducrot still held its position, but the morale of the men began to fail. It was altogether too much like I fighting, and the men murmured against their officers.  "Suppose we should be driven back!" they said; "who knows the way? what maps have we?"      ' ' Thus, rudderless, they drifted on the sea of doubt,  until- ' Early on the morning of December 1, the great mass of the Germans, divided into four columns, fell  upon the whole line of villages, and concentrated the full force of their troop upon Brie and Champigny.  And then it was the hour of vengeance for the Prus- '; sians; for, as the enemy came up the slopes, and ! pushed forward in the valleys, the galling, wounding,  crushing fire of Forts Rosny and Nogent was opened f; upon them. As the valiant men came up, the shells X L '   TILE SORTIE FROM PARIS.      7 fell so thickly into their ranks that a whole row of sol- diers abreast was swept away. The line of march was encumbered by the dead. Once only the Ger- mans wavered. Their officers rallied them, and when the re-enforcements, always coming up from behind, had got well to work, the French were driven out. On the mad charge through the villages, hundreds of wounded, who had been laid on mattresses, or tables, or benches in the open ail; were trampled down on the fiozen ground, and crushed to death. Back in hurried, dejected, and trampled masses rushed the ill- clad, ill-fed mob of defenders. The great sortie was ended. and only the dead ended, and only the dead, with their mute, pale faces turned up in solemn scorn towards the pitiless sky, remained upon the scene of carnage. Great waves of the battle-sea had swept near us, but none had touched even the forest which graced the grounds of the old domain. We had been spared the pang of sudden departure, hissed and hooted by the peasants, who would gladly have shot us, had they been possessed of weapons. Whole processions of wounded men, shrieking under the intolerable pain of gangrened and ill-cared-for wounds, were hurried past us in the direction of Lagny; and, in strange-and flippant contrast with the grumble of these unfortu- nates, long lines of solid and fresh soldiery tramped by, singing cheery national songs, going to take up their posts at points where the lines had been weak-  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7012-00000039"/> 76      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. ened by the tremendous slaughter. Blinding sheets of sleet fell occasionally, drenching the wounded, and, i in a short time, the lawn of the chateau was covered ;t with men whose arms, whose legs, whose faces had  been shot away. Cocoon and Kentucky found ample employment in caring for the wants of these sufferers, while I busied myself with preparations for our de-  parture. As the evening approached, the wounded were taken into the empty rooms of the great castle; the dead were placed in carts, and jolted forward to Lagny, where decent burial was to be given them, and the Pomeranian who had received us on the day of our  arrival invited us to visit with him the scene of the recent conflict. A few miles of galloping brought us  into a little wood where the fight had been deadliest  in character. Great heaps of half-frozen dead, the  bodies clinging to each other in the frosty atmosphere, Saxon and Parisian, Prussian and Norman, Wurtem-  berger and Breton, piled in indistinguishable masses together;- such was the sight which met our eyes on the field of Champigny that night! At the foot of a great tree two Frenchmen, liners, were lying side by ' side with locked arms, as if each had sprung to protect the other at the fatal moment. A young Prussian,  caught in the deadly hail of a bursting shell at the very moment that he was drawing his sword to cheer  on his men, stood stark and dead, braced against a    TH E SORTIE FRO  PARIS.     " sapling, with his hand tightly clutching the iron cross which he wore at his breast. The moon had risen, and threw an uncertain light upon these grotesque andl terrible forms. A few moments of tramping over the broken sur- face brought us to a little clearing which had evidently been fought for desperately by both sides as a vantage ground. Here lay, massed in one dread heap of bro- ken and disjointed life, twenty men. One Frenchman, whose blackened face and distorted limbs showed that he had been struck by a shell, lay stretched upon tle top of the horrible mass, with one hand raised in an appealing gesture. Beneath him was a young Saxon officer; with a deep wound in his throat, and his blue uniform stained with the blood which had borne his life away on its hot current, through a deep Chassepot wound in his breast. Two or three Prussians, with their flat caps drawn over their eyes as if some rev- erent comrade had passed that way, and gently ren- dered them the last office due to the dead, formed the base of this pile of slaughter. As I turned horror- stricken from the sight, the Prussian ambulance men approached, and began to separate the bodies, packing the Germans into carts, and leaving the French upon the field. A little further on we found another clearing strewn with dead bodies, and here both Kentucky and Cocoon sat coolly down, and began to sketch.  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7012-00000040"/> 78      gKENTUCKY'S LO VE.  CHAPTER   V. THE MYSTERIOUS LADY. AT noon, on the day after our visit to the battle- field of Champigny, we set off for Versailles, in the rear of a long train of wagons containing wounded men, and arrived at midnight, worn out and mud- dy, before the door of Madame Varlin's hospitable dwelling. The good lady received us with profound joy, and informed us that the French had won a tremendous  victory in the direction of Champigny. Had we not heard of it, and was it not grand and glorious? and if we needed protection in case the French came in, we had only to remain with her; it would not be best to fly with the Prussians! The good soul trembled with exultation. We could not bear to destroy the fond hopes which she cherished for the success of the French, and after a frugal repast of bread, cheese, and Burgundy, we hurried to bed, and were soon oblivious of spies, sud- -    THE MYSTERIOUS LAD Y       79 den deaths, lockets, adventures in harbors, battles, chateaux, ancient portraits, wars, and rumors of wars. Ten days afterwards, Kentucky and I were slowly walking along the snowy path which led to the great canal in the Park, at Versailles. The weather was clear, crisp, sparkling. A slight snow-fall the night before had clothed the tree-bordered avenues in gar- ments of spotless white. French peasants, muffled to their ears, were briskly brushing the snow from the ice, and already a few officers of the garrison, and those who were enjoying furloughs at headquarters, were whirling merrily about upon the long-bladed and fan- tastic Prussian skates. We fancied that Hercules on his pedestal stared scornfully at the brawny servants who were exercising the horses from the king's stables, and even naked Cleopatra's statue seemed tinted with a blush, as two youthful officers gazed wonderingly at her through their field-glasses. The Dryads, the Fauns, the gods, and the Roman Emperors, held them- selves suddenly aloof from the enthusiastic admiration which the strollers lavished upon them, and King Neptune in his chariot, in the middle of the great frozen fountain, seemed to shake his trident angrily at the invader, and to warn him of the hour of ven- geance. At the fountain's brim lingered Prince Carl, magnificent in red, and with his negro servant stand-  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7012-00000041"/> j       jA-JL.

Not far from him stood the carriage )f the Duke of Saxe Weimar, and the driver had just ime to switch his team out of the way, as King Wil- iam's outrider came round the corner, and presently he royal carriage, with the king's venerable coun- enance peering from under a mass of furs, rolled by. rhe four guards following scowled at the people, who urned to look half admiringly after them, and the car- ,iage was away like a flash of light. Half a mile down the canal we saw a mass of variegated colors which, vhen examined through our glass, turned into a row )f Hussar and Uhlan officers, in their scarlet, green, mnd blue jackets, sliding on the ice, with noisy Gallic irchins pushing them along. The strange figure' which had mounted in Neptune's briny chariot beside the god-monarch of the sea, and was pulling his rev- erend ears, and feeling his sea-green beard, wasr a Brandenburger, who doubtless wished to say at home that he had made himself familiar with all the beauties  of France. A wildly wheeling ring of men in the middle of the canal was a party of princes and gen- erals, renewing the tricks of their youth, and dancing  a little incipient cancan on skates, to the music of loud -  whistling from their hearty throats. In the centre was : an American, acknowledged the best skater on the canal,  skimming away past Serene Highnesses and high and   J well born sirs with true republican impudence. Far-     c vJ                  ;"wy   TIE MYSTERIOUS LADY.1 1 ther away, we saw a duke go plump into collision with i a portly general, who touched his hat as the dignitary fell breathless into his arms. Here glided along a stout cavalryman carrying his sabre balanced on one hand, while with the other he made the flourishes  customary to European skaters. There, on a string  of sledges, propelled by sharp prods stuck into the  I ice, flitted a dozen soldiers but recently released from  hospital, and inhaling new strength and life with  every breath. Now a soldier angrily drew his sabre on a civilian, and was at once collared and taken to  the guard-house. Now the Duke of Saxe Coburg  passed us, murmuring, "Yes, charming, but too cold," and rubbing his hands to keep the blood going. A countess and general went hand in hand along the gleaming pathway, and only escaped imminent de- ;truction by a sinuous whirl away from a tangle of ledges in which a Bavarian soldier had acquired a   i vound equal to some which his brethren had received  )efore Orleans. In and out among the trees flitted iundreds of cavaliers practising their fine-blooded orses; and now and then an orderly galloped hastily hrough a long avenue of the park in search of some ficers whom a new series of circumstances suddenly ailed together to duty.  As we sat down on the low stone bank of the nal, and were surrounded by the frantic crowd 6  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7012-00000042"/> iKENTUCKY'S LO VE. Frenchmen, who earned a precarious subsistence y frnishing the conquerors with skates, we saw ocoon coming rapidly towards us, and flourishing  is mercurial heels with an abandon born only of ractice on the generous rivers of America; Put here was little joy in his face. He stroked the rost from his long silky beard, and sat down be- ide us, saying,- "Don't skate to-day; I want you. Accustomed to obey Cocoon's imperious demands, Eentucky kicked off the skate already half buckled on his foot, and said,-               , ",Well, my ancient, what new trouble?" Cocoon looked us both in the face, and said, under his breath, - "I have found her."  "What,- the face?" said Kentucky. "Yes."        :  "Where is she?" asked Kentucky, looking wildly about.  "She passed through yonder avenue half an hour ago," answered Cocoon, "with a little child  clingifg to her hand. She was dressed in deep mourning, and if I was not mistaken, she spoke to the child in English. I can swear that she is not French, and she will return this way because e she has taken a path which has no outlet. She    - "Xhap   L JLLJ Ji3L 1 J X1 I I U i 1-JL aL. i^ must come back; but (grumblingly) you will spoil it with one of your blunders, Kentucky; go away and leave me to my fate." Kentucky and I were not easily persuaded to retire, however, for our curiosity was now thoroughly aroused. So, under pretext of an animated conver- sation with little Spriggins of the London Blanket, who came, radiant and ferocious, as of old, to growl alike at invaders and invaded, we remained where we could observe any figure passing in or  out of the long avenue referred to by Cocoon. That fate-haunted individual paid for his *skates, and struck boldly, under the shadow of the trees, up the avenue. It might have been half an hour that we waited, and Spriggins had exhausted his invective, and left  us to ourselves, when, suddenly, as our curiosity  became rampant, two figures emerged from  the  avenue and came along the snowy path, keeping well away from the banks of the canal. Kentucky grasped my arm, and, with an impatient gesture, said,- "See how  the young rascal shelters her with his broad figure. I can distinguish nothing: what is she like?" At this moment they stopped, and I saw Co- coon put his hand to his breast, take from his  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7012-00000043"/> 84    .  KENTUCKY'S LOVE. side pocket the picture so mysteriously delivered  , to him by the dying spy, and place it in her hands. There was a swift, agitated movement of the feminine figure, and then it sank helpless into the snow.  Cocoon fell on his knees beside it, and Ken- ,' tucky and I, regardless of others' eyes, set off at full trot to offer assistance. It was, indeed, a pretty group; one doubtless often enough repeated in the sheeny moonlight evenings when Louis XIV. and his bedizened and be-ribboned courtiers and ladies flaunted among the foliage; when the great gondolas on  the canal were illuminated with bright lamps and  torches; when the sound of delicious music from the palace fell softly on the ears that listened also to avowals of love; when poets sat at the   - feet of ladies in the thickets and read the follies of the court in ihyme; and when, in one mad  delirious whirl of fancy and passion, in one long dream of unbridled luxury, a monarch fooled his time away until the people whom he had starved howled at his gates and would not be refused admission.  A  pretty group indeed! A fair young man  fallen upon his knees, and with his hair straying over his white forehead, and his cheeks slightly   THE MYSTERIOUS LADY.       85 reddened with a startled glow, while his strong arms encircled the unconscious form of the woman whose face had haunted him for days, and sent him mooning about the long avenues by night, at imminent risk of being arrested as a suspicious person. The mysterious lady did not open her eyes; she lay cold and apparently lifeless as the statue a little way off which gleamed in the sun- shine, and the young artist bent over her ador- ingly, as if impelled to touch with his lips the lips so longed for, yet which must to him be a sealed treasure. So spell-bound seemed Cocoon, so entranced and beautiful was the lady, that Ken- tucky and I paused instantly in the attitude of admiration, and hardly breathed until Cocoon came suddenly to his senses, and, taking up a handful of the snow, pressed it gently and almost caress- ingly upon the temples of the prostrate woman. A slight shiver, and, opening her eyes, a sudden rosy glow,' which seemed to transfigure the beauti- ful features,-a quiet call for the little boy who stood frightened and almost ready to cry at her side, and Cocoon rose, supporting her, and, instantly turning, saw us standing awkwardly enough before the group. Kentucky was the first to stammer an apology, and to explain that he feared the lady had slipped :, .  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7012-00000044"/> 86      KENVTUCIKY'S LOVE. upon the ice.  We, being friends of Mr. Co- coon (strong emphasis on the Mr.), hastened to  assist, and he really hoped the lady was not hurt, and should he run for a carriage? It was difficult to imagine who was the most confused, Cocoon or the mysterious lady.  Both seemed to feel somewhat ungrateful for our beneficent intrusion; and I, begging a hasty pardon, ran towards the canal, and hailed the driver of a small brougham, which was the property of the consular repre- sentative of the Turkeys. The consul - a little olive- brown man--bustled forward, and understanding at once what was the matter, proffered, with a profusion of Oriental politeness, his carriage and his services. Kentucky, who had in the mean time come up, regu-  larly accepted the former, gently refused the other,  and the lady was whirled out of the park in the  brougham, after having, in a low and singularly  musical voice, thanked us most heartily, assured us  that she had walked too far, and that the bright  ? glow of the sun on the snow had made her dizzy.  "I have been very ill," said she, "and little Robert's  enthusiasm has forced me to walk too far. Good  morning. And how beautifully the Prussian officers  skate."  Cocoon stood looking wonderingly after the shining : brougham until it had disappeared round the corner.   THE MYSTERIOUS LADY.        87 "Come," he said, hastily; "let us go; there are more than fifty of those Prussian noodles staring at us as if we were dromedaries;" and we went. As we tramped along past the statues towards our rooms, Kentucky pressed his hand upon Cocoon's shoulder, and in a half-jocund, half-musing way, re- peated these lines:-  "Thus did she go; and he, so left behind, Mourned for her, and desired her very sore; Yet, with a pang, he felt that he was blind; Despite of words that yet there was a store Of some undreamed-of and victorious lore He might not touch: frowning, he turned away, And seemed a troubled, gloomy man that day. Kentucky," said Cocoon, "you are an infernal brute. What business had you to thrust your gaunt form into our presence at that most delicious of all moments?  And, as for you, sir," said he, turning to me, "you are utterly inexcusable. However, I do not know that I need regret having lost what I cer- tainly coveted, -a simple explanation with the mys- terious lady,--although I have your awkwardness to thank for it." This ungracious remark was responded to with a cynical laugh from Kentucky, and absolute silence on my part. I plodded behind, and, when I arrived at my own room, threw   myself into the arm-chair, and through a cloud of smoke, which drifted lazily  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7012-00000045"/> 88      KENT UCK Y'S L O VE.         : upward from my pipe, fashioned to myself some lit-  tle memory of what seemed to me truly a wonderfill face. Yes; it was an American face. There was none of the heartiness and buxom flush of the English wo- man's features; none of the pensive dreaminess or rich olive glow of the French woman; none of the sharp, patrician outlines of the Italian woman; and, indeed, I could not precise it to myself, but I felt that it was  intrinsically an American woman's face. Imprimis: there was a sweet low brow, with brown hair straying carelessly and defiantly over it, and eyes which always seemed looking out to sea, save when a sudden introspective look passed over them. Then round cheeks, clear, delicately pale, with never a wrinkle or a mark of care upon them; a fair mouth with tempting lips; - I puffed twice hastily, and looked through the cloud again,-they were tempt- , ing lips, and, when slightly parted in the smile with jI which she bade us adieu, one could see whitest of : teeth. Then there was a round chin and a firm white throat; there was a ribbon, and it was -blue, and--here the picture seemed to fade, and I said to myself, - "Well, but these are every-day features; nine women out of ten in Tremont Street or Broadway    shall boast them, and yet some inexplicable charm  i,. ?t   THE MYSTERIOUS LADY.        89 seems to flavor the face and eyes. I don't blame Co- coon." Was it the wealth of brown hair, which, when she was lifted so tenderly in the youngster's arms, strayed and fell in torrents about her? Was it the slight, yet perfect figure, so instinct and alert with grace-? or was it the eyes? or what was it? On the whole, a lovely woman - .well, perhaps of five and twenty. Thus musing, fancying, and smoking, I passed the afternoon, lazily enough for a man accustomed to camp and saddle; and finally, worried with my own fan- cies, I took refuge in a volume of Montaigne, over which I fell asleep, and was only awakened by the ringing voice of Kentucky, who stood looking over the back of my chair, and sang,-- "There were three sailors of Bristol city-- Who took a boat and went to sea-ea-ee." "The drama deepens," said Kentucky; and a sin- gular smile lit up his gaunt face. "How is that?" said I, lazily. "Well, Cocoon is apparently perdu, as the French say. That Yankee coquette " -and there was a slight taint of southern bitterness upon the Yankee-"has him in her mesh, and I think he will make but few sketches for many days to come."  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7012-00000046"/> 90       K IENTUCKY'S LOVYE.  "But he doesn't know her address, and ladies do not invite people they meet by chance into their par-  lors. Besides," I added, jealously, "how do we know  who she is?"  "Bah!" said Kentucky. "There was a sniff of real  Boston aristocracy. HTow do we care who or what  she may be, when she is so passing beautiful?" I rose and looked him full in the face. "Well," said I, drawing a long breath, "are you, too, in the meshes?" "Not so," said he; "God forbid. I have other fish to fry." And he sat down at the old clavicorde upon which Madame Varlin's departed husband once taught music to French juveniles, and began to play a little melody, full of pathos, and passion, and song, fit for a serenade by moonlight, or on the borders of some lake, when all nature was hushed andc it was far gone into the night.  The song finished with a closing refrain, in which  I could fancy that I heard the blare of trumpets and 1 the galloping of horses, - the rush of battle, even; r and as he left the instrument he said,-      : 4' I heard that at Newport, in 1866, I think it was, and yet I could almost fancy it a century ago. Let us go and walk." In the square we met Mr. Cocoon, with his sketch- i book, bidding adieu to a tall Prussian, who was en- ,:,i   !2I    THYE MYSTERIOUS LADY.      91 lightening him in spasmodic English as to some excep- tionally fine views to be had from Satory. i  "Just think of it," said Cocoon; "that Prussian brute even asked me to come and sketch from life the execution of a spy who is to be shot to-morrow morn- ing, on the outer edge of the park, just at sunrise. Those fellows have no heart." "Shall you go "I asked. "No." "But the London Illustrated may make a sketch of the execution," said Kentucky. "Yes," answered Cocoon, scornfully, "their artist--. deals in anguish." So we went walking in the Avenue de Paris. Next morning we were out for a gallop, all three riding abreast, elated by the sound of jingling spur and rattling hoof. The snow had vanished from the long avenue, which was thronged by dozens of cav- aliers, brilliant in the uniforms of the king's staff, hastily bowing, and ungraciously smirking, as only Prussians can. Half way up the avenue, and not far from the'prefecture, where the venerable king had his headquarters, stood a large white-fronted mansion, which we had many times noticed as silent, and seem- ingly deserted; but as we passed it, galloping hastily, and each cast the usual glance at it, we saw that the huge front door was open, and in it stood the mys-  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7012-00000047"/> 92      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. terious lady! We tightened rein, and all three, as by instinct, walked our horses, and bowed courteously.  The lady responded, and, to our utter amazement, ran down the alley, and paused as if expecting us to ;: approach.  Cocoon's face was a puzzle. He stroked his long  mustache, looked equivocally at us, then dismounted, and, leaving us, led his horse to the gate. The lady beckoned us to follow ; but Kentucky, as if moved by some uncontrollable impulse, suddenly put spurs to his horse, and galloped away towards the gates  of the town, as if riding for dear life. I followed Cocoon's example, and the lady graciously welcomed us, saying,- "Do you know, gentlemen, I think when Americans meet under such exceptional circumstances, the or- dinary barriers of society should be broken down; and I wish to say to you, sir (to Cocoon), in behalf of my father, that our house is open to you every afternoon. We have lived here for some time, and father is an invalid; consequently we could not fly when the odious invader set his seal upon our door. It is unpleasant to be mewed up in a camp, and you may possibly be able to bring us a little sunshine. I trust you will not think me indiscreet;" and she bent her eyes upon the ground, and twisted the stem of the rose which she held in her hand.   THE MYSTERIOUS LADY.       93 Cocoon could not have said a word, had the muzzle of a sentinel's gun been pointed at his breast; so the burden fell upon me. I accepted her remarks in the spirit they were offered, and said blunderingly, doubt- less, that "we should all be glad of so charming an opportunity for a bit of home-life; arid might we send our cards next day?" "Certainly; but why had our comrade ridden so hastily away?" Indeed, we knew not; and Cocoon here regained his self-possession, and said, - ' Madame, I owe you an explanation!" She turned hastily to him, as if offended that he should make that remark, leading so naturally to the subject of the portrait, of which she doubtless sup- posed me ignorant. Cocoon understood. ,  "No," he said, deprecatingly, "pardon me. My friend was with me when the portrait which I gave you the other day came into my possession. 'Tis a brief history, but, I fear, a painful one; and- " Her whole manner changed. A great light came into her eyes, her lips trembled, and she turned, for a moment, from us. Then she said,- ; "Gentlemen, there is no need of words. It is I who owe you an explanation. I fear you must mis- understand me.' She said these last words falteringly; and we has-  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7012-00000048"/> "      KENTUCKY 'S L OVE. tened to say, as if almost in concert, M"Madame, your  secret shall not-be ours, if you desire it."  She broke the rosebud from its stem, threw it down ? at her feet, twisted her hands absently a moment, and then said, "I shall be pleased to receive your call - to-morrow."             '       ; We bowed our thanks, mounted our horses, and   , set off in search of Kentucky.          I: All these days the great cannon-thunders never t; ceased. The night breezes brought us the noises  i from the forts, and the plaintive crescendo of platoon firing was often heard. On this bright morning, the gunners in the French forts were more than usually active, and a very Inferno of sounds broke on our ears as we rode rapidly towards the steep hill which mounted to Meudon. At the base of the hill we found Kentucky angrily snarling at a sentinel, who asserted his absolute order to allow no one to pass. Perforce we rode back together, and demanded an  explanation of Kentucky's singular conduct; uncour- - teous, Cocoon called it.     r        t: (c Well," said Kentucky, "I never could manage this beast.

A VISIT TO MfARGARET. rADAME VARLIN      looked at us with undis- guised wonder when we came down, at eleven o'clock, to breakfast the next day. "You are dressed with more thlan usual care, gentlemen," she said; "are the Prussians rejoicing over some new victory?" This'brought to our attention that each of the trio had been more careful than usual in his toilet, and that we were to visit the mysterious lady, as she was now universally called, at three o'clock. Kentucky had reluctantly consented to go, after protestations that he abominated calls, especially in war time. Cocoon was exuberant, made more than his usual number of blun- *ders, and finished by upsetting the coffee-pot, and se- verely scalding Madame Varlin's favorite cat, who reposed at his feet. The conversation turned upon the incidents of our eventful journey to the outposts, and Kentucky sud- denly observed, -  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7012-00000049"/> 96      KENTUCKY"'S LO VE. "Does the mysterious lady know how you obtained the picture?" "No; but I fancy she can imagine." Cocoon's rev-  erent manner seemed to have ceased. He spoke of  the lady coolly and flippantly, and seemed as much bored as Kentucky with the prospective call; but he was promptly on hand in the hall a little before three,  and we walked together to the mansion.       . A neat French man-servant, clad in the traditional - dress coat and white choker, ushered us into a long i hall, the floor of which was covered with curious mat- - ting, wrought with Japanese characters. On the walls : hung a portrait of some decayed French statesmen, a crayon view of the Coliseum at Rome, and a model head of a child, with its hair blown breezily about a : round forehead, and with laughing eyes upturned. Cocoon, with his artist eye, divined the picture at once. "Hem!" said he; "that must be the M. L.  when she was young." Ushered into the drawing-room, there seemed no one present, and Cocoon was about to make a remark :I concerning the M. L.'s juvenile likeness, when a voice  cried from the depth of a huge arm-chair, whose back  was turned to us, "Margaret, are you there? Please a bring me some oranges; and let me have the paper, if a they printed one last night."           !l We were about to make our^presence known, when ' -Xi! i   A VISIT TO MARGARET.        97 I  the man-servant rushed in, wheeled the invalid father of the mysterious lady plump round, stood erect be- b hind the chair, and in the hoarse, monotonous accents  of his tribe said,- "Monsieur is not perhaps aware that these are the S gentlemen who were to call." The invalid surveyed us querulously through his eye-glass, then rose, and limped towards us, saying, in ' English,-- "Gentlemen, be  seated. I am broken down, and cannot receive you.  My physician forbids me to talk, save when it is imperatively necessary. Please excuse me" (pleadingly). "Frangois, wheel me round again;" and he seemed to lose all knowledge of our presence ere the active servant had wheeled him back to his original position. "A frigid invalid, indeed," whispered Kentucky. And as he uttered this cynical remark, in fluttered the mysterious lady, and graciously welcomed us. We   rose, and we heard the invalid stirring in his chair, and querulously complaining of the interruption which his daily life had suffered by our intrusion. A rich glow suffused her face, as she stood in the open doorway, looking half afraid, half defiant. But the glow was away in an instant, and hard lines of care and anxiety seemed suddenly to appear upon her 7 -  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7012-00000050"/> 98      KENTUCKY 'S LO VE. features, as she stepped through the drawing-room,  and motioned, rather than asked, us to follow. At the rear, the drawing-room, opening upon a spa- cious lawn, was attractive enough even in the hard winter weather, ancl a little recess, hidden by ample curtains, contained a huge window, from which one  could overlook the entire lawn. We entered this re- cess, and sat down together.  My first impulse was to fly, and to take Kentucky with me. It seemed to me that the drama was now  : culminating, that we could add but little to its inten- sity, and that our weak presence was only annoying. The lady seemed to divine our thoughts. She drew the curtains together, and taking the locket from her bosom, opened it, toyed with it, and finally laid it on a table near by.^ "You see, gentlemen," she began, she meant to address us all, but looked directly at Kentucky,- ' there are things which must be explained. I cannot i suffer you, who have involuntarily done me so great a : service, to misunderstand my relations with the unfor- - tunate man whom you have so lately seen shot; and I cannot bear to shut myself into the silence which might be best for me, and to resolutely refuse to know how he died. You have briefly outlined the story for me; now please give me the details."  Although this was said in almost a flippant tone, we   A VISIT TO MA RGARET.      99 could still see that great forces were, at work, keeping down and repressing with giant hands an emotion that would have known no bounds, had we not been present. Cocoon aimed at simplicity in his narrative, and hit it. He told, with unflinching firmness, every detail of the death of the spy; described him with pre-Rapha- elite minuteness, and with a certain enthusiasm, not without its effect upon the mysterious lady. She lis- tened with bowed head, as on that day when we met her at the gate, and nothing seemed absolutely to star- tle her, until Cocoon, in a rapid and picturesque series of word sketches, showed her the battle which swept across our refuge in the woods at Enghien, and told her of the sudden disappearance of the body of the spy. "The body was taken away!" she cried, jumping up, clapping her hands and laughing with real girlish care- lessness; "taken away; but it was indeed dead- was it not?" she said. "The dead do not walk. They know nothing of battle. Are you sure that the body had disappeared?" Cocoon certainly was able to convince her of that. The almost childish joy she had so suddenlymaniifested vanished as quickly as it had come. She sat silent for a few moments; then, looking up at us, said,- "Gentlemen, I did intend to tell you a regular story. I know my confidence would not have been betrayed;  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7012-00000051"/> 100      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. I know you would have respected whatever secret might have come into your possession; but I did not know, when I offered you this confidence, that the body of the spy had been rescued." She said these last words hesitatingly, yet almost with an air of triumph. "Madame " - began Cocoon. ( No," she said, as if continuing her own thoughts, "no, I cannot. Other lives and interests than mine are at stake, and, since the work still goes on, I must re- main devoted to it. I could have given you ten min- utes of romance; but now duty forbids. Gentlemen, will you follow the English fashion of taking some lunch? I myself will wait upon you." We rose, more mystified than ever, and there was an angry froin upon Kentucky's brow, such as he wore when storms were near. It seemed to say, "Beware! I will have no intrigues, no peculiar missions; I will throw the light of day upon this mysterious lady,' or I will separate her forever from Cocoon." It seemed to me that the frown said all this. Then it was gone like a flash, and Kentucky became radiant in conversa- tion over the lunch. A spasmodic kind of gayety seemed to hover in the atmosphere. As the lunch progressed, we talked mer- rily, even noisily, of the thousand and one events of the siege, and the lady was as gay and joyous as were   Ij:      A VISIT TO MARGARET.       101 we. We discussed generals and bombardings, shoot- ings and burnings, in a spirit more worthy of a comic paper than serious folk; and even the invalid cried out that he should like to be turned round, that he might listen from afar off to the staccato and the laughter of our circle. While we were lingering over lunch, which, with a cheery disregard for ceremony, had been served in the drawing-room, the shadow of a figure fell across the table, and we all looked up. A tall and :  awkward peasant stood in the doorway, sheepishy shifting his cap from one hand to the other, and keenly investigating us, as if surprised to see strangers not in uniform. The lady rose, turning pale, and seemed to struggle with herself a moment or two before she greeted the peasant. At last she said, "Good afternoon, Jean; you have come a long way, and you must be tired. If you will step into the kitchen you will find a bottle of cool wine, some cold meat, and some fruit. Have you brought any news from our sick friends?" "Yes, madam," said he, casting a quick, suspicious glance at us. "These gentlemen," said she, "are Americans, and my special friends.  Come in there; pass directly through the drawing-room, and I will join you presently, when you are refreshed." As she closed the door behind him, I saw a piece  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7012-00000052"/> 102     KENTUCIKY'S LOVE. of brown paper flutter'to the floor. She hastily picked. it up, read it, and, returning to our table, sat down  trembling. She seemed amazed, and to have almost lost her senses. She spread down the paper upon  the table before her, and I could not help seeing these words, written in French, and in the round, labored hand of one more accustomed to hold the plough-handle than the pen. "It is discovered. Some- thing has happened at the front, and there is no communication to-day. You are suspected, and the Prussians propose to search your house." She finally took up the paper, and, oblivious of our presence, wandered back to the recess overlooking the lawn. Hither Cocoon followed her. I felt it my duty to tell Kentucky what I had seen, and his face lighted up as I repeated the words of the paper. "You see," he said, "'our acute German friends have really found the other end of the underground railroad, but it will not do for us to be discovered here. We are already suspected of too much, be- cause of our knowledge of the spy's death, and un- less we wish to be taken as accessories, we must re- tire at once." "But, said I, with a Quixotic idea concerning de- fenceless women flitting through my mind, "can we not save her by timely warning?" "No," he growled; "the peasant has brought her * ,t   ?y?     A VISIT TO MARGARET.       103 all the warning she can get. Probably he has also brought her plenty of letters and messages from Paris. Let us be off." Cocoon reappeared at this moment, and announced his readiness to return to the hotel. As we were preparing to leave, a commotion was heard in the outer yard. The heavy tread upon the stone steps announced the arrival of soldiery, and the door-bell was rung smartly.  I know  not what influence prompted Kentucky to go to the door, throw it open, and to say, "Come in," in response to the courteous ) demand of the officer who headed the soldiers. In a moment the house was filled with a prying, noisy set of Germans, who apparently believed that enemies were concealed in some of the apartments, and took ; the most ridiculous precautions for their own safety. The servants came rushing in, in confusion, earnestly demanding of us what had happened, and protesting that they could understand none of the jargon of the conquerors. The invalid father was wheeled away, proclaiming loudly his forthcoming dissolution, hastened by at least ten years by so sudden a shock to his at- I tenuated nerves. The soldiers had surrounded the writing-desk which lay open near one of the windows looking upon the lawn, and one or two of them were about to pry open some drawers, when the lady sud- denly appeared, and, without any hastiness of manner,  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7012-00000053"/> 104      KENT UCKY'S LO VE. bowed to the officer, and inquired to what new fancy of the siege authorities she was indebted for this somewhat unexpected visit. The officer bowed, and i responded graciously enough that he had been ordered to search the house; that he regretted it exceedingly, inasmuch as he believed the lady was an American; that he doubted not that it was a mere matter of form; and that he trusted the fair mistress of the mansion would afford him every facility for perform- ing so unpleasant a task as quickly as possible. "To search the house," she repeated, "for arms? we have none; for documents? -we have none; for people?- there are none concealed here. Here are the keys, gentlemen. Do your duty."  The officer winced under the slightly scornful emphasis upon the last word, and regarded her with an extremely un- amiable expression. "Madam," he said, changing his tone, "the causes for suspicion, let me assure you, are sufficiently grave to warrant a search, and I now feel bound to proceed without further ceremony." As he said these words he advanced towards the window, looking upon the lawn, and saw the figure of the French peasant, who had just arrived, passing. He called two of his men, and bade them  at once follow and arrest him. The search began.   1       ZETHE NEWPORT WALTZ.       105 , '.,7 1 CHAPTER VII. /:?j THE NEWPORT WALTZ. !: n HERE are many surprises, but none more startling H :?  than that received by the soldier whom Ken- tucky knocked down when he approached him, and : questioned him, in a somewhat arbitrary manner, con- cerning his presence in the house. The blow    was so overwhelming, so radically effective, and withal j delivered with such a grace and contemptuous ease, that the-first impulse of the soldier's comrades was to H;1k laugh. Kentucky hastened to explain, in German, :?j that he permitted no impudence at any time; and the officer, who was at firstinclined to bluster, finally accepted   the situation, and contented himself with ordering us all three into another room, the key of which was presently turned upon us. The search lasted two or three hours. The house J:j/ was visited from garret to cellar; even fresh earth was turned up in the cellar bottom, in the hopes of  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7012-00000054"/> 106      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. discovering some mysterious cavity where arms or compromising documents might be concealed. The grave domestic, trembling in his solemn suit of black, was led into the court-yard, a guard stationed over him, and he was informed that if anything Wrong was found in the house, he would be shot forthwith. He received this intelligence with composure, and hastened to inform the conquerors, in a singularpatois of French and German, acquired by six months' con- tact with the Prussians, that they would yet suffer at his hands in the same way. "We shall go to your homes," he said; " we shall have the pleasure of slap- ping your faces, and searching your houses, and steal- i ing your clocks." The peasant who had been arrested was brought into the drawing-room for examination; and the officer, after a series of questions which would have done credit to the most crabbed cross-examiner, finally decided to hold him'" a few days," as he cheerily announced. "The peasant has nothing compromising with him," said Kentucky, who reported progress through the keyhole; "this may be a mare's nest, after all. Cer- tainly, if this is the head of the communication line, something must be found here." When the search was over, the soldiers noisily de-  parted, without even offering to release us; and so  we were compelled to seek assistance through the    X :     THE NEWPORT WA LTZ.      107 keyhole. The lady herself opened the door, and laughed merrily when Kentucky recounted the episode of the surprised soldier, and his own punishment. t  "They are gone," said she, "no wiser than when they came. The poor French peasant will remain in jail, and they will learn nothing more from him than from the one whom they have shot." She said these words with a certain bitterness, which caused a quick laugh from Kentucky, as he turned to me, and said, "Our fair countrywoman seems sympathetic for the French." She turned like a startled fawn, and, coming forward to Kentucky, held out both hands. Ajdi  "I know you now," she said, in a half-fiightened voice; "something in your tone recalls to me him whom I knew tlhat pleasant summer in Newport. But how you have changed! I should never have known you, were it not for the sudden re-appearance of that old quality of satire in your voice. And have you   forgotten all the follies and vanities of the American seaside?" "No," said Kentucky, cynically. !    "Not even this?" she said, seating herself at the piano, and beginning to play the melody which Ken. tucky had thumped out of the clavicorde in my room a few days before. But she gave to the melody a new interpretation. Kentucky had played it defiantly, sternly; through the music ran a thread of a forbid-  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7012-00000055"/> g108  -   KENTUCKY'S LOVE. ding fate, from which there was no appeal; and the  glorious outhurst of martial bounds in the closing re- frain seemed the only relief to the sorrow and cynical  despair pervading the rest; but the piano, under the  lady's white and facile fingers, gave to the melody a far different meaning. It was full of passionate long-  ing, arid ill-repressed desire. There was not so much i of defiance as of appeal in it, and there seemed a sor- , row'in the tone of the bugles, which I fancied I could hear to the end. Clearly, these two minds were af- fected very differently by the memory of the melody. As she closed the piano, and turned away from it,  she looked quietly up into Kentucky's face. "No," he said, glancing down upon her, almost scornfully; "no, I have not even forgotten that; but you have taken liberties with the music." "Why?" said she; " and how?" "Why, I know not; how, it is easy to explain. Did the music say that to you four years ago?" "Perhaps not" said she. "A few years give ample time for reflection." Cocoon, in the mean time, sat upon the sofa, wearily turning over the leaves of Dore's Don Quixote, and occasionally casting a sharp glance at Kentucky and the lady. As they sauntered away from the piano, he joined them, and said,- "A very pretty melody; I think I have heard it be-   I         TIlE NEWPORT WALTZ.      109 fore. Kentucky must have acquired a fondness for it somewhere, for he has played it many a time and oft, in his room, when we were anxious to go to sleep up stairs. He seems to use it as a vent to his feelings, and he hammers it at times, I can tell you." There was no response. The lady seemed to have forgotten Cocoon. She sat down with Kentucky in the window-seat, and began to break sprigs off from. a tall plant which stood rejoicing in the winter sunshine, and threw them upon the carpet. Instinctively I ? took Cocoon into the room where we had so lately :  been imprisoned, and attempted to divert his attention by making sport of the poor invalid, and his discom- fiture when the house was invaded; but Cocoon silm- ply turned his back upon me, and said, as if to him- self, "So she has met Kentucky before, and he never told me. I begin to believe that there is a fate in this affair." I overheard the last words. They were said with an air of such profound conviction that they. frightened me. I put my hand upon his shoulder, and I said, "Cocoon, don't be a fool; there is no such thing as fate. You are not obliged to succumb to anything. Don't let a ridiculous, untrue, romantic passion over- whelm you. That woman has no heart. I know it. You may rest assured that her love is valueless to you."  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7012-00000056"/> "O    .KE INTUCK 1Y'S LO VE. Cocon stroked his long beard, and seemed to weigh my words. "Excuse me," said he; "I differ with you. Any woman who can interpret music as can this one must have wonderful powers of loving. I really differ with you." It was getting dark. The shadows of the great trees in the avenue had lengthened, blended, and formed a dark carpet, which seemed to cover, as a pall, the snow-fields. Orderlies came galloping in, bring- ing the last messages of the day from the outposts. A weary regiment, stained with battle, its officers half asleep, stole slowly by; and the sullen native popula- tion began to get to its homes to lock itself in, long ere the patrols should begin to monopolize the streets. Kentucky and the lady were earnestly talking. She was at her best now, and her face was lighted up with a joy and earnestness such as I had not before seen upon it. She did not seem to desire to be alone with him, and a few words here and there drifted to our ears. Cocoon caught them eagerly, and finally ap-  proached the couple, saying, "And now that you have described the melody, and  its effects upon the march of civilization, would you i kindly permit us to ask for a bit more of music? Af- ter which we must go, as the Bohemian Club would ostracize us if we were not at dinner promptly." She pleaded some slight excuse, and did not return to the    'i-t(    ETHE NEWPORT WALTZ. Z piano. Presently, all rose; and as we stood at the door of the hall, the lady said, quietly, "Have you pardoned me for refusing to tell the story which I - really owe you? Can you forgive me if I hold myself ':, ^ sternly to a vow whose influence over me has not been for the best? I would have told you how that locket came into his possession, but now I feel that I cannot, and you will not esteem me too lightly?" "No," we said; and with the usual courtesies went :i:n our ways, profoundly intrigued by the eccentricities of the mysterious lady. A ;As we reached the Rue des Reservoirs, we were suddenly confronted by Spriggins, of the London Blanket, who informed us that the Bohemian Club did not dine that evening, but was engaged in a curious conversation, over pipes and brandy and water, con- cerning the recent battles. Anxious for diversion, we entered the hotel where abode these brave knights of :' ,the quill and crayon, and gently tapped at the door of the large room which they used for their evening gath- erings. A thunderous voice answered, "Come in," and a tall form, clad in the uniform of a brigadier general of the United States, was the first object which met our eyes. This form was that of the wor- thy lessee of the apartment, who had been to pay his respects to the Crown Prince, and was now about i  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7012-00000057"/> 112    KENTUCK Y 'S LOV E. to doff the uniform which secured for him so many  favors as military correspondent of a noted paper. Comfortably ensconced in arm-chairs, in front of a blazing wood fire, sat three or four middle-aged gen- tlmen, vigorously condemning the German policy as manifest at Versailles; and one, younger, who had just  come in, and whose gaiters were splashed with mud, showing that he had ridden a long distance, was re- citing a little narrative, which seemed from time to time to usurp the attention of all present. The young man finally took a map from his pocket, and spreading it on the nearest table, said, "Look here; it's very simple. The news comes, mysteriously enough, it is true, but safely always, through a point in the lines somewhere near Enghien. Some time ago they shot a man whom they called a spy there, and fancied that they had caught the fox; but next night the mysterious 10          lid meantime, the dead sp  : messages go on as before, and meantime the dead spy himself is carried off, or flies off through the air, as some of the German soldiers will have it. Well, hav- ing got the despatches into the Prussian lines, perhaps you wonder how they are conveyed hither and so on down to Orleans, without detection. They pass from hand to hand in the most miraculous manner. I was  told to-day that three houses in Versailles were to be searched for compromising papers, and I will wager that nothing has been found. It is evident that a 8   THE NEWPORT WALTZ.       113 grand scheme has been organized, and the Prussians swear that a woman is at the bottom of it." Cocoon was filling his pipe, which he suddenly dropped, as the last words caught his ear. "Take some brandy and water," said Kentucky. "It is temporarily good for nervous complaints." "Do you hear what they are saying?" said Cocoon, more quietly. "I should judge," answered Kentucky, "that they are speaking of something not remotely connected with our adventure in the forest of Enghien." The young, man continued his speculation. "Not only do they say it is a woman, but a Prussian captain told me to-day that they believed it to be an Ameri- can woman. By Jove, that is good. I wonder if the Americans really would go so far in their sympathy for the French!"And the young Englishman laughed. "Nonsense!" said the elder and graver of those seated before the fire; "there is no probability that any foreigner is mixed up in this daring attempt to carry intelligence through the lines. It is all done by French cunning, as you will yet find out. By the way, have you heard of the conspiracy about us?" "Conspiracy!" said the correspondents, coming for- ward; "what is it?" "Well, it is laughable enough; but I am assured i that there is a great deal of truth in it.

"And you remember the group of Frenchmen who were always seated about the stove, rolling cigarettes and cursing the Prussians?" "Yes." "Well, these fellows had taken, it seems, so thor- ough a spite against us, that they had organized a regular conspiracy to trap us, in case of a successful attack by the French, and to hold us until the French army came in. One of them even suggested popular vengeance upon us by the elimination of an ear from each person's body; and they really have been fool- ish enough to wish to wreak their malice upon us." A general buzz of laughter arose in the room, checked somewhat suddenly by a new and furious outhurst on the part of the forts, which had been unusually tranquil all day.  The party resolved itself into little groups of whist, poker, and piquet players, and the rattle of critical conversation was soon marked as usual.  One or two festive spirits in a corner essayed a little song, and imitated the martial stiffness and  swagger of the Prussian officers.  Newspapers from home were opened, letters read, s             'kV-i    :J      TII TlE NEWPORT WTALTZ.    15 orders given to servants to saddle the horses early / O s -nts ^dde the h'e, early in the morning, and stories which had served in twenty previous campaigns, on the Potomac, in the Wilderness, on the March to the Sea, in Italy, in the tr5f Crimea, and down in Austria's blood-stained fields, were told over and over with infinite relish. !?:-? tAs Kentucky was electrifying the nearest audi- tors with a terrible episode of guerrilla warfare, there was a loud knock at the door; and without waiting response, a servant entered with a hurried inquiry for the gentleman who lived at Madame Varlin's. X   We rose, of course. Kentucky was at once se- lected. "The message is for you, sir;" said the se- vant; there is trouble at the house where you called this afternoon, and they have sent to desire your presence immediately." Kentuelky strode forward, saying from under his breath, "If we only had had dinner!" Turning to us, he added, "Go you and dine. I will see you at mid- night in  y room." Cocoon' features were a puzzle. He seemed half inclined to be angry, and a curious tinge of jealousy i  and ill-suppressed passion struggled into the eyes pnwith which he seemed to appeal to Kentucky to ex- plain. But Kentucky explained nothing. He hurried out unnoticed amid the general bustle.  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7012-00000059"/> "6   IKENTUCKY'S LOVE. 1S1 CHAPTER VIII. KENTUCKY'S WARNING. TOT even the flavor of a bottle of excellent IN   Burgundy could restore Cocoon's equanimity. Twenty times during the dinner he rose, went to the window, looked out into the darkness, sadown again, and leaning his head upon his hands, eemed to muse. Twenty times he tied the napkin round the neck of the bottle, and seemed to take pleasure in strangling some imaginary enemy; and to each question which I ventured on the subject of the mys- terious lady, he did not even vouchsafe a monosyllabic response. Although we had the American brigadier general and a good English doctor, full of stories of adven- ture, as companions-for the dinner, a wet blanket seemed drawn over the gayety. As we rose late, and were about- to drain the last glass of wine, Cocoon said, "Let us go into the air. I am stifling here. Are you good for an hour's walk?"   KENTUCKY'S WARNING.       117     'CZ"Yes." "Then let us steal down one of the avenues, and walk back and forth under the trees. I seem pos- t sessed by the demon of unrest." "Truth to tell, Cocoon," I said, "you are worried concerning the mysterious lady. You should remem- ber that Kentucky has long known her, and he will be sure to do only his duty." '4.Y Cocoon made no answer, and we were soon walk- ing back and forth in one of the avenues, which was totally deserted. After half an hour of prom- enading, we leaned against a tree in the shadow, and were quietly talking together, when we heard a murmur of voices approaching, and drew back instinctively. As we stood, the shadow enveloped and protected us so that no one passing in the walk would have imagined a human being near. Some- thing impelled me to warn Cocoon not to light the cigar which he had taken from his pocket, and I pointed to the figures, saying, "There!" Ii  There was no mistaking Kentucky's voice; and ig on this occasion, all the quality of command, of mag- netic enforcement of the will, so deftly expressed in ji) the ringing tones, were manifest. Beside him, de- 1i tmurely enough, and with head gently bowed forward, walked the mysterious lady, enveloped in black, her lively face even rendered more piquant than when  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7012-00000060"/> "8     iKENTUCKY'S LOV E. we had last seen it, by the struggling moonbeams which played upon the walk, but mischievously re- fused to disclose us. They walked together, yet apart. Kentucky's thoughts seemed far away, and the lady was distraught and anxious. As they passed directly opposite our hiding-place, Kentucky turned suddenly to her, saying,- "Margaret, I will no longer permit this folly: you run the most deadly risks, and you gain nothing, even for the country which you profess to love so well. Besides, there is a cruel tendency to sacrifice every- thing which comes in your way to this one object, - a tendency which frightens me. It is repulsive; I don't like it. I would forbid you further to pursue this phantom of revenge, if I thought my words still had weight with you." At this moment she raised her face, looked upon him gently, and said, half reproachfully, - "O, Kentucky!" This brace of words constituted a generous re- proof. Kentucky seemed to wince under it, for he was silent.  She came nearer to him, and laid her hand im-  pressively upon his arm. Her heavy shawl had fallen from her shoulders; her bonnet was awry; great tears stood in her eyes. There was a strange mixture of command and appeal in her tone, as Kentucky turned   4IENTUCiY,'S WARNING.      119 half impatiently and looked down upon her while she spoke thus:-. You do not do well, George, or, as I learned to call you in the days when you were dearer to me than you can ever be again, Kntcy,  you do not do well to reproach me. Has it come to this, then, a   that I, who could once move you with my breath in and sway you with my tears, am to suddenly take on obedience, even servility, before you, because, for- sooth, my love runs other ways, and my heart beats to a different measure?

Bah! it is not my fault if you force me to humiliat myself before  you, and to openly warn you that  will not be urged into submission. Look you, dead love,-for you are its embodiment, and nothing else to me,-I have gone my own wild ways since you put me have gone         e  d   r   and aside, but I have never wavered or done wrong; and I shall never give you cause to regret that youhave known me, if you do not drive mne to despair with your cold and haughty assumption of generalship. What I have done, what I am doing now, is for duty's sake, and I will follow it to the utmost." She paused; and Kentucky respectfully, even ten- derly, laid his great hand upon her brow, and said, - "Margaret, you are feverish in soul and body. I recommend you to temper your spirit and your frame; but let me explain. I have not thrust my- self upon your attention. I have not come here to not come here to tell you that I believe you capable of utterly ruining my poor friend, whose weak pas- sion for your face surprises me. No; do not stare; there is no room for indignation here. You and I know each other. There is not a leaf in the whole book of honest love that we have not turned to- gether; and because you have closed the book and laid it away, where the dust of time and remorse   KENTUCKY'S WARNING.      121 may gather upon it, you need not fear that I shall break my neck in searching for it. Let me tell you plainly what I mean to do. First, I will save Cocoon i! from the trap into which he is falling. Second, I will save you from, any dangers which may encompass you, if it be within my power, solely because you have charged me so to do by the memory of sacred 1  -- things. And third, if you will abandon this project, which you now have in view, and which you pursue with such bitter earnestness, I will pardon you the past, and I will leave to God and to you the fu- ture." Kentucky said these words almost solemnly. There was no trace of the ordinary grim humor and sarcasm; only a manly impressiveness which cut deep. It went quite to the heart. Cocoon was silent; he had taken out his penknife and was industriously digging a hole in the bark of the tree behind which we stood. I could see that great drops of sweat stood on his brow, and that a blood-bead on his under lip betrayed emotion. But ,* Margaret turned from Kentucky sternly, and in a ;i: voice which seemed far away, said,-- X  "Very well; you have declared war, and you cannot expect me to be other than your enemy.

It bred its exotic, but its pestilence too. No, I cannot accept your propositions to renounce my work. I will not; and I wonder how the proud Kentucky can humble himself enough to hint at the possibility of love's re- newal, when she who loved him has told him that the love is dead and buried. What you say about the young man who has so generously and nobly fulfilled a dying man's request has but little weight with me." Her voice softened, her eyes seemed to grow more luminous, and her tones were full of caresses, as she added, "Do not think that I could or would presume to win his love. Coquette as I have always been, co- quette as I shall be to my grave, I would not trifle with an honest passion. No, I did not trifle with yours. The fire that fell upon your altar found fire already there. Indeed, George, you must not draw me into such extrayagances; I am but a poor, weak, and honest woman earnestly endeavoring to. do what I think right. It may be in pursuance of a vow, which is the result of my own foolishness; but that, as our French friends say, is not your affair.

They started to return, but they had gone but a few steps before she stopped, and once more looking lp to the thin brown face grimly bent over her, said,  "There was a certain glory about those moonlight   rambles along the fiagrant lawns and the smooth roadways in those Newport days; or was it youth and the flush of love?

I have gained a fresh wound; or perhaps it is only the old scar which has opened anew. I have been compelled to recognize you as an enemy, when I desired to for- get you, and I have not learned in a satisfactory man- ner the story of your vow, nor why you believe it to be incumbent upon you to trifle with a tiger, whose claws are long and terrible. Itls not for your own safety that you need fear, intrigue as you will be- tween French and Prussians; but it is for the safety of those you may entrap and make to do your bidding that I fear. Remember, I will not have Cocoon sac- rificed to this folly; trifle with him at your peril!  They were lost in an intervening shade; and I turned to Cocoon and held out my hand. He closed his penknife, put it in his pocket, took out his hand- kerchief and carefully dusted his waistcoat, on which some fragments of the bark clung, looked at me quiz- zically a moment, then said, - TI love her more than ever before; I love Ken- tucky more and better than I can ever love woman; and God help me, I know not what to do." "In that case," said I, cheerily, "suppose we saunter back to the Bohemian Club; or even go to the Caf6 de   *In ;KENTUCKY'S WARNING.              125 Neptune and re-dine.

HEN   we reached Kentucky's chamber, it was long past midnight. The sentinels in front of the king's residence scowled ominously at us as we passed. The cavalry patrol rode close to us, and made us declare ourselves. One or two drunken soldiers urged us to have some beer with them in a neighbor- ing cafe, and hear their exploits in the Champigny fight; and a few carts, with fatigued Frenchmen driv- ing them, were starting out under strong escort, loaded with provisions for some of the outposts. We first entered my room, and there I pointed to the mirror, and motioned Cocoon before it. A certain deadly whiteness, which I had never before remarked on the face of any human being, overspread: his fea- tures. He seemed like one who had taken haschish, and seen a great vision of eternity, or something dreadful and indescribable, that had arrested all his blood, and sent his soul wandering so far away that he   -v-:     COCOON, KENTUCKY, AND I.     127 could not recall it. He had not the relief of the II  piano, like Kentucky; he could not thunder away, and drown down deep his sorrows and passions in the I  clangor of the finale of the Fourteenth Sonata, or the :!  passionate refrain of Von Weber's last waltz. I X3  thought this, but I did not say it; and I remembered a  how those two masterpieces of music had expressed both the past and the future to me, and I doubted not X  to Kentucky and Cocoon, when the baron's corporal played them upon the piano in the villa at Montmo- rency. : I  "Cocoon, my boy," said I, "rub your cheeks fierce- ly; thump yourself, wake up; you are a ghost. Light my Dresden pipe; tie a handkerchief around your neck, pull your hair over your eyes, drink a glass of brandy and water, and come with me to Kentucky's room. II y va de votre vie. You must not succumb in this manner; we must meet Kentucky with a bold front, arid we must tell him that we have already un- willingly played the part of eavesdroppers." "What?" said Cocoon.     "' Yes," I said; "we must own that we have heard the epic of Newport, that we know all. 'I will not be content with less." i "You always were a nuisance," grumbled Cocoon. "Much as I love Kentucky, I do not think I owe him this."  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7012-00000065"/> 128      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. "But you shall do it," I said. And so much in ear- nest was I, that I clenched my fist as if I held him in my hand and shook him. "Very well," he said; "I leave it to you. But since you are kind enough to say in French lingo that my life is at stake, perhaps it would be well for you to remember that you must not trifle." "My dear boy," I said, "I am older than you. I know Kentucky better than you do. He is devoted; he will show you wherein you have erred, as he has erred in loving this woman, to whom, since I have heard her speak thus to the man whom most of all I respect and honor, I have a strange repugnance. Somebody once told me that my instincts were always right. I warn you against her, and sooner than see you sacrificed to her, I will go over to the enemy; that is, I will fight under Kentucky's banner." Cocoon had taken up a tiny crystal glass, and had filled it with delicatest Cognac, whose perfume loaded the air. He was about to raise it to his lips, but he crushed it in his hand, and, looking at me with a wild fire in his eyes, he stammered, rather than said, "I believe you were right; Kentucky must know all; he must even know' that I love this woman. How to tell him I do not know, but I swear to you that I do, must, and shall cherish this love until some greater force than he or you can bring to bear thrusts me out    i  :     COCOON, KENTUCKY, AND .      129 of this 'folly' into the colder region of common sense. J   "No, I do not think it necessary to conceal my agita- g   tion. I shall not rub my cheeks, or smoke your pipe; but I will go with you straight to him, and we will tell him-well--  we will tell him-I don't know-let the presence of the man himself determine that." So we went to Hentucky's room. "I knew it," said Cocoon, as we approached; there he is, pumping away at the old Newport waltz. If he cannot forget her, how do you expect that can " We went in without knocking. Kentucky ceased playing the instant we entered, and, blowing a great cloud of smoke iomn his massive pipe, strode forward to us, and stretched out his hands. I grasped one, ::i  and Cocoon the other. "My boys," he said, with a fervor and emphasis new to us, "I have been through a great trial. It is all over now, and if you do not press e to tell you how and what it was, I will not; bu most of all things in this world-A-nd the world i little to me nowadays- do I esteem my loyalty t you; and, if you command me, I will tell you what the mysterious ,  lady has said; yes, even what she has not said; for she artfully conceals the mystery of her strange con- nection with the man we saw dying and dead in the forest of Enghien." "Give me a pipe," said Cocoon. ,  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7012-00000066"/> 130      KENTUCKY'S LO VE.  Kentucky gravely handed his own to his friend. "Let us sit down," said our host. "No," said Cocoon, musingly, "I don't think that we need to hear what you have to offer, because-- well, the fact is, we have heard it already." Kentucky looked at him for a moment, and there was a flash of anger in his eye. Then he said, " ow did that happen?" 2' So we explained, and Cocoon was about to enter upon protestations, when Kentuckygravely checked  him.                        : "My boy," he said, "I fear you misunderstood me. When I told Margaret that, if she would desist from i: her mad project, I would trust to God and the future to make us once more as before, I certainly did not mean lovers. All that is gone, gone, gone. It is im- possible for you to comprehend how utterly it is gone! I I would further your suit to-morrow, with the utmost pleasure, if I seriously believed it for your good.  No; you must not fancy that every love in this  world is God-sent and beneficial. You are in the toils,  my son, and you must beware; you must strive des- perately, you must fight bitterly, you must have unceasing vigilance, or you will be overcome and lost." And you do not love this woman to-day " said Cocoon, slowly.   COCOON, KENTUCK, AND L.      131 ",Upeu -pas du tout!" answered Kentucky, care- lessly. "Was it an honest love in other, days?"  "Yes," he responded in the same vein as before. "And I must not love her now?" said Cocoon. "I would not," said Kentucky, with a return of his old severe satire. 'But you do," was all that Cocoon said; and Ken- tucky returned to the piano, and began playing, im- provising, I suspect. Cocoon thrust himself moodily into an arm-chair in front of one of the great windows overlooking the Place, turned his back on us, and blew his smoke- cloud ferociously. As for myself, I was so supremely contented with the pacified turn that affairs had assumed, that I felt inclined to leave the two together, to hasten into my own room, and there muse upon the next step to be taken; but I felt almost as if I were stifling. Kentucky had overheated his room. There was a slumbrous and languid heat in the melody which he was now playing, which added fire to the fire in my blood, and I hastily left them. In the morning, I stole to my window, overlooking the great Place, and watched the cloaked and sabred soldiers clattering towards the barracks, with their flat black and red caps drawn slouchingly over their  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7012-00000067"/> 132      KENTUCKY'S LOVE.            i eyes; watched the long trains of forage rumbling over  the cobble-stones of the street; watched the military  postmen wearily droning along to the restaurant where j: eight hundred princes and dukes were revelling;  watched the gaunt, haggard landwehr-man leaning, like  Leather Stocking, upon his gun, and pensively looking  towards Germany, with desire in his eyes; watched  the ragged Frenchmen riding home the conquerors' horses, which they had been sent to exercise in the park; watched the silent, grim, impassive figure, arrow-  like, which passed slowly along the path by the ped-  estal of General Hoche's statue,--passed it without  looking up,--seemingly absorbed in deep thought, and knew it for Moltke; watched the burly figure of the division general, attended by half a dozen subal-  terns, as it passed pompously through the park en  route for its dinner; watched the bedizened English ambulance-doctor, flurried, gold-laced, and comfortable;  watched the long line of sanitary corps men, marching : out in the gray morning light, with their blood-red  cross in the pure white field of their flag raised as proudly over him who upheld it as if he sought the Holy Grail; watched a dozen vapid and maundering  old women, seated at their little tables, where they sold roasted chestnuts and half-frozen pieces of ginger-  bread, as they shook their fists at the departing "Sani- taries;" watched the great turbulent current of morn-   COCOON, KENTUCICY AND I.     133 ing military and civil life at Versailles, until my eyes grew weary of the repetition of the old, old spectacle; and I was turning away, humming thoughtfully a lit- tle song, with the burden of war in it, when my eye. suddenly fell upon the mysterious lady. There she was, crossing the little square like a flash, her pure figure enveloped in jet black, and her features carefully concealed by an ample veil. I knew her by her fawn-like motion, by the delicate carriage of her graceful person; and some strange impulse prompted me to put my hat on, bound down three flights of stairs, follow her across the square, and bring up breathless beside her, with, - "Miss Margaret, good morning!" She turned hastily, almost as if offended, but in- stantly raised her veil, and looking up to me with a grave sign of welcome, said,-  "And how has the little comedy progressed since last we met?" I was angry; I ground my teeth; I stamped on the frozen ground; I almost wished that she were a man that I might resent to the utmost this cold, cynical way of looking at a subject which had now become almost inexpressibly painful. At last I said,- "I was not aware that we had been assisting at a comedy in thQse troublous times; and, under military law, nothing, it strikes me, could be more inappropriate."  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7012-00000068"/> 34     lKENTUCK Y'S LOV E. Then I bit my lip and reflected; because, after all,  he may not, thought I, have meant any reference to Wocoon and Kentucky, but rather to the search at ler house, and the poor results which the Prussians iad for their labor; so I added cautiously,-X "Unless, indeed, Miss Margaret, you refer to the :omedy of the search;" and I forced a laugh. "Yes," she said, "I did. It seems, after consider- able reflection, rather astonishing that so great an in- : dignity should have been offered to an American lady, and I feel almost like protesting against it; all thei more so," she added, breathing hard, "as I understand j that there is a probability of a repetition." "A repetition!"I said, in surprise. "Do they  really fancy that you have compromising documents in your possession?" "Ah," she said lightly, "I don't know what they  i fancy; but I fear me, much, that you are compro- mising yourself by speaking to me. Even the doors  and windows have ears.  I have been to find a  certain officer who is said to have made use of my  X name as a person open to suspicion; and, inasmuch  as I am -tolerably familiar with German, I should have  warned him not to do it again, had I found him."  I looked at her with renewed astonishment, and said, "Will you not intrust me with that mission?" "No," she said; "men do not understand such   COCOON, KENTUCKY, AND 1.     135 things; you would ruin my cause by being too violent. The young officer would instantly send you a challenge. It would be a matter behind the trees in the park, and there would be a scandal. I do not desire any mascu- line quarrelling for my sake; and, after all, it is a sitm- ple matter. I propose, when I meet him, to avert suspicion by overwhelming frankness ; and she laughed softly, and, as I thought, without restraint. a Good morning," she said, pleasantly, and fluttered away, leaving me with bared head and outstretched hands, amazed and confused by her strange de- meanor. I walked slowly back to the house, firmly convinced that my duty was to inform Kentucky of what had happened, and to put him upon the track of the mys- terious lady; but that worthy individual was nowhere to be found. His room bore no evidence of having been recently entered. There was no litter of books; there were no pipe ashes; there was no glass half filled with the amber-colored brandy and water; the piano was carefully closed, and had been religiously dusted by the domestic.  I called loudly several times, "Kentucky, Kentucky," and went into Co- coon's room; but they were not to be found. Madame Varlin could give no information concerning them; they had been seen together just at daylight, but had said nothing about going away. A strange thrill  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7012-00000069"/> 136      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. ran through me. I looked at myself in the mirror, when I returned to my room, and found that I was  quite pale. I sat down and tried to think.  "Is it possible," I said, " that something may have  happened to draw them into a quarrel? This is the hour for-  Pshaw!" .I said; it's absurd. I'll not even think it."  Thren I reflected that they might have been ar-  rested; and the pleasing memory of various guard- houses, more or less commodious, into which I had1 been thrust during the campaign, arose before me;  ! but I would not/ look them up at present. I would wait a few hours; and then, if they did not reappear,  I would upturn Versailles; and while I was thus mus-  ing, in walked Kentucky, and gave me a ponderous   : slap on the back.-  I told him of my fears, and of my adventure with  i the lady. He smiled wearily, and said,. ;  "We have all seen her this morning, and she is  abroad at a very strange hour. Never since we have  been here have the officers and the aristocratic riff-  raff over there," pointing in the direction of the Hotel  des Reservoir, "had breakfast so early; and how she, C should have known that the officer whom she is in search of would be there this morning, I cannot im- agine. Yes, she explained her mission to me, and Master Cocoon took her on his arm, and walked off   COCOON, KENTUCKY AND L      137 with her. I fancy he will persuade her to say noth- ing, and I will wager that we may now find them walking in the park." "'Kentucky," I said, "seriously, what is to be the end of this? The woman does not love Cocoon, and yet the man is mad for her. We have overheard, as we have told you, all your little episodic conver- sation in the alley the other evening. If you fear that she may use Cocoon to accomplish some danger- ous scheme, why not take him entirely, out of her clutches before it is too late? We can do noth- ing here; we are completely at her mercy. Now that we are acquainted, we are in duty bound to protect her; and she has fairly absorbed Cocoon into her very existence. Suppose she tells him this morning in the park by a word, by a sign, by a quiver of her eyelashes, that she loves him; it is all over then; and despite her protestations to you, I'll war- rant that she does it." "Well," said Kentucky, "I don't know that that concerns us, after all. I have warned her, and I have warned Cocoon. Let them play; youth comes only once. What are we to have for breakfast? I am frightfully hungry." We went down to consult Madame Varlin on the important matter of breakfast.  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7012-00000070"/> 138      KENTUCKY'S LO VtE. *:i CHAPTER X. IN THE TOILS. AL CRISP, clear, winter morning; the whole land  in and around Paris and her hundred deserted suburban towns clad in garments of glittering, crys- tal snow. The regiments, defiling through the Placej d'Armes, rejoice in the cool but fragrant sunlight reflected upon the white mantle fallen from heaven; and they send up lusty German songs as they march, from time to time, towards that front whence now almost daily comes an ominous roar of battle, and whence the wounded come back with such fright- ful regularity. The whole world seems aglow with life, and light, and energy. One can almost fancy, that from tle leafless boughs of the great trees in the avenues the birds are about to break into song. Despite the cold and crispness of the atmosphere, there is a hint of spring in the air; and it sends the blood swaying and rushing in hearty currents through the frame,   IN' THE TOILS.       139 puts electricity into every motion, and sets one on fire with desire to mix in the gigantic striving out beyond the hill. Every movement brings some new episode in this strange life of beleaguering; the blare of trumpets, the clamor of the bands, whose hearty-throated mu- sicians seem to blow with new fervor, as they intone the beloved accents of the "Watch on the Rhine;" the roll of drums; the tramp and quadrupedante of horses, galloping swiftly and steadily away, bearing their impassive and almost motionless riders to the front; the groaning, and the moaning and crying of the cannon, hour by hour; the stern, unrelenting voice of Valerien; the restless, dissonant barking of Montrouge; the sharp staccato of Issy, and the smooth, deadly thud of the Prussian rifled cannon, playing night and day into the walls of starving and prostrate Paris; the glittering equipage of the king, accompanied by the prancing staff and youth- ful cavaliers; the stout form of the crown prince, booted and spurred, riding quietly to and fro in the avenues for exercise; the stern drill-masters in public squares, exercising the new recruits, who have come up to aid in exterminating France, and the weary men who -have crawled out from the hospitals to get a breath of the bracing air,-- all these flit past us like the figures in a dream, like phantasma-  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7012-00000071"/> "O      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. goria in some strange vision, as we wander slowly through the town, thinking little of wars and rumors of wars, and more of the passions which sway our own breasts. It has been a whole week since that memorable night when Kentucky, Cocoon, and I met for mutual. confession; nay, it has been a week since the morning  when I suddenly encountered the mysterious lady, and when Kentucky and I decided to leave CocoonJ to go his own ways with her. The week has been  dull, uneventful. We have had only the usual bowls  of soup in the early morning, breakfasts at midday,  : and dinners at six, with an occasional adventurous canter in and about the further points in the lines,  and our little romance seems to have stopped short; - for the mysterious lady, as we now almost always  call her, has not once sent us word that our presence  would gladden her home; and we hear, through the servants, that she is busily engaged with her invalid father, who has heard that they are suspected--of  what, he does not know; but he feels it must be  something terrible, and is very ill. From time to time I have given Cocoon a gentle hint that I should be pleased to know why, on that morning after he had walked with the lady in the park, he came home with such luminous eyes, and with such strange demeanor. But each time I have   IN THE TOILS.       141 been so gently and quietly rebuffed, that I have not dared to proceed. As for Kentucky-- well, we do not see Kentucky much nowadays; he is busy with maps, with plans; he is consulting the Prussian offi- cers, gathering materials for a book, I fancy, making himself industrious from morning till night, rarely remaining in his room, and never touching the piano. We hear no more of his thunderous outhursts of music at midnight, when he only enters his room to drop wearily into his bed, and to be off again at early dawn. He has even met us, and reproached us for wasting our time in dilly-dallying and lounging, as he terms it, and urged us to make sketches; for the end, he says, is not far off, now that the bombardment has begun. On this particular morning, Cocoon and I are walk- ing slowly up and down the various streets of the town, drinking in the pure winter air, and moodily noting all the little episodes which go to make up so memorable a sojourn at the old home of Louis XIV. By and by we stroll away from the murmur and out- crying of the soldiery near the town's centre, and, walking up the long Avenue de Paris, we find our- selves at a turning which leads us into the Rue de la Patte d'Oie, a narrow, rickety, tumble-down street of antique Versailles. Cocoon stops, and laughingly translates the name of the street, reading it from the sign of the corner.  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7012-00000072"/> "2      KENTUCKI YS  O VYE.            "Goose-foot Street," he says; " let us go down."  ! We stroll tranquilly down the tortuous avenue, gaz- ing at right and left upon diminutive houses, with   X crooked roofs, and window panes diamond-shaped and    small. We pass little rookeries, whose projecting roofs almost touch our heads, and others, tall, grim, and silent, which seem to contain some mystery, or some ghosts, vanished from happier worlds. Suddenly Co- coon turns. "I hear some one calling us," he says.   j Then, whirling on his heel, "Never mind; it is prob- ably a beggar." But, as we walk along, the cry is re-  peated. Some one is evidently calling us, although no names are mentioned. We pause to await the arrival of a blue-bloused man, who comes hurrying towards   X us, flourishing his arms like the sails of a windmill. "Hola, monsieur," he says brokenly, in French; "I have had a nice run to catch you. It is high time that  you should know that I am at last free;" and he stops short, for my countenance betrays the most profound  amazement, and Cocoon puzzles his brains, trying to place the man, as he says.              a "But don't you remember me?" he asks; and his face grows pale, and his lip quivers, as he says, "Per-  haps I have been mistaken." And he turns, as if about to run. Then, catching his breath, he says, "No; but certainly I met you in the park, sir, last week; and you two were together at her house when \                     l   IN TEEE TOILS, . "3 the search was made."  There is almost agony in his face, as he adds,- "Am I not right?" Cocoon places his hand to his forehead, as if quite bewildered. Then, with a sudden outhurst of com- prehension, - "Why, surely, yes, you are, too." And he leans against the house for support. It is clear to me, even before Cocoon has his burst of comprehension. I see plainly that the blue-bloused man is he who was arrested on the day of the search. What he says about having met Cocoon in the park convinces me that the mysterious lady is in conjunc- tion with him, and that she is using Cocoon, almost without his own knowledge, as a means of conspiracy. Of course the blue-bloused mall is an agent- one of the many who, in times past, have played into the hands of the man whom   we saw shot at Enghien; and now here he is, taking us into his confidence with a looseness and freedom which certainly augur any- thing but fear.

If you can manage to come without your friends, it will be better, for I have little heart to try and entertain them.

IN THE TOILS.       145 He turns to me with the sunniest smile upon his face I have seen for many years. It usurps the place usually-occupied by his youthful beauty, and, looking straight into his eyes, I can almost fancy that he is delirious with the glow of his new love. "Cocoon," I say, " there is danger to yourself in your eyes. I wish you might look in the glass; they would astonish you." He turns away, without making any answer, the peasant following him, and he murmurs in a low tone a few words to the blue-blouse, who seems delighted, and scampers away in the direction whence he came. "Well," I say; as we walk on, you have promised to go this evening, of course; and you will go, and will hover about the flame, and your wings will be burned. This woman has not sent for you in vain. She does not love you, but she has sent for you to accomplish a certain purpose." Cocoon turns upon me, his eyes filled with fire. "Sir," says he; then he breaks down. "No," he resumes, in a gentler voice, "my good old friend, my dear old boy, I cannot think you meant to insult her, or me; but I wish to Heaven that both you and Kentucky knew more strictly the nature of a brutality. You like to be gross; I fear I do not enjoy it." No answer is necessary; so I make none.

Why are you always suspecting  motives, prying into secrets, making yourselves almost  offensive to your friend,-not allowing that he has  even judgment, in a matter in which instinct is the  only safe guide?

"Ah," he says, "my old friend, I am indeed in agony until I know the secret of that picture which I   Ir THE TOILS.       147 the. dying spy gave into my hands at Enghien. This suspense is horrible; it wrenches my life, it tears me to tatters." I follow him patiently, for I dare say that some memory of my old troubles arises before me, and I reinember how bitter is the suspense and half jeal- ousy, born always of love, ready to rise in an instant, at the slightest pretext, when a strong man is striving in the toils of an almost overmastering passion. Thinking it all over now, as Cocoon told me the story the next day, I could not repress a feeling of savage regret, almost remorse, for having allowed him to go to the rendezvous which the blue-bloused man had made for him. Cocoon told the story so tenderly, so touchingly, and withal so concisely, that I would like to give it in his own language; but I cannot, and I will outline it here, something in this wise:- When we reached home, after our walk in the Rue de la Patte d'Oie, Cocoon fell upon the breakfast as if he were half famished, and so severely punished the wine, that Madame Varlin herself came into the breakfast-room, to see who was the' additional guest. Cocoon was full of a certain noisy and reckless gayety, manifested in snatches of song, recitations from the poets, bits of burlesque talk, wild and inane vaporings -the froth of his really superb intellect. His pet '?  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7012-00000075"/> "8      KENTUCKY 'S LO E.  subject of ridicule during the remainder of the day  was what he was pleased to term "the conspiracy."1 In it, he said, he totally refused to believe, - the ? mysterious lady was the most innocent of people, and had been much abused. He would not for one mo-    f ment allow that she had anything to do with trickery i in connection with the spy's death, and grimly asserted  that he would prove her innocence in that respect ere j long.                         : Towards evening he relapsed into a more quiet and  thoughtful mood, and we dined very seriously to-   i; gether. Cocoon ate like an ogre, and drank like a fish; but he said little, and I never shall forget that he bade me good by with almost as much emphasis as if he were going to be hanged or ignominiously shot. Half an hour later, I saw him, dressed for his :. evening call, moving away slowly towards the mansion  where the mysterious lady lived. When he reached   ^ the house it was quite dark, and a great dog sprang  forward at him in the pathway leading to the steps, i:' and for some time disputed his passage, until at last the iJii door was flung open, and the tall man-servant marched gingerly forth, pacified the dog, and accompanied   Master Cocoon into the drawing-room.         E To his surprise, there were none of the horrid evi- dences of sickness, none of the little anxieties, none of the perfume of camphor, of brandy, or of medicines,   IN ITHE TOILS.        149 mingled, floating in nauseating heaviness upon the air. The invalid was evidently hidden securely away where he could hear no noise, for as the young man crossed the threshold of the drawing-room, the soft ripple of a fanliliar melody fell .upon his ear. He stood as if spell-bound, not darin     to speak, not wishing to speak, his whole soul lost in the music, ;which grladually grew more passionate and clamorous, until at last it rose, and with one long, sweeping, surging rush of notes, seemed to clasp him in its embrace, and to bear him away in an inspiration such as he had never dreamed  of. Everything faded before him -the drawing-room, with its scented atmosphere of flowers, the dark shadow which fled along the polished floor, and seemed to fly out at the window in the little re- cess, where we had sat and talked all that memorable day of the search. The portraits, the book-racks, the easy-chairs, the great fauteuil, all vanished, and he saw nothing but a pure, graceful figure, with sweet, low brow, and brown hair, with pleading eyes, and noble uplift of face. He would have stepped forward and clasped it to his breast; then it faded away, like all other things, before him, and again he was lost in the glow and glory of the great melody. He tried to re- call his senses, but he could not; the magic spell still held him, and it was not until the final clamor and clangor when the bugles played and rang out cheerily  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7012-00000076"/> 1'I 150      KENTUCKY"S LOVE. in the closing refrain, that he remembered that this was  the witch of whom Kentucky was so fond; that this was the old Newport melody, and that Margaret sat in the  shadow by the piano, playing her whole soul into this wonderful piece. I do not know how long he stood there; but as soon as the piece was finished, the in-  genious fingers wandered back through all the tangled  drift of the melody and began anew, but this time played with a stronger fervor, with a grander emphasis,  so that each moment it gained in pathos and power;  there was a yearning quality of desire in it which  strangely smote upon his heart. He put down his hat, and walked quietly into the drawing-room, towards the  piano. When he came close to it he knelt down be-  side the fair player, and placed his head upon his  hands, and both upon the keys. A discord was of  course the result. The player arose, startled, and  almost angry, to her feet; but he remained kneeling, and said nothing. A moment afterwards she sat down again; then he said,- : "Had you nothing to offer me to-night, Margaret, but the memory of an old love, and all the pain and  anguish which it brings? Have I merited this at  your hands? Was it a trap which you had set for me?" She bent down over him, and, in a low whisper, , ' S   IN THE TOILS.        151 like the sighing of a gentle breeze through the forest in summer, said,  "The old love is gone, and it is only the beauty of the melody that prompted me to play it; for indeed I do not know why I have played it. I had lost myself in it. I did not know that you were there;" and she stopped short. "Now I am here, may I remain?" said he. "No;" she said, with dignity; "please to sit down in yonder chair, and I will ring for lights." Cocoon's dream seemed vanishing. "Ring for lights!" he said in a husky voice; "no; do not do that - I - I - unless indeed- I will not, - I will listen." "Listen!" she said; "to what? to the music, fair sir?" "As you please, lady," said he; "to the music, if you like; to what you had to tell me, if you will. Can you tell me what you have to say, by means of music?" She laughed, not coarsely and ostentatiously, but a low, sweet laugh, grateful enough to the infatuated youth, who rose, and cried out, "Margaret, let us have no trifling; please do not be theatrical. Play me now something which shall soothe my mind, take away this unrest and foolish fervor which possess me, and put me in a proper spirit to speak to you." "But," she said, "you should not allow your moods  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7012-00000077"/> 152       KENTUCKY'S LOVE. to depend upon external influences. Can you not con  trol yourself?"                       I "Not always," said Cocoon, with a sigh. Alas! it was too true; and while he leaned back in    iX his chair, closed his eyes, and wished that this beauti-  ful dream of happiness, when he was so near to her,  when the darkness was so odorous, and the music so  -  ! bewitching, might last forever, she began to sing. It - was a simple song she sang, set, indeed, to a simpler melody; but there was passion in her voice, pathos in her music. One verse ran thus:- "Yet sometimes the remembered days Shall fill me with a sense of doom;  Sometimes across my darkened ways  Shall come a hint of light and bloom; $  The glory of your vanished gaze  Shall thrill me even in my tomb."  "Sing on," said Cocoon; "it is glorious; as glorious  i as pitiful."  She sang again: -                    i "It is another sun that shines          0- High in the changed and dreary heaven,    ! It is a sad soul that repines, Regrets, and will not be forgiven;  Our love hath poured its rarest wines; Our bread of life hath lost its leaven." The voice died  away with the last words into  grief. Margaret bowed her head upon her hands, and sobbed.    IN THE TOILS.        153 Cocoon arose from his chair, and paced to and fro in the room. He was powerfully affected, and knew scarcely what to do or say. Great waves of jealousy, of love, of suspicion, of adoration, swept through his soul. When he turned for the twentieth time in his rapid marlhing to and from the piano, he saw Margaret arise and glide out of the room. In a few moments the servant appeared with candles. This was the first act of the evening.' When Margaret returned, after a few minutes' ab- sence, there were no traces of tears upon her face. She came directly to him, and said, "Let us not speak of this folly. I am worn out with watching by my sick father's bedside; I am weary and impatient; even the slightest old memories have a power to awaken in me strange chords. Do forgive me;" and she held out her little hand. What could he do else? Of course he forgave her. Forgave her for what? He smiled a bitter smile, and the conversation lagged. So Margaret, seeing that he was embarrassed, ill at ease, and withal fdesperately anxious to know the real reasons of her conduct, took from her bosom the mysterious locket, which had been committed to his care in the forest of Enghien, and laid, it on the table before him. "Cocoon," she said, - and his face flushed with love  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7012-00000078"/> 54      KENTUCKY'S LOVE.  nd surprise, so tenderly, so lovingly she murmured  "s name, "henceforth there must be no secrets be-   , ween us.

F Cocoon grasped her hands; she did not withdraw   ! them. He knelt at her feet; she was impassive as  marble. He rose impatiently, and resumed his seat in  his chair.                      i "No," she said; "hear me; and then judge."     : j^$e   MARGARET'S STORY.       155 CHAPTER   XI L MARGARET'S STORY. "N the first place, Cocoon," she said, "the worst suspicions which you may have had concerning my role at Versailles are true." She drew her breath hard, and looked searchingly at him; but the youth had now assumed a grave and wise attitude; had taken from the table a Sorrento wood paper-cutter, and was toying with it. She took the toy gently from his hands, and laid it back upon the table. "I must have your entire attention," she said, "as well as your respect. Without them I do not know that I can proceed." He looked at her with surprise in his great eyes. Was she acting a part? Was this some stupendous joke, the cruelty of which would be all the more ap- parent after the delicious flavor of its deception was gone? No; he could not believe that; so he looked straight in her face, and she went on in a low, trem- ulous voice:-  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7012-00000079"/> 156      KENTUCK Y'S LO VE.  "Yes, I am playing a dangerous game, as your friend Kentucky has told me. If, at this moment, Graf Von Moltke, and one or two other of the 4 powers that be,' could be present, the course of this degrading and disgraceful siege would be materially changed. You remember perfectly every little incident con- nected with the slaughter of my friend at Enghien." "Yes." "That man was nothing to me. I mean," she added, hastily, "that because he possessed my picture, there is no inference to draw. I never saw him but twice. But listen to this little episode, Cocoon, for I -yes, six years ago-in the bloomy lanes of New-  port, when I was younger and more attractive than now, my eye first fell upon a brother of this dead spy, and I learned to love him. I will not tell you pre- cisely what he was; let it suffice that he was noble by birth, and, as I thought, by nature; that he was flit- ting for a few months near the bright flames of our too strongly pronounced and highly colored American society, and that the time came when we met and loved. They called me 'the Newport belle,' in those days; and, although I had been taught, with the cus- tomary wiliness of society women, to beware of the -gilded foreigner, still I felt that I had not chosen amiss. We were engaged, not in the cold, formal fashion consequent on two summers of flirtation, but   MAARGARET'S STORY.       157 there was a real and earnest love between us. There were other foreigners in this society, and among them a tall, haughty, blue-eyed, blond-mustachioed Prus- sian, elegant in culture and manners, who pursued me with a persistence which I have never before or since seen equalled. Of course he hated his formidable rival, not merely because of his success, but because of his nationality. A duel ensued; and one day, Charles Regnier, my husband to be, walked into a for- est at some distance from the town, stood up against this defiant Prussian, with a pistol in his hand, and never left the forest alive. The Prussian, overwhelmed by the vengeance which he had visited upon his rival, fled from America. "There was a scene, of course; there was even a scandal. But I was exonerated from all participation in this bloody deed, as indeed I had a right to expect; and I still wilfully braved the current of society, kept down my anguish, and hid from all the world the fact that I had been the promised wife of this dead Regnier." Cocoon leaped to his feet. He had taken the paper- knife again in his hands, and, in his excitement, he broke it, threw it on the floor, and trampled it in frag- ments. "Margaret," he said, "I should have known this before."  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7012-00000080"/> 58     KENT UCKY'S LOVE. She interrupted him. "Cocoon," she said, "do not reproach me. A year passed, and I, who had so bravely kept from all the world this pitiful story, had, meantime, in the mad whirl of society, seen much of your friend Kentucky. Ie has told me that you overheard our conversation n the alley the other night; therefore I need not ex- alain to you that he awakened in me all the love which had lain dormant for so long, all which would lave been given to the dead Regnier. I fought against it; I questioned myself; my own motives; I vould not believe my senses; I struggled, with all  he force of a will which had not often gone astray; ut it was in vain, and I persuaded myself that I had lever loved Regnier; that it was but a wild impulse; hat it was perhaps better that he had been so std- lenly taken from me. Then came the intelligence hat this same Regnier had been a reckless profligate, Hlard man, with many society-crimes upon his soul; nd I think that that decided me. I gave myself to Kentucky. People said it was a brilliant match; it was made public; it was a gallant Southron and the 'air maid of the North, and kind hearts pardoned his 'ebellious sympathies, his defiant language, and fore- 5aw in our future union a type of the desired pact )etween the two hostile sections of the country. It was all very pretty, very touching - was it not?" she   MARGARET'S STORY.       159 said, smiling. Now that I think it over, it was very romantic; highly calculated," she added, coldly, "I should judge, to impress you with a sense of my sin-  cerity, and my knowledge of my own character." Cocoon made no answer; a great battle was going on in his soul. "And if, Cocoon, you believe, from this brief story, that I did not know my own heart, you are right; because the time came when the old love for the dead seemed to grow anew, seemed to possess and overmaster me, seemed to take total possession of every fibre of my body and my soul, seemed to usurp all the avenues of thought, and to make me the bride of the dead, rather than of the living. So, one day, I told Kentucky gravely that henceforth we must part; and we did, to meet, as you saw, in this drawing-room. He is so sadly, so inexpressibly changed that I hardly knew him." She dashed her palms together with a pretty ges- ture, as if sweeping away, daintily, some unpleasant recollections, or trying to wash some stain from her hands, and, looking up, jauntily, said,-- "Is not this an humiliating confession?" Still Cocoon made no answer. The battle was raging terribly. "We did part," she resumed, "and I drifted here to Europe, in the old society fashion, courted, petted,  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7012-00000081"/> 160      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. idolized, followed; but hating everybody, despising everything, playing the artful coquette, and being mis- erable for it; but the old love for the dead"-she said this slowly, almosi; solemnly - -" never loosed its hold upon me; clung by me, night and day; clings to me-  "Still?" asked Cocoon. She made no reply, but cast down her eyes, and sat as if listening. As he said nothing, she once more resumed the thread of her story. "When this horrible tempest of war came deluging these two fair countries with misery, the old love seemed to say to me, - perhaps it was a monomania- I don't know, --Avenge my death; take up the cause  of the country that should have been yours; pardon all my old faults; remember me but as him who loved you;' and so I came here."              I Cocoon leaned forward, pale and breathless, intent on every word. "You see," she said, "I could be of' great service to France here. I was educated in this country, when a child. Before the war, I lived in all these pleasant little towns, now trampled under the invader's heel. I have wandered in many a forest hereabouts, and knew the  goings and comings of the peasants, into whose house- holds I have brought many a present. I had heard at Paris of Regnier's family, and I knew that he had a   MARGARET'S STORY.       161 brother placed high in the civil service of his coun- Ok  try. I sent to him to come and see me. He came; it was in September, when Paris was making her giant preparations for defence. I told him briefly who I was. He was deeply interested; spoke of the "romance;" pitied me; invited me to visit the country-seat of his fimily; but said that he himself was called away by imperative duty to the war. So he came again. At the second interview I said that I had something of special importance to communicate. He had seemed piqued and embarrassed by my second entreaty for his presence; but when I laid before him my scheme, although he was at first frightened at it, he confessed to its excellence and its power. "'Paqrbleu, Madame,' he said, 'you are indeed a genius; I know not what to think of you. Give me time to reflect upon this great undertaking, and if it strikes me, after a night's sleep, as it does now, I vow myself totally at your service, for I see that it is in the interest of our dear France.' "You asked me what that scheme was, Cocoon. No, you did not ask me with your lips,--you asked me with your eyes. I will tell you briefly. It was evident that Paris was to be shut in; all intelli- gent Frenchmen, certainly all foreigners, saw that. There was no help for it. The 'hussars of death' were already on the road to Versailles, and the city "  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7012-00000082"/> 162      KENTUCKY'S LO E. was powerless save to stubbornly resist in presence of the vast throng of invaders. What was to be done? The city would be surrounded, cut off from all commu- nication with France; the great armies which were even then coming together in the southern provinces would be of no avail, unless they could act simultaneously with the Parisian forces; so I formed a plan for main- taining communication at any risk, at all hazards, be- tween Paris and any point where great bodies of troops might be massed, preparing to help raise the siege." Cocoon was silent; he betrayed no emotion now. "It was very simple," said she. "I had always had a taste for conspiracy. Don't you know that woman's wits are sharper than man's in such matters? I was beyond suspicion, and Arthur Regnier and myself easily constructed a plan for maintaining cominunica- tion with Versailles, even during the hardest moments. We organized a clever system of spies, by means of which, now and then, important news could be car- ried from Paris through the Prussian lines all the way down to Orleans, and thence across to any part of Southern France where it might be needed. I gained Versailles without difficulty a few days before the investment of Paris, and persuaded my father, an in- valid, to come with me. We attracted no attention. As it so happened, we arrived here, ostensibly flying   M ARCARET'S STORY.      163 from Paris, on the very day when the Prussians barred our outward progress. We leased this house, and prepared to submit to the monotony of the siege. That was all the neighbors and our few acquaintances saw. Of course I continued, as I continud now, my duty. As I said, it may be a monomania, but I like it; and, until I have finished it, until the risks are all run, and I have succeeded or failed, I cannot, Cocoon, fully answer the question which you asked me in the park a week ago." Without saying more, she rose, went to the piano, and, as if moved by some memory, again began to play the sonorous Newport waltz. In an instant Cocoon was beside her, on his knees; and before he could command himself; he had said, in a voice tremulous with emo- tion,- "I love you, Margaret." This was the second act of the evening. O       6       O   &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7012-00000083"/> 164      KENTUCKY'S LO'VE. CHAPTER XII. AN OFFICIAL CALL. Y7 -'IIEN the waltz was finished, Cocoon quietly took his leave. He felt that there was no fur- ther explanation needed. Margaret had not even deemed it wise to enjoin secrecy upon him, but he thought it was expected. As he stood on the thres- hold, he said, - "Is this the story which you would have told my- self and my two friends the other day?" "Yes," she said, "substantially." "And is it now to remain a secret with me?" "No," she answered, lightly; "tell it to Kentucky and his friend, but it must go no farther, for many lives are at stake."              " "I promise," said Cocoon; and he kissed her hand, and withdrew into the darkness. Cocoon marvelled much, as he walked homeward, that she should have accorded him permission to tell this strange story to us; for he said to himself, "Well,   ' AN OFFICIAL CALL.      165 if she had intended to make a blind agent of me, and to do what Kentucky seems to think her capable of,- to sacrifice me in this mad pursuit of revenge, she would have commanded me not to tell him. No," he thought, "I will leave it all to the future, and I will place my heart in her hands." *                   d Since I am telling the story, I must be permitted now and then to sit upon the magic carpet, and to take liberties with time and events. The episode in this history which I am about to relate was told us long after the evening on which Cocoon made his fatal visit to Margaret, but in the thread of the story it comes now. After Cocoon had gone, Margardt returned to the piano. Like Kentucky, she sought relief in thunder- ous music, and she played a stern, stirring march, full of the sound of cannon, the inarch and countermarch of infantry, and the roll of drums. Into it her mood, strangely enough, prompted her to throw some vari- ations upon the grand refrain of the Marseillaise, so that to a listener her music Would have presented the strange anomaly of a Prussian march, filled with the noisy, resistless spirit of the invader, save in patches where the fervor and enthusiasm of the Gallic race broke out. Once or twice Margaret was frightened at herself. She glanced hastily over her shoulder, but  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7012-00000084"/> 166      KENTUCKY"S LOVE. she saw that the windows of the drawing-room were closed, and she heard no sounds on the long avenue save the occasional crunch, crunch, of the field gen- darme, as he paraded slowly and sombrely up and down. She played on with fervor and earnestness, until she had quite forgotten Cocoon, and all of the strange episodes of the romance which she had woven about herself. I don't know how long she lingered at the piano; but as she rose, and wearily passed her hand over her heated brow, the man-servant came hurrying to her, saying, in an almost frightened voice, - "Mademoiselle Margaret, -a strange gentleman- to see you." "Gentleman - strange- to see me?  she stam- mered. "Is he an American?" "No, Mademoiselle," he said, "it is not an Ameri- can. Indeed I cannot make him out; he is so haughty, so cold, and so stern, that I -in fact--" "That you dared not question him," said Margaret, laughing; " possibly a new search." "And shall H" "No," she said, comprehending. "I will go at once, and see who it is." As she stepped into the hall where the gleam of the half-extinguished candles in the great candelabra threw an uncertain shadow and ghostly lustre about her pure   AN OFFICI4L CALL.  167    -and fascinating form, a tall, thin man, wrapped in a long cloak, stepped forward to address her. She paused, arrested by some mysterious feeling of dread. She knew not what it was, but a shiver ran through 1    lher, and she dared not speak. Somewhere, at some I  time, she did not know when, she had seen this keen, satiric, impassive face, with its piercing eyes, its straight nose, its almost marble lips, and its terrible persistence of outline. It was not the face of a living, sentient, passionate being, but of, one overmastered by some controlling idea, given up to the carrying out of some l   great purpose. It could not be called the face of an enthusiast, because all the enthusiasm in it had been dominated and subordinated by years of study and work. It could not be called an inspiring face, because all the inspiration seemed to have been beaten down and trampled out under the terrible task of accom- plishment. It could not be called an heroic face; there were none of the elements of heroism in it; but it was a masterly face. The eyes seemed to say, "Obey;" behind them lurked a subtle, terrible power, which never for a moment relaxed its hold upon the body, which always kept it alert, filled with energy, instinct with action. The owner of the face was one of those never at a loss forlexpedients. There was no hesita- tion manifest in wrinkle at eyes, or lines about mouth; instantaneous action was the watchword of the face.  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7012-00000085"/> 168      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. Whoever the owner might be, he was a man who had fully made up his mind; who knew that he was play-  ing a safe game; who never hesitated, because of his supreme confidence in himself. All this flashed through the mind of Margaret woman, and acute in analysis of human nature-- in a moment; but the curtain about the man's iden- tity did not lift. She tried desperately to remember where she had met that face, where it had impressed itself upon her with such power, but in vain. The stranger had concealed his cap under his long cloak, and his arms were held stiffly at his sides, as if he had been paralyzed by the sudden shock of a shell,- as Margaret had once seen a poor soldier who was brought to the hospital at Versailles. Although his manner was deferential and courteous, there was still a bit of hauteur and censoriousness about it which alarmed her. As yet, no word had passed between them. Sud- denly the stranger addressed Margaret in pure French, slightly tinged with an indefinite accent, which she could not characterize; it was not an American accent, and she could not comprehend to what nation it be- longed. "Madame," said a grave, quiet voice, in the tone of a man well weighted with years, - for the stranger was nigh upon seventy,- "Madame, I desire your   !Ig AiX ANOFFICIAL CALL.           1 !....169 instant and close attention to certain remarks which I shall have the honor of making. I sincerely trust you will pardon an intrusion which is only forced by dute and I beg that you will not further question me, as we may easily clear up the subject of my doubt in five minutes' conversation. It is late, Madame; but as I am told that you are an Amer ican, and that in your country intrusions and social oyersights are sometimes passed in silence, I beg you to remember the abnormal condition of circum- stances in which we at present are, and to pardon me." Thbe face was slightly inclined forward; one arm still hung stiffly to the side, and the other was raised in a half-military, half-civil salute; then dropped instantly, as if the owner had caught himself off his guard. Margaret answered, coolly,- "This, sir, is my father's house, and I should be loath to hinder any one, especially one of my own countrymen, from   entering it, no matter at what hour. Still, sir, it is late; I do not know you; but I beg you to step in, to be seated, and to explain your mission. Is it possible that I have the honor of ad- dressing the Herr, Von Grafitz, the distinguished surgeon, whon my father desired to have come to him from Berlin?" A half smile flitted over the strange face, then it  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7012-00000086"/> 170      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. was lost in the unfathomable impassiveness; and the voice said, in a quieter tone,-  "No, Madame; my name is Helmuth Von Moltke. At mention of this redoubtable name, Margaret trembled, and, torn by conflicting emotions, would have fallen, had she not caught hastily at a massive statue, near which she stood. She instantly recov- ered herself, and said courteously, j "And to what am I indebted for the honor of a visit from the head of the Prussian armies?" The old man looked at her thoughtfully. They still stood in the hall; the door had not been com- pletely closed, and the night breeze, hurrying through it, made the flickering flame of the candles cast an uncertain light upon his tall and stately form. With a sudden movement, he threw aside his cloak, and stood before her in his simple habit of red and black, with the star at his throat--in demeanor a very drill sergeant, or a king; she could jnot determine which! "Madame," said he, "it is indeed most singular that I should have been prompted to call! upon you, and if my conduct were known at the headquarters gen- eral, I might perhaps even be criticised as a too suspicious old man."  Margaret drew herself haughtily nto a niche in the hall.   AN OFFICIAL CALL.       171 ,1 "Graf Von Moltke, I know not, sir, to what you refer; and you must pardon me for saying that I consider your conduct most unwarrantable and as- tonishing." Again the old man half raised his hand, as if to salute; then dropped it with the gesture of one dis- covered, and resumed:- "This, Madame, is a matter into which neither sex nor courtesy enters. For some months past I have had the best of reasons for believing that there cx- isted between the controlling authorities in Paris and the base of operations in the southern sections of France, a line of communication. It is needless to inform you that every precaution has been taken to check this communication, and to bring it to a sudden end; but we have had to deal with a wily enemy - an enemy which never worked in the light." The old man paused for a moment, then lowering his voice, he said, gravely,- "We have traced this matter directly to this house. Strange to say, Madame, the tracing was done by a subaltern in the service, by a major in an infantry regiment. This major had known you in other days, when you were the fairy belle at some town-by-the- sea, at some point on your continent,-- which I do not remember,-and persisted, and still persists, in believing that you are at the bottom of the system  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7012-00000087"/> 172      KENTUCKY'S LO0VE.  of communication. I should be indeed slow to pro- ceed to extreme measures; but so subtle, so mysteri- ous, so comprehensive" (there was no emphasis in his manner, but a terrible emphasis in his words) "has the scheme been, that I have begun to think feminine talent must be concerned therein, and that that fem- inine talent must be actuated by some motive stronger than patriotism, possibly by revenge." Margaret was at her best now. There was some- thing exhilarating, intoxicating, in this grand joust of intellects with the first mover of armies in Europe - the man who could annihilate battalions, and con- centrate whole armies by telegraph; who held in his compact and massive brain the complete map of Europe ; who was a walking topographer; whose head seemed shelved, and ticketed, and labelled, so that he could at will produce any facts he chose; this unpretending schoolmaster of frosty mien, who had the machinery to work with, and who carved Europe according to his will; and she turned upon him with the utmost calmness, saying, simply, "Graf Von Moltke, I do not understand you." His cold eye was fixed upon her. She could not resist his gaze; he seemed possessed of a certain mag- netism which overwhelmed, overawed her. He said nothing, but his manner was crushing. She turned away with great effort; then her gaze came steadily   AN OFFICIAL CALL.       173 and slowly back to his.  She seemed transfixed. As she began to stammer some haughty words, he said, - '"Madame, I am an old man, and I trust an intel- ligent one. I reverence and respect woman, but sooner than see this terrible plan, of which I now know you to be guilty, carried out, I would not hes- itate to crush you and all of yours relentlessly." Still there was no passion in his manner; the eyes gave forth no flame; the lips did not curve, nor the brows wrinkle; but the tone seemed to smite Margaret I  upon her heart. She feared him. Again she staggered, and would have fallen, and she caught, as the hall receded from her, instinctively at his long cloak, which the wind was blowing gently to and fro. lie supported her, and she recovered; but all her self-possession had now left her. A strange and wild feeling of surrender came over her. She longed to throw herself at the feet of this impassive statue, and to tell it she was guilty; that w she had done a wrong; that she had mingled in what did not concern her. Then came the woman's pride; and with an effort which almost broke her heart- strings, she ground her teeth together. She closed her eyes, that she might resist the power of that ter-  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7012-00000088"/> 174      KErNTrUCKY'S LOVE.           , rible gaze, and she said calmly, coolly, and very sar- castically,               .  "Graf Von Moltke will pardon me i I again say that I do not understand him ; that, had it not been for the sudden arrival of his hussars in Versailles early in September, I should now have been quietly housed in New York, plotting no more than does the ordinary society woman, and thinking of nothing so little as of the carpet struggle here, in which yo are obeying the ambition of tottering dynasties. R ally, sir, this is a case of mistaken identity; there has been a great error committed. As to the major of whom you speak, I have not the honor of his present acquaint- ance. I have met your countrymen in my own land, but I do not remember to have been honored at any time with a presentation to the major of, any Prussian military organization. May I beg, since my father is very ill, and requires my almost constant attention, to be excused for the present? May I Sven say that I desire to speak no further upon this subject with any one belonging to the service of his majesty King William-? May I make bold to state that whatever Graf Von Moltke has to communicate with me here- after should be communicated in writing? And- good evening."  She was gone, and a moment afterwards the street door closed. A stern old man strode up the avenue, , I   AN OFFICIAL CALL.       175 looking neither to right nor left, and only saluting mechanically a party of officers roytering homeward at an undue hour. After he had gone, Margaret sat down by her fa- ther's bed, and while the invalid continued his usual meanings and cryings for assistance which he really did not need, she tried to reflect upon this strange visit, and could not reconcile the sudden arrival and strange demeanor of the impassive Moltke with his unguarded and frank manner. "How," she said to herself a dozen times, "can it be, that he, whose movements are usually kept totally in the dark, has for once unmasked himself, and ac- corded fair play? Nothing could be easier than for him to expel me from the lines; nothing easier than for him to declare me suspect, and to banish me beyond the reach of conspiring and conspirators. Then came the terrible thought--but he does not wish to do that; he wishes not only to lay his hand upon me as the principal culprit, but to entangle all the others." Could there have been anything found upon the body of the dead Regnier to indicate the extent of her scheme?  She would not believe that, and set herself vigorously to imagining what move on the part of the Prussian authorities was now most probable.  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7012-00000089"/> 17'6     KENTUCIY'S LO E.  She could decide nothing; uncertainty followed uncertainty so rapidly that she became confused, and finally, in despair, busied herself with her duty to her father, and let the whole scheme drop as completely out of her mind as if she had never conceived it.   COCOON EXPLAINS.       1" CHAPTER XIII. COCOON EXPLAINS. WHEN  Cocoon returned, Kentucky and I were at the Bohemian Club, and as we re-entered the house, we found him sound asleep in his chair, with a look of mingled mute pleasure and despair upon his face. He had not been dreaming; the dream- less look was on him; utter oblivion had passed over him, and swallowed him up in its depths; but the im- press of the interview remained upon his features. Kentucky wakened him  rudely; he struck him smartly upon the back, and said, "Cocoon, what is the result?" Whereupon Master Cocoon partially awoke to his senses, shook himself like a Newfoundland dog, and responded, with considerable acerbity, - "What's the row?" This generic Anglo-Saxon demand convinced us that Cocoon's soul had not been overwrought, and we made bold with cheery voice to say,- 12  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7012-00000090"/> 178    A  KENTUCKY 'S LOVE. "Precisely; that is what we desired to know. What is the row?" It was nearly midnight. Kentucky had lighted his huge pipe, sat down in a low chair facing Cocoon, and seemed waiting anxiously for an answer to his some- what indifferent question. No answer, however, came up from the depths of Cocoon's consciousness, and Kentucky surveyed first the sleepy man, then my wakeful self, with humorous grimness. After his mi- nute survey was finished, he departed clangorously into his room. His door was slammed, and we saw him no more that night. Then Cocoon told me the story as I have told it to you. When he had finished, he looked at me anx- iously, and said, "Now, do you think we had better tell this to Kentucky?" It was a hard struggle, but finally Cocoon won me. I simply said, in response to his nervous question,- "No; it is best that Kentucky should not know it. This woman has been actuated by a worthy impulse in telling you so much of her history. I suspend all judgment upon your future, and upon hers, until I know more of her." "Thank you," he said, with such a grace and friendliness that my heart warmed towards him. After all, I thought to myself, this is not a weak man. Ladies of old sent their knights upon missions more   COCOON EXPLAINS.       179 i  dangerous than any he can undertake, and I am not u   sure that his heroism is not greater than any of which Kentucky and myself might-be capable. AI   When I arose to retire, I bade him good night heart- ily, and with more content than I had felt during our whole sojourn around siege-stricken Paris. I was awake at early dawn, faithful at my post of observation at the high window, when a new episode arrived in the shape of the tall, precise man-servant from Margaret's mansion. He was paler than his wont, his attire was disordered, and his eyes had a fur- tive expression which was disagreeable. I met him on the stairs; he was hurtling up, three at a bound, to Cocoon's room. "What do you wish?"I said. "Monsieur Cocoon, with your permission," he an- swered, politely. "Ah, well," I said, "I fancy he is still sleeping; he went to bed late." The man-servant looked at me suspiciously. "It matters little, sir," he said. "If he is sleeping, we must wake him. I have important orders from my mistress to see him at once." "Indeed!"I said; "and who, may I make bold to demand, is your mistress?" But the man-servant did not answer. He bolted  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7012-00000091"/> 180      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. past me on the stairs, and, fifteen minutes after, Co- coon, faultlessly dressed,--for a wonder, for he was the most negligent of men,- descended the stairs with him, and set off at a rapid pace for the white mansion in the avenue. Of course, I was surprised and curious. There was no refuge left me, save to wander into Kentucky's room, wake that worthy individual by a vigorous shake of the shoulder, and to say,- "Cocoon has gone to his fate again." "A A-  Cocoon - mysterious lady -has he?- who cares?" said Kentucky, sleepily. "Mind you, I was dreaming of the Champigny fight. Don't bother me." And he turned his great shoulder against me. No consolation was to be had there; so I set off for a brisk walk in the avenue. At this early morning hour but few people were abroad, but I was sur- prised to see the chancellor of Prussia, his Excel- lency Count Von Bismarck, rattling away towards the gate of the city in a little carriage, drawn by two shaggy Shetland ponies, his huge form  looming up above the figures of the shaggy beasts like that of some giant drawn in the carriage of a Cinder- ella fairy. He was dressed in the uniform of his own regiment, the Bismarck Cuirassiers. His white cap, with the yellow band, set off to rare advantage his massive, sternly-drawn, commanding face, with the   AN OFFICIAL CALL.       181 grizzled mustache, and the unkempt growth of whis- ker at his chin. His mouth was shut with a lip-gesture of fearful import. He seemed either meditating the contents of some ferocious diplomatic circular, or about to indulge in one of his many quarrels with Moltke or the king. I looked anxiously at him as I passed,hop- ing for the accustomed bow (for the Prussians had caught from the cheery French, whose politeness no stain of disaster could tarnish, some hint of their wonted courtesy and regard); but he made no motion. lHe saw me, glowered at me sullenly, seemed to cry to the coachman to whip up, and away they rattled over the cobble-stones, until a whirl around the corner of the street carried them into the Rue Neuve, and I lost sight of them. "Something has gone wrong," I said. "The chan- cellor is usually in bed at this hour, dictating dip- lomatic circulars, and drinking champagne. Can it be possible that some disaster has come upon us?" I returned towards the house, more anxious than ever before for the safety of Cocoon, yet at the same time silently questioning whether or not Kentucky and I had the moral right to inter- fere in a matter now clearly in the domain of love; whether we were the asses, and Cocoon was the sage, or vice versa. When I returned to IMadame Varlin's, Kentucky was awake, vigorously sketching on a piece  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7012-00000092"/> 182    K- ENTUCKY'S L OVE. of prepared paper a map of an imaginary fight; and when I told him the story of Cocoon's sudden depart- ure, he only answered with a careless "I-umph!"I was angry, and I said to him, "It is very well for you to affect this sudden disregard of the interests of our friend Cocoon, and I have been questioning myself, on the way home, whether or not we strictly had the right to interfere in the young man's affairs of the heart; but, as I once told Cocoon himself, my instincts are always right, and I am afraid that he is in danger." Kentucky looked- up from his map, took his pipe from his mouth, blew a tremendous cloud of smoke, and answered, quietly, - "Of course he is; of course he is." "Well," I said, "what do you propose to do?" Kentucky answered nothing, but blew another cloud. "And you listen with equanimity," s id I, u to the statement that he has gone to meet the mysterious lady again, after his visit of last night? /You merely listen, knowing the danger you feared for him, and warned him against?" "Yes," said Kentucky; "but I am taking my pre- cautions. Do not worry me, I beg of you. I have this map to draw; I have an interview with a grand duke, and a visit to pay to the Bohemian Club before noon. In fact," he added, "my funds are running rather low, and I have contracted an engagement with   ;s .1      ANg OFFICIAL CALE.      183 183 a New York newspaper. I have extraordinary facil- ities for obtaining information, and they have prom- ised to pay me well. There; I am busy; so please to vanish." I vanished, readily.  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7012-00000093"/> 184      KENT UCKY'S LO VE. CHAPTER XIV. THE TALISMAN. N a crisp morning in January, shortly after the mysterious visit of the chief of the Prussian armies to Margaret's mansion, Margaret herself strolled into the great park, to one of its farthest nooks, where two avenues run up to form an angle embowered in trees - charming enough in summer, bleak in winter. She had been undergoing a severe struggle between her own passionate desire for vengeance and her womanly instincts, which told her that she was about to draw one who dearly loved her into imminent dan- ger. She took off her gloves, as she walked along with face uplifted to catch the morning breeze, and twisted her hands angrily together, as if endeavoring to wring from them some solution of what was really a painful problem. Cocoon was entrapped; there was no longer any doubt of that. He had now seen her motives fobr remaining at Versailles; he knew the whole tragedy; he would do for her whatever she might ask. IS   :ti           TIE TALISMAN.       185 [/ , Eic "After all," she said, lightly, to herself, "need there be any danger? Is not this a mission which any clever man might accomplish?"Then she paused, and re- membered that the mission was invested with new danger every day; that she and all surrounding her were watched by more than Argus eyes, and could be beaten to earth by more than Briarean hands. Was not Cocoon already suspected? Were there no spies at that moment upon her track? Was she not inevita- bly caught and tangled in the toils, so that if she tried to go on, she would not only drag down herself, but J    all around her, doing infinite harm, instead of good, to the French arms? Discovery of her present scheme would be almost fatal to Paris. By withdrawing, instantly and forever, from that scheme, could she not avoid the discovery she so much feared? She wandered on, turning neither to right nor left, thinking wearily and sternly upon the importance of her design, when, on reaching an angle by the corner of a path, she saw face to face with her, Master Co- tI   coon! The foul fiend himself must have sent him, because Margaret had made no appointment with him, and did not even desire to see him again until the decisive mo- ment when she needed his assistance. There, how- !   ever, he was, alert and active, with eyes filled with I   love, and with a confidence that plainly said, "Ready for duty, at your service, Madame."  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7012-00000094"/> l(8f     KENTUCKY'S LO VOE. Margaret did not speak to him first. She opened her great eyes, gravely, and still toying with her two white hands, looked at him so earnestly that he finally stammered, - ' Margaret, I knew that you were coming, and I could not help following you; may I walk with you?" "Certainly," she said. They walked on together, much as they had on that first snowy day when Cocoon had told her the story of the locket. The great trees seemed to bend their bare branches over them as in benediction. It was a hap- pily assorted pair, as the old English surgeon had said one day. Cocoon, so tall, so graceful, so manly withal; Margaret, so winning, so confiding, so perfect in form; and there was a certain magnetism in both their faces which strongly impressed all who saw them together. Each of the faces seemed always to have a pure wind from the sea blowing across it. There was a touch of what the French call the exalte, a bit of inspiration sent, one hardly knew whence, to chasten, and thrill, and lighten all the features. They walked on for some distance, saying but little, when Cocoon suddenly stopped, and, placing one hand upon Margaret's shoulder, said qui'etly,-- "Do you know, Margaret, that I did not tell Ken- tucky what you told me concerning your mission of vengeance."   Ig:           THE T4ALIS MAN.       1 187 She looked up at him with a pleased, fluttering laugh -a laugh which smote strangely upon his heart. For the first time it seemed to him as if she were ex- ulting over him, because he was gained to her purpose, because he had done, unwittingly, what she would wittingly have willed, and it startled him. A shadow of pain came over his face; he withdrew his hand from her shoulder, and said, in a changed tone,- "Was I wrong?" "No," she said; "I do not know that Kentucky can do us any good. Besides, you know that he has de- clared me war, because, forsooth, he was inclined to believe that I was endeavoring to entrap you into some wild scheme, some harebrained mission, which would culminate in disaster to you, and overwhelm both you and his love for you, which I admit is great." "But why," said Cocoon, hastily, "need Kentucky have such suspicions?" "I don't know," she answered, sweetly, looking up into his face. "Margaret," he said, speaking very gently, in a low voice, "is it possible that I could assist you in this scheme?" I  -Here he stopped. He expected to see some demon- stration of surprise on her part, but he saw none. She said quite timidly, almost gayly, "And how, pray, could you serve me, without vio- lating your neutrality?"  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7012-00000095"/> 188   i  KENTUCKY'S LOVE.  "I don't know," he said, sighing. "I only know  that there is a fate overhanging all this matter. I only know that that fate seemed to lay its hand upon me in the wood of Enghien when your picture was given into my hand--that picture which you had given the spy as the only memorial of his dead brother;  -that same picture which was found upon the body of  Charles Regnier when he was shot dead at Newport; that same picture which I wish, Margaret" (here his voice faltered), "you would give to me, as you gave it  to the dead spy, as a talisman, and a seal, and a pledge of duty; and I would serve you faithfully, earnestly, asking no reward save your own dear self-if fortune should so favor -" All this seems inexpressibly sad to me now; the poor boy wrote it note by note, verbatim et literatim, with terrible sincerity and memory of love, in his diary, and when he went away, bequeathed that diary to me. It is a history of weakness if you will, but intrinsically a history of the heart. Without answering his request, Margaret turned with him, and began to walk slowly down the long alley. Cocoon hung his head, and said no word. lIe was musing deeply on the toils in which he now seemed j entangled beyond hope; and over him hung the shadow of a giant fear, which cruelly affrighted him. Margaret  led the way, and the youthful pair soon mounted the   THE TALISMAN.        189 broad avenue which led towards the palace, and, wandering among the statues, came to the entrance of the great court-yard, in which a few wounded Prussians, clad in coarse long coats, and flat, red-banded caps, were dragging their weary limbs about, and sunning themselves. They had strayed nearly as far as the gateway bpening upon the Place d'Armes, and passed beneath the statue of Chevalier Bayard, when Mar- garet said, "Let us go and see the wouhded." Through the long corridors, on whose walls hung portraits of heroes and monarchs, and which seemed but one glittering record of the perishing nature of that once proud boast, "all the glories of France," roamed the stalwart officer with his flat cap held reverently in his hand, now bowing before the bedside of some fevered soldier, whose delirious dreams were of the "iron cross," or of some grand assault upon the historic forts near by, or now cynically surveying through his spectacles foreign nurses and attendants clad either in the black robes of the Sisters of Charity, or in the prim and precise uniforms of the American Sanitary Corps. Little groups of cheerful, yet rever- ent-faced men paused here and there at the bedside of some poor fellow with an ugly rent in his thigh, or only a fragmentary scalp, and hovering so lightly be. tween life and death, that his stay below could not be long. Now and then the sharp voice of some Prussian  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7012-00000096"/> 190   KENTUCKY'S LOVE. doctor, ordering an attendant here and there, broke the silence, which was never otherwise interfered with,  save by irregular breathings of the sick, and the cau- tious tread of footsteps. As Cocoon and Margaret entered the long hall, from which many of the pictures had been removed, and the floors of which had been spread with carpets, that the slightest noise might be avoided, they came upon a host of officers, who had come out of one of the recent fights dangerously  wounded, and many of whom were at the point of  death. After a brief discussion at the door with a surly attendant, who seemed by some instinct to recog-  nize Margaret as a suspected person, and to desire to ; accord her no favors, they passed quietly, noiselessly  up one of the middle aisles, along which were arranged - little cots, and presently arrived at a recess, with the  window opening upon the lawn of the gardens beyond. g In this recess two officers of high rank were standing,  and beside them {as a physician earnestly represent-  ing in a whisper his views of a certain desperate case.  "The man cannot live long," he said; "he has been  shot through the body; and, although he persists in asserting that the ball has been found, and that the wound has not touched a vital part, I am convinced  that it is but of little avail. He is sinking rapidly now, and is delirious. It will be next to impossible to  offer any hope."    ITE TALISMAN        191 Whether impelled  by morbid curiosity, or by some subtle movement of the web of fate now so rapidly enveloping them, Cocoon and Margaret pressed forward, and looked into the recess. On a low cot-bed lay the form of a handsome young Prus- sian, blue-eyed, blond-mustachioed, his comely limbs disordered with the, agony which had passed over them, and his face pale as though death had already sealed him for its own. Margaret gave one swift look, then uttered an involuntary cry, like that of a wounded animal at bay, which suddenly finds that it has over- come its enemies, and is at last safe. It was a cry of savage exultation, and it rang in Cocoon's ears with painful emphasis for many a day afterwards. It was loud and bitter, and the two officers stepped back with instinctive politeness, thinking, possibly, that some friend might havecome to recognize the young man in his dire extremity. Margaret would have lowered her veil, but ere she could accomplish this swift disguise, the form upon the bed seemed electrified; the blue eyes, which before had been simply fixed in the glassy stare of pain, now assumed life and vigor, and looked in the direction whence had come the cry. All this transpired in a moment; that moment sufficed to show Cocoon a glance of recognition, swift as lightning, between Mar- garet and the officer. Then the blue eyes closed; 3;  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7012-00000097"/> 192    KENTUCKY'S LOVE. there V  a convulsive movement of the limbs, and the doctor hastened to the bedside saying, hurriedly, turning to cast one more glance upon the distort ed forn in the recess. She saw the figure half rise in bed with a treatenin g attitude; she heard a weak, but determined voice cry, fieroely-.

He wandered blindly whithersoever Margaret would, and they passed up fight after flight of steps, knowing little and caring less where they went, until at last, after what seemed to Cocoon march, they came upo the great rof of the palaoe, n of steps, and it 1,41   THE TALISMANA.       193 with its labyrinth of alley-ways and miniature streets, its sculptured balconies and cornices. Before them lay spread, sparkling in the crisp winter atmosphere, re- splendent with statues and snow-covered bosquets, the superb park, animated here and there with figures of scarlet-clothed horsemen, riding furiously hither and yon, or with the swaggering, portly forms of heavy officers, clanking their sabres, and rattling their spurs, as they tramped over the frozen ground. Cocoon felt inexpressibly relieved to be once more in the open air; and, gently detaching Margaret's arm from his, he leaned over the balcony, and drew a long breath, say- ing, almost involuntarily,- "That was a horrible sight below; let us forget it. My heart beats like a trip-hammer; my brain seems on fire. Margaret, what can it mean? We must ban- ish it from our minds, and think of pleasanter things." "But, Cocoon," she said gently, yet firmly, "we cannot forget it. I cannot banish it from my mind. It has a terrible significance for me." Then lowering her voice, sweetly and softly she murmured, - "If I were in great danger, do you think you would aid me, Cocoon?" "I have already given you an answer, Margaret. What I have said in the park sufficed to tell you." The light morning breeze came fanning the temples of the young pair; lifted the hair through which a 13  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7012-00000098"/> 194      KENTUCKY'S L O VE. Y gleam of winter sunshine played upon Margaret's brow, caressed it lightly, toyed with it coquettishy,  and stirred the blue ribbon at her throat. A curious pallor overspread her features; her eyes were lumi-  nous, and had a far-away, yet introspective look, which made them almost divine. Gradually her whole ex- pression softened; she gazed at Cocoon tenderly, lov- ingly, for a moment; then she lowered her eyes, and, looking down upon the naked statue which rejoiced in  the sunlight half a mile away, said, musingly,-  i "You have asked me, Cocoon, for the picture which the dead spy gave you in the woods at Enghien. I think I will give it to you now." She detached from her neck, by a sudden and grace- . i ful movement, a slender chain, delicately fashioned  with links of pure gold, representing heads of antique  goddesses and Fates, and handed it to Cocoon. Fas- tened to it was the coveted locket, concealed in a tiny case of Russia leather. Cocoon grasped it, leaned . over towards Margaret, and said, softly,-  "I accept whatever of bitterness or of joy it may bring; and now, Margaret, I am yours, all yours, for- evermore." A fresh breeze blew from off the long canal in the  great park. It brought with it icy cold, which seemed to chill the young pair to the marrow of their bones. In the distance, they could hear the naked boughs   THE TALSMAN        195 195 sighing and moaning their interequiem  Scornful laughter bubbled up to their ears from the gateways of the chateau.

CHAPTER XV. KENTUCKY "PURSUIT.  T was late at night, and the lights of the Rue des  I  Reservoirs were nearly all extinguished. Only the Cafe de Neptune remained open, and from its  door came hilarious outhursts, in noisy German ac- cents. Every few moments some extempore wagon, driven by a shivering French carter, shrouded in his gray cloak, stopped before the door of the huge cafe, and from it descended a dozen officers, clad in gala costume, who rushed tumultuously into the door, and were heard crying loudly for beer and wine. In- side, the waiters ran madly to and fro, bearing glasses of the foamy liquid made at Sevres, to be served  up to the relentless conquerors' maws; and the sharp, quick curses of the Prussians were mingled with the  softer tones of the old lady who sat at the counter, tears in her eyes, listening vaguely to the thunderous  melody of the cannon-shots in the distance,    i It was New Year's Eve, and the Germans were    KENTUCKY IN PURSUIT.      197 celebrating vehemently and joyously. Hundreds of officers had received furloughs, and had come into the headquarters for riot and wassail. Here and there little groups were scattered in the long drinking-room, gravely and quietly talking of home and friends, and of the possible chances of the morrow; but the majority of the new comers were hastily pouring beer down their throats, and ferociously smoking. In a room at the farther end of the hall a group of officers of high rank were just attacking their third bowl of punch; and as the great bells of the city solemnly told the'hour of twelve, every German in the room arose, and, holding his glass high above his head, pronounced, in stentorian tones, the good old motto,- Prosit neue jahr. At this moment a tremendous double-shotted vol- ley broke through the clear air, and rang out in triumph, rejoiced, and growled, and howled, until it seemed as if demons had been let loose in the air. The Germans paused, breathless, with glasses at their lips, and hands upon their sword-belts, and listened intently. One, two, three, four, - the sonorous re- ports rang forth, until twelve had been sounded, and the invaders knew that the Gaul, behind his breast- works, had not forgotten his customary gallantry. There was a spice of sarcasm and a hint of ter- rible defiance in that salute to the New Year,  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7012-00000100"/> 198      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. fired from Valerien's Heights. It was not merely a salute; it was a blind outcry, full of rage; the moan of some creature at bay; a strangled,    i semi-articulate prayer for aid, or a threat of ven- geance!  In a moment the Germans had recovered their equanimity, and, draining their glasses, as they sat down, made trifling remarks concerning the frivolity of the Frenchmen; then began joyfully singing carols and catches, immemorial in the quaint villages and obscure cities whence they had come. Then the win- dows of the great hotel opposite flew open; lights appeared here and there; gruff voices cried out,-  I Prosit neuejahr.  The windows were as suddenly closed afterwards,  and all was still once more.  Cocoon and I were wandering slowly up the street,  when all this effusive and jocund noise over the ad- vent of the New Year greeted our ears. But there was little of joyousness in our hearts, for on that very night Cocoon was to undertake a mission from which ' I could not dissuade him, but which seemed to me  fraught with deadliest danger. I had tried to restrain  him by every means in my power f I had ridiculed him, cajoled him, tried to shame him from his roman- tic, and, to me, false idea of duty; but he would not shake or waver. ,    KENTUCKY IN PURSUIT.       199 This is substantially the story which he told me, as we walked in the frozen ruts of the great street that New Year's night. He was indeed exalte, poor boy; possibly the flush of champagne which he had drank at the Bohemian Club had added to his fervor; 'but his tall form swayed to and fro gracefully in the darkness; his gestures were nervous and impressive; and his eyes had the " inward Delphian look " which Leigh Hunt gave to the orbs of poor John Keats. He was a " pretty figure of a boy," as a French nurse- maid once said; and even the majesty of his curling beard, his snowy brow, and his firm walk, could not take away the impress of youth, which still lingered about him; but his face was so mobile, that the love which he bore for Margaret was already impressed upon it. It flavored his life; it usurped his soul; it was crumbling the very foundations of his being. After we had paced up and down for some minutes, stopping now and then to listen to the rattling noise from the forts, he paused near the portal of the great hotel, and said, - "Well, old fellow, we came home then, but we took a roundabout way.  We walked back through the long alley in the park, where, as you remember, on a cold but sunshiny day, not so very long ago, I delivered into the hands of the mysterious lady this locket."  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7012-00000101"/> 200      KENTUCKY'S LO VE.,  He showed it to me almost reluctantly. My heart was numb with a sudden fear. Then I reproached  myself for being womanish, and for meddling with what did not concern me; and I said, quietly, - "So, then, Margaret is yours?" "Not so," he answered, gently; "this is a seal and  a pledge of duty, and, I trust, a talisman. O, my best of friends, bear with me patiently, and do not think me foolish. You, who know the history of this woman's would-be vengeance,-you, who know how  she has bound me in her thrall, -know how willingly I wear the fetter she has thrown around me; how eagerly I will execute her bidding, whatever it may be!" At this juncture I felt uncomfortable, and inclined to despise Cocoon; but, suddenly re-enforcing myself, I said, tranquilly, - "And may I know what the bidding of the mys- terious lady is?" "Yes," he said; "and it will comfort your timorous soul to know that there is no great danger closely  allied with it. Perhaps I am stupid for telling you; and yet you are so bound up in this strange enterprise  that - that I must."  He paused, and took off his hat; his brow was bathed in sweat; his eyes gleamed almost ferociously. "I will carry this out to the uttermost," he said.  1   KENTUCKY IN PURSUIT.      201 "I like it. It puts a fever in my blood that I have not felt for many a day. Now at last I am indeed doing something; no longer drawing idle lines on silly paper; but here is a deed to do, a work to con- summate, and I think it is worth while to do it." He looked at me almost angrily, as if daring me to doubt his sincerity.. "At early morning, old boy, I am to leave you. A close carriage will await me here." "Here," I said, "in front of this door? And what on earth can you accomplish by leaving Versailles at a suspicious hour of the night in a close carriage? You will be arrested before you have passed the first sentinel." "Pooh! pooh!" said Cocoon, laughing. "On the contrary, Sir Doubter, I have a soldier of the line as driver. All the passports are arranged, and with two good horses and no impediments, we shall be at Lagny, at the rear, do you mind, before breakfast." I was indeed puzzled. "Then," he continued, "when I am at the rear, I shall take the first military train that leaves Lagny for Epernay. When I am at Epernay, I shall take the first train for Strasbourg. When I am at Stras- bourg, I shall await the first train for Frajnkfort; arrived at Frankfort, I shall not delay in getting to the Belgian frontier. From Brussels I shall go to Calais.'  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7012-00000102"/> 202      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. "And from Calais, whither?"I said, breathlessly. "To London," he answered. "There I have busi- ness of importance: that once consummated, the real peril of the mission begins. I shall return through  France, and I shall make the best of my way - how, I know not, but I shall certainly do it - to the French lines opposite St. Cloud." He paused, looked at me hard for a moment, then burst into a loud laugh, which had a slight tinge of hysteric in it; but I could perceive nothing of heroism, or even of bravado. I trembled. "I don't know," said I, "that I have any right to attempt to dissuade you from this apparently simple journey to London, but I humbly beg and pray that you will not attempt to cross from one line to the other. You are certain to be caught, and quite as likely to be shot. Some fellow will swear that you have descended from a balloon, or that you are a clever spy in disguise, no matter on which side you are taken, and it will be short shrift, my boy, short shrift! Your American passports will be against you! and the news you will carry will be of a most compromising nature." I He took no heed, apparently, of what I said, but  continued in the same quiet manner,- - "If I succeed in getting through the lines towards   KENTUCKY IN PURSUIT.       203 Paris, I have still another danger to incur, for I must come back to Versailles, and from Versailles I must make my way towards Orleans." Again he paused, and once more I looked at him in breathless wonder. "And what, in Heaven's name," said I, "are you to do at Orleans? Are you trying to take news fron Paris to the Southern armies?" "Yes," he said, with the old hysterical laugh. "Then farewell, Cocoon," said I, solemnly, "for henceforth, my boy, you are written in my book as a dead man. You will reach London safely; you may traverse the lines; I know not what subtle contrivance the mysterious lady has devised; and I know well that her will and her ingenuity are great; but you will never reach the Southern armies while Prussia holds Paris surrounded with a triple circle of iron and of. fire!" Cocoon merely answered scornfully, in Hamlet's words, - "We defy augury; there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be Gnot now, it will come. BEe ordains; the readiness is all; since no man, of aught he leaves, knows, what is to leave be- times? Let be." Then, a moment afterwards, he repeated the line  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7012-00000103"/> 204      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. which had struck the German soldiers with such force  when Kentucky had read it to them at Enghien:-  "For who can shun the chance that destiny doth or- dain? "  There was nothing further to be said; his mind was made up. He might be mad; but he was not to be dissuaded. "Now," said he, briskly, " bid me good night; get to your bed, and sleep only to wake when I am in Lagny, or, possibly, rolling away on the first military train towards Epernay." I bade him good night like a hypocrite, for I had no intention of going to bed. I went to my room, wrapped myself in a huge cloak, stole down the long stairs, and promenaded on the square until two o'clock, when I saw a carriage drive noisily up to the door of the great hotel. Cocoon got into it, and it rattled away in the direction of the gate out of which the road led towards Lagny. I was sleepless, and remained for some time in the square. Something impelled me to seek relief in the open air. I felt that I should stifle if I returned and lay down to rest. As I was just about deciding to re- enter the house, after half an hour's wandering in the square, I heard the noise of a second carriage's wheels. I walked quietly towards the side of the street, passed the hotel, saw a carriage draw up just as it was ascend-    KENTUCKY IN PURSUIT.      205 ing the hill towards the palace, and heard a familiar voice, which sent a thrill through me, cry to the soldier in sharp, well-accented German,-- ' Make haste, for we cannot miss that early train for Epernay. It shall be money in your fist, comrade, if you reach Lagny before sunrise." The voice was Kentucky's. : So, then, he was on the track.      " I went home to bed, comforted now, and slept soundly.  t      !    %   &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7012-00000104"/> 206      KENTUCK Y'S LOVE. CHAPTER   XVI.  THE TELL-TALE PAPER.  THE   carriage rolled rapidly through the black  night, past sentries, whose suspicious glare was  instantly mollified by the prompt producing of un-  equivocal papers; past long lines of houses,-  "all their crowded ills Thick at the staring windows," - houses in which grimy and muddy soldiery were re- posing before fires built out of palings and furniture;  past great parks of artillery, watched over by fatigued  and sleepy sentinels; down steep hills, the thick mud spattering the carriage sides as the fresh horses plunged furiously forward; along deep-cut valleys, over  which a shrouding mist hung weirdly; along level plains, from which, in daytime, one could catch a  glimpse of the siege-stricken capital, with its hundred domes and spires, and through little patches of wood, where the road wound in and out among the great trees, and where the bodies of dead horses, with their   THE TELL-TALE PAPER.      207 throats cut, lay stark and stiff, in the night, the great eyes of the animals staring straight up, with horrib:e, ghastly stupor, into the infinite blackness. From time to time Kentucky moved restlessly in his seat, pressed his hand convulsively to his forehead, on which drops of sweat stood beaded, and leaned forward, as if he would go faster than the horses could carry him, in pursuit of the foolish youth who was flying towards a Fate which would be cruel to him. The soldier drove rapidly and recklessly; and now and then Kentucky was obliged to thrust his head out of the window, and warn the tyro Jehu not to upset the pursuer of Cocoon into an ignominious mud-hole. On and on they sped, through the black night, Ken- tucky's heart ,knocking like a trip-hammer against his ribs; his brain one wild whirl of desire and appeal to Providence; his senses alert and active; his body in- fused with a new vigor which surprised him, and his hands hot with the intensity of his will. By and by they rattled down to the bridge at Villeneuve St. Georges, and there a long and scrambling parley en- sued between the weary sentinels and the occupants of the carriage. What is the matter at Versailles? they said; had any bad news been received? for another carriage had just gone hurtling over the bridge; somebody bearing important despatches, they believed.  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7012-00000105"/> 208      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. "How long ago?"Kentucky asked, breathlessly. Didn't know; perhaps half an hour; they were not there to be bullied with questions. Had the gentle- man any cigars? With a muttered expression savoring of a curse, Kentucky sprang back to his carriage, when the for- malities were adjusted, and they rattled over the stream, and away once more. By and by they came into a sheltered part of the road, where even the great wheels of the artillery had not softened the fro- zen ground, and where, in the solid ruts, the carriage banged about like a rudderless ship at sea. Another remonstrance with the driver. The only  response was a thunderous German oath, and the an- swer, "' If I don't break your neck, I will get you there  for the train, comrade."  On through the black night, now and then passing a  soldier-shepherd, picturesque in his long cloak and flat  cap, using his gun for a pastoral crook, and leading I behind him a thousand weary and muddy sheep, trem- bling with cold, and bleating bitterly, as they were marched up to be slaughtered for the conquerors;  meeting long lines of forage wagons, with squalid Ba- varians, their helmets jammed over their eyes, croon- ing lewd songs or catches of rustic melody, as they urged forward their weary steeds; past an ambulance, with a cheery English voice crying to the horses to   THE TELL-TALE PAPER.      209 "Get on, now;" past the rapidly rolling imperial cou- rier's wagon, with a huge, white-coated, jack-booted courier, sitting moodily, his arms folded, crammed into a corner of his vehicle; past a cart, with half a dozen wounded soldiers from the last skirmish, groaning and crying as they jolted onward; past a solitary horseman, stationed at the corner of a road, with one hand upon his carbine, and the other on his bridle-rein, with the white fiost gathered on his long mustache and on his curly hair; past the brilliantly- lighted headquarters of some general, newly arrived, who, at the principal villa of a little village, was feast- ing his subalterns, and drinking the champagne and red-wine taken from the cellars of the vanquished; past an old church which had been converted into a hospital, and from which a sombre procession of gloomy soldiers wee silently carrying, through the darkness, the body of one of their dead comrades; past the long, swaying lines of telegraph poles, painted black and white, and guarded here and there by vigilant watchmen; past the ruined chateau, with shell-holes in its roof; past a hundred little straw- thatched wardrobes, turned into sentry-boxes, and out of which grim warriors started suddenly, as they heard the rumble of carriage wheels; past a weary family of famished French, slowly groping their way to beg rations of the Prussians; past some strange, "  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7012-00000106"/> 210      KENTUCK Y'S LOVE. mysterious figure, clad in tattered and bespattered garments, which sprang up into the night, affrighted at the noise, and then vanished like a vision; on, and on, and on, the great war panorama shifting every moment, Kentucky never relaxing for an instant his  gaze; out into the darkness, which now began to be  tinged with the promise of the dawn.  The promise of the dawn! It smote through Ken-  tucky's soul with inspiring joy; it put new life and I renewed vigor into his frame. At last he said, "We  are nearing Lagny, and we must overtake them, for we have driven like the wind. If their carriage would only break down!" But no broken-down carriage presented itself to Kentucky's straining eyes; and as they rolled on to  another road, which even the winter wear and tear had not been able to convert into a series of ruts and puddles, Kentucky took a night lamp from his breast pocket, and unfolding the slender case which held it, lit it, and fastened it to the side of his carriage. Then' he took from his travelling bag a huge note-book, so arranged with buckles and straps, that when he had fastened a hook to a rib in the carriage roof, the book hung suspended before him, so that he had a kind of swinging desk, which moved as the carriage moved, and on which, when he heavily placed his arm, he could write. Then he began busily to jot down a   a ;      ETHE TELL-TALE PAPER.     2" hasty diary in short-hand, and so occupied himself until the dawn fulfilled its promise, and a cold, gray morning woke up, to look down with relentless bit- terness upon the scene of devastation and sorrow which the siege circle hemmed in. At last the coachman urged his horses forward with a furious oath and a crack of his long whip, and the carriage rattled fiercely into the crooked streets of Lagny. Kentucky hastily put away his diary (which he did not fail to keep during the long journey, and which he afterwards gave to me), and began to arrange himself for a hasty exit from the vehicle. The coach- man cried, cheerily, No train has gone yet; there are too many soldiers about. We are in time; and you won't forget the drink money?" "No," said Kentucky; "drive on; ten thalers for you if you are at the station in time." And they rat- tled into the yard of the station ten minutes after. Kentucky was on the platform in a moment, with his cloak thrown over his shoulder, and his travelling bag in his hand. He threw the money which he had pre- pared for the coachman into the hand held greedily out, and rushed into the hall which the railway mil- itary official had chosen for his office. Was there a train this morning? Who was the gentleman, and what did he want? So Kentucky, perforce, submitted to the tedious  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7012-00000107"/> 212      KENTUCK Y'S LOVE.' formalities of identification, and, after ten minutes of sober reflection, the official vouchsafed him the right to a parley.                    ( Yes, there was a train. Then would the official kindly give him author- ization to travel on it as far as it went that day?  Yes; but the train had already gone.  Kentucky threw down his bag and his cloak, and : stared in blank, dumb amazement at the official.    The train had already gone, said Kentucky; but ! he thought that it didl not go until sunrise.    : Right, the official answered, touching his hat; but  the sun had already risen, although he had not shown ; his face, an hour ago; and the train was twenty miles away. Was there no other that forenoon; no means of getting to Epernay; no communication of any kind?  None until next morning; and (suspiciously) why was the gentleman in such haste? Kentucky took from his pocket a letter sealed with a ducal seal, and imposing with a variety of German scrawl.  The face of the official softened, and his eyes bright- ened. Was the gentleman then an agent? Kentucky bowed, and gravely tapped the great envelope. The official inspected it. It was the name of a noble duke, and the German handed it back   THE TELL-TALE TPAPER.      213 timorously, saying that he regretted a thousand times that the gentleman had arrived too late; but could he not proceed in his carriage as far as Epernay, and thus save the day? Kentucky reflected; then he asked, were there any passengers from Versailles by this train this morning? Yes, the official answered, doubtingly ; a tall young man with a black beard; a handsome fel- low, even more hasty than this gentleman, and who could "hardly wait for the train to depart. He was going to Frankfort, he believed, on some urgent affair an English gentleman, perhaps, who had been spending the winter in camp; but his papers were all right -otherwise - and the official smiled grimly. "Balked!" said Kentucky, in English, with a sud- den calm in his voice; and he turned on his heel, gathered up his cloak and bag, and departed. The coachman had driven his carriage to a little hostelry, where some few French people were pain- fully engaged in gaining a miserable livelihood in selling beer and bread to the soldiery. He found the V coachman, talking loudly with some extempore com- rades over a glass of beer, and taking him by the arm, said to him,- "We must go on to Epernay." The coachman stared at him aghast. "But I cannot go," he said.  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7012-00000108"/> 214      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. Whereupon Kentucky at once produced an order giving him the use of one soldier, one carriage, and two horses, to go wherever he saw fit, provided he was not stopped by counter orders. So the soldier grumblingly acquiesced, on condition that he should be allowed a nap in the straw, and a bait for his horses before he pushed on. Kentucky entered the house, and having won the kind regards of the hostess, obtained a decent chamin, ber in which to rest, and something hot to eat; then he threw himself down on the bed, and slept until the coachman knocked at his door.  Five hours afterwards, Kentucky, his coachman and his steeds, were planted in the middle of a great road, with both forward wheels of the coach splintered into fragments; and the coachman, limping, with an ugly bruise upon his shoulder, was bitterly bewail-  ing the fate which had sent him scurrying about the country with such a harebrained American. "Donnerwetter " he said ; "the idiot would force me  to drive at full tilt past a provision train; one wheel  caught, and I got a beating for my pains. Thump!- - here we are on the ground, and what's to be done?" Kentucky laughed when he was first thrown head- long upon the frozen ground; but when he arose and shook himself, a heavy scowl settled upon his fea- tures. He began to feel that the Fate was flying   THE TELL-TALE PAPER.      215 faster than he could pursue; that the chances were against him. A thick, heavy, blurring snow was now falling rapidly, shutting out the face of the landscape, obstructing the road, and Kentucky saw plainly that unless he could get immediate aid, they were likely to spend the night upon the route; so, with the hope of infusing courage into his blundering coachman, he took out of ithe pocket in the carriage a huge flask of schnapps, and tendered it to the bruised hero. The coachman accepted it thankfully, and drank so much that he was speedily unfitted for duty, and sat howling and nursing his shoulder on a snow-covered stone by the road-side, while Kentucky busied himself by recalling his old teamster-craft, and endeavoring to patch up the carriage. But it was of no avail; the provision train, which was the cause of all the grief, had thundered away into the distance; no new line of wagons came in sight; and so Kentucky took from his pocket paper and pencil, wrote a huge pla- card in German script, "Adounbet," and fastened it upon the carriage, with a grim smile upon his face. Then he unhitched the horses from the carriage, separated them, and firmly secured his cloak and travelling bag upon one of the animals. "What in the worthy name of Heaven are you doing?" said the coachman.  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7012-00000109"/> 216      KENVTUCKY'S LOVE. "Going on to Epernay," said Kentucky, sternly;  i "and if you want any more schnapps, you must come  with me."  He held up the bottle seductively. The coachman rose, leaped to the other horse, ar-  ranged his cloak upon it, and they set off together  on the two dilapidated Rosinantes, through the blind- ing snow-fall.  S .  ,   e    * . Meantime, how fared it with the pursued? Cocoon had reached the train at Lagny just as the hissing of the steam in the engine announced its immediate departure; and he bustled into a third-class car,  crowded with Saxon laborers, who had been repairing a line of rails torn up by some daring peasants. Co- coon looked anxiously to right and left, fearing vaguely some pursuer, although he did not imagine that Kentucky knew of his departure. Indeed, he  g fancied that Kentucky would be angry with him because he had not told him of his intentions, and would leave him to his fate, or to his duty, as he was pleased to phrase it to himself. Then occurred a grievous delay of half an hour, while a newly-come wagon landed its freight of coffins and return-mail. Cocoon left the car, and walked anxiously up and down the platform; fuming at the officials, and fret- ting his soul away. At last, however, everything    THE TELL-TALE PAPER.      217 was complete, and he ensconced himself in his corner, right glad of the jar and rumble of the train that car- ried him to the first stage of his mission. The train moved with wearisome slowness, and it was late in the afternoon before it arrived at Epernay. a Now and then the engineer paused, and sent his scouts ahead, as he saw a group of men gathered upon the track. 'A sergeant and half a dozen soldiers ran to examine the suspicious ground, waited until the train came rumbling to them, and stopped, then re- sumed their places in the forward car, and again the convoy moved slowly onward. Delays of half an hour at each of the numerous sta- tions on the way made COcoon fear that he should not arrive in London until the siege was over. But one face hovered before him all the time; every moment of the weary way he could see this white face, with its crown of golden hair, with its introspective eyes gazing tenderly upon him, and seeming to plead with him to keep his courage, and to go sternly forward until he had reached the goal. Then he took from his breast the little locket, and looked long and lovingly upon it, until a loud laugh from the rough men behind him recalled him to the fact that he was not alone, and that the laborers were also enjoying his reverie. When he reached Epernay, and had passed the cus- tomary examination, he was glad to crawl to the little  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7012-00000110"/> 218     KENTUCKY'S LOVE. auberge, and seek a bed, where he slept until late at night. He was awakened by a feeling of intense cold, and he arose, shivering, and groped in the darkness for i his brandy flask. Taking a huge draught of the re-  viving liquid, he fumbled about for matches, but, find-  ing none, went to the low window, and discovered  that it was open, but that the lattice was closed. As he was about to shut out the cold, his attention was attracted by the noise of voices, apparently directly  beneath the window. They were talking in French, and he listened earnestly, because he caught the words Versailles, Paris, and Orleans. One voice was  round, full, and of deepest bass, although smothered in  a frightened way, as if the owner were discussing something which he did not wish overheard; the other was the sweet voice of a young woman, ear- nestly and quietly forcing upon the attention of the man something of importance. Cocoon caught these words: - "But I tell you, Auguste, there is more in it than even I would have imagined; the day of deliverance is not far off; these brutes have not long to stay. You know little Antoine, who ran the lines, and man- : aged to get to Lagny without being arrested?" "Yes, the fool," answered the other, gruffly; "and  he brought nothing but misery. Does he think, then,  that we have so much more to eat here than they have there?"    THE TELL-TALE PAPER.      219 "No," answered the woman; "do not be hard with Antoine; he is our cousin, you know; and he told me a bit of news which you would like to hear. He says J :i that communications do exist, in spite of the brutes of Prussians, between Paris and Orleans; and, what is more to the point, he swears that we have established an agency at'Versailles, and that the spies go and come, as free as air. What do you think of that, my brave? ' "O, bah " answered the gruff voice ; "I would not believe Antoine under oath; and, I tell you, the southern armies are already smashed to atoms. I hate M  the Prussians as badly as you do, but they are good soldiers, and we are in for it, this time. All that 1 wish is to have the affair end, that we may be at peace, and sell as much wine as we did last year. I am for the emperor still. I don't like this new rabble of national defenders. They bring us nothing but new taxes. I tell you, Aglae, we have nothing to ex- pect from southern armies or Parisian pluck." "No, but," said the woman, "you don't know all: these spies are conducted by some foreign woman. I don't know who or what she is, but they say she is marvellously clever; that even the Germans can't con- vict her. One of her agents - so Antoine says - was caught and shot in the woods near Versailles the other day; but he had papers that were written in a cipher,  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7012-00000111"/> 220     KENTUCKY'S ,LO VE. which the Germans at first thought they could under- stand, but out of which they only got confusion; and, what is more, the body of this spy was rescued by the Frenchmen, and carried off. And now perhaps you do not believe." "No," said the gruff voice; " and I am going to bed, for I am sleepy." Then the voices retired, and Cocoon, trembling with excitement, closed the window, gently saying to him- self, -- "So, then, the fair Margaret's scheme is not vision- ary. It is doing real service; and H-how do I stand? Am I right? Am I wrong? What responsi- bilities have I to either side? None. I am her knight, bound to do her will, and I will do it to the uttermost." Then the poor boy donned his clothes, and tripped down stairs just in time to find the landlord, who was the owner of the gruff voice, taking a little extempore meal by himself in his pantry. He stared, and dropped the knife with which he was cutting bread and cheese, when he saw Cocoon. "Have you not been to bed, friend?" he said, in a frightened voice. "O, yes, landlord," answered Cocoon, in very good French; "but the cold woke me up, and I remembered that I had had no supper: may I join you?"   THE TEL L-TALE PAPER.      221 *   tL"Yes," said the landlord, hesitating, "I suppose you may; but we are so used to being hungry here, that we don't feel very sympathetic for hungry people; since you are our guest, however, and seem to be a good fellow, - for I judge you are no Prussian " "No, indeed," said Cocoon, hastily, "I am an Amer- ican." "Well, then, enemy or friend, here goes." And he called his wife to bring a bottle of wine from the cellar. So Cocoon ate and drank with the gruff man, who observed him curiously all the time. As Cocoon arose, after having refreshed himself, he said,- "Has no one arrived at the inn since I went to bed?" "Why do you ask?" said the landlord, glaring at him. "No matter," said Cocoon, haughtily; "suffice it that I am your friend, and no German, and I want to know." Z   There was something forbidding in his demeanor, but the landlord felt influenced by his tone, and lie answered,- "Well, now I think of it, yes, there were two guests who came in at ten o'clock, and a queer pair they were, too. One of them had the longest legs I ever saw, and he was no Frenchman. I don't think he was  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7012-00000112"/> 222      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. a Prussian, for he looked too kind for that; but he had a brute of a Prussian soldier with him, and they are in a little room near here, eating my food, curse them! but I suppose they will pay me for it. That is all the consolation we have nowadays- their money. We cannot help taking it, even if there is blood on it; but sometimes, when I take a Prussian's money, I feel that I would like to beat his brains out with a bag full of it."  "IMy friend," said Cocoon, a new fear suddenly steal- ing over him, "is there any military train from here to-morrow morning?" "Yes," said the landlord, "there are even two trains. One is to leave - let me see - in an hour. It goes by night from here to Nancy, and there the passengers wait for the train which leaves here at six o'clock; but, as I was saying, this is a queer pair. You might look at them," said the landlord, softened by the feel- ing that Cocoon might be some powerful person in dis- guise. "They came here mounted on two jaded coach horses, with the harness falling about their heels, and the soldier, I think, was drunk, but his master was re- served and frosty enough, I can tell you; and although he was immediately arrested by the Prussians, they let him go shortly, for he had something of importance - some cursed contrivance of the enemy; and he said that their carriage broke down on the road from   THE TELL- TALE PAPER.     223 Lagny. They came here on horseback, and the coach- man Las to take the horses back in the morning. You would laugh to see them: go and look, sir." Again the fear smote Cocoon's heart; was it, then, the pirsuers that he feared? So he went with the landlord, and, standing behind him, looked cautiously through a little half-window which commanded a view of the room. Tie blood surged to his heart, then to his face, and then seemed to desert his veins, for he saw, with note- book spread out before him, and the hand which con- tained the pencil flying rapidly as if keeping ahead of his thought, the friend whom he so much feared and loved, the veritable pursuer, the dreaded, the satur- nine and redoubtable Kentucky. Kentucky did not raise his eyes, all unconscious that the pursued was so near: he continued his rapid writ- ing, and. the drunken soldier lay with his hands spread out upon the table, snoring noisily. Cocoon drew hastily back. "Well, landlord," he said, "I should think they were a queer pair. But the tall man does not look like a Prussian; it seems to me that I have seen him at Ver- sailles; he may be some foreign military man, or some writer." "Yes," said the host, "he is queer- isn't he? What train did you decide to take?"  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7012-00000113"/> 224      KENTUCKY'S LOVE.  "O, now that I am awake," said Cocoon, "I shall by all means take the first train. It will bring me to Nancy, and I shall have time to sleep before the other arrives. I could not sleep here again, and if you will tell me how much I owe you, and get me my bag, I will make you a present of a nice little flask of brandy for the kindness which you will have in showing me the station." "O, yes," said the landlord, "as you will; but are you sure that the officials will let you go?" "Ah," said Cocoon, resuming his old haughtiness, "I should like to see them stop me; and remember,  friend," he said, as they walked down into the coach- yard of the hostelry, "not to speak so loud next time you discuss private matters. I overheard your conver- sation about spies, and Paris, and Orleans, from the window; and your wife was not so far wrong when she said that deliverance was at hand. Silence Courage!" The nan's face turned ashy pale, his knees trembled, and he said,-- "You will not betray us; we should be thrown into prison." "Well," said Cocoon, " if you do not betray me, we are quits." The man would have fawned at his feet. So now Cocoon made haste to escape from the pursuer. He thrust some gold into the landlord's hand, and taking   THE TELL- TALE PAPER.      225 the baggage which the trembling woman brought, they hurried to the station, succeeded in obtaining a place for Cocoon, and that reckless individual hugged him- self with delight when he felt that he once more had the start of the pursuer, whom he now dreaded and loved more than ever. It was two o'clock in the morning when Kentucky finished his writing; and the landlord, who had re- ceived injunctions to say nothing of his departure, entered, saying, - "Gentlemen, it is very, very late, and I should like to see you safely in bed before I lock up the house. I was going to bed an hour ago, but I saw you were writing, and I didn't wish to disturb you." "Have you any other lodgers here to-night?" asked Kentucky; " any who came from Lagny by the train.?" ".Eh bien," thought the landlord, "here is a mys- tery; these two fellows know of each other's move- ments then; but I shall say nothing about the young gentleman, for I think he is on our side." "There are no other lodgers; none who came from Lagny here," answered the landlord, boldly. "No?" said Kentucky, inquiringly; "is there any other hotel in town?" "None, sir," said the landlord. "Then a lodger, a stranger, not a soldier, must have come here to stop." 15  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7012-00000114"/> 226      KENTUCKY'S LO E. "Not necessarily, sir," answered the landlord, po- litely; "he might have been billeted upon some " Kentucky turned away with a dissatisfied gesture, and said, "But has any train left here to-night for Nancy or Strasbourg?" "Yes, sir," said thelandlord ; "there was a train left a little time ago, which goes, I don't know exactly where," he answered, remembering his promise to Co- coon. Kentucky bit his fingers with vexation. So, then, Cocoon had slipped him; he had perhaps come on to Epernay, staid in the station until the departure of the night train, and so escaped meeting his pursuer. "And when does the next train leave?" he asked, eagerly. "In the morning, sir, at six. Will you be called for it?" "I shall not sleep," said Kentucky. "As for this being here," pointing scornfully to the soldier, "see that he is provided for, and started on the way in the morning with his horses. Let him sleep out his debauch, and here is money to pay for it.'" The landlord ushered Kentucky into the very room which Cocoon had so lately left. "This is the only place, sir," he said, "which is not occupied by Prussian officers; and you will have to make shift here until the train goes.'   TIE TELL-TALE PAPER.      227 227 "Very well," said Kentucky; "leave me." As he set his candle down upon a chair, a bit of paper on the floor caught his eye. It was a slender strip, written in a lady's hand, and, the words were these: '"You go with God and with the talisman which protects; may it bring you safely back to MARGARET." A flash illumined Kentucky's countenance. "So, then, the landlord has been duping me," he said. "Cocoon has been here, and has fled by the midnight train. I must have my wits about me if I would bring him back;" and he gnashed his teeth and wrung his hands. He looked at the paper curiously again, read it care- fully, seeming to learn the very words, then folded it up, and put it securely in his pocket.  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7012-00000115"/> 228      KEN'TUCK Y'S LO V E. CHAPTER XVII.             i THE PURSUIT. L  ONG  before the winter dawn came crawling up the world's sides, and peering solemnly upon the wrecked country round Paris, with a bitter smile, Kentucky, who had not slept, arose from the bed on which he had thrown himself, with Margaret's note to Cocoon clutched in his hand, and prepared to depart for the station. The landlord thunderously knocked at his door, true to his promise, and urged him to hasten, for the train sometimes left before the hour announced. Kentucky had been seeing, during the three hours in which he lay upon his bed motionless, although his nerves played sad havoc with his brain and body, a figure of the past, which flitted slowly before his eyes, and from time to time seemed to gaze upon him with a remembered look which thrilled his heart. He clenched his hand and cursed aloud, for it was Margaret's face, as he had seen it when she wandered,   THE -PURSUIT.        229 a happy maiden, among the bloomy lanes at New- port, and when he had first mnet her. Unconsciously, he found himself humming the lines which she had sung to him many happy years ago, when they were true and accepted lovers, and when the future seemed to spread a path of gold before them:- M' appari tlutta fulgente D' un angelica Belta, -  Bella come all' oriente A tramonte dell' esta. Abellita del sorriso Della prima gioventu; Era uqc angelo del paradiso, Era un fiore di virtu." But the landlord's noisy knock dispersed, for the moment, all visions of the past, and Kentucky was soon on the road to the station; the only remrinis- cence of his late vision being the recollection of the song, which he now whistled, now hummed, as he strode forward. He reached Nancy without adventure, and, although he searched the city through for Cocoon, he found no trace of him. So the next morning he wearily continued his journey to Strasbourg; and as he crossed the great market-place, and strolled into the shadows of the cathedral, among the crowd of tumnul- tuous soldiery, the greasy, boyish Badensers, the squalid Bavarians, and the trim, precise Prussians,  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7012-00000116"/> 230     KENTUCKiY'S LOVE.            \ he saw a figure running rapidly from the cathedral towards the market. It was Cocoon. He knew him in a moment, and he set off at once in mad pursuit.  But the spectacle of two men running in open  daylight, in evident pursuit one of the other, was too much for the suspicious Prussians, and Kentucky suddenly found himself the centre of a querying group of blond-mustached faces, and was quietly in- formed that he was arrested! By the time he had disengaged himself from his captors, after airing his German and his unimpeachable papers, Cocoon had disappeared; and Kentucky despairingly hurried to the hotel which he had lately left, and demanded a carriage. "What time," he gasped, "does the train leave for Frankfort?" "Not until evening, sir," was the answer. So Ken- tucky took a carriage, and rejoiced in the hope that he might encounter Cocoon at the station, and bring him back from his mad mission. Whenrevening came, he cloaked and disguised him- self as much as possible, took a carriage, and rattled over the Rhine bridge to the station at Kehl. He inspected every carriage, blundered into each com- partment, and narrowly scanned the faces of sleepy   TIIE PURSUIT.       231 and cross individuals, but nowhere found Cocoon. So he gave up, for the moment, in despair, and threw himself into a corner of his compartment, where, worn out with emotion and fatigue, he soon fell fast asleep. At various points in the journey, waking suddenly from his fitful sleep, he seemed to hear Co- coon's voice, and would rush out at the stations, confident that he had found him. But no tall, grace- ful form, no black-bearded face, with lustrous eyes, greeted his anxious vision. In the morning, a cold, gray, dull dawn awoke him in Frankfort, and he had not yet found the object of his search. Now, the truth was, that Cocoon had seen Ken- tucky at Strasbourg, and that, having carefully studied the hours of the departure of the trains, he feared lest he might meqt him; so he hid himself carefully away in an obscure hotel, until he was sure Kentucky had departed. Then he spent the evening in writing a long letter, filled with wild phrases of love and devotion, but saying nothing of his mission, to Mar- garet; and in the morning, not without some mis- givings lest Kentucky might intercept him on the road, set out for Frankfort. When he arrived there, he once more hid himself, took the train, late at night, for Mayence, and at early morning drifted down the river in a pleasure-boat, arriving at Cologne precisely twenty-four hours after Kentucky had decided to go on to Brussels. I    &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7012-00000117"/> 232      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. But Kentucky had no hopes of finding Cocoon in the Belgian capital. He went thither to obtain new funds, and an outfit, for he was now a correspondent, and his purse was getting low. So it happened that while he was busied with his bankers in Brussels, Cocoon reached the capital, and, overcome with fatigue and suspense, sat down in the great waiting-room of the Northern station, anxiously attending the departure of the evening train for Calais. When Kentucky had completed his business, he threw himself into a little carriage, and ordered the driver to make the tour of the great exterior Boule- vards. As he was whirled along the avenue, bordered with rows of majestic trees, he questioned himself earnestly, and began slowly to make up his mind that he had been an ass. "Why," he said to himself, " at best, all I knew was that Cocoon was bound for Lagny, and I have traced him only to Strasbourg. Why, then, should I fancy that he came to Frankfort? and why am I wasting time here? I will return at once to Strasbourg and Versailles. It is too late to save the foolish boy, and Margaret has left no clue in her written farewell note here "-he clenched it in his hand, as he spoke--"to the path which the youth has taken." At this moment the carriage was passing the North- ern station. Kentucky put his head out of the win-   THE PURSUIT.        233 dow, to ask of the driver if he could catch the train for Cologne that night, when he saw, standing on the steps of the station, and tranquilly smoking a cigar, the young man whom he sought; this same Cocoon, who had so long fled before him like a shadow!    "Ah," he cried, loudly, "I will not be foiled this time; I will have him." And he leaped from the car- riage, throwing a Napoleon at the astonished driver, and rushed towards the figure; but, as he approached it, there was a loud whistle inside the station. Cocoon turned like a flash, and rushed towards the train, which had already begun to move. Kentucky followed him. The uniformed official at the gate made way before Cocoon's brandished ticket; so Kentucky, pulling from his breast pocket an old bit of paper, brandished it also. He gained the enclosure, and, desperately wrenching open the door, which the guard was just closing, leaped into a compartment, threw himself back upon the seat, and said,- "At last." He had seen Cocoon enter a forward compartment, and felt as glad as does the tiger that leaps upon its prey. This time Cocoon had not seen his pursuer, and, with Edmond About's "King of the Mountains" in his hand, and a cigarette in. his mouth, was whiling away the time.  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7012-00000118"/> 234       KENTUCKY'S LO VE. At the frontier, thought Kentucky, I will have him. Then he remembered that his pockets were crammed with German papers and passes, and that he was about entering on French soil.  "Good heavens!" he said; "I shall be arrested on the slightest suspicion, and locked up, Heaven only knows how long; perhaps even shot. But I will not relinquish the pursuit now." He was alone in the compartment.  He hastily  made a packet of every compromising document in his possession, and, pulling off one of his boots, placed I them carefully in it. Putting on the' boot again, he stamped on it, to see if it gave forth a rustling sound. , "No," he said, "they will not search me. I will   rely upon my American passport."          ! When they arrived at the frontier, a surly French i official, sleepy and weary, marched them all out of the compartments, and ushered them into a long hall, in i the centre of which two wickets made a narrow path- i way. At each end of these wickets a tall gendarme  8 was stationed. Kentucky headed the procession of   , travellers. The gendarme snatched his passport; it, i with all the others, was handed into a mysterious bu-  reau, whence, after half an hour's delay, it came out, with the cry, "The American gentleman?" Kentucky came forward timorously, but the passport was handed to him without a word, and he retreated   THE PURSUIT.        235 I  to the platform, wondering why the official had not    called for two American gentlemen, since Cocoon was in the train. But Master Cocoon, fearful lest anything might happen to obstruct his progress, had been care- J   fully provided with a French passport, of newest date, i and was travelling under an assumed name; so that he did not meet Kentucky at the wicket, and, as Fate would have it, kept aloof from him until the shriek 'of the engine once more called the travellers to their places in the train. Kentucky looked everywhere; but Cocoon had escaped him, and, locked into his own compartment, was safe from his pursuer at least until the train reached Calais, Late at night the train arrived before the grim old town of Calais, which stands, like an armed sentinel, looking seaward, and bidding defiance to its ancient enemies. The train rattled into the cheery station, out of the atmosphere of war and trouble, into that of light, warmth, and comfort. The English boat was in, and numbers of the insular travellers, wrapped in long Ulsters, and dipping their blond beards into huge beakers of Cognac and water, were slowly recovering from the two hours' seasickness which they had suf- fered. In the refreshment-room, an hundred people were seated before the daintily spread tables, chatting, laughing, singing, eating and drinking; and, as Ken-  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7012-00000119"/> 236      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. tucky strolled into this magic circle of comfort, he saw before him a tall figure, laying off its cloak, and calling lustily, in pleasant French, for coffee and something hot to eat. Kentucky went hastily to the figure, and, as it turned towards him, laid both hands upon its shoulders, and said, gravely,-- "Cocoon, I have come for you." Cocoon's legs failed beneath him, and he sat down in a chair.  "Why," he said, si ulating surprise, "Kentucky, what brings you here?" "Much the same mission," said Kentucky, "I fancy, that brings you. I am very anxious to faithfully serve a friend." And you then know why I am here," said Cocoon. "Not wholly," he answered; "but I have dimly guessed that you did not leave Versailles without some mission from Margaret; and I tell you, youth," he continued, in a deep and severe voice, "I will not have you sacrificed to her folly. Come back with me, Cocoon, before it is too late. Come back; we will show her how foolish she has been. I myself will plead your cause, and she shall be yours forever. Come back; it is not too late. Why are you here at Calais? What mad venture are you running?" "I am bound to London on a mission for her," said Cocoon. "It is but the beginning of a dangerous   1f4       TZTHE PURSUIT.      237 task. I will not be influenced by you, Kentucky; go your ways, and leave me, please. Nay, I forbid you to speak to me again on the subject. I forbid you to follow me. I am going to London; I shall return speedily to Versailles, if fortune favors me. Go back, I entreat you, as you are my friend; and good by for the present." '"But listen to me for a moment," pleaded Kentucky. "You don't know what danger you really incur. If you knew all that I could tell you, you would be over- whelmed, frightened; you would not dare persist. Conme back with me." "No," said Cocoon, firmly, "I will not; again, good night, and good by." Kentucky turned  sharply away, heart-sick and weary. "I have done my duty," he said. "Yes, I will take his advice, and will go back." He sat down at a table, and, regardless of the cu- rlious eyes upon him, bowed his head upon his hands. A tall man, dressed like an Englishman, and whom Kentucky had twice seen in the train on the road from Brussels to Calais, cast a singular look upon the form bowed over the table, as he followed Cocoon from the buffet. "At last," he said, "it strikes me that I have the final clue to this business. Now we shall see what we shall see."  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7012-00000120"/> 238      KENTUCIKY'S LOVE. It was the young major whom Cocoon and Margaret had seen writhing under the agony of his wound, in the hospital at Versailles, and who was still far from recovery; but he was so disguised that his best friends would not have known him. He drew a little French cigar from his pocket, and began quietly smoking. "I never was so contented in my life before," he said, under his breath, in German. '   A REVELATION.        239 A REVELATION. FEW  days after Kentucky had thus despairingly parted with Cocoon at the Calais station, the mid- night boat was once more nearing the shores of France, and Master Cocoon stood upon its storm-tossed deck, anxiously watching the great eye of Calais light, as every moment it grew larger and brighter. : The night was stormy, tempestuous, sullen; but the clouds had noi totally obscured the sky. Cocoon had caught a glimpse, as he had been whirled away from the English shores, an hour and a half before, of the great white cliffs of Dover, which the mad whiter waves leaped tumultuously to kiss and embrace, and of the sombre uplift of crags here and there dimly re- vealed in the uncertain light. Then, borne upward i   " and onward by the great sweep of the storm, in whose grasp the frail boat seemed many times ready to yield, he clung to the railing, and, while seasick and scared tyros in travel vanisHed into the airless abysses under  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7012-00000121"/> 240      KENTUCKY'S LO VE.. the hatches, he let the great waves break over him, until he was drenched to his skin. Even the r6ugh sailor who imagined him paying his tribute to Nep- tune, and was at first inclined to laugh at him, shrank back with a half-frightened gesture from the white, firm face turned towards the starless sky, as if mutely expectant of a summons from above. Cocoon was in a fever by the time the boat had reached Calais Pier, and the suspicious gendarmes and police agents were examining the faces of each passen- ger. As he stepped on the plank leading to the pier, a heavy, warm cloak was thrown over his shoulders, and a voice said gently, in an English slightly tinged with a foreign accent, "Will you aljw me to offer you my cloak? for you seem to have received a thorough ducking. 'You will need it for the first few minutes after coming to land, and you had better run into the hotel, and put on some dry clothes. Plenty of time before the train starts. - O, certainly!" (to the gendarme who sharply demanded his passport, as he stepped on the pier). Cocoon muttered a feeble "Thanks!" and turned to look at his new companion. Surely he had heard the voice before, and he fancied that it was not long ago. He could not remember this respectable middle-aged Englishman, or Belgian, with heavy gold-bowed eye- glasses perched decorously on his bluff red nose; but   A REVELATION.        241 the voice! no! it must be a. fancy, a dream; and he was glad to wrap the cloak closely about him, and to invite the kindly gentleman to enter the buffet, and to take a bottle of wine with him. "Agreed," was the cheery response, "if you will let me choose, my young friend, with especial reference to your case. . You are suffering from nervous exhaus-  t  tion; and I am going to recommend a bottle of Beaune, beautiful old shining Beaune, that makes you rejoice when you look at it. It is better than the bromide of potassium, which I saw you take at the pharmacy in London last evening." :S    Cocoon glanced suspiciously at his companion. "And how happened you to see me there, sir?" he asked.  I l"Nothing simpler, my boy. I was driving to the sta- l tion, and went into the pharmacy for some cordial. There you were; and I could not help hearing and see- ing you. No offence, I hope." These last words were slightly tinged with sarcasm; and Cocoon, vanquishing an inexplicable repugnance towards his companion, drained the wine-glasses as fast as they were filled, and the two chatted pleasantly together until it was time to take the train for Brus- sels. They each received their passports without any comments from' the gendarmes, and were soon whirling away through the north country, where, at 16  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7012-00000122"/> 242      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. every little station, there were evidences of warlike  preparation. The motion of the train soon lulled Co-  coon to sleep, and he was awakened on arriving at the frontier only to fall fast asleep again as soon as they were once more en route for Brussels. When they parted at the statoin the morning, the stranger said, "I wish you were going farther with me. I am bound to Versailles, where I have a private mission for some manufacturers."' "Of arms, probably," thought Cocoon; "he seems honest; and I cannot well avoid him:" so he said, cheeringly,- - "I am also going to Versailles, and we will travel together, if you like. It is a tedious journey, but we can accomplish it more pleasantly thus than alone." So they continued the journey as far as Lagny to- gether; and there Cocoon suddenly lost sight of the stranger. He made diligent inquiry for him, but he was nowhere to be found; neither in jail, in hotel, nor in adjacent camps. Cocoon continued his journey to Versailles alone, marvelling much at his companion's disappearance. He arrived late at night, and drove at once to Madame Varlin's. I met him at the door of his room, whither I had just gone to see if he had returned. He caught me by both hands. "Have you seen her?"' he said. "No - if you mean Margaret," I answered. "Ken- - . k   A REVELATION.        243 tucky is very ill, and I am afraid that his journey in search of you has killed him." Cocoon's eyes filled with tears. "Where is he?" he said. "I must go to him. But he will forgive me now that I have so successfully accomplished half my mission. I shall succeed with the other half. You will see." Kentucky had been suddenly smitten down, as by a giant hand, while returning from Calais to Versailles, and the strong man was shorn of all his strength. He reached me worn out, and had scarcely raised his head from his pillow since his return. I saw Cocoon enter his room, go and kneel at the bedside, and take the dear old boy's head in his hands. I knew that that was no place for me, and I softly withdrew. "To-morrow," said Cocoon, as he came out from Kentucky's presence with the light of reconciliation in his eyes, --" to-morrow I shall see Margaret. Every- thing is couleur de rose this evening with me, old Truepenny! Let us sit down in my window recess, and I will tell you about a stranger whom I met at Calais and lost at Lagny." No sooner had Cocoon told me of the stranger than I began to fear, and to regret that he had taken any one even into his companionship during his trip. "Rash youth," I said, "you have perhaps endangered  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7012-00000123"/> 244      KENYUC0KY'S LOVE. i. your life by allowing this mysterious fellow to dog  your footsteps."  "No," said Cocoon, hesitatingly. "Still I cannot  help feeling that he disappeared very unaccountably at Lagny. But even had he been a spy on nmy movements, he has seen nothing compromising, heard : absolutely nothing." ' At noon, the next day, Master Cocoon, dressed as if for a festival, departed for the white mansion in the  Avenue de Paris. Hours passed, and he returned not. In the evening I visited Kentucky's room, and was  amazed to find that the invalid was gone. There were everywhere in the chamber evidences that he had  dressed hastily, and had been absent but a short time.  Our landlady met me on the stairs. "Ah, sir," she said, "the tall gentleman has gone out; but he is  in a high fever, and unfit to walk a step. He had a portfolio under his arm, and even that seemed -a burden  to him. I was afraid that he might be delirious, and i I thought I would tell you."             i I knew that Kentucky was not delirious. I knew that it would be of no avail to folloT him; and I felt  that some new developments of the Fate were near at hand. I went to my room, and tried to read Mon-  taigne; but I was too nervous, and threw the book aside in disgust.  ,  *           O * * * S  .e   ?    4, ,    I i! *   A REVELATION.        245  This is what happened at the white mansion in the Avenue de Paris. The man servant smiled urbanely as he admitted Cocoon into the long drawing-room. It was a sig- nificant smile, which seemed to say, "Ah, yes,J know. You have come back safe-this time, but you will not succeed as readily on every occasion." Cocoon's breath failed, his knees trembled, as he entered the drawing-room, and stood near the piano. He almost fancied that he could see seated there a fair young woman, with the winter moonlight throw- ing subtle gleams upon her golden hair, and could hear the responsive keys, under the deft touch of her white fingers, intoning the sonorous Newport waltz, with all its glory of fervor and passionate outcry. He remembered how he had knelt before her, how wildly and eagerly he had kissed her hands, how completely he had given himself to her; and he longed for her at this moment as he had never longed before. Why did she not come? His pulses quickened; his heart beat like a trip-hammer. There was no light in the room; a wandering naissant moonshine only made every object wildly indistinct, and at each footfall in the corridor, at each sound in the street, he started and gazed earnestly at the door through which he ex- pected Margaret to enter. At last she came, clad in deepest black, with no  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7012-00000124"/> 246      KENTUC KY'S L O VYE. ribbon at her throat,-only a fragment of white lace, which seemed to render her face more luminous and inspiring than Cocoon had ever seen it before. She came directly to him, and, although his first impulse  was to clasp her in his arms, he was speedily checked i by the frank manner in which she held out her hands,  and said, -!.; "Cocoon, the talisman has brought you safely back  to me. Thank God! and bless you. And--what news? Did he follow you?" The young man cast a frightened look upon her. "How could you know, Margaret," he said, as he  stooped, a moment after, and tenderly kissed her hand,  "that Kentucky would follow me?" Then he remem- bered the conversation which he and I had long ago overheard between Margaret and Kentucky, and he was silent. "But he did follow you?" she said, eagerly; " and  he is illhow - is he not? O, Cocoon, let us go to him, and save him!" "  Her eyes were wild with love and anxiety, and   : Cocoon, standing before this woman, fancied that the love she felt was for himself. l "No, Margaret," he  said, gently; "Kentucky is much better, and will soon be able to wander about  restlessly as of yore. He followed me to Calais, earful lest you had led me into some unsafe mission; I   A REV ELATION.       247 but -when he saw that I was determined, he re- turned." "And so you have seen them in London. And you are sure that no German spies were on your track, and that they will be able to accomplish the sending of the provisions qq demanded?" "Yes," said Cocoon; and he handed her a packet of papers, written in a mysterious cipher, over which she eagerly pored. Finally, lifting up her face, which was radiant with joy, she cried, - "My brave, true Cocoon, you have done your work well; and you are sure. that Kentucky is not very ill?" She blushed as she called Cocoon's friend by the famil- iar name which had once been so dear to her, and, sitting down by the'piano, turned idly towards the keys. "Kentucky is indeed much better, I assure you, lMargaret. And have you no word of love for me?" As he falteringly spoke, he bowed his head, and came gently forward to where she sat motionless. She made no answer, but turned to the piano, and began playing the Newport waltz with such a fervor and abandon that Cocoon listened, amazed and over- whelmed. As Margaret ceased playing for a moment, she heard a tread of heavy feet in the hall, and, like Co- coon, turned hastily and confusedly to ascertain what it was.  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7012-00000125"/> 248      KENTUCKY'S LO VE. Suddenly a. face appeared at the door of the drawing- 3 room, then was withdrawn; but a momentary glance at it was sufficient to thrill Cocoon's blood with horror, to make him reel, and- at last to sit down, overcome with dread.  It was the face of the stranger whom he had met oin"  the Channel boat, of the stranger whom he had so mysteriously lost trace of at Lagny! Margaret, trembling, she knew not why, rang for lights; and when they were brought, they cast a cheery glow around a tall figure; standing motionless in the doorway. It was that of an elderly and sub- stantial Englishman, with stiffly starched collar, and massive gold-bowed spectacles, setting into strong, re- lief his ruddy complexion. He held a handkerchief in his hand, and waved it gently at the young pair, who stood regarding him with frightened eyes. "You had better sit down, you two," he said to them in English. "I knew you were here," he con- tinued, waving his handkerchief at Cocoon, "and I thought this would be the best place to catch you." Cocoon arose to his feet, and was about to make an  angry response, when the whole demeanor of the stranger changed. He threw down his handkerchief; he strode forward to the table, made two deft move- ments with both hands, and laid before the astonished couple a pair of false whiskers. Then he dexterously   A RE VELA TION.       249 threw aside his outer coats, and stood before them in the garb of a Prussian officer. A sabre had been looped up so as to be entirely concealed underneath his disguise; but he now let it fall and clatter at his heels, as he moved quickly to the hall door, and locked and bolted it. Returning, he picked up his hand- kerchief, and tranquilly began rubbing the false color from his face. Margaret leaned forward, gave one long, searching, horrified glance at the face, then fell fainting to the floor. It was the face of the young Piussian major whom Margaret had known at Newport; who had slain her lover in a duel, and whom she had seen wounded and apparently dying in the hospital-palace at Ver- sailles.  "Well," said the officer, still in English, "you see that I was determined to find out the real truth in this painful matter, and to track you both until I had you where I could punish you." Be ore largaret could make a movement, he had stepped to the piano, gathered up the precious papers written in cipher, and placed them in his breast pocket. "I should not have liked to have missed those papers," he said. "There must be some good reading  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7012-00000126"/> 250     KENTUCKY'S LOVE.  in them. And so, Fraulein Margaret would have  enjoyed the role of the deliveress of Paris! Bah!  That is now impossible-is it not?" "Yes," said Margaret, without any trace of anger in her voice. Then turning to Cocoon, she cried, hastily, -  "Fly, ere it is too late! Nothing can be proved   against you, if you are not found here. Go!" The Prussian laughed. Cocoon did not move. "No," said the officer, finally; "you are fairly taken, ! and you might as well yield gracefully. As for yonder meddling fool (pointing to Cocoon), I shall use my best endeavors to get him shot as a spy, and I do not believe that it will be very difficult; and as for  you, Fraulein Margaret, you shall find that my ven- geance is as deep as your contempt." Margaret had no word to say.  "I do not suppose you will fancy me entirely led on by vengeance in this new movement, Margaret," said the officer. "If there is anything that can sweeten and make more delicious that vengeance, it is the thought that, in consummating it, I am serving i my country and my king; for you must remember that Ich binb ein Preuss, und soil ein Preuss noch sein."  He struck his breast in an empty, semi-theatrical manner, as he said these words, and Margaret turned   A REVELATION.        251 from him, and leaned against the piano, trembling in every limb. Ah! if in that moment she had put her arms around Cocoon, and defied all the world to tear him from them,-if she had even shown him, by one look or sign of tenderness, that she loved him, - he would have been stronger. But she did not touch his hand, and her gaze was seemingly fixed on some far-away object. Cocoon felt that his brain was turn- ing; his heart wkas lead; his pulses were murderous; his eyes failed. "Now, then, meddler," said the officer, rudely, "there are six soldiers posted at the street corner, and I am going to call them. You will be arrested and marched off by them. You may possibly reflect, betweeni now and the time of your execution, on the motives of the good God in making women who spend their whole lives in luring men to destruction, as this woman has lured you." He stepped to the door he had so recently locked, and was about to place the key in the lock to re-open it, when a furious blow upon it from the other side sent him reeling backward; another smote it from its hinges, and Kentucky strode into the room, a loose cloak wrapped about his fevered form, and a portfolio grasped in one hand. Without saying a word, he struck the officer twice heavily across the face with  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7012-00000127"/> 252      KENTUCKY'S LOVE. the portfolio, and then stood glaring at the surprised  Prussian like a maniac. At last he spoke.  "Cocoon, do not move a step. Margaret, I prom- ised to save you, and to watch over Cocoon. I know not what strange presenitqment of evil forced me to rise from my sick bed to-right, and to come to tell you the story which I have so long concealed from you. But Heaven has sent me, for there stands the hero  of the tale, and I have smitten him for a coward!" The Prussian drew his sabre; but he let it fall ere he had half raised it, for Kentucky cried, in a loud voice, - "If you raise your sword against me; if you cry out; if you summon thQ soldiers posted at yonder : corner; if you do not promise me to depart instantly  to rejoin your regiment, and to forever hold your peace concerning all that you lnow of Margaret and Co-  coon, and their mad mission of deliverance,--I will! send this portfolio to-morrow morning to the leader of the Prussian armies, and Iwill denounce you pub- licy, as I now denounce you before these two, as the wilful murderer of Charles Regnier, at Newport in 1864."   COCOON SEES CLEARLY.      253 CHAPTER XIX. COCOON SEES CLEARLY. GHASTLY   pallor came upon the face of the Prussian, and he raised his eyes with an intense longing, yet frightened look, as if he saw floating be- fore him some dread, unnamable spectre, which pos- sessed his whole soul with fear. He replaced his sabre in his scabbard tremblingly, and, groping dimly for a chair, at last found one, and collapsed into it. I-e cowered before Kentucky as a whipped hound cowers before his master, and his blue eyes could not fix themselves upon the feverish and exalted face of the American. Margaret stood with her hands clasped together, and her eyes fastened upon Kentucky. Therewas a wild hunger in her look, .which Cocoon, who was watching her almost ferociously, saw for the first time in its real light. Suddenly it came to him, with almost crushing force, that Margaret did not love him; that her whole  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7012-00000128"/> oi      KKENTUCKY'S LOVE.  oul was bound up in Kentucky; that all the old flame, which she had boasted was burned away and buried beneath the ashes, was now leaping, more brightly than ever before, upon Love's altar. It came to him with crushing force that he was thrust aside; that Margaret was lost to him forever; that Kentucky would triumph where he had failed; and for one mo- ment a wild, swelling current of tumultuous jealousy and hatred swelled up to his brain with resistless pas- sion. In   at one mad moment he would willingly have seen   lentucky dead at his feet, and would not have shed a tear. Kentucky advanced slowly to the Prussian, pointed his lean finger at him   menacingly, and  said, in a hoarse, harsh voice,- "Do you dare to deny the truth of the accusation which I bring against you ? Do you dare to deny that in that forest outside Newport town, on that hot and dreamy    summer day, when the very heavens seemed baking under the wrath of God, when even the trees were withering    beneath the glare of the all-seeinag eye that looked down into your criminal heart,--do you dare to deny that you came upon Charles Regnier where he sat poring over the letter which this woman here had sent him ?   that you shot him like a  dog.? that you placed a pistol by his side, and a letter, which you hurriedly traced, simulating  a  challenge  to mortal   COCOON SEES CLEARLY.      255 combat? And when you thought no one was looking on, you fled like a murderer, as you are, back to your hotel, forged an acceptance of a challenge from him, and left it in your room, and then thievishy and by night ran away to Europe, and finally to this Prussian army, which you have dishonored? Do you dare to deny that I, wandering pensive in the forest that day, half mad with love for the woman to whom, as yet, I had never spoken, consumed with the passion which seemed burning up my soul, came upon you, saw you do the dreadful deed, realized your purpose of flight, and, overmastered by my love for the woman, did not then and there seize you by the throat, and choke out your villanous life, but consented to the fraud, and to the crime, that I might myself possess the love of this woman, whose lover you had slain? If you dare to deny it, I will kill you here like a dog!" Margaret and Cocoon stood mute, motionless as statues, waiting the response. The Prussian tried to arise, but his limbs failed him. His thin lips slowly shaped the words,- "And so you were there; you saw all, and I am indeed punished. Well," he said, with trembling bra- vado, "I did do thq deed." And here he paused a moment. Then, with a giant effort, he struggled to his feet, and moved towards the door. He placed himself in it, and drew his sable.  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7012-00000129"/> Yes," he repeated,    ,, I did it, and now I accept your conditions. If you will let me go in peace; if you will make no word of this; if you will promise me absolute immunity, I will retire, and I will leave these foolish lovers to their fate." A moment afterxards, he added, ttr ing towards " Possibly the F1raulein wonders lid  kne w of her mission, for Moltke himself could not perfect his plans more secretly than she did hers. Let me tell her. It so happened that I was detailed among tie re-enfolce- ments sent to help out our fellows in the woods below Enghien. After the fight Was over, I was returning through a glade in the woods with a few men, when I sav, lying prone on the frozen ground before us, a body, which I at first thought was that of this same Charles Regnier  whose life - was taken at Newport in 1864. The body was stiff in death; it was clad in an undress rFrench uniform; the face was upturned; it was Regnier! I uttered a wild cry of delight, for I felt that he had not met his death at my ]ands in  Newport, and I stooped, with the others, over the body,-only to find, from a crumpled paper in the breast pocket, that it was not the Regnier whom I sought, but the brotherl of whom I had so often heard him speak." "It was the body of the dead spy," cried Cocoon. "The body which the Frenchmen carried away during   the fight around the villa at Enghien! The mystery is clear, now !" " It was Regnier's brother- wasn't it?" said the officer, in a cold, heartless tone. "Yes." "Well, I searched the body again and again, until in the lining of the coat collar I found an artfully con- trived little pocket. In it was a note in cipher. It took me a week to unravel it; but I found it was a note to Margaret Devine, at Versailles, giving news from Paris; and I was not slow to draw my conclusions. So I found the Fraulein; and had it not been for you - curse you !" turning towards Kentucky, " I would have had my revenge !" "But who," said Kentucky, "can shun the chance that destiny doth ordain." "So we buried the body," added the officer. "It took a long time to dig a hole in the frozen ground; but I was glad when it was lone, for the man looked so strangely like his dead brother. B-r-r-r! By and by, I heard that this same man had been shot for a spy, and that the mysterious disappearance of his body on the night of the skirmish had made some superstitious soldiers think he was in league with the devil. Not long afterwards I was winged myself; and while I was lying in hospital, who should pass before my bedside one day but the Fraulein herself! Then I had my clue!             17 &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7012-00000130"/> 258      KENTUCKY'S  LOVE.   : Kentucky cast a swift look at Margaret. She came  forward slowly, set her white lips firmly together, looked for a moment on the officer, at Cocoon, then at Kentucky, and said, in a stifled whisper, i "Let him go; there is nothing left now for any of  us but remorse."    - The officer turned, hurried through the hall, and the outer door closed clangorously behind him. A great light came into Kentucky's eyes. "At first," he said, not seeming to address Margaret  or Cocoon, but speaking rather to himself, and in a  voice which sounded far away, - " at first I did not  realize the enormity of the crime. It was not until I had hurried to the side of the dying man and lifted up! his wounded form; not until I had seen his pale lips shape that one word "I Margaret; " not until I had seen his shaking hand pointed in the direction in which the murderer had hastily retreated, - that I comprehende(d to the uttermost the crime; and then I took measures to secure the culprit. But it was too late. When I reached my  room, overcome by the horror, weighed down   by the great passions which surged through my   soul, I was ill and faint, and I could not go  to declare what I   had seen, until the man had fled; until those who had found the body, of Reg- nier in the woods had determined, with Dogherry-like sagacity, that a duel had been fought. Then, like a    COCOON SEES CLEARLY.      259 criminal as I am myself, I kept the dreadful secret. I have kept it until now; and I was but too bitterly, too severely punished, when the love which I had won from you, Margaret, was taken away again from me, anud I was left alone with the consciousness that you were lost to me forever, and that I had basely neg- lected my duty and stifled my conscience in not going, to tell of what I had seen, and to set the world upon the murderer's track. My whole life since has been embittered by this great neglect--by my complicity in the crime of this man, whose courage had failed him at the last moment, and who dared not remain near you, to carry out the lie which he had madly hoped might win you to him, and which henceforth I am sure has pursued him wherever he has gone." Margaret stretched out her hands to Kentucky. "And so," she said, "you made no effort to save him. You saw him murdered; you gave no helping hand, no alarm. It is beyond belief." "Yes," said Kentucky, "God help me, I did noth- ing save return to the town, filled with fright at the horrible spectacle. I did not go at once, as I should have done, to the officers of justice, and warn them; and I even concurred, as I have told you, in the terrible mistake which the authorities made when they decided that Regnier was shot in a duel. I stifled down my self-respect; I ground down  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7012-00000131"/> 260      KEgNTUCKY'S LOVE.        . my honor, and, when the dead man was under the earth, I betook myself earnestly to the task of win-  ning you. Many and many a time, as we walked hand in hand by night, my heart cried out to me to tell you what I had seen; but I did not know how much the dead man had been to you, and some strange fate for- bade me to shake your soul with the full knowledge of the enormous crime that had been committed. And now," he said, "I have done my duty, Margaret. I have unmasked the criminal before you. I have told  you of my own culpability. I have saved you from the clutches of your enemies, and I entreat you, by the memories of our old love, to renounce here and forever your mad pursuit of vengeance; to give up your insane- scheme of delivering Paris; to release Cocoon from his obligation; to love him, if you can; to treat him honorably, as you ought!"  "Yes," said Margaret, dreamily, in a hard, cheerless, unsympathetic voice, "I have been wild, foolish, wicked.  There seemed nothing to live for save this vengeance; but I will give it up; I will renounce all these mad en- deavors to'help the beleaguered Parisians yonder. I absolve you, Cocoon, from the obligation to which you have so nobly devoted yourself; I absolve you from the sway of the talisman; I entreat you to make no fur- ther effort for me in this insane mission. It is not too late to be saved. See," she cried wildly, taking fromn her bosom a packet of papers, similar to that which the S   COCOON SEES CLEARLY.      261 Prussian had seized, and holding them up before the light; "see here; in this little package lies hidden the intelligence which might save France if it were conveyed into Paris, and an answer promptly re- turned to Orleans. The whole story of the s! ge would be different; the starving people would be fed, and the invaders would be crushed: but it is too late, and I will burn themn, and renounce this mission for evermore." She held them towards the candelabra; but, at this moment, Cocoon rushed impetuously forward, snatched them from her hands, and cried,- "No, Margaret, there is nothing left in life for me now, for I know that you do not love me; that your whole heart and soul is given to yonder friend of mine, who, in his turn, loves you; whose only folly in life has been committed for you. I leave you together, and now come what come may, I will carry out the mis- sion which you have imposed upon me. No; do not stop me," he cried, in a terrible voice; "my illusions are all over; the last act of the comedy remains to be played, and I will play my rdle as faultlessly as I may. Good by," he said, grasping Margaret's hands, and covering them with kisses; "I am going through the  lines into Paris, or I am going to die!" He did not speak to Kentucky, but he turned one lingering look of love and respect upon him, and then was gone!  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7012-00000132"/> 262      IENTUCKY'S LOVE.  As he passed through the hall, his feet struck against something which rustled. Instinctively he  stooped and picked it up. It was the package of pa- pers, written in cipher, which he had brought from S London, which the Prussian had taken from him, but which, in his flight, the officer had thrown aside, fear- v , ing he might be tempted to disclose them, and thus bring upon himself the denunciation of his crime. Cocoon placed the package beside the other, and hastily fled out into the night. Margaret and Kentucky were left face to face. Be- fore the wearied and fevered man could repel her, she had approached him, placed her white arms about his neck, and murmured, -  "I will never leave you more. You, and you only, have I loved; all the rest is dreaming and vision. Let us never part again." Kentucky imperiously thrust her aside. "Margaret," he said, "you forget to whom you speak. Do not fancy that I have come here to lead you once more into the paths of love from which we have so long strayed. Stand back, and let me go;  for if I do not save yonder mad youth from his folly I shall curse you and myself forevermore!" She would have clung to him, but he called loudly for the servants. He placed her, fainting, in the arlms of her maid, and ran wildly out, looking in every di- rection for Cocoon.   THE LAST LEAP.       268 CHAPTER   XX. THE LAST LEAP. HE talisman, the precious locket, still hung about his neck. Cocoon smiled bitterly at the thought, but he grasped the bauble fiercely, kissed it ferociously, then replaced it tenderly next his heart. As he hur- fied towards his room, clutching the precious papers on which so much depended, he resolved that very night to make an attempt to pass the lines. Was it then attended with so much difficulty? He remem- bered that a servant had once told him that for seventy francs a certain Frenchman would undertake to carry letters into Paris - saying that there were only five minutes of danger. He would go to the park at St. Cloud, and try to swim the river at that place, where the ice was broken up, or to work quietly along to some point where the lines were close to- gether, and whence he c6uld make a bold dash. And what mattered it, indeed, if he lost his life in this mad scheme? The world looked very black and  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7012-00000133"/> -264     KENTUCIKYI'S LO VE. desolate before him, and he would willingly have i caught a glimpse of the infinite beyond.  He sat down in his room, and lighted a cigar. Smoking thoughtfully, it struck him that he could gain nothing by making his venture that night, but that by going to St. Cloud by day, he could perhaps gather information enough to enable him to pass sentinels and reach the river bank there or at Sevres on  the following evening. But Kentucky might follow  him? O, no! for Kentucky was now with his old   : love; and then the fearful tide of bitterness came rush- ing back through Cocoon's heart, and he could have wished to see Margaret and Kentucky crushed, swept out of life - annihilated. So violent were his eqno- tions, that he 'sprang to his feet, and threw aside his cigar. At this moment there was a knock at the door. Kentucky came in before Cocooli could respond. A sigh of relief burst from his fevered lips. He staggered to a chair and sat down.  "I - I -feared you were gone, as you -madly said -you would go - and I, I am not quite well!" His head fell forward upon his breast. Cocoon hurriedly supported him, and, seizing a cologne flask from the dressing table, held it to the fainting man's nostrils. Kentucky revived, and, grasping his friend's hand, said, faintly, - "Promise me you will not go on this wild, absurd   THE LAST LEAP.       265 mission, Cocoon! Margaret has renounced it, and you must." "No," said Cocoon, resolutely; 'she has only re- nounced it for your sake, as you have begged her to do for my sake. The obligation holds Wvith me, and I will fulfil it to the uttermost. Get to bed, Kentucky; your faceis burning up; and I will promise you to go nowhere this night; I will sit by your bedside, and watch you, my dear old friend." Their hands touched; there was the old responsive thrill. Kentucky's mind was at ease, and he allowed Cocoon to assist him to his chamber. As he un- dressed he shivered and paled, and then soon after complained of the intense heat. A raging fever was upon him ere he had been in bed an hour. Cocoon summoned the old English surgeon who was attached to an ambulance corps, and procured watchers. Mean- time he busied himself with preparations for his visit to St. Cloud, and his venture. In the afternoon, he asked the physician if Kentucky was worse; and the old gentleman said, encouragingly,- "No; better, rather. Your friend has a wonderful constitution. He has been under strong and prostrat- ing nervous excitement; but he will not have to go through a fever. In a few days he will be all right." Cocoon did not wait to hear any more. He sent for his horse, and was soon galloping towards St. Cloud.  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7012-00000134"/> It was a crisp winter day, and the trees which bor- dered the great avenues were frosted with delicate snow crystals. He urged his horse to a furious gallop, and, flourishing his headquarters-pass hastily before  various sentinels, drew. rein at Ville d'Avray, the charming little suburban nest of villas which the Parisians in time of peace so much affected, just as the man whom he most of all wished to see stepped out from a doorway, humming a rollicking German air, and lighted a huge cigar. "Why, it's Herr Cocoon!" said the man, who was a German surgeon stationed at Ville d'Avray; "and a have you come to sketch some of our surroundings? No sketches can you make here to-day, Herr Adven- turer; for everything is conducted in the most private manner, and I should be subjected to very severe treatment if the commandant knew that you had come to see me, and to make sketches. So!" This last ejaculation was uttered in a gratified manner, because Cocoon shook his head emphatically, and, dismounting, advanced to meet the surgeon. "No, my friend," he said. "I was lonely at Ver- sailles, and I thought a dinner with you in your cellar, with an occasional shell rattling over us, would relieve  my mind. Am I welcome?"  He was, and the surgeon, who had known Cocoon and his family in other days in America, led the way -   . ,       n Fa   TILE LAST LEAP.       267 to his quarters after having given orders to have the horse put in the securest possible place, with a "blanket over him, and something besides tree boughs to eat, d'ye hear!" The basements of all the villas at Ville d'Avray were tenanted by officers and soldiers quartered in the town. Not even the most adventurous of the number would have cared to spend a night in the upper rooms, because a deadly rain of missiles was night and day poured into the little town from the great French forts which had already demolished the palace of St. Cloud, and stricken down dozens of brave men. So galling was the fire at a little distance from the villa which Cocoon and the surgeon had ,entered, that men never walked in the open air, but had constructed huge trenches, covered with boughs, earth, and furni- ture, and along which they made their way from point poinoint. The soldiers had been burrowing in the ground, like animals, for months, and whenever they were forced to come into the light, blinked like owls. Acres of fine shade trees had been felled in all direc- tions, covering the ground so that there was only one narrow way by which an attacking party could approach. At one end of the long street running through Ville d'Avray was the gate of the St. Cloud Park, and from it ran an avenue terminating at the palace, but now filled with redoubts and chevaux-  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7012-00000135"/> 268      KENTUCKY'S LOVE.  de-frise. At the left, on entering the park, was a German soldier cemetery, with the helmets of the de- funct warriors laid in regular order upon the graves, and with quaint inscriptions carved or burned upon the wooden head-boards. Cocoon and the surgeon, after having refreshed themselves with a draught of wine, went to ramble a little in the trenches while the surgeon's servant pre- pared supper. They arrived after one or two narrow escapes from annihilation at the famous Stern Chanze - the redoubt which valiant warriors held, under such terrible punishment, all through the latter days of the siege. From this redoubt they entered a long trench, through a door made of woven green boughs, over which was written, in German script, - "O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, How faithful are thy branches!"' Ranged along the sides of the trench, at every-open- ing, were improvised sentry-boxes, some of which were  closets taken bodily from the neighboring villas, ori huge mahogany wardrobes, which had evidently done duty in the chambers of princes. The fire in the forts was terrific in its persistence; shells fell on the roof of the trenches, were hurled clattering against the trees into the park, overturned statues, smashed fountains, and sometimes threw a man, disjointed and bleeding, violently upon the frpzen earth. Now and then a : IsEA   THE LAST LEAP.;       269 sentinel would start suspiciously at the sight of a civilian, but the surgeon would quietly say, "Gentle- man from the royal headquarters," and all suspicions were speedily allayed. Cocoon carefully noted every turn in the trenches, for he was not certain but that he might be compelled to find his way through them alone, if he did not suc- ceed in finding any other way to the river bank in St. Cloud town. When he returned with the surgeon to the villa cellar at Ville d'Avray, and they sat cown to dinner, the German said,- - "You look disturbed, Herr Cocoon; were you flur- ried by the nearness of that last piece of shell!" Cocoon looked in the bit of broken glass, which the surgeon called his " mirror," and saw that he was indeed pale as death, and that his features were distorted with the agony which he felt, now that Margaret was lost to him. He mastered his emotion with a strong effort, and said,- "It must be the cold ; I am chilled through, and yet it is not by any means as frigid as when I was last here. But I have not slept well latterly." In taking his seat at the table, Cocoon's eye fell upon a paper, which the surgeon hastily removed with a muttered apology. "That is waiting for the officer who rooms here with me," he said. It was the general orders for the day; and Cocoon's  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7012-00000136"/> -L ^^44A UAv LA OVE.           - quick eye had caught the words upon it, and welcomed them eagerly. His face lit up with hope. The words were, " Countersign: Wilhelm." Now his way was clear. He ate and drank fiercely, and amused the surgeon with many a quaint anecdote. The evening wore away without adventure. Various officers arrived, and the talk was of wars and battles. Finally, Cocoon was shown a little corner of the kitchen, where straw had been spread for him. He threw his blanket over it, and lay down for an llour. Then suddenly arising, just as the company had de- parted, and the surgeon was drowsy on his extempore couch, he muttered, "I must look a little after my horse," and hurried out of the house. When he re- turned, the surgeon and the officer who roomed with him were asleep.    He caught up the sword, overcoat, and cap of the officer, which had been thrown  upon a chair, hurriedly donned them, and again left the house. He gained the redoubt without difficulty, and then boldly entered the trenches. A sentinel challenged  him.  He  responded, ad- vanced, gave the countersign, and was allowed to pass. A second and third time he was equally suc- cessfhu.  At last he came to an opening in the trench. He  stepped out through it into the open ail; and regardless of shell-fire, hurried along  an avenue  en- cumnbered by fallen trees, until he reached the garden  THE LAST LEAP.       271 and the palace. As he approached the great fountain, the forts suddenly broke into loud and defiant barking, and a rain of crushing missiles fell so profusely that the soldiers on guard about the palace instinctively ran to and fro, panic-stricken, and 'seeking shelter. Cocoon took advantage of the confusion to rush forward to the very front of th I    ss thou   the palace, to pass thro the gateway leading into the town, and to rapidly descend the drive- way towards the river. A lurid light smote upon his vision. The town of St. Cloud was on fire. The old H  otel de la Tcte Noire, where Cocoon had happily dined so many times when he was a poor and merry Paris student, was in flames. Away on the bill, where the elegant villas of the rich Parisians and strangers were located, great jets of flame sprang up against the Winter heavens, and long clouds of smoke drifted across the crystal sky. Every moment lines of fire, traililg over the town, announced the arrival of a new volley of shells from the French forts; and when the deflat masses of bursting iron fell among the ruins of the burning houses, they sent up great showers of sparks and cinders, which, borne on the wings of the malig- nant breeze, kindled new conflagrations. The horizon was studded with fires; the air was filled with the clamor of cannon and the hiss of bombs. A few for- lorn French people were rambling insanely through the streets, crying and wringing their hands.  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7012-00000137"/> 272      KENTUCKY'S LOVE.          SB Cocoon made all haste towards the bank of the river. He was determined to plunge into the cold current, and to swim across. In ten minutes, then, he could be in the French lines, and demand to be taken before General Trochu. At last! His heart danced with joy, and he uttered an exultant cry, as he saw  that at the point nearest the great fragment of the bridge which had once spanned the river, there was no sentinel! le ran faster than before, leaped on to the parapet, jumped down, spraining his right arm in the fall, and stood on the bank of the river.  The dark current flowed sluggishy at his feet, and  seemed to him more like the entrance to a tomb than like a simple stream which he could safely swim over. But he did not hesitate; he threw off his coat, the  sword, and the cap, and bared his arms. He was a sinewy youth, and bred at the waterside. He would make little of a swim across the Seine.  Then he felt in his breast for the packets of precious cipher papers on which his mission depended. They were gone! Cocoon stood for a moment, looking at the water with a stupid stare, his whole brain paralyzed by this sudden and terrible misfortune. The papers gone! Then his life was gone with them, for he would never return to Margaret; no, not even to defiantly and for- 3ver bid her good by, without having accomplished the nission. The papers gone!   TIE LAST LEAP.        273 Ier pure, sweet face arose before him, and seemed to urge him on to madness. There it floated, divinely chaste, radiantly beautiful; and now was gone again. He could not clasp it to his breast, and toy with the golden hair. The same sweet, pleading smile, the same inspiring eyes, the same superb mouth, with the curves of tender melancholy upon the beautiful lips - all the cherished features were there. Margaret, Mar- garet! But the vision faded, and again came the deadening, the heart-rending reality -the pccpers were gone! Margaret! His whole soul rang to the music of those three syllables. The whizzing shells seemed to re-echo them; the strange ringing in his ears resounded to them; the blood in his veins leaped riotously to them; the dark, wintry river seemed to ripple them. Margaret, Margaret! Lost Margaret! While he stood thus, despairing, a second figure ap- peared on the bank, and coring from the direction of Sevres. It kept close to the embankment, as if afraid of being seen by the sentinels above, and, half crouch- ing, half erect, glided, with cat-like noiselessness, until it came into the shadow of the dark arch of the bridge, under which Cocoon stood. It stumbled against some- thing, stopped, picked it up, examined it minutely in the darkness; then, with a smothered cry, sprang for- ward to where Cocoon was standing, with his face 18  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7012-00000138"/> 274      KENTUCKY'S LOVE.  bowed upon his hands, and his limbs trembling with  anguish. The figure did not hesitate for a moment; it seemed to recognize Cocoon by instinct; stepped forward, and  laid its right hand upon the young man's shoulder. Cocoon turned hurriedly, and a revolver gleamed in his hand; but the moment he saw by whom he was  confronted, he threw the weapon into the river, and ! put his hands behind him. Cocoon was face to face with Kentucky.  There was a wild light in the gaunt American's eye.  His voice trembled, as he said, "(I feared as much. I  knew you would attempt something of the sort. May God pity you, my boy. What have you done? I felt  t certain that you had gone back to Ville d'Avray, and so I eluded my physician and the watchers, dressed, took carriage to Sevres, ran the sentinels with these miraculous correspondent-passes, came along the river bank, and found you by accident. Heaven knows how I should have got to Ville d'Avray! Here I am. Foolish boy, did you think that I would let you rush i upon your fate, while I had a nerve or a muscle left? Come back with me. We may be arrested, and it may go hard with us; but we can explain ourselves. Any- thing is better than this folly. Come!"       b Cocoon raised his white face, and gazed earnestly at Kentucky.   THE LAST LEAP.       275 "No," he said, '"my dear old friend. The Fates are against me, as they have been ever since I received this fateful locket from the hand of the dying spy at Enghien! No! I have lost Margaret, I have lost my self-respect, and -O God! I have lost the papers upon which my mission depended. Go back, and leave me here to die alone!" Kentucky tightened his grasp upon Cocoon's shoulder. He held up the packet of papers which he had just found., "Yes,' he said, in a tone broken by emotion, "my poor friend, you dropped these papers as you came down here, and I found them a moment ago there!" pointing to the foot of the parapet; "Fate has or- dained that you should be saved, despite yourself. Look, Cocoon! thus I throw these accursed papers, which but serve as a snare to you and Margaret, into the Seine; thus I dispel the charm; thus I destroy and annihilate the mission! O my friend, come back with me, ere it is too late." As he spoke he hurled the packets into the Seine, and they were borne away on the current. Cocoon trembled violently, and would have fallen; but Kentucky supported him. Then he disengaged himself from his firm but friendly grasp by a violent effort, and rushed to the brink.  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7012-00000139"/> 276      KENTUCIKY'S LOVE. "Stand back," he cried; " you, my best friend, have  ruined my life forevermore! You have taken my love, you have destroyed my honor, and I now go away from a world which no longer has any charms for me!  Margaret!" With these words he sprang quickly into the dark water, and Kentucky as instantly sprang after him.  As the latter swam desperately and boldly hither and yon in the darkness, he saw a white face rise sudden- ? ly out of the stream, saw two arms thrown straight up towards the sky, heard one long, bubbling cry of  "Margaret;" then the face disappeared, and Kentucky knew that his friend Cocoon was drowned in the depths of the Seine.

She had been twisting her white hands together in a helpless way, and turning her face from me to hide the tears which fell thickly from her dimmed and sorrowful eyes. But now she turned as she had turned upon Moltke, when hethought to entrap her; like a lioness at bay! "Alas! even your friendship is not left me!" she said, bitterly; "and yet, God help me, I do not know that I have done wrong. I did not know my own heart. I was wild. I was athirst for vengeance. Do not look at me so savagely. Do you think me a criminal'?" "No," I said, calmly; "but I cannot refrain, Mar- garet, from feeling bitterly moved against you. Every time the remembrance of that white face, rising up out of the dark water, and those dying lips uttering your  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7012-00000140"/> 278     IKENTUCKY'S LOVE. name, come before me, I cannot think of you with love. The terrible picture Kentucky drew of Co- coon's death still clings at my heart. But I will try to forgive you." And I held out my hand. Margaret burst into a torrent of weeping, and hid her face in her hands. Her agony of soul was ter- rible to contemplate. The death of Cocoon had shaken the very foundations of her being; and when Kentucky arrived with the terrible burden, brought it to her, hissed its fate in her ear, and cursed her, I feared that she would go mad. Her brain reeled under the stroke, but finally withstood it. iI On that fateful night, when Kentucky had seen his friend drowned, the Parisians were preparing their final desperate attempt for a sortie, and at early morning were moving against the Prussian lines with a determination which they had never felt before. Kentucky, who had crawled into a corner of the re- cess near the arch of the bridge, after he had swam despairingly to shore, lay in a kind of. stupor there until morning, when he heard the rapid and excited firing which betokened a general attack; and his mind was at once alert and attentive. The firing by platoons came nearer; grew momentarily more im- posing. He staggered to his feet, and wandered to  the river's brink, hoping that he might perhaps find b   MAR GARET AND KENTUCKY.     279 some relic of Cocoon. But he saw nothing, and was blindly, aimlessly stumbling forward, when there came into his mind some thought of the garments which lay beside Cocoon when he found him on the river bank. He retraced his steps, and found the officer's Cap, overcoat, and sword, lying where the youth had thrown them. "I will put them  on," thought he, "and thus escape detection; for if any sentinel sees that I have been in the river, I shall be roughly used." Hie donned the garments and set off for Sevres. The morning was crisp and cool; the air was fiagrant and inspiring; even the humming, the whirring of the shells had something cheery in it. But his heart beat only to the refrain of the last desperate words Cocoon had uttered ere he took his fatal leap. Not far along the river bank he saw two men draw- ing something from the stream. He ran hastily towards them, and cried out, in German, to wait. As he came up, breathless, one of the men knelt beside the body, saying, in German,-- "Poor fellow! he must have been insane. The last time I saw him, I feared that his mind was affected." The body of Cocoon lay on the bank before Ken- tucky, and over it knelt the good German surgeon, from whom Cocoon had fled atVille d'Avray. His comrade was the officer whose garments Cocoon had taken to aid him in his flight,'and in which Kentucky was now clothed!  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7012-00000141"/> 280      KENTUCKJl'S LOVE. O Kentucky knelt reverently beside the surgeon, and placed his, hand upon his shoulder. "You are'right, Herr Doctor," he said; "Cocoon was mad. He ran away firom me at Versailles, and I followed him at the risk of my life, until I found him on yonder bank. He fancied he had a mission to go into Paris, poor lost youth!"And then Kentucky told the good sur- geon, who at once recognized him as the friend he had so often seen with Cocoon, the story ofthe death. "He wore these garments," said Kentucky, "I sup- pose, for I found them lying on the bank, and I put them on to escape detection, for I look suspicious  enough in my own wet clothes."  The officer at the surgeon's side gravely touched his hat, then pointed to the fatigue uniform he wore, and motioned to Kentucky to keep on the garments, 'but to hand him the sword. Then they took up the dead body, and bore it to the edge of the park. An ambulance litter was pro- cured, and four soldiers were commissioned to bear  it through the park to Ville d'Avray. "I must take it to Versailles," muttered Ken- tucky, sternly; "and Margaret must look upon it." The surgeon gave him dry clothes, and forced him to eat. Life was cheap in those bustling days, in front of Paris; and the rumor that a dead man had been   MARGARET AND KENTUCKY.      281 found in the Seine that morning did not create much conmment among the soldiery. Who was it? They did not know: some army follower, they believed, and doubtless served him right for his foolhardiness. So Kentucky came back to Versailles with the dead Cocoon, in an ambulance wagon. He arrived in the Avenue de Paris at noon, and drove straight to the door of Margaret's mansion. She, overwhelmed with grief and suspense, had been watching from the win- dows night and day since the departure of Kentucky and Cocoon; and I, who had called to entreat her to tell me where our friends had gone, remained with her when I had heard the sad story. -All the forenoon we had felt a mysterious dread, and when Margaret saw the ambulance stop before her door, she gave a wild scream, and rushed to the hall. As she threw open the door, a gaunt, ghastly figure, with eyes gleaming with unearthly fire, staggered up to her, and caught her by the wrist. It dragged her down the steps, to the ambulance, raised the curtain, and said fiercely, - "Margaret, look upon your work." Her mission was over. She saw her folly now, and she turned away with a frightened moan, and entered the house. Kentucky gave orders that the body be borne to Madame Varlin's, and followed it thither, after urging me to remain with Margaret until he should return.  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7012-00000142"/> 282     KENTtUCKKY'S LO VE. In two hours he came back. "In a week," he said, "I leave Versailles forever; and, Margaret, we must never meet again."  He stood before her with the same wild fire in his  eye that Margaret had first noticed when he had in- terposed to save her from the Prussian major's ven- geance; his gaze was not fixed upon her, but on some-  thing beyond.  Suddenly an inexpressibly dreamy tenderness came into his voice. "I did love you, Margaret," he said, "Iong ago; why have the Fates so crossed us, and punished us both so bitterly for our folly? Are we doomed? Hush!" he said, pointing vaguely into air;  "do you not see the Fates that pursue us? I can see the  dead Regnier crying out against me because I did not  avenge his death; and I can see Cocoon's pale face appealingly upturned. Too late, Cocoon! too late!" "No, no," I cried, in a frightened voice, "not too late, Kentucky: look up, old friend! Do you not know me?"  He made a step towards Margaret, and fell, as if struck by lightning! Kentucky was stricken down with that terrible dis- ease of which long exposure had sown the seeds in his huge, strong frame - a disease which takes away one's power over his limbs, and sends him reeling and   MARGARET AND KENTUCKY.       283 trembling hither and yon, instead of marching erect and firmly. The mad excitements of the campaign in the American rebellion, and the late struggles through which he had passed, had laid him prostrate, and he seemed smitten forever. Margaret watched beside him every hour, never asking a word of tenderness, and pardoning him all the terrible curses which in his delirium he heaped upon her. Each day her face grew whiter; each day new lines were set about the beauti- ful lips; and the white hands were tightly clenched as if vainly trying to strangle some old memory. Cocoon was buried in the Prussian cemetery, as a quiet nook was found there which I fancied might be made to bloom in summer time, and where profound tranquillity reigned. Margaret and I had been to visit the grave, and had just returned to learn that Kentucky was no longer delirious. She had just appealed to me for sympathy in her great trouble as we entered the long drawing-room, and were about to enter Kentucky's sick chamber. I have said that she wept bitterly, and the tears, so hastily summoned, seemed to relieve her heart. As she rose and looked at me, at last, with far more peace in her eyes than I had seen there for many a day, a voice called feebly from the inner chamber,- "Margaret!  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7012-00000143"/> 284      KEVNTUCKY 'S L O VE. She sprang forward, with a new light in her face, and hastened to the bedside. I was called next. Kentucky sat up in bed, his eyes no longer filled with the mad, restless fire which had so many times frightened us, but with a tender light, which boded only peace and good will. Margaret stood before him, her hands clasped, and her eyes fixed with chaste yet passionate admiration upon him whom she had at last learned to love above all others. "I tell Maargaret," he said, speaking to me, " that I  feel that I have wronged her more bitterly than she has wronged me; and I am sorry. H- Margaret - I - let us wipe the past out like a scroll, and write some new pages in this book of life. I am harmless now, child," he said, with a quaint smile, as lie thought of his crippled condition, "and I cannot afford to be your enemy." My heart was glad, and I motioned to Margaret to takie the hand which he held out tremblingly to her. He fell back upon the pillow exhausted, and closed his eyes; but her arms were thrown about his neck, her lips murmured -his name; and in the dim vista of the shadowy future, I could see them walking hand in hand. '            -               w   MAR GARET AND KE"NTUCKIY.     285 Kentucky grew better rapidly. He could never be thoroughly well again, said the physicians; but he might regain the use of his limbs, and live on happily. Margaret was at his side during all his waking hours, and at last Kentucky one day told me that they were never to be separated again. ( We are neither of us angels," he said, in his old satiric tone; "but we are very respectable people; try and love us, if you can." When Capitulation Day came, Kentucky was so much improved that we allowed him to sit at an open window, and watch the great masses of troops return- ing from the posts assigned them before Paris during the day. The evening was cool, and there was a slight mist; but Kentucky, securely wrapped up, insisted on the fresh air; and the clank of the sabres, the rattle of the musketry upon the ground, the thunderous refrains of the regimental music drifted into the drawing-room. Serried lines of steel flashed sharply by under the waning light, and rough voices rolled out Teutonic songs of triumph. The sullen Versaillaise lingered at the sides of the avenue, scowling at the conquerors. The cannon-thunder was hushed, and its absence was almost painful.            ! "By the way," said Kentucky, turning to me, and speaking in an undertone, "have you heard that the major, who was so intent on avenging himself upon  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7012-00000144"/> 286      KENTUCKr'S LO VE. Margaret and poor Cocoon, was killed in the fight of the 21st of January?" "Is it possible?"I said; eagerly.  "Quite. The surgeon from Ville d'Avray was here  yesterday, and told me so. Killed dead in a fearful  mnl6e at Montretout." Margaret had overheard Kentucky's words.  A  spasm of pain contracted her features, as the news of the death of Charles Regnier's murderer recalled to  her all the sorrowful and eventful past. She turned away, and walked towards the piano. Presently, as the last regiment had defiled past, and all was still in the avenue, the sonorous measures of the Newport waltz rang through the drawing-room. But into the triumph, and the glory, and the yearning of passionate desire so familiar to us were woven new themes of faith, and patience, and love, of chastened  sorrow and earnest aspiration. The pure notes drifted, now languidly, now with wild fervor, upon the air. None of the old defiance lingered in them; and in the closing refi'ain, in which, of old, the bugles rang out so cheerily and clamorously, Margaret introduced a sim- ple ballad, full of sincerest sorrow and tenderest re- gret, which brought us both to her side. The tears gathered in Kentucky's eyes. I knew that he was thinking of Cocoon. But he took the fair woman's hand in his, and looked lovingly upon her. o   S i   MAR GARET AND KENTUCKY.       287 "Margaret, my love," he said, "your spirit has been changed.
