I like everybody." "Then why can't you have him?" "Agnes, Agnes, you really suffer for a scolding; and, if I could only keep my countenance long enough, I would give it you. In the first place, he has not asked me." "But when he does ask you?" "And, in the second place, he will not." "Oh, why? How I wish I could ever tell what people mean from what they say! Now, I think you only say that to me because I am only eleven,-to put me off."  "No, I do not. Even if there were no other reason, ' Mr. Vernon would not offer himself to me, because I should not let him." "How could you help it?" "By never giving him a chance. Come here, minxy, (3)  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7379-00000004"/> 4      AGNES WENT WORTH. and sit on my knee, and take those great eyes of yours out of mine; and, when you are a woman, remember what I tell you now: women of honor don't often receive many offers that they do not accept." "I don't understand." "No; how should you? You are quite too young to think about such things. Do you understand that?" "No," answered Agnes, absently, her mind still laboring with her elder sister's maxim. "When Cousin Etta Van Rooselandt stayed here last winter, she said she had had seven offers; and how could she accept more than one?" A cloud came over Rosamond Wentworth's charm- ing, mirthful, Hebe face. She looked half anxious, half disgusted. "Dear little sister," said she, "I have been talking with you in play, because it amused me for once to get at some of your little ideas; but, in good earnest, these are not pretty things to talk about; and you won't talk about them another time, will you? -especially not with Etta Yan Rooselandt?" "Why, she's our own cousin! Isn't she good?" "Not a good companion for you." "Then isn't she for you?" asked Agnes, wrinkling up her white marble dome of a forehead with a very anxious expression. "I can't well help myself," murmured Rosamond, to herself as much as to Agnes; but, looking down and seeing her unwonted gravity reflected in the little' wistful, mobile countenance before her, she instantly added, "Never mind, little angel; there's nothing for you to be troubled about. Only, for the future, when   A GNES WEFNT WORTH.       5 people begin to talk about such things before you, walk off, if you don't want to be turned into a little imp; and hold your own little innocent tongue." "Only not to you, dearest Rosamond,--only not to you,-only this once!" cried Agnes, sliding through her sister's arms to her feet, and clinching her knee with her own clasped hands. "Oh, Rosamond, this once let me- speak; and then, if you must kill my one hope in life, I will build a cold, stony tomb of silence over it. Oh, Rosamond, you are so beautiful and goody! He is so noble! He will be so great! He will be a glorious painter. You would be his wife. He would be my brother. He would paint for you. You would work for him. I would help you. He would make fame for you. You would make happi- ness for him. We would go to Italy, and get away from all the dress and fuss and people here, and lead such a beautiful free life. When visitors came, they would be artists, too, and not tell about law cases and cheating, or eating and scandal, but the splendid statues and pictures and temples they were doing. But if you disappoint him it will break his heart. He will die; and there will be the end." "Agnes, Agnes, hush! You are out of your wits. Get up; somebody will come in and hear you. Don't you know how you hate to work?" "There is nothing I couldn't do in a noble cause,- except, perhaps, backstitch and run." "Don't you remember you asked mre, when I was married, to give you a black pony?", "Yes; and you said you would." "Very well; people must keep their promises. Now, 1'  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7379-00000005"/> rC      A AGNES WENT WTIORTH. if I married a poor artist, I couldn't give you a black pony. " "Well; but-aren't there a good many donkeys in Italy?" "Plenty, I believe; but I am not going to be one of them, little dear, nor his wife." And Rosamond gave Ag nes a kiss, and ran away from her with the prettiest laugh in the world. Agnes and Rosamond Wentworth, sisters as they were and fondly attached to one another, were almost strangers. They had been separated for the most part from the very birth of the younger, by one of those rash and arbitrary death-bed dispensations which the departed-if they were not forbid-might gladly leave the joys of paradise, or, on pain of tenfold penalties, burst the gates of the eternal prison, to come back and undo. Their mother was a pretty, shallow little belle from New York, and unhappy, lonely, and homesick in Bos- ton. Mr. Wentworth, a dry, honorable, able, sarcastic man, was proud of her grace and beauty, and, in his way, fond of her. But she was no companion for him; and his fondness exhibited itself chiefly in his im- mersing himself from morning till night, and almost from night till morning, in business, that he might make the more money for her to spend. She did-not object to the money; she did so, however, to the appar- ent neglect on his part, and solitude on her own, through which it was won. She pined for her " dear New York." Her chief thought was, to secure her own old light-hearted life there to her little pet six-year- old Rosamond, when she felt herself sickening and   A GNES WEVNTW 0ORTH.       7 foreboded that it might be unto death. She demanded and obtained her husband's promise, that if it should prove so-be had no idea that it would-her favorite sister, the wife of Mr. Egmont Van Roosela ndt, should have the little beauty for her own. Her baby, Agnes, was born; but she did not live to see it. Mrs. Wentworth would probably have known the character of Mrs. Van Rooselandt but imperfectly, even if, at the-time of her marriage, her sister's char- acter had been formed for her to know; but probably it was not. Most people who attain to the perfection of worldliness, like most who attain to the perfection of saintliness, do so, I imagine, by degrees. A merci- ful Providence allows many of us a good deal of time to consider our ways before we reach the end of them. The young aunt, I always heard, made a detour from a tour of- pleasure to claim her charge, and bore it off to her home, covered with kisses and with tear's. Later in life, when I had the melancholy pleasure of making her acquaintance, Mrs. Van Rooselandt seemed, indeed, to love the world beyond anything; but next best-even beyond her own daughters, they said-she loved Rosamond Wentworth. The Misses Van Roose- landt said, further, that they did not blame -her for it; nor did T. Miss Rosamond must have had a rarely delightful nature to have so much of it remain delight- ful after so much of it-must have been spoiled by the domestic and social atmosphere in which she lived. She was frank, brave, clever, gay, and kind, and walked through many frivolities and follies comparatively un- scathed, enshrined in a native dignity which never for- sook her. Lastly, to descend from generals to partic-   &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7379-00000006"/> 8      A AGNES FWE2TW'OR TTI. ulars, if she did always urge her mother's dying request, and her father's promise, as an excuse for not exchanging her aunt's gay household and incessant festivities for her quiet natural home in Boston and the care of her younger sister, still, her bi-yearly visits and pettings made the most exciting episodes in the ro- mance of Agnes's childhood. Of Agnes, we shall know more by and by. At that time, one would have said there was not much to know of her, but a plain, thin, pale little school-girl, with short, dim flaxen hair, and a striped gingham frock. CHAPTER    II. As to the subject of the conversation with which our chronicle begins,-Mr. Ernest Vernon,-he did like Miss Wentworth, and more than like her. He was all ready to propose himself to her; and she would not give him a chance. He did mean to be a painter, and perhaps would become a glorious one. At pres- ent, however, he was nothing more nor less than a senior at college, and a pretty sick olie at that. Play- ing at genius, it had pleased him to over-smoke and under-sleep himself, under-eat and over-work himself; and he was now lying in a brain-fever in the chamber overhead. Walter Wentworth, his classmate, and the brother of Agnes and Rosamond, had invited him home to pass a Sunday, in hopes that the little change of air and scene would help him to throw off his head-   AGNES WENT WORTH.        9 ache; and there his headache had thrown him on his back. He saw everything wrong. He felt everything wrong. The flowers glowered upon him out of the wall-paper in his shaded room, mimicked ugly old witches, and made wicked old faces at him. Then his sofa, for he had resisted-up to this time success- fully-being kept in his bed, every minute or two metamorphosed itself into a rack in one of the cells of the Inquisition. The rack, to be sure, did not hurt him so much as he expected. It only made him tingle a little and feel rather numb. But just as he had his mind made up to it, it turned over with him, and dropped him in a bed of live coals.- The coals, again, did not burn him very severely;--this he attributed to the numbness previously produced by the rack;-in fact, the sensation of them was scarcely more acute than that caused by a mustard plaster; and he had some idea of having heard Dr. Brodie say, some days or weeks or years before, that such a plaster might remove the Inquisition-or " the irritation ;" he could not remember which. But, at any rate, how- ever much fortitude a man might have, it was trying never to know what was coming next, and just as you became used to one thing, and had summoned up lall your resolution to bear that without hallooing and alarming the whole house; to have it "Suffer a something change Into something rich and strange." Still, his sufferings were made tolerable to him by, the fact that they were all endured for Rosamond  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7379-00000007"/> 10      AGNXES WENTWORTH. Wentworth. In order to cover her escape from them, he was enduring them in her stead, in the flounced pink silk dress-terribly tight he found it--in which he last saw her, and with her wreath of roses pinned fast to his scalp with long thorns, which he had not happened to remark when she wore them. His hearing, meantime, was affected only by being intensely quickened. He could hear the bells ring, and the servants go up and down stairs, and so forth and so forth, in the houses all along the south side of Beacon Street from Park Street to School Street. Thus it happened that he heard the whole of the above conversation. He had no way to put a stop to it, nor wits enough left to stop his own ears, as he would at least have tried to do, if he had had his senses prop- erly; for, whatever else he was or was not at this tinme, a more gentlemanly fellow I never knew. Thus it happened again that, when Dr. Brodie paid him a second visit that day, he found him sinking. CHAPTER    III. "EFT to herself, little Agnes fidgeted up and down the room. Her talk with her sister had not only dis- appointed, but unsettled her. The idea that "life" must be "a system of compromises," for the first time dawned, though dimly, upon her mind. Such it must, in a measure, be to us all. The only question for us is, how to surrender the low to the higher,-the-worse   A GNES WENTWORTH.        " to the best. Oh, that we could only find out any way to be quite unworldly, and still to ride our hobbies I Could Rosamond be a mercenary young lady? How shocking! But then a black pony,-how delightful 1 --with a   long tail, thick mane, and an easy cantert How Agnes would sweep along into Elysium upon l him, and fancy herself a princess riding to war against wicked giants, or an angel flying over clouds and stars, or-but never mind. Great pictures were nobler things than little ponies-; they lasted longer and did more people good. And then to have poor, pleasant Mr. Vernon break his heart, and dear kind Watty lose his best friend! Oh, she would tell Rosy, of course, it was no matter about the pony! But then she was afraid even that would do no good. She could not un- derstand Rosamond. Young people could not expect to understand old ones; and Rosy was very old,- eighteen. Agnes wished she were a beauty like Rosamond, or  a genius like Mr. Vernon,-or something. It was " so horrid not to be anything at all, and never going to be." She stamped to and fro in her walking-shoes, and checked herself reproachfully, remembering the sick man's head. She went on tiptoe to the window, and looked out at the near graves of the Granary Burying- Ground.- Then she stood before the looking-glass, twisted her little fingers in her fore-locks, and wished they curled naturally. Agnes Qetested fineries, but had a natural leaning towards everything that was -at once simple and pretty. The door opened softly; and a talli red-haired, and red-freckled man-servant said consequentially in one  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7379-00000008"/> 12      A GNES WENTWORTH. burst of elegant volubility, "Miss Agnes, Miss Went- worth desires me to say that, if you will immediate repair to her apartment, she will personally supervise your toilet and conduct you in the kerridge to the feat o' Sham Peter to Watertown." It is to be hoped he attributed the ecstasy which flashed over Agnes's countenance to that which really caused half of it, the prospect of the fete champetre and of going out for once with her sister She scampered up-stairs with the noiseless nimbleness of a squirrel, and tapped at Rosamond's door. Rosamond opened it, in her white frilled wrapper, and said, "Now shut your eyes." "Shut my eyes! What for?" cried Agnes, obeying notwithstanding. "Oh, Rosy, what shall I put on?" "Nothing," answered Rosamond, leading and guid- ing her in. "I'm going to dress you myself this time, my little dolly, and see what can be made of you. Now, will you keep your eyes shut?" "Yes. What fun V! "Whatever happens?" "If I possibly can. I wonder what you are going to do to me."' "Nothing dreadful," said Rosamond, " whatever the effect mav be." And for some time she did nothing worse than comb and card Agnes's flax smoothly and gently, and stroke it into glossiness with her soft, steady, plump hand. "I shall go to sleep." "t I shall wake you presently," said Rosamond, let- ting her alone for a moment. "Now hold your head still."   A GNES WENTTWORTH.       13 "Oh, Rosy, I smell hot iron! Do take care. Can't I open my eyes?" "No, no. Remember, you promised. I'll take the best possible care of you;--there. " ".I know you've been pinching my hair." "'W hat an idea!5" "Now mayn't I look?" "Not yet:--before a great while, though. Now this gloomy old frock must come off." "I smell something sweet, like lilies." i "With your nose, or your imagination?"' "Only mly eyes could tell that.5" "Well, you may use them now. " "Who's that picture in the glass?-Why, Rosy, it's I!" The deep, bright, pure rose-color that bloomed in the little girl's pale cheeks only in momlents of rare ex- citement, gushed into theln nrow, and helped to justify her sister's infallible genius for dress and her own de- light. "You do look very pretty!"' cried Rosamlond, tri- umphantly; and she was too polite, even to a child, to add, "for once." "Rosamond, you are a fairy godmother; and, while nmy eyes were shut, you touched me with a wand." "Which smelt like curling-tongs?'" "I had no dress like this; where did you get it?" "Out of fairy-land, to be sure, or else out of one of mline. t "One I stepped on and tore,-I remember. What a dear good sister! But who made it for lue?" "Your fairy godmother, if that is I." "But when?"' 2  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7379-00000009"/> "      AG-TES WENTIWORTH. "Whien yoll were asleep." "How much time and trouble it must have taken!" "People must take somle time and trouble about dress, if they want pretty looks, you see, Agnes." "That's a pity; only the lilies don't: oh, how sweet these are!" Agnes stood still, gazing into the Psyche in artless gratitude and pure artistic pleasure. She saw a slight, straight little figure, with all its angles and hard out- lines rounded and softened into grace by the folds of full, translucent, green muslin, that terminated only at the wrist and throat in white gauzy frills. Up and down the middle of the waist was fixed, with pre- Raphaelite precision, a single stalk of white garden- lilies, with their buds and green leaves; they are diffi- cult flowers to arrange, but defied Rosamond's invin- cible fingers in vain. On the head rested lightly a tiny plain straw hat with a white dove's wing fixed in it, according to the pretty fashion (prevalent since, but I believe then first invented by Rosamlond Wentworth) which makes children look like little Mercuries. Be- neath peeped wondering out, Agnes's very peculiar but very expressive and interesting face, softened, shaded, and enlivened almost into beauty. If ever beautiful, however, it must be so in defiance of rule; regular it was not, and could never be. The forehead was too high and broad for that. A profes- sional hair-dresser would probably have plastered the hair down over it, and made Agnes look as if she wore a wig. Rosamond, being an amateur extraordinary, did no such thing. She saw how very smooth, white, and finely moulded the frontispiece in question was,   AGNES IWRNTIVORTH.        15 and how piquant was the contrast of its noble in- tellectuality with the infanltine character of the rest of the face. Therefore she contented herself with merely setting it in a frame of pale golden curls, which if not natural " meritaient bien de lletre,l' and harmo- nized well with Agnes's large, clear, amber-colored eyes. The June sunset, glowing through the oriel, made a background for the child; and she looked as ethereal as a little Saint Agnes in a stained glass window. Rosamond meanwhile was hurrying on her own re- sumled dressing. "Pull the bell, darling, will you?" "Let me help you, dear Rosy; oh, do!" "No, thank you; you'd tumble your frock " Agnes rang; and up came her Yankee nurse, looking, as that excellent woman usually did, as if life had brought her something bitter to take and she had swallowed it, but it did not agree with her. "Can I assist you, Miss Wentworth?" "' Yes, please, Mrs Tibbets; fasten my dress. Doesn't your baby look pretty?"1 "She doos, very pooty indeed--the back o' the head," added nurse, bringing herself up short. She spoke the truth when she began; but she was one of those edifying religionists who think it proper to equivocate a little now and then-not to say to tell some fibs--for righteousness' sake. Practically, she was delighted to see her charge so well set off. Theo- retically, she thought it incumbent upon her to lose no opportunity, in her charge's presence, of bearing her testimony against vanity. Rosamond took it as a joke, and laughed. Poor little Agnes took it literally, and could have  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7379-00000010"/> I 6     A GTnES WENVTWORTIt. cried. Was she really herself so very ugly, that--after Rosy had taken so much pains with her, and certainly made her look better than she ever did before in her life--not even her own nursey could say that, even for this single once, she looked pretty? She could not see for herself that she was any uglier than people in gen- eral; but then it was said that people never could see themselves. But then how could Rosy say she looked pretty? Oh, dear, how hard it always was to get at the real truth of things I At all events, her poor little rare pleasure at the Psyche was spoiled; she was ashamed to look in it any more. She turned from it and came up to the dressing-table. "The coach has not come, I hope, Mrs. Tibbets?" said Rosamond, leaning back to have her shawl laid over her shoulders; "I heard the door-bell, I thought, some time ago." "No'm : 'twas the doctor." "Oh11, what did he say?" cried Agnes, looking up. "Well, he said that young Mr. Vernin's a pooty sick man; he wants him to have beef-tea every hour," answered nurse, as sepulchrally as if the prescription had been the lyrical " cup of cold p'ison." "Poor fellow!" said Rosamond, taking up her fan. "Is there any beef in the house, I wonder?" "Not much of any; John said he'd go for more, as soon as he'd done his knives." "I had better stop the coach and order it as we go by; there is a butcher's shop in Charles Street, isn't there? AWhy, Agnes, don't sit down so, childy. See her frock. Just smooth her down again, nurse. Make haste, darling. That last ring must have been the   AGNES WENTWORTH.        I coachman's; and I must be early, to -make sure of meeting my chaperon." Agnes stood up mechanically, but looked wilted from head to foot. "Oh, nurse, do you suppose the doctor thought he wouldn't get well?" "I don't know nothing what he thought, child ; that was what he said. I guess he thought he was a pooty sick man; and in the midst o' life we're in death." "Oh, what a beautiful day spoiled!" ' You know that's jest what I'm always a-tellin' of you, Agnes. You don't never know what a day -may bring forth. Why, take care, lovey!-don't you do so! You'll rumple up all your nice curls; an' then what'll your dear sister say?" Agnes unclasped her little hands from her temples, slowly left the room, and crept down to the coach, in which Rosamond was already seated impatiently wait- ing for her. "Dear Rosy," she whispered, "please don't want me to go." "'Why, Agny, what is the matter?" "Mr. Vernon--  " "Well?" "Nurse seems to think " "My dear, what does she know?" "Rosy, can you assure me that he will get well?" "Why, no, Agnes, I can't do that exactly; but neither can nurse assure you that he won't. I hope he will, I'm sure. She does very wrong to frighten you. Come, pet, jump right in, and put it all out of your little curly head." "I can't put it out of my head.

And it would be very dismal for you." "Oh, I don't know; but I couldn't possibly be dan- cing at anybody else's home while somebody might be dying at ours. If I went, I'm afraid I should burst out crying, sooner or later, before all the company." Rosamond was afraid of it too. The child was struggling for self-command till, with the struggle, she trembled from head to foot; but her sister knew that her nerves were not yet always within her own control. Her voice and her lip quivered. Her cheeks were again blanched; her eyes had dark rings around them. Her green and white now made her look as ghastly as a fairy caught by daylight. Rosamond could not well prolong the discussion before the coachman, and was somewhat in fear, besides, of her father's return from his club. He might bring with him some "Puritan" scruples to interfere, in the circumstances, with her own departure; and she was famishing for a little fun. Accordingly, she only said, "Well, dear, I'm very, very sorry; but I'll try to bring you some flowers," leaned back, and made a sign to the man, who drove off.   AGNES WENTWORTH.        19 CHAPTER    IV. AGNES returned into the house, feeling doubly dreary. The twilight hall seemed dark with the shadow of death. On the stairs she met nurse; and nurse was vexed and astonished at seeing her back again. "Did you think I could want to go, after what you said?" "What did I say?" "Why, don't you know? You said-I don't know what you said; but you made me think you meant poor Mr. Vernon was going to die." "I never said no such a word." "If you did not mean so, indeed, nurse, I think it was cruel to frighten me so." "Now, don't you go a-saying I frighten you, Agnes. I only wanted to solemnize you a little; but you always have such a way of taking things." So she had,-a rather peculiar way of taking things in earnest. It could not be more inconvenient to others than it was painful to herself. Would that way always be her way through our factitious life? Would the pain afterward bring forth good fruits for herself and others? Only time could show. In the mean time at least she was patient with those who were instruments to bring such pain upon her. She thought within herself, "I'm sure I should think I was quite solemnized enough as it was, the chief of  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7379-00000012"/> it2)0    AGNES IVENTItORTIt. the time, living here all alone;" but to nurse she only rejoined, quite meekly, "I wonder if there isn't anything I could do for Mr. Vernon, if you were to take me in to see him!" "No; I couldn't take you in to see him. YQur father wouldn't like it." "Papa?--why not?" "'Cause it wouldn't be proper." "Oh, dear!" thought Agnes, "I wish it would always I)e proper to b)e kind. At least I will send a little note to Canlbridge, though, and tell Watty. He will come and see about Mr. Vernon, and do him imuch more good than I could." She darted noiselessly up to her chamber. Her tiny desk stood by the window; and the west still glowed. She wrote quickly and briefly, taking care, however, not to alarm Walter more than she thought necessary, and gave her note to the chambermaid for the mail. Then, somewhat relieved and encouraged, she sat quietly wondering how much nurse had really meant, and looking out into the beautiful June shadows, on the dim gray tombstones amnong the feathered grass of the Granary. They were her favorite companions when Rosa- mond and Walter were away. She loved to plan conversations among them.  There was the tall obelisk that she called "the father," and the flat slab on pillars, that she regarded as the mother lying on a sofa with her children around her. The low, square shaft with the urn was the mother's work-table and basket. The children were the smaller headstones. She had been allowed to go into the graveyard some-   4 fNES WIENTWORTH.        21 times; and she knew by heart the poor little dead names upon them, called now no more upon earth probably, except by her in the stillness of her own little lonely mind. She called the small headstones by these names, softened (as thev were once most likely, in households, scattered since, that she had never known) into household diminutives, "Harry," "Susy," "Tommy," and so forth. She pleased herself by fancying that these stones called by the names of children were allowed to play about the churchyard at night, though they were kept so still all day in order " not to disturb the neighbors," and that she had seen them jump out of the darkness sometimes when itthundered and lightened at her bed- time.  She often threw flowers to the nearest ones, which, with a little effort, she could make her offerings reach from her window; and, when she could get leave to go and carry bread to the homeless dog that lived among them, she wove them garlands, and almost hoped that they were glad when she crowned them and laid a nosegay on their mother's work-table. But to-night a. touch of reality was scattering all her dreams. As the city-sounds came to her softened over the graves,-the noise of life through the hush of death,-she thought chiefly of the sufferer near her, so helpless and alone, with life and death perhaps strug- gling over him for the mastery.  Was he to come forth to walk those near streets again, and talk with breathing men like those whose tones and words even, as they passed to and fro, she could sometimes catch-? Or was his portion henceforth to be, like that of the forgotten forms in the ground before her, once as young  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7379-00000013"/> 2'2     A GNrES WE VTWORTH. and vigorous as he, only a small dark bed and coverlet of grass? She folded her little hands and prayed for him, that he night be raised from the dying, as the widow's son from the dead, and become a glorious painter to the glory of God, like Fra Angelico of whom she had read, and one of whose little angels gleamed above her against its golden background in the golden rays of the rising moon, trumpeting clearly to her soul through the eye instead of the ear. Thus she sat, calm, peaceful, and-in spite of the great disappointment and great anxiety of the day- growing almost happy in the feeling that she was alone with God, and that He had heard her prayer and would do His very best to answer it. Moments in which she felt these things were among the happiest which the motherless and solitary child had known. "People often trouble me," she used to say to her- self; "God never does." CHAPTER V. Lo, there came a fumbling noise at the door, as if somebody without any hands was trying to open it. Agnes made haste to do so; and in sidled nurse, with a large waiter, on which was set out supper for two, (including a sheet of Agnes's favorite bakers' buns with homueopathic sugar and three Zante currants apiece in them,) in a particularly tasteful set of black- white-and-gold baby-house china. The latter, given   A GNES WENTWORTH.       23 by Walter to Agnes on a birthday, was usually kept by nurse in a sort of honorable confinement. But, her secret heart just now aching for the loss of her "baby's" pleasure, she had devised this more often sought than granted indulgence, as the best substitute in her power. Agnes, if old in some things for her age, was in others peculiarly childlike. She clapped her hands softly, brought forward an old claw-footed mahogany stand, set a chair for nurse, very hospitably shook hands, and exchanged with her the "I hope I see you in the enjoyment of good health, Miss Went- worth," and "How do you do, Mrs. Tibbets? I am delighted to see you," usual on such happy occasions, and proceeded to pour out nurse's green tea and her own "white," of which milk and water formed the principal ingredients. "But what will papa do?" said she, pausing in her thirsty imbibition of that stimulating fluid. "Well, he won't be home. He sent up the office-boy to say he'd got to go over to Dodgester to make a sick gentleman's will, an' you needn't expect him not till you sawr 'im." "A sick gentleman's will!"It recalled Agnes's thoughts from festivities. "Nurse," said she, "do you know how Mr. Vernon is now? Has he had his beef- tea every hour?" "Well, no, Agnes; I'm afraid he hasn't. John said last time he cared it up, he wouldn't do it again, 'cause Mr. Vernin he wouldn't have it, nor 'twan't no use." Agnes's hands dropped in her lap. "But, nurse, what is to be done?"  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7379-00000014"/> 24      AGNES WELNTIWORTH. 'Well, that's jest what I say, Agnes. Says I to John, 'I don't know nothin' what to do, says 1, "cause I know the doctor thought 'twas important. I'm almost a mind to care it up myself an' try if he won't take it from me,' says I. You see I said that jest to see how John would take it; 'cause you know you always have to mind what you say to John." "Well?" said Agnes. "An' says John, 'Take it an' try, an' welcome,l says he; 'an' see ef you don't take it out in tryin'."' "Well?" repeated Agnes. "So 1 jest took it an' run right up an' stepped in ; anl' says I, jest as pleasant as I could, 'Here's your tea, sir;' an' says he, 'Anoint thee, witch l' or words to that effect; so I saw he was a little out; an' fust I thought I'd kind o' hold his nose a little an' jest put it right down gently; an' then he looked at me so dread- ful, I thought perhaps 'twould be best not to excite hni." "But then, nurse, I think we ought to send for the doctor. " "Well, Agnes, so 1 said. But John he was a-readin' the Transkip, an' he didn't think best to go, 'cause Mr. Wentworth might come in unexpected an' want him. But Marthy she was a-goin' right by to see her mother; an' she said she'd send him right up. But he ain't ben; an' so I spose lie's out." Agnes wrung her little hands. Then she considered a moment. Then, as nurse repeated her "I don't know nothin' what to do,' she stood up and spoke: "Then, nursey, I'll tell you what must be done; and I'll tell papa the very minute he comes home, and take   A GNES IWENTWORTH.       25 all the blame on myself, if there is any. If Mr. Ver- non died in this way, we should blame ourselves all our lives. You shall get me that tea; and I shall give it to him. I think it is right; and so God will help me." Nurse demurred, as well she might; but of their two wills, Agnes's was really the stronger, and perhaps had all the more power from its strength being usually held in reserve. Nulse rose, too, and stood irresolute. "But it ain't no use, lovey. You couldn't make him take it; how could you?" "I shall coax him," said Agnes, nothing doubting; and nurse had internal evidence of the potency of Agnes's coaxings. They stole with their lamp into the passage, where the rejected restorative stood on the window-seat in a yellow, venomously  ugly crockery bowl. Agnes peeped into-it. Its aspect was such as to justify its rejection. "Why, nurse, what does make it look so horrid?-just like castor-oil;-I dare say he thought it was, poolr fellow!" "My! she went an' never skunl it! Them ignorant Irish! I never!  I took it up in a flurry jest on the edge o' the evenin', without seein, ani never thought nothin' but what Itwas all right. Well, it don't never do to say nothing I'll jest take the grease right off myself, an' heat it up here in the nurse-lamp; an' no- body won't be none the wiser." "And I will run down to the china-closet and find something pretty to put it in. That makes the great- est difference with doses," said Agnes, in the tone of experience.  She had once had the measles; "so she knew. ' 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7379-00000015"/> 26      AGNES WENT WORTH. "Oh, Agnes, remember your noo gownd!" hissed nurse after her down the stairs, in a stage-whisper. "Oh, nulse, for pity's sake don't talk to me about gowns this night, if you don't want to drive nce fran- tic!" returned Agnes; but she did so in a not stage whisper, and merely for the relief of her own mind; wherefore nurse's was not wounded. Into the closet the little lady whisked; where, by good luck, she did not find the despotic John. By further good luck, he had forgotten to take the keys of the cupboards. There was silver enough there, of the fashion that was thought pretty fifty years ago, in formal shapes incrusted with bands of minute Arcadian figures of sheep, shepherds, shepherds' dogs, and nymphs. 'Per- haps it was pretty; but Agnes did not think so. "Finery and fuss!" she ejaculated, with her epithets of strongest reprobation. "There's a plain plated bowl now, with handles, that is better; but I don't think, on the whole, anything metal will do. It shines and dazzles so; and we must have a lamp, to see what rwe're about." After a little more turning and peeping, and gentle opening and shutting of doors, and pulling out of drawers to climb up on, she found what she wanted. It was a tall white drinking-cup of the ex- quisite ware called Parian, often as beautiful in its models as in its substance. She set it in a salver, and, putting her little hands out of the window, filled them with fresh dewy leaves and tendrils from the Isabella- grape vine which ran up the wall beside. With these she lined the salver. Early hot-house grapes were in a basket on the shelf. Her neighbors, the Ardens, had   AGNES WENTWORTH.        2-7 sent them in for Mr. Vernon; and the doctor had said he might have some.  She looked lovingly at the brighter ones; but her fastidious eye finally decided that they would only disturb the pure, cool harmony of her favorite purple, green, and white. Accordingly, she surrounded the foot of the-cup with rich clusters of black Hamburgs, and stood a moment bewitched by the beauty of her own simple devices. Then she crept up with them to nurse, who poured in the tea, amber- colored, clear, and gently steaming. "Now, nursey, I think you'd better keep behind the door and just hold the lamp for me, and not let him see you again; because he don't know you, and perhaps he will me. But look in all the time, won't you?-so that, if he catches hold of me, you can come in and take me right away." Nurse had not thought of that before. She made a snatch at Agnes herself; but it was too late. Agnes was in the room, by the sofa. The light shone full upon her?little airy form; and the sick man saw her. "Angel of God?" said his hollow voice. ' I have come to bring you this," answered Agnes's singularly clear, sweet, childish voice; "God sends it to you to do you good. You will ta ke it?" Nurse, peeping through the crack of the door, saw a thin hand stretched slowly out, and Agnes putting the cup gently in it. There was a little pause; and the cup was returned. Agnes replaced it on the salver, and came back in triumph. "He has taken it all.--Hark! Didn't he speak again?" They turned and listened at the open door.  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7379-00000016"/> 28      AGNES WENTWORTH. "Come back," repeated the hollow voice, faintly; "angel of God, come back with the lamp." "La, poor soul, he's quite outl Better come away an' leave him be, now; an' mebbe he'll drop off to sleep. 7 "Now I think," said Agnes, "perhaps he had bet- ter just have the lamp if he wants it; because it is dreadful to be in the dark when you don't feel like it, particularly if it frightens you. I'm not at all afraid to go in this time--he seems so gentle." She took the lamp from nurse and carried it in. "Not that," said he, hiding his dazzled eyes and turning away his head,-" the white lamp. " After an instant's perplexity, Agnes gave back the lamp to nurse in the passage, and returned with the cup. That appeared to be what he wanted.  "Stay there,"7 said he; " and light me through the Valley of the Shadow. Don't leave me alone." It seemed to Agnes like one of her day-dreams come true,-awful, but beautiful. She stood,-the bright spot in the dusky chamber,-patient and still, in all the sweet simplicity and unconsciousness of unspoiled childhood, gazing abstractedly upon the pretty things she held. The pretty things in which Rosamond had decked her, she had not yet had the heart to lay aside, -any of them; and the lamp, which her nurse held as she sat on the floor in the passage, shone on the little white pinion above her head, on cheeks and eyes brightened again by her compassionate energy, on the lilies on her breast, her thin green draperies, and on the little hands, one clasping the cup and the other   AGNLVES WENTWORTI.       29 half buried among the verdant leaves and tendrils and purple grapes which hung over the edge of the salver. From time to time she glanced at her patient. His eyes were turned steadily toward her; but the lids drooped more and more, and he looked more and more tranquil. She was becoming tired; but what of that? How much more tired he must be, -for they said he had not slept at all the night before. If nurse at the door only would not fidget and rustle so! If they could only put him to sleep! She did. His eyes closed, opened, closed again, and did not open; and his breathing grew slower and deep. As she crept out and, with her finger on her lip, drew nurse away, she heard the latch-key in the front door. Her father was coming in; and, to her great joy, the doctor was with him. She went down to meet them. "You can't tell me anything about young Vernon, I suppose, Mr. Wentworth?" the doctor -was saying. "They sent for me an hour or two ago, it seems, to come to him again. " "No; I am concerned to bear it. Agnes, do you know what the matter is?" "Papa," said Agnes, standing very straight, "no- thing in particular's the matter, now; but nurse said she was afraid you wouldn't like what I did; and so I-said I should tell you. Mr. Vernon seemed very strange, and wasn't willing to take his beef-tea; and Dr. Brodie was out; and nobody was at home; and we didn't know what to do; and so I made her let me go in and give it to him." "Lou made him take it, did you, missy?" said the 3*  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7379-00000017"/> 130      AGNES WENTWORTI. doctor, looking comically down upon her. "How did you do it?-moral suasion, or physical force?" "Oh, I don't know exactly. Nurse made it look good, and I made it look pretty, and told him he would take it; and he did." "It won't do to have these things left to chance, though," said the doctor, turning to Mr. Wentworth. "Certainly not. I am very sorry if there has been any neglect on the part of my servants." "Perhaps their zeal is greater than their knowledge. It is a case rather for a regular nurse. Shall I give you the address of two or three?-I know of a capital one who left a place this morning." By all means. Here are pen, ink, and paper. A gnes, ring the bell. John, take this paper; go to number Myrtle Street; ask for Miss-Miss Manna; and tell her you will bring her bag, and I will give her a dollar extra to come back with you at once. Agnes, you do wrong to sit up so late. Go to bed, my dear."' Agnes kissed him, and went up to her chamber, wishing she might only have waited long enough to hear Dr. Brodie's opinion of the poor sick man. She was somewhat dispirited, too, at being blamed, and blamed before her friend the doctor. Rosy had not come home yet; and if she could only have gone with Rosy she would have been later still, and had so much pleasure, besides. out in the free, green, beauti- ful countryl And how could she have gone to bed much earlier, either, all things considered?-and Park- Street clock was but just striking nine now. To add to her trials, nurse thonught it necessary--   AGNES WENT WORTH.       31 for nurse was rather more scrupulous about her charge's veracity than about her own-to say, as she undressed her, "Agny, how come you say that to Mr. Vernin about God's sendin' him that 'ere tea? Wasn't that a little bit of a wrong story?" "Why, no!'" said Agnes, turning about with a start, and facing her with eyes round with surprise. "Don't you know it says in the Bible that every good thing comes down to us from God? 8And isn't everything good for us that does us good, whether we like it or not? Why, that was what I always used to say to myself when I was sick, to make myself take all my medicine!" "Well, I want to know " thought nurse to herself. ". Ef you ain't a queer one I Ef that ain't a noo voo to take of ile and seny!" She said no more upon the subject; and Agnes could not judge whether she was acquitted or not. The child's spirits were fairly worn out; and she shed a few tears when she was finally left alone to kneel at her bedside. The attitude, however, reminded her of her twilight petitions; and she was the one to chide herself now, for ingratitude. How peevish and wrong it was to mind trifles, when God had begun already to answer her prayer, and put poor Mr. Vernon to sleep, and sent for "a capital nurse" to take care of him I  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7379-00000018"/> 32      AGNES IWEVNTWORTIL CHAPTER VI. THE next morning, things looked brighter. Agnes, who slept later than usual, awoke to see a retiring flap of the white fritled dressing-gown as it whisked out of her chanmber-door. '"My good angiel's wing," said she to herself. "What has she been flying in and out for, I wonder?"The next thing her winking eyes rested upon was a large nosegay of rich, old-fashioned garden- flowers, which comumended themselves especially to her more romantic than exotic taste. The " capital nurse" was in charge, and to be seen going into and out of the sick-room, pleasant-looking, light-footed, soft-voiced, skilful, watchful, and faithful. In answer to inquiries, she informed Mrs. Tibbets that she didn't see why the patient shouldn't do very well, if the hinges of all the doors were immediately oiled; though lhe had seemed to be a little wandering between sleeping and waking, and talked about wanting a little angel that came in, the night before, and gave him light to drink out of a lamp. (Mrs. Tibbets kept her own counsel, and reported only the first half of this communication to Agnes. She was frightened at the very thougcht of their rashness, and in no mood to re- peat it.) Walter had received Agnes's note, too, and succeeded in reading it. He came into town that very day, and thanked her for it, and told her that it was very thought- ful in her to write it. He came every day, henceforth,   AGN'ES WENTWORTH.        33 when he could get away from his recitations, and alter- nately petted her and sat with Vernon, while Miss Manna took a nap. Between the latter two and the doctor, Vernon did very well; and it was soon an- nounced that, in a few days more, he was to be helped down-stairs to lie on a sofa in the library for change of scene and air. Agnes was pleased to hear this; but it happened, as it was apt to happen to the poor little girl, that her pleasure was presently dashed. Rosamond, who had been restless thoughout her visit, received an urgent letter of recall from Mrs. Van Rooselandt, and begged Mr. Wentworth's leave to rejoin her aunt at once at Newport. He made no objection. Poor little Agnes could scarcely command her voice enough to set forth hers : it was a whole fortnight sooner than she expected to lose her sister, and she would "not come again for half a whole long year." Walter, however, took Agnes's part without her knowledge. One night, when she was gone to bed, he came down from Vernon's chamber and found Rosa- mond, for a wonder, at home and alone. She was sitting in 'the bay-window of the library, and looking out with a softened face at the waning moon and the graves. "Rosamond," said he, "are you really going to- morrow?" "Too true, I fear," answered she, resuming her usual manner as she turned toward him; "everything looks like it,-trunks locked, and tickets taken." "I am very sorry for it." "And so am I, Watty,-on some accounts."  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7379-00000019"/> ,34      A GNES WENTWORTIL. "Then why can't you put a stop to the whole busi- ness, once for all?" "My dear Walter, what can you mean? What a proposal!" "I amn serious in making it, though." "It would be such a kind return to poor aunty, for one thing, after all the trouble she has had with me sooner or later,-hooping-cough and frocks and French, and so forth and so forth and so forth 1" "I rather think you have paid as you went." "I am sure I hope I have. Pretty ungrateful I must have been if I did not try. But-do you not see? -that only makes me the more important to her now." "She has her own daughters." "Well, Watty!-but it is not for me to tell tales out of school." "I dare say. I give up that point. But now, Rosy, don't you think, at any rate, it is time that papa and Agnes had something like a home? I don't say any- thingr about myself; for of course it doesn't make so much difference to me, out all the time cricketing and rowing and frolicking with the other fellows." Rosamond's eyes sparkled with merry mischief. "Master Walter, at this stage of the investigation it would be very much to the purpose, if you would be so good as to state what answer anybody would get, who proposed to you to give up all your frolicking with the other fellows, and stay at home to make it a home for papa and A gnes." "Pooh!" said Walter, looking much at a loss for anything except bloom; " girls ought to be better than "1CII.

"Pooh! everybody knows they ought." "Indorsed on the back of the Salique law," quoted Rosamond, triumphantly, in a burst of sweet laughter. "And-oh, the self-conceit of these potent, grave; and reverend seniors!-am I not better than you, I should like to know? Did I ever, for instance, put flour in a tutor's hat, or ?"She doubled up her pretty fist scientifically, and looked at it, to see that her thumb was in the right place, and then at him inquiringly. "Go to fisticuffs with a boatman? No, Rosy," said he, laughing in spite of himself, "I rather- think discre- tion always has been the better part of your valor." "I don't know about that." "No? What was the story I heard, by the by, of your leaping that fiend of a racer of Dirk Van Roose- landt's over a five-barred fence?" "Truth ; only not to be spoken at all times. I don't mind your knowing, Watty; because I know I can trust you; Iut it was all Dirk's fault that it ever was known at all; and if it ever comes to aunty's ears it will make her angry with him and nervous about me, and is very likely to end in my having to pledge myself to mount nothing, henceforward, but a rocking-horse or the tamest of tame ponies." "TTnder such a penalty-as that, I believe you may trust me." "After dinner one day, Dirk and some other youths were talking, and boasting, I suppose, of their horses. The others agreed with Dirk that his Knickerbocker  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7379-00000020"/> 3 S     A GNES TWENT WOR TH. was the handsomest; but they said that it was still more vicious than handsome. Dirk betted, pretty heav- ily, that it would carry a lady safely over a five-barred fence. The next morning he was very sorry; but they would not release him from his wager; and so, in great trouble, he came to me. I had ridden the horse before. I do not think it is ill tempered so much as ill managed. So I told Dirk, if he would give me his word to make no more bets until he came of age, I would try what I could do for him. But I did not want the fame of quite tan Amazon, nor to make an open exhibition of myself. Therefore I required two other promises of Dirk as conditions: he should not tell who I was, and he should 1post the umpires too far off to recognize my face. There was really no great danger. There was no doubt Knickerbocker could do the thing if he would. I petted llim and patted him, and gave him sugar and an apple; and, when I put him at the fence, he swept on smoothly up to it, without swerving an inch, and cleared it like a!)ir'd." "i Good luck, with your habit and all. But how did it colle out who you were?" "That is the worst part of it. The umpires would not take Dirk's word for my being a lady. They main- tained that I must be Zoyara or some other eques- tr ienne; till the poor boy was driven desperate, I sup- pose and, before I could reach the house again, he let one of them take his opera-glass." "A pretty fellow!" "But, dear Walter, consider; he is only sixteen; and he has always had his older brothers to set hin such an example!"

"And now what is the excuse to be made for Uncle Van Rooselandt?" "Oh, ask Adam!" exclaimed Rosamond, coloring and laughing. "Really, Watty, you ought to remem- ber, and not make me forget, that it is not only our own family by blood, but mine by adoption, that we are speaking of." "Well, Rosy, I must say at least, I think you are a great deal too good for them all." "I don't know about that," answered Rosamond, more gravely, with that constitutional truthfulness which belonged to 5Mr. Wentworth and all his children. "If I were good, perhaps I should make a martyr of myself, take your advice, Watty, tear myself away from my second mother, cut short all my gay young life with my earliest friends in dear, happy New York, and stay here to make Agnes play her scales, and to do the honors for papa's big-wigs. At any rate, I hope I have too much of hilm about me to undertake to make the wrong cause seem the right. But, since there is no other counsel to defend this culprit, I hope no in- justice is done if I simply urge a few extenuating cir- cumstances and then recommend her to merey. I love the Van Rooselandts, and they love me, by instinct, without much criticising or analyzing,-just as people do their own parents and brothers and sisters, I sup- pose, when they are brought up among them,-as I should have loved all of you if I had been brought up 4  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7379-00000021"/> 38      AGNES WENTWORTH. with you; and it was no fault of mine that I was not. you know, though I have to take the consequences. I do love you still, Watty, and darling little Agnes; and I hope I feel very dutifully to papa. But really I am scarcely acquainted with him; when he is not absent in body, he is so in mind; and you are young and gay, and don't want to be confined to me; and I am young and gay, and don't want to be confined to anybody; and Agcnes is a child-no companion for me,-and yet so much better than I, that I don't honestly think I amn fit to have the charge of her. I could not have helped her to what she is; and what she will be, I might hinder. The fact is, I was plunged into a gulf of--well, worldliness is the right word for it, I suppose, -before I knew good from bad; and I've drawn it in, I'm afraid, as a sponge does water; and, when I'm pressed, I can't help giving it out again to all around. Here, in good, dull Boston, I feel just like a toad pre- served in granite. It is safe enough, no doubt, but so cold and stiff and heavy. The toad can live and perhaps grow fat; but it can't hop; and what is life worth, if one can't hop?--Dear me! see my watch! How dreadful it vill be to have to get up at six to-mor- row! Kiss me, Watty; I'm afraid I shan't see you again. You'll pet poor little Agnes more than ever, won't you, for a day or two, till she gets over it?-and here is a trifle left in my purse, by good luck, to buy her something pretty.  Walter agreed to fulfil her behests ; and, to the credit of the temper of both, they parted on their usual good' terms with one another.   AGNES WENTWORTH.        39 CHAPTER     VII. IN two or three days more, Vernon was, according to expectation, established on a sofa in the library, look- ing thin, but handsomer than ever; for the dingy swarthiness which had been wont at that time to cast a lowering shadow over his delicate, regular, classic features was cleared. Little Agnes, however, found his presence less than ever an equivalent for Rosa- mond's. His spirits did not correspond with his com- plexion. He had always been subject to fits of melan- choly; but they alternated with others of fascinating, or sometimes even wild, gayety. Now a habitual moodiness hung about him, which might have broken out into open ill humor if he had not been under the con- straint of a guest. As it was, the servants had a few stories to tell one another of his petulance; and no especial gratitude was expressed to Dr. Brodie. Vernon was not grateful to him yet. He was not glad to come back to life. He was brought back to it, like a half-drowned man, with many struggles. There is this excuse to be made for him, that, in that border- land between soul and body which for want of a term we call " the nervous system," he was utterly misera- ble. His health was broken and his happiness wrecked and his ambition blighted, as he thought, forever; and all this, poor boy, in his twenty-second year l His memory of the first part of his illness was con- fused enough ; but two things still stood out in it dis-  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7379-00000022"/> 40      A GVNES WENTW-ORTH. tinctly. One was the little vivid, green-robed cherub, with snowy pinions fluttering round its head, that had brought him life and light when he was sinking down in the dark to death. He was careful to speak of it no more, however, lest he should be thought crazy and he scarcely dared think of it any more, lest he might be crazy. Vernon had, and possibly has still, the curious and dangerous power, more often found probably in artists than in men of any other class, of calling up optical illusions in a darkened room, at pleasure. While at college, I often knew him, for instance, when at a loss for the expression of some face or figure in a design, withdraw for a short time, as he used to say, into his "camera obscura," and come back to sketch features or gestures singularly characteristic and lifelike. He made no secret of the power then; but it led afterward to his being haunted and harassed by some of those materialistic people self-styled spiritualists, and he be- came impenetrably reserved upon the subject. Now he feared that this power had broken bounds and im- posed upon its master with a lying vision, and that what it had done once to his relief it might do again to his harm. The other thing that he remembered was Rosa- niond's conversation with her little sister. About the reality of this, at least, he was certain there could be no mistake.  The report of his eyes might be too good to be true; the report of his ears was too bad not to be true. He was certain that the shock of it had com- pletely roused him, if only for some little time, out of his delirium. Between illusions and illusions, it had-   AGNES WENTWORTH.        41 been followed by an interval, whether longer or shorter, in which he lay brooding over it, fully conscious of where and how he was, and able, though not over- willing, to answer his physician's questions cohe- rently, to perceive that the good man looked grave, and to be glad of it. He would have snatched at the coffin and the shroud for the slenderest chance of bringing upon Rosamond Wentworth the doom of Barbara Allen. As if this reality were not enough, his imagination often tormented him, as he lay helpless, with the idea of his having played eavesdropper when perhaps he had his senses, and sense of honor, enough. left to try to stop his ears, and when perhaps he could have stopped them if he had tried; and thus by the hour he had to contend, and often to contend in vain, with Satan, the accuser, who only went away to return again the next time he was over-tired or over-long without his gruel. Finally, the doctor had expressed the opinion to Mr. Wentworth-unwarily in John's hearing-that, as soon as the patient was strong enough, he ought to go to work for six months upon a farm; and with this opinion John had encouragingly entertained him the! first time that, after Miss Manna's departure, he offi- ciated as valet-de-chambre.  How could a man who could not endure his life, even when uncomplicated with ploughs, hoes, rakes, and rustics, hope to endure it when it should become complicated with ploughs, hoes, rakes, and rustics? Thus his perverse condition de- nied him aay comfort in his thoughts, and exaggerated every discomfort, small and great; and to be wroth 4*  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7379-00000023"/> 42      A GNES WEN TWORTII. with one he loved did work .like madness in his brain. Meanwhile it seemed, and it was, little Agnes's custom to pass much of her time, out of school-hours, in one particular alcove of the library, either alone, or with nurse at her side indulging in knitting, sewing, or reading Mrs. Chapone's Letters, or "Law's Serious Call." Nurse was in pretty constant attendance at present, when the gentlemen of the house were out, in order, ostensibly, to wait upon Vernon. But she had been, from the period when her nurseling began to run alone, much troubled with a "bone in her foot;" and, not finding Mr. Vernon's manners winning in his present state of mind, she was even less locomotive than usual. Accordingly, it often happened that the pitiful, prompt little girl was, when he called, the first at his side to ring for John for him, to get him a book, or to shut a window. As usual with slight acquaint- ances, she was silent and reserved with him. One afternoon, notwithstanding, when he was conscious of having been especially exacting, he exerted himself to make a little conversation with her. "t Miss Agnes, I am afraid I give you no peace. "he drones ought not to interrupt the bees, ought they?" "Sick bees are different from drones." "What was the little queen-bee busy about, so long and so still, behind there in her hive, without a single buzz?" "First I learned my geography; and then---" "I should not ask, if you would rather not tell." The odd child considered, and then said, deliber-   A GNES WENTWORTH.        43 ately, as if rather to herself than to him, "I do not believe it can be a good plan, or dignified, to do any- thing we are ashamed of, or- be ashamed of anything we do. Then, Mr. Vernon, /I tried to draw an angel, to hang in my room, out of Mr. Allston's book. I was not ashamed of trying to do it,--only of not doing it well. " " That was because you had not tried often enough before." " Was that it ?" " Chiefly, I rather think. Mr. Allston probably had to try a good many times himself before he could ' do' those angels. If I can get well, and become a painter, I expect to have to 'try' almost every day of my life, and all day long." " I thought you were a genius I" exclaimed Agnes. "My brother said so." Vernon's sweet and brilliant smile flashed over his face for the first time since his fever, as he asked, en- couragingly, "And what is that, Miss Agnes?" "Able to do things without trying." "But to do them much better with trying. Which would make the best workman,-a person with one hand, or with two?" " With two."^ " Very well: if genius is an artist's right hand, labor is his left." Her little face looked pleased and interested; but, though she stood civilly waiting for more, if he had more to say, her eyes wandered back to her alcove. "If you would like to lend me a pencil and paper, I will try now to draw you an angel; and you shall see how I do it."  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7379-00000024"/> '44     AGNES WENTIWORTH.  "Oh, thank you. How kind I  Vernon held a fan over his eyes a few moments. Then he raised himself toward a sitting posture, took  Agnes's pencil, laid her paper on a book, and threw a : few lines upon it with a practised though trembling  hand. Looking on, the wondering child saw form   I itself among them, she knew not how, the outline of a  knight in armor, stiff and stark, lying on a tomb, in a dark crypt such as she had been shown in her favorite "cathedral books," in the Boston Athenaeum. Above him presently appeared the angel, hovering with a torch. "Oh, how lovely! That's like Fra Angelico." Vernon sank back exhausted, but again smiling, as he handed her the paper. "Why, do you know about Fra Angelico, Miss Agnes?--what about him?" "I have one of his painted angels;-Walter bought it for me, my last birthday, at Williams and Everett's; -and so I found out all about him that I could. He was the most beautiful kind of a saint. He served God with his pictures. He painted his prayers." ^*s   A GNES WENTWORTH.        45 CHAPTER VIII. THNGS under a good Providence often do not turn out quite as they might be expected to do under the management of the devil. That is a truth which it would be a great relief to a great many young people to know; and therefore I state it for their benefit, if haply they will accept it upon my statement; but, after all, I fear that it will take a good deal of expe- rience to teach it to them thoroughly. Vernon, before long, had a very good lesson to teach it to him. While he lay, as I have described him, repining, and reflecting on ploughs, hoes, rakes, and rustics, on his sofa in Beacon Street, Agnes Went- worth one day, returning from school, met Miss Arden making calls in Mount Vernon Street. "How d'ye do, little dear? How is Walter's sick friend?" asked the elder lady. "Cousin Clara," (Miss Clara was adoptedly the cousin of a pretty large circle of nice children,) "they say he is doing as well as can be expected; but he is an altered being. He used to be so pleasant and funny; and now he scarcely speaks, when he can help it, and lies on the sofa from morning till night, looking utterly miserable; and the doctor says, before he may be an artist or do anything he likes, he must work on a farm or do something horrid, for six months at least." "And-is that what makes him miserable?" "I believe so."  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7379-00000025"/> "      AGNTES WENTWORTH. "And he wishes to be an artist, then?:' "Oh, dreadfully! Isn't it hard?" Miss Clara gave her little friend a kiss and told her she was sorry; and in this deed and speech Agnes sup- posed she had received all the comfort of which the case admlitted. In the course of a week, however, she received a pretty little note, all to herself, in Miss Arden's handwriting, saying that her friend Mr. Dud- ley was going to Washington in a few days, and thought, if Mr. Vernon would like a consulship in Italy, that it might be obtained, provided the case proved a suitable one for recommendation to the government. Agnes went dancing with the note to Walter. He said that she herself ought to have the pleasure of reading it to Vernon. It seemed to give him new life. He sat upright without a pillow, upon his sofa, and gave rapid and clear directions for finding, at his room in Holworthy, the portfolio of his best designs, which were to be sent to Mr. Dudley and shown by him, if he should desire; to any artist whose opinion of them he should desire. The opinion proved favorable; and Mr. Dudley's ne- gotiation successful. A consulship was granted Ver- non in an Italian city, where the duties were not burden- some, and the fees were sufficient to keep a single man from starving, and where, as was expected, he would have opportunities of studying the works of the old masters for his benefit, and copying them for his profit. Vernon's father was a physician of large practice but also a large family. It was his custom to give his sons a liberal education, and then let them shift for themselves as they chose. Thus the present arrange-   AGNES WENT WORTII.       47 ment suited all parties concerned, especially as it re- ceived the sanction of Dr. Brodie. Vernon now rallied faster and faster, and was even able to return to Cam- bridge to receive his degree. CHAPTER    IX. JUST before Vernon sailed, he came in to spend a Farewell evening with the Wentworths; and Horace Single, another classmate and special crony of Wal- ter's, was there. After tea, they all sat together in the library. Mr. Wentworth, at his writing-table, was looking over his newspapers; Agnes, unnoticed at his elbow, was hem- ming a handkerchief for him by the light of" his lamp; while the youths smoked and chatted fraternally in the bay-window. Vernon's tongue was making up for lost time.  "Single, you'll be double before I come back," said he. "I?-Heaven forefend!" "Why should Heaven do anything of the sort, pray? You're luckier than most of us; you can afford to set up a wife." "I am afraid she would be too much in love with me," exclaimed Single, with guileless gravity. "Hear till him!" cried Walter. "I'm forced to bor- row a phrase from the eloquent Irish, in order to do any justice to his state of mind." "Single, ye lady-killer!" chimed in Vernon. "Not at all; I am only un homme incompris."  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7379-00000026"/> 48      A GNES WENTWORTH.  "Explain yourself and welcome, if you can," said Vernon. "Certainly: if you think you do detect some self- conceit in the sound of my speech, there was none in the substance, I assure you. I let the sweet creatures alone at present; and they generally let me alone, I acknowledge. But, now, you would not have me lay my all at the feet of a girl who did not care for me at all, would you?" "No," said they, too eager for what was to come next to answer more at length. "But here we come then to the difficulty. How am I ever to insure the via media? I have some other ob- jects and interests in life besides a partner in it; and, if Mrs. Single had none, one or other of us would have to be miserable , and I don't incline to either alternative. Now, Wentworth, you are not to be ex- pected to understand what I am going on to say; but such an ambitious fellow as Vernon ought surely to be able to comprehend what it is for any man to want to make his mark on the world, and to want it above all other things, however in themselves harmless, or even desirable. I intend to be a scholar or an author,-per- haps both. I do not choose to throw away, at any- body's bidding, the vantage-ground I have gained by the last four years of desperate grinding, not to speak of what went before. But what becomes of it all or of me, if I have got, the very next thing, to let myself down to be the companion of a woman?" "What's this he says to me, now?" cried Walter, one of whose most thorough and popular accomplishments was his mastery of the Irish accent and idiom.   A ONES WENTWORTH.        49 "' Let myself down to be the companion of a woman,' quotha !" echoed Vernon. "What manner of woman ? a fishwoman ?" " Well, a young lady, if you like that better, or even what it is the fashion to call 'a cultivated young lady.' She might be able to play on the piano, and read Emile Souvestre, or perhaps even Jean Paul, 'with a good deal of dictionary.' What then? I have something else to do than to read Jean Paul with her; and I am sure I would a great deal rather she should not play on the piano within a mile of my library. She would rise late, and keep me waiting for my coffee, or take it hard if I drank it without her, and so spoil my studious morning. At noon, she would drag me about at her heels to make calls with her, when I ought to be having my constitutional; and, later in the day, no sooner would my boots be off than she would request me to accompany her to spend the evening -with my mother- in-law." "And serve you right, too, for taking them off with- out leave," said Walter. " If I kept them on, they would only walk off-with me to my club, or wherever I supposed you two were likely to be found, and leave her in hysterics." " Your case is pretty well made out," said Vernon. "Let ' Heaven forefend,' by all means. It is no worse than you deserve." " lHe reminds mne strongly of another fine and sensi- ble young creature I heard talking lately," said Wal- ter. "Her ideal of domestic felicity seemed to be, not 'to be confined to anybody." "Who ?-who was it ?" cried Single. 5    &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7379-00000027"/> 50      A GTES IEN2 WORTH. "Just the thing for him!" said Vernon. "Come, Walter, who was it?" "What should I tell for? 1 call neither of the par- ties my foe. For my part, I must say I rather like the feminine element, provided only it comes in at the right time, and not prematurely to interfere with the seed-time of wild oats." "Elements are beggarly!" said Vernon, scowling, and pulling his mustache. "Et tu, Brut'!" said Walter. "I thought you were the very Squire of Dames," said Single. "Is that any reason I should relish seeing them re- solved into their elements?" said Vernon. "Vivisec- tion and analysis are not my forte. Besides, a good many other elements go to the making up of any fine femina besides what people are pleased to call the feminine element!-such sweety limpidness, eau sucree " "Better than aqua fortis, though," put in Walter, who was somewhat less ignorant of theoretical chem- istry than of any other branch in which, within the last four years, he had undergone instruction. "Wherefore I will neither," retorted Vernon. "Evoe!" cried Single. "' I say ditto to Mr. Burke,'- or rather, and better, Mr. Burke says ditto to me." "No, he doesn't, if Burke stands for Vernon. I might, if I recognized Walter's alternative as the only one. But there are some things in heaven and earth, Horatio, dreamt of in my philosophy, besides women who are merely good and women who are not good,-heighol" "And those things are? " inquired Single.   AGNES WENT WORTH.       5] "Women who have not only innocence and affection, but all the other qualities which go to the making up of fit companions for the manliest men,-sympathy, intellect, spirit, heroism, generosity,-genius, if you will,  " "Excuse my interrupting you for a moment," said Single, rather stiffly; " but do you consider yourself to be speaking at present of any possible actual female, or only of your ideal muse?" "Perhaps a little of both," said Vernon, coloring, and hiding his embarrassment over a book which he drew from his pocket. "Here is a passage in point that has struck me a good deal. I opened to it in a book of extracts that I took up on a counter yesterday, and, for the sake of it, I bought the volume to keep me company on my voyage.  Shall I read you a few lines?" "If Walter has no objection," said Single. "If they fail to confirm your views," said Walter, with his wonted complaisance. "Hear, and judge of that for yourself," returned Vernon. And he read: " 'Why should a woman liken herself to any historical woman, and think, because Sappho, or Sevigne, or De Stael, or the cloistered souls who have had genius and cultivation, do not satisfy the imagination and the serene Themis, none can,- certainly not she? Why not? She has a new and unattempted problem to solve, perchance that of the happiest nature that ever bloomed. Let the maiden, with erect soul, walk serenely on her way, accept the hint of each new experience, try, in turn, all the gifts God offers her, that she may learn the power and the  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7379-00000028"/> 52      ,AGNES WExNTWORTH. charm, that, like a new dawn, radiating out of the deep of space, her new-born being is. * * * The silent heart encourages her: O friend, never strike sail to a fear. Come into port greatly, or sail with God the seas i' There,"7 continued Vernon, as, having pocketed his confusion, he did likewise with his book, "that is what generous manhood should have to say to gener- ous womanhood. But the world at large deals with her daughters as biologists do with their subjects; she says to them, 'You cannot-you cannot-you can- not'-be or do anything; and, therefore,-they can- not.' "Agnes," said Mr. Wentworth, looking up from his papers, "if you have done your sewing, you had better go to bed." Agnes went, with regret but yet with a new idea stirring in her little brain that made her little heart beat higher than usual. There had been much in the conversation between her brother and his friends that was unintelligible to her. She could scarcely have repeated a single clause of it, word for word. But she had gathered the general drift of it, and especially Ver- non's faith in the possibilities of womanhood. She believed him the greatest man of the three; and his opinion opened before her, though in all the vagueness of childhood, plans and distant prospects where all had been a blank. Even if her bright little morning dream of a home with him and Rosamond must never come true,-if he nmust take all his promise and powers away out of sight and hearing, and all his endeavors and achievements imust become nothing to them,-if she must still live   AGNES WENTWORTH.        53 on, apart from her sister, as dreary and weary a life as before,--still, perhaps, in that silent, lonely life of hers she could climb up to reach some beautiful and good thing for herself, and for others. It was worth trying for; when she was older, she would try. While she was thinking such thoughts, or sinking into dreams tinged with them, the young men were taking leave of one another below. But, as they did not part to meet no more, either with one another or with us, it may be worth our while to look for a mo- ment at their circumstances, and into their crystallizing characters before they weather over with the opacity of manhood. Of the three, Vernon was certainly the most brilliant. By birth a South Carolinian, he was by blood at least half a New Englander. His father, born in Boston and educated there and at Cambridge, went, while still very young, to Charleston, where he soon married a Southern lady and settled himself for life. Vernon had all the polish and usually somewhat languid grace of manner, that intercourse, from the cradle up, with the best of Southern society could give him In the inner man, a little more languor and repose than he had might have been good for him. He was impetu- ous, erratic, intense in likes and dislikes, proud, excit- able, and irritable, and generally unbalanced, except by a certain fastidious refinement of nature, and by his peculiar respect and affection for his parents. Through them, but through them only, religious principle had some hold upon his life; though it was only negative, not positive,-as a curb, aot a spur. He would not break through the moral law without their knowledge, 5*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7379-00000029"/> 54      A ONES WENTWORTH. lest he should obtain their confidence and love upon false pretences, nor with their knowledge, lest he should break their hearts. For Dr. and Mrs. Vernon, I have always understood, were boath of them very religious in their way,-the former the most eminently so in deeds, and the latter the most punctiliously so in creeds. But as the former was a Deist of the Parkerite persuasion, and the latter a supremely High-Church- woman, they hit upon the compromise of making Episcopalians of their daughters and leaving their sons to follow their own doctrinal devices and desires, with no very definite doctrinal instruction. And when Ernest found himself, as he did pretty early, adrift in New England the very vortex of religious speculation and innovation, he found himself all at sea, and, for want of knowing what to believe, came very near not believing at all. Single, a Philadelphian, an orphan and an only child, was-I beg his pardon for not mentioning it before- the first scholar in his class. He had some natural ability, and still more emulation and cultivation. He was somewhat "exclusive," sometimes a little cross, and sometimes not a little selfish, and appeared like a person of a rather cold nature except on the side where his ambition lay; but perhaps it would be more just, as well as more generous, to sum up by saying of him that he was a man reared by muen, with a heart never yet well warmed nor expanded. At any rate, he meant no harm to anybody in the world  and his hand already knew the way to his full pocket, as more than one needy fellow-student could testify. Wentworth-or Walter, as almost all his class called   A GNES TVrNTWORTH.        55 him,-was the most popular man in college. He had the sunniest possible hair and eyes and smile and tem- per, and an infinite sweetness of manner; and if be never undertook to improve himself much, most of his young friends overlooked the fact in consideration of his never undertaking to improve them. Further, the chief distinction I call find for him in our trio is, that he was the only one of them who was at all dissipated i and though he was very little so for a very idle and thoughtless youth; of ready social sympathies and a large allowance, I happen to know that he thought it altogether too much so himself when he came to look back upon it a few years later,-poor, poor lad I So they parted with the prophetic strains of their Class-day music-now glad, now sad, and now trium- phant-ringing in their ears, to weave into the warp of their fates the woof of their lives, out of the thread that their unconscious youth had spun for them. Wal- ter went into his father's office, to yawn, and try not to nod, over Blackstone under his father's eye. Single bought a villa on the North River, and shut himself up there, for the most part, with the classics, solacing himself with daily constitutionals by means of his horses, shell-boats, or skates, and with occasional runs for a few  days down to New  York, where he -gen- erally saw, and sometimes danced with, Rosamond Wentworth.  Vernon, night after night, paced the deck of his fiigate, animated still by those strong hopes of youth which cannot be soon uprooted, but only broken off to spring again. Sometimes he hummed to himself, "Ambition, I said, shall soon cure me of love;"  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7379-00000030"/> 56      AGNES WENTWORTH. and sometimes he promised himself that through the success of his ambition his love should still be won. And sometimes yet, though more and more rarely now, he wondered about that little, quaint, green-robed, pre- Raphaelite angel, until, among the painted angels of Italy, be came pretty near forgetting it altogether. C HAPTER X. IN the mean time, Nurse Tibbets very often won- dered likewise, if not precisely about the angel, about its garb, and wondered equally in vain. From the day and night of their first appearance, the verdant robe and snowy wing had flown away,--whither, Agnes either could not or would not tell her. Inquiries and expostulations on the subject were met only with silence, or, if pushed further, with threatenings of an April shower of Agnes's piteous tears; and these always produced a ramollissement of Mrs. Tibbets's heart, which was not so hard as her face. She was henceforth obliged to content herself with a relapse on her nurseling's part into her previous primitive white Sunday frocks and matter-of-fact bonnets; and Agnes kept up her previous reputation of rather a plain girl. She was thought, and truly thought in spite of her, an odd girl, too, and continued to be a solitary and often a very sad girl. She had, indeed, none of that   A GNES WENTWORTH.      5   eccentricity for eccentricity's sake which betokens a vain and shallow character; but her nature really was a somewhat peculiar one; and, through living too much:- by herself or with persons older than herself, she had lost the rhythm of common youthful developement. How often did she look at, and listen to, her little con- temporaries and wish herself like them, while yet she was at once too simple and too upright to try to seem different from what she was! She was too old for them in some things, and in others too young. Not finding much in common between themselves and her, they did not much affect her. Therefore she fancied that there must be something-what, she could not tell, and therefore could not help-something posi- tively disagreeable about her, doomed forever to hin- der such persons as she liked from liking her. This idea not seldom cost her unspoken and unspeakable pangs, and drove her to shut herself up more and more within herself. Therefore they thought her cold and distant; wherefore she was less than ever popular. With a view to making her more like other girls, she was kept constantly at school; but as a scholar she did not shine. Her general intelligence and par- ticular obtuseness were a continual astonishment and vexation to her teachers. She had little relish for most of the things which they tried to teach her, little comprehension for what she did not relish, and no memory for what she did not understand. In vain did they patiently attempt most minute explanations; the more minute these were, the more time had her imagi- nation to wander. She discovered no power of atten- tion. Day after day, she returned home downcast and  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7379-00000031"/> 58      AGNES WENTWORTH. self-reproachful, hopelessly wondering why, when she "did not feel stupid in the least," she should be so in- ferior to all her companions. Then, when she had made such preparation as she knew how for the similar coming trials of the next day, she usually tried to draw. She tried to copy, and failed. Then she would endeavor to console herself with what Vernon had said to her, taking it with childish literalness: it was because she had "not tried times enough yet." After she should have tried times enough in vain, there would come a time when she should try and not in vain. So there did. She copied at last with certainty, truth, spirit, and almost ease. Next she tried to design, and failed; but then Agnes was sixteen years old. CHAPTER    XI. ABOUT this time, Walter tapped at Agnes's chamber door one day when he came home to dinner. "Come in," said she, looking vacantly up at him from her drawing-board. "Wake up! I have some news." "Good news?" asked she, smiling and endeavoring to obey. "Capital for me; for you, no worse than indifferent, -rather good, too, I should think, on the whole. Ver- non is coming home." "Mr. Ernest Vernon Is he, really? How glad I   AGNES WENTWORTH.        59 am! Now I hope we shall have a chance to see all his pictures. But do you mean he is coming here-to Boston?" "Yes; he writes me word he has taken his passage. He wants to see me, and the old room in Holworthy; and then he will take New York in his way and pay his respects to Horace the Magnificent. Between the two, I dare say what he does not,-that he hopes for a glimpse of Rosamond. At any rate, he declares openly that 'Italian women are not to be compared to Amer- ican,' which to my legal ear sounds significant. How I do wish she and he,-the very pleasantest pair of people I ever saw,-could afford to make a match!" "Do you? I used to wish it too, I remember. I wonder if I shall wish it now. Perhaps I was too young then to judge; but, to be sure, you knew him very well. For one thing, at least, I should be sure to like it: if he were my brother-in-law, I should not be ashamed to ask him to give me a few ideas about com- position.  "And I should not be ashamed to ask him not to. You have too many ideas about composition already for your good, missy." "Why Walter " "In proportion to your ideas on other subjects." "I can't guess what you mean," said Agnes, with perfect sincerity; for, though Mr. Wentworth some- times had taken her scholarly deficiencies to heart, Walter never had. "Look in the glass," said he. "Why, do you mean that I do not look tidy?" cried she, starting up in dismay.  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7379-00000032"/> D\      Lrv I rrwD  Lry iLl V 11 4 "Not quite so bad as that 'Tidy'?-yes, to that degree that a Quaker would quake at you!" "Well, what then?-I don't see." "You do not look so pretty as you ought, missy, ' not to put too fine a point upon it.' " "O Walter!" cried she, with tears in her eyes and coloring piteously, " can I help that?" "Certainly. My dear," he added tenderly, "you do not think I would tell you of it if you could not help it?" "But how?" "Oh, I don't know,-as the other girls do, I sup- pose,-as people do anything else they set their hearts upon:-think about it; take pains about it." "But would not that be wrong?" said our little novice, who was accustomed to hear the pomps and vanities most fluently inveighed against, of a Sunday, by a highly-got-up clergyman to a most dressy con- gregation. "Oh, as to that, if you get upon high moral ground, I am off. I should call it myself rather a rendering to Cmasar of the things that are Coesar's; but I am afraid my wisdom may be somewhat of this world.-There's something I almost forgot, to comfort you though, little angel, if I did plague you more than I meant," added he, turning back from the door to give her a note. "From Rosamond? Oh, thank you!-O Watty, she is coming next week!" "And so is Vernon. Hurrah!" "You naughty boy I But won't it be romantic?"

Vernon wrote to me to    engage a room for him at the Tremont; but I'll run down in the pilot-boat and take possession of him and  his baggage and bring him here bodily; and we'll all be jolly together.". "And I'll set Tibby and the chambermaid about  losamond's chamber this very afternoon. Oh, how, Pay!O Accordingly, the dull, still, shady, shut-up apartments nere opened, aired, sunned, swept, and garnished.

(Agnes  had little pocket-money, and deliber- Ad much before her small purchases.)  She set up P  easel in a large empty attic commanding a distant *w of the harbor, and, with much ado, and some Aistance from the despondent and remonstrant Mrs. bbets, covered the windows with white cambric des that would roll up either at top or bottom. Lhese and other preparations were hardly completed en, early one morning, she was roused from sleeping her fatigues by the welcome sound of a rumble and 1-up at the hall-door, and sundry bumpings of sun- 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7379-00000033"/> 62      A GNES WENTWORTH. dry trunks first on the bricks and then on the stairs; and she had no sooner sprung up and laved her face than Rosamond, in her travelling-dress, came in and kissed it. From which auspicious morn the house seemed bright and filled with a presence of lovely and lively young-ladyhood. Almost before Agnes had time to think of him again, similar rumbling and bumpings announced the next comer; and so did Walter, ex- claiming, as he burst into the library and tossed up his cap as he might have done five years before, "Here he is I Allow me to present to you my captive, Apel- les, if not of Cos-town, of Boston." "Of Charleston, I should say, only that I recognize no Apelles at all, Wat.--Miss Wentworth, is it you?" He could not go on. He dropped her hand and turned away. "My sister Agnes," suggested Walter, consider- ately. Vernon recovered himself, and came courteously and cordially up to her: "You would need an introduction to me, Miss Agnes, I dare say; but I have never for- gotten, I assure you, who was so good to me when I was ill and ill-natured. I only hope you do not re- member."  "Not the ill-nature, certainly," said Agnes. "The illness I do; and I think I should have known you anywhere. Are you quite strong again?" "Thank you, yes--and no,-sometimes-sometimes, not. There is a good deal of wear and tear about the life of an artist." Agnes looked at him with a mingling of surprise and compassion. He was as handsome as-yes, in   A GNES WENTWORTH.        63 some respects handsomer than-ever; but indeed he looked worn and torn. "The life is worth the price, though," he added quickly, drawing up his rather small and very finely shaped head, with a sudden change of expression and a glance at Rosamond,--a proud-almost a defiant- glance. "We can easily believe that," said Rosamond,--" to an artist at least such as we have- been hearing of, from time to time, ever since you went to Italy. Why would you never allow your friends the pleasure of seeing a single one of your pictures on this side of the water?" He was still more gratified than she meant he should be. The haggard, anxious expression left his features beaming with sweetness and animation as he answered, "I did not dare allow my friends on this side of the water to judge of me by any one. I could not be quite sure which was the best, not to say, as my little negro boy used to, 'the leastest bad.' As for sparing them all, I never could- bring myself to it; though it might have been the best thing for my training. They made a home for me,-the only home I had." His voice sank at the last words, as if they forced themselves from him; and, as they did so, he looked again away from Rosamond to Agnes. "Shall we see them now??" asked she eagerly. "You are very kind. I do not know. They are here-that is, as near here as the custom-house; but I do not see how we could very well unpack them in your house, Walter. It would be like bringing you in that gift of an elephant." "Come up stairs,-no, not now,--what am I -think-  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7379-00000034"/> "4     A GNES WENTWORTH. ing about?--but after you have lunched we will go. This housekeeper in the bud has been getting you up something of a studio, I believe. We will have the cases set there if you like, and unpack them at your leisure. Edward Arden will put anything you choose into the Athenaeum, and thank you for it; and the rest shall grace our walls as long as they may,-the longer the better for us." This time Vernon's look of gratitude was for Agnes; and very grateful to her it was in more senses than one. By the time the luncheon was eaten, mutual in- quiries and jokes made, answered, and laughed at, and the attic visited and cordially approved and accepted, the little circle seemed so happy, domestic, and natural, that Agnes began again to wish her old wish. She carried it to Walter's chamber, when the said circle had dispersed before dinner, and knocked with it at his door. "Come in,'" said he, as well as he could, with his mouth stopped with lather. "O Walter, you are not whitewashing your house of clay already, are you? I wanted to talk with you. Aren't you Yankee enough to talk through your nose just for once?" "Not very fluently," he mumbled, laughing, not- withstanding, through that organ with sufficient suc- cess to cause commotion among the suds. {"But wasn't it romantic?" "Hcmph!" (affirmative.) "But did you think he would care so much?" "Humph!" (neutral.)   AGNES WEVTWORTH.        65 "But do you believe she will ever care for him?" 'Humph!" (negative.) "Oh, you horrid Walter! But wouldn't it be nice if she did?" He made a desperate charge at her with razor in one- hand and soap-brush in the other. She beat a hasty retreat, shaking with laughter, while forced to stifle her shriek lest it should reach the visitor's ear. Walter was the only bona fide playmate Agnes ever had; and they never knew when to leave off playing with one another. At dinner, Mr. Wentworth appeared; and, as he was pleased with his guest, so his guest was evidently pleased with him. He was a man of fine social-though, properly speaking, no domestic-powers. He needed guests in order to shine at home; but when he had them, he could shine at home; and when he had them and liked them, then he did shine at- home. He now, with his wit and anecdote and well-preserved long memory of men, books, and affairs, came in to cap the climax of the little set of clever and agreeable grown people, all stimulated by each others ready apprecia- tion and enjoyment to do their best for one another. Meantime, Agnes, not yet out, and theoretically still "a  little girl," was in the not unenviable position of a modest listener of whom almost nothing is expected, while by whom almost all may be enjoyed. Even the dulness of her school-room in the morning henceforth made its contrast with the dining-room and library in the evening all the more piquant. For Mr. Went- worth joined his son in urging Vernon to be in no haste to leave them; and Vernon's parents in their 6*  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7379-00000035"/> "     AGNES WENTWORTtI letters urged and even commanded him to be in no haste to join them. The yellow fever had broken out at the South; and, though the rest of his family were thought safe enough, they feared lest he through long absence had become, if there only were such a word, disacclinmated. So he stayed; and there was driving, riding, boat- ing, music, and talking and laughing ad infinitum among the young ladies and gentlemen, according to the pleasant wont of young ladies and gentlemen when they are blest with one another's company. Rosamond and Walter were, in Agnes's opinion, a pattern pair of elders, and always, when it could be done, arranged their plans so as to include her. It would do her more good than harm-so they privately agreed-to take a little of the spare good sense out of her. CHAPTER    XII. BY degrees a mutually agreeable, though, it must be owned, an excessively sensible, friendship sprang up between Agnes and Vernon. From her relation to his lady-love, she had, of course, some reflected in- terest for him; and perhaps it was even a relief to him sometimes to turn fromn one who had all the world to give him or to withhold, to one of whom he sought little, but who could and did give that little frankly and gladly. Rosamond was a remarkably unconstrained and spontaneous person in general; but   AGNES WErNTW'ORTH.        6i toward him she was on her guard, and ie felt it. Agnes could be and was perfectly at her ease with him, - simply grave or simply merry as the case might be,--and as unconscious and artless as with her brother and sister. He was inclined to regard her unworldliness and earnestness as merely a phase of youth, which she was pretty sure to outgrow; but, rating them only at that, he found them entertaining and refreshing for the time. He did not admire her much; but he did like her,-even loved her a little, after a fashion, as: the kind-hearted guileless younger sister that he wished she might one day be to him; and he was very good to her, and discussed a variety of deep questions with her at her pleasure so gravely that one afternoon, when Walter in his palm leaf dressing-gown brought her and a cigar up to the studio, he announced himself as "the Queen of Sheba, come to listen to the wisdom of a pair of Solomons." "No; Mr. Vernon cannot talk and paint at once,- can you?" "How did you find that out, Miss Pythia? Did I ever say so? You never talked to me when I was painting, did you?" said Vernon, looking up with a smile from the grim pudding he was making with his palette-knife.               , "No; I only saw it. Do you really want to know how? When you are painting fast, as if you liked it, your face gets a  far-away, listening look, as if the hearing had, gone into it out of your ears,- and your mind had travelled a great way off. When people are cruel and will speak to you, at first you do not hear; and when you do, and your senses come back and you  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7379-00000036"/> 68      AGNES WENT WORTH. answer, then you stop painting; and it is such a pity 1" "Well, I suppose that is wont to be the way with all artists, in whatever kind, whenever they are. at work in earnest. But, now, what is the reason?" "Ah, it is I who should ask you that." "But I could not tell you; and I should be much obliged to you if you could tell me. If my mind is not here, where is it?" "Why, I supposed-but are not we interrupting you now?" "On the contrary. What I am about now is almost purely mechanical,-merely rubbing in this dark oval border, you see, to paint vine-leaves into." "I supposed, then, that any artist, who brought any really new creation-picture, statue, or poem-into this world, had to go into the other world for it. There can be only one real Creator-can there?-in the whole universe." "I do not know," said Vernon, stopping short in his work. "It is such a novel question!--at least to me. You think, then, that this design which I am slowly groping after, step by step," he continued, pointing to a charcoal sketch which hung on the white wall before teem, "is already completed and waiting for me in the mind of God?" "Yes. I should think so. Do not you?" "I wish I did. I wish I could," said he, talking as if to himself, in a low, awe-struck tone. "It would make Him seem so near! It would make Him seem so fatherly I It reminds me of a habit my mother had when I was a child. When I rode home at noon from   A GNES WENTWORTH.        69 school, hot and faint, and she was out, I used to go and look in a certain small shady balcony which be- longed to my own chamber; and there I was sure to find some cool, flowery, fresh treat of fruit that her in- visible hands had set there for me, and for me alone.-- But, Miss Agnes, I fear that your theory, like many another of which one is sorry to think so, will not bear examination. The beautiful and evil new crea- tions,--where do they come from?" "Are there such things?" "You are fortunate if, even at your age, you have not found that out." "Then I should think that their beauty came from the mind of God, and their wickedness through the minds of ungrateful men. The Apollo Belvedere would look distorted and defaced if he were exhibited through a cracked and muddy window; but it would be the showman's fault,-would it not?-instead of the sculp- tor's. The little feast in your balcony would have been poisonous if you had brought nightshade-berries home with you, to mix with -Mrs Vernon's grapes and currants; but would she have been to blame?" "I see the point you would make. I believe you may be right,-to a considerable extent. I must think more about it. But why should such glorious second- sights be permitted to bad men?" "Why?   O Mr. Vernon, why have we all so much more than we  deserve? Why do kind mothers put treats in the way of naughty little boys?" He  smiled his sweet, peculiar, brilliant smile, and let that part of the matter drop. "You do not believe in essentially beautiful wickedness then, Miss Agnes?"  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7379-00000037"/> 70      AGNES WENTTWORTH. "Only as I do in essentially beautiful ugliness," re- turned she, laughing. "Wickedness is spiritual ugli- ness, is it not?" "There speaks the irrepressible Yankee mind," said Walter, whom they had almost forgotten, looking up out of a copy of "Pendennis" in which he had taken refuge from too much metaphysics. "My sisters' tongues are tolerably classic; but did you ever know anl unreclaimed Yankee yet who did not say 'ugly' when he meant ill-behaved?" "Very true," said Vernon to Walter; and Walter went back into his book; and Vernon turned again rather eagerly to Agnes. "What were you going to sav?" "I was going to say, I believe, that I saw of course there might be, for instance, what my old nurse would call a 'pretty complected' reptile, or a livid plague- struck form perfect in proportion, or faultless features with an idiot's mind or a criminal's soul looking through them. Beauty and ugliness may be mingled." "And so, only, beauty and wickedness?" "I think only so." "What do you say to that?" asked Vernon, leaving his easel and bringing a sketch from a portfolio. "Superb!" cried Walter. "Who was it?--a model?" "No; a woman of rank. Is it not beautiful, Miss Agnes?" "Most beautiful-and yet " "Most wicked?" "Yes,--partly beautiful and partly wicked. O0 Walter, come to the rescue I Do not you hear what work your friend is making with the manners of your   AGNES WENTWORTH. little sister? Are you going to let him make me con- tradict him any more?"

"There, Mr. Vernon, you see what an -unprotected female I arnm I I appeal to your mercy." "But I do not see how I can possibly have any, until you go on with your analysis." "itCan you, if I do? Will you excuse my pertina- "The pertinacity is on my own side; but, if you will forgive it, I do really wish that I might hear. The ex- pression in the sketch, I suppose you will say, -and I agree,-is not good; but is not even the expression beautiful?", "The expression is very beautiful in some respects: it has fire; it has dauntlessness; it has loftiness; it has refinement, even; but it is surely, so far, not bad. But in these other respects I thinlk it is not beautiful: it is hard ; it is harsh; I think it is even false." "In a word, it is Lucrezia Borgia. Itwould not do for you to be a portrait-painter, Miss Agnes. " But, now, if you-if any man of genius--were to borrow these glorious brows and lips and eyes, and all that is not wicked, from this face, and paint a patrician martyr girl going grandly and gladly to the stake,- if he could elevate this selfish recklessnessinto a look of rapt inspired lovalty to God,-if he could make this scorn of fellow-creatures seem scorn only of the petty show of tools of torment by which her persecutors would frighten her from her fidelity,if he could soften p -:S  ".:-^..-he culd ofte  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7379-00000038"/> 7       AGNES WENT WOR TH. and sweeten this compressed, cruel mouth into pity and prayer for them,--if he could open this brazen falsehood into a look of deep, transparent, holy truth,--would not that picture be even more beautiful than this, Mr Ver- lon11? He bowed acquiescence with a glance of kindly and interested thought. He had learned, in his long for- eign loneliness, to think and feel instead of talking, and now often spoke least when he thought and felt most. "As much more beautiful as this looks than poor Lucrezia, I suppose, does now," continued Agnes, an- swering her own question. "Why, how do you suppose she looks now, my child?" cried he. "Could she look more like a beau- tiful fiend?" "Like an ugly fiend I supposed she looked now. I supposed that all beauty and genius and power were mixed with wickedness only in this world, like the wheat with the tares, and that in the other world they were taken from all who had made an unrighteous use of them, and divided among the faithful servants,- those who had been faithful to the best of their knowl- edge; and then I supposed that all guilt, with all idiocy and impotence. and ugliness, would roll away together into darkness, as the clouds from the sun." Vernon started from the easel, and put Lucrezia back into the portfolio as hastily as if a blast of sulphur were visibly threatening her rich hues and noble outlines. "Miss Agnes," said he, as he returned and took up his brushes, "of all the inferni I ever had a glimpse of, yours is the most horrible!"Well he might say so;   AGNES WENTWORTH.        73 for I believe that, to his peculiar organization, the con- templation of physical ugliness was even physical pain. He had known what it was to faint in the street .for want of a dinner when, by portraying an unsightly nobleman, he could have stocked his improvident bachelor larder for a month. Moreover, there were many times when he would almost have been readyto sell his soul for glory; and his invalid years were overshadowed more by the fear of losing his powers than of losing his life. Agnes answered not again. She was afraid that she had been talking-too much. Vernon silently began his vine-leaves. Silently she left the .room, and returned with a long and beautiful, dark and light branch from the old vine twinkling with the rain that was falling in the tiny garden. Silently she wreathed with it the top of his easel; and then, still silent, she-sat aloof and watched his work. "Thank you," said he, at last, turning suddenly to- ward her. "I did not thank you, did I, for the vine?" "Oh, yes,-by painting from it." The spell was broken.  She saw that Walter had gone to sleep; and, taking up a dry blender, she tickled his nose. He awoke, rubbing   it and quoting Dr. Watts, for the edification of her infant mind, to the effect that "Satan finds some mischief still 'i: For idle hands to do." "With such an uncanny alternative before you, Miss Agnes, perhaps you will permit -me to suggest some.

"For you?-I should be very happy." "For yourself. You do not paint; why not?" "Oh, do you suppose I could?" "I am sure you could,-more or less. In some de- ree it is a far more universal power than people lppose. " "Ah, but it would be such profanation to do it and o it badly!" "But that very feeling would save you from doing badly. I do not see why you should not do it very tell,-at least so far as copying goes; you have your fe all before you. I have seen that you revel in color. fannot you draw?"  "I Get your drawing-books, missy," said Walter, " and Mt Mr. Vernon see for himself." "Will you be so kind?" said he, encouragingly and ersuasively. * I should be perfectly delighted," answered she, vith unexpected alacrity, " especially the designs. Oh, hey always turn out so badly; and I cannot find out vhat the matter is." "Characteristic!" said Walter, laughing, as the door ,hut behind her. "What is?-sinking the self-consciousness of the in- lividual in the aspiration of the artist? A pity for all irt, that the characteristic is so uncommon 1" said Vernon. He had scarcely time to say more before Agnes was irith them again, out of breath with haste and eager- less, bringing five long, thin volumes, which she held   A GIVES WENTWORTH.       5 before him, stamped on the covers with her name and the dates: of the present and the last four years. He opened them with one hand, and peeped into them one after another. The first four were filled with copies. The last had, interspersed with these, original designs somewhat after the fashion of Agnes's conversation at this time,-pretty crude, but original and thoroughly in earnest. Agnes gazed meanwhile into his face, as if expecting her doom. He turned from her to the easel, laid down his palette and brushes, wiped his bands, then took the books from her, sat down, and went on through them steadily from the beginning, without saying a word, until she thought it was all over with her. When at last he looked up, he was surprised by the melancholy, utterly hopeless expression of her poor little face. It made him say more than he might have done otherwise: "Why, surely, surely there is nothing here to discourage you! You can draw,-well-ad- mirably for a person of your age. And you have not only ability, but you lhave that other rarer thing, -rare especially, if you can forgive my saying so, in women, -perseverance, without which ability hardly ever mel- lows into effective genius. Your power is not pre- cocity; it is a regular trustworthy growth, and there- fore full of promise for the future. See how childish those first things are; and then look at these last. If you improve for the next twenty years as- you have done for the last five, I shall be afraid of you, not for you, Miss Agnes." She looked as pleased as he, but not yet satisfied. \  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7379-00000040"/> G      A G yNES WEIVTWOC)HTI. ;he had encouragement; she wanted instruction. But the designs-I took the greatest pains with hem ; why are they not better?" "Probably because you are not older. Attempt hem still from time to time; stretch your wings, and hey will be all the more likely to grow. What is lecessary to a perfect design?" "That all the parts should be in keeping with the vhole?" "That is necessary to a good design, certainly. In i perfect design, I should say, each of the parts must )e essential to the whole. But copying should still be four chief business for the present. Above all, you have now to study color. There is a poetry of colors, Is there is a poetry of words. You would feel it at any rate, by nature, I dare say; the sense of it is a natural gift; but, in order to be able to make others feel it, you must put it in practice and master it early. If you please, and Mr. Wentworth has no objection, I should like to give you your first lessons myself, when- ever Walter has a spare hour to bring you here." "Thank you and thank you and thank you ten thou- sand times over! If I can only learn, I would rather than be crowned Queen of England. But they think at school, I anm sure, that there is some dreadful kind of stupidity about me," added she, blushing painfully. "Some things I teach myself; but nobody else, so far, can teach me anything." "All the more glory to mne, then, if I can," answered he, looking amused but undaunted; and so much of his confidence communicated itself to her that, after her father had given his careless consent, it was joy   A GNFES I.

Human motives are double perhaps oftener than they are single, and triple perhaps even oftener than they are double, .If there had been no such thing as Rosamond in the world, Vernon would probably still have been glad to give pleasure to his kind young hostess, and to pay off so easily a part of the large debt he owed her family.  As there was such a thing as Rosamond in the world, however, it is probable further that he hoped by making a little mystery of her brother's and sister's constant visits to the studio to induce her to accompany them, in order to see what they were about. Moreover, he would have given, if not his right hand, his left, for a chance to paint her in the character of Euphrosyne.  He could not bring himself to ask leave with a prospect of being refused; but surely Agnes might make the request for herself in all sisterly propriety, if once it was adroitly put into her head; and, if she undertook the matter, he must help her.  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7379-00000041"/> 78      AGNES WENT WORTH. CHAPTER    XIIL . ROSAMOND fell into the snare step by step. Not even art could make Agtnes untidy; and her frocks told no  tales. "Come and see," with a certain most roguish smile, which she had upon occasion, was the only answer she vouchsafed to her'sister's interrogatories as to what she could find to do so often in the studio; and "Come and see," was Walter's echo. Rosamond was lonely below when all the other young people were in the "Art Attic." Besides, she did not feel quite sure that she was doing well by her young sister in allowingo her to be there even with Walter. He was "a kind and honorable brother ;" but he was thoroughly thoughtless, and, very likely, less acquainted than herself with the little conventionalisms of young-ladyhood. She had a perhaps even exaggerated veneration for Agnes's pecu- liar simplicity and unconsciousness; and she could not bear to venture upon so much as a hint that might disturb them. She tried to dissuade her charge from "climbing " what they called " the steep of fame " so often, on the ground that :it might be an inconvenience to Vernon; but Vernon sent Walter for her; and Walter took her, with a hasty, "Oh, it's all right; she's wanted. You'd better come too." She thought of appealing to Mr. Wentworth, but decided that that measure would be as probably fruitless as certainly awkward. She was little better acquainted with him   AGNES WENT[VORTII        79 than with the man in the moon, and had little reason to suppose him better acquainted than the man in the moon with the management of an earthly family. 'It is really almost enough to make one sigh for a step- mother!" she ejaculated, in extremity; for the Misses Van Rooselandt, even if they once in a while did things they should not, never did them unchaperoned. Notwithstanding, she finally made up her mind that, if the Fates were perverse enough to impose upon a maiden of twenty-three the unbecoming part of a duenna, it was their affair, and not hers. So she picked up her crochet-ball, tripped nimbly up the many stairs past the green-papered story and the crimson- papered and the yellow-papered, listened for and heard her brother's and sister's voices within the studio-door, knocked, and was hailed with acclamation, panting, laughing, and blooming. Walter was seated on a  high stool, with one foot perched and one dangling, his meerschaum in his mouth, and a gold-spangled, deep-blue velvet smoking.- cap, that matched his hair and eyes, on his head. Agnes was at the easel, palette on thumb, and brushes and maulstick in hand. Vernon, at last enacting the part of the spider in "the prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy," was ushering Rosamond in and setting her a chair. "O Rosy, only see lI 've drawn him---, "And quartered me," chimed in Walter, "most un- comfortably." "And Mr. Vernon is giving me   lessons; and now I'm putting on the first coats.",  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7379-00000042"/> ;0      AGNES W}ENTWORTH. "Humph!" said Walter; "I'm glad the rest of my ,oats aren't quite so oleaginous or so fragrant." "Why, do you really mean you smell the paints? I lever do--much. O Rosy, isn't it like him?"  "'Not in complexion, I hope," protested Walter    i tgain, peering round the easel. "Sit still, you mauvais sujet!" cried the master, inscrewing a tube of Vert Veronese and driving him   j oack by the exhibition of it as a smelling-bottle; "take your pose; and let Miss Wentworth judge of the like- ness. " "'Leave me, leave me to re-pose!'" rejoined Walter, recoiling from the venomous little green vial; and Rosamond made her way up to the easel. "Why, you dear little Agnes, did you really draw that? It is as good as if you could have traced it from his looking-glass, some day when he was play- ing pranks with you at it; is not it, Mr. Vernon?" "It is, without flattery, as good as any first study by a novice that I ever saw," averred Vernon, as well he might. A "Ah, but, Mr. Vernon, you know you helped me," said Agnes, coloring with candor and delight. "Of course, here and there;--in the first few lessons cela va sans dire. I am not likely to offer you such help long, nor you to accept it.-A little more shadow here; but take care not to encroach on that light.- Miss Wentworth, would not you like to have me make room for you nearer this window?'" "Oh, no, thank you; I am doing perfectly well here," said Rosamond, devoting herself to her crochet. "True merit, I always heard, is fond of a"corner."   AGNES WENTWORTH.        81 The lesson proceeded. Agnes learned, and Vernon taught, in good earnest. He was too wary a spider to notice his fly much, openly; he could not help it if his eyes and cheeks grew the brighter and his smile and voice the sweeter for her presence. He only wished she would have let him draw her chair a little farther in front of the window; for then he could have watched the shadow of her profile on the wall. Still, it was very much to know that she was there, to hope that she would speak, to hear her speak sometimes, and to , know that she heard him. She was there for once, at any rate; and perhaps she would come again if he en- tertained her but let her quite alone. He talked to his pupil as if inspired. It was only of his art, in- deed; and for that, Rosamond in her inmost mind did not much care. However, there is always a fascina- tion about hearing a man of genius improvise on his favorite theme, whether it is one's own or not. Park-Street clock struck four. Walter punctually- sprang, like a refractory Pythia, from his tripod, de- claring that he would " lend his countenance to such nonsense no longer."  By that time, however, the crocheting Rosamond had made up her mind that she must needs oversee the lessons, whenever she could, in order to watch over the heart of her little sister; as she had not herself the heart to withhold from her, unless stronger cause should appear, so much im- provement and innocent enjoyment. Under such auspices, the portrait went on rapidly,- the portrait of a handsomer Walter in his gayest, sweetest mood. In order to this result, Vernon was naturally obliged to give his pupil more and more  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7379-00000043"/> 82      AGNES WENTWORTH. assistance; in fact, as the work advanced through the last processes, he was obliged to do it half himself. Agnes was grateful on the one hand, but, on the other, a little disappointed: "I shall value it much more than if I had done it myself, because it is so much better; but I can never call it mine,-except as its owner, which I am most happy to be. You could have painted faster and more finely by yourself, Mr. Vernon. I am very sorry to be so slow and so stupid." "So far as I may be allowed to be your judge, you are neither, Miss Agnes; but you have some reason to complain of your master. Painting is an art to be taught rather through the eyes than the ears. The way I ought to have taken with you, and the way I shall take the next time, if you please, is, to paint your subject before you, and let you follow, step by step, by example as well as precept." "4Oh, shall we try again? Whom  shall I take now? You, Rosy; couldn't I?" "Miss Wentworth might be rather difficult for you," suggested the diplomatic Vernon. "Mr. Wentworth would be an admirable study." !"If papa only would; but I am afraid he is too busy," said Agnes; and papa was too busy. ( Dear Rosy," coaxed the little artist, " if you would only let me try you I There is nobody else, except nurse; and if I made the picture like her, I am afraid she would think it was a caricature. And then it would be so very nice to have you to hang on one side of my mantel-piece, with Watty on the other! Should you mind sitting ,-in a comfortable little sew-   AGNES WENXTWORHE        8 ing-chair,-if Mr. Vernon makes no real objection,- just to oblige me?" Rosamond did not think she should. She was naturally obliging; and, being in general little inter- ested in painting and at the moment much interested in her piano-playing, she had altogether forgotten the plan of the double portrait. When she remembered it, Agnes had already applied to Vernon, and he had made no real objection. "Well," said Rosamond to herself, ," for a seasoned belle of five winters, you have been caught napping this time, my dear. However, it won't do to show any consciousness now. Mr. Vernon is an honorable man; and Aunty Van Rooselandt will be only too glad to buy his sketch when it is done; and, in the mean time, I  should really like to see how I look to him.   I have no particular objection to make to my looks; but really I can't say that they impress me inll my   glass, by any means, as they seem to do him, out of it." Accordingly, she put the best face she could upon the matter, and her most becoming afternoon dress upon her- self, and made her appearance, book in hand, at the studio. There were Vernon and Agnes, forewarned and forearmed, with their double apparatus of brushes, palettes, easels, and first-tinted canvases. She settled herself comfortably, and, coolly opening her book, said, "I may read, I  suppose?'" Vernon left Agnes to answer.        ; "Dear me, no, darling! You have to look at me, and look inspired and inspiring, of course.

Now, Mr. Vernon!-Oh, what a beautiful oval i" "Draw it tenderly; if it is too hard, you will lose the likeness. Now, be very careful of the nose; it must be regular, you see, and very spirited;-but, in vour drawing, is it not a little heavy?-That is better; -that is well. You can scarcely make the arches of the brows too perfect. Leave yourself room for the eyes;--they cannot be small, remember; and you want to throw into them mirth, 'sweetness, dignity, and depth,-four traits not very easy to find in combina- tion. Now lay out your whole strength upon the mouth; let it smile and speak and persuade and com- mand, all at once. Miss Agnes, is that like?" "No, indeed; nor that,-nor that,-nor that,-  nor that. Rosamond, why will you look so impos- sibly?" "No matter; difficulties do you good. To make a hard thing easy, try a harder," said Vernon. "I am afraid I could hardly find a harder thing than this is to do well." "No, I do not believe you could; but, if you can do justice to this, all other hard things should hencefor- ward be easy to you. Try again. See mine." "Perfectly beautiful. How could you do it so quick?" "It was like something I have had in my mind a long time," said Vernon. "Oh, dear, does he mean it, or doesn't he?" thought Rosamond. "Oh, what a galere I have got myself into! I shall be glad of a peep at that picture, though. If his painting is really more beautiful than his looking   A GNES WENTWORTH.        85 * at this moment, I run a sad risk of being vainer than ever." "Is that better?" said Agnes. "Very much. Curve the crest of the lip a little more,-delicately-like that of a wave before it breaks. There, that will do-at least, as well as we can do- for the drawing. Now-are you very weary, Miss Wentworth?" "Oh, no," said Rosamond, who thought the sooner she could get through with the whole business the bet- ter; " and, if you are not, I think it might be best to go on as far as possible; for I don't know that I shall be able to sit many times. But may not I see now what you have done?" "If you wish it very decidedly,-certainly," said Vernon. "But, unless you wish it very decidedly indeed, we would very much rather not have you," said the straightforward Agnes. "Mr. Vernon says that show- ing any work of art, while it is in progress, is like show- ing a bird's-nest while it is building ;--ten to one the bird or the mood is driven away and never comes back, or comes only to do its business very awkwardly." "We will not run any such risks, then," answered Rosamond, with her usual good humor. She was really interested in the success of this one "work of art" of Vernon's, in the course of, and by means of, which she was in- a fair way to know more than she had ever known before about the sundry excellencies of her outlines, hues, and expressions. A few sittings finished it; but then it was still to be dried, varnished, and framed, before it was to be seen 8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7379-00000045"/> 86      AG NES  VECNTWORTH. except by Walter, who would not be kept from hover- ing over it like a fly, though he did so only on condition of his not uttering his opinion in so much as a single buzz. CHAPTER XIV. VERY radiant was Vernon- the evening that his por- trait went off for its frame, and the next morning at breakfast. Very murky he looked, however, the next noon at luncheon, and could scarcely eat or speak. He murmured some slight unintelligible excuse to Agnes for giving her no lesson, borrowed the ponderous bronze library inkstand, as if for some emergency to which the little Sekres one in his chamber was altogether inade- quate, and stalked upward with steps as hard and heavy as Air. Wentworth's own. "What is the matter with him?" said Walter, look- ing after him. "I do not know," said Rosamond. "What can be?" said Agnes. "He said he was per- fectly well." "That means, at any rate, that he does not choose to be questioned, I suppose," said Walter. "Not bad news from home, I hope. John," (the servant at that moment came in), " any letters to-day?", "Yes, sir; one for )Mr. Wentworth, sir; that was all, sir." "1 None for Mr. Vernon?"   A NES WENTWOR V.      e  87T. "No, sir." "Why!" exclaimed Agnes, with a note of dismay, as she opened a fresh copy of a New York newspaper that lay on the table. "What?" rejoined her sister and brother; "what is it?" "Such a hateful, conceited, absurd critique upon Mr. Vernon's Isabella and Columbus!" "Ah!" said the legal Walter, coming up to the table; "and here is the paper-knife on the floor; and the leaves are cut,-of that piece and no other. He has been reading it; and now the murder's out. Well, I am glad if it's no worse. Silly fellow! Who cares for these things but the critic and the critic ee?-I shall go and ask him." Walter did go, and very likely did ask him, but proba- bly did not get much in the way of an answer; as he soon came down again, and told Agnes that he was right in his guess. Vernon was simply beside himself at that "article," but Walter "should not wonder if those Knickerbockers found they had waked up the wrong passenger;" for Vernon was at work with might and main at an answer; and that was a game at which nobody was "likely to beat him, unless they could knock up the very ghost of Junius." Those who were behind the scenes at that time knew of a certain "art-critic in art-journals," as he would no doubt have called himself, who has since, as a man, happily survived himself as a writer, but who was, in his literary lifetime, a sore thorn in the side of some of his sensitive betters. The critic proper, like the poet, is born, not made; but this critic improper was made,  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7379-00000046"/> 88      AGNES WENTWORTH. not born. He was a well-meaning, well-educated, and wealthy man, with much taste for art, though not much taste in art. He bought the pictures of some popular artists, and with their pictures their golden opinions. He feasted and flattered certain editors, and inveigled them into printing his critical essays, which "Really had been quite as well Hushed up among his friends." When they could-and were wise-they kept him upon the mediaevals; and there, being studious and painstaking, and having the matured opinion of the world to guide him, he did pretty well. It was not often that his remarks were of a nature to give any pain or to do any harm to Raphael or Correggio. Titian he patronized; and nothing could exceed his complaisance to Michael Angelo. But now and then, in order to keep him contented, it became necessary to let him try his dull scalpel upon a new and living sub- ject; and then woe unto that subject! How he would hack and hew and fumble and grope at random among the nerves and vitals, anaesthetized himself by his own purblindnessl He had been growing restless of late; and Vernon, being a bird of passage, with no special interest in the Middle States, was conveniently pitched upon for his victim. What to make of his victim the art-critic did not know. Was it fowl, or only an odd fish? Mr. Agas- siz says that is not always an easy question to an- swer. Vernon was a genius; and genius, especially when in its youth, is wont to be a puzzling thing to   AGNES -WENTWORTH.        89 those who have not any.* His pictures had been as yet little seen and less understood. It rested with our "art-critic" to give the cue, with regard to them, to an influential Mutual Admiration Society to which the "art-critic" belonged. What to do, then, he honestly could not tell. He did after his kind; he ran for luck. He had not seen all the pictures himself; that made little difference; he questioned his wife's sister, an accomplished young lady, who had seen all the pictures. He said "chiar- oscuro," and "breadth," and "tone," a good many times, in a manner to prove his general information. Then, in a manner to prove his general benevolence, he gave Vernon much credit for sundry excellencies which he had not. ,But by way of proving his impar- tiality; and having besides, as the literary lads of our day are too apt to have, the "Saturday Review" upon the brain, he urgently put our hero " on his guard against a lamentably manifest tendency to Southern shoddy and finery." Especially he bemoaned himself and his prey over "the cabinet picture of Isabella and Columbus, which might have been really noble, had the figures, instead of being dressed as if by the tailor and mantuamaker, been draped in the grand style as if by the artist."

Still, it is not for me as a connoisseur to presume to defend that quaint little exquisite gem, which has since received the highest praise from some of the highest authorities at home and abroad. But, speaking only after the manner of a man, I beg leave to say that my copy of it is the first thing I should try to save if my house were on fire. And further, still after the manner of a man, I aver that as, just now, I cheer my literary toils by looking up at it on the wall of that den of which I am a denizen, I can hear-with ear or eye,-it does not matter which,-the very rustle and whistle of Isabella's antique brocade, sweeping along around and after her across the mosaic floor of the au- dience-chamber, mingled with the tinkling jingle of the massy gold chain of the stately Genoese, as, following reverently, he murmurs his earnest broken Spanish near her side. I scent the roses whose soft fragrance her plumy fan wafts towards me, as she says, with a queenly smile full of sweet hope and promise, "We will go to our lord the king." And it is all so vivid and real that a European traveller once told me that when, some time after a first hasty view of it, it came up again in his memory, he could not without some tedious self-examination satisfy himself whether or no it was some scene in actual life that he himself had lived in. It is this reality which to my mind is one of the surest tests of real creative power; and this reality "the grand style,"--unless Homer's is the grand style,- never gives. That painting was the first which had revealed to Vernon, and to the few of us who already knew and   AGNES WENTWORTH.        91 believed in him, beyond a doubt his possession of that power. , Accordingly, he loved it as himself, and rever- enced it,-as the true artist does revere his true work, -as something higher and nobler than himself. Fur- ther, ascetic in most things both by choice and neces- sity, I really believe he thought it his mission to wean his countrymen, in the interest of high art, from the frip- pery lust of the eye and the pride of life; wherefore to be accused of pandering to them made him ready to foam at the mouth. Furthermore, he had hoped through this painting to obtain an order for a life-size copy for the Capitol at Washington, through that order to obtain other orders, both public and private, and through those orders to obtain Rosamond Wentworth; among all which unhatched eggs,--roc's eggs as they were,- which he had been counting, the art-critic was dancing. Vernon came punctually down to dinner, flushed, taciturn, still abstemious,--though contrary to his custom he drank a glass or two of Champagne,--and awfully polite. When- the other gentlemen followed the ladies into the library, his steps were heard again on his "winding wayy" to his room. When summoned to tea, he promptly reappeared, and poured four cupfuls down his throat, scalding hot; after which he vanished anew, and was seen no more below that night. The house was dull; for Agnes was sorry, Rosa- mond writing to Mrs. Van Rooselandt, and Walter out. At twelve, when he came home, Agnes whispered to him through the crack of her chamber-door, and begged him to see that Mr. Vernon did not sit up all night and make himself ill, for she could hear him every few minutes walking the floor overhead.  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7379-00000048"/> "All right," said the obliging Walter. He ran up, tapped at Vernon's door, and presently went in. The sound of footsteps ceased, and was succeeded by that of voices,-Vernon's, Agnes thought, reading aloud in a high, excited kevy, and interrupted from time to time by a burst of laughter in Walter's. Then Vernon's door, and then Walter's, opened and shut. She gently closed and locked her own; and all was still for the night. At breakfast, the next morning, Vernon took strong coffee, but still seemed unable to eat. His eyes were bloodshot, his cheeks hollow, and his whole counte- nance haggard. He was not cheerful, precisely, but talkative, facetious, and flighty. Agnes had never seen him when she liked him so little or pitied him so much. '"Vernon has been and gone and done it," said tardy Walter triumphantly, as she ministered to his necessi- ties after the others had left the breakfast-room. "He read me his answer last night. It's the most finished piece of blasting sarcasm, I'd lay you any wager, that ever was written on this side of the water. He needn't tell us he is old Randolph of Roanoke's kinsman. Every word bites; every bite stings; and every sting is barbed. It will stick to that dunce as long as he lives." Agnes turned pale, and poured out Walter's tea into the sugar-bowl. "Dear Walter," cried she, " he surely will not publish it!" "Yes, he will,-in a rival newspaper that will be only too glad to get it. There aren't many hands, good at the brush, that are as good at the pen as Vernon's.-   A GNES WENTWORTH.        93 Itt will sell the whole edition; it's a perfect mosaic of scorpions' tails. We shall see fun." "Oh, but, dear Walter, persuade him,-do not let him publish it I It does not seem worthy of Mr. Ver- non to let himself down to the level of dunces-for pri- vate revenge.," "You think we could make that sort of doctrine go down with a Southerner?" "I hope you could, if a Southerner was a gentleman and a Christian. " In their preoccupation they either did not notice steps that were coming in from the passage, or thought they were John's; but it was Vernon who spoke be- hind them in a rather constrained voice: "I beg your pardon; I fear I intrude." "No, you don't, brother of my soul, either now or ever," said Walter, turning round and pushing a chair toward him; " on the contrary, .you have a particu- larly good right to a share in our discussion." "As to whether a Southerner can be a Christian and a gentleman?" said Vernon, coloring; but, even as he said it, he smiled, softened alike by Walter's  good humor and by a glance at Agnes's face. "I fear I have given all my friends too much reason to doubt it,' he continued, "for the last twenty-four hours, in spite of myself. Forgive me; you will both of you forgive and forget, will you not? Walter knows-in part he knows-how much I have had to throw me off my balance; but I believe now I have the odds on my own side.)" Agrnes could not speak. Walter did it for her. "You misapprehend the ques-  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7379-00000049"/> "      AGNES WENTWORTH. tion a little. It was not as to the qualities of a South- erner as a guest; those our own experience would lead us to rate very high. It was as to the qualities of a Northerner as a friend; there this-little sister of mine was taking me to task; and I am beginning to fear that I shan't be able to get up much of a defence." Vernon was thoroughly perplexed; and his perplex- ity acted upon his ire much as turning a refractory horse round three times does upon its disposition to run away. He looked more and more present with them and absent from the art-critic, and said, taking the offered chair, "And is this the woolsack, and am I the judge? Observe, I am in a dilemma; for I have the strongest possible prepossession in favor both of the innocence of the defendant and of the wisdom and mercy of the plaintiff. Now, Walter, what have you been doing to me?" "That is for the opposite counsel to say." "She enters a nolle prosequi, you see," said Vernon. "Then she becomes an accessory after the fact." "Then, Miss Agnes, I am to infer--am I?-that you quite give up the cause of your old friend, and will not speak when a word from you might save him.--It is a severe punishment, but not more severe, I dare say, than he, deserves for his tigrerie," said Vernon, now half in jest and half in earnest. "No, indeed, Mr Vernou," cried' Agnes, taking him wholly in earnest, and fairly driven to bay. "To convince you that I do not think you deserve any pun- ishmnent at all I will speak, if nothing else would make lie But if you think it is the very spirit of presump- lion that speaks in me, remember you spoke to it first;   A GNES WENTWORTZf.       95 and then, by the common law of ghosts, it had to an- swer. Walter was telling me what a wonderfully powerful answer you had written to that unfortunate notice of your beautiful picture, and that you were going to print it, and how admirable it was-in some respects-but----" "' But'?" echoed Vernon encouragingly to, Agnes, while he shook his head mischievously at Walter. "But that it would make people very angry; and I was beginning to tell him, I thought the part of a good friend would be to beg you not to publish it." Ag- nes was fairly in for it now, and, with brightening eyes and flushing cheeks, rushed on, as people do when they catch themselves running down too steep a mountain, faster and faster to keep themselves from a downfall "O Mr. Vernon, it is fit and right that all the fellow-creatures of great geniuses should look up to them; but is it good for them to look down on their fellow-creatures? If an angel were sent to hover over this world and make it seem more bright and beautiful, and a few ignorant, silly people threw mud at him, .and he came down to return their blows, would it not be-  " she hesitated. "A come-down on the part of the angel," suggested the helpful Walter promptly. "Yes," said Agnes, laughing and taking breath; "that precisely. And oh, Mr. Vernon, it made me think of the life of poor Haydon; you have read it?" "No; will you please to tell me about it?I' "He fell into a quarrel in his youth, that imbittered: his after-life.

But,  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7379-00000050"/> instead, he wrote and wrote; and such a nest of hor- nets he stirred up, within and without him! Would it not have been much better for him to forgive them, and paint calmly on without minding them, trying to get the better of them through his work?" pleaded Agnes, becoming in her zeal somewhat confused in her rhetoric. Vernon was amused alike by that confusion and by the artless enthusiasm which led to it. His pleased look, which she did not quite understand, emboldened her to go on. "He would have been a much greater artist if he had been a greater Christian,-more unworldly.-And this poor man, who thought he knew so much, and knew no better than to attack you,-is not he to be pitied? O Mr. Vernon," cried she, clasping her hands involuntarily, "you do not know how dreadful it is not to be a genius HAnd Walter says your satire will cling to him for life. Do you know who he is?- Is he a bad man, on the whole, do you think?" "No; on the contrary, I understand he has every merit under the sun, except ability and humility," said the candid Vernon, who was himself in those days, before the sympathy of others had softened and their admiration had humbled him, rather prouder than Lucifer. "And now he will lose even what merit he has,-- he will -be so filled with resentment and anger. O Mr. Vernon, it is so bad--don't you think so?-for anybody to be angry!-Am I giving too much good advice?" "Not for me," said Vernon. "I thank you for every   A GNrES WENT WORTH.       97 word, past or to come. I listen to it as some other sinners love to read the Bible, and hope as they do that I may find grace to act upon it,-some other time if not now."' The tone in which he spoke was altogether kind, re- spectful, and sincere; but the speech was not such:as to lead Agnes to say more. She arose and went up to the library, disappointed in him, and abashed by a sense of having been herself but a weak advocate in a good cause. The young men soon followed. She heard their voices as they came up the stairs. "Find it, John," said Walter, "and bring-it up here."- "Thank you," returned Vernon; "I wished to make assurance doubly sure on one point in it, before I sent off my manuscript." They came in. John presently followed with a thick newspaper, which he handed to Walter, and Walter to Vernon. It was the peccant "weekly." Vernon unfolded and threw it open; when out flew and fell around him, a perfect shower of little printed papers in the shape of fools'-caps and feathers, into which the peccant essay proved to have been com- pletely cut up. "What's all this?" cried Walter. "Indeed, sir, I can't imagine, sir," cried the literary John, aghast. "It hadn't but only just went into the kitchen, sir. I'm very sorry, sir.'" "And so you ought to be, sir!" said Mr. Went- worth, who had a particularly high sense of the invio- lability of all documents, written or printed. "If anything of this kind happens again, you will take no I        9  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7379-00000051"/> newspapers below stairs henceforward until they are a week old.                 " "Ndi o, sir, thank you, sir," said Joln, retreating in disorder. "Papa," said Agnes in a low voice, " please not to blame John. I'm very sorry,-it was I " "John," called the old gentleman,-and the discom- fited John recrossed the thresliold,-- I am glad to hear that it was not your fault.--That is all." "Yes, sir, thank you, sir." John again made his retreat; and, if she had thought it quite dignified, Agnes would have been only too thankful to follow his example. "I am very sorry indeed, if you wanted it," she re- peated to Vernon. "And so you ought to be," Mr. Weitworth might have repeated to her, if they had been alone or if she had been a very little younger. As it was, he con- tented himself with saying, "What could have pos sessed you, my dear?" "H thought everybody had done with it." "A rather poor reason," said he, taking up his hat and gloves, and leaving the room. "And a rather inscrutable one," said the intolerable Walter. "Try again, Agny." "Well, I was angry myself then, last night," said Agnes, "if I  must own it Just at first, who could possibly help it?" she added, very red at being de- ;ected in a piece of practice so opposed to her preach- $ [ng; and then a sense of the comicality of the detection 'ushed upon her. Walter was not the man to lose any point of that.   A GNES WENT WORKT11.      99 "Ha, ha, ha!" shouted he. "It is- so bad for any- body to be angry! Ho, ho, ho, 'Angel of patience, sent to calm!'- and so forth, and so forth, and so forth." The infection of Walter's laugh was always irre- sistible, especially to Agnes; hers joined it now like a chime of fairy-bells; and she laughed on uncontrollably till checked by the thought of Vernon. How would he, in his present mood, take such silly behavior? He had walked to the further end of the library, and was coming back. He laughed with them, but not loud nor long. He came up to her, and took both her hands for an instant in his. She thought that there were tears in his eyes; but he left her again so quickly and suddenly that she could scarcely tell. He stood before the hearth, took a match from the mantel-piece, and lighted it Then he drew from his pocket a roll of paper and, turning, silently held it toward her. Stepping forward, she read at the top of it, in his re- markably symmetrical and spirited handwriting, the words "Carnifex Carnificatus."  She would have received it from his hand; but he withdrew it, held it over the pan, and made a funnel of it for the match. In a moment more it was thrown under the grate, all in flames; and- their cruel blue and yellow dragons' tongues had licked and sucked it down into the ashes, before she fairly knew what he was doing. He heaved a deep sigh, but checking it said, as if with the last half of it, "A bonfire for you, Miss Agnes, in return for your fools'-caps," -and was gone. before she recovered presence of mind enough to answer.  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7379-00000052"/> 100     AGNES WENTWORTE. CHAPTER XV. BEFORE long, however, Vernon was in the library again, with his broad-brimmed felt hat in one hand and his sketching-box in the other. "Walter," said he, "you promised to show me the Waverley oaks and water-fall some day; why not to-day?" "The very day for it]" cried Walter, who never knew a holiday come out of season. "And will you not join us, Miss Agnes, and take a sketching-lesson? We have both of us lost a day; but it shall not be my fault if it happens again." Agnes's eyes lighted up: "Oh, thank you; and per- haps my  sister can come too. We will carry our luncheon; and papa ordered dinner an hour later than usual. How fortunate 1" She ran up to Rosamond, who demurred a little but presently consented. She ran down  to nurse, who demurred likewise but presently set forth bread, butter, ham, and mustard on the dining-room table. She called Walter, who at first conducted himself like one of Hotspur's " spirits from the vasty deep," and would not come when she did call to him but who, being once fairly caught and brought by Vernon and tied, at her bidding, into a clean checked apron of nurse's, speedily became tractable. He carved and minced fat and lean, as if for a wager; Agnes, mean- time, buttered the ends of alternate loaves of bread; and the sure-handed Vernon, taking them from her in turn,   AG NES WENTWORTH.       101 shaved them off as thin as yellow-rose-leaves. With such spirited assistance on the part of the youths, the maiden soon had the provender converted into a snowy, pink-lipped mound of unsurpassable sand- wiches, and compactly packed in a moist damask napkin. Then Walter was sent to the cellar for Seltzer-water and bottled cider; while Vernon went into the garden for vine-leaves to line the great Fayal basket, which Agnes was extorting from Mrs. Tibbets and emptying of its store of small table-linens. Lastly the little mistress, coming in from the pantry with her apron full of rare-ripe peaches, fitted them into every chink; and a picturesque load it was that Walter had to carry. "That is more than I shall want," remonstrated Walter, as Agnes put the handle of the basket into his lazy hand. "But no more than you can carry, dear," answered she unrelentingly. "And you will not have so much to bring back," added Rosamond for his consolation. "I could carry it better now, if it was better disposed," persisted the grumbler, as they turned up by the State- House toward the railroad station; "stage-coaches divide their passengers between outside and in. Those sandwiches looked very delicate; why shouldn't I give an inside place to them?" In short, after the manner of merry young people on a junket, they talked more nonsense  than I dare repeat,. and laughed at it more than- I dare report. The spirits of them all were high, more or less, for different reasons: Verrion's' were so with the conscious- g*  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7379-00000053"/> 102     AGNES WENTWORTI[. ness of a victory over himself, of an act of magnanimous forbearance, as it seemed to him, toward an enemy, and one of gratitude scarcely less magnanimous to ward a good little sympathizing school-girl. Agnes was the lighter-hearted for a sense of peril escaped, and of a friend and benefactor saved from an un- becoming act and its consequences. The pleasure- loving Rosamond was happy, because she had a pleasant novelty to enjoy; and Walter, finally, was so because he was idle. After being in the close, smoky steam-cars just long enough to be glad to be out of them, they alighted in pretty, wild, open country. The brisk reaction of September was just setting in upon the dog-days. The air was dry, clear, and just cool enough to be, even to Southern Vernon, not chilling but bracing. Even the strong heat of the unclouded sun was enervating no longer, but stimulating. Helping and cheering on one another, they chased the waterfall by the sound, along the clear, pebbly brook, into and through the wood. They struggled together through thickets richly studded with the berries of jetty print, coral nightshade, and grayish- blue cedar. They scrambled over loose-piled walls of unhewn stones, and sprang from  block to block of rock matted and hidden with a thick tapestry of green chenille moss. All merrily vied with one an- other in the most assiduous, solicitous, and flattering if not wholly disinterested, attentions to Walter, the basket-bearer. These he did his best to acknowledge, by making a feint of losing his balance in the very middle of the venerable but most unstable plank   A GNES WENTWORTH.       103 which spans the summit of the waterfall. Being in- stantly succored and pulled and propelled across, by means of a simultaneous and most unanimous poking and hooking of parasols and sketching-umbrella before and behind, he lost no time in sinking down on the bank of the little glassy lake, and declared himself un- able to proceed unless restoratives should be admin- istered upon the spot,-which they were. The party all seated themselves then and there, with still waters before and falling waters behind and beneath them, and gave themselves up at their ease, with youthful zest, to the enjoyment of themselves, one another, the scene, and the day. Rosamond was,--so at least Vernon thought,--even for her, peculiarly merry and kind. She had seldom looked quite so lovely as she saw herself now in the lake at her feet. She had that genuine, essential beauty for all times and places, which belongs only to the richest organizations and the most perfect health. Her nut-brown curls were lifted and tossed by the breeze; they were all the more picturesque. Her hazel eyes were darkened and brightened with mirth and enterprise. Her smooth, brunette skin, neither suf- fused nor paled with fatigue, as that of a weaklier woman would have been, was warmed and cleared by exercise and laughter into its most gorgeous and Titian-like brilliancy. It seemed a beautiful Undine that looked archly up at her through the clear, crystal water, robed in the softest, purest green, and crowned, -as she was by the zealous hands of Agnes, with a wreath of oak-leaves and young acorns. She no longer remembered to steel herself against o  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7379-00000054"/> 104     A GNES WENT WOR TH. Vernon. Here, under the trees and on the turf, away from fripperies and fineries, he appeared-with his beauty, his chivalrous courtesy and grace,-with the wild charm of the tales and legends that he told, and the passionate melody of the songs he sang,-in his own individual manhood, as rich as man might be. She, looking upon him, forgot the future in the present. He, seeing her smile upon him, forgot the present in the future. So they all smiled, chatted, laughed, and sang to- gether for a delicious little while; and then, for a little while still more delicious, the spirits of the woods and waters overcame them. Their own voices died away; and in an enchanted day-dream they sat listening to those of the birds, the breezes, and the brook, and scarcely thought but, rather, dimly felt in the mimic Eden that surrounded them, how beautiful an earthly immortality of youth, summer, friendship, love, and out-door happiness might be. But the wanton Walter would not long leave the others in peace to their unwritten poetry. With a dreadful lapse into prose he began, with the sketching- umbrella, to poke and stir up a frog, and to ask it how it would like its hind-legs broiled for supper. Where- upon Agnes, the indiscriminate guardian of the brute creation, proposed an instant diversion in favor of the oaks. She was seconded by Vernon, who started up remembering that who would win must work, and rescued the desecrated umbrella from the profane hands of Master Wentworth. To the oaks then they went; and under and -before the oaks they sat down again. Vernon took two ob-   AGNES WENTWORTH.        105 longs of academy-board from his box, and began to sketch and to teach Agnes. Soon, however, one of his moods of irresistible inspiration came upon him. She could not keep up with him, nor would keep him waiting for her. With an agreement that he should make her amends another time, they were both glad to settle it, that for the present he alone should sketch and she look on. Vernon was not one of that modern school of artists who painfully flay-Nature alive by inches, and present you with a patchwork only of her skin; he painted her soul and body. Agnes straightway saw one magnifi- cent oak, full of lusty life, spring and project itself out of the forming picture under his hand. It tossed its wide armfuls of green about as if to catch all the sun- beams and to defy and ward off the clouds. But at the foot lay another at its length, dead, stripped and stark. Next the childlike watcher, with infinite delight and glee, saw the green boughs beginning to swarm with little, peeping, lurking fairies,-among them one at the top with a tiny crown and sceptre and the features of Rosamond, one below bearing the face of Vernon, and between them another, identified with herself by its blue robe and yellow hair, but with an averted counte- nance, which impressed on her with a passing pang the conviction that Mr. Vernon, like Mrs. Tibbets, found less to commend in the front than in the back of her head. And next, after a little puzzling and a few experi- mental splashes on the corner of Agnes's board, Walter was seen astride of a wind-tossed twig, in the char- acter of Puck; while old nurse rode around him in the air on a broom-stick. So much done, Vernon began to  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7379-00000055"/> 106     A GNES WENTWIORTH. set in a dim procession similar figures upon the fallen oak, dressed not in flowery but in ashen hues. Their attitudes were those of mourning; and in their hands they trailed sprays of cypress and love-lies-bleeding. And still Agnes watched in silence, and forgot all besides. But Rosamond broke in on the silence, looking up from the novel she was reading: "Shall not we have a shower?" "Looks like it," answered Walter phlegmatically, as he lay on his back on the turf with his cigar in his mouth, surveying the west through the little rings of smoke he was tossing up, one after another, with a skill which bore witness to much practice. "Oh dear, I hope not," cried Agnes, "before Mr. Vernon has time to finish his sketch I You have not put Walter in there, yet; have you?" "No; I am in two minds about it. I can't imagine Puck weeping, except with his fists in his eyes, which would not be tragic." "But rather Gothic, might it not?"' "More grotesque than picturesque, I fear. Cannot you think of something else?" "I wish I could. He might be handing about a lily-bell by way of a tear-bottle; but then, unless peo- ple were told, I do not see how they ever should know what it meant." The beautiful extravaganza pro- ceeded; and they were again lost in fairy-land. But Rosamond had risen from her seat under the tree and was moving restlessly, and anxiously looking at the sky.  "Dear Walter, the clouds are so very black! Why did you not tell us?"   AGNESS WENTWORTH.       10T "Why, I did not- see what you could do about it. If you were a pearl-powdery lady, and happened to have your puff-ball in your pocket, I might climb up the tree perhaps and try it on that ague-cheeked fellow nearest overhead."           ' . Rosamond was too uncomfortable to laugh at non- sense any more. By some anomaly in her vigorous nature which, as I do not understand it, I do not un- dertake to explain, she, who was seldom weak and. never on any other occasion timid, was always made miserable by a thunder-storm. There was no affecta- tion about the matter,-of so much at least I am sure. Whatever her other failings might be, no one who knew Rosamond Wentworth could suspect her of affectation.-In fact she was ashamed to own it; and thus it happened that Walter did not know of it; or he - would not have made so light of her uneasiness. "My hat and humming-bird will be ruined," said she, wish- ing to make use of a plea whose force he could appre- ciate. "I'm at your service, if you'd like to go," said he, rising and making an unburnt sacrifice to her of one half of his cigar. "Thank you; but where? The storm will be down upon us before we can reach the station. Oh, that forked lightning 1" Walter, seeing her turn pale, darted up a near knoll and took an observation. "There's a pleasant-looking, odd old farm-house close by," said he hurrying back to her. "Come, Rosy, give me your hand; and I'll run you up there before you know it. House, or barn at all events, will take you in safe enough; and J  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7379-00000056"/> 108     AGNES WENTWORTH. dare say the shower won't last five minutes. Come, artists." As the first pair started, the second pair stood up; but it was to face the storm, not to fly from it. The strong gale, that comes before the rain, struck them bringing with it the dust of unseen lands. Agnes threw her girlish head far back till she saw no more of earth, but only a deep, dark dome hung with hurried clouds above her, striped with lightnings, and rimmed with the tops of tossing trees. Vernon reared himself for a moment, tall and fiery, drinking in the spirit of the whole scene, with the wind sweeping 'his fine dark hair wildly back from his brow and flashing eyes. Then he threw himself down again, caught up his sketch, and began to dash in the awful pile of clouds before them for a background, instead of the clear insipid blue that was there before. "I Oh, set in it the bow of promise," cried Agnes, "spanning the living and the dead!" "I will, God willing," answered he, nodding to her and painting on. Vernon seemed more and more surcharged with the electricity that quivered and flickered in the air. Never before had he painted with such ease and speed. His brush flew as if of itself. Never before had he looked so proudly, grandly happy,--so lifted above the hinder- ances and shackles of this life. Agnes did not know where most to gaze,-at the rush of the real or of the painted storm, or at him who seemed the incarnate spirit of them both. Beside, and a little behind him, she was so still that he forgot that he was not alone. When he spoke, it was only to the closing and overshadowing   AGNES WENTWORTH:       109 clouds: "Keep off,-a little longer!-It is one of the moments of life that do not come twice in a lifetime!" -and then, when the thunder came and roared so that the deep murmur of his voice could scarcely be heard: -"Again-more music-more!" Till a strong hand laid upon her shoulder made her start and turn, Agnes did not perceive that Walter was near,-was come to make them go. "Thank you,-presently," said Vernon as if talking in his sleep. "It is a remarkably dry storm." "Oh, must- I really? Oh, Watty! Only see how grand it is!" cried Agnes. "Only see what a grand ducking we 'shall get," panted he, with unperturbed good humor but making off with her as fast as he could. "Didn't you hear me call you?" "Why no; did you?" "So loud you thought I was the thunder, I suppose. Why didn't you come with us? We thought you were close at our heels." "We did not know when you went nor where, that I can remember. Good luck, wasn't it?" added she laughing, as they reached the farm-yard. "For you it might have been, if you like to have your dresses washed without troubling the laundress; -for Vernon it will be, if he wants to have his land- scape in water-colors. What a maniac he isl His finger and thumb will have a rheumatic fever apiece, and be cripples for life." Agnes turned instead of entering the house, and looked back. No Vernon was in sight. "He does seem too delicate to bear much exposure, to be sure," said 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7379-00000057"/> "O     AGNIVES WENT WOR TI. she. "I remember I heard him shiver and catch his breath as he worked; and the wind is pretty keen. Dear Walter, couldn't you borrow an umbrella and go back and bring him?" "Yes, and no, my dear. I could borrow an um- brella and go back." "He would come, if you took away his paints." "'I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none.' You had better go in and keep warm with Rosamond, hadn't you?-in there,-on the right. I will see what I can see in the barn. " Agnes went in and, after the first welcome and acknowledgments, sat in prim school-girl silence, list- ening while Rosamond assisted their hostess in making talk. But five minutes seemed fifteen; for the older sister was much less lively and more commonplace than usual; and the younger, anxious about Vernon. Besides, the child of the city was bewitched by the scene without. It carried her out of herself; she could not give it up. She took a seat by the window,--but the window was shut,-and then in the porch; and then she went as far as the paling and looked over. And then a sudden thought-half fun, half earnest- seized her, that she could steal Vernon's paints and then he must come in. There was no time to think it over. It was now or never. Agnes was fleet of foot; and off she ran. She remembered the ground. The wind bore her on. It seemed to her that she flew. She was behind Vernon,-behind the oak under which she had left   AGNES WENTWORTH.        1" him. She peeped noiselessly and cautiously around it. With his back to her, and to it, he still gat beneath it transported,-talking to himself or to the storm, glancing and painting. She stretched her hand warily out as his face was turned skyward; she snatched the paint-box and made off with it. Beating back, burdened, against the wind was harder; but she did it. The precious box was under cover; and she had not once been missed. Rosamond, shading her eyes from the now frequent flashes at doors and windows, was engrossed with the hard task of concealing her trepidation. Accustomed, too, to Agnes's fits of silence she believed her to be all the time close by, and had neither fear nor suspicion of her being, as other silent young creatures are apt to be, in mischief. But, by the time Agnes had got her breath again, a fatal flaw in her stratagem had shown itself to her. Vernon might indeed be forced to stop painting; but how would he know where they had gone or where he should go?.-The rain still held off; though the gale was every instant stronger and wilder. She darted back once more. The moment was favorable. The spell which held Vernon had been weakened by the mysterious disap- pearance of part of his tools. He had put down his palette and brushes to the leeward of the oak, with a heavy stone upon them to keep them steady, and was doing something with his knife to his sketch, bending intently over it. She dexterously made prize of the deposit, made good her retreat to the top of the knoll, and there, at safe distance, called his name. Her high,  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7379-00000058"/> "2     A GNES WENT WOR TH. clear voice was blown on to him above all the other noise. He sprang to his feet and saw her. She looked like a white angel just alighted there, with its sky-blue robes swayed and tossed. She held up her booty as a lure, beckoned, pointed, and flew away again. There was little time for protestations on his part; nor could he make her hear them. Moreover the wind blew them back down his throat, and forced him to eat his own words with an unpleasant admixture of sand and gravel. Consoling himself with the dim recol- lection of a nursery adage, that every son of earth must sooner or later consume a peck of the substance of his parent, he started in pursuit of his property, half vexed and half entering into the spirit of his pupil's practical joke. But, burdened with the sketch, he op- posed too broad a front to the wind; and he was ex- hausted with late worry and later work. Agnes was outstripping him more and more; and the farm-house was in sight; when he and she were at once blinded and deafened by a simultaneous flash and crash, which seemed to strike the light out of the heavens and the earth from beneath their feet. Recovering himself in a measure, as he stumbled on with nothing but his impetus to guide him, it appeared to him that there was something strangely blue in the grass before him; and he brought himself up just as he would have stepped upon it. As he stooped to touch it, his dazzled eyes cleared themselves; and he saw the insensible form and face of Agnes. He caught her up; but even her light weight, with the shock, was too much for him. He staggered under   A GNES VEA TWORTH.       113 it, and might have fallen. But the whole household had been driven to doors and windows by the thunder- clap; and Walter was with him before he had gone ten paces. Agnes was carried in and laid upon a sofa, to all appearance dead; and then the rain came down in torrents; and all, within and without, was dark. Bevond the usual remedies for a swoon, which Rosa- mond, all her fears for herself put to flight by her Craony of terror for her sister, was hastily trying, assisted zealously by all the other women, no one pres- ent knew what to do. Vernon felt her pulse, and let it go. "How is it?" said Rosamond, whose fingers shook too much to tell her. For only answer, he turned from her to Walter and said, "Lay your hand over her heart." But Walter was crying like a child, and gazing help- lessly in her rigid face; and Rosamond laid her hand there and in her turn said nothing better than, "Do something! Don't give her up.--It is not time,--It will never be time. Has nobody any pity?" "Where does your physician live?" said Vernon instantly, to one of the inhabitants of the farm-house. In a low, awe-struck voice some one gave the re- quired direction, but ended with, "But you couldn't get there now. No horse would face it. Only hear." 'The gale had become almost a hurricane.  The walls and windows of the house shook, and rattled with the severed twigs and branches and the torrents of rain that struck them; and the thunder, with its alternate growl and roar, was incessant. But pres- 10'  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7379-00000059"/> "4     A GNES WENTWORTH. ently, in a momentary lull, Rosamond was roused from the trance of despair in which she was clasping her now idle hands over Agnes, by the trampling of kick- ing, racing hoofs. She threw up the deluged window in hopes of calling in assistance, when she saw Vernon I gallop by, bare-headed, on a wild, terrified, half-broken I colt which, without saddle or bridle, he managed by the balter and the mane. The sight, and suggestion of coming aid, revived her. She plied her cares again with such skill as she had, though with as little sue- cess as before, till at length-how long it seemed!-  the hoofs again were heard, and Vernon drenched    from head to foot, with water dripping from his straightened locks, came into the room sadly atd  mutely, as we go into a chamber where one dead is lying. Rosamond, as mutely, caught his hand in both of   hers and looked into his face.           j "Dr.  is coming," said he.           j "' Coming!' Oh, my God, why is he not come?"' "The old man could not ride the horse that carried me," answered Vernon soothingly. "He says----" "Let me jist stthraighten her out coffin-shape a bit, dear," said an Irish voice behind them; " 'th be aisier done now nor aftther." "Let her alone!" cried Walter, starting up from his knees beside Agnes. "l How dare you?" "Was anybody hurt?" asked a softer voice, in the same breath with his. One exclamation of joy that was akin to horror broke out through the place, as everybody rushed for- ward to the sofa. Agnes had suddenly raised herself   AGNES WENTWORTH.        115 upon her elbow, and was gazing about her with an expression of wonder and perplexity working its way, through the stupefaction, in her face. '"You ought to know best. Oh, Agny, Agny!" answered Walter laughing and crying together, and throwing his arms around her as she sank back again. "Don't agitate her. Give her air!" exclaimed Rosa-, 1iond." "Hush; stand back!" said Vernon, taking Walter off. Agnes's eyes were once more closed ; though the ap- palling look of soullessness did not return to her face. Her head was not yet clear; and the faces and fur- niture swam round about her. The room was quieted; and Rosamond bathed her forehead with Cologne- water. Presently she tried to rouse herself anew and repeated, more eagerly, "Is everybody safe?" "t Quite safe, dearest," answered Rosamond. "Everything?-the--the paints?" persisted Agnes in a few minutes more. "They are consecrated now- the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost. They must be kept holy. Oh, are they safe?" Rosamond and Walter looked at each other, too much alarmed by the delirious sound which the speech had to their ears to think how to answer it. But Vernon perhaps, in some respects, understood his pupil better. He replied reassuringly in a gentle, commonplace way, "Quite safe; see," and -held before her not only the box, but the other implements, which one of the servants had picked up at her side on the turf when she was carried in.

HTe was caught in the rain after all," cried she. "Dear Walter, oh do take care of him-now!  Oh, how ill he will be!"                  "Oh yes, yes! do go and take care of yourself, Mr.  Vernon. How could we forget you so lonlg?,' ex- claiwed Rosamond, turning up toward him a 'counte-  nance beaming with gratitude and relief. "How could you not?" answered he, answering her  look, also, with one full of sympathy and tenderness.  "Come with me, you walking water-spout," cried  Walter, restored to cheerfulness, subordination, and  efficiency. "Make your way to the kitchen-fire, while I see about borrowing you a suit of clothes.      "Do-do go," said Agnes, lifting her heavy lids again, and seeing himn still there gazing down upon her,--no, on Rosamond, who was supporting her in    her arms.  "I will-I will go; but tell me first-indeed, Miss Wentworth, I am persuaded there is no further cause for anxiety. You feel no pain, Miss Agnes, -no ill- ness now?" She knitted her brows slightly; she was making an effort to consider and answer: "I do not feel-at all- but death going and life coming back--only-is not my hand--my right hand-a little scorched?"  She tried to raise it; but all her frame felt heavy and help- less. It was too great an effort for her even to keep her eves unclosed, though only when they were so could she control her thoughlts or her speech. Rosamond examined the pale, cold hand; there was a small, jagged, reddened brand rising on it even, now.   AGNES WENTWORTH.        117 "The sign of the cross," murmured Agnes. "What- ever the lightning strikes is sacred.--The scar of my mortal wound. I am raised from the dead. Those who rise from the dead must needs live for evermore the lives of the angels of God." The young men had, in the mean time, left the room; and Rosamond was thankful when the physi- cian made his appearance, and still more when he gave his opinion: The effect of the shock was plainly passing off.-Ob- jection to taking her home? None at all. The shower was entirely over. Give her a cup of hot coffee; and put her into a carry-all. Then get her a coach at the other end of the railroad. The mental wandering would probably pass off in a few hours, with the par- tial paralysis of the muscles of the eyelid. If not, see a Boston doctor. Meanwhile, keep her still, and take care of her on general principles. "Poor Rosy," said Agnes, "bhow pale you are! You and Mr. Vernon are the ones to be pitied and tended instead of me, if justice were done.- I never can for- give myself for making you all so much trouble with my silly trick." But she did forgive herself presently. The young men came back to the parlor,-Vernon more picturesque than ever in his borrowed blue-home- spun frock,-just as the coffee was making  Agnes quite herself again; and there was a general inquiry about clocks, cars, and "carry-all." They had missed the train they at first meant to have taken. "I am so sorry, said Agnes, "on account of papa! "But I am so glad," exclaimed Rosamond, " on ac- count of my diamond ring!

"I will go back and look," said Walter. "I know exactly where you went." "And I too," said Vernon; "I dare say we shall find it ;" but be said so rather coolly, and did not show quite the alacrity with which he started for the doctor. For Rosamond's self there was nothing which he would not gladly do; but he had rather a spite against her diamonds, and a jealousy of her attachment to them. "No, pray don't, Mr. Vernon," replied she with sincere good nature. "The ground will be very damp; and you have met only too much exposure on our account already." "t No, don't, Ernest," said Walter. "If I can't find it to-night, I'll come out again to-morrow. In the mean time, see if your own clothes are dry; and get them on agrain as soon as they are, so as to be ready to start with us for home when I come back." This being manifestly, to all, the best thing that he could do, Vernon did it, and had done it when Walter came back, with the ring, but with a more serious face than he was often seen to wear. "My dear fellow," said he, you have had two escapes this afternoon; and the one that we did not know of was the greatest." "How so?" "The tree you sketched under is cleft down the front,-probably by the same stroke that overtook you and Agnes; for I remember a crackling sound then that I could not account for before ;--and then the lightning seems to have glanced off; for the log you   AGNES WENTWORTH.       119 sat upon is split in two, and the very turf under it cloven. You moved none too soon." Agnes shuddered. Vernon turned toward her, and pressed her hand with earnest- kindness. "'So I have to thank you for saving me twice in one day," said he, in a low, sweet tone that met only her ear, "from death, and from an action such as dead men are sorry to have to look back upon, perhaps." They reached home, happily, without any further ad- venture; and as it was Mr. Wentworth who, happen- ing to be detained still later than they, kept dinner waiting instead of them, and as Agnes by making a little exertion managed to sit up in her place at the table as usual, the incident of the day would seem to have made little impression on him, but that he gave her two kisses for her one when she went to bed that night.  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7379-00000062"/> 120     A GNES WENT WOR TI. CHAPTER    XVI. MEANWHLE the young people all spent together a most cheerful evening, and all the more so for what children call " a pleasant surprise." Rosamond's por- trait awaited them in the library; no one remembered to tell them so but, when they went into the library, there it was; and oh, how beautiful it was! Vernon's portraits have not been generally very cele- brated. To tell the truth, I am afraid he was not far wrong in saying that they did not deserve to be so. In general, lie painted them against his will and judg- ment and, accordingly, with self-conflict and self-dis- trust enough to paralyze his powers. This particular specimen notwithstanding is, and is pronounced to be by some who know better than I, beautiful enough for a Titian and faithful enough for a mirror in the Palace of Truth. Single-portrait Vernon I He should have burned all his other portraits, and shown only this. Of all things in life,--after her kin,-perhaps Rosa- mond most loved her beauty.  Could she, Vernon asked himself, but learn to love him who had made it immortal? He would ask her some time, but not now. This evening was almost perfect as it was. To make it more so, he probably thought, might be less easy than to nlar it. But he had better, perhaps, have asked her then. Instead, he only took her picture up to his studio,-to scratch off a fly-spot on one corner,- and looked at it till morning.   A GNES WENT WOR TI.      121 That morning, Rosamond received a letter from Mrs. Egmont Van Rooselandt. The next evening, Walter knocked at Agnes's cham- ber door. "Who is it?" cried she and, hearing his voice, bade him come in. Contrary to her custom, she was lying down. Her simple life,-hours, dress, and food,-had kept her constitution sound to the core; but it had been too monotonous and inactive a life hitherto to give her much vigor; and she was growing fast. Accord- ingly she felt herself still shaken by the shock, follow- ing hard upon the unusual fatigue, of the day before. "How pleasant and kind it is in you to come up here and indulge me in my indolence! I have been trying to break through it and come down to see what you are all about. What is going on there?' "A good deal, I am inclined to suspect." "What?--O Walter, do you mean," cried Agnes starting up on one arm,--"Rosamond and Mr. Ver- on?" "Just that. Papa is out; and they have the library all to themselves. Vernon talked to me this afternoon: she never would give him a chance, he said, to speak to her." "And you?-- " "Had to tell her I thought the least she could do was, to hear what he had to say for himself, and put him out of his pain." "'Put him out of his pain' I But oh, Walter, there is only one way for her to do that. Will not she do it?" "  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7379-00000063"/> 122     A GNES WENTWORTH. "I can't tell. He's a pretty resolute person; but then she's another." "And not ready to say yes?-Oh, what a pity! How dreadful it would be I - Then, dear Watty, wouldn't it have been safer and better for him to wait and hope?" "For some people in his place, I dare say. For Vernon?---no, I don't think so. No, he is one of your neck-or-nothing fellows. If he saw a bull in his path, he never would show it his back. He would face it, take it by the horns, and be gored or vault over it and leave it behind him. If a battery opened upon him, he would bear down on it full gallop and silence the guns, or be shot. That's his way. At any rate, he says he can't go abroad again in such suspense. He can't be building all his life on what may be a crumbling foun- dation.'" "But if she should say no, and persevere in it? What then?" "For him?--Eternal woe, for perhaps a year, and then a smitation with some pretty Italian. It is a purely feminine view of the matter that you are in- clined to take, my dear little miss. There are as many chances in men's lives as there are twelvemonths, at least so long as they are bachelors. I should be very sorry though, for Rosy's sake. Not even she will have many chances of such a husband." "Nor we, of such a brother," Agnes laid herself back against her pillows, and was still. Walter left her, thinking her disposed to sleep. Therein he did not show his wonted penetration; but for once she did wish him away, that she might pray   A GNES WENTWORTH.        123 for the success of Vernon's suit,-a success which seemed to her to involve in it the very perfection of possible happiness for Rosamond,-for them all. And pray for it she did, with all her heart and mind and soul,--unconditionally, or with no qualification but for form's sake,-as we do pray for specific temporal boons in our youth; but as afterwards-if -we learn the les- sons of our life aright and see how much more blessed often, than such prayers granted, are such prayers denied,-we dare demand nothing beneath the stars,- nothing but God's grace to enable us to enjoy, or to employ, aright the boons of His own choosing. CGHAPTER XVII. IN the mean time let us put on our invisible rings on our Tarn-kappen, and hear the conclusion of the whole matter in the library. While Agnes was pray- ing, Rosamond was saying, "I am doing what I hon- estly believe to be the best for your own welfare, Mr. Vernon." "May I not be permitted to judge of that for my- self?" rejoined Vernon with a haughtiness such as he was never known, before or afterward, to show towards any woman. "Most certainly, provided an equal liberty is con- ceded to me." "But one word more. Is it anything in my circum- stances that closes the door against me?" "That is a very hard question. Are not we, all of  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7379-00000064"/> 124     A GNES WENTWORTH.  us, the creatures of circumstances? If our circum- stances were different, so would our conduct be,-our characters,-we ourselves.," "I am answered.  But can you,you, the very image of generous and noble womanhood,--can you be tosched with selfishness and worldliness? Beautiful  slave, will you sell yourself for gold?"      M "That I never said," cried Rosamond coloring high,  "and forgive me if I do say, Mr. Vernon, that not  i even our long friendship gives you any right to ask."  Vernon had gone too far,-a great deal too far.    The consciousness of it struck him dumb, and gave   Rosamond the advantage. As to his accusations, they were partly just and partly unjust. For their injustice and their justice she resented them equally. Recollecting herself how- ever, she was not slow to seize the advantage he had given: "If any apology is due, I do not think I am the one from whom it is due." He bowed, and looked the acquiescence he could not speak. She went on: "Therefore I wish to be clearly understood as offering none. But if an old friend de- sires an explanation, an explanation I will give, even if it may be--must be--a painful one to us both. I have done you no wrong, Mr. Vernon; it is not I who seek to debar you from life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  I have even been--in general-careful to do you no wrong.  From the time I first saw cause to suspect what way your wishes tended, and how un- likely it was that it would ever be in my power to fulfil them, I have been studiously on my guard lest I   AGAVvES WENTWORTH.      125 might unconsciously do anything to foster them. So far as our occasional relations as hostess and guest allowed, I have denied myself the pleasure which any person of any intellect and taste must find in the society of a man like you. You must do me the jus- tice to own that, from my early girlhood to the present day, I never trifled with you." "I do."  "Then you say that I am worldly; but-- " "I had no right. I wish the tongue had been pal- sied that said it 1" "But I do not wish anything by any means so harsh," returned Rosamond, more and- more mollified and faster and faster recovering her usual tone, "for I say so too. I am worldly. I know it. But then I think the only difference on that point between me and my neighbors is, that they are worldly and do not know it. They seek their own earthly happiness; and so do I. They seek It in their own way; and so do I. Some seek it in the flattery of their partners at a ball; some, in that of their partners at the altar; and some, in that of far-off posterity; and, for my part, I do not see why they have not all an equal right to choose. Then, to come back to our particular selves, your aspirations happen to turn in the direction of one of the beaux-arts, and mine in that of the beau-monde; but now tell me, candid Mr. Vernon,-if you chal- lenge me to meet you on high spiritual ground,-are they not alike, like all the rest, of the earth earthy?" "Heaven forbid!" stammered he. "You cannot really think so. You must see how the fine arts spiritualize-how they ennoble-human life'." "*  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7379-00000065"/> 126     A aNEAS IvENTWrYORTII. "Yes, I think I do see how they spiritualize and ennoble it; and that is a very little oftener, if at all, than they enervate and corrupt it. Incidentally they embellish life, no doubt; and so, in my judgment, do the arts of conversation, -of dress,--in a word of fashionable society. But I know for one, that if I were to profess to pursue them for any other object than my own pleasure, I should be a hypocrite or a self-deceiver; and I am neither. Then as to the other count, selfishness, I am compelled to say what I would rather not, that if it were selfish in me to refuse to sac- rifice my happiness to that of any one else, I cannot perceive why it would be any more disinterested in binm to desire me to do so." "I have given you a right to misunderstand me," said Vernon strurggling with himself. "If I had only not so miserably forgotten myselfl If I might still without presumption say-Oh, Miss Wentworth, be generous,-trust me! Be my idol, my muse, my divinity,-and let me--let me try to make you happy." "It could not be, Mr. Vernon; I could not trust my- self. I could not be happy without the means, any more than you could in the pursuit of them. Besides -you may think my principles very sordid; and you may be right--but if there are any that I have and hold fast by, honesty is one. I could not be happy in debt nor keep out of it, I fear, without a pretty deep mine to draw upon; and so,-I'm very sorry,--but good-night." Vernon made no further attempt to detain her. He had had enough.  He was disgusted with her and with himself.   A GNES WENTWORTH.       127 CHAPTER    XVIII. ROSAMOND was, for the time, not much better off.' She hastened to her chamber, locked the door, threw up the window, thrust her fingers through her thick ringlets and, pressing her palms upon her temples, sat looking out upon the graves and thinking and feeling more earnestly' than she often felt or thought. At first, indeed, a sense of a great peril finally es- caped divided her attention with emotions of a painful kind. But the latter gained upon her more and more. Calm and Epicurean and anything rather than enthu- siastic or impressible as her nature and character were, she was amiable and affectionate,--in the habit, and fond, of giving pleasure. She had now giyen great and, by her, irremediable pain, and given it to an old friend of herself and to a dear friend of her brother and sister. Poor little Agnesl--how glad she would have been, and how sorry she would be 1 Then Rosamond, though as she most truly said neither a hypocrite nor a self-deceiver, loved to be on good terms with herself and to have others on good terms with her. She, as well as Vernon, was shocked at the recollection of the turn their conversation had taken, and of things which she had been betrayed by the heat of self-defence into saying. Her taste was too ladylike not to revolt at some of her principles, when they were once surprised out of her into open pro- fession. Rosamond's distinguishing mental charac-  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7379-00000066"/> 128      AGNES WENTWORTH. teristics were clearness and truth. Thoulgh it may seem a paradox to say so, these mental merits were in part preserved to her by one of her worst moral demerits. She cared to reach no high standard; ac- cordingly she was never tempted to blind her own eyes, or those of others, to the fact that she did reach no high standard. When she looked into her own character, therefore,--which was to be sure very seldom,- she saw into it, as she did into almost everything else that Miss Rosy saw fit to scrutinize, with most unhoodwinked distinctness from corner to corner. Was it true then, she now asked herself that, as she had said, she could be kept out of debt and dishonesty only by the possession of large means? If so, then where were those means to come from?  Her Aunt Van Rooselandt had no private fortune, and had a disease of the heart. Mr. Van Rooselandt was her uncle by marriage only; and continued dependence upon him after " anything happened" to his wife was likely to be, if not impossible, neither agreeable nor creditable. Mr. Wentwoztr had a large income from his profession; but it Went almost as fast as it came, especially as he had had--till now, when Agnes was just beginning to gather the reins into h'er inexperi- enced hands,--nobody to regulate for hilm the expenses of his household. Except at the bar, he was a man much more theoretical than practical; and Rosamond had often heard him provide for his family, to his own complete satisfaction, by saying that his daughters would marry as other girls did, and his son would have to shift for himself as he did before him, and so much   A GNES WENTWORTH.       129 the better; parts would never make a lawyer out of such an idler, unless poverty came to their aid. Was it true then, as Vernon had asked her, that she would sell herself for gold? She had evaded the charge with him; it had a most ugly sound; but could she refute it with herself? How else could a woman, bred as she had been, come by gold?-Yet how could a woman, bred as she had been, do without gold? As she gazed down upon the tombstones she, for a mo- ment, almost envied those whose bodies slept beneath them; but it was for a moment only, for their souls had gone to the judgment, - in which Rosamond be- lieved and at which she trembled. There seemed no refuge for her even there; and, for another bitterer instant, Rosamond Wentworth was ready to wish that she had never been born. Such a mood was, however, too foreign to her habits and temperament to be durable or endurable. She turned from it immediately to hug herself upon her deliverance from a possible master so imperious and passionate as Vernon had proved himself likely to be- come. "What a Pandemonium of passion and poverty the lives of such artists must be!" said she to herself with a shudder; "I declare it seems to me as if I had been looking down into it through a trap-door,: and watching and listening to the graceful motions and melodious voice of one of the demons with a beau- tiful face, and all at once he had thrust up a long black claw and almost caught me.

What a handsome proposal! What wonder you were shocked at my folly and sin in not closing with it on the instant I .For your own sake, I wish most heartily that you were richer ; but I wish it less for my own; for I begin to perceive that our natures would agree like fire and ice." But now came the memory of the love to her, which his very violence had shown,--such love as she had never witnessed in any of her admirers before, nor might again,-that love whose force had borne so large a part in breaking through the bounds of his usual polished gentleness toward gentlewomen. And next came the fear that he had thought she scorned him for his poverty,-a scorn which Rosamond's spirit would have loathed if she had been the heiress of Golconda. In short she was promptly forced to make up her mind, for peace's sake, to forget the whole matter and get back into her everyday life again as fast as she could. In the first place she must see after Agnes, which she ought to have done before; for Agnes had with- drawn herself from the family circle from the very be- ginning of the evening,-a most unusual occurrence. But sle was not quite ready yet to face Agnes herself, and therefore rang for Mrs. Tibbets. Agnes however heard the bell, and therefore thought she might venture to go to Rosamond's door; as she   AGNES WENTWORTH.        131 had been longing to do for an hour, ever since she heard it open and shut. She threw herself into Rosa- moud's arms exclaiming, "Dearest, dearest Rosy, are you going--soon-to tell me some most precious news?" Rosamond shook her head. Agnes burst into tears; when Rosamond at last fairly broke down and contributed a few of her own to the shower,-honimeopathic treatment of it which proba- bly checked it as speedily as any that she could have adopted. Agnes presently began to wipe her sister's eyes and her own, and to coo out in a dove-like man- ner such consolations as occurred to her as applicable to the supposed state of the case. These resolved themselves chiefly into, "Of course, darling, you could not have anybody you did not love; and if poor Mr. Vernon was destined to be- refused he could not be, by any one else, so gently and soothingly as by you." Rosamond fondled her tenderly in return for her con- dolences, but otherwise neither accepted nor rejected them. Perhaps if they did not comfort her much they amused her a little; for she was, in some respects, a genuine varium et mutabile, and into her odd compo- sition a perilous sense of the ludicrous largely entered. At any rate she could not, in the present position of affairs, make a clean shrift as to her own shortcomings without revealing Vernon's.  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7379-00000068"/> 132     AGNES WEJNTWORTH. CHAPTER    XIX. VERNON in the mean time had locked himself into. and Walter out of, his chamber, and was packing up his goods and chattels with a kind of fury. Soon after midnight he made a transit to his studio, there to con- tinue the same gloomy business. But as his foot pressed the threshold the beautiful eyes of Rosamond met his own across it, looking in all and more than all her glory and glee out of her pic- ture,--that picture that was to make them both and together immortal,-that picture that had been an infi- nite pride and joy to him yesterday,-that was a mad- dening mockery to him now,--that was to be to him but a memory and a blank for evermore. Let no man say he knows the bitterest page of human life, till he has read the history of men's successes. To that pic- ture he had no right or title any more. It must go,- out of his sight, out of his heart, out of his life. He made two strides and stood before it. His knife was in his clutch. He would have stabbed it like a living thing; but something held his arm. He would have stabbed it, not as Rosanmond Wentworth,--she would have been safe from him even then,-but be- cause he would not have his own work taunt and defy him so. He hurried from it and up and down the room. Again and again he stopped before it to rend and tear it from one end to the other, up and down, but did not; for something stopped him still. The   AGNES WENTWORTH.        133 night was waning; and so was his strength. Some- thing must be done. Again he faced the picture; but this time he threw his knife behind him as he came, and only turned it gently to the wall. Now he could work; and his work was soon done. The place was dismantled;--the paintings were un- hung, and the various implements hastily thrown together ready for removal. Then he stole back to his chamber, sat down, and wrote a graceful, if not cordial, note to Mr. Wentworth -in acknowledgment of his hospitality, and requested his acceptance of the portrait. Then, when he regarded it as no more his own, he trusted himself with it again for one last look. The act of renunciation and self-mastery had in a measure calmed him, but only in small measure. He wrung his hands before his handiwork till the blood started from the nails. The tears that he shed before it were tears of gall. His passion was rising again. He dared not stavy. There was no more need of his turn- ing the portrait to the wall now,--for he had no fur- ther business in the room ;-but he did so; and one of the little gold bosses of the frame is broken off, and lodged in the plaster of the partition to this day. Then, utterly worn out in mind and body, he threw himself upon his bed without, undressing and slept a dreary sleep with a drearier waking. Rosamond went out as soon as breakfast was over. Therefore -she was not present when, immediately after, Vernon announced that circumstances obliged him to set out at once for the South. "I am concerned to hear it," said Mr. Wentworth; 12  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7379-00000069"/> 134     AGNES WENTWORTH "but if we consult your pleasure rather than our own now, and speed the parting guest, I trust you will reward us by affording us an opportunity to welcome the coming guest, whenever you revisit New England." The old Chesterfield shook hands, and bowed himself out. "I wish you need not go, Ernest," said Walter, sor- rowfully but not without a certain constraint. "Why, the fever can't be over yet, can it?" "Thank you ; I don't know. It makes no difference. I must get out of the country-back to Italy, I mean. I must see my mother before I go. Heaven knows when I shall see her again." "But, my dear fellow, you won't really go straight to South Carolina at this time of year I It is mad- ness. " "It was madness to stay. H-I beg pardon;-I be- lieve I may visit Single on my way;-I had a letter from him last week;-and perhaps we may go to Niagara afterwards. Anything to kill time-that is, of course, till I can get really to work again. Say every- thing that is proper for me to the young ladies, if you please. I shall write to you, Wentworth. I will not try to thank you till this headache, that you see I have to-day, leaves me myself again." ("But, Ernest-but, dear old fellow!" cried Walter, hurrying after him to the door and laying a coaxing, detaining hand upon his shoulder, "you are not going this minute,--to leave me in this way. Let me send John for your ticket and coach and so forth; and come back and lie on the sofa for an hour, in the library. You shall have it quite to yourself, if you don't want   AGNES WENTWORTH.        135 me. Rosamond is out; but won't you say good-bye to Agnes-before you go?" "It would have been a strange omission to go with- out that," said Vernon to himself as he relented and returned; and Walter went for Agnes and brought her. She came, pale and silent for pity and sorrow. Vernon too had little to say and, perhaps to excuse himself from saying more, offered and wrote her a letter of introduction to another painting-master. "You will go on, I trust, and see that my one pupil does me credit," resumed he listlessly, as he gave it to her, trying in vain to manifest an interest which he did not feel. Agnes was chilled and disheartened, both by his sudden departure and by the manner of it. "If I can," answered she; "but I am afraid that when I am a woman my duties may prevent me."  "Duties to the pride of life,-morning-calls, dresses, and entertainments??" replied he cynically. "If I recollect right, it was not the sister who was careful and cumbered about much serving who received the commendation of the holiest lips. But I forget; I am instructed now that art is vanity like all the rest; and so the old Worm has eaten out the core of the world. " Agnes looked wistfully and compassionately at him, and answered his misery rather than his words: "Oh, Mr. Vernon, art is not vanity when it is consecrated art; and there are so many who can be happy, for one who can be great I You have within your reach the best that life has to offer." "God only knows why a life was given, so full of  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7379-00000070"/> 136     AGNES WENTWORTH. fruitless struggle and of hopeless pain." Walter had left him to make the arrangements for his journey; and he spoke out his thought to her, as one whose proud fortitude seals his lips toward his equals will some- times open them to a baby or a dog. "It will not be 'fruitless' struggle," returned Agnes with guileless confidence. "You believe in me still, do you, and in-many things?" said he, fixing his dry, hollow eyes in his turn compassionately on her young, earnest face. "Poor child!-why should I talk in this way to you? Well, believe in life while you can, and enjoy it if you can; and, if you can, keep yourself simple and gen- erous and kind. You have been very kind to me, 'little sister,' as Walter calls you. I hoped you would have been my little sister once, perhaps you know." "I hoped so too." "In that case I think we could have loved one another. But all that is at an end. In my youth I dreamed a bad dream; and it has come true to my manhood. I shall never see Boston again. I hope I shall hear of you, if you ever come to Italy." He hoped it a little, out of regard for her, but very little, if at all, with regard to himself. He would have wished never again to hear the name of Went- worth. It was made all the more painful to him by the very thought of his ingratitude toward a family to whom, after all, he owed so much kindness. He shrank even from the idea of meeting any Americans after his return to Europe. He had longed with all the longings of a lover and a patriot to see his native country again; and she had had for him,--so at least   AGNES WENTWORTH.        137 he said to himself,-no honor-no encouragement-no acknowledgment for the credit he had toiled to do her,-- nothing but mortification, defeat, and despair. Even his lady-love had cheerfully sacrificed him to the dollar- worship of the land. Even as regarded his art, the clear, cold words of Rosamond had for the time-as he feared, for life- completely "demoralized him." Kind-hearted and light-hearted as she was, she seemed strangely fated to darken all his days. He was no longer sustained against injustice and hardship by the sense of desert and of a lofty career. She had slain his faith in him- self; and it threatened to be death to him both as an artist and as a man. Heaven help him, for the effects of such seasons do not pass away with their anguish t They are likely to stamp an abiding impression on the soul and the life. CHAPTER XX. WHEN the door was fairly shut upon Vernon, and on Walter who went to see him off, Agnes took refuge in her own room and cried bitterly. "I never saw anybody so wretched in all my life," thought she; "and I can do nothing to comfort him. Oh, God com- fort him God seemed to answer my prayers for him before, when he was so ill." Many mornings and evenings she prayed for him, until she was consoled 12*  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7379-00000071"/> 138     AGNES WENTWORTH. on his account with a conviction that he was in hands that would do for him the best that could be done. But meantime she was not without some youthful woes on her own account. After the society, gaiety, and new freedom that the summer had brought her, the prospect of a return to the old thraldom, monotony, and solitude of the winter seemed to her little less than appalling. She was silent on the subject, and submissive as usual; but Rosamond saw that some- thing was amiss, followed her to her chamber one day, and surprised her sitting on the floor with a wet face buried in her hands in the cushion of a chair. Agues was promptly taken up and set on Rosamlond's knee, and soon had her secret squeezed out of her. "When things are as bad as bad can be, you will always find, little dear, that is a sure sign they are going to be better," said Rosamond trotting her. "You would like to leave school at any rate, I sup- pose?" "Rosy, shouldn't I?" "Very well; I will speak to papa. And now what else should you like?" "Why, to draw and paint, if papa would only please to let me take lessons of M. Dumont. It would not be so expensive as school; and I should be learning something instead of nothing."' Rosamond spoke to papa and effected a compromise. Agnes might leave school and take painting-lessons, if she took lessons in modern languages likewise, first one and then another until she could speak as well as read three, if she would prepare herself to construe twenty   AGNES WENTWORTH.        139 lines of Latin to him or to Walter every evening, and if she would read twenty pages of history daily to her- self, looking for all the places mentioned, on the maps. If the conditions were hard, the prize was glorious. Rosamond was half stifled with caresses; and Agnes was happier than any autumn had ever seen her before, -with a happiness that not even her sister's return to New York could destroy. Vernon had done her a par- ticularly good turn in introducing to her, M. Dumont. Dumont, though an admirable copyist, was other- wise scarcely to be called an artist. Notwithstanding, -and partly for that very reason perhaps,--he was the very prince of teachers. He had a thorough knowledge of the mechanical processes of his art, and of anatomy and perspective; and he threw his whole strength into the progress of his pupils. While he had no imagina- tion to interfere with theirs,' his taste was exquisite, and was always at their service. He was at once the kindest and the keenest of' critics. He divined, as if by instinct, where each tyro's strength and weakness lay, and saw how to make the most of the one and how to evade or get the better of the other. His disin- terested and unambitious industry kept him the hap- piest of men; and the polished gaiety of his manners had a fascination which few could resist. Accordingly, he had cast a glamour over the dragons that kept many of the choicest galleries of Europe, and possessed, for the study of his scholars, a collection of fac-similes by his ;own hand, such as it needed a remarkably practised eye to distinguish from the originals of some of the greatest Italian and Dutch old masters. It was his hot republicanism that, after the coup  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7379-00000072"/> "O      A G N'ES WE NT WORTH. d'etat, drove him to the United States. Nevertheless, with an inconsistency not very uncommnon in republi- cans, he took especial comfort in the fact that his wife was a daughter of a younger branch of the old family of Montpensier. THe never thought it necessary to ex- plain that he had rescued hler, in an almost destitute condition, from a sonry pension in which she was half pupil, half under-teacher. He did think it necessary that now, at any rate, she should have all the silks and laces befitting her birth; and the picturesque old grande dame, as half in play and half in pride he loved best to call her, established in state in the pleas. antest window with her parrot, her poodle, and her nissal, was one of the most striking ornaments of his studio. What with the foreign language spoken there, the courtly master and mistress, and the pictures, Agnes's lessons seemed to her like a bi-weekly trip to Europe. They were the chief pleasures that she had, for a longer time than she expected. The following summer did not bring her back her sister. Mrs. Van Rooselandt was ordered to try a voy- age for her health; and Rosamond went with her to Baden-Baden. Walter took a long vacation in the Adirondacks. Even the Dumonts went somewhere out of town for July and August. Mr. Wentworth never passed a night out of his own house; and his youngest daughter as usual shared his fate. Then she took refuge in the cool lower gallery of the Athenaeum, and drew fronm the statues. In that noiseless, white, calm society, wherein if there is no life there is at least no change nor death nor fear   A GNES WENTWORTH.       141 of any, she would lose herself so utterly in sight and thought that, if any one came in and spoke, she started like a deaf and dumb person suddenly quickened to the sense of hearing. When she left her seat for a mo- ment's rest, she would steal to the window, let the soft, sunny) live air blow upon her face and, looking out upon the quiet, familiar graves of the Granary, compare the monuments of mortality before her with those monuments of immortality behind. She would ponder upon human life:--how transitory it was, i yet what eternal footprints it might--or might not- leave upon the world. She would wonder whether, in the sight of God and of His angels, the marks left by beneficent though uncelebrated lives upon the lives and souls of succeeding generations were not, after all, the noblest footprints that could be left upon the world, Then she would wonder whether it might not be pos- sible to combine the two,-the noblest spiritual with the noblest intellectual life,--and whether at any rate this could be possible to a modern, an American, and a woman. Such ponderings and musings often went home with her, and kept her watching with them late into the night. She would question with- herself what the talent was which God would one day demand of her with usury,-whether He would chide her as an un- profitable servant in that she did not consecrate her hands to such works as other women called only holy, -such works as Tabitha or Dorcas did. She would question next whether, if she should so devote them,-- a martyrdom to her it would have been,--He might: not on the contrary rebuke her in that, having been  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7379-00000073"/> "2     A GNES TIWENTWORTH. called, like Bezaleel the son of UTri and Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, to be filled with the spirit of God and understanding to devise curious works for the ser- vice of the sanctuary, she had turned fromn them to things that perish in the using. Thus when, during the day, she had prospered in her toil, it seemed to her a token of approbation from on high, and a word of command to go on in the path she had chosen. When on the contrary she had toiled in vain, it seemed to her excited fancy a sign of condemnation; and then, with a sense of more than temporal failure, her heart wept tears of blood. Her life was a strange, dreamy, lonely, unearthly one for a girl to lead. In front of her little bed hung a copy of Guido's head of the Saviour crowned with thorns. At this, with a feeling as if it were a religious service, her pa- tient hand and brain had wrought until they could find no more to do. Its "deep, pathetic eyes" looked into hers when they unclosed in the morning, as if appeal- ing to her to do something to make that divine face less sad,-something to soothe the sorrow of the long- suffering Christ for his followers still struggling after him on earth. Yet her father peremptorily forbade her having any- thing to do, in person, with the poor. She was sorry for this on his account, and sorry on her own, and per- plexed here again because, while she feared to disobey, she feared lest in obeying she was not obeying in the Lord. But here she found relief by the discovery,--as soon as she surmounted her diffidence enough to make it,--that every little drawing or painting that she ven-   A GNES WENTWORTH.       I 143 tured to offer was eagerly accepted and readily dis- posed of for charitable purposes. Thus, in a word, little Agnes was left to herself and to God. Her girlish mind was to be forced through much weakness, if at all, to struggle itself into strength. Her thoughts, unexpressed, accumulated and deep- ened. Her mind, hemmed in on every side, grew up- ward. Had she found without her at this period the sympathy and companionship she craved, she might possibly have developed (or undeveloped) into one- of those soft, negative, dependent characters that hang like parasites, weak and weakening, all their lives on others. As it was, she might perhaps find her way out into the fulness of the benediction, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." And so we leave her to make her way with little outward aid through the remainder of her early youth,-that enchanted time that we can all of us at least remember, when either joy or sorrow that fell to our lot seemed eternal,-when the years were so long, and there were to be so many of them.  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7379-00000074"/> "4     AGNES WENT WORTH. CHAPTER    XXI. AT last Agnes's eighteenth birthday came, and a great change with it. Rosamond returned home to spend a whole winter. She had always promised herself that she should bring up the arrears of her domestic duties, when that time should arrive, by bringing out Agnes. But, somewhat to Rosamond's dismay, Agnes was no sooner out than she wished to go in again: "Dear- est Rosy, do you really think I must keep on making calls and going to parties?-I am so wearily bored at them; and my cheeks ache so with having to smile at things that are not droll." "The remedy rests with you, my sweet. Say some- thing yourself, that is droll; and rest your cheeks and your neighbors' with one good hearty laugh." "Do you even require me to jest on the rack, you ruthless tormentor?" "Certainly; do what you can for the good of society." "Why, that would be to stay at home; for society, when I talk to it, usually looks as much bored as I feel. " "Because you have had no practice yet in min- istering to its necessities. Fashionable society is a great baby: it wants to be skilfully played with, danced, and chattered to, by somebody that is fond of it and used to it." "If one only could get up fondness enough for grown- up childishness! It is very good fun sometimes to   AGNES WENTWORTII.       145 help discuss baby-houses and dolls with little pro- prietors; but oh, Rosy, confess--are not you worn out sometimes with that endless vapid talk about grown- up houses, clothing, food, and furniture?" "I don't hear much of it. I don't yield the floor to it. Why should I, or you? When other people don't entertain me, I take a generous revenge by entertain- ing myself and them too." "But it is all such a disappointment! I always hoped-I rather expected-that when I went into com- pany I should meet the characters one hears of-artists and authors and statesmen and all sorts of the people that are really worth seeing, in this State at least; and I scarcely ever do-a single specimen. " "'No; I should think there were fewer of them on exhibition here than even in New York. When they try going out, one by one, they are bored I dare say as you are, Agnes, and they give it up as you wish to do; and you see what comes of that. The field is more and more abandoned to the mere dressers and dancers; and so there is a great Chinese wall built up between intellect and fashion ; and both are the losers. " "The fashionables are the losers, no doubt; but are the geniuses, do you think?"' "Indeed I do. The tendency of genius is, to look queer; the tendency of retired genius is, to look queerer. Besides, how can anybody paint or write ladies and gentlemen, who is unacquainted with ladies and gen- tlemen?" "Rosamond, I do not find you the most unpleasant of female lecturers. You have given me a better reason than I ever dreamed of before for my going out,-ex- 13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7379-00000075"/> "6     A GNES WENA WORTH. cept, indeed, that papa wished it. That is an idea that ought to help me through a good deal of penance, -if I really must do it." "Then will you reward ime by not looking all this evening as if you were saying, Society is a beast; and I wish it was dead?" "I will try." "Good girl. Then I will impart to you another reason for doing as you are bid, and one quite from your own point of view, little angel." "' Little'! - 'little' now, my domineering elder? Look in the glass." "' Tall rose the spirit's altering form, Till to the roof her stature grew,"' sang Rosamond and said, "You are the tallest now, aren't you? Never mind; the more there is of you the better. But do you remember what Wesley said about music?" "That it was not fair that Satan should have all the best tunes?" "Something like that. Well, in like manner I can- not see why Satan should have all the best-bred and best-looking people. Agnes, do you love that worthy woman whom Walter calls' that old Tab'?" "Miss McTab. I ought to like her." "Doubtless. Do you?" "Inquisitor, do you put me to the question?" "I will give the wheel another turn; which do you like best, her or Miss Arden?" "There is scarcely anybody else in this world- out of this house, there is nobody-that I like and love and admire so entirely as Clara Arden."   A GCES WENTWORTH.        147 "Then of course she is better than Miss McTab," said Rosamond solemnly. "I do not know,--I cannot say that." "Nor I either," said Rosamond, relapsing into her usual manner, "I suppose each of them is doing. her duty in her place, to the very utmost of her knowledge and power; but Miss McTab is blunt -and absent and stiff and awkward. She wears most reprehensible head-dresses, and puts them on in a manner which is a constant temptation to the mirth of the heathen;-I can answer for one, I'm sure, and so could Watty if he were here, for another. But sweet Clara!- No matter, we both of us know her; and nobody could describe her. Aunty's sister-in-law, Mrs. Gulian Van Rooselandt, of Fifth Avenue, is 'much such another golden saint. I leave you to judge for yourself, Agnes, whether one like them, or an image of a sister of the order of McTab, would be of the greatest efficacy in the position in life where heaven has placed you." "You have given me a great deal to think about; and I will think about it," said Agnes. Rosamond was answering some unspoken questions of conscience for her, and making her feel that she could try at all events to make herself agreeable, with a lighter heart. "If you were like many girls, darling, and I loved you as I do now, I assure you I'd rather lock you up than bring you out; but you can gain, and do, good and no harm by becoming more a woman of society." "But Rosamond, since we are having the matter out, perhaps I had better tell you one thing that does make it especially hard to me: hardly anybody seems glad to see me."  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7379-00000076"/> "8     AGNES WENTWORTI. "I know; I usually feel that myself when I first come northward; it's just as if one had done something one shouldn't, and everybody had just found it out. But then I rise superior. It needs some cordiality and vivacity on one's own part, at first, to break through the mattva-ise honte of New England; but that- is all. It is a matter of give and take." "If I were only like you,"- "You would be more popular than you will be?.- May-be so; but yet you might lose full as much as you gained. I am liked by a good nimany people, I be- lieve,-a little. You will be liked, when you are known, very much, I am sure, by a few; and they will be of the persons the very best worth pleasing. The best judges are wont to be in the minority. I do not suppose Bach was ever so popular as Strauss; but then I do not suppose Strauss ever threw any hearer into such heavenly rapture as Bach does. Common- place souls want show and sparkle; if they cannot have diamonds, they will have paste. I do not ask you to be showy or sparkling, my own still, pure, white pearl. But you will be none the worse for being drawn out of your shell, and well set in the sight of those who can appreciate you." "When she said she was liked 'only a little,' did she forget poor Mr. Vernon?" mused Agnes. "I hoped that, when I went into company, I should find some more acquaintances like him " They heard from him now only by report; and the last story was that his father had died and left him a little property, and that he was likely to marry some Italian countess.   AGNES WENTWORTH.        149 Moreover Agnes pondered silently over the othel things that her sister had said to her, and then as quietly acted upon them. There was much steadfast. ness in her nature but no stubbornness,-on the con trary a rare union of docility with steadfastness. Habit soon gave her ease in company. Besides, there is always something marvellously reassuring, in the sense of being perfectly well dressed; and Rosamond devised all her costumes, which were simply and mod- estly exquisite. As Rosainond had prophesied, those who could appreciate her, did find her out. In the eve of the fashionable crowd, she bore not a moment's comparison with her beautiful and brilliant elder; but to a few she was even more charming in her tender, moonlight, fair, ideal loveliness. A young genius is happy indeed, who has so helpful and considerate a guardian as Rosamond. "Art is your business; society is mine," she had the com- plaisance to say to her charge. She watched over the blossom-end of the artist's day, the precious morning, and received and returned for Agnes many- a visit which would have been a mere interruption lo her, while she lost no opportunity of putting the solitary in the way of agreeable friendships or entertaining ac- quaintances. To her surprise, Agnes soon found that all the pleasant companionship and variety in her life, at home and abroad, cost her little at the easel; especially as her sister, who meant to be handsome as long as she could, did not oppose her wish for,-comparatively speaking-early hours. Her mind seemed quickened rather than retarded by the change. She did nearly 13*            ,  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7379-00000077"/> 150     AGNES ]WENTWORTH. as much as before, and better, in less time; and a cer- tain crudity which up to this time had, in spite of her, weakened all her compositions, began to wear off far more rapidly, as her knowledge of real life, and maturer life increased. And again the summer was her own. CHAPTER XXII. THE next winter began in much the same way; but it ended with the spring of 1861. On the nineteenth of April, the national soldiers were fired upon in Bal- timore. On the evening of that day, Rosamond had to go alone to her party. Walter did not, as she expected, meet her there. He came home earlier and paler than usual, with his blue eyes flashing strangely, and an expression more earnest and manly than Agnes had ever seen before in his boy- ish face. He found her by herself "ranging," as he told her afterwards, "up and down the library, like a charger in a paddock within hearing of the drum." He put his arm round her waist, kissed her forehead, and joined her in her walk. After a turn or two, he said gently, "Agnes, I am going." She stopped him short, to stand before him and look him in the eyes and be sure that she understood. "Yes, I am going-lieutenant in the -th Massa- chusetts Volunteers-into camp to-morrow." She threw her arms round his neck and kissed him   AGNES WENT'WORTH.       151 on both cheeks. "You happy Walter! How glorious I Now, for the first time in my life, I know what it is to wish to be a man. But papa?" "He made no objection. He got me my commission. He hoped it would make a man of me," said Walter rather sadly. "If I had taken more pains to consider the poor dear old gentleman's likes and dislikes be- fore, it might be a little harder for him to let me talke my own way now; some comfort in that. Well, we shall have come and seen and conquered by midsum- mer; and meantime you'll be better to him than twenty boys; and you must' write to me every week, and tell me how he does in every letter." From this, they fell into talking of what Walter should, and should not, take with him into camp. Agnes accompanied him to his room to assist in his preparations; but there was little conversation between them; for the minds of both were preoccupied; and she feared to interrupt him. "I believe I have about all I want, now," said he at midnight as, after rummaging his writing-desk, he came and looked over the assorted piles of various small articles, which she had appropriately laid out, upon his bed, in the neat little pattern of a United States flag. "Papa is going to give me my uniform and sword and sash." "Would not you like some thread and needles?" "I should if there was any time for me to take sew- ing-lessons; you have neglected my education, Agny. No, my dear, not to-night. Don't do anything more. Go to bed, and rest yourself. It is not as if I was really leaving home yet, you know.

' He kissed Agnes again; and, as she went down to her chamber, she could hear him whistling Yankee Doodle, and singing, "'Father'n I went down to camp Along with Cap'n Good'n; There we see the men an' boys As thick as hasty-pud'n.'" The next morning he slept late, lest it might prove his last chance; and, when he did make his appearance, he was all the more hurried. He flew out of the house finally with no special leave-taking but a prom- ise to come back, if he had time, before he went to his quarters; and he had not time. After this, Agnes saw him often indeed, but very seldom alone. At the camp, she and Rosamond were usually attended to by other young officers; and Wal- ter was usually in attendance on other girls. When he came home,-merry, mercurial, and apparently ex- hilarated by change, by the hope of adventure, and by a present way of living nluch more congenial to his teml- perament than the dull routine of the office,-he was full of camp-jokes and stories, and still always hurried and going to do something or to see somebody. His usually amiable manners were perhaps a shade more affectionate toward all his family, especially at each parting; and there was a more cordial deference in the habitual respect he paid his father; but his real sepa- ration from them all appeared to have begun with the first night he spent away from under their roof.   A GN'ES WENTWORTH.       153 At last, on the very eve of his march, Agnes said to him, "Walter, it seems to me I have scarcely seen you since you joined the Volunteers." "Nor I you; and now that I do see you, I am afraid you are looking too pale. The fact is, I have always been looking forward to a 'good time coming,' that didn't come. We must look to another season for it now. I am going up for a last reconnoissance of my sky-parlor; will you come too?-I shall leave you 'residee legatoo,' as the old lady said, of everything but the naughty novels." She carried with her a little match-box which she had just given him for his cigars, and lighted his gas for him. To her eye, the room already began to wear a forlorn, stripped, forsaken aspect; not so to his, fresh from the bare barracks. "Pleasant, isn't it?" said he, pausing in the middle and looking lovingly all round. "A good many good times I've had here sooner or later.

Confound it!" said he, as the match burned itself out in vain, "I ought to have some sort of a book to take with me." "This?" asked Agnes, bringing him from the, table a pretty little new volume of Balzac, with his paper- knife between the leaves. "No--a-a-aTestament or something. I thought I might have a prayer-book here. My pocket-Bible got out of sight somehow when I moved in from Cambridge; and while I was in the land of Bibles it didn't so much signify. " Agnes ran down and brought him her own little French New Testament. "There are some of my marks in it," said she,-" only dates though, and little flowers and arabesques and angels in the margin, by the side of texts I was fond of. Do you object to those?"7 ;' I shall like it all the better; but do you like to give it to me?'" "Indeed I do." "Your name is in it?-yes. Now will you put in mine? Here is some ink; I suppose it may as well be thrown out to-morrow."' While Agnes was finishing the inscription to "Wal- ter Clifford Wentworth, Mass. Vol., 1861," she said   AGNES WENTWORTH.     .   155 in a low tone, with those infantine lips of hers that claimed the privilege of childhood for all they uttered, 1"Dearest Watty, you will read in it every day while you are gone, if you can, will you not?"' As she gave it up, their eyes met. He kissed it, and answered, "I will." "It is going where I wish I were going,-with you." He did not reply at once. He seemed to be absorbed in the care with-which he bestowed the little book in the breast of his blue uniform coat. Then he took both her cheeks in his hands; and, standing up with his new military uprightness; and looking earnestly and wistfully into her face, he said, "Whatever I may be going to, my dear, I think it may be a comfort to you to know and to remember one thing; and that is, that I went believing I ought to go, and that, for once, I left you all for my duty quite as much as my pleas- ure."1 Before she could answer, he was gone.  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7379-00000080"/> 156     A GNES "WENT WORTH. CHAPTER     XXIII. IN the autumn of that year, Ernest Vernon again, haggard and hurried and just from the sea, rang at Mr. Wentworth's door. Nurse opened it; and he asked if Mr. Walter was at home. "Yes, sir, 1 guess so; ef you'll please walk in, I'll see." She ushered him to the library, looked in and, apparently finding it empty, repeated, "Walk in, sir; I'll see," and passed on toward the next story. Vernon entered, and had reached the middle of the strangely familiar and unfamiliar room before he be- came aware of the presence of a tall female figure,a perfect pyramid of black,-sitting with its back to him and its head bowed over something it was doing at a table in Agnes's alcove. As he paused, it roused itself a little, gave a deep X sigh, and said abstractedly, "Remember, John, Miss Wentworth is out; and if any one calls, I am engaged." "I beg your pardon," said Vernon, about to with- drawr; but the lady at the sound of his voice, started, turned, rose, and began to come swiftly towards him; and it seemed to him that he beheld the very ghost of Agnes Wentworth, wasted, mute, breathless, pale, and growing paler at every wavering step. "Her father must have died!" thought he. "I am afraid you are not well enough for visitors, and I must have startled you very disagreeably," said he, with more sympathy   AGNES WENATWORTH.       157 and concern in his manner than he dared put into his words; "Where is Walter?" At the word she sank helplessly down into the arm- chair that he was placing 'for her and leaning back, covered her face with her thin hands, only repeating in an inward, agonized tone, "'Where is Walter?'-Oh, merciful God, where is Walter?" As Vernon stood beside her, utterly shocked and confounded, and knowing neither whether to stay nor how to leave her, his eye turned involuntarily to fall upon the large outline drawing she had left. It repre- sented a battle-field, apparently abandoned after a sharp engagement, strewn with dismounted cannon and other weapons and bodies of men and horses. On the left, a file of fiends were dimly seen climbing up through the transparent earth to seize their prey. On the right, a wreath of angels wound their way down through the clouds to the rescue. In the midst, upon the torn and trampled turf lay the lovely, lifeless form and face of-could it be? yes-Walter Wentworth, fixed in the centre of an awful doubt I His counte- nance was upturned appealingly toward heaven; and his sword held fast to his breast. His rigid hands were clasped upon it in the attitude of prayer. "Where is he?" exclaimed Agnes again, casting up her hollow eyes to Vernon in an agony of scrutiny and entreaty. "Oh, Mr. Vernon, you should know; you were always together; you knew him better than I." "But I know nothing; I am but just on shore. Mer- ciful heaven, you do not mean- I He has gone to the war perhaps; and you are anxious about him; "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7379-00000081"/> 158     AGNAES WENT WORTH. that is all, is it not?" cried Vernon, in an agony of sus- pense in his turn. "'Anxious'?-yes!-Oh no, that is not all!-Oh, Mr. Vernon, 'Mr. Vernon!-Last week there was a hearse at our gate; and that was all of sweet, merry Walter that will ever come home any morel"Her tearless face worked miserably. Vernon was utterly overwhelmed; and the sight of his distress did more than any soothing could have done, to rouse her out of the morbid condition into which she had been falling. "I have been cruel," moaned she. "It was not a piece of news to be told suddenly to any one who loved him. See, I am cry- ing for you; and that is more than I could do for my- self. I have even thought sometimes, I was turning into a stone figure for his monument; but your tears are thawing and softening me. Do not let them do so. I would rather be fixed forever praying upon his tomb." "My dear," said Vernon, adapting his words to her state while a common woe was bridging over the long void between them, "he would not have you in this despair. Walter always loved you, and loved to have his friends happy. Do you not believe that he is happy now? See," he continued, pointing to the draw- ing, "the angels are nearer to him than the fiends; and in my heart I believe that, even in his most thought- less moments, they always were so." "Do you?-do you believe it?  You always were an honorable man. You would not say what you did not believe. But when Sunday came, I went to church.

But he had no word of hope for me,--only a warning for other-thoughtless-youths, from Walter's doomn." "Young men often are less thoughtless than they seem," said Vernon. "They do some things that seem, and are, unfit, under an inward protest which, if their hearts are in the main sound and true, gains more and more outward power over them as life goesi on." "'Life'l--oh yes," murmured Agnes to herself; "while there is life there is hope." "And when life is over," said Vernon,-in his long- ing to comfort her appealing to her faith from his own aching want of any,--" is not the soul in better hands than ours?" "' In better'?-yes.-In safer-for him?-I would die to know. But no, I must not die; 'The effectual, fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much ;':-may it not even avail the dead? We must live to be righteous and to pray for him." "But are you sure that he was-' thoughtless'-to the end?-My dear friend,-my dearest friend's sister, --you see and must feel that your sorrow is mine? Does it increase your suffering to talk of him with me?" "No indeed; but one of the bitterest things I have to tell is, that I have so little." She paused and seemed struggling to regain more of her self-command. "There was a deep reserve, I am inclined to think," said Vernon soothingly, to give her time, "under all  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7379-00000082"/> 160     A4 GNES tWENTWORTH. Walter's careless outer frankness. The weeds floated on the top, where anybody might see them; but there might be gems beneath that no one had more than a glimpse of." "I am afraid he had some presentiment of how it was to be, and would have talked with me, and could not because I was so stupidly unconscious.--It was strange; it was as if I were under some witchcraft. Death had never come home to us before. I did not connect the thought with him. Who could? He had been so full of life,-those last few weeks especially! It seems to me often now as if, when he wanted me to listen to his last words, I had turned away singing from  his death-bed. I was sorry to part with him; but I supposed till the last that he was glad to go. His look, that last night, comes back to me whenever I shut my eyes to try to sleep,--so sweet and sad and wistful,-as if he had forever things that he longs to say, and I, to hear; but now Death has come between us and made him as dumb as I was deaf.-He did tell me then, he went because he thought it his duty." "That, from Walter, was as much as a thousand pro- testations from a man more given to them. Is it too painful for you to tell me-what you have heard since?" "We have had a letter from his colonel since the telegram,-a  short, hurried letter;-he had others like it to write. He said Walter was--' honorable and brave'--'a favorite with all.' He was 'fighting gal- lantly.' ' He was left mortally wounded-on the field- in an advance.'--When they found him again the next day,--he was dead." She broke off again, and returned to and from the table at which she had been sitting.   AGNES WENTWOTR TH.       161 "They found this with him," added she, holding out to Vernon a little volume open at the fly-leaf. Beneath the names of herself and her brother, there was a deep, dark stain ; and still below, irregularly traced in pencil, another inscription: '.I've read -your book, darling. I wish I'd read it more. My love to my f---   Pray for me. "w. C. w." An evident attempt had been made, as if by an afterthought, to write another line; but it was hope- lessly illegible. Vernon returned the book in silence, and held out his hand to take leave. He could bear no more. It was to him as if the human race was divided between the dying and the dead. Agnes looked as if her days were numbered. He was not enough master of him- self to soothe her as he would thankfully have done; and he feared the effect upon her failing strength of such, and especially so unforeseen, an interview. She smiled faintly with a touching effort dt self- recollection: "Poor classmate, this has not been such a welcome as he would have given you, - as he would have had us give you. But you will come again?--You will be sure to come again?" "If I may.--If it does not hurt you." "It is rather as if you brought something of him back, still lingering about you." As Vernon tottered down the stairs, he heard through the silent house,-with such a start as if it had been Walter's voice,-the sound of a latch-key in the door. But it was Rosamond who came in. How little he "*  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7379-00000083"/> 162     AGNES WNFTWIORTI. dreamed, when they parted so few years before, that they should ever meet there again and meet with such friendliness. His longAnger against her had yielded now to grief for her brother and'pity for her, and to other emotions still, and none of them less gloomy. For as,-when men know that they are about to die, -with their hopes and longings, their animosities'die before them, so it was with him. He loved his coun- try so, that when he saw her, as he thought, upon the point of suicide, this world seemed for him too at an end. Poor Rosamond was indeed not looking well. Her brilliancy seemed quenched in her deep mourning; and her features wore an expression not merely of mel- ancholy but of care and chagrin. She greeted him with her usual self-possession, though with more than her usual gentleness. She was touched by the asso- ciations called up by him with Walter, but much pre- occupied with her own anxieties, - at the moment especially for her sister. "You have seen no one I am afraid, Mr. Vernon." "I saw Miss Agnes. How long has she been ill?" "Only since-about a week." "Is it possible?" "Yes, poor child You know what they were to each other. No food,-no sleep,-no tears,-no words, I may almost say;--no wonder she is littlb more than the ghost of herself. Her physician gives us every en- courageinent to think that the-affection is only a su- perficial one, and that her youth and constitution will soon carry her safe through. Did she talk with you?" "Yes ; but I was not'in the least aware of-of being   AGTNES WENTWORTti.       163 guilty of such an intrusion. I asked for-made the usual inquiry of your housekeeper at the door." "Poor old nurse,-she has taken a heavy cold; she is much too deaf just now to go to the door." "I earnestly hope that the mistake has done no harm." "No, believe me, it is quite as likely to have done my sister good, if it roused her. Anything would be better than that stony stillness. Do not regret it. Indeed-except for the shock it must have given you -I do not." She gave him her hand cordially and in- vited him to repeat his- visit, but did not to prolong it; and he was eager to go, though it was only to a dreary chamber in a hotel. The last earthly stay seemed to him now to have been struck from beneath him. His life, since his return to Italy, had been utterly unsatisfactory and often utterly wretched. With the self-confidence which Rosamond in private, far more than the critics in public, had killed, his energies appeared to be struck dead. Yet because he was after all one of those few artists who are born, not made, he could not, as he often wished to do, forsake his art. Thus he kept on, limping and halting, in the course where only the fleetest runners can hope to reach the goal before hasty Death proclaims his "Time's up!"He was regarded, and he knew it, as a painter whose early spring had hur- ried forward into an early blight, qnd as a man, who was growing, year by year, more and more unpracti- cal, impracticable, morbid, and cankered. When the war broke out he wished to die, and to die a death nobler than his life had been. But the rebellion  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7379-00000084"/> 164      AGNES WENTWORTH. had swept into it all his kindred. His mother especially wrote him hideous letters; and. he had been out of the Southern atmosphere too long to have his own heart fired with its fever, agonizingly though he pitied its ravings in her and in others. Other men went home before they took their final part, to say'last words and hear last God-speeds; and there was no home left open to him but the once gay and hospitable home of the Wentworths. To that home then, as to a last resort, he had betaken himself and found it desolate. CHAPTER XXIV. ROSAMOND hastened to Agnes. She found her stretched on the library-sofa with her face hidden. Kneeling at her side, and gently drawing her handker- chief away, she discovered that her icy rigidity was melting down in a warm, refreshing rain of natural tears. Rosamond drew her gently into her arms and wept with her. Agnes returned her caresses, but offered no account of what had passed; nor did her sister question her about it. Rosamond was satisfied with seeing that, in some way or other, it had at once aroused and soothed Agnes and restored her to something like herself. She took a little food when it was next brought her, with- out unwillingness, and then slept for some hours. Only when she waked, she said anxiously, "Mr. Ver-   A GNES WENT WORTH.       165 non has been here and promised to come again. When he does, I wish exceedingly to see him.' "-Certainly; I will give particular directions," said Rosamond. The fact was, that Agnes had told no one the dread- ful secret of her apprehensions with regard to that future, which had now become Walter's present, state until it was surprised out of her by his friend. The confession, with his reception of it, had in a measure relieved her; but she was now shocked at having made it, and eager to explain it away as far as she could; and even this solicitude was helping to restore the bal- ance of her mind, by recalling her attention a little to outward things. The next morning, as she lay again on the sofa, a bunch of hot-house flowers was brought her. They were fragrant, and delicate rather than brilliant in their hues, but had no culled white ghastliness to remind her of those laid upon her brother's coffin. Flowers had a peculiar effect upon the very peculiar temperament of Agnes. She loved them reverently as sacred gifts, fresh within a few hours from the last touches of the Maker. They seemed now to have been sent to her, in the time of her sorest need, to refresh her inmost soul. She raised herself, stretched out her burning hands for them, and buried her face in their cool per- fume with no thought beyond. "Who sent them, John?" asked the more practical Rosamond. "Mr. Vernon, Miss; he brought them." "Oh, did not you ask him to come in?" "I did, Miss; but he wouldn't come no higher than  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7379-00000085"/> 166     AGNVES WENTWORTH. the hall, not till he'd ascertain were the ladies at home." !"Ask him if he will please to walk up. Agnes dear, I'll go and send nurse to you now, shall I?-and come back myself by and by.-They will talk over old times with less constraint without me; and, as for me, I can- not bear to be so reminded of poor Walter," continued she to herself. "What a pity and mistake it was, he ever went to the war!" As Agnes rose to receive her guest, she exclaimed, "Mr. Vernon, I hardly thought an hour ago that any- thing would ever again give me any pleasure ; but these have done it." She held up the flowers: "How could you know that they would do me good?" "I supposed you were fond of them, because I recol- lected how often you used to bring them to me, when you were a child, and it was my turn to be ill upon that sofa." "Did I?-Those were very old times. It seems to me as if you were telling me stories of somebody else," said Agnes, with that sad feeling of broken and lost identity which is wont to be one of the attendant trials of every heavy trial. "It was very kind of you to re- meumber. " "In that way, at least, I have been kinder. than I have seemed." "But oh, I must not let any of your kindness make me forget what I most wished to see you for --Mr. Vernon, the other dayv-yesterday-you know, perhaps, I had not been well; and I was surprised into saying things that, in a calmer moment, I should not have said even to you-even to my sister. You will not-will   AGNES WENTWORTH.        167 you?-put any construction upon them-unfavorable to Walter's dear memory. Indeed, indeed I meant only that he was not-might not be--what is called by stricter people a religious man!" "My poor child, I took what you said, just as you meant it. I am sure that Walter was not the man ever to appear to his sister in a less favorable light than he did to his friend; and what a dear, constant, hearty friend he was! You blame yourself-you, who were always all devotion to him--because your inexperience and unconsciousness possibly prevented him from ex- plaining freely to you his feelings and his danger. What could he have thought of me for letting our. correspond- ence languish as it did, till it died at last of my own neglect?" "Nothing unkind ;-he thought nothing unkind, be sure. He spoke of you the-the last time he spoke to me.' "Did he? Did he?-What did he say, sweet fellow?" Agnes in substance repeated it. Vernon shook his head sadly: "I have lost in him then even more than I knew. How could I expect any Northern man to say that? He recognized the real diffi- culty in the case, laying hold of the heart even where the mind is true. That was genuine sympathy, such as does one's heart good. Single's is-false, and can only do harm." "Walter spoke of Mr. Single too. He hoped to see him in passing through New York; but he was at his villa." Vernon did not hear. His thoughts had reverted to Walter. "It is,a voice calling me from the grave,"  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7379-00000086"/> 168     A GNES WENTWOORTH. murmured he; "we may be comrades there again, though not in the tent." "God forbid!" cried Agnes with a shudder. "Because I am not fit to die?" said Vernon, starting and turning his bloodshot eyes upon her. "It may be so; but what if I were not fit to live?-My child, not for my salvation would I say one word to shake your faith; but faith has never been vouchsafed to me. Catho- lic Italy is no place to learn it in, for a man who thinks and who believes in virtue. There are some saints, however, in whose intercession I believe, so far as I be- lieve in anything; therefore, while I fight for you, pray for me, if you will, that in heaven's own time I may become a Christian soul. But, in the mean time, I know no other path to God so sure as that which Walter took,-to follow, held back by no private fears, that which a man believes to be his duty ;-heaven knows whether that is an easy path or not," added he in an undertone, "when it runs between his country and his mother." "It is not for me to reproach any one for want of faith," returned Agnes softly. "Even if I were a Phari- see before, the last week at least has taught me that a cord, which seems very strong while we only want it to guide us up a gentle slope, with loving hands near to support us if we flag, may strain and crack if the earth suddenly gives way beneath our feet and leaves us dependent on that one stay alone. I ought not to- I must not-make any brave man's duty harder to him; but oh, God preserve your sisters from ever feeling that which I have felt!" "There is no one to feel that for me," said he with a   AG2NES WENTWORTH.       169 sigh.-"I have been almost entirely away from home for fifteen years, you know," he added quickly. Agnes respected his reserve; and no further allusion was made to his home. To fill a pause which she could not fill otherwise, she rose and rang for water for her flowers. Then he joined her in working that spell which loving memories cast over departed spirits, to raise them for a little while in dim, dear vision from the dead. They recounted to each other many things which they, together or apart, had enjoyed in Walter's company, till they almost forgot their grieving for the present, to smile over the past. Finally Rosamond appeared; and the conversation became general. A few days after, Vernon brought them a letter to read, which gave Agnes more definite comfort than any- thing before had done. It was in answer to one which, without her knowledge, he had written to another old class-mabe in the -th Massachusetts re- giment, begging in general terms, for any further par- ticulars which could be obtained of the last days and hours of their friend. That fine, warm-hearted, manly letter of Captain S * * * 's is before me now, and does so much credit to the writer as well as to the subject, that I would gladly insert it entire if I could without violating the sanctity of private correspondence. It describes Walter as "a model soldier," throwing himself from the outset with thorough fidelity into all his duties, mastering his natu- ral and habitual love of ease and pleasure, laughing at hardships, murmuring at no delays or disappr,nt- ments, subordinate to his superiors, and remarkable for 15  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7379-00000087"/> 170     A GNES WENTWORTI. his power of gaining the affection while maintaining the discipline of his men. "He was the life of the mess, but always in such a way as if a ladymight have been at his elbow." In some respects, indeed, there was a staidness about him which rather surprised Captain S * * *; but, to be sure, he had been out of town and scarcely seen Wentworth between camp and college; and he had had time to alter. For instance, he had a habit of keeping himself to himself as much as he could of a Sunday, in the morning; in the afternoon, he usu- ally went to the hospital and read to, or wrote for, any one who needed it; and in the evening of that day he could seldom be induced to join in anything more frolic- some than a quiet chat. Further, Captain S * * * had lately fallen in with a wounded corporal of another regiment, apparently a very kindly, steady, trusty fellow. He had lain on the field near a commissioned officer, who, from various circumstances which he mentioned, was no doubt Wal- ter, from the time of his fall to that Of his death. He appeared worn out with previous fatigue,-as Walter must have been,-and slept a good deal. When he woke, he seemed to suffer little but from thirst; and as his companion was able to reach a brook, which ran hard by, he had water whenever he wanted it. He scarcely spoke; but he gave his handkerchief to the corporal, with a sign that he was to bind up his own bleeding arm with it, and managed to make him un- derstand that he should divide the contents of the stranger's brandy-flask with those of the wounded near them who appeared the faintest. The handkerchief had been taken from the man's arm, the first time it was   AGNES WENTWORT H.       1 dressed, and lost; but it was wrought in one corner, he remembered, with a figure something like this: X (Agnes recognized the skeleton of the monogram, which she herself had designed and embroidered for Walter.) He died about three o'clock, " 'just stopped breathing, without any sort of a struggle.'"This last the man was certain of; for the moon was full, clear, and high; and, as his arm hurt him very much just then, he was sitting up, watching and envying the sleeper. "His own sweet self to the last," said Vernon, as. Agnes folded up the letter. "What wonder that not even Death could deal otherwise than gently with him?" Agnes felt the covert comfort in the words; but she could not answer them. Completely overcome once more, she could only press his hand and leave the room to weep her fill over the precious pages. But henceforth, whatever her grief for her brother might be, it was no more despair.  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7379-00000088"/> 12     A GNES WENT WORTH. CHAPTER XXV. NATURE,-in Agnes essentially healthful nature,- reasserted its rights. She became more like herself day by day; but it was outwardly still, in many respects, a new self to the old friend of the family. Vernon was alternately charmed to see the loveliness and grace into which the plain, shy, and unformed though always refined, school-girl he left behind had developed, and inclined to be alarmed lest the external polish must have endangered the simplicity withm; for some of the most finished men and women in the world seem to be inspired with unaccountable suspicion by the elegance of others. His alarm was not abiding. But as her equanimity returned, he stood in more and more need of all of it which she, in her turn, could impart to him. It is a very hard thing, when one has made up his own mind to do a hard duty, to have all sorts of unexpected external hinderances and delays come in his way.  The bravest man of any sensibility, who has a severe operation to undergo, will suffer a good deal of pain besides that of the knife, if he has to wait an extra hour for an unpunctual surgeon. Ver- non asked no better than to do his duty and to meet his fate; but his duty was hard, and his fate held aloof. He found the utmost difficulty in obtaining even a lieu- tenant's commission. He had never been, nor en- deavored to be popular, and had accordingly, and especially after his years spent abroad, very few friends at the North. Of these few, he had too much   AGNES WENTWORTH.       13 delicacy to apply to Mr. Wentworth. The poor old man, he thought, had been too much shaken by finding out a death-warrant in the commission of his only son, to be applied to, to obtain one for the friend of his son. Single, on the other hand, had written Vernon, before he left Italy, what he described as "an atrocious let- ter," and had been answered in a manner to put a stop to further communication between them for some time; for if Vernon pitied Southern, he execrated Northern, disloyalty; and well he might; for to the encourage- ment held out by Northern disloyalty he attributed half the misfortunes of the unhappy South. Meanwhile, where strangers were concerned, there were mutual causes enough for distrust and dissatis- faction. At a period when officer after officer in our regular army, regularly sworn in to the support of the national government, was turning his sword against the government, it might well seem a questionable thing to our authorities to give over the command of New England men to an unknown' South Carolinian. On the other hand, our South Carolinian himself knew that such independent, solitary, suicidal loyalty as his, was not of the commonest growth even on New Eng- land's soil. "At home I might have had an eagle, or a star even, for the asking, and taken the field with my mother's blessing instead of her curse!" broke from him bitterly one day, as he stood in a window of Mr. Wentworth's library looking gloomily out over the bleak graves. He had not heard the light step'entering behind him. '-Her curse' "  repeated Agnes's low, horror-struck voice. 15*  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7379-00000089"/> 174     AGNES WENT'WORTH. "I am sorry that it is not in my power to take back the words," said he, starting and turning toward her with a dark flush mantling to his very brow. "I am doubly sorry, since you have heard them." "Well might dear Walter say, there was no loyalty like Southern loyalty," thought Agnes. "I am sorry that I came upon you so at unawares," said she, hur- rying away from the shocking subject; "I am afraid you have met with ill success again to-day." "The same as yesterday, and as I shall meet, I be- gin to believe, to-morrow and to-morrow and to-mor- row!" "It is very hard,-seems very unjust-to us who know you." "I begin to think I may have excited suspicion by my efforts after a place in some regiment intended for the Southeast." "Did you-could you-seek that?" "I could and did; and it will seem to vou, as it did to me, that there was no very heinous treason in plot- ting to protect my mother and my sisters in captivity after helping to overcome my brothers and earliest comrades on the field." "No indeed --If you were only known!" "There really does appear to be nothing left for me, but to go to try my luck at Washington, and, if that fails, to enlist as a private soldier." "Oh, Mr. Vernon, I hope you will never do that!- at least without mature consideration. Mr. Single was here one evening last autumn;' and the conversa- tion turned upon gentlemen's entering the ranks. He disapproved of it, of course, utterly; and Rosam-ond   AGNES WENTWORTH.        175 told him it was like casting balls out of gold, and mounting cannon on ebony and ivory.  Dr. Arden was here too; and he agreed-in part, though he did draw a distinction. 'If young Dives,' he said, 'hap- pens to have his head knocked off, his dividends will do as much good without it as with it, in the world; but the heads of scholars and thinkers aren't quite so easily to be spared or replaced.'  "And what said Mr. Single to that?" "I believe,7' said Agnes demurely, " he took the last half of the sentence for his share, and was too much gratified with its appropriateness to remember the other. I am afraid that was just what Dr. Arden meant he should do, besides; for he gave me such a look that I could scarcely keep my countenance." "I was afraid Miss Wentworth might think it rather Quixotic to serve in any capacity." "He sees into that, does he?" thought Agnes; " and still he can go on, dispensing so calmly with her synm- pathy I Then it must be as I thought before, that he has caught her own indifference, and his old feeling for her is dead and buried too deep for resurrection." "Poor Rosamond!'" answered she. "It is a matter about which she feels more than she thinks. This war has overshadowed all her gay, happy life so drearily." "More than yours?" asked he, fixing his eyes on her with an expression of compassion which might be meant either for her or for Rosamond. "Oh no, nor yet so much as yours, but still very sadly. Our cousin, Egmont Van Rooselandt, grew up with her somewhat as Walter did with me. He died last summer of a fever, on the Potomac; and the shock  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7379-00000090"/> 176      AGNES WENTWORTH. killed his mother, who was like a mother to Rosamond. Then she was obliged to leave New York; and I am afraid, though she is too kind to complain of it to me, that the change must be a most depressing one to her, especially at such a time as this. Boston has always been a fear to her; now, it is a fate. Mr. Vernon,- you have not quite decided, have you, -on going to Washington?" "I think so; why?" "Because something else occurs to me, which you might like to do, if you should still be unable to obtain the command you wished; and oh, Mr. Vernon, sup- posing that you could obtain it, could we require -of you -could your own conscience require of you-to run such an awful risk of staining your sword literally with the blood of a brother? Would not such Roman vir- tue be too Roman to be virtuous?" "It is very generous of you to renounce it.7 "But I do not renounce; I only raise the question. Perhaps I go too far in doing even that. If you had been already in the service when the reb the war broke out, I see that it could have been no question at all; but now,--in your eagerness to reach the mark, may you not rush beyond it??" "Perhaps so; that is one of the doubts that have made me, at least for the last two or three months,-up to the last two or three weeks,-impatient for the end of all-doubts. But you were going to speak of some alternative." "Such an alternative that I might scarcely dare pro- pose it, to any one not capable of preferring glory to renown; for very glorious I think it might be, but   AGNES WENTWORTH.        1" very few will call it so; and it would be hard and, for your comfort, 7 added she forcing a sad smile, " not by any means without its dangers.' "I long to hear." "I have heard that the ambulances are very ill- served, and scarcely commanded at all. The drivers are said to be often men of mutinous and desperate character; and their poor passengers, to be sometimes cruelly neglected or treated;-the wounded,"-- a thought of Walter was blanching her delicate cheek as she, with difficulty, spoke the words,-" needlessly left to die. It struck me that if a man of courage and energy should obtain the command of one of the trains, he could be of incalculable service to our countrymen, -friends and foes." "I thank you for the idea.-I see that much might be made of it.--I like it more and more. Do any fur- ther suggestions occur to you?" "Only that perhaps you may think it best, if stran- gers to you will be so suspicious of you, to say nothing of your wish to reach the Southeast, till your loyalty is shown, and honored as it deserves," said Agnes with her amber eyes shining like the dawn. "It is hard for any honorable man to be suspected, is it not?" rejoined Vernon, not that he much loved to complain, but that he did love to have her comfort him. "Thou, therefore, endure hardness as becometh a good soldier of Jesus Christ,"9 breathed from her spon- taneously in tones as sweet and solemn as those of any chant. He smiled at her enthusiasm,--a grateful, but mourn-  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7379-00000091"/> 178      AGNES WENTWORTH. ful, smile: "You hope that for me?-Well, at least I wish it; Life has taught me more wishes than hopes. Meantime-Miss Agnes, if I do your bidding will you do something for me? There is no other 'little sister' now to give to me the amulet that you gave Walter when he went away." "The little New Testament?-Indeed, I will give you one ; but-that one?" she faltered "Oh no, that would be too much for me even to wish; that is too sacred to be ever exposed to the chances of war again; but if vou could only put my name-mine alone--in any one, in your handwriting, and surround some of the verses in it with your little figures and flowers,"- "That would be the least that I could do." CHAPTER XXVI. AGNES went out on the afternoon of that very day for the little keepsake she had promised Vernon, for the first time on foot since-since that black date, which, as such dates do, cut all her life in twain,-its first great sorrow from its early joys,--her womanhood from her youth. When she had chosen the book and left the shop, an irresistible, sudden yearning drew her toward- the church beneath which she had seen Walter buried. It was closed. She walked to and fro before it, and could not bear to leave it. How it seemed to stand at bay   AGNES WENTWORTH.        179 over him, to keep her aloof I How huge and shut and blank and stony its great face looked,--impassive and relentless! If he-he, the live Walter,-had been there and seen half those tears that were coursing each other down beneath her pall-like mourning veil, how quickly every barrier would have been opened to her! How the sexton would have been found, the gates unbarred, and the dim aisle lighted that there at least she might pace and pray near, if not in sight of, the dead, and out of sight of the curious eyes, whose notice she began to fear that she was even now drawing upon her! How strange it was,.there,-where so many Sundays he and she had set their faces homewards side by side,-to see the very pigeons alive and free, pluming themselves and running to and fro together in the last bright rays of setting sunshine on the outside, and to think of him locked within, powerless, helpless, speechless and breathless, in the cold and in the dark I Fear lest she should sob aloud in the street, at length forced her away. Almost faint with her dis- used exertion, she paused at the door of the dark dining- room, thinking to rest a little before going up to her chamber. But she heard voices above-Rosamond's and a young man's--a young gentleman's,-almost for the moment she could fondly fancy it Walter's. She listened until she made sure that it was Vernon's; and then a longing for light, and for some human com- panionship, made her creep on up one flight of stairs and join the pair in the library. It was almost as dark, however, as the room below. They were chatting sociably together by the firelight only; and her entrance evidently interrupted their con-  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7379-00000092"/> 180     AGNES WENTWOR TH. versation. Rosamond seemed then first to notice that the dusk had overtaken them, and rose to ring, as Ag- nes wished that she would not, for John and his gas- lighter. Then Rosamond and Vernon each began to say something,-perhaps neither of them knew what; and each left off for the other to finish. The upshot of it all was that, between their apparent embarrassment and Agnes's anxiety lest the intrusive lamps should show them her swollen eyelids, she withdrew again, as soon as she could do so without betraying her pain- ful consciousness that her presence was an intrusion. She rolled her sofa into the bay-window of her cham- ber, and lay looking out to see the moonshine on the snowy graves and tombs, with a strange, stunned feel- ing as if her chief fellowship had been, was, and was forever to be with the dead. Her desire to weep had been surprised away ;-her sense of solitude, intensi- fied. Perhaps nothing strikes into us a more sudden, instinctive, unreasoning sense of loneliness than to discover, that two persons to whom we seemed to be much,-and who lately seemed to be little to one another,-have approached each other and left us out, --that they have entered into mutual confidences in which we may not share. For the first time now the idea fully bore itself in upon Agnes, that she had held the first place in one loving heart, and that that was the heart that was cold. Clearly, distinctly, the words that were spoken, as she was crossing the passage and threshold below, came back to her now, restored by the mysterious memory of the ear ;-her mind had then been absent, still occupied with the emotions of her walk:   AGNES WENTWORTH.        181 "You are satisfied?" asked the echo of the voice of Vernon. "It is all," answered that of the fluty tones of Rosa- mond, "that a reasonable woman could require." "And you give me your God-speed to Mr. Went- worth?"  "With all my heart." These sentences said themselves to Agnes, over and over. Their meaning seemed clear enough. "Once it would have made me very happy," thought she; "but that was when it would have made dear Watty so, too. Well, I hope grief is not making me selfish. I ought, at least, not to become impatient of others' happiness, even if I can no longer enter into it. It does seem soon though, for another change." Then dressing- time came; and it was hard to rise and dress; and din- ner-time came; and it was hard to go down and dine. "Will everything always be hard, henceforth?" thought she. Vernon dined with them. His presence was in one way a relief. It saved Agnes from her usual need of forcing her spirits in order to help Rosamond raise her father's. It was too early in their mourning for them to open their doors to ordinary guests; in all his' sor- row the poor old gentleman, without knowing what it was he wanted, missed his habitual stimulus of so- ciety; and Vernon, always welcome for his own sake to Mr. Wentworth, was now still more so for that of his son. The gentlemen sat long over their wine. The ladies left the table early. Rosamond went to the disused piano. Her good -taste deterred her still from secular 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7379-00000093"/> 18 52     AGNES WENTWORTH. music; but instrumental music was her one enthu- siasm,-or at least had hitherto seemed so;--and she seized the opportunity to make the room ring with selections from the so-called sacred pieces of Rossini, playing, as her sister thought, with more brilliancy and power than ever before; though her execution was generally acknowledged to be extraordinary even for musical New York. Agnes was usually glad enough to hear her in any- thing; but she always preferred the graver, grander German music to the Italian ; and now the latter shook her in every nerve. She quietly escaped to the retire- ment and comparative stillness of her chamber and, incapable of fresh invention and eager to shut out thought, busied herself in copying the tiny illustrations out of Walter's New Testament into Vernon's. The latter was likely to start for Washington within a week; and there was no time to lose. The music, though muffled, still came up after her, making her feet thrill through the floor. That helped to hurry her; she had to draw in time to it. At ten o'clock, it ceased; and she was glad.  Afterward,-she did not know how long afterward,-there came a knock at her door,-a knock like Walter's. "Come in," she criedi and Rosamond came in and kissed her. "Darling, I am afraid for once I have been quite too noisy for you." "Dear Rosanmond, don't think I don't like. to have you happy," answered Agnes, returning her caress with interest and all the more for a little self-reproach. "I don't think so," said Rosamond somewhat ab- sently; "but do you like to have me happy, well.   AO GVES WENTWCORTH.      183 enough to like to have me take my own way of being happy?--that is the question." "I hope so.-I should like to try to like it at least." "I hope so," echoed Rosamond; "that is the kind of sympathy I cherish in my noble heart for you and all my friends; but it is sympathy, I have often ob- served, of the very rarest kind. Indeed, I have long labored under the impression that nobody is quite so magnanimous as myself." "And is it that sentiment with which my sympathy is called for just now?" asked Agnes, trying to fall in with her mood. "Not exactly, nor my happiness either just yet. The fact is if I drove you away with the piano, with- out meaning it, I was bent upon driving away care, without-quite-succeeding in it. I am coming to a great resolution, Agnes,-one that it has taken me a long while to come to. We had better say whatever is to be said about it before than after. I think it is for my happiness; I hope it will be, so far as anything, for the happiness of all concerned, on the whole; but once done, it cannot be undone. Suppose, when it is too late, I wish myself free again?"' The expression of anxiety, which her face had lately worn, deepened -till she looked almost haggard. "Dear Rosamond, how could you, if you love him?" "Him' Il-Whom?"   cried Rosamond turning to her with a start, while both sisters colored to their temples. "t Mr. -- the gentleman we both have in our minds."  "I did not think you-suspected ;-well the whole  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7379-00000094"/> 184     AGNES WENTWORTH. world may know before long; so it can't make much difference to him.-But I don't 'love him' as you will love, if you ever do love, Agnes. I know men too well for that; I have been all my life too much behind the scenes with them. The gloss is off; I see them as they are,--larger patterns than we, often-that I don't dispute,-but not half so finely wrought." "But then,-oh sister, sister!-if you do not love him, how can it be for the happiness of either?" "He has been in love with me for years--almost from his boyhood. Hb would be only too happy to take me on my own terms. I make no more profes- sions to him than to you, Agnes. Whatever else I do, I would not decoy him blindfold to the altar." "No, to be sure I know you could not; but" "What?" "I believe I ought not to say it." "If you love me, you will. Let me hear both sides before I decide. Make me change my mind if you can.  It may be doing me a good office,--better than we either of us know." "But, then, I should think it could hardly be for any one's happiness, Rosamond, to go on through life side by side with a person like you, bearing day by day, as he must, a growing burden of, unreturned affection.- That was not exactly what I was going to say, though. Since you wish to hear it-I am  afraid I do wrong to say it, but--may you not stand in the way of his- some time-marrying some one who would love him?"' Agnes said it, in all honesty, for Rosamond's and Ver- non's sake; but, for her own, she would rather have kept it back. She feared lest she might be acting out   AGNES WENTWORTH.        185 a selfish unwillingness, of which she was becoming conscious, to bave her brother's friend and her sister nearer to one another than to her. "Why, to tell the truth," answered Rosamond, "with all his merits, I do not think he is precisely the man,.to make any woman of sense very much in love with :him;" ("What different eyes we see with!" thought Agnes:) "and yet," continued her sister, "he has too much sense himself to think a fool a fit wife for him. He would never, I believe, meet with any one who would try harder than I have tried to be in love with him n" "' Tried to be in love with him'!" "Yes. Now do you wonder that I hesitate?" "Yes ;-no!" "Precisely,--most right the first time. You would not entertain the question for a moment; but then we are, in every respect, two perfectly different beings. For one thing, you are a genius and born to a career; for another, in marriage you would have everything or nothing. Now my demands are moderate; when I -cannot have the best, I take the next-best. I do not look upon life as a-fairy godmother to afford me all that I should like; I ask of it little more than the means of pleasant living. If I were to sit down to frame three wishes for it to grant me, one of them of course would be the very paragon of princes to sit beside me in my palace. As it is, 1 should think my- self only too lucky if I could get the palace without anyi prince." The strange instinct of confession harried Rosamond on.. She spoke almost incoherently, and more and more rapidly as if she longed to have done: 16'  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7379-00000095"/> 186     AGNES WENTWORTH. "But we women are airy nothings; if we want a local habitation and a name, we must look to some of our lords and masters for them. I do want a local habita- tion and a name. Very soon I shall be a middle-aged human being. I don't want to pass my whole life in doing nothing and being nobody. But until we take some man by the hand, we never are properly en rap- port with the world. I really am, if not quite an inno- cent victim, the victim of circumstances. If I could have my own way, I think I might prefer to work my own way and enjoy myself. I am neither sickly nor silly nor lazy; though I dare say I am nothing re- markable. Even if I could not outscold Jeffreys, or out-comnment Blackstone, perhaps I could conduct a cause as well as Portia. At any rate, I do not see why I could not make as good a lawyer's clerk as-as most other young people." Agnes's eyes followed the direction of Rosamond's to the two youthful portraits,-hers and her brother's, --which still hung over the mantel-piece. It was im- possible not to see how much more intellectual was the head of the dark, spirited girl than that of the fair, effeminate boy. "I should, truly, like to help papa," continued Rosa- mond. "I should like to do something to keep the credit he has won for his name from dying out of the world while we live in it. But there is no use in thinking of any of those things; and it is hard for a family to have no young man in it. I know my choice, if he is my choice, will be attentive and dutiful to papa -whenever they are together." "I am sure of it."   AGNES WENTWORTH.        181 "And a kind brother, dear little Agnes." "I am sure that he would wish to be; but -"Agnes was going to say, "I suppose we shall be far apart." Rosamond, however, for once interrupted her and still hurried on : "' But' not like the one you have lost, --oh, no; I know that too well. There are few such brothers in the world, or sisters, as you and he were to each other. But Mr.   but he would help me to change the scene for yon. What was I going to say? -Oh;-rightly or wrongly--' whatever is, is right,' H suppose,-at all events men have the lion's share of the good things of this life; and, if we want any share at all, we must stoop to be their jackals The only thing for us to do is, to do without, or else choose the best lion we can-among the lions who offer. This is what I have sincerely tried to do. I think that-' that gentleman we both have in our minds,' as you say, is a liberal and honorable man of good principles and blameless life. If there had been any proof or sus- picion to the contrary, Egmont would have been only too glad to tell me. He was jealous, poor fellowl I liked Egmont best; though I never should have mar- ried him, because-because his character was different. I never was-I never could be-I never shall be in love; but I always do love, as a matter of course, any- body that belongs to me; that makes me think that,- if I ever have one,--I shall love my husband. I never broke a promise in my life; that makes me think that, if ever I take marriage vows, I shall keep them." She paused, perhaps -for encouragement, but, re- ceiving none, proceeded to consider the alternative-as if Agnes had proposed it: "No, I cannot live without  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7379-00000096"/> 188     AGNES WENTWORTH. excitement; I don't believe anybody can--any life that is more than a living death. Some people think they do; but that is only because they give some more respectable nanme to their own particular kind of excite- ment. Call it'-business, politics, play, fashion, philan- thropy, or what you will, it is either innocent excite- ment or excitement which is not innocent that is our life. Now you may wonder to hear it, little nun, but I was a really better woman at New York, with all my balls and calls and frolics, than I am in a way to be here in good, staid Boston between church and constitutionals. There at least I was generally care- ful about my reading; and since I came here I have been through a whole shelf of poor Watty's French novels. After each one, I resolve against another; but then-there's nothing else to do. What is there else to do?" said Rosamond, putting the previous ques- tion as the clock struck twelve. "To pray," said Agnes. Rosamond noticed her look instead of her words. "Poor child, how wan and worn you are Do go to bed; let me help you." "Thank you,-not quite yet." {"I have talked you to death; but now at any rate you know the worst of me; and still you love me?- Only that one word more, little angel,-however I decide, you will love me?" "1 Rosamond, if ever your love and the love of you are taken from me, I think I shall die. You are the last. Ad "She is too tired to speak or think," said Rosa- mond to herself, and left the room, her own spirits not *   AGNES WENTWORTH.        189 raised by the conversation; "I ought not to have told her at night; but I did long to have it over; and then, on her own account, I had a reason." CHAPTER    XXVII. AGNES did not go to rest, nor to bed; she could not bear the thought of it. She was indeed, as Rosamond supposed, too tired to think; but her whole being was one chaos of emotions. Every- nerve of her spirit was jarred. There are crises in life in which there comes up a mysterious necessity that some must be sacrificed for others. Where such human sacrifices are to be made for the good of others, generous victims can sometimes yield themselves up thereto in a kind of passion of willingness, struggling upward, through much agony and prayer, into some sustaining fellow- ship with the crucified Son of Man and God. Agnes had a soul probably capable,-on that condition-of bringing itself sooner or later to this height. But where such a sacrifice seems to be not for the good of others, but merely an incidental though inseparable circumstance of their unhallowed sacrifice of them- selves and one another, then heaven help the poor, poor victim! So heaven help Agnes I She was put to the torture. A crowd of unanswer- able questions, smaller and greater, thronged her brain: If Rosamond did not mean to say that she would pawn *  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7379-00000097"/> 190     A GNES WENTWORTH. her very soul to obtain the means of gaiety and pleas- ure, then what did she mean? Could her own old friend-Walter's friend-stoop so low as to enter into such a compact? But if, in spite of Rosamond self- deceived, he did not understand her "own terms," would not Agnes, at least, be a base party to the cheat if she welcomed him with cordiality into her family? And if, on the other hand, she should not so welcome him, would not he and Rosamond both think her unkind, and therefore the hearts of both grow cold toward her? Could she herself be sunk so low as to be jealous of her sister? Migrht not half this bitter heart- ache, that she had, be jealousy without her meaning or knowing it? Oh, why think so much about herself? Let herself go! But what would the end of it be to all of them, if even the beginning stung Rosamond into speaking with such unwonted levity and bitter- ness? Oh, why had Agnes not dissuaded her more? Be- cause she was too self-conscious. Then why could she not dissuade her more to-morrow? Because she was perhaps still too self-interested. Oh, it was misery-misery every way,-while Park Street clock went on striking "One o'clock,"--"Two o'clock,"-- "Three o'clock,"--"Four o'clock,"--"Five o'clock,"-- as if, to Agnes's fevered apprehension, measuring out; "Woe!" "Woe, woe!" "Threefold Woe V" "And yet more Woe!" "For evermore, Woe!" As often as she knelt to say her prayers, she started up again, fancying, in her feverish wretchedness, that her own irreverent inattention was turning the ear of Mercy from her. At last, in something like despera-   AGNES WENTWORtH.        191 tion, she threw herself down once more, with her prayer- book opened before her, and hurriedly ran over the inspired petitions of the Church of England, at first mechanically, but with a growing sense of shelter and help that calmed the throbbing of her pulses until she was able to resign herself to rest. Agnes was young enough to fancy, when she waked, that as that night had been, so was the rest of her life to be. She was wrong as to both fact and theory. Even when our misfortunes are unalterable, our sense of them is not so. As she sat leaning back in her chair, with her late breakfast before her; musing much and fitfully trying to eat a little, there was a tap at the door. Vernon came in, looking as she would have expected, animated, eager, and a little nervous. She started. He explained: "Rosamond--Miss Wentworth--told me I should find you here. I was anxious to see for myself how you were. She was afraid you had not a good night." That seemed very brotherly; and Agnes did her best to prepare to be sisterly: "Thank you ; it is very kind. If I turned night into morning, I turned morn- ing into night again; as you may guess by finding me here at this time of day. I hope it is not too late for me to offer you a cup of coffee?" He accepted it,- but played with it, as if he wanted it only as an excuse for staying. He stirred the fire when she shivered, drew down the window-shade when the sun flashed in her eyes, put anything that she wanted within her reach as soon as she wanted it, and seemed tenderly bent upon watching over her, while urging  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7379-00000098"/> 192     AGNES WENTWORTH. upon her nothing--not even conversation. Not even Walter had ever taken such care of her before; but e then, to be sure, while she had Walter she never had need of such care. As she tcquiesced in the silence which Vernon seemed to see to be necessary for her, she had to ac- knowledge to herself," "He does make a sweet brother. He must end, if he cannot begin, by making Rosamond love him as he ought to be loved. It seems as if she must love him already better than she thinks; and per- haps he sees it for himself. Perhaps the chief of my trouble last night was only some shocking, morbid phase of feeling, that will never come back or, at all events, forever pass away as I regain my health; and then I shall be as thankful as I used to think I should be, to have him really belong to us." With the hope, her countenance brightened; and she rewarded his attentions with a smile that was no longer forced or sad, but that was almost startled away again, not- withstanding, by her seeing how brilliantly his own reflected it. "' You are better already," cried he. "You looked quite worn out. When you have been an artist as long as I, you will know how to' understand these fits of nervous exhaustion and depression,-very miserable, -appalling until you understand them,--when you do, often very easy to deal with; though, I own, my pre- cept may be better than my example. When they are complicated with sorrow, they become a disorder in which it requires no common hardihood to enable the patient to minister to himself.

"Thank you,-I am afraid not to-day." "And my days here are numbered." Agnes's heart smote her: What if he never came back?"I have your little book all ready for you," answered she, by way of atonement; "would you like it this forenoon??" ' I should not like to make you go up stairs." "It is no further off than the library. I think we shall both be more comfortable there now." They went up together. Agnes expected to find Rosamond, as she had left her, there; but the room was empty. She took the little claret-colored stamped- leather volume, with its golden cross and clasps, from a drawer of the table in her alcove, and brought it to him. tie did not thank her. He only received, unclasped, and opened it, and stood turning over the pages with the airy pencillings in the margin, as if he did not see them. There was a pause on both sides; then, still looking down, he said in a low voice, with a tremor in it as if from a beating heart, "I have something to say to you before I go. May I say it now?" If his heart beat, that of Agnes stood still. He raised his eyes, glowing as she had never seen even his eyes glow before, to her face for an answer. She bowed, and rested her folded hands on the high back of a chair by which she happened to be standing. "Sit down first," said he, gently enough, yet not without a certain presentiment in his tone, that sit down she would. 17I  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7379-00000099"/> 194      AGNES WFNTWORT1I. She obeyed. Brothers are expected to be sometimes a little peremptory. Again he paused as if for words, till another glance at her pale face hurried him, and he said, scarcely knowing what he said, "Agnes,--Miss Agnes,-my eves have lately been opened to see that a heavenly spirit has, for years, been often near me, ministering to me so far as my earthness could suffer it to minister. If I had the tongue of a seraph, I would thank you be- fore I leave you." He paused again; but there was no answer; for what could Agnes answer?"Agnes,--Miss Agnes,- we measure our demands upon guardian angels not by our own deserts, but by their goodness. These are scarcely times for marrying or giving in marriage; but yet will you not give me your dear hand as a pledge that, if Peace ever comes again, you will bring her into my heart and home?" She leaned back and closed her eyes; her breath was gone. He knelt and took her passive hand. That roused her; and she looked at himn and said almost in- audibly, "I cannot understand." "I know I am not worthy to be your husband; but you will make me worthier if you will be my wife," explained Vernon, made more matter-of-fact all of a sudden by a well-founded fear of her fainting away. Agnes sat upright in her chair. Something seemed very strange; something seemed very bright; but what was real?"But Rosamond?" she faltered, as a little of her breath came back. "Approves heartily. I was just obtaining her sanc- tion here yesterday afternoon, when you came in. She   A GNES WENTWORTH.       195 only advised me to wait till this morning before I spoke to you, for fear of your night's rest being dis- turbed." "t Yes, that was very good for my night's rest," said Agnes. Internally, in the great revulsion of feeling, she laughed and cried and clapped her hands. Ex- ternally she was very quiet; for "When indeed our Joves come down We all turn stiller than we have ever been." But a soft rose-color came into her cheeks, and an am- ber light into her eyes. She returned the pressure of his hands tremulously and softly; and Vernon was answered in a measure. As for the fuller measure that he coveted, he was good and waited. She was busy with trying her new-found treasure on every side, to make sure that it was all genuine and not fairy gold : "My father?' "I secured his consent before I ventured to ask for yours. Agnes, my own dear Agnes, you will not be the one,-you who have shown me paradise,-to shut the door of paradise to me. It is far off at the best; it may be years before I can reach it to enter in and dwell. May I not have the distant glimpse to limpse to light me onward in the black path which I,-which all loyal men,-in these days, must tread? Surely you love me a little, or you could not look at me so kindly. You could hardly look at me more kindly if you loved me as I love you " "Do I not love you, Ernest? I would give my life. for you if it were mine to give,-for you and Walter."

But for the future -" "Oh, that awful future! Must it come in to torment us before the time? Now without it would be such infinite peace and bliss! A whole lifetime's relief and blessedness seem to be pressed into to-day. If it could only last!" "But it will last while we last, if you will-you zoill -only give me this precious hand upon it." "Dearest Ernest, God knows how ready-how joyful I am to promise you all that I can. I will be as con- stant to you as if I were yours. If God ever gives me to you, I will be yours; and then, or never in this world, I shall be happy again." "' If he gives you to me'?how?" It was hard for Agnes to explain: "Oh, Ernest, you are going away.   You are going into danger. The time is near-the time is here--when my prayers must be fervent for you; and, that they may be effect- ual, how I must strive to be righteous I Ernest, would it be righ--nowfor me to promise myself--uncon- ditionally-to you?" "My poor child, you are not so ascetic as to suppose such a love as yours and mine unpleasing in the sight "  No, not that." She took up the little New Testa- ment again, opened it with trembling hands and pointed to a text. He read, " 'Be ye not unequally yoked with unbe- lievers.' Is that the barrier between us?" "The only barrier."' "I promise you, that I will do my honest best to   AGNES WENTWOR TH.       197 throw it down. I do believe in God; God help me i' '"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, amen!" said Agnes. He pressed her no further. It went to her heart to see into what a tender and chastened sadness his new hope faded away. He made her rest on the sofa. He read to her in his deep, prophetic voice from the gospel of St. John. The room was like a still cham- ber of death; except that he who was about to face Death was the one to minister. Anybody, who did not know Vernon, may think that it was but a cold lover who could be so easily put off. But I did know Vernon. I know that, with all his failings, the poor fellow was very noble. Any-  thing that he really loved, he was capable of loving to a white heat of self-devotion. He might fairly enough have pleaded that, if his fellowship was not with Christ, neither was it with Belial. But he saw, as soon as Agnes had spoken, that she was right. 'As the husband is, the wife, is," could never be spoken more truly than to her. Her character was a strong one in many respects; but it was moreover strongly sympathetic, especially on the side toward him. Per- haps he agreed with a more famous sceptic in hold- ing infidelity A" too stern a virtue for a woman." He had not the heart, at any rate, to lure his dove down from her high, clear Ararat above the muddy waters of this life, to ruffle and drabble her snowy wings by struggling in the flood of doubt with him. ' Looking backward, he could see how his mere knowledge of his father's silent unbelief had made faith well-nigh im- 17*  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7379-00000101"/> 198     AGNES WEN'TW'ORTH. possible to him even in his boyhood. He did not wish, in his turn, to leave a son behind him to take his chance against such trial and temptation as he himself had undergone, with no more aid and guidance than he had had. A rare refinement and loftiness of nature had happened to preserve him from any outward deg- radation; but he had seen many another go down at his side, and had not wondered. So much as this he believed, especially in Agnes's presence, that, if reli- gion was a dream, life was not worth the having. So their last days together were very solemn and affecting days, spent in mutual tenderness all the greater for their mutual pity. Because they could be no more to each other, they did for each other so much ' the more eagerly all that was in their power. As if she had been his wife, Agnes prepared every little comfort she could think of, for his journey and cam- paign. As if he had been her husband, he bequeathed all his property to her; though that she did not know till some time afterward. Rosamond, like herself, con- siderately held aloof and intercepted from them all interruptions. Straightway the last night came. They were together and alone. He showed her a small Bible, and asked her to keep it for him while he was away. It was a handsome one and, to her sur- prise, bore the marks of long though careful use. "My mother gave me this, when I first left her for the North," said he; "for her sake, I have read it often. The time may come when I can bear to see it, and to think of her, again." "Poor Ernest!" said Agnes, as she received it and thought of the example set him, and the curse laid   AGNES WENTWORTH.       199    . upon him, by that mother, "how much you have had against you, in every way!" "Nay," cried he, " she acted the book out faithfully, according to her understanding of it, poor dear lady; and I have no doubt that she does so still." "But that can hardly make it the easier for you to believe in the book."  ,' I think she takes her present maxims chiefly from the Old Testament. Am I to receive that too?" asked he playfully. "As a. present rule of life and faith?--I supposed that the revelation of Moses was chiefly for the Jews and the times before the birth of the Saviour; and his revelation for us and for all times." "In serious earnest, love, I could not leave you without learning from you, as definitely as you can show me, what is the standard of faith which you would have me aim at.") "I am very ignorant," said Agnes timidly; "but I should not think that any right-minded Christian could call any one an unbeliever who, in deed and word, ac- knowledged Jesus Christ as his divinely appointed and accredited Master and Lord, and who looked to him as his Saviour." Vernon took from his pocket the little volume she had given him, and wrote something carefully on the fly-leaf. Then he showed it to her,-her own words, with the date of time and place. She could only hope that those words were right; she knew not how to qualify or to take them back. Then he talked to her, and she to him, of other things; and then they parted; -how, they never told, nor how they bore to part.  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7379-00000102"/> 200     AGNES WENTW 'OR TH. CHAPTER XXVIII. WHEN he was gone, Agnes bad time to think in her turn of Rosamond, and of the enigmas she had talked on the eve of Vernon's proposal. Agnes's tongue was loosed now, at all events. If Rosamond really was on the point of accepting a lover, and not for love, Agnes would do her utmost to dissuade her, if it was not too late. But, having misunderstood her so far, might not Agnes, in the feverish perturbation of her own lately unldinged Pmind, have misunderstood her further? And who could that mysterious "gentleman in their minds" be? The morning after Vernon's departure, Agnes was considering how to broach the subject anew, as her sister in unusual silence sat embroidering beside her, when a postmarked letter was brought in. She put out her hand for it instinctively; but it was directed to "MAiss Wentworth;"Agnes must wait for hers from Vernon, of course, till to-morrow. She had happened, though, to see the handwriting,-masculine certainly, --whose, she could not remember; yet it looked familiar. It was not a Van Rooselandt hand; and Rosamond was little addicted to correspondence with gentlemen out of her family. Could the writer be " the gentleman"? "A message for you, dear," said Rosamond presently with affected carelessness as, having glanced over the   AGNES WENTWORTH.        201     I missive with an uncommonly fine bloom on her cheeks, she put it into the fire. "Indeed?"  "From Mr. Horace Single: his ' fraternal regards;' and he hopes for your better acquaintance.--He will be at the Tremont on Saturday. I did not expect him  till Monday." "Rosamond I Do you really mean?" -- "Yes, I really mean,"-said Rosamond, clipping the needleful of worsted she was working with, into inch bits, with her sharp little scissors, and looking at it like a pretty young Atropos. "You have accepted him?"' "I have accepted -him," said Rosamond, gravely and resolutely raising her eyes to meet hr. sister's; "and therefore you will accept him too, I know, for my sake." "Certainly-if-I have no dislike to Mr. Single,- that is, personally,"--stammered Agnes, remembering his dreadful politics, " only"- "'Only,' as I told you, we are two different crea- tures. I gave you warning and a full hearing before- hand remember, Agnes; and you could not bring me over." "Because my tongue was, tied. Oh, Rosamond, I could not plead with you then as I would, for fear of pleading-somewhat-my own cause. I understood you to be speaking of-of Ernest." Rosamond rose and standing before her, stroked her cheek and looked fondly into her eyes. "Now that I feel," continued Agnes, " what bliss it is to love as one is loved; how can I let you cut yourself off from it forever?"  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7379-00000103"/> 202     AGNES WENT IVOR TH. "Perhaps you describe something like the state of the case between Mr. Single and me," returned Rosa- mond, trying to speak lightly. "At any rate, I have given my word." "Oh, why could - not - why did I not-speak earlier?' "It would have done no good. Don't reproach your- self, darling; leave that to those who have cause. I could no more love like you, than Mr. Single could like Mr. Vernon; and therefore, trust nle, I am glad that, of the two, Mr. Single fell to my share. He is the least likely to claim more than I can give." "But oh!"- Rosamond stopped her mouth with a kiss; "Now forget all that I have been weak enough to say about the matter, for this: I have given my word." She appeared to be seeking refuge from regret, in the argu- ment that regret was vain. The conversation left Agnes lonelier than before. She tried to make amends to Rosamond, by affectionate attention, for the sympathy that she could not afford her; but Rosamond involuntarily drew off. She felt herself lowered in Agnes's eyes and, accordingly, in ber own.

Vernon's letters   AGNES WENTWORTH.        203 were wont to be as quintessences of Vernon's conver- sation. For a painter, he had remarkable powers of expression as a writer. Notwithstanding, Agnes will not give nme any part of his correspondence for publica- tion, except the heads; and this, time he appears to have had nothing of any importance to communicate, except his wish to consult her about giving up his will-o'-the-wisp hunt after shoulder-straps, and aiming at his little ambulance commission, without further loss of time. (I have seen the epistle in question,-- at a distance;--and it was eight pages long. Now I leave it to my readers to judge whether so small a head could ever have sufficed so large a body, without an utter sacrifice of the noble virtue/ of conciseness to what critics call "an exhaustive treatment of the sub- ject.") However, the letter furnished her with abundant occupation; and proper occupation is, as we all know, a specific against mental disquiet. In the first place she had to run up to the attic, which had been his studio, and hide with the letter,--as a cat does, in a garret, with the mouse. whose possession she enjoys with the ungrudging acquiescence of a whole house- hold. Then she had to kiss 'it; and then she- had to read it; and then she had to cry over it; and then, to kiss it a little more, and to cry over it a little more, and to read it a few times more,-first one and then  the other, just as it happened. Then she had to think about her answer and what advice she ought to give;   ! and that--especially as the letter went down with her again to her chamber, and lay open before her all the, time upon her toilet-table,-carried her quite through  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7379-00000104"/> 204     AGNES WENT WORTH. the otherwise unpleasant business of dressing to re- ceive Mr. Brother-in-law. She longed meanwhile to have Vernon famous- famous as a wai*or even, since war there must be and he must be in 3: She was sure he deserved to be a, major-general. Still was there not something finer in the shrinking from making any capital for himself out of his country's misery,-of which she was beginning to perceive the beginning in him,-the willingness to forego any title of honor which should in after-times be a perpetual reminder to him of the dishonor of his na- tive State? And yet, on the other hand, might not much be done to cover that dishonor, by any South Carolinian who should win and wear loyal laurels, "faithful found among the faithless"? But then again if he should be brought into the field against any of his near kindred, and--oh, horrible! Vernon was a man never to get the better of such a misery,--to be haunted by it to his dying day. With such thoughts and questions all parleying with one another in her girlish brain, she went mechanic- ally down to see Single. The door-bell had rung; and somebody been admitted. She had no doubt it was he. The library-door was ajar. She saw him through the crack, and involuntarily paused an instant to see him as if for the first time. There he was, to be sure, looking, in all his appointments, like a "fashion-print" of a  gentleman. How strange it was to see him coolly sitting there, established as one in their domestic circle and never to be got out again! He was a tall and rather large, though not corpulent, nman, with   A G NES VJIENTTWORTH.     205 a style of manner still, as a shoemaker would have said, one size too big for him, that made him seem like a kind of mountain in a mist. Agnes shrank like a school-girl frovi going in; once in, she would be in for it forever Yet it hardly seemed worth while to go up stairs again;' and she could not well stay where she was without hearing "courting" not meant for her ears; for Rosamond was already doing her duty by him, sparkling with un- wonied jets and vivacity. Agnes's tred&amp;Nvas incon- veniently light; but she grasped a fold 0o her bom- bazine, shook it, and made the lining rustle; and Rosamond started and turned toward her; and Single rose and received her greeting with due cordiality. It was a very kind one on her part, not only for propriety's and for Rosamond's sake but partly for Single's own. She remembered how well Walter had loved him; she hoped and rather expected as matters stood that Rosamond would love him, even if she did not a little already; and she pitied him that Rosamond did not love him more, especially as he did appear to love Rosamond.  He seemed very happy,--pleased with her and proud of her. He was pleased with Agnes too. He had never particularly noticed her before; but, now that there was a reason for his doing so, he did so, and thought he might be proud of her likewise. She had grown up into " quite a distinguished- looking young lady," he told Rosanond by and by in con- fidence. The air of quiet reserve which was innate and unconscious in her, he took for haughtiness and called high-breeding. (Single was very fond of talking about high-breeding, a fondness which, by an odd contrariety, 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7379-00000105"/> 206     AGNES WENTWORT'H. seems peculiarly wont to be found in people who do not well know what high-breeding is.) He was ac- cordingly all the more gratified by the particular con- sideration with which she treated him. Rosamond meantime watched them with ill-concealed anxiety; and turned her hand as it lay on her lap, so that her mourning handkerchief fell over a stout new diamond heavily set in black enamel, that Agnes's quick eye had, however, already spied "squat like a toad " upon her sister's round white finger which, lying as it did on her black dress, looked as if severed from her htd. Agnes would have been more grateful to Rosamond than to Single, had she been aware of the fact that that fair damsel's pocket contained a pearl, of dimensions and setting to match the diamond, which Mr. Single had brought as a propitiatory offer- ing to his new sister. His betrothed had considerately intercepted it for the time, informing him that luckily Agnes's birthday was not far off, and that the gift would then come with a peculiar grace. He highly approved the idea; for, as Rosamond knew, appro- priateness was one of his hobbies. Perhaps his riding it so hard, as he did on this day, was a cause that combined with Agnes's preoccupa- tion to make the conversation at dinner too uninterest- ing to her, for her to remember it. He talked to Rosa- mond about what he thought would be most agreeable to her,-gay people and doings at New York. Rosa- mond might have been only too glad to hear, if they had been alone; for what he told her was like news of his native land to an exile; but she feared it must jar on Agnes's feelings, and therefore soon tried to change   A GNES WENT VORTH.       207 the subject. He talked art to Agnes; but that threw her thoughts back to her lover. To Mr. Wentworth he tried to talk law; but as he did not know much about it beyond the "Lives of the Chancellors," and as the poor old gentleman had more than enough of it at his office, for the present state of his spirits, even that did not prosper. Then, in the midst of his bliss, Single would remember the recent bereavement of the family, and his own real regret for the loss of his old classmate, and assume an undertaker's air depressing to all; and Rosamond had scarcely more than helped the gentlemen to their nuts when she left'tL': former to eat the latter by themselves. "I am so sorry we were so dull to-day,", said Agnes with compunction, as she accompanied her sister to the library; and then it occurred to her that she might as well have held her tongue. "It is rather soon to expect you to be very cheer- ful," said Rosamond; " but, if it will not disturb you, I should like to play a little. It shall be something as grave as yourself. What shall it be?" "Oh, the Seventh Symphony I How I should love to hear it I Dear Rosy, how I shall miss your play-- ing when you are gonel" Rosamond played with splendid desperation. But Mr. Single's boots came creaking right into the midst of the Allegretto: "What is that?-Bach?" said he. Rosamond explained, struck a few  "handfuls of notes " as final chords, and rose. "Is that all?" said he, "But why do you rise?" "Did you think I did not know your aversion to the piano?"  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7379-00000106"/> 208     AGNES }VEVTTVORTH. "To yours?" returned he gallantly.  "Really, Rosamond, I am anxious to hear your playing. They tell me it is something, quite extraordinary. Is it not?" asked he, turning eagerly to Agnes. "To me at least, it seems so; and I have no doubt it will seem so to you; but I am afraid I have no right to call myself a critic."7 "No doubt,-of course i but I meant to ask, what do the critics say of it? Do you happen to know?" Thus adjured, Agnes could not on the spur of the moment think of anybody, or anything, in particular to cite, and was again vexed at herself for her own dul- hess. Rosamond laughled. "No matter," said Single gravely, "I will see; I will hear; I will judge for myself. I heard Mrs. D'Eau-R6my last week play Liszt. She is considered the finest amateur performer in New York this winter. Rosamond, hlave you any of Liszt's music there? His is the hardest, isn't it?" "Perhaps so,--yes ;-oh yes, I have." "Now then, if you please; I am ready," said he, taking up a position which commlanded a full view of her fingers and thumbs. The very  spirit of mischief flow into Rosamond. She converted her musical instrument into an instru- ment of revenge. She was strong.  She belabored the keys. She made the poor piano cry at the top of its voice. The unfortunate Abbe seemed to be under- going, with shrieks, the fate of the saint who was pounded in a mortar. All sense and feeling were lost in sound and fury. It was as if Czerny himself had run mad over his "Etudes de la Velocite."   AGNES WENTWOR TH.       209 Agnes longed to stop her ears; and if she could have shut her eyes it would have been all the better for her composure; for they were drawn by a species of fasci- nation to the faces of the performer and spectator. Rosamond's, "half in fun, and half in malice," was turned from Single; and Single's from Agnes. But there was a small chandelier over the piano, and be- side it an unhappy mirror which reflected the happy pair. Quite unaware of this, Single had availed hini- self of the excellent opportunity to stuck between his lips a tiny toothpick, which looked so much like a straw that Agnes could not help being reminded by him of a contemplative horse-jockey seeing a new steed put through its paces. Sitting so near the noise as he did, she was not surprised to see him put his hand to his head two or three times as if it ached; but per- haps that was only because he had eaten cheese and pie. "Brava! Superb!" cried he, promptly rising as Rosamond drove in the last notes and looked round for the verdict. "Positively I could hardly see your little hands.?' "Is there anything else you would like to hear? I am not at all .tired." "Heavens, I should think you would be! I cannot conceive how a delicate female can endure so much. The mere muscular fatigue of it must be tremendous. If you do not feel it to-night, you will to-morrow. I have never seen your execution surpassed; really I do not see how our first professional performers could ex- ceed it.

Those are the hours at which I take my exercise; so that you can make all the clamor that is necessaryv, without any fear of disturbing me. I choose my wife to be the first in everything. I have de- termined to spare no expense," continued he, address- ing himself to Agnes, "to make your sister the hap- piest lady in the land. You must come very often to Tusculum, to see how I succeed,-to my villa, that is,-but probably you have heard of Tusculum." Agnes was thankful to be able to say that she had, and had heard that that estate was very picturesque and lovely. She made haste to do so in order to give Rosamond time to recover fronm his speech, which had brought for once a dangerous light into her brown eyes and color into her checks. -It was a tasteless speech undeniably; but Agcnes, fastidious though she was, could forgive the unconscious tastelessness in it for the sake of the studious kindness. "My guests generally seem  to admire it; I trust you will not disagree with them. If I take from your home its brightest ornament, the least I can do is to bid you welcome to enjoy it as often as possible in mine. And a propos, Rosamond says you are fond of riding.  I always make a point,-and shall do so now still more, of course,-of having in my stud one or two horses that any lady can mount without the slightest fear; and I have at your sister's service, and yours whenever you are with us, a perfectly prudent and steady old groom, who will pick out the most level roads for you and go as slow as you like." "Thank you; I   am exceedingly fond of riding," said that young diplomate, Miss Agnes, pondering in-   AGNES WENTWORTIl.       2" wardly the while, how fond poor Rosamond might be of the horses that "any lady could mount without the slightest fear," of the flat roads, and of the prudent groom. Single had a dreadful wa y of taking up theories about you, and expecting to see you conformed to them. If you were a man under forty, on a visit to him, then you were "a hardy young man " and must enjoy shooting with him afoot from morning till night,i or bumping with him your twenty miles a day on a hard-mouthed horse with a gait like a hammer's. If you were a woman, of any age whatever, then you were a "delicate female,"*- unequal to walking two, or riding ten, miles, or an inch even if the wind was in the east,-and must consequently prefer to be left at home upon any but the tamest excursions. In a word, he had had his own way too much and- too long; and a selfish bachelor life up to the age of thirty years had developed to the utmost his naturally remarkable gift of egotism,-egotism, that sworn foe to tact. There was another thing that made against him now. He had seldom much affected any society but that of "his equals," i e. other young men of leisure. Accordingly he wanted practice in adapting himself to any other society. At the same time his pride and vanity, at adding to his other possessions that of the most brilliant belle "in the market," had got into his head and, for the time being, completely turned it. * "If you mean cat, my dear, then why don't you say cat?" commented Rosamond, one day when she had heard the above expression once too often.  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7379-00000108"/> 212     AGNES WENT WORTII. Thus he outdid himself with blunder upon blunder; till even Rosamond wondered to see what a figure he cut as a wooer, and her sister, feeling it all for her, dreaded to see him open his lips. When at last the evening had come to an end, Agnes, reviewing it and especially the musical entertainment, was at no loss to understand, though she was sorry to hear, a low peal of laughter which came from Rosa- mond's chamber. Rosamond had better have cried. She did however, probably, after some fashion repent; for that scene was never repeated. Most likely the impulse took her by surprise; and she would have laughed more heartily with Single than at him, over her mischief, if he had not been too owlish to detect it. It was unlucky for both, that he could never un- derstand a joke. Notwithstanding, as Walter had said of Rosamond, she was "a pretty determined person." She determined to treat her betrothed with respect, and henceforth did so. She had too much respect, for her- self at any rate, ever deliberately to show him up be- fore any one, and especially before her sister. There was a strange semblance of illusion about the courtship, which blunted much of the pain of it to Agnes. It appeared to her as if she was dreaming it all, or seeing Rosamond act a charade, without know- ing the answer. At the same time there was present discomfort and annoyance enough to keep her from dreading the end as she otherwise would have done. Single mortified her in many small ways; while ill- bred people would set fib-traps for her by asking her how she liked her new brother, which seemed to her about as pertinent an inquiry as, What is your   AGNES WEANTWORTH'       213 opinion of your father?-or your sister? Single was too conspicuous for good taste in his equipages. He prided himself on speaking with snobbish arrogance to his groom. He kept the man in livery;-and repub- lican Agnes could not bear such a dress on any country- man of hers, particularly at a time when army-blue seemed the only wear for a true-hearted, able-bodied young American.-And when he walked with Rosa- mond in Beacon Street, he had his idle horses paraded beside him in their blankets, as if to publish his selfish- ness to the whole town, while there were sick and wounded soldiers in it to whom a drive might have given more of the breath of life. The wedding was over in a few weeks. What was there to wait for? There was no hope of Rosamond's abandoning her purpose; and she was dead to her family already. Walter's sister and his friend were made,-if not one,-man and wife in the church where he was buried. At some of the saddest funerals that take place, it is not the Burial, but the Marriage, Ser- vice that is read. Agnes wept, but still as if in -her sleep. The white bridal dress made her think of the shroud; but the only realities to her were Walter's death, Ernest's love, and the war.  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7379-00000109"/> 214      A GNES WEANTWTIVORTH. CHAPTER XXIX. INTO the work now-the woman's work-of the war, Agnes threw herself with eager devotion. While thus occupied, she felt herself again at Vernon's side. Several times, he told her, he saw her handwriting in the superscription of comforts furnished for the use of his patients by the Sanitary Commission; and to him too it appeared as if she was there helping him, in visible presence. He was soon able to assure her, that he was "in the line of promotion." At first he received, for his " war- chariot," only an old omnibus. This he had supplied with springs and stores, horses, and outriders with weapons and saddle-bags. After the first ensuing engagement, there was no difficulty about his obtaining a train of ambulances. He always found time to write to her every few days, even if it was only in pencil as he rode to the front; but it was some time before she could obtain many anecdotes of himself. He told her about everything and everybody else. At last, however, a young lieutenant,--a partner of hers in the days when she danced; how long ago that seemed!--who was at home on sick leave, called on her one evening and gave her the particulars of his escape. He was shot in the leg at the battle of New- beru, and unable to keep up with his regiment. His wound bled enough to make him thirsty and faint;   AGNES WENT WORTH.       215 and the night bade fair to be an unusually sharp one for the place awd season. After lying six hours, as it began to grow dark there was a cry from one of the wounded near him, "they are coming for us." He started up on his elbow, and saw ten or twelve men who forthwith began to help themselves to boots, great-coats, canteens, and money. He expostulated; and one or two of his Celtic comrades cried; for in their condition such warmth as they could keep in themselves was a matter of life and death; and it was agony to them to be roughly handled. "You keep cool, Yanks," said one of the " gray-backs," "Thar's a party on us close by, pickin' up stragglers. They'll take car' on yer, never fear." Lieutenant B * * * thought of Andersonville and Libby. In a minute more, he heard the trampling of galloping horses. He determined to shut his eyes, stretch himself out stiff, hold his breath, trust to his coldness to make him seem dead, and to be buried alive in the earth, if it came to that, rather than in one of the rebel prisons. But just then there came a shout from the plunderers: "Look out!-Yanks!" and once more he had to start up for a look. By the level light of the just risen moon, he saw the train rushing down. It was led on by a tall, slight, picturesque figure of a man, sword in hand, on a huge, fiery, dark horse followed by some half- dozen outriders, also well armed and mounted. There were about five minutes of as desperate hand-to-hand- fighting as Lieutenant B * * * had ever seen; and then the rebels took flight, leaving one dead and another, groaning with a terrible sabre-cut, to be lifted in the- arms of the commander of the ambulance party and  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7379-00000110"/> 216     AGNES WENTWORTI. driven off with the rest of his patients. "I declare to you," exclaimed the young officer, "the revulsion of feeling was so tremendous that-I was as weak, you know, as a baby-I came pretty near bursting into tears myself then, though not before." Agnes's eyes were full. "Did you hear the com- mander's name?" asked she shyly. "Oh, yes,-I got quite acquainted with him in the course of the night,-Vernon, a loyal South Caro- linian, rara avis in terris! -a fine fellow every way and worthy of a better place. He seemed like a man who had seen better days. I shouldn't be here now, if he hadn't been there then. Some of those ambulance men, they say, are death to their passengers; but he handled me like a woman, bound up my wound, and fed me with about a quart of beef-juice and brandy." Vernon received a minute account of this little ad- venture in Agnes's next letter. It concluded with an admonishment that if he would be " non-committal " she should be obliged to keep him henceforward under a rigid system of espionage, but, as that might be troublesome to both parties, she should prefer to hear of his doings from his own confession; "Dearest Ernest," pleaded she, "the present is all that we can call our own. Do not keep it from me; do not imagine me too cowardly to share it with you. I know in general that you must be in danger; I did know it, you remember, when I let you go. Do not try to hide the particulars from me; I should only fancy them more dreadful than they are." From  that time he kept a full journal for her, and sent it to her every week; but the journal again she   AGNES tWENTWORTH. 'I     217 is strangely unwilling to show.

Vernon followed hard on the track of Battle. He sought the living among- the dead, under sun, moon, stars, and storms, under cover and under fire. He dried and warmed himself and his imen, and received food in charity, at negro-cabins hard by deserted and dis- mantled mansions which, glittering with lights and beauty and resounding with music, had welcomed him in his boyhood among their chosen guests. He found forsaken, swooning and starving, with grass in his mouth, a mangled young Confederate who, when brought into the light of the hospital fire, startled him with the wasted yet familiar lineaments of his own race; and he had barely time to discover himself to- the poor-youth,-his mother's sister's son,-before he died. He ate and sang one day with gay young offi- cers, whose dying groans he answered, or whose life- less forms he found, on the next. The earthquake of the war had shaken him suddenly out of an inactive, isolated, ideal existence into the harshest contact with the roughest realities that mortal man can know. 19  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7379-00000111"/> 218   .  AGNES WENTWORTH. CHAPTER    XXX. MEANTIME Agnes saw nothing and heard little of Rosamond until, in the June following the marriage, an invitation came from her, for Agnes, to Tusculum. "Do you wish to go, Agnes?" said old Mr. Went- worth. "I can hardly say I do, papa." "Do not go then, my dear; neither do I wish to have you. Write, and tell them so." "Could I quite do that?-it is their first invitation." "Well-perhaps not. It may be more proper to go for once. But after that,-if you do not enjoy your- self,-tell them,-use my name if you like,-tell them I cannot spare you. Tell Mr. Single, I have divided with him already and, if he has one of my girls, it is but fair that he should leave me the other in undis- turbed possession. Let me keep you till Ernest Ver- non takes you, Agnes." "Ob, papa, that is far enough away. We will not talk yet about anything of that sort." Poor Agnes! It seemed to her sometimes, that it would be unfeeling and unnatural ever to talk of it. Within ten months, Mr. Wentworth had grown ten years older. He was not only sadder, but milder and fonder. There was something very touching in the change.  The stern, dry, self-reliant man began to cling to his daughter and to show that he did so. How could she ever leave him alone under a childless roof?   AGNES ]WENT WORTI.       219 How the law of compensation runs into everything! Few women probably love, and very few certainly are ever beloved, like Agnes Wentworth; but how few loving and beloved women have so much as she had to sadden their affection and to darken its hopes I "Ah, it was not for nothing," so she often said to herself, "that fire from heaven signed the hand which I would give to Ernest, with the cross." To return: she did not much enjoy herself at Tus- culum. Rosamond received her most affectionately, and Single with evident satisfaction; and the place was lovely; but when she arrived it was full of gay visitors. Single chose to give afete every month or two. He liked to read in his newspaper, as often as that, that "all that was most brilliant in our metropolis and the environs, in beauty, fashion, literature, and science, was sumptuously entertained on the first inst. at Tus- culum, the elegant villa of Horace Single, Esq.;" (at other times he usually preferred to be quite alone, in order to make preparation for the immortal history, which he was impatient to write, of the Lugdunensian Gauls.) What " was most brilliant in beauty and fashion"' usually happened to fall to Rosamond's share on these occasions,-often for two or three days at a time,--and sometimes happened to be by no means the most brilliant in anything else. Wearily jaded and bored she looked; and Agnes, ill as the scene accorded with her situation and feelings, was glad that Single had chosen that occasion for the time of her visit, and glad also of all her acquired savoir-faire; as it enabled her to take a part of the burden from her sister.  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7379-00000112"/> 220     A GNS FWENTWORTH. Even after the company had dispersed, Rosamond did not appear to be in her usual spirits. Quite un- able to conceal her depression, she owned at length that the country did ldepress her miserably. She had never tried it before, except now and then for a few days in sumcmer, as an enlivening change when she was in high health and in the midst of chosen companions, and when accordingly she had found it enchanting and flattered herself that she had a genuine vocation for it. She had been brought to it this year at the beginning of Lent when, in its threadbare dinginess, it looked to her "in sackcloth and ashes." (In fact, though this she hardly owned till afterward, she was sorely disap- pointed and disgusted to find Tusculum, though so much nearer, less like New York than even Boston was. ) She co0nplained of nothing else; but Agnes, disposed as she always was to seek the things that make for peace, could sometimes scarcely help complaining for her. Rosamond lived like a guest in her own home, except that she was treated by her husband with less observance than if she had been a guest. She had no place, and hardly anything, that she could call her own. She could not even have Agnes to work with her upon her wardrobe in her chamber; because Mr. Single would at any time bolt in without knocking. It seemed never to occur to him, that she had any rights which a  married man was bound to respect. Considering especially that, with all pomp and circum- stance, he with all his worldly goods had her endowed, it did look rather odd that he should consult her about the disposal of none of them,-not even about the   AGNES -WENTWORTH.       221 arrangement of the flower-garden. At any whim of his own, or random suggestion of a slight acquaintance, green-houses, grounds, or shrubberies would be re- modelled; and the first she knew of it might be, her seeking some pretty nook to which she was beginning to take a fancy, and finding it demolished. Even when he bethought himself of being kind, he was clumsy. "Rosamond," said he, on sitting down to dinner one day, "I made a great bargain for you this morning." "You are very good, my dear. What have you been doin?9" "Selling your horse and buying you a pair of ponies for a phaeton." "Selling my horse!" cried Rosamond, half rising from her chair,--"Is he gone?" "Down the river by this time. You have quite given up riding, you know; and he was only eating his head off." The color which had flushed over Rosamond's pale face, left it paler than before. She said nothing fur- ther, but was still more dejected than usual all the rest of the day. The horse was a remarkably pretty, spirited, and intelligent creature. She had bought it herself, out of a legacy left her by Mrs. Van Roose- landt, and had whiled away some languid and lonely hours in teaching it to love her. It would run to her at her call in its paddock, and follow her like a dog; and when she could no longer use it she had meant it, --in fulfilment of her old promise,-for Agnes. Most of which facts Mr. Single did not know, to be sure; but then, if he did not know what he was about, could 19*  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7379-00000113"/> 222      AGNES WENTWORTI. he not ask? The idea, that he had been meddling with what did not belong to him, never came into his head. Moreover, his real solicitude about her health took the form of debarring her from the fresh air and exer- cise which her constitution and condition required; and, in all these and other various cases, either she wanted spirits to remonstrate, or else her mouth was shut by something of the sullenness natural to a high- strung and high-spirited person brought helplessly un- der the power of another, and thwarted, for the first time. Rosamond never knew or dreamed of the amount of pride in her, till Single's unconscious tyranny brought it toward the surface; but now it sometimes rose within till it frightened her, for, accord- ing to her light, she did mean to be a good wife. She hoped the new feeling was but a symptom of a new state of health, and tried to divert her mind from re- sentment and rebellion by being as extravagant as she could; as Pascal's Jesuits recommended to their dis- ciples to appease themselves through their fasts by drinking wine. But though her regular allowance of pocket-money was liberal, and she had more when- ever she could bring herself to ask for more, she could not so much as dress to please herself. Rosamond's taste was that of Polonius; "Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not expressed in fancy; rich not gaudy." But Mr. Single chose that his "wife should at all times, and in all places, alike be known, by her attire, for a lady;" and his idea of a ladv involved that of a much bedizened she   A-GNES WENT WORTI.      223 Now means are a very pleasant thing to have, no doubt, when they are means to any end one likes. But money will not always buy what the owner would like; and, when that is the case, where is the pleasure in having money? Single urged Agnes to prolong her visit. Rosamond did not: "It makes me all the duller, darling, to think how dull you must find it here." "Oh, Rosy, you know I never yet complained of dul- ness anywhere with you; and, if you were only well, I should think your dislike of this lovely country quite comical enough to amuse anybody; but there is papa.." "I know. He has been very good to let me have you at all. But now, if I am good enough to give you back again, he must spare you once more next winter. If all goes well, I want to take you to Washington for, a fortnight and show you to Ernest. He could cer- tainly spare a few days, by that time, to recruit him- self."  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7379-00000114"/> 224     A GNE'S ENT FTWORTIt. CHAPTER XXXI. ACCORDINGLY, toward Christmas Agnes was for the second time summoned to Tusculum, to make acquaint- ance with a little niece and to start for her tryst with Mr. and Mrs Single. Rosamond had had rather a serious illness; and her physician recommended change. "Wasn't it very nice in him, and very fortunate for me?" said the patient, shaking her curls with something of her old glee. "'Fortunate'!-which?"--said Agnes teasing her, "the baby or the fever?" "The fever; if it had been the plague I should have hailed it with hosannas. I am to spend the summer- perhaps all the summers-at Newport, besides going to Washington now." "But what shall you do with the baby?-Why, baby, must you go so soon? Aunt Agnes wants you." "Let her stay till we ring then, Nurse," said Rosa- mond to the Erse young person who had come, bloom- ing and grinning, in to resume her charge. "Poor little thing, I'm glad if Aunt Agnes does want you; for I'm afraid you are not much wanted by anybody else." "Why, Rosamond, what a sentiment!" "I am not the most cruel of mothers, my dear. On the contrary, I believe I ani less unfeeling than most of them; for they think only of having a new live doll to dress and dandle; and I look forward, and ask myself   A GNES WEVNTWORTH.       225 what there is in store for it, if it lives to grow -up. I think there are too many poor little girls in the world already, for their own good; and Mr. Single wanted a son and heir; that's all. The nurse is so faithful that I have no trouble with the poor little creature; and I really like it better than I should ever have supposed I could."' "But what shall you do with it when we go?" "I shall leave it here of course, you inexperienced miss. It is too young to begin its wanderings; and besides Mr. Single would as soon travel with a young gorilla." It was not for Agnes to advise; but, inexperienced though she was in the care of infancy, if it had not been for Ernest she would gladly have offered to stay with her favorite sister's child herself, rather than leave it to unproved hirelings. She did not think Mr. Single took the wisest course to increase its mamma's devotion to it. At dinner, that day, there was a distinguished savant whom Rosa- mond had known very well in old times. Rosamond joined in the general conversation with unusual interest and much of her former gaiety and brilliancy. The guest seconded her with evident enjoyment. But, as often as Single could get the word, he pertinaciously dragged them back to what he supposed to be " ladies' topics." Then, wearying of these himself, he made Rosamond an early sign to leave the table; and, on her failing to notice him, said point-blank, "My dear, hadn't you better go above stairs now, and play with the baby?" Rosamond went; but she did not play with the  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7379-00000115"/> 226     AGN'ES WENTWORTII. baby. She only sank down as if from habit on a lounge in a bay-window, with her chin in her hands and her elbows on the cushions, and looking wearily and drear- ily down the long river said, "How thankful I am we are going to Washington!"It was sad to see how little pleasure she found in her home. Washington made amends to Agnes for much if not all. Vernon was there to meet her,--meet her for the first time for long, dangerous, lonely months,-those dreadful months of the war. In view of the exposures which he was undergoing, he had previously trained ole of his men, a fine, athletic, brave, intelligent New Hanlpshire countrvyman to supply his place upon occa- sion, and had now left this man in charge. It was de- lightful to Agnes with her generous, theoretical, repub- lican faith in human nature, to hear how her lately ex- clusive recluse talked of some of his unpolished and un- educated patients and followers: "Omniumn gatherumn, said he,-"some of them backwoodsmen, adventurers, city roughs,--some of the best of them farmers and mechanics;-if-I had seen them  before the war, I might have coolly set them down as fit for nothing higher than the merest dollar- hunting; and now, if we ever have time again for story- telling, what stories I shall have to tell you,--besides all that I have written you,--of their nobleness in doing and suffering! Depend upon it, every new soul that comes into this world must be like a new substance brought into a laboratory; you must see it put to test after test before you can have any idea of all there is in it." The hearer thought this eminently true of the speaker.   A GNES 'WENTWOR TH.       227 How changed he was, and how developed and elevated! A shade of gravity overhung him constantly as that of a man living in the shadow of Death,-the death of others if not his own; but in that shadow how firm, composed, and confident he was!--calmer,-perhaps really happier, Agnes thought,--than she had ever seen him before. Walking in the path which he be- lieved to be that of his duty, he reminded her, she told him the first time that they Were alone together, of that glorious soliloquy of "Ion": YVain regret! The pathway of my duty lies. in sunlight, And I would tread it with as firm a step, Though it should terminate in cold oblivion, As if Elysian pleasures at its close Gleamed palpable to sight as things of earth." "What if the path should end in leading me into a light brighter than the sun?" said he with his gravely bright smile. "Oh, Ernest, is it possible?" "Sometimes,--often lately,-I hope that it is so. I hope that this," said he, drawing from his pocket a thin black volume, "may prove the key of the lock that has all my life been too hard for me to turn.  It was given me as a keepsake by a soldier from St. Louis; -he died a hard death, but a wonderfully firm one, under my care;--'Lectures on Christianity' by his own clergyman at home.

But then the trinitarian theories of my mother appeared to me contrary not only to our reason,-and I take our reason to be made in the likeness of God's, -but contrary to Christ's own teachings. If he was himself in reality the one supreme God, I cannot understand to whom he prayed; and when he says, 'In that day ye shall ask me nothing,' I dare not pray to him. This book looks to me as if it might point out a middle ground, not to be assailed from any other tenable ground, which a reverent and rational man may take and may hold, in peace and security. But I cannot tell yet. I have read; I shall digest whien I can. Meantime I don't want the book to be lost; and it will be if it tries to stay with me. Could you take care of it for me?" "Yes, indeed.  That I will." "You may read it too, if you will; and-not if vou won't." Single now came in, followed by Rosamond who tried, but in vain, to get him out again. It had been necessary to let him partly into the secret of the mutual understanding between Vernon and Agnes,- their only confidant except Clara Arden, who had had in a general way a kindness for Vernon from the time of her procuring him his consulate in Italy.-He thought that, considering her sister's position and the   AGNES WENT WORTH.       229 present position of her lover, " she might have looked higher." Still he liked Agnes and was determined to play toward her the part of a good brother-in-law. Ac- cordingly he had promptly forgiven Vernon for being provoked by him, and lost no opportunity of proving the sincerity of their reconciliation by seeking his com- pany, and assuring him of the great mistake he was making in serving, if at all, in so humble a capacity. Single put all his " influence with the New York dele- gation in Congress" at Vernon's disposal, to procure him "a commission worthy of his connections." Not- withstanding, Vernon, like a sensible man, having found a niche that fitted him declined to play the always hazardous game of "Puss-in-the-Corner."- The tests of personal prosperity and national calam- ity were not bringing much good out of Single. He groaned over his taxes and over every success gained by the Government; until again, except for Agnes's sake, Vernon could scarcely have borne him. "Every man to his nmetier, he admonished Vernon on the present occasion. (Is it riot a benevolent pro- vision of Nature that those counsellors whose advice is worth the least are wont to be the most lavish in giving it, so as to make up in quantity f6r what is wanting in quality?) "What is any patriot's metier more truly than the service of his country?" rejoined Vernon patiently. "Service of a pack of upstart Northern demagogues!" -(" against the gentry of your whole section of the country," Single came near adding, but rightly decided that he had better not.) "My dear fellow, that's very fine in theory; but now suppose you drive an ambu- 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7379-00000117"/> 230      A GNES WENTWORTH. lance down to the Rapidan and pick up John 3mith, -what thanks do you get?" "The thanks of Mrs. John Smith,' replied Vernon, doing his best to answer a fool according to his folly. "Well; much good may they do you; but couldn't Jack Robinson pick up John Smith just as well?" "Perhaps he could; but if he was a ' coper-head,' -I beg pardon, a 'peace-democrat,'-I'm afraid he wouldn't. " "Well, suppose he didn't; who cares?" "You would care," said Vernon fixing his eyes upon him, "if you saw what I have seen,-disabled mlen with their bones through their skin firom famine." "Good heavens! I didn't mean anything of that sort, you know, " cried the horror-struck Single, himself as kind-hearted a man as a man utterly without inlagina- tion can well be; " there take that, do, and buy some- thing good with it for the poor beggars;" and he thrust a bank bill into Vernon's lland. "But what I did intend to say was just this : you run these risks in order to do what any capable menial could do just as well as you; you probably disable, sooner or later, your brains, eyes, or right hand even; and then wh^.t gets your fame as an artist?" "What would get it in any case, I imagine,- Lethe."' "You don't mean that you've abandoned the idea of achieving anything that will last?" "On the contrary, I am more than ever bent upon things that will last,' said Vernon with a smile of in- telligence at Agnes's sympathizing face; and then, to the relief of both of them, Single was called away to'   A GNES WENITWORTH.        231 look at a blood-horse; when Rosamond for once begged leave to accompany him. "You have not lost your interest in painting though, have -you, Ernest?" asked Agnes rather anxiously, when they were alone. "On the contrary again; it is accumulating with every day of fasting from oils and easels. My interest in being praised for my painting must be on the wane, however; or I must be a fool of incurable folly. Do you remember that passage in Dante's Purgatory, Agnes, that you asked me to explain to you, the last time but one that I was in Boston?-' 'Non e il mondan rumore altro che un fiato Di vento, ch'or vien quinci ed or vien quindi, E muta nome, perchU muta lato. Che fama avrai tu piu, se vecchia scindi Da te la carne, cthe se fossi morto Innanzi che lasciassi il pappo e il dindi, Pria che passin mill'anni? ch'e pii corto Spazio all' eterno, the un mover di ciglia Al cerchio tche piA tardi in cielo e torto.'" Agnes's eyes shone till Vernon called her Beatrice, and added, "You understood it already at heart, I suspect, better than I. But it is one thing, I find, to theorize upon such truths apart from real life, and quite another to have them driven in to one's very soul by things one sees and feels." "Such as?" "As this: a few months ago, young Captain J * * *, of the -th New York, entertained me at his mess. We were all in good spirits; and after dinner he mnade a speech complimentary to me. People always think  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7379-00000118"/> 232     AGNES WENTTWORTH. their own eulogists eloquent, I suppose; and therefore I will not say that he was so, but only that his other hearers behaved as if they thought him so. Several of them were fellows of influence and fortune; and I went back to my tent, I own, feeling as if my reputa- tion was made. The next day the regiment went into action and was terribly handled by Stonewall Jackson. Most of our little party were killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. After a search the next night, with lanterns, over the field for hours, corpse by corpse, I found poor J * * * 's, so disfigured that I recognized it only by an antique ring I had noticed on his finger, as it rested on the table beside me while he was speaking. My panegyrist was gone as utterly as if he had fallen in the Trojan war." "Ah," thought Agnes, "you turn the conversation easily enough from yourself to another; and you ex- plain how you can forego the admiration of your fellow- mortals; but you do not suggest what a blank the rest of your own mortal life will be to you, if this horrid war disables you for your art. I wish Mr. Single had been as forbearing." Meaning to imitate Vernon's forbearance, she did not speak her thought; but un- consciously she looked at him so pitifully that he answered as if he read it: "We won't be sorry for anything, dearest, before it has happened; and, at any rate, lejeu vaut la chandelle. Now you will tell me about yourself, and what you are doing at home from  morning till night, so that every time I look at my watch it will be like looking into a magic mirror to see you, at work or at rest." But by the very intelligence of his questions Vernon presently   A GNES WENTWORTH.       233 showed, that he knew more about Agnes, hundreds of miles away, than- Single did about Rosamond under his own roof. Entering into all Agnes's feelings as readily as he imparted to her his own, Ernest speedily dissipated any undefined dread which, since she had seen it at a nearer view, she had begun to entertain of matrimony. And when in a few--how miserably few!-days they had to separate once more and re- turn to work, in common yet apart, she bade hini good- bye, recognizing that she had in him more to reverence, trust, and love, and for herself more alike to hope and fear, than she had ever known before. CI HAPTER XXXII- THE next summer, Rosamond insisted upon Agnes's coming to her at Newport; and she did so for a week, longing and almost hoping to satisfy herself that Mrs. Single was really well and happy. Her letters had been uniformly uncomplaining and generally lively; but Agnes knew that, however matters might be, Rosa- mond had too much spirit to bemoan herself delib- erately on paper. Single had hired an expensive cot- tage for her; "And the Van Rooselandts are here too, you know," said she; "so it is something like old times,-as much like them as anything can be now." "Why, my poor Rosy, that sounds as if you were not feeling well." "I am not; I never expect to be again." 20*  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7379-00000119"/> 234     AGNES WrENTWORTIt. "But surely-surely Dr. Mixter does not say so of you."7 "Oh, no; I do not ask him. There is not much the matter. Come, let us take a drive and drive away care; and in the evening, if you are not too tired, we will go to the hotel and look in for an hour or two at the hop." "Shall not you be too tired?" "If I am, I shall go." "But not on my account, I hope." "No, dear, on your fiivolous older sister's account. I can't give up all the enjoyments of life at my age. If I pay the quid pro quo, at least I have a right to the pro quo quid," said Rosamond, laughing at her own Latin. But Agcnes could not laugh. This was the first time that her sister had alluded to the mercenary char- acter of her marriage, since it took place. Agnes had tried, as Rosamond had desired, to forget all that she said at that time. The other crowding interests of the period had made this task of forgetfulness compara- tively easy; and the younger lady almost hoped, against hope, that the young wife and mother herself had ceased to look upon her marriage as a bargain. Probably she would still have exercised too much good taste to speak of it as such, had she not been at this time in pretty bad company, namely that of Mrs. Etta V. R. S * * * and her compeers. Bad company? That is a strong expression I see, as after writing it I read it; and yet I do not see how, by changing it, to make it the truer. I am certain that I should think such company very bad   A G2NES TWENTWORTIL      235 for my young wife-if I had one. Nobody denies that the flock of goats on the left hand of the great Shep- herd will be a bad company, even though we nowhere read that they committed all the seven deadly sins,- though all that we do read about them is, that they did no good and were to be driven away into lasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. This company, however, was not exactly what the polite world calls bad company; or Rosamond would never have brought her young sister near it. The members of it only approached together " the brink of all we hate." If any one was detected going over that brink, the others usually dropped him, or especi- ally her. But, as a company at least, they were not doing good. They were setting an example, to less conspicuous and not less ambitious people, of any amount of selfish and suicidal extravagance and dis- sipation,-if it is dissipation towdissipate health, means, time, and in a word life, in the mere pursuit of pleas- ure. They talked much scandal, hurting alike their neighbors' reputations and their own characters. They envied one another and strove to make one another envious. But Rosamond loved Mrs. Etta S * * *, nee Van Rooselandt, and loved excitement, and for their sake tolerated all the rest Single did not much enjoy it; but he was not keen in reading character, and had besides a general notion that "whatever is [d la mode] is right." After one or two trials, Agnes found that she could not bear it, particularly as there was no reason why she should. It jarred too much on her heart-strings, after reading Ernest's letters and the public bulletins of the  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7379-00000120"/> 236     AGNES IWENT WORTH. war, in the morning and afternoon, to go out in the evening and hear-such talk as she did hear when she went out. She was still in mourning, without and within, for her brother and her country, and in terror for her lover and her country day by day. Rosamond abroad did not need her and, much as Agnes loved her sister's brilliancy and beauty, she could not enjoy such a display of them at such a time. Mrs. Single's jewels and laces looked too inappropriate for becomingness when so many of her countrywomen,-in North, South, East. and West--were in widow's weeds. Rosamond was one of those delightful hostesses who love best to have their guests do what pleases them best, and who let them see that they put no one out by doing it. Therefore she went her way and left Agnes in peace at night, to put the baby to sleep, to write, or to rest, and in the morning to rise whenever she was ready, and breakfast, if she chose, with the forsaken ,Single. "I declare this looks homelike!" cried he, the first time he came in and saw her smiling at him, over the unusually comfortable meal which the cook had pro- vided in her honor. "When I was a bachelor, I used to think it rather jolly to breakfast by myself; but some- how a married man has to give up so much of his in- dependence sooner or later, that he wants a little domestic comfort to comfort him," added he, smiling good-humoredly if somewhat ruefully at his own play upon words, through the steam of the coffee which Agnes had poured out for him in a heated cup, and sugared and creamed, as it proved, exactly to his taste; --"especially," he went on, "in such a  homesick 10   AGNES WENTWORTH.       237 place as Newport. Not but what I am very glad, of course, to let Mrs. Single have what she likes and do as she likes, and be here if her health requires. It would never do to have it said that my wife wasn't happy; and something certainly did seem to be com- ing over her. People were beginning to notice it. She didn't feel her oats at all as she used to;--that is, I meant to say, she was losing her vivacity. But now here am I idling, neglecting my estates, playing bil- liards, and killing time out of the best part of my life; and I intended this very summer to commence my his- tory of the Lugdunensian Gauls. And how could any lady desire more than -she had at Tusculum? Agnes, is not this the exact definition of women: animals delighting in housewifery, finery, and infancy?" ",Of some womnen." "Ha!" cried he, " doesn't it include all,-not you?" "'Delighting in housewifery'?-no, I'm afraid not. 'In finery'?-no. I like your baby." "But don't you think it includes Rosamond then?" "No," repeated Agnes, hardly able to keep her coun- tenance at the impetuous gravity of the question; "I should think not precisely." "Ha!" cried he again, in imitation of Dr. Arnold of Rughy; and he rose, and walked up and down the room with his hands in the pockets of his ornamental trousers. "Now you' have given me a new idea; but I wish you could go a little further and give me some suggestions as to what Rosamond would like,-if any- thing would make her contented at home." "Ah, she should know that best; I can only refer you to her," said Agnes, startled at finding herself so  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7379-00000121"/> 238     A GN'ES IFE ATIVORTH. nearly entrapped into meddlingo with her sister's most private affairs. It was characteristic of Single, that the last person whose opinion he was likely to ask was Rosamond, even about her own affairs; and this not because he thought her opinion likely to be foolish, for he was rather proud of her reputation for clever- ness, but simply because she was his wife. Sympa- thy, cherishing, companionship,-these were the chief things to which Agnes looked to make her more than s contented in the home of Vernon, should it ever be hers; and the words had almost risen to her lips; but supposing she had uttered them, she asked herself afterwards, what then? Could a creature of such dif- ferent mould as Single's ever teach himself to sym- pathize with Rosamond; and how could the compan- ionship of a person naturally so uncongenial as Single ever be made acceptable to Rosamond? Poor Single was in a bad box; and, if it was a still worse box for his wife, there is this to be said for him, that when they got into it his eyes were shut, and hers at least half open. He had no suspicion that it could prove a bad one for either He even intended to secure her happiness in it, so far as he could without making anv sacrifice of his own; and he expected to be able to secure her perfect happiness in it without making any sacrifice of his own. She, on the other hand, partly saw the dangers for herself, and left it to him to look out for himself. Still they now had alike the hard lesson to learn, that the pursuit of self-gratification is no substi- tute for that holy mutual self-devotion which the Chris- tian church guarantees to both parties in wedlock, and   AGNES WENTWORTH.        239 without which marriage is likely to prove a heavy burden, and heaviest to the wife. The more Agnes saw of Single, the more intolerable as a husband did she consider him, but yet the more respectable as a man; for, though in a pretty narrow way, he was a conscientious and sincerely religious man. Agnes was at first alike amused and ashamed, to observe what a point he made of mortifying the flesh, on a Friday, with a particularly rich and high-seasoned dish 'of cusk d la creme, or rather bezirre, and how apt he was to be peevish after it. But she soon began, to suspect, and later was convinced that, though there was a good deal of form about his piety, there was some spirit in it too. The day but one before she was to have returned to her father, she slipped down two of the steps of the piazza at a time, in receiving from the carrier a letter that she saw in Vernon's handwriting; and she sprained her ankle. In order to be able to travel the sooner, she was advised by her surgeon not to attempt for a few days to walk or stand. A fixture thus in Rosamond's drawing-room, she was an unwilling hearer one even- ing of rather an odd conversation. Rosamond had come in, unusually silent, from a twilight drive, rung for her maid to take her hat and shawl, and stretched herself on a sofa as if too much exhausted to talk. But, as she was doing altogether too much for her yet unrecovered strength and the weather was very sultry, Agnes was more sorry than surprised and let her alone, hoping she would sleep. On her husband's entrance, however, she started up with renewed animation: "My dear," said she, "I  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7379-00000122"/> 240      AGNES IVE A-TWORTlt . hope this is is not true, that I have just been hearing about you from Etta S * * *." "I trust," returned Single loftily,-(it was Friday evening,) "that Mrs. S * * * has nothing to com- municate respecting me, which my wife should be sorry to hear.' "She says, that you have suffered yourself to be drawn into some of Mr. Von Wiesel's speculations in government contracts." "'Suffered myself to be drawn in,' my dear, is a rather peculiar mode of expressing it; " "I don't quote her expressions." "Nor do I quite perceive how the substance of those expressions should concern Mrs. S * * *." "Nor do I. On the contrary, it strikes me, Mr. Single, that, if the story is true, your wife should not hear it first from anybody else's wife nor from anybody else but yourself." "Rosamond, you are nervous." "Yes, very; if I were not, this would be enough to make me so." "But why, my dear? - what possible--?" --He checked himself with a glance at Agnes. Sitting in a window and not daring to ask to be wheeled from the room, lest that should look too much like clearing the ring for expected combat, she was talking to the baby in her arms, as fast and as loud as she could. "Don't be uneasy, Agnes," said Rosamond, really too greatly unhinged to recollect herself or her accus- tomed good-breeding; "we are not talking secrets. What Etta knows, Newport knows. ' What possible'   AGNES WENTWORTH.        241 concern was it of mine either, you wished to inquire, I suppose," said she, again facing the adversary. "My dear Rosamond, you are feverish! You are making yourself ill!" exclaimed Single, terrified at her rising color and unprecedented conduct. "I must send for Dr. Mixter.' "Better send for Dr. Ruebrick," said Rosamond; and then as, on his way to the bell, he paused to look at her in fresh horror, fully convinced that her reason was wavering, her sense of the ludicrous happily over- powered her other emotions; she caught him by the arm and cried,-as well as she could for laughter, which he at first took for hysterical,--"No. -Stop. I do know what I am talking about. I beg your par- don. I was -going too far. But do you remember what you said to Dr. Ruebrick,--on the first of Feb- ruary, 1862?" "I really-really cannot recollect," said Single, utterly perplexed and scarcely reassured. "In church;--why, it was our wedding-day, don't you recollect that?-I shall have to send for Dr. Mix- ter for you." "Oh tI-Well?" "What did you say to him, or rather what did he make you say to me, about all your worldly goods?" "My dear, if you are in your senses, you must see that this is going too far. The sacraments of the church are no matter for levity." "I am sure I agree to that," said Rosamond with a sigh. "I mean that I think they are to be taken in earnest; that is all." 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7379-00000123"/> 242     AGNES WEiVT WORTH. "You go too far. Those words are a mere form of course, and universally so understood." "Then I must have been in an error, indeed l" cried Rosaimond waxing warnm again. "I always sup- posed I was bound to obey. I always supposed the makers of the prayer-book were inspired saints; but I cannot see that they were any better than impious hypocrites, if they chose only false and hollow words to put into our mouths at such a time.-Ift-observe, I only say, if," she added, answering less her hus- band's exclamations than Agnes's face of horror. "Take care!" cried Single. "Remember the un- pardonable sin! I never said-you must not say-- that they are false. I said that they were a form,- formal in the letter,-neither false nor hollow, of course, in the spirit." "And their spirit is-what?" "If you desire, I will consider and let you know. In the mean time, I desire that you will let them alone. " Rosamond held her tongue, and bit her lips till the red came through the skin. Single availed himself of the imposed truce, to march up and down the room and endeavor to re-collect his forces; but while he mused the fire burned; and pres- ently it broke out again : "I never heard of such a thing in my life! Suppose I had married an idiot." "I do not see how that supposition applies in the present case," rejoined Rosamond. "Or suppose I had married an idiot." "M y dear," said Single, coming to a halt, " again I request that you will cease to excite yourself.' He resumed his walk and next, in spite of himself, his   AGNES WENTWORTI.       243 soliloquy. "The idea that a man, by marriage, obliges himself to subject his financial concerns to the control of his lady!" Again Mrs. Single was not slow to take up the glove, and to convert the soliloquy into a dialogue: "Control is not what I lay claim to, but merely reason- able consultation. If you had consulted me, I should simply have told you that Mr. Von Wiesel was not to be trusted beyond the nearest corner with anybody's interests but his own. After that I should cheerfully have left you to control your concerns without any assistance, especially his." "Mrs. Single, what can you mean?" cried Sifigle, coming once more to a sudden halt. "What should a young lady, like you, know about business men in their business capacity?" L Only what everybody knows--but you, it appears, --that Mr. Von Wiesel is very keen and is not very scrupulous. He has never forged nor stolen, I believe, -at least, he has never been found out at it." "Rosamond, you astonish me beyond expression  Why have I not always seen you, yourself, ever since we have been here, treat and receive him as an old friend?" "Not at all, guileless sir. Youl have always seen me treat and receive him as an old dancing-partner, and a very good one. You will never, unless by your own commands, see me receive him as my partner in friendship any more than in finance," Single looked dejected and thoughtful. Rosamond, having said her say, said no more to him, but asked Agnes if her arms were not tired with the baby; when  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7379-00000124"/> 244      AGNES WENTWORTH. lie with unusual attention rang the bell for the nurse, and wheeled his sister-in-law's chair to the door of her chamber without bringing her more than once or twice into contact with surrounding objects. Agnes was so bitterly homesick that, as she rested her head against the window-sill, she could scarcely keep back her tears. "Oh, if I ever do get back to papa," she tried to comfort herself by repeating, "I hope I shall never have to come here again!-Rosa- mond is possessed," she went on: "It is more than a year since she was herself; and, till she is, I cannot bear to see her. But when will that be?" In the course of half an hour Rosamond sent Elise, her French maid, with tea, flowers, and Miss Yonge's last novel. In an hour or two she came herself, refreshed by her own tea and toilet; and how like a Peri she looked, in her translucent arsenic green and diamonds, with deadly diamond powder too, twinkling in her hair!"Here I am, in the character of Madame de Brinvilliers. I dare not come near you, darling, for fear I should poison you," cried she, taking her stand in the middle of the chamber and tossing a kiss to Agnes; " but that you may sleep in peace, and I, in such peace as there is for the wicked, I must assure you before I go, that you have seen me for the last time in the character of Mrs. Caudle, and that Mr. Single saw me in it this afternoon for the first time; as you might have perceived by his amazement. He means well. I assure you he is a good husband as husbands go. But if there is such a place as purga- tory, and breaches of the Golden Rule are punished in it, I believe, as sure as there is justice in heaven, that   A OGNES WENTWORTII.      245 all married men will have to do penance there meta- morphosed into married women." There was not much more to be said about the mat- ter on either side. But Agnes remained with an im- pression upoA her mind, that Rosamond had erred, not so much in telling her husband that she was dissatis- fied with his conduct toward her, as in not telling him so sooner. She had kept back the rebuke till it turned sour. Moreover it appeared to Agnes, that ,Single might reasonably complain of a breach of the Golden Rule on Rosamond's part toward him, in the habitual, brooding, chill reserve which, armadillo as he was, had finally penetrated him with a sense of her constant, unac ountable, unalterable discontent. CHAPTER    XXXIII. BEFORE Agnes stayed with her sister again, she heard of another little niece and then a nephew. Upon the birth of the latter, Rosamond for once expressed something of the pride and pleasure natural to a young mother. "He is a remarkably fine little fellow," pro- claimed her first note-: "Everybody says so; and his papa is delighted with him. [Did that new delight on Mr. Single's part, explain some of Mrs. Single's new satisfaction? Agnes hoped so.] I long to show him to you, Agnes. [Him;-each of the little sisters had been it.] But if, with such an inducement before you, you are such an unnatural aunt as to put us [us;-it 21*  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7379-00000125"/> 246     A GNES WENTWIORTIL. used to be me ;] off this year with one only of your little pitiful visits, make it when you please. As the youth is very young for a traveller, we shall postpone going to the sea-shore so long this season, that I stipulate for a late return to the North River. You would find Newport quieter in the autumn than the summer; and the boy is better worth seeing every day. When you come, I depend upon your sketching him for me instead of knit- ting. I will make amends to your patriotic avarice with specie enough to buy bales of soldiers' socks." Agnes was glad to defer her visit. Rosamond's constitutional vivacity always came out in her letters; so that, as we have hinted, they were scarcely a. trust- worthy index of her state of mind. As she never stated anything that was not true however, it was certain that she was, at last, pleased with her baby. But it was not equally certain that she was yet, on the whole, con- tented with her lot or with her husband; and still, if the conjecture was an illusion, it was so pleasing an illusion that Agnes was in no haste to put it to the test. Her father was even less in haste to have her do so. As the time finally drew near, he owned to her, trying to laugh at himself, that the idea of her forsaking him, so often, turned him into an old woman and a prophetess: "Mark my words, my dear; you will sprain your ankle again, or lose your baggage, or roll down an embank- ment with a whole train of cars at your heels; and then what will your Mr. Vernon say to me? You had bet- ter just sit down here at mv table, and write these monopolizing persons one of your pretty notes,--if you leave off those new-fangled tails to your ys, perhaps they will be able to read it.-Tell them your old father   AGNES WENTWORTII.       247 can't spare you, but that they are nomadic people, and it can't make much difference to them which way they go, provided only they are on the road with everything they want safe in trunks where they can't get at it. Tell them Boston is the worst place in the world to leave, and the best place to come to, and so they had better let you be here, and come and stay here with you, and let me see that grandson." Agnes did gladly sit down and write her pretty note accordingly; but it was answered by a few scrawled lines, strangely few and simple, and very sad, from Single. "My good, kind sister," he wrote, "if you can come to poor Rosamond at once, I am sure you will, when you hear that we have lost our little son by a terrible accident. You can comfort her better than I." As Agnes's hackney-coach stopped at the cottage, Single came out to receive her, -eagerly but with none of his former flourish of manner. His head was bowed, as if either to shun the light or to keep her from seeing, that his eyes looked as if he had cried them almost out. "Will you come with me into the drawing-room a mo- ment?" asked he in a subdued tone. "Dr. Mixter is having a few last words with me; and it may be well for you to hear them?" "Oh, is Rosamond ill?" "Yes, dreadfully." "But oh, not dangerously?" "He tries to make me think not. But--"He gave Agnes his arm and led her in, hurriedly yet with an unskilful effort to make no noise, which contrasted strongly with his usual loud disregard of his wife's re-  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7379-00000126"/> 248      A NXES tVEiVTW'ORTIl. pose. "Miss Wentworth,-her sister,"-said he to the physician. "Mrs. Singrle might probably be impa- tient to see her, if informed of her arrival. I suppose it will be safest to wait till to-morrow." "By no means. Let Miss Wentworth see her as soon as she pleases, and unannounced." "But if she wishes to refer to the calamity,  then-" "Then by all means let her," said the Doctor, pull- ing out his watch. ( My dear sir, I have no time to tell you the why nor the wherefore. In one word, we have to suit the treatment to the case. In the present case, I repeat to you, the more natural the conduct of everybody around the patient is, the sooner she will probably return to her own natural state. The most serious part of her disorder is grief. Let grief have its way, and it is usually a self-limited disorder. Try to cut it short, and you never know what you may be doing.  I shall call twice a day for the present, and watch your wife most carefully; and, if danger arises, be assured you shall know it." A little reassured, Agnes hastened toward Rosa- mond's chamber, while Single followed the Doctor out, perhaps to expostulate with him. Rosamond's door stood ajar. Agnes heard within a low sound of cry- ing,-that of her eldest niece, she supposed,--mingled with a laboriously lively chattering like that of a nurse trying to divert a child. According to directions, she pushed the door open and was walking quietly in, when in spite of herself she stopped short and stood aghast; for the crying was Rosamond's, and the chattering that of her maid, who sat beside her and wiped her eyes, as   A GNES W}ENTWORTH.       249 she lay in bed passive and regardless of everything ex- cept her own misery. "Oh, Miss Wentwort," exclaimed Elise, rising, "you must not come here Il  Agnes, however, stood her ground, and again ad- vanced; while Rosamond looked rounnd, took her hand- kerchief firom the servant and covered her white swollen face with one hand, put out the other slowly for her sister, and stammered with a manifest struggle for self-recollection and self-restraint, "Go down, Elise. Oh, Agny,--stay with me;-and keep-them all-away-!" Agnes calmly dismissed the maid, desiring her to go and tell her master that she herself would stay by Mrs. Single for the present. Then she -sat down by the bedside and, still holding the poor burning hand in both of hers, pressed it to her bosom and softly wept over it. As her tears fell, Rosamond's abated. "MVy little boys!--mly little boysI--" she twice began to say, with an appealing, piteous look, to her sister; but find- ing herself each time checked by uncontrollable sobs, she changed it into, "I am--too tired.-If you--lay down--with me,-and took me-in your arms,--per- haps-I could rest.-Keep them all-away 1" Agnes rang the bell, gave orders that no one should come to the door again till summoned,-as Mrs. Single was going to sleep,-locked it, laid the key in Rosa- mond's sight upon a table, and stretched herself beside her. Rosamond smiled faintly, nestled toward her, slept some time, and awoke comparatively composed and evidently desirous to maintain her self-control before  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7379-00000127"/> 2O50     AGN'ES WENTIVORTII. her sister. She made no attempt to recur to any agita- ting subject, nor any objection to Agnes's unfastening the door, and wras concerned to find that she had had no refreshments since her journey. It was several days before Rosamond quite broke down again; but it was the first time that she trusted herself again to try to tell Agnes the story of her ill- ness, and her sorrow. This was much as follows, only more interrupted: "Oh my little Horace! my little angel!-my little victim! Oh, Agnes, you never saw him! He was more like you than like anybody else; but oh, he had a look in his sweet little face such as never was in any other face but a seraph's; and if he had not had an unnatural mother, we should have had him now! He had a new nurse. She brought me a good recommendation from her last mistress, Mrs. L * * *; I had known her ever since we first came to Newport, and thought her a friend.--The girl was pretty and playful with the darling. He liked her; and so I felt safe. I felt well then,--better than for years,-and starving for a little pleasure while I could really enjoy it. The night be- fore, I was out late ; and the day-that day-I over- slept myself and hadn't time to kiss him. I was going out with a yachting-party. He saw me running by his nursery-door, and put out his hands.-He had the very prettiest way of throwing up his hands when he wanted you to take him,--everybody noticed it; it was just like the fluttering of a little bird that wants to fly. But I hurried off for fear that, if I held him for a min- ute, he would cry for me. When I came back at twi- light meaning, to make up for it, there were two chaises   AG NES WENTWORTH.       251 -doctors' chaises,-at the door; and I heard screams -his screams. I flew up to the nursery. His father met me and told me not to go in; but I did, and caught him in my arms from the surgeons. He did not want me any more; even his mother hurt him then; and I had to lay him down. His nurse had left him in his little waggon by the side of the road. She often left him so,-the other nurses told when it was too late,- and let him cry.--My darling to cry, and his mother not help him!-A loose horse came rushing along and trampled him. His little praying hands were trampled, too. He screamed and gasped and sobbed, till they told me it was nothing but cruelty to let him suffei any more; and they gave him opium; and then he. screamed himself to sleep and slept himself to death. While I was standing over him I was taken ill; and sG 1 lost the other little boy I might have had to make some amends to his father, if not comfort me. Oh, little Horace would have loved it so, and played with it and been so happy I I have had a letter since from Baltimore,--" rambled on poor Rosamond,--"a letter from the wicked woman who sent that nurse to me. She wants me to forgive her,--as if I ever could I She wished to get rid of the girl herself, because she flirted with her brother. She thought it might be most his fault, and the girl might be steady enough out of the reach of temptation; and she wanted to get rid of hei peaceably; and so my little Horace was the victim-; and I have broken my marriage-vow and disobeyed my husband, and killed one of my own children my- self; and how Ernest can possibly allow you to asso. ciate with such a bad woman, is more than I can un  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7379-00000128"/> 252     AGNE'S WENTWORTH. derstand. But I know my mind is very much broken. Before you came, Mr. Single and Elise both treated me as if I was insane; and I dare say it is-all an illu- sion of mine that Ernest was a very mindful lover. But if I have one ray of reason left, I can tell you this: Bad company is a bad thing for anybody; you may think you can keep it and keep clear of the con- sequences; but you can't i and so, on your own account, I advise you not to have too much to do with me." "My dear Rosamond, you will break my heart if you call up such dreadful ideas. They say that, owing to poor mamma's constitution, we are both of us likely to be a little 'nervous,' now and then, if we are ill; but Ernest scarcely needs to remember how- good you were to me when I was fanciful, to be eager to have me do my little utmost for you. And Dr. Mixter told Mr. Single only yesterday, that it would be the greatest mistake to lead you to imagine that your brain was 'not as sound as a nut.' As for Mr. Single, I believe there is nobody in the world more full of pity and sorrow for you; I believe that blaming you is the last thought in his mind." "That only shows, then, how much too good he is for me." "Or how much better than ever you are going to be to him." "No; I can't. The thing is impossible. I've tried, -nobody ever tried harder than I,-to be a good wife; and you see what it has all come to, and what it has brought me to. Three or four years ago, I was a free, vigorous, intelligent, honorable human being. If I made a resolution or a promise, I kept it;--I could keep   A GNES WENT WORTH.       253 it. Now, you see, I am a broken-spirited, imbecile, lying slave. I never ought-I never meant--to say what I am saying now; and yet here I am saying it. You warned me, Agnes; and I ought to have listened. Now be warned by ne: -There is no slavery like a wife's slavery. Other slaves, if they do not like bond- age, can run away; and, if they are caught, they can but be killed, which is by no means always a misfor- tune. But, if you are a wife, there is no escape for you but into the second death. And then to be solemnly bound to love your tyrant!-Oh, my God! What will become of me? What will-become of me?" Agnes recollected at this juncture, that the Doctor had given her leave to be natural. Finding no other reply so natural as kisses and tears, she bestowed both freely upon Rosamond; and Rosamond was again softened and appeased. CHAPTER     XXX-IV.- ANOTHER day, as Agnes sat at work beside her sister, she said, with the piteous look that often seemed to seek for comfort where none was to be found, "If it had been both the little girls, it would not so much have mattered; but little Horace had a chance for happiness,-unless some cruel, heartless, calculating creature married him for his money." "Dear Rosamond, so have your little daughters a 22  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7379-00000129"/> 254     A GNES WENVT WORTH. chance for happiness. God will send it to them, if He sees it to be best for them." "' If they deserve it,' you are too kind to add. But they cannot be better than you are, Agnes." "Ah, you do not know how my will often struggles with the will of heaven!" "For Ernest and Walter,-no wonder; but still you are not happy." "I hardly have time to think whether I am or not; --frankly, no; not while the war lasts nor while you are ill." "Poor child! If I had not grown as selfish toward you as I always was to everybody else, except poor Aunty, I should remember that your own burden was heavy enough of itself." "But if I could only lighten yours, I should feel the stronger to bear mine. At any rate, I am glad to have lived; and so will my dear little nieces be." "If they miss happiness?"5 "If they aim at nobleness," said Agnes, forgetting herself now for the little nieces. "' Nobleness'?-for,women?"' "I think there must always be nobleness within reach, where self-devotion is; and surely self-devotion is within the reach of every one who has a God, a family, and a country." Rosamond feebly shook her head: "You are speak- ing a foreign language to me. You speak it very sweetly; and I suppose I ought to understand it, but I do not." "How long have Mr. Single's eyes troubled him?" asked Agnes after a pause.   AGNES WE-TWORTH.        255 "His eyes? I do not know. I did not know they ever troubled him ;-did I?" "Then I hope it is only some passing thing; but they look a good deal inflamed; and, ever since I have been here, we have had the blinds closed at dinner." "That light dining-room,-with all the sunset glare from the water! There ought to be some blue shades. Oh, I wonder when I shall leave my chamber," said Rosamond, tossing restlessly;-"I wonder when we shall get away from this dreadful place." "I can order the shades for you; shall I?" "Do, dear, this very day; and ring now, will you please?-Elise, tell Mr. Single that I should be glad to speak to him if he is not engaged,-before the Doctor comes." It was the first time since her sister came, that Rosamond had shown any interest in anything or living person else. Single came presently, groping as much as seeing. Agnes rose to leave him her chair by the bed. "Don't go, nurse," said he; and she seated herself again, by the window.   "What did you wish for, my dear?" said he softlyfto Rosamond,-" to tell me  you were feeling a little better to-day?" "I am   going to try to be better, Horace; I have tried everybody's patience quite long enough. But about your eyes, my dear? I am afraid you are suffer- ing, with no one to take care of you i' "Who told you anything about them? I did not mean you should know," cried Single; and Agnes, in the window, shook in her shoes. "Let me see. I am afraid they are only too able to speak for themselves. Don't you remember the old  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7379-00000130"/> 256     AGNES WENTWORTH. song' That Tell-tale Eye'?" returned poor Rosamond's faint voice, trembling with its effort to be playful. "But what is the matter?" "I took cold in them, I dare say; and"- "And you cried, I suppose, for poor little Horace," said Rosamond, heaving up a sigh that seemed to come from below the source of tears. Single mur- mured something which Agnes did not hear. Rosa- mond went on: "'For me'?--O Horace, why should you do that?" "My dear, who could have helped it?"' Ah, you must not do so any more; I am not worth it. Oh, no, nol We will talk of something else. But when the Doctor comes you will see him, I know, to please me, and ask him how soon he can have me well enough to go back to Tusculum. The soft green shade of your groves will be better for us both than all this broad glassy glare, that I never wish to see again.- Stay with us now, cannot you? Turn the easy-chair round with the back to the window, and lean back and shut your poor eyes; and you shall hear how sweetly Agnes reads." Rosamond's constitutional kindness of heart rose fully in the ascendant, assisted by gratitude and re- morse; and poor Single, who had never in all his life been so petted before, was,-after a wretched week or two spent in his idle, lonely room with alternate attempts at reading and consequent pain and fright,-thankful, as he had never imagined he could be, for feminine companionship, care, and kindness; while he felt the unexpected relief that there often is in giving in, when one has already given out.   AGNES WEXNTWIOR TI.     257 But when Dr. Mixter came, he did not afford much added relief. He took Single to another room to ex- amine his eyes, regretted that he had not sought ad- vice earlier, and mentioned one or two palliatives, but ended by refusing to assume the responsibility of the case, and by proposing to bring in consultation a dis- tinguished New York oculist who, by good fortune, was taking a week's vacation at Newport. The oculist came, looked grave in his turn, and recommended that the patient should at once return home where he could be constantly within reach. Single in consternation answered that, in his wife's present state, it was possible neither for her to-travel nor for him to leave her. The oculist therefore consented to give some general directions, and to co-operate with the physician by letter, but added that he agreed "entirely with Dr. Mixter's opinion,"--that the case was "not without danger, nor one to be treated to advantage from a distance." All this Rosamond inquired into, and would know. She besought Single to go without waiting for her; but he could not make up his mind to do this; nor she hers, quite, to drive him to it; for the local treat, ment to be employed was painfill, the regimen de- pressing, and the abstinence from all- use of the eyes complete. There was nothing for her, but to get well herself as fast as she could,-a business that was per- haps not a little forwarded by the new, and outward, direction given to her thoughts; while he was con- stantly making his escape to her, blindfold, from the dark cell in which he was expected to be in solitary 22*  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7379-00000131"/> 2.58     AGNES WENTIrORTII. confinement, and clinging to her presence with a mani- fest fondness and dependence, which appealed to her naturally strong affections as nothing in him had ever done before,-nothing but the recent discovery of his compassion for her suffering, under a trial which he could understand. Agnes was to have stayed to see them and their retinue safe back to the North River; but old Mr. Wentworth had an attack of influenza which hurried the "Sister of Charity," as poor Rosamond called her, back to Boston. She was scarcely more sorry for the cause than for the consequence; but it could not be helped; and Elise was capable, efficient, and a good servant when she had anybody to keep her in her place, which her mistress now did con amore. Mr. Wentworth's illness was not alarming, but con- fined him to his chamber for the unprecedented term of six days, and to the house a week longer. Before that week was over, Agnes had the comfort of receiv- ing a few lines in Rosamond's own hand, inform- ing her that she was leaving Newport,-had reached home. Agnes waited eagerly for further letters. They came duly,-letters not altogether unsatisfactory, char- acteristic in some things, and yet so deeply sad that, without the signature, it would have been hard indeed to recognize them as those of the once playful Rosa- mond: "Dr. Lens gives us encouragement beyond what I dared hope.

The place seems to me, indeed, only like a beautiful cemetery without little Horace; but, till I can be dead, I am best content to be buried alive,-- and to have had my sins go before me to judgment, I sometimes think, if that judgment could but have fallen upon me alone.  *  *   * "The stillness and solitude are rather a refreshment. Since your company and papa's are not to be had, we are best suited for the present with none but our own. My limbs recover strength rather slowly; and Horace carries me out in his arms, every pleasant morning, to the summer-house in the wood; and there I read to him. He says it reminds him of a partnership be- tween a blind man and a lame man, in a little story- book he had when a child, by which remark you may rightly judge that he is beginning to regain his spirits. Poor fellow, he is so good to me I He does know how to return good for evil.--One thing I will tell you, Agnes, because I am sure it will please you.. One day, before we went out, I caught him in the library straining his poor eyes over a book; and when I took it away I found it was the Book of Common Prayer. He had been, I discovered, in the habit of using it every day, from his boyhood up, and could not now do without it. Ever since, I have been his chaplain.

He has grown too fond of our reading in it to give it up, and calls it 'Fair Rosa- mond's Bower.' At first he, considerately and char- acteristically, proposed for my benefit only novels, poetry, and the newspapers; but when he discovered that it would make no difference to me, he relapsed into history and even Latin. I seem to myself some- times to be turning into a specimen of Milton's daugh- ters; but I hardly believe Milton was ever so merciful as Horace is to false quantities. Sometimes I become interested,-sometimes sleepy; in either case, it serves to pass away the time; and in the latter, Horace takes a stroll while I take a nap. We like to have the children led within sight and hearing of us, in their walks and plays; and I hope he begins to find some consolation in them. Our loss has made him an attentive father, and me at least an anxious mother. In my blindness, I must still fancy that the poor little girls would be safer where their brother is; but I dread, unutterably, pain for them or for myself any further shock or change.  *  *  * "Of an afternoon, I love best to sit in the bay- window and watch the river and think, how still it looks under its dreary, gray mantle of ice,-as fixed as life,-but how fleet it is, and how surely on its way to   A GNES WENT WORTH.       261 that ocean which, though we cannot see it, is so near,--or to gaze at the clouds and foolishy, fondly try to cheat myself into imagining that I can make out a single little cherub's form among them."

She ran down all the way into the hall to meet him, fearing that something had happened; how all the, women feared that, all through the war I "Agnes, can you remember hearing anything about a Mr. Von Wiesel,-when you were at Newport?" "Yes, papa, I do," said Agnes, after a moment's recollection. She told what she remembered, and asked "Why?" "Why, I am very sorry to hear it; because that goes to confirm a story I heard just now on 'Change." "Oh, what?" "That a person of that name had been swindling, and failed for a hopeless amount, involving others very seriously and, among them, Horace Single." "Oh, how things do go on happening when once they begin I Poor Rosamond I Poor Horace Hf we could only hear Ht would not do to telegraph?"  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7379-00000133"/> 262     AGNES WENTWORTH. "No; it is not for us to give the alarm; and besides such news comes fast enough by mail." And such news did come fast enough by mail. Sin- gle had lost almost all that he had. It is not neces- sary to go into the details. The history of knavery and crime is neither pleasant nor profitable reading. If my readers, as many readers do, disagree with me in that opinion, I can only refer them to the Newgate Calendar. "There is one comfort, however, that we may make sure of," said Agnes, after turning the letter of ill tidings over and over, in vain, in search of any other. "When all is told it will be as clear as noondav, that Horace has been only cheated,-no cheat." Mr. Wentworth winced, as if at hearing an echo of his own thought: "My dear child, I am thankful to have you think so. I would not breathe-I would not admit--a suspicion of his being anything in money- matters but a most high-minded man. Still-I have seen much less of him than you have, you remember; and his views upon public affairs were so very extra- ordinary--" "I know; but, papa,. I really think his politics came of the same cause as his other misfortunes." "And that was?" "His being so very superfi- so unpenetrating, if there is such a word,-so very easily taken in, espe- cially by whatever or whomsoever appeared to him to be in fashion." "He would be considerably surprised to hear you say that, little miss," said Mr. Wentworth, in spite of himself "smiling at grief."   A GNES WENTWORTH.       263- "Very considerably, indeed; but that again is the very last proof of his confiding nature,--he cannot even distrust his own wisdom." "Pour out my tea, you -naughty witch; and don't insult the fallen." The little adroit touch of congenial caustic had raised Mr. Wentworth's spirits for the time. Her sister's next letter confirmed Agnes's impression  "I think," wrote Rosamond, " that, except on my ac- count and the children's, it would be a positive relief to Horace to give up everything, he is so shocked to find what use Mr. Von Wiesel has been secretly making of his name to draw in others. But the creditors are so impressed with his honorable conduct, and see so clearly how his unsuspecting honesty has been imposed upon, that they insist on his reserving a small portion of his income,-enough, we hope, with strict economy to feed, shelter, and clothe us,--until he finds some- thing that he can do." "What can he do?" cried old Mr. Wentworth, hold- ing up both hands; " what will become of them?" "Papa," said old Mr. Wentworth's comforter, "it would take a good while for me to tell you all the reasons I have for thinking so; but I do think they may do better than ever--in the end. Nobody, at any rate, who had only seen Horace- when he was having his own way, would have believed he could be so gentle and patient and good as he was when his sight was failing, and Rosamond ill, and their poor little baby just dead; and Ernest says, ' you can never tell all that there is in people, until you have seen them put to all the tests.'"  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7379-00000134"/> 264      A GNES WENTWORTH. "Very satisfactory to you and Ernest, no doubt," answered the old gentleman with a groan. "You are young enough to be Utopian. But, at my age, one can- not but observe that people must live, and that they need something more substantial than theories to live upon, or than patience and gentleness either." "How would you like to have them all come here for a good long visit, in the first place, while they are settling their affairs and plans?" asked Agnes, plunging with her wonted docility at once from the theoretical into the practical. "Very much indeed. Write and tell them so." Agnes did write and tell them so, most promptly, emphatically, and eloquently. She was not refused. Rosamond would come with the children, in a fort- night; and Single, as soon after as he could possibly wind up the more pressing of his affairs. Meanwhile almost every hour that Agnes could spare, from her letters and her work for the Sanitary Commission, was at first spent in preparation for her guests. Rosamond must have the chamber which she was used to, and Ernest, the one that was his in the dear old times, when-if--he should come. Agnes assigned her own to her little nieces, that they might be near their parents, and for herself would take Wal- ter's. If anybody else had it, his things would have to be disturbed; and that, she could not bear. As she went up and down and to and fro, with her grave and tempered hospitable gladness, so akin to sorrow and so mingled with it, she could hardly believe it was so short a time--in years,-as it was, since she hurried and scampered through those selfsame passages, in   A GNES WENT WORTH.       265 simple ecstasy to make ready for the selfsame 'sister.

How few years it was since Agnes rejoiced at Rosamond's coming, in the thought of being herself taken care of, petted, and amused I Her great hope now was, to be able to cherish, soothe, and enliven. CHAPTER XXXVI. AT the end of a week, everything was in readiness, even to the blue shades in Rosamond's windows. It was Agnes's "day [to be manager] at the Sanitary Rooms ;" and she began her business. "What orders, Miss Blake?" said she with official conciseness, to her subaltern who was opening despatches at the desk. "Not many. Pickles wanted at Annapolis,-all that we can spare, - rollers for Wise's Ford, three barrelfuls,--five hundred army blue shirts for Fort Jefferson,'-- "Is that all?-But that warm place?" "For the flannel shirts?-They say the changes in the weather give the men iqflammations." "Whose requisition?" "Head-quarters' at Washington." "Oh, well. I suppose we have them here?" "Yes, and more; and here is a good box." "Then let us fold and pack while our arms are fresh "- 23  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7379-00000135"/> 266     A GNES WENT WORTH "That gentleman wishes to speak to you, doesn't he, Miss Wentworth?" Agnes reared her high golden head out of the box over which she was stooping, recognized Edward Arden in his surgeon's regimnentals, and hastened for- ward to welcome him: "Dr. Arden, how delightful! But you are not at home on sick-leave?" "No, on furlough." "How enchanted Clara must be!" "Yes. Call you come out and speak to her?-She is at the door."- "Certainly," said Agnes; and she turned at once toward the door, wondering that Clara did not come in. "Hadn't you better put your cloak on?-It is cold." Agnes threw her cloak about her, and again was making for the door, silenced by something strange in his look and manner, when he asked, "Are the rest of these yours?" and, taking her bonnet, scarf, and gloves from the hook where they hung-, overtook her witlh them, and offered his arm. She accepted it mechanically. "Papa?" asked she looking up in his face and pausing on the threshold. "Oh, no, my dear." She made one rush out of the hall into the carriage, and seized Clara by both hands: "Clara, you will tell me! Rosamond?" "No, dearest; but we thought you and Mr. Vernon would wish to be together; and Edward would take you. He hopes the best; but"'-even as she spoke Clara unclasped her hand; and Agnes saw the awful despatch within it, white and red like a messenger of blood and death doling out the words:   A GNES WENTWORT11.       26 "HATCHERS . RUN . MARCH . 25TH . ERNEST. VERNON . WOUNDED. RIGHT. LUNG. SERIOUSLY.," Oh, it had come! It had come at last! The black shadow that had lain upon her path so long, that in a dreary way she was becoming accustomed to it, had turned into substance now. There was no doubt now -no longer hope or the chance of escape. Agnes covered her face and leaned back. She seemed to hear a soundless tumult through the silence, from which came the words "Vernon has fallen!-has fallen!" and nothing more. In her darkness, she saw the flash,- the ball on its way. She saw him drop, and the tralm- pling crowds close over him with no hand to help; and she saw no more. Then she became sensible that the coach was turn- ing round and carrying her away; and Edward Arden spoke from the seat opposite to her,--more like him- self, now that the miserable business of telling her the news was over: "You must not give him up, Miss Agnes. I do not, I assure you; and I have seen more of this sort of thing than you."' Agnes uncovered her ghastly face, and looked dumbly at him and then at the despatch. His eye followed hers and answered it: "'Seri- ously'; yes, of course ; any wounds in the lungsn must be called serious; but men get over them and laugh with the scars for many a long year. Besides there is often a good deal of hurry in the exploration of such cases on a battle-field. Why, I have -known a compli- cation consisting merely of a tooth knocked out, a kick in the ribs, and a very harmless little chronic bronchitis, reported as fractured rib with perforation and internal  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7379-00000136"/> 2fi8     AGNES WENTITWORTIt. hemorrhage. We will start presently, if you say the word, to patch him up between us; and then, if he is not all right by next autumn, one of your Sanitary ladies will have to be detailed for special service, may- be, and' take him to Europe." Agnes received so much comfort as this: Edward Arden did not despair of finding Ernest alive, or he would never think of taking her to Ernest. He would save Ernest if skill and care could save him. At all events, he would do the best to get her to Ernest in time to soothe his last monients,-to hear his last words. Notwithstanding, to speak of thanks-to speak of anything but one,-seemed impossible. She could only grasp Dr. Arden's hand, and ask, "How soon?" "'How soon' can we start? -As soon as I have been to Mr. Wentworth's office, to speak to him, and put a few little good things together for Vernon. By the way,-do you observe?-He must have directed for himself where the telegraph should be sent,-else nobody would have thought of addressing it to me. He knew I was to be here.  I saw him last week; I'll tell you about it on the road," said Edward springing from the coach at Metcalf's apothecary-shop, where he had ordered the coachman to set him down to procure the first of the " little good things" he had promised,- namely opium. Clara took Agnes home and, persuading her to lie down and save her strength for the journey, selected some  necessaries and packed them for her in small compass. Then she knelt in silence by the sofa, fold- irlg the poor girl's clasped hands within her own.   AGNES WE NTWORTH.       269 Agnes knew that Clara was praying with her and for her. That sympathizing silence did more for the tumult of her soul than any uttered sympathy could have done. It almost seemed to her that she was at- tended by one of the visible angels of Gethsemane; and she struggled with herself to say, "Thy will be done," as fervently as she said, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from us!" She was to have need of all the composure she had gained. Mr. Wentworth came home, hotly and inco- herently to forbid her going: "My child, I beg that such a thing may not be so much as mentioned to me! You do not know where you would find Mr. Vernon nor how. Let him by all means be brought here; my house is, and has been, always open to him. You can be in no condition to think for yourself; it is a case in which your friends must judge for you. Unquestion- ably you ought at least to wait, till we hear something more definite. Miss Arden will tell you, that the plan I have heard something of would involve a great deal of fatigue and exposure, and, in one word, (for I must speak plainly in order to be understood, and to bring the discussion to an end), that it would be a most unsuitable and improper expedition for any young lady. " Clara did not tell her so; she had never done an un- conventional thing in her life, because no unconven- tional thing had ever come up as the right thing to be done by her; but Herman Arden's sister knew, that where the choice lay between what might be blamed, and what would be blameworthy, there was no room for hesitation. She had at once proposed herself in- 23*  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7379-00000137"/> 270     AGNES WENT WORTH. deed,-in her brother's hurried consultation with her on the arrival of the telegraph,-as Agnes's compainion; but he had answered, that, in the then state of the country and difficulty of obtaining conveyances, two persons might go where three could not; and speed. was everything. There would probably be some good women already in attendance on the wounded, under whose wing he could place Agnes; but, if otherwise, Vernon's need of her would be all the greater; and. Edward himself would send for Sanitary nurses, or, if Vernon lingered, there would be time to make what- ever arrangement appeared the best to Miss Went- worth's family. Therefore Clara just now made no answer. Agnes felt forsaken. She got up and went to the window and looked into the street where the rain was falling. Her brain was ready to turn. The widening rings, spun by the falling drops in the standing pools, seemed like whirling wheels in some horrid machine set in motion to carry her further and further from him. What would that " something more definite" be, for which she was to wait?--Delay! when it might make all the difference between her seeing Vernon soon or never I She had never before disputed her father's will; she dared not do so now lest she should do so too des- peratelv. Clara came and put her arm round her. She looked round and said, "Clara, Clara, if I had mar- ried him when he prayed me to, it would have been my right to be with him now." "Dearest child, you did what you thought right; and it must come out right," said Clara softly, and then aloud, "I hear my brother's voice below, Mr. Went-   A GVNES WENRWNTWORTII.    271 worth. Will you have the kindness to take me down to him?" Mr. Wentworth half offered his arnm mechanically, then dropped it, went to Agnes, and kissed her before he went. For the first time his caress was unreturned. Agnes was stunned. Only when she saw that they were leaving her, she said, "Clara,--a letter;-- ask Dr. Arden to wait for it." She tottered to her little writing-table and drew-it to the window,-the same at which she had written her childish note to beg the dead Walter to come and take care of the dying Ernest. She dipped the pen in the ink; the words would not come. How could she tell him that she abandoned him in his extremity-him who to her was faithful unto death?-that she left him alone at the last, to cope, perhaps in vain, with doubts and terrors which from their dormant state she had quickened into life! How could she tell him? Not at all. There are some limits to obedience-in the Lord. Clara had laid her outer garments ready. She threw them on. The little valise stood by. - She caught it up. Her limbs were nerved anew. She flew down stairs, and encountered Clara hastening towards her from the library-door: "Clara, I am going.-Tell Dr. Arden I am going.-Tell papa I ami gone.-I must go." "Darling, you are to go;-here he is to bid you good-bye; and the coach is at the door." "Oh, Clara, God bless you I Oh, papa, God keep you! Dear Clara, take care of him till Rosamond comes."  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7379-00000138"/> 2 7      AGNES IWEN'tVOR TIT "Indeed I will, and write to her too." Agnes was gone. Mr. Wentworth had grown more yielding as well as more timid since Walter's death. CHAPTER XXXVII THEN came days and nights of travelling and pray- ing, praying and travelling, with a constant roar of wheels, and frequent ringing of bells and whistling of steam, and feverish drinking of tea and occasional efforts at taking food and sleep. That was almost all that Clara could ever learn about it from Agnes, ex- cept that Edward sometimes spoke very kindly to her, and usually, as kindly or still more so, let her alone; but in fact the only times that Agnes ever tried to tell about it, she quite broke down helplessly-a most un- common thing for her, and shed in a river the tears that were pent up on the journey. Edward, on his part, informs me that he never saw a woman behave so well, except his sister Clara; but as the good be- havior appears to have consisted chiefly in gentleness, stillness, and unflagging endurance, there is not much to be said about it until they reached the camp at Bell's Creek. Edward left Agnes hard by, at a loyal farm-house, to lie down for an hour and get a little rest if she could, while he went to head-quarters to make inquiries about   AGNES WENTWORTH.       273 their further way. She found it impossible to keep her eyes closed so near, and yet out of sight of, Ernest, and, being chilled, rose and seated herself by the kitchen hearth. It was growing shady when Edward came back, but by the fire-light she saw that he was looking perplexed and anxious. "What have you heard?" cried she starting up. "Nothing about our friend,-nothing at all. What I have on my mind is the question, whether you had not better pass the night here and move to-morrow with' the troops." Agnes's lips parted as if for an exclamation; but she suppressed it, and only asked "Because?" "Because we are, so to speak, at one horn of a hol- low half-moon held for the government, and Hatcher's Run is at the other. In order to reach Hatcher's Run to-night, we must go-on horseback, and you must be pretty nearly knocked up already-through thirty miles of the enemy's country." Agnes wrung her hands and looked into the fire for a moment. Then she turned, he says, " like a doe at bay:" "Then, dear Dr. Arden, I ought not to ask you to go; and for Clara's sake I do ask you not to go; but I must go.  Oh," cried she, hanging upon his arm with both her clasped hands, and lifting her large, tearless eyes to his face, " only find me a trusty guide; and God bless you for all,-for that more than all the rest!" ' But, my dear girl, your father." "If anything happens to me, Rosamond will take care of poor papa. " "But what would he say?"  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7379-00000139"/> 274     A GES WENTIVORTIL "What could he, if you told him the fact,-that you could not help it?-Oh, Dr. Arden, while we are talk- ing, Ernest may be dying!" "Miss Wentworth, you are of age, are not you?" "Yes,-twenty-three." "Can you ride and shoot?" "I can ride-" "Oh, of course,--I remember!"- "If you will show me how, I can shoot." "I will go"- "Oh, not you!" "I should go, at all events; they want surgeons.- I will go and see if I can get you a practicable horse." He went; and again Agnes sank passively down into her seat. A dull heaviness was, little by little, mlastering her frame more and more. But presently a wild fear struck her: Dr. Arden, thinking her un- reasonable and unmanageable, might elude her and go on without her, especially if there was much difficulty in finding what he would consider a tolerable "lady's horse." She flew after him and caught him, before he had gone sixty yards from the door, herself almost too much out of breath to gasp, "Dr. Arden, it is un- derstood?-I am going.-With you or without you-I am going." "Oh, yes," said Edward, with a twinkle in his eye in the midst of all his compassion, " do not fear. You have made yourself perfectly understood. If it is a possible thing, I will take you with me. Otherwise, I shall at least colme and tell you. Now go back and keep yourself in a state to go."   AGNES WENT WORTH.       275 Agnes regained the fireside and her seat, and prob- ably dozed; for she was scarcely aware that five minutes had passed, when she was startled by the trampling of galloping hoofs, and opened her eyes on an incessant bobbing of horses' and horsemen's heads against the fading sunset in front of the window of the cottage, which, from the sound, seemed to be sur- rounded. Covering herself by the shutter, she peeped cautiously out; but her sight was too dim to distin- guish the color of the uniform of the riders. She was making the best of her way up stairs, in search of the farmer's wife, when to her relief she heard Edward Arden's voice without, in conversation with another which sounded familiar and began, "How are you, Dr. Ned?" "Paul Dudley, by all that is lucky! How came you here?" "On four legs as usual." "Very good; but have you eight legs to spare?" "To keep your hand in at amputations?-No, thank you; I am not a centipede; and, not being upon the surgical staff, I preserve my natural humanity amid the horrors of war." 'No, but,-just come in here, will you?- Miss Wentworth is with me on- our way to the wounded at Hatcher's Run. -How shall I get her there? Can you let us have saddle-horses?" 'One, I can,-General Winder's. Two?-I wish I could; let me see.--I'm afraid I can't.--Really, Doctor, I think it would be very much better on all accounts for her to jump up behind you. That is the arrange- mnent I should make for one of my sisters, in the cir-  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7379-00000140"/> 2C 76     AGNES WENTWOR TII. cumstances. Miss Wentworth is a bold rider, I know, and a good one; but suppose we were to be attacked and she, separated from us in the dark?" "I see." "I detail myself and my men for escort duty. It comes within the scope of my instructions. I'll tell my orderly-a sterling fellow-to ride at your heels, keep his eye on her, and take care of her if anything goes wrong with us. There's nothing I should like better than to volunteer myself as her squire; only she might not like it so well, because my age isn't equal to my discretion; and besides you know, Doctor, in case of an encounter, I couldn't oppose so broad a front to the enemy." "Aha! Even at your age, I should have been ashamed to be so deficient in-muscle." "Muscle, is it?-I was afraid it might be a case of what I have heard you call fatty degeneration.- Well, you should know best. May your shadow never be less. But, Doctor, wouldn't Miss Wentworth let me have a cup of tea with her before we are off again? I haven't seen a lady for a month; and I want to know when she saw my sister Rose." Accordingly Agnes came down from her watch- tower, and in common gratitude renewed, as best she might, an old acquaintance with the gay young cavalier. Then the horse,-a huge creature, luckily, as Dr. Arden's " muscle " had now been for some years in a course of rapid developement,--was led curvetting up to the door, and provided with an extempore pillion carefully strapped on.   A GNES WENT WORTH.       2" "A magnificent rebel," said Colonel Dudley, bestow- ing on the charger a pat, which he endeavored to acknowledge by a playful nip; "he has only one trick -effectually provided against too, by the present ar- rangoement,-that of running away; and that we taught him ourselves before we took him "' Edward mounted; and Colonel Dudley helped Agnes up after him, exclaming, "After all, Dixie has little more than an average pair to carry. If Dr. Arden is slightly plus, Miss Wentworth, you are minus." Agnes's tall form, naturally slender, was now light indeed. Then, at last, the farmer's wife had done pinning the young lady's shawl round her to serve as a riding- skirt, and wishing 1" thar was any ke-ars for her to go in," and being thanked; and "Mount!" was cried in the young colonel's military voice; and he and his men were in the saddle also; before, beside, and behind her. He turned his horse's head and rode in to her for one last word: "You are commander pro tern, Miss Wentworth. Do we ride slow or fast?" "If you please, fast-very fast." "Certainly. Send forward your orderly, Dr. Arden, at any time, if Miss Wentworth desires a halt." Fast and very fast they rushed on, tilting up :and down through the dark, led by a loyal negro- who knew the country. It was all like a very strange dream to Agnes Wentworth. Space and Time had been abstractions to her before, as to the rest of us; now they were the most real and pressing realities in the sensible world,-two malign powers, they had started out into horrid life, forever growing and widen- 24  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7379-00000141"/> 278     AGNES WENTnWORTH. ing, to hold her off--to throw her back--from the death-bed of her dying lover. The night was cloudy and moonless; and little was to be seen but undefined motion through dim, transparent darkness Nothing was to be heard but the tramp of hoofs and the clank of sabres; except once when they swept too near a new encampment in its sleep, and heard the waking sentinel's tardy challenge and random shot fired after them in vain. Agnes was scarcely conscious now of any weariness. Every nerve was strained to its atmost tension. Her only fear was that the enemy might cut them off from Vernon, or that, reaching him, they might reach him too late. Their violent, bewildering speed was a relief, so far as anything, in shaking thought out of her brain; and no halt was called for by her unto the end. That end came even sooner than she expected; so that, when the horses suddenly stood still, and Colonel Dudley came to help her alight, she said, "Must we stop here?I "1 If we stop at Hatcher's Run," answered he, laugh- ing. "You would not want to be too hard upon Dixie; see how he foams at the mouth. But if you have not had enough of gentle exercise, he shall be at your service again to-morrow." Agnes heard only the first words. As he left her on her feet, she staggered, sank down on an over- turned basket in the farm-yard where she found her- self, and, by the light of a lantern hung over a barn- door, looked up into Edward Arden's face. "Colonel Dudley will wait here with you a few minutes," said Edward, disniounting in his turn,   A GNES WENTWORTH.        279, "while I go into this hospital to make inquiries. I will not stay long." He went, came out in a very few minutes, and led her into the barn with him, saying softly, as he did so, "He is living, and, we hope, going to live. The wound ap-" pears to be not very extensive in the lung; and the ball came out. He is under a dose of opium now;-a heavy one-and may not know you at first." No more was said. They had to pick their way. The barn was dimly lighted by lanterns hung here and there from the beams. The floor was covered with hay; and the hay was thick with outstretched men sleeping, writhing, dying, or dead. Some lifted their heads in turn to look eagerly and wistfully at Agnes as she passed,-perhaps for mother, daughter, or wife, whom they should never see again;-and as she approached she looked in turn at each. Which was Ernest? Where? She could not see. She could not ask. She could only keep on passively as she was led,-and Edward kept steadily leading her on toward the furthest corner, nearer and nearer,-towards a ghastly,- gasping man, with the features of a corpse, sharp and shrunk, and no expression but that which is the family likeness, in a manner, of those who want to breathe and cannot. Why must she be brought so close, to look upon such misery? Oh, that could -not be Ernest I But it was. He was muttering fitfully to himself. He did not know her. She glided in between him and the wall, sat down at his side and took his careless hand in hers. Edward Arden rolled up behind her a great cushion  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7379-00000142"/> 280     A GNES WrENT WOR TIr of the hay, and said soothingly, "He will recognize you by degrees; and that is best. It will excite him least. His life depends on quiet." When she looked round again for him, he had left them together. Looking down again to Vernon, she saw that his open glassy eyes had fixed on her and with apparent satisfaction, though without surprise and almost with- out intelligence. "Angel of light," he murmured; and then his heavy lids sank. He breathed longer breaths; and they were all that showed he was not dead; and she feared he would be, before he could know that she was with him, or she could know how it was with him. Yet she dared not rouse him,-dared not even shed the tears of which her heart seemed full, lest she might rouse him. The agony of that suspense! Was he to pass away from under her watching gaze, into the dark uncertainty of the unbeliever's doom? He was not. Before the surgeons, on their midnight round, came to him again, Agnes saw his eyes open and fix themselves on her once more, with a look of greater and increasing consciousness. At length he murmured again and beckoned. She bent her ear over him and just caught the word "Agnes." "Yes, dearest." "Agnes, thank God for me--I thank God," he stam- mered, appearing to rally all his strength for one last effort to give her the assurance she had prayed and longed for,--"in the name  of-of our Lord Jesus Christ-for--for now-I know I believe in him,-by this-this death-no leap-in the dark--a climb  up into the light-Thank God and you!" "Dearest Ernest, I understand," said Agnes in her   A (GNES WEN'T WfOR TI.     281 sweetest, clearest tone. "That is enough. I do thank God. He has given you to me and me to you; and we are Christ's; and Christ is God's; and neither life nor death can ever part us anvymore.'" He smiled, and was still for a few moments in the repose of utter exhaustion; but probably, in the cloudi- ness of his mind, he doubted whether he had fully ex- plained himself; since presently he began again, almost inaudibly but with an eagerness that was touching to see, "I believe in God the Father Almighty-and in- and in Jesus-' It was hard-it seemed cruel to hush his last words; but Agnes rose to her knees beside him, laid her finger beseechingly on his lips, and caught the confession from him: "We believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was, by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary,--" He evidently followed her with ear and eye to the end of that most ancient of the Creeds which is called "The Apostles'," and, at its close, whispered "Amen." Before he recovered himself enough to try again to0 speak, the surgeons, almost to her relief, reached him and repeated his dose of opium and their injunctions of silence. Again he was silent and soon again unconscious; but the silence was not what it had been before. The great question between them had been answered. She felt to her heart's core the truth of what she had said to him: it was enough. For eternity he was hers; and it seemed to her that eternity for them was already begun. Now that the long tension and suspense of three years were over,--that she had no more hope of 'x4*  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7379-00000143"/> 282     AGNES WENTWORTI. life nor fear of the second death for him,--she felt so worn, so weak, so ill, that she could not imagine she should long survive him. It was enough for the future that he was safe,-under him the everlasting arms,- and for the present, that she had reached him and could sit upon the floor where he lay, with his head upon her knees and her hand upon his temple, where she could feel that the pulse still fluttered and beat. So the night wore away in a trance of exhausted and deathly peace, with the lanterns burning and waning, the attendants coming and going, and the wounded dozing or dying. At length two or three cocks crowed. Next a dog barked; and a babble of human treble voices was heard approaching; and one of the great barn-doors opened, letting in a dim, white, triangular wall of morning twi- light across the place, and two or three women with a pail in each hand. They were Western Virginia farmers' wives, and came to bring milk, coffee, tea, and beef-tea, with a tin dipper floating on the top of each.. Edward Arden dragged himself drowsily up out of the hay in which he was at last yielding to a morning slumber, administered a dipperful in turn to Vernon and to Agnes, clasped the wrist of the former, said to the latter, "His pulse is no worse-rather better per- haps, considering the time of day," and relapsed into his nap. The women came and began to press her to return to breakfast with them; but a glimpse of the face to which she gently pointed, hushed them, and soon sent them  away. It looked still more deathke by day- light,-much more like death than life. But when Dr. Arden came again on his regular morn-   A GNEbS WENTWORTH.       283 ing round,- he was not so easily disposed of as the women. As Agnes would have returned, after giving place to the examination and dressing of Vernon's wound, he met her on the way with the speech, "Now, my charge, I have good news for you; but as soon as you have heard it, you are to go to a good, warm, quiet room which Mr. Vernon's head-man has, by my orders, found for you. You have there to eat, or, at all events, drink a good breakfast, and then go regularly to bed for six or eight hours whether you sleep or not." "Dr. Arden I How can I?" "In the first place, because Mr. Vernon is very pro- perly anxious about it. The dressing has soothed him; his man there will watch him; and, unless he is opposed or disturbed, he will probably go to sleep too, at once, as he ought." Agnes looked and saw a trusty, intelligent, yeomanly- looking person, whom she had not noticed before, sit- ting motionless at her post. Arden offered his arm. She felt obliged to take it, but still hung back; "Dear Dr. Arden, you know I would not give you any need- less trouble,-I would keep out of sight if you thought I must,-but--" "But Mr. Vernon is doing well." "Oh, Dr. Arden!" "But he certainly is-as well as such a man can do with such a wound. It looks better, Dr. Chopart says, than it has ever done before; and his pulse I can answer for, myself;--with some variations, such as I should have expected, it has on the whole improved since we have been here. In the circumstances, it was safer that the shock should not pass off suddenly."  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7379-00000144"/> 284     A GNVES WENVTtVORTTL "But his breathing?" "Bad,--as usual in such cases ;-but growing easier, as he says himself. He has more than an even chance now, we think. You see that I am telling you the whole truth." "But if--there is a change while I am gone?" "I shall be here ; and you shall be called at once.- Don't knock yourself up, my dear girl ; that's the rock that most clever women's work splits upon.-There are some national nurses, though, expected here to-day; and if you are down with typhoid fever, perhaps we can take care of Mr. Vernon without you." Agnes smiled a smile that brought the tears into his eyes, and yielded. He rewarded her by adding, as soon as he could, "You will see the improvement in him at intervals, better than if you were watching him all the time; and, if things go as I strongly hope they will, you will soon want your strength for carrying him home to complete the cure in Boston." "Things" did "go," that day, as Dr. Arden hoped. When Vernon's obedient nurse returned in the after- noon, refreshed by rest and food, she found him some- what refreshed likewise, and pleased to see her so, breathing less like a dying man, and looking more like a living one. She had given him up, and received him again at the hand of the Lord. Vernon was not to die-not yet. Meantime the volunteer nurses had arrived. One of them proved to be an intimate war-acquaintance and friend of Dr. Arden's. A charming Quaker matron from Philadelphia, she was in age, character, experience,   AGNES WENTWORTH.        285 and station, as suitable a protectress as could be de- sired for Agnes, and immediately adopted both her and Ernest as her " children pro tempore;" while Edward Arden joked, grumbled, dressed, and operated, made his fellow-creatures merry and made them well with equal success, and was after his clever old-bachelor fashion- the life of the hospital barn. Day by day the hope for Vernon grew stronger, and the fear for him grew less. Agnes could leave him at night with less and less anxiety, and, meet him in the morning with livelier and livelier joy, to work not only for him, but under his eye for the wistful sufferers around him. Neither of them was altogether ill pleased with their having this little taste of service in common ; but it was not many weeks before they were better pleased still to have Vernon lying in his old place in the library in Beacon Street. CHAPTER XXXVIII. WHAT talks they had there;-for Ernest was now allowed to talk in moderation and to listen at discre- tion!-Their mutual love, in the short time when they were there as lovers before, was too anxious and too sad to be loquacious. "Ernest,"' said Agnes, one afternoon at' twilight, "I never quite understood how it was, that you came to be so very fraternal as to consult Rosamond before  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7379-00000145"/> 286     AGNES IWENTIWORTH. you offered yourself to me, by this fireside, three years ago, about this time of day." "What was your hypothesis?" "I do not think I shall tell; I believe it was not worth the telling." "It was not a true one, you may be sure; Miss Wentworth the first had taught me some home-truths, on a former occasion. I was not grateful to her then; -perhaps I am not now on quite all accounts;--but you may have various reasons to be so. In the first place she instructed me, that it was neither generous, nor indeed quite honest, to try to persuade a young gentlewoman to be one's wife, unless one had the means to maintain a wife. I did not think you were likely to consider, or able to judge, whether I had or not. Supposing you should be inclined to smile on my suit, I did not wish to take advantage of unsus- pecting innocence. Therefore I took the precaution to state the amount of my present revenues to your wiser sister, who pronounced it sufficient for you. You think you could possess your soul in peace to brew my tea in a plated tea-pot, and drink your milk out of a pressed- glass tumbler?" Agnes's eyes sparkled: "Oh, how nice! It is so tame to do, and have, everything exactly like one's neighbors I It will be like ' playing keep house' again, which I used to think such fun, and having, what I used to long for in vain, somebody near my own age to play it with me.-Indeed," she added more thought- fully, "I hope I am not extravagant, nor altogether inexperienced now. Papa says, that for the past three years, while prices have risen so much in general, I   AGNES WENTWORTIt.       287 have done a good deal for him in keeping his household expenses within bounds; and now I mean to grow not only economical but practical. Mrs. Tibbets knows how to do everything; and I shall set her to teach me." "She has my kingly consent to teach you as much as you choose; but I hope you do not propose- always' to 'practise what you know,'--at least in Mrs. Tib- bets' line." "Do you?--in earnest?" "As my name is Ernest." "But why?" "First, it is not necessary. Secondly, you would not like it. Thirdly, it would take work away from poorer women, who can do such work only and not the higher work that you can do. Fourthly, it would separate us too much. Fifthly,--are you tired so soon of painting, Agnes?" "No, indeed; but you will soon paint again; and it ought to be enough for me to watch you and sympa- thize with you, dear, dear Ernest." "And now am I to turn flatterer?" asked he with a kind of meaning archness. "Take care, Agnes." Her color rose a little: "Ernest, I do not under- stand." "When women turn sycophants, men generally pay them--with flattery. Agnes, I propose to wed an artist-not to slay an artist. Your imagination is loftier than mine-" "Oh, 'take care, Ernest'./" "It is-and more fertile; but not to have more exe- cution and artistic savoir-faire than you, I must hava  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7379-00000146"/> 288     AGNES WENTWORTH. been an idler and a dunce in Italy, which in the worst of times, I never was. I do not seek to throw all the drudgery of our united lives upon you, and keep all the beauty to myself. Be my partner in art as in all things. We will be a pictorial Beaumont and Fletcher." "Or a Tate and Brady," suggested the naughty girl in the joy of her heart. "Or a Sternhold and Hopkins," returned he, paying her back in her own coin. "Do you know, Ernest, that--in this very room, when I was only eleven years old,-it was you who first made me an artist?" "Do you know, Agnes, that in this very room, when you were only eleven years old,-it was you who first taught me that art, to be true, should be hal- lowed to and by the great Artist,--then first, after- ward many a time-that a high Godward loyalty should be to art as the soul is to the body?" "Do you know, Ernest," said she, in a very low timid tone, " that it was you who ensured faith to me?" "Indeed, I do not, dear. How could that be?" "It was the little book that you lent me at Wash- ington, which first gave me a faith that I dared think about, and could rejoice in with my whole grown-up mind and spirit. When some doctrines, in which I was brought up, were preached to me before, I sup- posed they were a real, essential part of the Christian revelation; and so I stifled down my reason that it might not revolt at them ; but that was growing harder every year. It might have grown too hard at last," added Agnes with a shudder. "You do know, Agnes, that it was your firm-   A GAES WESNTWORTH.      289 ness, with your love and your influence altogether, which, under God, earned faith for me." "But oh, Ernest, that night at Hatcher's Run!- That waiting before you roused to your confession of -faith!" "And it was your presence that roused me.; without that, I believe I never could have rallied."- "Why did you never tell me before?" "I could never be certain enough before, that I should not be cheating you,-that I was not cheating myself, 'while your hand was to be the reward of my faith. Then I fully believed myself dying; and Death is disinterested. But without that confession, should you have despaired of me?" "When I felt as I do now?--Oh, no. But if you- had not recovered, how should I ever again have felt as I do now? Such days of darkness follow such a loss! One's very soul cries out for every--all-full assurance,--the seal of Christian faith set upon Chris- tian deeds. But if you mean to ask nme whether,- iwith the nearer, clearer views of God and the Saviour, which you have brought to nle,-I think that they could treat iany helpless, unwilling unbelief with severity, I answer that I have little fear of that--of anything. Despair is struck out of life." "But do you see then-I begin to-that we have been playing into each other's hands almost all our lives?" "So may we then to the end of them." "Else marriage would be no wedlock." "Only a mockery of it,-a frightful mockery! But now, dear Ernest, you really ought to rest; and, if you 25  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7379-00000147"/> 290     AGNES IVENTlWORTH. will, I am going up to help Rosamond put the little girls to sleep, and then bring her back with me to play Chopin to you." CHAPTER    XXXIX. THE library looked bright, homelike, and somewhat like old times again in the evening after tea. Old Mr. Wentworth, only a little more bent and hoary, sat over the newspapers in his accustomed place, with the " drop- light silvering his thin, pale hair. Rosamond and Horace Single,-in his blue spectacles,--were again under the chandelier by the piano. At present, how- ever, she was neither musical nor wicked, but looking benign, dignified, and thoughtful, reading letters to her husband and discussing them in a low voice with him. Their new intimacy might be the more closely ce- mented by the fact that they had only one pair of "available" eyes between them. Those which came to Single by birth, he was as yet permitted to use only for a few minutes daily and for large print. He was accordingly dependent upon the conjugal orbs for nearly all his letter-writing and letter-reading. It was natural to him to talk of whatever he was thinking about to the person nearest; and thus a great deal of conversation and information about their common affairs now fell to the share of his wife. He was day by day more im- pressed with, and surprised at, her sense and discre- tion; though after all she confided to her sister, that   AG NES WENTWORT H.       291' they were, as to business, " little better than a pair of babes in the wood," and that her counsel at the best usually amounted " only to advising him to take ad- vice." "Was not there a note besides?" asked he, on the present occasion, with the eagerness of a petted in- valid, as Rosamond perused and folded up the last letter. "Yes, dear-,-for me from Etta Van Rooselandt." "Oh."-The time had been when Single had coolly- opened any enclosure to his wife that came in his way. "It was scarcely meant for any one but me; but it brings good news; and--if you will promise to think so,--you shall see and hear some things there are in it." "I will try, if you would like to put me to the test." "In the first place, here is a present for you." "Ten thousand dollars HFrom her?" No, dear--from her cousin Rosamond. Etta has been so kind as to sell my diamonds for me. Now you will go on with your oculist, and not try to work until he gives you leave." "Oh, Rosamond, to what have I brought you!" cried poor Single, covering his face with his hands. Rosamlond gently pulled them down again: "Dear Horace, I thought we agreed not to care any more for such trifles. Do- you know that I am thirty years old?-almost a middle-aged woman?-Is it not time for mne to put away childish things?" Single caught up a sheet of Chopin,-to shade his  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7379-00000148"/> 292     AGNES WENTWORTH. eyes,-and kissed her behind it. Again the impartial mirror made its reflections. In the mean time Vernon on the sofa, and Agnes beside it, held further conferences. As Rosamond crossed and left the room, to inquire into a cry in the nursery, his look followed her. "What a beautiful picture she is-to the eye!" said he, thinking aloud. "To the mind too," said Agnes, with sisterly sen- sitiveness, "at least to me who know her thoroughly." "Yours,is the most beautiful picture to my mind and eye both," said he, turning quickly to gaze at her; "and it is the most extraordinary thing,--I did not know what I was about while I was doing it,--I find I have painted you, too." "Why, Ernest I How was that?" "That is more than I can explain. But if Mrs. and Mr. Single will come up with us to the old studio to-morrow, you shall all see the picture,-I want to find out whether others will recognize the likeness,- and I will tell you the history of the thing, so far as it has any. It is the only original one I painted with any ardor or success, the last time I was in Italy. I unboxed it and ascertained the likeness myself only this afternoon. " Agnes was surprised, but most of all gratified, for 4 Vernon's still evident artistic pleasure in gazing at her sister, though she shared it, had sometimes in spite of her made her a little sad She did not fear that his loyal heart, once pledged to her, would ever wander from her; but she would-how gladly!--have been in all respects what he preferred. "Do you know," she resumed, "that you made me a little   A GNES WENTTWORTH.      293 curious by something you said, an hour or two ago, about Rosamond? How should she ever have given you any lessons, except in economy, by which I could profit? The real Rosamond,--the one Rosamond to ward me,-is generosity and honor itself; but I have fancied sometimes from things you have let fall, that it was only a doppelganger of a Rosamond that you knew." "It may have been; but, at any rate, I have to thank her--and thank heaven-for keeping from me any other to give me you." "And is that all I have to thank her for?" persisted Agnes mischievously. "Ingrate If you cannot let bygones be bygones, I must own that Miss Wentworth, the doppelganger, gave me frankly to understand, -and not without cause, that was the worst of it!-that it-was-not disinterested, in short, in me to invite my lady-love to find her bliss in sacrificing all her tastes to mine." "Oh, Ernest, I beg your pardon!" cried Agnes, blushing in a manner to atone for a worse offence than her little curiosity. "But how she must have misun- derstood you! Why, one of the first things I remember about you is-something you said, talking here with poor dear Walter and Horace, which first put it into my little empty head, that a woman could, and per- haps ought, to be something and do something of her- self. " "Theory, my love. When it comes to action, most of us regulate ourselves by the conscience of custom; and so should I have done, and should do perhaps, but 25*  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7379-00000149"/> 294     A GNES WENT WORTH. for Mrs. Single's rebuff. In one respect too, I am de- lighted to find what injustice I have done her. She does love her husband.-I suppose I must not ask whether that was always so." "No, dear Ernest; I know you will not." ': And in spite of his being poor!" "She loves him the better for that. If pity is akin to love, so is respect; and they both seem to pity eachl other for their misfortunes, and to respect each other for the way in which they bear thenm. She loves him, I believe, as she never knew what it was to love any one before,--except her poor little baby; half her heart is still in its grave." "And what a devoted mother she is to the little girls!" She was; and it was all the more to her present credit for the fact, that devotion to them was in soime respects more of a duty than of a pleasure. The younger was trying to get a tooth, and was quite out of patience with it; and the older was still less an en- gaging child. It had not only indefinable kitchen looks and tones,-picked up probably in too indiscriminate association with servants,-but a hatred and horror of all younger children which positively embittered its little life, and which poor Rosamond was said to at- tribute, perhaps with too much truth, to the state of her own mind before its birth. However, that is a digression. The next day the family-party, and Mr. Wentworth among them, went in procession to the old studio, now hung chiefly with Agnes's efforts, but with two of Ernest's effects besides. One was the old fantasia   AGNES' WEINTIWORTIL      295 upon the Waverley Oaks; and the other, the new pic- ture, which he had brought them to see. It was a scene in a crypt. -A warrior in armor was fixed upon a tomb, but in a half-sitting posture. The lower part of the form was rigid, and apparently of stone, but the upper, full of desperate, struggling life. The arms were outstretched, as if for help, towards a hovering golden-haired angel, with snowy wings, translucent green robes, a lily on its heart, and in its hands an alabaster lamp that illuminated the blind mildewed roof and floor. it What's the subject?"-ccried the bewildered Single. "The king of the Black Islands?" "Guess again, dear," said Rosamond. "You would not call that Oriental architecture."7 "No, to be sure; Gothic, I see." "But what a beautiful likeness i" cried Rosamond. "When did you sit, Agnes?" "Never; and Ernest did not intend it for me." "Is it possible?" said Mr. Wentworth, wiping his glasses and trying them again. "Why, I should say it was a remarkably accurate likeness, except that it is so much flattered; and that, I supposed, you in- tended." Agnes led off a hearty laugh at this, in which Ernest alone did not join; for he alone could not perceive the justice of the remark. "And the likeness to yourself?" continued old Mr. Wentworth, who had a quick and true. eye. "Oh, I hope not!" exclaimed Agnes, glancing from the knight to Ernest, " it looks too unblest." "Not for me at the time it was done," answered  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7379-00000150"/> 296     A GNES WENTWORTH. Vernon. "I looked about for the most unhappy- looking man I could find, for a model, and found him in my mirror. That likeness, as far as it goes, was intentional, but is much more sketchy and shadowy, as you perceive, than the other. Of course, I did not mean it to be very noticeable." "What is the subject?' repeated Single. "An odd, apocryphal old monkish legend, incon- sistent enough, but not without its picturesqueness. A Viking was betrothed to a maiden. She became one of the first Christian converts in Scandinavia. The Viking's kindred followed suit. He stood fast by his heathenism, broke his lady-love's heart, became, after her death, nlore and more wolfish and unen- durable, and was at last hunted down like the wild- beast that he was, and killed. In spite of all, he was, at the prayers and tears of his saintly mother, allowed burial in a cathedral she had built. Meantime, while he was in a worse place, his lady-love was in purga- tory, and could not get out. Her offences were neither very many nor very heinous; but she never could remember them, nor spare a single orison for her own deliverance, so busy was she in praying for him. At last some angel,--I forget who,--Gabriel, we will say, or Michael,-happened to fly over, heard her, and informed St. Peter that he was making a great-mistake in keeping her there so long, for love so holy and so disinterested as hers was in itself a full atonement for faults so venial and so unintentional. Thereupon discharged, she flew up to heaven with her petition, and straightway returned with a warrant to release her wicked lover from the bonds both of the   'AGNES WENTWIORTH.       297 first and of the second death. You see her in the act of lighting him up from the charnel-house.'" "And was that the end of his story?" asked Agnes' shyly. -- Not quite," answered Vernon, with a smile. "Guided by her, he went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was baptized in the Jordan, and spent the rest of his threescore and ten in good works; after which she flew back, with him, to Paradise." All were silent for a few minutes; for the solemn and tender beauty of one aspect of the picture, and the strong appalling gloom of the other, began to lay hold on the souls of the least susceptible among them and to draw, and awe, them under that spell, which it is the prerogative of the highest art to cast over human nature. Single was the first to break it: "You have ex- plained all but the likeness to Agnes.-Even my eyes can see that." "That is what I cannot explain,-unless indeed by supposing that my brain unconsciously took and re- tained a photograph of her capacities for future beauty. She certainly was not very pretty as a child,-was she?--You did not think her so, did you?' said he, appealing to her sister and father,--" or even at the time of my second visit to you?-In fact, I don't re- member that I ever looked at her then; and, at the time this picture was painted, I should have been very much at a loss to say how she looked, though I could recollect a number of things that she said." The other gentlemen left the room. Rosamond fol- lowed them; and Agnes, Rosamond.

That was my model. Just before I painted the picture, 1 heard of the war. Earth seemed to be rolling from under my feet; and I had no hold on heaven. In desperation, I went into the church of Santa Lucia di * * * and prayed for light from above. I fell asleep; and again that angel with your countenance appeared to nle. Prophetic, wasn't it?" Agnes pressed his hand and ran faster down before him, calling, "Rosamond, will you wait where you are, for us? I have something to show to you and Ernest." She led them to an old, claw-footed, brass key- holed wardrobe near the next landing, and, as they waited in wonder beside her, took out her split-ring, chose a key, and unlocked a drawer. There lay the little, girlish, quaint, forgotten gala-dress, of twelve long years ago,--the thin, slight robe outstretched like a shroud of departed'childhood, the lilies dried to mummies at the breast, and the small hat at the head. The moths had eaten too much of the white wing; for heedless little Agnes had taken no thought for that. So trivial things pass away and vanish, but leave their traces upon things that last. The mys- tery of the picture was cleared up.   AGNES WEN'TWORTH,       299 CHAPTER    XL. A FORTNIGHT afterwards, Vernon invited me to his wedding. For various reasons, the party was small. Paul Dudley was bidden, however; and "nothing would have given him more pleasure than to accept, but for two insurmountable impediments.  First:- Havingo lost the last remains of his heart to Miss Wentworth, on the night that he rode under her coium- mand to Hatcher's Run, lhe could not stand tamely by to see her hand bestowed upon another. i Secondly: The general of his brigade was too much attached to him ever to allow him4 leave of absence, unless when he could contrive to throw himself upon the points of his enemies' swords; of which there was no present opportunity." For the long bad dream of the war was at an end. The ceremony took place in church. Vernon pre- viously promised obedience to his mistress for all the, rest of his life, if she would only not ask him to forego the ecstasy of seeing her, at dusk, glide up the lighted aisle in her white veil and orange-blossoms. (I believe he would have made her exchange her white muslin for a green one if he could; but that, even the tolerant Miss Arden joined Mrs. Single in assuring him that he could not.) So the handful of us, his old friends, who were in the secret, did our best, by seeing to the warming of the building, to guard him from that mys-  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7379-00000152"/> 300     AGNES WENTWORT[H. terious, and doubtless tremendous, retribution de- nounced against the exposure by Mrs. Tibbets under the name of " his deathy cold." We had our reward in our share of the spectacle. I never saw a man look so superbly happy as Vernon, nor a maiden in such a trance of white angelic rapture as Agnes. After we returned to the house, wishing to make her speak to me, I said to her not much mind- ing what, "Where are you to live?" "I am to live with Mr. Vernon," said she, turning her large, clear, amber-colored eyes slowly upon my face; " be is going to take me to fairy-land." I bowed, and accepted the statement with unques- tioning confidence, and with as much solemnity as any man could get up upon short notice; but the matter-of- fact Single must needs explain: "To Italy, Mrs. Ver- non. means;" and Agnes's blush enabled me for the first time to understand how the bridegroom could think her a beauty. He came to the rescue: "Yes; Drs. Brodie and Ar- den are hurrying us off. It is impossible, we find, for me to live out-of-doors in these east winds; and, after the free hardy life I had been leading, I am ready to tear down the walls when I am pent up within them. On my wife's account too, I am very anxious,-and they say not unreasonably so-for an entire change before she shows, any more than she does already, the effect of the long strain of the war." Agnes turned to answer some one else, who spoke to her. "Vernon," said Single abruptly, "I was told to-day, that young RantiDoll of Charleston claims to be the   AGNES WE NTWORTH.       3 sharp-shooter who did your business. Did you know it?" "I have heard it," replied Vernon. "Do you know him?" persisted Single. "I ought to," said Ernest, coloring through the transparent skin of a convalescent. (Rantipoll was his brother-in-law.) "There is another thing that ought to be known about it, however," he added. "I was just picking up a little Confederate drummer, who called on me for help. At the distance at which Ran- tipoll spied me, he might naturally enough think I was making prisoners." Vernon turned away; and Agnes returned eagerly. "Did I hear you telling something about Mr. Vernon?" asked she timidly of Single and me. Single opened his mouth:; but luckily my words came first "We were talking of a traitor of "a fellow who took aim at him.  You would not like to hear about that?" "Oh, no!"Her breath quickened; and she fanned herself. "Does Mr. Wentworth go abroad with you?" asked somebody else at her elbow. "No; we hoped that he would; but not even Italy can tempt him away from Boston; and he and my sister and brother will take care of one another here for the present." "I heard something else though, from the officer I was talking with to-day, which Mrs. Vernon will be interested in," resumed Single, getting the floor as soon as the querist yielded it. "Major Williams,-he was at the surrender of Charleston, you remember, Mr. Foxton?"- 26  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7379-00000153"/> 302      A GNES!'ENT WORT1iI. "Perfectly." "Well-did Vernon ever tell you about it, Agnes?" "' No. Ill fact, I never quite knew whether he was there or not. A mail-baig was lost just then; there was a break between his letters; and I never ventured to ask him." "Well,' repeated Single, "as I stood at the foot of the steps of the Somerset Club, this morning, just shaking hands with the Major, Vernon drove by in a coach. ' By George,' said Williams,-' there went Sir Beaumayns! I never expected to see him again!' ' Sir what, Williams?' said I. ' What a humorist you always were for pseudonyms! That was Ernest Ver- non, the great rising artist of the day.' ' You don't mean so!' said the Major. ' Well, I must have made a mistake then, I suppose; but he is the very twin- brother of one of our ambulance men, that I saw the day we took possession of Charleston. A noble-look- ing fellow he was too,' said the Major, 'standing with his broad-brimmed hat slouched over his eyes, and his armns folded, leaning against the charred post of a porch. A party of what, for want of better, pass for ladies down there--fine-looking women enough, too,--looked as if they knew how to behave better if they chose,- ther were dividing, their attention impartially between reviling him and packing their goods and chattels into one of his ambulances. If that's all the thanks they've got for you,' says the Major, ' why don't you leave them and their duds to take care of themselves?' The man, or gentleman, looked as if he had a great mind to work off the irritation by knocking Williams down; but he thought better of it, and only showed   AG NES WENTWORTH.       303 him a pass from Sherman, authorizing Mrs. Somebody or other with her daughters to be removed with their effects to a place of safety. ' Well, you know your own business, and how to keep your own counsel, I see,' said the Major. The man bowed, helped the ladies in as politely as they would let him, while his myrmidons followed him on horseback but, by his orders, out of ear-shot; ' and after that,' said Williams, ' I always dubbed him in my memory Sir Beaumayns, after the patient knight in the Morte d'Arthur.'- Well," con- cluded Single, "thought I, 'you haven't made out your case against its being Vernon i' but I kept my opinion to myself." "I am so glad you did," said Agnes, with the tears in her eyes ; " and I know Mr. Foxton will do so too." And so I do. CHAPTER XL I. ONCE since then, I have seen Agnes and Ernest Vernon. It was last May-day. Walking, somewhat at a loss, down a long street in an Italian city, I was suddenly furnished with a clue to them by a magnifi- cent tenor voice which startled me by striking up, at no great distance, a few notes of a not unfamiliar air with the words, "Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light," etc. Following the music I camejust as it paused, to a con- ventual-looking gate. I rang; and my summons was answered by the primeval Tibbets, looking so ruefully  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7379-00000154"/> 30X4     AGNES WE TWI'ORTI. like old times and so queerly out .of place, that she made me feel like the unworthy and unfortunate "Frederick [who] leaves the land of France." Having executed with her venerable features that rare and difficult contortion which stood her in stead for a smile, she informed me that "Mr. an' Miss Vernon was engaged to mornin'-callers, but would be to home to" me. She led me along a cloister, running around an antique garden with a sun-dial at one end and a fountain at the other, and knocked at a door. It was opened; and, through the vine which drooped over it, I had a vision of a transfigured Agnes. Greet- ing me with a frank, cordial, light-hearted dignity, which became her infinitely, she thrust a hand, moulded like a statue's and tinted like tropical shells, pearly white without and rose-color within, through the thick veil of leaves, to hold it up for my entrance, and turning her head over her magnificent shoulder, cried, "Ernest, here is a gentleman you will be so glad to see!" By the time I was clear of the vine, he had freed himself likewise from his palette and brushes, and was coming up in his velvet coat to shake both hands with me. He and his wife seemed like a boy and girl on a picnic. "Vernon," cried I, "how grandly you are looking --and painting! I don't know which to look at first, you or your walls,-" "or your wife," I could have added; for it is impossible for me to describe the change, -or perhaps I should rather say developement in her. She was blooming, brilliant, and radiant with the luxu- riant fulness of health of body and soul. The shade of   A GNES WENT WOR TII.      30,5 dejection and anxiety which, in her girlhood, often cast a suspicion of sickliness and premature age upon her young countenance, had given place to the lovely, in- spired expression of the fortunate artist,-as of one who sees something beautiful in the distance forever draw- ing nearer. Perhaps one-of the joys of heaven will be, that we shall there see everybody made the best of in the most favorable circumstances and under the happi- est influences. If so, then and there we may hope to see more women like Agnes. "We are as well as I hoped we should be," said Vernon, answering for both as if I had spoken of both. "Italy has set us up more than America had pulled us down. As for our painting, we neither of us find that we have lost anything by taking a partner, or by letting our canvas lie fallow as it did in the war. See here ; and he showed me a Titianesque, perfect little gem of a picture, to which Agnes was just putting the last touches, by order, for a little Norwegian prince; it was of Hans Christian Andersen's princess borne over the sea by the wild swans, her enchanted brothers. "Do you still find time for painting then, Mrs. Ver- non?" asked I, a little surprised. "Oh, yes," answered she, with a blush and a smile, "three or four hours a day at present,-and that is as much, we think, as is good for me. It is such second nature to me, that I should grieve sadly to give it up; and of course I must, if I ever discovered that it was putting in peril the health or spirits of my little dears' mamma.-You know Ernest and I always liked sim- ple ways of living best, and they save me time. Be- sides, there is a brownie in this studio; and when I 26*  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7379-00000155"/> 306,     AGNES WENTIWORTH. leave my picture, to see after our other affairs, and come back to it again, I often find it has grown. In- deed I often fancy, the more I leave it, the better for it. But I want you to see our little boy and girl presently." She went towards a glass-door opposite to the almost unused one by which I had entered. Meantime walking around the room with Vernon, I was pleased to see the compound cipher Xf in the co'- ner of several of the most striking of the pictures ; and he told me that Agnes usually sketched for him all his cherubs and children. I thought I could see besides what he did not tell me, that she had done for him much more than that-more than her sister had un- done,-by bringing hope, joy, and peace into his life. "But where is your Venus, Vernon?" said I; for I had heard a good deal of it. "In some ash-heap or other," returned he, looking into vacancy as if in search of it, and giving a pensive twirl to his moustache. "Burnt, was it? What a pity! How came that?" "I took the precaution to come in here, to look about, before I brought Agnes. When I came upon that beautiful demon again, I saw it with new eyes, and did not fancy the idea of seeinga her in the same room with it. They would have harmonized like rose-color and scarlet. Notwithstanding I give you my word that, when I painted it, I meant no mischief. I thought only of dramatic effect. However"-- "But could not you have sold it??' "Fast enough now-a-days; but you seem not to un- derstand, Foxton. What my wife would have shrunk from, it was not for me to set before the eyes of other   AGNES 'WENTWORTH.        30T women; and what was no fit household goddess for me would have done no good in the home of any fellow- man " Then, recollecting myself, I did understand. It was a case of cutting off the right hand that might have offended, if not one's-self, one's neighbor. Mrs. Vernon who was standing, waiting probably for a pause in our chat, at the glass-door, now beckoned to me. I came to her and looked through it. A cur- tain on the other side was looped back, so as to afford us a view of two superb two-year-old children, with a strangely familiar expression in their new little faces, pic- turesquely asleep together on a tiger-skin, "Agnes and Walter,' murmured the young mother, in a tone that made the words seem a caress, and with all the sweet- ness of maternity hallowing her fair countenance; " does not that sound like old times? We do not like to have them further away, on account of a dreadful accident that happened to the poor little baby-boy of-of a rela- tion of ours. They breakfast with us, and then play in the garden, and have their luncheon and nap here, under Nurse's charge. When they wake, or soon after, I go to them. ' Nothing rests one so much as watching . pretty little children at their play," added she with the simplicity of full conviction. "' One,' --no doubt," thought I, as I watched the gaze she fixed upon them. "Does Nurse ' solemnize' them?" asked I, involun- tarily. "At her peril," answered Mistress Agnes, looking alike merry and royal. "Not she," added Vernon; "she used up all the  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7379-00000156"/> 308     AATES WENTWIORTH. discipline in making their mother good; she pets them like a grandmother." "She has actually imade two new wrinkles in the bridge of her nose, by practising smiles at them." a Here is another of our partnership pictures," said Vernon pointing to his easel. "I conjugally stole it from one of Mrs. Vernon's magic scrap-books; and I had my punishment; for it is so extremely horrid,- to borrow a lady's word,-that she had to sit by me by the hour while I was working it up, with her hand on mly shoulder to keep me from shivering." I did not wonder. Vernon's drawing, though neither stolen nor borrowed, is akin to that of Kaulbach; his taste and sentiment are mnediaeval; his coloring is his own. In fact his peculiar strength lies-so at least other artists say--in what may be called the dramatic effect of color,--in the mastery of hues, and of the feelings and the fancy by means of them. All these qualifications of his had reached their highest achievement,-high- est, up to that time at least,-in the picture before me. It brought to sight the story--to my mind the most horrible in the whole Inferno,-told by Guido da Mon- tefeltro in the eighth pit,-the story of the penitent knave and knavish Franciscan, absolved by the pope, and seized by the fiend. In the background you saw the body of the dead monk, stark and stiff, girded with the cord and robed, stretched on a pallet in his cell. At his head behind him, a gorgeous great stained-glass window, --an anomaly, I suspected, but a fine one,-sowed spots of colored light about, and, as one felt rather than saw through the distance, gave him additional deathness   AGNES WENTWORTH.        309 by contrast. Another monk, with the Host, was just leaving him, having administered the last rites and se- cured-if forms could do it-his eternal salvation. In the foreground, writhing with despair, knelt the naked soul St. Francis, duly come down for it and hovering in the air at its right hand, held out to it the holy rood-in vain 1 For, at its left, was the nearer "black cherub" half risen through the stone-paved floor, braving the saint, even while shrinking away from the cross behind the victim, but dragging hint backward and downward by the hair. The trans- parent topaz light above and around the noble and venerable figure of St. Francis, and the sulphurous flamy blue, creeping through the floor below and around the mocking avenger, were insensibly and mysteriously blended over the form of the lost, into a greenish ghastliness that made one's blood run cold. The black-letter motto raised upon the ready frame, that stood by, was of course, "Assolver non si pub chi non si pente; N6 pentere e volere insieme puossi." "A good lesson, isn't it," said Yernon, "for these papists round us? We may say to their eyes some things that we must not to their ears." "A good lesson for' them? Yes, and for some of us Protestants at home too. My dear friends, what en- viable creatures-and creators-you are I . "Most enviable indeed," echoed Vernon, for very pleasure at the truth of my exclamation, making fun of it; "orders come in faster than we can fulfil them."  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7379-00000157"/> 310     AGNES WENTWORTIE "And how do the critics do now-a-days, you walk- inl sensitive-plant?'"I knew; or I should not have asked hinm. "They treat us better than we deserve.-Fortunate for some of us too, isn't it, Agnes? 'It is so bad for people to be angry!' " "Oh, Mr. Foxton," cried Agnes, coloring and laugh- ing as she parried this home-thrust, "who, do you think, is Ernest's most enthusiastic admirer?" "My lself. " "No; that very Mr. Maulstick." "What?-your Carnifex?" "Precisely," said Vernon. "How did you convert him?" said I to Vernon. "He grew famous," said Agnes drily, answering for him. "Agnes has never forgiven Maulstick, though, to this day," said Vernon, teasing her. (They called each other by their Christian names to me, because I knew them both so well, and her from childhood.) "Now, Ernest! You know that I forgive him some- thn, every time he comes." "BraLa!" cried I; " and pray what was the last- occasion of your clemency?" "He congratulated me on Ernest's marvellous im- provenment since his first pictures were exhibited in America, and mentioned his Isabella and Columbus as a fine specimen of his second manner." "He had forgotten it?" "If you can conceive of such a thing,-yes!" said Agnes, evidently incapable herself of any such con- ception.   AGNES WE1NTWORTH.       3" "If I had not scowled at my liege-lady in a manner that has since served her for a brace or two of bandits, I believe she would have confronted the poor fellow with the facts, then and there," said Vernon. "Certainly I should. However, I was glad after- wards that I did not. Ernest wants no aid, thank heaven; but there are struggling artists who do; and Mr. Maulstick is rich and generous, and very happy now to take his opinions ready made from Mr. Vernon, and to act accordingly. Under proper direction, I believe he does a great deal of good. It would have been throwing away influence very foolishy, if I had offended him." Excusing herself for a moment, she presently returned, looking like Ceres, laden with bread, fruit, and violet- scented Capri for us, each the best of its kind, and all served with that picturesque and dainty simplicity which was an instinct with her. When we had taken them from her, and helped her and ourselves, she began, hesitating a little about asking what she wanted to know, even of me, "'Mr. Foxton,-I hear from Rosa- mond every fortnight. She writes cheerfully, but- have you seen her lately?" "Within a week of my sailing. -It is always a pleasure, in itself, to see her; and then I thought it would make you more glad to see me. She never ap- peared to more advantage, nor Mr. Single either. In fact, I think they go on from good to better,--as most of us should do, and--don't." "Wentworths make good wives," said Vernon. "She is happy then," Agnes at last ventured Iaii;;kly  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7379-00000158"/> 312      A GNES W1ENT WOR TI. to ask. "In spite of their misfortunes, she is really happv?" I could not venture upon asserting quite so much as that. In fact, part of poor Miss Berry's pros- pective epitaph* upon herself reads to me like a pro- phecy of poor Rosamond Single. Therefore I did what I could to assume the elderly and paternal: "My dear young friend," replied I, "I have lived rather longer than you; but I have not chanced to meet with many people who were happy, as you and Mr. Vernon are happy. Mrs. Single's lot in life seems to me to be considerably above the average; and she appears to make the most of it. She is very much oc- cupied, very useful, and very much beloved. Hier little daughllters are as pretty as her little daughters ought to be, and as well-behaved as they are pretty; and, as for Mr. Single, it is strange to behold such an old bachelor, as he was growing, so intimate with a wife. But after all, philosophize as we may, the gratification of our natural tastes is no inconsiderable ingredient in tlhe happiness of this world. I never saw people with a stronger natural taste than theirs for the pleasures of wealth; and I hardly imagine that she did by nature incline to needle-work or nursery-work, or he to read- ing other persons' proofs or revising their manu- scripts." Agnes sighed.   "How fortunate it is, however," said she recovering herself, " that he is so well fitted for the business! He took the best lessons which were to be had, when he was at Cambridge, that he might * See Note.   AGNES WENTWORTH.        313 correct for himself the history he meant to write. Poor Horace!"            . "He told me that Mrs. Single took much interest in helping him," -said I; "and that her aid was very valuable to him, on account of her stronger eyes. ' "On account of her truer taste in style, I should think it might be still more so," said Vernon. I did not think it necessary to state, that I doubted whether Single would recognize the latter advantage. But I have often noticed, that men's estimate of the in- tellects of women was curiously in direct ratio as their own amount of intellect. "Rosamond always had a certain taste for hard work,"7 added Agnes. "She writes me wold that both of my little nieces show a remarkable ear for music; ,and that she is determined to have them thoroughly trained, in both the art and the science, for giving les- sons in it, and to make no secret of the object, so that no false shame may stanlCd ill the w\,t if they ever want work or wages." Then we talked of Mr. Wentworth's green old age which, blighted for a tim'e by the death of his son, was finding a new spring in the cherishing of .his little grandchildren, and then of Ernest's and Agnes's return to Boston, in the course of five or six years, to bring up the new Agnes and Walter as American citizens; and then, in spite of many kind dissuasions, unwill- ingly I took tny leave. As I walked away, I made a number of striking and original reflections, as, for example, that " l'homme pro- pose, et Dieu dispose:"Rosamond and Horace Single, 27  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7379-00000159"/> 311      AGNES WENT WORTH. seeking in marriage merely selfish pleasure, had lost it, and in losing it had found a better thing, namely, mutual affection; while Agnes and Ernest Vernon, seeking in wedlock only one another's hearts, had won besides prosperity and fame.

ILLUSTRATED WITH NUMEROUS WOOD ENGRAVINGS.- IN TEN' VOL UMES ROYAzL OCTAVO. PRICE PER VOL., CLOTH, $4.50; SHEEP, $5.00; HALF TURKEY, $5.50. The Publishers have the pleasure of announcing that they have just issued the concluding PART OF CHAMBERS'S ENCYCLO- PAEDIA, and that the work is now complete in TEN ROYAL OCTAVO VOLUMES, of over 800 pages each, illustrated with about 4000 engravings, and accompanied by- AN ATLAS OF NEARLY FORTY MAPS (sold separately), the whole, it is believed, forming the most complete work of refer- ence extant. The design of this work, as explained in the Notice prefixed to the first volume, is that of a DICTIONARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWL- EDGE FOR THE PEOPLE-not a mere collection of elaborate treatises in alphabetical order, but a work to be readily consulted as a DIC- TIONARY on every subject on which people generally require some distinct information. Commenced in 1859, the work is now brought to a close in 1868, and the Editors confidently point to the Ten volumes of which it is composed as forming the most COMPREHEN- srvE-as it certainly is the CHEAPEST-ENCYCLOPAEDIA ever issued in the English language. COPIES OF THE WORK WILL BE SENT TO ANY ADDRESS IN THE UNITED STATES, FREE OF CHARGE, ON RECEIPT OF THE PRICE BY THE PUBLISHERS. J. B.
