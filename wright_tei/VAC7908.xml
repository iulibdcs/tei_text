The stories of which this little book is made up are not new. They were writ- ten, most of them, many months ago, amidst the duties of the stage and the tear- fullrealities of domestic desolation-of which it behoves me not to speak-and published as they were written in the columns of different journals, where they met with a circulation probably more than equal to their merits, and with a favor certainly beyond my' expectations. They are simple stories simply told, and the only merit the writer presumes to claim for them is, that they are the children of fact, not fancy. This, and this alone, is the only consideration which could have induced me to put them before the world in their present form. Trusting that this little volume may contribute in some degree to the enter- tainment of such as may favor it-with a perusal, and that its publication may re- sult in a matter of modest profit to the writer, it is respectfully submitted to the patronage of the public.

Early in the fall of 1855, while traveling through the Southern mines of California, I was accidentally detained at a small settlement a few miles from the city of Mariposa. It was just past te dinner hour when we arrived, but the good-natured landlady informed me that she would prepare the best meal she could under the circumstances. The rain was -w pouring down in torrents, and I was much pleased, upon entering the neat little parlor, to find a cheerful fire blazing upon the hearth. Two ladies were seated near a window, busily engaged in needle-work. They both arose as I entered, bade me good afternoon, and begged me to be seated near the fire. In a few moments the "lady of the house" made her appearance and informed me that dinner was ready. I followed her into the dining-room, dispatched my meal and a gn returned to the parlor. There I found another added to the number. It was a gentle- man. After receiving an introduction to him I seated myself and listen- ed to the pleasant conversation. This gentleman was a tall, finely proportioned man, and evidently well educated and well calculated to please. The afternoon wore pleasantly away, and tea was announced. In the evening the landlady, together with the husbands of the two former ladies, joined the pleasant circle. After discussing-freely upon several topics, the conversation turned upon the unfortunate in Califor- nia, or at least upon those who had been rendered so by coming here. "I think," said Mr. Billings, (our pleasant companion of the after- noon,) "that I can tell you of a case which accidentally and rather ro- mantically came under my observation some ten months since; and," he continued, "if it would be agreeable to the company, -I shall take plea- sure in relating the circumstances." "I think," answered the landlady, "we should all be delighted." A  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7908-00000004"/> 6            THE TWO WIVES. Each gave a nod of assent and a smile of approval, and he began as follows: "At the period I mention, I was one evening, about an hour after dark, passing down one of th4 principal streets of Sacramento, when suddenly my attention was attracted towards a tall, graceful woman who was .leading by the hand two little boys. The youngest, I should think, was about five years of age; the eldest perhaps seven. "The beautiful tones of her voice first drew my attention, and as she passed a lighted saloon I took the liberty of peeping into her face. If her graceful carriage and silver-toned voice had excited my curiosity, her pale, sorrowful, intellectual countenance fully completed it. The desponding though gentle tones with which she responded to the innocent prattle of her children, told plainly that she had seen better days. -Who was she, and why was she in the street after dark, with no companion save those little boys? .Of course there was no harm in this, but where was her natural protector-the father of her boys? Was he dead, and she a widow? Or did she belong to that other class of unfortunate women styled grass-widows, who, unlike the real widow, whose privilege it is to chose another protector, must bear alone the cold reverses of fortune and meekly submit to the taunts and jeers of the low and vulgar, who everywhere through life beset her pathway? "Thus I went on cogitating, and endeavoring to form some idea of the circumstances that surrounded this unknown woman. By this time they had reached a fruit-store, and the youngest boy directed his mother's attention to some fine clusters of grapes that were exposed for sale. "'Oh, mother, do buy some of them-won't you?  Little Charlie Smith gave me one to day, and it was so sweet!' "'Hush! darling,' said the lady, 'mamma don't know whether she can spare the money to buy them or not. I will see how much I have left after I get brother's shoes.' "This was spoken in an under tone, and intended only for the ear of the child, but her accents were so clear and distinct that by listening attentively I caught them also. This convinced me that she and her children were victims to that iron-handed tyrant-poverty; but through what means was still a mystery, and for aught I knew at the time, was likely so to remain. Curiosity suggested to me to follow her and lascer- tain the locality of her residence, but politeness forbade it; for, thought I, she may discover me and think me an impertinent fellow, whose de- sign was to insult her. I would gladly have shared the'contents of my purse with her had an opportunity offered, but I saw no chance of assisting her or gratifying the desires of her children, so I turned and walked a few steps in an opposite direction; then again turning, I watched her until she was beyond my sight. I then walked slowly and thoughtfully to the hotel, lit a cigar and ascended to my room. "During the early part of the night my sleep was disturbed; Hbecame restless, and every time I fell into a dose the figure of a tall, pale lady, with'a sweet though mournful voice, was near me. I dreamed I saw her return to the fruit-stand, inquire the price of the grapes, and then,   THE TWO WIVES.            7 drawi ng forth a little port-monaie containing two twenty-five cent pieces, say, with a deep diawn sigh-' Tis all I have, and Heaven only knows where I shall get more--but they must have some grapes, the poor little things!' Then turning to the salesman I thought she said--'I will take a bits worth.' ,I found it was impossible for me to sleep, with such visions for my companions. I arose, dressed myself and walked forth into the street, determined not to retire again until I felt sufficiently wearied to require  rest. The next morning I took my departure for one of the interior mining towns, for the purpose of attending to some quartz mining busi- ess, and there, amid the cares and anxiety of a miner's life I had al- most or quite forgotten the adventure with the unknown lady, and several months passed ere I again visited the city of Sacramento. When 1 did return I was so much engrossed with the importance of my busi- ness that even there it did not enter my head.  "One afternoon a. few weeks after my return to the city, I was stand- ing in front of the hotel where I was stopping, wrapped in deep thought and tr ing to lay plans for the future, when the voice of a child caused ne to looked around, and to my surprise I beheld the self-same little boys standing before me. '(Can you tell me, if you please, sir,' said the eldest, 'where T can find Dr. Blake's office? My mother is very sick, and I amn afraid she will die defore I get back!' His eyes told plainly that he had been weeping bitterly. "'Who is with your inother!' I asked. 'No one, replied the boy; 'she is alone.-Ohl do tell me where I can find the doctor, won'tyou?' cI reimembered seeing the name of the doctor upon one of the doors of the hotel; so I took the little fellow and started in search of him. We were not long in finding the room; and, fortunately the doctor was in. The boy told him of his mother's illness. "'Vaerv well' said the doctor, 'run home; I will follow in a moment.' "They st:arted off; meanwhile the doctor arose, put on his boots and coat, and, cane in hand awaiting my exit, to give him an opportufty of fastening the door. I hesitated a moment, and then said; 'Do tor I should like to go with you, if you will pass me as your friend. I nave seen these children before, and I think I know their mother.'  "He gave his consent, and in less than ten minutes we were b the bed-side of the sufferer, who was apparently in a dying condion. A deathly paleness overspread her -countenance; the teeth were clenched, and froth was oozing from her mouth; her limbs were col and stiff. The children had informed me correctly, their mother ,sne.. "I was in a strange house and had not been introduced to its occupant; still, my judgnelut told me this was no time to stand upon ceremony. J" 'Doctor,' I said, 'what can I do to assist you?' "'Take this prescription,' he replied, 'and go as fast as possible to the nearest druggist, and, for Heaven's sake! do not stop a moment; for her life may depend upon your dispatch. I did not await further orders, but proceeded to the store, obtained the medicine, and returned with it and handed it to the doctor.  A  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7908-00000005"/> 8            THE TWO WIVES. "'Now,' said he 'you must go into the kitchen, make a fire, and put a boiler of water on to heat. So, down I went, found the kitchen, (or Was shown there by one of the boys,) did as the doctor desired me; then went up to receive further orders. 'Find two large bottles' said he 'and when the water boils, fill them and bring them up.' By this time the perspiration'was pouring like a river; so throwing off all restraint, I threw off my coat and vest, wiped my face, and proceeded to business.- When they were filled, I took them up. The doctor placed them near her feet. Our combined exertions had the desired effect. She began to slowly recover,and ere two hours had passed, we had the pleasure of seeing her open her eyes and hearing her voice. I say we, for I bad borne a good share of the trouble, and why -should I not participate in the pleasure? I have no doubt but that she felt a degree of surprise, upon recovering, to find a strange person in her private room, in his shirt sleeves I made some stammering excuse, and decended to the kitchen for the purpose of putting on my coat and vest. The doctor came dowi also. He asked me if I knew the lady? I informed him that I thought I had met her somewhere, but was not personally acquainted with her. "'I wish,' he' continued, 'that you would remain with her until I can send some one to take care of her.' "How long will you detain me?' asked I, 'for I have an engagement at six, and must be at leisure to fulfil it at that hour.' "'I shall send some one to relieve you long ere that,' he replied smiling. "Well then doctor you must go up and introduce me to her.' "We were proceeding up the stairs; when he suddenly turned and said "'You forget that I have never been introduced to you, and consequent- ly am ignorant of your name.' "Billipgs, I said, supressing a laugh that was forcing itself upon me, in spite of the seriousness of the occasion. The doctor also smiled;. then, assuming an air of gravity, he again entered the sick chamber, and the introduction took place. He then left, promising to send an old lady, who resided a short distance from the city. I must confess I felt rather awkward, acting in the capacity of nurse to a lady I had not known an bhohr. However, I put the best face on the matter, and began a conver- sation by asking if she was subject to such attacks? She answered that she had been for several months, and attributed the cause to being so much alone. She stated that she had been accustomed to mingle in gay society, and that since her arrival in California, she had missed the cheerful circle that was wont to greet her in her former home. "At this moment the old woman whom the docter had sent, made her appearance. I arose to bid the patient good-day, when she politely - invited me to call again. I told her I should do myself that pleasure, and took my leave. "The next morning I called again, and found her much recovered. She was sitting in her parlor reading the morning paper, and as I en- tered she smiled and bade me good morning. The little boys came running in to greet me. I was happy to find her so far restored, for I had made up my mind to ascertain, if possible, something regarding her past history, for to tell the truth I was more than half in love with her.   THE TWO WIVES.            9 Agreeably to my expectations, I learned before I left, from her lips the following story. "'I was brought up' said she, 'by a wealthy aunt, who resided in the city of Baltimore. My every wish was studied and gratified as soon las learned. At the age of seventeen I became attached to a young gentle- man, whose visits were disagreeable to the family. He was politely told to come io more. He obeyed the command, still we met clandestinely. He proposed an elopement-I consented.  A day was appointed; we left the city of Baltimore-took passage in the cars for Philadelphia, and on arriving there were married. The following morning he started for New York, where my husband informed me he had made arrange- ments to enter into business.' "Three years of unalloyed happiness passed. I had no cause to regret the step I had taken. My husband was kind and affectionate, and provided liberaly for my wants. But strange to say, that during that period I never knew, the nature of his business; true I had upon several occasions inquired the locality of his place of business, and each time he made some evasive answer and I thought no more upon the subject. "My, eldest boy was about two years old, the youngest three months, when one day their father came home and said to me, 'Augusta, I must leave you for a while; I am going to California, and as soon as I make money enough, I will return or send for you.' (Those words,are fami- liar to the ears of many a heart broken wife.) I threw my arms about his neck and burst into tears; they were the first bitter tears I had ever shed.' 'Oh, you will not leave me, dear Charles-what will become of me if I am left without your protection? Have I not forsaken every friend for you? Have you not been my only compaion for three years, and you will not forsake me now! oh, take me with you. I will go in the capacity of a servant to some family, anything rather than .be left be- hind.' I called his attention to the children. He took the babe; held it to his bosom, and the tears flowed down his manly cheeks. 'I never saw you weep before, dearCharles. Why will you bring'so much un- happiness upon us?' 'Augusta,' he said, 'it must be so. I have had an excellent, offer, and one that will prove profitable to both. I shall not be absent more than one year. I will either return or send for you in that time.' I found all entreaties in, vain, so I said no more, but set silently though sorrowfully, to work to make preparations for his jour- ney. The day arrived for the sailing of the ship that was to bear my husband to a strange land. All the morning my tears would flow in spite of all my efforts to suppress them. Charles saw the depth of my grief, and I knew his heart repented the step he had taken, for he loved me. Yes, I believe he loved me truly and sincerely. The hour for parting came, but I will pass it over, it was too sacred, too sorrowful to dwell upon-'twas passed and I was left alone. Time, the tedious tell-tale to the anxious heart, crept slowly on; days seemed weeks, weeks swelled into months; at length the happy, long-looked for day came, and with it a letter. It stated that my husband had arrived safely-his brightest hope; had been realized,-and he promised to send me means by the next steamer. True to his word, the next steamer  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7908-00000006"/> 10           THE TWO WIVES. brought me a check for five hundred dollars. Each mail brought let- ters and frequently money. In all his letters he told me how much more he loved me than he had ever thought he could love any woman. This pleasant correspondence was kept up for over one year, when to my dis- appointment and surprise a mail arrived and brought no news for me. However, I comforted myself with the hope that he had written and his letter had been mislaid through the carelessness of others. I waited anxiously for the next steamer. It arrived, and with it a letter for me. But, oh heaven! how changed was its tone from the former ones. It briefly stated that he was so closely confined to business, that it would be impossible for him to write as often as formerly. I received several of these cold, indifferent letters. At length they ceased altogether. I wrote him by every steamer begging him to come home-called to his mind his promises to send for me; appealed to him through our children, but all to no purpose. I could get no answer. Sometimes I thought that perhaps he had died, and the thought almost drove me to madness. "I had become acquainted with several very pleasant and genteel families, and to them I told my sorrow and asked the benefit of their advice. They all joined in advising me, to follow him. I did so. Af- ter settling up all my affairs I started with my children for the port of San Francisco. When I arrived I made immediate inquiry respecting my husband. The proprietor of the hotel where I was stopping, in- formed me that he knew but one Charles Webb; that he was a married man, and had been for several months. He said he married an actress, and he believed that he was then traveling with her through the interior of the State. Oh this could not be my Charles-oh, nol I could not be- lieve it. He then said he would make further inquiry, and let me know the result. Next morning he called at my door, and informed me that the Charles Webb who had married the actress was then stopping in the city of Sacramento, and added, that he would advise me to take the boat that evening, go up to Sacramento and satisfy myself whether it was my husband or not. I acted upon his advice, and arrived there early the next morning in company with my children. I visited the hotel where I had been informed he was stopping. I took a seat in the parlor,and awaited the return of the servant who had gone to his room to tell him that a lady wishdto se him. I was not long kept in suspense, for in a few moments Charles Webb stood before me. My first impulse was to grasp him by the throat and never let go my hold until he had ceased to breathe 'But when he said 'Why, Gussy ' the voice seemed so familiar, so kind, that it changed all feeling of revenge. The old affection which I had cherished for years, sprang up afresh. I fell upon his bosom and wept like a child. The trial had been too much for me-I fainted. "When I awoke a slender form was bending over me, and a sweet face smiled as I gazed upon it. A soft, white hand smoothed my aching brow. Charles was standing near the sofa upon which I reclined. The children had been taken from the room by a servant, to purchase toys. I looked for some moments, first at one and then the other. The silence seemed painful to all. The young woman was the first to speak. "' Dear Charles,' she said, in the most tender and loving tones, 'who is this lady? Is she your sister?   THE' TWO WIVES.           " "Sister! sister!" cried I; "no; not his sister, but his wife-the mother of his boys; and if he has dared to wrong me let him tremble!" "Charles looked as though a thunderbolt had descended from heaven and struck him. It was the first time he had ever witnessed in me the slightest display of angry passion. "Yes," I continued, "let him tremble; for by the heaven above us, he shall not live-his life-blood alone shall pay the forfeit!"And as I uttered these words, I sprang from the sofa and caught the girl by the arm, who stood pale and trembling, like a frightened fawn. "Who are you, and why are you here with this man?" "That man!" repeated she, and pointing toward Charles; "why, he is my husband. Ohl do not harm him," said she, falling upon her knees. "Ohl spare him. I will give him up. I will quit him-never see him again; but for the love of heaven do not kill him. He is not to blame; it was all my fault. I loved him so deeply, so madly Oh let fall your ven- geance upon me, but for God's sake do not injure him!" "All this was spoken with so much earnestness-so much real feeling -that I was at once convinced of her innocence and his guilt. Her appeal had awakened all the sympathies of my nature, and I pitied her from my heart. Yes, I pitied her and hated him. ,  "I took the fair girl gently by the hand and raised her. For a few moments I gazed upon her; she was fair and beautiful, and seemingly about eighteen years of age. Such beauty-such innocence, to be so base- ly betrayed And as I stood thus gazing upon her, I felt that all the love I had ever cherished for Charles Webbhad turned to hate. I thought of him with loathing and disgust. Then turning again to her I said- 'Take him and be happy while you can, for the time will come when you will find him unworthy the deep love you now evince for him. Re- member my words, and let them be a warning.' Then advancing to- wards him, I thus addressed him--'Charles Webb you are at liberty to go where you please, do as you please; I will never molest or annoy you. You are now beneath my revenge-fallen so low in my-estimation with- in the last hour, that you have become unworthy even of my hate; and the only feeling I now entertain for you is contempt; take it-it is all I have to offer you; we part forever. I have but two requests to make: the first is that you treat this girl with kindness-love her, cherish her with4wtler regard, and protect her. I believe she is every way worthy of a better fate than that which has so unluckily befallen her; and as you value your happiness here and your soul's safety hereafter, do not abuse or forsake her. The second request I have to make is, that you will never mention my name, or those of my children.' He made no reply-what his feelings were I could not even guess; nor will I attempt to describe my own. I gave one look of pity to the poor, deluded crea- ture who was clinging to him, and murmured to myself: 'Oh, may you never feel the pang that rends my disturbed bosoml' Then taking my children by the hand, I hurried from the. house. "'After quieting the storm that was raging within my breast, I called at the office of a lawyer, stated my case and made application for a di- vorce. After many months I was pronounced free from the man whom  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7908-00000007"/> 12           THE TWO WIVES. I had so long and so affectionately loved, and by whom I had been so basely deserted, with the privilege of the care and protection of my boys. 'And now,' said she, I am making every effort in my power to get means to return to the Eastern States. I have deprived myself of even the comforts of life to pay the cost of this suit, and as I can conceive no means by which I can gain an honest livelihood here, will return to New York, where it is much easier for a woman to make a living. I have found no friends in this country. The unfortunate find few everywhere, but I must say, without exception, California can boast of more cold- hearted, hardened and selfish women than the world combined. They pretend to look with holy horror upon a woman who sues for a divorce. When they themselves, perhaps, have been divorced and married in bet- ter circumstances. I have lived in this cottage for many months-have suffered much from illness, and yet there is not a lady in the neighbor- hood who has ever called upon me, or even enquired after my health. Now,' she added, 'that-I have been successful in obtaining my divorce, I have nothing further to seek in California. WhenrI leave, no tear will be shed at my departure; no smile of welcome raeet me on my return to my former home. My boys are now my only care, my only happiness, and if God will spare them to cheer my lonely path through life, I will be content, and never murmur at the destiny Fate seems to have mark- ed out for me.' I had been much interested in the story of Mrs. Webb, and if upon my first visit I had been, as I remarked, half in love with her, I was now head and ears enveloped in the tender passion. However, I had already spent too much time which should have been devoted to business, so I arose to take my leave, remarking as I did so, that 'I thought she might meet with some employment that would prove sufficiently lucrative for the support of herself and children.' 'I have thought, said she, 'that I might, perhaps, take a school. How do you think I should succeed in that?' 'I told her my opinion was that she might do very well, if not in the city, perhaps in some of the mining towns in the interior of the State. I then informed her that I had some business of importance to at- tend to-that I would call again the next day: in the meantime I would make some inquiries regarding the school question, and let her know the result upon my next visit. Then, bidding her good morning, departed." At this moment Mr. Billings drew forth his watch; we all waited in breathless anxiety for him to proceed with the story of Mrs. Webb.  "Well," said he, after a moment's pause, at the same time replacing his watch and stroking his chin, "I think I will let her finish the tale herself, for, if I am not mistaken, I hear the sound of the stage -coach approaching." Saying this he arose and left the room; the next mo- ment he returned leading by the hand a tall, graceful, brilliant Jooking lady. "Allow me," he said, "to introduce to you the heroine of my story. She is my wifel"A murmur of surprise burst from the lips of all present, while each arose to give her welcome. "Fie I William," she said, half playfully, half reproachfully, "have you been  telling my history again?" "Yes, Gussy," he said laughing, "I thought I would save you the trouble; and now,   THE TWO WIVES.           13 that the ladies are so well posted in regard to your past history, I will leave you to have a pleasant chat, while I take a quiet smoke in the bar-room. But, by-the-by," he continued, "how did you leave the boys? Were they content to remain at the school when you left?" "Oh, yes," she answered, "Charlie cried a little, but the children gathered around him and his attention was soon diverted by the many little voices that surrounded him." "I wonder if any one else cried," he said, and casting a sly glance towards Mrs. Billings, then imprinted a kiss upon her forehead, he said, "excuse me ladies, it is a weakness I have, and Gussy could'nt get along without, could you Gussy?" "Why, William," replied Mrs. B., "you ought to be ashamed, I thought you were going to take a quiet smoke?" "So I am, Gussy, so I am; but I couldn't think of leaving you without giving you that kiss, for I knew your next hour's happiness, depedcd upon it," said he as he passed out to the bar- room. "What a tease he is," remarked Mrs B., after he had closed the door. "You must excuse him, ladies," she added. After an hour's pleasant conversation, we were all convinced that Mrs. Billings possessed all the amiable qualities that her husband had claimed fdr her in her absence. After Mr. Billings had enjoyed his quiet smoke, as he termed it, he re- turned to the parlor. The night being far advanced we all retired. The next morning when I awoke I found the sun shining in its brightest rays. I arose. completed my toilet, and descended to the parlor, hoping to have an opportunity of seeing Mrs. Billings by daylight. I was doomed to dLsappointment; the fatigues of the previous day's journey had rendered it necessary that she should enjoy more than an ordinary share of rest. After partaking of a hasty breakfast, I bade good day to the landlady, took a seat in the stage coach, and was soon on my way to the city of Mariposa, well satisfied with the entertainment I had received at the way-side inn. *    :*c       *    *    *    *    * "Oh, God! will he never come!

And thou my little babel Heavenly Father! wilt Thou not take that, tool I cannot leave it to brave the scorn of the cruel world l" In a miserable hut on the outskirts of the city of Sacramento, dwelt the utterer of the foregoing sentences-who was no other than the poor victim of Charles Webb, the former husband of Mrs. Augusta Billings. Two years have passed since the scene occurred in the parlor of the hotel in Sacramento, between that man and his much-injured wife, when the latter gave utterance to those prophetic words--"Take him and be happy while you can, for the time will come when you will find him un- worthy the love and affection you now evince for him!" B g  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7908-00000008"/> "           THE TWO WIVES.  That time had come; and poor Millicent (for that was the name of the girl for whom he had so heartlessly deserted his noble wife and chil- dren) remembered those words to her sorrow. 'Tis true, she had not sinned, for she was ignorant, at the time of her marriage, of the exist- ence of a former wife; yet had she taken the warning so wisely given, she would not now have been a mother. But the deep and ardent pas- sion she cherished for the man who had so basely betrayed her, caused her to cling to him even after his guilt and unworthiness had become apparent; and now he had as basely deserted her-left her to die alone in want and poverty. The night upon which we introduce her to the reader as the occupant of this miserable habitation, she is upon the point of tarvation. The little babe for whom she was praying so fervently is tw( weeks old, and the unfeeling father has never looked upon its innocent face. He called but twice after its birth, and brought a man with him, whom he address- ed as Doctor, and who, after he felt her pulse, wrote a prescription, which was still lying upon the table. It was in the dreary month of December; the rain was pouring in torrents upon the almost roofless tenement. With what little strength she could gather during the afternoon, she had crept from her bed and had picked a few grains from a piece of dry salt fish that had been left hanging upon a nail by some former occupant. The effort had brought on a fever and slight delirium, and it would not have required a well practic- ed eye to have told that she was lingering upon the verge of the grave. She felt the fearful truth, and it was the knowledge of that which caus- ed her to send forth the prayers that God would take her little one, too. Scarcely had the petition reached the court of Heaveniere the innocent babe awoke from its slumbers, and its feeble cries told plainly that it was starving also. They3 sounded forth upon the stillness of the night, which was only broken by the fitful gusts of wind and the ceaseless fall- ing of the rain. Wail upon wail went forth, and was borne away upon - the storm and lost forever. They bring no aid to the sufferer, and the dying mother makes a feeble effort to press it to her bosom, but her strength has failed, and the death rattle is the only answer fo the tender infant's cries. For a few moments life seemed to have fled. Again she ' awakens from the death dream and makes an exertion to arouse her sinking energy, like the dying embers from which an occasional spark shoots forth and shows signs of remaining life, till one by one they die away and naught remains but the cold ashes. She drew the little thing nearer her breast. For a moment its cries were hushed, then they burst forth again, and told of disappointed ex- pectations. As if awakening to a full reality of her dreadful situation, she sprang from the bed and endeavored to reach the door. "Great God!" she cried, "and must I die alone, here in darkness! and must my helpless babe be left to starve beside its dead motherl Nol nol" she exclaimed; "I'll seek for aid; it must not, shall not be." The next mo- ment a wild scream of agony rang forth from this horrid scene, accom- panied by the cries of an infant, and the wretched, forsaken mother lay dead upon the floor.   THE TWO WIVES.           15 "Stop the horses, John; I am sure there must be something wrong passing in that cabin. That wild scream, and the cries of that infant betoken that all is not right." - These words were addressed to an Irish carriage driver by a lady whose carriage was, at that moment passing the house of the dying woman, on her way to the night-boat from San Francisco with the expectation of meeting her husband, who had been absent several months upon a visit to his Eastern home. John obeyed his mistress' command, and descended from his seat, for the purpose of making inquiry into the cause of the mystery that had so alarmed his mistress. " 'Tis lucky, mam," he said, "thatI brought a little bit of candle wid me, for by the powers, I believe there's- just as much darkness inside the house as out" "Do make haste," exclaimed the lady; "the babe will cry itself to death." By this time John had found the door, and knocked; but receiving no answer, he opened it and entered, then- drew a match across the box, and by its faint light discovered the lifeless form of Millicent. "Oh, madaml madaml" he exclaimed, "shure and there is a young woman lying here on the floor, and faith I believe she's dead entirely." Upon hearing these words, the lady sprung from the carriage, regard- less of the mud and water, and hastened to the house. By the assist- ance of John, she succeeded in placing the body of Millicent upon the bed; then, taking the little babe in her arms, endeavored to quiet its cries. In the meantime she told John to drive to the nearest house and bring some one to remain with her while he drove to the city for a phy- sician. He obeyed, and soon returned with a lady, who exhibited con- siderable surprise, upon entering, to find that the cabin had been occu- pied. "The poor creature seems young," she added, "and handsome; and I should think by the costly chain about her neck, that she has seen better days; and perhaps her name may be engraved upon it." As she said this, she removed it, and holding it near the candle, read aloud the name of Charles Webb. A slight scream escaped the lips of the first visitor, but instantly recovering herself, approached the speaker and taking the chain, examined it. A locket which was attached to it she found contained the likeness of that heartless man. The reader-will doubtless have guessed, long ere this, that the lady who first heard the cries was the former wife of Webb-now Mrs. Au- gusta Billings. For a moment she gazed upon the picture, then handing it back to the lady, she said: "I know this woman; this is the picture of her husband. The last time I saw him, he was in possession of a large amount of wealth, and I am at a loss to guess why we find her here in this home of poverty and want; but none of'us know what we shall come too, especially in this land of fire and flood. The motto of California should be, "We know not what a day may bring forth." A deep-drawn sigh told how deeply she felt the weight of her own remarks. She was still holding the infant in her arms, and the little innocent was sleeping as sweetly as if it were pillowed upon the breast of a fond mother, all'unconscious that it was now a helpless orphan-that no mother's smile would ever again beam upon it's infant face, and watch over its budding beauty.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7908-00000009"/> 16           THE TWO WIVES Mrs. Billings gazed upon it, and felt that Heaven had sent her there, and that henceforth it should be her duty to protect the child whose father she once so fondly loved.  "But where is he?" she silently qucs- tioned; but just then her musings were suddenly interrupted by the en- trance of the doctor.  We will pass over three days,' during which time Millicent had been laid in the silent grave, away from the storms that had o -fearifully wrecked her young hopes. Mr. Billings, who arrived on the niglt he had been expected, had made many inquiries concerning the where- abouts of Webb, but as yet the search had proved fruitless. A nurse had been engaged to take care of the babe, which had been adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Billings. The name of Pedia had been given her. As the rainy season was not yet passed, they had concluded to re- main at Sacramento for a month, then pay a visit to their boys, who were at school in Santa Clara. The little Pedia bid fair to become the pride of her adopted pa- rents' hearts, for every day they felt that she was entwining herself more closely around them. "What beautiful blue eyes this little pet has got," said Mr. Billings, one evening, as he held her to the lamp; " come here, Gussy. See see how she smilesl"  '                 I "Yes," replied Mrs. Billings, "I think she will resemble her mo- ther in beauty but Heaven forbid that her fate should resemble ithat unfortunate being1" "If we live, 'Gussy," said he, " she will never be exposed to the early temptations to which her mother must have been." "I know nothing of her history," replied Mrs. Billings, " previous to meeting her in this city. She was theni very young, and, as far, as I could learn, came to this country without a protector. Heaven grant," she added, "that our lives'-may be spared to see this child happily married, or, at least, safely under the protection of her brothers. "Dear William," she continued, "you cannot think with how much real pleasure I look forward to the time when they shall learn that they have, an adopted sister. How delighted they will be, for they were always so fond of little girls."  Such conversation often took place between this happy pair. Hap- py did I say? Yes, they were happy, except that occasionally Mrs. Billings would silently murmur. "Where is he? What has been his fate?" It was perfectly natural, notwithstanding she had long since ceased to love her unfeeling husband, that she should still feel a desire to know something of his fate. Such thoughts would intrude themselves at times, and disturb the happiness which otherwise might have been undimmed. The time to which 'Mr. Billings had limited their stay in the citylhad nearly expired. i' What time shall we start for Santa Clara, William?" said Mrs. Billings, one bright morning. "To-morrow," love," he replied; "and after our visit to the school we'll hie us to our mountain home, there to enjoy the fragrance of the   THE TWO WIVES.           17 flowers, the music of the birds, and the pure untainted air of Heaven, and live in each other's love. For you know," he added, laughing, "we have promised each other to be lovers all our days." Then im- printing a kiss of affection upon her lips, he hurried from the apart- ment to make some additional preparations for their intended journey. The next week found this happy family in their quiet mountain home. May peace and happiness attend them l On a lone hill-side, with nought save a rough slab to mark the grave, rests the body of Charles Webb An honest miner, whose cabin was not far distant from the spot, related to me his sad history and un- happy end. He had followed gambling for years, but as he had been unfortunate in gaming, he became' desperate, joined a band of robbers, and during the well-remembered Tom Bell excitement, had been shot by a party who were in pursuit. Shakspeare has said, truly: "There is no art to find the mind's con- struction in the face;" for Charles Webb had been beloved and re- spected by all who knew him, but in an evil hour he yielded to tempta- tion, lost his self-respect, and the respect of his friends, and at last sunk into a dishonorable grave. Let those who would escape such a death, avoid the gambling-room. ROSATIE IRVING, OR, LIFE SCENES IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK. IT was a fine day, and one of great excitement to the inhabitants of the city of New. York. There were thousands of human beings passing and repassing, each apparently unmindful of the thoughts and feelings of the others. On that day the same feelings and thoughts agitated the minds of many, for it was on the evening of that day that the great French actress, Rachel, was to make her first appearance before an American public. In a small back basement sat two human beings-a man and a wo- man-for poverty had robbed them of the title of gentleman and lady; that is, as the term is generally applied in modern society. The man was stretched on a plain, neat bed, and had fallen into a sleep. Near a window sat a pale woman. Large drops of perspiration stood upon her beautiful brow. Occasionally her dark eye cast a glance towards the little bed in one corner, where slept her darling babe; she would have kissed his rosy cheeks, but she did not even dare to breathe aloud,  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7908-00000010"/> 18           ROSALIE IRVING. for fear-of waking him from his slumbers. She looked upon the little clock which hung against the wall, and unconsciously exclaimed aloud, "So latel" This awoke the husband; he started up, saying: "Dear Rosalie, you are killing yourself; do stop for a little while, and take something to eat." "Oh, no, dear George," " this dress must be finished by six o'clock." and you forget," said Rosalie, " the rich do not want to be kept in sur- pense; she must have it at six; it is now nearly four." "Do stop, and eat something; you have not eaten anything since breakfast; you must be faint-"  Oh, no; I shall have a good appetite when the dress is finished," she replied, " and when I have'taken it home." Poor Rosalie I She knew well why she had not eaten since breakfast; she had nothing to eat. She had managed to fix something for her husband, by pouring some hot water over a few stale crusts, and sweet- ening them. His hunger had been satisfied. She succeeded in quiet- ing his fears about herself, and went on finishing the dress, which was to bring her four dollars. With that she would pay the rent for one week, get a little sign painted, with "DRESS-MAKING AND PLAIN SEW- ING " inscribed on it, and also furnish her store of edibles. How her heart beat as she folded the dress, put it into a newspaper and started to take it home  I have given above a slight description of the humble abode of Ro- salie Irving, and will now shift the scene to a beautiful residence in Bleeker street. In an elegant apartment, furnished with every lu:ury, and surrounded by everything to make life happy, sat the proud and imperious Mrs. Marion Hyde. She looked at her watch, and then thrust it into her pocket. She then impatiently rang the bell; a ser- vant entered, exclaiming- "Did you ring, madam?" "Yes, John;" has that woman come with my dress? It is five minutes past six; I told her to bring it home by six, precisely. Do you know her address?" "No, madam, I do not; but I think I can find out." "Well, if the woman does not come soon, I will send you for her." John bowed respectfully, and left the room. "This comes of being good-hearted," said Mrs. Hyde. If I had in- sisted upon her staying here and finishing it, I should have been spared all this unnecessary suspense. The woman said something about a sick husband, and I dare say she has children, top, and probably some of them have been taken sick, or had a fall; consequently, I shall be dis- appointed; and if I am, I am sure I shall be sick a whole week. Every- thing has transpired to give me trouble in regard to going to-night. In the first place, Mr. Hyde could not let me have a hundred dollars, because, he said, he-had bills to pay, just as if my disappointment was not of as much importance as that of any other person. When I did get the material for the dress, Mrs. Jones, my dress-maker, must be so busy that she found it impossible to make mine; she then recommended to me this Mrs. Irving, who, she said, had worked for her."   ROSALIE IRVING.          19 As Mrs. Hyde was enumerating her trials the door bell rang, and in a moment Rosalie stood before her. "Mercy l" exclaimed Mrs. Hyde, "why did you keep me waiting so long? I thought you would never come." "It is only twenty minutes past six," said Rosalie; "I had a long distance to walk." "Walkl replied Mrs Hyde; "why did you not ride? There are stages running in every direction, and you can ride any distance for sixpence." Poor Rosalie did not know how to reply. Her natural pride would not permit her to acknowledge her real poverty, so she went silently to work to try on the dress, which was a rich brocade, and cost alto- gether ninety dollars. She had penuriously insisted on Rosalie making it for four dollars, with as much and as neat work on it as Mrs. Jones would have charged ten for. It was a beautiful fit; several ladies were called in to comment upon it, and they all expressed their admiration. Mrs. Hyde asked Rosalie to remain, for the purpose of arranging the dress. The hair-dresser will be here in a few moments, and I will not keep you long after he comes," said Mrs. Hyde. "I would rather go now," answered Rosalie, "if you could get one of the servants to put on the dress. I left my baby-with my husbald, and he is very sick; besides, they have had no supper, and I fear the babe will cry. If I stay it will be near nine o'clock before I reach home." As she thus spoke, she thought, "I shall have money, and can ride. Perhaps she will not give me any more work, if I do not stay and assist her to dress-but poor George and baby l" While those thoughts were passing through Rosalie's mind,!Mrs. Hyde rang the bell, and ordered up her tea; after which she turned to Rosilie and said, "Will you stay?" ' Yes," she replied.  Well, then, take a seat; I have a little job I wish you would do. The laundress has broken the threads in this set of lloniton lace; just mend them for me, will you?" While Rosahe was busy mending the lace, and thinking of the suf- ferers at home, Mrs. Hyde had finished her tea, and the hair-dresser was announced. He entered, bowing as no one but a French hair- dresser or dancing-master can bow. "Well, madame, I have come to fix your hair; is the madame ready?"She answered in the affirmative. One hour was spent in arranging her hair; afterwards Rosalie arose to adjust the dress. It was half-past seven when Mr. Hyde came dashing up stairs. He thought (to use his own expression,) he never saw his wife look more beautiful. "Come, Marion," said he, "we shall be late; I was detained down town much longer than I wished-but now I am all ready, except my vest and gloves." "Call in the morning," said Mrs. Hyde to Rosalie, who was stand- ing near the door; "I have not time to attend to you now."  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7908-00000011"/> 20 \          ROSALIE IRVING. Poor Rosalie descended the stairs with a heavy heart; she could not leave the steps; she thought of the misery at home, and burst into tears. They were not such tears as weak-minded women shed at the loss of a bauble. No, they were wrung from a heart that had steeled itself against foolish weakness; they were tears of suffering and of want. She reeled back, and with a pencil that happened to be in her pocket, and on a piece of white paper lying at her feet, she wrote- "We are starvingl-for God's sake send me a shilling." To this she signed her name-Rosalie Irving. This was abrupt, but she could say no more on that small piece of paper. She returned to the door and rang the bell; a servant an- swered the summons. "Please hand this to Mrs. Hyde," said she, as she-passed the paper to the servant The servant misunderstood her, and handed it to his master, who thoughtlessly put it into his pocket, and handed his wife a bouquet, for which he had paid five dollars. They then glided down stairs full of mirth and joy,-and ere poor Rosahe had time to speak, were in their carriage and sweeping towards Broadway. Poor Rosaliel After walking nearly two miles, wretched and dis- appointed, what do you imagine was the desolation she was to witness at homel Though she had not tasted food,since partaking of a slight breakfast, and had worked unceasingly, and then walked a distance of four miles, still she thought not of herself. As she entered the dobr the cries of her dear babe caught her ear; she thought them more feeble than usual "Oh, dear wife, where have you been?" said her husband; " why did you stay so long? I have been almost wild about you." "Dear George, I came as soon as I could," she replied; in the meantime she had taken the baby and put it to her breast. Alas! the fountain of nature was dried. This was a new found sorrow, andone she had not thought of; want of food and an inward fever'had robbed her child of nature's nourishment. She had been happy in the thought that-"I at least can satisfy his hunger "-alluding to her babe-" and there is a crust left still that will do for George; and as for myself, I can wait until morning." But alas! she had not reckoned on the full *weight of misery that can fall upon poor human nature. There she sat in darkness, for she had neither oil nor candles It was nine o'clock. Could she go forth into the streets and ask for alms? Yes! and at the tlought she sprang up, folded her babe in her shawl, and said to her husband- - "George, I am going for a candle, and for fear that you might be annoyed by the cries of the baby, I will take him with me." As she said this, she darted into the street with rapidity, for fear' her husband might remonstrate. Her first thought was to go to some distant grocery store, for she had tried every one in her neighborhood, without effect. She wandered from store to store, the proprietors of each invariably refusing to trust her, telling her that if she would work she would do well enough. She offered the shawl that was round the child as a pledge; they in their hard-heartedness, only laughed at her.   ROSALIE IRVING.           21 Oh, God! is it possible," she cried, "that in this great city of wealth and luxury, we must starvel Yes, yesl it must be so!" In her haste she dropped her shawl, just as she was passing an en- gine-house. "Here, old woman, you have dropped your rag," said a rough voice. She turned, and as she looked into the face of the speaker, she thought she saw benevolence depicted there. He was a volunteer fire- man; his red-shirt told that fact. As the fireman handed the shawl to Rosalie, he caught a glimpse of her young and beautiful face. "Young, by the Lord Harryl" said he; "I wonder where she is running to, this time of night? 1'll just take a run after her." He stepped up, and addressing her, said-"Sis, I thought you were old, but I find you are young aud pretty; and say, sis,-can't you let a feller have a word with you?" She stopped suddenly, and turned her dark eyes full upon him; he, amazed, started back, and looked quietly upon her, at the same time asking her, in a rather gruff voice, if she was crazy. "' Oh, no!" she wildly exclaimed; " but starvingl-starving!" "Starvingl" responded he. "Well, Bill, you ain't got much mo- ney, and mother's rent must be paid to-morrow; but she, (Rosalie,) shan't starve. Here, take this-it's all I've got; but it will keep you from starving; (handing her a twenty-five cent piece,) take it, and if you ever feel like starving again, come round; Forty's fellows are al- ways good for a quarter." She seized it with an eagerness that could only be caused by her desperation. God will bless youl God will bless youl" said she, and hurrying into the nearest store, she purchased a candle, some bread, and some- thing for the babe. She then hastened home; a meal was soon pre- pared and dispatched, and in a little time they were all sleeping the sleep of honest poverty.  The reader has by this time began to wonder how it is that they are so poor. I will tell you, gentle reader-like thousands before them. Two years previous to the commencement of this narrative, George Irving led the lovely Rosalie Barker to the altar. She was an orphan, and had been educated by an aunt, in a little village in the State of New Jersey. After her school days had passed, it was thought advi- sable for Rosalie to learn a trade, as her aunt had nothing to leave her at her death. Accordingly, she was sent to the city of New York for the purpose of learning the art of dress-making. Young Irving often saw her pass his store, to and from her work. One day he saw a gentleman stop and speak to her, whom he recog- nized as an old acquaintance, who was boarding at the same house with Rosalie. He sought and gained an introduction to her through his friend, and soon an affection, deep and lasting, sprang up between them. In the course of a few months Rosahe was called to close the eyes c  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7908-00000012"/> J 22         ,  ROSALIE IRVING. of her aunt. This was indeed a deep sorrow; to be left alone in the world. After the solemnities were over, she returned to the city and commenced again her daily toil, which was wasting her health. George perceived this, and soon offered his hand and heart, which were accept- ed, and in a few months after, she was a happy bride. George was ten years her senior, and had seen enough of the deceit- fulness of the world to appreciate the virtues of Rosalie. He had been unfortunate in business about four years previous to his marriage; had failed, and it was with difficulty that he Had paid a per centage on his old debts, and established himself in business again; but at the time of his marriage he was thriving, and in a fair way to gain wealth. He was worth about twelve thousand dollars, and his business was good; but, alasl when was man ever content with doing welll A man of some business reputation offered to become his partner. George think- ing him honest, and wishing some relief from the cares of business, ac- cepted the offer, and in one year after the contract was signed between them, George Irving was a penniless man. It was a hard blow, but he felt it more for poor Rosalie's sake than his own. She was about to become a mother; what was to become of her? Everything must be sold; they must move to smaller apartments; and even then, how were they to live? George had been afflicted with rheumatism for several weeks; it was growing worse, and if he should be deprived of health, what would become of them? He broke the news to Rosalie, who bore it with becoming cheerfulness. "Dear George, I can work at dress-making," she said, "and you will soon be able to procure a situation, and I think we shall be just as happy as ever." She little knew what real poverty was in a city, even for those who are able and willing to work; it is almost impossible to obtain employ- ment. Everything was arranged, and an auction took place. All the valuable furniture was sold, and they settled in a small- back room on the third floor of a tenant house. To be sure, the number of families that were passing up and down, with their different dialects, surprised Rosalie a little, for her experience in New York had been among the genteel portion of the community. However, she felt happy in the society of George; They had a little money, and as it would be but a few weeks before Rosalie's confinement, they thought it best not to put out her sign of "DRESS MAKING" till she should have regained her health. George felt sure that he should obtain a situation, and then perhaps it would be unnecessary. He took the papers every morning, and answered every advertisement, but without effect. For weeks he met with no encouragement. Their little means were nearly gone, when one evening George read an advertisement and answered it. He re- ceived a favorable reply, and with a light heart he left the house to see the firm who offered him a situation. On his return he was attack- ed with a pain in his ancle; he found it impossible to walk; he hailed an omnibus that was passing, and rode home. It was with the utmost difficulty that he reached his room, from which he never moved for four months. Meanwhile, Rosahe had given birth to a son. She   ROSALIE IRVING.            23 lacked the kind attention all mothers require at such a time; however, she recovered, and as soon as she could leave the house she was obliged to visit the Pawn Broker's office. One thing after another went, till there was nothing left to pledge. The babe and har sck husband re- quired all her attention; she must make an extra exertion-she must seek for work and find time to do it. She succeeded in getting some shirts to make, but found it impossible to earn more than twenty-five cents per day, and that was mostly done by night. The rent came due -she could not pay it, and the landlord told her she must move; so she started out to seek other and cheaper apartments. She found a room-the same in which the reader first saw her. An old Irishman, who occupied the front and back, said she could have the room at fifty cents a week, as long as she paid for it. After they were settled, Ro- salie went to the- house of Mrs. Jones, the person with whom she had learned her trade, who did not feel very friendly towards her, on ac- count of her leaving her at a busy season to get married; bht Rosalie thought she might give her some employment. It was just about the great excitement of the first appearance of Rachel, when every dress- maker was overrun with work; consequently, Mrs. Jones overlooked the little ill-feeling, and sent Rosalie to Mrs. Hyde, and there we find her working on that proud woman's dress. We will leave the trio-the sick father, the weary mother and the innocent babe-and return to the aristocratic couple whom we left sweeping towards Broadway.  Crowds of carriages were gathered around that place of gayety and fashion-the Metropolitan Theater. Throngs of gay and thoughtless beings passed through the doors. There was a fortune in the ticket-box, paid for the mere pleasure of gazing at one of earth's beings. Mr. and Mrs. Hyde passed into a private box, which had been pro- cured for them. All was bustle and confusion. Soon a little bell was heard, and the band struck up a lively tune; another bell, and up goes the curtain, and the attention of all was absorbed- in witnessing a French comedy. The curtain fell. Mr. Hyde, who had just thought of the note handed him by the servant as he was leaving the house, drew it from his pocket, and, to his astonishment, read-"We are 'starving; for God's sake send me one shillingl" He turned to Marion, who was looking through an opera glass on some fashionables at the-other side of the theatre, and said-"Marion, what is the meaning of this?" She took the slip of paper, and, as she read, grew pale. She thought at first to deny all knowledge of it, but her look had betrayed her. "It is the woman who made this dress," said she, calling the atten- tion of her husband to the dress she had on. "Mrs. Jones did not tell me she was so poor, and she herself did not ask me for money." "That is no excuse," replied the husband; " you should always pay for your work when it is done. Do you know where she lives?" "I do not," answered Marion; "the only way to find her is to in- quire of Mrs. Jones." -Marion tried to forget about the matter during the play, but Mr. !   &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7908-00000013"/> 24            ROSALIE IRVING. Hyde took no interest in what was going on. He feared that the morning papers might announce the death of a fazlily by starvation. They returned home as soon as the performance was over. Mr. Hyde did not close his eyes that night;' but Marion, who had been all excite- ment during the day, fell into a slumber that was made up of troubled dreams., As soon as the sun arose, Mr. Hyde dispatched a servant to Mrs. Jones, to ascertain the abode of the Irvings. They were not long in finding them, and by the kind attention of Marion and her husband, George Irving was soon well enough to accept a situation in the count- ing-room of Hyde &amp; Co., with a salary sufficient to enable them to live in genteel style, without the exertion of Rosalie. This circumstance taught Marion Hyde a lesson she will never forget. MORAL. Dear reader, whenever you employ a seamstress or laun'ress, don't neglect to pay promptly, for their condition may perchance bear some resemblance to that of poor Rosalie Irving; and in your intercourse with the world, be sure and remember the words of Sir Walter Scott: Full many a shaft at random sent, Finds aim the archer never meant; And many a word at random spoken, May soothe, or wound a heart that's broken." THE RAG PARTY; OR, THE FIRST AND LAST LOVE OF AUNT DEBBIE. "I'll wear a smile when friends are nigh, And weep my tears alone.' "RAG PARTY!" some fashionable little Miss exclaims. "Why, Ma, what is a rag party?" Perhaps your mamma was not reared in the country, and may be just as ignorant upon the subject as yourself. Permit me, then, to give you the definition, or at least to tell you about our rag party. I was born in the country, brought up in an old farm house, consist- ing of a parlor, a sitting room, three sleeping rooms, a kitchen and gar- ret. Ohl that garret! how I should like to tell you about that dear old garret. Oh! happy happy I remembrance springs up all around me at the recollection of the hours spent in childish sport in that old garret. In or near the centre a rope is made fast to the rafters for a   THE RAG PARTY.           25 swing; I can even now imagine that I hear the rain as it came patter, patter, down upon the moss-covered shingles-then was the play-louse ornamented with rows of gaudy pieces of broken china; a little of ev- erything was to be found in that dear old never-to-be-forgotten rainy day play-house; the accumulation of years was stored away up there, and yet how clean everything looked. But I am wandering from my subject; I promised to tell you about the rag party, and I will do so as briefly as possible. It was in the fall of-, well, no matter for the date-the apples were all cut for drying, the quilts quilted for the winter, then came the time for over- hauling the carpets, the, rag. carpets. "' Mother had promised the girls- that was my sisters and myself, a party. One evening we were all seat- ed around the pleasant fire, mother looked up through her specks and said, "girls I guess you had better get up early to-morrow morning, and get the carpet rags down out of the garret and sort them over, and on Thursday you can invite the girls and have your party." An exclamation of joy burst from our lips, and pleasure danced in every eye. Oh, we should have such fun I happy, happy, days of child- hood, sweetly, swiftly have ye flownl Sister Charlotte drew forth a silver pencil which was attached to a small black cord about her neck, and began to write down the names of the girls which she intended to invite, (it was her privilege, as she was the oldest of the sisters). When she had finished, she looked up as if she wished to say something but did not like to. Brother Ned, who had been watching her from the corner of his roguish eye, while he pretended to- be reading a paper, said: "I know what Lotta wants, she'has put down all the girls names, and now she is thinking what boys she shall book for the occasion." Charlotte could not deny the truth of the assertion, and after a considerable of blushing, she confessed that was whshe he was thinking about. "Well," continued Ned, "put down Lewis Grimes for one." Lewis GrimesI oh how my little heart fluttered at the mention of that dear cherished names I would not for the world have had my brother know he had touched a tender cord. Charlotte's hand trembled a little as she wrote the name-none noticed it save myself. Jealousy has a quick eye. H re- mained thoughtful and silent, while the other names were called one after the other. That night the scalding tears chased each other down my cheek as I murmured my accustomed evening pirayer. I am get- ting serious-I did not intend to refer to my sorrows when I commenced this little story. Next morning all were up by times-the morning work was soon finished, and then away to the garret we all scampered, to gath- er up the cast-off clothing which was to be cut up into strips and put into a bag. Black Jenny, our hired girl, was summoned to assist in taking them into the kitchen, she obeyed, and a jolly good romp followed. Just as we were trying to put her into the rag-bag, we heard the sweet, gentle voice of mother Irom the foot of the stairs calling in a half-whisper, "Girlsl girlsl do make less noise. Mr. Smith, the minister, is coming up the road." Then we heard her step into the parlor, open the door, P,a  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7908-00000014"/> 26           THE RAG PARTY. and in another moment the voice of the good man greeted our ears. Charlotte and Lily hid their faces within the rag-bag to smother a laugh that threatened to burst forth in spite of their efforts to suppress it; Jenny had both her hands fixed over her thick lips, while I, who had more control over my risibilities was on tip-toe listening over the railing. At that moment mother stepped again to the foot of the stairs, and said "Girls, come down, Mr. Smith will make a prayer before he goes." The very solemn manner of mother, contrasted with the ridiculous attempt of my sisters and Jenny to suppress a laugh, robbed me of my hitherto self-control, and I rushed for the rag-bag. Mother finding all her efforts in vain, returned to the parlor, and excused us on the ground that we were still in our working dresses; in about fifteen minutes we had the satisfaction of hearing him say good day. We then descended into the kitchen with our rag-bag. The invitations were then duly sent out, and all preparation made for the entertainment of our invited guests. At last the long looked for Thursday came, and with it, ear- ly in the afternoon, the girls, and the rag sewing fairly commenced. As the old clock struck six, twenty balls of rags, weighing one pound each, were rolled into the bed room adjoining our parlor, much to the satisfaction of mother. Tea was soon over, and the young gentlemen '  began to make their appearance. I listened to the voice of each new arrival, but failed to catch the tone of one my heart told me I loved. I stood gazing from the window which looked out from the room in the direction from which he was k come. The shades of evening were gathering darkly over the earth, fit companions for my gloomy thoughts. The moments were passing like hours, still the loved one came not- Lewis Grimes came notl .Why should I look for him; he knew\not that I loved him, knew not that I even thought of, him; 'twas my own foolish heart that was at fault; tears, gentle dew-drops of the heart were gathering in my aching orbs, as if to cool the fevered heat that was burning upon my cheeks.  My brother Ned stepped up and said, "Why, sis, what on earth are you moping here alone for? Why don't you join, the company in the other room, I have heard several inquiries after you-come along," and the next moment I was dancing a country dance with my fun-loving brother. The dance was finished-Ned was leading me to aseat, when Lewis Grimes entered the room, he bowed politely as he passed me, and hurried to the side of my, sister Charlotte. My eyes followed him; I saw him smile upon her; she returned it with a sweet maidenly modesty-and indeed she looked angelic, for she was beautiful--I at this moment caught a glimpse of my own plain features in a looking- glass, I cast another glance at the happy pair-and for the first and only time in my life I hated my sister. Oh! how I have prayed to be forgiven, and I trust I have been. I feigned a head-ache, left the room, and flew to my own little apart- ment; oh, how I wept; this was the'first pang of real sorrow my then ,youthful heart had ever known. I loved-none knew it, not even the object of my affections, and now to school my heart to conceal forever the deep wound it had received, pride was my only safe-guard. She   THE RAG PARTY.           27 must be my constant companion for the future. My dear mother miss- ed me and came to seek me; I complained of a headache, and asked her to excuse me for a moment, she left, and at the expiration of an hour I was mingling with the gay and youthful throng. And so well I con- cealed my feelings that none guessed my secret. Oh could they have seen my poor heart'; could they have known the throbs of agony which moved its deep pulsations, they might have wondered at the calm expression of my face; I had a smile for all save Lewis Grimes, him I avoided. and I think he scarcely missed the atten- tions which I bestowed upon the other guests, for his very being seem- ed absorbed with the soul-enchanting smiles which my sister cast upon him. The evening moved on, the company departed, and .the old farm house was wrapt in silence; all within it were reposing in calm un- disturbed slumbers-my sister, my rival-how beautiful sle looked as she reclined her head upon the snowy pillow, the thick clusters of silken tresses hung gracefully over her white, well-rounded arm, upon which rested her rosy cheek, that cheek which a few hours since had received the warm caresses of Lewis Grimes. T could not sleep, I arose from my bed-gave one long lingering look to the sweet girl who was sleep- ing beside me. She, perhaps, was dreaming of him-a deep sigh esca- .... ped my parched lips as I passed out upon the old piazza, the moon was, lending her pale soft light as if to gladden the heart of the weary night watcher; for hours I paced that old piazza. 'Twas a bitter heart rend- ing struggle, and the contest seemed a lengthy one. Love and pride battling for the ascendency; pride conquering, love crushed retired to a secret corner of my heart, and pride held her queenlike sway. As the gray morn stole o'er the earth, I entered the little room-Charlotte was still sleeping; I imprinted a kiss upon her-innocent brow, and quietly laid myself beside her; I soon fell into a gentle doze. When I awoke I was a changed being, I had passed the ordeal of disappointed love- my young heart was blighted, seered-it once had loved; it never loved again. Three rnonths'passed, I stood at the altar-not as bride-but brides- maid, to await upon my sister Ch'arlotte. Gentle, reader, many years have passed; I am now an old maiden aunt. Little Lily and Cora Grimes thread my needles for me, and say, "Aunt why did'nt you get married as mother did?" "Go away, you little fairies," I exclaim, "don't you know little ladies should not be inquisitive?" but they lbok so sweet, that the next moment finds them fondly clasped to my heart, their sweet little lips pressed close to mine. Dear readers, I have traveled through many lands, mingled in many gay scenes of pleasure, listened to sweet strains of music, met many kind friends, and cherish many friendships. 'Still my heart and thoughts will wander back to the old Farm House, the old garret and the never- to be-forgotten rag-party.  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7908-00000015"/> "STENING FOR FOOTSTEPS. DEAR reader did you ever listen for footsteps? (of course I mean lady readers, for this is a sort of painful pleasure peculiarly affecting the ner- vous systems of the gentler sex.) To be sure you have. No woman ever arrived at the age of twenty, but who has at some time listened for footsteps. Even the Miss in her teens, as she drops the last coquet- tish curl upon her snowy neck, turns from her mirror with a sigh-listens for footsteps and inwardly murmurs-why don't he come? The wife listens for the footsteps of her truant husband, who left the house soon after tea. The first three hours pass pleasantly enough, for she is accustomed to being alone during the early part of the evening, and, perchance she is trying to finish an article before his return, and thereby give him a little surprise. As she industriously plies her needle, she thinks over the happy days of girlhood; her mind reverts to many little courtship scenes. A smile steals over her countenance at the rec- ollection of a lover's quarrel, and the delightful pleasure of making up. With these pleasant memories for companions, the evening passes. Casting her eye occasionally towards the clock upon the mantlepiece, she thinks the hours are moving a trifle too fast for her fingers-a race commences-tick, tick, goes the clock-stitch, stitch, go her fingers- hands of clock ahead-now fingers come up-now they are about even -fingers pick up at the home stretch-they cross the score-clock is beaten, the article is finished five minutes befpre ten, the usual hour for her husband's return. The above mentioned article is a fine linen shirt, the first she has ever attempted to make; she has kept the matter a profound secret, thinking the surprise would be the more pleasant. After folding the shirt, she picks up all the little threads, then gath- ers the sewing utensils, puts them in her work basket, after which she 'takes a peep into the looking-glass to see that her hair is smooth, turns away satisfied that it will do; then advances towards the stove and gives the fire a poke, and commences to hum a tune; gives the fire another poke, looks up at the clock and exclaims, half-past ten why how strange Harry don't comel Then follows the listening for footsteps. There are many of them upon the street, but she is sure she would know his above them all. An hour is spent in listening. The footsteps grow less in number-the fire has gone out-the lamp burns dimly-the sit- ting room is cold and cheerless; she determines to go to her chamber, the sound of a footstep falls upon her ear. 'Tis his, she joyfully ex- claims, and pauses in almost breathless anxiety for a moment, the pe- destrian passes down the street-'tis not her husband. This disappoint- ment completely unnerves her, a feeling of bitterness arises within her   "STENING FOR FOOTSTEPS.        29  bosom, and she gives vent to her pent up suffering something after .the following style: What a silly fool 1 am to fret about him; he is no doubt enjoying himself, perhaps at a game of "rondo," as he calls it, or perhapsl oh! if I thought that! but no, 1 won't be so mean as to be jealous of him; I'll have more pride, and entertain a higher opinion of myself. Still men have strange fancies sometimes; and in spite of her lofty opinion of herself, the green eyed monster is forcing himself into her good graces, when, histl-a footstep in the distance; how its sound echoes upon the stillness of the night-how her heart beats-thump, thump, goes the little flutterer-step, step, approaches the heavy steps; she gets into bed, smooths the front of her hair, adjusts her cap-string, pulls the frills of her night-gown sleeves over her hand to make it ap- pear small, throws one arm gracefully over the white spread, evidently desiring too look very interesting when he comes in. Hark! alas, she is doomed to another disappointment; the footsteps pass rapidly down the street. This is too much for one woman to bear, she raises herself in the bed, and almost choking with anger, says: oh, I wish it was mor- ning, would'nt I walk out of this house; I'll give him a lecture when he comes home that he won't soon forget. Yes, yes, I'll give him to under- stand that I am not to be trifled with. Its too b-a-d I d-e-c-l-a-r-e, and she burst into a flood of tears. After sobbing a few moments, pride tri- umphs over her weakness; she reclines upon her pillowaud commences to manufacture a severe lecture. Hum--I suppose he thinks I'll be pleasant in the morning, forgive him and as usual prepare his breakfast for him and after a while, like a good, kind, obedient wife, I'll get used to his staying out; but he'll find himself mistaken; if he comes home after midnight hefll find an empty bed. As she utters this last sentence, she sinks quietly into the arms of Morpheus, who is about to bear her to the "land of dreams,"- when she is suddenly aroused by the clock, bwhich peals forth the hour of one. One o'clockl she shrieks; -good heavenl where can he stay so late? At the same moment she springs from the bed-approaches the window-throws open the sash, and peers forth into the darkness. Now all her anger changes into fear for his safety. Oh where can he stay, she again repeats; surely something must have happened, he may have fallen by the hand of the midnighi assassin, or taken ill in the street, and as these horrible fancies intrude themselves upon her heated imagi- nation, she wipes the largs drops of perspiration from her brow. Throw- ing herself into a chair, cries out in an agony of grief, will the day never dawn? Just as she is about to break forth into another fit of raving, she hears footsteps; she listens! nearer, nearer-it turns up the street -opens the street door, trips up the stairs-'tis Harry. An hour later, all is forgotten, all is forgiven, they sleep soundly, sweetly. The man who stays out late, has wit enough to frame an ex- cuse; that will satisfy a true, loving, confiding wife. Ohl manl maul did you know how many hours of care, anxiety, and weary midnight watching you have cost us poor women, you would have more charity for our peevishness and complaining, and repay us with a greater amount of love and devotion. Remember you who stay out late at night, there are eager ears listening for your footsteps. D  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7908-00000016"/> BLANCHE BLAKELTY; OR, THE CURSE OF BEAUTY.  NEW YORK! busy, bustling New York! What a variety is found within thy limits. The emporium of fashion, amusement, beauty and gaiety-of want, beggary and miseryl The dashing belle and the squalid mendicant walk side by side; the millionaire and rag-picker ride in the same 'buss, and pull the same string to stop the vehicle; the one to enter his luxurious mansion on Fifth Avenue, the other his garret or -cellar on one of the by-streets, where dwell the poor of all nations. Such is life in New York I It was a close, sultry afternoon in the month of June. Overcome by the heat of the day, I cast aside my needle-work, threw myself upon the sofa in front of the parlor windows, which were shaded by the spreading branches of a button-ball tree, and was just falling into one of those sweet little dozes which sometimes steal over the human frame, when all the world seems shut out, when my nerves were suddenly startled by the ringing of the street door bell. "Dear me," I mur- mured to myself, "I hope I am not to have company;" and then I heard Bridget, (our girl of all work,) answer the summons, and come tripping up stairs, and as she entered the door said-"Please, Miss Mille, Mrs. Stiles, the wash-woman, is down stairs. Shall I ask her up, or will you go down stairs?" "Ohl ask her up, by all means;" and in another moment our good- natured washerwoman stood before me, with arms akimbo. "I am very sorry for disturbing you, Miss; were you asleep?" "Nearly so," I replied; "all our family have gone to Hoboken on an afternoon's pleasure trip; I was left at home to keep house, and feeling a little lonely, I thought I would take a nap. Did you wish to see mother?" "No, Miss Mille, I came on purpose to see you." "Well, take the rocking-chair, Mrs. Stiles," I replied, "and let us proceed to business." After being seated, she continued: "There is a very poor family liv- ing in the house with me. They have a daughter lying sick, and they are suffering for the necessaries of life; I thought as you were acquaint- ed with so many people, you might be able to direct me to some benev- olent society for the relief of the poor." "I have very little confidence in the so-called benevolent societies," I replied, "for I have frequently applied to them in behalf of the poor   BLANCHE BLAKELY.           31 for assistance, and have found them prepared with the same stereotyped answer: 'We should be most h&amp;pypto do something for you, but really, the case does not come within the by-laws of our institution.' But what is the matter with the young woman? How long has she  been sick?" She has a babe, about six weeks old, and has never been able to sit up a moment since its birth. I suppose her continued sickness pro- ceeds from the want of proper care, and the attentions of a good phy- sician." "Where is the husband of the young woman?" "I do not know," replied Mrs. Styles, " a manj visited her during the first week of her sickness, whom she called her husband, but since that time he has never called upon her. I have asked the sick woman no questions about him; I hardly think he was her husband; but you know, Miss," she added, " let her be what she may, she should not suffer for the necessaries of life." "Certainly not," I replied, " and I will do all I can for her. You are aware that our means are limited; but what I can do, I will most cheerfully. You know," I continued, " that I am very good at beg- ging for others, and I will use my utmost endeavors in this case." i' You are a good girl, Mille," said Mrs. Stiles, as she wiped the tears from her eyes, and God will bless you, depend upon it, He will." "Oh, no, I am not a good girl; at least, mother says I am very naughty sometimes. Let me'see; you live in King street, I believe?" "Yes, Miss, near Varick; you can't miss the place. There are four houses all alike. The numbers don't run very straight; the next one to the corner; it is just over the porter-house, with red curtains up at the windows. Inquire for Mrs. Blakely." "Very well," I replied, " since you have been so explicit in giving the direction, I don't think I can miss the place. I will get there al- most as soon as yourself, if you do not hurry too fast." Somehow I had'forgotten that I was sleepy, and set about preparing for the visit. I have never been able to say whether my anxiety to reach the abode of misery, arose from natural kindness of heart, or from love of romance in real life. My little sister, Fanny, used to say, ".The reason Mille goees about with tracts is because she loves to see sights!"But be that as it may, I was soon on my way from a snug little parlor in Commerce street in search of a home of wretchedness and sorrow. I was not long in find- ing the place so definitely described by Mrs; Stiles. I entered the front door, ascended the filthy staircase and stood upon the landing which led into the apartment occupied by the Blakelys. I was about to enter, when I started back almost horrified at the apparent misery which I beheld. Heaven forbid that I should ever again witness such a scene. It beggared all description. "Were my pen a painter's brush, Had I a painter's skill," I might portray it upon canvas, but my powers as a writer are inade-  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7908-00000017"/> 32           BLANCHE BLAKELY. quate to the task. The rays of the burning sun were pouring in through the curtainless windows, and there, upon the floor, on a miserable bed composed of pine shavings, lay a beautiful girl. She must have been beautiful, indeed, when the roses of health bloomed upon her cheeks, for even in her emaciated state she looked lovely. She was apparently about twenty years of age. By her side nestled a little babe; it was almost as naked as when it came into the world. When I reached the bed, Mrs. Stiles introduced me as the daughter of a lady for whom she did washing. It was with difficulty that the poor sufferer parted her parched lips to say, "How kindl"I asked her if she would like some water-she nodded assent. Mrs. Stiles soon procured a glass of the cool beverage. After drinking, she thanked us, saying, "I have long wished for a drink, but mother is trying to finish ironing some clothes to take home; I did not like to call her from her work; she has great need of the money, poor womanl-my poor, poor mother!" she said, and burst into tears. I tried to cheer her up, telling her that they should no longer lack the comforts for which they were then suffer- ing. The mother was ironing at a table in a small bed-room adjoining, and had hot noticed our presence until she came out to exchange her iron. "Good afternoon, Miss," she said, smiling. "You will p!ease excuse me; these clothes must be done in half an hour. A gentleman leaves this city for Albany at five o'clock." , Having said this, she re- sumed-her work. The ironing was finished, and a boy called for the clothes. "How much are they, ma'am?" inquired the boy. "Six shillings a dozen," replied Mrs. Blakely. "Six shillingsl" exclaimed the boy, " why, he can get them done as good for four. That's all he gave me, so you'll have to take it or go without."' "Very well; if that is all he sent, I suppose I must take it." Then folding them in a neat, white cloth, she handed them to the boy, who immediately left, no doubt priding himself on cheating the poor woman out of two shillings. At that moment the babe awoke. "Poor little thing!"I exclaimed, as the grandmother lifted it from the bed--"Have you no clothing for it, madam?"I asked. 1 No," she replied; "Blanche had nice little things for it, when it was born, but we got out of money and were obliged to take them to the pawnbrokers. It takes what little I can earn to pay the demands of the landlord. He has threatened to turn us out if we do not pay up every week. 1 don't know what we should have done if it had not been for the kindness of Mrs. Stiles. She went for a doctor this morn- ing. and we expect him here every moment." She had hardly finished the sentence when the doctor made his ap- pearance. He looked at the sufferer for a moment, then said--Ma- dam, your daughter is very sick, and should have had medical aid long before this." After a few moments' consideration he wrote a prescrip- tion, and leaving orders how it should be taken, left the room. I fol- lowed him out, and asked what he thought of her case. "A very doubtful one," he replied; "I do not think she can live." He then   BLANCHE BLAKELY.           33 bade me good afternoon, and I returned to the bedside of the sick girl. I gave Mrs. Blakely all the change I had with me; then wishing them good day, I promised to call again in the morning. When I reached home, my mother and sister had returned, and Fan- ny exclaimed: "You're a nice one to be left to keep house. We thought you would have had a nice supper ready for us." True, I had forgotten to leave orders with Bridget concerning sup-- per. However, she had prepared a good, plain meal. As soon as we. were seated around the table, Fanny began to tell of the fun she had during her trip; said she "wished that mother was rich, so that we could live at Hoboken during all "the pleasant season." My more de- mure sister, Olive, remarked that she thought it "the most pleasant place on earth to visit," but did not think she would like to live there. My dear mother looked all her happiness; her cheeks were really blooming as she smilingly said: "Come, Mille, you have not told us, where you have been roaming this afternoon.' "Ohl" interrupted Fanny, "she has been out -distributing tracts. Don't you see how solemncholly she looks? Dear me!" she continued, I shall be so glad when Mille gets married to that young chap from White Plains." 'Hush, Fanny," said mother; "you talk too fast. Little girls should be seen and not heard." "Little girl, indeed! I am fifteen years old. Am I always to be called little, because I am the youngest? I guess," continued Fanny, "I will join Mille in her tract distributing, and then, perchance, I may be considered of some consequence. When shall I commence, Mille?" she said laughing. 1"To-morrow, if you like. I want you to go with me to visit a sick family." I then related my adventures of the afternoon, after which it was agreed that we should all go down in the morning, and see what could be done. i will not tire your patience, gentle reader, by following the popr girl through the many weeks of sickness and severe suffering. Suffice it, that in a few days after my first visit, the little babe closed its eyes in death; and the miserable mother lingered on for many weary days and nights, and at last she, too, sank beneath the withering hand of death. They were laid side by side in a vault of one of the up town churches. When the funeral rites were performed, I returned with the sorrow- ing Mrs. Blakely to her now lonely and desolate home. After admin- istering the consolation which kind and affectionate words could im- part, I turned to take my leave, when she said-"Miss Mille, you have been very kind to us, and the only return I can make is to thank you from the fullness of my heart, and reveal to you the events of my past history, and also the history of my poor unfortunate girl. If you have time, remain, and I will be brief. I feel it a duty to tell," she con- tinued, " the history of that poor dead girl, that it may be a warning to you." I freely consented to remain and listen to what she should reveal.  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7908-00000018"/> 84           BLANCHE BLAKELY. "Poor Blanche," she said. ' was not always as you found her. Her father died when she was a mere child, leaving me a small income, not sufficient to support us without some extra exertion on my part. She was my only child, and I set my heart upon making her a lady; that is,  if education and accomplishments would do it. As she grew up, I kept  her at the best boarding-school in the country, depriving myself of even the necessaries of life to gratify her every wish. At the age of sixteen, I had the gratifying pleasure of hearing that she was considered one of the most accomplished young ladies that ever left the far-famed school  of Mrs. W-  . Her exceeding beauty drew crowds of admirers around her. i As I found it would be impossible that my limited means would be sufficient to satisfy her ardent love for finery, I determined to  strive to marry her to some man of wealth; for I found, too late, like  many fond and foolish mothers, that I had taken the wrong course. I had encouraged her extravagance until her desire knew no bounds.  Accordingly, I made preparation on the following summer, after she left school, to visit a fashionable watering place, hoping that she might there meet and be successful in winning the affections of one worthy of her beauty and attainments. "It was not long ere my brightest wishes were gratified; for in a few days after our arrival Blanche was introduced to a young gentle- man by the name of Ewing, who was visiting the springs with a weal- thy uncle whose health was very delicate. An affection seemed to grow upon first sight, and in one week after the introduction Blanche. was the, affianced bride of Dudly Ewing. "I told him our circumstances; stated that the only fortune that Blanche could bring hipi was a pure, unsullied heart. 'Tis all I ask of her,' he said. The day was set, and, ere two months had passed, she was the happy bride of her first love. "We continued to travel, hoping the health of his uncle might be improved; but all hope proved vain; he died in a few weeks after the marriage, leaving Dudly sole heir to his immense estates. "'Come, darling,' he said one day to Blanche, ' where shall we set- tle? What say you to a neat, quiet residence on the banks of the Hudson?' "'Oh, I should like it above all things,' she replied; 'for many of my schoolmates live there.' "' Well,' said Dudly, 'I will leave you and mother here, at the ho-  tel, and I will go down and see if I can find a place to suit you.' "We were stopping at one of the fashionable hotels in Albany at that time, and it was decided that we should remain there until his re- turn. Blanche felt lonely after his departure, and moped around the rooms for several days; but being naturally fond of society, she could not long refuse the many invitations to join the company. I observed  her on several occasions in close conversation with a gentleman, and I thought it my duty to warn her. 'Oh, mother,' she said, 'he is the most delightful fellow you ever saw; he was a schoolmate with Dudly, and he says Dudly took his sweetheart from him, but that he bears him no ill-will for it- now. ;I want to introduce you mother,' she con-   BLANCHE BLAKELY.    '       35 tinned. 'Very well,' said I; ' this evening I will join you in the par- lor.' When evening came, I felt quite indisposed, and declined going into the parlor, and retired early. I did not awake until next morn- /, ing. I called to Blanche, who slept in the next room, but received no answer; so I stepped to the door, and to my horror and surprise found that she had not occupied the room that night; and as I was about to ring the bell to make some inquiry, a note lying upon the table at- tracted my attention. I took it up, and read the following: ," ' Dear Mother :-Do not seek me. I leave in company with Mr. Willis, the old schoolmate of my husband. I thought I loved Dudly, but I never knew what it was to love until I met Mr. W. When I get settled in London, for which place we start by the next steamer, I will send for you. Until then, adieu. I remain your dear, though erring child,   BLANCHE.' "'Great Heavenl' I exclaimed, and the note fell from my hands. It was some moments ere I recovered sufficient strength to arrange my toilet. What should I do? The matter could not be made public. I knew not where to telegraph to Dudly. At length I concluded to take the nine o'clock train to the city of New York. Perhaps I might find my child there, as she would be obliged to stop in that city until the sailing of the steamer. So, packing up all our own things, and making some slight excuse to the clerk of the hotel, I started on my journey. I knew that Dudly always stopped at the Astor House, so I determined to take lodgings there, in hope of meeting him, or, at least, of hearing where I might be able to find him. I arrived in New York, and directed the coachman to drive me to that house. I soon ascertained that my son-in-law was at Poughkeepsie, and telegraphed for his immediate return to New York. le answered the summons, and, in three days from the time I arrived, I had the satisfaction of seeing him. When I had relate4 to him the circum- stances of the elopement, his whole nature seemed changed. He swore vengeance upon the foul fiend who had wronged him. He told me that Willis had been his classmate; that he had been successful in winning the affection and favor of a young girl whose love Willis had tried to secure; that Willis had accused him of foul play, and swore to be r(- venged, and that it was not for love of Blanche that he had seduced her from him, but to fulfill his vow. After relating the above to me, he started in search of Willis, and found him at one of the fashionable hotels. He was informed, upon in- quiry, that he had only taken lodgings for himself, and was at that time in his room. 'Very well,' Dudly replied, 'I have not time to see him now, but will call again.' He then returned to the Astor House, disguised himself, and started, determined to watch the movements 6f Willis, and, if possible, to ascertain the whereabouts of Blanche. He was not long kept in suspense, for, about dark, the figure of Willis de- scended the steps of the hotel; and turned down Leonard street. Dudly followed until he saw him enter one of those fashionable dens, which infest all the large cities of the East. In another moment the wrong- doer and the wronged stood face to face. A challenge followed, a duel took place, and Dudly fell. Willis fled the country, and my poor child was left an inmate of that den. The morning papers announced the  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7908-00000019"/> 36           BLANCHE BLAKELY. facts of these lamentable occurrences. I sought and found my child- my only child, for whom I had made so many sacrifices, the idol of my soul-the once joy of my lone, desolate and widowed heart. I took her to my boson' for she was still dear to me. ' Come,' I said, 'my child, tloughall othe rld forsake thee, thy mother-thy heart-broken mother, will cling to the- Come, my child, leave these scenes of de- bauchery and dissipation, 'nd seek shelter- with thy mother. But she refused all my earnest solicitations, saying, 'I can never again mingle with the daughters of chastity; they willspurn me-shun me. I have brought upon myself this misery. Leaveme, my mother-leave me. Again I clasped her to my bosom, and again I entreated her to come with me; but I found all entreaties were in vain. So I left her to her fate, and, as I left her, I exclaimed, "Oh, Father of Mercyl take me from this- world Take me from this living sorrow.'" The poor woman seemed unable to proceed with her story. The tears were streaming from her eyes, and coursing each other down her care-worn cheeks. At length' she recovered her feelings, and thus re- sumed her narrative: "I returned to the hotel, settled my bill, and found, when that was done, that I had but little left. I sought for cheap apartments, and found these. I determined," "she continued, " to stop here, and gain my livelihood by hard work, and keep a watchful eye upon my dear, though disobedient daughter. I found it impossible to get sufficient sewing to support me, so I put out a sigu of washing and ironing. "After I was settled I again sought my child; but, alasl I found her not. The person keeping the house in which I had left her but a few days before, could give me no definite information respecting her. She said she left with a gentleman the evening previous, intending, she believed, to keep house; but where, she could not tell. Almost frantic with grief, I returned to my desolate home, to bear that sorrow which fate had ordained for me. "Months passed-still no tidings of my child, until one evening, about four weeks before you first came to see her, I was just coming into the street door, when a carriage drove up, and I heard a voice from within say: 'Mrs. Blakely.' In another m'oment I held my erring child to my heart. Oh, what joy! My dear, dear Blanche had re- pented and sought her mother-had come to share my poverty and de- serve my love-my deep, undying love. But what were my feelings when she informed me she was about to become a motherl I will not at- tempt to describe them. But let them be what they might, I was happy. " You know the rest of her painful history. Poor girl Poor Blanche! I hope she is now in Heaven, for," she added, "I believe her sufferings and her penitence were sufficient atonement for, all her faults. But, oh, Miss Mille," she continued, "do take warning, and tell the story of poor Blanche to all your young acquaintances, that they, too, may be warned to shun the precipice down which my dear child fell, and lost her fair fame." The old lady's story had affected me to tears. I wept with her; and, bidding her good afternoon, and promising to see her frequently, I pro-   BLANCHE BLAKELY.           37 ceeded to my quiet little comfortable home, to join my dear mother and happy sisters. Dear reader, many years have passed since the occurrences recited in the above story. My dear mother " s!eeps the sleep that knows no waking." My little sister, Fannie, has become a sober dame and the mother of three blooming boys. My more sedate sister; Olive, is the happy wife of an intelligent farmer; and. for myself-what shall I say of my checkered life? aught, but that I did not marry the chap (as Fannie was pleased to caal him,) from White Plains; but I have always looked with charity upon the unfortunate, and adopted the beautiful lines of the poet for my guide: "Judge not too harsh the human heart- Its strange mysterious depths explore; What tongue can tell-what pen impart The treasures of its hidden lore. - The bird, with bruised and broken wing. Oft tries to mount the air again, And with its mates to gladly sing Its last melodious dying strain." e  A CHAPTER ON ACTRESSES. OCCASIONALLY an article appears in some of our papers, lauding the private virtues of this and that actress, but more frequently, I am sorry to say, the reputations of others fare blackened, and I may add, totally Adamned. - My object in writing this article is to draw a parallel between the circumstances of the 'one held forth as a pattern of virtue and the poor victim of slander. ,Your virtuous woman may have had the protection and constant care of a kind mother to guide aright her footsteps and to guard her from the snares everywhere spread to entrap the young, beautiful and gifted, and she may have passed from the hands of that mother to the arms of a husband, whose devoted love and tenderness serve as a wall, behind which temptation even cannot enter. Such an one should make no boast of her virtue: it has ever been tested. As the stained web that whitens in the sun. Grows pure by being purely shone upon." F Permit me to draw your attention to the other picture. See to all outward appearances, she is happy and joyous; but alasl there is a canker gnawing at her heart: the world looks upon her with scorn and contempt. She, perhaps, at an early age was left a frieudless, penniless orphan, dependent upon the charity of a cold and friendless world. She arrives at the age of girlhood, and looks forth for a change; her soul sickens at the thought of bearing forever the poverty and privation of the past. She peers into the dim future, and sees two paths marked E             -*"4  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7908-00000020"/> 38         A CHAPTER ON ACTRESSES. out; one to marry the first man that offers, and secure a protector and a home-the other is more dazzling; around its portals are strewn wealth, luxury, and ease; but far down the path she detects disappoint- ed hopes and an outcast's grave; and as she gazes she remembers the prayer her gentle mother taught her infant lips to utter, as she knelt in the early twilight and lifted her tiny hands to "Our Father who art in Heaven." The silver-toned voice of that mother seems floating upon the air with timely warning. She obeys the whispering of the spirit, and shuns the temptations the evil one has plotted for her downfall. She becomes a wife. Poverty has no choice. The husband proves unwor-  thy the charge entrusted to his care, and she is again cast upon the world. She must seek the means of livelihood, The theatrical pro- fession appears the most lucrative. Application is made, and her wishes are crowned with success. She perchance possesses talent of a higher order, or a more charming personal appearance than some of the older members of the profession she has chosen, and becomes an object of en- vy. Then commences the game to crush her. She is too pretty, or too talented, says ohe, who has had the misfortune to arrive at the shady side of forty; "she will ruin my prospects, and in justice to myself I must put her down and keep her there. Eureka!" she exclaims; "I will circulate reports derogatory to her private character, and to make my work more sure, I will smile upon her and rail against those to whom I myself have given the cue." ," The ignoble mind Loves ever to assail with secret blow The loftiest, purest beings of their kind." The work of destruction begins. She feels its influence, and seeks in vain to learn the source whence it originated. Still the putrid stream flows on, for the smooth words and fiendish smile of the destroyer have foiled-the efforts of her victim; and even had she succeeded in discover- ing the enemy of her peace, what could she do?-to whom look for re- dress? She has no parent to- protect, no husband to defend her. She must bear with meekness the stigma; and in the bitterness of heart she exclaims; "* The hopes my soul have cherished Have wither'd one by one- And though life's flowers have perished, I'm left to linger on." A word to the panegyrists, and I have done. In writing the praises of the fortunate and happy actress, do not quite forget my second pic- ture. Remember, a kind word from your pen may cheer her drooping spirits, awaken within her soul a new ambition, enable her to cast off the fetters that have so long bound her heart to sorrow and reduced her al- most to the verge of despair; it may redeem her from the temptation into which the tainting breath of slander has so ruthlessly plunged her. Do not leave her without one effort to save. Could you but see her heart, witness the scalding tears shed in secret, know how her spirit yearns for the companionship of the good and respected, and how, one by one, the ties that bound her to that class have been snapped asunder, you would   A CHAPTER ON ACTRESSES.        . 39 assist her by your influence to regain that position to which her merits entitle her. I do not speak of the fallen wanton, but of the crushed, noble-heart- ed, virtuous woman. Numbers of them are to he found even in our midst. Two cases I will mention. One of them, who a few years since landed upon our shores a brilliant and talented lady and actress, is now following the vocation of wash-woman in one of the mining towns, and the other is serving in the pacity of chamber-maid. Both of these parties are good English and rench scholars. There are others I could mention, but I have already ktended this article beyond its intended limits. I only cite these amples to show that, although they have been driven from their pro ssion, they still earn their bread by honest labor.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7908-00000021"/> 40           MY CHLDHOOD'S HOME.  MY CHLDHOOD'S HOME. I oft in fancy seem to roam Back to my old brown cottage home, I often wish, though wish in vain, That I could be a child again. While yet the dew was sparkling bright, I tript along with heart so light,            ; To the old school-house-down the lane-, I wish I were a child again. My teachers' smile would meet me there,  And she'd offer up a prayer, That God would o'er the children reign-- I wish I were a child again. At noon, with faces beaming bright, Each one with eager appetite, Devoured what basket did contain-  I wish I were a child-again.  And when the school was out at night, I hastened home with footsteps light,         ' A supper waited neat and plain-           / I wish I were a child again. My mother dear, affectionately With smiles would place me on her knee; She'd sooth and hush each fancied pain-  I wish I were a child again. Brothers and sisters-where are they! Who joined me in my childish play; Oh ' with that thought is mingled pain- I wish I were a child again. Mid dazzling scenes have they forgot, Our childhood's home-that old brown cot; While I'm wishing, though in vain,  To live my childhood o'er again! I.   &#xD;</p>
