                  <p>THE white garb of winter lay upon the earth, and the chill blast howled mournfully over the bleak hills, and through the drear vales. Deep and drifting lay the snow, and travellers found no comfort now upon the road. Blessed were those who owned comfortable houses, or had kind and able friends, for many a weary son and daughter of earth found only suffering through the long dread winter. Some, perchance, found joy in faith; some lived in hope, while others were blessed in charity. Did not God mean that one of winter's uses should be to try these three elements of Christianity? Who so miserable that he may not find hope in his Son? But, above all-who so abject in self that be will not give from out of his abundance in charity?</p> 
                  <p>But few of the fortunate ones were willing to search after poverty for its relief during such a winter, and those who could not go forth to beg, too often suffered while there was plenty all about them.</p> 
                  <p>Upon the edge of a small village not far from the great city stood a low, dilapidated cottage. Its very outward appearance bespoke poverty and neglect, and yet everything was clean and neat where the simple care of weak hands could make it so. In the front room of the lower part was collected all the furniture of the house. There was a cot-bed and a small trundle-bed, a pine table, four well-worn chairs, and a few other simple articles. An old box-stove stood upon the hearth, from which ran a short piece of funnel directly through the fireboard.</p> 
                  <p>Upon the cot-bed lay a woman somewhere in the middle walks of life. She slept now, but her breathing was quick and heavy, and at times she would start as though her breath had failed her. Her pale, thin face, with its hectic flush and marble look, told plainly that consumption was upon her with its destroying power; and that fatal touch must have been laid upon her a long while since, for now there is but little flesh to cumber her soul, and but little life to bind it to earth.</p> 
                  <p>Upon the trundle-bed lay a child-a girl-not more than four years old. She slept sweetly, and yet the tone of her countenance was sad. But she was a lovely-looking being-a sweet, gentle creature-and as she now lay, with her small hands clasped upon her bosom, and her sunny curls floating over her neck and shoulders, she seemed almost an angel-spirit sent to guide the soul that was so soon to depart.</p> 
                  <p>Upon a low stool at the head of the trundle-bed, and also near the head of the cot, sat a boy who might have seen six summers. In feature he resembled the girl who slept near him; but his face seemed more thoughtful, and his brow wore more of sorrow. As he now sat, his head was resting on the edge of the table, and his lids were closed. He slept, but not soundly, for at the least noise he would start quickly up, gaze anxiously upon the face of her who rested on the cot, and then close his eyes again. His hands were clasped upon his knees, and as the beams of the small lamp fell upon his face, they were reflected back from two big teardrops which stood upon his cheeks.</p> 
                  <p>It was very near morning, for already there were gray streaks in the cast, and the stars began to grow pale. Suddenly the boy started up and gazed about him for a moment, and then he went to the window and looked out. A cold shudder crept through his frame as he felt the frosty air that made its way through imperceptible crevices, and with a low moan he turned away and glided noiselessly to the bed. But the woman slept, and be next moved toward the stove. The fire had burned very low, and instinctively he reached over into an old box which stood close at hand, but he found nothing there Another moan broke from his lips, and another tear started down his pale cheek. A moment he stood thus, and then he clasped his hands, and raised his eyes towards heaven. No audible<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6097-00000003"/> sound escaped his lips, but his speaking features told plainly that there was a prayer in his soul. Alter this he glided to the side of the trundle-bed and kneeled down.</p> 
                  <p>"Clara," he whispered, at the same time touching the little sleeper upon the shoulder, "come, you must wake up for a little while."</p> 
                  <p>The girl opened her eyes with a sudden start.</p> 
                  <p>"-sh!" the boy whispered. "I must go and find some wood, so do you watch mother while I'm gone. You wont fall asleep, will you?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, I wont, certainly."</p> 
                  <p>After this the boy put on his cap and went out. He was gone some ten or fifteen minutes, and when he returned he bore in his arms a bundle of sticks, chips and pieces of bark. With some of this he set the fire burning once more, and then he called for the little girl to come and sit down by the stove. The boy went again to look upon the sleeper, and then came and sat down by his sister's side.</p> 
                  <p>"Henry," spoke the girl, in a low, prattling whisper, "can mamma ever be well again?"</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know, Clara; I hope she can."</p> 
                  <p>"So do I," resumed the girl, with a sad look; "for what shall you and I do when she is gone away from us?"</p> 
                  <p>For some moments the boy was silent. A painful expression rested upon his features, and his lips trembled.</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps," he at length said, but with a doubting tone, "we may find friends. You know they have helped mother. Some good folks have sent the doctor here, and have sent us things to eat, too; and why shouldn't they be good to us if we should be left alone?"</p> 
                  <p>"They ought to, hadn't they?" the girl replied, earnestly and confidently. "Why," she added, with increased confidence, "of course they will help us, and protect us."</p> 
                  <p>"But why of course?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why, because there are so many folks who go to meeting, and belong to the church. You know what mamma has told us made a Christian, and surely these folks who live here are Christians; and so they must help us. All of them have Bibles, and you know what the Bible says about such things?"</p> 
                  <p>The boy made no answer, for he had not all his sister's simple confidence. She had not been out into the little world about them, and he had. She had not seen anything of the selfish indifference of men, and he had. She had never asked charity of a professing Christian, but the boy had. He had seen and heard enough to know that all was not Christianity which was called so, and that all were not Christians who would be known as such.</p> 
                  <p>But before anything more was said there was a movement upon the bed, and the boy hastened to its side. The sleeper had awakened, and it was some time before she seemed to realize that the boy was near her.</p> 
                  <p>"Dear mother, do you feel much pain now?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, Henry, none at all," the woman replied, seeming to open her eyes with a little effort.</p> 
                  <p>"Then you are better?" the boy cried, hopefully.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, and I shall soon be wholly well."</p> 
                  <p>Little Clara heard these words, and with a joyful utterance she started towards the bedside.</p> 
                  <p>"Mamma will get well," she said, taking the invalid's hand and kissing it.</p> 
                  <p>The sick woman placed her arm about the neck of the affectionate child and drew it upon her bosom.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, Clara," she replied, in a low, husky tone, "I shall soon be well, but not here in this world-not here, my children. You have heard me read in the Bible of that place where 'the weary are at rest,' and where there is no more pain, nor sorrow, nor suffering. I am going there soon. I shall be happy there. And do you know why I shall be so happy?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because you have been so good here," quickly answered the boy.</p> 
                  <p>"That is one reason, said the mother, "but there is another, and one full as important. Do you remember that I have told you that when I went to heaven I should look down upon you if I could?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," answered both the little ones.</p> 
                  <p>"Then how do you suppose I should feel, if I should look down upon you and find you naughty and wicked, just as some of the children are whom you have seen in the streets?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, but we never shall be so," uttered Henry; and Clara joined in the assurance.</p> 
                  <p>"Then I shall be very happy. And let me tell you this once more, my children: When I am gone, I hope you will remember that your mother may be looking down upon you, and witnessing everything you do. Never forget this, for it will be a help to you through life."</p> 
                  <p>"But you aren't going to leave us now, mother," the boy said, as the idea seemed to present itself before all others.</p> 
                  <p>The sick woman closed her eyes, and for some moments she was silent. That loud, painful breathing which had marked her disease for a long while was gone, and now she breathed lowly and without much apparent effort. Henry did not notice how weak and low her voice was, for he thought she only whispered because she chose so to do.</p> 
                  <p>"Mother," he at length said, "do you not want something?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, my dear boy," she replied, reopening her eyes.</p> 
                  <p>"But shan't I warm some of your gruel? Mrs. Bascom will come before long, but I can warm it as well as she can."</p> 
                  <p>This Mrs. Bascom was a neighbor who had been hired by the physician to nurse the sick woman, and sometimes, when her patient seemed easy, she was in the habit of spending the night at her own home, leaving the boy to watch.</p> 
                  <p>"What time is it?" the woman asked, turning her head with difficulty towards the window, over which hung a curtain of blue paper.</p> 
                  <p>"I should think the sun rose just as you waked up," was the boy's answer.</p> 
                  <p>"Then Mrs. Bascom will be here before long." And again the invalid closed her eyes. This time she remained silent longer than before, and at length the children, thinking that their mother had fallen asleep, turned away from the bed, but ere they had reached the stove, they were called back. Henry was startled when he saw the change which had come over her face, for he could not but notice it.</p> 
                  <p>"Henry-Clara-my children,"-she said, "I feel very strangely. I shall not be with you much longer."</p> 
                  <p>"Let me go and call Mrs. Bascom," cried the boy.</p> 
                  <p>"No," returned the woman, "for then you might not hear me speak my last words. No power on earth can help me. The Lord has called me, and I must go."</p> 
                  <p>The sick woman's voice grew more weak and husky, and her eyes began to lose their lustre.</p> 
                  <p>"Henry," she said, after an interval of silence, "go to my little bureau in the other room, and in the upper drawer you will find a small wooden box. Bring it to me."</p> 
                  <p>The boy turned away and went into a little bedroom where there was no article of furniture save the pine bureau in question. He found the box and carried it to the bedside. The woman took it, but she had not the strength to open it. It was only fastened by a little hook. She gave it back to Henry and asked him to raise the lid. He did so, and within he found only a small paper parcel. This he took out and opened, and he soon came to a small <emph>iron cross</emph>, or crucifix. It was a simple thing, not more than two inches in length, and though it had once been brightly polished, it was now dimmed, and in spots it had begun to rust. At the top was a steel ring through which was run a piece of faded blue ribbon.</p> 
                  <p>"What have you found?" asked the sick woman, painfully, and with much effort.</p> 
                  <p>"A little iron cross," answered the boy.</p> 
                  <p>"Let me have it."</p> 
                  <p>Henry placed it in her hand, but she could not raise it up so as to look upon it. Yet she worked it in her fingers as though she would make sure 'twas the article she meant, and then she bade Henry take it again.</p> 
                  <p>"My children," she said, "this is a simple thing, but 'tis all I have to leave you by which to remember your mother-all of outward circumstances, I mean. But even this has much significance. When you look upon it, you will remember two faithful friends-your Saviour and your mother. O, you will not forget the lessons of good you have learned. "Henry, you must be faithful and kind."</p> 
                  <p>"Surely I will, my mother," returned the boy, while the tears began to gather in his eyes.</p> 
                  <p>"I know you will. Clara."</p> 
                  <p>The little girl started forward and placed her tiny hands upon her mother's arm.</p> 
                  <p>"That cross is as much yours as it is Henry's. You will keep it sometimes-but be sure that you do not lose it. It is-"</p> 
                  <p>The speaker's voice failed her for the while, and the unfinished sentence ended in a low gasp. At length, however, she opened her eyes again, and while the shade grew deeper upon her face, she murmured:</p> 
                  <p>"Keep it, and when you look upon it remember your God, and your Christ, and your mother. Kiss me-"</p> 
                  <p>With convulsive movements both the children sprang forward and kissed the dying woman's pale cheeks, and with the last effort of expiring strength she clasped them to her bosom.</p> 
                  <p>"You will not forget me-you will always be good-and you will never-"</p> 
                  <p>Her voice failed her, and her arms sank by her side. A few moments she remained thus, and then, with a sort of natural, instinctive movement, she raised both hands to her bosom and crossed them there. Her eyes were opened wide, and her gaze was fixed upon a point where a sunbeam, which stole through a small hole in the curtain, rested upon the wall. Her breathing was now heavy and seemingly painful, the gasps coming at regular intervals, and loud.</p> 
                  <p>"Mother," whispered Henry, reaching over so as to lay his hand upon her arm. "Mother-wont you speak to us some more? Shan't I run for the doctor?-mother-mother!"</p> 
                  <p>But she did not answer, nor did she show by a single motion that she heard. Her eyes were <choice>
                        <sic>stil</sic>
                        <corr>still</corr>
                     </choice> open wide, and fixed on the sunbeam, and ever and anon her bosom would rise and fall as the heavy gasps came at intervals which grew longer and longer. Again and again did the boy call for his mother to speak to him, but she heard him not.</p> 
                  <p>"Why don't she speak?" asked the little girl, with more of wonder than of fear.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Perhaps she cannot, Clara."</p> 
                  <p>"Then we must give her some medicine."</p> 
                  <p>"-sh!" said Henry, raising his hand towards his sister. The gasps of the dying woman had become so long, and so far between, that at each one her breath seemed gone. After the boy uttered his admonition to his little companion, there came one more gasp, and it was longer and more spasmodic than the others. Then the bosom sank into quiet, a strange shade passed over the face, and the light of the eye went out. Long and anxiously did the children wait for another breath, but it came not. The thin lips had turned ashy, and the eyes were now leaden in their hue.</p> 
                  <p>"What alls her?" whispered Clara.</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>She's dead!</emph>" answered Henry, convulsively. He had never seen death before, though he had a faint recollection of seeing a dead father, yet he knew it was death which he saw now. A few moments' after he had answered his sister he remained silent, but his emotions soon gained utterance, and with one deep groan of anguish he threw himself upon the bed and burst into tears.</p> 
                  <p>Half an hour afterwards some of those who lived near saw that there was no smoke from the chimney of the humble cot, and they hastened in. They found the room cold and dark, the fire having all gone out. Upon the bed they found the poor widow dead and stiff, while at her feet lay the two children, clasped in each other's arms, sobbing as though their hearts were breaking.</p> 
                  <p>"Poor Nancy Wallace!" uttered one of the visitors, placing the corner of her apron to her eyes. "She's at rest now!"</p> 
                  <p>"God knows she has suffered enough," added another, "and may he be merciful to her now!"</p> 
                  <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>Two weeks had passed away, and the widow had been buried. A few friends-members of a female benevolent society, placed a simple stone at the head of her grave, upon which was chiselled the name-"NANCY WALLACE."</p> 
                  <p>Henry Wallace knew that some one had sent the doctor to attend his mother, but not until after she was dead did he know that the officers of the town had done this. Just two weeks after the death of Mrs. Wallace, did the children find a home beneath the roof of a neighbor, and at the end of that time some men came and took them away in a wagon, and carried them to a great brick house which stood at the other end of the town. It was the poorhouse, but they were too young to know all the evils that cling to that place. People were kind to them, and they were grateful, for they were only children.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE MURDER.-THE MINIATURE.</head> 
                  <p>FROM the country village we go to the great city, and in the passage we pass over sixteen years. Great changes have taken place during that time. Men have become old and feeble; towns and cities have altered; thousands of animate beings have passed away into the valley of death; thousands have been ushered upon the stage of life, while young children have become men and maidens.</p> 
                  <p>Near one of the principal thoroughfares of the great city, in a small, clean court, was located the office of Isaiah Beckwith, Esq Mr. Beckwith was a lawyer of considerable eminence, whose head was frosted by the touch of time, and whose mind was stored and enriched with the experience of many years, threescore of which had at least passed over his head. It was well into the evening, but the old lawyer was still in his office, for he had business of importance on hand. He was not a very tall man, but yet tall enough. He had a broad, full chest, displaying much vital power, and the color and clearness of his skin showed that his life had been a temperate one, both in eating and drinking. There was none of those hard lines about his features which most people are apt to look for upon a lawyer's face, but his countenance was the index to a noble soul, and a kind, generous disposition.</p> 
                  <p>At a desk in one corner of the office sat a young man engaged in writing. He was not over two-and-twenty years of age, and though his face bore all the beauty and clearness of youth, yet his frame was stout and full. He was not very tall, but he was plump and round in limb, and of such proportions as best suit the true idea of manhood. His hair was of a brown hue, rich and glossy, and his eye of a lustrous gray. He wrote very rapidly, seeming to be engaged in copying. At length he stopped, closed his book, and having carefully wiped his pen he placed it in a small rack for that purpose.</p> 
                  <p>"How now, Henry?" spoke the old man, as he noticed his clerk's motions. "Aren't you going to finish to-night?"</p> 
                  <p>"All done, sir," replied the youth, with some pride in his tone.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you mean that you have copied all the instruments I gave you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir."</p> 
                  <p>The old man went around and opened the book which the youth had just closed. He found the instruments not only all copied, but done in a bold, full, plain and handsome hand.</p> 
                  <p>"Henry Wallace, you are more than a common man," spoke Isaiah Beckwith, with enthusiasm. "How do you contrive to do so much?"</p> 
                  <p>"Industry, sir, is the main secret; though I suppose perseverance has brought me the ability."</p> 
                  <p>"You are right, Henry-you are right. And now let me tell you that you must not hide your talents from the world longer. You must mingle more in society."</p> 
                  <p>"Not yet, air, not yet," said the youth, with a strange expression.</p> 
                  <p>"But you've got to do it at some time, and why not commence now?"</p> 
                  <p>"As soon as I am admitted to the bar it will be time enough for me to seek company. I have no desire to seek it now."</p> 
                  <p>"But why not? Now, Henry, I want you to be frank with me. Here you have been with me over three years, a smart, active, intelligent, handsome youth. Don't hang down your head, for you know I speak the truth. Here you have been all this while, and yet you will not mingle at all in society. Now, why is it?"</p> 
                  <p>Henry Wallace stood for some time in silence, but at length he spoke, but in a tone of frankness which gave the note of truth to all he said:</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Beckwith, I do not wonder when I think of it, that my conduct appears strange, but you shall know the whole truth, and then you will wonder no more. Of my father, air, I can remember nothing, save a faint idea of having seen his cold, stiff corse, which idea clung to my memory through fear and fright. When I was five years old my mother was taken sick, and for a whole year she was confined to her bed most of the time. We were very poor, more so than I was then able to conceive of. One cold, bleak morning in mid-winter my mother died. My sister and I stood by her bedside and saw her die, and then we sank down and wept. A friend took us home, but we did not stay there long. We were sent to the-<emph>poorhouse!</emph>
                  </p> 
                  <p>The youth stopped here and bowed his head, for painful recollections came crowding upon him. At length he continued:</p> 
                  <p>"In that poorhouse we-my sister and myself-remained seven years, and during that time I suffered everything of reproach, slander and contumely. I and sister commenced to go to school, but we were taunted by the favored children of fortune, because we were inmates of the almshouse, and we had to leave school. But our mother had made us promise that we would study when we had a chance, so Clara and I studied our books at home, and an old man who had once been a lawyer helped us. When I was thirteen years old, a man came to the poorhouse to see if he could find a good boy to take and bring up. He saw me and liked my looks, and asked me if I would like to go with him? I told him I should, if he would take my sister, too. 'But,' said I to him, 'if they send me with you without my sister, you must not place any confidence in me, for I promise you most faithfully that I shall run away on the first opportunity.' He seemed rather pleased at this, and finally agreed to take Clara with me. That man was Adam Wagner, and, as you already know, he proved a true friend to me. With him I lived six years, and during all that time both Clara and myself had free access to his library. When he and his family got ready to sail for Europe, he sent me to you, and obtained for Clara the place she has since held."</p> 
                  <p>"And this is the history of your life?" said the old man, with a beaming look.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir, in outline."</p> 
                  <p>"And what is there here to debar you from mingling in society, I should like to know! Why, solemnly, Henry, I shall respect you now more than ever."</p> 
                  <p>"Will you, sir?" uttered the youth, while a moisture gathered in his eyes.</p> 
                  <p>"Most surely I shall. But you have not answered my question yet?"</p> 
                  <p>"I can answer it in a very few words, sir. There are young men here in the city-some of them just commenced in law-who know the history of my early life, and already I have had the finger of scorn pointed at me, and the taunt of the <emph>poorhouse</emph> thrown out. Should I mix with society, I should be inevitably thrown into company with these very men."</p> 
                  <p>"And what care you for them, Henry?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing now, sir; but 'twould gall me to have the taunt flung at me in public."</p> 
                  <p>"But sensible men would not join in it or notice it."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps you are right there; but after all, what am I to gain by subjecting myself to be brought in the way of the dirty stuff? I am not yet old enough to associate with the solid men of the city, and as for the mass of the young men whom I have seen, I care but little for them, sincerely believing that I am better off as it is."</p> 
                  <p>"Upon the whole, Henry, I don't know but that you are right," said the old man, frankly, "But I wish to ask you one more question: How is your sister satisfied with her present position?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, sir," answered the young man, sadly, "she does not like it at all. Mr. Loman is proud and overbearing, and his eldest daughter is worse still. She has her patience and temper most sorely tried there."</p> 
                  <p>"So I feared," said Beckwith. "I know John Loman well, and I feared Clara would not, be happy there. I wish, for your sake as well as<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6097-00000004"/> here, that I had a family. We should make quite a happy household."</p> 
                  <p>"You have been alone many years, sir?"</p> 
                  <p>"Mostly alone for twenty years. My wife died just twenty years ago, and my son has been away most of the time since. But we have both of us more cause for joy than sorrow, and surely more cause for hope than for repining. I am approaching the evening of my days with a clear conscience, and to you life is opening a fair field of promise. Go on, my son-go on as you have begun, and good men shall bless you, and bid their children be like you."</p> 
                  <p>The old man extended his hand as he spoke, and the youth grasped it with a fervent grip. Shortly afterwards they separated for the night, the lawyer going towards his hotel, and the youthful student and clerk taking his way towards the quarter where stood his no less respectable, but more humble, boarding-house.</p> 
                  <p>It was late in the evening and very dark, and a chilly March wind was howling through the streets and about the sharp angles of the buildings. Henry's nearest way to his boarding-place was through a narrow alley which crossed no less than five streets in its course. This way was by no means a pleasant one after dark, but the youth knew nothing of fear, and he took it on the present occasion. He had passed half through the alley when his attention was arrested by the sound of deep groaning not far off. He stopped a moment, and found that the sound proceeded from some point ahead, and on he pushed with quick steps, feeling sure that some fellow-being was in distress. In a few moments he reached the place where an old smithy had been burned down only a month before, and just as he stopped he saw a watchman approaching from the opposite direction with a lantern.</p> 
                  <p>The rays of light from this lantern shot into the black, charred space where the smithy had stood, and as Henry instinctively cast his eyes that way, he saw two men-one of them prostrate, and the other bending over him with a knife in his hand. This view was but for an instant, for no sooner did the light of the watchman's lantern shine into the place than the assassin leaped to his feet. Henry saw that his face was black, and on the next instant he leaped upon him; but the villain was quick, and eluded our hero's blow. Henry's next movement was to make a grasp at him-he aimed to seize him by the arms, but the fellow leaped quickly aside, and the youth's grasp was of but little effect, one hand having clutched the whisker upon his black cheek, and the other his vest. As the scamp tore away, Henry felt something in each hand, but in his haste of pursuit he thrust the articles into his pocket and then joined the watchman.</p> 
                  <p>Had this latter individual been half as eager and active as Henry Wallace the villain might have been easily captured, but he had only held up his lantern and looked on until the bird had fairly flown, and then he woke the night air with his howling for assistance.</p> 
                  <p>It was soon evident to Henry that the murderer was gone for the present, and he turned back towards the spot where the affray had taken place. He found some dozen people collected there, two of whom were watchmen. Upon the ground, or rather upon a heap of coal and ashes, lay a well-dressed man, from a wound in whose breast the warm blood was yet oozing. He was dead, and had evidently been robbed, for a large pocket-book lay open by his side marked all over with finger-prints of blood. Henry waited until he was assured no one present knew the victim, and then he went his way without hinting the part he had acted upon the premises. He had no desire to run the risk of having a policeman or watchman lug him off to the lock-up, and keep him there for a witness, though he intended to come forward if he should find any need of it.</p> 
                  <p>When the youth reached his boarding house he took a lamp and went at once to his room, and when once there, his first movement was to look at the prizes he had captured. The first was a gold watch-seal very beautifully carved, representing a couchant lion upon a richly chased gold table, beneath which was set a very large blood cornelian. This stone bore a signet, which appeared to have the initials "J. C." After a little further examination, Henry found that the cornelian was shut down with a clasp, and on opening it he found one of the most exquisite miniatures he had ever seen. It was of a young female, and evidently painted on ivory.</p> 
                  <p>The next prize was not quite so inviting, yet Henry thought it worth keeping. It was simply a bunch of crisp, curly hair, but even this had something curious about it, for it was of such a texture as never grew on a man's face, being nothing more nor less than such hair as is used for stuffing cushions, mattresses, etc. Nor was this all. The bunch, or tuft, was attached to a piece of black silk some two inches long, and torn in rectangular shape about an inch wide.</p> 
                  <p>For a long while the youth sat and gazed upon the miniature he had thus strangely found. It was the transcript of one of the most lovely faces he had ever seen. The features were faultlessly regular, and sweet in tone, while a smile almost heavenly seemed to rest upon them. The hair, which was of a rich brown, hung in clustering ringlets, and the open, fair brow was all sunshine and truth. The face was surely that of a young female, but yet not young enough for a girl. Henry Wallace became almost fascinated by that face, and it was not until the clock struck the hour of midnight that he laid it aside. The hair he folded carefully in a paper, and then placed it in his trunk, for he knew enough of law to know how important such things sometimes are. But the seal he could not give up yet. He laid it upon his dressing-case, and finally, when he had got into bed, he placed it beneath his pillow.</p> 
                  <p>That night he had any quantity of dreams to visit him, but foremost of them all were those in which the sweet face of the miniature held a prominent place. The last dream sent an angel to lead him away to heaven. The angel wore the face of the picture that lay beneath his pillow, only she looked more sad than smiling, and while the youth questioned her authority for taking him away she fell to weeping. At this he sprang forward to catch her in his arms and kiss away the tears, and-he awoke. The sun was shining brightly into his window, and the bell was just ringing for breakfast.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">ROSAMOND.</head> 
                  <p>WHEN Henry reached the office he found a fire already built, and the floor swept. The boy tried to grumble some at being kept so long from his breakfast, but the smiles and kind explanation of the young student quickly disarmed him of all bad feelings, and he finally said to himself, that 'twas "some comfort to wait for a gentleman who knew sunth'n." Very few lawyers' clerks and students would have stooped to ask the pardon of a poor office-boy, but Henry did it and he made a friend by it.</p> 
                  <p>As soon as the boy was gone the youth took the morning paper, and erelong he found a flaming account of the "<emph>murder</emph>" of the night before. In addition to what Henry already knew, he learned from this account that the body of the murdered man had been taken to one of the station houses, and there recognized as a noted gamester and jockey. It was supposed that he had been followed from some gaming house, perhaps by a man who had lost to him, and then robbed. At first Henry thought of informing Mr. Beckwith of what he had seen, but upon mature deliberation he resolved to keep the whole affair to himself, at least until he could see some need of his moving in the matter.</p> 
                  <p>Perhaps one reason for his chosen course was a wish to keep the seal and miniature which had so strangely come into his possession. At any rate he had no desire to give it up, though he would not have kept it a moment had he reason to believe that the ends of justice would be more quickly answered by his giving it up. He reasoned with himself in this fashion:</p> 
                  <p>"If I give this seal up there will be some noise, or at least publicity given to it, and then the owner will keep shy and dark. But if I keep it, I may find the original of the miniature, and thus, in time, perhaps trap the murderer. I will keep my eyes open, and I may yet solve the mystery."</p> 
                  <p>It was near the middle of the forenoon when Mr. Beckwith entered the office, and he seemed to have been at work hard.</p> 
                  <p>"Henry," he said, about an hour afterwards, "I have learned some news this morning, and I make you acquainted with it now, so that you may not learn of it accidentally, and then go and tell of it. Mr. Loman is on the brink of bankruptcy."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you mean John Loman?" asked the youth, with much surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. The man in whose family your sister resides."</p> 
                  <p>"But I thought him worth three hundred thousand at least?"</p> 
                  <p>"So do most of his friends. But some of his creditors have called upon me this morning, and we find that he has been in the hands of the Jews for some time. For the last two months he has paid over twenty thousand dollars in interest on short accommodations."</p> 
                  <p>"Is it possible!"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-but the crash has not come yet. He is not quite gone, and may, with his present means, stagger along for a month more. At the end of that time," added the old lawyer, with a smile, "he may find a bridge that will carry him safely over. He is now hunting after a rich widow!"</p> 
                  <p>"And who knows but he may find one?" said Henry, with a light laugh. "He could afford to put up with quite an elderly one, and if I mistake not, there are some wealthy old dowagers in our city."</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly; and that is the reason why we would keep his precarious situation a secret. If he manages to find a wealthy wife he may save himself, whereas, were his real position known, such a woman might not have him. I know it is not a very honorable thing to help shield such men, but the society of our city in which he moves is made up of what we might term <hi rend="i"/>life-gamesters. You can hardly find one of them who is not ready at any moment to gamble away real peace and honor for glitter and show. The click of gold is of more account than the voice of prayer, and the gleaming of paltry jewels is of more worth than the pure light of modesty and virtue. Mr. Loman is a man of the world, and can he find a wealthy dowager who wants to make a little more show in fashionable life, his domestic habits will afford her an excellent opportunity."</p> 
                  <p>Henry promised that he would say nothing in public of Loman's affairs, and then he resumed his business. When evening came the youth ate his supper at a restaurant, and then took his way towards the fashionable part of the city for the purpose of visiting his sister.</p> 
                  <p>John Loman's house was one of those magnificent structures which great wealth affords, and stood in the very centre of the haunts of the aristocracy. When Henry reached it he entered the court and rang at one of the wing doors. His summons was answered by a foot-boy, of whom he inquired for Miss Wallace. Clara was soon at the door, and in a moment more the brother and sister were locked in each other's arms.</p> 
                  <p>The poor orphan girl had grown to be a most beautiful maiden. In form she was slightly below a medium stature, but her frame was rounded to such exquisite proportions that no sculptor could have wished to make an addition to it. Those ringlets, which in childhood were of a sunny hue, were now changed to a rich, bright brown, and the full, clear eye of that deep, sparkling gray which marks the intellectual, strong-minded woman. Henry Wallace was proud of his sister, and in his opinion there was but one other girl in the city so beautiful, and that one was a dweller beneath the same roof with his sister.</p> 
                  <p>Clara led her brother to a little sitting-room which she was privileged to use, and there sat down and talked over the things and scenes of bygone days. At length Henry approached a subject nearer to the present.</p> 
                  <p>"Clara," he said, with some hesitation, "I want you to tell me the truth now. Are you contented in your present situation?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why do you ask?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because Mr. Beckwith can get you a good place if we wish."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't think I would change now, Henry, for I am satisfied that these wealthy families are all alike, or nearly so. There are some sources of vexation, and some of pleasure, in them all."</p> 
                  <p>"But do you find any source of pleasure here, my sister?"</p> 
                  <p>"O yes, I do now. Mr. Loman is sometimes disagreeable, and Arabella, his eldest daughter, is harsh, haughty and overbearing; but Rosamond Loman is almost an angel. She loves me now, I know, and I love her. Even the clouds which Arabella's unkindness casts over my path are made all sunshine by Rosamond's goodness and sweet companionship."</p> 
                  <p>The rich blood mounted to Henry's brow as his sister thus spoke, but he tried to overcome the emotion. He had seen Rosamond Loman, and she was the one whom he thought a rival, almost, for his sister in beauty.</p> 
                  <p>"Does she spend much time with you?" the youth at length asked.</p> 
                  <p>"O yes, a great deal. She would have spent the whole of this evening with me if you had not come. Her father and sister have gone to a party, and will be away until very late."</p> 
                  <p>Just as Clara thus spoke an Irish girl looked into the room, and informed her that Miss Rosamond wanted to see her.</p> 
                  <p>"I will be back in a moment," the girl said, as she arose to leave her brother.</p> 
                  <p>"Stop a moment," rejoined Henry. "If Miss Loman would like your company this evening, I will take my leave at once, and call again when her sister is at home."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no, my brother. I cannot spare you."</p> 
                  <p>Clara kissed him on the cheek as she spoke, and then left the room. She was gone about ten minutes, and when she returned there was a strange smile upon her face.</p> 
                  <p>"Henry," she said, "Miss Loman sends her compliments, and wishes to know if you will not allow me to keep her company this evening by honoring her with your own."</p> 
                  <p>The young man started half up, and then sank back again.</p> 
                  <p>"She-she-only said that as a gentle hint for me to leave," he uttered, tremulously.</p> 
                  <p>"You are mistaken, I assure you. She does really wish you to come with me."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no-you can go alone," said Henry still trembling.</p> 
                  <p>"But she will not receive me alone. She bade me, if you did not wish to come, to remain with you."</p> 
                  <p>"Then I will-will-"</p> 
                  <p>"You will go," interrupted Clara, with a meaning smile. "So come."</p> 
                  <p>Henry Wallace arose and followed his sister from the room, and on his way through the hall he muttered to himself concerning the folly of being so affected. He denominated himself "a fool" for thinking of such a thing as emotion in connection with Rosamond Loman, and by the time he reached the drawing-room he had become very calm. When he entered the apartment where the young lady sat, he found it lighted by two brilliant jets of gas, which were softened by globes of ground glass. Rosamond arose as he entered, and his sister introduced him. They had seen each other several times before, but never to speak.</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond Loman was no taller than Clara, but she was more plump in form, and seemed more happy and smiling. In fact, her sunny, dimpled face was fashioned for smiles, and a look or thought of evil feeling seemed never to have made an impress there. Her hair was of a sunny, golden auburn, and her laughter-loving eyes of a deep blue.</p> 
                  <p>And yet a nobler-looking man than Henry Wallace never entered that drawing-room, and Clara, as she gazed upon him, felt more pride in her brother than she would have dared to confess. His dark brown hair gathered in small curls about one of the fairest brows that ever marked the intellectual man, and his waking smile led the thoughts to a soul as free from guile as an infant's.</p> 
                  <p>For awhile the conversation was lame and profitless, for both Henry and the young hostess were embarrassed and troubled; but erelong the ice was broken, and their tongues moved with more freedom. Rosamond asked Clara to take a seat at the piano. While in the family of Mr. Wagner both the orphans had devoted much of their time to music, their kind master giving them every facility in his power, and hence when Clara left his roof she was well qualified to teach music. She seated herself at the piano without any excuse, and asked her young mistress what she should play.</p> 
                  <p>"Play and sing me something," replied Rosamond.</p> 
                  <p>"Then my brother must help me," returned Clara.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you sing?" quickly asked Rosamond, turning to her guest.</p> 
                  <p>"Sometimes," returned Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"Then you must certainly accompany Clara, for I know of no music that pleases me more than the harmony of the male and female voices."</p> 
                  <p>Henry bowed, and then went and stood by his sister's side. Clara selected a piece they had often sang together-a sweet, home song-and commenced it. At first the youth's voice was tremulous, but soon it became full, steady and strong, and its melody was as rich as the notes of an organ. Clara was a sweet singer, and so much had she practised with her brother, that their voices blended with a harmony never excelled by art. Rosamond was in raptures, and for half an hour they sang to please her.</p> 
                  <p>"One more," she said, at the end of that time. "Only sing me one more, and then we will converse again."</p> 
                  <p>"What shall it be, sister?" asked Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"Let it be 'Our Prayer.'"</p> 
                  <p>"Can you sing it?" the youth asked, while a shade of sadness passed over his fine features.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. I love to sing it."</p> 
                  <p>"Then let it be that."</p> 
                  <p>"You must play it."</p> 
                  <p>Henry made no answer, but as Clara arose he took his seat at the piano. It was a noble instrument, and though Henry was not so practised a performer as his sister, yet his touch had that peculiar boldness and power which marks the true man. He played a minor prelude of most touching sweetness, and then he commenced the song alone. He sang the first verse addressed to his sister. Clara sang the second, addressed to him, and the rest they rang in concert. The piece was a simple prayer of two orphan hearts, and it was the life-story of their souls. When Henry turned away from the piano he found Rosamond in tears, and fairly sobbing.</p> 
                  <p>"Where did you find that?" she asked, as soon as she could command her speech. "Never did I hear anything so touchingly beautiful."</p> 
                  <p>"It is the simple story of a poor orphan," returned Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"I know," said Rosamond. "My own heart told me that, for you know I am an orphan, too. My sainted mother has heard many a prayer like that from me-like that in spirit. I must find the song."</p> 
                  <p>"I will teach it to you," said Clara.</p> 
                  <p>"It is not published?"</p> 
                  <p>Clara bent over and whispered in Rosamond's ear. She whispered that Henry composed both the words and the music. The young hostess regarded the youth with a look of frank admiration, and shortly afterward she went and sat down by his side on one of the sofas.</p> 
                  <p>"You have paid much attention to music, sir," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"Only for my own amusement and recreation," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"But you must be fond of it?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am. I think God made music to relieve the worn and wearied soul. At least, I have found much comfort in it."</p> 
                  <p>"So have I. Before my mother died I loved music only when she played and sang for me. Such exercises as others performed had no music for me. Since my bereavement, I have loved true music; and, sir, permit me to say, that this evening I have heard the sweetest harmony and the deepest soul of music, that it has ever been my fortune to listen to beneath this roof."</p> 
                  <p>"You flatter me, lady."</p> 
                  <p>"If I do, I have at least the excuse that I speak the truth."</p> 
                  <p>Henry Wallace was perfectly enchanted. There was something in the very presence of Rosamond Loman that made his heart best quicker, but now that of her own accord she sat by his side, his emotions were almost wild. He was not only in love, but he knew it. He knew that the sweet face and the still sweeter disposition had enchanted his heart.</p> 
                  <p>At length the conversation took a turn upon the various phases of society, and Henry's feelings were not a little lightened when he heard from Rosamond's own lips that she despised the<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6097-00000005"/> empty show-by which she was continually surrounded at her father's house. He expressed himself freely, and in such a manner that his listeners both showed themselves more than ordinarily interested in his conversation.</p> 
                  <p>Henry had just concluded an account of a peculiar law case which had lately come under his observation, when the clock upon a neighboring church commenced to strike. He listened, and he counted twelve strokes.</p> 
                  <p>"It is twelve o'clock," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"Pardon me," Henry resumed, in a low, tremulous tone, "I did not dream that I was encroaching on your time in such a manner."</p> 
                  <p>"I will pardon you on one condition," returned Rosamond, with a happy smile; "and that is, that you and your sister shall spend another evening with me when I am lonesome?"</p> 
                  <p>"I shall come to see my sister often, lady, and I shall not refuse an evening of such pure pleasure as this has been, if it is offered me."</p> 
                  <p>Henry took his leave, and instinctively Rosamond accompanied him to the door. To be sure, Clara went also, for the young hostess would hardly have gone alone.</p> 
                  <p>And Henry Wallace passed another night of dreams. The face of the seal was forgotten, now, for he had a face as sweet engraven on his heart.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE COUNTESS OF ERROL.</head> 
                  <p>THE aristocracy of the great city was in motion. A live countess had arrived, and was stopping with her suite at one of the principal hotels. She was an English lady-her name was booked as Matilda Landowne, and she was Countess of Errol. She was also a widow, and worth many millions of dollars. Of course society was all agog. Billets and cards flooded in upon her until she was forced to throw them aside without opening them, and so many people asked for admittance that she was obliged to close her doors to all. She was a noble-looking woman, not over forty, and yet retaining all the freshness and beauty of her younger days. A close observer would have seen that the color of her cheeks was natural, and that the rich, dark curls that clustered about her neck and temples were the product of her own head. She was of medium size, rather prone to <foreign xml:lang="FRA">embonpoint</foreign>, but of fine proportions. She had only two servants with her, both girls, intending to hire a carriage as she wanted it.</p> 
                  <p>One morning when Mr. John Loman entered his counting-room, he found a note directed to himself, and on breaking the seal, he read as follows:</p>

                  </q> 
                  <p>The card was a richly-embossed thing, bearing the escutcheon of the Earl of Errol, and containing the simple name, "<hi rend="i"/>Landowne."</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Loman was all of a tremor. What could the countess want of him? For an hour he walked up and down his counting-room trying to study up some reasonable probability as to the cause or intent of this unexpected summons, but he could not think of anything that appeared plausible.</p> 
                  <p>"By my soul!" he uttered to himself; "it's lucky I haven't proposed yet to any of my widowed friends-for why may I not stand a chance here?"</p> 
                  <p>And upon this idea the merchant allowed his mind to run with much hope. At ten o'clock, he went home and dressed himself in his most fashionable suit. He found his children both in the library, and to them he communicated the startling news.</p> 
                  <p>"What can it be?" exclaimed Arabella, the oldest girl, jumping to her feet and clapping her hands. "O, you'll make her visit here-wont you, papa?"</p> 
                  <p>"If I can, of course I shall."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella was a tall, proud girl, with a face of some beauty, but which had become sadly marred by the evil passions to which she had given a home in her bosom. Her hair was black, and so were her eyes-just like her father's. It may have seemed strange to some that there should be such a difference in the two sisters; but those who had been long acquainted with the family did not wonder at all, for they knew that Arabella was like her father-that she had inherited his strong temper and inordinate pride. But Rosamond had received her characteristics from her mother. That mother had been one of the sweetest creatures-a high-minded, kind, loving, virtuous woman. She had been brought up in honest poverty, but as she approached womanhood, a relative bequeathed her a fortune, and John Loman married her. She never loved wealth, save in so far as it could be the means of enabling her to do good, and it had ever been her aim to teach her children to set no great hopes upon gold, but rather to found their hopes on those noble qualities of the soul which misfortune cannot take away. Arabella would never listen to such teaching, but Rosamond was an attentive scholar, and she had not forgotten one of the valuable lessons her sainted mother had taught her.</p> 
                  <p>"Do make her come, if you can," cried Arabella. "O, if she would only visit here first! Do make her come, papa."</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond said nothing, for in truth she cared nothing about it; only she felt some curiosity to know what the countess could want of her father, although even that curiosity she kept to herself.</p> 
                  <p>Precisely at eleven o'clock, Mr. Loman was at the office of the hotel, and having handed the card to the clerk, he was shown up to one of the private parlors, and in a few moments afterwards he was joined by the countess. She looked very beautiful, but yet she was dressed plainly, without ornament of any kind, and even without gloves. She bowed very gracefully, and with a smile extended her hand.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Loman, I think?"</p> 
                  <p>"That's my name, madam. And you are the Countess of Errol?"</p> 
                  <p>"My name is Landowne, sir; but I suppose I must put off my title in your republican country."</p> 
                  <p>"O, not by any means, madam!" cried Loman, with enthusiasm. "Say, rather we should have them introduced here."</p> 
                  <p>"That would be useless, sir; for, if I mistake not, you have a nobility here far more worthy than the titled ones of Europe. But I suppose I am Countess of Errol. I had the fortune to marry a most excellent husband, and he had the misfortune to be an earl," quietly replied the lady.</p> 
                  <p>"Misfortune, madam?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, for the duties of his office wore his life away."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah," said the scheming merchant, assuming a sad tone to echo the sadness of the lady's last remark, "then you know what it is to lose the companion of one's love? I have borne that grief. Ah, what a season of domestic darkness follows such a bereavement!"</p> 
                  <p>"It is sad, sir," returned the countess, with much feeling.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay," added Loman, feeling sure that he had discovered the way to the widow's heart, "it is not only sad, but the heart almost breaks beneath the burden. O, what should we be without the faith of kind heaven in such an hour!"</p> 
                  <p>"You speak truly now, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"Because I speak from experience, lady. But I will not intrude my private feelings upon a stranger."</p> 
                  <p>"I beg you will consider your words of sympathy no intrusion, sir, for I assure you that they touch a sympathizing chord in my bosom; and, moreover, a friend who can sympathize with me in sorrow, as well as in joy, is a boon I had not expected readily to find here."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, madam, experience in sorrow makes friends very quickly, sometimes. Why is it that thus to you for the first time I speak my soul's deepest feelings? During a widowhood of five years, I have not before spoken such words outside of my own family circle as I have now spoken to you. But something in your very face told me that I might find sympathy in your soul. Alas, we find not how cold the world can be, until misfortune overtakes us! I have literally crowded my way through the host of flatterers who have surrounded me, but few real friends could I prove. I doubt not you have experienced the same?"</p> 
                  <p>"I think so," returned the lady; and a faint smile crept over her face as she spoke. "But I suppose you are anxious to know why I sent for you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Of course I am anxious to know."</p> 
                  <p>"Then draw your chair nearer, and I will open the business. You are acquainted with a Mr. Adam Wagner?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, madam. He was one of my dearest friends. He is in Europe, now."</p> 
                  <p>"I saw him in London," resumed the countess, "and he directed me to call upon you as the one most likely to help me in my present business."</p> 
                  <p>"If it be anything within my power, madam, you may trust me."</p> 
                  <p>The countess called to her attendant and bade her see that no one was admitted to disturb her, and then she bade Mr. Loman follow her. She led the way to a smaller apartment where there was a desk and writing materials, and having taken a seat, she opened one of the departments of the desk, and took therefrom a package of papers. One of these she drew out and opened. It contained two pages of closely-written matter, and its appearance evidently indicated it had been very recently written.</p> 
                  <p>"Here, sir," she said, "is a plain statement of my business, and in placing it in your hands, I feel that I am trusting one in whom I may repose the fullest confidence. Not a word of this do I wish you to speak to any one."</p> 
                  <p>"You may trust me, madam, even with your life itself; and you may also rest under the assurance that the more faithfully I serve you, the more joy shall I feel."</p> 
                  <p>"Then, sir, will you read this? I might have told it all in words, but I chose to write it down."</p> 
                  <p>John Loman took the paper and commenced to read.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha," he uttered, after having read a few lines, "are you then-"</p> 
                  <p>"Never mind, now, sir. Read it, first."</p> 
                  <p>And so the merchant went on with the reading ing. At first, his face wore a puzzled look; but gradually the expression changed to one of rank astonishment, and ever and anon he would stop in his reading and go back, as though he feared he might not have read aright. When he had finished it, he folded the paper up and rested his hands upon his knees.</p> 
                  <p>"What think you?" asked the countess, nervously and anxiously.</p> 
                  <p>"It is very strange," returned the merchant, musingly.</p> 
                  <p>"I know it is strange-extremely so-but can you help me?"</p> 
                  <p>"I can, if any one can."</p> 
                  <p>"And will you help me?" she asked, earnestly.</p> 
                  <p>"Most surely, if I can. Nothing could give me greater joy. Shall I keep this?"</p> 
                  <p>"I should prefer to keep it, sir. I suppose you know all its contents?"</p> 
                  <p>Loman cast his eyes over the document once more, and then he handed it back to the rightful owner, saying as he did so:</p> 
                  <p>"God grant that I may help you in this. At any rate, you shall have the benefit of all my energies."</p> 
                  <p>"You will go at it at once?"</p> 
                  <p>"Immediately, madam."</p> 
                  <p>"You shall be nobly rewarded."</p> 
                  <p>"If you speak of such reward as the true man feels who does a Christian's duty, then I shall surely be rewarded; but if you mean more than that, then you do not know me."</p> 
                  <p>The countess at that moment felt more grateful than she could express in words. A doubt of the merchant's truth did not dwell in her mind, but she thought him the very soul of nobleness and virtue.</p> 
                  <p>Some further remarks were made relative to the business in hand, and then Loman said:</p> 
                  <p>"Since we have thus come together, I cannot leave you without asking you to partake of my hospitality. My doors are ever open to those who are my friends, either in wealth or in want. Tell me when you will come?"</p> 
                  <p>"At any time, sir; but on one condition-you shall be alone with your family. You shall have no gathering there."</p> 
                  <p>"That is an arrangement which would suit me best, madam."</p> 
                  <p>"Then I will come at any time."</p> 
                  <p>"Let it be to-morrow evening, then, and I will send my carriage."</p> 
                  <p>"I will come in my own, and then my coming will not attract attention."</p> 
                  <p>"You do not mean to mingle much in society, then?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not at present, for I do not feel like it. My voyage across the Atlantic has made me weak, and then I am not in a mood for much of empty pleasure. But I hope I may find beneath your roof something that may enliven and soothe my spirits."</p> 
                  <p>When John Loman left the hotel, he was supremely happy. He forgot for the while those little "notes payable" which presented such a formidable array in his ledger. He was on excellent terms with himself, and with all the world at that moment. But what his peculiar ideas were, we shall see by the conversation which followed on his reaching home. He went first to his counting-room, and found that three notes were to be paid that day, amounting in all to seven thousand dollars, and he had just four thousand on hand. He went into the street with a happy, confident face, and in less than ten minutes he had raised ten thousand dollars on the strength of "a rich widow."</p>

                  <head type="sub">PLOTTING.</head> 
                  <p>WHEN the merchant reached his house, he found Arabella in the drawing-room.</p> 
                  <p>"O, <emph>have</emph> you seen the countess?" was her first exclamation.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is Rosamond?" asked the father, without seeming to pay any attention to the question.</p> 
                  <p>"She's gone over to that old sick washerwoman's. But <emph>have</emph> you seen the countess?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, I have."</p> 
                  <p>"O-O-and what did she say? How did she look? What did she wear? Did she wear roses or jewels in her hair?"</p> 
                  <p>"She did not wear a flower nor a jewel of any kind. Her dress was of plain black satin, without ornament of any kind. Her hands were bare, and her neck and arms covered up. There-I think I've answered you well."</p> 
                  <p>"But you have not told me how she looked."</p> 
                  <p>"She is-is-very fair."</p> 
                  <p>"But they say she is beautiful!"</p> 
                  <p>"So she is."</p> 
                  <p>"And will she visit us?'</p> 
                  <p>"She will, if you obey my injunctions."</p> 
                  <p>"O, she will-she will! I'll obey anything-everything. She'll come here first-wont she? But what did she want? Why did she send for you? Why was it?"</p> 
                  <p>"Sit down here and listen," said the merchant, unable to repress a smile at his daughter's volubility. Arabella sat down, and then her father commenced:</p> 
                  <p>"Now, my child, I have seen the countess, and she is not only a splendid woman, but she is a noble-minded one. I have read her whole character just as though it was written on a scroll. Now if no accident occurs, I know that I can gain her for my wife."</p> 
                  <p>"You don't! O, my sakes! A countess-my mother! Can you marry her?"</p> 
                  <p>"If you can for once play your part as you ought. And, my child, I will tell you something now which may be an inducement for you to help me. I must either find a rich wife, or-sink! My finances are low. Business has taken a turn against me. But don't start! With the countess for my wife, I shall have the handling of some millions."</p> 
                  <p>"O, <emph>wont</emph> that be nice?"</p> 
                  <p>"Now are you prepared for calm, sober thought?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, I am."</p> 
                  <p>"Then first let me tell you that the way to the hand of the countess lies through her heart, and that must be won here. You know how widely different from you in nature and disposition Rosamond is. Now you must leave the countess mostly in Rosamond's company."</p> 
                  <p>"But-father-"</p> 
                  <p>"There are no <hi rend="i"/>buts, my child, about it. I know that Rosamond will win her to our house, and through Rosamond I must work-or, rather, <emph>we</emph> must work. Of course you will see her, and converse with her; but it is my wish that she should be left alone with Rosamond as much as possible. Do you not understand me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, I think I understand you; but let me tell you that I can be as good and pious as you please."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, Arabella, you don't know how difficult it would be to assume Rosamond's character. It is an easy thing for the wolf to put on the skin of a lamb, but a keen eye would detect the cheat. You must not attempt to assume a false character, for it will not suit you. Better by far remain silent. Promise me that you will do all in your power to appear modest and unassuming, and not speak much only when you are spoken to, and I can assure you that your purse shall be well filled, and that you shall have a real countess for a stepmother. Now what say you?"</p> 
                  <p>"I promise cheerfully."</p> 
                  <p>"Then the countess will be here to-morrow evening."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella could hardly contain herself at this announcement; but she gradually became calm, and before her father left her she had been pretty thoroughly drilled in the part she was to act.</p> 
                  <p>"And now what shall you say to Rosamond?" asked Arabella, after she had made a solemn promise for the tenth time.</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing."</p> 
                  <p>"But she must know how you wish her to behave."</p> 
                  <p>"I only wish for her to act herself, without restraint or advice of any kind, for I know there will a strong love spring up between them at once."</p> 
                  <p>Under any other circumstances, all this would have been most galling to the elder daughter's feelings; but as matters stood now, she bore it with cool philosophy, for she saw that she was to act an important part, and that her sister, even, with all her excellence, was only to be used as a sort of decoy.</p> 
                  <p>"Then you wont say anything to Rosa at all?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"No, not a word of this; for did she suspect, even, the game we are playing, she would fly off in a tangent at once."</p> 
                  <p>During the next day, Mr. Loman had Arabella under tutorship several times. To Rosamond he simply announced that the Countess of Errol would visit them in the evening. She was of course pleased with its announcement, and she showed her pleasure in her looks. But it is not to be wondered at that her curiosity should be excited.</p> 
                  <p>"Father," she asked, "why did she send for you?"</p> 
                  <p>"O yes," cried Arabella, "I entirely forgot that you didn't tell me that. Why was it?"</p> 
                  <p>For a few moments the father was silent. At first he thought of refusing peremptorily to tell them. Then the idea presented itself to tell them that it was a matter of mere private business. But in a moment more an excellent expedient came to his mind, and he seized upon it.</p> 
                  <p>"You remember Adam Wagner?" he said.</p> 
                  <p>"The old India merchant who sent Clara Wallace here, you mean?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>"O yes, I remember him."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, before the countess left England, she made his acquaintance, and she asked him to give her a letter of introduction to some one who would be a friend to her in case of need, and Wagner gave her a letter to me."</p> 
                  <p>"It was kind of him, wasn't it?" said Arabella. But Rosamond made no reply.</p> 
                  <p>In due time the countess came, and the two daughters were introduced. Loman watched Arabella with much anxiety, but she behaved herself remarkably well, and she had sense enough to take cue for conversation from the remarks of others.</p> 
                  <p>An hour passed away, during which time the conversation had been mostly in questions and explanations concerning the affairs of the country, the habits of the people, and such other matters as would naturally be interesting to a stranger. At the end of that time, however, the countess asked if either of the young ladies would sing. Rosamond asked Arabella; but the<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6097-00000006"/> latter preferred that her sister should sing, so without further remark, Rosamond took her seat at the piano.</p> 
                  <p>"I will sing you something which I have recently learned," she said, as she prepared to commence. "I know not how it may please you, but when I first heard it, I thought it the sweetest thing I ever listened to."</p> 
                  <p>Thus speaking, she commenced the same prelude which Henry Wallace once played upon the same instrument, and then she commenced to sing "Our Prayer." Her whole soul was given up to the inspiration of the theme, and she sang it with surpassing sweetness and power. She gave the true wall of the wayworn orphan girl, and then the noble cheer of the little brother; and then, when she came to the prayer which they both offer up to the departed spirit of their sainted mother, she almost outdid herself. Just as she closed, a low sob broke upon her ear, and upon turning, she found the countess weeping profusely, with her head bowed, and her face covered with her hands. With a quick movement, Rosamond glided to the woman's side and placed her arms about her neck, and then imprinted a warm kiss upon her brow.</p> 
                  <p>"Forgive me," she said. "O, I would not have sung that, had I known 'twould move you so."</p> 
                  <p>The arm of the widow was quickly about the fair form of the beautiful girl, and in a moment more their heads were pillowed upon each other's shoulders.</p> 
                  <p>The chord was touched, and Rosamond had won to her love one of the noblest of hearts. The merchant saw it, and a look of hope rested upon his features. Arabella looked on with much surprise, for she wondered how two sensible people could be so moved by such a simple thing.</p> 
                  <p>During the rest of the evening the countess kept Rosamond by her side, and the bright sparkle of her eyes told how fondly she already loved the gentle girl. At eleven o'clock, Lady Landowne arose to leave.</p> 
                  <p>"Rosamond-for so I must call you-I must see you often," she said, while she held the fair girl by the hand. "I am a stranger here, but I have friends already."</p> 
                  <p>"Ay," spoke the merchant, "you have friends, lady, and I hope you will not forget them. May we not see you erelong again? I would ask you to make it your home here, if I dared to hope you would accept the offer."</p> 
                  <p>"Not now-not now, sir. But I must visit you; and I ask only one favor-let me always find you alone, as I have done this evening."</p> 
                  <p>"That request I should grant from my own desire."</p> 
                  <p>"Of course I do not mean that I will not see company, sir; but for the present I do not feel like it, for when I go into society I must be prepared to stand up against curiosity and impertinent quizzing, and I am hardly prepared for that yet. You understand me, I trust?"</p> 
                  <p>"Perfectly, madam; and I appreciate your motives, too."</p> 
                  <p>After this, the merchant handed the countess into her carriage, and remained standing upon the step until the equipage had disappeared.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, Rosamond," he said to his child, when he returned to the drawing-room; "what do you think of the countess?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, I love her!"</p> 
                  <p>"What a splendid woman!" cried Arabella. "What hair and eyes! And did you notice her boots? Did you ever see anything like them before, Rosa?"</p> 
                  <p>"I didn't notice them," replied Rosamond.</p> 
                  <p>"Didn't notice them? Why, where were your eyes?"</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose I found enough in her face and conversation to engage my attention."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm sorry, for I wanted your opinion of those boots. O, they were perfect beauties! And then what feet-perfect loves of feet! Did you notice?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, I did not; but when she comes again, I will look at them for your sake."</p> 
                  <p>It was now near midnight, and as Arabella had been up for several nights in succession, she retired soon after the visitor had gone. Rosamond was about to follow her example, when her father called her back.</p> 
                  <p>"My child," he said, "I wish to speak to you a moment."</p> 
                  <p>The fair girl came back and took a seat, and then her father continued:</p> 
                  <p>"Rosamond, you must be aware that I am very lonesome, at times, and that the place which was once filled by a loving, faithful wife is now dark and desolate. Do you wonder that I should want a companion?"</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond hesitated for a while, for she had had much uneasiness on this very point. She knew several women who had shown palpable desires to wed with her father, and she knew that not one of them could ever gain her respect. At length she answered:</p> 
                  <p>"That you should want a companion, my father, is not strange-but will you find one who can be to you what my mother was?"</p> 
                  <p>"I think I can, my child. Suppose Matilda Landowne would become my wife?"</p> 
                  <p>The beautiful girl looked up in astonishment. But soon an expression more of anxiety took its place, and when she spoke, her words were very low and soft.</p> 
                  <p>"I am sure I should love her dearly; for I know she is a good woman."</p> 
                  <p>"I love her," resumed the merchant, "and I have reason to think that she may love me in return. I trust you will bear this in mind; and if you would see your father once more happy and contented, remember that Lady Landowne must be his wife. Yet I would not wed with her unless I can secure her love. You can think of this."</p> 
                  <p>When John Loman was left alone he commenced to pace the floor of his apartment with long, moderate steps. His face was not in the mould of one who deeply loves. There was more of deep scheming and doubt there, than of love. His tall, spare frame was slightly bent beneath the weight of the thought that was upon him, and his black eyes were fixed upon vacancy with an earnest gaze.</p> 
                  <p>"What's the difference?" he uttered to himself. "I shall love her as well as most people love, and I know that she will save me from utter ruin. How shall a man live, if he does not sometimes work around a difficulty? In such society as I find myself, duplicity and plotting are fashionable; and fashion is surely social law. I must have her, and-I will. And her money, too-for I need that more than I do the wife. But then I shall give her a good home, and she may be happy. Why shouldn't she be? She will never know all I have done."</p> 
                  <p>This soliloquy was spoken at intervals, and in a hesitating manner, for John Loman was plotting a wicked scheme.</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond went to her bed, but it was a long while before she went to sleep. Her mind was filled with various conflicting emotions. At first she hoped that her father might marry with the countess. Then she remembered how her own mother had suffered from harshness and neglect, and she hoped that such a noble woman as she believed Lady Landowne to be, might never have reason to complain of misery caused by her father. She knew well her parent's disposition. She knew how affable and agreeable, and even how good he could appear, when he chose; but she knew, too, how stern, and morose, and cruel he could be when at home. But she finally prayed that all might be well; and with this prayer on her lips, she slept.</p> 
               </div> 
               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE PROPOSAL.</head> 
                  <p>SOME weeks passed by, and the countess visited often at the dwelling of John Loman. It was easy to see that Rosamond was the attractive object-though the merchant had managed so well, that Lady Landowne smiled upon him, and even seemed happy in his presence. He was a man who had seen much of the world, and he knew how to hide those traits which had better be hidden, and how to assume those which would be most likely to further his plans. Thus he had ever presented to the countess a disposition kind and affectionate, and a soul pure and ennobled. He conversed with her on philanthropic subjects, quoting as his own opinions those which he had read in printed reports, and always exhibiting much feeling for the unfortunate and erring Nature had made him good-looking, with a proud, lofty bearing, and had Nature also given him the characteristics which he now assumed, he would have been just such a man as a noble, pure-minded woman could have loved and honored.</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond noticed this change in her father-for he knew that to insure a successful termination he must deceive her, too-and she was not so much surprised as she was gratified, for she hoped, at least, that love for Lady Landowne had made him thus. Her perceptions were quick, and she felt sure that the countess loved her father. She could read it in her looks, and hear it in her words; and now she hoped that the marriage might be consummated, for between the lady and herself there had grown up a love so strong and powerful, that the whole soul was enwrapped. Their natures were alike, and their sympathies, their tastes, and their hopes were congenial. Often when Rosamond was left alone at home, would she call a carriage and ride to the hotel and spend the evening; but not yet had the countess spent an evening alone with the girl beneath her own roof, for somehow or other the merchant had always contrived to prevent it.</p> 
                  <p>At the end of four weeks, Mr. Loman was sure that Matilda Landowne loved him. One day when the sun shone brightly, and when the flowers had begun to blossom on the hedges and in the gardens, the merchant asked Lady Landowne to ride with him out into the country and view the scenery. She accepted the proposal readily-though she was much disappointed when she found that Rosamond was not going. They rode to one of the beautiful suburban resorts to take dinner, and after the meal was finished, they walked out into one of the wide gardens. In an arbor of grape-vines and honeysuckle the merchant sat down, and drew the countess to his side. There was a dead silence for some moments, broken only by the rustling of the leaves and the singing of the birds. The countess trembled, for she seemed to suspect her companion's meaning. At length Mr. Loman spoke:</p> 
                  <p>"Lady," he said, taking one of her hands and gazing tenderly into her face, "you must ere this have seen the emotions which your presence has called up in my soul. When I first saw you, I was a lonely, mourning man, and my heart was drear and desolate. Many a woman in our city had tried to gain the place which my sainted wife had left vacant, but my heart refused them all. I saw you, and I loved. I have seen you often, and I now know you are worthy the love of the most noble. I have probed my feelings deeply and carefully, and I know that you are necessary to my happiness. Can you love me well enough to be my wife?"</p> 
                  <p>The lady bowed her head, and for a while the color left her cheeks. She did not withdraw the hand which her companion held, nor did she shrink from him.</p> 
                  <p>"Your mind must ere this have dwelt upon the subject," resumed Mr. Loman, "and I hope you have thought sufficiently to give me an answer. I would have you speak from the promptings of your heart, for such love as mine cannot live in neglect. I would not have you answer yes, unless you can love me," he added.</p> 
                  <p>"I have loved you, sir," said the lady, lowly and tumultuously.</p> 
                  <p>"Bless thee, lady, for that. Then you will be mine?"</p> 
                  <p>At length the countess seemed to have regained her wonted composure, and looking up into her companion's face, she replied:</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot deny, sir, that I have thought of this matter, and I will also tell you freely that my mind was partly made up even before you confessed your love, and now I will tell you all. You know the business you have promised to do for me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, and I have already set measures on foot for its accomplishment."</p> 
                  <p>"Let that be done before I give you my answer. I hope you will see the propriety of this."</p> 
                  <p>"But, lady, suppose it were never done? O, do not keep me in such suspense as that!"</p> 
                  <p>The countess bowed her head and remained for some time in deep thought. She believed the man by her side to be a noble, pure-minded person, and as such she had already begun to love him. And then she remembered Rosamond, and she knew she should be happy in the companionship of that sweet girl.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Loman," she said, at length, "let this subject rest for six mouths, and at the end of that time you shall have my answer. If your mission in my behalf is accomplished before that time, my answer shall not be so long delayed; but I will not ask you to wait longer, even should you fall in working out my hopes."</p> 
                  <p>The merchant pleaded long and earnestly against any such delay, but the lady was firm.</p> 
                  <p>"But," said he, after he found that he could not move from her purpose, "how much hope may I entertain of possessing you even at that time?"</p> 
                  <p>"You should not fear much on that score," she replied, "for had I any doubts now, I should not answer you so. Did I hold even one palpable doubt, I should refuse your answer at once-at least for the present."</p> 
                  <p>When John Loman rode back to the city, he felt happy, and yet he felt disappointed. He felt sure that the countess would be his wife, and at the end of six months he should have the handling of money enough to raise him forever above want and care. But he needed some of that money now, and he had founded many hopes upon its possession. However, he believed that he could weather the gale until autumn. He could find some friend to whom he might entrust his secret, and thus obtain a loan on the strength of the fortune of the countess.</p> 
                  <p>It was already dusk when the merchant reached the city, and at his companion's request, he conveyed her at once to her hotel. After this he returned to his own dwelling, where he found Rosamond and Clara sitting together in the drawing room, Arabella having gone out. A dark cloud rested upon his brow as he saw the orphan girl sitting there, and in a peremptory tone he bade her leave the room.</p> 
                  <p>"Rosamond," he said, "why was that girl in here?"</p> 
                  <p>"She came, at my own request, to keep me company," replied the noble girl, showing by her look and tone that she was pained by the manner in which her father had spoken.</p> 
                  <p>"And can you not find better company than that of your waiting-maid?" the merchant asked, sternly.</p> 
                  <p>"Not that I know of. Clara Wallace is a noble, virtuous, intelligent girl, and I have derived more profit and pleasure from her companionship, than could have been found among the very best of ten thousand such girls as fill our saloons and drawing-rooms night after night, in empty amusement. I love her, sir, and she is worthy of it."</p> 
                  <p>The parent gazed upon his child some time in silence, and during the while there was some anger upon his face, but more of doubt and perplexity. At length he said, while an expression of iron sternness settled upon his countenance:</p> 
                  <p>"I trust you will not let me see this again."</p> 
                  <p>"My father," instantly returned the maiden, speaking only as her heart dictated, "I trust that you will not forbid my sitting with Clara when I wish it. Do not let anything come into our home now, to mar our peace and harmony."</p> 
                  <p>"Ha, what means that? Do you threaten me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not at all. I only speak what I feel to be necessary. Where will be my joy and peace, if you take from me one of the purest sources of joy which I have possessed for the past year? By Clara's assistance, I have improved in music and in understanding, and I cannot now give up her companion-hip."</p> 
                  <p>"But is not the countess companionship enough?"</p> 
                  <p>"She is when she is here."</p> 
                  <p>"And what would she think were she to find you in such company, my child?" asked the parent, growing more calm.</p> 
                  <p>"If you think she would see anything out of the way in it, father, you do not yet know her," replied Rosamond, promptly.</p> 
                  <p>"I should not wish for you to try the experiment, at any rate, and let me assure you that if I ever know of Lady Landowne's finding you with your maid, I will send her-Clara Wallace-out of my house at once. Remember this."</p> 
                  <p>"But you do not forbid me from associating as I have done?"</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Loman did not reply at once. He feared to make Rosamond unhappy now. Under other circumstances, he would have set down his will without regard to anything but his own harsh purpose; but now he dared not. He knew if he offended Rosamond deeply, she would show it for a long while; and the countess would surely notice it, and in all probability find out its cause. And that he had no desire to have done; so he answered his child quite calmly:</p> 
                  <p>"I care not what you do when alone, but the countess must not see it, nor must any other of my visiting friends. Will you promise me this?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir-readily."</p> 
                  <p>"Then let it pass. Where has Arabella gone?"</p> 
                  <p>"To Mrs. Delacour's."</p> 
                  <p>"Why, this is the night of the party, and I had forgotten it. The countess and I were both to have been there. Why did you not go?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because I did not feel like it. You know I never go to such places when I can help it."</p> 
                  <p>"Very well. I will off and see Lady Landowne, and if she will not go, I'll go alone. Did Arabella take the carriage?"</p> 
                  <p>"She did."</p> 
                  <p>"Then I'll call another."</p> 
                  <p>Thus speaking, Mr. Loman left the apartment, and Rosamond was alone.</p> 
               </div> 
               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">A REASONABLE SUPPOSITION RESULTS IN AN ADVERTISEMENT.</head> 
                  <p>FOR nearly half an hour Rosamond remained in the drawing-room where her father had left her, and she had something new to think of. She saw now that her parent was not much changed for the better-though she hoped that this might be only an ebullition from some momentary impulse. For herself she cared not so much as for another. The fear came to her that Lady Landowne was being deceived, and for the first time the thought presented itself that she had had some influence in binding that lady to her father. She felt sure that the marriage would take place, and she imagined that the contract was already made to that effect. Now would this have been done, had it not been for herself? Had she not been the means of bringing the countess to the house? But as she pondered more calmly upon it, she felt that no blame could attach to her, though she could have wished that her father would appear to the lady in his true character.</p> 
                  <p>At length she arose and went out into the little sitting-room where her maid usually sat, and there she found Clara and her brother. Henry Wallace arose as the fair young hostess entered; but before he could speak, she smilingly approached him and offered him her hand.</p> 
                  <p>"This is a pleasure I had not anticipated," she said, as she took a seat. "I am left alone by the rest of the folks."</p> 
                  <p>Is it a wonder that the youth's heart should beat more quickly, or that the rich blood should mount to his face? That beaming smile went to his heart at once, and was treasured there with the face that bore it. Clara soon forgot the harshness of the father in the kindness of the daughter, and erelong the conversation became free and interesting. Henry was perfectly free, now, and it was not long before Clara's quick eye discovered that Rosamond was more than usually interested in everything he said. She saw her young mistress's eye sparkle with an unwonted lustre as she gazed upon Henry, and she saw, too, how her face glowed when she would meet the youth's full look.</p> 
                  <p>A strange truth flashed upon Clara's mind. She gazed awhile longer upon the couple before her-she allowed them to monopolize the conversation for a time, and she felt sure that Rosamond loved her brother. Had the noblest monarch of earth at that moment confessed his love to her, she could not have been more proud than she was to know that her noble brother was beloved by one who was so well worthy of him. She knew that she was not mistaken. She watched them until she could fairly see the rich, warm love-light dancing in their eyes, and then she rejoined them in conversation.</p> 
                  <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6097-00000007"/> 
                  <p>By-and-by Rosamond took a magazine from the table. The conversation had turned upon paintings, and she remembered to have seen a copy of one of Raphael's pieces in one of the magazines. She looked over four magazines before she found it; but she came to it at length, and then went and sat down by Henry's side. They viewed the picture together, and again Clara watched them. She saw her brother's tremulous joy, and Rosamond's eager wistfulness. She noticed how deep were the latter's eyes when the youth spoke, and how she trembled when her head once touched Henry's shoulder. If that was not mutual love, then there never was such.</p> 
                  <p>Thus had the time passed away for an hour and a half, when the door-bell was rung. One of the servants answered the summons, and while Rosamond was waiting to learn what could be the occasion of the ring, the door of the little room was opened. The young hostess turned, expecting to see the face of a servant, but instead thereof, she saw the sweet face of Lady Landowne.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, excuse me," spoke the countess. "I did not know that you had company, or I should not have been so forward. I asked the servant to tell me where you were, and I would not disturb you. But as it is, if-"</p> 
                  <p>"No excuses, lady, I beseech of you," interrupted Rosamond. And as she spoke, she moved out a chair.</p> 
                  <p>Clara arose to leave, and at the same time motioned for her brother to follow her example; but he did not heed her. He had become too deeply absorbed in the face of the new comer. He started when he first beheld those fair features, and in spite of all the rules to the contrary, he gazed fixedly upon her for several moments.</p> 
                  <p>"Lady Landowne-"</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Mrs.</emph> Landowne, if you please, Rosamond," said the countess, with a smile. "Don't make a curiosity-a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">rara avis</foreign>-of me. Forget, I implore you, that I was ever anything more than plain mistress."</p> 
                  <p>"Then, <emph>Mrs.</emph> Landowne," said Rosamond, gleefully, "let me introduce two worthy friends of mine. Mr. and Miss Wallace-poor in gold, but rich in all that makes real worth."</p> 
                  <p>"A luxury I would oftener enjoy," returned the lady, earnestly, at the same time extending her hand to Henry. Then she greeted Clara, and again resumed her seat.</p> 
                  <p>"Did my father call upon you this evening?" asked Rosamond.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, he came, and wished me to accompany him to Mrs. Delacour's, I believe. But I did not feel like going, and he went alone. Somehow I felt lonesome, and at length the dark cloud came over me so completely, that I was forced to break away from it; so I called a carriage, and here I am. And here, with you, I knew I should find joy."</p> 
                  <p>At this moment the eyes of the countess rested upon the face of Henry Wallace. He was gazing fixedly upon her, and she started with a quick, energetic movement. The color faded for a moment from her cheeks, and soon the blood rushed back freely.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Wallace," she said, in a forced tone, "have we not met before?"</p> 
                  <p>It was some moments before the youth could speak, but he soon regained his composure, and then he answered:</p> 
                  <p>"I do not know that we have."</p> 
                  <p>"But you gazed upon me as though you knew me!"</p> 
                  <p>"I may have thought your countenance familiar, but I think we have never met before."</p> 
                  <p>The countess seemed satisfied with this for awhile, but she kept her eyes fixed upon the youth and her face showed that she was troubled.</p> 
                  <p>Henry had found the original of the miniature in the seal! He was sure of it-he knew it. The lineaments within that tiny locket were all fixed upon his mind, and in the face before him he saw them all. No wonder he felt puzzled and nervous. The circumstances under which the seal came into his possession were strange, but this part of the business was more strange yet. Why should the murderer have had that seal, with the miniature of the countess in it?</p> 
                  <p>But Lady Landowne's gaze was not confined to Henry. Soon she transferred it to Clara, and again the color left her cheeks. Rosamond noticed it, and she was not a little puzzled.</p> 
                  <p>"What is it all?" she asked, looking first upon one and then upon the other of the party.</p> 
                  <p>"Really," returned the countess, in a tremulous tone, "I cannot explain it." Then turning to Clara, she said:</p> 
                  <p>"Have I not met you before?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not that I know of," the young girl replied, showing in her countenance signs of deep emotion.</p> 
                  <p>"And yet you seem to recognize me?" the lady added.</p> 
                  <p>Clara made no reply, but a bright tear-drop glistened in her eye as she gazed upon the woman, and her bosom heaved with an emotion she could not repress.</p> 
                  <p>At this moment the door-bell was rung again, and shortly after, the voice of Mr. Loman was heard in the hall.</p> 
                  <p>"Lady Landowne," said Rosamond, with a sudden start, "we must join my father. Clara-Mr. Wallace-you will excuse us."</p> 
                  <p>"But why so sudden?" asked the countess.</p> 
                  <p>"I will tell you at some time," answered Rosamond, nervously.</p> 
                  <p>The lady cast a quick glance into the handsome face of Henry, and she thought she had discovered the secret; so without further remonstrance she bade the brother and sister good evening, hoping she should see them again, and then followed Rosamond from the place.</p> 
                  <p>"You will not mention anything of this to my father?" whispered the fair girl, as they reached the entry-way.</p> 
                  <p>The moment these words had passed her lips, Rosamond would have given worlds could she have recalled them. She saw by her companion's look that she was surprised.</p> 
                  <p>"I understand you," returned Mrs. Landowne, with a meaning look.</p> 
                  <p>"No, no," quickly cried Rosamond; "you do not understand me. I ought not to have spoken so. It is nothing between my father and myself that I fear. I would not do a thing that he might not know."</p> 
                  <p>"Then what is it?" asked the lady, stopping and placing her hand upon her companion's arm. "What is it?" she repeated. "I have a right to know."</p> 
                  <p>"I feared my father would not like it," replied Rosamond, with some hesitation.</p> 
                  <p>"The presence of the youth, you mean?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, my being found-"</p> 
                  <p>"Do you doubt me?"</p> 
                  <p>The countess asked this last question with so much feeling, and then she gave such a look of deep, imploring supplication, that Rosamond could not resist the appeal.</p> 
                  <p>"I will trust you," she said, in a low, but frank tone. "My father forbade me from ever allowing any of our visitors to find me in company with my maid."</p> 
                  <p>"And he spoke of me in particular, eh?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have told you enough."</p> 
                  <p>"So you have, and I thank you. Your father does not know me."</p> 
                  <p>After this they kept on to the drawing-room, and here they found Mr. Loman and Arabella.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, truant!" laughingly uttered the merchant, as he saw the countess. "You escaped me fairly."</p> 
                  <p>"You must excuse me," returned the lady; "but after you were gone, I felt so lonesome, that I had to come here and see Rosa. Is it not near eleven?"</p> 
                  <p>"Just eleven."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, yes-and here is my carriage."</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Loman would have urged Lady Landowne to remain longer, but she was anxious to return, and he waited upon her to her carriage.</p> 
                  <p>When Henry and Clara were left alone, they conversed some time upon the countess.</p> 
                  <p>"It is very strange," said. Henry, "very strange; and the more I think of it, the more I am puzzled. Have you any idea of the object of her visit to this country?"</p> 
                  <p>"Only that she has some kind of business here," returned Clara. "Rosamond told me all she knew about it, and I heard a few days ago something from the lips of Mr. Loman himself; but he does not know that I heard it, as he only meant it for the ear of a strange man who was conversing with him. She has come over here on some important business, and Mr. Wagner recommended her to Loman."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you mean <emph>our</emph> Mr. Wagner?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. She became acquainted with him in London, and he sent her to Mr. Loman."</p> 
                  <p>"But this business, Clara-do you know what it is?"</p> 
                  <p>"Only that it is about finding somebody whom she wishes to go back with her. I heard the words '<hi rend="i"/>reckless' and '<hi rend="i"/>dissipated,' and I think they had allusion to this subject."</p> 
                  <p>Henry started, and after gazing at his sister a few moments in the face, he bowed his head upon his hands. At length he looked up, and while a strange light danced in his eyes, he said:</p> 
                  <p>"Clara, I have a key to this. Here, look at this."</p> 
                  <p>As he spoke, he drew a small paper parcel from his breast pocket, and having undone it, He took out the seal and opened the cornelian, and then handed it to his sister. The moment she cast her eyes upon the miniature, she said:</p> 
                  <p>"Why-this is she! It is the countess!"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly it is."</p> 
                  <p>"But how did you get it?"</p> 
                  <p>"You must keep it to yourself."</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly-if you wish it."</p> 
                  <p>"I do wish it, as you shall hear."</p> 
                  <p>And thereupon Henry went on and told his sister all the circumstances attending his finding the locket and seal. Clara was all astonishment when the story was told.</p> 
                  <p>"And now," said her brother, "I think I have a part of her secret. This man, from whom I took the seal, wore a mask, and was surely a white man. He was tall and straight, and was dressed fashionably. He had been to a gaming saloon, and lost all his money; and probably the man whom he murdered-who was known to be a noted gambler-was the one who had won it. Now it appears to me that this assassin is some relation of hers-perhaps a brother-it may be a son."</p> 
                  <p>"But she is too young to have so old a son," suggested Clara.</p> 
                  <p>"O no! She may be forty, and you know they marry very young among the nobility in England."</p> 
                  <p>"She is forty. Rosamond told me so."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Then this may be her son. It must be," uttered Henry, with much confidence; "for do you not see that the seal bears the escutcheon of the earldom? And surely none but the son or heir would wear that for a signet! Let me assure you that this is her son, and that some wild, mad freak made it necessary for him to leave his country, and also that she has now come over to reclaim him."</p> 
                  <p>"It does seem probable, certainly," Clara responded.</p> 
                  <p>"Of course it does."</p> 
                  <p>"And what will you do with the seal?"</p> 
                  <p>"I hardly know. I do not wish to show it to the countess, for then I would have to tell her how I came by it, and I would not so hurt her feelings for anything; for she is a sweet woman-a noble woman."</p> 
                  <p>"So she is, Henry. Rosamond says she is just as good as she looks-all goodness, kindness and love."</p> 
                  <p>"She shows it in her very face," returned Henry, enthusiastically. "But she must wish to see her son, and the sooner she does so, the better it will be for him. I have a mind to put an advertisement in some of the dally papers. I could simply say that a gold watch-seal had been found, containing a painted miniature, and that further information could be had by calling at such a place-or something of that kind. Then, you know, I could approach him gently-that is, if he came; and finally inform him that his mother was here after him."</p> 
                  <p>Clara approved of the plan very highly, and when Henry left his sister, he made up his mind that he should try the advertisement. He took it for granted that he was right in his supposition, or nearly so. After he had reached his boarding house, he pondered upon the subject-and after he had retired, he pondered upon it; and on the next morning he sat down and wrote the following advertisement:</p> 
                  <p>"FOUND.-A fine gold watch-seal, containing a beautifully executed miniature on ivory. The owner can have the same by calling at No. 17 Beckwith Court, proving property, and paying for this advertisement."</p> 
                  <p>Henry put in the last clause so as to give it more the air of a mere casual affair-fearing that if he appeared anxious to find the owner, some suspicions might be entertained by that individual that his body was the thing wanted. This advertisement he copied twice, and on his way to the office, he stopped at the counting-rooms of two evening and morning papers, and left a copy at each for insertion in the next edition. After he had done this, he asked himself if he had acted wisely.</p> 
                  <p>"It can't do any harm, at any rate," he said, in reply to his mental inquiry; and with this, he seemed satisfied.</p> 
                  <p>When he reached his employer's office, he found Mr. Beckwith already there, and on the desk he saw an account for an execution against John Loman; but as the old lawyer was busy with a stranger, he made no remark-only looking at the account a second time, and finding it to amount to eight thousand dollars. Surely, the storm was gathering over the merchant's head!</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">NOT QUITE.</head> 
                  <p>A FEW evenings after the events last recorded, Henry Wallace called to see his sister again, and again he found himself in-the society of Rosamond. This time he found that he did really love the beautiful girl, and he knew that he should be unhappy if he could not possess her for his own. It appeared to him that he could never be happy more, if the object of his new and deep affection were taken from him. And he thought he had discovered more than this-he felt sure that Rosamond loved him. He was not blinded by his love, nor made frantic; but with a comparatively calm judgment he watched all her speech, looks and movements, and he saw something in them more than mere friendship.</p> 
                  <p>So when the youth left the merchant's princely dwelling, he allowed himself to feel very happy-though of course his happiness had not that depth which perfect assurance gives. He forgot the proud father, and had he given much thought to that individual, he might not have regarded him as one who had the right to make his lovely child miserable or unhappy from mere whim of pride. In fact, he knew enough of John Loman not to respect him much; and as for that gentleman's wealth, he knew that he himself, humble as he was, stood fairer in property. He had but little, but he owed no man anything; whereas, he knew that the proud merchant had not wherewith to justly pay his debts.</p> 
                  <p>One evening, just after dark, and while Henry was lighting the large lamp that hung over his desk, a stranger entered the office. It was a middle-aged man, well-dressed, and wearing a weed on his hat. He was not a bad-looking man, nor was he good-looking, for a single glance at his face was sufficient to show that he was not free from dissipation. The new-comer glanced carefully about the office, and when he found that the clerk was alone, he approached the desk. As he came nearer to the light, Henry could see that his face wore a flushed look, though not one of fear. He wore considerable jewelry-rather more than would have suited the taste of a modest man.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you have charge here?" the stranger asked, looking carefully into Henry's face.</p> 
                  <p>"At present I do, sir," replied our young friend.</p> 
                  <p>"I noticed an advertisement in the Herald, yesterday. Do you know anything about it?"</p> 
                  <p>"To what advertisement do you allude?"</p> 
                  <p>"Concerning a watch-seal."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir; I put it in myself."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, did you? Hem-em! You're just the man, then. I did not see the advertisement until last evening, and even then I was a hundred miles from here. I've been away from the city during the past week; but last evening a friend put the paper in my hand, and I saw your notice. I suppose the seal is mine. It is not of great value-a hundred dollars or so, perhaps-but it is a sort of keepsake-a souvenir-from a dear friend, and hence I prize it highly."</p> 
                  <p>"When did you lose your seal?" asked Henry, with perfect coolness. He had attended Mr. Beckwith at court so much, that he had already learned the lawyer's art of asking questions without betraying any interest in their result.</p> 
                  <p>The stranger bowed his head and hesitated. At length he looked up, and said:</p> 
                  <p>"I don't exactly remember when it was, but it must have been about three or four weeks ago. In fact I did not notice my lose at the precise time, and it may have been a week, more or less. I had just received my watch from the hands of a jeweller who had been cleaning it, and when I first discovered my loss, I supposed he had retained it through mistake."</p> 
                  <p>"And what kind of a seal was yours?" Henry asked.</p> 
                  <p>"A gold seal, a lion lying at rest, or crouching, on a richly-chased plate. The under side of this plate held a rich cornelian."</p> 
                  <p>"Of what color?"</p> 
                  <p>"Blood red."</p> 
                  <p>"Anything further?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. The cornelian formed the cover of a locket within which was the miniature of a female."</p> 
                  <p>"And <emph>you</emph> lost just such a seal?" said Henry, looking the man sharply in the eye.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir," he replied, with a slight hesitation. "'Tisn't likely I should have described it as I have, if I had not lost it."</p> 
                  <p>"O, as for that," returned Henry, with a smile, "I could describe it mere accurately than you have done, and yet I did not lose it. But you will pardon me for being particular, especially as you are a perfect stranger to me."</p> 
                  <p>"Of course," said the applicant, trying to hide his vexation.</p> 
                  <p>"Then you must allow me to ask you one more question. I found the seal in Shelbert Alley, on the evening of the seventeenth of last month. Were you there at that time?"</p> 
                  <p>Again the fellow hesitated. This time he was much disconcerted, and though he contrived to hide his face, yet Henry could see how troubled he was. At length, however, a sudden gleam of light shot across his face, and with much confidence, he said:</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, yes-I remember. That was the night there was a murder committed there. I was on the spot-I went with some of the officers who were called. Yes, yes, now I see it. I went there, and was there some time-great crowd, too. Ten chances to one that some rascal didn't try to steal it. Yes, yes, the seal must be mine."</p> 
                  <p>Henry felt sure that this was not the man from whom he took the seal. The assassin of that dark night was a much taller man than this, and was not so stout in frame. In fact he knew that the man before him was not the individual-yet might he not have lost the seal? Might not the villain have robbed him of it on that same night? But wait-</p> 
                  <p>"You think you had your seal with you when you visited the scene of the murder, do you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir."</p> 
                  <p>"You are confident on this point?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, for now I remember of dangling it in my hand as I walked along with the officers."</p> 
                  <p>"And how about the jeweller's having your watch?"</p> 
                  <p>"O' ah-a-I carried it to him on the very next morning, and must have forgotten all about the seal."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir," said Henry, leaning back and regarding his visitor with cool deliberation. "I understand, now; and the seal which I have found is not yours."</p> 
                  <p>"Not mine?" uttered the stranger, starting.</p> 
                  <p>"But it must be. There is not another seal in the country like it. I defy you to produce it. It must be mine."</p> 
                  <p>"But it cannot be," persisted Henry. "I found this seal within two minutes after the murder had been committed. So you see you could not have lost it."</p> 
                  <p>The fellow turned pale and red by turns, but Henry saw his difficulty, and he believed he knew its cause, and with a keen, searching look into the visitor's face, he said:</p> 
                  <p>"You are not the man who lost this seal, and had you told me the truth when you first came in, you would have saved much useless conversation."</p> 
                  <p>"Told you the truth, sir?" uttered the fellow, trying to look daggers, but unable to hold out beneath the searching gaze of the law-student.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir," Henry calmly replied; "had you told me in the first place that you were deputized<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6097-00000008"/> tized by the real loser to come and obtain his property, we might have gone on understandingly. Do you comprehend me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Me deputized? What do you mean?" But the fellow did not speak as one greatly surprised at the Insinuation.</p> 
                  <p>"O, there is no need of using further deception," spoke the youth, quite blandly. "I understand the matter, and can put you on the right track easily. Now shall you see the man who did really lose this seal?"</p> 
                  <p>The man was silent.</p> 
                  <p>"You may trust me, sir. I am not one to break my faith; and I do here most solemnly assure you that no harm shall come to the former possessor of the seal through my means, either directly or indirectly. Now shall you see the man again?"</p> 
                  <p>"Well, you seem to take things for granted at your own liking," said the stranger, without any show of anger.</p> 
                  <p>"Only when the proof is plain," resumed Henry, with another smile. "But I think we understand each other, now. A man who feared to come here himself sent you in his stead, and furnished you with a description of the lost article. I see it, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"By the great apostle, my dear sir, you're young, but I think if I wanted a long-headed lawyer, I'd have you in preference to anybody else."</p> 
                  <p>Henry smiled once more, and considering this the same as a confession, he said:</p> 
                  <p>"Now go to the man who lost this seal and tell him that I would see him. Tell him that if I had the perfect assurance that he had committed all the crimes in the criminal calendar, I would not molest him, nor in any way make his visit to me have any bearing against him. But when I put that advertisement into the papers, I wished to see the man himself, and I have most strong reasons for wishing still to see him. And, furthermore, my wish is entirely for his benefit. I hope to do him a lasting good. If he will come here, he shall have his seal, and also some information he would like. Tell him that I shall be here in my office to-morrow night-say anywhere from eight to nine o'clock; I will be here alone, and he may find me ready to help him to any good that lies in my power. He may come and go without fear. Will you tell him this?"</p> 
                  <p>The man was in a quandary; but his very manner showed that he could not deny the truth of the youth's position. After a short time he muttered, in tones hardly audible:</p> 
                  <p>"Well, you needn't make yourself very sure on this point; but howsumever, you may enjoy your opinion."</p> 
                  <p>He turned towards the door, but before he reached it he turned and added:</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps you'd better be here, though, tomorrow night, for I may want to come again myself."</p> 
                  <p>"I shall be here," returned Henry; and with this the visitor left.</p> 
                  <p>For some time after the visitor had gone there was a smile upon the youth's face; but gradually it faded away, and a look of deep concern took its place. He arose and looked at the clock, and found it almost nine. He had prepared his books for copying some court reports; but when he found how late it was he closed them, and then took a few turns up and down the office.</p> 
                  <p>"Suppose I should be the means of returning this prodigal son to his mother?" he said to himself. "I should at least deserve her gratitude-and then I might save him. That would be a happy thing, and I should be as happy as the happiest. I will do it if I can. I hope he will come."</p> 
                  <p>Erelong after this Henry Wallace closed the office and started for home; and from that time until he slept, his mind was full of the project of returning a lost son to his widowed mother.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">A CONQUEST.</head> 
                  <p>"O, DID you ever see so handsome a man before? Such whiskers, and such a mustache-and such hair, and such a form! O, what a perfect love of a man!"</p> 
                  <p>"But who is this Adonis, Arabella?" asked Rosamond, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Alberto Lacompte. Lacompte, in French, I am sure means '<hi rend="i"/>the count.' He is a Frenchman, and I know he is a count. O, he was very attentive to me! And just think, Ross, father will marry a countess, and I a count. Only think! O, I know he loves me!"</p> 
                  <p>"But where have you seen him?" Rosamond asked, rather seriously.</p> 
                  <p>"At Mrs. Bradshaw's last evening. And he was <emph>so</emph> attentive! Why, he danced with me almost every dance. And <emph>such</emph> a dancer! O, you never! Precilla Barnes wanted to be introduced to him, and <emph>I</emph> introduced her. He just said 'good-evening,' and then don't you think he asked me if I wouldn't go and have a promenade in the other room."</p> 
                  <p>"Then he is not very polite."</p> 
                  <p>"Why, there was never a man so polite."</p> 
                  <p>"Not to Precilla Barnes, I think."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah," uttered Arabella, "you must remember that he had a powerful magnet to draw him away. Miss Barnes is not a handsome person."</p> 
                  <p>And as Arabella thus spoke she cast her eyes towards an opposite mirror. It was in the morning-or what she called morning-and her paint was off; but still she seemed quite assured of the power of the face which she saw reflected in the polished glass.</p> 
                  <p>"I should really like to see the individual," said Rosamond.</p> 
                  <p>"You will have a chance this evening, sis mine, for we invited him to call, and he said he should be happy to."</p> 
                  <p>"Does father know him?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes; and he likes him, too. He was the first to propose the visit to him; but Mr. Lacompte said he guessed not quite yet. He wanted to learn a little more of the fashions of our country, before he visited much. But when I added <emph>my</emph> request, he melted in a moment. I smiled, and he was conquered. O, you don't know what a perfect beauty he is-and a count, too!"</p> 
                  <p>"But you are not sure that he is a count?"</p> 
                  <p>"Of course I am sure. He told me as much, himself. But he is so modest, he don't tell all his affairs right out."</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond left the room smiling, for she knew her sister's weakness, and she believed that this was to be another of her bootless conquests. But the evening came, and with it came Mr. Alberto Lacompte. Arabella was in ecstasies, and soon ran for Rosamond to come and be introduced. The younger sister came, and she shook hands with Mr. Lacompte; but she was not astonished-she was rather disgusted.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Alberto Lacompte was not over four or five-and-twenty, quite tall and slim, and dressed in the very extreme of the extremest fashion. His hair was black and curly, and was really beautiful; but his face was an intellectual blank-though there was enough of shrewdness and cunning there to make a little character. His brow was quite high, but narrow and receding-though the jetty curls which clustered above it gave it a look more full. He was, in truth, just such a man as a shallow-minded girl would admire.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Loman was very polite and affable, and Mr. Lacompte soon made himself at home.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah," he uttered, with a very long sigh, "this countree not like mine own nateve Frawnce. No such sweet landscape here-no such lovely flowers and gardens. But," and he looked graciously towards Arabella, "your beauty lies in your women, blest women. O, what divinities you have!"</p> 
                  <p>Arabella blushed, hung down her head, and then tapped Mr. Lacompte on his cheek with her fan, and called him a "naughty man."</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Pardong</emph>, ma'moiselle," he lisped. "But you must allow me to utter the truth. Ah, it is refreshing to see beauty in female."</p> 
                  <p>"And yet," said Mr. Loman, "we have some very beautiful scenery here."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, certainly, you must have. But you should visit me own nateve Frawnce. Excuse me if I speak of meself-but me chateau upon the Seine-only a short drive from <emph>Paree</emph>."</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Paree?</emph>" uttered Arabella, interrogatively.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, ma'moiselle-<emph>Paree</emph>. Ah, I <emph>comprang</emph>-you call it Paris. Ha, ha! you Yankees 'ave ver' funny pronunshashong. But me chateau on the Seine, with its parks and fountains, and its beautiful turrets and towers. Ah, I weep when I leave me own Frawnce. But it do me no good. They think me dangerous. I was for the Bourbons-the Bourbons are connected with me own house-and we noblemen who think so much leave, you know. But I shall return. The Republeeke no stand without my house. O, I weep most bitter tears when I take de farewell of me own Frawnce."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella's eyes fairly grew moist beneath the power of this pathos, while about the eyes of Rosamond lurked a half-bitter smile. Mr. Loman seemed to treat the subject some as he would have done the sickness of a pet dog or cat.</p> 
                  <p>At this juncture the large centre lamp began to smoke, and the merchant asked Rosamond to touch the upper bell-cord. In a few moments more Clara Wallace entered, and Loman directed her to fix the lamp. She saw the strange gentleman, and she saw, too, that his gaze was fastened upon her with an impertinent stare. The rich blood mounted to her face, and for some seconds she hesitated about obeying the order. It was not her province to attend to the lamps, and never yet had she done it-save sometimes when, unasked, she had waited upon Rosamond. She believed that her master had merely called her in to humiliate her. The lower bell was the one always rung for such work.</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond saw Clara's hesitation, and in an instant she guessed the cause.</p> 
                  <p>"Here, let me pull it down for you," spoke the generous girl; and thus saying, she arose and tried to reach the bottom of the lamp, but could not. Of course it was also too high for Clara.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pardonee moi</foreign>," uttered Mr. Alberto Lacompte, hastily moving to the centre of the room and taking hold of the lamp. "De ladee no reach him-ha, ha, ha!" And he pulled the lamp down, and then resumed his seat.</p> 
                  <p>After this Clara fixed the lamp, and having raised it as high as she could, she turned one searching glance upon the fop, and then left the room.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Upon me soul," spoke Alberto, as soon as the door was closed upon the retiring maiden, "you have maids here almost as beautiful as the ladees themselves."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella smiled, and Rosamond frowned; while Alberto himself smoothed down his mustache.</p> 
                  <p>The conversation now turned upon general topics, but Lacompte could only iterate his eulogiums upon his "own nateve Frawnce." Erelong the door-bell was rung, and shortly afterwards a servant handed a sealed note to Mr. Loman. He read it, and changed color. It was simply a missive to inform him that a strike was likely to be made by some of his creditors. He arose at once, and without a word of excuse, left the room. In the hall he found a notary, whom he conducted to his library, where he closed the door-a lamp having been left burning there by himself some time before.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, Mr. Reed," said the merchant, nervously, "what means this?"</p> 
                  <p>"Do you not understand it?" returned the notary.</p> 
                  <p>"I understand the main thing, but not the circumstances."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, the circumstances are these: Some half-dozen of your creditors are determined to come down. They think you are sinking fast; and that you have more property now than you will at any future period. They have waited long to accommodate you, but they will wait no longer."</p> 
                  <p>"If they push me now, they will not only ruin me, but they will lose the greater part of their just dues; but if they will wait six months, they shall have every cent, and good interest."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, Loman, they can't feel sure of this," said the notary, shaking his head.</p> 
                  <p>"But they may be sure of it," replied the merchant; "and since matters have come to this pass, I must explain. Before six months are passed, I shall be the husband of a woman worth three millions at least."</p> 
                  <p>The notary opened his eyes and with a look tinged with incredulity, he said:</p> 
                  <p>"I knew not there was such a lady-marriageable lady-in our city."</p> 
                  <p>"She is not fairly a resident here. I allude to Lady Landowne, Countess of Errol."</p> 
                  <p>"And is she to be your wife?" asked Reed, who had heard of the wealthy and noble English-woman.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir. She is betrothed to me-pledged to be my wife, and for private reasons she wished the ceremony put off until fall. Now if my creditors can understand this, they would see at once how much they will gain by waiting. You see it, sir?"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly-if such is the case."</p> 
                  <p>"And such is the case."</p> 
                  <p>John Loman went on and explained his prospects fully, making all his hopes and plans appear to be fixed facts; and so well did he lay out the ideas, that the notary felt convinced of their truth and surety. So in the end he promised to see the creditors and explain it all, at the same time assuring the merchant that he would wait for him under such circumstances. He did not dream that Mr. Loman could willfully deceive him.</p> 
                  <p>Perhaps, however, Loman did not intend really to deceive. He fancied that there was a probability of his marrying Lady Landowne, and he only made this a matter of absolute certainty, instead of giving it as it really was. But the statements were designed to cause his creditors to wait; so his present ends were answered.</p> 
                  <p>And now we will return to the drawing-room Shortly after Mr. Loman left, Rosamond also arose to leave, for Lacompte's company was disgusting to her; and thus the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soi-disant</foreign> count and Arabella were left alone. For a while the damsel's heart fluttered most fearfully. A few meaningless remarks were passed, and then Alberto moved up to Arabella's side.</p> 
                  <p>"Divine creature!" he uttered, in almost agonizing accents, "you have enchanted me, and now you must either kill or save me. But you will not be cruel. Ah, you would not have smiled upon me so fondly, if you had not loved me. Lady of beauty, say-O say, that you are not indifferent."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella's brain was in a whirl. She had not expected this delicious moment so soon.</p> 
                  <p>"Speak," said Alberto. "I would know me fate at once. Pardon me if I seem abrupt, but in such a pozishong I must know the truth. If you cannot be mine, then I must never again see you, for I cannot bear the glance and smile with which you would kill me."</p> 
                  <p>"I can be yours," murmured the impressible girl, letting her head sink upon her companion's shoulder.</p> 
                  <p>"O, divinity-angel-blessing of me life! Now I shall return to me own nateve Frawnce with pride, and me noble chateau on the Seine shall shine. You will be my wife?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, yes, Alberto."</p> 
                  <p>"And not yet must you say anything to your father. Don't let him know of this, for I must surprise him. You will permit me to surprise him, sweet lady?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, yes, anything."</p> 
                  <p>"He hopes I may love your sister, for he told me so," pursued Alberto, hesitating at no falsehood that might chance to pop into his mind. "He has other plans for you. But I cannot grant them. I might respect your sister. I do respect her-but how can I love her when you are by? Ah, queen of beauty, mistress of me soul, we will be doves in love and angels in peace."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella was fairly entranced. She promised to be Alberto's wife, and she promised that she would not say a word about it to her father.</p> 
                  <p>When Mr. Loman came down, he found Arabella alone. He asked for Mr. Lacompte, and was informed that he had gone.</p> 
                  <p>"You must not be too familiar with that man, my child," said the merchant, somewhat sternly.</p> 
                  <p>"Of course not," answered Arabella, with a very comical look.</p> 
                  <p>"For he is not for you," continued the father.</p> 
                  <p>"O no," added the daughter, knowingly. ("He's for Rosamond," she said to herself.)</p> 
                  <p>The merchant had too much upon his mind to converse much, and again he sought his own room; while Arabella, with her heart all in a tumult, went to her chamber, there to meditate upon the wonderful conquest she had made.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">A DARK CLOUD, WITH ONE BRIGHT SPOT.</head> 
                  <p>A FEW evenings after the visit of Mr. Alberto Lacompte, Henry Wallace called at Mr. Loman's to see his sister. Clara was alone this evening, for Rosamond had gone out with her father and sister. Henry found her looking very sober and sedate, and after some remarks upon other topics, he asked her why she wore so long a face. She looked up and smiled; but the smile was very faint, and quickly faded away.</p> 
                  <p>"What is it?' repeated Henry, quite anxiously. "There is something, I know, for you are not apt to look so sad and downcast."</p> 
                  <p>"I will own," replied Clara, "that I do not feel very cheerful; but I know of nothing palpable to work upon my fears. It must be only a cloud of my own fancying."</p> 
                  <p>"But what can you fancy, my sister?" Henry asked, placing his arm about his sister's neck as he spoke.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, to tell you all, without any reservation, I have had a feeling come over me which tells me that I am about to lose Rosamond."</p> 
                  <p>"Lose-lose-Rosamond!" uttered the youth, turning pale. "How do you mean?"</p> 
                  <p>"Such a feeling has come over me, Henry, and I cannot drive it off. I heard her father only last night speak of having her married off soon, and I know that he means to sacrifice her to his trouble in business. He has found a chance to obtain a wealthy husband for her. O, I feel sad and down-hearted. There is a cloud hanging over me which I cannot penetrate."</p> 
                  <p>"But of Rosamond. Do you think she wishes to be married now?" Henry asked, nervously and anxiously.</p> 
                  <p>"O no," quickly responded Clara. "No, no, she does not. But there is one thing I will tell you, Henry. She loves you."</p> 
                  <p>"Loves me?" whispered the youth, the blood rushing back to his face.</p> 
                  <p>"O yes, she loves you truly and fondly. And she respects you, too."</p> 
                  <p>"But you do not know this?" said Henry, in a tone which rather bade her say she did know it.</p> 
                  <p>"I do know it, for she has just the same as told me so. If you could only know how she loves to sit and talk about you, and how her eyes sparkle when I tell her how good and kind you are, and how I love you! And sometimes, when I have told her of our early trials, I have seen the warm tear upon her cheek."</p> 
                  <p>"But what has she said?"</p> 
                  <p>"I'll tell you one thing she said; though I suppose it is hardly proper for me to betray-"</p> 
                  <p>"It is no betrayal, Clara. O, I have a right to know."</p> 
                  <p>"What right?" asked the sister, looking archly up and smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"The right of one who loves her with his whole soul," uttered the youth, earnestly. "Tell me what she has said, and then I may know if there is any hope for me."</p> 
                  <p>"I will tell you, Henry-so listen; It was only last evening that Rosamond and I were talking, and a part of our conversation was about you. I had been telling her some of your early trials, and I saw that her eyes were moist. By-and-by, when I had told about your wading through the snow one cold winter's morning to help the poor widow who lived in Mr. Wagner's woods, she laid her hand upon my shoulder, and said she-'O, how I could love such a man! With him, my life would pass as one long day of sunshine, even in honest poverty.'"</p> 
                  <p>"Did she say that?" spoke Henry, in an earnest whisper, at the same time trembling like an aspen.</p> 
                  <p>"She did."</p> 
                  <p>"Then she loves me. She loves me, Clara."</p> 
                  <p>"Most assuredly she does."</p> 
                  <p>"And if-if-I-should tell her of my love? Would she spurn me?"</p> 
                  <p>"She would rest upon your bosom, Henry."</p> 
                  <p>"It cannot be so. She is the child of affluence and high station; and I, but the offspring of poverty and want."</p> 
                  <p>"But she is also the child of a noble mother, and herself a noble girl. She despises a rank built upon wealth, and respects only those who have improved the nobler part of manhood."</p> 
                  <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6097-00000009"/> 
                  <p>"But this man to whom Mr. Loman wishes to marry her-who is he?"</p> 
                  <p>"I only know that he is the son of a retired merchant-a wild, reckless young man, who has seen Rosamond, and proposed for her hand."</p> 
                  <p>"Then it is not this Frenchman of whom I have heard mention made?"</p> 
                  <p>"O no. He is courting Arabella."</p> 
                  <p>"And what does Rosamond say to her father's plan?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have never heard her allude to the subject at all."</p> 
                  <p>Just at this moment the door-bell rang.</p> 
                  <p>"Can Rosamond have returned?" uttered Henry, as he heard the bell.</p> 
                  <p>"I think not."</p> 
                  <p>"You're wanted at the door, miss," announced one of the servants, looking into the room where the brother and sister sat.</p> 
                  <p>"Who is it?" asked Clara.</p> 
                  <p>"It's a woman."</p> 
                  <p>So Clara arose and went to the door, leaving Henry to amuse himself as best he might. He waited a few moments patiently, and as his sister did not return at once, he took up a magazine and looked over the pictures. Still she remained, and the youth then began to read some of the poetry. The first piece upon which his eyes rested was inscribed by a youthful artisan to his lady-love. It was a sweet thing, and every word seemed intended to meet Henry's feelings under present circumstances. As he closed the magazine, the sweet face of Rosamond presented itself to his mind, and he bowed his head and thought over all he had seen of her, and all that his sister had just told him. For a while, he was entirely lost in the subject.</p> 
                  <p>"She does love me," he murmured to himself. "She loves me truly, for I have seen it, and new Clara has assured me of it. And why shall I not tell her of my love? Why shall I suffer the pains of a crushed and bruised heart, when from her own lips I may receive the sweet assurance that shall make life all sunshine? I will tell her all, and if her father spurns me, I will lift myself to a pecuniary level with him without sinking to his state of soul and feeling."</p> 
                  <p>A few moments after this Henry looked at his watch. Clara had been gone half an hour. He arose and stepped lightly into the hall. The front door was closed, and he could hear nothing to indicate that his sister was near. He then went to the door and opened it. There was no one upon the steps. He saw people passing in the streets, but his sister was not there. After this he went back to the room where he had been sitting, and having waited a few minutes longer he rang the bell. The same girl answered the summons who had presented herself to call Clara away.</p> 
                  <p>"Did you ring, sir?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," spoke Henry. "I wished to know if you could toll me where my sister had gone?"</p> 
                  <p>"Sure, sir, I couldn't tell ye. I didn't see her since I spoke wid her here."</p> 
                  <p>"Then she must have gone out."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps she be, sir, and perhaps she aren't."</p> 
                  <p>"Would you be good enough to see it you can find her in the house? You will do me a great favor."</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly I will, air, for ye spake like a gintleman," she answered.</p> 
                  <p>"Kindness is never lost," said the youth to himself, after the girl had gone. And he was right. When the servant first made her appearance there was a slight show of offence upon her red face at being rung for by the brother of only a lady's maid, but his kind speech quickly disarmed her of all such feelings.</p> 
                  <p>At the end of ten minutes the girl returned and announced that Clara was not in the house.</p> 
                  <p>"Then what can have happened?" uttered Henry, betraying considerable uneasiness.</p> 
                  <p>"Och-you needn't be afeared, for Miss Clara often goes out."</p> 
                  <p>"But she would have told me."</p> 
                  <p>The Irish girl seemed anxious to relieve the youth's mind of uneasiness, and after a few moments' thought, she said:</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, sir, I think I have it now. One of her friends is very sick, an' mebbe they've sent for Miss Clara to come in a hurry. Don't ye see it now?"</p> 
                  <p>"It may be so," answered Henry, rather dubiously.</p> 
                  <p>"Be sure it must be so, sir. And mayhaps if ye wait a bit longer she'll come."</p> 
                  <p>"I'll wait awhile."</p> 
                  <p>With this the girl left, and Henry took up the magazine again and read the same piece he had read before. He read it twice, and then tried to read a prose sketch, but his mind would not retain a sense of what he read, and he closed the book. At length he looked at his watch and found it past eleven o'clock. Just then the Irish girl looked in.</p> 
                  <p>"An' has she not come yet?"</p> 
                  <p>"No," answered Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"Then perhaps she'll watch wid the sick woman all night."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you think so?" uttered Henry, hopefully.</p> 
                  <p>"I do think so," replied the girl, assuming confidence, whether she felt it or not.</p> 
                  <p>"Then I'll go. But she ought to have told me-she might-" The youth happened to think that he was blaming his sister before another, and that, too, without knowing any of the circumstances, and he held his peace.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll call up in the morning," he said, as he took his hat.</p> 
                  <p>"You'll be sure to find her then, sir."</p> 
                  <p>So Henry went home, but he was not easy about his sister. If she had been called to visit a sick person, why had she not stepped back and informed him? Even had she intended to have been gone not over ten minutes she would surely have come back and let him know, for the movement would not have taken fifteen seconds. Yet he tried to think there was no occasion for fear.</p> 
                  <p>On the following morning our hero went to his office, and having seen the boy return from his breakfast he went to Mr. Loman's dwelling. He rang at the side door, and his factotum of the night before answered his call.</p> 
                  <p>"An' sure, sir, she's not come back yet," said the girl, as soon as she saw who had called.</p> 
                  <p>"Not yet?" uttered Henry. "Have you heard from her?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not a word."</p> 
                  <p>"Can I see Ros- Miss Rosamond?"</p> 
                  <p>"I'll see if she's up yet."</p> 
                  <p>The girl went away, and in a few moments returned and told Henry to follow her. She led the way to the very room where he had sat with his sister on the evening before, and there he found Rosamond as fresh and smiling as ever, already dressed for the day. The subject which had now become fearful gave to the youth unwonted power, else he would not have been calm in the beautiful girl's presence.</p> 
                  <p>"Lady," said he, in a tone more soft and low than he would then have used to any other living person, "I have come to ask you if you know anything about the whereabouts of my sister?"</p> 
                  <p>"Of Clara?" uttered Rosamond, catching the fear which the visitor's countenance plainly revealed. "I supposed she had not yet arisen."</p> 
                  <p>"Then none of the servants have told you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Of what? What is it, sir?" the fair girl asked, turning pale.</p> 
                  <p>"Last evening I called here to see her. About nine o'clock the door-bell was rung, and the Irish girl came in and told Clara that a woman wished to see her at the door. She went, and I waited here for her. I waited an hour, and then I went to the door, looked through the hall, and then out upon the steps, but could not find her. The Irish girl went all over the house, but no Clara was to be found. And now-she is missing still."</p> 
                  <p>For some moments Rosamond gazed into Henry's face in silence, and then she arose, saying as she did so:</p> 
                  <p>"Let me look. She may have returned."</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond was gone some time, and when she returned her face wore a troubled look.</p> 
                  <p>"She is not in the house," she said, as she sank into a chair.</p> 
                  <p>"What can it mean?" Henry cried, in painful accents.</p> 
                  <p>"I know not. But who was it that called for her?"</p> 
                  <p>"Your servant said it was a woman, that was all."</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond arose and touched the bell-cord. The Irish girl was quickly on hand, for she knew 'twas Rosamond who rang, and she could not do too much for the kind, generous girl.</p> 
                  <p>"Kate," spoke the young mistress, "who was it that called for Clara, last evening?"</p> 
                  <p>"It was a woman, ma'am, an' that's all I can tell ye. She had on a hood an' shawl, an' I couldn't see her face."</p> 
                  <p>"And was she alone?"</p> 
                  <p>"She was alone on the steps, but I've since remembered that there was a man standin' adown the walk a bit with his back next to me."</p> 
                  <p>"Did you hear anything that passed after Clara went to the door?"</p> 
                  <p>"No ma'am-I went down stairs directly."</p> 
                  <p>"What sort of a man was it you saw!"</p> 
                  <p>"An' sure, ma'am, I couldn't tell ye. I only saw his back, and he was leanin' over the railin' at the time. But he was a man, I know."</p> 
                  <p>Kate was dismissed, and then Rosamond turned to Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"We must make search for her, Mr. Wallace, and if you will do what you can, I will do all I can. I will call immediately at every place where she is at all acquainted, for I know them all, and see if she has been at any of them; and you had better-but you will understand your own part."</p> 
                  <p>"Yet I should be thankful for any suggestion," said Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"I was thinking about advertising, but perhaps it would be better not to hurry about that, for if there is any villany here, such a course might make matters worse. And yet, perhaps a few notices in the daily papers might be well. But your own judgment will guide you in this."</p> 
                  <p>"You speak of villany. What villany can there be? Who in all this world could have anything against my poor sister?"</p> 
                  <p>"Alas!" murmured Rosamond, "who shall give reason for all the evil deeds of a great city? Clara was very beautiful."</p> 
                  <p>Had a thunderbolt at that moment crashed at Henry's feet, he could not have started more quickly than he did when he heard those words. They opened to his mind a dreadful suspicion, and it was far from improbable. He leaped to his feet and clasped his hands.</p> 
                  <p>"God of mercy!" he gasped, "what if such should be the case! But I will not harbor the fear yet. We will search first. O lady, if you will help me in this, I-I-shall-"</p> 
                  <p>"Help you?" interrupted Rosamond, while the blood came back to her face. "Ah, you love the sweet girl no more than I do, and should harm befall her I-I-"</p> 
                  <p>Something worked deeply upon Rosamond's feelings, and as her speech failed her the big, bright tears began to gather in her eyes. She had arisen to her feet, and now stood facing the youth. Both their hearts were at that moment hushed by the same breath.</p> 
                  <p>"If you love the sister," whispered Henry, instinctively advancing a pace, and extending his hand, "then you will take pity on the brother. O, this is a terrible fear, but-but-it may not be."</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond took the extended hand, and on the next moment-it was all unthought and unmeant; only the force of the inner soul-her head was resting upon Henry's shoulder. Quickly his arms encircled her fair form, and his cheek was laid upon hers. Thus they remained for some moments, and then the youth raised his head, but not yet could he remove his arms from their precious embrace.</p> 
                  <p>"Rosamond," he whispered, "is she not <emph>our</emph> sister?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," murmured the fair girl, without looking up.</p> 
                  <p>Reluctantly the youth dropped his hands and moved back. There were warm tears upon his cheeks, and his eyes were swimming.</p> 
                  <p>"Forgive me," he said, "but something beyond my control moved me thus."</p> 
                  <p>"Surely I have little to forgive, unless our forgiveness be mutual," returned Rosamond, smiling through her tears, "for the same strange power usurped my own heart. But let us search for Clara, now. I will dry my eyes and hasten on my mission."</p> 
                  <p>"And I on mine," added Henry, taking up his hat.</p> 
                  <p>"You will call here this noon and inform me how you progress, and learn from me what I have done."</p> 
                  <p>"I will," answered Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"And may God prosper us both!" ejaculated Rosamond.</p> 
                  <p>With a fervent Amen, the youth turned away from the place, and as he entered the street, the thought was with him that Rosamond had fully confessed her love. It was a holy, happy thought, and under its influence his deep grief became for the while softened to a state of calmer sadness, with a ray of hope to lighten it.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XI.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">ALMOST A CRISIS.</head> 
                  <p>HENRY'S first course, after leaving Rosamond, was to go at once to the office and report the whole case to Mr. Beckwith. The old lawyer heard the whole matter with perfect calmness, and when the youth had concluded, he folded his hands together and looked on the floor for some moments.</p> 
                  <p>"Have you any idea at all of what has become of her?" he at length asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Not in the least, sir," replied Henry. "I can only think of one thing," he added, with a shudder, "and that is too fearful, too dreadful to entertain."</p> 
                  <p>"To what do you allude?"</p> 
                  <p>"Clara is beautiful. You know the character of some of the people who visit sometimes at Mr. Loman's. Libertines and villains with money and aristocratic connections. They may have seen her."</p> 
                  <p>"I understand you. Henry; but I would not fear that, yet. There may be other suppositions more reasonable."</p> 
                  <p>"But what?"</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot tell you now. And you are not sure that Miss Loman may not find her. I would advise you to go to all the police and watch stations, and make strict inquiries, and then see Rosamond once more. If you learn nothing then, I will try and see what I can do for you."</p> 
                  <p>There was a strange expression of doubt and surmise on the old lawyer's face, as he spoke, but Henry did not notice it. The youth thanked his employer for his kindness, and then started out on his mission. He found the police stations by the city directory, but he was a long time getting around, for the officers had many questions to ask. Yet Henry gave them answers cheerfully, for he knew that they would help him if they could. At every station he gave a full account of all the circumstances, together with a minute description of his sister's appearance. Once or twice he had his temper severely tried by those who wondered if the missing girl was just what she was supposed to be, but he managed to get along without showing any resentment save that of just indignation-and even that was tempered with kind reproach.</p> 
                  <p>It was past three o'clock when our hero finished his round, and without thinking of his dinner, he hastened away to see Rosamond. He rang the door-bell, but he almost dreaded to see it answered, for the belief had taken possession of him that he should hear nothing favorable. Rosamond herself came to the door. Her first look was one of eagerness and anxiety, and Henry's was nearly the same. She waited an instant to see if the youth would not greet her with a glad smile, but the look of eager wistfulness faded from her face, and with a faint motion she called upon him to follow her. She led the way to the sitting-room, and before she took her seat, she spoke:</p> 
                  <p>"What have you found?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing," groaned Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"Nor have I. She has not been seen by one of her friends."</p> 
                  <p>"Poor Clara!" murmured Henry, sinking into a chair, and covering his face with his hands.</p> 
                  <p>In an instant Rosamond was by his side, and one of her soft, white arms found its way about his neck.</p> 
                  <p>"Do not give up all hope," she urged, in sweet, gentle tones. "I have gained many helpers. We have many friends."</p> 
                  <p>"We?" uttered Henry, looking up.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, Henry. I want no friend who will not be the same to you."</p> 
                  <p>"Bless you, bless you, noble girl!" cried the youth, winding his arm about the form U at now rested by his side. I cannot misunderstand such words. They are a balm for every wound save the last. O, may God keep us both till I can show you how near to heaven we can make our hearts."</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond was on the point of answering, when a heavy footfall was heard without, and in a moment more the door of the room was opened. The lovers looked up and met the gaze of Mr. Loman. Gradually the merchant's face grew dark by various changes and contortions, and his hands were clenched tightly together. Henry and Rosamond were sitting on a <unclear>sofa</unclear>, and their very looks showed that tears had been upon their faces.</p> 
                  <p>"Rosamond," the old man at length pronounced, in a tone made husky by passion "what means this? what are you doing here?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am on a business in which you should feel interested as much as any one," promptly returned Rosamond.</p> 
                  <p>"Very well, what is it?"</p> 
                  <p>"Clara Wallace is missing."</p> 
                  <p>"Ha!" uttered Loman.</p> 
                  <p>He turned his face away as he spoke, for there was an expression there which he did not wish his child to see, and which he could not keep back.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," resumed the noble girl, "she is missing, and we have reason to believe that some evil has befallen her."</p> 
                  <p>"And what is that to you?" sternly demanded the parent. "Must you look after the roving propensities of your waiting-maid? Tell me at once!"</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond's first movement was to east an imploring look upon Henry, and then she turned calmly towards her parent.</p> 
                  <p>"Father," she replied, with a slight tremulousness in her tone, "I hardly know what you mean. If you would have me leave a friend in misfortune, simply because her station is life is different from my own, you would have me act in opposition to my most sacred conceptions of duty."</p> 
                  <p>"I want no argument," quickly rejoined the merchant. "If Miss Wallace has gone, let her go. And you, sir," he continued, turning to Henry, "will leave my house at once and never enter it again. Go, sir."</p> 
                  <p>The rich blood mounted to the temples of the proud youth, and for an instant his lips were ashy pale.</p> 
                  <p>"John Loman," he said, in a low, measured tone, "where lies your superiority over me?"</p> 
                  <p>"My superiority, dog!" uttered the merchant, contemptuously. "Look at my station!"</p> 
                  <p>"And is it one that any good man would covet?" asked Henry, meaningly.</p> 
                  <p>John Loman turned pale with mortification, fear and rage. His lips trembled, and his hands were clutched.</p> 
                  <p>"Scoundrel! dog!" he hissed, "out of my house! Dare to darken my doors again, and I'll make such suffering for you as shall teach you quickly enough where my superiority lies. Out, I say!"</p> 
                  <p>It was a bitter cup for the noble youth, but he could not avoid it. He met the imploring look of Rosamond, and he saw that she was as indignant as he was. A few moments he reflected. He saw that Loman had the right to send him away, and he had no legal right to stay. With a mighty effort he quelled the passions that had been aroused within him, and then taking his hat he turned towards the mad host.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Loman," he said, "the law allows you to send me away, and the law of the land I respect. Good-evening, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"Stop-held. You remember what I told you. You will never cross my threshold again, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"I heard the order."</p> 
                  <p>"But will you obey it?"</p> 
                  <p>"I shall make no promise, air, for I know not what may occur to call me here. Should my sister return, I should most assuredly come and-"</p> 
                  <p>"But your sister will never return to this place, sir," interrupted the merchant. "If she should come back, she will only remain long enough to pack up her effects."</p> 
                  <p>"You can act your own pleasure, sir, and I shall act mine," returned Henry, in a tone made very calm by pure disgust. "Good-evening."</p> 
                  <p>And thus speaking the youth left the room.</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens, miss, if that scamp ever comes here again, I'll annihilate him! Do you understand<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6097-00000010"/>

                     </figure> stand that? Upon my soul this is a pretty go-you mixing yourself with such a herd. Do you mean ever to see that wretch again?"</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond had at first been worked upon too deeply to risk her tongue with safety, but now her feelings had become calmed by a noble sense of indignation at the glaring wrong and injustice she had heard, and she was prepared to maintain her own position of right.</p> 
                  <p>"Who is the wretch?" she asked, looking her father calmly in the face.</p> 
                  <p>"He who has just crawled away."</p> 
                  <p>"My father, I know not what you mean, nor why you should thus cast such opprobrium on one who never did you harm, and who is your equal in everything pertaining to the God-made man."</p> 
                  <p>"Beware, Rosamond!"</p> 
                  <p>"I have already done that, sir, and my own sense of right shall guide me in all I shall say or do."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you mean that you will disobey me?"</p> 
                  <p>This was hissed out in a grinding whisper, and was meant to awe the fair girl into submission at once; but it had no effect but to start her into a stronger opposition, for it revealed to her more of the unjust bitterness which governed her father's will.</p> 
                  <p>"Father," she calmly replied, but with much emotion, "you should know me well enough by this time to know on what principle I shall act. I recognize your right to govern me in all things just, but beyond that I owe allegiance to a higher power."</p> 
                  <p>"Ay!" the old man uttered with concentrated venom, "will you explain?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ay sir. First to God, and next to my now sainted mother. Ere she died she-"</p> 
                  <p>"Stop! Let me hear no more of your mother. While she lived, I suffered her to preach her nonsense to you, but now you will attend to me."</p> 
                  <p>This thrust reached with its influence to every nerve in the fair girl's system. Instinctively she raised herself up to a commanding attitude, and while her eye burned with an indignant fire, and her lips quivered with emotion, she said:</p> 
                  <p>"Leave me, sir. Between you and me there is nothing of sympathy or moral understanding. I cannot bow down to your will, when by so doing I must give up my whole rule of holy duty. I will promise you nothing, nor will I obey you in anything which I know will make me wretched and unhappy."</p> 
                  <p>"Fool!" hissed the parent. "Can you not see the brink upon which you stand?"</p> 
                  <p>"I see the brink on which you would lead me:"</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens, I'll have no more of this. And now we'll see if you dare to disobey. Let me know you to speak with that young imp of impudence again, and I'll turn you from my doors!"</p> 
                  <p>"But, my father, what reason have you for this? Would you require obedience from a child without a reason?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have reason enough. What will be our standing when it is known that we associate with paupers? Would you go deliberately at work to drive away Lady Landowne from our house?"</p> 
                  <p>A strange expression passed over Rosamond's face at these words.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, father," she uttered, shaking her head with a sad motion, "you will drive the sweet countess from our house. You do not know her. Could she know one half you have now said, she would spurn you from her."</p> 
                  <p>For a moment John Loman turned pale. Something whispered to him that his child told the truth. He knew it, and his mind took a sudden turn. He saw his outstanding notes in the hands of officers, and himself ruined if he lost the countess. He saw his fair child before him, and he remembered that she was the chief attraction of his house which drew the rich countess thither. In short, the merchant was frightened. He feared that he should loss the prize if he worked upon Rosamond's feelings any more, and with a powerful effort he controlled himself to an expression of assumed forgiveness.</p> 
                  <p>"My child," he said-but the demon lurked in his eye while he spoke-"you have been hasty and thoughtless. All I ask is, that you will obey me in this. Let not this young fellow come here again. I have reasons for this which I cannot give- But my time is precious now. Think of this, and I am sure you will see that your deepest interest lies in obeying me."</p> 
                  <p>As Loman thus spoke, he turned from the room. As soon as he reached the hall, he stopped and clenched his hands. A dark frown settled upon his brow, and his teeth were shut.</p> 
                  <p>"By the power that made me!" he uttered to himself, "we'll see about this! I've let out too much line, but I can haul it in! This must not drag along in such a fashion. Matilda Landowne must be my wife at once, or I shall lose her. By heavens, I do believe the child spoke the truth. The countess is another of those overstocked creatures of piety and philanthropy, and she must be kept easy until I get the knot once tied. This six months arrangement wont do. I must contrive some means to bring her in sooner."</p> 
                  <p>With this latter idea working in his mind, the merchant took his hat and went out. There was room in his brain for more scheming, and he meant to go at the work.</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond had a spell of weeping after her father left her, but she dried her eyes at length, and then sat down to calm reflection. She spoke her thoughts to herself in words.</p> 
                  <p>"God keep me and guide me," she murmured, "in this hour of trial. O, why will my father suffer himself to be swayed by such feelings! But I must submit? I know a child must obey its parent; but must that obedience extend to the doing of evil? Must I make myself miserable? "And, she continued, while her eye moistened, and her voice sank to a low key, "must I forget the holy precepts of my own dear sainted mother, and overstep those moral bounds which she set for me out of the rules and knowledge of her pure soul? No, no, I would rather leave this roof with all its clustering associations of holy memory, than to remain, and be bowed down under the weight of such things as I must suffer, if my father adheres to his purpose. O, how I could love that father if he would only be kind to me. But I cannot leave Henry. I will not. No living person has a right to force me to it. God himself planted in the bosom of his creatures the laws which should govern them in their loves."</p> 
                  <p>She arose as she spoke thus, and walked across the room. Her head was bowed, and her hands were folded upon her bosom. At length she stopped and raised her eyes towards heaven.</p> 
                  <p>"Mother," she said, "you promised to be with me in the spirit if you could. O, look down upon me now, and touch me with thy angel wings, for I need thy counsel and assistance. I will not forgot my God nor thee. To him my first thought I give, my next to you. And the next my own soul shall have." A few moments she remained standing with her eyes raised and her hands yet clasped, and then a new thought came to her mind. She remembered one friend yet living to whom she might look for counsel-one in whom she could repose the fullest confidence. She thought of the countess, and to her she was resolved that she would reveal the new love that had found life within her. She did not mean to expose her father, but only to tell her own love, and look for counsel. She felt happier now, for she knew that Lady Landowne would wish only to serve her lasting good.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE STRICKEN ONE.</head> 
                  <p>AWAY in an obscure part of the great city, where poverty and crime went hand-in-hand, and where the atmosphere reeked with foul miasmas, stood an old wooden building, the basement of which was of rough stones. It was located about midway in a narrow lane, and stood back from the muddy sidewalk some feet further than did its neighbors. In one corner of the basement was a low groggery, at the window of which were arranged a lot of pipes, broken glasses, old, dried-up lemons and bottles. These things were hardly visible through the dirty panes, but they were plain enough to announce to the poor wretches that inhabited that quarter, that rum and tobacco were to be found inside. Upon entering this place from the street, it was necessary to descend four steps, and when once in there, a man with a powerful, nervous organization might possibly survive. The bar, which was covered with a green, greasy oilcloth, extended across one side of the apartment, taking the aforesaid window within its precincts, while outside of that, were arranged old wooden forms or benches, on which sat some half-dozen men of the very lowest order of humanity. Behind the bar stood Mrs. O'Brady the keeper of the place, and the owner of the furniture and other garnishments. She was a corpulent woman, somewhere on the shady side of fifty, and though naturally of a very red and pimpled hue about the face, neck and arms, yet she had now gained a brownish yellow color, probably from the smoke and dirty air that helped make up the atmosphere of the place.</p> 
                  <p>While the hostess was mixing a glass of gin and cider for one of her customers, there came the tinkle of a little bell breaking through the smoke and steam. Said bell had been rung once before, but no one heeded it.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha, now, Mrs. O'Brady, an' who is it a ringin' that bell?" asked a burly fellow, who sat upon one of the benches sucking an old dudeen.</p> 
                  <p>"An' what bizness is that to you, Phil. Heany?" retorted the hostess, giving the gin and cider a stir with a brass spoon upon which the verdigris stood in thick scales.</p> 
                  <p>"Och, now, don't be offinded, Mrs. O'Brady; but who is the lodger? Falx, an' haint I heard that same bell a tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, this long while, an' now's the first time I iver axed ye the first question concernin' it. Ye's ought to pride me for my modesty, inthirely, an' so ye had. But who is the lodger, darlint?"</p> 
                  <p>"An' didn't I told ye as 'twas a sick woman, avick?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, Mrs. O'Brady, ye's niver tould me so at all, at all."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, thin ye know now, an' ye may as well put up yer dudeen, seein' as the baccy's all gone, an' go home to yer dear Judy, for ye know she'll be anxious about ye's till ye git home."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, Mrs. O'Brady, I wish Judy Heany was like yerself-thin how happy and continted would I be to go home. Ah, 'twould be a home thin, and so it would."</p> 
                  <p>The fat hostess smiled grimly through the dirt and smoke at this compliment, and Phil. Heany continued:</p> 
                  <p>"Mrs. O'Brady, who is the gintleman that calls here sometimes?"</p> 
                  <p>"Gintleman? What gintleman?" uttered Mrs. O'B., looking up with apparent astonishment. "The likes ov yerself is the only gintleman that's been hereabouts," she added, handing the "stone fence" she had been mixing to its owner.</p> 
                  <p>"Och, none of that, Mrs. O'B.," cried Phil., energetically, knocking the ashes from his dudeen, and putting it into his pocket. "Didn't I go down the river yesterdy, wid Mike, after clams, and whin I come back, didn't the clock jist be upon the stroke of midnight? An' didn't I see a man jist entheriu' yer door, Mrs. O'B.? Not this door, avick, but the big door foremost the house."</p> 
                  <p>"No, yer didn't, Phil."</p> 
                  <p>"But I did."</p> 
                  <p>"Ye was dhrunk, ye brute."</p> 
                  <p>"Not a bit ov it. I did see a man go through the doorway; an' he was mighty illegantly dressed, too."</p> 
                  <p>"Och-ho," cried Mrs. O'Brady, brightening up, "it was the docthor, Phil."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, that's it, Mrs. O'B. Yes, yes, I didn't think ov that. But it's an illegant docthor, he has intirely."</p> 
                  <p>"Who is he?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why, the sick man."</p> 
                  <p>"O yes," added the hostess, quickly. "I didn't mind who ye meant at first."</p> 
                  <p>Just then the little bell tinkled again,</p> 
                  <p>"Faix, Mrs. O'Brady, ye don't mind yer sick man much."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm goin'," said the woman, slyly removing all the money from the drawer, and then turning to Phil. "Here, Phil. Heany, you tend here while I'm gone; but mind, don't ye come in here till somebody comes in."</p> 
                  <p>With this the woman waddled off out of the barroom by way of a narrow door, near the end of the bar, through which she pressed her body with difficulty. But we will go in advance of her.</p> 
                  <p>Away up in the fourth story, which had to be reached by way of dark, rickety stairs, and where ended a dubious passage, was a small room lighted by a skylight The door was not of itself very strong, but a thickness of pine plank had recently been bolted to it, and thus it had been rendered capable of holding out against any effort of mere physical strength to remove it. Within the attic sat Clara Wallace!</p> 
                  <p>The furniture of the place consisted of a low trundle-bed, three old chairs, and a table. The skylight was not high, but it was firmly secured with transverse iron bars, so that it offered no means of egress. The fair girl sat now upon the edge of a low bed, and she was gazing upon the door. She was very pale and wan; her eyes were red and swollen; her hair all matted and dishevelled, and her dress much soiled and torn. It were difficult to conceive of misery more deep than that which was shadowed upon her face.</p> 
                  <p>"Why don't they come?" she uttered, rising from her seat and moving a piece of fishing-line which hung down from the wall. She seized this, and pulled it, and in a moment more the tinkle of the bell was heard below. This was a simple contrivance whereby Clara was enabled to ring what was originally meant for a doorbell.</p> 
                  <p>In a few moments the sound of heavy steps was heard in the passage below, and soon the stairs began to creak and groan as though an ox were coming up. In due time, the heavy bolts were withdrawn, and the door of the attic was opened, and Mrs. O'Brady then made her appearance.</p> 
                  <p>"Did you ring, miss?" the animal asked, as she entered.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," returned Clara, looking upon the woman with a shudder. "I am very faint and hungry."</p> 
                  <p>"But I gave ye food enough this mornin', an' ye didn't ate it."</p> 
                  <p>"I couldn't eat it."</p> 
                  <p>"An' why?"</p> 
                  <p>"It was dirty and bad."</p> 
                  <p>"Och, the howly mother deliver me. An' ye are so dainty thin, that ye can't ate what'll kape me wid health for the whole year. Then ye may starve."</p> 
                  <p>At first Clara was frightened; but a few moments' reflection told her that the woman was paid for keeping her, and she believed, enough to warrant good, pure food and drink.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't think I shall starve here, woman," the poor girl said, firmly and indignantly. "I will leave here before that comes."</p> 
                  <p>"Ha, ha, ha, an' how'll ye leave, eh!"</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Brown does not mean that I shall suffer for want of proper food, and when he comes again I will tell him how I am treated."</p> 
                  <p>"By the howly St. Patrick, you'd better tell him!" cried the bestial beldam, in tones of fury. "Let him hear a whimper out ov ye, au' I'll break every bone in yer blessed body!"</p> 
                  <p>"Just as you please about that," returned Clara, shuddering, more at the character of the beldam than with fear. "If I am to die, I had as lief you would kill me as to be starved. If Mr. Brown does not pay you enough for keeping me, then I will see that he pays you more. At any rate, you may be sure that he shall know it, and from him I will understand the matter."</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. O'Brady seemed a little nonplussed by this show of boldness, for she had not expected it, and after some moments of thought she turned away towards the door. When she reached it she stopped and looked back on the prisoner.</p> 
                  <p>"What d'ye think about it, miss?" she asked, with a searching look into Clara's face.</p> 
                  <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6097-00000011"/> 
                  <p>"You know what I think, and you know I mean what I say," was the girl's laconic answer.</p> 
                  <p>With this the woman left the room and bolted the door after her. Clara was left alone about half an hour, but at the end of that time, the hostess returned, and in her hand she bore a basket.</p> 
                  <p>"There, miss," she snapped out, while her whole big body shook with rage, "see if you can't make a male now wid yer babyishness. I'm thinkin' Misther Brown will be afther payin' me somethin' If I've got to feed ye in this way."</p> 
                  <p>She opened the basket and took out first a bottle, then a sixpenny loaf of bread, and then a howl and spoon. She hesitated there for some moments, and thrice did she place her hand within the basket, and withdraw it empty, but at length she reached deeper down, and brought up a small paper parcel, which she placed by the side of the bread.</p> 
                  <p>"There," she growled, as she made for the door, "I hope 'twill choke ye till death-I do, by the howly mither."</p> 
                  <p>And with this affectionate ejaculation she once more left Clara alone.</p> 
                  <p>The poor girl went at once to the little table, and upon uncorking the bottle she found it to contain milk, not of the most unadulterated kind, but still sweet and good. The loaf was white and fresh, and within the paper she found a piece of cheese. Having wiped out the bowl with her apron, she poured our some of the milk and then broke in-part of the bread. The food was to her at the time a perfect ambrosia compared with what she had previously had in the same place, and she felt much refreshed when she had satisfied her appetite. She was stronger now, and she commenced to pace the narrow apartment: This she followed for half an hour, and then she sat down once more and took up an old Bible that she had begged of her keeper. This she read for two hours, and what the refreshing food had been to her body was this bread of life to her soul.</p> 
                  <p>But poor Clara! She was very miserable, notwithstanding, and after she had closed the holy book, she bowed her head and wept. By-and-by the shades of night began to gather about the earth, and one by one the tiny, twinkling stars set themselves in the dark vault of heaven. The prisoner could see a bright cluster through the upper window, and for a long while her gaze was fixed upon them. She watched them until they had rolled away from the line of the space afforded by the narrow scuttle, and others had come to take their place. Thus passed the time in that lone, dreary chamber until the distant clock chimed the hour of ten. Clara was startled at the brazen notes, for she dreamed not that it was so late. She had risen, and had thought of preparing for retiring, when she heard the creaking and groaning of the stairs. She listened a moment, and a cold shudder crept through her frame as she recognized the step. She sought a chair and sat down, and in a few moments more the door of the room was opened and a dark, tall form glided in.</p> 
                  <p>"Clara," spoke the intruder, peering around through the darkness, "where are you?"</p> 
                  <p>The maiden was upon the point of speaking when an idea suddenly rushed upon her mind, and she remained quiet. If the new comer should pass on to the extremity of the room and leave the door open, why might she not slip out? But the hope failed her, for she was discovered, and the visitor approached her.</p> 
                  <p>"How is this, Clara? Have you no light? or, have you blown it out?" asked the man-for a man it was, and his voice had a familiar sound.</p> 
                  <p>"I have had none this evening, sir," answered Clara, faintly.</p> 
                  <p>"Then we'll have one at once. Where's your candle?"</p> 
                  <p>"On the table, sir."</p> 
                  <p>The man drew a cigar case from his pocket, and having taken from thence a match, he lighted it, and then touched it to the wick of the candle, which he easily found by the glimmer of the match. As the rays of the light began to penetrate and dispel the gloom, they rested on the features of Mr. Alberto Lacompte!</p> 
                  <p>"Now, my dear," he said, as he placed the candle back on the table, and then seated himself, "we can see each other. Perhaps you wonder at seeing me here this evening?"</p> 
                  <p>"I should wonder at nothing you might do, sir," answered the maiden.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, you do me injustice, sweet one. You would wonder if I were to be cruel, and more still if I should cease to love you."</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Lacompte had lost his French idiom, and spoke now with all the native freedom of an English born subject. Clara looked into his face as he made his last remark, and an expression of loathing and contempt overspread her features.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Lacompte-"</p> 
                  <p>"Brown, if you please, Clara. Remember, I am Mr, Brown. Gustavus Brown."</p> 
                  <p>"So I have called you when speaking of you in the presence of Mrs. O'Brady, but there is no need that the farce should be kept up here."</p> 
                  <p>"But you misunderstand. My name is not Lacompte, nor was it ever. That is only my cognomen for the aristocracy. My name is Brown."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, sir, your name matters little. Names cannot alter characters. You promised me that I should know why you dragged me away from my home, and sir, I ask you now to tell me."</p> 
                  <p>"It was my love, sweet one."</p> 
                  <p>"Why will you He to me thus? You know you speak falsely."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no, Clara, by heavens, I do not. I do love you, and you are going to be my wife."</p> 
                  <p>There was a little burning answer upon the maiden's tongue, but she kept it back, for she meant to question the villain first. This was the fourth time he had visited her in that place, and not yet had he offered violence or harm beyond imprisonment. And this was to Clara a deep, dark enigma. She could in no way account for the atrocious deed, except she received his word as truth.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Lacompte-"</p> 
                  <p>"Brown, I told you."</p> 
                  <p>"Let me speak as I please here, sir, where only you and our God can hear me. If you held a single thought of making me your wife, why did you bring me hither? Why subject me to such fearful torture and anguish?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because, my dear," returned the rascal, never at a loss for an answer, "I feared I should lose you if I left you at liberty. I saw you at Mr. Loman's, and I fell in love with you at once; and from that moment I swore within myself that I would possess you. Do you not see it?"</p> 
                  <p>"No sir, I cannot see any reason in your statement. Had you loved me, and wanted me really for your wife, you would have at least asked me if I could return your love, ere you took such a course as this."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no, lady, that does not follow as a matter of course, for I had reason to believe that your love was already pledged."</p> 
                  <p>"Pledged, sir? My love?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, sweet."</p> 
                  <p>"And to whom?"</p> 
                  <p>"You know Isaiah Beckwith."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," returned Clara, faintly.</p> 
                  <p>"And you remember his son, Captain John Beckwith?"</p> 
                  <p>Clara's thoughts turned back into the past, and she did remember the noble man to whom allusion had been made. She remembered his beaming smile, and his frank, manly look; and she remembered how he had once asked her if her heart was hers to give away-and how she whispered that no one but her brother held more than a friend's place, and then she remembered how he had drawn her upon his bosom and asked her to keep that heart until he should once more return to his native land. All this Clara remembered, and when she now looked inward, she found the young captain's image engraven upon her heart. She had not forgotten him, but every word he had spoken was faithfully treasured up, and sometimes she allowed herself to hope that at some future time he would take up the subject again. This opened the fountain of the poor girl's soul, and with her head bowed upon her hands, she burst into tears.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, it touches you, does it?" uttered Lacompte. "You see I was right. Had I asked you for your hand, you would most assuredly have answered nay."</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, I should have done it, sir," cried Clara, starting to her feet, and facing the villain with a flashing eye, "for your very face would have told me what a villain you were. You know you speak the most palpable falsehood when you tell me the things I have listened to from your lips. Your heart is black and reeking with crime, and-"</p> 
                  <p>The fair girl hesitated here, for she saw that Lacompte was becoming angry, and she suddenly remembered that if she chafed him too far, she might make more misery for herself.</p> 
                  <p>"Go on, go on," said the man, while a sarcastic look overspread his face. "Go on-your remarks are very interesting."</p> 
                  <p>"O sir," groaned Clara, again bursting into tears, "what can I do? You have dragged me into the most torturing misery, and now keep me here. O, what have I ever done to deserve this? What have I ever thought of harm to you or yours? Why, O why is it that I, who never did harm to a living thing, should be thus cruelly treated? Why is it?"</p> 
                  <p>The scamp was for a few moments somewhat affected by the words and grief of the unfortunate girl, but he soon managed to drive all outward signs of the emotion away, and said, "Pooh! you make too much of this. Be calm-be quiet, and you shall not suffer. You shall not remain here long."</p> 
                  <p>"And why-why <emph>am</emph> I here?" cried the girl, with sudden energy, at the same time springing forward and grasping Lacompte by the arm. "Tell me."</p> 
                  <p>"I've told you enough, and shall tell you no more."</p> 
                  <p>Clara again burst into tears, and Alberto Lacompte began to grow uneasy. At length he said:</p> 
                  <p>"You only make the matter worse by this continued fretting. Be easy, and all shall yet come out well."</p> 
                  <p>"But how shall it come out well?" cried she, gazing wildly into his face. "Shall I go back to my home-to Mr. Loman's?"</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps so."</p> 
                  <p>"Then why not now? You know I cannot be your wife; but carry me back, and I will be your friend forever. O, do carry me home!"</p> 
                  <p>Clara hung upon the man's neck with a look of such implorement as might make a demon kind, gazing through her tears into his face. And he was moved-more so than he dared to own. He put the maiden away from him, and then turned towards the door, and said:</p> 
                  <p>"I must go now. I only came to inform you that you would leave this place soon."</p> 
                  <p>Again the poor girl sprang forward, and this time she sank upon her knees. With her hands clasped, she implored of her captor to set her free and carry her home; but he only pushed her from him, and without a word slipped quickly from the room. Clara heard the heavy bolts moved, and soon the sound of Lacompte's departing footsteps was heard on the stairs. She listened to the sound of those feet until she could hear them no more, and then she arose and threw herself on her bed.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">LOVE'S FIRST VOW.</head> 
                  <p>HENRY WALLACE had done everything in his power towards finding his sister, but without effect. Mr. Beckwith had also used all his efforts to that end, and the policemen had been on the alert. But no tidings of the missing girl could be gained, nor could any clue be found to guide him in the search. Henry had become pale and careworn, for the grief lay heavy upon his heart, and the worst fears haunted him. He had heard twice from Rosamond since his last visit there, and she had been as unsuccessful as himself. One thing puzzled him. All were filled with the most unmixed wonder at the circumstance, save the old lawyer. He alone shook his head in a mysterious manner, and insinuated that there was a cause for all this. But he did not speak his thoughts. When Henry asked him for some explanation he only shook his head, and said, "that he had nothing to say."</p> 
                  <p>One evening when the moon was shining brightly, and the stars were all smiling upon the earth, Henry was walking in one of the principal thoroughfares, when he chanced to look upon a carriage that was passing. He at once recognized John Loman's equipage, and had just time to see that the merchant and Arabella were within. The carriage passed on, and the youth stopped and followed it with his eye. When it had gone from his sight, he started up from the reverie into which he had fallen, and turned his gaze towards that quarter of the city where stood the merchant's mansion. He reflected a few moments longer, and then, with a quick, determined pace, he started on, and he did not stop again until he had reached the dwelling from which he had recently been turned with a curse. He rang the door-bell, and Kate answered it. She did not stop for him to ask any question, but at once said:</p> 
                  <p>"Come right in, sir. The old tiger has gone wid his own cub, an' Miss Rosamond's all alone."</p> 
                  <p>Henry could not help smiling at the quaint energy with which this was spoken, and with a simple "thank you," he followed her into the house. She conducted him to the small sitting-room, and went to call her young mistress.</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond soon came, and a warm, happy smile lighted up her features, as she received the grasp of her visitor.</p> 
                  <p>"I could not resist the temptation," said Henry, after he had taken a seat, "and I trust that I do not intrude."</p> 
                  <p>"You know your presence can be no intrusion to me, Henry. But what of Clara, our sister?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing, yet," uttered the youth, in a tone of sadness. "Not the least clue can we find. Have you heard anything?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing, Henry, Alas, poor Clara! If she should be dead!"</p> 
                  <p>"Ah Rosamond, did I know she was dead, I should be no more unhappy than I am now, for there are some things worse than death."</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond shuddered at this, for she knew well what was meant.</p> 
                  <p>"Yet I shall hope," she said. "I shall hope to see her sweet smiles once more."</p> 
                  <p>"God grant it!" fervently ejaculated Henry. "But I should feel much better to know where she is. O, if she should be-but I'll not fear that. She may be dead, and I left all alone!"</p> 
                  <p>He bowed his head as he spoke, and covered his face with his hands. Rosamond glided to his side, and with one arm about his neck, she sat down by his side.</p> 
                  <p>"No," she whispered, "not all alone, Henry."</p> 
                  <p>The youth looked into her bright, lovelit eyes, and in a hushed tone, he said:</p> 
                  <p>"She was a faithful sister."</p> 
                  <p>"Ay," answered Rosamond, "and a lovely companion."</p> 
                  <p>"Could you take her place if she were gone?" Henry asked, with sudden energy.</p> 
                  <p>"Speak plainly, Henry."</p> 
                  <p>"Then can you love me well enough to be my companion through life?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>The lovely maiden gazed fixedly into her companion's face as she spoke, and all over her features dwelt the calm assurance of perfect trust and truth.</p> 
                  <p>"And you could be my wife?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>"And would you be content to help me lay the road that shall help to carry me on to competence? Remember Rosamond, I am poor now."</p> 
                  <p>"And if I were poor, would you not love me the same?" asked the beautiful girl, looking earnestly into Henry's face.</p> 
                  <p>The youth started and for a moment his head was bowed.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah Henry, does it-"</p> 
                  <p>"Stop, stop, Rosamond. You misunderstand me. I meant not to hesitate in answering your question. I only thought whether I ought to answer you fully. I know your soul is high enough above the dross of earth to bear lightly any disappointment which can only rob you of the glitter of outward show."</p> 
                  <p>"Go on," said the fair girl, earnestly, but without nervousness.</p> 
                  <p>"I will go on. Were you different in mind and feeling, I would not tell you this. Rosamond, your lather is even now bankrupt."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you know this?" she asked, calmly, as though the subject had been of the least moment.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, and I have known it for some weeks."</p> 
                  <p>"Will you tell me how you learned it?"</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond drew her arm more closely about her lover's neck as she spoke, and gazed into his face with a fond, imploring look.</p> 
                  <p>"You do not blame me that I have told you this?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, I bless you for it."</p> 
                  <p>"Then, Mr. Beckwith has several executions already made out against your father, but the creditors have bade him withhold from serving them at present. But this has had no influence with me Had your father been worth his millions, I could not have kept back my love, and had I felt sure that you returned that love, I should have confessed it. Yet I feel that life is happiest when enjoyed through the products of our own efforts."</p> 
                  <p>"You are right, Henry, for I know something of this. I have thus far in life had wealth all about me, and the only joy I ever experienced from it has been the ability to do some good to the children of misfortune about me. The true philanthropist finds joy in wealth, but the sordid, never. But tell me one thing more. Why are not these executions served?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because the creditors have requested us to withhold them."</p> 
                  <p>"What's the amount of debts now in Mr. Beckwith's hands?"</p> 
                  <p>"They amount now to some forty thousand dollars."</p> 
                  <p>"And why have the creditors granted this respite?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because the merchant hopes to pay all his debts if he can have time."</p> 
                  <p>"But how?"</p> 
                  <p>"Have I not told you enough?"</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond's eyes fell to the floor, and for awhile she seemed to ponder upon the subject thus broached. At length she looked up again, and with an earnest expression, she said:</p> 
                  <p>"Henry, we should trust each other now. I feel that-pardon me for so speaking, but to me it is a sad, solemn truth-that you are the only one in whose soul I can lay my whole trust."</p> 
                  <p>"O!" ejaculated the happy youth, drawing the sweet girl close upon his bosom, "God knows that you shall never find your trust betrayed here. I cannot toll you all I feel. I can only say, my life, my love and my truth must last and perish together."</p> 
                  <p>"I believe you. And now answer me. Why have these creditors done as they have?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why," returned Henry, with much hesitation, "you know, I suppose, that your father intended to marry with Lady Landowne."</p> 
                  <p>"I was aware of that," said Rosamond, with a shudder.</p> 
                  <p>"Then you know all now."</p> 
                  <p>"But has my father given out that he will wed with the countess and thus pay his debts?"</p> 
                  <p>"He has my love."</p> 
                  <p>"Now mark me, Henry," uttered the fair girl, promptly and decidedly, whilst the rich blood mounted to her pure, white brow, "I know that my father will never give his consent to our union. I know that his anger would be unbounded at the thought of such a thing. But I must now be my own mistress, for I have reached that age when the legal authority of a parent ceases. It is hard to disobey a father, but it is harder to endure life-long misery simply at the whim and prejudice of another. Go on, then, and when you feel that a life-companion would make you happy, my heart, my hand and my energies are all yours."</p> 
                  <p>More closely did the enraptured youth press the noble girl to his bosom, and for some minutes he spoke not. He could not speak, for his soul was too full. It was one of those seasons when the deep anthem of the heart turns all its music inward, and when words would seem to make discord with the heavenly notes. When he did at length speak, his voice was tremulous.</p> 
                  <p>"Rosamond," he said, "I had not dared even to hope for such a joy as this; and I cannot tell you now how I bless you. But if we both grow old together, if we walk down the slope of time in company, the winter of life shall find the fires of our love as warm and glowing as now. Believe me. I may seem to speak wildly, but. I know my own heart, and I know yours. My sister was the first to tell me of the angel that dwelt beneath this roof, and I needed but to see one warm smile upon your face to know that truth and love, with nobleness of soul, went hand in hand with you. Erelong I shall be in business of my own, and to you I tell the plan for<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6097-00000012"/> the first time. I have told it to no one else. Mr. Beckwith will take me as his partner on the day that sees me enter upon my twenty-fifth year of life. And that will be three short months. You know his business is good. It yields him now over eight thousand dollars a year. Shall we not be very happy?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," murmured Rosamond, laying her head upon her lover's shoulder.</p> 
                  <p>"And," resumed Henry, "Mr. Beckwith will do still more for me. Next fall he will have his own house empty, and he says if I can find a wife who will make me happy, I must take his house and give him a home. Ah, he is a good man, Rosamond. You will find no better man in this world. It is his unswerving honesty that has given him such a vast circle of friends, and he stands as one among the few lawyers who have no enemies."</p> 
                  <p>"And if Clara could come and live with us," murmured Rosamond.</p> 
                  <p>Henry started, as these words fell upon his ear, and the color forsook his check.</p> 
                  <p>"O!" he uttered, prayerfully, "she must be found, for we shall never be fully happy, if she comes not back. And there is another who will mourn most deeply if she be lost."</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond looked up inquisitively.</p> 
                  <p>"Did you ever know Captain Beckwith?"</p> 
                  <p>"Joseph?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, my employer's only child."</p> 
                  <p>"I used to know him," said the fair girl, "and," she added, while a faint smile played over her features, "I remember how I once wished, in my childish heart, that he would fall in love with me. But that was some years ago. I was a child, then."</p> 
                  <p>"Captain Beckwith loves my sister, I know, and she is under promise to him not to give away her hand until he returns. He will be here, if no accident happens, by the time I am his father's partner. O, what a happy household we might have."</p> 
                  <p>This brought the lovers fully back to the subject of Clara's mysterious disappearance, and for some time they conversed upon it. Rosamond was the most hopeful, though neither of them dreamed of the strange things that underlay the whole affair.</p> 
                  <p>It was late when Henry arose to depart. For the first time he received from Rosamond's lips a sweet kiss of love, and this helped to make his heart lighter than before, and it had the effect, too, of giving his soul more hope for the lost one.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">MR. LACOMPTE MAKES FREE WITH SUNDRY THINGS.</head> 
                  <p>ON the day following the events last recorded, Mr. Alberto Lacompte might have been seen by one who had taken particular notice of very foppish individuals, looking about the house of John Loman. He did not look as a thief would do, but he kept in the street and passed and repassed the dwelling many times, never going so far either way but that he could keep his eye upon the door. He mingled with the crowd which went to and fro, and when he reached the extent of his chosen walk, he would loiter until he could join another crowd on his return. It was about the fashionable dinner hour, and consequently many people were out.</p> 
                  <p>At length the front door of Loman's dwelling was opened, and the merchant came forth. A glow of satisfaction overspread the fellow's face as he saw this, and with careful movements he kept out of the way until Mr. Loman had passed from sight. Then he boldly approached the house, ascended the marble steps, and rang the bell. A servant showed him into the drawing-room, and at his request Miss Arabella was called. The foolish girl bounded from her room with a quick step when she knew who had called to see her, and as she entered the drawing-room, her smiles were profuse.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, adorable one," uttered Mr. Alberto Lacompte, extending his hand, "this is indeed an honaw."</p> 
                  <p>"It is an honor to me, sir, lisped Arabella.</p> 
                  <p>"Don't say so, ma'amaiselle. Say rather you condescend to greet me. But ah, my love tells me our meeting must be sweet. Where is your father?"</p> 
                  <p>"He has just left the house, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"Just left, did you say?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, gone to his business, not more than five minutes since."</p> 
                  <p>"Another <foreign xml:lang="FRA">faux coup</foreign>. I had hoped to see him here. It is much disappointment. But I shall not suffer since I find you here."</p> 
                  <p>"I think my father would have been very glad to see you."</p> 
                  <p>"I know he would, but I have been very busy the last week. One gentilhomme in Philadelphia have been try to buy my estates in Frawnce, and I have been there to see him. I offered to sell him my estate in the Rhine, but he wanted those near Paree. He even go so far as to offer me three millions of frances, but I no sell 'em. I shall return to my own nateve Frawnce, and I shall want my chateau near the capital."</p> 
                  <p>Lacompte stopped here, and cast a dying look up into Arabella's face, and then with a deep groan, placed his arm about her waist.</p> 
                  <p>"Angel," he gasped, "must I return broken-hearted, or will my light of life go with me?"</p> 
                  <p>Arabella was powerfully affected. She trembled upon her companion's bosom, but never thought of rising.</p> 
                  <p>"Speak," whispered Alberto. "Shall my angel-my little demoiselle-my own love, go with me to my sunny home?"</p> 
                  <p>"Do you-mean-"</p> 
                  <p>"I mean you, sweet."</p> 
                  <p>"O Alberto, if you should prove false!"</p> 
                  <p>"False! Me, the Count of the Seine, and Marquis of the Lower Rhine, prove false? Ah, Arabella, speak not so any more, or you will break my heart. Can the sun prove false? Can the ocean dry up? Can the stars stop twinkling? Can the great earth tip over and spill us off? Can-can-can the soul of love forget its idol? O divine one, break not me heart!"</p> 
                  <p>Arabella was in ecstasies. She nestled closely upon the count's bosom, and wound her arms about his neck.</p> 
                  <p>"I will be yours," she murmured.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, angel-I bless thee. You will be my own little sweet countess of the Seine, and Marchioness of the Lower Rhine?"</p> 
                  <p>"Shall I be all that, Alberto?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes; and more, too. My Bourbon friends shall 'ave the throne of Frawnce, and you shall be a duchess-a princess, my own love."</p> 
                  <p>"A princess of the blood, shall I be, Alberto?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"You shall, 'pon my honor."</p> 
                  <p>"O how fine! But we shall visit America, sometimes?"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly. The <hi rend="i"/>Princess Arabella shall visit her nateve country sometime. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Certainment</foreign>."</p> 
                  <p>"O Alberto!"</p> 
                  <p>"O sweet Arabella!"</p> 
                  <p>"You will never be false?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nev-are!"</p> 
                  <p>"You will always love me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Eternally!"</p> 
                  <p>"And I shall be-"</p> 
                  <p>"Countess of the Seine, Marchioness of the Lower Rhine, Duchess of Waterloo?"</p> 
                  <p>"Of Waterloo?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, sweet."</p> 
                  <p>"O how fine!"</p> 
                  <p>"And princess of the blood!"</p> 
                  <p>"O Alberto!"</p> 
                  <p>"Now, when shall we be married?"</p> 
                  <p>"When you choose."</p> 
                  <p>"In two weeks?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. But we must have a great wedding."</p> 
                  <p>"Not here, my own love. We will have the celebration at our chateau. You will smile when I tell you of a very funny freak which 'ave come into me head. I would be married very privately. Your father must not know it. He will be very angry, for he thinks I will make your sister mine wife. But how can I? O, if I had nevare seen you, I might 'ave married Rosamond-but now. Once I hinted to him that I loved you, and he told me that he had engaged you to another. And shall I lose you? Must I lose my heart? If I speak to your father, he will lock you up, and give me Rosamond, and I should not dare to refuse, for I told him once, before I saw your angel face, that I would marry her. O Arabella!"</p> 
                  <p>"O Alberto!"</p> 
                  <p>"You will not lisp this to your father?"</p> 
                  <p>"No."</p> 
                  <p>"You will be married in private, and wait till we reach our chateau before we make the great celebrashong over our nuptials."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, Alberto."</p> 
                  <p>"Bless you, sweet."</p> 
                  <p>"We will associate with only the lords and ladies."</p> 
                  <p>"That's all, loved one; and the king and queen."</p> 
                  <p>"How delightful!"</p> 
                  <p>"You will not hint this to your sister; for she would go into spasms right away."</p> 
                  <p>"O the artful thing! She has pretended to me that she did not like you."</p> 
                  <p>"But you can see through all that now."</p> 
                  <p>"Of course I can."</p> 
                  <p>"I hope she wont suffer; for, 'pon my honaw, I never gave her the least encouragement."</p> 
                  <p>"O, she will get over it, easily, Alberto. She cannot love as I can; for I do not think she can appreciate the real man."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps not. It must be a horrible situashong. But, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">n' importe</foreign>, we will secure our own joys, and let others look out for themselves."</p> 
                  <p>For some moments after this there was a silence, during which time Arabella rested her head upon Alberto's shoulder. At length the count said:</p> 
                  <p>"My dear, I am very thirsty."</p> 
                  <p>"I will ring for a servant. What shall I order?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, my angel of beauty, you could not serve me with your own sweet hands. In the country to which we are going, the noble lord never feels so happy as when from the hands of his own sweet wife he receives the cooling draught. And the noble lady, when no visitors are near by, feels proud thus to show her love. But if 'tis not the fashion here-"</p> 
                  <p>"Hold, Alberto! Anything shall be in fashion which would please you. What shall I bring you?"</p> 
                  <p>"A little wine and water."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella quickly started up from her seat, and left the room, but ere she passed from hearing, her lover uttered, "Bless you." She turned and smiled upon him, and then passed out.</p> 
                   
                  <p>As soon as Arabella was gone, Mr. Alberto Lacompte arose and went into the back parlor. At the extremity of this apartment was a door, which opened to a sort of conservatory, and into this the adventurer made his way with all possible despatch. Here were a number of doors, but the fellow was not long in selecting the one he sought. On his last visit, while sitting in the back parlor, he had seen a servant enter this room with some articles which struck his fancy very strangely, and now he seemed bent on making an examination for himself. He tried the closet door, but found it locked. He happened to have some keys in his pocket, and he thought he would take them out and try them. They were very curious keys for a count to carry, being very close in resemblance to those sometimes carried by professed burglars. He soon found one that suited his purpose, and the door was quickly opened. This closet proved to be the depository where Mr. John Loman's plate was placed.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Alberto Lacompte's next movement was most marvellous. He seized upon six gold salt spoons, and transferred them deftly to his right vest pocket. Twelve gold napkin rings followed to his cost pocket. Next came four gold salt cellars, which went into the opposite pocket of his coat. After this he removed silver spoons, forks, tongs, etc., with wonderful alacrity, until every available pocket was filled. Then he closed the door, and locked it, and reached the sofa in the front room before Arabella returned; and when she came she found him poring intently over a book, which he held open in his hand."</p> 
                  <p>"Alberto, shall I mix up some of this for you?" asked the maiden, setting the waiter down.</p> 
                  <p>But Alberto did not look up.</p> 
                  <p>"Alberto! Love!"</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Love!</emph> Who calls me <emph>Love?</emph> Ah, Frawnce! Frawnce! Me own nateve- What! and are you here, my life's light? Was't you who spoke?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, Alberto."</p> 
                  <p>"Forgive me, soul. Over the inspirashong of the divine poet, me mind has wandered back to me own chateau on the Seine, and to me mind I had painted a picture of the home where me life's jewel-me own wife-shall shine and dazzle all beholders. Wine, sweet, a little wine."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella poured out a glass of sparkling wine, and Alberto tossed it off.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, my soul, you must play me one tune, only one."</p> 
                  <p>So Arabella took her seat at the piano, and while she played, her swain raised the bottle to his lips; but the music of the piano drowned the gurgling notes of the bottle, and the Count of the Seine imbibed in safety; and while the girl played a dashing measure at the close of the piece, he filled the bottle partly up from the water pitcher.</p> 
                  <p>Once more the maiden promised to be the "princess of the blood," and once more the sweet kiss was exchanged; but Alberto was wary of a close embrace, for he feared that his pockets might jingle out some strange story of betrayal, so he only allowed his beloved to take his hand, and then, with tears of joy in his eyes, he took his leave.</p> 
                  <p>Two hours later, and Mr. Alberto Lacompte was in a back room of Mrs. O'Brady's house, at work over a small, portable smelting furnace. The gold spoons, rings, etc., were in the crucible, to he run into ingots, and the silver was to follow. The lover had made quite a profitable visit.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XV.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">ANOTHER MYSTIC AFFAIR.</head> 
                  <p>IT was early in the evening, and in one of the lowest gambling bells of the city were assembled three men about a card table. They had no cards now, but were engaged in earnest conversation over a bottle of brandy. He who seemed to take the lead was a tall, stout looking man, with enormous black whiskers, and long, coarse black hair. His face was very red, and seemed much colored by exposure. Yet this seeming was false. Few would recognize that individual. Arabella Loman might have met him in the street a hundred times, and never dreamed he was the Count of the Seine and Marquis of the Lower Rhine. And yet that man was Alberto Lacompte. He had on now new whiskers and hair, and his clothing was adroitly padded, so as to change his bodily appearance entirely. And then the coloring upon his face was very skillfully laid on.</p> 
                  <p>One of the others was the same man who called on Henry Wallace for the watch-seal, and his companions called him Nanny Walsh. The third man was older than either of the others, and but for the wicked look of the eye, might have passed for a very respectable merchant. He was dressed in black, neatly and modestly, without any show of jewelry, wearing a white cravat about his neck, gold-bowed spectacles on his nose, and wearing his hair combed behind his ears. His garments were cut after the Quaker fashion, and the hat had the broad brim to match. He was called Quaker Snaps, and was one of the most successful villains in the city. He had any quantity of disguises, but he only wore them when going on regular "knock down" missions. To him was generally assigned the task of fleecing clergymen and philanthropic old people of both sexes.</p> 
                  <p>"By the whipper, Brown, that was a good haul," said Walsh, addressing Lacompte by his other name.</p> 
                  <p>"I call it pretty fair-nets me about seven hundred."</p> 
                  <p>"Exceeding fair," added Snaps.</p> 
                  <p>"But wont they mistrust you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Who mistrust me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why-any of 'em. The old 'un, or the girl."</p> 
                  <p>"No. The girl wont at any rate, and the old 'un wont dare to."</p> 
                  <p>"Good. But mind, Brown, we mustn't be wooled about this girl business."</p> 
                  <p>"How do you mean?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why, you shan't play possum with us-keep us out of our share. By the piper, if you get the girl, we ought to have more of the money."</p> 
                  <p>"But there hasn't no money come yet; and as for my having the girl. I don't think I shall. I think my best plan will be to sell her."</p> 
                  <p>"Eh? Sell her?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>"Propel-explain."</p> 
                  <p>"Why, I'll self her back to her father. If I take her and do no harm. Have a mock wedding, and then let her be her own mistress. I think Loman will give me more to return her than he will to bestow upon her as my wife."</p> 
                  <p>"Exactly," returned Walsh.</p> 
                  <p>"Yea, verily," added Snaps.</p> 
                  <p>"But," resumed Brown, "let this pass now. I'll pay you your per centage of the spoils sometime to-night, and now to this other matter. Snaps, you must go ahead."</p> 
                  <p>"Must I?"</p> 
                  <p>"Surely-of a verity you must. You know all the ropes now, and can work round the matter as you please. What say you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why, If I must, I must."</p> 
                  <p>"Enough said."</p> 
                  <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>Henry Wallace was alone in his office. He had just closed a register into which he had been copying some deeds, and had thrown his head forward upon his hands in a sad, thoughtful mood. His thoughts were with his sister, and ever and anon a deep groan would escape him. Two weeks had now passed away since Clara's disappearance, and no clue of any kind had yet been gained respecting her whereabouts. The new-found love of the gentle Rosamond had served to increase the intensity of the youth's desire to find his lost sister, for he thought of the happiness which awaited that event.</p> 
                  <p>"Alas, poor Clara!" he uttered to himself, "how shall my heart bear it up in justice to her while I mourn thy loss. If thou wert here, what joy would be mine!"</p> 
                  <p>Thus had he spoken, when he was aroused by the entrance of some one into the office. He looked up and saw a stranger, a middle-aged man, dressed in a Quaker garb, and carrying a gold-headed cane. He was a sedate, modest-looking man, and seemed, by his air and dress, to belong to the clerical order.</p> 
                  <p>"Friend, I hope I do not Intrude upon thee," he said, in a soft, modest Cone.</p> 
                  <p>"Surely not, sir," returned Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"Is thy name Wallace?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir."</p> 
                  <p>"And thy baptismal name is Henry."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir."</p> 
                  <p>"Did thee over have a sister-a mild, sweet-faced girl?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, yes," uttered Henry, quickly.</p> 
                  <p>"Was her name Clara?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. What of her?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have seen such a girl, and she has sent me unto thee with a message."</p> 
                  <p>"O, she lives, then! She lives, sir, does she not?"</p> 
                  <p>"I trust she does, my son."</p> 
                  <p>"And-and-is she safe?"</p> 
                  <p>"She is sick, even unto danger."</p> 
                  <p>"Sick!" cried Henry, starting forward and grasping the man by the arm. "But where, where is she? Can you tell me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Keep thy spirits cool, my son, and I will answer thee. Thy sister is sick, and wishes to see thee very much. I found her in a loathsome place, and would have removed her at once, but she chose to see thee first. Wilt thou follow me to her lowly abiding place?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, even to the grave-only lead me thither, quickly."</p> 
                  <p>"Be not in unseemly haste, my son, for the distance is far, and I am not so strong in limb as thou art. But we will not be over long upon the way. I am ready, and thou mayst follow at once."</p> 
                  <p>With a quick, nervous movement Henry shut the windows closely up, and having put on his coat and hat he extinguished the lamp, and then went out and locked the outer door after him.</p> 
                  <p>"Now follow me," said the guide; and thus speaking, he passed out into the main street, and then turned down towards the lower part of the city.</p> 
                  <p>He walked moderately, to be sure, but it seemed to Henry as though a snail would have overtaken him.</p> 
                  <p>"Can you not walk a little faster, good sir?" the youth asked, earnestly.</p> 
                  <p>"Not comfortably, my son," mildly returned the Quaker. "But your anxiety is running away with you. Don't you see that we are walking even now as last as others are walking?"</p> 
                  <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6097-00000013"/> 
                  <p>Henry did see that he and his companion had even overtaken and passed some, and he resolved to complain no more.</p> 
                  <p>By-and-by they left the wider and more crowded streets behind them, and entered upon those ways where the common people found their homes. Here the noise and bustle had almost ceased, and in many of the dwellings the lamps had all been extinguished, showing that the hard-working classes had already sought their rest. But anon the scene changed. The streets grew more narrow, crooked and filthy; lights were more plenty at the dingy windows, and the noise was heard again; but now it was not the hum of business nor the roll of carriage-wheels. It was the howl of the maniac drunkard, the hoot of the vagabond youths, and the yell and laugh of the besotted debauchee. Henry shuddered at the sight, and his blood almost curdled in his veins. Instinctively he kept nearer his guide, and soon he took his arm.</p> 
                  <p>In the cellars the sound of music and dancing was heard, and upon looking down into these pools of sin and shame, our hero saw men and women of all colors, ages and characters, from the reckless tawdry villain to the miserable, starving, shivering fool.</p> 
                  <p>"What sort of a hell is this?" asked Henry, as they passed a place more noisy than all the rest.</p> 
                  <p>"One very common in Christian cities, my son," answered the Quaker, with too much of a sneer in his tone to reveal a kind heart.</p> 
                  <p>"But my sister is not here?"</p> 
                  <p>"Where?"</p> 
                  <p>"In such a locality."</p> 
                  <p>"She is not far off, my son."</p> 
                  <p>"Mercy! How came she here?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do not know. But look sharp, now, for we come to a dark way here. Tread carefully."</p> 
                  <p>As the guide spoke he turned abruptly to the left, into a narrow, dark alley, where the youth could hardly see his hand before him. It was a dubious way, but he followed close by his conductor, and erelong they stopped at the foot of a flight of wooden steps that seemed to lead upon the outside of some building. Slowly and carefully did Henry make his way up these steps, and when he reached the top his guide stopped and commenced to fumble around a door that opened to the left.</p> 
                  <p>"Do we enter here?" asked the youth.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, if I can find a way to open the door," answered the guide. "I am not acquainted here."</p> 
                  <p>Soon after this Henry heard a bolt snap, and then he saw the door open.</p> 
                  <p>"Now you may follow, my son."</p> 
                  <p>The Quaker had closed the door behind him, and at a short distance he came to a second door, and upon opening this a faint light glimmered on the scene from a small tin lamp, that stood at the head of a flight of stairs close at hand. Upon ascending these, the guide took the light up, and Henry had now an opportunity to look about him. He found himself in a wide passage-way, the walls of which were plastered, and discolored by age, and smoke, and dirt. A little further on he came to a room in which there was no furniture of any kind, but this lack was more than made up by the amount of dirt which had been gathered into piles on the floor.</p> 
                  <p>From this room they passed into a sort of wide closet, and beyond this Henry saw a new door, which seemed to be made of pine plank, and thickly studded with large spikes. This door the Quaker entered, and then went in, but Henry hesitated, for he saw two men in there.</p> 
                  <p>"What is all this?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"To what do you allude, my son?"</p> 
                  <p>"This place and these men."</p> 
                  <p>"O, these are physicians who have called to see your sister, and are waiting to see you to find what you will have done."</p> 
                  <p>Upon this the youth immediately entered the room, but no sooner had he crossed the threshold, than the light was extinguished, and on the next instant the door closed.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, doctor, you are careless," uttered one of the men.</p> 
                  <p>"Be not angry, my friends," replied the voice of the Quaker, "for verily it was an accident."</p> 
                  <p>For a few moments Henry stood there in utter impenetrable darkness. Instinctively he cast his eyes about to see if he could find a window, but he met nothing but the same chaotic blackness. He had just time to take a sweep around, when he felt a hand laid upon his shoulder.</p> 
                  <p>"Who's this?" asked a voice, which our hero knew he had heard before.</p> 
                  <p>"It's me," answered Henry.</p> 
                  <p>Just as he spoke, another hand was laid upon his arm, and on the next moment he was thrown upon the floor.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha! what's this?" he cried, struggling with all his might to arise.</p> 
                  <p>"Easy, easy, my son. We only mean to relieve you of any dangerous weapon you may carry, Hold easy, a moment."</p> 
                  <p>The youth used some language which could never have been drawn from him in his cooler moments, and he continued to struggle, but to no effect. He was held down as with a grip of iron, and he felt hands working around among his pockets. When this was finished he was left alone, and as he started to his feet he heard the hurried shuffling of feet towards the passage. He made a spring that way, but only in season to be thrown violently back by the concussion of the closing door.</p> 
                  <p>For some time Henry lay upon the floor stunned by the blow and the fall, but as his senses returned, he arose to his feet and listened to see if any one were near. He was soon satisfied that he was alone, and upon this he approached the wall and commenced to feel around, to find, if he could, some means of egress. He soon came to the door, and he found a latch, but he could not open it. From thence he followed around until he came to a low pallet on which was a sack of straw or shavings. Beyond this he felt the wall, and so he continued until he came around to the door again. There was no break in the wall, save of the doorway, and a projection of the chimney.</p> 
                  <p>What could it all mean? At first the youth was too excited for calm thought, but gradually his mind grew more composed, and the first thing that struck him with wonder, next to the bare fact of the outrage, was the voice he had recognized. He pondered some time upon this, and at length he remembered the man who had called upon him to answer the advertisement concerning the watch-seal. It was the same voice-the tones were peculiar and not to be forgotten. And upon this came another thought. He had caught a glimpse of the two men who had been sitting in the room he was now in, and one of them he had noticed was tall and straight, with a heavy beard. It was the very man who had committed the murder, and from whom he had taken the seal!</p> 
                  <p>The more Henry thought of this, the more assured was he that he was correct. And now the whole thing appeared plain to him. He had been thus seized because he held a clue to the murderer. He remembered that he told the man that he knew somewhat of the assassin's personal appearance, and might they not now fear that he would expose that assassin, should he ever meet him? So ran Henry's thoughts, and he felt assured that he was right.</p> 
                  <p>As soon as the youth's mind had become settled on this point, he went to the door and commenced to kick and halloo with all his strength of limb and voice, but got no answer.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">SOME VISITS WITH STRANGE RESULTS.</head> 
                  <p>IT was on the afternoon of the day following the outrage we have just recorded, that Lady Landowne and Rosamond sat together in Mr. Loman's small sitting room. They were both of them sad, and Rosamond had been weeping.</p> 
                  <p>"Forgive me, my love," said the countess, winding one of her white arms affectionately about Rosamond's neck, "but surely I have a right to know the whole truth of this matter, and you are the only one to whom I can apply. I appreciate your feelings, but if you will look more carefully at the matter, you will see that I am to be the only suffering party. If you feel that your father deserves my hand, then say so, for to keep it from him would then be doing him some harm. But if he does not deserve it, then we rob him of nothing-take nothing from him; but on the contrary, we save one who does not merit a life of misery and woe. Do you not understand me, Rosamond?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, yes, and I will tell you all," returned the fair girl, gazing tenderly up into her companion's face. "O, many a time I have shuddered in view of what I feared might result from a union between yourself and my father. At first I really believed that your influence over him had made a new and better man of him, but, alas, I can hope so no more. I will save you, my friend, even though in so doing I speak against a parent. But I cannot drive from me the conviction that it is partly my influence that has drawn you here so much, and made our house pleasant to you."</p> 
                  <p>"You speak truly, there, Rosamond," uttered Lady Landowne, drawing the beautiful girl more closely to her. "It was your sweet self which made this house pleasant to me, and that gave even your father a character in my eyes."</p> 
                  <p>"I have felt so," resumed Rosamond, "<unclear>and</unclear> hence have I earnestly prayed that my parent might be true and faithful. But I fear you will never be happy as his wife."</p> 
                  <p>"Let me ask you one more question. What truth is there in the report that he needs a wealthy wife to help him out of pecuniary difficulty?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is true," said Rosamond, faintly.</p> 
                  <p>"Bless you, sweet one," fervently ejaculated the countess, kissing the fair girl upon the cheek. "And now we will drop this matter."</p> 
                  <p>"Let me ask you one question first," interrupted Rosamond.</p> 
                  <p>"Go on, for you surely have the right."</p> 
                  <p>"Then have you not told my father that you would not be his wife?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, love, not even by a hint."</p> 
                  <p>"Or have you in any way-"</p> 
                  <p>"I have done nothing, Rosamond, to move him in any way but in hope for my hand. But why do you ask?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because he has been so sullen and morose for these few days past. A dark cloud is continually upon his brow, and an icy coldness about his eyes and lips."</p> 
                  <p>"That may be on account of some pecuniary embarrassment."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"I fear not, and then he is only fretful and silent, and snappish, when disturbed."</p> 
                  <p>"I am sure I cannot help you solve the problem, so now let us refer to another subject Have you heard from Clara Wallace, yet?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not a word."</p> 
                  <p>"Has there not been gained any clue of any kind?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing," answered Rosamond, sadly. "Every possible means has been employed, but without effect. O, I fear some evil has befallen her."</p> 
                  <p>"I feel a strange interest in that child," said the countess, in a tone so calm, that it almost belied her words. "Let us go up to her room."</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly," responded Rosamond; and accordingly she arose and led the way, the countess following close behind her.</p> 
                  <p>The room which Clara had occupied was a neat, small chamber in the third story, and the poor girl's things were all there just as she had left them. For a while the two visitors gazed about, and then the countess said, in a tone not quite so calm as she evidently tried to make it:</p> 
                  <p>"Rosamond, I must confess to you a bit of a secret. I once had a friend whom Clara resembles so nearly that I am forced to believe there must have been some relationship between them. If such is the case, it may lie in my power to help the poor girl some, if we can find her. I wished to come up here that we might examine some of her things, and see if any little memento or bit of writing could be found to guide me in my judgment. It would be no harm to look."</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly not," answered Rosamond, quickly. And then in a lower tone, she added, "and will not that which benefits the sister also benefit the brother?"</p> 
                  <p>"Most assuredly," returned the countess, casting a meaning look into the maiden's face.</p> 
                  <p>"Here is her drawer where she kept her trinkets," said Rosamond. "Here are her books, and here her drawing and needle work. See how neat and orderly everything looks-just like her own dear self. O poor Clara."</p> 
                  <p>While the maiden spoke, the countess gazed fixedly upon the articles she mentioned, but, as she closed, the lady turned towards the little mahogany book-case. The first thing there that attracted her attention, was a small morocco-covered Bible, that fastened with a plated clasp. This she took down and opened. She looked upon the name it bore on the fly leaf, and read, "Nancy Varney." Her eyes remained riveted upon that name for some time, but during the while, she turned as pale as death, and a fearful tremor shook her frame.</p> 
                  <p>"What is it?" asked Rosamond, somewhat alarmed at the sudden emotion manifested in her companion.</p> 
                  <p>"Who is this? this name-written here?" uttered the countess, pointing to the name she had found on the fly-leaf. "Did you ever hear Clara say?"</p> 
                  <p>"O yes," answered Rosamond. "That was her mother's name before her marriage."</p> 
                  <p>"And did you ever hear Clara say anything of her father?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. He died about a year and a half before her mother, though neither she nor Henry knew much about him, as he was seldom at home."</p> 
                  <p>"And this man's name was Wallace?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>The countess gazed again on that name, and again the deathly pallor overspread her face; but she soon regained somewhat of her composure, and turning towards Rosamond, she said:</p> 
                  <p>"You must not wonder at my emotions, but there is something very strange in all this. Do not ask me any questions, but listen to me. No, not listen, but- It's very strange. You wont wonder, Rosamond. Poor Clara-poor Nancy!"</p> 
                  <p>For a moment Rosamond was startled by the fear that the lady's head was turned, but she soon found that 'twas only a momentary wandering of the mind, and she was easy again.</p> 
                  <p>"Rosamond," spoke the countess, alter having remained silent for some time, "do you remember of ever having seen in Clara's possession any sort of peculiar keepsake?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, she has quite a number."</p> 
                  <p>"Has she anything in particular from her mother?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, yes," replied Rosamond, after a moment's thought, "she has an Iron cross-a small, unique affair, she always wears about her neck."</p> 
                  <p>The countess started, and again turned pale; but the pallor was quickly followed by a rushing back of the blood to her face, and for a while she seemed to be quite dizzy.</p> 
                  <p>"What have you ever heard her say about the cross?" she at length asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, she has told me that it was a talisman, for so her mother told her. I think it was originally the price of a life saved. Clara's mother saved the life of some one-a woman, I think-and this cross was given to her by the person she had saved, as a sort of remembrancer. She gave it to her children, Henry and Clara, when she was dying, and Clara thinks she meant to have told them something more than she did concerning the cross, but the coming of death closed her lips."</p> 
                  <p>"There is an interest attached to the simple iron cross, isn't there?" whispered the countess, with a sort of vacant, mindless expression.</p> 
                  <p>"There is surely," returned Rosamond. "It should surely be a sacred memento to Clara-and Henry too; for it only speaks to them of their mother, but it is only the symbolical record of one of her noblest acts of life."</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, uttered the countess, with a cold shudder, "you speak truly. But," she added, starting to her feet, "the girl must be found. O how blind! She must be found, Rosamond! Do you understand?"</p> 
                  <p>The maiden was startled by the sudden vehemence of the woman, and for some moments she gazed into her face without speaking.</p> 
                  <p>"O fool that I have been!" the lady continued, without seeming to notice Rosamond. "O John Loman, I ought to have known better than to have trusted you after I had once seen your face! Why, O why have you lied to me so basely?"</p> 
                  <p>"Lady," spoke Rosamond, laying her trembling hand on the arm of the countess, "what means this? What now of my-"</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, pardon me, Rosamond. I forgot myself. But I meant nothing-nothing now. Let it pass. Let us return to the parlor. Come, let us go. I will tell you more sometime. But come, now."</p> 
                  <p>As the countess thus spoke, she turned from the room, and Rosamond followed her in a sort of speechless wonder. When they reached the hall, they met Kate Kavanaugh.</p> 
                  <p>"Och, ma'am, it's here ye are. Sure an' I've been huntin' for ye's all over the house."</p> 
                  <p>"What is it, Kate?"</p> 
                  <p>"A gintleman is in the parlor, as would like to see ye."</p> 
                  <p>"Who is he, Kate?"</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know, ma'am."</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond went immediately to the drawing-room, and Lady Landowne followed her. The latter thought not what she did, for her thoughts were far from present things.</p> 
                  <p>It was Isaiah Beckwith who had called, and Rosamond saw on his face a cloud of trouble at once.</p> 
                  <p>"Lady Landowne, Mr. Beckwith," said Rosamond, as soon as she had greeted the visitor, at the same time leading the countess forward. This is the gentleman with whom Henry studies," she resumed, forgetting that the simple Christian name fell with a strange familiarity from her lips.</p> 
                  <p>The old lawyer arose from his seat, and his eye burned with a keen fire as he gazed into that lady's face. His gaze was strong and searching, and, strange as it may seem, there was, from that moment, a bond of firm respect established between the wealthy widow and the honest old lawyer.</p> 
                  <p>"I think I have heard your name before, sir," the countess said, as she sat down near him.</p> 
                  <p>"Very likely Mr. Wagner may have mentioned it, madam."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, that is it. Yes, yes," the lady uttered, while a gleam of intelligence rested on her fair features. "I remember now, that he thought at first of giving me letters to you."</p> 
                  <p>"And why did he not?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because he had not heard from you, and I think he told me you talked some of going out West."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, yes. And so he sent you to our friend Loman?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir."</p> 
                  <p>"Very well. I did talk some of going West, but I changed my mind. But," Mr. Beckwith continued, turning to Rosamond, "when was Henry here last?"</p> 
                  <p>"Four days ago, sir," returned Rosamond, with a sudden show of fear.</p> 
                  <p>"And have you not heard from him since?"</p> 
                  <p>"No sir. But why do you ask?" uttered the maiden, turning pale?"</p> 
                  <p>"This is strange business," the old man said, with some energy. "The young man is now missing!"</p> 
                  <p>"Missing!" echoed Rosamond and the countess, at a breath.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," returned the old man. "He has been missing since last night, but I do not know as there has any harm befallen him. Perhaps he may have-"</p> 
                  <p>At this instant the tread of Mr. Loman was heard in the hall, and in a moment more that gentleman entered the room. He seemed quite surprised to find the old lawyer there, and for a moment there came a look of fear upon his face but he soon drove it away. He greeted Beckwith first, and then with a big smile he turned to the countess.</p> 
                  <p>"I did not expect this honor, sir," he said to Beckwith, after he had taken a seat.</p> 
                  <p>"I simply call on a little matter of inquiry, sir," returned the lawyer, somewhat coolly.</p> 
                  <p>"May I ask what?"</p> 
                  <p>"I called to see if I could find any clue to the whereabouts of Henry Wallace, here," replied the old attorney, looking his host sharply in the face.</p> 
                  <p>John Loman came nigh quailing before that glance, but he called his native impudence to his aid, and bore it out.</p> 
                  <p>"But why should you look here for such a youth?" he asked, with insolent severity. He felt quite free since he had found that the visitor did not come on any legal business.</p> 
                  <p>"Because I supposed that your roof might sometimes give shelter to an honest man. But I find nothing here to help me, unless indeed, you can give me some information."</p> 
                  <p>"Me, air? Would you insult me? Must all<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6097-00000014"/> the paupers who are lost, be searched for in my house?"</p> 
                  <p>"Whom do you call a pauper, John Loman?"</p> 
                  <p>"All the poor-house sprouts, sir," the merchant replied, sarcastically.</p> 
                  <p>"And will you inform me what makes a gentleman?" the lawyer asked, keeping back his indignation.</p> 
                  <p>"Why do you ask me that question?"</p> 
                  <p>"Simply because I would know wherein Henry Wallace falls below yourself, in any sense."</p> 
                  <p>"I wish not to be insulted, sir, in my own house."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, John Loman, you are the pauper! Not in all the world have you now one source of true joy. Who can be poorer than that? Henry Wallace pities you from the bottom of his heart. He pities you because you are ruined in your pecuniary-"</p> 
                  <p>"Stop, sir, stop!" yelled Loman, springing to his feet. "I will not thus be insulted in my own house! Leave me, sir! Leave my house!"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly, sir," said Beckwith, with a bitter smile, at the same time rising to his feet. And then turning to Lady Landowne, he added:</p> 
                  <p>"Matilda Landowne, I would see you alone at some early moment."</p> 
                  <p>"Let it be now, sir," quickly replied the countess. "You can accompany me to-"</p> 
                  <p>"Hold!" interrupted the merchant, starting forward.</p> 
                  <p>"Not now, lady," said the lawyer, taking no notice of Loman, "for now I must look further for Henry. But I will call on you to-morrow. Let it be at noon."</p> 
                  <p>"I shall be yours at that time, sir, and you may call upon me at my rooms."</p> 
                  <p>"But, madam," gasped the merchant-</p> 
                  <p>"Good-day."</p> 
                  <p>And thus speaking, the old lawyer turned from the company, and left the room.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THREATS AND ENTREATIES.</head> 
                  <p>FOR a while after Mr. Beckwith had gone, there was general consternation, and of course each was differently moved. The merchant was moved by absolute fear; the countess, by astonishment and gratitude-gratitude that she had fathomed the man herself; while Rosamond's emotions it would be difficult to analyze. She felt some fear, some disgust, some gratitude-for she, too, was glad that the countess had had an opportunity of seeing for herself-and some mortification.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Loman was the first to speak.</p> 
                  <p>"Lady Landowne," he said, in a tone tinged with command, "I trust you will not keep your appointment with that man."</p> 
                  <p>"Why not, sir?" she asked, looking up with some surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"Because he is not a man whom it would be safe for you to trust. You do not know him, and let me assure you that it will be for your interest to maintain a cool distance."</p> 
                  <p>"Of course, sir, I must see him as I have promised; and then, perhaps I can judge for myself."</p> 
                  <p>"But, lady, are you not aware that character is something? The talk of people who may see this lawyer going to your own private rooms will not be-"</p> 
                  <p>"Stop, air," peremptorily interrupted the countess. "I do not think Mr. Beckwith is such a man."</p> 
                  <p>"Then you will see him?"</p> 
                  <p>"I shall, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"And you will listen to the falsehoods he will pour into your ears."</p> 
                  <p>"Falsehoods of what, sir?"</p> 
                  <p>"Of everything he speaks about. He is not to be trusted. Rosamond," continued the merchant, turning to his daughter, "you know Isaiah Beckwith's character?"</p> 
                  <p>"I think I do, father."</p> 
                  <p>"I thought so. And did you ever hear anything good of him?"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly I have, father."</p> 
                  <p>"What?" uttered the parent, showing his anger. "Did you ever hear good enough of him to counterbalance his evil? Speak the truth, now!"</p> 
                  <p>And the merchant looked sternly upon his daughter as he spoke.</p> 
                  <p>"I must speak the truth, sir, if I speak at all. Among those who know him best, he has the reputation of being one of the noblest, most generous, kind and true-hearted men that ever-"</p> 
                  <p>"Stop! Leave the room! Go this instant!"</p> 
                  <p>The noble girl did not tremble, now, for she was sustained by a consciousness of having done nothing wrong, and she feared nothing while her own heart held approval. When we remember that her father had often scoffed at and scorned the sacred lessons of truth which her sainted mother had taught her, we shall see how she thus felt unable to bow down to his evil requirements. She turned towards the door without speaking more, and the countess turned to follow her.</p> 
                  <p>"Lady Landowne, I would speak with you."</p> 
                  <p>"Be brief, then, sir, for I wish to speak with Rosamond."</p> 
                  <p>"It is my wish that you should not see my daughter again this evening. I should prefer she would remain alone."</p> 
                  <p>"If you command it, sir, of course I shall obey."</p> 
                  <p>"I do not command you, madam, but I wish to command my child. She has not shown the spirit I would see in a child."</p> 
                  <p>"Have you anything in particular to say further, sir?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. I would still urge you to beware of this lawyer."</p> 
                  <p>"Stop, sir. Anything further on that subject will be very disagreeable to me."</p> 
                  <p>The countess spoke this firmly, and for a while the merchant seemed at a loss what to do or say, but at length he found words to express himself, though his tone was somewhat changed.</p> 
                  <p>"Matilda," he said, "I have been unguarded. Can you forgive me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Of course I can, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"O bless you! I was-"</p> 
                  <p>"Stay, Mr. Loman. Do not misunderstand me. I did not say that I would be to you as I have been; but I can forgive you, as we are taught in the Bible to forgive. But let this pass now. At some other time. Ah, here is my carriage. My coachman is punctual. I must run and get my things. I will see you in a few moments."</p> 
                  <p>Thus speaking, the countess left the room and hastened away to the little sitting-room where she had left her bonnet and shawl, and there she found Rosamond. She hastened to the side of the weeping girl, for she was weeping bitterly-and throwing her arms about her neck, and kissing her, she said:</p> 
                  <p>"Fear not, love. All shall yet be well. Be of good cheer-treat your father respectfully-and fear no evil consequences from what has happened. I shall see you again, erelong. One kiss. There, good-by."</p> 
                  <p>And with a light smile the countess bounded away. In the drawing-room she stopped a moment to speak with the merchant.</p> 
                  <p>"But there is no need that you should go now," urged the host.</p> 
                  <p>"I must go, sir, for I have company this evening, so I ordered my coachman to be here at six. But I shall see you again. Good-by."</p> 
                  <p>"But one moment," cried Mr. Loman, catching the lady by the hand. "Do not go away under a misunderstanding. I may have been hasty, but O, I meant it all for your good. You will not let it divide us. O tell me that you still love me-that you will not break my heart-that-"</p> 
                  <p>"I will not break your heart, sir. Be not afraid of that."</p> 
                  <p>"Bless you."</p> 
                  <p>"Adieu."</p> 
                  <p>"Adieu, loved one. I shall call on you soon, if you do not come here."</p> 
                  <p>The last part of his sentence was pronounced just as the lady was passing out at the door, and before he could collect himself sufficiently to wait upon her into her carriage, the coachman had performed that office for him; so he returned to the drawing-room to ponder on the ill-starred fate that had met him.</p> 
                  <p>Among the things that came to his mind was the conduct of his child, and after brooding over it a while he started to find her. He went at once to the sitting-room, and she was still there, but her tears were dried up, and a look of calm determination had settled upon her features.</p> 
                  <p>"Rosamond," spoke the parent, in a cold, harsh tone, "are you aware of the base conduct of which you have been guilty?"</p> 
                  <p>He seated himself as he spoke, and gazed hard into the girl's face.</p> 
                  <p>"I knew not that I had done anything I could help, sir," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Done nothing you could help? What do you mean by that? Do you think to trifle with me, when I ask you concerning the character of Isaiah Beckwith?"</p> 
                  <p>"Would you have had me tell a falsehood?"</p> 
                  <p>"I would have had you keep your stuff to yourself."</p> 
                  <p>"But you asked a question and I had to answer it."</p> 
                  <p>"And if you were foolish enough not to wish to speak as you knew I wished you to speak, why did you not profess ignorance on the subject?" he asked, angrily.</p> 
                  <p>"Because that would have been downright falsehood."</p> 
                  <p>"But you had better told that than to reveal to the countess such a disposition as you manifested. What do you think will be her opinion of you, now?"</p> 
                  <p>"As far as my rule of life is concerned, I am not actuated by what others may think. But, sir, what would Lady Landowne's opinion of me have been, had I told a lie?"</p> 
                  <p>"She would not have known it."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir, she would, for I have spoken with her concerning Mr. Beckwith before, and she knew my opinion. O my father, I wish you would allow me to speak as freely to you as you speak to me."</p> 
                  <p>"And what would you say?"</p> 
                  <p>"Honest men do not starve under ordinary circumstances."</p> 
                  <p>"And am I not an honest man? I am as honest as the world goes, and that is enough. You may keep your sentimentality for yourself, only you had best beware how you may let it in to thwart me. Do you understand?"</p> 
                  <p>"I will say no more about it, sir."</p> 
                   
                  <p>

                  </p> 
                  <p>"And now tell me how you came to speak of Mr. Beckwith with the countess?"</p> 
                  <p>"It was in the course of ordinary conversation. She informed me that she had heard the name before, and asked me what sort of a man he was. Of course I told her."</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose you took occasion to praise the extraordinary qualities of Mr. Wallace at the same time."</p> 
                  <p>"No sir."</p> 
                  <p>"It's lucky you did not."</p> 
                  <p>As the merchant thus spoke, he arose from his chair and took several turns across the room. He had not yet betrayed half of the anger that was alive within him, for he felt a strange fear or presentiment that everything done against Rosamond would work against himself with the countess. At length he stopped and turned towards his child.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, Rosamond," he said, with a stern, commanding look, "I have one word to say to you. If you ever again speak one word in the presence of others that can in the least reflect on any act of mine, I'll send you away to a place where you will be safely kept. Let me hear, or see anything more of your sanctimonious whim when it can cross any plan of mine, and this house shall be your home no more! Upon this you may depend."</p> 
                  <p>With this Mr. Loman left the room, and as soon as Rosamond was left alone, she sank down upon her knees and prayed for assistance. She prayed that she might be meek and humble, and that she might have strength to bear up under trouble. Yet her spirit was not crushed, nor did she mean to do anything she felt to be wrong, even to avoid altercation with her father. One thought came to her, to soften her sorrow. The countess was truly her friend. Then she thought of Henry, and her heart sank with fear and trembling. If harm had come to him, her lot was dark indeed.</p> 
                  <p>What could it mean? Why were the brother and sister thus taken away? What strange fate had conspired against them? With this came the strange conduct of the countess in Clara's room. And what did this mean? What had the wealthy Countess of Errol to do with these poor orphans?</p> 
                  <p>It was a wild maze of doubt and anxiety into which Rosamond wandered, and there she remained in that apartment until long after dark, plodding about in the dark mystery.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">A CONSUMMATION, AND A PROJECT.</head> 
                  <p>THREE days had passed since the disappearance of Henry Wallace, and no clue had yet been gained as to his whereabouts. Mr. Beckwith had searched, and caused search to be made all over the city, but without effect. That some piece of villany was at the bottom of all this was apparent, for the habits of the youth gave denial at once to any supposition that he would have gone away and thus remained, without sending some word to his employer.</p> 
                  <p>The old lawyer had called on Lady Landowne according to appointment, and their conference had been long and earnest. He was wary and guarded, while she was anxious and excited. He often shook his head when she wanted an answer in words, and more than once did he have to refuse peremptorily to answer her questions. Yet she blessed him when he went away, and wept long and bitterly after he had gone.</p> 
                  <p>It was evening, and Mr. Lacompte was at the house of Mr. Loman. The merchant had gone away, and Rosamond was with the countess somewhere in the country, whither they had gone the day before. Lady Landowne asked Loman if Rosamond might accompany her on a short drive into the rural districts, and he dared not refuse. So Arabella had the great drawing-room now to herself and to her own company. She had let Mr. Lacompte in herself, so none of the servants knew of his being there.</p> 
                  <p>"Divinity," uttered Alberto, with his arm about Arabella's waist, "why not this very night? O why not now, at once? Me heart can sustain itself no longer."</p> 
                  <p>"But this is so sudden," murmured the girl.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, joy must be sudden. Come, come at once. Me heart must not be crushed with more anxiety. Go with me, now. Pack up your things, and I will have me coach here when you say."</p> 
                  <p>"And must it be to-night?"</p> 
                  <p>"Unless you would kill me."</p> 
                  <p>"O Alberto, you know I would not kill you."</p> 
                  <p>"So you wont, sweet. You will be mine wife right off. I shall go now, and have the priest, and when I come with me carriage, you will be ready. Take all your jewelry and your money."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella did not yield at once, but gradually her objections gave way, and she promised to be ready as her lover requested. So Alberto went away, and Arabella went to her room to collect her things. She meant to select only such as she would want to use immediately, for she was sure she should return soon. But she had no cool thought. Her light head was so completely turned by the novelty of the thing, that the wrong she was doing never entered her mind, for she had never been taught by her father to live very strictly in truth. In fact she only felt a thrill of pride and gratification in view of the event she was anticipating, and had she been walking over the prostrate form of some dear friend, it would have mattered not to her, so that her foolish vanity was fed.</p> 
                  <p>It was just eleven o'clock when Arabella heard a light rap upon the window. It was the signal of her lover, and she went at once and opened the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Angel of love and beauty," he cried, clasping her to his bosom, "what joy is this! You are all ready?"</p> 
                  <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6097-00000015"/> 
                  <p>"Yes," she murmured.</p> 
                  <p>"Then come. Let us haste away to the bliss of heaven. Let us away at once, else some dark speerit may envy us our bliss and annoy us."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella pointed out her bundle, and Alberto took it, and in a few moments more they were in the street. The night was favorable, for 'twas dark as Egypt. At the next corner stood a carriage in waiting, and into that the maiden was assisted.</p> 
                  <p>"How happy," uttered Alberto, as the carriage rolled away.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, dearest," responded Arabella.</p> 
                  <p>Nothing more was said until they stopped, and to Arabella it seemed a long distance. But she had no fears. Her heart fluttered some as she was helped out, but 'twas only excitement. She believed she was going to be very happy.</p> 
                  <p>The house where they stopped was in a narrow street, and all the windows were dark. But then Arabella remembered that it was very late, and she did not wonder. The carriage went away, and Alberto took Arabella by the hand and led her up the steps. He rang the bell and a boy in livery came to the door. The lamp that hung in the hall shone on the gold and silver tinsel that decked the page's clothing, and the girl was in ecstasies. Had she known that this was only a son of Quaker Snap, and that the dress was one he wore when acting the page at the theatre, she would have felt differently; but she saw nothing now save the page of a princess, and already little visions of intrigue and plot floated through her mind. She wondered if she should not at some time have a very handsome page who would worship her, and who would turn out in the end to be some king in search of a wife. Another look at the gold lace which glistened upon the boy, and she saw dukes and princes at her feet, praying for one of her sweet smiles. Then she saw her dear Alberto jealous-she saw him rave and swear, and then challenge her lovers. And then came duels and blood, and all this was for the love of her!</p> 
                  <p>But she was soon called away from this little heaven by entering a room where sat two men, whom we at once recognize as Snap and Walsh. They both arose as the couple entered.</p> 
                  <p>"Dearest Arabella," said Alberto, "allow me to present you to his highness, Battledore de Flamdowne, Duke of Normandy."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella bowed with a gracious condescension, and Mr. Nanny Walsh extended his hand excruciatingly.</p> 
                  <p>"And now," continued Alberto, "I will present you to his grace, Villefetoe de Gastrinovo, Archbishop of Narboune."</p> 
                  <p>Quaker Snap bowed with austere dignity, and Arabella felt a slight degree of awe creeping through her as she took the hand of the high ecclesiastical dignitary.</p> 
                  <p>"And now," continued Alberto, "let the ceremony go on. You will see, my sweet, that I wanted no common priest at our nuptials. Do you speak French?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, love."</p> 
                  <p>"Not at all?"</p> 
                  <p>"No."</p> 
                  <p>"I must learn it to you. Pierre."</p> 
                  <p>The page from the ball came in, and looked into Lacompte's face.</p> 
                  <p>"Pierre," said Lacompte, "je vous fare ring tum, fido, ambissimus totum."</p> 
                  <p>"Qui," said the boy.</p> 
                  <p>"Feteo bombauticum, slappo fajee lumba etessimus doflatum eat."</p> 
                  <p>"Qui," repeated the boy.</p> 
                  <p>"Papslebo vat fifutu tantribogus highbobflatcho!"</p> 
                  <p>And as Alberto thus spoke, he waved his hand majestically, and the boy retired.</p> 
                  <p>"What a beautiful language," said Arabella.</p> 
                  <p>"You must learn it, sweet. I shall devote all my skill to your perfect attainment, for when we reach our own native Frawnce, you must speak <foreign>a la Franswar</foreign>."</p> 
                  <p>"How delightful!"</p> 
                  <p>"But come. The archbishop waits."</p> 
                  <p>Arabella blushed some when she stood by Alberto's side, and saw the archbishop all ready to marry her, but she bore herself well. She answered the questions promptly and frankly, and in a few short moments she was pronounced "Lady Arabella Lacompte."</p> 
                  <p>After this, wine was brought in, and when the cup had passed around, Alberto took his bride by the hand and led her from the room. The hall was not very fashionably furnished, nor were the stairs. Upon the second floor Lacompte stopped before a door and opened it. Beyond was a chamber handsomely furnished, and within it were two girls.</p> 
                  <p>"Lady Lacompte," said Alberto, "these are your attendants for the present. They will attend to your wants, and obey you in all things. Adele, this is your mistress. Marie, this is my lady. And now, love, you must excuse me for a while, for I have business."</p> 
                  <p>He kissed her hand as he spoke, and then turned from the room. Arabella was too much pleased with this commencement to exhibit any of her haughtiness, and she was very condescending. Had she known the exact character of the girls, she might not have felt so easy in their presence, but as long as they were to do her no real harm, perhaps 'twas as well that they were not fully known. It was easy for them to obey the young lady, but 'twas hard for them to maintain their gravity. There was something so ludicrous in her allusions to "my lord," and "my lord the count," that they came nigh losing themselves.</p> 
                  <p>Meanwhile, Lacompte had joined his companions, and locked the door behind him. Several matters of importance to themselves were talked over, and by-and-by they came upon one in which we have some interest.</p> 
                  <p>"Now," said Lacompte, "this young Wallace and his sister must be moved out of the city at once. I have taken my solemn oath that they were out, and that they shall not return."</p> 
                  <p>"But where'll you carry 'em?" asked Walsh, laconically.</p> 
                  <p>"That's the thing of it. If I was sure of pay enough, I should be almost tempted to take 'em out to sea."</p> 
                  <p>"How far?"</p> 
                  <p>"Anywhere off from soundings."</p> 
                  <p>"Dump 'em, eh?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>"But that wouldn't pay."</p> 
                  <p>"Hark ye," spoke the Quaker. "Let us get these children out of the city first. There is an excellent place for them up river a few miles, and there we can board them as long as we are paid well. After that, if their removal becomes necessary, we can dump 'em, as thee is pleased to term it. I allude to the snug, quiet little place of Timothy McDougal's."</p> 
                  <p>"A capital place," cried Walsh.</p> 
                  <p>"That will be the best, now, surely," added Lacompte. "And now how shall we get 'em up there?"</p> 
                  <p>"Easily enough. Take 'em to-morrow night. We can gag them if they want to be noisy, and then slip over to the Jersey shore and there take a coach up."</p> 
                  <p>"Then let it be so," resumed Lacompte. "As soon as they are out of the city we are safe, and we can afford to keep 'em both at Tim's, for-how much?"</p> 
                  <p>"Say twenty dollars a week," said the Quaker.</p> 
                  <p>"That'll go it," added Walsh.</p> 
                  <p>"Very well," said Lacompte. "And to-morrow night we do it. We'll meet here at dark, and in the meanwhile I'll see Mrs. O'Brady, and have all ready in that quarter."</p> 
                  <p>"By the way, Brown, how did you pick up that woman?"</p> 
                  <p>"What woman?"</p> 
                  <p>"O'Brady."</p> 
                  <p>"O, 'twas a funny circumstance. I'll tell you. You see, one night when I had rather more of the ardent aboard than I could well manage under, I strayed away down in her neighborhood, and fell asleep on her steps. When I awoke up it was just sunrise. I heard a racket close by somewhere, and found 'twas in the groggery on the corner. In I went, and found two stout men, trying to beat the woman that kept the place. I was just crazy enough not to care what happened to me, and I made a spring at one of the fellows and knocked him senseless. Before the other could get at me, I had a heavy club secured, and one tap on his pate laid him out too. I looked out for the rascals while the woman went for a policeman, or watchman. They were both lugged off, and then Mrs. O'Brady, for she was the woman, began to pour out her Irish thanks in any quantity. I took something to drink, and felt better. She fried me some eggs, and I felt better still; and since that she's been a handy sort of a friend. And she can afford to, for I've paid her a good deal of money at one time and another."</p> 
                  <p>"So that's it, eh?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. That's the way I became acquainted with Mrs. O'Brady."</p> 
                  <p>"And do you think her perfectly safe?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do, certainly. And there is a peculiarity in her disposition. She is like an Indian. She can be as ugly as you please, and is naturally mean and grasping, and hard with those who deal with her; but she never forgets a favor. Do her a real, disinterested kindness, and she'll do anything for you, even lend you money."</p> 
                  <p>"Now," said the Quaker, "we'll off to bed. Your bride will be waiting for you, Brown."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no," uttered the individual addressed. "I go no further with her at present. I'm villain enough, I know, but I wont utterly ruin a poor thing like her without any object. But I'll bring the old 'un to terms. I'll open his purse for him."</p> 
                  <p>The other two laughed at the idea, and shortly afterwards they separated for the night.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE IRON CROSS, AND ITS STARTLING POWER.</head> 
                  <p>ON the morning following the strange marriage of Arabella Loman, Clara was in the same room where we last found her. She arose very late, for she was weak and weary, and sleep refreshed her but little. The rose had all gone from her cheeks, and those cheeks were sunken and ashy. The light of her eyes was yet deep, but their sparkling was gone, and the falling away of the flesh gave them a darker, heavier look. There were no signs of weeping now on her face, but a deep, unmitigated expression of sadness and woe overspread every feature, and the lines of suffering were already drawn deeply upon her brow. She arose from her lowly couch, but she felt not strong enough to dress yet. There was a strange languor in her system, and with a low moan she sank down upon a chair.</p> 
                  <p>Thus she sat when the bolts of her door were withdrawn, and soon afterwards Mrs. O'Brady entered with her breakfast.</p> 
                  <p>"Here, miss, is your breakfast," the woman said, as she set the small waiter down upon the table.</p> 
                  <p>The breakfast consisted of a dry roll, a piece of cheese, and a cup of muddy-looking coffee. The poor girl looked upon it, and her stomach sickened.</p> 
                  <p>"Mrs. O'Brady," she said, in a low, beseeching tone, "I am not well. Can you not give me something beside this, this morning?"</p> 
                  <p>"An' what else would ye have?"</p> 
                  <p>"Let me have a few eggs."</p> 
                  <p>"Mercy, child, 'twould take a fortune to feed ye so."</p> 
                  <p>"But only this morning. O, I am not well."</p> 
                  <p>The woman looked first upon the food, and then upon the pale, sunken face of the poor girl, and at length she said in a tone less severe than she was wont to use:</p> 
                  <p>"Well, you just try and see what you can do with it. I've got another breakfast to get, an' when I come back, we'll see what ye's done."</p> 
                  <p>With this, the woman left the room, carefully bolting the door after her. Clara tasted the coffee, but it did not meet her palate with any grateful effect. The bread she could not eat, and she did not touch it. In half an hour, Mrs. O'Brady came back, and a look of displeasure rested upon her coarse features when she saw the food untouched.</p> 
                  <p>"Can't ye eat it?" she said.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed I cannot"</p> 
                  <p>"Au' why aint ye dressed?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am weak and faint."</p> 
                  <p>"Well," said the woman, with an expression which evinced that she had arrived at the conclusion with difficulty, "seein' as this is your last day here, I'll do it for ye."</p> 
                  <p>"My last day here!" uttered Clara, starting.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. Ye'll lave here to night."</p> 
                  <p>"Where-where-am I going?"</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know."</p> 
                  <p>"O mercy!" groaned the poor girl, covering her face with her hands. But she did not weep, for grief had drawn its last tear away. "Where will they carry me?"</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot tell ye, miss, for they tell me none o' their secrets."</p> 
                  <p>"But I am still to be confined?"</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps so."</p> 
                  <p>Now the woman knew all about it, but she chose not to speak all she knew; and in this she was actuated by no other motive than to avoid seeing the girl suffer more than she could help. But before Clara could ask any more questions the woman left the room.</p> 
                  <p>"My God!" gasped the stricken girl, starting to her feet, "what shall become of me now? O death, thou art welcome to come to me! And yet-I would see my brother once more. Henry! Henry! We may never meet again!"</p> 
                  <p>Again she sank back into her chair, and her hand dropped. Her garments-her gown-lay upon the chair by her side, but she noticed it not. The thought of being dragged from her present place was a new source of pain, and under its influence the room where she had been confined so long wore something of the home aspect, and even the coarse, animal face of Mrs. O'Brady seemed pleasant compared with the dread uncertainty which awaited her. She had heard enough at one time and another, since she had been in her present apartment, to assure her that she was kept out of the way for the interest of some powerful person, and if such were the case, then her removal from thence could only be for the purpose of a more safe confinement.</p> 
                  <p>Another half hour passed, and Clara had just arisen to put on her gown, having already unhooked the bosom of her night robe, when Mrs. O'Brady entered.</p> 
                  <p>"Here, miss, are the eggs; and I've brought ye a bit of good nice wine, for I know ye need more strength if ye's to be moved this night, which ye surely are."</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you-thank you, kindly," murmured the poor girl, turning to the table where the woman had set the things down.</p> 
                  <p>"And, d'ye mind, here's a nice cake, too, to soak wid the wine," continued Mrs. O'Brady, as she pointed out a piece of sponge cake.</p> 
                  <p>Clara sipped some of the wine, and even the first few drops seemed to revive her. Then she sat down by the table and took up one of the eggs, and commenced to break off the shell.</p> 
                  <p>"Faix, but I'm tired," uttered Mrs. O'Brady, sitting down opposite to her. "I've been runnin' all the mornin'. How is the eggs? Does it suit you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Very well, ma'am."</p> 
                  <p>The thought that the poor girl was so soon to leave her seemed to make the old woman more kind than was her wont, for her features were considerably softened.</p> 
                  <p>"Sure," she resumed, "you've been a meek, mild creature since you've been here."</p> 
                  <p>"And I have done you no wrong, I hope," returned Clara, reaching for another egg.</p> 
                  <p>As she did this, the bosom of her robe was opened, and a portion of her fair, white breast was exposed, and resting upon it, Mrs. O'Brady saw a piece of faded blue ribbon.</p> 
                  <p>"Is that some keepsake ye carry there?" she asked. "Niver fear that I shall hurt it."</p> 
                  <p>Clara slipped the ribbon over her head and handed it to her hostess. The woman took it, and her fingers trembled; and anon the tremulousness extended to the whole of her thick, burly frame.</p> 
                  <p>"Did ye come honestly by this?" she asked, looking up into Clara's face with a strange expression.</p> 
                  <p>"Surely I did," returned the girl, her curiosity being now aroused.</p> 
                  <p>Again the old woman looked eagerly upon the cross. She turned it over in her fingers, and examined it carefully in every part.</p> 
                  <p>"Who put this mark here?" she at length asked, pointing to a deep scratch, which bore some resemblance to the letter "M."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know. It was there when I received it."</p> 
                  <p>"And who gave it to ye?"</p> 
                  <p>"My mother."</p> 
                  <p>"Your own mother?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>"But you don't know where she got it?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. It was the gift of one whose life she saved."</p> 
                  <p>"Do ye know that?"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly, for my mother told me so."</p> 
                  <p>"She saved somebody from drowning, eh?"</p> 
                  <p>"No ma'am. She saved her out of a burning building, at the risk of her own life."</p> 
                  <p>"Surely, she was a noble woman," muttered Mrs. O'Brady, gazing fixedly into the girl's face.</p> 
                  <p>"She was a good woman," uttered Clara.</p> 
                  <p>Upon this the old woman arose and started across the room. Several times she passed up and down the place, and then came and sat down again.</p> 
                  <p>"Clara," she said; "that is a very strange tale you've told me." And again her small, bloodshot eyes were fixed searchingly upon the maiden's face.</p> 
                  <p>"It is true, nevertheless," the girl replied.</p> 
                  <p>"But, Miss Clara, what would ye think if I should tell ye that this cross was mine?"</p> 
                  <p>The maiden started in surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Yours?</emph>" she uttered.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-<emph>mine.</emph>"</p> 
                  <p>"And did you lose it?" Clara asked, breathlessly.</p> 
                  <p>"No-<emph>I gave it away</emph>."</p> 
                  <p>"Gave it-away-"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. I gave it to a noble, kind-souled woman, who saved my life. It was all I had in the world to give. It was a charmed cross. My own mother gave it to me, and she told me the holy saints had blessed it. I gave it to the woman, an' told her to wear it, and to give it to her children when she died. And I told her too, that if ever a chick or child of mine met that cross, he'd help its owner if there was power and need. She promised she would keep it as I asked her."</p> 
                  <p>Clara had started forward when the woman began to speak, but she sank back now. Many conflicting emotions warred in her bosom, and she trembled like an aspen.</p> 
                  <p>"And d'ye know," the woman returned, "'at ye look like ye noble mother? I can see it now."</p> 
                  <p>A moment Clara gazed into her companion's face, and then she started forward and sank down upon her knees, and clasped her hands upon the woman's knees.</p> 
                  <p>"O," she uttered, "can you not now remember the daughter for the mother's sake?"</p> 
                  <p>"Get up-get up, miss," cried the woman vehemently. "By the holy mother, the man doesn't live who can say that Molly O'Brady-that's my 'M' scratched on the cross-that Molly O'Brady ever forgot a kindness. Sure I'm a miserable thing, and the hardness of the world has made me what I am; but there's one spot in me bosom that remembrance of kindness can touch. By the blessed host and all the holy angels, was't me own father that held ye, I'd set ye free!"</p> 
                  <p>"Free! free!" cried Clara. "O, and shall I be free?"</p> 
                  <p>"By the blessed virgin, ye shall!"</p> 
                  <p>"O, bless-"</p> 
                  <p>But the poor girl's heart was too full. The fountain which had refused tears at the beck of grief, now opened its flood, and she wept with her face bid in the old woman's lap.</p> 
                  <p>"Get up, Clara Wallace. Your mother was not so old as you are when she saved my life and soul; and her name wasn't Wallace then. I remember how she blushed when I told her to give the cross to her children. But, get up. There; now brush away your tears, for I've got more to tell ye."</p> 
                  <p>Clara arose to her feet, and set down in her chair, and as soon as she could brush her tears away, she looked up into her companion's face.</p> 
                  <p>"You have a brother?" said the Irishwoman.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-Henry," answered Clara.</p> 
                  <p>"And your enemies are his enemies?"</p> 
                  <p>"Has evil befallen him?" the girl quickly asked.</p> 
                  <p>"The same that has befallen you."</p> 
                  <p>"Speak-tell me all. I can hear it."</p> 
                  <p>"He's here in my house."</p> 
                  <p>"A prisoner?"</p> 
                  <p>Clara started half up, and then sank back again. The little blood that found its way to her face fell back, and a new tremor seized her.</p> 
                  <p>"You are frightened," said the hostess, inquiringly.</p>

                  </p> 
                  <p>"O, what harm has come to Henry?" the poor girl asked.</p> 
                  <p>"No more than to yourself."</p> 
                  <p>"And you will save him?"</p> 
                  <p>"Of course. He is your mother's child."</p> 
                  <p>Clara bowed her head, but she did not weep. A sudden impulse seized her, and springing up, she caught the old woman by the arm.</p> 
                  <p>"Lead me to him," she cried. "Lead me to my brother. O, you will not refuse me!"</p> 
                  <p>"Wouldn't it be just as well to bring him here?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, yes-only let me see him."</p> 
                  <p>"In a moment. But now we must think some over this. When you go, I shall have enemies. The men who brought you here will be ravin' when they find ye's both gone. I must study up some plot. But I'll have it in time. Easy, now, Miss Clara. Here, take the cross, and when ye have chicks of yer own, ye'll give it to 'em, and tell 'em its story."</p> 
                  <p>"I will-I will."</p> 
                  <p>"Then wait here. Be easy now, and don't make a noise. You wont leave the room?"</p> 
                  <p>Clara promised, and with a quick, heavy shuffle, Molly O'Brady left the apartment.</p>

                  <p>POOR Clara! She hardly knew how to look on the strange things that had so suddenly come on her. Even yet she could not fully realize that she was to see her brother, or that she was to go free. She looked on the little iron cross, and then pressed it to her lips; and to God she prayed there might come no disappointment with this cup.</p> 
                  <p>And where was Henry all this while? In the same room where we last saw him. The place was not wholly dark, nor was it very light. There was a window in the apartment, but it only opened into another room. Henry sat on the edge of his bed engaged in reading an old Bible. He had changed some, but not so much as his sister, for a spirit of deep indignation had kept him up. While he sat thus his door was opened, and Mrs. O'Brady entered.</p> 
                  <p>"How now, woman?" the youth asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Easy, sir," said the woman. "I am come to do ye no harm."</p> 
                  <p>"Then why didn't you open the wicket as you usually do?"</p> 
                  <p>He alluded to the little slide near the door, through which his hostess was in the habit of putting his food.</p> 
                  <p>"I opened your door, sir, so that ye might follow me out if ye'd a mind to."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah," uttered the youth, energetically, for the first time noticing the change that had come o'er the face of the old woman. "What mean ye?"</p> 
                  <p>"Follow me, and ye shall see."</p> 
                  <p>Henry started up and his keeper turned towards the door. Somehow his heart beat more freely, and a dim light broke in upon him. The woman did not act nor speak like one who meant evil. He followed her through a long passage, but when she came to ascend a steep flight of stairs, he stopped.</p> 
                  <p>"Are ye afeared?" the guide asked.</p> 
                  <p>"But why go up?"</p> 
                  <p>"Follow me, and you shall see."</p> 
                  <p>"But wherefore? By heavens I fear all is-"</p> 
                  <p>"Then back to your room, Henry Wallace, Faix, an' if ye's afeared of a woman-"</p> 
                  <p>"Go on, go on. I'll follow."</p> 
                  <p>So up the crazy, rickety stairs they went, and when they had reached the top, the woman advanced a few paces and opened a door just like the one which had been shut upon the youth.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha," he uttered, as he saw the stout, bolted plank, "you mean to change my prison, eh?"</p> 
                  <p>"Look in and see. Look in, Henry Wallace."</p> 
                  <p>"Henry! Henry!" came in quick, low notes from the room.</p> 
                  <p>The youth started forward as he heard that voice. He stopped on the threshold, and he saw before him a female form; there was a quick cry, a low moan of agonizing joy-and the next moment the brother and sister were clasped in each other's arms. The old woman saw them thus, and with a tear in her eye she turned away from the place and closed the door after her. It was the first tear she had shed for many a day.</p> 
                  <p>"O," murmured Henry, still holding his sister to his bosom, and looking down into her face, "this moment is a recompense for all the past. Clara, sister-you are not-you are still my sister?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-yes-Henry."</p> 
                  <p>"And are not harmed?"</p> 
                  <p>The maiden met the eager, agonizing look of suspense that rested on her brother's face, and she quickly knew his meaning.</p> 
                  <p>"No, no, Henry," she cried. "I am not harmed. O, your sister's kiss is pure-her embrace is as holy as when we stood by our dying mother's bed. Heaven itself is not more free of stain."</p> 
                  <p>"Blessings, blessings for this, my sister. O, the darkest cloud is rolled away and light cometh now."</p> 
                  <p>There were more words spoken-words such as their frenzy of joyful affection dictated-and by-the-by they sat down together, the sister on her brother's knee, and still leaning on his bosom.</p> 
                  <p>"And now, Clara, how came you here?" the youth asked. "O, you cannot know what I suffered when I knew that you were gone. But tell me how you came here?"</p> 
                  <p>"When I left you on that fatal evening," returned the maiden, with a quick shudder, "I found a woman at the door, or what I then sup posed was a woman. She asked me if my name was Clara Wallace. I told her it was. Then she asked me if I had a brother Henry; and I told her yes. 'Well,' she said, 'I have a letter for him,' and as she spoke, she stepped down to the arch where the gas light was, and asked me to come. I saw her feeling in her pocket, and of course I suspected no danger. I stepped towards her, and the moment I reached the arch I heard a movement behind me, but before I could turn to see what it was, a thick cloth of some kind was thrown over my head, and in a moment more I was lifted from my feet and borne away. I could not cry out, nor could I get away from the strong hands that held me. Soon I was placed in a carriage, and then driven away at a rapid rate. When the bandage was removed from my mouth and eyes, I found myself in this room, and here I have been ever since."</p> 
                  <p>"And do you know who brought you here?" asked Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. It was Alberto Lacompte-or Gustavus Brown, as he sometimes calls himself."</p> 
                  <p>"The tall, black-whiskered man?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, he wears any kind of whiskers he pleases, and sometimes a mustache. He was here the other evening, and dropped a pair which I picked up the next morning. He must have pulled them out with his handkerchief. I have not seen him since, so I have kept them."</p> 
                  <p>"Had you ever seen him before?"</p> 
                  <p>"Once, at Mr. Loman's."</p> 
                  <p>"And what was his reason for his conduct?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why, he professed that it was love for me; but I knew better."</p> 
                  <p>"Sometimes," answered Clara, with a fearful shudder, "I have thought that Mr. Loman had some hand in it. But, but-it seems almost impossible."</p> 
                  <p>"So have I thought, Clara, only I have seen no impossibility in it, for I believe him capable of anything that can minister to his passions. The only thing that puzzles me is, why he should have done it. But even here, I can see a glimmer of probability at least. He may have done it to prevent my seeing Rosamond."</p> 
                  <p>"O, good Rosamond, Have you seen her?"</p> 
                  <p>"Often, sister."</p> 
                  <p>"And was she sorry, when I was gone?"</p> 
                  <p>"Sorry? Ah, Clara, you do not yet know all the noble purity and deep soul of that fair girl. She wept, wept bitterly when you were gone. You are a sister to her, and for you she feels a sister's love."</p> 
                  <p>"God bless her!" fervently ejaculated Clara, brushing a tear from her eye. "And yet," she added, after a pause, "Mr. Loman could have had no reason for doing this to me."</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot see that he had. It is a dark, mysterious thing; Clara. But we may know yet. But this Lacompte, what was he doing at Mr. Loman's?"</p> 
                  <p>"Passing himself off as a French count."</p> 
                  <p>"I have a strange suspicion of that man, sister. I-but those whiskers-let me see them."</p> 
                  <p>Clara arose and went to the table, and from the little drawer she took the piece in question and handed it to her brother. It was a pair of coarse, heavy whiskers, evidently made of common curled hair, and neatly stitched to a piece of black silk. Henry examined it carefully, and on one side he found a place where a piece had gone. The silk had been torn, leaving a foundation, which was of coarse, woolen stuff, bare, and a piece about two inches long and an inch wide, was missing. But the thick hair of the adjoining parts lapped over sufficiently to hide the tent at a short distance.</p> 
                  <p>"Clara," spoke the youth, with a low, meaning emphasis, "I have the piece which came out of this!"</p> 
                  <p>"You, Henry?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, and my suspicions are now well founded. Mr. Alberto Lacompte is the man that did that murder. I am sure of it!"</p> 
                  <p>"And is the watch-seal his?" asked Clara, in astonishment.</p> 
                  <p>"I surely took it from him. I saw him in my room when I was first brought here, and there was another man with him. The latter man I recognized by his voice to be the one who called at the office and tried to get the seal. I only had a glimpse of a few moments at Lacompte, for the light was soon extinguished, but I recognized him even then. But now I am sure. You know I told you I had a piece of a false whisker which I pulled from the face of the murderer, and I know that piece belongs to this whisker."</p> 
                  <p>"And do you think that this man can be a son of the countess?" asked the fair girl.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know what to think," returned Henry, with a dubious, troubled expression. "By my soul, it is all dark to me-everything. We both of us seem to move in mystic darkness. We know not why we are moved as we are, and we know not what the end of those things is to be."</p> 
                  <p>"Alas," murmured Clara, "we are children of misfortune!"</p> 
                  <p>"Not altogether, my sister. But yet our lot has been hard in some respects. I wonder if-"</p> 
                  <p>Before he could finish the sentence, the door of the room was opened, and the huge rotundity of Mrs. O'Brady appeared in the way.</p> 
                  <p>"Now have ye's got through wid yer kissin' an' cryin'?" she uttered, with a kindly look breaking through the coarseness of her face.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," answered Henry, "for the present."</p> 
                  <p>"Then ye'd better be movin', for I don't know when they'll be here after ye's. An' I've thought of a way to do it. I've locked up my shop, an' now we'll go to your room, sir, an' ye'll lock me in, an' thin you and yer sister can go as soon as ye please. D'ye understand if ye do this, then, whin they come, I'll tell 'em that I went into yer room, an' yer knocked me down and run an' bolted the door after, eh?"</p> 
                  <p>Henry understood her meaning at once. He saw that she feared to give direct offence to the men who had employed her, and hence she meant to deceive them by making them think that the prisoners had escaped in spite of her.</p> 
                  <p>So the old woman led the way, and both Henry and Clara followed. When they reached the room where the youth had been confined they entered it, and here Mrs. O'Brady spoke again.</p> 
                  <p>"Now go," she said, "an' be sure that ye bolt this door after ye. When ye reach the street, ye'll see a little dirty boy there. Tell him Mrs. O'Brady wants to see him up stairs. Whin he comes up, I'll cry out wid all my might, an' he'll come an' let me out. Thin, d'ye see, I'll have ividence that ye locked me in-that ye thin went an' set yer sister free, an' then run."</p> 
                  <p>"God will bless you for this," uttered Clara, with emphasis.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, and we, too, will bless and pray for you," added Henry.</p> 
                  <p>"I believe ye, but don't stop now. Only remember that I've done ye no harm. If I hadn't took ye's, they'd made somebody else do it, an' thin ye's fared worse. Mind ye, I've kept me faith wid yer mother-God rest her soul. An' ye'll niver lose the iron cross, for sure it's a charmed thing. Now go. Don't stop now another minute, for ye know not whin they'll come."</p> 
                  <p>Henry saw that the woman was anxious they should be gone, as well for her own sake as theirs, and taking his sister by the hand, he turned away from the place where he had passed so many agonizing hours. He found the front entry without difficulty, and sliding back the bolt of the door, he threw it open and was soon in the street. A little ragged boy sat upon the doorsteps, and to him Henry turned.</p> 
                  <p>"Boy, do you know Mrs. O'Brady?"</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know nothing else," was the characteristic answer.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, I guess she would like to see you up stairs. Maybe she's got something for you."</p> 
                  <p>"Sumthink for me? Ge-crickee!"</p> 
                  <p>With this the urchin started up the steps, while Henry, drawing his sister's arm close within his own, set off at a quick pace towards the upper part of the city.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">UNWELCOME VISITORS.</head> 
                  <p>LATER in the day, and we find Mr. Loman alone in the large drawing-room of his house. He was pacing to and fro, and his face showed that he was deeply moved. Arabella had not been seen since the evening before, and none could tell where she had gone. The parent had made every inquiry where probability could turn, but nothing of his lost child could he hear. There were other things, too, that weighed upon his mind-things that made him shake with fear and dread. For many nights he had slept but little, and even by day when he would bury his mind in business if he could, the spectres haunted him.</p> 
                  <p>Thus was he still pacing the floor, when a servant announced Alberto Lacompte. The merchant started as he heard that name, but he ordered the servant to admit him. The visitor bowed very low, as he entered. He was dressed in the height of fashion, and his bearing was easy and assured.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, friend Loman, how do you find yourself to-day?" he asked, at the same time taking a seat.</p> 
                  <p>"Be not too familiar, sir," uttered the merchant, sharply. "You presume too much on the casual acquaintance that exists between us. But what of the boy and girl?"</p> 
                  <p>"They are safe."</p> 
                  <p>"Out of the city, you told me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir."</p> 
                  <p>"How far?"</p> 
                  <p>"So far that you shall not be troubled with them again so long as you pay their board. And now, my dear sir, how about the pay? A few hundreds would come very handy, just now."</p> 
                  <p>"Look ye, Lacompte," uttered the merchant, looking the follow sternly in the face, "have you not already helped yourself to a part of your pay?"</p> 
                  <p>"Me, sir? Speak more plainly."</p> 
                  <p>"How about my sliver plats and gold spoons, and so forth?"</p> 
                  <p>"Really, sir, you are facetious. I shall have to ask you to speak more plainly still."</p> 
                  <p>"Then, sir, did you go to my closet and take away a lot of my plate?"</p> 
                  <p>"John Loman, had another man asked that question, I should not deign to answer it, but I will answer you by simply saying no!"</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose I shall have to take your word."</p> 
                  <p>"You can do as you please about that, sir. I am prepared for anything."</p> 
                  <p>"Let it pass. I think you stole them, though."</p> 
                  <p>"And is that the extent of your confidence in a French nobleman?"</p> 
                  <p>"Don't fool, sir. If I called you count, in order to pass you off before my children, you will not presume upon it now. And by the way, sir,<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6097-00000017"/> have you seen or heard anything of Arabella?"</p> 
                  <p>"Of the beautiful maiden I have seen here, you mean?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>"Let the other part of our business be settled first. I want three hundred dollars."</p> 
                  <p>"But you have my note for a thousand."</p> 
                  <p>"Very well. I'll endorse it, if you say so."</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot spare that sum, now. I have not over two hundred with me."</p> 
                  <p>"Then give me what you have."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no sir. You have no right to push me-"</p> 
                  <p>"Oho, very well. If that's the case, I'll give you back your note, and raise the money elsewhere. There's a gentleman just around who will give me double that amount for my charge."</p> 
                  <p>"What do you mean?" asked the merchant, turning pale.</p> 
                  <p>"Captain John Beckwith has returned-his ship came in yesterday morning-and I hear he is half crazy about a certain girl he once loved."</p> 
                  <p>"You will not turn traitor-you will not betray me?"</p> 
                  <p>"And I hear, too," resumed Lacompte, without seeming to take any notice of this last utterance, "that suspicion is turned this way."</p> 
                  <p>"Ha?"</p> 
                  <p>"That keen scented old lawyer has his eyes fixed on you, sir. He has been closeted with a certain countess."</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens, sir, if you do betray me-"</p> 
                  <p>"Stop, John Loman. You know I will not break my pledge so long as you keep yours. But I do need three hundred dollars."</p> 
                  <p>"I will try to spare them. I have some in my pocket which is not really mine; but if you are really in want, I must run the risk of sparing it, I suppose."</p> 
                  <p>As the merchant spoke, he drew forth his pocket-book, and with trembling fingers he counted out the three hundred dollars. Lacompte received them with a calm assurance, and when he had rolled up the notes and put them in his pocket, he turned to the merchant and said:</p> 
                  <p>"Now, sir, I am ready for the next business."</p> 
                  <p>"I asked you concerning my child, Arabella," said Loman, as soon as he could appear perfectly calm.</p> 
                  <p>"And what would you know of her?"</p> 
                  <p>"If you had seen her?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have."</p> 
                  <p>"Ha! When?"</p> 
                  <p>"Last night."</p> 
                  <p>"Where, sir?"</p> 
                  <p>"On my bosom, sir. The adored Arabella is my wife."</p> 
                  <p>John Loman started forward with his flats clenched, but he did not touch the man before him. At first his face turned red as fire, but soon the blood all left it, and he was pale as death.</p> 
                  <p>"Your wife!" he gasped.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir. We were married last night."</p> 
                  <p>"Villain! traitor! scoundrel!"</p> 
                  <p>"-ah, my dear father; that is not the way to receive a son-in-law."</p> 
                  <p>"Rascal! you lie to me! Arabella would not have stooped so low."</p> 
                  <p>"Stooped, sir. Did she stoop in marrying a count."</p> 
                  <p>"She knew you were not a count."</p> 
                  <p>"How should she know? You yourself introduced me as a count."</p> 
                  <p>"And have you visited here since, under that guise?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes sir. I have been quite free here."</p> 
                  <p>"Fool-dolt-idiot-"</p> 
                  <p>"Do you mean me, sir?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, myself!"</p> 
                  <p>"Upon my soul, you are honest."</p> 
                  <p>The merchant measured the frame of the villain with his eye, and then he started across the room. For awhile he was almost frantic with rage and mortification, and yet he had not begun to blame himself. He knew that he had himself introduced Lacompte to his daughter as a French count, but he had only done that so as to cover up his real character; for the reader may now know that when Loman first brought Lacompte to his house, he did it so that he might see and know the poor girl whom he was to take away, and in order to hide all possibility of suspicion, he had favored the story of his courtship. It will be remembered that on the evening of that visit, Clara was called into the room, ostensibly to fix the lamp, but really that Lacompte might mark her.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, come, sir," said Lacompte, as the merchant approached him, "there is no use in going on in this way. You wont make matters any better by raving and foaming about it."</p> 
                  <p>"O villain!" groaned the stricken man.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, he easy."</p> 
                  <p>"Silence, dog!"</p> 
                  <p>Lacompte was on the point of replying, when the servant again put her head into the room.</p> 
                  <p>"Lady Landowne and a gentleman."</p> 
                  <p>"Show 'em in," said Lacompte-and before the merchant could recover himself sufficiently to counteract the order, the servant had gone.</p> 
                  <p>"Leave the room, sir," he said to Lacompte. "Off, at once! Here, out by this door."</p> 
                  <p>"O no. I should like to see this lady, and I guess I'll stop."</p> 
                  <p>John Loman was almost ready to burst with passion, and yet he had to be calm, for Lady Landowne's step was close to the door. He took a turn down the room, and when he came back, the lady had entered.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, madam, this is an honor," uttered the host, extending his hand.</p> 
                  <p>Matilda Landowne took the proffered hand, but she shuddered perceptibly when she did so.</p> 
                  <p>Next the merchant saw her gaze fixed upon Lacompte. He thought it would seem very strange if he did not introduce him, and he did so. The fellow arose with all the assurance in the world, but his countenance fell when he met the woman's gaze.</p> 
                  <p>"Have we not met before, Mr. Lacompte?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Really, madam, I-I-think not," stammered he.</p> 
                  <p>A moment more the lady gazed into his face, but she evidently failed to call her acquaintance to mind, and then she turned towards her host.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Loman," she said, "let me present our mutual friend, Captain Beckwith."</p> 
                  <p>The merchant started at the sound of that name, but he managed to receive the man very becomingly, though it was evident his composure was fast leaving him.</p> 
                  <p>Joseph Beckwith was a fine-looking young man, not over seven-and-twenty years of age, tall and well-formed, with light brown ringlets, waving about a high, open brow, and with a countenance as marked in its benevolence and truth, as it was in its manly beauty.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Loman," he said, "you will pardon me for this uninvited visit, but a matter of deep interest to me has called me here."</p> 
                  <p>"No excuse, sir, I beg," uttered Loman. And then, as though he would put off the captain's business if he could, he turned to Lady Landowne and asked:</p> 
                  <p>"Have you just returned, madam?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir."</p> 
                  <p>"And Rosamond-where is she?"</p> 
                  <p>"She came with me, sir, and has gone up to her room. She will be down presently."</p> 
                  <p>"And did you enjoy your visit?"</p> 
                  <p>"Much, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"You were gone longer than I had expected."</p> 
                  <p>"We had some business to do, sir."</p> 
                  <p>As the countess thus spoke, she looked the merchant so sharply and strangely in the face, that he shrank with fear.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Loman," spoke Beckwith, "I had a talk with my father this morning, and he informed me that Miss Clara Wallace had been residing here with you."</p> 
                  <p>"She did make it her home here, sir," returned the merchant, turning first pale and then red.</p> 
                  <p>"And where is she now, sir?"</p> 
                  <p>"How should I know?"</p> 
                  <p>"But do you not know, sir?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, I do not Did your father send you here on this errand?"</p> 
                  <p>"No sir, he did not. I have not seen him since early morning. This lady, sir, and your daughter, called at the hotel to see him, but they found only me. The meeting with Rosamond was pleasant, and I should have been all joy had it not been for this blow."</p> 
                  <p>"But why did you come here, sir? Why here?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because this was the last place in which the girl was known to be."</p> 
                  <p>"And were you her keeper?" asked Loman, unable longer to control his cowardly anger.</p> 
                  <p>At this moment Rosamond entered.</p> 
                  <p>"She was to me, sir, the light of my life-the star of my hope-the beacon of my life-voyage. Now tell me if you know anything of her?"</p> 
                  <p>"No-nor do I wish to. Madam," the merchant continued, turning to the countess, "did you know why this man was coming here?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir," calmly answered she.</p> 
                  <p>"Why did you not tell him that I knew nothing of the matter?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because I was not sure that such was the fact."</p> 
                  <p>"You had heard me say so," said the merchant, coloring."</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, but that was some time since."</p> 
                  <p>"Then let me repeat the assertion again-I know nothing at all about the girl, nor shall I endeavor to learn anything about her. I do not choose to hunt up every runaway servant."</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Loman," spoke the captain, biting his lips hard, "you are in your own house, or I might give you the epithet you richly merit."</p> 
                  <p>During this time Rosamond had been looking around her with strange emotions. She could have pitied her father, had she not now felt sure of his guilt. She wondered why Mr. Lacompte was present, and she also felt curious to know why those quick, furtive glances were passed so often between that foppish individual and the countess. Once or twice she felt inclined to leave the room, but a feeling of curiosity kept her back. Here was a peculiar situation. There stood her father-she saw the anger marks dark and deep upon his face, and she knew that he was suffering much, yet she could only pity him. She remembered one whom she had loved as her own soul-one in whom all her hopes of the future were centered-and she knew that her father was his enemy.</p> 
                   
                  <p>Mr. Loman had turned upon the young captain a look of deadly wrath, but ere he could speak, the door was again opened, and Isaiah Beckwith entered.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">DEVELOPMENTS AND RETRIBUTION.</head> 
                  <p>THERE was a strange smile on the old lawyer's face as he came into the room, and a look of pride lighted up his features, as his eye rested on his noble-looking son.</p> 
                  <p>"By my faith," uttered the merchant, "you are making strangely free with my house. What may your business be, sir?"</p> 
                  <p>"Well," returned the lawyer, "perhaps I could not spin it all off at once, as my boy would say, but if you'll give me time, you shall have it in due season. First, sir, allow me to greet our friend."</p> 
                  <p>He turned to the countess as he spoke, and took her hand, and next, he spoke with Rosamond. Then he turned towards the merchant and spoke:</p> 
                  <p>"Now, sir, we'll come to business, if you wish to. First, I-"</p> 
                  <p>"Hold, sir," uttered Loman, turning pale as he met the cool, steady, determined gaze of the old attorney. "Perhaps your business is very private."</p> 
                  <p>"Not at all, sir. I wish first to know what has become of Henry Wallace."</p> 
                  <p>"Why do you ask me that question?"</p> 
                  <p>"That is not an answer, sir. Where is Henry Wallace?" Beckwith spoke sternly.</p> 
                  <p>"I know nothing of the fellow."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you not?"</p> 
                  <p>"You have my answer, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"Then, John Loman, I have a witness, and you shall see him face to face- Ah, hold a moment, my dear sir, your presence may be wanted."</p> 
                  <p>This latter sentence was spoken to Mr. Alberto Lacompte, who arose and turned towards the door as the <emph>witness</emph> was mentioned.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Lacompte sat down again, but he was not so much moved as was the merchant, for he had no character to lose, or name to blast, and let the worst come he knew that he could not be punished without dragging his employer down.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Beckwith went to the door and passed out into the hall, and when he returned he brought Henry and Clara Wallace with him!</p> 
                  <p>For a few moments all was still as death. Lacompte was the first to speak, and his ejaculation consisted of an oath that we will not transcribe. But he was struck as though by a cannon ball, and his eyes seemed ready to start from their sockets.</p> 
                  <p>John Loman started back aghast, and an oath was also upon his lips, but he kept it back. With a mighty effort he summoned all his power of control now, and was soon able to speak with comparative calmness, and he would have spoken calmly had he not seen his own daughter sink upon Henry Wallace's bosom, and cling to him with a wild, frantic joy.</p> 
                  <p>"Death and perdition!" he gasped, now losing all his carefully gained control, "am I to be insulted thus in my own house?"</p> 
                  <p>"Hold one moment, sir," uttered the old lawyer. "Let us talk the matter over calmly."</p> 
                  <p>In the meanwhile Clara had found a resting-place. When he first entered the room she met the gaze of the young captain. He smiled upon her and took a step forward. Then he whispered her name, and as he opened his arms and gave her an eager, wistful look, she moved forward and sank upon his bosom. It was a silent question-a silent answer; but in their hearts it had a powerful meaning. It was the renewal of the question which had been at rest for long months, and the answer was an eternal pledge.</p> 
                  <p>"By the Lord that made me," uttered Loman, "I'll stand this no longer. Madame Landowne, you see me moved, but have I not just cause for it?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, John Loman, you have," was her answer. "O, I should be deeply, terribly moved, were I in your place!"</p> 
                  <p>"Ha! What mean you now?"</p> 
                  <p>"I mean what I say, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"Hark ye, John Loman," interrupted the lawyer, "let us bring this matter to a close. You see I have found the lost ones, and now we have come to you to know why you sought their ruin."</p> 
                  <p>"Me? Ruin? Their ruin? Are you crazy, sir?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not at all, sir. I speak in sober earnestness. Alberto Lacompte, or Gustavus, Brown, or anything you please to call yourself, why did you carry these young people away from their homes, and confine them in Mrs. O'Brady's den?"</p> 
                  <p>"Me, sir?" uttered Alberto, trying to look very indignant.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, you, sir. And beware that you tell no lie. Do you know this, sir? and this?" asked the lawyer, holding up first a watch-seal, and then a piece of black silk with course hair attached to it.</p> 
                  <p>The villain turned pale as death.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, beware, sir. Tell the truth. Did not Mr. Loman hire you to carry away these young people?"</p> 
                  <p>"He did-he did!" gasped the terrified man.</p> 
                  <p>"Liar! Scoundrel!" hissed the merchant. "And was it for this you got three hundred dollars from me? Traitor! I'll- But," he added, turning to the lawyer, "it is all a lie-a base, black lie-hatched up to ruin me!"</p> 
                  <p>"We understand that, sir."</p> 
                  <p>By this time the countess had come forward to where Mr. Beckwith stood.</p> 
                  <p>"Let me look at that seal, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"I think you must recognize it," remarked the lawyer, with a smile, as he passed it over.</p> 
                  <p>"It is mine-it is mine!" she cried, as she saw the crest, and then opened it to the miniature. "Where, where did you find it?"</p> 
                  <p>"I think Mr. Lacompte can answer that question, lady. The seal was found upon his person."</p> 
                  <p>"Upon my person?" gasped Lacompte.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," returned Henry, turning towards him, "you remember when I caught you by the breast and whisker. My hold was not a very good one, but I retained enough to show that I had seized something."</p> 
                  <p>With a pallid look Alberto sank back into a chair, but his look was now upon the door. The lawyer noticed it and said:</p> 
                  <p>"You needn't look that way, sir, for I can assure you there's danger there for you more than here. If you trust yourself in the street now, you will fall into the clutches of those who would be inclined to inquire more particularly into your case than I shall."</p> 
                  <p>This had the effect of quieting Mr. Lacompte for the present, and then the busy lawyer turned towards the merchant once more.</p> 
                  <p>"I think you understand me now, sir. You will excuse me for a moment. Rosamond, will you have a light in another apartment?"</p> 
                  <p>The fair girl started to obey this request, and soon returned, and announced that the further sitting-room was lighted. Then the old gentleman turned to the countess.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, madam," he said, "you can retire. Wait no longer."</p> 
                  <p>"One word, first," said she; and then, turning to Lacompte, she asked, "Where did you get this seal?"</p> 
                  <p>"You wont-"</p> 
                  <p>"Fear nothing from me, sir, for I will do you no harm. Where did you get it?"</p> 
                  <p>"You came over here in the same ship with me, ma'am."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, I remember, now. There is where I saw you. You've improved in looks since."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. I found it convenient to spend a few months in Europe, and on my passage home I saw your rich watch and seal, and fell in love with 'em."</p> 
                  <p>"And I thought them lost."</p> 
                  <p>"And, after all," said the old lawyer, with a smile, "they came very near it."</p> 
                  <p>"So they did."</p> 
                  <p>"Henry, Clara," spoke Beckwith, "go with the countess."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," added the lady, "come. I would see you alone."</p> 
                  <p>She spoke tremulously, and turned her face quickly from the light; and as she passed out, the brother and sister followed her.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, Mr. Loman," said the attorney, after the door had closed on the retiring people, "let us come to an understanding. You may be surprised that I choose to make these developments in the presence of so many, but-"</p> 
                  <p>At this juncture Rosamond left the room.</p> 
                  <p>"I felt it due you that you should be punished. I would not bring you to a legal trial, for I have a regard for the feelings of your children. But you see the enormity of the crime you have committed. Only look at it, sir. Look now at the goal you wished to reach, and see what must have been your feelings had you even reached it unscathed by detection. Where would have been your peace? where your joy? O sir, where in heaven's name is one to look for peace in the path of crime? I would have spoken with you all alone on this subject-not a soul should have heard me-had your deeds not affected all who have been here assembled."</p> 
                  <p>"Stop, stop, sir. Say no more!" groaned the stricken man. "I have been betrayed, and that is enough."</p> 
                  <p>"I did not betray you!" cried Lacompte. "By heavens, somebody betrayed me!"</p> 
                  <p>"Lacompte did not betray you, John Loman. You betrayed yourself in a measure, accident did the rest. Henry and Clara came to me this morning and told me their whole story. They left the woman who kept them locked up in the youth's room, and then they fled from the house. As soon as I heard their story, I knew all. You know how much I know. O sir, it was a terrible thing you would have done. And think-how you would have sworn to love and cherish one whom you-"</p> 
                  <p>"Stop! stop! God known I have misery enough for now. Not only this thing here, but my oldest child is ruined!"</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, how so?"</p> 
                  <p>"She is married to that villain!"</p> 
                  <p>"What, has your own tool bitten you? Has the serpent you reared for the death of others, turned and stung his keeper?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, no," cried Lacompte. "I wont carry it any further. Let me go free from this, and you shall have back your daughter unharmed."</p> 
                  <p>"Unharmed, villain? Is she not your wife?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, it was a mock priest who said the ceremony."</p> 
                  <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6097-00000018"/> 
                  <p>"Then she is doubly ruined!"</p> 
                  <p>"No sir. As God is my judge, I didn't mean to ruin her. I only meant to make you pay roundly for having her back. Since the hour-the moment we were sham married, I have not seen her."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you speak truly, now?" cried Loman, starting up, and seizing the fellow by the arm.</p> 
                  <p>"As sure as death I do."</p> 
                  <p>"Then God be thanked!" and thus speaking, the guilty old man sank back into his chair.</p> 
                  <p>"One word more," resumed Beckwith. "You know Henry Wallace loves Rosamond. Will you consent to their union?"</p> 
                  <p>"Anything. I am at your mercy!"</p> 
                  <p>"I do not ask it as-"</p> 
                  <p>The lawyer stopped, for he saw that the merchant was slowly leaning forward, and that his cheek was deathly. He sprang forward just in time to prevent him from falling to the floor. He had fainted.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">CONCLUSION.</head> 
                  <p>BOTH Henry and Clara were puzzled and surprised at this strange move, yet they followed the countess without saying a word. When they reached the little sitting-room, Clara could not resist the impulse that came over her.</p> 
                  <p>"O Henry," she uttered, "this seems like home. This little room where I have sat so many hours."</p> 
                  <p>But Henry made no reply, for at that moment the countess sank into a seat, and turned her gaze upon the youthful couple who followed her. A short while she gazed upon them, and then bowed her head, and burst into tears. Clara sprang quickly to her side, and placed her arm about her neck.</p> 
                  <p>"There, there, Clara, it is nothing. Sit down again. It is only a passing emotion."</p> 
                  <p>The maiden sat down, and after some moments of silence, during which the countess was wiping away her tears, the latter said:</p> 
                  <p>"You wonder, my children, why I have sent for you, and why I have thus called you hither, I must speak plainly, and at once, for my secret must bear me down no longer."</p> 
                  <p>She stopped a moment here, wiped a fugitive tear from her cheek, and then began her narration:</p> 
                  <p>"I must go back and tell you a strange story, and I know you will not blame me. I am by birth an American, and was born not far from this city. My parents were poor, honest people, but they gave me a good education, for my mother was herself a good scholar. At the age of seventeen, I lost both my parents, and shortly afterward I married a young man whom I truly loved. He was poor, and an orphan. We lived together four years, and during that time I had two children-a son and a daughter. Then my husband died, and I was left alone. I was weak and sickly, and erelong gaunt poverty came to my doors. It stared me in the face awhile, and then it seized me. A poor woman, who was also a widow, but without children, gave me a home for awhile, but I saw that I was a useless burden on her hands. She loved my dear little children, and she loved me. She did not murmur, and yet I could see that she was suffering on my account. Had I been able to work, it would have been different, but I was not.</p> 
                  <p>"At length a man who lived near by was about to go to Europe with his family. He wanted a governess for his children, and a nurse for his invalid wife. The physician told me it would benefit me to go. The gentleman, a Mr. Nixon, came for me. It was a hard thing. O, so hard. For six long days and nights I pondered on it. But how could I refuse the offer thus made? I knew that I could not much longer remain where I was, for the poor woman could not support both me and my children. I could not take my children with me. My hostess asked me to go, and in her kindness she only said 'twould do me good. She would take my children and treat them as her own. One whole night I lay awake, and wept, and prayed for strength to do right, and in the morning, I had resolved to go. I took my kind hostess aside, and told her my decision, and asked her if she would be a mother to my children. She said she would, and I believed her. Then I told her to rear them as her own. It was hard, but I wished to leave my children no cause of grief. I did not wish them to feel that they were orphans. So I bade the woman if I ever returned, that my children should never know they had any mother but her. She promised joyfully. O, I could not bear that the little ones should grow up and know that their mother had deserted them. But I hoped to return a well woman, and this hope gave me strength.</p> 
                  <p>"At length the time of parting came, but I would not let my children see me weep. I feared it would be an incident they would not forget. I kissed them in the morning while they slept, and then I went away. I shall not tell you how I wept-nor how long I wept. But it was a long, long while ere the blow passed over so as to leave me easy. We left the shore of America, and ere I had been at sea long I began to feel stronger, and the interest I felt in the little ones under my charge, relieved my heart of part of its burden.</p> 
                  <p>"We reached England at length, and after remaining there some months, we went to Scotland. At Perth we fell in with the Earl of Errol, and by his invitation, Mr. Nixon stopped at his dwelling. The earl was a noble-looking man, not far from forty, but as fresh and buoyant as a youth. He commenced to converse with me, and he seemed pleased with my conversation. People then called me beautiful-and perhaps I was. I had now regained my health, and when in company that I liked, I was cheerful and joyous. The earl sought my society more and more, and at length I found my heart gone. I was not happy save when he was nigh; and when he came, joy came with him.</p> 
                  <p>"When the autumn came, and the winds began to shake the brown leaves from the great oaks and elms, Mr. Nixon got ready to start for France. One day, before we were to start, Lord Landowne, such was the earl's name, came to me, and placing his arm around my waist, he asked me if I would not remain with him. I asked him what he meant, and he told me he would have me remain to make him happy-to be his wife. I loved him truly and fondly, and I told him yes. So Mr. Nixon went to France, and I became the wife of the earl. He loved me for myself, and I was grateful. He was all affection and truth, and I learned to worship him.</p> 
                  <p>"And did I think of my children all this while? Yes, I prayed for them and I wept for them; but I dared not at first tell my husband all; but at length I felt how wrong I was doing, and I told him the whole truth. He received it kindly, and when I began to weep, he kissed me tenderly, and told me to send for my children at once. 'I have none of my own,' he said, 'and yours shall be mine. Send for them, and we will love them together.' I did send, but I could not find them. Again I sent more particularly-this time sending one of my husband's own servants. But he came back and told me that the woman with whom my children were left was dead, and that the children were both dead, too. O, it was a heavy blow!</p> 
                  <p>"And years passed on, and my husband was all in all to me. I had not a wish that was not for his welfare, and he knew and approved it; and often with his arms around me, and his cheek against mine, would he assure me that he had found the best wife in the world. By-and-by Mr. Adam Wagner came to Perth, and he became intimate with the earl. In time he learned my whole story from my husband, and then came to me to learn it more particularly. He heard me tell all, and then he said he believed that my children lived-a noble youth and a virtuous maiden. Again my soul yearned towards my native land, and my husband made up his mind that he would accompany me to America.</p> 
                  <p>"But it was not so to be. The noble earl fell sick, and the doctors said he must die. He made his will, and by it, after leaving a few legacies to other friends, domestics, and so on, he left the whole of his vast property to me, with the condition, if my children were living, two-thirds of it should go to them. He died! For awhile my heart was all dark and drear, but soon the thoughts of my children revived me, and having placed my husband's affairs in the hands of faithful people, I went to London, where I knew I should find Mr. Wagner. I found him there, and he gave me letters to Mr. Loman. He said there were two men to whom he could send me, but he feared that one of them-Mr. Beckwith-had gone West, so he sent me to Mr. Loman, telling me that that individual could help me, if any one could; and he also wrote a letter to Mr. Loman, which he sent by mail.</p> 
                  <p>"So I came to America, and as soon as I had recovered from the effects of the voyage, I sent for the merchant. He came to me, and I stated my business. I had written it all down, and I gave him the paper to read. He promised to help me if he could. He was kind and affable then, and managed to touch my heart with his assumed kindness. He professed that he was using every exertion to find my children, and I was grateful. At length he asked me to become his wife. I thought him an honest, true man, and I sympathized with him in his professed loneliness. I told him that I could not give him an answer until we had found my children, and then I should be governed by them. But I did at length tell him, that if the children were not found within six months, I would at the end of that time give him a decided answer. But I soon began to discover things in him that I did not like. His true character would at times manifest itself.</p> 
                  <p>"By-and-by I saw you both in this very room. You remember the circumstance. Sit still, Clara. Move not yet. You remember it. Soon afterwards you were missing. One day Rosamond and myself went up into your room, and I overhauled some of your things. I found a Bible there, and in it I found the name of Nancy Varney. She was the woman with whom I left my children. I came down and found Mr. Beckwith waiting below. He informed me that Henry Wallace was missing. My suspicions were painful then. On the next day the old lawyer came to my hotel, and I began to tell him my story, when I found he knew it all. He had received a letter from Mr. Wagner in which it was all told. He bade me go out to the place where Nancy Varney had lived, and make inquiries quiries. I went, and took Rosamond with me. We had some trouble, but I gained the truth. I first learned that Mrs. Varney had married a man by the name of Wallace within three months after I went away-that her second husband died in less than a year; next she was taken sick-was sick a year, and then died. From thence I traced my children to the almshouse-from thence to Mr. Adam Wagner's, and from thence to this city. One to the house of John Loman, and the other to the office of Mr. Isaiah Beckwith. Then, then-O then-I knew the deep guilt of which John Loman had been the author. He would have betrayed my children for the sake of their mother's gold! He feared that they would never consent to such a union-that they would betray his real character, and that they would claim two-thirds of the wealth he coveted!</p> 
                  <p>"I came back and stopped at Mr. Beckwith's hotel. He was not in, but I found his son who had just returned from sea. He knew me by my resemblance to the miniature that he had seen in the seal that Henry had given into his father's hands. He spoke to me of Clara, and when we had come to an understanding, I told him all I had learned. He came here with me, determined to wring the truth from John Loman. But you have seen all-you have seen all the wondrous developments that have been combined to bring out the truth.</p> 
                  <p>"Henry-Clara!"</p> 
                  <p>They knew it was their mother that spoke to them, and they now gave way to the emotions that had been struggling within them, since the strange story was commenced.</p> 
                  <p>A moment more, and the three were upon their knees together, and their sweet tears mingled in one pure stream of holy joy.</p> 
                  <p>After awhile, when they had become more calm, they sat together on the sofa, and the happy mother told over more of her past life. The story of the iron cross was told over again, and when Clara had told how it had served her, the mother clasped it to her bosom with prayerful emotions.</p> 
                  <p>"O," she uttered, "little did I think, when I left this simple memento with Mrs. Varney, and bade her give it to you, that it would possess ever such a power."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah," added Henry, "it is worthy a place among the archives of a monarch. It is worth to us all our gold, for had it not been for this simple bit of homely iron, we three might never have met again."</p> 
                  <p>"Yet," said the mother, "I should have known you were my children, for Rosamond told me of the iron cross, and then I knew you. When I first saw you, I felt drawn towards you, but your name puzzled me, I did not know how my children could have gained the name of Wallace."</p> 
                  <p>"But," said Henry, "did not Mr. Wagner tell you where we were?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, he told me nothing of you. But in his subsequent letter to Mr. Beckwith, he explains the reason. He feared that there might be some mistake-or that some accident might have happened, and he would not raise my hopes too much. He supposed Mr. Loman would know the truth at once, and that as soon as I applied to him, and explained my business, he would at once conduct my children to me. But come, it is growing dark, and our friends may wish-"</p> 
                  <p>At this moment there came a gentle rap upon the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Come in," said the countess.</p> 
                  <p>It was Rosamond and Captain Beckwith.</p> 
                  <p>"It is all told," said the mother.</p> 
                  <p>Rosamond clasped her hands with joy, and on the next moment was resting on Henry's bosom.</p> 
                  <p>"Madam," said the captain, approaching and taking Clara's hand, "may I not share your joy?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes sir."</p> 
                  <p>"And this sweet charge, may she be mine?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, and God's blessing with her."</p> 
                  <p>"And I," cried Rosamond, crying and laughing by turns, "this is an hour of new life-paths, and I must ask for mine."</p> 
                  <p>"Stop, Rosamond," spoke Henry; and then turning to his mother, he said:</p> 
                  <p>"You will take this sweet girl for your daughter?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-yes."</p> 
                  <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>When the happy party returned to the drawing-room, Mr. Loman and Alberto Lacompte were both gone. The latter had proved himself a villain of the deepest dye, but as he could be not punished without dragging Mr. Loman down with him, he was allowed to go. But the old lawyer assured him that sharp eyes were upon him, and that another sin would fall heavily upon him with its consequences.</p> 
                  <p>It was late when the merchant returned, and with him came Arabella. She was humbled and mortified, and the lesson was one she never forgot. She had escaped ruin, and she resolved that she would never again trust any one for what they appeared.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Loman took a severe cold that evening, the heated state of his system helping to fasten it upon him. He grew sick, and the physicians were called, but they could not save him. He died-and those he had so deeply wronged were by his bedside to forgive him. Rosamond felt assured that her father's soul was truly contrite and repentant, and he was hopeful with joy and peace.</p> 
                  <p>The summer passed away, and when autumn came, there were weddings in the noble mansion that Matilda Landowne had purchased. Henry and Rosamond, Captain Beckwith and Clara, were united in those bonds that truth and virtue make the happiest on earth. But see! after this is done, the stout old lawyer takes Madame Landowne by the hand and leads her forward. He holds her by the hand, and the clergyman speaks to them just as he had a few moments before spoken to those whom he had married! Yes! Hark! There it goes-and the happy countess had flung her title away, and become plain Mrs. Isaiah Beckwith.</p> 
                  <p>O, how the younger people laugh and clap their hands. Arabella is as happy as the rest, for by her side site a worthy young man-a young merchant in good business-who is soon to become her husband.</p> 
                  <p>But the joy of that evening was not to end there. No, that was but the budding of those new relations that were to make joy for a lifetime.</p> 
                  <p>One day after the snow of winter had come, Henry bethought himself of hunting up Mrs. O'Brady, to see if out of his abundance he could help her. He found the house, but it was locked up. He met a policeman on the corner, by the closed window of the old groggery, and of him he asked concerning the old woman who used to keep there.</p> 
                  <p>"Gone off," replied the officer. "Some of her pals-three reg'lar out-an'-out villains, got caught in some scrape, an' they were traced here, but afore we could nab 'em, they'd got clear off. But never mind. They are better away than here."</p> 
                  <p>So Henry returned bootless, save in news, for he was sure that the three villains alluded to were none other than Lacompte, Snaps and Walsh. As for Mrs. O'Brady, he could not remember her but with gratitude, and both he and Clara, when they sometimes looked upon the <emph>iron cross</emph>, which they kept sacred, were wont to pray for the peace of the unfortunate being whom they knew to be more the victim of prejudice than the designing sinner, and whose degraded life was more the result of a false state of society than of any principles innate within herself.</p>

               <head>HOW TO SPELL CAT.</head> 
               <p>Sometime during the last war with Great Britain, the - Regiment of Infantry was stationed near Boston. Old Doctor M- (peace to his ashes!) was surgeon to the regiment. The doctor was an old gentleman of very precise and formal manners, who stood a great deal upon his dignity of deportment, and was, in his own estimation, one of the literati of the army. Nevertheless he was fond of a joke-provided always it was not perpetrated at his own expense.</p> 
               <p>It is well known, in the "old school," that at the commencement of the war, a number of citizens were appointed officers in the army, who were more noted for their chivalry than for the correctness of their orthography. The doctor took little pains to conceal his contempt for the "new set." One day, at mess, after the decanter had performed sundry perambulations of the table, Captain L-, a brave and accomplished officer, a great wag, remarked to the doctor, who had been somewhat severe in his remarks on the literary deficiencies of the new officers:</p> 
               <p>"Doctor M-, are you acquainted with Captain G-?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I know him well," replied the doctor; "he's one of the new set-but what of him?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing in particular," replied Captain S-. "I have just received a letter from him, and I will wager on a dozen of old Port that you cannot guess in six guesses how he spells <hi rend="i"/>cat."</p> 
               <p>"Done," said the doctor, "it's a wager."</p> 
               <p>"Well, commence guessing," said S-.</p> 
               <p>"K-a-double t."</p> 
               <p>"No."</p> 
               <p>"K-a-t e."</p> 
               <p>"No-try again."</p> 
               <p>"K-a-t-t-e."</p> 
               <p>"No-you have missed it again."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, c-a-double t."</p> 
               <p>"No-try again; it's your last guess."</p> 
               <p>"C-a-g-h-t."</p> 
               <p>"No," said S-, "that is not the way-you have lost the wager."</p> 
               <p>"Well," said the doctor, with much petulance of manner, "how does he spell it?"</p> 
               <p>"Why he spells it <hi rend="i"/>c-a-t," replied S-, with the utmost gravity.</p> 
               <p>Amidst the roar of the mess, and almost choking with rage, the doctor sprang to his feet, exclaiming, in a loud voice:</p> 
               <p>"Captain S-, I am too old a man to be trifled with in this manner."</p>

               <head>THE CANNIBALS OF AUVERGNE.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE.</head> 
               <byline>BY GIACOMO CAMPANA.</byline> 
               <p>I ONCE spent a summer and fall in wandering on foot through the central and southeastern parts of France. I was all alone, but life was yet in its early springtime, and I thoroughly enjoyed the free, careless, gipsey-like roving among scenes new and strange, and presenting a never-fading, ever-varying panorama of rural beauty. My mode of travelling enabled me to penetrate the inmost recesses of the land, where the foot of the tourist seldom or never treads; and I sometimes spent whole weeks in rustic communes, where every individual, from monsieur le maire to the swineherd, seemed to have been buried in a Rip Van Winkle slumber for a hundred years, except perhaps a few old soldiers, who had brought with them from the army some reminiscences of modern days, mingled with marvellous stories of Abd el-Kader and the Chasseurs d'Afrique.</p> 
               <p>It was the hottest part of the year, but I was seldom otherwise than cool and comfortable, buried as I was in the high, rocky solitudes of Auvergne. On a bright morning early in August, I left the village of St. Armand, in the Puy de Dome, by a wild mountain path for a still smaller village, the name of which I have now forgotten. It is, however, within a league or two of Resse, and the route thither, for the greater part of the way, skirts a small stream, one of the remotest branches constituting the head-waters of the river Allier, which is itself a tributary to the Loire. Most frequently in these excursions I managed to secure a companion or guide of some description; but in this lonely region travellers were extremely scarce, and in this particular instance I was obliged to depend upon my own resources. I had little apprehension, however, as to the result, for the path was described to me as a plain one, not easily missed, and very rarely leaving the banks of the above-mentioned stream for any distance.</p> 
               <p>Most of my baggage, according to my usual habit, had been sent forward to a town in the neighboring department of the Upper Loire, and I had only a change or two of linen and my dinner to carry with me. My place of destination could not be more than fourteen or fifteen miles off. I therefore started with the confident expectation of reaching my journey's end long before night. Ere I had completed half the distance, however, a difficulty occurred. The path which I was following separated into two branches, both equally distinct and apparently equally well travelled. Which was I to take?</p> 
               <p>After some deliberation, I concluded that I could not go far wrong as long as I kept near to the stream, and consequently took the path which lay in that direction. Its course seemed much the same as that which I had hither to been pursuing, and I strolled leisurely along, with occasional pauses for the purpose of admiring the magnificent scenery, until my appetite began to admonish me that it was time to halt and refresh. Accordingly, seating myself by a spring of ice-cold water, I proceeded to transfer from my pocket to a still safer receptacle, sundry slices of bread and butter, a small flask of wine, and a quantity of delicious plums which I had purchased in the market-place of St. Armand. Then lighting a cigar, I reclined at ease in the shadow of a huge rock, and fell-asleep.</p> 
               <p>My siesta lasted some two hours or more, and when I awoke, I started forward at a brisk pace, resolving to make sure of not being benighted among the mountains. However, before I had walked more than half an hour, the path, which had been growing less and less distinct for some time past, at length branched off in several directions. These branches, I soon ascertained, could none of them be traced more than a few hundred rods, becoming gradually obliterated and undistinguishable from the rocky wilderness around. It was plain enough that this could not be the right path-that I had lost my way, in fact. It was not a choice of paths this time, however, for the path had left me altogether.</p> 
               <p>What was to be done now? There was not a human being of whom I could inquire probably within a circle of several miles; and to retrace my steps to the spot where I had diverged from the other path would unquestionably involve the necessity of spending a considerable part of the night upon the mountains. It was no easy matter to decide what was best to be done, but I finally came to the conclusion to push forward in a line making nearly a right angle with the course of the stream, hoping thus to strike the true path, which must, I thought, run nearly parallel to it.</p> 
               <p>The event showed that my notion was a correct one. I finally succeeded in getting into the right path, though I passed it in the first instance without noticing it, and wandered several miles too far to the right, being eventually set straight again by an old charcoal burner whom I accidentally <unclear>fell</unclear> in with. By this time it was nearly sunset, and I was forced to make the last four or five days of my journey in the dark. I did not need the stimulus supplied by the distant howling of a pack of wolves, to induce me to use all due diligence in getting forward; but, do the best I could, it was a very slow business, and it was past eleven o'clock when I saw a light gleaming in the distance, and cordially welcomed it as an indication of the close proximity of the village, or at least of some house or hamlet in its immediate vicinity.</p> 
               <p>I had not advanced far when I perceived that the light was not altogether stationary, and I soon afterwards discovered that it did not proceed from a house, though I could dimly discern a building of some sort beyond it. Finally, I drew near enough to see what was the true state of the case, and was a good deal startled at the sight. The building was evidently an old stone church, and a party of five or six men, one of them holding a lantern, stood in the churchyard round an open grave.</p> 
               <p>Sheltered by an old dilapidated wall, which enclosed the place, I was enabled to get near enough to see that these men were not, as I had at first supposed, lowering a body into the grave, but hoisting one out of it. My curiosity was already aroused, and this discovery greatly increased it; for body-snatching, I felt sure, was a thing unheard of among the simple-minded Auvergnats. I could only see the dim outline of what was no doubt a coffin, as they raised it noiselessly from the grave, and placed it on a sort of litter which they had brought with them. Having then hastily shovelled back the earth, four of them raised the litter to their shoulders, and bore it rapidly away.</p> 
               <p>The course pursued by the party led them in the direction in which I had been travelling-that is to say, towards the village, and I followed just close enough to keep them in sight. In a very short time, as I had anticipated, the dusky outline of the houses loomed up in the darkness. At this point the men with the litter turned aside from the path, and plunged into a gloomy looking ravine. After a moment's hesitation I followed them. They had extinguished their lantern, and I was obliged to trust to my ears rather than my eyes to guide me in the pursuit. I had not far to go, however, for the party soon halted at the door of a small cabin, into which they entered with their burden.</p> 
               <p>Softly advancing, I cautiously made the circuit of the hut, and soon discovered that the small unglazed windows were stopped up by sacks, stuffed with wool, or some similar substance. The door, too, was secured, so that it was impossible to see through the key-hole, or anywhere around it, and I was beginning to despair of the possibility of ascertaining anything of what was going on inside, when my eye accidentally caught a flash of light coming from the interior through a crevice in the wall. This hole was large enough to look through, but it was unfortunately very near the ground, and I was unable to see anything inside higher than the waist-bands of the men's breeches. My curiosity was thus to some extent baffled, but I could easily perceive that they had placed the body on a table in the centre of the room, and three of their number, who held long bloody knives in their hands, seemed to be at work upon it, though I could not exactly ascertain what they were doing.</p> 
               <p>This was no scientific <foreign xml:lang="LAT">post mortem</foreign> examination or dissection. What were they doing? What could their purpose be? I knew the gross superstition which prevailed among these mountains, and visions of dark heathenish rites, of diabolical midnight orgies, flashed upon my mind, and made me shiver in the sultry summer air. Turning my head, I eagerly advanced my car to the crevice, in the hope of gathering something from the conversation of the men inside; but the uncouth <foreign xml:lang="FRA">patois</foreign> of Auvergne, which I could with difficulty make out under the most favorable circumstances, was almost wholly unintelligible to me in the whispering tone to which they were careful to sink their voices. I therefore abandoned the attempt at listening, and again applied my ear to the crevice.</p> 
               <p>A fellow, whose naked arms all smeared in blood I could see as he stooped, was in the act of throwing something-probably the contents of the abdomen-into a sort of well or sink, covered by a trap-door. After this was accomplished, as he stooped still lower to fasten the door or adjust it in some way, the light of the lantern flashed full in his face, and I had for an instant a full view of his features. Afterwards I saw them remove something-the head apparently-and place it in a corner, where it was carefully covered with leaves. A division of the corpse seemed then to take place. There were five of them, and each one put a portion into a bag evidently brought along for the purpose, and prepared to carry it away with them.</p> 
               <p>The door was suddenly thrown open, and I had barely time to spring behind a huge rock, when the party came out with their bags on their shoulders, and locked the door after them. They passed within a few feet of the spot where I was secreted, and I could readily make out what they were saying at that moment.</p> 
               <p>"I'll do it!" cried one of them, laughing. "I'll take it to the mayor's" (every village in France has a mayor, and Paris has a dozen or two), "before he's up, and sell it to Madams Lizetto for prime mutton."</p> 
               <p>"Just so," said another, "and I'll fix up a nice dish of cutlets for monsieur le commissionaire."</p> 
               <p>A loud explosion of laughter followed, and before it had subsided, the men were out of hearing. A little way off they halted, and then quietly dispersed in different directions, leaving me alone under the starry midnight sky.</p> 
               <p>The reader can imagine what my feelings were, more easily than I can describe them. My first idea was to get into the cabin, and secure some proof of the reality of my horrible adventure. But the door was a strong one, and I had no means of breaking it open. I then thought of the windows; but they were only small, oblong holes, too narrow to admit of my passing through them. I therefore relinquished the thought of getting into the place then, and walked slowly on to the village, debating with myself the question whether I should rouse the authorities and tell my story at once, or wait till morning.</p> 
               <p>Before I had come to a decision upon this matter, I reached the village and stood in front of the principal <foreign xml:lang="FRA">auberge</foreign>. With some difficulty I waked up the landlord and a number of sleepy-headed servants, who undertook to prepare me something to eat. From the former I learned that the mayor lived nearly half a mile off, and the commissioner of police still further. This information, tired and sleepy as I was, soon brought me to the determination to go quietly to bed as soon as I could get some supper, and hold my tongue till morning-and so I did.</p> 
               <p>I did not wake in the morning so early as I intended. I therefore swallowed my breakfast as speedily as possible, and hurried off to the residence of the municipal officer. That dignitary I found to be a short, squat figure of a man, with a pair of large wooden shoes, large breeches, and an uncommonly large protuberance in the region of the epigastrium and parts adjacent. Fortunately he had been brought up in the neighborhood of Lyons, and spoke very decent French.</p> 
               <p>My story made a decided impression on his worship's nerves, and the grunts and groans, and piteous exclamations which it called forth, were really distressing to witness. Fearing last the latter part of my narrative might be attended with serious consequences, I thought it best to break it to him gradually.</p> 
               <p>"Monsieur le maire," said I, "did any of your family purchase any mutton this morning?"</p> 
               <p>"Mutton?" quoth the mayor. "Yes indeed, my wife had some beautiful cutlets for breakfast. They were dressed <foreign xml:lang="FRA">a la Maintenon,</foreign> and were really delicious. I had just finished the last one when you came in to spoil my digestion with your horrible story."</p> 
               <p>"Monsieur le maire," resumed I, "It really grieves to the heart to have to-"</p> 
               <p>"Well, sir, well?"</p> 
               <p>"To inform you-"</p> 
               <p>"Pray go on, sir."</p> 
               <p>"That those cutlets-"</p> 
               <p>"Those cutlets?"</p> 
               <p>"Those delicious cutlets-"</p> 
               <p>"Those delicious cutlets?"</p> 
               <p>"Those cutlets <foreign xml:lang="FRA">a la Maintenon</foreign>-"</p> 
               <p>"Pray, do go on, sir!"</p> 
               <p>"Were-"</p> 
               <p>"Were? For Heaven's sake, proceed, sir!"</p> 
               <p>"Were not mutton."</p> 
               <p>"Not mutton? <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Just ciel!</foreign>-what were they, then?"</p> 
               <p>"They were-they were-"</p> 
               <p>"For pity's sake, tell me at once!"</p> 
               <p>"They were-<emph>human</emph> cutlets-sliced from the very corpse I have been telling you about!"</p> 
               <p>The poor man gazed at me awhile in speechless misery; then suddenly clapping both hands upon his abdominal protuberance, he darted out of the back door and disappeared. After an absence of some five or eight minutes he returned, looking very pale and woebegone, and expressing his determination to have the sacrilegious scoundrels punished with the utmost rigor of the law. Having quickly listened to the conclusion of my story, drinking mean-while an enormous quantity of wine and water, he begged me to proceed to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">auberge,</foreign> where he would rejoin me in a short time with the commissioner of police and a squad of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">gens d'armes</foreign>.</p> 
               <p>The mayor was as good as his word, and soon made his appearance, riding on a well-fed, official-looking donkey, and bringing in his wake the commissioner and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">gens d'armes</foreign>. Monsieur le commissionaire sported a tricolored scarf, and tried to look dignified, but with very indifferent success, for the mayor had told him, and evidently with no small degree of satisfaction, the story of the spurious mutton cutlets, upon which he, too, had breakfasted.</p> 
               <p>By this time the news had been spread abroad in the village, and as we advanced through the single street, we were joined by a considerable part of the population. We soon came in sight of the cabin, and at that moment saw a fellow spring from the door, and start off at full speed down the ravine. I at once recognized him as the individual I had seen the night before, and immediately gave chase, with the whole <foreign xml:lang="LAT">posse comitatus</foreign> at my heels. A young peasant was the first to lay held of him. I came up next, and we held him until the arrival of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">gens d'armes,</foreign> into whose custody he was given. The mayor and his donkey were among the last arrivals, and as we wended our way back to the cabin, the former harangued the culprit quite eloquently upon the enormity of his conduct, though apparently with but little effect.</p> 
               <p>At length we reached the but. Being the hero of the occasion, I naturally took the lead passing through the door, which our prisoner in his hasty evacuation of the premises, had left open. There was no one within, but the table stood in the centre of the room, with fresh stains of blood upon it. At the sight of this confirmation of the horrible facts, a shudder pervaded the assembly, and it was with intense eagerness they watched me as I approached the corner of the room where the ghastly head was supposed to be. With something of a melo dramatic flourish I approached the spot, thrust my band beneath the leaves, and drew forth the gory head of a-deer!</p> 
               <p>What happened after that I am unable to say, for, while the spectators were crowding round the head and hide which lay beside it, and while the puzzled mayor was wiping the glasses of his spectacles, without seeking any further explanation I quietly withdrew, not only from the cabin, but from the village also. I afterwards learned, however, that the men I had seen were poachers; that they had the night before killed a doe in the park of a neighboring chateau, but not having time to skin it and cut it up before daylight, they had buried it in the graveyard, a spot to which they were accustomed to resort, as being the most free from interruption. The following night I happened to come along just in time to witness the removal, and to some extent the butchering of the carcase, and overhear the plot of selling a portion of it, under the name of mutton, to the village officials, thus making them a sort of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">particeps criminis,</foreign> by becoming buyers and consumers of the contraband articles. On the whole the adventure was of service to me, being a good lessen on the trusting to appearances, and jumping at conclusions too hastily and without due consideration.</p>

               <p>General Morgan bore a prominent part in the assault on Quebec, and narrowly escaped with his life. In the midst of the battle, an important <unclear>error</unclear> was committed by the storming party <unclear>under</unclear> Arnold, and while he was attempting to restore order, he received a ball in the leg, which brought him to the ground. The momentary confusion caused by these events brought Morgan to the front just as Arnold was struck down. It was at this crisis in the conflict that Morgan, at the Instance and in compliance with the express wishes of all the field officers of the division who were present, assumed the direction of the assault. "They would not take the command," he observes, in a short sketch, written by himself, of his early military career, "alleging that I had seen service and they had not, which reflected credit on their judgment." Morgan now raised his voice, always terrible in the hour of battle, and which was heard over the din of arms, ordering his riflemen to the front. They obeyed the summons with a cheer, and without a moment's hesitation or delay, rushed over the

A short distance beyond the barrier, was a battery extending across the road, and flanked by the houses on either side, on which were mounted two twelve-pounders. As the riflemen advanced against this battery, the guns, charged with grape and canister, opened on them. The first gun was elevated too high and did no injury; the other flashed without discharging, when the riflemen reached the walls and planted their ladders. Morgan ordered a man standing near him to ascend one of the ladders. Perceiving that the soldiers reluctantly obeyed, Morgan pulled him down, and stepping on the ladder himself, shouted, "Now, boys, follow me!" The ladders were instantly manned. As soon as Morgan's head appeared above the wall, a platoon of musketry was fired at him from within. So close was the discharge, that the fire scorched his hair, and grains of powder were imbedded in his face. But this was the only injury he sustained, although one ball passed through the top of his cap, and [CONTINUED ON PAGE 42]</p>

               <p>FROM Milan we went to Parma, and having spent a week in the latter city, Wardwell and myself bought horses to carry us to St. Stefano, the man of whom we bought them pledging himself to buy them back at any time within a month, if we did not injure them, only deducting a moderate price for their use. St. Stefano is at the head waters of the Taro, and distant from Parma some five-and-forty miles. It is nestled away at the foot of the Appenines, and we had been invited hitherto by our friend Montallo, who owned an extensive vineyard there. We had first met Michael Montallo in Genoa, and as a warm intimacy sprang up between us, and as he promised us any amount of pleasure, we accepted his invitation to visit him. He had gone on a few days in advance to prepare for our coming.</p> 
               <p>We were fortunate in our horses, for we obtained two noble ones, and their keeper assured us that if we started betimes in the morning we should have no difficulty in reaching St. Stefano before night. We started early-only half an hour after the sun was up-and as the road followed the bank of the Taro nearly all the way, the ride was a delightful one. It was only three o'clock when we reached Compiano, which was only ten miles from Montallo's residence. After leaving this place we left the river, and found ourselves among the mountains, the road winding around among lofty spurs of the range. We had reached a point where the path crossed a swift mountain torrent, and had just passed the bridge, when a dozen horsemen appeared before us. There was no mistaking those habits; the tall, peaked hat, with its gaudy band; the short, embroidered jackets; the blue shirts, and the leathern belts with their loads of weapons.</p> 
               <p>"Stand and deliver!" were the first words we heard; and after a few moments' hesitation we concluded to obey. We begged of them to allow us to retain our portmanteaus and clothing, but they would allow us nothing. They were dark, savage-looking men, long inured to crime, and I could find nothing of that romance about them which I had so often heard of in connection with the Italian banditti; but on the contrary, they were low, vulgar-looking fellows, with a hang-dog look, that forbade all thought of any such thing as a "lady-love" in connection with them. They took our portmanteaus, with all our clothing, our watches and money, and then bade us go on. I found myself lighter in burden to the amount of five hundred dollars in money, a watch worth a hundred more, and clothing worth perhaps another hundred. Wardwell had been wise enough to leave most of his money in Parma, so his lose was not so much. So when we reached Montallo's our pleasure was somewhat damped.</p> 
               <p>"Never mind," he said, when we had told our story, "I have clothing enough, and if you have escaped Dalmarto and his band with your lives, you should consider yourselves fortunate."</p> 
               <p>"Then they are known?" said I.</p> 
               <p>"Known!" repeated my host, with a dubious shrug of the shoulders, "I should think they were. Why, they have been the pest of these mountain regions for over eight years. Right here is the only handy pass over the mountains to Genoa, and these villains have grown fat in purse on the heavy robberies they have committed. They are the terror of all travellers, and the plague of all officers and soldiers."</p> 
               <p>"Then they cannot be soldiers."</p> 
               <p>"Why, bless you, no. More than two hundred soldiers have spent a fortnight at a time about their haunts without effect. To a stranger an account of the escapes they have made would be incredible. Sometimes they are here, and sometimes there; but the moment a party of soldiers heave in sight they are nowhere!"</p> 
               <p>That evening Montallo entertained us with an account of Dalmarto's exploits, and I was glad he did, for thereby I was enabled to go to bed a happy man. The loss of my property seemed as nothing, for I could only feel thankful that I was alive. On the following morning we had an opportunity to look about, and never did I find myself in a more charming spot. Montallo's place was in a deep, wide valley, or vale, with noble mountains upon either hand, and his vineyards extending up the slopes on both sides. From his place it was only about thirty miles over across to Genoa, and as he could carry all his wine over upon mules, his extensive vineyards were profitable. He kept a dozen men at work most of the time, besides the muleteers. He was a wealthier man than I had supposed.</p> 
               <p>Two days were spent in wandering about his premises, and visiting his extensive wine vaults, and on the morning of the third day he proposed to visit the great cave of Castello.</p> 
               <p>"It is a great place," said our host, "and a place which no one has yet' fully explored. It was accidentally found some years ago by a poor peasant, who had lost some goats and was up there searching for them. But come, you shall see for yourselves."</p> 
               <p>At seven o'clock we mounted our mules and set out, and after travelling six miles along a winding path among crags and cliffs, we began to ascend a mountain. It was a tedious ride up the rough, circuitous path, but we managed to take it pleasantly, and at length our host bade us stop. We were now upon a broad table of rock, with a perpendicular descent of some hundred feet upon one hand, and upon the other the mountain still towered above us. We hitched the mules to some dwarf-pines that grew out from a fissure in the rock, and then having taken torches, we prepared to follow our leader. These torches were huge lamps, made to hang on wooden handles, something after the fashion of the torches carried by engine men.</p> 
               <p>Each of us took a torch, a loaf of bread and a flask of wine, and then set out. For a distance of twenty rods or more, we climbed up a steep ascent, and here we came upon another table, only much smaller than the first. Upon this, standing close into the side of the mountain, was a huge detached rock, and back of this we found the entrance to the cave. It was a rough, jagged aperture some ten feet in diameter, with only a scene of darkness beyond. Montallo entered first, and we followed. For a distance of about twenty feet we passed through a tunnel not varying much in height from the entrance, and after this the way began to widen and expand, until we found ourselves in a vast chamber, the extremities of which were lost in utter gloom. The floor was quite smooth, but had a descent as we went on. Through this hall we travelled nearly four hundred feet, and then we came to a place where we had to crawl upon our hands and knees; but this was only a few feet, and then we found ourselves in a hall not so large as the first, but vastly more grand, for the walls were hung all over with stalactites, and as the light of our torches struck on the flashing pendants, the place had the appearance of one vast stelliferous dome.</p> 
               <p>After feasting our eyes upon this for awhile, we passed on to another cave, still smaller than the others, and here we saw passages leading off in all directions. They were narrow and high, seeming like vast fissures where the rock had split asunder. Into one of these I entered alone, and as the way seemed straight, I kept on for some distance, the thought of finding any difficulty in getting back never once entering my head. I did not notice that though the way seemed straight as I was going, yet it had slightly radiating branches going back. At length the floor became rough, and when I held the torch above my head, and looked only upon the floor to see that my footing was sure, an intervening spur caught my light and threw it from my hand. For an instant the fallen flame quivered with its expiring throes-and then I was in utter darkness. I groped about until I found my torch, and then I turned to make my way back. My eyes were of no more use that was my unlighted torch; but I fancied I had not gone far, and that a few moments' groping would lead me to my companions.</p> 
               <p>But erelong I felt that something must be wrong, and then I remembered that I had my apparatus for lighting cigars with me, and after awhile I managed to relight my torch. Strange that I had not thought of this before. However, the way was once more light, and I pushed on, and erelong I came out into a large apartment, and was upon the point of calling for my friends, when I discovered that I was in a place where I had not been before. Again I called out with all my power, but only the startling echoes of my own voice replied. But my eye caught a passage that I was sure led back towards the spot where I had left my companions, and I started into it. I had not gone fifty feet before I came to a point where the passage branched off in three different ways, but I took the one which led straight on, and followed it until I was satisfied that I was on the wrong track. To go back I considered the safest way, so back I turned; but ere I had gone ten rods I found the way divided into two branches. I had not noticed this before. Without much hesitation I took the one that led to the right, for it seemed to me that that was the one by which I had come.</p> 
               <p>And on I went-on, on-and by-and-by I had the peculiar satisfaction of being convinced that I had made another mistake. I stopped and pondered; and at length I resolved that I would take some path and follow as long as I could. I was now in a small chamber, the walls and ceiling of which were only of dark rock, and which had three outlets. I chose the one that I fancied would lead me aright, and pushed on. I heard of people's being lost and dying amid the interminable labyrinths of these vast caverns, and it is not strange that such thoughts made me a little uneasy, to say the least. But on I went, sometimes thinking I must be right, and, at others, that I was wrong. I passed through four more chambers, one of them as large as any I had entered, and finally I struck into a low, narrow passage which had a gradual descent. After travelling this some distance I stopped. The way was very descending now, and often I had to step down from one crag to another, sometimes letting myself down by my hands, where the perpendicular descent was great. It seemed that I must be going down into the bowels of the mountain; but after awhile I pushed on again.</p> 
               <p>And it was well that I did, for I had not gone twenty steps before I saw a faint glimmer of light ahead. I put my torch behind me, so as to be sure, and there was no mistake. This glimmer was descending, being certainly twenty degrees below me. But down I went, and when I had reached the point where the light came in, I found it to be a low, narrow aperture, the wide passage I had been following taking an abrupt turn to the left, and leading away into utter darkness. I crawled out into this aperture, and found that I was upon a sort of shelf, about half way up the wall of a wide chamber, and into this chamber the light came from two directions-from a narrow fissure overhead, and from an entrance on the floor nearly opposite from where I was. I held my torch out into the cave, and could see that the bottom was not far from twelve feet from where I was perched upon the shelf. And I saw more, too. But wait.</p> 
               <p>Slowly and carefully I made my way to the edge of the shelf, and then having found secure clutching places for my hands I worked my way over and let my body down, and in a moment more I reached the bottom of the cave in safety. Of course my torch was extinguished, but I could see well enough without; and almost the first thing upon which my eyes fell was-my own portmanteau!</p> 
               <p>Of course I knew that I was in the robber's cave. It was a wide cavern, with a rough, uneven floor, and upon every hand were piled up heaps of booty. There were many bales of dry goods, many casks, and, in short, every conceivable thing that travellers could carry across the mountains. Upon one side I saw a huge chest, which I tried to move, but could not. It was firmly locked, and I supposed it must contain what of money and jewels the bandits had to store away. I opened my portmanteau, and found my property untouched, only my gold was missing.</p> 
               <p>But I waited not long here. I took my portmanteau, and had resolved to take it off, when the thought occurred to me that if the villains should return and find anything missing, they might take alarm and make off with their most valuable booty, and furthermore, as my portmanteau was but little compared with the gold I had lost, I put it back where I had found it, and then taking my torch, made my way to the place where the light came in upon the floor. I found here an aperture only about three feet high, and some six feet in width, and having crawled through this I found myself in a deep ravine, and upon turning about I was surprised to find that I could not see the hole from whence I had come. But the mystery was soon explained. In coming out I had slid down a gentle descent, and an overhanging shelf of rock completely concealed the entrance. I should have said before, but may as well say here, that from the bottom of the cave the aperture through which I had gained access could not be seen, for the shelf extended some two or three feet out from the wall, and thus hid the place; so I doubt if the robbers ever discovered the secret.</p> 
               <p>This ravine in which I found myself after leaving the cavern, was long, narrow and deep, with almost perpendicular walls, but I could see that near me was the end of it, where the solid wall arose upon three sides, and I knew of course that the outlet must be the other way. So on I hastened, and at length came to the place of egress, which was very narrow, and hidden among a thick clump of trees. When I reached the confine of this stunted copse I found myself upon the western side of the mountain! So I must have made my way entirely through the giant rock.</p> 
               <p>It was an easy matter to find the path from here; with quick steps I started for the other side. I remembered a peculiar clump of trees I had noticed in the morning on the top of the mountains, and as I could see this now I had a safe guide. The way was toilsome, and just as the sun was sinking to rest I reached the broad table where we had left our mules; and shortly my companions joined me. I told them my story, and it was received with many expressions of almost incredulous wonder.</p> 
               <p>We reached home safe and hungry, and on the next morning Montallo hastened off to St. Stefano, where he gave an account of my discovery to an officer. The next morning I found, when I arose, a detachment of fifty soldiers under my window, waiting for me to guide them to the banditti's cave. Soon after breakfast I joined them. Wardwell and Montallo accompanied us, and by eight o'clock we were ready to set out. It was eleven o'clock when we reached the mouth of the robbers' cave, and having satisfied ourselves that there was no one within we entered. The officers were astonished beyond measure. It was soon arranged that the soldiers should remain concealed about the place until the bandits came, so my companions and myself set out on our return.</p> 
               <p>On the evening of the following day the soldiers came back, with the robbers with them, seven in number, having left five dead in the ravine on the mountain. Before I left Montallo's dwelling, Dalmarto and his men were hung, and the people were once more able to travel in safety. I received back my property in full, and a small sum of gold besides; but the warm blessings I received from the people were of more value than all else.</p>

               <head>PECULIARITIES OF PEKIN.</head> 
               <p>The city of Pekin is built in the form of a polygon, Its northern portion offering a parallelogram, and Its southern portion a square. It is surrounded by a turreted wall, with towers at short intervals; outside of this wall is a deep ditch, and beyond this enclosure a circle of suburbs, as densely peopled, as busy and compact as Pekin Itself. The capital of China consists, in fact, of two cities, the North, or Imperial City, and the South City. The former is called the City of Tartars; the latter the City of the Chinese. They are separated by a turreted wall, and communicate only by three gates, of which the middle one is reserved exclusively for the emperor. The Tartar City contains the palace of the "Son of Heaven" (the emperor), a mass of buildings of every size and shape, pavilions, pagodas and gardens, equally extensive and indescribable, which, it is said, takes a month to go once over.</p> 
               <p>The population of Pekin and its suburbs exceeds two millions. Sixteen gates communicate between the suburbs and the two cities within the walls; on either side of each gate is a party of soldiers, who act as policemen. The principal streets, especially in the northern portion, are wide and handsome, but the greater part of both the towns consists of narrow, dirty, crowded lanes, rendered yet more disagreeable by the numerous hucksters, traders and cook-shops established on the narrow pavements. The Chinese are fond of raree-shows, and Pekin contains many exhibitions of puppets, learned animals, <choice>

                  </choice> and conjurers, giving the town the aspect of an immense fair. It also contains numerous pagodas, built of porcelain, painted in the gaudiest colors, and surmounted by pointed roofs. As for the carriages of the Pekin grandees, they are described as resembling "boxes of soap set upon wheels" and drawn by oxen harnessed in the roughest possible fashion. Pekin contains nothing analogous to the handsome public buildings that adorn the capitals of Europe.</p>

               <p>Wraxall, in his historical memoirs, tells the following singular story of George Selwyn: "Selwyn's nervous irritability and anxious curiosity to observe the effect of dissolution on men, exposed him to much ridicule, not unaccompanied with censure. He was accused of attending all executions; and sometimes, in order to elude notice, disguised in a female dress. I have been assured that in 1750 he went over to Paris expressly for the purpose of witnessing the last moments of Damien, who expired under the most acute torture, for having attempted the life of Louis the Fifteenth. Being among the crowd, and attempting to approach too near the scaffold, he was at first repulsed by one of the executioners; but having informed the person that he had made the journey from London solely with a view to be present at the punishment of Damien, the man immediately caused the people to make way, exclaiming at the same time, 'Make way for monsieur; monsieur is an Englishman and an amateur.'"</p>

He was instantly on his feet again and commenced ascending the ladder. Another cheer rose from his men as they followed. Keeping his head down until he reached near the top of the ladder, he made a spring and bounded over the wall among the enemy. He was instantly followed by his men. In his descent he alighted on one of the cannon under the muzzle of which he fell, severely hurt by a contusion on the knee. A dozen bayonets were instantly levelled at him; but the situation in which he fell created a delay sufficiently long to enable his men, who now came pouring over the wall, to rescue him and attack his assailants. They made a feeble resistance, and at length fled into a building flanking the battery, from the windows of which they renewed the conflict. They were speedily dislodged by the riflemen. The enemy were driven through the building, and out at the rear into a neighboring street. Morgan

               <byline>BY ELLEN ALICE MORIARTY.</byline> 
               <p>"O JOHN, dear,"-and the wife of John Edgeworth ran into the little parlor, where he was seated thoughtfully before the fire, one December night, "one of the soldiers that have just come into town, has been billeted upon us."</p> 
               <p>"Send Nancy out to Prince's Arms, and engage a bed for him, Mary," he quietly said. "We can't have him here, and Mattie, poor child, going to be married to-night."</p> 
               <p>"O, bless your heart, John, that isn't a common soldier. He's a sergeant, and one would think, from the way he strutted in, that he was a colonel. When I proposed to get a bed for him outside, he bridled up, and says with as much authority as if he was talking to a landlady. 'If you can't accommodate me with a bed, I can pass the night on a rug before your parlor fire. A soldier, you know, can sleep soundly, however hard his bed. So here I'll stay,' says he."</p> 
               <p>"And here I'll stay," echoed a laughing voice; and the speaker, a tall, manly fellow, attired in the dress of a British sergeant, strode into the room. "The fact is, air," he continued, addressing John Edgeworth, "I am inclined to think, either your good lady must be a most unloyal subject of his most gracious majesty King William, in denying a welcome to one of the pillars of his throne, or that to-night at least she is unwilling to lay an offering at the feet of that beautiful household god, hospitality."</p> 
               <p>Here one of the pillars of King William's throne dropped majestically into a chair, complacently stroking as he did so a beard and mustache dark and luxuriant as your own, stern reader.</p> 
               <p>"My good man," John Edgeworth replied, "my wife and myself have always regarded and fulfilled as a pleasing duty the entertainment of a soldier billeted upon us; but to-night the presence of any one beyond our small family circle must prove embarrassing in the extreme. My daughter is to be married to-night, and-"</p> 
               <p>"O, do not imagine for a moment, my good sir," interrupted the sergeant, "that I shall find my situation embarrassing. I assure you, I am always very well at my ease. And a wedding! Of all things, excepting, of course, the delicate amusement of a battle-field, a wedding delights a soldier."</p> 
               <p>"We must endure his society, Mary," John Edgeworth said, in a low tone to his wife. "Do not let it annoy you, my dear; for Mattie's sake be cheerful. Is Amy with her?"</p> 
               <p>"She is," answered his wife, sighing deeply as she spoke. "God bless Amy Bradley."</p> 
               <p>"God bless her!" echoed the sergeant, and continued, rapidly, "Yes, God bless all as good as she is. Is she your daughter, ma'am?"</p> 
               <p>"She is not," John Edgeworth sternly said. "And remember, my man, though we are compelled to give you shelter for the night, any further impertinence on your part will be reported to your officer."</p> 
               <p>"Pardon my impertinence, then," replied the sergeant; and his softened tone arrested the steps of the couple, as they were leaving the room, "and hear me for a moment. Perhaps you both have a little corner in your memories occupied by the dear old room in your childhood's home, where you used to sit during the long, wild winter nights before a fire, blazing away as merrily as that one over there is blazing now, and watch the flames as they burst forth from their prison and shed a faint splendor through the gloom-I think you have. Almost every one has. I know that I have; and tonight, when I was passing the window here, and saw the light of that pleasant fire streaming through the chinks in the shutters, the shadows of many sorrowful years were lifted from my heart. I was again a happy little lad, sitting at my dear mother's feet, my head upon her knee, and tracing with wondering eyes the quaint pictures of the flames. 'Well for you, poor fellow,' thinks I, 'to keep this memory fresh to night.' And so I entered here. I have been rude, but pardon the roughness of a soldier."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Edgeworth burst into tears.</p> 
               <p>"Bid the poor fellow stay, John," she sobbed.</p> 
               <p>And John Edgeworth with a faltering voice welcomed the sergeant, for both husband and wife saw again, in that same room, a little boy kneeling before the fire, searching with earnest eyes the secret of its bright mysteries.</p> 
               <p>When he was left alone, the sergeant drew his chair over to the window and sat down there. He had scarcely done so, when the door was opened, and a young girl entered the room. She did not notice his presence there, for she went over to the fire and remained standing before it. Her face was partly turned towards him, and the sergeant gazed upon it with deepening interest. It told its own story, that sweet face-plainer than many words it told that, lovely as it was, sorrowful tears had marred its gentle beauty; and though now a smile brightened over it, that smile was the shadow of some pleasant memory, and not the light of a present joy. A domestic came in, and started when she saw the young girl.</p> 
               <p>"I thought you were up stairs, Miss Amy."</p> 
               <p>"Miss Mattie wished to be left alone for a while, Nancy," she answered.</p> 
               <p>"O Miss Amy, you oughtn't to have left her alone. She might make way with herself. I remember my poor mother telling of a young lady who was going to be made to marry a man she didn't like, and when they went up to call her, they found her lying dead; she killed herself, miss, rather than marry him. To be sure, Miss Mattie isn't forced to marry old Frazer-excuse me, Miss Amy, but I can't say mister to an old villain like him-but any one can see it's killing her. Ah, Miss Amy, if Mr. Harry was here to-night-well, if she isn't gone!" exclaimed Nancy; for at her last words the young girl had hastily quitted the room. "She's off like an arrow whenever I mention Mr. Harry to her-Good Lord! who is that?" she cried, springing back on perceiving the sergeant. "O, the soldier! Goodness, what a fright you gave me!"</p> 
               <p>"So there's going to be a wedding here tonight, my girl?" said the sergeant. "The bridegroom's no favorite, I'm thinking."</p> 
               <p>The proverbial fascination of a scarlet coat disarmed Nancy's prejudice against the intruder, for she answered without hesitation:</p> 
               <p>"You're thinking right, then. Everything has gone wrong with the master of late, and the last hundred pounds he had left, he gave for a share in what he heard was a salmon fishery near Romford. The salmon turned out to be frogs, and then old Frazer kept lending him money, and making him do this and do that, until the master had borrowed seven hundred pounds of him! Then at once he came down on him for his money, and either the master must go to Bridewell, or poor Miss Mattie must become his wife. And my darling young lady went down on her knees to her poor father, begging, for his and her mother's sake, to let her marry old Frazer; that she would be contented with him, if he were fifty times worse, if she thought they would be happy. But he could not be worse than he is; he is as ugly as the big Cornish giant. It's my belief he'd sell the last gray hair of his mother's head, if he thought he'd get a farthing for it. My dear young mistress! What a husband he is for you!" And Nancy hid her face in her apron and sobbed aloud.</p> 
               <p>"The old story," said the sergeant; "and to make it complete, my girl, your young mistress should have another lover whom she likes."</p> 
               <p>"And so she has," sighed Nancy, dropping her apron and a tear at the same time. "A fine young gentleman, but not a farthing he can call his own. Ah, Miss Mattie and Mr. Philip would have made a beautiful couple."</p> 
               <p>"Philip!" the sergeant repeated, in a surprised tone. "Philip what?"</p> 
               <p>"Philip Rackstone."</p> 
               <p>"Philip Rackstone! Why, my girl, soon after we marched into town, I pressed a shilling into his palm. Bless me, if I didn't think at the time no common trouble made him 'list!"</p> 
               <p>"'List!" she exclaimed. "He kept his word, then; he said from the first, he didn't care what would become of him, if Miss Mattie married. O my gracious, to 'list!"</p> 
               <p>"Well," said the sergeant, half-sneeringly, "it's my candid opinion that man's a fool who cannot meet with the spirit of a man a disappointment in love."</p> 
               <p>"D'ye hear that?" Nancy exclaimed, her cheeks crimsoning with indignation. "I knew a better and a braver man than ever you saw, who couldn't bear a disappointment in love!"</p> 
               <p>"I doubt it!" was the gallant reply.</p> 
               <p>"Doubt it! Wasn't be my master's son, Mr. Harry, Miss Mattie's brother and Miss Amy's lover? He was, to be sure, as wild as a young colt, always up to some frolic; and still for all his wild ways every one was fond of him. Whenever the players came to town, you'd think he was out of his senses for joy. Now, the master was always hard upon the players, calling them a pack of idle vagabonds and the like; and it didn't mend matters when he found out that Mr. Harry went on the stage one night, dressed like an old witch. 'He's disgraced himself and us,' says he, 'and with my consent he shall never marry Amy Bradley.' And Miss Amy, who is the master's ward, though she loved Mr. Harry in her heart, said much the same thing, that she never would marry a man she couldn't be proud of; so to make a long story short, Mr. Harry ran away. This night five years ago was the last time we saw him; but I can't help thinking he'll come back and make all the poor hearts that love him happy."</p> 
               <p>"He became a player, I dare say," the sergeant said; "just the kind of life a good-for-nothing like him would fancy. And yet he might turn up one of those fine days as rich as the great actor Warden, who is to play to-morrow night, so the bills say."</p> 
               <p>"For Miss Amy's sake, if for nothing else, I'd be glad if he'd come back as poor as he went. I think it's killing her to have him away so long. She could be married since, if she liked, and to a rich man, too; but she loves him too well to marry any one else. Why if you only could see her when a person speaks of him, the way her face lights up, and the soft bright light that comes into her sweet eyes-but there's the mistress calling me."</p> 
               <p>"Stay, Nancy!" exclaimed the sergeant; but Nancy had already left the room. He went after her, returning soon, however; and going over to the fire, he stood where Amy Bradley had stood, saying often to himself, as if the words pleased him, "Happy Mr. Harry! Happy Mr. Harry!"</p> 
               <p>He resumed his seat as the knocker sounded at the hall-door; and shortly after, John Edgeworth ushered into the rooms two persons, one evidently from his appearance a clergyman, the other an old, sharp-featured, stony-eyed little man, whom the sergeant surmised to be the bridegroom. The cause of the soldier's presence being explained to him by John Edgeworth, old Frazer, for it was he, in a sudden fit of generosity threw him a crown, desiring him to drink his health with it. The coin fell unnoticed at the sergeant's feet, for the door was opened, and Mrs. Edgeworth entered, followed by Amy Bradley, on whose arm leaned, or rather clung, a pretty, childlike little creature, her pale young face impressed with the sadness of a heavy heart. She did not raise her eyes to greet her future lord, who hobbled over to her side, and the hand which he took lay cold and passive in his own.</p> 
               <p>It was a painful sight, that ill-mated couple standing before the clergyman to utter vows that to one, at least, must seem a death-knell. Painful indeed it must have been to the manly heart of the sergeant, for his chest heaved with suppressed emotion. He rose from his chair, but sat down again, passing his hand over his eyes. He saw John Edgeworth's face whiten with intense agony-the agony of a wretched father's heart; he saw the bowed heads of Mrs. Edgeworth and Amy Bradley; he heard the low voice of the clergyman falteringly begin the marriage ceremony, as if he felt that the blessing which he would invoke would be a mockery. He saw all this, I repeat, until the clergyman, turning to the poor girl, asked her "if she would take that man there present for her lawful and wedded husband," then springing up, he shouted:</p> 
               <p>"Never, Mattie! never, sister!"-but the rest of his exclamation was lost in the cries of "Harry!" that burst from the lips of the astonished women, and the next moment they were clinging around him, weeping heartily enough, to be sure, but their tears were blessed tears of joy.</p> 
               <p>"Harry, Harry, my dear boy?" faltered John Edgeworth, still half incredulous.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, father." returned the sergeant, removing from his face at the same time the beard and mustache which had disfigured it, "your son, indeed, who has returned to ask your forgiveness, to snatch poor Mattie from a miserable future, and, if Amy loves me yet, and wont say no, why, to become her husband."</p> 
               <p>Amy hid her blushing face on his shoulder, whispering, "Indeed I wont say no, dear Harry."</p> 
               <p>"O Harry, darling, are you in earnest?" Mattie cried, still clinging around his neck. "O, I know you are-and I wont have to marry him?"</p> 
               <p>"That you wont, poor little thing!" said Harry, soothingly.</p> 
               <p>Where was old Frazer during this interesting colloquy?-where, indeed, but standing over by the window gnawing his lips, and forcing his nails into his clenched hands.</p> 
               <p>"My money I-my seven hundred golden guineas, John Edgeworth!" he gasped.</p> 
               <p>"There's your money, old Shylock!" Harry said, throwing a well-filled purse across the room. "And now, hark ye, quit! Well, yes, satisfy yourself, and count it. You'll find it right, for 'twas placed in there for you."</p> 
               <p>Old Frazer deliberately emptied the purse of its contents upon the table, and finding the sum to be correct, nervously thrust the coin and bills back into it, and turned to leave the apartment. In doing so, his foot struck the crown-piece which he had thrown to the sergeant on his entrance. He stooped down, and picking it up, hastened from the room without casting a glance behind him.</p> 
               <p>"Has he gone?" asked Mattie, fearfully raising her head from Harry's shoulder.</p> 
               <p>"He has, but somebody else is to come, Mattie," said Harry. As he spoke, Nancy came into the room, followed by a tall, handsome young fellow, who, no sooner had he perceived Mattie, than regardless of all present, he held her in his arms.</p> 
               <p>"So, Philip, my boy," laughed Harry, "you took me for a sergeant, and thought you really had 'listed?"</p> 
               <p>"He couldn't believe me for a long time, Mr. Harry, dear," sobbed Nancy. "I found him sitting so disconsolate in the little room where you left him."</p> 
               <p>"Took you for a sergeant, Harry," said Mrs. Edgeworth, eyeing his clothes-"and are you not one?"</p> 
               <p>"My dear mother," he answered, "I am not a soldier; and though I incur my father's displeasure, I confess I am an actor."</p> 
               <p>"Forgive me, my dear boy," John Edgeworth said, warmly pressing his son's hand. "I was too hasty in the past. I have long since overcome my foolish prejudice against the theatrical profession, and to convince you, I say that I would find a truly intellectual gratification in witnessing the powerful delineations of the great Warden to-morrow night."</p> 
               <p>"O goodness, gracious!" cried Nancy, clapping her hands. "Mr. Harry the great actor! O Miss Amy, can't you now be proud of him?"</p> 
               <p>"I trust she may," Harry said; and drawing Amy Bradley to his side, he exclaimed, "Since I have so well played the part of a sergeant, may my performance of a happy husband be far more successful, and, with the blessing of a kind Heaven, be longer upon the stage!"</p>

               <p>The <unclear>officer who</unclear> has the duty of "pounding" estray cattle is an efficient officer, and something of a wag in his way, and has, moreover, at times been made the victim of a "sell" by those who have been made sufferers by his vigilance. Not long since he received a notification from one of them, that "two horses had got into his lot which he wished to have him take away." Off started the field-driver, the two dollars looming up in goodly proportions before his mind's vision, and arrived on the spot to find two enormous wood horses, such as are used by masons in erecting stages to plaster ceilings of high rooms. He saw the "sell" at once, but at the same time determined that it should recoil upon the head of its author. So he employed a team, and taking the "horses" to the pound, put them in and turned the key upon them. He then advertised "two horses in the pound which the owner could have by paying charges." Seeing he was fairly caught, the other party called to take away the "horses," saying it was only a joke, etc. The officer felt and appreciated that, but "reckoned" he must have two dollars and costs of advertising before releasing them. The poundee didn't relish this denouement to the joke, and went off. It turned out the horses were not his, but had been left by some mason who had been jobbing for him, and who, coming for his horses, and not finding them, demanded their equivalent in cash-five dollars-which the other party had to pay.</p>

               <p>The court of Bavaria, at the beginning of the last century, set a bad example to the people on whose love and allegiance it made a claim that was but scurvily reverenced. The little delicate Electress Maria Amelia had the propensities of a gigantic <foreign xml:lang="FRA">roue</foreign>. She was delicate only in person, but mind and body were similarly "little" in other respects. She was an excellent shot, followed the chase with the zest of the keenest sportsman, and would toll half the day across ridge and furrow, or up to her knees in mud in pursuit of game, among which she made deadly havoc. At these times, and often when the occasion did not warrant for the fashion, she appeared in public in male attire, generally of green cloth, her brilliant complexion heightened by a brilliantly powdered white peruke. She loved dogs as well as she did men-and was never more pleased than when she dined in no better company than a dozen of these canine favorites, whose unceremonious clearing of the dishes, before the hostess could help herself, only excited her hearty laughter. There were occasions, however, on which she was given to anything rather than laughter, and chiefly when she encountered the favorites of her husband. On these she had no mercy; and her dog whip was more than once applied to the shoulders of shameless rivals, which had, perhaps, better have been applied to those of the unworthy husband.</p>

The cocks are spurred with bright pieces of steel, of about three inches long, and are as sharp as the best razor-indeed, they are generally made out of old razors; and frequently both birds He dead at the same moment. Sometimes an accidental blow from the inferior bird settles the question, for the spurs are deadly, and do not need much repetition to become effective. In general the handsomer bird was the coward, and the lesser and meaner-looking the hero and victor. The Indians are very cruel. Often they pluck a beaten cock alive, in revenge at his having lost, though the poor brute has been the petted and constant companion of his master for months before.</p>

               <p>In 1830 there was only one scientific man in all England who believed that a locomotive "would work"-had a sufficient hold on the rails to move a train. That man was Mr. Stephenson, the father of English railroads. Some people recommended working the cars, along the line, by water power. Some proposed hydrogen, others carbonic acid, others atmospheric pressure. One urged a plan for a greased road with cog rails; various kinds of steam power were suggested; and the directors were unable to choose between the conflicting schemes. At length the subject was referred to a select committee of engineers, who reported in favor of fixed engines in preference to locomotive power. Here was the result of all John Stephenson's labors! The two best practical engineers of the day concurred in reporting against the employment of the locomotive. Not a single professional man of eminence could be found to coincide with him in his preference for locomotive power. Stephenson, however, fought for the locomotive, and came out victor.</p>

               <p>"DON'T you think I've got a good husband, Charlotte? He's the best man in the world!"</p> 
               <p>The lady who made this interrogation and answered it in the same breath, in so inflated a style that her relations with the subject of her remark only excused it, was a warm-hearted, impulsive little woman, a wife of half a dozen years. She was sitting in the pleasant and tasteful, but by no means elegant, parlor of her friend, Mrs, Charlotte Dexter, and she had run in for a friendly call two days after Christmas. The ladies had been schoolmates, and the warm friendship of their girlhood had been continued and solidified after their marriage.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ripley and Mrs. Dexter had crossed a little beyond their thirtieth birthdays. Both were intelligent and agreeable women. Both had married men of worth and integrity, who by economy and strict business habits were making their way in the world, for neither had a fortune to commence with.</p> 
               <p>Now it happened that Mrs. Dexter's parlor communicated with her sitting room, that the door between them was ajar, and that just as Mrs. Ripley made the remark which opens our story, Mr. Dexter hung his coat on the hat-rack and walked into the sitting-room, and spread his hands over the pleasant grate fire, for they were blue with the cold. A smile, with a mixture of amusement and contempt, went over his face, which was on the whole an agreeable one, as he heard the remark of his wife's friend, which exalted one man at the expense of all the rest of his sex.</p> 
               <p>"That sounds just like a woman," he muttered to himself. "It's amusing to hear 'em talk. They deal in such tremendous adjectives!" But his cogitations on this feminine infirmity were cut short by the bright, earnest voice:</p> 
               <p>"Now you will think just as I do," it continued, "when I show you what be brought me home last Christmas."</p> 
               <p>"I shan't be brought to admit that he's better than Edward. You must make up your mind to that, Julia," subjoined a voice that somehow sounded just then particularly sweet in the listening ear of Edward Dexter.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, well, I'll make an exception in his favor, as it happens to be his wife to whom I am speaking;" and this was followed by a moment's silence, during which Mrs. Ripley had thrown aside the folds of her cloak, drawn a gold watch from her waist belt, and slipped it into Mrs. Dexter's hand.</p> 
               <p>"What, a gold watch?-why, Julia!" was the astonished exclamation which followed, as Mrs. Dexter lifted up the pretty timepiece and gazed at it admiringly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; isn't it a perfect beauty? I always liked that rich, plain chasing so much; and there's a gold cap inside, also," displaying the inside of her watch with that childlike sort of pleasure which always counts on sympathetic admiration and delight in the beholder. "You can't think, Charlotte, how perfectly taken back with amazement I was, when I found it in my stocking, which Willard had hung on the mantel, Christmas morning. I rubbed my eyes several times to be certain that I was awake."</p> 
               <p>"Well, you have got a kind husband, Julia, that is certain," cordially responded Mrs. Dexter; but somehow these words did not give quite so much pleasure to her husband as her former remark had done.</p> 
               <p>"Isn't he? I thought that such a gift these hard times was terribly extravagant, and told Willard so. But he said no; that the watch was a useful article, and that if we were ever reduced to selling it, it would probably bring nearly the money back which he gave for it; and he wanted me to have one present from him which I could look at and remember with peculiar pleasure, for his sake, all the days of my life; and, moreover, he said that I'd earned the watch, by the six years of steadfast economy I'd practised in my household."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I congratulate you, Julia, both on Willard and on the watch," responded Mrs. Dexter; and her husband felt a shade of sadness in her voice. He knew that it did not spring from any envy at her friend's good fortune. His wife was above such a pretty feeling, and would be generously glad in anything which brought pleasure to Mrs. Ripley.</p> 
               <p>"And now, did you have a pleasant Christmas, Charlotte?"</p> 
               <p>"O yes, but a quiet one." The tones were very "quiet," too, which ran along the words, and the husband felt that there were no warm, bright memories to give them color and animation. "I gave the day quite up to the children. Indeed, I was tired, sitting up so late the night before to dress Mary's doll, and I was out in the early part of the evening hunting up some toys for my boy and girl. You know how children's hearts are set on such things; and providing them always falls on me, because Edward is so hurried with business at this season of the year."</p> 
               <p>"It's just so with Willard. But I always coax him into giving me an hour or two for selecting the children's Christmas toys; and I believe he enjoys it as much as I do."</p> 
               <p>"I know it; but somehow I can't drag Edward away from the store-so that I have that part of the enjoyment to myself."</p> 
               <p>Probably Mrs. Dexter was not aware how much regret which touched on pain there was in her words, for she was too true and loving a wife to insinuate by look or tone anything which could reflect in the slightest degree on her husband, or give one the slightest reason to infer that he was not above reproach in all domestic relations and obligations. But Mrs. Ripley must have felt in the tones somewhat that her friend would never have acknowledged to her, for she said quickly, and in a half commiserating way:</p> 
               <p>"O well, you know, Charlotte, that men never think of these things as we do. Willard is quite a marvel for the interest he takes in such matters. But I've had to draw him into it, and take most of the credit to myself."</p> 
               <p>And then Mrs. Ripley looked at her watch, and saw that it was an hour later than she suspected, and rose at once to leave. Her friend did not detain her-<emph>she</emph> had no Christmas gilt to show.</p> 
               <p>Mrs, Dexter returned to the parlor, and busied herself in arranging the vases and books on the table, and her husband still stood with his hands spread before the grate fire, and an unusually thoughtful expression on his countenance. The truth is, he was annoyed and disturbed, for it was somewhat humiliating to feel that he had been brought into comparison with the husband of his wife's friend, and that the result had been unflattering to himself.</p> 
               <p>The man moved uneasily, and rubbed his hands briskly as this unwelcome thought intruded itself. Edward Dexter had a very comfortable degree of self-esteem. He held his own opinions with tenacity, and was not easily convinced that he could be mistaken or enlightened in any matter respecting which he had thoroughly made up his mind. Moreover, he was naturally of a somewhat practical tendency, and the mercantile life in which he was engrossed, had certainly been little calculated to develop that tender and healthful sentiment which gathers its sweet blossoms about one's home, and fills it with beauty and fragrance.</p> 
               <p>Edward Dexter meant to be a good husband, a loving and watchful father. He supplied the wants of his wife and family cheerfully, and for its sake, as he believed, devoted himself assiduously to his business; and he would have been amazed and indignant, if any one had insinuated that he was not above reproach in both of these relations.</p> 
               <p>But the dew and sunshine of tender and loving words did not fall softly day by day on the roots of that vine under whose shadows he sat. Its green and goodly tendrils were not full of the golden blossoms and fruits of all sweet and gracious ministrations, and the heart of his wife often ached with a dumb, sad, yearning pain for something of the lost sweetness of her youth. And there broke dimly into the mind of the husband and father, for the first time in all the years of his married life, a conception of this truth.</p> 
               <p>He remembered when Charlotte had suggested some Christmas presents for their boy and girl, that he had answered, hastily, "Nonsense, Charlotte! I've got business of more importance to attend to than hunting up baby-toys; besides, it's a foolish waste of money, any way, and I don't approve of indulging the children in such follies. You can do as you like about it, however." And remembering this speech, Edward Dexter recalled the pained look on his wife's face, and the words sounded cold and unsympathetic to him, as they did not at the time.</p> 
               <p>"Poor Charlotte!" he said to himself. And then his thoughts strayed back down the long avenue which wound through the past years of his married life. He saw Charlotte Dexter no more as the mistress of his home, the mother of his children-but he saw her in the joy and bloom of her maidenhood, when the shy roses first began to widen in her cheeks as she felt his glance on her face. He saw the brightness in her eyes, the smiles on her lips, and her breaks of light laughter went down in his heart like the ripple of pleasant waters. He saw her as she stood one morning in her youthful loveliness by his side, and once more the solemn voice of the minister, as he bound their lives into <unclear>one</unclear> with those holy words, "husband" and "wife," came back to him.</p> 
               <p>And then he remembered what a true and loyal wife Charlotte Dexter had been to him through all these years, what a fond and devoted mother; and as his gaze swept over the years, he felt that all the right and holy claims of her womanhood had not been recognized-that there must have been many hours when her woman's heart had ached for sympathies and appreciation which she had never received. There must have been something chilly and barren in her life, for which his own rose up and rebuked him. And it was not enough that he could say to himself, "I have been a careful provider, a kind husband to my wife, a good father to my children."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Edward, how long have you been home?"</p> 
               <p>These words were the first which startled the husband from his reverie. He turned from the fire, and saw his wife standing near him, the first surprise on finding him there not quite gone out of her face. He looked at her with a new tenderness and interest. Maternity had paled the roses in her cheeks, and the soft hazel eyes had lost something of their lustre. They had a chastened expression, and the lips, though they were sweet ones still, had not the old smile drifting about and breaking over them, as though her heart was like a fountain which ran over with sweet-leaping waters.</p> 
               <p>The face of Charlotte Dexter was not unhappy, but there was some brightness gone out of it, for which, in that moment of revelation, Edward Dexter held himself responsible.</p> 
               <p>"I came in a little while ago. Aren't you feeling well, Charlotte?"</p> 
               <p>"O yes, quite as usual. What makes you ask me, Edward?"</p> 
               <p>He had detected a little shadow on her face when he first saw her, and he guessed rightly that she was thinking of the Christmas gift of her friend.</p> 
               <p>"Because you are not looking quite so bright as I like to see you, my dear little wife."</p> 
               <p>The tones and the words were not like those which Charlotte Dexter was accustomed to. She looked up in surprise, and as she met the smile and tenderness in her husband's eyes, a change came over her face. There was a quick leap of brightness, like that which he remembered in her girlhood, and then it melted suddenly in a gush of tender feelings, and the tears stood bright in her hazel eyes.</p> 
               <p>The sight moved Edward Dexter strangely. He put his arm around his wife's waist, and drew her to him and kissed her as he used to in the old days before she had belonged to him.</p> 
               <p>Charlotte Dexter drew a long breath, much like a tired, grieved child who has been watching long for its mother and sees her at last. She laid her head down on his shoulder, and the sobs came thick and fast, and every one which shook to and fro her slender frame went to the heart of her husband, as he held her tightly and tried to comfort her.</p> 
               <p>"God forgive me!" said the man to himself, in his sudden self-abasement. "He has given me a great and precious gift, which I have not half appreciated nor understood."</p> 
               <p>At last the lady looked up, and a smile trembled out through her tears.</p> 
               <p>"You took me so by surprise, Edward, that I was overcome completely."</p> 
               <p>"Well, darling, if kind words affect you like this, it is unmistakable proof that I am very <unclear>remiss</unclear> on my part. But dry up those tears, now, for they are a reproach to me."</p> 
               <p>"O Edward, it does my heart good to have you speak to me in that way!" and she clung to him.</p> 
               <p>"Charlotte," said her husband, with a gush of feeling which fairly choked his voice, "you have been the best and truest wife that ever a man had, and I haven't half deserved you."</p> 
               <p>Just at that moment the dinner-bell rang, and the "boy and girl" burst into the room, hungry and vociferous. But something in their parents' tones subdued the children. And Edward Dexter thought it had been long since the face of his wife had worn such a radiant brightness as it did that day at dinner!</p> 
               <p>"Charlotte shall have a New Year's present. It will be the first one that I ever gave her-poor child!" murmured Edward Dexter to himself, on his way to the store the morning before New Year's. "I don't know what in the world to get her, though," mused the man; "she don't want a watch, for her brother gave her that pretty one on his return from California, after our marriage. And a brooch? No, she's got the pearl one. What <emph>shall</emph> it be?" Suddenly a conversation, which he had partially heard in an abstracted mood, between Charlotte and her dressmaker the week before, recurred to him.</p> 
               <p>"You'll have hard work to get the waist and sleeves out of this, Mrs. Dexter," said the dressmaker, after a thorough inspection of the green silk which the lady had given her.</p> 
               <p>"I know I shall, Miss Gray. But I can't afford to get a new silk, and I must turn the old one and make it do. We must set our wits to work and get it out in some fashion. You know they wear tight sleeves now, and I can afford half a breadth from the skirt."</p> 
               <p>"She shall have a new silk dress, and a handsome one!" was the audible conclusion of Edward's cogitations, as he struck the heel of his boot down hard on the pavement.</p> 
               <p>"A happy New Year to you, Charlotte?" and the young husband dropped something done up in brown wrappers into his wife's lap.</p> 
               <p>It was a beautiful morning, and like the flash of golden-winged birds came the sunbeams of the newly-born year, with joy and blessing into the home of Edward Dexter.</p> 
               <p>"Is this for <emph>me</emph>, Edward?" asked his wife, her face full of surprised pleasure.</p> 
               <p>"For you, dear."</p> 
               <p>Her rapid fingers broke the small cord in a moment, and then the dress rolled out. It was a rich, dark brown silk, overshot with lustrous green leaves and buds, a most graceful design.</p> 
               <p>"Do you like it, Charlotte?"</p> 
               <p>"O Edward, I never in my life saw such a beauty! Is it really for me?"</p> 
               <p>"'Really' for you, my dear wife."</p> 
               <p>She tried to thank him, but the tears overmastered her voice.</p> 
               <p>"Mamma, mamma, let us see!" and the two bright-haired children bounded into the room.</p> 
               <p>Her face was radiant through her tears as she lifted up the fabric.</p> 
               <p>"It's mamma's New Year's present, my children."</p> 
               <p>"What makes you cry, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Don't trouble mamma now, my little girl and boy," said the father, slipping his arm around his wife. There was a new light in his face.</p> 
               <p>"Papa, <emph>you</emph> look happy, if mamma does cry," said his little boy, sidling up to him.</p> 
               <p>"I am, my child. It shall be, please God, a happy New-Year to all of us."</p> 
               <p>And it was! O husband and father, see to it that you make for you and yours also a Happy New Year!</p>

               <head>TROPICAL HUMMING-BIRDS.</head> 
               <p>These bright little beings. in the sunshine and gleam flash with a brilliancy as perfect as that of the many gems after which they are named. An enumeration of some of their names will convey an idea of their appearance-sapphire-throated, ruby throated, sapphire and emerald, amethystine, topaz-throated; then there are the purple, tricolored, violet-tufted, violet-crowned, blue-fronted, the superb, the magnificent, the sabre-winged. And there is one which must have been bestowed by some ornithological phrenologist, who had great skill in interpreting the natural language of birds-the supercilious humming-bird. The largest species yet discovered is what is called gigantic, and the smallest, one that Sir William Jardine describes as Gould's humming-bird. The gigantic is in remarkable contrast to the rest of his tribe, both in size and in color of plumage. He is not only the largest but the homeliest, while the smallest is the most beautiful. The gigantic (the monster!) is nearly eight inches in length; the crown, the back, the under and lesser wing-coverts brownish-green, with reflections of green tint; the under parts light reddish mingled with a deeper tint and shaded off with green; the feathers are generally darker at the base, and the paler tips give a slightly waved appearance to the breast. On the throat, the feathers, though without lustre, retain the scaly form and texture of the more brilliant species. The wings slightly exceed the tall in length, bent up at the tips, and exhibit the form of the most correctly framed organ of flight; they are of a uniform brownish violet. The tale is composed of ten feathers, of a brownish color, and with golden green reflections; they gradually decrease in length, Gould's is the smallest species, and of the most dazzling beauty. It is scarcely over two inches in length; its forehead, throat and upper part of its breast, are of a most brilliant green; the feathers of a scaly form. From the crown springs a crest of bright chestnut feathers, of a lengthened form, and capable of being raised at pleasure. The back is of a golden green, crossed with a whitish band; the wings and tale are brownish purple, the latter having the centre feathers tinged with green. The neck tufts are of the most splendid kind, and have a chaste but brilliant effect; they are composed of narrow feathers of a snowy whiteness, the tips of each having a round serrated spot of bright emerald green, surrounded with a dark border; the largest are at the upper part of the tuft, and they decrease in length, assuming the shape of a butterfly's wing; shorter feathers again spring from the base, and their green tips are relieved on the white of the longer ones behind them. The most common species, and that which abounds in all parts of the West Indies, is the ruby-crested. Though seen every day in the gardens, it presents some of the most splendid coloring of the family.</p>

               <p>The velvet moss grown on a sterile rock, the mistletoe flourishes on the naked branches, the ivy clings to the moldering vines, the pine and cedar remain fresh and fadeless amid the mutations of the receding year; and Heaven be praised, something beautiful to see, and grateful to the soul, will, in the darkest hour of fate, still twine its tendrils around the crumbling altars of the desolate temples of the human heart.</p>
