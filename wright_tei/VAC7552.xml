IT was a sultry evening, and against the rail- ing of a vessel bound for the Brazils, a boy and girl were lounging together, looking down upon the glassy blue expanse. Slowly the often idly flapping sails had borne them on from far- off English shores; for the Stormy Petrel. could hardly have been expected to skim the waters lightly with such a burden of heavy hearts on board. It was fifty years ago, when the tide of emigration set for awhile toward South American lands, andoemigrants carry with them a weight of regret for their native country, no matter what hopes they may have for -the new home before them.  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7552-00000006"/> 12      SE A-DRIFT. The two young people were full of those hopes now. They had been aboard the vessel long enough to be very eager for the near pros- pect of land. Only some few days now, and they might hope to see the distant coast. And although they were to keep still southward, even to Rio Janeiro, yet it seemed quite ime to ,be making their plans for terra firna. They were chatting away excitedly, when the girl's glance fell on a boy, apparently rather more than a year older than she, who was leaning on the railing a short -distance from the brother and sister. But while their gaze was turned in the direction of the strange and beautiful country, yet unseen, toward which every breath of the faint breeze brought them nearer, Morgan Dare's dark eyes followed with a mournful wist- fulness the shining wake of the vessel, as if there was little for him to look forward to. The girl watched him for a moment--then touched her brother. * "Oh, Evan, I do pity him so!" she said. "Won't you speak to him? ' See- I'm sure he brushed away a tear then, though he does   SEA-DRIFT.       13 keep his back to us all the while. I wonder if he is homesick and lonely. He does n't seem to know a soul on board. I do wish you would say something to him, Evan." 'Evan Grafton, a tall, handsome boy of four- teen, laid his hand on the shoulder of his little twin sister, and smiled down into her uplifted deep-blue eyes. "You 're a good girl, Eva, and no mistake," he returned. "But why don't you go and speak to him yourself? Poor fellow, yol would do him (fiore good than i, I 'm sure." Morgan Dare was still watching the sunny ripple, all clouded over by his sombre thoughts, when a voice at his side interrupted him. "Are you not glad," it said, in tones quiver- ing a little through bashfulness, " that we shall soon leave this tiresome old ship? There will be so many new, strange things to see on land, that we won't have so much time to long for home." He turned, and saw the rosy face upraised to hitre the fair brow shaded by clustering golden curls, beneath which shone those eyes, 2  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7552-00000007"/> SEA-DRIFT a so soft with sympathy. He smiled, and lifted his cap. "Of course I ought to be glad," he answered; ( and yet I am not. It seems as if this Stormy Petrel were the last link to my own country. There are, as you say, so -many new, strange things in the country we are going to; that it- can never be in the least like home to me." "Did n't you wish to come, then?" the girl asked, wonderingly. "Ah, you are all alone here; you have left your relations behind," Evan said, joining in the conversation, with his arm on Eva's shoulder. "Yes, I am alone here; but then I am alone everywhere," returned Morgan. "My father is dead. I don't remember my mother, and I never had any sister," he added, looking at Eva. "So I had nobody to grieve for my coming away to seek my fortune." "'How are you going to do that?" asked Evan..       . "Haven't the slightest idea. I am from Canada; and when--when I was left alone there, I remembered a brother of my mother's-   SEA-DRIFT.       iS in London, anid came over to find him out. His name is Smith -John Smith," he went out, with a laugh. "And as far as the name went I might have claimed kindred with half of London. But the John Smith was not to be found; and I found myself adrift in the great city, with slim purse, and never a friend. I had looked forward to my uncle's finding me em- ployment, perhaps turning me into a sort of sailor, for he is a merchant in some foreign trade. But in ny search for him among the shipping, I onleFound this cargo of colonists for South America. It seemed a way open to me, for my money was nearly gone, and I could see no way to make any more. So I 've paid my passage, and after that I can work, of course. I am strong enough for most any thing, though I haven't much beyond a hunter's knowledge." "From Canada!" cried Eva; "then are you not glad to get out of the cold into another climate?" "Don't you like ice and snow? don't you like sleighing and skating?" he replied, by another question. age  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7552-00000008"/> i6      SEA-DRIFT. "I can't tell." The brother and sister de- liberated. "We never saw snow, nor ice, nor sleighs, nor skates." "Wh where have you lived? not in Eng- land, surely?" "You from Canada-- we from India," re- joined Eva; "funny enough, isn't it, how the Stormy Petrel should bring two such extremes together? Papa went out to India, and met mamma, and married her there. Papa was in the civil service. We children never saw England till the early spring of this same year. Papa belongs to a great mercantile firm in England-like your uncle's, maybe. It has one branch in India, and wanted to start another in South'America; so papa offered to go; for mamma found England, even in spring, so cold; and so did we all, too. Luti, our old Indian Ayah, who has lived with us always, is so glad-you can't imagine how glad; and so we all are, too. You see, we had never seen our English relations before, and they are not near relations, and everything seemed so strange to us there."   SEA-DRIFT.       17 "And where are you going when you get to South America?"Morgan asked. "Oh, we shall have any number of adven- tures, I do hope!" cried Evan, his eyes kindling. "' We will go down the coast to Rio Janeiro - the Stormy Petrel is bound there, you know- and there mamma and Eva and the little chil- dren will stay, while papa and I explore about. We'll have a little country-seat just outside of the city. I think I can tell what it will be like: orange-groves and palms just like our old home; and forests of cocoanut-trees, fall of monkeys, and tigers, and-and wild Indians." "Hush, Evan," cried Eva; "if you tell me all this, you will have to leave me in Rio Janeiro for ever and a day. I'm afraid of almost every- thing, and, above everything, of an Indian. To be sure, the tame ones weren't very dreadful in India; but don't you think the wild ones worse than, the tigers?" she appealed to her new fr'end. "We seldom found them troublesome," he said. "We used to go in and out among them a great deal in hunting, and my father would - a*    B  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7552-00000009"/> l8     1 SEA-DRIFT. often rest in their wigwams, and, instead of tradingliquor to them, like too many trappers, would tell them of the Bible, and many things that made them think him a very wise man, a medicine-man, as they call those among them whom they believe magicians." "Oh, but I have read so many horrible sto- ries about their burning houses and massacring whole villages!" cried Eva. "And I know of one or two dreadful instances, of their cruelty," said Morgan. "What can you expect of heathen who are just beginning to learn what is right and true? But look - look yonder-there is something with much more terror in it than savages have for me. This is the first time I was ever on the sea, but I am much mistaken if there is not mischief brewing.'" While the three had been talking together, a sudden change had come upon the weather. The sea, just now so placid, lashed itself to fury befores the rising gale, and waves, black, yet strangely tinged with sulphurous foam, tossed in the wake of the vessel.- In the dis- tance, and as if in chase, a great black cloud, a       SEA-DRIFT.       I9 like an enormous bird of prey, flapped as it were its outspread inky wings, and whirled around, while the day grew murkier -far murkier than befitted the hour, which was just waning to sunset. In an instant all was confusion. Through the shrill, wild soughing of the wind, arose the shouted commands of the captain, and the "Ay, ay, sir!" answers of the sailors. The passengers crowded down the hatchway. Evan and his new friend were gazing round in excited wonder, and Eva in undefined fear, when she (felt a hurried touch upon her shoulder. "Mamma! what is the matter?" she cried as she turned.  For the lady who stood beside her was as white as death. But she answered very quietly: "Come, children, I have been looking all over the vessel for you. Come below at once."  "Mamma, is it a storm?"Evan cried, ex- citedly. "I fear so, my boy. I rely upon you two not to add to thee confusion in the cabin, but to help me to keep the children quiet. Your father is  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7552-00000010"/> 'O      SEA-DRIFT. with the captain. Will you not come too?" -he added to Morgan. But he only thanked the gentle lady, and re-,  mained above, much to Evan's envy, though  that was intermingled with a tinge of alarm. Below, all was confusion indeed, children screaming, pale women wringing their hands,  and listening as if each moment they expected to hear the billows, now dashing against the vessel's sides, rush overwhelmingly above. Eva's i mother was soon among her flock of little ones;  five girls, the eldest only eight- like tiny steps, some fair like the mother and Eva, some dark like theirfather and Evan. Eva and Evan soon  had their hands and almost their hearts full,  trying to amuse them, and to prevent their  j adding to the Babel of voices; for the old  g Ayah was perfectly helpless, crouched in a  corner, her dark face bleached with terror until  it was as pale and yellow as her turban. The mother, faint and ill, lay on a sofa, hushing her year old baby in her arms. Evan was for- cing himself into a suppressed romp of hunt- j the-slipper with Rosy, his special pet, of three.    SEA-DRI FT.       21 Madge's, Grace's, -and Louise's great black eyes were stretched to their utmost, as they leaned their chubby arms on Eva's lap, absorbed in one after another of Ayah Luti's old Hindoo tales, which Eva was recounting. But after a time, the children's interest flagged.. "Rosy," Eva said, as the little one half opened her Sleepy blue eyes, "are you not going to say your prayer to God to take care of us all to-night? Come, my darling: 'Our Father'-" But just as she was lifting the child to its knees, the cabih-door was opened, and her father came in hastily, with several of the other gentlemen. Meantime, upon the deck; Morgan Dare had at first pressed frward to offer his services to the captain. But finding that -those alone could be useful who had some experience in sea-faring, he withdrew apart, leaning against a mast, and watching the on-coming of the storm. He soon saw this was no ordinary storm. Black clouds were veering about in opposite directions across the blue of the sky -veering  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7552-00000011"/> 22      SEA-DRIFT. with fierce though uncertain fury, while the sea below foamed and eddied with a hissing, seeth- ing sound. Second by second the waves rose and rose, until, in a time too brief for wonder, the two black clouds had rushed together from their opposite courses, and the winds had cught the ocean up to meet them. The young watcher there, still holding by the mast, had never seen a water-spout, but he knew instinctively that this was one. Fast and faster whirled the cloud, now white with water, leaning from the sky. Fast and faster whirled the circling waves, uprising from the sea. And then they met together with increasing noise; and stretched, a tapering, gigantic column, from the heavens to the ocean, while the waters hissed and frothed and bubbled at its base. The heavens had never seemed so far away from earth as when that wondrous colu n rose up, measuring the height. The boy thought of the Red Sea's wall of waters as his eyes rested upon this. With mighty, rushing sound, the column now began to move forward, every in- stant diminishing the half-mile which first had spread between it and the ship. /   SEA-DRIFT.       23 All hands on board had been striving for dear life to turn the vessel out of the water- spout's course. And they had so far succeeded that the fearful mass now passed by to their right, while a cheer went up from every heart, from all those white and rigid lips. But alas! that cheer went up before the peril passed. For just beyond the laboring ship, the column burst with a loud noise, and lashed the sea on every side to fury. The billows surged against the ship; the winds swept over it, and would have overturned it, but that instantly the masts were cut away, and the hulk floated, a helpless wreck, upon the black, tempestuous waste. The watcher just might see the long, white, spiral line that drew up slowly from the scat- tered column into the skies from which it had descended -when night fell suddenly over the brief twilight of the tropics. All was im- fenetrable darkness now--until the storm in- creased, and red serpentine flashes clave it asunder, to light up the yawning:illows tossing to and fro the helpless ship.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7552-00000012"/> 24      SEA-DRIFT. And as the hours went by, that ship was worse than helpless. It had sprung a leak, and the men at the pumps could do but little to delay the fate which seemed every moment to be threatening every one on board. The old, experienced seamen said the wreck could hardly live an hour more. But happily, the utmost violence of the storm was over, To those, indeed, who had not seen it in its height, it still would have appeared most fearful; but there was now at least a hope that the boats might save fhe passengers and crew. The masts had not fallen without sweeping the deck of what lay in their road, so that there remained but two boats. They were, however, sufficient to receive every one on board, pro- vided that order could be preserved in filling them, so that neither should be overcrowded. For this purpose, to prevent a rush, the captain and Eva's father, who had been the captain's right hand through that night, took their station in front of the boats ready to be lowered, each with loaded pistols, to force back the throng until the women and children should be cared for.   SEA-DRIFT..      25 And just at this juncture it was that the cabin- door opened below, and the men appeared, to take their wives and others of the ladies and children on deck. Eva, Evan, their mother and all the little ones were gathered at their father's left hand. The old Ayah, indeed, was not there; but no one noticed her absence, she had been so in- efficient during the whole excitement. Evan had led her up the cabin-stairs, and then, turn- ing to take Madge from his mother, had bidden her follow. But while they all thought she was among them, the poor wretch, senseless with terror, had shrunk back from the nearer sound- ing of the winds and waves, and went down again to hide, with a feelin of security, in her old corner in the cabin. Every one else was now on deck. The dark was too intense to mark the throng of pallid, anxious faces; but the many hearts beat as one, fast woth hope and terror; and the crowd all swayed together, holding by each other, as the vessel lurched with eveiymountain-wave. Just then there was a momentary lull, and  3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7552-00000013"/> 26      SEA-DRIFT. little Rosy's voice rang out upon the hush. She was folded warmly in her nother's arms, and therefore knew no fear- although the men and women near her, knowing their Almighty Father's arms are round them everywhere, for- got to lean on Him for safety. "Mamma,"-the clear child-voice was lisping, --"is it dark night still? And must I go to sleep again? But, oh, mamma! I have not said my prayers; I only just began." And while the winds were laid, and the waves seemed to pause and only sob, the child's prayer rose to " our Father which art in heaven." Silence ensued. And then the captain's sol- emn tones: "Friends, the child prays for us all. May God our Father hear, and 'deliver us from evil, for His is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever.'  The deep Amen that followed was fervent, and instant as if uttered by one mouth. And then the boats were lowered, and men and women, on the very brink of a yawning grave, yet awed into calm by the influence of that   SEA-DRIFT.       27 child-prayer, silently took the places assigned them. The first boat was full, and had pushed off, with the Stormy Petrel's captain in command.  The second was also laden, under the charge of Eva's father, who now sprang into it. "Push off, my men!" he cried; "and, God be praised, not one is left behind!". The vivid lightning, as he ended, lit up the scene. From the other side of the-vessel the long-boat had already made its way, and no living being moved upon the deck. The flash defined against the darkness that manly figure in the last boat, and the anxious faces all turned toward him, listening for his words. His wife glanced away to look upon her treasures saved around her; and as she did so, a shriek panted from her lips. "Eva! merciful God! Eva is not here!" Another flash, and every gaze sought the missing child. No! Eva was not the -too surely was not there. , "The other boat--" several voices suggested. But the mother shook her head. "She was at my side after the other boat  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7552-00000014"/> 28      SF A SEA-DRIFT. pushed off," she gasped. "We must, we must go back for her." There was scarcely a sound of dissent. A few there were who might have murmured, had there been a voice to lead; but there was none, and they were silent. So the boat pushed back. But as it neared the sinking vessel, the eddy in the waters round it, and the beating of the billows over it like surf, made approach impos- sible. "My little Eva!" groaned the father. The word of command faltered on his lips, when the oarsmen said they dared approach no nearer. For he could not forget that he had taken upon himself the responsibility of every one of these lives, and that he would be no less than la murderer should he now urge them on to cer- tain death. "My little Eva!" This time he shouted. But there came no answer. And madly he sprang4orward, and would have plunged over- board, had not a dozen arms seized him and dragged him back. But even as they dragged him back, there came a plunge indeed. And the mother's voice wailed out again:   S E A,- D R I F T.   29 "Evan! The boy gone too!" For as Evan had become aware that his sister was missing, back upon him came an indistinct memory, a confused idea, that, while he stood beside her, just before their turn had come to take their places in the boat, he had heard her say something about the old nurse. And as he looked round in the lightning-flash, and saw that Luti was not among her little charge, he became convinced that Eva, her pet, must have gone back to find her. And the boat was push- ing off again, leaving her to her fate. A vision of that tender, petted sister all un- aided, and a feeling that if she must perish, it would be his own neglect that killed her, roused him to plunge in, remembering only that he was a good swimmer, and forgetful that, in such a sea as this, that could avail nothing to her, nor even to himself. He was gone too. But in the confusion and the darkness, no one noticed that yet another plunge was made. The struggling father was. held fast by friendly hands; the children hung upon the mother. But Morgan Dare, the forlorn 3*  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7552-00000015"/> 30      S E A- D R I FT. stranger, to whom the brother and sister had that day given a few kindly words and thoughts out of the abundance of their happiness, had thrown his life into the effort to aid them, or to perish with them.           I The boat lingered for some moments more. A dozen arms were stretched forth gropingly in the darkness, and the oarsmen ventured just upon the verge of certain destruction. But it was of no avail. And now the boat moved off, as heavily as the hearts beat within it, while the mother lay unconscious in the arms of friends, -who mercifully made no effort to arouse her. And the father took the helm in mute despair, and steered the boat away to safety. Meantime, a kindly wave had swept the two boys on together, and with breathless effort young Dare had grasped his almost drowning friend. But to make for the boat again, even though it lay not far, was quite impossible, be- cause they were caught up by the billows which were dashing on the wreck. And so it was that, senseless and half drowned, the two, locked in each other's arms, were thrown together on the wreck.   CHAPTER II. ADRIFT ON THE SEA. HOURS went by, and, contrary to the old seamen's predictions, probably because it was lightened of its load of passengers, the wreck still floated on the waters. Hours went by, and then the dawn came grayly up across the billows, raging still as they had raged last night. The faint light fell across the listless figures of a fair young girl and an Indian woman lashed together to the shivered fragment of a 'mast which kept its place on deck-lashed as the girl's own hand had done in the darkness. And almost at their feet, that ghastly light of dawn fell too upon a ghastly sight--two seemingly lifeless forms, tossed where the railing kept the waves from -snatching them  back into their power again. The girl saw, and addressed her trembling '  - : ' 3I  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7552-00000016"/> 32      SEA-DR I FT. fingers to the task, which seemed unending, of unfastening the cords that bound her to her place. Then she staggered across t where those two were lying, and sank dowr on her knees beside them. "Evan! O Evan!" she wailed. "Oh, if he should be dead!" But at her cry his eyes unclosed. Weak and bruised and exhausted, he could only stretch his arms out toward her, and she sank, sobbing out her gratitude, upon his breast. And when his companion too stirred, and saw that all were safe, three happier hearts could nowhere be found. Nowhere-although their limbs were cramped and bruised, and, as the day wore on, the old hulk: still lurched too uncertainly to make it safe for them to leave their place in order to seek provisions. So all that day was spent, and all- that night. Hunger and thirst were joined to weariness, but not until the morning of another day rose clear and calm did they find it possible to stir. Eva was awake first upon that morning. She rose and stretched her weary limbs, and moved   SEA-DRIFT.       33 about the deck, which alone floated high, but hardly yet dry, above a sea of silvered glass, across which the sun from the far east was flinging long, unbroken lines of gold and rose. Her-first act was to go across to her nurse, whom for four-and-twenty hours she had not dared to visit. The poor woman had been stu- pefied with fear, but when her pet now came to her, and called her by her name, and tenderly unbound the cords, releasing her, she looked up with a burst of tears. She wept long thus, while Eva knelt beside, speaking soothing, cheering words from time to time. And then once more she became calm, and could listen to what her little mistress ]had to say. Some one else too was listening. Morgan Dare had raised himself on one arm, and was gazing with enthusiastic admiration on the fairy figure in its limp, white dress, with the dripping, golden curls, which yet would wave so richly in despite of wet, and the blue eyes which shone like the morning, as brightly as though never dimmed in tears. She was saying: C  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7552-00000017"/> 34      OSEA-D RIFT. "Yes, Ayah Luti, mamma and papa are both safe, with every one of the children, and every one of the passengers and crew too. And God is very good to us. We ought to thank him for this beautiful day. For now, whenever a ship shall take papa on board, he can make it turn about and look for us. You know they can see so far over the clear waters, and I should not think they could be a great way off; so we can floatS here quite safely, until they. overtake us. Perhaps we shall reach Brazil first,- after all. But I art so hungry! Are not you? I'll go wake the boys, and see if they can tell us what to do about that." But Morgan Dare had roused Evan already, and the three, followed by the servant, now went forward to examine into the state of the Stormy Petrel. Truly, it, wont once to skim the waters like a sea-bird, had its white wings clipped; and not only that, but the whole body torn asunder, until there only remained a part of a deck, with a great gulf torn in the midst, where the cabin had been swept away by the furious. billows of the tempest. There was   SEA-DRI FTr.      35 nothing on the deck, save broken planks, and fragments which had been hurled up, and then detained there by the shattered railing of the guards. So the only thing to be done was to dive down into the gulf which might be the hold of the vessel, and seek their fortunes theie, as Morgan said. - "But, oh! you will get so wet-and no other clothing--no fire to dry by--" began Eva. "But a fiery furnace above us," returned Morgan, laughing. "Now, if we only had the luck to find a floating ham, we would be at no loss to broil ilt." "Morgan, Morgan, don't talk about hams," cried Evan,' pulling off his jacket preparatory to his plunge; "the very mention increases my thirst." Eva had been gazing down intently into the water they were about to explore. The mass of fragmentspiled up half over it by the waves, threw a dark shade above, and it was impossible to see whether the great hole had a bottom. She shuddered as the boys plunged in, one after the other, with a heart-sickening fear that  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7552-00000018"/> 36r o     SEA-DR I FT. ,the current might sweep them away from the opening, and that, unable to find it again, they might struggle, struggle - sink -there in the dark. But she was reassured the instant after they disappeared with a splash from her sight. They rose again, hallooed that all was right, and then dived once more. )   Two or three times they reappeared at the surIface, with the dreary tidings that they had found nothing-that there was a lateral hole beaten in, through which their longed-for spoils had probably been washed( out. But at last Evan rose with a cheer, and Morgan presently followed him. This time, -groping in all direc- tions, they had clutched two floating prizes-a wooden box and an iron-bound cask; both small, however. "Too small for water," muttered Morgan. And, without a moment's hesitation, down he plunged again.    - Evan imitated him, and the two boys did not finally emerge until they were convinced, be- yond the shadow of a doubt, that, after a float- ing, battered, old sailor's hat, and a large ban-  *    SEA-DRI FT.       37 danna stuffed in the lining, which was handed over to the old woman, no more in the way of spoilsremained. Evan would have flagged in the search, but Morgan urged him to further trial, reminding him that, were anything left, the current rushing through the hole in the side might carry it away before another day. At last they splashed up again on deck, shak- ing themselves in the sun, and declaring that they felt wonderfully refreshed, but most cer- tainly ready for anything box or cask might contain. To work they went at once, with Morgan's pocket-knife and a hatchet which had been en- tangled in the fragments from the wreck. The box was attacked first. It contained ship- biscuit, but having been opened for use, it had not been carefully secured, and was about half full ofsea-water. When this was poured off, the biscuitwas found reduced to a salted paste- which, however, was thought very eatable by the famished four, who at once eagerly break- fasted upon it. ' But, oh! I am so thirsty!"Eva cried pres- 4  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7552-00000019"/> 38      SEA-DRIFT. ently. "Now, if that cask is only full of water!" Evan shook his head, but turned the6spigot without a word. He was right. The anxious faces peering in lengthened instantly; for there trickled out, not water, but wine, and little enough of that, too. "We must be saving of this," said Morgan, as he drew off some in his canteen, and held it to Eva's lips. "'Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink;' so this must be made to hold out until we reach land, or are picked up. And how soon that may be--" - He stopped short, but began again cheerfully: "Will you give the provisioning of the crew into my hands? I know something of scouting- party half-rations, and promise not quite to starve you, though I must put you on short al- lowance. But if you give it into my hands, I won't have any interference whatever.'* ' He ended with a smile, and they consented. Only the Ayah said piteously: "Can't we have as much as we can eat, then? It's just no more'n fit to throw into the sea, anyway."   SEA-DRIFT.  X    39 "Oh, Luti, it's delicious!" cried Eva, gayly; "and so we must keep a little for mamma when she finds us." Morgan said nothing of his doubts whether with the utmost care that slender stock could be made to last until "mama" or any one else "finds us"- or of his fears that the two boats with their loald of passengers might not have4 weathered through that horrible night. He believed that hope would do much toward aiding the scanty food in preserving life in those whom he had resolved to take under his guid- ance and control. That day passed cheerily away. All had a fuller meal allowed them, because they were weak with fasting, and the boys worn with their morning's exertions; though Morgan, indeed, appropriated less than he portioned out to the others.- Morgan contrived, with a piece of cordage which he had found, to hang both cask and box just above the water in the hole from which they had been fished up, and where they were sheltered from the heat of the sun. And all but Morgan lay down to sleep that night  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7552-00000020"/> 40  .    SEA-DRIFT. hopeful as well as refreshed. But Morgan rose and paced the deck for hours after all other eyes were closed. He paused where Eva lay so peacefully slumbering, her golden head pil- lowed- on her round, white arm; and where the old servant slept curled up at her feet. "Evan and I may manage to win through," he muttered; "but how these two can stand it, I dare not think. O ,God! help me to save them all." His prayer seemed to bring peace to him too, at last; and he fell asleep, remembering that God had wonderfully saved them all in peril yet more imminent, and that His way is in the sea, His path in the great waters.   CHAPTER III. A CAPFUL OF JELLY. THE  next day, and the three following, passed by much the same. The daily ra- tion distributed by Morgan had still been suffi- cient to satisfy the keenest cravings of hunger and thirst; but now the seventh day since their wreck had come, and Morgan seeing no sign of land, or any but vague hope of rescue, had resolved to diminish the already scanty allow- ance both of food and drink, seeing that at the present rate both must be soon exhausted. Luti's was the only dissenting voice at this de- cision; but Eva soon soothed her half inaudible murmurs, and herself smiled bravely upon Mor- gan, whose rations had from the beginning been as small as those he now portioned out for the others. But in spite of her gentle submission and Evan's resolute indifference, the hearts of 4 * ,            41  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7552-00000021"/> 42      SEA-DRIFT. one and all were sinking, and for the first time hope seemed very faint and far away. It was verging on toward sunset. Eva was lying in the shadow of the rude shed which the boys had erected as a shelter from the noon- tide blaze; and as she lay, the tears were slowly trickling through her half-closed lids, for Evan was whistling "Britannia, rule the waves," as he idly beat the time upon the deck. Thoughts of home, and of the faces she was beginning to feel she, should never see again, thronged fast, and brought the sobs she was striving to keep back. Morgan, with one glance at her, had turned aiay, and was restlessly striding up and down, his head bowed, and his gaze fixed upon the planks, when a loud exclamation from the Ayah roused them all: ( Missy - children - only look a-yonder! Where 'pon earth all that calves-foot jelly come from?" "Calves-foot jelly!"All the hungry ones sprang forward, eyes and mouth wide open, quite ready for the moment to swallow any such de- licious story. And, indeed, it seemed as if   SEA-DRIFT.       43 Luti had spoken truth. Eva, in her bewil- derment, began to think of the wondrous fairy of Holiday House, whose fountains tossed up lemonade, and whose trees shook' down burnt almonds. Were those gardens somewhere in the tropic seas? For surely there did stretch before her one vast flood of jelly. Far as the eye could reach, that purple-pink floated behind the be- calmed wreck. It came on and on, far faster than the current. But alas! Evan had seen the same thing on the passage from India one day, when Eva had been too ill to see any- thing. So he cried now: "Sea-nettles, Luti! Have one? -St'mg like the mischief, I can tell you. What, you won't believe?" And, as presently the vast shoal was close upon the Stormy Petrel, Evan stooped, and with the old sailor-hat scooped up one of the crea- tures. There it lay, indee like a mass of jelly, four or five inches in dia neter, and of a changeable violet and rose, with slender, waving tails, as Luti would call them, a yard long. "Poor thing!" cried Eva, bending over.  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7552-00000022"/> "      SEA-DRIFT. "Your jelly, Ayah dear, looks as if it were melt- ing away in the sun. Put it back in the water, Evan, please." So Evan put it- back, and they watched it puffing its round jelly-ball of a body slowly in and out, and waving its streamers, among its -companions. They leaned over for a long time watching these medusae, as Evan had once heard them named. Although the current was swift and strong, the vast shoal had been half an hour in passing when the sun went down Darkness was not slow in closing in, when, to Luti's extreme terror, the whole sea around ap- ., peared a sheet of sparkling, flashing fire. Every wave which rolled along was crested thus, and the ripples glanced in molten light. But all save Luti had read of the phosphorescence of the sea, and knew it at once; although they did not know that all this brilliance was emitted by those same- medusa which Evan had fished up to examine. The jelly disappointment was a great one to. all concerned, although it was sufficiently ridicu- lous to raise a merry laugh -the merriest which '              - ,   SEA-DRIFT.       45 had been heard for days on board the Stormy Petrel. Nevertheless, its famished crew here glad enough to fall into a sleep at last, and, in that land of Nod, to wander beside rivers of jelly, where they could stoop and satisfy hunger and thirst at once.  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7552-00000023"/> CHAPTER IV. SWAMP ISLAND. -M1\ /ORGAN was the earliest awake upon the morning ofthe eighth day. He lay for a long while motionless, h eyes still closed. He dreaded inexpressibly the day before him. He thought of Eva's silent tears last evening, and remembered how he must continue to cut short her insufficient daily ration, till he had a vision of her wan and patient face waxing ever paler and paler. The picture grew every instant i clearer and more painful, and to dispel it, he opened his eyes and sprang up, shaking him- self free from dismal, useless brooding. He sprang up; and as he gained his feet, a wild shout broke from his parched lips. It roused the others, and they were at once beside him. He turned his flushed and eager face upon them, and silently grasped Evan's hand, while with his right he pdnted toward the north-east. The \          46 *    I        , I   S EA-D R IF T.     47 glory of the rising sun came drifting over there in gorgeous brilliancy of coloring, unknown except in tropic seas. But it was not to hail that sun, which made the burning day a weari- ness, that Morgan's shout had risen, re-echoed by the others now. For over there, an emerald green upon the silvery blue of the early morn- ing seas, was seen what seemed to be an island- shore. Evan seized Eva by the waist, and whirled around the deck to a waltz that needed no tune, for their light hearts beat joyous time. Then dizzy with 'delight-and fasting-they sank down, and began to discuss the future which so suddenly had brightened. "You say it cannot be the mainland, Morgan? But if it should be a desert island?" and Eva's face fell. "'Then," said Evan, stoutly, "Morgan shall be Robinson Crusoe, and I will be his man Friday; and you-you and Ayah Luti shall be his parrots!" "So then," said Eva, merrily, "the very first thing pretty poll shall say will be: 'Polly wants  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7552-00000024"/> 48       SE A-DnRIFT. a cracker!' Now, Crusoe, don't be a miser, but give your parrots one at once. What is the use of hoarding up, when we shall presently pitch the old box into the depth of the sea, and feast on bananas, oranges, and cocoa-nuts?" But Morgan could not be prevailed upon to increase the rations. Although he had implicit confidence that terra firma was before them, yet, as he was about to deal out the first plentiful meal since the wreck, something seemed to stay his hand. What if wind or tide should drive the hulk out of its present course? True, both wind and current now were setting toward that refreshing green. But still, without a reason he could explain even to himself, he gave ut the usual portion. ! There was a little grumbling at his tyranny; but with that prospect before them, they could not find it in their hearts to be very much dis- satisfied. So Luti gave her large shawl, in ;hich Eva had wrapped her on the night of the ireck, to the boys to hoist for a sail, and they were soon skimming fast and merrily just in the right direction.   SEA-DRIFT.       49 " "How flat our island is!" cried Evan, when they had been immovably watching it for a long, long time, until at last they were gaining on it perceptibly, moment by moment; "Oh, Evan, look!" cried Eva; "how fast we must be going, for the island seems actually moving. But I forgot--if we were really going fast, the island would appear to be running in our direction, whereas it appears to be trying to keep ahead of us." Evan laughed. "I do believe you think it is like Sindbad's island, and will turn into a whale and run away with us," he said. Morgan had started at Eva's words, and now moved aside, and remained standing apart, his gaze fixed steadily upon the shore to which they were sailing. Yes, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that shore did move. He saw it, for he watched the sea-weed floating here and there in the wake of the Stormy Petrel, and ob- served that the distance between that sea-weed and the shore continued the same. It was evi- dent that the current was bearing both on, as it D  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7552-00000025"/> 50      SEA-DRIFT. ' bore the Stormy Petrel; but the latter, having also sail, was bound to win the race. "To win the race!"Morgan's brow clouded as he muttered these words, for tiey marked the failure of that hope which had brightened all the day. What could that floating island be? Too surely, no refuge. And yet he suf- fered the Stormy Petrel still to wing its way in the vain chase. He could not bear to utter one word of doubt which might quench the glad light in the watching eyes. And, besides, wha matter? As well a vain pursuit as an aimless drifting. So he remained apart as far as the narrow limits of the wreck permitted. For the sound ofthose joyous voices was torture to him, know- ing, as he knew too well, how soon that joy must turn to wailing. Fast and faster, near and nearer, wind- and current carried them; until now they were close upon " the haven where they would be." Mor- gan had turned quite away, and leaned against the mast, his eyes shaded by his hand. Eva and Evan stood forward, hand in hand, the giA   SEA-DRIFT.       5I with a flush on her cheek, and red lips parting in a smile; the boy with eyes kindling in eager- ness. Luti too had risen. All this Morgan saw with one glance before he turned away, listening intently, in spite of himself, for the first words of doubt or of despair. "Why, how flat our island is!"cried Evan, first. "It just looks like one endless green mars'h," Eva chimed in. "But there is one tree--per- haps a fruit-tree. At all events, we must find something to eat aimong the herbage. I, for one, would willingly turn out to graze, like Nebuchadnezzar." Another silece, and they- drifted nearer still. "Oh, missyssyissy!" cried out the Ayah then; "the island's just one awful big swamp!" The brother and sister looked at each other, and Eva clung to Evan, sobbing as if her heat would break. Evan tried a moment to believe the swamp might be just at this extremity. But the unbroken level, and the swaying motion in the water, flatly contradicted this. As for old Luti, though she might have known that  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7552-00000026"/> 52      SEA-DRI FT. torrents of tears could never drain a swamp, she  dropped down in a heap upon the deck, whim- pering to herself. Morgan suddenly adjusted the sail, and made the Petrel swerve so as to pass by to the left. He was fearful of becoming entangled in the reeds, where the boat must have been swamped indleed. And then he rejoined his companions, attempting to comfort them by reminding that sometimes marshes, like sand-bars, were signs  of neighboring land. But the words were   stayed upon his lips; for even as he spoke them, he became aware that this was not even I a swamp, but only a vast mass of drifted sea- weed, closely matted together, and thus strong' enough to bear on its surface boughs and shrubs, and even one tree--all of which some mighty river had swept out to sea. This tree, a tall and slender palm, seemed'to have found enough earth among the pile to have somehow taken root; and so it stood erect, and waved its broad green crown of leaves, as if in greeting to its fellow-voyagers. But only one among its fellow-voyagers   SEA-DRIFT.        53 deigned a single glance its way. It was Mor- gan, who said presently: "Look, look--what an inhabitant our island has! May we not congratulate ourselves on not having landed, after all?" For, coiled around the palm-tree like a huge :ropic vine, was a great serpent. How many niles he had voyaged in that fashion, not even le could tell. And as to his destination, he vas as much in the dark as the Petrel's crew, vho now quietly composed themselves under heir disappointment. Hope was not quite fled; nd as the wind soon bore the crew past, Evan Lised his cap, and gave three times three for ie monarch of Swamp Island, and for the port hence he had sailed. 5-X  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7552-00000027"/> CHAPTER V. * THE MESSENGER. OW the days went by after that, no one on board had any distinct idea. Starva- tion had completely prostrated the four. And worse, far worse than starvation, thirst had I parched their throats, until they lay most of the time gasping for breath and hardly able even to articulate. They had lowered the sail after the first day or two, Morgan finding by his ob- servation of the stars that the current continued constantly to bear the wreck in a north-west- erly direction, while the wind in its sail some- times caused it to veer, thus impeding its pro- gress. Morgan said that by steadily following the current, some land must be reached at last, even if it were quite at the end of the world; and Luti, somehow imagining from the debate on the subject that they were proceeding in the 54   SE:A-DRIFT.       55 direction of her old home, comforted herself with the daily expectation of arrival there. The rainy season was not quite, though nearly, over, and although storms were few, rains occurred three or four times. Yet, pour- ing down in vast sheets as they did, beyond the great temporary refreshment theti gave, they were of little use. They strengthened for the time, it is true; but the burning sun succeeding, soon did away with their effect. The fished-up hat was the only thing on board to catch the water in, for the precious wine had to be hoarded up in its cask, and the mouldy biscuit would have washed away if taken from its box -which was leaky besides. The boys with their knives hollowed out numberless- little troughs in the floor of their boat, but too fre- quently the waves broke over, and washed the sweet waters away. Without bait, or hook stronger than a pin, it was impossible to fish. There had indeed been two days of feasting, when a number of flying-fish, fleeing from the pursuit of some dolphins, had leaped on deck. Morgan had started with a powder-flask and  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7552-00000028"/> 56      S A-DRIFT.  pistol, and with a little of the carefully dried powder a fire was contrived on some loose planks, and all the fish cooked at once. This q was fortunate, as the wind began to blow the sparks about at such a rate, that all hands on board had considerable difficulty in extinguish- ing them, and determined never again to subject themselves to the ordeal by fire as well as by water. Morgan was eager to take the fish under his care and deal them out daily with the bread, l but his proposal did not gain a moment's atten- i tion. Even gentle Eva, beside herself with famine, was deaf to his entreaties. And as all had gathered the fish themselves, he could not force them to submit.-- So he looked sorrow- fully on while they consumed, in two days of plenty, the food which might have served just to keep body and soul together for perhaps a week. He was powerless to prevent, and could only hoard his own share of the prize, to be divided among all in the day of utmost need. That day had come, and there now remained but a thin layer of mouldy biscuit, and a little muddy wine in the bottom of the cask. Every *    * *   I   SEA-DRIFT.       557 drop of the latter was a treasure, for the tor- ments of hunger were hardly felt in that of thirst. The boys soon found that while im- mersed in the sea, they suffered much less, and they frequently plunged in, reckless of the sharks that followed as if certain of their prey. Eva and her servant lay constantly where the spray could dash upon them, for their horror of the sharks prevented their venturing into the waves. One day, Eva was lying half insensible, her face upturned, but her eyes closed to the sun, and unconscious of the balmy breeze that fanned the tresses from her wan brow. Evan lay thus at her feet, and the old Ayah was in a slumber like the sleep of death. But Morgan paced the deck to and fro, in the strength of delirium, "babbling of green fields," and staggering on toward the laden fruit-trees which he seemed to see beckoning him with thirst-allaying clusters, yet ever eluding his grasp. Suddenly he was startled to his senses by a ringing cry from Eva: "Land! land!" "Land! where, where?" exclaimed Evan, starting to his feet.  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7552-00000029"/> 58      SEA-DRIFT. Eva was standing now-her slight frame swaying with excitement, a flush upon her cheek before so pale, and light again in her long-dim blue eyes. She held her hand laid lightly on her breast, as if she guarded there some precious thing. And as she turned and faced the boys, she moved her fingers slowly. First upon her cheek, and then upon her dress, had settled, with fluttering, weary wings, a bril- liant azure butterfly of the Brazilian forests. "Do you remember'how we read the butter- fly came to Pizarro, Evan?" she cried eagerly. -"Land, surely, must be near. This little crea- ture cannot have come from very far, for you know butterflies live but for a day." "Yes, yes, you are right, Eva," returned Evan, who had at first viewed the horizon dis- appointedly, unable to discern a trace of land upon it.  "Miss Eva is almost always right," said Morgan, gallantly. "And now, from this day forward, we may take two straws a day instead of one. For really, at the rate of one, we won't have strength, when land is gained, to crawl from this old raft."   SEA-DRIFT.       59 So they dined- forthwith upon, "two straws," with a double portion of the wine, which, with the hope now stirring in their hearts, seemed to put some life into their veins, especially into Luti's, who roused up to inquire if spirits ever went about in blue butterflies, because, if so, she believed that butterfly had come right down from heaven with the good news. The butterfly's life had panted out, and Eva dropped warm tears upon it, when that night she saw it lying dead at her feet. But its mis- sion was accomplished. When another morn- ing came, a line of dark blue spanned the silvery sea before them.  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7552-00000030"/> CHAPTER VI. ADRIFT ON SHORE. OWARD evening, the Petrel drifted into what its crew thought a broad bay, but which was in reality the mouth of the Amazon River, one hundred and fifty miles wide here. Now and again they passed in sight of some islet, while on their left was the green, marshy Isle Joannes. They remembered their sea- weed experience, and so did not strive to make for those shores, though indeed the effort would have been vain;. for the wind was unpropitious, and the mighty current of the ocean was dash- ing against the only less mighty current of the Amazon, forcing it back in dark tremendous waves which foamed like cataracts. Presently the current took another course, and whirled the helpless wreck into a narrower channel, between Joannes and the mainland. On the latter every eye was fixed in straining 60   SEA-DRIFT.        6I eagerness. The looming of the -burning sun upon the sands made them appear shifting and wavering like the sea itself. The distant sand- hills presented to every watcher the semblance of that which he or she was expecting to be- hold on shore. Eva and Luti saw in them the domes and spires of a city; Evan, the cone- shaped wigwams of an Indian village; Morgan, a far-off mountain-range. But on a close ap- proach, there were but sand-drifts, and a waste of beach, fenced in almost to the water's edge by an impenetrable thicket of cactus, lifting its branches in candelabrum-form to the height of forty and fifty feet. In view of that thicket, they were content to let the sea carry them farther up the coast, until, upon the second day, a grand old forest stretched down to the beach, and there they were sure of fruit to cool their parched and thirsty mouths. Very pleasant was the last meal aboard the Stormy Petrel--so very pleasant, that a tinge of regret for the old hulk mingled with their bright anticipations of the new world before them. For all were too inexperienced, as all 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7552-00000031"/> 62      SEA-D I FT. but one too young, to mingle those anticipations with forebodings. So they divided into four sufficient parts the last of their provisions, and so banqueted, while their dining-hall was drift- ing nearer and nearer to the beach, on which they could presently perceive the varied, brilliant hues of shells and pebbles. Under the cloudless skies, and fanned by the breezes of August, which is the Brazilian early spring, they chatted of the fruit-dessert which they could fancy hanging from the trees for them to pluck--of their probable adventures in the wood, when Morgan and Evan should be a pair of Jack-the-Giant- Killers, in defence of Eva and the Ayah (the recital- of which adventures ended somewhat abruptly, on the boys observing the paling of Eva's face and the lengthening of Luti's)-and how at last they should arrive at Rio Janeiro, that wonderful city, where they would meet mamma and papa walking arm-in-arm in the street, with all the little ones straggling behind them. "Because," commented Eva, "you know mamma could not possibly leave them at home without Ayah Luti to look after them."   SEA-DRIFT.       63 Luti's half tearful "Bless their little rosy- posy faces!" was cut short. For suddenly there came a grating sound upon the sand, and the Stormy Petrel was aground. 'The boys' hurrah made the tropic welkin ring again, and the vast, silent f6rests echo English sounds quite new to them. And then, by dint of much pulling and more stamping, they had to break away enough planks from the shattered side of the vessel to tie across the broken railing, and thus make a small raft. For, though the wreck was fast aground, there was still a space of glassy blue water to be pad- dled over, beneath which the pebbles might be seen shining at the bottom, almost as if the sun's clear rays could strike them there. They started now, somewhat after the fashion of the fox and goose being boated across the river, as the riddle tells; for although, unlike the fox and goose, it was not to be feared that Ayah Luti would eat Eva up if left with her, yet Eva was afraid to be carried over to the shore and remain there alone; and it was only on Morgan's propounding to her that famous  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7552-00000032"/> "      SEA-DRIFT. riddle, that she consented to wait upon the wreck during one trip of the raft. So, it was arranged that Morgan should paddle Evan to land, and stay there while Evan should return for Luti, and that Evan and Luti should-then both remain upon the beach while Morgan should come for Eva. There was no such ad- ditional difficulty as the bag of corn, unfortu- nately; only the hatchet'to be cared for, Mor- gan's hunting-knife and pistol, and, not least, a bundle of clothing which Eva had secured. Eva swatched, with anxious eyes, the progress of the little raft. But it floated bravely- bravely enough, as Evan, coming back for Luti, assured her, "to take the whole shebang at once, only Morgan refused to let the trial be made." "Oh! by the way, Miss Eva," Morgan said, when they, the last, were about to abandon the wreck to its fate, "we had nearly forgotten one thing. Stay! Won't you please make me a present of a piece of the tarpaulin your bundle is wrapped in?" He handed her his knife as he spoke, and she, though wondering, obeyed.   S EA-DR IFT.      65 "And now Luti's red-and-white bandanna, if you please. I see she has left it with your bundle." "Why, Morgan! don't you remember how delighted she was when you gave it to her?" "I'll make it all right with Ayah Luti, Miss Eva. The first thing I ever asked of you!" This appeal was too much for even Eva's sense of ownership. She gave him the ker- chief, and, in so doing, gave him also both her lhands. "I don't understand you, but I trust you," she said. His face flushed with grateful pleasure; but, instead of answering, he turned away and hoisted the gay bandanna as a flag to the mast. After that, he took his note-book and pencil, leaned against the mast, and very leisurely seemed viewing the landscape before him, from time to time returning to his note-book. Eva looked on in amazement, but did not speak a word. After a while, he turned the leaf, and then he evidently was writing rapidly and pauselessly. He stopped but once. O  -  E  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7552-00000033"/> "      SEA-DRIFT. "How many days since we were wrecked?" he asked. "I really don't know-- a century or two,  should think," she answered, indifferently. He went on writing, and presently tore the page. out and handed it to her. She looked'in surprise. Before her was a minutely accurate though rude sketch of the landscape around-the wooqs and indentations of the shore-everything exact. She turned the leaf and read: "The schooner Stormy Petrel, sailing from London, bound for Rio Janeiro, was wrecked off the coast of Brazil on the loth of August. Crew and passengers escaped from the wreck, save four - Eva and Evan Grafton and servant, and Morgan Dare. We, these four, were driven helplessly, by storm and wind, out of sight of land for ten or fifteen days, until this morning, when we were' stranded on the coast of which the accompanying is a faithful sketch. We are well and courageous, and we shall land, and, forthwith travel together along the coast"- ("You see I have marke'd on the sketch which   SEA-D R IFT.      67 direction we will take," Morgan interrupted Eva just here to explain)-" until we reach the first large river. This we shall ascend, hoping to find that it has been accessible to settlers. If, however, we should fall in with any friendly tribe of Indians, we will remain with. them :until we see our way clear to Rio Janeiro. "( This is written under the belief that those into whose hands it may fall will hold it their duty to attempt the rescue of a weak girl and an elderly woman under the sole protection of two boys, who, however, will never desert them. "The parents of Eva and Evan Grafton, also shipwrecked on the Petrel, but leaving the wreck on the boats, are supposed to have reached Rio Janeiro. A strange fortune only separated them from their children; and the finder of this packet will be handsomely re- warded on delivering it into their hands." Signed,     "MORGAN DARE." "And now you must fold this in a paper, di- rected' to your father," Morgan said, seeing that i Eva stood looking at him speechlessly, a quiver  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7552-00000034"/> 68      SEA-DRIFT. on her parted lips. "And I will enclose all in another paper to the British Consul at Rio; wrap it in this tarpaulin to keep it from rain; and then let this, our old mail-packet, sail away as fast as it pleases." He gave her his pocket-book, and she wrote the address-then, after an instant's hesitation, reversed the leaf, and copied Morgan's writing hastily in French. "Perhaps some one might find it who could only read French," she said, half apologetically, as she handed the paper baek to him. There were some English words, however, at the end, and Morgan read them before dis- posing of the package as he had said: "Darling mamma, we are all quite- strong and hopeful. Morgan is, except Evan, the grandest boy that ever was, knowing everything, and i will help us through our troubles. And, dear j papa, God has saved us wonderfully, and will  guard and guide us to the end. Your- little EVA." By this time Evan had become impatient at the delay on board, being in hot haste to enter i   SEA-DRI FT.       69 into an exploration of the forest, but detained by 'Luti's terrified supplications. But Morgan answered promptly to his shout, and the raft was now soon under way. Luti, especially, was very much pleased at the idea of the mail-packet, and desirous of remain- ing upon the spot of their landing, in the firm faith that the packet would set out with the high tide, strike a bee-line for Rio; and deliver its mail instanter. But Evan and Eva, though san- guine enough, yet thought it would be advisable to follow the route pointed out by Morgan's letter, lest possibly something should happen to that letter, and they should be waiting in the wilderness for nothing. Morgan himself said nothing as to his misgivings, though his heart sank as he looked at Eva's tender frame. But it was vain to anticipate misfortune, so he joined heartily in the parting cheer each gave the vessel, and set his face also bravely toward the forest. They had been so long cramped and confined in n the narrow space of the wreck, that it was a luxury to stretch their limbs once morel and  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7552-00000035"/> 70      SEA-DRIFT. the first thing the brother and sister must do was to run a race to the banana-tree which waved its leaves like gigantic ferns just beyond the beach. But they soon found, as they ap- proached, that the undergrowth -sprang up too densely; and, after a straggling grape-vine had given 'them a warning trip, they proceeded more quietly, hand in hand, until they stood beneath the ripe clusters. Evan climbed the straight stem, soon sliding down again with a cluster slung across his shoulder. And then they all sat down upon the sand, Morgan and Luti having stopped to strip a grape-branch of its purple bunches. With what delight they looked around them, as they quenched their thirst with the rich juice! The glowing -color and massive vegetation of his native land seemed to the young Cana- dian as cool and bare to this scene, as would the cold north have appeared in fcrmer days to that dear native land. Bluer and righter than anything they could compare it to, except that tropic sky, the sea stretched boundlessly away from the dazzling white beach at their feet.   SEA-DRIFT.   a    71 Intertwining branch with branch, the forest rose behind with giant trunks and countless variety of foliage, among which the fringing palm rose pre-eminent. Flowers and vines of thousand hues and odors clambered up and lapped across from tree to tree; while, brilliant as those flowers, butterflies and insects innumerable hov- ered over, and gay-plumaged birds made the woods vocal with their joyful songs. But the wanderers did not loiter very long. "Let us go farther into the wood," Morgan said, "for we need bows and arrows for- our journey. We must not waste our time now, for I have heard this is the spring here, and of course it will be much warmer in some weeks -too warm to find our river, ando make our journey up its banks." "But tell me," cried Evan, " why you said we should follow the course of a river, and how you propose to find one?" "Look," Morgan replied; "that very faint and far-off ridge against the sky appears to me. more like a mountain than a cloud; and moun- tains lead me to believe that many springs  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7552-00000036"/> 72      SEA-DRIFT. might find their sources among them. Where many- springs are, there is likely to be a river for them to feed. You see, I have learned, in my wild Indian-border life, that nature does not waste, but gathers up the fragments.. That is one lesson I'know, Miss Eva, though I could not read your French." "Ah! your lesson is worth far more than mine-"Eva was beginning to say, when Evan interrupted: "But of what use will your river be, after all? Why should we not keep right on along this beach?" "Because there are frequently wide stretches of barren land along the coast, where we could find little to eat, and because civilized settlers are apt to choose a water-course, as -produce can be conveyed down to the coast so much more readily." "Well, well, Morgan, you -do really know everything," said Evan. "You ought certainly to turn in and set up a school for the natives." "The natives themselves know everything I have told you. I am ignorant of most things,   SEA-DRIFT.        73 except nature's lessons, as I said before," said Morgan, sadly.  "We can teach you to speak French, Mor- gan,"' volunteered Eva, timidly. "And you shall teach us all those constella- tions as you did last night," added Evan; " for Eva and I only know them on the globes. And I'm sure, as we have n't any globes here, we'd never in the world be able to direct our way by the stars, as you can do." "I know something about botany, too," said Morgan; "fortunately from books as well as sight, or it would be of ittle use to me here. So I hope it will help us not to starve, and will furnish us with a healing plant or two, if one of us is ilL." 7    &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7552-00000037"/> CHAPTER VII. A MIDNIGHT VISITOR. "that day, and all the next, they fol- lowed steadily the coast with the marshy island on the other side,-and slept upon the beach, building a camp-fire to keep off the howling animals; for Morgan had discovered flints to ignite the flames, and his precious powder need no longer be used. Two days had gone by without any other result than to accustom the explorers, in a de- gree, to the roving life before them. Then, too, they found they were in no danger of starva- 'tion. Such a stock of cane-arrows as the boys had laid inri would have rejoiced the heart of that mighty hunter, Nimrod. Morgan, with his Indian experience, had taught Evan to be as excellent a marksman with the bow as he was already with gun or pistol. Even Eva had- be- come more than tolerably expert. As for Luti, 74   SEA-DRIFT.       75 she could not be induced to try; but she was very trustful and uncomplaining, quite willing to follow her missy's lead. And so they jour- neyed on, though their progress was but slow; for strength was not yet fully restored, espe- cially to Luti, after the long famine. "Hark, Evan!"Morgan cried one morning, stopping int his walk, bending forward in a listening attitude. "Do you not hear that sound?" "A heap of them," Evan replied, somewhat impatiently; s a concert every time you choose to listen. For my part, I'm getting tired of it all, and would give a- pretty penny if they'd only stop just long enough to let a fellow breathe. Parrots and monkeys, and insects and snakes, to say nothing of the awful crea- tures we see less of-just like the Happy Fam- ily for packing close, only without the peace." "Ay, but this is a new sound, Evan. Lis- ten - don't you recognize?" Evan did listen, and so did Eva and Luti; and the latter presently cried out: "A crocodile bark, Master Evan, sure!"  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7552-00000038"/> 76       SEA-DRIFT. "The river, the river at last!" cried Eva, clasping her hands together joyfully. And so, indeed, it proved. A short distance farther, and they saw an opening in the under- growth, and stood upon its banks, where their guide, the alligator, was disporting out of the reach of the salt surf, to which he had a decided objection. Silver clear and broad it lay before them - more than a half a mile to the opposite shore. Surely settlers, the wanderers said, could not have neglected this fair' stream, and they had but to ascend its course in order to reach civil- ization once again. As they thought thus, every face flushed with the color of hope. It seemed to them that their goal was in sight, and Eva almost felt her mother's hand touch hers as she stretched it out in greeting to the waters run- ning, laughing, and dimpling at her feet. Denser and denser grew the forest, and at last the sun declined below the tree-tops. The young explorers had learned by experience how suddenly the tropic night descends upon the day, and they knew that they would be inf   SEA-DRIFT.       " almost utter darkness, curtained in by these interwoven boughs. So'they looked about 'anxiously for a place of refuge for the night. The chatter of monkeys and the scream of pa- roquets now began to be mingled with sounds which could hardly be harsher or more dis- cordant, but were far more terrible. Eva clung tremblingly to Evan's arm, and the old Ayah, following closely, looked around in speechless fear, while Morgan walked ahead as if on guard. Suddenly he stopped short, and threw his cap in the air with a loud shout. "Look--just the shelter for us all!" he cried. Right in their path rose a gigantic tree, a courbaril of the primeval forest. Its trunk, which might measure sixty feet in circumfer- ence, towered up, like a vast rock, to an im- measurable height, without a branch to break the mighty column. It was only on the sum- mit that the foliage, the farm of which was indistinguishable at such a height, seemed to brush the sky, and waver to and fro among the stars, which now were just beginning to peep forth. Eva started aghast at the supposition 7.,   &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7552-00000039"/> 78      SEA-DRIFT. that Morgan meant her to climb that impossi-. ' ble tree. But he soon undeceived her; for, ! drawing her forward, he showed her that the i trunk was a hollow, which, standing in its narrower entrance, she found stretched before her into quite a large circular room. This was far better than they had hoped for, and all had soon fallen into a deep and weary sleep, encouraged by their first day's experi- ence along the river; and hopeful of the morrow. Morgan had kindled a camp-fire before the entrance, and stretched himself before it just within the tree, with his bow and arrows lying near him, and his bowie-knife beneath the arm on which his head was pillowed. "We. put our soldier on guard," Eva had said smilingly, before she drew back, and lay down with the Ayah at her feet.; -But she had little thought what need of guard there was, or of the danger 'of that post. The fire had been' heaped up high, to keep away wild beasts. But Morgan, weary with his walk after so many inactive days upon the wreck, slept so, heavily that he had not once aroused to renew the   SEA- DRIFT.       79 flames from the heap of brushwood the boys had piled together. So the fire had burned down to the embers. Still the boy slept on. But his slumber now was troubled, and he tossed uneasily from side- to side. He was dreaming of being again at the mercy of the waves, upon that wreck, in the wild night of the storm. It seemed to him he heard the crash- ing of the planks in.the heavy sea, followed by the low growl of the thunder. -HY opened his eyes and looked around, unable to realize where he was. It seemed to him that low growl was repeated. From a half-burned twig the flame leaped up suddertly, and then.as suddenly went out. But, brief as was its light, it had stayed long enough to disclose a sight which curdled the very blood in Morgan's veins.. There, with just those dying embers between him and it, half crouched a huge tiger, glaring on him as if meditating a spring. He marked those red and fiery eyes which glowed cat-like through the darkness. A shudder shook his frame, and, for an instant, he was all unnerved. But the thought of those defenceless slumberers came  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7552-00000040"/> 80       SEA -DR IF T. to rally his spirits. His right arm was in shadow; so quietly he stretched that out for his bow and arrows. His hunting-knife lay near his left, ready for use when he should have thrown aside his bow. So, in the darkness, he raised himself noiselessly to his knee, and at the very second that ,the light flared up again, an arrow went twanging full at the tiger's heart. But in the death-struggle, it bore Morgan to the ground, and when the heavy fall aroused the sleepers, their first thought was that their deliverer lay dead, as well as the fierce beast that now panted out its last, stretched half upon him. But when, shuddering, they had, by their , united efforts, dragged aside the lifeless carcass, and, kneeling down by Morgan, they had chafed his hands and dashed some water in his face, they saw, with joy unspeakable, his eyes un- clost, and heard him declare, as very soon he sprang to his feet, that he was none the worse for his. late 'battle-only somewhat stiff and sore, which he deserved for having neglected his watch. All agreed'that the tiger deserved a vote of thaa ks for having taught them pru-   SEA-DRIFT.       81 dence for the future without more suffering in the present. This was his den, no doubt, to which he was returning, for the day had now begun to break. One and all were glad to see the morning light; for of, course there was no sleeping after such an adventure. And the boys decided they could not make a better use of the first rays than to flay their defunct enemy, as the hide would make a charming couch for Eva.  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7552-00000041"/> CHAPTER VIII. GIGGING. I'LL tell you what, Evan," cried Morgan, on the evening following the adventure of the last chapter; "this would be a grand night for gigging. What do you say to trying it? See, the sky is overcast, and there must be a heap of fish hugging the shore to-night. What do you say?" "I don't know what to say, for I have not the smallest idea what you mean by gigging," was Evan's answer. "Never been gigging? Well, I'll teach you. We must both have a torch and a stone har- poon. These sticks will do with which we have been walking all day; only we must fix an arrow-head to them. -I used to have an iron spike at home, but I should think the arrow- head would serve instead." It was not hard to find dry branches for   83   torches, and by the light df the superfluous ones, of which was built a camp-fire, the boys fash- ioned their harpoons or gigs. Then, heaping on fresh fuel, as an additional protection against any roaming visitor such as that of last night, they started off, telling Eva they would be gone only a very short while, and never out of call; and comforting the Ayah, in her fear of being left alone, with the prospect of a fish sup- per on their return, and a treat too at breakfast. They walked slowly along the shore, waving the flaming torches to blind the eyes of any fish which might.be lying irt the shallow water, while their harpoons were held in the right hand, ready for a lucky swoop. But far from a lucky swoop was Evan's first attempt. He al- -most stumbled over a fine fish as he waded along, and instantly directed his harpoon that way. But his hand was unpractised in the art of gigging, and his weapon half buried itself vio- lently in the sand, while his expected prey, with a taunting flop of his broad tail which sent the spray splash into Evan's face, vanished in the deeper river. That was cold water on his   &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7552-00000042"/> 84      SEA -DRIFT. first effort, it is true, but it did not damp his ar- dor, and he went on determinedly after Morgan, who had flung one large fish across his shoulder. Suddenly he gave a loud shout of joy; and Morgan, turning, beheld the harpoon buried deep in the sand, and its master vigorously struggling with a dark object pinned fast to the sand. How the struggle might have ended is l extremely doubtful, whether in the stranding of the animal, or the plunge-bath of the fisher, had not Morgan rushed to the rescue. That turned the tide of battle at once, when a judi- cious blow from the hatchet ended it. They flung the full light of the torches on their prey, and stood there, gazing down with no little cu- riosity. Indeed, the animal before them was certainly a subject for any amount of wonder. It was the peixe-boi, or bull-fish of the Ama- zons, and the boys observed with wonder its strange proportions. But it was growing late, so they cut off a large steak, planting their torches in the ground as they set to work. Afterward they with difficulty got the huge car- cass farther within reach of the river's current,   SEA-DR IFT.       85 lest, lying there, it might attract some anima And then, with their two trophies, Morgan's fish and Evan's "beef," they started for the-camp. Eva and Luti had been cowering over the fire there, in breathless terror. , Every rustle of the breeze in the waving palms had seemed a tiger's stealthy approach. Morgan's shout had com- forted them somewhat; but still it was an inex- pressible relief when the boys reappeared. But now all fears and cares were banished, and seldom were more cheerful faces seen than on that flowery bank where now was cooked the supper. Notwithstanding the proverb that too many cooks spoil the broth, each and every one proclaimed the cookery perfection. A gen- uine beef-steak, done to a turn by the greatest genius ever appreciated by epicures, could never have given more satisfaction than did this slice, half fish, half beast, broiled on the brushwood ifire, which lit up the tangled thicket like a wall around. Then, with brushwood heaped higher than ever, and the boys to keep watch by turns, the weary ones were very soon at rest. 8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7552-00000043"/> * CHAPTER IX. THE MULE'S COUSIN. D  AY was just breaking, after a long night's quiet sleep, when Evan was startled by a hand laid softly upon his; and opening his eyes, he beheld Eva, leaning over him. She pressed her finger on her lips as he seemed about to speak, and then silently pointed to a gap in the thicket, where the river was to be seen, still gray and misty in the dawn. He raised himself softly on his elbow, and his glance followed in the direction of her gesture, prepared to meet some terrible sight, since her face was so very pale. But his expression changed with the first glance.  "You little coward," he whispered, gayly, "don't you remember the picture of the tapir in our big zoological dictionary at home? That is a tapir. It is perfectly harmless, and I am going to have a shot at it, for no doubt -it is ex- cellent eating." 86   SEA-DRIFT.       87 He seized bow and arrows as he spoke, and crept toward the gap. Eva did not follow, but remained with pity shining in her eyes for the creature which had so terrified her a moment before. It was a large, uncouth animal that she was watching- an animal bearing some slight re- semblance both to a- pig and a mule, though the Indians consider the likeness to the latter so remarkable that they call the tapir first-cousin to the mule. But in a much shorter time than this, Evan had taken his observation, had fitted the arrow to the bow, and away it whistled through the still, silent dawning. Away it whistled; but the tapir, having fin- ished its long draught, had, at the moment of Evan's shot, dropped its clumsy bogly suddenly upon the sands just covered by the cooling rip- ples, and so the arrow, aimed rather high, passed harmlessly above its head. And the animal leaped up with a snort, and galloped away full speed back into the thicket. "Never mnind, Evan," said Morgan, who had roused just in time to see the last caper of the  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7552-00000044"/> 88       S E A-D RIFT. ungainly beast; " there was certainly something uncommonly mulish about the creature's head, and if the likeness any farther extend, he is no great loss to our breakfast." But Morgan's fish was forthcoming, and his arrows soon brought down a pair of the bright green parrots which kept up so continual a chatter in the trees above. It was indeed a feast for those who, less than a week ago, had been literally at starvation's point. The fallen trunk, which served as table, was set with plates  of broad palm-leaves; and bananas, grapes, and oranges were heaped upon them. Luti delighted in the order in which every- thing was placed, and, after performing the duty of cook, insisted upon taking upon herself that of waiter. Her young mistress exchanged a smile with the boys, as the tin canister of water was handed round with a courtesy and as much manner as if it had been the cut glass, silver, or French china she had been used to handle in her young days. The breakfast passed off merrily, and all felt refreshed and ready for another day's long walk.   SEA-D RI FT.      89 They were never weary of admiring the luxu-, riant vegetation round them, nor of wondering at the animals they sometimes met. AmongF the regal palms, through the broad-cresting foliage of which glowed golden flowers -like massive lamps': r crimson or snowy pyramids, insects like tiny flowers were hovering, and humming-birds made the whole forest brilliant. Beneath, through the dense undergrowth, now and then impenetrably matted, so that the tra- vellers had to turn sometimes far out-of their way, strange creatures moved, or lay at rest waiting for the fall of night. The peccary, in shape and grunt much like the common do- mestic hog, rejoiced their hearts -more than once withy a so-far delusive promise of roast pork. The monkeys leaped and swung and chattered from tree to tree. The Brazilian por- cupine, with its bristling quills, and long tail by which it swings itself from bough to bough; the sloth, suspended under the branches, with fur so much the color of the moss which clothes them; the ped, green, and blue parrots, almost never still; the toucan, in garb of lemon, red, 8-*  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7552-00000045"/> 90      SEA-DR'IFT. and black, perching on the extreme $ranches, and rattling against them with his monstrous bill; and the darra, or bell-bird, sounding through the forest its metallic note, when for a short space all other sounds seemed hushed at noontide--all these furnished;e exiles an un- failing fund of interest. \ .    CHAPTER X. CANOES. A S they followed the windings of the river, day after day, many a time the young travellers came to low ground, which they had considerable difficulty in crossing, not because the land was naturally swampy, but because it bore traces of having been flooded in the height of the rainy season, the waters of which were not yet altogether vanished. The boys had- frequently to interrupt their journey in order to construct a rude raft on which they could ferry Eva and Luti over to the next dry ground. -But these rafts were very troublesome to make, and still more troublesome to carry; indeed, the latter attempt was never renewed after the first day. But these detentions retarded their march so much that they, on some days, made hardly any progress. Once they tried the plan of re- maining on the raft, and rowing all the morning "W  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7552-00000046"/> 92      SEA-DRIFT. up the river; but the stream was so rapid that their unwieldy vessel made very little headway. It was impossible, they decided, to build a canoe, or even to hollow out a " dug-out" from a fallen tree-trunk, with no other implement than one small hatchet. For:-once, even Mor- gan was without a resource, and said there was nothing for it but to wend their patient way thus slowly and laboriously. One morning, after a wretchedly wakeful night, disturbed by the near howling of wild beasts, they were seated on the bank of the river, eating their breakfast of fruit and fish, and looking dismally forward to the day's work before them. Just on the farther side of the huge clump of matted mangrove-trees which rose upon their left, they thpught they could perceive the glimmer of water glinting through the foliage. So then 'another raft must be made. The prospect was anything but plea- sant, and all, loth to begin, were tarrying yet a few moments over their meal. "How singular that group of cane!" said Eva, looking up where the straight bamboo   SEA-DRIFT.       93 stems rose near at hand to the height of six or eight feet, and surmounted by a large round earthen globe. "Singular, indeed!" cried Evan. "What can be the meaning of all those great knobs? What do you say? -here goes for an experiment." The hatchet was slung across his shoulder, and, with the words, he sprang up and dealt a blow to the nearest cane, which brought the upper half in an instant to the ground. Evan sprang aside with a cry; for out from the hollow bamboo poured a perfect stream of great white ants in thousands upon thousands. They made a rush straight ahead, directly toward Eva, who was just about to strike at them with a palm branch she held, when Morgan shouted: "Keep perfectly still, Eva. Don't move hand or foot." She obeyed; and the multitude, armed with such sharp stings, passed across her lap and her arm, and left her unharmed. They are not to be turned out of their course, always sur- mounting any obstacle rather than avoiding it. When allowed to pursue that course. uninter-  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7552-00000047"/> "     SEA-DRIFT. ruptedly, they go their way without mischief; but if opposed, those myriad insects are enemies not to be scoffed at. When they had fairly disappeared in the thicket, their late abode was scrutinized curi- ously. - It was wonderful to see how perfectly the house at the top was constructed, with all its intricate earthen cells; and how the hollow cane had served as well as a subterranean pas- sage to and- from them -thus, in the rainy sea- son, protecting the ant kingdom, with its queen, from the water which had covered all the ground around. The ants, and their-manners and customs, were still under discussion, and Morgan was relating some facts out of his woodland expe- rience, when he suddenly broke off in his recital. " Hark!" he said, lowering his voice; "there is a sound we have not heard before. I think - I am sure it is the splash of paddles! " "Where, Morgan - in which direction ?" And Evan was about to rush forward to the river's brink,'when Morgan pulled him back.   SEA-DRIFT.       95 "Not so--we must hide!" he whispered. " How do we know what savages may be in that boat? Come!" and he pushed Evan and led Eva, until the three, with Luti, were'safely ensconced in 'the densest of the thicket. He stationed himself as a sort of picket-guard, where he could command a full view of the stream whence the sound proceeded. Nearer and nearer it approached--now indu- bitably the splash of paddles, accompanied; a moment after, by the murmur of voices. The words were foreign to the listeners, the intona- tion strange. They watched there breathlessly. Very soon around the fringe of bushes on that point which jutted out into the water, skimmed a light canoe. An instant more, and its occu- pants were in full view. The watchers one and all turned and looked into each other's faces; for that boat's crew were Indians ! Another and another glided past. They were going slowly, as if seeking a landing. So those four pairs of anxious eyes, and especially Mor- gan's, had space to note everything about them. This took less time, since the clothing worn &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7552-00000048"/> SEA-DRIFT. by the Indians, a mere strip, drew off less at- tention from their faces. These were wild and hideous in the extreme. The coarse black hair, flowing down long and heavy over their shoul- ders behind, was cut straight in front, and hung just above the brows, helping to give the copper- colored, strongly-marked features an expression of ferocity, which was increased in no small degree by the lines and splotches of red paint with which cheeks and forehead were adorned. Great plugs of gayly-colored wood were thrust into large holes in the ears and lower lips, stretched by their weight into ponderous length. But strangest ornament of all, was a tuft of fea- thers adjusted in a piercing of the nostril, and having at a distance the appearance of a mous- tache of variegated blue, green, yellow, and red. All this was minutely observed while the savages were landing, and afterward engaged in securing their canoes to the paddles which they thrust into the moist and clinging soil of the river-bank. They then stationed one of the party in a boat as guard, and dispersed among the trees in search of game.   The four wanderers, crouching in the thicket, dared hardly breathe as more than one passed by so very near. But after a while they had all strayed to some distance, as was evident from the more distant twanging of the bow and crash- ing through the undergrowth. Then Morgan peered out cautiously. The one man left be- hind had thrown himself in the bottom of the boat, and, with his naked arm thrown across his eyes, seemed to be sleeping. Morgan looked -t.,,n, with his finger on his lip, and a warning gesture to his companions, he crept slowly and stealthily through the thicket, nearer to the boats. Fortunately, that in which the man was lying happened to be the farthest off; and Mor- gan's movements could scarcely have been dis- tinguished from the thousand rustlings of the forest round, save by a very wakeful ear, which the one sentinel certainly did not possess. Eva and Evan were at a loss to account for Morgan's risking discovery in order to gratify - what seemed to them idle curiosity for a nearer view of the savage. He did not explain his motives when presently he came back as cau-  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7552-00000049"/> 98      SEA-DRIFT. tiously as he had gone; for returning steps now passed close by. Just passed-for in another moment a fire was lighted, so near that the smoke drifted, urling, into the thicket. They were soon busily preparing the food their ar- rows had brought down -a number of parrots, and one of those very ring-tailed monkeys which Eva had so admired when she first set foot on Brazilian soil. She watched in amaze- ment now. The animal, when flayed and pre- pared, was suspended over the fire by means of two forked b .nches, erected in the ground with a transverse stick supporting this favorite Indian delicacy. The thicket was a most uncomfortable refuge now. The smoke poured into it in suffocating wreathes; for the atmosphere was lowering, and woultl not suffer it to rise. The desire to cough was only to be arrested by smothering the face in clothing. And there the while sat the savages, some with their eyes resting on thatfvery leafy covert, dining, and talking away in strange and uncouth language. But, the meal oyer, the banqueters re-   SEA -DRIFT.  " paired to the canoes, and in short space were speeding down the stream again. Then Morgan explained himself. He told his companions he had been struck by the ap- pearance of the canoes, which evidently were neither of separate planks nor dug out of a log} and he had crept near, hoping they might fur- nish him with a hint. They had done so, and he said he only waited for a safe time to adopt it. For the present they must lie close, lest these savages should only be the van of their tribe. They were a war-party returning from battle, for he had observed that more than one was slightly Wounded, and the man who re- mained in the canoe more severely. So all that day and night, and the next, they only stirred in order to gather the fruit hanging for them upon the neighboring trees. But there was no further sight of Indians; and on the third morning all set to work on the canoe, under Morgan's directions. They had not to wander far through the wood before they found a fallen tree with a peculiar bark, of which Morgan had observed those Indian boats were  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7552-00000050"/> I00      SEA-DRIFT. made. This they stripped off entire, and cutting it to the requisite length, they rolled up the two ends, and tied them with a certain pliant vine, which the savages use for rope. Then, prop- ping the sides open with flat pieces of wood, they now had a light and portable and safe ca- noe, the fac-simile of those of the Indians.' They had learned too, another lesson, with regard to monkey-meat; and, roasting a plen- tiful supply of that and of birds, and storing the canoe with- fruit, they were soon afloat, and ad- vancing merrily, though against the current, with the aid of the strong paddles which Mor- gan's invaluable hatchet had hewn.   CHAPTER XI. THE HAMMOCK. NE evening, some days -later, Morgan was taking his turn at paddling the ca- noe. He was guiding it slowly up the river, watching for a place to moor on either bank. The sun- was nearly down, and great trees and gorgeous vines threw wavering shadows over sunset rays which swept the silver waters from west to east. Eva's eyes were following the shore on either hand, which only varied in the curves, or flowers, or foliage - never once with any break which told of human neighborhood, or interrupted the deep isolation. Palms, bananas, and nut-trees mirrored them- selves in the stream. Eva looked at their clear pictures, but she started suddenly; for she saw among them a something certainly not of them. "Look, look! Eyan, Morgan!" she whis- pered. 9 *             O IOI  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7552-00000051"/> 102      S EA'-D R I FT. They followed the direction of her gesture, and they too espied that alien object swung among the trees. Yes, it was beyond doubt a hammock. Now, neither their late experience, nor that of Morgan in former days, had taught them that Indians ever use hammocks. This article was connected, in their minds, only with sail- ors and with civilization. So, with hearts that bounded high in expectation, they steered across the stream, and made swiftly for-the hammock, which seemed to promise so many and longed-for things; Cautiously and noiselessly they stole up to- ward it; and Evan, swinging himself up the overhanging tree, was the first to take a peep. Just one peep --and down he came, sliding down the tree in breathless haste. Eva and Morgan had started forward at the sight, while Luti fled to the canoe as if a legion of enemies was in pursuit of her. "What is it, Evan?" "An Indian. But I don't think he saw me, though there he lay, with his face upturned,   S EA-DR I FT.     I03 staring away into the tree. Come, come! let us get away as fast as possible." "Strange that he should be lying there at this time of day--" began Morgan. But he broke off; for there was a movement of the hammock, a gaunt hand and arm, almost like those of a skeleton, dropped over the side, and a haggard, ghastly Indian face was lifted slowly and with effort. Luti, as Eva long afterward was wont to tease her by declaring, leaped frantically up, and would have paddled the canoe away, forgetful of all saveaht wild Indian, but that she could not, by the utmost stretching forwd, reach the paddle, which had been thrown on shore upon the landing of the crew. So she cowered back into the boat again, covering her head, and blindly awaiting fate. But th thers stood their ground, seeing, at a giance, that there was nothing here to dread.  "The poor wretch is ill--is dying, perhaps," Eva whispered to Morgan, forgetting that the savage could not understand her if she spoke aloud. "Is it not possible, do you think, to do something for him?"  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7552-00000052"/> 104      SEA-DRIFT. They drew nearer, and the skeleton hand beckoned. It was a horrid sight indeed. The livid cheeks were. daubed with war-paint, and, besides, had streaks and spots of clotted blood. Blood was trickling even now down from the temple, matting the wildly flowing,- coarse, black hair, and showing that some wound had brought him to this evil plight. Fever had evidently ensued; for the man's eyes were glassy and his breathing irregular, as the trio now stood near. He stared upon them, and his lips tried hard to move. At first they could only'tremble; but presently whords came-- words, however, utterly unintelligible to the hearers. "I should not wonder if he were-famishing," said Morgan. "We must try to help him. Poor fellow, he's past injuring even Ayah Luti there!" Evan ran, at Eva's bidding, to the boat, to bring- the small medicinal stock which Mor- gan's botanical knowledge had enabled him to, collect among the herbs and barks.- He brought, too, a large gourd or calabash of   SEA-DR I FT.     105 water, and a portion of the golden oranges, and of the yams which they had baked last night to serve as the day's provisions. Eva herself, clambering up by the boys' as- sistance, leaned over the wounded man, who had sunk fainting back, and whose wound was bleeding afresh, after the desperate exertion he had made. With her own hands she washed away the clotted gore, spread on the wound the balsam-leaf, and bound it up with her handker- chief. Then she poured down his throat a re- viving draught of the wine she yet carefully hoarded. As under its influence his eyes un- closed, by signs she prevailed on him to swal- low the dose of bark she hastily prepared to break his fever. Then she broke a yam, and herself fed him with it. But she shuddered and drew back involuntarily, seeing with what savage appetite he seized on every morsel. The thought came over her with deadly terror, that, perhaps, if he had but strength enough, the strong white teeth would thus voraciously close, not only on the food, but on the hand that gave it. She had heard there were cannibals  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7552-00000053"/> o106     SEA-DRIFT. in Brazil, and for an instant her courage flagged, and she had wellnigh been ready to give up her task. But she forced herself to firmness; and it was not until he finished with a long draught from the gourd, which Evan immediately replen- ished from the river, and placed, propped so that it should not spill in the hammock - it was not until she had put within his reach food enough to support life for several days, during which the fever might leave him able to provide for himself--not until all this was done did she permit herself to give way to her stifled alarm. Then her descent from the tree was precipitate indeed. ' But Morgan was there to catch her if she should fall, and seemed so well to understand her, that no word was spoken until all three had resumed their places in the canoe. Luti could only be persuaded to look up when the boat was once more under way, and had fairly left behind the helpless creature of whom she stood in so much awe. And then the three young people discussed their adventure as past and gone, never dream- I   r  SEA-DRIFT.       107 ing that, of all the actions of their lives, this one was destined to prove the most momentous. When Providence puts a good deed in our way, and we do it because it is right to do it, often and often it brings its own reward when we have long ago forgotten it. ...       &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7552-00000054"/> CHAPTER XII. EVAN'S PORTUGUESE. T HE next day was a sad one to all the party; for the truth was beginning to press home, and they could no longer put it away, that this beautiful river, fruitful as were its banks and fine its natural advantages, was yet left to itself. The white man's foot had never trod there, or else had passed on and left no print upon the solitudes. For the first time they had admitted this, one to the other. With the canoe moored in a sheltered cove, they were resting in it for the night; for the traces of Indians had been many through the day, and they did not dare to land. Long and earnestly they had consulted, while the Ayah slumbered trustfully at their feet; and still they had come to the same conclusion-- that they would not abandon the only hope of rescue by their friends, in abandoning the course 'o   SEA-D RIFT.     IO9 they themselves had marked out. They would continue on for a few days more, and then would push across the country, as they had said. So they bade each other have no fear; for God was even in the wilderness. And then they stretched their weary limbs as well as they could in the narrow compass of the boat, and fell into a weary sleep. All, that is, save one, for Eva could not close her eyes. She had borne up so bravely all this while. Hungry and worn and frightened, she had never once uttered a complaint. But now, it seemed to her, her strength was gone. If they could but leave her here upon the bank to- morrow and, push on, and let her die! She could but die in either case, she said to herself, and she could no longer bear the suspense, the struggles of each day. Rest, rest--and let the consequence be what it might. But then her- languid eyes fell upon Evan, stretched out fast asleep beside her, and she knew how heavier far would be his heart if he were journeying on I 10   &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7552-00000055"/> I IO     SEA-DRIFT. without her. Luti too-none else could soothe and calm her fears like Eva. And then Mor- gan- She smiled to herself, and her spirit shook off its depression, as she reflected that she was in- deed of some slight use. Comforted and brave once more, she was about to lay her- head be- side her brother's on the plank seat, when sud- denly, very, very near, she heard a muffled sound; and directly, before she could arouse either of her protectors, a canoe laden with red men shot across the bridge of moonlight span- ning the waters, and made for this very cove. She had only just shaken the boys awake when the strangers were upon them. Morgan sprang to the bow, confronting them with pistol in hand, believing the time had come for the expenditure of that precious powder. And Evan stood up bravely before his sister, as if to shut out danger from her, while he fitted an ar- row to his bow. Yes, they were indeed Indians. And on they pressed, still nearer to the little boat. But when they marked the hostile attitude on board,   SEA-DRIFT.       III they stopped, and every-man removed his quiver of arrows and flung it down before his feet. Morgan, used to ' treacherous stratagem among the races of his own home, did not change his position, and Evan closely followed his example. As the boat drifted slowly into the cove, they scrutinized eagerly the faces of its crew. Mor- gan saw at once that it belonged to a different tribe from that which he had yesterday so nearly encountered. The hair, indeed, was trimmed after the same fashion, and the cheeks were daubed with red and black. But the head was not flat, the features were better marked, the color lighter, and the whole expression less fe- rocious, while most of them were clothed in gayly-painted poncho or blanket, with a hole in the middle for the head. The lips, too, were not lacerated after the fashion of that other tribe, nor the ears elongated until they flapped like those of spaniels. Altogether they ap- peared a much less formidable set. And now one man pressed forward from among them, and began to speak.  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7552-00000056"/> 12      SEA-DRIFT. Morgan listened, without comprehending a syllable, but Evan presently cried out: "Amigos! friends. Hurrah, Morgan! to so much does my Latin help me. Here is our friendly tribe at last. And now we shall win through our troubles without fail." And friends they proved to be. The spokes- man or interpreter among them had a slight acquaintance with the Portuguese, just sufficient to enable him to be wofully cheated, while thinking he was making excellent bargians, on those occasions when, with skins and barks for sale, this and other distant tribes at peace and amity with the white men go up to the nearest trading-stations. Then.Evan advanced as interpreter for the other party, and, by dint of leaving out all save the most important words in his sentences, and hitting sometimes upon those which resembled the Portuguese, he managed to make the drift of his speech understood. On their part, he found out that they had some days ago been victorious over a hostile tribe with whom they waged war not seldom   for the possession of the fishing-ground, a sort of Debatable Land on the river above. The Indians promised to take the wanderers-under their protection. Their village was two days' journey up the river. And when they next went on the annual journey to the trading settlement, with skins and yuca and cocoa, Evan's party should go too. Now again sleep fled from Eva, and from the boys also, though Luti had not stirred all this while from her deep slumber. But when at last they did fall asleep,' with the friendly canoe moored near, it was to welcome happy dreams, and visions of home and meeting all the far-off loved ones there. &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7552-00000057"/> CHAPTER XIII. MANU S VILLAGE. LL were wrapped in happy dreams, when, just before day-dawn, while the faintest tinge of gray was hazing the dark-blue, starry skies of night, the Indians roused their new friends, giving them to understand by signs that there was danger in lingering, lest their enemy below on the river might rally in larger numbers and pursue. Silently and swiftly, with no sound to rouse the hostile Indians in any possible lair in the neighborhood of the banks, they pushed their way for miles, and not until nightfall did they stop again. Then Manu, the man who seemed to be the Fhief, and who boasted that profound knowledge of the Portuguese, signed to his oarsmen, and they moved 'the canoe to the shore. Their example was quickly followed 114   SEA-DRIFT.       II5 by the young adventurers, and the whole party landed together. When they had clambered up the steep bank of green clay, all the Indian boatmen crowded round their new-made allies with smiling signs of welcome, afterward escorting them along a narrow winding path through the dense wood. Suddenly they came upon a small partial clearing, and in sight of huts. These were gathered together somewhat to the rear of a large open house, the roof of which was thatched with palm-leaves, and supported on forked wooden posts, between which were slung hammocks, which were the only vestiges of furniture. There slept the men and boys, making it also a sort of outpost or fort, that stood between the helpless women and children and a landing foe.   The Indians, as if doing the honors of their town, led the way next to three or four build- ings in the rear. The roofs of these sloped to within two feet of the ground, and the walls were also thatched in, with a  doorway at each corner, and one in the centre fronting the out-  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7552-00000058"/> Ii6      SEA-DRIFT. post. From the largest and middle one of these buildings poured a stream of women and chil- dren, greeting their returned warriors, but in rather an undemonstrative manner, considering that they had been forth upon "the war-path," s Morgan termed it. A brisk conversation then went on between them, while they eyed the strangers, uncertain at first whether to re- gard them as visitors ot captives. During this, Evan clasped Eva's hand in his, as he saw that she was trembling, and Morgan drew nearer, while Luti laid hold of Evan's jacket, crouching behind him very much in the fashion of an ostrich, who deems himself invisible when he hides his eyes.. But there proved to be no necessity for hiding this time; for at last the conference among the savages was at an end, and the women ad- vanced with friendly aspect, and made signs that Eva and her old nurse were to follow them. But Eva only held the faster by Evan's arm, so that all the four stooped together under the low roof, and entered, after a bevy of savages, into the apartment, which was in reality the dwell- -I   SEA-DRIFT.       iI ing-house of several families. Eva gazed round in astonishment as soon as her eyes grew fa- miliar with the dingy light. Little heaps of ashes marked^!here and there upon the earthen floor the separate kitchen of every woman; and earthen platters and cooking utensils were scattered around in the wildest confusion.[ This was drearie-than the wild wood, and quite as noisy too; for itroops of dogs ran whining or barking about, parrots chattered and screamed from their perches in the thatch, and a white- faced monkey scolded angrily at its little cop- per-colored playmate. "Oh, Missy, Missy!" cried Luti, "we a'n't never to stay in this chicken-coop of a place? How the selvedges cook here beats me. If only they don't take a fancy to a slice of decent people!  Me safe, Miss Eva- dark meat not the best; but you, I'm afraid--there, there, never mind me, darling. I'm only a-talking-" She interrupted herself as she saw Eva's face lengthen. In truth, she had really frightened Eva, who did not recover her equanimity u'ntil Morgan,  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7552-00000059"/> Ii8      SEA-DRIFT. observing her expression, had spoken a few cheering words. The savages stood looking on, and seemed highly amused by the unknown language in which the strangers spoke. Per- haps they-thought all but their own tongue was gibberish. "Oh, Evan- Morgan- indeed, indeed I can- not sleep here!" cried Eva, secure in her hosts' I ignorance of English. "What can we, shall we do?  I'd rather share that hollow tree again with the tiger than remain here with only Luti - for you see they are making signs for you to leave us. You will not, surely " "We will never leave you!"The assurance came with resolute emphasis from the lips of both boys together. But when, the savages here laughed again, their laughter struck on Eva's heart as an evil omen. At last, however, Evan, half by signs and half by nondescript language, which would certainly not hav been recognized in Portugal, gave the men to under- stand that other quarters must be provided, even if they should be roofed in by the deep blue skies, where, as they were now allowed to   SEA-DRIFT6       I19 pass out of the lodge, large stars were coming forth to light up the large sleeping apartment which the exiles had occupied for so many weeks. But they were not to occupy it again to-night. Upon Evan's explanation the way was led will- -ingly enough to a third house, which stood somewhat alone, and which had been used as a sort of hospital. True, the- speaker of Por- tuguese, who called himself Manu, informed Evan that an old squaw had died in it a week ago; but, as he declared that the disease had been old age, not small-pox, Evan did not think it necessary to translate that information into English. So Eva entered the new abode in blissful ignorance. Her intense relief at escaping from the num-. berless families domesticated so socially to- gether was mingled, however, with some dis- may, on surveying the domicile of which she had at once resolved to make a home. This roof; too, sloped far toward the ground, and as there were only two entrances, the interior was even gloomier than the large one they had left.  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7552-00000060"/> 120      SEA-DRIFT. But, on second consideration, she was very glad those two entrances were all; for Evan was saying that he would guard the one while Mor- gan should the other. And Morgan, as if in answer to her thoughts, suggested that the next morning one and all should set to work and render this as pretty an abode as one could wish to see here in the wilderness. So Eva threw herself contentedly upon her tiger-skin, while Luti climbed up to the hammock, and very soon the four were slumbering as peace- fully in the village of the savages as they had ever done in days of peace in their cosy rooms at home.   *    CHAPTER XIV. PERDITA. ARLY   in the morning, Morgan was awake, and Evan too, so long accus- tomed to be roused by that persistent awaker, the sun. They both noiselessly crept out of the hut, and were delighted to perceive that a. brook ran merrily along close by its walls. The savages gathered round and stared wonderingly when the boys stooped to wash their faces. Indeed, it seemed that the copper skin was not thought to need much polishing; for, beside the streaks of red paint visible on the belles and dandies of the party, many an unpainted streak of black had found a place. But though both decorations increased their wild aspect, they were in very friendly mood, and by signs, and by means of Manu, had entered into quite a conversation regarding their numbers -which were small, and their occupations -which were "            121  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7552-00000061"/> 122      SEA-DRIFT. chiefly hunting, and, in a less degree, planting of yuca. Just so far they had progressed when there was a stir at the entrance of the hut, and Eva crept forth, followed by Luti, closely clinging to her skirts: The day before, Eva's terror had caused her to shrink out of sight of the other canoe, and it had been too dark on the preceding evening for the savages to mark her clearly; so her fairness .impressed them as if at first sight. The dazzling glitter of her golden hair in the full sunshine, the snowy whiteness of herl brow, and her cheeks' bright roses, freshened by the long night's rest, were more wonderful to them than the green-haired mermaids were to mariners of old. And when she turned her soft blue eyes upon them smilingly, her fear dispelled by their- friendly and now awe-struck aspect, their amaze- ment still increased. "Evan," she said, coming forward to his side, while the astonished natives gave back from her path, "let us, this morning, sing the hymn we used to sing at home. I am afraid I have. been too frightened to thank God, for many a   SEA-DRIFT.       123 day; but we see that God has forgiven it, and brought us all together here in safety." The thought crossed Morgar's mind that Heaven might have so ordered their wander- ings as to send a child-missionary of faith and obedience as pure as those of whom it was said, "Of such is the- kingdom of heaven," among these heathens in the wilderness. He uttered nothing of his thoughts, however; but when the trained voices of the brother and sister, fol- lowed by old Luti's, made the forest ring to echoes of the grand old hymn, he took up the chorus, deep and low, and musically too. They sang it on their knees, as Eva motioned them to do, feeling that perhaps the savages might understand that attitude of worship. And so it seems they did, for they made no sound to interrupt; and when Evan became more 'fluent in the language of signs and pseudo- Portuguese, he learned that some one -apriest, he imagined-had once come among them, and ,had sung and knelt, with his eyes uplifted to the skies. But this was some time afterward. At present they were absorbed in watching Eva,  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7552-00000062"/> 124      SEA-DRIFT. and when she rose, one of the women, observ- ing that the dark old woman held her dress without fear, drew near and ventured to touch one of the golden curls, seeming very much surprised to find that it did not burn, or at least warnmher hand, and holding that hand up to her companions, with gestures accompanying her words, assuring them of the fact. Upon this discovery, they crowded round her, until she grew alarmed and began to wish the first one 'had been burned just a very, very little. But she managed to preserve a tolerably composed manner, and presently their curiosity was satis- fied, and they dispersed to consider the ques- tion of breakfast. There it was, just above them in the trees. An arrow or two brought it fluttering to the ground, in the shape of green parrots, chatter- ing no more. And, what with dried fish and' plantains, and the juice of the sugar-cane, which the Indians offered, Luti had soon prepared a most palatable and refreshing meal, partaken of upon the flowery sward, while the Indians regaled themselves near by, over a huge earthen   SEA-DRIFT.       125 pot of some sort of soup, wherein swam large pieces of meat, which every man, woman, and child fished for with the five-pronged forks which Nature furnished. And now for the improvement of the hut, which was destined to be transformed into a cottage, and moreover, into a cottage ormee. Its thatch was fortunately new and good, which relieved the young builders of the heaviest task to which they had looked forward. There was some discussion as to the means of making the door-way more lofty, so that it would no longer be necessary to crouch almost upon all fours on entering. But, on Luti's vehement re- monstrance, urging that all-fours was the best way to trap the savages, should they attempt to enter, and on Eva's timid concurrence, the idea was given up. It was determined, instead, to arrange several tiny windows, or rather loop- holes, with palmetto blinds in case of rain, and by this means the abode was made sufficiently light. Then their Indian friends rendered will- ing though wondering assistance in the erection of a partition, to make two rooms of the one. l* X  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7552-00000063"/> 126      s EA- D R I FT. This partition was formed of palm-leaves inter- woven on a structure of slender poles stripped of their bark. When the whole was completed, and a carpeting of broad palms spread, tie white poles and the green leaves giving occa- sional glimpses of them were a pretty contrast enough. Then the four new, white, grass ham- mocks now presented, and which were slung two in each room, gave quite an air of comfort to the whole, at least in the eyes of the four wander- ers, who, if they had known a sound sleep in the weeks since their shipwreck, at least had not known an easy one. All this occupied until evening, even with the assistance of- more than one interested and neighborly Indian. And now the owners of the cottage stood inside, in admiration of the results of their perseverance. "To-morrow for the beginning of a mud chimney, that Luti may cook in rainy weather," said Morgan, measuring a place for it on the wall of the outer room, where he and Evan were- to sleep on guard. The boys had been in favor of subdividing the inner one, and put- \s   SEA-DR'IFT.      127 ting Luti in a room of her own; but the poor creature clung in such terror to Eva, that the young girl laughed and declared she would return to her babyhood, when many a time the Ayah's pallet had been laid at the foot of her crib.    t "And for rainy weather, too, when we cannot dine beside the rivulet, a table and some-stools must be contrived," Eva said, as she seated her- self upon the tiger-skin, which served as otto- man for the three, while Luti sank, with a deep breath of satisfaction, upon a heap of palm- leaves in the corner most remote from the en- trance.   f But it was hardly remote enough in her esti- mation, when, just as Eva ended, a black head and copper shoulders were thrust into the en- trance, while a dull, reverberating sound accom- panied the movement.  Luti clutched the hatchet at her feet, and flew to Morgan, thrust- ing it into his hand, and attempting to drag him forward. But Morgan only smiled and put her aside, dropping the formidable weapon just behind Up  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7552-00000064"/> 128      SEA-DRIFT. him, where, however, had there been danger, he could have grasped it with the thought. That thought was far from him now; for he had faith in the- friendliness of these savages, which, he perceived, was intermingled with some superstitious awe of golden-haired Eva, whom   they called among themselves "the daughter of the sun." And so black head and shoulders pushed their way on through, still accompanied by that peculiar rolling sound, until their owner at last stood erect in the hut, and dragged in his two hands a huge round object, which was presently discovered to be a drum, cut from the hollow trunk of a tree, with a strong skin stretched tightly over as a drum- head. Eva came forward, and by smiling signs testified her thanks for this gift laid at her feet, while she said to Evan: "Behold our table, which may also give you a hint for your chair factory. Four- smaller ones, with furs I stretched across, would do ad- mirably." "And we could arrange backs for them, too, of plaited boughs," suggested Morgan.   SEA-DRIFT.       129 At this moment wnat should make its appear- ance but a wicker basket heaped with bananas, eggs, and a large fried fish, while the rear was brought up by a girl about Eva's own age. So, with the feast so kindly provided, they repaired to the rivulet's bank, where they found some of the women busied in preparing bread from the mandioca. They had scraped and grated the white root, and were parching it upon a griddle-like earthen vessel laiid upon hot coals -after which they kneaded it, some with a little water, others with the expressed juice of the sugar-cane. When they had baked it a light brown, they courteously divided it with Eva, looking on curiously while she and her servant spread the "' table-cloth" of freshy gathered palm-leaves on the brink of the stream, and then set the table for tea-the tea, how- ever, being replaced by the cool water plashing lip its spray among the overleaning flowery vines. The women had all returned to their little families gathered noisily in expectation of the evening's meal, round the huts to the rear. And  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7552-00000065"/> 130      S EA-DR I FT. so, as Eva now called to Morgan and Evan that "tea was ready," only the girl who had brought them the greater part of that repast was lin- gering, leaning against a tree, her gaze fixed on them. Eva turned, with a gesture inviting her to sup with the party. And for the first time she ob- served her attentively. "Oh, Evan!" she cried; " look -she is so dif- ferent from the rest! Can she be an Indian? See how fine and wavy is her hair, how delicate her features. And her complexion-she is a little sun-burnt, it is true, but I do not think she is. darker than my father." Morgan was stooping over the brook, filling his canteen, so that Eva addressed her brother in French, as she often did. The girl had stood unconscious of remark. But when Eve uttered the last words, "mon pere,"' a strange, puzzled expression came into her face, her lips moved as if she were struggling to speak, and she sprang forward and threw herself, all white and trembling, at Eva's feet. Again her lips moved, and she looked up imploringly into Eva's face.   SEA-DRIFT.       131 Eva was not a little alarmed. But the poor girl's distress was so evident that she soon for- got alarm at this strange conduct, and turned appealingly to Evan, saying in French: "What can have disturbed her, Evan? She has not seemed to understand us, and yet the moment I said my-father-" "Mon pere! mon pere!" cried the girl, in accents as indistinct and uncertain as those of a child just learning to talk. And she gazed wildly round, as if seeking some one; then dropped her head on Eva's knee, and sobbed as if her heart would break. Morgan stood by while Eva was endeavoring to soothe htr v           - "She is n dfdian," he said; "we must find out her history. We may be of use to her when we once more reach civilized parts." The Indians very willingly told all they knew  of "Perdita," as Eva now called her. Years ago, in a war with the same savage neighbors they had so lately encountered, they had captured this girl, then a little child, and so pretty and bright-tempered, that Manu's wife-  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7552-00000066"/> 132     , SEA-DRIFT. had brought Sher up, or rather suffered her to tumble up with her own children. More than this, no one in the tribe could tell. While she was younger, she had been wont at times to wander off alone, and when they came upon her, they would find her crying bitterly and moaning those same two words which she had uttered now again, after so long a forgetfulness, but which none of her friends had been able to comprehend. From that day forward she attached herself closely to Eva, never satisfied when out of her presence. Often and often she would repeat: "-Mon pere! mon pere!" gazing appealingly into Eva's face, as if Eva alonoc'uld fit that one remaining link of memory into the lost chain of events. Time passed on rather uneventfully. The boys hunted and fished, and cultivated a yuca patch of their own, while Luti prepared the fruits of their labors, and kept the tiny cottage in good order.  Little, save the ornamental part, was left for Eva, as she said reproachfully. It was hers to spread the carpeting of palm-   SEA-DRIFT.       133 leaves, when a fresh one was required; to make the cottage gay and sweet with flowers; and to deck the table in the same way. These were all that the boys would recognize as her duties -though when they found her nimble fingers placed newly-plaited hats at their disposal, they were by no means inclined to pronounce them works of supererogation. What little sewing there was to be done she accomplished by means of ai sharp thorn and strong fibres of more than one species of large leaves. But it was not very long before she accomplished something in the manufacturing line, which Evan, Morgan, and Luti all pronounced not to be surpassed in any shop. This was the making of a piece of bark cloth, out of which she fash- ioned suits for the two boys, and dresses for Luti and herself. She had wished each gift to be a surprise, and therefore had called in the assistance of Perdita alone, who showed her how the Indians made the ponchos which they wore--how they beat and pounded large strips of bark, until spread out to the consistency of felt, which the Indians were accustomed to 12  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7552-00000067"/> I34      SEA-DRIFT. color in stripes and curious figures, with differ- ent barks and earths which dyed all colors of the rainbow. Eva preferred the soft gray, natu- ral tint of the cloth to the blue monkey-faces, green ant, and- yellow insects Perdita was anxious to Jaint But she permitted the rl to add some gorgeous flower-sprays on Luti's portion, to the great delight of the old wo- man.                    S One duty seemed to lie in Eva's path, and she did not overlook it. The impression her first appearance had- made upon the savages rather increased than diminished, and the in- fluence her gentleness gained for her was strengthened when they observed how carefully she was watched over by the boys, never suf- fered to do the menial offices imposed upon the Indian wnmen by their lords and masters. So when this golden-haired " daughter of the sun" had learned from Perdita a little of the Indian language, they would listen while she tried to teach them- simple gospel truths. And if they' in reality understood very little, still, out of the handful of good seed falling by the way-   SEA-DRI FT.       3 ie in the wilderness, it may be that some took root. As this remnant of a long since -scattered tribe lived together without chief or governor, so they seemed to have but very dim ideas of one Supreme Governor and Ruler over heaven and earth. They had no idols, no temple, merely an undefined belief in a Good Spirit, and firm faith in a good many evil ones. But Eva found them not unwilling to hear her, though often she feared their interest was cen- tred solely in the grand old anthems she and the boys and Luti would sing together-always on the one day out of seven, which 'they set- apart for Sunday.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7552-00000068"/> - w               - CHAPTER XV. AT THE FISHNG-GROUNDS. WEEKS had elapsed, with hardly any occurrence. The exiles were becom- ing accustomed to the wild life, and happier in it because they had the hope ere long of repair- ing to that trading-station on the Xingu River, where they would meet white men, and find means, they trusted, to make their way to Rio. They were very anxious to make for the Xingu at once, but relinquished the idea when they learned that between the smaller stream where they were now, and the Xingu, there lay a wide stretch of forest untrod by the white man, but through which roved bands of warring Indians. Therefore the peaceful tribes never journeyed thither save in united force -which, of course, Morgan could not expect them to do until they had collected furs enough to make it worth their while. 136   SEA-DRIFT.      137 One lovely morning the boys persuaded Eva, as they often did, to accompany them upon their day's labor. This time that labor was to be a grand fishing-party in canoes, and the sport, Evan declared, would be well worth see- ing. Eva thought very little of that declara- tion; but the prospect of a long row in the boys' own little canoe, beneath the trees that here, where the stream was narrow, overreached it, and then the picnic in some shady, blos- somy nook upon the banks, was bright enough to tempt her forth. So when Luti volunteered as cook for the fish to be caught, the party was made up. The canoe floated merrily down stream in- the wake of the two long boats manned by In- dians. The whole atmosphere was vocal with the morning hymns of myriads of birds, and fragrant with the breeze just shaking off the dewdrops from the forest's thousand blossoms. Eva, leaning over the clear, green-shadowed water, and looking at the brilliant pebbles seen at the bottom far below, was sorry when that tranquil floating with the current was inter- 12*  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7552-00000069"/> I38     SEA-DRIFT. rupted by the beginning of the sport, the busi- ness of the day. But the boys and Luti were all excitement, and Eva, too, presently became so watching them. They had drifted slowly into a tiny cove, obedient to a signal from the leading Indian canoe. And then they followed this canoe, as it once more shot forward rapidly. For high above them was a huge old alligator, who had driven a large school of fish close in toward the bank, and, while the poor, frightened crea- tures were huddled helplessly together, almost on top of one another, the monster was com- posedly making his breakfast off the hinder- most. But the boats, one after another, shot in be- tuween him and his prey. The alligator gazed one moment, opening his great jaws while he stared; but, apparently judging his three rough- barked enemies, with their numerous' arms and heads, rather unmanageable, he turned about, and made the best of his way to the opposite sunny bank, where he continued to stare, as wrathfully as hungrily, you may suppose.   SEA-DRIFT.       I39 Meantime, every fisher had sprung up, his arrow fitted to his bow, and in an instant a perfect cloud of these winged weapons whirred through the air, and plunged down into the waves. Swift as thought, they bounded up again to the surface, with hardly an exception bearing on their points a struggling fish. All the crews were wild with delight add excite- ment. Some leaped into thewater, waist-deep here, to catch handfuls of the quivering arrows, while others sprang up the banks to secure the prey which, in their fright, had thrown them- selves violently out of the dangerous water to the land, as well as into the canoes. It was a busy scene, and one which stood out in-relief long after, from the contrast to that of a few moments ensuing. For, just in the midst of their exertions, one- half of the men being on the banks and in the water, the other half in the canoes--just in the. midst of their ringing cheers at the successful shots,and ringing laughter as now and then one fell wide of the mark-just in the midst of all these sounds, there came another, till now  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7552-00000070"/> I40     SEA-DRIFT. drowned by them. It was a sound of muffled paddles, sweeping up against the tranquil, rip- pled silver of the current. And then a shout which put to silence those of joy, and echoed through the cove, and through the gloomy fo- rest-arches, with the awfulness of doom. For with that shout, half a score of armed canoes shot round, that bend below in the river, and, before the fishers could recover from confusion, had borne down upon them. For these were the savage enemies with whom the tribe so friendly to Morgan and his party were so frequently at war. One instant, all was consternation. The next, the few warriors in the two long boats pre- pared for battle, for they knew they could expect no mercy. But half their number were on shore, and half were wading in the water, and, more- over, more than half their arrows were there also, bobbing up and down with the poor fish, when they might have been used to far more purpose in their masters' service. So, after the few remaining of these weapons had been spent in briefer space than is required to explain, re- o    S EA-D RIFT.      141 sistance was abandoned, and the overpowered braves, and the few women who had accom- panied them, left canoes and fishes to their fate, and took a headlong flight back through the woods. But Morgan and his party were less fortu- nate. Theirs was the boat which lay upon the outskirts of the others, and, consequently, the farthest from the shore. And before he and Evan, with their utmost efforts at the oars, could reach it, the enemy had passedi between and cut them off. Luti was cowering in the bottom, her face hidden on her knees, too terrified to raise her  eyes. But Eva did. She laid her hand on Morgan's arm as. he hastily fitted- one of his' few remaining arrows to his bow, and she signed to Evan to remain quiet., "We are -too few and too badly armed to at- tempt to resist," she said. "Perhaps they may feel no enmity to us. Let us not draw it down upon ourselves, at all events. Courage, dear brothers; God has not brought us safely through so many and so great dangers to forsake us after all."  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7552-00000071"/> "2    I  SEA-DRIFT. She remained standing, leaning against Evan, when the foremost of the enemy's canoes speed- ily lashed hers in its wake. She could not avoid trembling a little, but she struggled hard that Evan should not remark it; and, immovable as a figure-head, she met the scores of eyes now levelled on her. The impression she made upon these savages was much that of her first experience-mong the Indians. Whether this impression would have been more Atin mo- mentary, however, she could not judge, since all hands were immediately, engrossed with appropriating the large quantities of fish caught or wounded ready for their picking up, in this contested fishing-ground. The last glimpse of the friendly tribe dis-" closed Perdita struggling on the bank, where Manu's powerful grasp- detained her from reck- lessly dashing back to Eva, whom she loved so-well. Then Manu and the men beside him, with one wild gesture of rage and grief and-: farewell to Eva, and brandishing their useless bows in signs that might mean only rage, or might mean rescue, daragged the rebellious Per- 4*   '  SEA-DRIFT.      143 dita- swiftly on, until they were lost sight of in the tangled forest-deeps.

Luti heard, and, though she shook and trembled, and crouched -still at her young mistress's feet, yet the gentle tones had brought a breath of comfort. But Morgan and Evan could make no reply. They had, in these weeks, gained from their vanquished allies many a half-guessed anecdote of these their foes' ferocity. And if the boys felt some dread for themselves, how much did they not feel for Eva? "It was my persiasion first," said- Morgan, after a brief silence, "which induced you to come with us to-day. Oh! if you had not lis- tened to me -had remained behind " "Morgan, Morgan, how  can\ you speak thus?" she broke in, reproachfully; "and what could Ayah Luti and I have done with- out youttwo? We should have grieved our- selves to death, that's all.

Ah, no! thank God that He has brought us all together to this new point in our journey. She strove to speak even cheerfully, and she succeeded as the brave, true-hearted should. And when now, with a word of command, the savages turned their bows and shot down stream again, with Morgan's canoe in the midst, lashed behind another, the three sat down, and calmly dwelt upon the hope of rescue. Luti indeed could not be persuaded to raise her head, so did she shrink from be- holding those terrible, -red-smeared counte- nances, with their elongated, flapping, spaniel ears, their feathered nostrils, and the enormous hanging under-lip, with its great plug of stained red wood thrust in, And so down they went upon the 'rushing current. They only stopped once, for a short while, at a rocky island a few yards square, piled up with drift-wood, which in the rainy season this impetuous river had cast up upon o    SEA-DRIF T. "5- it. Eva wondered why this halt was made, but speedily perceived it was to cook the fish cap- tured. They seemed to be doing this in quanti- ties, and Morgan, who got out and built his fire on the very verge, quite close to his canoe, took the hint. He also, with Evan's assistance, prepared enough to last for several days, from the fish which had leaped, or which he had stored, in his canoe. As they were busied there, a chattering par- rot flapped his green wings quite close above their heads. In an instant, thinking this a good opportunity to impress the by-standers with wholesome awe, Morgan drew forth his loaded and till then unused pistol, and with one last flutter the bird, hovering very near the heads of the Indian group, fell dead upon the ground. Morgan had read of the savages' awe of fire- arms, although they were not quite unknown to the Indians near his old home.' And so he was prepared for the terrified excitement which ensued. The wild men, who had been watching him, and so traced the fall of the bird to him, though they had not been able to mark the 13      CK  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7552-00000073"/> "6-     SEA-D RIFT. flight of any deadly missile, shrank back, crouch- ing behind and pitching over each other, in the utmost consternation. For there lay the bird, with hardly a feather ruffled, yet stretched out, evidently lifeless. And sall this -accomplished, with a flash of lightning and a crash of thunder, by the out- stretched arm of this pale-face! It looked very like magic, certainly; and as magic and en- chantments were the only well-defined and firm- fixed part of their religious-faith, no wonder they stared aghast onQ Morgan, the magician. But presently this feeling passed away. They began to doubt, or at least wished to examine for themselves. So one among them rose up, and was drawing slowly nearer to the bird, when Morgan sprang forward with warning gestures, seized it, and flung it into'the stream, giving them to understand by signs that all manner of evil might be theirs if they should touch it. "Oh, Morgan!" laughed Eva, as she watched the floating bird; "how much faith would they have in you, if some great hawk or water-snake   SEA-DRIFT..      147 should appear just now and gobble up the poor little parrot? The savages would doubt your magic." Nothing doubting, however, they went on their way. But Eva, presently looking back, saw an alligator raise his ugly head, and the parrot disappeared. But fortunately, she then thought, she alone saw; and she had her quiet little ugh at the magician without drawing the attention of the Indians.  Eva had a dim hope that the dread of Mor- gan might induce them to cut loose from his canoe. But it did not carry them quite that length, although they signified, by many a cringing attitude and gesticulation, that he and his party had nothing to fear from them. They kept at a respectful distance too, until the jour- ney was resumed. - .. .      X,  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7552-00000074"/> CHAPTER XVI. MORGAN S MAGIC. T HEY continued floating down with the river's current, and not until the second night landed and encamped. Now was the time for anxiety, and all manner of tales of savages and cannibals crowded on Eva's and even the boys' minds. Happily Luti knew nothing of such tales, and ere this had assured herself that there was no reason why this tribe should not be- come as friendly as the other. But Eva slept little, though Morgan and Evan watched over her by turns, never suffering their camp-fire, which they had built somewhat apart from the others, to burn low. Nothing, however, occurred to break the quiet of that night. With the dawn, the march was taken up, striking across the country from the right bank of the stream. They were going farther and farther from their kind friends -and "8   SEA-DRIFT.      I49 allies who inhabited the lefthank. But then they were going nearer to the Xingu, they re- membered as some encouragement, and buqyed themselves up-upon the thought. The third was a memorable day indeed--a day which put an end to such faint hopes as the distant Xingu might hold out, and which set the captives, save Luti, who seemed blind to the signs of the times, to revolving impossible plans of escape. And it was Morgan's revolver which wrought this change. It happened in this way:--It was toward evening, and their captors, still respectful and awe-struck, though fast becoming friendly, gave them to understand that they were very neat their journey's end. Weary and foot-sore with the toilsome march through tangled under- growth, Eva was expressing her delight to Morgan as they walked on, with the Indians in front and behind, like van and rear-guard, when suddenly, crash went the overhanging jungle, and before any one hard time to -think or to draw back, a huge tiger sprang full upon an 13 o  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7552-00000075"/> 50      S EA-DRIFT. Indian, almost directly in front of the captives, crushing the man instantly to the earth. 'oh ! Evan -Morgan--save him !" cried Eva, beside herself.with an agony of pity, and not once remembering to fear for her own neighborhood. Evan was unarmed, but Morgan had levelled his pistol almost before Eva spoke the word. There was one struggle between the savage and the; brute, and, as the latter came upper- most, Morgan fir`d. His aim was true. Shot through the heart, the tiger half leaped up, and then fell over on his side, dead. But the man. never stirred, never drew him-. self away from the fearful neighborhood. Mor- gan sprang forward and lifted him up, so that the still lingering light fell on the upturned face. It was rigid, fixed in ghastly horror, staring up with glassy eyes that might see nothing in this world again. The tiger's claws had struck deep --the cruel fangs had met to- gether in the throat. That one brief struggle between man and brute had been the death- struggle, and Morgan's rescue came too late.   SEA-DRIFT.       15t Morgan had raised the lifeless head upon his arm as he stooped upon one knee beside the body. Now he turned to the by-standers, sign- ing them that all was over, and beckoning them to draw near; but, to his amazement, a wild simultaneous cry, which he at once un- derstood to be of rage and dismay even more than of wailing for their dead, broke from them. * Its meaning flashed over him. He had raised his arm, had sent forth on the death-errand that magical thunder-crash, and the man and tiger had reeled over, and were dead! That death, of course, the savages laid to his charge! He remembered only too welY how, just for amuse- ment, he had imposed on their credulity about the parrot, and perceived they had not forgot- ten his signs and gestures then. In vain he pointed to the man's wounds,ither of which would have caused death. They o0nly scowled the more, and turned away, evidently- afraid even to lift up the body and to bear it with them; though, indeed, Morgan had read that the wildest and fiercest 'of these tribes  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7552-00000076"/> 152      SEA-DRIFT. showed an utter disregard for their dead, and even for their wounded and their aged. Very soon they were upon the march again as before. But Morgan kept a vigilant lookout. He perceived that fear alone prevented them from taking his life then and there--and with his life, might not those of his three companions be involved? But it was useless to alarm the others; for even Evan had no means of defence., I So he said not a word when Eva presently re- J marked upon the changed aspect of -the In- dians, which she attributed to grief for the lost comrade. But words cannot describe his relief when, just as the sun sank, with a broad and fiery glow, which burned even through the matted jungle, the movements of the men ahead, and tieir shouts, which were replied to by neighboring voices, showed that -the jour- ney's end was reached at last.- And yet there was nothing to be seen but, clear of undergrowth, grove of most gigantic trees, which rose up, branchless, to stupendous height, and then, above, sent forth great boughs, which lapped and interlapped from tree to tree,    SEA-DRIFT.       I53 until they formed a roof, impenetrable to the beholder. Where those answering voices came from, in the midst of this apparent solitude of vast gray colonnades and emerald arches, it would have been hard to say; until, on gaining the centre of the group, the foremost Indians paused at a tree which, to a stranger, would have been indistinguishable from its score of companions. One man swept aside- the brush- wood clustering at its base, and disclosed a hollow. Into this his comrades followed his lead, and were soon mounting a flight of rude steps cut in the interior of the tree, and over which, from the high summit, light streamed through an aperture. Morgan hesitated as he was sullenly mo- tioned to enter the hollow. He was deliberat- ing as to the best order of ascending that flight. If he let Evan lead the procession, then the servant, Evaa next, and himself bringing up the rear, they might seize him from'behind. But an the other hand, he reflected that if he went irst, they might very easily cut him off from his companions, and -might wreak their ven-   &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7552-00000077"/> W54      SEA-DRIFT. geance on them, whom he would be beyond helping. If, however, he were to enter last, his pistol could protect Eva and the rest, and the savages, it might be, would fear to attack him. So he signed to Evan to go- first, and he fol- lowed last, turning frequently, to show those  behind that he was on -the watch. He judged rightly that they feared to ap- proach him nearly, or even to let fly an arrow i from a distance, while that terrible right arm, " i which had twice poured forth thunder and light- - ning, smoke and death, rested behind his back half-pointed toward them. So they suffered him unharmed to mount the stairs, until he emerged at the top, and stood facing the opening, which was like that of a trap-door, while he leaned against a wall. Yes, it was really true-he leaned against the wall of a small, conicaI-shaped hut, built of branches' thatched with palm-leaves! And, not only that, but, ranged like -one long and very broad street -of a village, there was a score of just such huts,. with the massy interlacing, living and growing. limbs of the trees beneath for   SEA-DRIFT.       I55 natural foundation, and strengthened by boughs which had been woven in by the Indians, with a carpeting of leaves and grasses superadded. Of course Morgan did not take in all this at one glance. But he did take in the fact that he was standing, almost in the centre of the vil- lage, and that swarms of women and children, and some few men, mostly aged, were pouring from the tiny huts, like ants from their conical hills, and too much absorbed in curious staring at the white strangers to take any special no- tice of their returned warriors. And he did take in the fact, moreover, that upon the next five moments depended life or death, not only for himself, but for the three whom he con- sidered in his charge, and for whose safety he held himself responsible. Quick as thought he had placed Eva in his stead close against the wall of the hut, while Luti flew to her side, clinging to her. There was more difficulty in inducing Evan also to stand back with them, and he only yielded when Morgan, said resolutely: "Unarmed, what could you do?. If you do   &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7552-00000078"/> 156      SEA-DRIFT. not leave the entire management to me, I throw my pistol instantly down into the hollow. They are afraid of me -'stand back!" So Evan did stand back; and Morgan stood forward, his arm half raised, and, his eyes fixed unshrinkingly upon the thronging faces, where curiosity was the predominant expression. But upon a few words interchanged'with the now ascended warriors, curiosity gave way to'that same look of fear and' hatred which Morgan had observed in his captors ever since he had fired that fatal shot. There seemed no one to take his part; and when now a woman, proba- bly the dead, man's squaw, flung herself upon the leafy ground, and tore her hair and howled forth shriek after shriek with a heart-rending blending of rage and despair, the fury against the supposed murderer increase dwith every instant. Morgan had thought he was prepared for this; but the reality was a thousand times more appalling than the anticipation. All those wild black eyes glaring upon him- the air filled with savage yells-hand after "hand clenched menacingly, or brandishing bow or   SEA-DRIFT.       157 spear - what wonder that he had almost dropped his weapon as his hold upon it relaxed nerve- lessly? But only for an instant. So mich de- pended, with Heaven's help, upon his nerve, that it must not, fail him now. So, steadily-, again he confronted all those men, and saw that fear of-him could not keep down their rising fury many moments longer. Not many moments longer; but before that selfsame moment passed, thdre .came a move- ment in the- crowd - a swaying to and fro, and parting; for a gaunt tall man, his features hag- gard with illness, strode out from a hut at the farther end of the village street. Every one gave way from his path with marks of respect- nay, even awe; and, with his spear slung across his shoulder, he advanced, and appeared, by an- imperative gesture or two, to be demanding the meaning of all this commotion. At once fierce cries and angry gestures were redoubled, and Morgan was not slow to comprehend that his foes were making their own story good. What could he do? Quite powerless to clear him- self, he could only await the chief's sentence. "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7552-00000079"/> 158      SEA-DRIFT. And it came -the spear was slowly lifted - stretched out toward the captives. Eva, for the first time fully-comprehending the danger, when she saw that spear uplifted, started forward from her shelter behind Mor- gan with a piercing cry. The chief's glance fell on her suddenly. Horror-stricken, Evan caught her arm. But it was too late to hope that she could escape observation. The chief advanced, his gaze riveted upon her. Indeed, it seemed as if he were drawn on- by a spell, so strangely and so mechanically he moved; and, as he reached her, he- prostrated himself upon his face before her, and laid the spear submis- sively at her feet. This conduct was perfectly inexplicable, and the four captives were inclined to fear it was in some sort a preliminary ceremony to their sa- crifice, But the chief quickly lifted himself as the tribe pressed round. He turned and spoke vehemently and rapidly to them. Of course not even' Ean could this time comprehend a syllable; but his gestures and the expression of his face were, at all events, not hard to un-   SEA-DRIFT.   ,59 derstand. They meant friendship, nay, even reverence, for the little- fair maiden and her companions-meant friendship just as surely as did the scowling looks and sinister, sidelong e glances of the tribe mean enmity. However, at his command, the savages now dispersed to their huts, while he led the way to the farther end of the village, whence he had come in time to deliver the captives.  There stood two huts opposite each other, and into one he motioned Eva's party, while he disappeared into the other, which, from its superior size and build to all the other huts, they imagined to be the chief's own abode. The moment they spent standing close together within the entrance where he had signed to them to wait, was a moment full of suspense. They could hardly credit their deliverance, and wondered what new form 1f- edanger was to take, when he emerged from the opposite door- way, dragging after him two or three ham- mocks and several finely-dressed skins. These he deposited at Eva's feet, departed again, and this time reappeared with an armful of dried  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7552-00000080"/> SEA-DR I F T.  fish, plantains, and a small sack of mandioca flour, besides a jar of water. These, too, he offered to Eva. "Goldilocks again,", said Morgan to her. "Your tresses, Miss Eva, seem to be worth even more to us than if they were all co'ned into so many golden guineas. Among -the friendly tribe they brought us no end of awe and kind attentions; and her, among these sa- vages, they ransom our very lives." Eva hardly heard. She was gazing fixedly on the Indian, whose features were illuminated by the flickering glare of a torch he now lifted and held toward Eva. She did not observe his gesture. She stood there with parted lips, a flusM stealing into her hitherto so pale cheek, and her clasped hands half raised. Brighter and brighter waxed the flusi -softer and yet more sweet the dawning smile. She glided forward and touched the Indian's arm. And, as he bent down toward her, shed laid her little hand on a deep scar on his brow. "Evan," she cried, "thank God! It is the   wounded savage whom we found deserted in his hammock on the river!" And so it was. Their bread cast upon the waters had been returned to them after many days.    &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7552-00000081"/> CHAPTER XVII. A LESSON FROM rHE ANTS. TIME passed on, bringing little change in the daily life in "The Eyrie," as Evan had rather ambitiously named the cosy green nest which sheltered those who so longed to fly away, and yet could find no wings. They so longed--not that they did not receive constant care and protection from the chief-not that they were less comfortable in ,he Eyrie than in- the cottage on the river, for, though smaller,  they had modelled it exactly after that abode. s But they were as closely confined to their own nest as birds who have not learned to fly. There was no safety for them in venturing  down the village. Neither was there any plea- sure to, be found in going where they met but scowls and threatening gestures and mutterings,  the words of which they did not understand, indeed, but which had need of no interpreter to ! " - f "- * -. *- * *  162   SEA-DRIFT.     '  163 convey their meaning. At first, they tried to content themselves with beautifying their home, with adding rooms and porticos out of the branches round, and with making furniture, of the wood and skins which the chief placed at their disposal. And just at -first, time did not hang so heavily upon their hands. Their one friend had been recovering from illness on their arrival; but as he grew quite well again, he took part in frequent hunting expeditions, on which Evan and Morgan and even Eva and Luti always accompanied him closely, for. there would have ibeen no safety in the,^illage for them during their protector's absence. These expeditions were fatiguing to the girl and the old woman, but their life among the friendly Indians had in part inured them to fatigue, and they felt it less and less. But soon the rainy season came-; and then, beyond a yery rare ex- pedition in canoes, there was nothing to do but sit within the-hut and think, or walk upon the interwoven edge of boughs which skirted this end of the village. At first, almost all the thoughts-and conver-  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7552-00000082"/> i64      SEA-DRIFT. sation were of days gone by. That was a sub- ject not to be exhausted, and not one of the group of four ever wearied of telling of his or A paer life before the Petrel sailed from England. , Then too, every one of their adventures sincpe the wreck would bear discussing many times together. Not a detail was forgotten. "Do you know," said Eva, one evening when they had been chatting together for some time' round the embers burning on the large flat stone which served them for a hearth in the mid- dle of their sitting-room-"do you know it seems to me this tribe must have caught the idea of their airy village from those ants that ran over me so, that morning we first saw savages in the woods. Don't you remember how they built right on the top of a tall cane, and used the hollow stalk for a passage up and down, just like the savages use that hollow tree? What a wonder-book we 'll write when we get home, won't we? I'm sure no traveller's tales have told these things which we have seen." She had not read that a world-famous travel- ler has given some account of such a tribe as   SEA-DRIFT.       165 this, which, however, could not be studied closely in its aerial abode, quite beyond reach of civilization. These savages are the most difficult of all to tame, for they swoop down from their nests like birds of prey upon their enemies, and take flight up again away from civilization. "I wonder how our red friends found such a convenient hollow?"Evan remarked; "or what they would have done if they had not found it. Swung themselves down by some kind of a ladder, I suppose." The question had never occurred to them be- fore, and they had not imagined that the hollow was not the result of accident, but of labor in working out the pith by the savages, who, when the one trunk fell into decay, repeated their la- bor on another.- "Oh!" cried Luti, "if they had all those ants to work for them, Missy, as they worked for themselves in the cane, they soon could hol-- low out that tree. There's one, you know, lopped off 'most even to the floor in my room, and I  chopped off a piece yesterday to kin-  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7552-00000083"/> I66      SEA-DRIFT. die the fire with, and it's nothing but pith inside." Morgan started. He had been lounging list- lessly upon his elbow, but he raised himself and looked at Luti eagerly, while his lips parted. But he said nothing-only, with heightened color, after a moment left the room, pickingfup w his large hunting-knife and a fire-brand from the hearth-stone as he went. "Where are you going now?" asked Evan, carelessly. "Going to come back in a minute," Morgan answered in the same tone, and closed behind him the light door of woven boughs which swung between this and the adjoining room. He came back in less than a minute, indeed - came back with his face aglow, and his whole manner showing the greatest excitement. Eva sprang to her feet; for something had evidently happened, and anything that happened must be some new danger, she thought. "Follow me," he said, and the ring of his voice put an end to alarm; "I have something to show you all."   SEA-DRIFT.      I67 He led the way straight into Luti's closet of a room. They stared round the light of the fire-brand. What could Morgan mean? Thre was cer- tainly nothing there which they had not seen a hundred times before-hammock and home- made chair and table. Was the boy demented? He went straight to a corner of the room, and knelt down by the tree-stump which was lopped off near the floor. "Come here, all of you!" he cried, in a tone of exultation. "What in the world do you mean?" they cried in a breath. "Mean! I mean to escape, if we can all learn a lesson from the ants! If they can hollow out a way, why should not we? This pith is soft as soft can be. We can't eat through it, it is trie; but why should we not dig through it, Evan and I, with hunting-knife and hatclet?" Why not, indeed?  Beginning with that night, the work was carried on; and, as the boys dug, the girl and the old woman found enough to do with letting down a hammock after them to be filled with pith, which was then t '  "  '   " *!  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7552-00000084"/> 168      SEA-DRI FT. drawn up and hid away beneath a false floor, which the boys soon arranged over the other, and which fitted over the stump too, Meantime the rainy season was passing away; for the process of hollowing the tree was not very rapid, as nothing could be done in the daytime, since the chief was in the habit of walking in at all hours, and of regularly sup- ping with them, and remaining till after their evening hymn. Not that he could comprehend it. Eva could not even teach him as she had taught Manu's tribe; for she did not know one word which he could understand. It may be that he felt there was some worship of an un- known God in their devotions-it may be only, as the poet says, that " music hath charms to soothe the- savage breast." At all events, he always came and listened; and was so alto- gether friendly, that Eva now and then had compunctions about working their way from him in this underhand and under-village style, But it was beyond the shadow of a doubt that any other escape was impossible. The chief, kind and generous as-he was, was quite deter-   SEA-DRIFT.      169 mined never to release them, evidently regard- ing Eva as a sort of guardian angel--if savages dream of such things--in whose possession was safety. Kind to them though he was, they had seen one or two instances of his exceeding ferocity when provoked to anger by any of his subjects, the mere recollection of which made Eva's blood run cold. ' So they dared not brave him, and far less dared they brave any other of the tribe, who, though their awe of Morgan was dying out through time, kept their hatred unabated, and were ever on the lookout for an opportunity of wreaking it. Who could say when that opportunity might come? Morgan felt it was not too soon when, on that last night, he and Evan dug through between the large roots of their tree, and parted the foliage of the vines and bushes which encircled its base, forming -a kind screen for the opening they had made. The moon was down, for it was nearly dawn, and they must wait until to-morrow night for their escape. But they paused one moment, drinking in a deep breath of the fragrant air, 16  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7552-00000085"/> 170      SEA-DRIFT. and thinking on to-morrow night, when once more they would drink in the breath of freedom. Suddenly they heard footsteps near their tree, and then, though it was very dark, they could just discern a human form which brushed against these very bushes. They held their breath, and when presently it moved away noiselessly, though hurriedly, they began the ascent again. Not too hurriedly, however, to stop now and then to deepen any step which seemed less secure for Eva and the poor old faithful servant.    CHAPTER XVIII THROUGH THE PITH. HEY say to-morrow never comes; but, be that as it may, at least it sent its night, which was all the eager young adventurers de- sired. By Eva's invitation, her kind friend, the chief, had supped with her; and, after the even- ing hymn which he was in the habit of coming in to hear, she had at parting laid her hand, as she would sometimes do, in his. with the prayer in her heart that God would teach him, for whom she could do nothing. And then, when she had sorrowfully watched that herculean figure, for the last time as she thought, until it disappeared beneath the doorway of his own hut, she hastened with the others to prepare for departure. The pith had been stowed away between the layers of the floor, walls, and roof, so that when the trap-door, interwoven so as to fit in nicely 171  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7552-00000086"/> 172      SEA-DRIFT. to the floor, should be drawn down when all were fairly in the tree, no trace of the excava- tion and no clue as to the manner of escape would be left behind. Morgan trusted that the superstition of the savages-would suggest, to the chief at least, that his golden-haired guardian had disappeared in as mysterious a manner as her first appearance. No other of the tribe, would be interested in the pursuit, he thought, but only too glad to get rid of the hated in- truders, by any means. So the trap-door was adjusted, and the es- cape fairly began, Evan in front, leading Eva down the steep, dark passage, and Morgan fol- lowing, assisting the servant, who was by far the most difficult subject, because of her ex- treme terror. However, the brother and sister had at last reached the bottom, and Morgan stayed just above their heads, supporting the old woman on a ledge which, with admirable forethought, he had cut, deeper; than the rest, as four could not possibly stand together on the narrow space, and he remembered there might possibly   SEA-DRIFT.       173 be some detention. There was, evidently. Eva and Evan paused so long in the darkness, that Morgan began- to wonder what -could be the matter, when he was roused by feeling Luti bend suddenly forward. The thought struck him that she was about to call out to those below; and, quick as that thought, he clapped his hand upon her mouth, luckily hitting on the right place in the pitchy , dark. He was afraid of a struggle then and there; so he quieted her by saying, in an al- most inaudible, whisper: "'Keep still, or you will fall below and break your neck. They are waiting there till it is safe to venture out. Not a sound, or we are all ruined." She obeyed.  Morgan, listening intently, could not hear a sound, and not a ray of light from the opening below pierced through the gloom. Eva and Evan hadrhot moved, then. Alarmed at the prolonged stillness, which- had lasted several moments, seeming hours to his anxiety, Morgan might have made some effort to discover the cause of a delay so inop- 16       .  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7552-00000087"/> I74      SEA-DRIFT, portune, when the silence was broken in a way which fairly took his breath away. "Mon pere! mon pere!" was uttered below him- rather breathed than uttered. The voice was Eva's. Had the girl gone mad? But, before Morgan had time to speak or move, the words were repeated, now clearly and distinctly. "Mon pere! mon pere! Perdita, O Perdita t" A movement followed, and a gleam of light, as the shielding boughs were thrust aside from the aperture at the tree's base. Morgan and Luti, it may be relied on, were not slow in following. And, once out in the open air, whom should they behold kneeling at Eva's feet, in a transport of joy, but Perdita herself Few words and hurried served as explana- tion. Evan, on gaining the opening, had been just about to push the boughs asunder, when Eva stayed his hand. She pointed to a shadow -a human shadow--thrown by the moonlight on the sward; for this tree -was on the out- skirts of the grove. The shadow was moving   SEA-DRIFT.       I75 to and fro, with restless and uncertain gait. Presently the figure which threw it came round within sight, and paused there, gazing fixedly upward, wringing her hands in sore distress. Yes, wringing her hands-for the two eager watchers saw that it was a young girl who stood before them. And they soon saw more. The two grasped each others' hands speechlessly, and Eva ventured to breathe out those two words which she knew well would disclose Perdita, if Perdita indeed it was. She was right. The girl started violently, looked around, then up again, and whispered the same words in answer. Between Perdita's agitation and the difficulty in comprehending when the language princi pally consists of signs, they gathered from her nothing more than that she had been on the watch there, in hope of seeing them, these three nights past; and that she was to guide them to a party of the friendly Indians. So, blithely indeed, they followed her lead. Hand in hand she and Eva were proceeding, when a something went crash, crash through the  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7552-00000088"/> 176      SEA-DRIFT.     , jungle, just ahead. Morgan sprang forward, his arrow fitted to his bow, when Perdita arrested his movements by the lowest of low whispers. Instantly, as at a signal, several men started forward from the thicket; and the foremost- one hardly can believe it, as Eva did not-the /foremost was Eva's father. : Oh the joy unutterable, as first she, then Evan with her, were held fast against that manly breast-as if only thus he could make sure they were no vision of the night!--the gladsome greetings from a dozen of their for- mer Indian allies!--and the long, full explana- tions round the merry camp-fire, with Eva's golden head pillowed on the shoulder of her father, whose eyes rested now proudly on his boy, now gratefully on Morgan, as Eva's soft voice recounted all that he had done for them. Nor was Luti's delight less, especially when her master told how her mistress and her nurslings all were saved, their boat and the other also having been picked up at sea by passing ships. Mamma and the children were all safe at home, in a lovely vale called La Picada, on the 'south-   S EA-DR I FT.      1" ern sea-coast of Brazil-many, many miles still distant, it is true, but with no danger lying between. And oh! how happy would mamma soon be, since she was broken-hearted, believ- ing them both drowned that fearful night. And for the manner of their rescue on this very night:-Yes, Morgan's mail-packet had floated safely off, after having lain a long time bedded in the sands, it was supposed, from the length of time it took to reach Para, a city-on the coast not more -than between one and two hundred miles from the spot where the Stormy Petrel first had touched Brazilian shores. The flag, which still, though torn to tatters, fluttered at the mast, drew attention to the wreck, the package of letters was descried, and by means of the French-(here Morgan looked at Eva, who smiled back) -its contents were under- stood; and forwarded at once to Rio Janeiro. The officials there soon traced Grafton to his newly purchased plantation in La Picada Val- ley, and he, though with very little hope him. self, and not daring to tell his mourning wife of: it, made her understand that he. was compelled M - *.  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7552-00000089"/> I78  '   SEA-DRIFT. to go at once to Para on most pressing business. Then, leaving with her a friend who had emi- grated with them on the Stormy Petrel, he set out at once for Para; and there finding an ex- pedition of Portuguese ready to start for the diamond mines in the interior, by dint of per- suasions and a heavy sum of money he induced them to ascend the stream his children had as- cended, as he found rom Morgan's sketch, in- stead of the Xingu, which ran parallel. The rest was easy to imagine. Following the stream, they came upon the friendly Indians, and, by. aid of Portuguese inter-  preters, learned from Manu the fate of the golden-haired "daughter of the sun" and her three companions. -These Indians were easily prevailed upon to lead. an attack on their old enemies; and Perdita, who had been captured from the latter years ago, and who had forgot- ten neither their abode nor their ill-treatment, volunteered as guide. She had, through Manu, advised Mr. Grafton, who led the party, to let her reconnoitre, and, if possible, learn some- ' thing of the lost ones, before venturing an at-   SEA-DRIFT.       I79 tack, since, even with fire-arms, the enemy's position was almost hopelessly impregnable. This he had most reluctantly consented to do for- three nights past, but on the morrow the, attack was to have been made. How thankful were the three that last night had completed their preparations, since they were well assured their friends could hardly have rescued them, even with those magic rifles, which, to the friendly tribe's disappointment, were not des- tined to blaze away with ruin on their foes. A happy trip was that up the river again to the old settlement, where, with gifts which man, woman, and child of the village considered most munificent, they parted from Manu and his tribe, who, one and all, most regretfully shook hands, as they had learned, in farewell. But -Perdita threw hWerself before Eva, whom she  loved so well, and clung to her in despair, im- ploring, in language which her tearful sobs and gestures well interpreted, to be allowed to fol- low    her whithersoever she might go. Mr. Grafton, though touched, looked on, uncertain what was right to do, until her heart-rending &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7552-00000090"/> I80      SEA-DRIFT. "Mon pere! mon   pere!" mingled wail- ingly with the words he did not understand. Astonished and deeply moved, he sought an explanation from Eva, who gave him all she had been able to learn of the poor girl's history. He instantly interceded with Manu and his fat, easy-going wife, to let him take Perdita, who, he told them, might have parents seeking her, as he had even now been seeking his own chil- dren. So Perdita went, though she parted from her Indian friends with tears more bitter far than Eva's. i    , \   CHAPTER XIX. MON PIRE. ON our travellers went, through the vast forest, and then across the plains of Parexis rolling like vast waves and often rising in the distance like a mountain range. The beasts of burden bound for the diamond mines labored wearily over miles and miles of sandy soil, wellnigh barren, save for the wiry grass, a foot high, with its small, rough, lancet-shaped leaves, which the hungry animals in grazing pulledup from the roots. Here and there, upon the borders of the frequent streams, the vegeta- tion flourishes, and birds and the smaller herbi- vorous animals are seen to build and burrow; but, for the most part, ants might seem to have colonized the district through which Mr. Graf- ton's party were now passing. These busy little folks had built on undisturbed, and their spa- io us residences rose in groups to the height 16 ian            r  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7552-00000091"/> I82      SEA--,DR I FT.  of five or six feet. Besides these, many another wonder of nature might be found even in that , desolation. But as Eva, with La Picada like a charm which led her on, was in too great haste to stay to seek for wonders on the way, we too must pass on hurriedly. Into the woods again they went; and, at last, one evening emerged from them on the head- waters of a river, and in the near vicinity of the long-wished-for diamond mines. It was a lovely sunset, and as the crimson tide from the far westerr wooded range flooded the silver, thread-like river, and glowed across the laden orange-grove which half embowered a white chacra, or farm-villa, Eva's lips parted in a cry of delight. "Oh, papa, papa!" she exclaimed, "cannot we stay here to-night, and rest? Don't you think the lady of the house would let us?" Her father smiled, and rode forward to make the request, and Eva turned to Perdita. But Perdita's eyes had no smile responsive to hers. Instead, there had crept into them a troubled and uncertain look; and when Eva   SEA-DRIFT.       183 tried to make her speak, she would say nothing, only gazed around more and more wildly when, on his father's return with an invitation to alight from the gentleman to whom the chacra be- longed, Evan lifted her from her horse, and Eva drew her arm within her own and led her on. They passed through the orangF grove, and there, before the pretty villa, was seen a small oval court, curiously paved in tessellated frag- ments of the vari-colored quartz so plentiful in the diamond districts. In the midst played a fountain, tossing its spray high up among the boughs of two gray, primeval trees which lap- ped their overarching leafy dome above it, reaching from their stand on either side: of the pavement. Perdita stopped short, with ayet more troubled glance around. Then suddenly snatching her arm  from Eva's, she dropped.:./ down on the fountain's ledge, and, bowing her head upon her knees, she shivered and moaned there, unheeding the efforts made by Eva, Mor- gan, and Evan to arouse her. Mr. Grafton was standing conversing with his host, a distinguished-looking Frenchman,  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7552-00000092"/> !84 .     SEA-DRIFT. when the attention of, the latter was attracted by the moaning of the poor girl. He pointed her out to his companion, and immediately both gentlemen descended the steps and advanced to inquire the cause of her distress. As they walked, Mr. Grafton gave such an account of her history as he was familiar with. M. De Vigne, or Don Antonio, as every one here called him, said nothing, but a cloud, it might be of sympathy or of some sorrowful memory, darkened his brow. "The poor child! the desolate little one!" he murmured in French, as he bent over her. Suddenly, as if roused by something in his: voice, though not even Eva's had hard power to move her, she raised her head, and fixed her full dark eyes upon his- face. And he on his part was not less startled. "Louise! how strangely like Louise!" he cried. At the sound of his voice again, she trembled inexpressibly, and her lips parted in an uncer- tain, yet an eager, oh! how eager cry: "Mon pere! mon pere!" "Louise! my little, lost Louise!"   SEA-DRIFT.       I85 There needed nothing more. The child's heart, stirred by the i'ndefinable memories lin- gering round this haunt of her infancy, had leaped to meet those long-lost though remem- bered tones. For ten years ago, when Louise was four, upon these diamond mines, then but beginning to be worked, had one night descended a strong band of savages, who then roamed the country through, even to this point. And when Don ' Antonio, who was many miles away, returned, it was to find himself a childless widower. His wife lay dead here in the court, and he had never doubted that his only child was murdered too, for these Indians were not wont to spare. But who shall describe the joy now filling the once so gloomy homestead?  It was a pretty sight to watch the two as they sat to- gether, he striving so to comprehend her signs and string of Indian words, and she from time to time explaining them all by one of her own brilliant smiles and those-only words of her mother-tongue which she knew so well--"Mon pere! mon pere!" 16   &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7552-00000093"/> CHAPTER XX. THE DIAMOND MNE. THE   next morning Don Antonio offered to show his guests, who expressed a de- sire to see them, the diamond mines where he had made his fortune. He procured from a neighbor a huge old family conveyance, drawn by four fine mules, which rattled up to the house at an early hour. Louise, as every one now called her, was more terrified than pleased at first, and regarded the sleek and quiet ani- mals very much as Eva was wont to regard the jaguar of the jungle. But by dint of being lifted to'her seat by Evan, and being kept fast there by Eva's hand in hers, she soon became reconciled to her position, and looked about, her eyes bright with some pleasure and more curiosity. Eva's curiosity was no less. She had heard of diamond mines, and her ideas were formed upon a design-she had once seen 1I86   SEA-DRIFT.       I87 of the silver mines, where the precious metal was visible in veins along the deep, cavernous rocks which hadl been opened to break out the treasures of the earth. So, when she was told that the diamond mines were not subterranean, she gazed eagerly along both sides of the uneven road, expecting every moment to see the moun- tain-cliffs, between which it wound, sparkle in the sunshine with myriads and myriads of daz- zling gems. She thought of the ring her mother always wore. But no such shining sight presented itself here. If possible, the country grew more ster- ile yet. The sandy, pebbly hillocks were al- most bare of trees and grass. How wretched this seemed, after the wild luxuriance to which Eva had been accustomed for-so many months i She decided in her own mind that unless the diamond mines were very, very bright indeed, and sparkled with all the colors which she so missed here, she would not beg her father to come and live among them-so desolate were their surroundings. But, as the conveyance slowly lumbered up a height which commanded-  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7552-00000094"/> I88       SEA-DRIFT. a treeless, barren valley, what was her amaze- ment to hear her host, the intendant, say: "See-there is the diamond mine, down- there." "The diamond mine! Oh, but Don Antonio, I don't see anything like diamonds, I am sure." "And did mademoiselle, then, expect to be flashed blind?" he answered, good-humoredly. "The gems would be valueless, my dear young lady, were they thrown, as it were, into every one's grasp. No -nature has hid them away, and made.'them difficult to reach, as she has most things worth the reaching for." "But where  " "Here we are now, at the foot of the hill. Pedro shall drive up, and we will show you in a moment how we do." Pedro did drive up--or rather down--and away they rattled, over sandy, pebbly earth, close beside what seemed like the half-drained bed of a river. Here the master gave the word to halt. The carriage stopped at the end of a shed, much longer than broad, roofed in by a thatch of palm-leaves, supported on very tall ^   'SEA-DRIFT.      189 slim poles at either side. Beneath, troughs were ranged crosswise, and through them rushed streams like diminutive waterfalls, which were led from the half-drained river, and which washed through a heap of dark and gravelly earth piled against one end of the troughs. At the other end of each trough stood a negro, grubbing in the earth and water for the dia- monds which the force of the water would loosen from the earth. Facing the negroes, just the other side of the heaps of earth, a fresh supply of which these miners now and then raked into their troughs, were ranged four or five high stools, on which sat the overseers. These stools were made-without backs or arms, that the overseers might not lounge or fall asleep on duty, but watch the negroes all the time, let they might take an opportunity to hide the rich treasures they occasionally brought to light. All looked on with interest. But to Louise the black figures in their shirts and short trow- sers of white, were a sight she could not under- stand. She stared with the most puzzled  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7552-00000095"/> I90      SEA-DRIFT. expression in her great dark eyes, and turned to Eva, seeming to wish to question her, but could not find the words, and seemed unable to express herself in her usual language of signs. At that instant one of the miners, or, more properly, washers, lifted himself erect, raised his arms above his head and clapped his hands. Eva was startled, and Louise looked as if she thought he was about to make a spring toward her, especially as he showed his white teeth in a grin which extended from ear to ear. But thc soon discovered there was nothing more alarming than the finding of a diamond, of which the clapping of hands was the usual signal to the overseer; and the manifestation of delight was because the gem seemed to be of sufficient size to entitle the finder to a hand- some reward, as is the law. The intendant brought it from the overseer who received it, to show the party. And now the sight-seers set out upon their homeward way well pleased with the novelty of the day and the additions to their store of Brazilian knowledge; but not nearly so deter   SEA-D RIFT.      I91 mined that the diamond mines were the bright- est spots in Brazil, nor unwilling to see the coast before making up their minds on that point. Indeed, as Eva that night reluctantly admitted, though only in answer to Louise, there were many things about the Xingu far more beautiful than even' diamonds. And far more beautiful than even- diamonds seemed the sun as it rose upon the day which was to find the long-time wanderers indeed upon the road toward home-cloudless and undimmed by a tear of parting. For"M. De Vigne had obtained leave of absence from his duties, and accepted Mr. Grafton's urgent invi- tation to La Picada, unwilling to separate his child from her friends until they should help to reconcile her to her strange new life of civil- ization. &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7552-00000096"/> CHAPTER XXI. THE GOLD MNE. AFTER days of unremitting travel, when, at last, the coast was drawing near, the party stqpped one night at a chacra on the road-side. They were weary and worn, and longed for even one night's comfortable rest. They had been floating in canoes across the, country inundated by the Parana and its tribu- taries, until they entered at last the Rio Grande's mouth, and sped down toward the sea. They were only a long day's journey from Sari Paul's, near the head of the Rio Grande, and thence to Santos, on the coast, was one day more. And now, light-hearted with that knowledge even through their weariness, they rode up through a grove of plantains waving their tall fern-like foliage before a farm-house, which was raised on high supports above the ground. But what was their amazement, on approaching, to find 192   eA-DRIFT.       193 X the space beneath not free to air, but forming stalls for cows and mules. The walls were framed of wicker-work, plastered with mud, which plastering had in many places fallen, leaving the wicker-work both bare and airy. But they had hardly time for the first feeling of disappointment, when the master made his appearance, and extended' a welcome so cor- dial that everything else was forgotten. Indeed, everything was very soon forgotten in slumber, though the beds of the upper classes, sumptuous even to magnificence, as in- stanced in Don Antonio's home, were here re- placed by coarse sacks stuffed: carelessly with corn-husks. Yet, after that hearty welcome, a hunger-sauced supper of hominy and feiones- a bean which here forms the chief article of food -with stewed fowl and coffee,) and, above all, with the prospect of their journey's end, which seemed almost within sight, one and all soon fell into refreshing sleep. The next morning, as they discovered that their host was far less a farmer than a miner, and that his gold mine lay directly on their on- 17    *   N  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7552-00000097"/> 194      SEA-DRI FT. ward road, they accepted his invitation to look over it before they left. Eva's brilliant antici- pations, buried in the black mud of the diamond mines, did not spring up again on this occasion, so that she was very. agreeably surprised when, as the road turned an angle at the base of a steep and richly-wooded mountain, she saw, before her what appeared at first sight a series of miniature cascades, but on a nearer view proved, a flight- of earthy stairs cut in the mountain-side, every step being twenty or thirty feet wide, two or three broad, and about i one deep. On each one were standing half a dozen negroes in their white garb, stirring the earth with-shovels as the water leaps down' over it and washes it into a trench at the, mountain's foot. Down there, the proprietor explained, the grains and tiny lumps of gold fall to the bottom, and every week the-- trench: is cleared out and its mud washed thoroughly by hand in wooden bowls called gamellas, so that none of the precious metal can be lost. In many places on these hills, where water can be found to clear the earth away, particles of gold   SEA-DRIFT.       I95 are found in the soil, little deeper than the roots of the grass. Evan was half inclined to delay a- day's journey, in the belief that he might return to his mother after the fashion of the boy who found the golden goose. But Eva reminded him ot Hans in Luck, and he at length agreed with her in thinking Hans very sensible in being thankful in the end that he carried no burden to delay him an hour on the road. ,  a '"         "'  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7552-00000098"/> CHAPTER XXII. DRIFTED HOME. N the second morning from that which O  --shone upon the adventurers above the gold mines, they turned to take a last view of the city of San Paul's, where they had arrived the night before. How picturesque it was, with the rosy sunrise slanting across the low mea- dow-lands, which on three sides bounded the gentle eminence where rose the city fifty feet above the plain. DOn the fourth side a narrow ridge joined it with the mountainous land be- hind, where gray mists of dawn, surging and tossing down, resembled foaming water-falls; while the foot of the city's eminence, two or thrpe miles in extent, is laved by rivulets which, after heavy rain-storms, render it almost an island. The strangers had been wandering through the well-built streets, neatly paved with a stone 196   SEA-DRIFT.    ,   197 between the chinks of which many particles of gold are to be found washed out by long rains. They had passed leafy, flowery public squares, and handsome churches, where the Angelus bell was chiming. And, just behind where they had paused, some laborers were as- sembling to their work upon a half erected house. Truly that work was worth the moments spent in watching it. For the manner of build- ing even handsome residences and churches is a manner of San Paul's own, and quite different from anything the Graftons had ever seen be- fore. They were not a little interested, then, in observing the erection of this earthen house. The workmen set up, on either side of the line the wall was intended to occupy, a frame of half a dozen planks placed opposite each other, and proceeded to fill up the space between with earth, which was then beaten down with rammers, and now and then moistened with water, to make it stick more closely together. When the wooden frame was filled, it was moved farther on, and the same process repeated, until 17*  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7552-00000099"/> 198      SEA-DRIFT. the whole outer wall of the building was fin- ished-the doors and window-frames and beams being inserted in their places as the work proceeded. Sun and wind are then trust- ed to harden the mass, the walls are smoothed and will- take any tint. Outside they are stuc- coed in various colors, and inside are frequently adorned with graceful paintings. The work- men informed Mr. Grafton that these build- ings, most of which were raised to several sto- ries, were very durable, many in the city having lasted two centuries and a half. But the crowing of a cock from a garden hedge close by startled the loiterers into mov- ing on. His fote was so very loud and clear, and he continued on the last one so long, that Eva, ignorant of this peculiarity of the Paulista breed, began to think he meant to give a very emphatic warning to tarry there no longer, since 'Santos, a town upon the sea-coast, where the party would embark for La Picada, was yet quite a journey off. So she bade farewell at once to San Paul's, which greatly interested her, more especially since she had learned that it owed   SEA-DRIFT.       199 its settlement to the first shipwreck, ages ago, upon St. Vincent's Isle, off the coast. In good time the mules, which travel as fast on an ascent as on a level, accomplished that mountainous way to Santos on the sea; and Eva and Louise laughed over their thousand "hair-breadth 'scapes," when now they stood in safety on the guards of the tiny steamer bound for the Isle of Santa Caterina, behind which lay the Vale of La Picada. How grandly Santa Caterina dawned upon the sight at length, with its conical rocks rising precipitously from the sea, and behind these again the lofty, wooded mountain-range of Brazil, over the strait which separates, by only half a league, the island from the mainland. But Eva and Evan overlooked the island, with its cultivated slopes and plains, diversified by noble hills, to fix their gaze on that Brazilian range, which, their father said, frowned down on La Picada, which was here hidden behind the island. When the town of Santa Caterina was gained, they hardly saw how lovely it was, crowned by its cathedral, and nestling in orange  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7552-00000100"/> n00     SEA-DRIFT-. groves and gardens. But oh! how glad they were when the steamer left the port, passed but between clustering isles and forts, and made for the Brazilian shores. Opposite the town, they landed at the plea- sant village of San Jose, and there all acceded to Mr. Grafton's proposal that they should walk, since home lay so very near, at last. Home! Eva slipped her little, trembling hand in her father's, while she choked down a sob of joy. And Evan forgot his pride as a long-time warrior and pioneer, and suffered a tear to trickle down his sun-burnt cheek. But he did not forget his dear old comrade, Morgan, and laid his arm upon his shoulder as he walked, while Eva turned and smiled on them. So they went on through the balmy evening, while the shadows of the stupendous, western mountains lengthened upon La Picada's bloomy slopes, luxuriant in fields of coffee, rice, and corn. They had passed more than one pretty cottage embowered in fair gardens, with or- chards where the fruits of temperate and tropic climates ripened together. Suddenly Mr. Graf-   SEA-DRIFT;       2O!1 ton stopped, and pointed to a hill, the foot of' which dipped in the sea, while on its'summit, half seen through the crowning foliage, gleamed the white walls of a villa. Eva had just been looking up and thinking it the loveliest of all, when her father spoke. "Mamma is waiting there," he said. The children were for starting off at a full run; but their father checked them, saying that they must not take their mother by sur- prise--he must first speak to her. They stop- ped, though they wonder:c-d why good, as well as ill news, needed to be broken. And' ten they wound on up-hill, between the fragrant hedge-rows bordering rich fields. How slow seemed her father's -actually rapid step! and how quietly, though his color height- ened, and his eyes were brighter than usual, he conversed with Don Antonio upon the crops, the temperate and equable climate, and a fine plantation for sale in the neighborhood-a plantation which (we may peep into futurity just far enough to see); one happy day for Eva and Evan, owned Don Antonio for its master,  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7552-00000101"/> 202      SEA-DRIFT. and Louise for its little, half wild and wholly charming mistress. But. all this had not hap- pened when they reached the head of the lane, where a gate through the hedge gave entrance to a grove and garden, a perfect maze of fra- grance and beauty. 'Don Antonio insisted upon remaining here with Louise, until after the meeting between mother and children, and Morgan too stood still. Mr. Grafton turned then, and laid his hands upon the lad's shoulders. "'Morgan, my boy," he said, in a tone of the deepest feeling, "this is your home, remember -yours and Evan's alike. You two are bro- thers, and I shall no more give in to your wan- dering off again than to his. Stay " -as Morgan, much moved, shook his head, and was about to speak-"I understand you, but I do not mean either you or Evan to be idle. You both shall work hard for me." Morgan wrung his hand, and, with Louise and Don Antonio, waited at the gate. They had proceeded but a few yards up the walk when Mr. Grafton, who was in advance, -  SEA- D RIFT.      203 turned round, and made a hasty sign. In- stantly all three shrank back into the shelter of a clump of roses; for they saw a pale--so pale, sad lady in deep mourning, coming toward them, with a group of children. Eva felt Luti twitch her dress, and she had to turn to silence the old woman's raptures over the children. When she looked again, her mother, leaning on her father's arm, was walking this way. "How  very, very long you were gone, Charles!" she said, smiling up at him. "And what was this inexplicable business which de- tained you so?" "H thought"   he hesitated--"that I had tidings of-the wreck." She stopped, and clasped his arm with both her hands, her color flushing up, then dying out again with startling rapidity. "You have had tidings," she gasped. "Tell me--O my Father! help me to bear it!"  "And what if there were hope?" he an- swered, slowly. "Hope!" t   &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7552-00000102"/> 204-     SEA-DRIFT. "What if I have bhard our children had been cast ashore upon some distant coast-" He was watching her face anxiously, and saw the color light it up. "We will go seek- them," she said firmly. "But where-O   Charles!"--as a thought struck her-- you would never have told me this on a mere hope. You have heard-nay, you have- brought my children home to me!" As her words rang out, Eva sprang forward, and in a trice was in her arms. Evan was not far behind, and Luti had already made one armful of the three little ones, to her good old heart's contenL, though to the dubious satisfac- tion of chubby Miss Rosy, whose memory did not go a great way back. Can there be a doubt concerning that happy evening in the villa? The wanderers were safe at home at last they who had been like sea- drift cast helplessly upon an unknown shore. And when the so long houseless heads were once more pillowed softly at home, we may be sure their last thought was His who had sent down from on high, and taken them out of   SEA-DRIFT.       205 many waters-who feedeth His lambs in a green pasture. Constantly, when in after-days they talked together of their adventures, they remembered how, when they could not see their way, they had been led by Him whose "way is in the sea, and His path in the great waters, and His footsteps are not known."
