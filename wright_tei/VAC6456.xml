DEAR SIR:- THOUGH a stranger to your distinguished person, I feel sufficiently intimate with you, through the medium of your public career, to indulge the belief that you will pardon me the liberty I have taken in dedicating to you the following work. I count myself most fortunate in the accidental or predes-' tined conjunction of our "stars,"-for, in reality (as you will see on perusaD your name in connection with the succeeding volume is singularly appropriate, from the fact, that notwith- standing the perfection to which the science of Natural History had arrived during the former half of the present century, to you alone belongs the immortal honor of having first verified the existence of that hitherto fabulous amalgamation of fish and flesh-- the Mermaid. To that discovery, my dear Munrab, the following work owes its being, and I take this occasion publicly to express my gratitude for the services you have rendered, not only to science and the world in general, but to your humble servant in particular. Accept, then, the first fruits of one who appreciates your character through all its phases of boy, man, zoologist, plough- man, poulterer and showman, and that your stature may never be less, is the ardent wish of the author, FRED. FOLIO.    <pb n="0" xml:id="VAC6456-00000004"/> PREFACE. READER, a word with you aside. * * Yes, I have,written a book! "What for?"  And what for such a book? Why, secondarily, forfame, and money, of course. That is for myself. But primarily, to fill up a leisure space, on the score of philanthropy; that is for yourself. To be sure, what do others write books for, if not because they wish to do it. And why do they wish to do it, if not for independence, (competence I mean,) and for the public good. And now to save you the trouble of asking more questions, allow me to say, you may laugh as much as you like, but do not get angered, or, to, express it a little more genteelly give play to your risibilities if you find any thing to excite them, but stay your ire, for be assured we do not mean you in any instance. Just "stick a pin here," and as we have met, so may we continue, good friends. As to the selection of our subject, no doubt but you will call it fitly chosen. Lucky for the author, if, fortunately, you can say as much of its treatment. Here is a point. Stay a moment. Are you opposed to works of romance? The evidence is at hand, to show that every page embraces more of truth than of fiction. Would, for the credit of human nature, it were shadow instead of substance. Facts, however, can be adduced on the subject matter before us which cast the most romantic romance entirely into the shade. But are you grave and an enemy to satire? Well, so are we, except in certain cases. There is a time for every thing; a subject for every style, and a style for every subject. Would you discharge a seventy- four pounder, loaded to the muzzle, to demolish a worm's nest! So, instances occur when irony and burlesque are alike more apposite, and   <pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC6456-00000005"/> vi            PREFACE.  effective in the accomplishment even of good, than the formidable array of logic and sober argument. So thought Job, the pious patriarch, in answering his miserable comforters, and Elisha, the prophet, when he withstood the priests of Baal. Sedate reasoning is the distant cannonade whose spent balls roll harmlessly through the opening ranks of fanaticism, while merited ridicule is the hand to hand assault and on whose lightning-like shafts the hapless victims writhe in death agony. Or, in less figurative phrase, homilies for the thoughtful, restraints for the headstrong, and a rod for the fool's back. So much by way of apology. A word further explanatory and di- rectory, to prepare the way for the intelligent progress of the reader. Some portions of the work may be called unnatural. Well, that may be, but not more so, we venture to affirm, than the actual devel- opment of human nature in thousands of cases. Who has not seen individuals act very unnatural? If truly represented, therefore, their descriptions must appear as unnatural as themselves. Would you praise an artist for painting a monster with comely proportions, to avoid the charge of producing an unnatural picture of the human form? No matter how great the distortion or deformity, the true painter will give afac simile without flattery and without fear. How- ever the fastidious and those who see themselves reflected may sneer, the artist feels the satisfaction of knowing that he has made a faithful transcript of his subject. But the genuine critic will command the integrity and skill of the limner who dares to stamp truth on his canvas, regardless of conse- quences. And shall the literary artist be less scrupulous? Should we not be equally true to the life, as possible, in our delineations with the pen and the pencil? There are anomalies in human conduct, as well as in the human form or the works of nature. This fact, borne in mind, will save us from the charge of incongruity in the characters hereafter introduced. If, for instance, it be thought that Mrs. Wilson betrays undue ig-   PRIEFACE.              Vii norance and jealousy, at any time, we have only to say, that equal stu. pidity may often be found in much loftier stations than a village board- ing-house, So, if Miss Boston, now and then exhibits a want of judgment or good seanse, at variance with the native and established nobility of her character, set it down, not to the author, but the influence of error on even the soundest and most exalted minds. In the case of Badger, especially, is an instance of a brain com- pletely addled by fanaticism. In short, whatever may appear as in- congruous or unnatural in any of the characters brought forward, it only shows - the truth as it is -how far imposture, however absurd, can gain a footing; and what fanaticism does in making dupes and fools of otherwise very sensible people. How many intellects, great and small, have thus been thrown from their balance, to wander in the mazes of folly or plunge into imbecility, infidelity and insanity. Sad evidence of this have we in the mad-houses tenanted, families made desolate and the Uod of Truth impeached by the zealots of Spiritualism and Woman's Rights. Let the reader bear constantly in mind, that much of the book is in the form of prophetic revelation, and hence the scenes are laid in the future, but none the less truthfully on that account. We, indeed, write as a historian recording past events, but how we were transported so far in advance of the present and enabled to note things as those already come to pass, it is unnecessary to reveal. We will simply hint, how- ever, that possibly there may be such a thing as a spiritual telegraph, so much quicker than time  itself, that whoever is put in connection with it, gets the knowledge of current events long before they transpire. But, however much any one may doubt the prophetic portions of the fol- lowing volume, that, by no means, invalidates the remainder, which is veritable record of existing facts. And now ye critics of patrician rank and authority! Ye Conscript Fathers of the Republic of Letters! Be propitious!

Or, if you find it inexpedient to cheer him with the sunshine of your smile, do not, I pray you, descend from the height of your most se- rene seats to tread on an unfortunate and insignificant mortal, an ob- scure worker in this lower " sphere," yet whose aspirations, if not his deeds, merit your approval, not your scorn nor your ire, much less your vindictiveness, if, indeed, such passions can dwell in your celestial minde. Pardon the rashness of your supplicant, but were ye not once habitants, mortal and obscure, like our humble self, in this nether region? Think, then, of whence ye sprung, and keep bottled the gall and wormwood in which your red hot iron stiles are so often dipped. Were ye not taught by your good mothers never to be so naughty as to rob bird's nests? Let the memory of maternal instraction lead you to desist from destroying this, our literary bantling, which never did you any harm, and never can. O, ye gods and goddesses! Jupiter Stators, Apollos, Minervas and Vulcans, of criticism, Consent to pass our imperfections by; At least bend on us an indulgent eye. As to the fanatical and splenetic, the prejudiced or malicious Spirit- ualists and Woman's Rights elan, male and female, with their apolo- gists, we have no hope of propitiating them. They will, of course, pour out the vials of theirwrath upon the head of the unknown author. Their vocabulary will be exhausted in hard sayings against us, but it will only prove the old adage true, that a "wounded bird will flutter." So do your worst, ye " strong minded" and ye " spirit rappers." We fear you not. Vain will all your efforts be to destroy our book. Written, as it is, to expose to public contempt the two greatest humbugs of mod- ern times, it will be read by all sensible people, who are both disgusted with the follies and pained by the evils of Spiritualism and Woman's Rights. (    CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY. Some books are lies frae end to end, And some great lies were never penn'd, But this that, I am gaun to tell I' just as tru's the Deil's in h-ll, Or Dublin city." I recollect on a certain occasion, to have heard a clergy- man give out from the pulpit a notice something as follows: "There will be a meeting of the female ladies of this society, &amp;c."- naming the time and place, but the object of the, meeting has this moment escaped our recollection. We remember, however, of being sorely puzzled, at the time, to com- prehend his meaning; or to what order of bipeds a woman would belong who was not a female woman. But to those who may have the felicity of perusing the following delectable nar- ration, the matter will be fully explained. In fact, many now living are destined to see such changes as the history of the past can no where produce. Among the least of these novelties, is a new classification of the human species. Hitherto the division of the Genus Homo has been simply into male and female, but not long hence will be seen a subdivision of the latter into masculine and feminine , ,.     <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6456-00000007"/> 10         LUCY    BOSTON. women; the former appellation attaching exclusively and dis- tinctively to those who don the bi-furcated appendages of the sterner sex, and lead the van in the ownward march of woman's rights. WOMAN'S RIG HTS. Reader, we are about to give a veritable history of this movement, in the. course of which we shall make disclosures of a character so extraordinary, and open to the world events so startling in their nature that we fear credulity itself will almost doubt the authenticity of the simple narrative of facts which we are about to relate. But in this, our exordium, we wish distinctly to avow our admiration of the sex in general, and of female women in par- ticular; also that we are not so fool-hardy as to undertake a crusade against any of their long established rights. :+That they have ever worn the breeches in a figurative sense, and indirect- ly controlled the stronger sex, from Eve downward, as abso- lutely as Napoleon his legions, no one in his sober senses will for a moment deny, and any attempt to reverse or modify this time established order would be no less futile than Don Quix- ote's encounter with the wind-mills, or the efforts of Mrs. Par- tington to sweep back the tide of the ocean with her mop. The Atlantic was indeed aroused, and so was Mrs. Partington; but the contest was unequal, and after a gallant resist. ance, Mrs. Partington, like other great souls under adverse circumstances, was obliged to succumb* as all would be who should deny or seek to subvert the supremacy of wo- man's will. As to the matter of the work before us we disclaim all re-   FOLLIES OF   THE XIXTH    CENTURY.    " sponsibility. We do not discuss any abstract principle of right or wrong since all argument on the subject, pro or con., would be a work of supererogation. It is simply a record of historic facts, but differing from history in general in the- following important particular. It is not a recital of past events gleaned 'from musty documents, doubtful records, and still more uncer- tain traditions, but a history of the future as authentic and true as if drawn from that primal home of truth itself, " the bottom of a well," In fact, we have learned beyond a shadow of a doubt, that before the close of the present century the self-styled " lords of creation" will not only actually and liter- ally be sans cullottes, but regarded the weaker vessel and treated as such by their fair enslaver. But, says the skeptical reader, how is this mighty revolution to be effected? Not by sudden outhreak of warlike demon- stration. Man was never thoroughly conquered by the broom- stick. He may be subdued for the time and lie, like unhappy Poland, at the feet of his relentless subjugator; but, like Poland, will he seize every favorable opportunity for revolt. His submission is secured only by constant and untiring vigi- lance. For the most part woman's anger, like the convulsions of nature, is terrific, but does not endure. The storm-cloud may gather, break and discharge itself, till every valley becomes a miniature sea; in an hour it has passed away and the golden sunlight flashes on hill and plain which look all the more bright and glorious. for the storm that has swept over them. The showers of April are quickly followed by the sunshine of May.  So with woman. Her paroxysms of wrath are soon succeeded by the smiles of love and the kisses of peace.    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6456-00000008"/> 12       - LUCY    BOSTON. Against open attack we can defend ourselves. Woman is powerful but in her own sphere. 'Tis not when she assumes the "port of Mars," but when she puts on " the angel to de ceive" that we have ought to fear. And here, says the sapient reader to himself, here lies the danger. When woman "stoops to conquer" when she brings into play her smiles and her tears with her thousand coquettish arts, in short when she "Comes to lay, Her nets of roses in our way," then it is thatlosing our independence, we suffer ourselves to be bound as with fetters of steel. Yet impotent as we are under the enchantments of the sex, a want of preconcerted and united action on their part has thus far left us free.' Let them once realize their power,- let them combine as well as " stoop to conquer," and we may well dread the result. Mark that tiny streamlet as it. wends its way down the mountain slope. It issues from glittering dew drops brushed by the breath of spring from leaf and flower. Whispering its nothings to the summer breeze and coquetting with the flow- erets that fringe its banks, it goes dancing to the sound of its i own liquid music and laughing to scorn the obstacles which obstruct its progress. Joined successively by sister streamlets, anon, the aggregate swells into the majestic river, rolling on- ward to the ocean whose yielding but resistless folds encircle r   . the world. So with woman.  She will lure us with syren song, she will strew with garlands her conquering path, and wreathe our chains with fairy favors till submissive, cringing slaves, we lie at her feet, then Sampson like, are we delivered into the hands of the Philistines.   FOLLIES OP THE     XIXTH    CENTURY.    13 Most logical readersyour reasoning is ingenious and to human foresight is alike plausible and conclusive, but it' is of the "earth, earthy." Woman's wiles, woman's smiles and woman's blandishments will have their influence on the great revolution with which the future is pregnant, but these alone would never give it birth. Another power differing essentially from ordinary human instrumentality and unencumbered with the dross of ma- terialism, is exerting its potent but invisible agency in behalf of the down-trodden and enslaved petticoatocracy of the Empire State., This agency more supernatural in its origin-more miracu- lous in its developments than any thing the world has witnessed since the magic transactions in the castle .of Udolpho or the en- counters of pious Cotton Mather with the witches of Salem, is yet in mere embryo, but in forthcoming maturity is destined to revolu- :?  tionize the world, forming a new meridian in the calendar of time, -" e and casting a halo of glory around the close of the nineteenth century, compared with which, the boasted human inventions of the age, will be but as farthing rush-lights beside the crater of Vesuvius, or the pattering of rain drops, to the roar of Niagara. We allude to Spiritualism, the talisman under which woman, casting her banner to the breeze will bear it onward from vic- -  tory to victory, till it floats proudly in the noontide blaze of ;   political power and then --. But we must not anticipate. Produce your authority says the incredulous reader, for these ".  wonderful revelations or how are we to judge of their veracity. Were we writing of the past, your demand would be reasonable and if refused an answer, the credibility of the narrative might well be doubted.  But the work before us, from its very na- 2 s ,. k o *   '     <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6456-00000009"/> "    .    LUCY   BOSTON.            ^ ture, must necessarily rest on the ipse dixit of the writer, with  the simple assurance that time will eventually stamp it with the seal of truthfulness. It will naturally be asked in what manner we came in possession of the wonderful facts about to be disclosed, or how we alone are made the favored organ in giving them to the world. We have already intimated that our pen may be but the passive tool of Spiritualism-that among the idiosyncrasies of this prophetic age, it may have been given us to peer through or behind the curtain that hides the future, and with unclouded vision to gaze out upon the stream of time, as it flows down the vista of centuries. Be  that as it may, the modus operandi, or precisely how we were constituted a chronicler of the future it is not essential to state or for the reader to know, neither has it any bearing on the authenticity of the following record. An obscure writer, one William Shakspeare who flourished somewhere near the close of the sixteenth century, but who seems to have drank somewhat deeply at the fountain of human thought and action has said, "There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken in the flood leads on to fortune." A later author of some repute has said, "There is a tide in the affairs of woman, Which taken in'the flood leads - Heaven knows where." The doubt implied in the latter quotation it is the design of the following chapters to elucidate: Will the reader now seat himself in the car of imagination and transport himself some twenty years ahead of the present time to the commencement of the last quarter-of the nineteenth century.   ' l CHAPTER II. "That night a cheild might understand The Deil had business on his hands." IT seemed almost the night of doom. The winds howled around, and through every crevice came portentous whis- perings. Lightnings blazed. The thunder in quick, cracking, crashing strokes made heaven and earth tremble, then rolled away "loud, deep, and lang." Amaziah Badger had retired to rest. But how could a sinful mortal sleep when the storm-god was wrothl and seemed about to shiver every thing to atoms. Earth, air and sky, mingled together, portended some dire catastrophe. Such a night was calculated to induce gloomy forebodings and people superstitious fancy with spectres and ghosts. Amaziah had been accustomed to regard such a scene in no other light than simply as an unpleasant one, nay, he had often rallied the timorous who could not enjoy a thunder storm. Though not given to superstition, a strange feeling came over him. Why, he could not tell. He was in good health and cheerful mood. However, unwilling to incur the reputa- tion of yielding to womanish fears, he resolutely sought to quiet himself upon his couch.    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6456-00000010"/> 3       ]LUCYy BOSTON. In the third story of a stately mansion, where, it is nrot im- portant to state. An introduction to his room will be sufficient for the reader to comprehend and realize the gloom of that awful night, a dismalness whose intensity our half terrified friend would have somewhat relieved by lighting his extin- guished taper, had not the continuous sheets of electricity rendered artificial light both useless and cheerless. 'But to the room. It was moderately large, ceiling high, with two windows look- ing to the street. The furniture of, ordinary style, bed, ward- robe, centre-table, wash-stand, half a dozen chairs, (including a comfortable armed rocker), stove, settee, mirror, a small case of miscellaneous books, et cetra. On the stand was neatly placed, bowl, pitcher and napkin for his morning ablution. Thus it will be seen, that for a bachelor (for such he was and enjoying his forty-sixth summer), Amaziah was comfortably provided with the articles of life, less man's " better half." For two long hours Badger vainly essayed to compose himself to:sleep. Sad and dismal sensations oppressed him. Never before had he so realized the' estate of his loneliness in the world. Longing for some one with whom to communicate, he was led for the moment to envy those of his kind who were blessed with conjugal partners of their joys and sorrows, espe- cially amid the terror and tortures of a nocturnal,(not matri- monial,)thunder storm. The moment that thought was indulged, he was startled by a noise in his room. But what could be the cause? Neither cat nor dog shared his bachelor's quarters. The door he knew was bolted, and the elevation of his apartment was security   FOLLIES   OF TIIE XIXTH    CENTURY    17 against external intruders. A flash of lightning discovered to  him a chair moved from its accustomed place. He could not be mistaken, for bachelors you know are renowned for the de- velopment of the systematic organ. Theirs is the universal, good old motto, "a place for every thing and every thing in its place." Another explosion of electricity, illuminating his chamber with more than the brightness of a hundred gas-bur- ners, confirmed him in the certainty that the chair had been moved, and that its removal had occasioned the noise. But by what power, visible or invisible? It could not be a Spiritual- Rapper. He was a rabid skeptic on that score. Was it not   . some robber or assassin issuing from his concealment to dispatch his victim? Amaziah had wronged no one, and his known antipathy to filthy lucre was indemnity against the assaults of avarice. Had not the chambermaid, either in a fit of somnam- bulism. or to play off some game of innocent conspiracy, with her duplicate key, gained entrance unobserved, amid the rattling confusion of thunder and tempest? This last, is the most probable conclusion thought he, at which thought, instantly the chairs commenced promenading across the room and with their legs upward, ranged themselves in a row against his bed-side. We say ranged themselves, for though the lightning gave a view as clear as noon-day, there was no visible agency in the mysterious movement. Badger sprang to a sitting posture. His hair stood erect. The cold sweat gathered in drops on his face. His knees smote together and his eyeballs seemed starting from their sockets. To escape was impracticable, for he was barricaded. He tried to scream " murder! help!" but his voice stuck fast in his throat.

At length regaining his voluntary powers and striking his hand with violence upon his forehead, he collected his wits about him, to determine whether indeed all this was reality or not. Conscious of his own identity and the soundness of his senses, it was clearly no empty vision. It is hard to say what the effect upon him would have been, whether a giving up of the ghost on the spot, or confirmed insanity, but fortunately, as often happens, despair begat cour- age and courage banished fear. EPi shattered thoughts and senses measurably restored, he resolved to know the bottom of this business. Accordingly his first effort was to leap out of bed 'and strike a light, but his muscular powers were suspended. Could it be, that he was a victim of the horrible catalepsy? The bare thought how ap- palling! Shroud, coffin, weeping friends, funeral train and yawning grave, all rose visibly before him. Darkness gathered on his eyelids. Already, he fancied himself lowered to his final resting-place, and heard and felt the clods falling heavily, with their sepulchral sound upon his breast. O horror of horrors! Buried alive! Was such his fate? This was indeed living death! Every fibre within him thrilled with agony. Already a sense of suffocation oppressed him, a numbness was creeping over his extremities, and when he would, have expired-mar- vellous in the extreme - the organ of vitality performed its function with more than ordinary vigor, for he distinctly felt and heard it palpitate. After all, thought he, is not this mere imagination and neuralgic excitement? Consciousness assured him of his mental and physical soundness, and yet the unac- countable spell petrified and held him fast.   FOLLIES   OF THE XIXTH    CENTURY,    19 Again his alarm returned. Skeptic as he had been in rela- tion to Spiritualism, the conviction forced itself upon him, that he was surrounded by invisible agents, for surely no mere earthly cause could produce such phenomena. He could no longer doubt. It was a Spir tual MJanfiestation. But .the character of these ghostly visitors? Was it good or bad, friendly or unfriendly? And their object? Was it a mission of benevolence, or had they come "to torment him before the time?" Spirits! ghosts! What feelings a sense of their presence and their power produces. How it seems to lift 'the curtain between both worlds, causi ing iful flesh instinctively to shrink back from an unseen, untried eternity. All he had ever thought, or said, or done, passed in instan- taneous review before him. Whether or not his state of mind bringing him into sympathy or magnetic affinity with the mysterious agency, dissolved the spell that bound him, it is difficult to say, but tortured with suspense, and with mental powers wrought up to the highest pi ch of intensity, suddenly his tongue was loosed and he cried,        e W hVat meaneth this?  What terrible judgment is upon n? Tell me ye invisible powers, tell me." But there came no response. Have I wronged any of my fellow men? If so,'tell me, that I may repent and make restitution. No answer. The tempest without still raged, while awful silence reigned within. Again in agony of soul he cried, "Ye powers, mortal or immortal, good or evil, reveal to me t- '    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6456-00000012"/> 20        Lucy  B us'o  N. this mystery. Wherefore is it and what doth it portend?' But the powers deigned no reply. "Whom  and in what have I offended?" continued he. "Surely, nothing save transgression could bring upon hapless mortal such a visitation. Inform me if I have trespassed on the rights of any human being." Instantly the chairs sprang to their legs again. The stove began to rattle and the table galloping around the room, sud- denly ascended and adhered to the ceiling. "I have then offended. Is it man?" said Badger. No response. "Is it woman?"And his tongue tingled as he spoke. In a twinkling his wardrobe rushed from its retreat, hats, boots, waistcoats, pantaloons, and dickeys flying furiously in all di- rections. Himself, the picture of fright, he found, in a preca- rious equilibrium, astride the foot-board, while bedstead, chairs, settee, tongs, stools, and every thing about him, that had legs, fell to rearing and kicking as if possessed. All was hurly-burly, except the wash-stand, which stood unmoved, like a quiet spectator of the scene a circumstance the shrewd reader, will presently comprehend. A sudden plunge of his wooden horse, the ridei hurled through divers vertical revolutions, was safely anchored in a sitting posture on the stove, and into which position he settled with infinite composure. To ah ordinary observer Amaziah's apartment, in a state of chaotic disorder, was far from inviting, and his seat any thing but enviable. But Spiritualism looksthrough other than mor- tai eyes, and hence to him, all was order symmetry and beauty. /k   FOLLIES OF THEi-    XIXTII CENTURY.      21 Ordinarily, the transition from a bed, even of straw, to a cast iron stool, would be considered something of a hard ex- change, especially when tired nature called for rest. But now to him it was delicious as softest velvet. No easy chair, with "cushions at the arm-holes" could be more grateful. He fain would have sat there the live-long night. True, he might have desired a change on the score of taste, but not to increase the sum of his perfect, yet unaccountable felicity. The'storm had abated. The thunder died away in distant muttering, the lightnings returned to their hiding-place. In the elysium of his bliss, perched upon the silken, downy, sum- mit of the stove, the impression fastened itself upon him with irresistible force that he had witnessed a Spiritual Manifesta- tion, and that in truth, he was involuntarily and unconsciously made a Meiedium.  With self-possession equal to his former trepidation, he at once inquired, "Are there Spirits here?" Whereupon broke out such a rapping as would have awak- ened the "seven sleepers.'( The thumpings of a thousand -  coopers at work had not made a greater 'clattering. Chairs, ;-: settee, bedstead, tongs, poker, boot-jack--which had exhausted their energies, by over-exertion, and subsided into quiet for a breathing spell--again letting loose, played curious antics. The mirror turned its face to the wall, and the table alighting from the ceiling, danced a polka about the room. Amaziah's coat, of peaceful cut and the property of a peace man, was decorated with epaulettes, lace and sash,--his hat with cockade and feather, while his expansive, old fashioned cloak assumed the character of our national banner, with stars and stripes" flaunting to the breeze.    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6456-00000013"/> 22         LuCY  BOSTON. Amid the din of rappings and tappings, Badger's ear dis- tinctly recognized the tune of a Yankee Doodle'" and as the martial strain ceased, he as plainly heard the noise of a very large auger boring upward through the table, and saw, or rather thought he saw, the chips fall upon the floor! * * * Presently the stove commenced a gentle rocking. The wash-bowl, filled to the brim, attached to nothing, hung bottom upward directly over Amaziah's head, and yet- strangh phenomena-the liquid contents in perfect equilibrium, remained undischarged. A, soothing, blissful charm rested upon and filled his every sense. "The spirit of what man is here?" inquired he. A sepul- chral, angry tone between a groan and a growl, almost stopped his breath with terror, and again his strength Departing, he came near falling headlong. A striking anomaly, by the way, in Spiritualism, as we shall see, for according to the orthodox creed, when the Spirit called after, is not present, there can be no response-plainly an error, as Badger can testify from actual experience. Amaziah, confounded, bewildered and hardly knowing what he said, asked, Is the Spirit of any animal here?" Suddenly was there such a cackling of hens, crowing of cocks, gabbling of geese, croaking of crows, hooting of owls and screaming of buzzards; such a snarling of cats, barking of dogs, squealing of pigs, grunting of hogs, howling of wolves, chattering of monkeys, bellowing of bull-frogs and braying of donkeys, as out-bedlamed bedlam, and made night hideous with their grand chorus of discord. Puzzled, horrified, stunned, our bachelor involuntarily waved   FOLLIES OF    THE  XIXTH    CENTURY.    23 h hand for them, to depart. 'Twas like a magic wand. All was silence again. His composure returned. A moment's calm reflection assured him that it could be none other than some propitious Spirit present, but how to ap- proach it, was the question.  At length yielding to the motionf of an inward impulse, he' cried with the voice of entreaty, "Kind and gentle Spirit, whose presence fills me with de- light, favor thy' servant with a Manifestation, and reveal thyself to hilm." One mild solitary rap on the stove, vibrated in his ear, thrill- ing every nerve with ecstacy, like the silvery flow of richest music  The water still suspended above him, now gently glided down his person.   O, such a baptism! It was like being perfumed with the oil of celestial roses! He felt as if bathing in the ocean and basking in the sunbeams of bliss! Presently, a voice or. the Manifestation of a voice, in ac- cents of enchanting sweetness, said or seemed to say, "List thou! On woman concentrate thy thoughts, On wronged, disfranehised woman; and as me In this, thou dost obey, so will I thee . Glad tidings bear on morrow's twilight eve.

To-morrow night, as now, we meet again-- Till then, thy lips and secret heart, I scan. I am no phantom-heed me well-good night." As the voice died away on his ear, Badger found himself snug in bed again, his room at the same time assuming its cus-    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6456-00000014"/> 24         Lucy Bos TON. tomary appearance. The impression left upon his mind, by the occurrences of the last hour, was like that of a vivid dream, Within and without all was quiet save the measured tick of the clock. The queen of heaven smiled on him through the casement, and the stars twinkled with their brightest lustre, like diamonds in the blue mantle of night. Nature herself, as if with ex- hausted energies, seemed lulled to repose, and feeling the genial influence stealing over him, Amaziah sank into the embrace of profound sleep. ^  *       4 a      CHAPTER III. "Holy St. Francis what, a change is here!" LIKE old Bachelors in general, Amaziah was an inveterate stickler for his full quantum of systematic, unmolested sleep, not only on account of the luxury of " snoozing," but reli- giously holding it to be indispensable in fitting one for the active duties of the day.  His dormitory was his sanctum sanctorum. It was downright sacrilege for any mortal to intrude upon him while paying his nightly devotions at the shrine of the sleepy god. Whenever by any fortuity he did happen to be curtailed of his usual amount of rest, which very rarely occurred, it was said to make him oldt of sorts" for a fortnight afterwards. However this may be, it was not so in the present instance. On  the contrary he arose even earlier than usual, refreshed, invigorated, with step elastic, and spirits buoyant. Having arranged his toilet with even more than his customary circum- spection, midway his descent to the breakfast-room, he met the chambermaid, -a   native of "good ould Ireland,"--and an extreme specimen of her class. Were it required of us to describe her person in the most comprehensive terms, we should say, she was in height about four feet two," and her rotundity equal to her altitude. The    <pb n="26 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6456-00000015"/> 26        LUCY  BOSTON. contour of the picture is sufficiently indicative of the i' filling up." Such, we say, was her portrait drawn in fidelity of outline, and as it had heretofore appeared to Amaziah. But not so noW. In form, feature, and expression she was changed into a being of angelic mould. Motionless, for the instant, he gazed with rapture, beholding grace in every motion and " heaven in her eye." Never before, had he seemingly looked upon any earthly object so lovely. "Good morning, Catharine," said Badger, and with arms extended in the ecstacy of his admiration, he was saluting her with extravagant compliments extorted by her beauty, in his eye, when a voice from below in emphatic and to him sweet accents, saluted his ears: "What, sir, insulting my chambermaid? No gentleman will take such liberties with a servant. Explain yourself if you please, sir." a I was swaping in th-the hall, ma'm, and the blarney of a fellow was cooming down stairs, ma'm, and looked right at me with his eyes, he--he did ma'm, and was pokin fun at me, he was, and I niver sed a bit of a woord to him, and he kipt cooming raght at me, he did ma'm, and I was jist a gooing to give the oogly crather a poke on the pate with ma broom-stake, I was ma'm," exclaimed Kate in a spirit of "high dudgeon." "By this time the landlady- her black eyes flashing indig- nation-had ascended to the landing, where Badger stood listening to the impassioned narrative of Catharine, whose trich Irish brogue," had so fired with tender passion his inmost soul.  <pb n="-27" xml:id="VAC6456-00000016"/>  9I       FOLLIES OP THE    XIXTH   CENTURY.     27 "You will find you another boarding place, sir. I will hand you your bill at dinner," said Mrs. Wilson, and started down stairs.--Badger immediately following. "An if ye iver spake to me agin with yer blarney, by me sowl, a divil a bit of hair is it I'll lave in yer head, I will," cried Kate in a boisterous and threatening tone, and yet all this excited within Badger naught but the most pleasing emotions. Never before had he enjoyed female society. Not that he was a woman hater. Far from it. But like many of his class, having seen but little of the world, especially in the mingling of the sexes, which added to his natural.'ctimidity" he had always shrank from the gaze of the softer sex, as from the glare of a serpent. But how changed! A new era in his existence now dawned upon him. His eyes and ears were opened for the first time, to see and hear those feminine charms, to which be- fore he had always been both blind and deaf. This change wrought upon him was indeed sudden and mysterious, but to him none the less real. Badger was seating himself at the breakfast-table when the waiter made her appearance. How surpassingly beautiful she looked! True, her " skin a sable color," was of purely Ethe- opian dye, but to his optics there was no difference between ebony and alabaster in female charms, unless it be that the former exhibited a somewhat'richer tinge than the latter. Good morning, Dinah, dear," said Badger, unable to re- press the ardor of his feelings-"what a stormy night we've had. Could you sleep amid such lightning and thunder? How old are you, Dinah? Is your father living? How many sisters have you, Dinah? Did you ever have a husband, Dinah? If    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6456-00000017"/> 28         LUCY, BOSTON. I were you, Dinah, I would never mar"--. At that instant Mrs. Wilson entering the door arrested his attention. Some would have said she was in a rage, yet not so did he behold her. There was fire in her eye, but it was the flame that burns while-it does not consume; a curl on her lip,.but it was the " line of beauty;" a kind of spiteful, steam-like rapidity in her locomotion, but it was the perfection of grace. At least so it appeared to hinm. - Has he eat his breakfast, Dinah," said she sweeping round towards the head of the table where Badger sat. No misses, he talk so fas, me couldn't ask de gemmen what he hab, no how." "How fresh you are looking this morning," said Amaziah to his hostess, at the same time advancing towards her with hands outstretched for a friendly greeting, his labial muscles, of their own accord, assuming the attitude for whistling, or' something else. "Husband! husband!" cried she with hysteric shriek, though it was music in Badger's ear. "Lor bress me, massa!"-- vociferated Dinah, meeting Wil- son at the entrance, and throwing up her hands in affright, , he gwine to obmit wiolence and sassinate- missus.

Friend Badger only wanted to hear himself talk and have a little fun, that's all. He would'nt harm a kitten. An old bachi--hard on to fifty and never kissed a girl in his life, I'll wager a cocktail. Bah! He's as harmless as a turtle dove. Glad if he has at last got pluck enough to speak to a woman. I think he ought to be encouraged, for his own sake and the wo- men's too. He'll make some one a model of a husband yet. Won't you my good fellow?" at. the same time giving him a familiar, playful slap on the shoulder. "I hope he won't court Kate and Dinah all at once," said Mrs. Wilson, and she swept out of the room. "Lor a mighty, he don't come round dis wench, nohow, now I tell you dat ar," said Dinah, and away she shuffled in a huff. "Come Badger," said the landlord, " swalllow your breakfast and take a turn with me to market, and we'll have one of the dinners to-day," in the mean time loading his plate. "There, make yourself at home, while I go to the kitchen and see what's wanted. I always consult Dinah in making up the culinary programme." "Hold on, I'll go too," said Badger, rising from his chair. "No no, it's all well enough," replied Wilson, "my spouse was a little nervous this morning, don't mind it, and its not worth while to apologise to a 'darkee.' You see Badger, you have never studied the science of woman. You hav'nt been initiated. But you'll understand it when you've been blowued as often as I have. You see these fits are a part of the female constitution- a kind of chronic, periodical neuralgic spasm, and when they come on, the only way is to keep still and let 'em have 'em out.

These fits are curious things - and dangerous too, if not rightly treated. The only cure is, kindly to let them alone. Its al- ways safest to let 'em pass off the natural way. I can fetch my wife too, easy enough. A new bonnet or a new dress will take the temper out of any woman, for a while--at least until they are made and worn once. You see, Badg., I'm a real doctor. I can treat these feminine infirmities 'like a book,' bread-pills and sugar-plums are the best caloihel and blood-let- ting for these 'fits' that woman 'is heir to,' as Shakspeare says, ha-ha-ha. Do you understand? Now Badg., hark!- take my advice, keep away from the women. Never even turn your thoughts on the sex, until you have firmly resolved to marry. "Lecture first, by Prof. Wilson, 'D. F.,' doctor of fits, admittance twenty-five cents -bachelors half price," said our host with a hearty laugh, and made his exit leaving Badger behind him. Although entirely misapprehended, he decided to adopt the counsel just given him and let things rest as they were, trust- ing less in himself than in his landlord, whom he held in the highest estimation, as well for the qualities of his head as his heart. To be sure Wilson was not favored with a liberal education, neither was he covered with the starch and polish offashionable politeness. He did not know at what precise moment of the day or night, the bosom of fashionable nobility would, as a matter of course, magnanimously'open its portals for the recep. tion of visitors, neither that he must say "adieu') to his   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH      CENTURY.   31 "DEAR friend," after having sat precisely so many minutes by the dial, notwithstanding it broke suddenly off, an interesting conversation -nor that his gloves must be of a particular hue, on particular days of the year, and at particular hours of the morning and evening, and that they must not be worn a second time, though not in the least soiled. Neither could he really feel himself inspired with a deep and abiding attachment by the inspection of a little piece of polished paste-board, handed to his servant by some gentleman's coachman, however hand- somely the name might be engraved upon it. In short, he was not much versed in, much less governed by the Calendar of Fashion, in which is marked the "times and the seasons," with nice exactness of year, month, day, hour, minute, and even second,as a directory to guide the simple and govern the wise in the process of walking, riding, bowing, speaking, call- ing, smiling, and loving, with all the details of form, size, color, texture, posture, and wear of apparel and equipage. Wilson was in all respects exactly the reverse of this fashion- able stamp, open, frank, generous--a noble specimen of demo- cratic humanity. However fastidious Fashion might draw his portrait, he was nevertheless in heart and soul a gentleman. Satisfied that Wilson was his friend, and intended all for the best, and whose advice being not altogether inconsistent with the instructions of the previous night, Badger concluded to repose confidence in him. "What a magnificent morning! Such cool, pure, bracing air. What a luxury to breathe it," said the landlord, as they sallied forth on their excursion. "Y-e-s," replied Badger with indifference.    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6456-00000019"/> 32        LUCY  BOSTON. "I shall never forget last night," continueI Wilson. What lightning!

"Where does she live," ejaculated Badger, instantly electri- fied. How far is it? When shall we get there?!" he repeated with the utmost impatience. "I've hit you at last, my good fellow," said Wilson laugh- ingly. "Her domicile stands a short jaunt from the suburbs. Shall I escort you out there to-night? Badger made no reply,:, Come what do you say? Shall I show you up? If you would get a wife, you must approach in the right way and play your game shrewdly. Blow a welding heat and strike when the iron is hot-that is, watch your chance and take her when she's in the humor. Shall we go?" "Not to-day," said Badger, I'm engaged.

Just before them, a milliner and mantuamaker's sign (in the shape of a woman, familiar to the reader), of faultless proportions and clad in richest costume, was advancing by the aid of a clerk, to her position near the door, for the purpose of enticing the simple and unwary ones out of the way, leading them to enter one of those "institutions," where so many women graduate, and come forth clothed with beauty, to dazzle and captivate mankind with their acquired charms. The moment Badger's eye caught the voluptuous form of the feminine sign-was it monomania, or imagination, or because he was a "woman's rights "Medium, or what? -his soul was instantaneously inflamed with the " tender passion," and his senses taken captive by a delirium of bliss. "There she is, there she is," cried the ardent lover, springing forward to meet her, and, thrusting aside the lad who seemed to be laying violent hands upon her, the figure, jostled from its balance, fell headlong to the side-walk. "Dearest madam," exclaimed he, bending over the prostrate image, how glad I am to see you. Are you hurt? Let me help you up." But she made no reply, and taking it that silence gave con- sent, quickly clasping her about the waist--heavens, what a sensation!--with no great effort he restored her to her feet again), not only gratified with his exploit of gallantry, but as- tonished that she was so light.

May I be so happy as to see you home?-- You know me don't you?"Earnestly and affectionately he repeated his questions, but could obtain no answer. While thus paying his unfortunate addresses to the dear thing, suddenly rushed out the mistress of the establishment, and snatching the sweet idol from his embrace, exclaimed, "You scoundrel! What are you doing?   You'll pay for this, sir," and drew her rescued prize within doors. "O certainly, certainly, send for the doctor--make haste- quick, I'll foot the bill," said Amaziah following hard after the object of his adoration. Thinking she had but swooned, he seized a bucket of water, accidentally standing near, and in the heat and hurry of his excitement, dashed the contents into her face! "That'll fetch her too, if she's only fainted," cried he. "But ain't she hurt, that she can't speak? Let me feel of her pulse and look into her eyes," continued the lover searching for her wrist and peering under her bonnet.

I will teach you to lay your hands on the property of a defenseless woman, in a manner you'll remember. I give you timely notice of that, sir." O wait, don't be too fast," said he, "and if she doesn't come too pretty soon, instead of walking to the magistrates, I'll just send for the Parson. I'd rather, a great deal, have a Priest than a Justice,--hadn't you, my dear Miss Milliner?" "What do you mean, sir, by such language?" "I mean, if this dear idol here, should'nt revive in the course of an hour, then I will take your dear self to be my lawful, wedded wife." "You impudent rascal! I won't be so insulted. 'It's enough to have my goods destroyed. Sir, pay me for that dress, and shawl, and bonnet," demanded she, pointing to the sign which stood encircled and supported by the arms of the addled amoroso.

And dropping his head upon her shoulder, he burst into tears, while with loud wailing and lamentation he pressed the lifeless form to his  <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6456-00000021"/> 36         Lucy  BOSTON. bosom. "She ain't dead neither, for only see! how she sweats! O miracle! miracle! he ejaculated, exulting and laughing aloud through his tears. "Sweats! miracle! you fool 1" exclaimed Wilson, who silently waiting, had abundantly enjoyed the Icene, "What the devil are you about here? Hugging a woman of straw and cotton, and can't tell perspiration on a human face from cold water on a block!" "W-h-at?" said Badger with a broad stare. "Well, that's news anyhow, that women are made of such stuff as straw and cotton, and wear their bonnets on a block!" "O that's not the case with 'em all," said Wilson. "Just come with me, and I will show you one who will make you 'sweat,' old fellow, and that without a miracle,' too." Then turning to the milliner who had retreated towards the back part of the room, evidently concluding that Badger was a luna- tic escaped from the asylum, he said to her, I'll see this all made right, Mrs. Jones," and taking Badger by the arm, drew him to the door, amid a crowd of men and boys, attracted thither by the scene, and who probably would have " hustled him out," had it not been for the protection of his friend Wilson, who was a sort of acknowledged prince among the people. As it was, they passed without being the least molested. The only noticeable demonstration, was a sly chuckling and elbowing, with the interchange of certain sig- nificant looks at Badger's expense, although there was discov- erable something also which seemed to say, "that's a rich joke on old maid Jones."

The introduction of this topic aroused our absent-minded bachelor again, and promenading arm in arm up and down divers streets, they at length reached the market, whither Fame, swift-footed as usual, having preceded them, and a group being assembled with Athenian curiosity, a lengthy discussion ensued relative to the love scene and various other questions. The day had so far advanced that a man's shadow did not' indicate his height. Badger's breakfast having been almost a "fast" and the excitement of his adventure naturally produ- cing exhaustion, he began to have a realizing sense that his landlord's promised dinner would be exceedingly palatable. Like a couple of lads, sent of an errand, and at last aware of 4<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6456-00000022"/> 38     \   LUCY  BOSTON. their tardiness in playing by the way, they made all speed homeward. Ascending to his room, Amaziah found upon his table seve- ral letters from esteemed friends. The seals were scarcely broken when dinner was announced. Sensible of a more " aching void" in his natural than social stomach, the call was promptly obeyed, and having demonstra- ted his full appreciation of the good things of Providence, and Dinah's kitchenary skill, he returned to devour and digest the contents of his epistles. A feeling akin to ennui, gradually oppressing him, he kept his room with closed doors, his thoughts, meanwhile, alternat- ing between the scenes of the morning and his engagement with the mysterious visitor for the approaching evening. Elongating himself upon the settee, in a sort of drowsy con- sciousness, betwixt reflection and anticipation, disappointment and hope, the hours rolled lazily away. As night approached, anxiety aroused him, and he was wide awake. Curiosity and expectation were on tip-toe. Scarcely could he keep from forcing the clock forward, impelling the wheels of time to accelerate their speed. At length gray twi- light came and with it he retired. q   Al CHAPTER IV. Thou remember'st Since once I sat upon a promontory, And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back, Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath, That the rude sea grew civil at her song: And certain stars shot madly from their spheres, To hear the sea-maid's music."   HE I' King of Day," in regal splendor, as if wearied in his journey, had sunk to rest in his couch of gold; while the Queen of Night, in the absence of her lord-assuming the right so generally claimed by ladies of fashion when their dear(?) husbands are away or snugly in bed, good, kiw souls -issued from her eastern chamber of the palace, arrayed in robes of light, with cheek of blushing beauty-that crowning charm of woman's charms--and with queenly grace glided over the azure pavement in her evening promenade, and, a la belle, attended by a host, of satellites, some conspicuous by their brilliancy, others obscure if not lost in their insignificance. The laborer had ceased his toil and sought repose. Terres- trial Nature, as if fatigued, seemed gently dropping into sleep to restore her exhausted energies. The hours advanced and all was still. Badger, awake and wakeful, stretched upon his lonely bed, (39)  <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6456-00000023"/> 40         Lucy BOSTON. awaited the arrival of his mystic and heretofore aerial visitant. Lying in a state of nervous impatience, not unlike a super- stitious child peeping from under the coverlet, with every mus- cle set, to steal a glimpse of the marvellous Santa Claus, his anxiety increased to a pitch of intensity absolutely painful. At length he found relief. Punctual to appointment before his as- tonished gaze she stood, whom human language cannot describe, neither pencil draw, nor imagination the most vivid portray. Badger had often met with ladies decked and bedizzened with all that money could obtain of the ornaments of a won- derfully ornamental age, but there was sure to be some draw- back, some "fly in the ointment," that displeased him; a wrinkled or wry face, an unnatural color and expression, some native or artificial deformity, a thing---whether or not they could remedy-always repulsive to his plain, unartificial feelings. But not so she, whom he now beheld, she- "So lovely fair, That what seem'd fair in all the world, seemed now Mean, or in her summ'd up." The reader naturally feels a curiosity to know something of her exact appearance. That is impossible without actual per- sonal observation. But were we to attempt her description, we could only say, in most general terms, that she was neither too large nor too small, and of perfect form and feature. In her contour were no sharp points, nothing in the least degree an- gular or stiff, but every line throughout was the graceful curve and voluptuous swell of beauty. Her eyes were rolling dia-   FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CitNTURY.   41 monds, luminous with sparkling, yet mellow light of superior J intelligence, penetrating the inmost soul of the beholder with awe and admiration. Her complexion, like living alabaster kissed by the breath of morn, was suffused-not painted - as with the blush of roses. Her teeth were comely rows of whitest pearl. Her hair, the color of her eyes, rich and glossy as the raven's wing, and fall- ing in graceful, flowing curls about her person, swept the ground. In forming his first impression, as was his habit when meeting a stranger lady, he cast an involuntary glance at jher feet, but they were modestly concealed by the drapery of her costume, the exterior of which consisted of a simple, but ample robe of ethereal texture and lightness - untrimmed with gimp, ruffles or flounces. Her ungloved fingers were not loaded with rings, nor her ears elongated with pendants, nor her bosom set with mosaic. In short, she was destitute ofjewels, and though on this account in shocking bad taste, according to the modern code, yet in point of personal beauty she surpassed, if possible, the fabled Venus herself. Motionless and dumb under the power of her enchantment, our bachelor was revolving in his mind whether what he saw was reality, an apparition, or a dream - when extending her arm, and pointing at him with her finger, in a clear, command. ing tone of silvery smoothness and thrilling power, she ad- dressed him thus: "Give ear, O man! believe and heed me well: As woman hater, prince and chief, art thou Selected from thy race, to heir from me Of what is past, and things of coming time 4*    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6456-00000024"/> 42          Lucy BOSTON.

To all of this have I not witness been? And more, ad infinitum more, whereof, Were it the present aim of my intent I could relate.

"Those hearts that start at once into a blaze, And open all their rage, like summer storms At once discharged, grow cool again and calm." AMAZIAH awoke with the peep of day, and with the sun, started forth fresh as the morning. Strange to say his slumbers had been profound. These nocturnal visitations from church-yards and dream-land are sufficient to banish sleep, making one feel feverish and dull, if they do not furnish a liberal instalment of sore eyes and headache. But not so in this instance. Never did our bachelor friend rise more invigo- rated or in better spirits. Opening the window, he drank the bracing air, surveyed the landscape and thought upon the pro- phecy, till the bell summoned him to breakfast, which he an- swered with a nimble step and a good appetite. On entering the dining-room his landlady, who from some cause had become appeased, saluted him with, "Good morning, sir. You will take this seat," pointing to a chair in her own vicinity. Somehow this struck him as a peremptory command, and which ordinarily must have grated harshly on his feelings, but under the pressure of a secret constraint, he cheerfully obeyed. Friend Badger, shall I serve you with a bit of our choice (50)   V X FOLLIES   OF THE  XIXTH   CENTURY.    51 beef-steak?" said Wilson, entering the room and approaching the table. "I've ordered it," said Mrs. Wilson. "You may as well breakfast now." At that instant the bell of the milkman was heard in the street. "Step to the 1oor and tell him to send in six quarts, it is baking-day," was the landlady's: mandate to her husband. Upon an ordinary observer this colloquy would have produced no very particular impression, but to Badger, who listened with fixed attention, the words had special significancy and mani- festly pointed towards the fulfillment of the prophecy. It was plain to his observation, that his landlady was already to all ,  intents and purposes, "mistress of the mansion." She gave orders; others obeyed. Now many would set Mrs. Wilson down for a vixen. A great mistake, as we can demonstrate. Among others, according to the doctrine of Spiritualism, there are Impressible and Involuntary Mediums. That is to say, as Satan used the Serpent, in like manner the spirits impress in- dividuals into their service, infusing thoughts into the mind and touching the secret springs of volition, so that this kind of Mediums are unwittingly the machines by and through which a;. spiritual agents operate in the accomplishment of their purposes in this terraqueous sphere. Such was Mrs. Wilson, who among a multitude of others, was made a kind of forerunner of universal female do- minion. "The milkman says he can't spare you so much without    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6456-00000029"/> 52        LUCY  BOSTON. disappointing some of his customers," reported Wilson, re- entering the room. "Tell him if I can't have what milk I want, I'll order it from somewhere else," replied his medium spouse. You knew it was baking-day, and why didn't you direct him to fetch an extra quantity this morning. The blockhead might have known himself 't was my baking-day." No one adminstering fuel, the fire would naturally have died out, but a Mrs. Caudle Spirit giving her a nudge at the elbow to "go ahead," her tongue ran on. "A man never will learn nothing anyway only to make poor woman slave herself to death for him. I wish you had to do the baking and then see how you'd get along without milk. There's never nothing done if I don't see to it myself. I'd like to see a man take charge of a boarding-house, a spell. Every- body would starve to death." Not a word escaped Badger's ears. To him each syllable was full of meaning, and he carefully registered them in his memory. "I wish you had to do the baking." Hearing this, he was on the point of imparting to her the pleasing intelligence that she was destined soon to have her wish gratified, but the incessant rattle of her " unruly member" (or ruling member, to use the strictness of the " womans rights" nomenclature) deterring him, he held silence, with the design, however, of venturing the suggestion at the close of her harangue, and would have carried out his intention, had he not been taken aback by the expression that she "should like to see a man take charge of a boarding-house."   FOLLIES OF TIHE XIXTH     CENTURY.   53 "And who has the management of the house, if your hus- band don't," asked Badger very innocently. "I suppose I am the man of the house," said Wilson. "The responsibility seems to be on my shoulders, but then I trust my wife to keep a little lookout.' "Not by a long chalk,".said she, "I'd have you understand that lam the manager of this establishment, sir. Things go here as Isay. It belongs to me to order what I wish, and if I can't have it, I'll--- " "Why didn't you order the milk then," said Badger, inter- rupting her in his good-natured simplicity. That's not my business, sir. It belongs to the men to see that things are got. How do you suppose we can get along and keep boarders, unless the men provide? Do you think poor woman can do everything? all her own work and the men's too? I always have ever since I was married, but its settled, I shall not do, it any longer. Now I guess you under- stand it," said Mrs W., with that peculiar expression and em- phasis which none but a determined woman can give. "You may be compelled to before long perhaps," said Badger. "I know you men would be glad to have us do your business, and wait on you besides; but for one, I've got too much spirit to uphold your laziness. I only wish I had a haltei'round every man's neck in the, world." What would you do in such a case," said Badger. "You wouldn't be so hard-hearted as to choke them, would you?" "I'd make'em stand about and know their place. I'd learn them better than to let us get out of milk on a baking-day." 5* W A *[      '      <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6456-00000030"/> 54        Lucy BOSTON. "Why not just order your husband into the kitchen?" said Badger, somewhat boldly, "and make him do the baking, and you provide the milk?" "Yes, that's it, wife, exactly. I'll swap clothes with you. Give me charge of the domestics a spell. I should make one of the landladies, wouldn't I?" said Wilson; at the same time, in his playful manner, chuckling her under the chin. "' That's a fair offer, I'm- sure," said Badger. "O yes, you men are always very fair to offer when you know nobody will take you up. I should look pretty doing out-door drudgery. We women have always been made slaves of, and always will be, I suppose. You'd be glad to have us hoe corn, milk the cows, curry the horses, black your boots, and do all your filthy work for you, no doubt ; but you'll never see that day, I can tell you." "Well, wife, this won't make milk. Take your choice in the offer I've made you. If I am to be installed in the kitchen I wish to be off, and have things done up in double-quick time. And if you are going to succeed me, you--" "Yes, I know it," interrupted she; "you men are always in a great hurry, but never do nothing." "I'm sure Mr. Wilsou has made you a very fair offer," said Amaziah. "Yes, I s'pose you think if you could get rid of me you'd have fine times. It is a contrived plan between you and my husband; I see through it. I've seen a good many things lately. Now I'm satisfied," and she went off muttering, "Nice cnntrivance this-things have come to a pretty pass--he doing kitchen work with Kate and Dinah!"   FOLLIES  OF THE   XIXTH   CENTUY.    55 Fortunately for the good fame of our landlady's tempera' ment the other boarders, being unusually tardy, had not yet come in. "My wife seem a little out of sorts this morning," said Wilson. "But you mustn't mind what she says--only a little storm-- will soon blow over. These women are queer things sometimes." "' There's no difference in 'em I suppose," said Badger. O, about as much as between two peas. After all, we must usually let them have their own way. Sometimes, when their mettle is clear up and they get too fractious, we find it necessary to curb 'em a little, just as you do unruly colts. In extreme cases we are obliged to put on the real saffle-bit, which, you know, in good hands, either holds them tight or breaks their jaw." "Don't you think she was a little too fast, just now?" asked Amaziah. O, the devil, no That's nothing. It isn't a circumstance. If you don't meet that in your daily experience when you get a wife, you'll be a lucky chap," said Wilson, laughing. "I'll go to the kitchen and have all smooth in five minutes." He followed to the basement, where he found Mrs. Wilson and Dinah. "You've come, have you?" said his wife. "I suppose you calculate on taking charge here, don'tyo? You'll findyour- self mightily mistaken. Don't you think, Dinah, he wants to. come and take my place here, in overseeing the kitchen work." "Dat would be fun. Yaa-ya-ya-let him come,   issus.

"There, what did I tell you?" said Mrs. W., her black orbs flashing green, I knew this had been all talked over before. Ah, sir, you can't cheat me. Pretty place this, for you and that good-for-nothing old bachelor. Nice contrivance!-so barefaced. It makes my blood fairly boil to think of it. Where's Badger? I'll give him a piece of my mind he'll re-  member," and she started for the stairs. "That's right. Go and give him fits," said Wilson. "I won't stir a step, nother. That's just another contriv- ance of yours. Not one single step will I stir. I'll stay here till doomsday, first." At that instant the hall-bell rung. "I wonder who's come now?" asked Mrs. Wilson. Some- body that wants to board, I presume, and not a drop of milk in the house. Never was poor woman so tormented in this worldas I am. I'm sick of living. I can't take him. Tell him I don't want any more boarders," and down she sat, with an "  O dear! I wish. I'd never got married." A few minutes sufficed for the steam to escape, and our landlady was measurably cooled, when Dinah, in the simplicity and kindness of her heart, remarked, "Guess Missus not berry well dis mo'nin. Guess as how she betta retar to bed an she feel berry much bettar. I do de work, Missus." This brought our landlady instantly to her feet, in a fit of perfect madness, exclaiming,   ,.,'                    . ;AV    FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CENTURY.    57 "Another smart contrivance. That never came from your thick skull, you black wench you. It's some of my smart hus- band's cunning." "I wonder who it was that come in above, just now. I should like to know," said Wilson. Go and see yourself, then," said his wife, with emphasis. "This is your third contrivance. Just like you, to get some one to call on purpose. You can't cheat me. I can see through you and all the niggers in America." Guess 'll resign my station here," said Wilson, as he left the kitchen, his better half(? ) resuming her seat. Entering the sitting-room he found one of the common itinerant pedlars, displaying to great advantage a "large assort- ment" of jewelry, dress and fancy goods. Badger sat listening to the pedestrian merchant as he lavished a profusion of praises upon his different " wares." Wilson, from curiosity or some other motive, priced the various articles composing his "choice and elegant stock." Meanwhile a thought suddenly flashed across the mind of Mrs. Wilson, and she sprang to her feet, exclaiming, "That's just like him -he's fooled me after all," and away she bounded up-stairs. Rushing into the sitting-room in hot haste, behold! husband, Amaziah and pedlar with goods spread out in grand display. She entered the room with threatening aspect, but a sudden change came over her. Stepping forward she made a general survey of the various dresses -then select- ing a pattern, and holding it off at arm's length, remarked in a half-soliloquizing tone, "That would make up beautifully, wouldn't it?" and in a    <pb n="58 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6456-00000032"/> 58        LUCY BOSTON.       / loving way added, with a smile, " don't you think so, hus- band?"

I've been want- ing a new dress some time," and without waiting for a reply, said to the pedlar, "I guess I'll take it," and it was carefully laid aside. "Have you got any nice chimesettes?" inquired she. UIpon which he made a fine display, archly repeating the salesman's formula. 'Cheap-nice-right from France--kot no more like." Taking one from the fancy apartment, and holding it up before Wilson, she said, with that ime winning smile, "That is just like one Mrs. Dafort from Washington had on at the party.

"I knew that was just the one you wanted me to have, when I selected it," said she, and thus another bargain was closed, and the chimesette was carefully placed with. the dress. "What splendid jewelry you have. All new style," said Mrs. Wilson, as she took up a bracelet which particularly attracted her admiration, and adjusting it upon her wrist she placed it before Wilson's eyes, coquettishly exclaiming, "Isn't that beautiful, husband? there aint one in the place like it.

"I don't feel hardly able to buy it, but as my husband in- sists upon it, I suppose we must--what do you ask for it ?" said she.

"0 yes," he replied, casting a sly wink at Badger, "they are first-rate girls. Guess you better please 'em a little." And so to top out the trade she purchased and presented to Kate and Dinah, each a cheap ring. Wilson, like any whole-souled husband who takes pleasure in gratifying his wife, "cashed the bill," without a word of complaint, and the pedlar, chuckling over his success, took his departure, in quest of other customers.

' Yes, my wife's a woman of unquestionable taste,/ said Wilson, and away she flew to the kitchen, light as a bird, and cheerful as a May-day morning. " There -all right now, you see, don't you ?" said the land-   lord.   "Yes, but how long will it last ?" enquired Amaziah. - "Can't tell anything about it. The devil may be to pay in a week, or the fit may not come on again in a month -can't tell anything about it." "Well, you're sure it will come again in the course of a month, are you ?"  "Never knew her a month without a 'tantrum, in my life- but can't tell any thing at all about it. You might as well-ask when the weathercock will point North or South, or a thunder- storm come up, as to ask when a woman is going to have a "fit" -it's just as it happens, and that's all any one can say about it." " Don't they ever come out of their fits until you buy them something handsome ?". "0 yes, sometimes. Just let 'em alone and they'll scold themselves out of 'em after a while.

"Oh i is there not A time, a righteous time, reserved in fate, When these oppressors of womankind shall feel The miseries they give?" DINNER was served with usual care and passed off agree- ably. To the uninitiated, judging from Mrs. Wilson's appearance, it would have seemed that but one flame could be kindled in the female bosom, and that not of passion, but the milder, and more genial flame of affection. Badger being under no special engagement for the afternoon, had ample time for reflection. Two things were evolved in his thoughts and placed to his acquisition of positive ideas. First, he held it a settled truth that what had been foretold him, in regard to female destiny, would surely come to pass, for it was a revelation from the Spirit World. Secondly, he knew precisely what woman was, having actually seen one of the species, and whose husband-a real philoso- pher, who spoke from intimate, personal knowledge -had told him that they were in general alike. Judging from past observation, he was first at a loss to com- prehend how the women were to conduct the affairs of the nation and at the same time discharge the duties which there- (63) ;-t I    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6456-00000036"/> "    -    Lucy BOSTON. tofore, in the order of nature, devolved upon them. Heo had seen her--whom he took as the type of the sex-refuse and declare most positively and emphatically that she never would perform them, which seemed forever to fix the fact of their non-performance, unless the men should assume, or be made to assume, the duties of the domestic department. But a second consideration made it all plain to his understanding. The wo- men, concluded he, strike for independence, and stiff-neckedly forswear all home responsibilities only as the "fit" takes them, and when they come into power they will, doubtless, in their wisdom arrange, by legal statute or otherwise, the precise time for having "fits," and with such nice adjustment in respect to age, condition and temperament, that no two in a family or at least those dependant upon each other, shall fall into " tantrums" at the same time. But we will not pursue simple thoughts, since events, not speculations, are what the impartial historian should record. Having a little business in New York, though not immediately pressing to be sure, yet not knowing precisely what liberties, if any at all, men would be permitted-to enjoy under the new administration so soon to take the place of the old, Badger concluded to go at once. With overcoat on his arm, and carpet-bag in hand, he enter- ed the sitting-room in passing, simply to say good-bye to his landlady, whom he found so intently reading a newspaper as not-to observe his entrance. "You seem very much engaged with the news, Mrs. Wilson," said he; ("what do you find so deeply interesting?"

This subject is attracting much attention, and has amongst its advocates some able minds. A meetingis to be held at the Tabernacle, on the 12th inst., when interesting addresses may be expected. It is a question worthy of consideration. We hope there may be a full attendance. The call will be found in another column.               ! "Sure enough, what does that mean? We will look at the call and see," said Badger. It read as follows; ' The undersigned having seen' and felt the pitiless oppression and tyranny of the men, respectfully solicit that all in favor of woman's rights, meet at the Tabernacle, on the 12th inst., at twelve o'clock, to talke into consideration the subject, and devise the best means for their relief.

"How sorry I am for 'em. Fifty of my sex under the oppression and tyranny of men: therie! Only think of it! And it don't say they have done anytfiing neither.

".Is your ' city paper' come, Mrs. Wilson?" said she. "Ourn is on-accountably detained for some cause another, I don't know what, I'm sure, and to-morrow is publication day, and husband has wrote his editorial and got the paper all ready for press, except the 'foreign news' column, which he always fills up from the ( city paper,' and as he was very unexpectedly sum- moned away on important professional business, he solicited me to assume his responsibilities and use the scissors, and in- sert any thing important to be communicated to our numerous readers, and I've run over to borrow your paper, if it's come." "Yes, we've got it," said Mrs. Wilson, and there is fifty women under the oppression and tyranny of men in New York. I was just reading it as you came in. Did you ever hear of any thing so awful in all your life? There it is, you can read it for yourself," added she, handing the paper to the editress.

If you will lend me the paper, Mrs. Wilson, I'll have ours out bright and early in the morning, and scatter the news broad-cast, all over." "' Yes, you can take it, but be sure and fetch it back as soon as you're through with it, for I want to keep it," said the lender, and our editress, with a rapid, nervous, business-like movement, hastened to the ' office," to enter upon her profes- sional labors.

"Do, for mercy's sake, keep out of the way and don't get hurt," said our landlady, with a tone of anxiety for his safety. Promising her that he would be careful, they exchanged " good- bye," and parted. Next morning the village paper was out in advance, and heralding in glaring capitals, the folloving: STARTLING INTELL IGENCE!!! FIFTY WOMEN IN NEW YORK, UNDER THE OPPRESSION AND TYRANNY OF MEN!! TREMENDOUS      EXCITEMENT!!! Large meeting called at the Tabernacle!!! We go to press in advance of our usual hour to give our ex- tensive readers the very latest news as early as possible, which must fall like a mighty thunder-clap upon the public ear, and shake the nerves of the " body politic" into the most frightful convulsions!!

Rumor was afloat; the impulse extended; the surrounding region caught the mania. Before sunset; under the auspices of female leader- ship, the subscription list of the "Bulletin" was almost doubled. It was pronounced by far the most interesting {' publication" in the country. The editor was at once marked as a growing man, and destined to run a distinguished career. And so it is, at least too often - the wife plucks the laurels- the husband wears them. But wait. Time will decide whose brow was made for the crown, whose hand for the scepter. But to return to the journey. In keeping with the usual predilection of old bachelors, Badger located himself on a va- cant seat in the railroad car. Presently a gentleman in appear- ance, of fine and easy address, in search of a seat, enquired if the balance of the 6ne he occupied was engaged: 'Tis' not, replied Badger, and they were seated together.

I do not recollect to have heard any thing about. it." "There is a notice of it in the 'city- paper;' I saw it last night," said Badger. "What was the notice, sir?" "I can't give the particulars, but it told how they were op- ,pressed by a gang of men, and there is to be a meeting atathe Tabernacle, on the 12th, to see it something can't be done for them." 'O! you misapprehend the thing entirely, sir. That is a call for a 'Woman's Right's Convention.' I am one of the persons, whose signatures appear there." "You?"  I thought they were all femnales who signed it. "And you thought right," said she, partly rising from the seat. (' You will observe, sir, that I am in bloomer costume -rather the extreme of the style too, I admit, but that is a mere matter of. taste you know. I am now on my way to that convention." A shriek of the ",whistle," and slackening of the train, indi- cated their arrival at a stopping place, when a jovial looking fellow, directly in front of their seat, turned around and with his clutched hand extended towards her, exclaimed, "Odd or even for the Scots, sir! We always take something at this station.'? "Excuse me, if you please, sir, we never do such things/" was the reply.

Badger and his new acquaintance remained in their seats. 'There was the customary " getting off" and 4' coming on," when there came along, among others, a well-dressed young man, and in a jolly, familiar way, accosted our bloomer friend with- "' How are you, Bill? You hav'nt altered much since I saw you last. Get a good game up at the races? "You are mistaken in the person, sir. ,Our sex do not frequent race-courses nor follow gambling," and quietly takin&amp;g off her hat, exhibited her feminine tresses ingeniously slyort- enred, at which the young man recoiled, and with evident con- fusion, saying, X It is a mistake; beg your pardon, madatn." and passed along. Our bloomer delegate became the "'ob- served of all observers," and the subject of various remarks, some grave and others sportive; in short, such as the reader can very well imagine." A All aboard,' shouted the conductor, and the iron horse sprang forward, as if refreshed by his breathing spell, and whirled them away at fearful speed. "How impudent these men are," said Miss Boston (for such was the name of our bloomer). "However, the time is not far distant when such indignities as I have received in these few miles' travel cannot be perpetrated with impunity. When we come into power, we shall have civility enough to permit the men to pass unmolested by impertinence and in- sult. That day, thank Heaven, is near. Smile not, por call me visionary. I am as confident in that belief as if it had been revealed from the spirit world." "Confident of what, ma'am?" said Badger.   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH        CENTURY.    71 "That ere thy remaining sands are run, man shall be cast down to his proper level, and woman,elevated to her, native position of superiority." "Have you seen her, too?" interrupted Badger. "*Seen who, sir?" PI don't know who she was, but she was the handsomest creature I ever saw. Down to her waist she was just like a woman, and that's all I know, only as she was going out and lifting up her skirts, as the ladies do when they walk you know, in the place of her feet, I thought I saw a fish's tail. "I had supposed, sir, I was in the company of a gentleman. But allow me to inform you---and heed well my words-soon shall you behold the glorious spectacle of a world under the sway of woman, not only public opinion shaped and society re- modeled at her hand, but the church reformed under. the magic of her eloquence, and the state ruled by her power and guided by her wisdom-auspicious period when my sex shall be in the full enjoyment of their inalienable rights." "Precisely her language to me on that awful night," ex- claimed Badger. Miss B--- looked at him in speechless astonishment. "It's a fact, ma'am, just as I tell you," persisted he. a Your wit, sir, does not rival your ill breeding, to couple me by comparison with a mermaid, that monster of an animal pat best, and whose existence even is' altogether problematical.

And more, sir, I could tell that will shortly transpire, and which would make your ears tingle, but 'tis a waste of breath. You would tenaciously cling to your unbelief, even if it were reveal- ed to you from the world of spirits -yes, you would not be- lieve even though such an animal as a mermaid, or if her spirit itself should appear to you in the watches of the night. But why waste useless words and make myself the object of ridicule? I will seek some more retired seat where, if possible, I shall be free from these assaults of impertinence," saying which, she rose to depart. "Stop, stop," entreated Badger. "Everything you've spoke, I believe from the bottom of my heart. The spirit of a mer- maid did tell me, and in your very words too." "I understand you perfectly, sir," was her reply, made with an air and emphasis not to be misunderstood, as she abruptly retired to another seat. Miss Boston was not only incredulous as to this matter of revelation, but treated it with the utmost derision. Amaziah could a "tale unfold," but she disdained to listen. He regarded her, however, with charitable feelings, conclud- ing that she must be falling into, a "fit." Time and space flew by. The Hudson, with its glorious scenery, of cottage and villa, of park and lawn, highlands and palisades, receded like a swiftly-gliding diorama. The metropol-i rose to view as if by magic.

"We're the watch, and at your service too," answered the officers exultingly.

"More is meant than meets the eye." THE   long-anticipated day arrived which was to be the initiative of our country's true glory and greatness. Al- though not ushered in with tumultuous demonstrations, yet it marked an era in our national existence. In short, it was the day for the " woman's rights" convention. The hour for the assembling of congregated wisdom, philanthropy, and injured innocence, was at that precise moment when the sun was highest, and shone the hottest. Among the notable arrivals on the ever-memorable occasion, none created a greater sensation than our bloomer delegate, whom we left in the hands of the police, with the unpleasant prospect of her remaining in cldrance vile. In vain did she protest her innocence; in vain did she offer resistance and implore the interposition of the passing spectators; proclaiming her name and residence, and ,that she had come by special invitation to attend the great "woman's rights" convention. No one came to her rescue. The official guardians of law and order, in the abundance of their zeal for the public safety, were inexorable, not abating towards their prisoner a degree of inso- lence and rough-handling. With grim satisfaction the turn- 7                (74)   FOLLIES    OF  THE    XIXTH   CENTURY.     75 key threw back the bars and bolts.   Harshly grated the mas- sive door on its iron hinges, to close upon the unoffending victim, when she speedily drew from her pocket (wondering at her thoughtlessness) sundry   letters and  credentials, which proving satisfactory to the incorruptible officials, our unlucky heroine was with reluctance discharged. Counting herself fortunate, in her narrow escape from the "due process of law," yet chagrined at the indignity put upon her, she hastily exchanged the tombs for the old Astor. The doors of the old Tabernacle gaped wide, as if eager to swallow the waiting  throng.  Vortex-like, the vast amphi- theater absorbed the inrushing thousands, while the wedging multitudes, like a flood dammed up, choked the avenues, and the " cry was, still they come." Promiscuously packed, almost sto suffocation, the convention began to take on an organized form in the appointment of Mrs. Jane Truelove, president, by acclamation./ She took the chair, amid great applause.  Scarcely-waiting for the outhurst to sub- side, the distinguished chairwoman arose and said: -- i Most potential and injured fellow-women!- called very unex- pectedly to preside over the deliberations and doings of this most august assemblage, I arise to present my humble acknowledg- ment for the very distinguished honor --   " "I call the president to order,"* interrupted Miss Cloe All-  * N.

Lest it be thought that some of the actors are represented as incredibly stupid, it is sufficient simply to remark that the rushing tide of revolution swept along with it the female populace, whose ignorance of public business was equaled only by their ambition for notoriety. Of this the men took most cruel advantage, professing to give them proper instruction, when in truth their only object was to make them appear ridiculous. -7    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6456-00000042"/> 76         LUCY  BOSTON. tongue, popping up about midway of the room. "The presi- dent is out of order; I call for the nays and ayes on the ques- tion," continued she, in a sharp, nervous tone. "I object to the ayes and nays,' said Miss Snappish, "and contend, according to strict parliamentary rules, that the presi- dent is not out of order." "I didn't come all the way here," retorted Miss All-tongue,- "No, Mrs. President, I didn't come clear here, to hear ladies on this floor talk about parlour-mentary rules; I come as the indi- cator and representation of 'woman's rights,' to agitate this great constitutional question, and hunt for means and measures by whose contrivance the proud and haughty, and-and-- good-for-nothing tyrant man, shall-hem!-by which, proud and haughty man shall  shall---" here the speaker with muscles strained and veins swollen, laboring under the burden of her mighty theme, became speechless, her emotions being too intense and her thoughts too big for utterance.

Perceiving that I am misapprehended in my previous remarks, I rise merely to make myself understood. What I meant to convey is this- that the next thing in order is the appointment of Vice-presi- dents and Secretaries, before any motion can properly be entertained." Finally, the Doctor, as it were, involuntarily and by the tacit consent of the house, assumed the charge of the business, and soon the convention assumed form and shape. The president concluded her speech, and announced that the convention was realy for business.

In the simplicity of ignorance and his sanguine expectations, he looked for the adoption of great and decisive measures, at once, and fancied the women would be enthroned in power before night. Profound silence ensued. Itthecame painful. Every thing was at a dead stand-still, while from the female side all eyes were turned towards Dr. M-, as if waiting for another de- monstration from him. At length, to relieve the awkward and embarrassing suspense, he arose and said: 'I suppose the lady's motion, that the sexes be separated, would now be in order, if she choose to make it."

Though the result of the vote was not announced by the Chair, there could be no doubt how it stood, and instantly all was tumult, each person, whether male or female, pushing with all speed for the other side of the house. The resolution was evidently incomplete, in not designating which side should be occupied by which. "Ladies will please take this side," cried a female voice from the right. "Ladies, take this side," cried another from the left. "Gentlemen, this way," echoed from both sides--and instantly there was a universal cry of "this side," "this side)" " this side, I say," indicating pretty nearly an equality of lungs, if not of numbers, in the opposite quarters, and constituting a grand pow-wzow of confusion and fun. At length, after a short interview between the Reverend Doctor and the president, she arose, and to the top of her voice    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6456-00000044"/> 8Q0        LUCY BOSTON. cried "order- order--ORDER," which, however, only served to increase the "uproar." Redoubling her exertions she stamped, flourished her fist, pounded the table, and screamed " order - order -order-ORDER," till quite exhausted, but it was like speaking to the tempest. The moderator was not only immod- erately excited, but her "dander" was evidently up, for her eyes glanced rapidly from corner to corner, with threatening aspect, just as if she was looking for a broomstick, that last resort of the feminine amazons when their naturally pacific e natures are rolsed and goaded to the pitch of pugnacity. Things looked portentous. The male spectators expected every moment to see the "fur fly." Our bachelor, calling to mind his landlady's injunction, to " keep out of the way and not get hurt," began to cast about for a place of retreat, assured that they had all, together, fallen into the "fits," and thinking what a grand spot it was for a pedlar of pills to make his for- tune. Observing a favorable opportunity, Amaziah sought to en- sconce himself, and ducking behind the desk, awaited the subsid- ing of the storm. Such a scene It out-bedlamed bedlam. Dr. M -- could endure it no longer. Striking his cane upon the table, he shouted " order," with a stentorian voice, and every thing was quiet. All dropped at once into their seats again, as promiscuous as ever. "I can see no occasion for this intemperate excitement," said the Doctor. "The meeting will be ridiculed enough, if con- ducted with decorum, and I feelbound to say in all kindness, that if better order is not preserved, it will merit ridicule. Now I suggest the propriety," continued he, " of some lady making the motion, designating which side of the house the   ; FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH      CENTURY.    81 gentlemen shall occupy, and let the matter be disposed of in the usual manner. After the motion is made, then debate upon it will be in order; after which, all will vote under- standingly. It is evidently a question, in regard to which there is a great diversity of opinion, and-very much feel- tng, though what imaginable importance attaches to the subject, I confess myself unable to discover. This disagree- ment: exists exclusively among yourselves. I venture to say, judging from their appearance, that the gentlemen have no other feeling than indifference in this matter, and will cheer- fully take either side, if the ladies will only harmonize with each other. Now let some one move that the men pass to the left, for instance; then, after a few expressions of opinion, we may hope that all will acquiesce in the vote, when finally an- nounced." Chloe All-tongue. I move, Mrs. President, that the men take the left side, there's just where they belong; they've had the right hand side long enough, it's our turn now, and we'll have it too." (Great applause.) Mrs. Golden--a large, athletic woman, with commanding voice-arose and said, "Mrs. President, as we are manifestly on the eve of becoming mistresses of the universe, I deem this one of the;gravest questions that can possibly arise before this body. It is a question pregnant with a magnitude of interest, and which will be a fruitful source of weal or wo to our children and our children's children, down to the remotest ages of pos- terity.

Miss Todman, quite the opposite of the last speaker in size and voice, addressed the convention as follows: "I fully concur, Mrs. President, in the remarks of the lady last up. (Cheers.) I hope they will be unanimously adopted." (Repeated cheers.) Miss Wiggins.  Mrs. President, I feel myself in some re- spects, though with great reluctnce, compelled to differ some- what from the delegates who hive so eloquently addressed the convention. (Applause.) The subject is truly one of incon- ceivable magnitude (hear, hear); but I hive heard no arguments yet, satisfactory to my mind. I contend that this is by no means the proper place for the discussion and adoption of this subject. I hold that it belongs to the legitimate sphere of legislative enactments." (Manifest sensation in different parts of the house.) Mrs. Tyson. "Mrs. President, I rise with great delicacy, being unwilling to express an opinion on this very important subject without more consideration. It is, Mrs. President, a question most seriously affecting us all. I challenge any body that dares to deny it. (Applause.) It pervades through the social, political, iaid moral circle.

(Tremendous cheers.) Chloe All-tongue. "Mrs. President, I shall vote for every single word that has fallen from the last lady. (Cheers.)

"Mrs. President, allow me to say that Miss All-tongue labors under a total misapprehension of things. The only question now before you is, to obtain an expression of the house, as to which side the ladies and gentlemen shall respectively occupy in this convention, a matter, it seems to me, of not the slightest moment whatever. I hope I shall give no offense when I remark, that were this a male conven- tion, we would never think of raising this question of sepa- rating the sexes, but would grant the ladies, who might honor us with their presence, their own choice of sitting where they pleased, and if you will allow me the freedom of speech, with th due deference, I must say it would appear much more magnanimous on the part of the ladies, if they would adopt    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6456-00000046"/> 84        LUCY  BOSTON. the principle of reciprocity and give us the same privilege of choosing our own seats, so long as we do not get in the way, or become meddlesome. However, you have been pleased to re- solve that the house shall be sexually divided. Now, why not let the gentlemen make their own choice? -For my own part, I have no very particular preference on which hand I am put; still, if the ladies are tenacious on this point, to demand the vote, and it prevails, rest assured (and I know I speak the feelings of every gentleman present) we will most cheerfully comply, for according to the old saying, "the left side nearest the heart," which, in all the world-nor do I blush to say it -is the locality most coveted and sought after by man-kind. So if we are expelled from the colder region of the right, we shall only be instated in a warmer birth, a thing by no means disagreeable to us, exposed as we are to the chilling blasts and pelting sleet of our northern latitude." The Doctor resumed his seat with becoming gravity; yet, one might have discovered a lurking irony in the corner of his eye, and there was manifestly a subtle sting in the tail of his speech. The motion was triumphantly carried, and the gentlemen moved to the left. Our bloomer friend remaining upon the right, there were cries of "put him out," at first, but an explanation of who she was, brought down the house. The afternoon was by this time nearly spent, and after one or two short speeches the convention adjourned till seven o'clock, P. M. At this juncture, as fate or the spirits would haverit, Ama- ziah was discovered in his hiding place. The alarm was in- s tantly given, when the more pugnacious, led on by the re- Y    FOLLIES   OF THE XIXTH    CENTURY.    85 doubtable Chloe, pounced upon the luckless "dodger," and with no very gentle demonstration drew him forth. "Spy," exclaimed one. "Rowdy, assassin, rascal," cried others.

"Parturinnt montes, nascetur ridictilus mus." qqHE day was nearly spent, and judging from what had been  accomplished, the prospect of an immediate triumph of      t the "woman's rights" scheme could not be regarded. as par- ticularly flattering. A desperate assault had indeed been made, : by a desperate foe, upon the " tyrant man," but without any    j perceptible impression upon his defenses. His throne stood apparently as firm as ever upon its deep foundations. Seven o'clock arrived. The house was packed. Crowds thronged the doorways, unable to gain an entrance. Those who were not advertised of the vote separating the sexes, 'both male and female, made occasional mistakes. Whenever a gen- : tileman happened to get on the wrong side, no sooner -was his attention called to it, than he invariably apologized for the ap. a parent indignity, averring his ignorance of theI resolution, as he made the best of his way to the " left." The same, on the other hand, was Generally true of the ladies, as they edged along to the "right." Now and then was heard, in a spiteful, feminine tone, "I won't -I shall set where I please for all anybody." Half an hour had elapsed and not an officer appeared in her place. President, Vice-President and Secretaries were scattered in various directions on tlcir own side of the house. (86)   IVOLLIES 0O    THE XIXTH   CENTURY.     87 At length Mrs. Chloe All-tongue, who was always " there," in emergencies, arose and said- I have a list of resolutions that I want adopted, and I'll have them adopted too, if I have to adopt them myself. My man told me to press 'em through, at all hazards, and get into the commissioners of resolutions besides, which I mean to do before I leave the city." ! Mrs. Winkle. "I've got a batch of resolutions too, that I want adopted. I was also advised by my husband to look out for a place on the resolution committee, which I calculate to do. The meeting will give attention while I read them: 'The committee through their chalr-woman, Mrs. Winkle-- "' Mrs. All-tongue} interrupting-"Now, Mrs. Winkle, I'd like 'to know if that's parliamentary? tisn't fair any how, and I'll go so far as to say, it ain't neither lady-like nor honorable-I'll leave it to the meeting if I didn't fairly git the start, so you needn't go to sticken in your ' batch' till I git mine done." Dr.  ----. "I hope I shall be pardoned for interrupting the lady, while I take the liberty to suggest that the officers re. sume their places, and a committee be properly appointed to re- port resolutions for the consideration of the convention. I do not wish to be understood as didating, but merely make the suggestion." Mrs. Truelove. "I do not  omprehend the drift of the gentleman's remarks. I take it, am in the way of official duties -at all events my husband told ne so--that is to say, as I un- derstood him-and I've got it vrote down, so as to be very exact. "' First, That I should be ele ted.    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6456-00000048"/> Lucy BOSTON. " Second, That I should be conducted to the chair, "' Third, That I should deliver my introductory address, ro turning thanks for the unexpected honor, &amp;c.; and "' Fourthly, That my office expired when the convention ad- journed.' He writ down every word I've said; I learned it all by heart, and he didn't say a single syllable about any thing else. I am positive he would if there had been, for he is very particular to be exact in what he does. He's been to more than fifty conventions and seen as good society as other folks, and I guess he knows what's a proper and fit a'dress, as any body if he is a tailor, and I am resolved to follow the in- atructioq of my constituent to a letter." Mrs. (lood-good (first Vice-President), springing to her feet, in much agitation said, "For my part, I don't like to be 1apped up inthis way, in public, by any body, I don't care h w high his station.  I have exactly followed the footsteps of my illustrious predecessor, as I am proud to call Mrs. Truelove -just what my husband told me was right, and charged me to do, and I guess my husband has got as solid an understanding as some other folks, if he is a shoemaker. I'm not a going to be heeled and toed and hammered around in this style, by no- body -I confess that I begin to wax warm -but I am for sticking to the last, and letting our oppressors know, that they can't crush us under their iron hoofs any longer." Mrs. Blood-good had scarcely ended, as a rustling of silk at- tracted all eyes towards an individual edging along with a twitching motion from the back end of a pew. "I supposed this was a convention of ladies; I did not come    FOLLIES OF THE        XIXTH      CENTURY.       89 here to associate with tailors and shoemakers' wives," sputtered a pert little Miss, as, turning up her little aristocratic nose, she flirted out of the house, spitefully slamming the door behind her. Mrs. Wiggins. (My husband told me I must be president, and gave me a speech which I have got by heart. He said I must give it tothe secretary, so I took pains to copy it all in my own hand-writing (holding up the manuscript); here it is, all ready for the secretary." Mrs. All-tongue. "My man told me I must decline being president, very strenuously, and learned me just what to say, and how to say it, and said I must write it down and give it to the porter for publication, which I did at the Irving House, after supper." Reverend Dr. M--, again rising, said, "I do not by any means wish to intrude upon the rights of others, and hope our friends will pardon me for again taking the liberty of say- ing a word. The evening is fast passing away and I think all will agree with me, that but little if any thing has been accom- plished. Ladies are assembled here, not only from the city, but various sections of the country, some of them from a great distance. You have all come with patriotic and worthy mo- tives, to attain a great and most laudable object. Vast good may result from this convention, if properly conducted. A fa- vorable impression must be made upon the community, and above all an unfavorable one must be avoided, in order to insure success. It is evident there are various resolutions in the hands of numbers present, each of whom has come expecting the distinguished honor of being at the head of the committee. But all of course cannot have it, and as the different indi- 8*     <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6456-00000049"/> 90        LUtCY BosTON. viduals are alike, seeking to arrive at the same grand result, a little conciliation will remove the difficulty, at least so far as to furnish all the competitors an opportunity of laying their sentiments before the meeting, for consideration and adoption. "By way of compromise, I would therefore recommend that the officers resume their places on the platform, and some lady move that a committee of nineteen be appointed by the chair to report resolutions expressive of the sense of the convention." Following this suggestion the officers took their appropriate seats. The president beckoned the Doctor to her, and after various whisperings exclaimed- "I call the meeting to order! We are now ready for busi- ness." Silence again ensued, indicating to the reverend Doctor, that if the inert, unwieldy body was to move at all, he himself' must be the motive power. This conviction brought him to his feet again, in a somewhat less moderate and dignified man- ner than was usual for him. His looks revealed his feelings-- his words proved them. Poor man I who could have a heart to blame him for the partial severity of his eye and tone, as he remarked- "It is now almost eight o'clock and next to nothing has been done, and small prospect that any thing will be done. I may appear to be officious and out of my place, but for the honor of your sex and the cause, I will assume the responsibil- ity-if you please to call it so-of making one more sugges. tion, which is, that you proceed at once to business, if you have any business to transact, and if not, that you adjourn without delay. A short time since, an indefinite number of   FOLLIES or THE XIXTII CENTURY. 91 ladies had the floor, all eager to present resolutions, and well instructed no doubt how to demean themselves; but now, when 1   it is well understood, by all who have any acquaintance with public meetings, that the person who moves the appointment of a committee is always made the chairman, or placed at the head of it, no one seems disposed to make the motion. This may be the result of modesty or a want of courage." Mrs. All-tongue interrupting. O0 I remember, that's just what my husband told me, to get up and move, exactly as he wrote it, and to be sure and have it fight, I'll read it: "'On motion of Mrs. Chloe All-tongue, a committee of -- was appointed to draft resolutions expressive of the sense of the convention.' "There, the fool, he's left out something. Its just like the blunderhead. He never does any thing right. A smart trick indeed-go and borrow the money to bear my expenses clear here, and leave that out-I'll-I'll-just wait till I get home, that's all. Send me here to make a dunce of myself. He did it on purpose, the villain, I know he did." The remainder of her remarks, which were continued at some length, were not distinctly audible; from what could be gathered, they seemed to threaten something of a caudleistic nature. Our reverend friend had by this time subsided into his usual frame of amiable composure, sorry that he had allowed his feel- ings to get the better of him, and resolved not to let the sun rise upon his indignation and disgust. With the meekness of Moses and the patience of Job, a very martyr to the cause, he calmly essayed one more suggestion.    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6456-00000050"/> 92        Lucy  BOSTON. "It seems to me," he remarked, "if I may be allowed to add a word, that in order to expedite business, what Mrs. All- tongue has just said, had better be regarded as a motion, though somewhat informal, and that if it be seconded and carried, as I hope and trust it will be, the chair may as well exercise its discretion by the ppointment of a suitable number." He sat, and silence reigned around. Anon, rising slowly, and with infinite amiability he resumed: "I feel a very deep interest in the cause of "woman's rights; therefore I came, and have remained here so long, to the annoy- ance of some it may be, but with a sincere desire to aid the ladies in their noble enterprise. I am now under the necessity of leaving, and hope to hear a good report of the doings of the convention during the remainder of its session. My sympa- thies are with you. I bid you good seed,'" and with the gait and air of real benevolence, the good Doctor took his hat and his departure. "Good riddance more like!" exclaimed rs. A-tongue, as the door closed behind him; "I'm glad his lordship is gone. He has kept us here all day and a good share of the night doing nothing. There will be something done now, and first and foremost I'm going to pass my resolutions. Three cheers for freedom from the ' oppression and tyranny of men.' (Im- mense cheering and swinging of bonnets and handkerchiefs.) Miss. Pendergrass. 'If I may be allowed to express my feelings, I think Mrs. All-tongue is making herself very con- spicuous here, and that she would appear full as well if she had a little less tongue, or at least if she didn't use it quite so much."

Your father better pay my man for the very shoes on your hocks now, and which I bound myself. I think it would look quite as well, Miss Sal. Pendergrass. There! I guess you'll let me alone after this and mind your own business. If you don't, I'll tell what I heard at the tea-party tother a'rter- noon. Your father haint got no-store? There isn't such ar- ticles as lace and muslins in it? Sam Jones aint his clerk? But we all promised not to say a word about it, and I shan't, if you'll only let me alone." The President. "I think the lady ought to tell. Its all among ourselves, and we'll agree to keep it perfectly still." Miss Pendergrass. Its all a lie. I wasn't in the store that night. Its a downright falsehood, made of whole cloth, just for revenge and nothing else. I never had any such thing. Mrs. All-tongue wasn't in the room when Mrs. Ogle told it, and there wasn't a single woman there that believed a syllable of it." Miss Boston. Mrs. President, I have not as yet troubled the convention with any remarks. It was my design, with the permission of the house, to take some humble part in its pro- ceedings. I have had the honor of being present on several similar occasions, but never before have I witnessed so large and enthusiastic an assemblage. Many hours have wasted away and it is late, yet not too late to accomplish much if the time be profitably employed. I would, therefore, move that a committee of three be appointed to prepare an address, to be submitted to the people. I hope that some lady will second    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6456-00000051"/> D4        'Lucy BOSTON. the motion of Mrs. All-tongue, and I doubt not it will receive a unanimous vote." "I will second the motion of Miss Boston,' said Mrs. Pea-  body. "I second the motion of Mrs. All-tongue," interrupted     i Mrs. Winkle; and I will read my resolutions and have them    ? passed on at once."  Miss Boston. "Mrs. President, it seems to me that the question had better be put, without further delay.' "I put the question," said the chair. "Aye," said th- convention.                  - Miss B--. "Will it not be best now for the chair to ap- point, say seven ladies, as the committee on resolutions, and let  them retire?" The Chair. "I nominate Miss Primrose and  "That is hardly courteous to Mrs. All-tongue," said Miss Boston. "According to all custom she should be put at the head of the committee."                      "c I was going to put her there," replied the chair-woman, pettishly, " and should, if you had let me alone. I will put you there and make you retire, if you interrupt me again." "I beg pardon of the president; if' I have offended," said Miss Boston, mildly; "I certainly intended no disrespect."  Miss Primrose said, "I have no particular objection, Mrs. President, of belonging to the committee, but I must positively - decline the honor of being the chairman, or chair-woman I should have said. First on account of my age and incompe-  tency, and secondly, because I think like the lady last up, that  honor belongs to Mrs. All-tongue, as the mover of the resolu- ,; . ^   FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CENTURY.    95 tion. In order that harmony may attend otr deliberations, I hope Mrs. All-tongue may be appointed leader of the com- mittee. The Chair. "Well, if it suits you any better, I name Mrs. All-tongue." "There, Mrs. All-tongue," said Miss Pendergrass, in an au- dible voice, "I guess you're satisfied now, and ready to retire; just what you ought to have done long ago, for the credit of the cause and your own too." The Chair. "I hope ladies will leave their bickerings till they get home. Let them settle their difficulties there, if they must have them. Silence the house while I finish the com- mittee." The house was silent and the committee completed in the appointment of Mrs. All-tongue, Mrs. Winkle,      Miss Primrose Mis Pendergrass,    Mrs. Peabody, Miss Kilduff,      Mrs. Blood-good. After suitable instruction from Miss Boston, as to their duties and the conventional meaning of the word "retire," which they did not seem readily to comprehend, the IMMORTAL SEVEN were conducted to the committee room. They sat with closed doors, and as no one was admitted to their conference, we cannot, at present report their proceedings, but should we chance to learn them, the public shall not fail to receive a recor, so muh to be prized, of the doings of that ret ssBoston.

These four words are the quadruple Power, the compound Lever, with which the world has been turned up-side down, or rather right-side up, and they are now converted into the majestic wheels which are rolling the mighty car of Events on to its destiny. These principles are the dominant forces, which, especially for the last half century, have issued in the rapid, accelerated, almost miraculous advancement of society in every department of physical, intellectual, and moral activity. And all this, selfish man arrogates to himself. 'He claims to be engineer, conductor, and superintendent of the train, and  that woman is nothing but the lumbersome baggage. "'Now we dispute this claim with him, and propose to dis- cuss its merits. In doing so, we shall maintain-  "' First, That this new impulse in human improvement had its real origin, not in man but in woman. ' Secondly, That woman and not man has contributed most to its advancement, and "Thirdly, That woman is equally, if not more capable than man of. continuing this progress to an indefinite limit of time and degree.'  "These three propositions we shall consider very briefly, for it needs little more than the bare statement of so manifest a truth, to carry conviction to every honest mind, and such  only may-we hope to reach. We invite attention therefore while we restate and establish our position: "'Proposition first. The modern impulse in science and improvement originated chiefly, not in man but in woman. "' We are fully aware that we are met at the outset by man,  'armed to the teeth,' and backed by legions of inventions and  9 1*    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6456-00000054"/> 98         LUCY  BOSTON. discoveries, of patent rights and copyrights, of literary and scientific diplomas, and professional insignia, with the steam- boats, railroads, telegraphs, and ship of state at their command -truly a most imposing array, and against which it may ap- pear the part of folly and madness for us to contend; but be it remembered, 'the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. We have a magazine set, which needs but to be touched, and this mighty host, with their munitions and in- trenchments are blown into chaos. This magazine is the power of truth, and the torch we hold to ignite it, the freedom of speech. When, we ask, did the mind of man emerge from its state of imbecility, and, putting on strength and activity, enter upon the march of improvement? Not till woman put forth her native energies to cast off the yoke and burst the chains of her oppression. Not till members of our sex, in spite of their serfdom, springing from obscurity like stars from the bosom of night, and ascending with growing luster, became new planets ensphered in the intellectual heavens, and in the presence of whose radiance the old members of the system grew pale. Hence, not from pure spontaneousness, but alone through fear of losing the scepter of his power and the crown of his glory, man leaped up and, girding himself, rushed forth to his achievements, taking good care to herald them abroad with the sound of his own trumpet. Just as the Sultan or the Czar, to prop their tottering thrones and suppress the uprising of republicanism, stud the empire with bristling bayonets and spread the royal banners from every tower as the manifesto of their povereignty.

Woman, and not man, has contribzuted most to the progress of the age:- "c' As woman was evidently the mainspring to human activity, she must of course be regarded as the normal force, not only of the first impulse, but also of its continuance; for withdraw the propelling force from the great machine of society, and every thing would at once subside into a dead stind-still: undeniably, woman is the motive power of the world. What, we would ask, makes the world great? Its great men, they will answer -grant it. But whence the great men?   What fashioned the Spartan heroes? Their Spartan mothers. What made General Washington great?  General Washington's mother What gave John Adams his towering position in the history of our country's independence? John Adams' wife. What led the son, John Quincy, to become the prince of wisdom in America, if not in the world? The influence of John Quincy Adams' mother. So of the vast majority, if not all, of the great, the wise, and the good among men. The inheritance of their renowned destiny was bequeathed to them, not by their sires, but by their mothers. Female influence is the key that unlocks the hidden i..  stores of knowledge and fills the world with illustrious charac- rt  ters, which constitutes the world's greatness. But besides making the great men, woman has made herself great, towering t   as high an'd weaving for herself a diadem as bright as any of :   the inspired lords of creation, and that too in defiance of the    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6456-00000055"/> 100        LUCY  BOSTON. numerous and apparently insuperable obstacles thrown across her path, by her envious oppressor. If we search the records of history, where find we brighter names, or examples more illustrious, than those of female genius? What general more renowned for military prowess, than Joan of Arc, or Cleopatra, that gigantic titaness on the tented field? The empire of Russia, overshadowing and threatening to absorb the east- ern continent, is but a legacy to Nicholas the Great, from the Empress Catharine. What periods in the history of the Anglo-Saxon race more rich in splendid achievements of thought and action, than the reigns of Elizabeth and Victoria? In fine, were we to select a champion from either sex, and after the manner of the ancients, send them into the arena to settle the question of superiority for their respective parties, the combatants are at hand. Napoleon Bonaparte is, nearly by common consent, pronounced the most stupendous prodigy of a man that the world has ever seen. Yet was Josephine more than his compeer. ,She, and not the Great Napoleon, was in chief the stability of the imperial throne. He was indeed the emperor, but she, in reality, governed the people. He led his armies to victory, and 'disposed of courts, and crowns, and camps, and churches, and cabinets, as if they were the titular dignitaries of the chess-board ' But every where, and at all times, Josephine was his presiding genius, and her presence the prestige of success. When abjured by his ambition, she withdrew from his support, how soon was the ' mighty fallen!' He struck from the firmament his guiding star, and the mighty mariner, wrecked amid darkness and tempest, miserably perished on his desolate sea-girt rock! *    as                        #   FOLLIES   OF THE   XIXTH   CENTURY. 101 "' Such is zcoman.

Hence, it needs scarcely more than its simple announcement, to carry conviction to every candid mind. It is a philosophical axiom, that 'like causes produce like effects.' If therefore, as we have seen, woman was the potential origin and equally the promoter of human activity in the various de- velopments of the past, it must follow with the certainty of consequent to its antecedent, that she is also competent to carry the world forward to the termination of its glorious and sublime destiny. And such we must believe to be her mission, unless indeed the constitution and order of nature be changed, which, however, can never happen, since the laws of mind and of matter are as fixed as the Being who made them.

Mrs. All-tongue inquired the occasion of such a "big noise," and learning the cause, she demanded a reconsideration of the vote, that she might add the power of her voice in the passage of a measure so loudly called for and so unspeakably important. However, reluctantly waiving her inalienable right of being heard, in obedience to the call for the report of the committee, Mrs. All-tongue submitted as follows: "Mrs. President, and ladies of the convention:- "We found that each of us had a lot of resolutions, and finally agreed to pass them all and take them home with us; but I shall report only what follers, which I've collected together as a kind of sum total of the whole.

"The enquiring spirit will not be controll'd, We would make certain all, and all behold." TUSINESS completed and curiosity indulged in the great city of Wonders, Badger turned his face homeward. Ab- sorbed in the morning chronicles of the preceding day's events, pregnant with the destiny of man and woman kind, he sat in the railroad car when Miss Boston entered, whom, as she was passing, he politely invited to occupy the seat beside him,     r promising her protection from indignity or rudeness. She readily accepted, remarking that she recognized him at the Tabernacle, and was much gratified in seeing him there, to which he replied by expressing equal satisfaction at being pre- sent. After various remarks relative to the city, its growth, its commerce, its wealth, its amusements, &amp;c., &amp;c., their con- versation naturally turned into the channel of "woman's rights." "What did you think of the convention, sir?^' asked Miss B.    "I thought it was a big one," replied he. "What did you think of it, Miss Boston?" "There were many very foolish and some very sensible peo- ple there. But that is the case, sir, with all popular assema- (104)   FOLLIES OF TIIE XfXTH        CENTURY. 105 blies. Nor is it at all surprising. Indeed it is, and in the nature of things it must be so, while the present custom holds, and men send their wives and daughters loaded with addresses and resolutions and instructions to make themselves conspicu- ous and gain notoriety. Not that these women are so much to be blamed. They are under the control and direction of their husbands and fathers and brothers. They have been kept in a great measure secluded, from society,--I mean the every day matter-of-fact society of the business as well as the social world. And more especially have they been denied a place in deliberative bodies, where alone any person can acquire a theoretical and practical knowledge of the routine of parlia- mentary proceedings. Pardon me, sir, if I appear to monopo- lize the conversation. That is proverbially one of woman's aunquestionable rights you know. Besides the subject is my apology, if one is needed. You see I atu entering a plea in behalf of my sex for their general want of familiarity with the ordinary method of transacting business of a public character. As I said, they have been forever ostracised from all participa- tion in the counsels of public bodies. And then you could not have failed to discover the absence of independence on the part of almost, if not quite, all of the ladies in the convention. Strictly speaking, they were not delegates, but representatives, for they simply eeflected their husbands and fathers. They dare not go contrary to the instructions of their liege lords if they had been so disposed. I have attended a large number of conventions in the last few months, but in character very different from this one. They were composed of dele. gates, free-thinking, independent, strong-minded delegates, not    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6456-00000058"/> 106        LUCY   BOSTON. representatives, or mere automatons, the passive, pliant tools of the men. I have observed much in connection with this subject, and meditated enough, much more than enough, to convince me of the propriety and justice of our cause, but never--I must say it-never have I seen or thought of any thing in relation to this question which has impressed me so seriously as this convention. Why only think of it, sir! hun- dreds of women there who never in their lives before had been suffered to attend a convention as spectators even, much less to participate in one! And what a humiliating spectacle was there presented! That of itself settles the question, and ren- ders our success sure and speedy." I am entirely satisfied," eagerly interrupted Badger; "I know and have ever since I saw" -   the remembrance of his adventure on their downward trip, at that instant arrested him, in the middle of his sentence. , Since you saw what, sir?" inquired Miss B . "You'd get right up and leave me, if I should answer you, so I'd have no chance to tell 'you about it." "No, sir, I promise to hear you through, provided you speak in respectful language." '( Since I saw the spirit of the mermaid, then," he added- A Spirit of the mermaid!" repeated she, with a hearty fem- inine laugh, and a look which left no doubt Us to her opinion of the spirit seer. "Well, if I'm to be laughed at in this way, I'll see if I can't find another seat," said he, with the tone and air of in- sulted feeling, and rising to depart. "Pardon my impoliteness, sir; I really intended no offense.-   FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH    CENTURY. 107 I promise you not to laugh again, though it must be confessed there is something comical about it. I have witnessed I spir- itual demonstrations' and am called a believer, and a very good ' medium'I besides, but never before did I hear of the spirit of a merenaid. I should as soon expect the spirits of animals."                      J "Well, I've heard them too, said he; "and the awfulest racket that ever was made." Again Miss B-- broke into a fit of laughter. "' You needn't make sport of me, for I did," persisted - Badger, with wounded pride. '"I was not laughing at you," answered she, "but only at my own thoughts. Sir, you understand what a mermaid is? if there ever was such a thing in existence, which, to say the least, is extremely doubtful." "I've heard something about them, ma'am, but I don't know any thing except what she told me." "Well, sir, allow me to say, the most authentic accounts we have of the animal, makes it a kind of fabulous creature, an inhabitant of the ocean, part woman and part fish, but of the two, I should think, rather the more fishy." That was her I saw then.  She said she used to live in the ocean and set on a rock, and see the ships go by and men in 'cr, and she told me just what you did the other day." a Pray, sir, when and where did you see her?" "T'other night, in my room. She came twice. The first time she didn't stay only a minute, but she said she would see me again the next evening; and she did, after all were asleep, and she stood a good while and talked to me, and told me all i':    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6456-00000059"/> 108        LUCY  BOSTON. about Woman's Rights and the men, and how they abused the women, and about the spirit land, where she said she come from, and how the women ruled the men there, and how spirits come to get away to come' to earth. She said the female spirits broke loose, because the men tormented the women so, down here; and a great many other things. I wish you could only have seen and heard her as I did," said our bachelor, with great rapidity and emphasis, his eyes, with a marvelous glare, standing quite out of his head. "You seem very earnest, sir," said she. "A strange story you are relating. You saw her twice did you?" "Yes, I did, as true as I live." "And she talked?" "Yes, both times, but a good deal the most the second time." "Did any one else see her?" c' No, not anybody. She said she come to me, -because I hated the women, -and told me to look out and heed and listen to her." "And you did?" "I guess I did. I heard every word as plain as day." ' And saw her all the time?" a To be sure I did. I was looking right straight at her, and she right straight at me. O, how handsome she was!" "Did she haze on costume?" "I don't know. She had a sight of real pretty ringlets, and they come clear down to the floor, and covered her almost all over, and I thought she had on something that looked like thin gauze or muslin." a She stood on the floor?"   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH        CENTURY. 109 "No, she didn't stand on any thing, but just as -a feather does in the air, or a fish in the water." "How she came or how she went you cannot tell?" "No; the first thing I saw of her, she was standing right before me, and she went away just as quick. She went right out in the storm." "A stormy night, was it?" "Yes, the rain poured down in pails-ful and it thundered and lightened awfully." "Did any thing else happen?" "I guess there did. Everything in my room was all at once hopping about and turned topsy-turvy, and as quick as she come it all come right again. I was sitting on the foot- board,"---and from this point he proceeded to give a full ac- count of the scene on that wonderful night. Miss Boston having attentively heard him  through, re-     mained for some time in thoughtful silence. At last she- said to herself- "Strange!-very strange!--this must be so-there is noth- ing impossible in it after all " then turning to him, And she told you that woman was going to rule very soon?"

Time had passed so insensibly, that they were scarcely aware of having left the depot, before "' Poughkeepsie" was announced by the conductor. "I must leave you here, sir," said Miss B--, "as I am to address an audience at this place, this evening." Wishing her success, and expressing the hope of seeing her again, with a friendly shake of the hand, they bade each other farewell, and parted. Stopping in Albany, for a short time, Amaziah chanced to spy an advertisement in flaming letters. "FITS! FITS!!! "A sure cure for fits, adapted to all ages, conditions, and sexes, especially to females. Sole agency for the State of New York!!

The clerk very politely informed him that they had a few boxes left, and placing them on the counter, advised him, by all means, to take the " lot," protesting that they were invaluable, and could be had nowhere else, that if he should not happen to want them all himself, he could very readily dis- pose of them.

Contrary to his antiroi-' pation, there was none to greet him but Dinah. Wilson had! gone into the country to purchase a cow.

Over- come with fatigue, in conjunction with the law of habit, he went early to bed and quickly fell into a sound sleep. The meeting broke up at a late hour. Dinah, like a faithful ser- vant, anxious to be up betimes in the morning, had gone to rest, when her mistress and the mantua-maker returned. They of course must have their chat in relation to the meeting and matters in general, so that the " big hour " arrived before they were ready to retire. Mrs. W-- instructed her friend that (112)    <pb n="Illustration-113" xml:id="VAC6456-00000062"/>   FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH   CENTURY. 113 she could occupy the same apartment as before. The mantua-      A maker alleging the brightness of the evening quite equal to that of day, declined a proffered light, and with the mutual  wishes of " pleasant dreams," proceeded to her lodgings. Her  nightly toilet completed, with the exception of something  under her pillow, whither she thrust one hand and at the same time throwing open the sheets with the other, in the im- petuosity of extreme haste, her foot was on the side-rail ready for a vault into the bosom of repose, when with a shriek that proved the soundness of her lungs, she bounded from the  room and down stairs, at every leap screaming "murder! murder .i Started from his slumber, yet but half awake, and thinking surely the house must be in flames, Badger sprang upon the floor, threw his morning gown about him,. rubbed his eyes and rushed after her, crying "fire! fre!" As he passed the sec- end floor, Mrs. Wilson bursting into the hall, frightened quite out of her wits, fell in behind him, and in her headlong descent filled up the chorus with " murder!-fire!-ihep!' Bachelor, landlady and old maid, all landed in a promiscuous heap, at the foot of the stairs. Dinah who happened just then to have a  wakefil turn, had instantly struck a light, and with formidable courage, came shuffling into the hall, exclaiming-  Lor a mighty, wat be de matter, wat mean all dis dreful fusion here?" The boarders, aroused by the clamor, began to make their ap- pearance, to learn the cause of this midnight alarm, in their semi-nude and nightly regalia, while here and there were seen  night-caps timidly peering through the several doors.

"Bress me, Missur Badger, am dat you?" said Dinah, holding up the candle and rubbing her eyes to assure herself of his identity. "Wat for, sir, you rais'n sich a sturbance dis o'clock ob de night, to skeer eb'ry body to def." I-- I don't know, Dinah," stammered the frightened man; "somebody came to my room and woke me up, crying 'mur- der,' and I ran down to see what it was." His voice being recognized by Mrs. Wilson, the mystery was readily unraveled. In his absence, she had as a matter of convenience, in accordance with the liberty often exercised in public houses as well as private - assigned the mantua-maker the temporary occupancy of his dormitory. He was uncon- scious of the arrangement, they of his return, and hence the above innocent, yet almost critical adventure. Further explanation was unnecessary. With manifold cach- inations, those who had come to the rescue, returned to their quarters-the nightcaps vanished-Badger vamosed-and the mantua-maker 'turned in' with the landlady, for the remain- der of the night. But the denoument was not yet. They had just composed themselves soundly to sleep, when Wilson re- turned. It was understood that he should not be home till the next day, but having accomplished the object of his mis- sion, like good husbands in general, preferring the sacrifice of his rest to even a night's absence from his family, he took up his solitary ride and reached home at an early hour in the morning.   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH CENTURY. 115 Gaining silent entrance by means of his night-key - to avoid disturbing the slumbers of the inmates-and his familiarity with his own domicile precluding the necessity of striking a light, he very quietly retired, unobserved by the heavy sleepers, and himself ignorant of the home arrangements, except-to use his own words-he thought his " better half" had monopo- lized territory some degrees north of "Mason's and Dixon's line," but in the spirit of " compromise," he very peacefully occupied the unappropriated space, though at the great hazard of falling out of bed. A few moments, and all alike had passed to the realm of forgetfulness. It was a late hour in the morning. Morpheus seemed re- luctant to release his subjects, and long held them in the smudging toils of drowsiness. The sun, unable to look through, could barely peep by the edges of the heavy curtains in faint and slender lines upon the dingy wall. At last the mantua-maker was awake, Wilson about half so, his wife yawned once. "How ashamed I shall be to see him," said Miss Hager, "I am thirty-five years old, and never before did I cut such a caper." "O, that's nothing, only a little mistake," drawled the land- lady, in her half conscious, dreamy state, as they lay cozily with their faces to the wall. "He never'd known who it was, if you hadn't made such a racket coming down stairs, and-if--Dinah hadn't come with --the-can-d--l--e," and she was in a drowse again. "What would folks say if they only knew it, Mrs. Wilson?" earnestly exclaimed the troubled maiden: "I wouldn't have it known for the world."    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6456-00000064"/> "6        LucY BosTON. "O, Mr. Badger is a nice man. He will keep it to himself, and Dinah never tells tales-you know I never keep tattlers about me,' replied Mrs. W--, in a consolitary tone, as she made another effort to come out of her sleepy fit. "Now don't, for mercy sake, tell your husband about it, will you, I feel so awfully--" "The devil you do," said Wilson, peering into the mantua- maker's face. "What new chum have you over there, wife?" Miss Hagar uttered a cry as if oppressed by a score of nightmares, and giving the coverlets so violent a twitch over her head as to leave her nether extremities exposed-thus "robbing Peter to pay Paul" -she suddenly collapsed as if drawn together by a thousand cramps, with exclamations of "Oh, dear! Oh, dear me! What shall I do? What shall I do?" It seemed as if the frightened creature would absolutely shrink into nothing. "Why, husband, are you there?" said Mrs. Wilson, now fairly opening her eyes. "Yes, wife, I'm right here." "I thought you wasn't coming home last night. This is Miss Hagar, the mantua-maker. She thinks I better have a basque. Miss Hagar, my husband, Mr. Wilson" --- but this formal introduction was not responded to by the unlucky spinster.  There was still discoverable, on the back side, a diminutive- looking heap, but the interjections had subsided by degrees into a violent panting and low tremulous groans. "What's up between her and Badger, wife? A love affair,   FOLLIES OP THE XIXTH      CENTURY. 117 eh! All right, all righlt. Miss Badger, I hope for a better acquaintance." "She made a little mistake last night," said the wife, and got into his room. She --" "O yes, all right," interrupted he. "An old bach--of fifty and a maiden on the shady side of thirty-six are apt to Dinah found out the mistake." "Wonder if Amaziah can tell the difference between a live mantua-maker and her sign? I'll interrogate him.. Come, come, Mrs. Badger, don't lie curled up there like a possum. You're not dead yet. Guess you'll survive the shock. Most capital joke on Badg. though-capital." "Why, Mr. Wilson! you sha'nt talk so to her. It was only a mistake. She did'nt know he was in his room. We did'nt get home from the meeting till 'leven or twelve." "All right-she could'nt, of course, very well expect he would be there at that time of night. But I guess she'll sur- vive it. You take good care of her, wife, and I'll go and see whether Amaziah is dead or alive." The little mound by the wall seemed to be in spasms, like the shaking of a miniature earthquake or a galvanic battery acting upon a pile of muscles, the only thing that now indi- cated animal life, save a faint' moaning sound. Wilson, hastily creeping into his apparel, made his exit. The mantua-maker's form gradually relaxed from its rigid rotundity, and crawling timidly from her hiding place after her landlady, with nervous rapidity she sheltered her affrighted    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6456-00000065"/> "8        LUCY  BOSTON. modesty with her wardrobe, meanwhile repeating to herself, "Oh, dear!" followed by long, exhausting sighs. The good landlady endeavored to cheer her, telling her not to mind it--that " nobody was to blame" - there was " no harm done"-that it was useless to cry for " spilt milk" -be- sides, " accidents would happen in the best of families," &amp;c. This very innocent and harmless occurrence furnished a dish nicely adapted to Wilson's palate for "fun-jottings," and which, with occasional " hashing up and warming over," was sufficient to last for some time. Yielding to his ruling passion for sport, he took a cruel satisfaction in misconstruing every attempted explanation, feigning himself ignorant, though well aware of the real facts in the case. He did not seek Badger, but, on the contrary, avoided him, being unwilling to abate the richness of the joke by allowing him any opportunity for explanation. Amaziah, methodical to rule, and feeling a peculiar pressure in the region of the lungs, sought out-door air, for the relief of his respiratory organs. Meeting the chambermaid, he said to her-- "You may take those things on my table and hand them to Miss Hager." She proceeded in obedience to his direction, and gathering them promiscuously in her apron, was descend- ing the stairs, when Mrs. Wilson, who chanced to spy our bachelor making his exit from the front door, called out "Kate!" "Yes, marm!" echoed the customary answer. "Go to Mr. Badger's room and fetch the dress-maker's tc 'h and L ir."   , ^ ; -:I  r 8' -by    FoLLAES OF TflE XIXrni CENTURY. 119"   a' An sure, marm, I cannot pul 'em out alone," answered the ignorant servant in her surprise at the mandate. "Do as I bid you; start, and don't be long about it neither." This dictatorial address touched Kate's "Irish," and dis- charging the contents of her apron in confusion on the stairs, lest they should be in the way of fulfilling her orders, and flirting back, rummaged the room thoroughly, and returned to report non est-not to be found. Entering the apartment occupied by Irs. Wilson and her mantua-maker, on seeing the latter bald and toothless, she exclaimed- "An sure, why didn't you tell me you had done it yourself. I lucked the room all over for her, an you was pulling her teeth and hair all out yourself, you was, ma'am." "You stupid lout,!" said her mistress; "I told you" -- As he is gone," interrupted Miss Hayer, " you watch for Mr. Badger, and I will run up myself and adjust them in his room before any body sees me. And away she flew, with the agility of a panther, making the ascent at half a dozen strides, and on her arrival -consternation and grief! Her beauty had indeed departed! The alarm given, Mrs. Wilson hastened to her relief. Every nook and corner, every trunk and drawer was ransacked, but the lost treasures where nowhere to be found. The fruitless search given over, the disappointed couple descended again, Mrs. W---  to feel regret, and Miss H--  bewidowed of her charms, to lament her sudden and most sore bereavement. In the meantime Kate had resumed her sweeping, forgetful of the presents, till among the "odds and ends," covered with dust, and in a " beautiful snarl," she was about brushing them      <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6456-00000066"/> 120        LUCY    BOSTON. into the dust-pan; when gathering them up she presented herself before the bereaved mantua-maker, saying, "Misthur Badger come from New York yestherday, an brought you some presenths, he did marm, an bade me gave em to you, an here they be, sure-nice presents them are, sure." As she emptied her apron into Miss Hager's lap, when lo I teeth, hair, and boxes met the astonished gaze of the owner. Like the "presenths,' Kate vanished. With upraised hands, and smiling through her tears, she wel- comed back her departed charms, though presenting a some- what soiled dishabile complexion. Proper applications, however, readily restored their original luster, and under the enchant- ment of the toilet, baldness and toothlessness soon reflourished in all the freshness and bloom of maid-n beanty. Breakfast was announced. The mantua-maker at first refused, preferring the second table, but finally yielding to persuasion, followed the landlady, who assured her that none but her hus- band knew " any thing about who it was, and he wouldn't tell,"/' Amaziah, too, would have preferred absence to his breakfast, but wisely concluding the best way would be to meet the emergency boldly, his courage got the mastery, and he marched straight forward, yet hardly able to conceal a faltering step. All were seated, the landlord " doing the honors of the table." The boarders cast significant glances at each other, and evi- dently, with difficulty, restrained their risibilities. Mrs. W-- thinking to display great generalship, and cover the retreat of the discomfited parties, hit upon the plan of an introduction, intending by the very boldness of the manoeuvre to come a reuse on the pursuers and decoy them into the belief that there was   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH       CENTURY. 121 neither "game" nor booty; in other words, to separate in the minds of the boarders all connection between the two leading actors of the last night's scene. This, it must be confessed, was the part of benevolence; but whether it displayed equal wisdom, is at least questionable. Be that as it may, her course was taken; and fortunately, the position of the parties, sitting directly opposite each other, favored the design. : Mr. Badger," said Mrs. W---, assuming an unnatural gravity in attempting to be simply serious, thus pointing and touching off the very guns she intended to spike, - " allow me the pleasure, sir, of making you acquainted with my friend Miss Hager." "I guess they're in a fair way to get pretty well acquainted, wife," remarked Wilson, significantly. A suppressed tittering went round the table. No one dare look up, for fear/of an explosion. The dress-maker's face rivaled the blushing rose. Badger looked dead blank. "Miss Hager, how is your appetite this morning?" asked Wilson, with comic sobriety, and without waiting for a reply served her very bountifully. "And now, friend Badger, I know what you want. A good night's sleep has whet your appetite sharp - I can tell by your looks. I may be mistaken though, for ' mistakes do happen in the best of families,' don't they wife?" There was manifestly a covert meaning in all this, not understood except by those initiated. The comer of Wilson's eye and the muscles of his mouth indicated more than'his words conveyed. All were sensible there was something " in the wind" which had not been blown to them yet. But in the absence of more definite    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6456-00000067"/> 122        LUCY  BOSTON. knowledge, some in silence affected a very knowing look, while others in merciless sport demanded of the old Bach., if he. was accustomed to catch the- nightmare and, old Putnam-like, ride down stairs? He was "cornered," and though riddled with shot, stood the charge bravely, which fortunately diverted the attack from the less courageous victim on the opposite side. It is fruitless to attempt a full description of the scene, but it may safely be said, that no one of the number contracted the dyspepsia that morning, unless it be Amaziah and the dress- maker. "Well, Badger," said Wilson, after breakfast, by way of re- lief to the poor fellow, "you've had a pretty hard siege since your return from the city. Suppose we take a ride into the country? A little airing will do you good -I guess the wo- men can spare us to-day." Badger gladly accepted. With whip and spur, they were soon under way.   *   CHAPTER XI. "She begged that philosophic spirit, Which Fame allowed him to inherit, To fix and settle her opinion As to its rights and its dominion." "I can call spirits from the vasty deep," "Why, so can I, or so can any man: But will they come when you do call them?" HE reader will recollect that we left Miss Boston at Pough- keepsie.  She drew a large audience and created a favora- ble impression. Having also delivered lectures in Hudson, Al- bany, and Schenectady, she returned in health and spirits. Her advent was quickly heralded through the town. Soon Mrs. Hudson, an intimate and believing friend, was announced, who upon hearing the report of the convention, lectures, &amp;c., which Miss B---   had attended, proceeded to narrate the events which had transpired at home, in her absence. It is proper to remark, that previous to Miss Boston's de- parture,  Spiritualisnm " had made its appearance in the neighborhood. Several meetings had been held and "demon- strations" receivedl, resulting in the institution of "circles,' as they terlled them, meaning, probably, the union of the visi- ble and invisible worlds, thus constituting the great magnetic cycle, and hence the fitness of the appellation. However, they were not as yet so thoroughly organized, or the connec- (123)    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6456-00000068"/> 124        LUCY   BOSTON. tion was not so perfectly formed as always to secure the advent of the spirits. Sometimes they were favored with "'demon- strations," but were not entirely satisfied as to their genuine- ness. A Tap was heard on the -side of the house/but might it not be occasioned by the wind which at the time was blow- ing a gale. Occasionally there were palpable indications of the presence of " spirits," but then they could not be recalled, and this gave rise to no small variety of rhetoric and logic, re- 'sulting in an equal variety of opinions. However, the "circle" was in its incipiency, and its re- peated failures could easily be accounted for, in various wals -a misunderstanding between the spiritualists and the spirits --an absence or obstruction of inter-spherical-communication- a want of ability or disposition on the part of the ghosts-- these, and sundry other considerations mundane, and super- mundane, were sufficient to have banished perplexity from the minds of the believers, reconciled their discrepancies and silenced the skeptics, yet was there doubt, anxiety, and rank unbelief. But during the absence of Miss Boston, new light had burst upon the benighted community, in relation to the mysterious rappings. A lecturer, one of the new lights of this extraordinary nineteenth century, made his appearance, and promised for two shillings a head to reveal the secret of calling spirits from the "vasty deep," alleging his ability to make them come to any spot, day or night, in sunshine or in storm. This indeed was strange. But what was pas ing strange, they would do any thing at his bidding, that spic- tators might desire, affording them profit and amusement to any amount, in kind and degree. If required, they would set   FOL LIES OF THE    XIXTH    CENTURY. 125 the tables dancing-teach writing-mathematics-languages --geography--in short, all the arts and sciences, not only of this " mundane sphere," but even communicate by signs and hieroglyphics, which he would interpret, the geology, geogra- phy, topography, zoology, paleontology, with all. other ologies; not only the complete natural history, but the social, civil, po- litical and ecclesiastical constitution and developments of the seven anti-mundane or spiritual spheres. "He told," said Mrs. Hudson, " wherein we had not worked it right - that we had at times almost heard the raps, but not knowing the secret sign, were unable to succeed. One evening which he spent with us, we invited in some friends, and the thing being noised abroad, the room was full., We afterwards held a very large meeting, which produced a wonderful stir." "It would have given me much satisfaction to be present," remarked Miss B --, with fixed attention and thoughtful countenance. "Did any spirits but those of human beings appear?" "We had no 'manifestations' from any others." "Did he express any opinion in his lectures on that partic- ular point 2 " "I think -- not -- Yes he did, too, say something about calling spirits from the 'vasty deep.'" "Did you understand him that he had done, or that he could do so? In other words, did he speak of his experience or his theory? I feel some little interest on that subject." "I do not remember exactly about that, but we are to have a 'circle' at our house this evening, at seven o'clock precisely. He said we must be very exact in the appointment, and punc-    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6456-00000069"/> 126        Lucy  BOSTON. tual to a second, or it might make a difference. I hope you won't fail to come, and we will ascertain how many kinds of spirits there are. We had a circle last evening, and the spirits told us they would be present to-night. I have become so deeply interested in the subject, that I can scarcely attend to any thing else. Mr. Hudson, too, is all absorbed in it, and so is neighbour Taburg. Their business is hardly thought of. The lecturer took up his abode at our house, and gave me some lessons in private. O, he is a perfect love of a man! Now you will come, Miss Boston, won't you? Don't, for the world, disappoint us. "I will endeavor to be there." "And you must be sure to come, just at the time precisely. A Should you happen to be a minute, or even a second, too late, it might keep the spirits away and spoil the circle." "I will try to be punctual," said Miss B --, as Mrs. H--  departed, highly elated in anticipation of the inter- view, and surcharged with nervous excitement, though a very worthy lady, by the way-honest, sincere, and well disposed, but one easily led by stronger minds to do not only what was right, but possibly the reverse. Miss Boston was one of the remarkable women-intellectual, calm, reflecting, determined: she could not easily be jostled or turned aside from the onward and "' even tenor of her way." She was never " subject to fits." The hour arrived. The "circle," consisting of a dozen members and the spectators, were assembled. A large table in the center of the room, and the requisite number of chairs, wereplaced in order about it. Mrs. Hudson selected as "me-   9. . FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CENTURY. 127 dium" for the evening, they at once ranged themselves around the table. Joining hands, Mrs. Hudson gave directions for all to be perfectly still and passive until some spirit should mani- fest itself, which she was confident, if they had made no mis- take, would be in a short time. Fifteen minutes silently elapsed without a demonstration, when Mrs. H-- inquired if they were proceeding accord- ding to rule. In reply, Mr. T--  thought they were, but something was wrong  he would see if the door was locked, as the lecturer taught them there could be no ' manifestations' without closed doors. Careful scrutiny discovered it to be partly locked, a phenomenon quite explanatory of their failure! The spirits are shy of open doors! Again the ring, in other words the "circle," united hands fifteen minutes longer, but with like result, when the indefati- gable mediums went into a general speculation upop the proba- ble causes of their disappointment. At last it occurred to a young lady, that the lecturer had said, or she thought he said, that the-lamp must not be on the table; doubtless for the reason that the spirits being unaccustomed to candle-light, it would naturally hurt their visual organs, and perhaps produce infiam- nation. This obstruction removed, the "ring" connected palms again, and charging the battery of their spiritual tele- graph, transmitted dispatches for the immediate advent of the celestials, but no answer was returned. What could be the difficulty? Either the consolidation of the "medium" forces was not sufficiently potent, or the spirits were away on a jour- ney or pre-occupied at some other "circle," or something    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6456-00000070"/> 128        LUCY  BOSTON. eelse. As to the mermaid, we would venture a suggestion, that she was busy arranging her evening debut, that is to say, she e w " not at home."  At all events there was a " screw loose, or a screw wanting somewhere. Upon a thorough canvass of all the causes, possible and. probable, of their abortive efforts, they agreed in ascribing the difficulty to the astounding fact. that the table was composed of pine. Great was their chagrin at such an oversight. What inattention, what unaccountable obtuseness, to forget that they were living in the advanced age of civilization, the palmy days of evangelical taste and refinement, when the private mansion, the hotel, the theater and the church, rivaled each other in the costliness of-their structure, the grandness of their architecture, and the artistic richness and beauty of their appendages. And should not the " spheres" be at least equally progressive? Should they be any less transcendental in*the exquisiteness of taste, style, and manners? The pine table was therefore replaced by one of rosewood, the spirits disclaiming to use furniture of a material more vulgar or common-place. But lo! the rosewood was as power- less as the pine. Not a ghost broke the silence. Thus completely foiled, the " circle " was forced to confess their failure; yet, instead of giving place-to unbelief, their faith increased to enthusiasm, and each resolving to find out the hinderance, they dispersed without the slightest intimation as to when or where, or how, the spirits would vouchsafe to them: an interview. The day following was one of busy excitement among the "rappers." Multifarious were the solutions invented to clear   FOLLIES OP THE    XIXTH   CENTURY. 129 up the mystery of their defeat, but neither of which seemed altogether satisfactory. As a last resort, Mr. Hudson was consulted in regard to the expediency of procuring the attendance of the lecturer to set things rightagain. The expense, however great, was of no ac- count, if he would but hasten to their relief. Miss Boston favored with frequent calls, was plied with numerous questions in relation to the rap-less spirits, but was not very ommuni- cative. She said little and thought much. In an interview with Mr. Hudson, she was particular to interrogate him as to the character and whereabouts of the lecturer. Our heroine was soon missing. Her silent departure occasioned various conjectures, but the prevalent opinion was, that she had gone on a lecturing tour. The "ciScle," in the meantime, continued to assemble pri- vately, in sections of two or three, but failed of obtaining any "manifestations." Miss Boston went in pursuit of the lecturer-not that she was particularly a believer in him; her object was light. Strik- ing his trail, she overtook him at a certain small village in central New York, where he had given several lectures, and with eminent success. Large audiences--ignoble and town- elite-crowded around him, and all ranks of spirits awaited his bidding. The object of general attraction, and idolized byihis followers, he commanded princely wages for his invaluable in- structions. Miss B---   took lodgings at the Hotel. The succeeding day she spent in exploring the romantic little village and its suburbs, remaining incog., and concealing the real object of    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6456-00000071"/> 130       LUCY  BOSTON, her visit. Making the acquaintance of the landlady, she gained from her a history of the prevailing excitement in the circle there, and learned the names of the most prominent actors. While thus engaged in conversation, the landlady pointed her to the lecturer, entering a store on the opposite side of the way. Miss Boston, after the fashion of young ladies in general, making it convenient just then, to call at the store for some trifling article, which she knew or hoped they did not have, found a number discussing the prevailing subject, with mutual congratulations upon their success, and speculating on what strange things would be revealed in the evening. Miss B-  's ears were erect, while examining the articles which did " not suit," as long as propriety would allow, when with dignified modesty, she ventured two or three incidental re- marks, hoping, she said, that they would not deem her imper- tinent and bold, but she was anxious to be informed on the subject in which they appeared to be so deeply engrossed-she had heard much respecting it, and had long desired to see some master of the science, who could give satisfactory evidence in its support. At once pointing to the lecturer they declared he was just the man; he could do it up " brown," if she would attend the "circle" in the evening, which would meet at a cottage half a mile from the village. They were positive that every thing would be demonstrated to her complete gratification, for a large number of spirits were engaged to be "on hand," and no mis- take but they would be. Why, amid such general interest, they should assemble in a little obscure cottage, seemed somewhat singular, but then   FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CENTURy. 131 these spirits like all other folks have their caprices, and like them they will be gratified, or become refractory. Miss B-, wishing to make the most of her mission, re- quested a private interview with the lecturer at her room, which being readily granted, they were soon in close conver- sation on the all-absorbing topic. Like a philosopher, she scanned his experience with the keenest scrutiny, and sounded his knowledge to the bottom. She found him visionZ ary, enthusiastic, self-confident,and all-wise, claiming to be sole master of the spirit land. Hie did not therefore command her special respect, as a man of mind, of reason, and judg- ment. Yet had she the sagacity to discover that his whole soul was in the subject, and concluding that if in reality he had the knowledge and control of spirits, asserted by him, it must arise from his temperament rather than his wisdom, ad as the whole science was mysterious, it might perhaps be in keeping with the mystery, and also with philosophy, that those of his constitutional class should furnish the principal "me- diunms," like the fishermen of Galilee, obscure, unlearned, sim- ple-minded, but the chosen heralds of the new faith. She learned that, among other places, he bad lectured with splendid success at the village of --- (her place of residence), and organized a "circle" there, which he was assured bid fair to be the very finest established. The good cause, he said was rapidly advancing there and the people were exceedingly anxious to have him return, which he intended to do, as soon as his pressing engagements would permit. Sufficiently enter- tained with his superlative rodomontade, she questioned him: i   's 'iDo you believe, sir; that the channel of communication be-    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6456-00000072"/> 132        LUCY  BOSTON. tween the visible and the invisible worlds, is entirely perfected, as to its agency and method?" 4 Certainly I do, I have no doubt of it-I know it, for the spirits have told me so." -"Have you had any ' demonstration' from other than human spirits?" "No, because I have never called any other." - If there are other spirits besides human and angelic, can you hold intercourse with them?" "Of course I can. I have one prime spirit at my command which has free access to all the spheres, having a pass to go and come at any moment, as my agent, carrying back and forth any information I choose." "You can obtain any intelligence you wish, at any mo- ment?" "Most certainly I can." "Will you then, sir, for my satisfaction, be so kind as to inform me now, whether or not your general agent, as you call it, is the spirit of a male or female?" "I will answer you in five minutes: you remain perfectly passive," said he, with an air of the utmost confidence, when taking off his hat and buttoning up his coat, he placed his hands upon the stand, closed his eyes, crossed his legs; instantly a rap was heard: " the spirit is present," said he, "you may ask it any question you like. One rap or one tip of the table means no; three raps or three tips, yes." Miss Boston's face prospectively brightened, and she put the interrogatory direct. "Are you the spirit of a male or female?"          .  ,            ffi 4   . . S A, id    FOfLIES OF THE XIXTH      CENTURY. 133 No rap. She repeated the question, but the ghost was mute. "I should be extremely gratified, sir, to learn whether the spirit you have called, belongs to the masculine or feminine gender?" "It is not best for you to know now," he replied. (The spirits do sometimes refuse to rap when it's improper or inex- pedient. I will inquire if it is proper for you to know what you ask for. Shall I tell?" asked he of the spirits, mentally. One tremendous rap. "Really, I can see no impropriety in my interrogatory," said Miss B--. "I am a sincere inquirer, and actuated by the purest motives. An answer would afford me much pleasure, and it might greatly conduce to the benefit of the human race." "The spirit would not refuse to answer me, if I should press it; but then it knows what is best, and don't like to be urged. Ask any thing else, and you shall have an answer." "Will the spirit communicate with me?" said Miss B--. Rap, rap, rap, in the affirmative. "Are the 'spheres' inhabited by any but human and angelic spirits?" No reply. "The spirit is with me," interrupted the lecturer-his fingers at the same instant beginning to twitch; "the spirit is with me and want's to write." Miss Boston placed before him note-book and pencil, which as the amanuensis of the spirits, he took and wrote, "That man with you must not know my gender at this time." 12 ?

"There's something wrong in you or your questions," said the medium. "I'll communicate alone and find out what you want to know, and if not forbid, will tell you all about it. I must beg to be excused now, for the 'circle' are waiting for me, and as they have given up their vocations and are paying me large wages, the spirits direct to meet them imme- diately. I hope, continued he, you'll meet with us to-night." "Will you be able, sir, to afford me any light, at the 'circle' on the questions I have propounded?" "' I guess not, this evening," said he, " as I have so many spirits promised, and they'll be disappointed not to be called." "Can you obtain a promise, sir, in my behalf for to-morrow night?" "-The spirits, ma'am, inform me that I must go a: once; but that I may see you here again at three o'clock this afternoon, if you wish me to?" Very well, sir, I shall be happy to see you." Miss B--- was alone. "In what fathomless mystery are these things involved," said she to herself, settling into a state of profound thought. The more she reasoned, and the deeper her contemplation, the stronger grew her conviction, that the obscurity would be cleared up, and that this controlling spirit alluded to by the lecturer would prove to be none other than the spirit of the mermaid. Her meditations were interrupted by the return of the lec} turer, who, according to appointment, entered at the exact minute.                        f   FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH   CENTURY. 135 "You are very punctual, sir," said Miss B -. "Yes, I never carry any time-piece. The spirits are my chronometer." "Be seated, sir, if you please." He complied, when she continued - "Permit me, sir, to say frankly, that my purpose in coming to this place, was to make your acquaintance, and consult you upon a matter of great importance. I am an ad- vocate of 'woman's rights,' and a believer in i spiritual inter- course,' the two grandest themes of the age, fraught as they are with the destiny of the world. And now to come directly to the object of my visit, I wish you to inform me, if in your power, whether or not there is such a being as the spirit of a Mermaid in either of the seven Spheres; and if there be, whether I can have an interview with it? To tell you the truth, sir, I have met a person-who, or what he is, or where his residence, I know not - to whom a being purporting to be the spirit of a Mermaid has twice appeared and uttered a prophecy, to the effect that the cause with which I am identified will soon prevail. If true, as he relates of all supernatural revelations nest to the sacred volume, it is pre-eminently the most important. Now if such a spirit really exists, can you not learn the fact and hold intercourse with it?" "Of course I can -of course I can; there is nothing in all the Spheres kept from me," exclaimed he, with pompous emphasis. "Pray, sir, instruct me in this science of spiritology, that I may become an adept in it like yourself," "Certainly, certainly, I have no objection if the spirits think it propeer; I will ask them at the 'circle' to-night. At any rate, I can easily learn for myself, if there is such a spirit ,    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6456-00000074"/> 136         LucY  BOSTON. as you speak of, and I can talk with it, but it may refuse com- munication with any one else, and, forbid my telling what it reveals to me." "If there is a Mermaid spirit," persisted she, I it has ap- peared twice to mortal eyes; and if I can but be satisfied of its 'existence, it will afford me great relief." O well, I'll tell you that much most any time." "And will you become my preceptor in this mystic art? I am anxious to become a scholar." {"I will advise with the spirits as to that, and let you know," said he. Assuming the spiritually communicative or interlocutory posture for -a short time, he opened his eyes and announced that he would give her lessons, telling her, however, he was so pre- occupied, that it was impossible for him to attend to her case then, but at his earliest convenience he would gladly spend a few days at her residence, when he would teach her the whole secret, and no doubt she would become as perfect a Medium as himself. She remarked that her chief anxiety was to know if there was such a spirit as she had described, and if no light could be shed upon that point at the " circle," perhaps she had better not attend, as her presence might be an impediment to their success. "There is not the least danger of that," said he, "as the spirits have promised to come, and they never disappoint me; besides, I have just received intelligence from the seventh Sphere, that it is decidedly best for you to be present." "How long do you think, sir, it will require for me perfectly to master the science of Spirit-calling?"   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH CENTURY. 137 O, not long, an apt scholar will do it very quick." "Can you not then, sir, meet me here to-morrow morning and give me the introductory lesson?" I I hardly know what to say, ma'am; I'll ask the spirits"- whereupon closing his eyes, and moving his lips a moment, he announced that he would comply with her request and meet her at nine o'clock, adding that she had better attend the "circle" in the evening, which she promised to do. Evening came. She found her way to the cottage -she found her way into the room, and found herself a seat. Prob- ably' the "rappers" trace localities and form acquaintances magnetically, and hence no need of directories or guide-boards, and wherever there is the homogeneous state, or magnetic con- geniality of pure " spiritualism," it generates a consciousness,  at once mutual and all-pervading, like the equalized polarity of the particles of the load-stone. In such cases, there is an in- tuitive recognition and equilibrium of thought between the individuals; but where, in either or all of the parties, there is wanting a psychological affinity, in the spiritual sense, percep- tion is obscure, and a mutual acquaintance can only be formed ; : by means of a formal introduction. Hence the apparent lack of civility to Miss B--. Not that the "rappers" were ignorant or destitute of true politeness; but feeling her to be a ripe subject for the spiritual influence, they left her to sub- side spontaneously into essential coincidence with the unity of the "circle." The room was soon comfortably filled. A general serious- ness predominated. Little was said. Everything appeared systematic, doubtless in accordance with the spiritual pro- -:!

All at length were gathered around the table, save their invited guest. Portentous silence reigned. Our heroine was both anxious and awe-struck at the solemnity of the scene. What awful thoughts crowded upon her mind! Spirits from the eternal world returning to the earth and about to hold audible inter-- course with mortals! And what spirits? Some of them per- haps her departed friends! Anon, one of the Mediums dropped his chin upon his breast presently another, and then a third, and so on, at dif- erent points in the (' ring," indicating the arrival of the spirits. The lecturer, sitting at the head of the table as spiritual moderator, directed hands to be unloosed, which was instantly done. G6ing round to those enjoying a tete-a-tete with their invisible guests, he made a few " passes," muttered a sort of spiritual hocus pocus, then pronouncing them ready for'colm- munications, asked- "Are there any spirits present?" Great variety of rapping and writing. What spirits are present?" Medium A--    instantly wrote "Goliah, Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Prince Nincompoopdwsky." Medium B--  wrote Baron Mon Chausen, Sam Patch, and Rip Van Winkle. Medium C--, a precocious schoolboy, seizing his pen, dashed down, in daring roundhand, "Sinbad the Sailor, Ro- binson Crusoe, Old Mother Hubbard, and The Babes in the Woods."   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH      CENTURY.    139 Of the rapping mediums he inquired- "Is the spirit of John Randolph present?" No rap. "Is the spirit of Henry Clay present?" No rap. "Is the spirit of Daniel Webster, present?' No rap. "Is the spirit of Dr. Franklin here?" Three raps.. "Is the spirit of General Washington here?" Rap - rap -  rap. "Are the spirits of Adam and Eve present?" The table bowed and courtesied at the same time. At this point the alphabet was called, when several rapped out the names of "Iammon,"  "Witch of Endor," "Balaam," and "Beelzebub.' "Is there any other spirit present?" asked he. A strong but gentle rapping in the affirmative, manifestly by a female spirit.   '  Is it the spirit of Queen Elizabeth?" One rap. :t Of Miary, Queen of Scots?" One rap. -    "' Of Pocahontas?

One spiteful rap. From this the lecturer went on mentioning name after name, exhausting his entire list of the departed, and to each of which he received a negative answer. Judging from the last rap, the spirit was evidently enraged to think it could not be called. Miss Boston requested him to ask if it was not the spirit of a Mermaid, which he refused to do, on the ground that he knew it was not. "Because," said he, "they always tell me in advance when they are coming. Her name has slipped my mind just now, but I will consult my guardian spirit, and find out what one it is." Whereupon at his refusal to put the question, the chairs, with the exception of Miss Boston's, all flew bottom upwards, spilling their occupants headlong, while the table, walking up in pugilistic style, fetched the lecturer a furious blow under the left peeper, knocking him flat upon the floor. "O, what a falling down was there, my countrymen i" Miss Boston continued a quiet spectator of the unique de- monstration. Speedily as possible, the prostrate "circle" gathered themselves up, and carrying their wounded leader to another room, the spirit of Esculapius was importunately but vainly invoked to obtain a spiritual prescription. The circle of course was broken up for the evening. Miss Boston left, strongly impressed that if her request had been granted, she would have heard from the spirit of the mermaid.   CHAPTER XII.  "The over curious are not over wise." "Trifles, light as air, Are, to the jealous, confirmations strong        I As proofs of holy writ." W  ILSON and our bachelor, enjoying the scenery and pure air of the country, reached home late in the afternoon. Numerous were the calls at Mr. Badger's room, and great the inquiry made for him during the day, by the prominent portion of the female population, most of whom left their cards with urgent requests to see him as soon as possible after his return. Brought thus suddenly into notoriety, like many of Fortune's favorites, he was in extensive demand among the ladies, both young and old. This afforded capital stock for a rich investment of Wilson's wit, and industriously did he im- prove it, to the extent of his ample capacity and the availa- bility of the market. The mantua-maker had plied her needle with surprising dex. terity, and the new dress stitched in detail and basted in the, main, was fast approaching a readiness for ascertaining the "fit." The community, far and near, had been thrown into a par- oxysm of excitement by the issue of the village paper. Exten- sive gatherings had been mustered, and the awful city of New '(141)    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6456-00000077"/> "2        LUCy  BOSTON.  York denounced and anathematized by the wholesale. The "Tetrabune" and "Seasons," the only " city papers" (a single copy of each) taken in the place, had arrived, bringing an account of the great meeting in the Tabernacle, to the neigh- borhood of readers, but which was not clearly understood by them; nor had they discovered the relation between the notice that occasioned the excitement, and the convention. Such in general was the posture of affairs. The editor's wife called on ; Mr. Badger in the evening, to gather the "very latest" news for the forth-coming issue of the National Bulletin. The editress, pro tem., was either feverishly excited, or else propelled by extreme nervous energy, which no doubt was measurably increased on the return of the senior editor-alias, her husband; for, according to report, he had elevated her, or, in common parlance, '" blowed her up," for the insertion of her editorial of the preceding week. He had also written a "Ieader," explanatory of the said article, shifting the entire responsibility of it upon his associate editress. As before observe, the editor's wife sought friend Badger to obtain a fresh, full, and authentic description of the "wo- man's rights" convention, with which to astonish the readers of the National Bulletin. He favored her with a minute exposition of the whole affair, and also of what was shortly coming to pass, and when she would be installed sole occupant of the editorial chair. Astonished and delighted, she had passed from Mr. B--'s to Mrs. Wilson's room. Soon the editor himself called, and in- quiring for our illustrious old bachelor, was told by Kate (who did not recognize him) that he was "in his room, for a long o                 "e   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH       CENTURY. 148 time, with the idithur's wife." Representing his business as urgent, and insistingupon being showed up immediately, the chamber-maid led the way and rapped at the door, which, after a little delay, swung on its hinges. "How do you do, Mr. Badger?" said the typo; "I hope no intrusion, but you seem to be alone this evening." "Yes, just trow -walk in, walk in, sir." "A divil a bit is he alone, sir -the iditor's wife is there, sure, an has been iver so long, an faith she has, sir," imper-i- nently persisted Kate, who overheard the conversation. "Your wife was here a minute ago, and has just gone home," replied Amaziah. "That is a mistake, sir. I have this moment come from  there; besides, she could not have made her exit unseen by the servant. I should have felt no surprise, under the circum- stances, to find my wife here, Mr. Badger; but the fact of her concealment necessarily excites my surprise, if not suspicion. Will you allow me, sir, to survey your apartment?" "Just as leave you would as not, but you won't fird nothing." He availed himself of the permission, but there was clearly  an " alibi " in the case, and the search was suspended, when Kate, with her native impudence and pertinacity, repeated: "An faith, sir, she's there, sure. -By my sowl she is, sir." Whereupon, with the characteristic sagacity of his class, whose prerogative it is to bring hidden things to light, Mr. Printer recommenced a more scrutinizing investigation of the premises, when, as if with an intuitive perception of the sources of evidence, he drew forth from its secrecy a night-cap,       I       '] "-v    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6456-00000078"/> "4        LUCY   BOSTON . and holding it up, with an air of triumph, before the eyes of the petrified bachelor, demanded, "What is this, sir? Can you tell me the owner?" "It must be the dress-maker's," replied Badger, coloring with confusion. , The dress-maker's! What dress-maker?" "She's sewing for Mrs. Wilson." "I'll see about this," said the printer, starting down stairs with the suspicious article in his hand. Arriving at the hall door, 'he met Kate, and inquired, "Where's the dress-maker?" "In Mrs. Wilson's room, sure, sir." "Is there/ any one else there?" "Niver a one but Mrs. Wilson, sure." Gathering the cap into a wad in his hand, and availing him- self of his accustomed intimacy with the family, he entered with but little ceremony. Not observing his wife, who chanced to be sitting partly behind the door, he advanced towards the ill-fated seamstress, and commenced unfolding the unconscious cause of the brewing tempest. His wife springing forward, snatched it from his grasp, spitefully exclaiming: I' rll let you know, sir, when I want- you to wear my cap!" Ah! is that yours, my dear? Perhaps you had better ex- amine it." "It isn't very likely, sir, you'd have any woman's cap but mine. Let me see though (edging towards the window and fingering it with great scrutiny); as sure as I live it aint mine. Now, sir, I'd like to know who that belongs to; you don't get it again till you tell me, or I find out how you came by it."               ,   FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH    CENTURY.    145 a You say it is not your's, my dear, and that is all that concerns myself.

"And so do I," chimed in the mantua-maker. "Now, whose cap is this?" demanded Mrs. Printer of her senior partner. I'll find out if I have to advertise it in the paper; that I will." "You will not advertise it in the   paper, my dear," re- torted he. "I say I will."      '                    X "I say you will not." "I would-so there-if I   was in your place," said 5Mrs. Wilson."'

"I'll tell you how to find out all about it," said Wilson. "Its the simplest matter in the world. Just give me the cap, and deputize me with the"power of search,"to go around and try it on all the women's heads, till I find the one it fits. I'd like no better job. Its sure fire and no mistake."

Miss Hager can give us a clear solution of this dark problem, and she seems willing to do so--are you not?" asked he, turning to her. The seamstress, deeply absorbed just then in laying the plaits of the dress, did not heed his remarks. "Miss Hager, can you tell how that cap came in Mr. Badger's room?" demanded the editor's wife with a tone of authority. "Why I slept there, by Mrs. Wilson's direction, when he was gone to New York, and I left it under the pillow, through mistake, and-" "(There," exclaimed the printer, cutting her short, "this dreadful mystery is all explained.

This single occurrence alone is sufficient to convince the world of the folly of this 'latter day' scheme of 'woman's rights."' "Query," said Wilson. "If one stray night-cap makes such a rumpus now, while the bars are up between the sexes, what may we expect when the bars are taken down and all are turned together into the great pen of 'woman's' rights,' when it will require a magnifying glass to tell the difference between a man and a woman."

Shortly after, to their great surprise and consternation, a letter was received (by the U. S.

Her last interview with the lecturer satisfied the good sense of our heroine, at least as to his stability, if not his candor. Yet she hadno doubt of his being a Medium. She was con- vinced, however, that Spirit Rappings was no mere mechani- cal nor scientific operation-neither magic nor legerdemain. The lecturer, under the combined efficacy of Spiritopathy ,2S,:t    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6456-00000087"/> e 160       LuCY  BOSTON. and Homeopathy, was so far restored as to be able to meet the "rappers" -(or rather the " writers," for he had utterly re- pudiated the former)-according to appointment.  Great excitement had prevailed during the day. The recent event eclipsed every thing in the way of " demonstrations" ever before recorded in the annals of Spiritualism. The little village, nestled among the hills, all at once stood out upon the map of the world, illumined with a halo of glory. Its pillar of fame in the estimation of the spiritists, was reared conspicuous and lasting as Bunker Hill Monument, or the pyramids of Egypt; and on it was inscribed, first and foremost, the name of the renowned lecturer, as the benefactor of the world. No doubt existed but theirs was the favorite "circle" of the spirits, chosen and immortalized as the inventors or revealers of spirito- pathy, the- miraculous " latter-day" medical system destined to annihilate and supersede all others; before which all the "ills flesh is heir to" must vanish like mist before the sun, and even Death himself shall run and hide, afraid, lest meeting any of these spiritual Brandreths, his rattling skeleton should take on sinews and muscles, and he instantly become plump and ruddy. Not only must disease flee away before their all- healing art; but dishonesty and crime could not escape their spirit eye. Farewell, ye Old School Quacks! Doctors, Law- yers and Judges!- your crafts are gone! Scepticism would vanish now. The destiny of America, of the world, was fixed. The extension of the "area'^ of Spiritualism, with its cognate sovereignty of "woman's rights," was hastening to embrace the circumference of earth and "Spheres." But to return to the "circle." The evening found them in   ;1'{     POLLIE5  OP  TILE XIXTI   CETURy    161 conclave at the appointed moment. "Spiritualism as now -   in full blast, and the room           -was now in full blas, and the room was crowded long before the appointed hour, with an excited and anxious audience; among whom were many previous absentees. The occurrences of the preceding night were recounted in order. Graphic was the description, un. bounded their regrets on account of absence.

A writing spirit told me so this day. I am convinced that the 'manifestation ' I got last night was a warning against our being any further imposed upon by the rappers.' They are nothing more nor less than a gang of impostors. Their cun- ning cheats are calculated to bring us into disrespect. I, therefore, order this circle to receive no more 'rapping commu- nications' from either of the Spheres, since the prime spirit which has been our general agent turns out to be none other than-the Great Lying Lucifer himself, who will drum up all the ' thumpers' he can to impose upon us, and sink our cause in disgrace. Therefore, I pronounce this the 'Grand National Circle,' henceforth organized for writing Mediums alone, as a safeguard against all deceptions in future." "Should any of the bottom sphere' liars intrude upon us, we will hear their 'communications,' but treat or interpret them as we please. Such are my orders.

With a tremendous flourish of enthusiasm, this injunction was instantly obeyed, the master of ceremonies watching foi the indications of spiritual presence. Presently a number of Mediums began to nod, particularly the females mentioned the previous evening. After sundry manifestations by the lecturer, in obedience to orders, they 'let go hands,' and he put the question: c Are there any spirits present " A sudden and terrific " rapping." "Silence!" shouted the master, and all was still. "Are there any spirits present from the lowest Sphere?"   FOLLIEs OF THE XIXTH CENTURY. 163 Three raps. "Do you wish to communicate?" No reply. "Do you wish to write?" inquired he, furnishing pencil and "signal, book."        , Still no answer, but a Medium, with mouth wide open, thrust forth his tongue at full length. "Does that spirit wish to communicate?" asked the lec- turer, with evident amazement. "If no, make it manifest." "Yes," clearly articulated the Medium. The circle gazed at each other, dumb-founded at this new phenomena. "The lecturer, at length recovering himself, congratulated them on thus having made the important discovery of a talk. ing Mbedum, and expatiated largely upon the rapid progress of their darling cause, the flourishing condition of the "circle," and the certainty that according to the present ratio of develop- ment, the period was not far distant when spirits would stand before, them, face to face, in visible 'manifestations.'" Meanwhile the new "Medium" shook with involuntary spasms, especially in the region of the maxillary muscles, ob- serving which, the lecturer, amid the highest pitch of excite- ment, said, that, as the spirit was so extremely importunate, he would at once receive the communication, and demanded: "Are you happy?" \ I7   {I Yes"sir-ee," shouted the Medium at the top of his voice.

It was granted oin all hands that they had hitherto been hood- winked and bamboozled by a "lying ' spirit.. But the dark imposition had vanished before the new demonstration. They could now talk with the shades, and in their sanguineness of yet being able to see them, some imagined they already caught a glimpse of their shadows.                  f Joy flowed full, purse-strings generously relaxed, and " pass- ing the hat," to pay the Professor of Ghostology for his dis- tinguished services, the circle, in its spherical capacity, dis- solved, but tarried in promiscuous intercourse till a late hour.

M  EANWHLE these " spiritual demonstrations" were in progress, our village editor, whose acquaintance the reader has already made, had issued a number of the National Bulletin, which however did not satisfy the eager curiosity of that reading people. The previous issue was full of interest, because it was full of news. The following is an extract from his "leader :"- "During our absence last week, a statement found its way into our columns which threw the community into a high state of excitement. ' Were it not for the fact that, without an explanation,.we should be held up to public ridicule by our brother editors, we should maintain a prudent silence. Respect for ourself, how- ever, requires us to correct the error. It is sufficient to say, we were necessarily absent, and in the interim our conjugal partner having assumed the chair editorial, is the sole and re- sponsible proprietor of the consequent excitement. "The circumstance, however, affords a theme for dissertation. (165)    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6456-00000090"/> 166          Lucy BOSTON. "We may be called conservative, antiquated, ' old fogyish;' nevertheless, we must be allowed to express our opinion freely in relation to the so-called reforms and progressive develop- ments of the age. The two superlative prodigies of these 'latter days,' and both virgin born,* are Woman's Rights and Spiritualism -   the North American Twins, begotten without sire, and hence the progeny of miraculous conception! Although ushered into this inhospitable world in their paternal orphanage, fortunately for them, they are not motherless.  More lucky than their an- cient prototypes of Roman fame,t which parentless, friendless, and outcast, were adopted and nursed by a philanthropic ma- tronly wolf, the foster-mother of future empire! these sireless foundlings, lying at the exuberant paps of maternal care and affection, are waxing lusty, the fancied founders, in embryo, of a dominion wider than the world, more lasting than time. But whatever may be the cherished hopes of the New Lights, alias the Spiritual Reformers, we cannot withhold our convic- tion that these hopeful bantlings of theirs, although heirs ex- pectant to the throne of universal sway, are but the incipient manifestations' of two mis-shaped boobies, the idols, indeed, of motherly pride and vanity, but doomed to be the laughing- stock of the world. True, they are blessed with a goodly number of beardless and some full bearded god-fathers, * It is notorious that the "woman's rights" scheme sprung from the ambitious brains of certain maiden ladies, and Spirit Rappings from the Misses Fox of Rochester. t History records that Romulus and Remus, the twin brothers and founders of ancient Rome, left orphans in their infancy, were confided to the care of their uncle, who, from motives of ambition, exposed them to perish; but a she wolf came and nourished them with her milk, till a shephard found and adopted them.

Their (manifest destiny' is to be lugged and trundled about, a con- stant burden to their mothers and the objects of wonder and disgust to the gazing public, who will feel a gratifying relief to see them rolled together into a timely grave." This last announcement blew the flame of public excitement into a still broader blaze. The office of the editor was thronged from village and country. Especially was he beset by the more curious and inquisitive part of the human family, in a manner that fully tested his patience. He bore the infliction, however, with the composure of a philosopher, wisely consol- ing himself, by way of indemnity for his martyrdom, with the consideration that he was reaping laurels as the hero of good-naturedness, while his fiery ' leader" would greatly ex- tend the circulation of the National Bulletin. True, his expo- sition of the "New Lights," though received as sterling coin by his subscribers, was repudiated with disdain as base metal by his woman readers. But as a set-off to this, his independ- ent, liberty-loving wife could steal a march upon him now and then, into the editorial "columln," and deal blow for blow, making reprisals with interest for the spoliations committed upon her sex. So by this alliance, offensive and defensive, the National Bulletin. not only attained its original domain, but in the march of conquest, conquered the annexation of new and extensive territory. Amaziah, in the ease and freedom of oneness, was something of a "gentleman about town," in part, because he had nothing to do, but more from the fact, that he had no disposi-  <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6456-00000091"/> FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH CENTURY. 169   tion to do it. He had, however, been something of an ob- server of passing events-had contemplated to the extent of his ability, in its various bearings, the foretold revolution and reversal of the order of things. True to his calling, as an im- pressible Medium, he remained an adherent believer, in the prediction of what was shortly coming to pass, yet still dis- covering many things which must have shaken his faith in woman's capacity to govern, had his belief been founded on human evidence. But leaving our bachelor to ruminate upon his "day dreams and night visions," in conformity with the popular art of historiography- which requires the incorpora- tion of every collateral, if not contemporaneous incident, how- ever slight its importance, or doubtful its connection - we will pick up the boarding-house news, resuming the narrative where we dropped it. Miss Hager, like Amaziah, enjoyed the freedom of simple oneness, but dissimilar to him, she had much to do, and withal the disposition to do it. In pursuing her handicraft at the boarding-house, unfortunately, her experience proved that sometimes mistakes as well as misfortunes do not "come single," for as her ill star would have it, she committed a blunder in fabricating the memorable new silk dress. The mishap, though insignificant and harmless, was nevertheless sufficient to throw its owner into a most violent it.   "Mad as the vexed sea."   Mrs. Wilson felt driven to free her mind, and like a real Diana discharged the arrows of her innuendoes, till her quiver was emptied, but pointless and harmless, they fell upon the   buckler of the old maid's silence. Provokingly cool, she sat plying scissors and needle, ever and anon looking up implor- ingly, as much as to say: "O don't, Mrs. Wilson." Such provoking coolness was more than the random onset of our landlady's impetuosity could withstand, and she was on the point of calling her husband as a reinforcement, when chanc- ing to over-hear the din, he entered, not as auxiliary, but me- diator, exclaiming with great good nature- "What's up, my duck?" "Don't you think," was the supplicating reply-- "my new dress is spilte - and Badger, H wish, my soul, you'd order him out of the house." "Well, wife, 'tis rather bad, I declare," said Wilson, in a half bantering manner. '"But after all, what signifies it? Why take on about what you are going to take right off again? Woman's Rights and breeches, not gowns, are the latest styles, you know." This sunshine was but a "weather-breeder." Wilson saw the cloud blacken--felt the lightning flash in his face -the thunder crack in his ear. The storm-cloud was bursting on his head, as he sought timely shelter, in a sudden turn of the subject.  "But what has she done to your dress, my dear?" asked he, appeasingly. What's she done? Completely ruined it -ruined it. And Badger's the cause of it. The quicker we'ship' him, the better." "Perhaps it can be fixed--if it can't, you shall have   <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6456-00000092"/> 170        LUCY    BOSTON. another as good- if not better --so cheer up, dovey. Re- formers shtould always keep the upper hand of themselves." The tempest lulled, but lowered, as she abruptly withdrew to her private apartment. The mantua-maker continued intently engaged upon the ill- fated garment "Don't be frightened, Miss Hager," said Wilson, pleasantly, "if I play the hen-huzzy a little. We husbands have to do it sometimes, you know. What seems to be the trouble with the new gown?  Don't it fit, or don't it suit? Which? You havn't cut it wrong, have you?" C Why no, Mr. Wilson. I've only made a little mistake in putting it together. - I will have it all done in an hour, and warrant it to set as nice as a pin. You know, Mr. Wilson, what troubles I've had since I came here. Its enough to make any poor girl crazy, to think of it. And now Mrs. Wilson declares she will tell everybody that I have been trying' to court Mr. Badger, when I never spoke a single word with him in my life. I think its too much to bear," said she, her voice tremulous with emotion and eyes filling with tears.- "O, that's all, is it? Not half so bad as itrmight be. I'll set all the bones it breaks. You finish the dress and trust me for the rest," said he blandly, leaving the room. He sought and found his wife before the glass giving the finishing flourish to her toilet, which always constituted Wil- son's domestic thermometer. He saw at a glance the degree of temperature. Her hair-the ends, as if in electrical repul- sion, looking porcupinish--had a portentous twist and her   FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH   CENTURY. 171 comb a peculiar cant, indicating the mercury raised plump up to the boiling point. "Pretty fix I'm left in - the huzzy, just as I expected"-- cried she nervously, thrusting the last skewer into her top-knot. "Well, I wouldn't borrow trouble about it, I guess. What's the use of borrowing what you don't want when you get it?" said he sagely. "Old Badger is at the bottom of it- and--" "Bottom or top, my dear, I really can't divine what he can possibly have to do with it. Now, one question, dovey. Aint you a lit-- the too- fast?" Fast or slow, little or much, the quicker he's Cshipped' the better. We've seen enough of him. Do you know -he's got a whole lot o' books and papers in his room, and porin over 'em- all the while? I've seen 'em. They tell about spirits and woman's rights, besides other things - I didn't know ex- actly what it was, but I s'pose 'twas some big doctor's words or other. I don't think that looks well for an old bachelor, es- peeially -- Do you?" {"I don't see any thing so very bad about it. If he chooses to study the sciences, why let him. Its his privilege and we shouldn't interfere with it." It I don't think its any of his business, any way, and we can't get rid of him  too soon, before he makes any more trouble. That's my mind." C May be he's studying for a doctor. Who knows? Then we can have a physician in the family. Wouldn't that be handy though?" said Wilson roguishly.    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6456-00000093"/> 172        LUCY BOSTON.           ' "And her brow cleared;but not her troubled eye; - The wind was downs but still the sea ran high."/'.! As it happened, the mail had just brought friend Badger various fresh publications on the subject of " woman's rights,'  and among them the petition adopted at the Great Convention, '- accompanied with a request that he would circulate it; also that a meeting be called, the subject explained, and the people aroused to the importance of the matter. How his address  was obtained, or why he was selected as a leader in the new  movement, was beyond his comprehension; but as the respon-  sibility was laid upon him, and possibly feeling a little flattered :i by the distinction of being raised to the dignity of a public re-  formner he resolved promptly to discharge his official duty. With : the formidable array of documents in his hands he was de- scending the stairs, to lay them before the consideration of his   landlady, just as she and her husband issued into the hall, and !  approaching her with an air of great deference, said:' "Mrs. Wilson, I have got a petition to circulate, which I'd like to have you take and get as many names as possible. You - head it, and  " ?iii You needn't come to me with any of your doctor's papers. , Give 'em to Miss Hager, she'll take 'em. I'll thank you to    : move your quarters, sir.

You want freedom, don't you, Mrs. Wilson? , I understand it. You want us to sign away what little liberty we've got left.

So keep your old papers and clear out," and away she whirled to the kitchen. "What's in the wind this morning, Wilson?" asked the petitioner, dumbstruck. "O, the new dress don't fit, or some dev'lish thing or other." "Has'nt she got another 'fit '2 "  "Yes, a regular fit- and the hardest kind." At this, Badger started without preliminary, and in great haste for his pills, thinking it a fit opportunity to test their efficacy. He took five boxes, and descended to the kitchen. Finding his patient raving at Dinah (considerate wench, who bore it kindly), and the evident symptoms of the case indica- ting the necessity of instant relief, he handed them to her, saying, "Take six now, and the remainder in two hours." Upon opening the box, instead of following the prescription, she let fly the whole into his face, and suiting the word to the action, exclaimed, "You old fool! I didn't sign your paper. I see your trick. You wanted me to subscribe for pills - but I didn't, you " "No, no, Mrs. Wilson -these is the great 'sovereign rem- edy for fits.! Just take 'em. They are sure cure. I bought 'em on purpose for you."  At that instant, Miss Hager called for Mrs. Wilson. "What d'you want," answered she, waspishly. "Will you please to come up and try on the dress? Its ready now." 15* X     t          ' ,'*.    <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6456-00000094"/> 174        LucY  BOSTON.               . '0 yes," said Badger, "rId like real well to see it. Its the prettiest pattern I ever saw."  Though at first unyielding, Wilson making his appearance,  she was at length persuaded. They ascended, followed by the  , new pill doctor.  Badger--at whose entrance Miss Hager looked the picture   ^ of surprise--taking up the notable garment, as it lay across the back of a chair, and holding it off at arm's length, exhausted his vocabulary in a strain of admiration - and finally remark- ing, that if it was not "a fit," he would be glad to take it off her hands, seeing the period was so near when he should have occasion to use it. Mrs. W--- resigning herself into the hands of her man- tua-maker, in a trice, she came forth the most buxom-looking creature that silk and cotton could make her.         i "Mr. Wilson" and "Mr. Badger," duly presented, went into ecstacies over the embodiment of their "beau ideal," as she wheeled from right to left and left to right, in review be- fore them. Even Mrs. Wilson, conscious of being the "observed of all observers," and seeing her own image in the mirror, was vainly proud that nature and the mantua-maker had cast her in a mould of such faultless proportions.  The fit was over. Miss Hager was now the model dress- maker, and "Doctor Badger" (as she was pleased to call him) was at once reinstalled in the good graces of his landlady, and he "must not leave on any consideration." In the course of the afternoon Mrs. Wilson appeared on grand parade, equipped with new dress, chemisette, bracelet, &amp;o., in the most cheerful mood imaginable. Anong other -        ?t   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH CENTURY. 175 particular friends, she honored the Doctor with a call (not an unusual occurrence by the way), and standing before him in the most graceful, winning attitude, said with a playful smile, "Mr. Badger, don't you wish I was a widow?" "I don't know as I wish you was a widow; but I wouldn't care if I was Mr. Wilson." "I think this makes up real pretty. I don't believe there'll be a single dress in church to-morrow, that'll beat it." ' You are certainly dressed in first-rate taste, Mrs. Wilson; but how long d'you s'pose it will be before the women will put our clothes on?" "What! wear coats and trowsers?" "Certainly." "O I'd just as leave do that as any thing, if it was only the fashion." "But wouldn't you like to have it the fashion 7" "Yes, I would for a spell, just to see how it would seem." "And how would it suit you for the women to have the power, as men do now-make the laws, govern the Church and the State, carry the money, and all such things?" "First-rate. I'd give any thing for that." ' WXell, Mrs. Wilson, believe me, that is going to be so, very soon too -you may depend upon it." "What makes you think so, Mr. Badger?" "Well, if you won't tell anybody, I'll tell you." "Well,-I promise you I won't. I'll be sure and keep it a real secret."

"How glad I  am to get you enlisted, Mrs. Wilson. Now you take the petition and obtain all the signatures you can of both sexes.

"I am a woman! nay, a woman wrong'd."          ^ ISS BOSTON, on her return, found the public mind pretty thoroughlyr inoculated with the mania of Spiritualism and " woman's rights." Numerous " circles" had been instituted, and what were claimed as genuine communications received through a rapping Medium.  But palpable failures not infrequently occurred in securing " demonstrations," and those obtained bore something of a suspicious cast; still the believers maintained remarkable courage, and were unanimous in promising ultimate female ascendency. One "manifestation" in particular, more marked than the rest, furnished food for their marvelous appetite. The spiritual nerves of the " circle,' strung around the table in the greatest tension of anxiety, a female, by the direction (as she said) and the inspiration of a whole Sphere of Spirits, breaking forth, in an allegro-spiritoso movement, sung, as if pouring out the very soul of melody- "Fol, de, rol, 'ol, de, rol, FPol, lol, de, rol."

FOLI This exquisitely spiritual sextain, out-rivaling the ravishing strains of the dying swan, was repeated with various modula- tions, meanwhile for accompaniment, the performer rapping a splendid spiritual " rub-a-dub," with her knuckles on the table. The   circle," almost swooning with admiration, eagerly inquired the name of the magnificent cantata. With a fairy- like air she replied, " The Angel's Grand Waltz." Jupiter! Apollo ! What uninspired mortal would ever have thought of that? But then if the gods are musicians, why certainly the angels may dance. This surely is something new under the sun. Just imagine, reader (if your fancy is suffi- ciently ethereal), imagine yourself in the great spiritual ball- room, in the midst of a spree. Phoebus, the Divine Fiddler in the " box," with his spiritual fiddle, and the shades big and little, of both sexes, black, white and red, touching the "i light fantastic toe" to the scraping of spiritual rosin, horse-hair and cat-gut! What French fours, and Scotch reels, and Irish jigs, and Spanish fandangos, and Indian pow-wows, and Dutch fuddles, and Yankee gallopades, and Fanny Ellsler polkas, and Wirginny breakdowns in the grand " promenade all," of the spiritual cotillion ! Our singing Medium sought earnestly to be re-inspired, but the Muses were mute. Either they were indisposed, or the fountain of song was exhausted. IHowever, the " circle" en- tertained hope that the musical spirits would again appear. Miss Boston was advertised of all that had happened during her absence.  Great anxiety prevailed to find the lecturer, whose name was on every tongue: though often interrogated as to her knowledge of his locality, Lucy, for the most part,     FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH CENTURY. 181 she kept her own counsels. To one or two only of her most intelligent and intimate friends, she opened her mind freely in relation to the spirit with which she was so anxious to hold correspondence, and declared it to be of little use to send for the lecturer, since just as good Mediums might be found there as elsewhere. She had pressing invitations to meet with the circles, but declined from prudential, or some other motives. As yet, Miss Boston had taken no measures to discover the person chosen as the Medium of the spirit of the Mermaid. The best course to pursue  that was the question. She had the impression that he resided somewhere in central New York. Believing herself able to recognize him in a public meeting, even,her first thought was to go into every town, large and small, lecturing on "woman's rights," in the hope of acciden- tally falling in with him at some point in her wanderings. But this method was attended with great uncertainty. The idea occurred to her, to advertise for his discovery. But how ? For the "person who had seen the spirit of the Mermaid ?"  That would not do. She blamed herself exceedingly for not having learned his name, or at least his place of residence. No feasible method presenting itself, she at length came to the conclusion that her chances of success lay as much within thie "spheres" as the circumference of earth, for steam might have already carried the unknown Medium to California or to China, or he might have taken his departure to the Spirit- Land. She therefore adopted the bold plan of seeking the spirit of the Mermaid in person. Accordingly, retiring to her chamber, she assumed almost every possible attitude at every hour of the 16   <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6456-00000098"/> 182        Lucy BoSTON. day and night, mentally and orally invoking its presence, but with no avail. Her ingenuity and perseverance, though prompted by the purest motive, were not repaid with the least -sign of a " manifestation," not even the ambiguity of a dream, and she nearly abandoned the hope of securing a spiritual alli- ance in the consummation of " woman's rights." Invitations were almost daily pressed upon her, from various quarters, to address public meetings on the great topic of reform, but they had all been declined. As the political elements were begin- ning to be agitated in view of the forthcoming election, and candidates, as servants of the people (?) were offering their disinterested services, she concluded there was no time to be lost in vindicating the rights of her sex and elevating their "Iong-deferred" claims before the masses.  :   --  She therefore arranged and published a list of appointments, when she would address the citizens of different places on the question of "' government reform." The series of the pro- gramme carried her down to the eve of election. It was stated, however, in connection with the notice, that should any thing occur to prevent the fulfillment of her engagements, due : notice thereof would be given. With a lofty purpose and a brave heart, she entered upon   the campaign. The above-mentioned advertisement happened    to fall under the eye of Doctor Badger, and observing that the celebrated lecturer was to address the citizens of U --- , which being the nearest point to his residence she would touch, he resolved to attend the meeting. Petitions were numerous, the press grew less rampant in its opposition, converts multiplied, and the work went gallantly on.   l0'oLIt s   O 't11e  XIXTn  C  .NTTP Y. 183 The Doctor and his 'coadjutor, Mrs. Wilson, were indefati- gable, but -they had as yet called together no public assemblage) principally for the want of a speaker,  The merits of tShe new reform appeared not to be very thoroughly understood in that loeality, yet there was enough of novelty and fan in it to in. crease the list of petitioners to an indefinite length. The vilB lage editor stood up 'a vigorous opponent, but his stronger half" was as vehement an advocate of the cause. Wilson, too, belonged to the enemy, but not df the 'd rank and file." Choos- ing the guerrilta mode -of warfare, no one could leave a spot rexposed as big -as a bullet, without feeling his s sharp shots,?' but treating his hapless victims with such superabundance of good nature, they were quite indifferent if not insensible to their .wounds. His chief delight was not in killing or wound- ing, but in Aittting he Brar'l. Mr. Badger, in company with his hostess-now a leading spirit in the reform --set out to attend the convention, her husband dryly remarking, as they departed, "I hope, my dear, you will take good care of the Doctor while you are gone." Reaching, U  -  , towards evening of the same day, they ' booked" themselves at the "C Central."  Mrs. Wilson had but vague conceptions of city life. Although U-l-  was far from being the metropolis of the state, yet it was in won- derful contrast with her provincial ideas and habits. The evening on their hands, Doctor Badger escorted his landlady through the principal streets, to " see the place." Her gal- lant companion must have felt that she was beginning already to avail herself of her " inalienable rights," as she compelled    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6456-00000099"/> 184       ILucy BosTOV, him to halt at almost every Step to admire and explain. the wonders which under the brilliancy of gas-light appeared to grow more and more wondrous at'each successive window. Among other objects in their peregrinations and sight-seeing, they came in contact with a mantua-maker's sign, or in techni- cal phrase a "form."  Badger was inclined to hasten bycir-  cumstances causing the sight of it to produce within him pain- K ful sensations. Mrs. W---- observed his impatience. Her curiosity excited to know the cause, and after the fashion of the sex, unwilling to leave without a few "h last words," O0 do see there!" said she; " that is exactly like one Miss Jones had, and a crazy fellow knocked it down in the dirt one I day and threw a pail of water all over it, and they had a great, time. Don't you remember it?                 i "Mrs. Wilson, hadn't we better be getting along?" said he, in an urgent tone. "We shan't get round to-night, if we stop to see everything."'  "Didn't you hear of that though? I thought everybody    a knew it."                 - ' How did you get your information, Mrs. Wilson?      ! l ' Miss Hager told me. She happened to be to work there  at the time. Oh! how scar't she was. She never----"  "Yes, I believe I did know something about it. Hadn't we better cross over here and go up the other side," said he, interrupting. Her questions were multifarious as a woman's tongue could make them, in relation to the objects that met their gaze on every hand. A tide of people, of all ages, sexes, and conditions, was continually passing to and fro. She wondered where such a ' sight of folks" could come from, and   FOLLIES   OP  THE  XIXTH     CENTURY. 185 where they were going. Every one they met, that struck her as in any way peculiar, she would give his arm a twitch and ask if he knew " who that" was.  With an indefinite number of crossings and re-crossings, haltings and startings, and turn- ings and windings, the sight-seers found themselves at their lodgings again. Mrs. W-- rested but little during the night, because, to use her own phrase, " there was such a raft of folks coming and going all the time," and she "kept getting up to see who they were."  But exhausted nature must be restored, and she slept soundly in the morning.             ! It was time to "ring up"   the sleepers.  The gong set up its deafening roar through the halls, and came thundering along by our landlady's door. In an instant, though but half awake,. she was on her feet. Such a noise! She had never heard the like before. It had passed to the further end of the hall, and was returning with redoubled terror, when in her night regalia, the picture of fright, she threw open the door and screamed- "For mercy sake, what is the matter? Is the house afire? ' Tis a fire bell - O, dear I what shall I do? I can never find way down." 'This is the  first ring, ma'am," said the waiter laughing. "We ring again for breakfast." Mrs. W----'s panic was allayed, yet she was at a    loss to know what it was that made such a dreadful noise. Let no one make sport of the poor woman, for who that ever heard a  gong for the first time, but felt his hair rise on end and his flesh crawl, at the terrific yell. At an early hour began the surrounding country, to pour into 16*  .             <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6456-00000100"/> 186        LUTCY  BOSTON.  the city, in its accustomed manner. The morning stages, well laden, arrived from various directions. Mrs. W--- supposed they were all coming to attend the convention, Doctor Badger and his companion repairing to the public hall, in advance of the hour, found but a few persons present. Miss Boston had arrived in town. A number of " strong- minded" women and one or two (weak-minded) men attended her. They entered the hall in company, and occupied the platform. The edifice was respectably filled; the audience a miscellaneous one. In front of the stand sat the reporters of the several dailies," with pen in hand, ready to chronicle the "demonstration" so potent in its bearing upon the desti- nies of man. One of the ladies, whose name was announced, opened the  meeting by a short speech, at the close of which she introduced Miss Boston to the audience. Our heroine, amid applause - her naturally dignified person, made even more majestic by her rich costume, new in material but not in style--delivered a lengthy and powerful address,  I in which she contended-                    I First. "That woman had been and was enslaved." Secondly. "That she could if she would, be free." and Thirdly. V, She followed with some pertinent and forcible re. marks, in substance that a mighty effort was being made- that the world was moving--old foundations were breaking up--a new and better-balanced system was forming--she felt confident that the next Legislature would show a majority in favor of " woman's rights," and urged her sex to "cut" the society of those who refused their co-operation. She   FOLLIES   Of THE XIXTH      CENTURY.  187 hoped the sacred name of woman would no longer be disgraced -or rather that she would cease to disgrace herself, by truck- ling to the arrogated power of her master--and concluded by affirming that she had a divine conviction of the truth and justice and success of their cause--that a supernatural revelation, she had the best reason to believe, had been made, and of which she hoped and prayed they might receive the benefit, before the die should be cast at the Ides of November. The address was listened to with great attention, and pro- duced an unexpected sensation. The gravity of the speaker and earnestness of her manner impressed every one with the truth of her sincerity and confidence of speedy triumph. Miss B -- 's closing sentence made a special impression on the mind of the revelatdr of the Mermaid. Satisfied that the allusion was to none other than himself, his pride was elevated, and he felt an itching to make known his identity, but whether to seek a renewal of acquaintance was a query. His feelings prompted him to go forward and introduce himself, but a tremb- ling timidity held him back. Lucy having resumed her seat, a reverend gentleman fol- lowed with some cogent remarks, in support of the previous address, in the course of which, he alluded to the spiritual manifestations and prophecies, all leading, he said, 'to the con- viction that "woman's rights" must prevail. Badger deeply intent upon hearing and understanding every word, kept his eyes fixed upon the speaker, with the gaze of motionless abstraction. Miss B---  was observed to leave the platform. Her eye had caught and recognized her quondam ac- quaintance of Mermaid memory.

Soon the revelator might disappear in the crowd. It was- her care not to lose trace of him again, and gliding noiselessly down the aisle she was quickly at his side, but unobserved by him, so lost was he in attention to the speaker. Her finger rested lightly on his shoulder, yet he was insensible to the touch, when Mrs. W  --,who had the happy capacity of see- ing everything, whispered in his ear- "Miss Boston's hand is on your shoulder." Brought to his senses by this announcement, he sprang in- voluntary to his feet, almost as much surprised as when he saw the Mermaid. iAt what house do you stop, sir," inquired Miss B-- ; in a suppressed tone.             e "The c Central,' " he replied, in a loud whisper. "I will see you at your room, immediately after the adjourri- ment," said she, and returned to the platform. The Doctor settled back into his seat with an air of pride, bordering on  I pomposity, at this public distinction paid to him by the illus- trious lecturer. The movement, though observed, attracted but the momentary attention of the audience. Several individuals followed in brief remarks, committees were appointed to circulate petitions, and the convention closed. Miss Boston, punctual to appointment, found Amaziah await- ing her arrival, took his hand with almost a masculine grip, and expressed her great joy at meeting him so opportunely. "The privilege to ask questions being one. of woman's rights, allow me to enquire your name, sir," said she.    ,,At   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH        CENTURY. 189 "Amaziah Badger.

It is impossible for me to express the anxiety I have had to see you-and great is my good fortune in this unexpected interview. Providence first threw us into contact, and Providence has led us hither for a merciful and benevolent purpose, I cannot doubt. But have you again seen the spirit of the Mermaid'?" "I have not, ma'am." "Have you ever received ' manifestations' from any other spirits?" "I have not, ma'am." "Have you ever attended a spirit meeting?" "I never have, but I'd like to, though." "Is it possible, Mr. Badger, that you have never met with a 'circle;' and is there none in your village?" i  "No, I never saw any such thing in my life. There aint any at our place." Lucy was struck with astonishment at the mystery, for such she regarded it, and this entirely convinced her that the spirits came of their own accord, and not by enticement, neither by persuasion nor force.         / "Mr. Badger, asked she, with an'xiety, " do you not know, or can you not devise some means by which to obtain one more interview with the spirit of the Mermaid?" J "Idon't know of any thing, Miss Boston.  I havn't any reason to expect I shall ever see it again."

This he said, not sensible of his being made the Medium of spiritual communication in furtherance of the great reform. "Have you any objection to making this revelation known to the world?" "I- don't know as I have, but it wouldn't do any good. The thing is settled, Miss Boston. You are going to conquer. I know it just as well as can be. I don't believe there is six men in our whole town opposed to us, and if you could only hold a convention there we'd have 'em all." "Is it known there, Mr. Badger, that you have received this revelation?"  "No-I neverlisped it to anybody but you and Mrs. Wilson." "If I could only have an interview with that spirit, what a  : boon it would be to the world. Do- you follow the directions it gave you, sir?"  "Certainly I do. I havn't any wish not to." "Suppose you should take grounds against us, do you think it would make its appearance to you again?" "I don't know, I'm sure. But I can't take ground against you. I shouldn't know how, if I wanted to."           C "What, if you should declare that it was all a, dream, and i  that you will not be satisfied without another 'manifestation?' Would she not return to deliver you from unbelief?" "I know it wasn't a dream.

"I think our prospects are very good, but vigilance is the price of success." i Do you meet with much opposition?" "O yes, like all reformers, we are talked against and ridi- culed by certain classes, in speech and through the press. But the political papers dare not oppose us directly, neither have they courage, honesty, nor the justice to come out boldly in our favor. They are the organs of their respective parties, and their parties do they serve, alike unheeding the cries of the oppressed and the voice of God. But the principal opposition we have to meet is from a class of independent sheets.

Ad Every body'll know they are only pokin fun at us." ' Very true, Mr. Badger, but I had much rather take the field in opposition to sober reason than burlesque, at any time. The blows of argument we can meet and parry, but against the shafts of ridicule and derision we have no defense. They are sure to pierce through the 'joints of the harness' somewhere." "But if we are only sober and sincere, every body will know that we are on the right side, instead of those who are all the while laughing and making sport." ' Reason and Ridicule, Mr. Badger, are two mighty leaders -- the latter more formidable than the former-in strife for: the mastery among mankind, in the gross of human nature. It is sodin the nature of things. While Reason takes now and then  a solitary prisoner, Ridicule will draw off whole squadrons of deserters. Hence are we obliged to contend at great odds; yet I believe we are destined to conquer, notwithstanding." "{So do I believe so.

"Most gladly would I go, Mr. Badger, if you could secure me an introduction to the spirit of the Merimaid?' "As to that, I can't exactly promise," said he. Well, Mr. Badger, I am exceedingly happy in receiving so good an account of our prospects in your, section. If you will now accompany me to my hotel, I will make you acquainted   FOLLIES OP    THE  XICTH    CENTURY. 193 with my comrades, who will be glad to hear from your own lips a description of your interview with the spirit."

Why he should decline the honor of appearing in public with his distinguished visitor, and in his eyes the noblest champion of the cause he had espoused - whether the reason lay primarily within himself, or more in the vicinity of his next door neighbor - we will not pretend to determine. Suffice it to say, Mrs. W -- knew to a secondfwhen her gallant was left alone, and at once put him to the torture of an inquisition as to the origin, subject, circumstances, and results of his being closeted with the bloomer, and why herself had been excused from the secrecy. The Doctor thought he discovered in her evident symptoms of a fit, and as she was on his hands, he began to deliberate upon the best mode of treatment. It was a delicate question to decide, whether the case required an internal or external application- that is to say, a dose of his "pills," or a new dress. 'Fortunately there was, from some cause, a sudden -change, and the paroxysm passed, much to the relief of the Doctor, as well as the patient. Miss Boston resorting to her associates, informed them, with evident agitation, that she had found the person who claimed to have seen the spirit of the Mermaid and received at her mouth the prophetic revelation of the certain and speedy triumph of the cause of " woman's rights;" that he had kindly consented to relate the whole matter to them, at his room, and 17 Sf    <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6456-00000104"/> 194        Lucy  BOSTON. knowing they would rejoice to avail themselves of the special favor, she had come to escort them thither. Her reverend coadjutor, Mr. Q--, listened in utter as- tonishment, then fixing his dark and piercing eye upon her, with withering look and manner, said, "Miss Boston, I always esteemed you as a lady of sense and a christian. If you are serious and know what you say, you are neither. What! You a believer in these latter-day impos- tors, these false prophets and lying spirits in league with the Devil, who shame decency and common sense, and set religion at defiance? No one but an idiot or an infidel can be guilty of such blasphemy.  The idiot is excusable--the infidel never." This hasty and severe, if not ill-tempered rebuke, fell like a thunderbolt upon Miss Boston. It was calling down fire from heaven to consume the heretic. The females composing the rest of her party were at once alive with curiosity and impatient to go and see the man. The reverend reformer, in a flame of holy indignation, or of hot dis- pleasure, said he was strongly in favor of 'woman's rights," but was ashamed of his present company--that he would travel with them no more, and left in disgust. They in turn were amazed at the conduct of the deserter. Lucy said it was only another proof of man's despotic nature -that she knew they were bound to succeed in fulfillment of the prophecy, and on the whole it was fortunate he had gone, since he could now have no claim upon them for any office, ap- pointment or mercy, when the happy day of their power should arrive.

Repairing to his quarters they found the revelator, and with him Mrs. Wilson, whose jealousy as well as curiosity was not a little excited. She could not imagine why. they should be paying so much attention to her beau, and determined, by sticking by, to know the whole story. The ceremonies of introduction ended; at the request of Miss B--, the revelator began and narrated, in detail, the account and prophecy of the Mermaid, at which his new listen- ers, were not only filled with amazement, but intoxicated with joy. They concluded, that if Mr. Badger could be engaged to journey with them and relate his experience, in connection with the lectures, it would put scepticism to the route and annihi- late all opposition. It was considered an expedient acquisition, as their ecclesiastical follower had apostatized and seceded from them, that some man should be adopted to fill his place as their valet and sort of body-guard. Mrs. Wilson, delighted with her new acquaintances and fellow laborers in the reform, beset them with great vehemence to accompany her home, because, as she said, ' Husband and I disagree, which will make it very unpleas- ant if he aint converted.

Upon what they deemed, mature deliberation, it was decided, on the grounds of expedi- ency, to abandon their published " bill," and follow the reve- lator and his hostess, in hope of seeing the " spirit;" at least, they could visit the holy chamber where it had appeared and prophesied --a circumstance, the relation of which would pro- duce great effect and make many converts.

It is almost impossible for the historian to- keep pace with the intelligence, improvements, and discoveries of this fast age. We set out with the benevolent design of giving to the world a narrative of facts, no less authentic and momentous than novel and mysterious. Already are we filled. with fear, lest many incidents'in the multitudinous rush escape the notice of our pen, and which almost makes us shrink from our pro- posed task, to save ourselves the reputation of an unfaithful chronicler. Nevertheless, what we do produce shall possess the substance, not the mask, of truthfulness, a quality of which many works of fiction cannot boast, among the countless publications of the day. Circumstances--.by the direction of the spirits, we may suppose--rendered it necessary for the lecturer to absent himself, at least for awhile. Great enquiry was made as to the cause of his sudden disappearance and the -place of his re- 17         *        (197)    <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6456-00000106"/> 198        Lucy   BOSTON. tirement; but as the occasion of his absence was veiled in doubt, so no trace of him could be obtained from either mortal or spirit. Rumor whispered that a spirit of envy or- jealousy appearing among the fairer members of the "circle,"'  was working a " manifestation" of the mysterious secret. It is worthy of notice that the lecturer displayed the singular sa- gacity to lay in store against a " rainy day," not only the full arrears of his wages, but a handsome sum in advance. Still the circle's confidence in him suffered no abatement, till on the heel of his departure it was announced that he was a mere babe in spirit-knowledge and power-that he did not understand the geography, nor the inhabitants and laws of the Spirit-Land, at all-that there were Ad spheres" of which he had never dream- ed; in short, he had never traversed even the surface of Spirit- ualism, much less ascended its heights and sounded its depths. It was also discovered for the first time that there were but four persons on earth whose capacities enabled them to pene- trate and unfold the mysteries of Spiritdom, and these ghostly Tetrachs were enthroned respectively in -the four quarters of the globe. There were, it is true, more or less inferior Me- diums through whom the lower order of shades would occa- sionally communicate things of trifling importance. The author of thiH thrilling intelligence, and the Great High Priest of Spiritualism, was there in the midst of them, and his name was and is Amos Funglehead.    To him was nothing unseen nor unknown. He held it a cardinal truth, that under the espionage of his spiritual police, no event es- caped his cognizance, neither was there any secret, however hidden, but he could spy it. If the reader is disposed to call   FOLLIES    OF THE XIXTH    CENTURY. 199 this in question, let the following instance of his infallibility banish every doubt. In a neighboring town a most diabolical murder was sup- posed to have been committed in the sudden and mysterious disappearance of a collector of taxes who was known to have had a large sum of money in his possession. - Amos, in spirit- vision) saw the corpse! and plunder! and bloody knife! He discovered the murderers, but refused to reveal their names, like a good and peaceful citizeln, unwilling to loose the blgod- hounds of vengeance; yet, yielding to the promptings of sym- pathy and the claims of humanity, he resolved to enlighten the world and relieve the friends of the murdered victim from a suspense more intolerable than a knowledge of the dreadful fact itself. Accordingly for the greater certainty, having sur- charged the battery of his telegraph, and set all the spiritual wires in operation, he put on his spiritual specs, when lo! he beheld thirteen objects, two of which were the body and the money-the former beneath a large stone-heap, the latter rolled up in a blanket, and the localities of which he definitely described. The question was thus settled. The sceptics must succomb now! The reality of Funglehead's inspiration could 1l   no longer be gainsayed. With the faith of assurance, a large party of the " circle" and their disciples, in solemn procession, preceded by the hearse, set out to disinter the body aid restore it to the mourning friends. Reaching the vicinity of the ap- pointed locality, one thing after another met their gaze, in ex- act accordance with the vision of Amos. At last the pile of stones was discovered. With slow and muffled tread they ap- proached the grave of the murdered tax-gatherer. How sad,    <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6456-00000107"/> 200        LUCY  BOST ON. how awful the scene! Every heart throbbed with emotion, and many an eye moistened with the tear of sympathy. The coroner ordered them to proceed. With sepulchral awe the stones were removed, and behold! the body was not there!! What could have become of it? Notwithstanding the solemnity with which the occasion was invested by the spiritists, there was not a little merriment among the " outsiders," at the expense of Funglehead and his followers, who had sweat in vain, in their work of removing the funeral a hard heads,"forthe purpose of furnishing a prac- tical (" demonstration " of Funglehead's divinity and the value to mankind, beyond conception, of his spiritual telegraph and spectacles. Though made the butt of sport and jeer by the unbelieving multitude, the zealots, instead of being disheartened, did but grow in faith and ardor. Martyr-like, they endured it with patience and fortitude, for the sake of the cause. Nor did their recent failure diminish their confidence in their High Priest. On the contrary, hope, "immortal in the human breast," only waxed the stronger, and they returned for the Seer to take another peep through his spiritual glasses. Amos was consulted without delay. -He insisted that his vision was clear, and for a time would not be persuaded that the search was thoroughly made. But his own most devoted disciples were the actors ofthe scene. Their hands lifted every stone, their eyes looked upon the spot. There was abso- lutely nothing there. Amos was forced to admit the fact, but declared his determination not to give it up. He would know where the body was.   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH       OENTXURBY.    201 Fortunately, he had discovered in the vicinity a large rock, to which the spirits had guided him, and whose particles were pervaded with spiritual electricity in the positive state. Fun- glehead himself was a?negative quantity; so by his sitting on the rock, thus bringing the magnetic poles into contact, a spirit- ual battery was formed, and in which all the telegraphic lines concentrated, like nerves of thought and beams of light, re- vealing to the optics of the Seer, everything within range of 'Earth and the Spheres,*   One would suppose that, being the a' Medium" of the action of such mighty forces, he must have experienced darting pains and convulsive gripes, but contrari- wise, his whole system, as he affirmed, thrilled with sensations infinitely pleasurable. This was truly a discovery, superior in marvel and utility to the "golden bough" of classic memory, which served its possessor as a passport to and from the Spirit- World. This rock was in shape, conical, and in texture, rough; but its surface, to the sensibilities of Funglehead's pantaloons, was smooth and soft as a cushion of velvet. In its exturnalappear- ance there was nothing peculiar to the natural eye. A geolo- gist of our vulgar system would have called it a granite " boul- der," but it belonged to a formation of the Upper Spheres, and had been transported hither by the spirits and christened"The Rock of Vision." For the safety of those who had not spirit optics in their head, Amos erected over it the inscription, in large black letters, * This does not militate against the theory of purely spiritual intercourse. In a&amp;. cordance with the law of "means to an end," this was their modus operandi.    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6456-00000108"/> 202        Lu cY  BOSTON. u Death to mhim that sitteth Lpon this rock-- thus sdith the spirits." In presence of the messengers bringing melancholy tidings of the corpsely alibi, Amos the Seer approached the "Rock of Vision."  Having calmly surveyed it, he waved his hand, laid aside his hat, drew off his boots (as they had nails in them which might attract the electric current from the brain to the heels), and said-- "Attend, ye spirits, while I ascend the Rock of Vision." Imme'diately mounting, he seated himself upon its apex, with his legs crossed, arms folded, and goggles adjusted with great precision astride his nose. In addition to its ot4er qualities, there oozed from this rock a spiritual cerate or ointment, which applied to Funglehead's glasses, not only cleared them of all impurities, but imparted to them the quality of clairvoyance. The spiritual chemicals now worked to a charm. The electro-magnetic rays shot through the tubes of his goggles, throwing into the camera ob- scura of his mortal vision a universal panorama of all realities. The rock and Amos together emitted a :blaze of phosphores- cence, attended by occasional reports of the electrical current. His disciples, overwhelmed with awe, gazed upon the spec- tacle in silence. "Hear ye, hear ye," cried the Seer, "I am going to look.! Be ye attentive and believing. The spirits command it!)" Each in obedience stood motionless and almost breathless. "( Be- hold, I see!"said Funglehead-"I see the stones ye removed. I see blood upon them now. Had ye gone where I directed ye, and done as I bid ye, ye would have found the body. Let   FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH    CENTURY. 203 this teach ye always to obey our commands. We never coun- cil ill. Ye never more can behold the body. It hath been consumed by fire. It hath been burned in the lime-kiln. Go ye on the last day of the week, at noon precisely, to the kiln and gather ye the ashes that lieth at the mouth thereof, to the measure of one bushel. Bring them to the "Rock of Vision," in a wooden vesseli Fail not." Thus spake Fuu!glehead the High Priest. The vision was ended, and his goggles were nought but vulgar glass and leather again. The body consumed! There was not a moment to be lost in conveying the nelancloly intelligence to the friends of the deceased. Wretches! fiends! -who thus could not only slay an inno- cent fellow-being, but, to, destroy the evidence of -their guilt, ruthlessly roast the corpse to ashes! But that could by no means prevent the detection. "Mur- der will out." The joy of the spiritists was full, for they had -now learned, to a certainty, the fate of the collector. Funglehead descended from his rock, much exhausted. The spiritual afflatus, with the effort it cost him to utter and accent the language of the Spheres, had severely taxed his nervous and muscular energies. News of the miraculous discovery spread through the com- munity with great velocity. The appointed day arrived to prove the veracity of the Seer, and the authenticity of Spirit- ualism. The disciples of Funglehead, the High Priest, assem- bling, en masse, proceeded to gather up the ashes of the dead, to be deposited in the urn of immortality. Winds shrieked,    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6456-00000109"/> 204        LUCY  BOSTON. floods poured, as if Nature herself was enraged at the diaboli- cal tragedy which had been enacted. But water could not dampen the courage -f the zealots, nor winds "' bluff 'em off." They reached the lime-kiln at the precise moment, when to their astonishmnent the same had not been "fired."  Still their confidence in Funglehead's spectacles did not wane, but waxed. One search more would reveal the victim, the infallibility of the Great High Priest would be established, and Spiritualism placed on a foundation as firm and lasting as the eternal hills. The kiln, it was observed, had been recently constructed, a circumstantial proof of great weight, that they stood by the sepulcher of the dead.- The groans of the disconsolate spirit saluted their ears, and every stone cried murder! Returning minus the ashes, they reported to the High Priest the result   i of their mission.  Funglehead maintained the singleness of his eyesight and the correctness of his glasses.' But the Rock of Vision, he said, had gathered dampness from the fog of the previous night, so swelling its particles, and closing its pores, as to pre: vent a free perspiring of the spiritual essence, which might possibly have occasioned the slight mistake. Indeed, he recol- lected his having noticed a blur upon his goggles at the time. But he assured his devotees that he would look again, in the night-time, as soon as the atmosphere should clear up, when he could retire alone in the stillness, with nought to distract his attention, and when the rock in a healthy state would yield its spiritual perspiration, to purify and perfect his optical organs. Then no mistake could happen, as his vision would be unob- structed by any earthly obstacle.   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH       CENTURY. 205 To his followers, this explanation was abundantly satisfactory, proving the profound sagacity of the great exponent and prop- agator of "Spiritualism.' It also showed how delicately exact, like the Daguerreian art, every item of the process must be, while it argued infinite shrewdness on the part of the spirits to protect the community against impostors. Funglehead awaited a favorable opportunity to sit, having promised to give definite information at an early day, as to the locality of the remains of the murdered man, and charged the "circle" to hold themselves in readiness for the search at a moment's warning. At length he announced his positive discovery of the body, minutely describing marks of violence upon it, and the wound that proved the fatal stab. It was, he said, in the lime-kiln, about the middle thereof, and which was soon to be "fired," and he commanded them to hasten, strong-handed and with all despatch to the rescue, not only of the butchered victim, but also of the honor of "Spiritualism."  Portentous moment! that was to save the spiritualists from defeat and 'retrieve their falling credit. Again without delay a large concourse joined in solemn pro- cession, proceeded to the kiln, when--horrible to behold! -- the same had been on fire for two days! Not the slightest doubt existed in the minds of the believers, but the kiln was thus early fired for the purpose .of consuming the body. Some were for putting out the fire, but the owner interposed the most strenuous remonstrance, which substantiated the fact be- yond a question, that Amos was correct, -and of course "Spir- itualism " was triumphant. 1.8    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6456-00000110"/> 206        LUCY  BOSTON. In the heat of their indignation at such cold-blooded butch. ery, it was proposed to tear down the kiln, but that was im- practicable, as the stones were red hot. Some thought if they only had some of the salve from the "Rock of Vision" to rub on their hands it would make them fire-proof. Others were confident that a small plaster of it applied to the surface of the kiln would draw out all the caloric and ;restore the stones to their natural state in ten minutes! However, neither of these suggestions were followed, but the " circle," joining hands around the burning pile, endeavored to call back the spirit of the deceased and obtain from it a 4 demonstration" of the whole. truth, to corroborate the'vision of Amos and en- rich their cause with glorious capital. But whether the shade of the tax-gatherer could not stand fire, or the smoke was suffocating, or whatever the cause, no matter, their conjurations were vain. The spirit refused to appear, even as a witness against the bloody assassins who drove it from its earthly habitation at the point of the dagger. Strange silence! and unaccountable, save on the supposition that the collector was bribed by the murderers to keep the secret; in other words, that he was himself an accomplice of the direful deed, both before and after the fact. This, it must be confessed, is the only reasonable solution of the unheard-of anomaly. Thus covered with repeated defeat, the "circle" "let go hands," to retreat in dismay, when a Medium --ycleped Z. Socrates Nozzleman (one of the old ones!), who had been sit- ting silently on a stone, a short distance apart--cried out, with sepulchral tone,   FOLLIES   OF THE  XIXTH   CENTURY. 207 "Fe - fi-- fo - fum. I smell the flesh of the murdered man, roasting in the lime kil-un." ' Shocking! horriblel! hellih!!!" exclaimed the Spiritu- alists; " did assassins ever before resort to such shifts to es- cape detection? But they were ferreted out at last. Though the -vision of Amos was a little imperfect, and caused him to see double, the spirits were not to be foiled. They had in- vested a member of the " circle" with a spiritual nose, doubt- less to be used in connection with Funglehead's spiritual eye. The new system was now perfected, for what Amos the Seer was unable to see, Z. Socrates Nozzleman, the smeller, would be able to smell!  A smelling Medium!! Truly this was a new "manifestation"--  progressive de- velopment -the highest incarnation of "Spiritualism."  The "circle" were in transports, when suddenly the smeller again exclaimed- "I smell that Funglehead doth not see straight. Place ye not too much reliance upon eyes, neither upon spectacles., The eyes are two, so are specs, therefore they are liable to see double, 'and that which is double, is deceitful- as double- dealer; but the nose, on the other hand (on the face, I mean), is one -therefore it always smelleth single, and that which is single is free from  deception-as single-heartedness. The nose, I say to ye, is the only sure Medium of communication with the Spirit-Land.  Give ye ear to my words. Believe ye not, at your peril. I say ye-a- -  oo ." He would have added something, but was prevented by a terrible fit of vomiting, occasioned by the nauseating odor es- I'    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6456-00000111"/> 208        LUCY   BOSTON. caping from the bowels of the lime-kiln. The High Priest of Spiritualism was superseded - the Funglehead Dynasty ended! It was impossible for the circle to resist the force of this new ' demonstration." "Is not his arguing true? Does not experience prove it?" reasoned they with each other. "For how many times have,    I our eyes deceived us, but our noses never! We may look at an object, but cannot always tell whether it is substance or shadow, reality or imagination. But what we smell we know is a matter of fact. That is to say, a person may be double- sighted, but he cannot be double-scented. Hence the admo- nition so often heard, g Believe not all you see ;"' but who was ever told to believe not what he smells? "And do not facts uphold the same," continued they. a The {visions' of Amos Funglehead the Seer are sufficient evidence. Thrice hath he assured us we should find the corpse as he saw  I and described it, and thrice have we proved him false. Brother Socrates hath once declared where it is--and see! his stomach hath hoven up the ' demonstration' of his actual' communica- tion' with the body. Who can doubt such testimony? Let Scepticism now grow pale and hide its rampant head?" Thus reasoned the spiritists. Z. Socrates Nozzleman was at once ensphered the central luminary in the spiritual firmament, and in whose brightness every other light was swallowed up or . shone but dimly. I he disciples of Funglehead crowded around their new      leader (who sat resting his head upon his hands), declaring the manifestation to be so powerful that it made them all a feel more or less qualmish."   FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH    CENTURY. 209S Elated by the enormous stride thus made in the science of spiritology, they decided to reorganize a smelling circle forth- with, and to reject all others as spurious and unreliable. Z. Socrates, at once, the true embodiment and great apostle of Spiritualism, overcome with retching, was removed to a car- riage, and still complaining of a deathly nausea, a "sister" of the circle very kindly sat by his side, plying him with fan and smelling bottle-spiritual ones!-we suppose. His stomach, though continuing " riled" for some time, at length became composed, and the mighty Smeller was himself again. All hope of recovering the remains of the deceased was now at an end. The fate of the collector was regarded as settled, by all except the "unbelievers." The story of his murder and the burning of the body as a holocaust to the Demon of Avarice, was added to the list of tragedies and given to the world as current history, when, wonderful to be told! he suddenly "turned up," not spiritually, but bodily, a living evidence of optical illusion and perverted smell. His return to his friends, as may well be imagined, changed their agony of suspense into overflowing joy. But consternation filled the Spiritualists. It was evident, they were either deceivers or deceived. Their "manifestations," so far from inspiring public confidence, were not only looked upon with suspicion, but treated with derision by an incredu- lous community. Especially the seeing and smelling Mediums were held in "bad odor."  "Spiritualism " was on the wane. The zealots were in sore extremity. They had met with signal discomfiture. A bold stroke must be made to wipe out the disgrace and revive their sinking credit. 18     <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6456-00000112"/> 210        Lucy BOSTON. Presently it was announced that the spirits had called a  mass-meeting of the Mediums to explain the mystery of what appeared to be either an honest mistake or wilful deception, and which by a perverse construction of their enemies was hazarding the interests, the existence even,of spiritology. The time and place of the proposed meeting were specified EL with great particularity. Punctual to the call, Believers and Infidels, a goodly num- ber were assembled, and prominent among whom was Amos     { Funglehead. "The spirits," said brother B-, have adopted a new method of 'manifestation' somewhat peculiar, but no  matter how they may communicate, it is all for the best. If they chooseto make a mis-statement, there is a good motive at  the bottom, and no one has any right to call it in question." This was received with marked satisfaction by the members  of the "circle," especially by Amos. Silence for awhile ensued, when it was proposed to sing a song of harmony, but the spirits not giving the key, it was omitted.  Brother C--, with solemn dignity, befitting the occasion, arose and said -  "This meeting doth call to my mind a congregation of Quakers. I would like to hear the 'members' relate what  manifestations' they have had during the last week." We speak you to be quiet," interrupted Amos, vehemently, who had been sitting mute, but with distorted features and nervous twitchings, proving him to be the Medium of some powerful demonstration." "If ye cannot be quiet we will everlastingly withdraw. A power sways us which'individuality   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTI      CENTURY. 2" cannot long endure. We are possessed. Spirit thoughts, and ideas and volitions, are pouring in upon me with such dreadful pressure, that unless the audience are attentive and candid, so I can communicate, it will be impossible to bear it. Let the Lncandgc leave the house, as we cannot speak fluently without universal candor. The subject to be considered is spiritual influence. Again we bid those who cannot appreciate our spiritual discourse to withdraw, or we (the spirits) will eternally withdraw from the presence of mankind. "The spirit came here to communicate upon a certain point, but is obliged to postpone it because the minds of this assembly are diseased, and there is a want of canmdor. "You can form no idea of the amount of thought the spirit infuses into me. We repeat, the topic which we came here to speak upon we cannot discuss for want of candor. But at some future time we will give twelve lectures of four hours each, and at the end of which, the spirit will reveal who he is. Sobriety distinguished him on earth, as his friends can tetify, and in the Spheres he retains his personal identity.  Hence, every thing like levity and sport he takes as a direct insult. Do you suppose the Medium isane? Look at the action of lunatics, and then at mine. If you discover no insanity in the Medium, then listen with candor: "Will some one ask candid questions that they may receive a spiritual, candid answer?" Qestion-- by a member of the "circle." "What is the motive power of the system?" Answer (by the spirits entirely original.)  "Eternal principle of thought."    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6456-00000113"/> Zl. JX U UV X JDUb TU N . Question. "Why is it that there are but three. besides   ( Mediums that have seen the seventh Sphere?"          , Answer.  Will answer at a future time, when the spirit can be candidly heard." The last reply called forth a tremendous burst of spiritual applause.  We hold individuals by a power they knows not of," added . : the Medium, in a monitory tone. "We have endeavored to  lead the audience to reflectionoand candor. Therefore beware!"'  Thus spake the spirit through its mouth-piece, Amos Fungle- I head, and took its exit, leaving him again to mingle with mortals for a season, promising, however, that when he could be candidly heard, he should, by the permission and aid of the spirits, make some remarkable revelations. The meeting (held on Sabbath evening) was deemed of such  importance, and productive of so great good, that by the ad-  vice of the spirits the same was adjourned to the succeeding I Sabbath, in the hope that a candid audience would be in at-  tendance-also that the superstitious and misguided who were  accustomed to squander their Sunday's at church, might be prevailed upon to forsake that foolish custom, and adopt the method of telegraphing directly to the Spirit-Land, a speedy and accurate way, so greatly preferable to the circumlocution and dull monotony of the pulpit. Thus Funglehead, the quondum High Priest, made a success- ful rally to retrieve his sinking fortunes and redeem Spiritual- ism for reproach. We are sorry to be obliged to' add, that the adjourned meet- ing proved a failure, as the spirits were- unable to attend, in consequence of the inclemency of the weather. -     t ,  .

D  OCTOR Badger and his landlady, accompanied by Miss Boston, and two others of the "strong-minded," returned homne.

Bills were struck off by the village printer (" money makes the mare go"), announcing a meeting in favor of "woman's rights," to be held on the following day but one, at Aca- demic Hall. The notices were "posted " and scattered in all di. rections. The school "marms " of the respective districts, by request, instructed their scholars to tell their parents and every body they should meet on the road. The same day, several persons applied to Wilson for board. They could be accommodated, he said, in every way except lodging, and that they could have as soon as the visitors should leave - a very indefinite period, he confessed - since his guests belonged to the "woman's rights" party; and among other im- munities claimed by them (and which he most cheerfully granted), was the right to visit when they please, where they please, and as long as they please. The Doctor, advised of the state of affairs, kindly offered to relinquish his room to Miss Boston and suite, during their stay. "As for himself, he was willing," he said, "for so short a time, to sleep upon the sofa, or go to the neighbors, or do most any way, rather than have Mrs. Wilson lose the proposed boarders." She finally informed them that they could have rooms, as they wished to remain permanently. Mrs. W -   introduced her visitors to the Doctor's apart- ment, which she informed them was the identical spot where the spirit appeared and prophesied. In retiring for the night, Miss B ---'s companions evidently betrayed signs of nervous- ness. Though naturally free from superstition, they'could not help fancying they saw apparitions every moment.

Not so, Miss Boston. Her nerves were undisturbed, save by a feverish anxiety to see the spirit of the Mermaid, which she hoped and prayed might appear to her. But the silent watches, when specters and witches are abroad, glided darkly by, and her eyes, though longing for the sight, were not greeted with even the shade of a ' manifestation." The following day, Doctor Badger called upoh the occupants, pro tenmpore, of -his own quarters. By the power of associa- tion, conversation naturally turned upon the topic of the Mer- maid. Graphic was the description which the revelator gave of the scenes connected with the advent. And they were in the haunted room! The man who saw, and heard, and felt the miracle, himself stood before them! What a reality! What reflections it awakened! What sacred aWe it inspired  It was almost like lifting the curtain that hides the Spirit- World. The timid inmates of the "haunted chamber" (as they called it), wrought upon by the recent narrative till their imaginations swarmed with specters, took the greatest care to guard against all ghostly intrusions. The room was carefully searched, in the closet, behind the fire-board, and under the bed --every door and window was firmly locked, bolted, and nailed, before they dared to lay their-heads upon their pillows. Miss B- - rallied them for their childish fears. She was herself a stranger to any such emotions, too " strong-minded" to be troubled about witches, and too much of a "Spiritualist" to stand in dread of ghosts. Her only fear was that the Mermaid would not appear. She could imagine no good reason why the    <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6456-00000115"/> 216         LUCY    BOSTON. spirit might not manifest itself to her that night. Surely it will, thought she, if it only considers my anxiety, the purity of my motives, and- the welfare of our cause.- She had a strong and growing presentiment that her hope would be realized. Again, Night stretched forth her "leaden scepter," calling mortals to the land of dreams. Badger, with genuine philan- thropy and stoic fortitude, took his bachelor's berth on the parlor sofa. The, "silent watches" had begun their round, and he was "dropping off to sleep," when (audible to him alone) broke upon his ear. "Awake! arouse!"   His eyes flew open, not with fright but joyful surprise,- for there she stood the personification of ideal beauty. "Miss --" (Boston he was going to, shout)-and his strained optics gazed on vacancy! In feverish suspense he watched for her return, till nature exhausted, he was relapsing into a drowse, as again the voice rung in his ear - "Awake! awake!" Mrs. --  " was on his lips, and again the spirit vanished. Amazed and disappointed, he lay cogitating on the freakishness of 'his amphibious acquaintance, when, like a flash of moonlight darting into his presence, she forestalled his utterance thus: "Hold! man, thy tongue! If I to womankind Desired to speak - think'st thou I knew it not? My present mission is alone to thee. Thy actions have I seen, and marked them well, As faithful thou hast been to my behest.

Badger, like a monomaniac, rushing to his room   to deliver the tidings to  Miss Boston, assaulted the door with great vio- lence, but she having the capacity of sleeping soundly did not hear him. Not thus her companions. Their thoughts teem.. ing with spirits making sleep "hard to catch," they were "'all eye,- all-ear," as at the first rap on the door, with a half sup- pressed shriek, they sought escape from danger by burying their heads under the bedclothes. Loud and yet louder echoed the mysterious knockings, while our brave Reformers (!) clung to each other, speechless and almost breathless, with fright at this  " demonstration" of a Rapping Spirit. Miss Boston's slumbers remained oblivous, sleep's " poppied warmth" having  sealed her eyelids. With indomitable per- severance our bachelor Medium redoubled his knocks with such determined vigor as to arouse Mrs. and Mr. Wilson; she, af- frighted, imagined thieves to have gained access to the house: A repetition of the out-of-season disturbance set Wilson upon search for the cause, which was soon discovered, and discharging a well-aimed volley of wit at the old bachelor, he returned and reported the result of his researches to his wife. 19  -     <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6456-00000116"/> 218        LUCY  BOSTON. In opposition to!the remonstrances of her husband, she started to administer summary discipline upon the disturber of her house, whom she met, and who for once, getting the start of her tongue, said- "Mrs. Wilson, I've seen the spirit again."

' Mr. Badger sees the Mermaid!" exclaimed the news- bearer, with agitation. {' Oh dear! oh - dear!" uttered the two " strong-minded," in a half-smothered tone, still buried in the blankets. Lucy hastening to the parlor, with the utmost despatch' Badger related to her what had occurred. "O that {I could have been here!' said she. c Why did you not instantly call me, Mr. Badger?" I was going to/' replied he; "but before I could speak the very first letter of your name, it was out of sight every time."  Feeling a-strong presentiment of its reappearance, she pro- posed to take his place on the sofa, and so by stratagem obtain a sight of the being which had so pertinaciously avoided her. The Doctor gallantly consented, and as a dernier resort for a couch, sought and occupied the lounge in the sitting room.   FOLtLIES  OF  THE  XIXTH   CENTURY. 219 Miss B-- speedily followed, not in the "footsteps," but the resting place of her "' illustrious predecessor." Scarcely had she closed her eyes in pretended slumber, when greeted with, "I come again, O man, with words of cheer to thee, and------"  Of the aquatic speaker proceeding thus, Miss B--, peep- ing through her half-opened eyelids, caught a glance, and but a glance, when the deluded spirit, discovering the fraud, in- stantly assumed a horrid aspect, and with a terrific shriek darted spitefully into invisibility. Miss Boston had seen the spirit of the Mermaid! But why should it leave her so abruptly in a huff? And would it not return? Revolving these queries in her mind, our heroine, to court a new " manifestation," again closed her eyes in mock sleep, when her hopes were realized in the salutation - "Awake! thou mortal good and bad, awake!   Since thou myself hast kenn'd, although by trick, felonious more shalt thou see and hear. Ope wide thine eyes, behold me now and list!" Lo! what a metamorphosis! Her scales and hair erect, her broad fins spread, and eyes like balls of fire, she stood the per- sonification of Fury infuriated, and thus continued- ".O, woman, thinkest thou I know thee not? Thy sympathy and zeal for the oppressed? Why didst thou seek in heart of man to lodge The disbelief of my own entity, When him I brought in timely aid to thee? 'Twas wicked guile, and hence my present shape.    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6456-00000117"/> 220        Lucy   BOSTON. Dost see and hear me now? Then doubt no more, Nor dare again thy stratagems repeat, Lest haply I, in form more ugly come, And, like "ten furies," haunt thee night and day."' In a twinkling, resuming her former appearance - ", Behold me now, for what in thee is good, Our cause is just and will prevail - Be this The motto on thy shield of faith- adieu." She spake-and melted into air.   The, Mermaid was a fixed fact! So was the prophecy; and of course its fulfill- ment must be equally as fixed in futuro. Girded with new strength and fired with fresh zeal, our he- roine was now fully panoplied. Henceforth she could boldly plead in aid of the Reform, the proof of its divinity, based not upon speculation nor testimony, but her own " firm, unal- terable experience," and repeating to herself, ". Our cause is just and will prevail," she fell asleep. Her companions scarcely shut their eyes the live-long night, no less curious to see, yet afraid to move lest they should be- hold a sheeted ghost. Morning came. To report the meeting of the inmates of the boarding-house is needless. Imagination can supply the omission. It is enough to say that each spoke well their part, especially Wilson, than whom none ever saw "A merrier man Within the limits of becoming mirth." The chief object of Mrs. Wilson in having the "strong-   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH      CENTURY. 221 minded" return with her, was the conversion of her husband to the "good cause." They saw, at a glance, what sort of stuff he was made of:- "Rare compound of oddity, frolic and fun! Who relished a joke, and rejoiced in a pun Whose temper was generous, open, sincere; A stranger to flatt'ry, a stranger to fear; Who scattered around, wit and humor at will; Whose daily bons mots half a column might fill." Prudence teaching them not to draw him into open encoun- ter, they finally, by dint of argument and exhortation combined, persuaded their over-zealous hostess that what could not be gained by force, must be compassed by generalship, and so the line of policy with respect to her chivalric lord was clear. They must amuse him and retain his good-will until the revolution should be consummated. Then must the jolly heretic submit or'suffer. One thing at any rate was very gratifying. If they could not win him over to their ranks, neither could he stop the Reform. Horses and carriage "summoned," the Reformers took a " turn" into the country, accompanied by their incorrigible host. All were in the best of spirits, saye Miss B--'s room com- panions, whose dullness, red eyes, and frequent yawning betrayed their last night's vigils. Their excursion was enlivened by pleasant anecdote and sportive jest, Wilson ever and anon exclaiming, Huzzah for Spirit Knockings and Woman's Rights! That suit you, my duck? You're my candidate, you know - I always go the ' straight ticket,' so I suppose I belong to the party- a regular 'turncoat.' Hurrah for my wife and 'woman's rights'" -and the like. 19*     <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6456-00000118"/> 222        Lucy  BOSTON. "You will be taken care of in due time, sir," said Miss Boston, in a prophetic tone. Mrs. Wilson was sanguine that her husband would be con- verted. All thought his case a hopeful one, and congratulated each other on the prospective accession to their strength.  Well timed, "The tocsin of the sodl-- the dinner bell!" greeted the return of the troupe whose inner and outer man and woman were capacitated amply to relish the continuous "feast of fat things." The afternoon waned-our fair Re- formers made preparation for the public meeting in the evening. At an early hour the little village filled up with all sorts of people, flowing into it from all directions and in all sorts of style. Academic Hall proving much too straight for the multitude, they adjourned to the yard in front illumined by the combined light of Reform and the full moon! In organizing, a spirited contest took place in the election of a chairwoman, there being two opposing candidates, Mrs. Wilson and the editor's wife. After a smart canvass the latter was declared chosen, though by a very close vote. Our landlady stood, or sat, the next in official rank. As a prelude to the exercises, the village band, having vol- unteered their services, played with great gusto - "There's a good time coming, girls." One of Miss Boston's traveling companions opened the meet- ing in a brief, neat address, showing what the relative position of the sexes had been, and defining what it should be. To the mass, her ideas were, for the most part, entirely new.   */2                     / FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CENTURY. 223 Lucy was then introduced as chief speaker of the evening. She was glad, she said, to appear before the honest yeomanry and yeo-womanry of the country. It was there that virtue dwelt. She was under the open, free vault of. nature's great temple, and which, thank Heaven, man could not monopolize. Was the air formed more to fan the lungs of man than of woman?  Does earth send forth her fountains more to slake his thirst than hers? And shall not her mind and muscles be held as sacred and as free? From this point the speaker pro- ceeded to establish the equality and identity of all human rights, civil, social and domestic. Her speech was every way worthy of herself and the cause. Loud cheers attested that she had made a decided "hit." Nor was noise the only fruit of her effort. The few who had not signed the petition, did so at once, pledging fidelity to the Re- form. A vote was passed on the spot, quite unanimously, to support the "woman's rights" ticket at the forthcoming elec- tion. Miss Boston said it was part of her business to give 'those an opportunity, who wished to subscribe for The Broom, their campaign paper, which would be issued weekly at the Capitol until the close of election. Great was the rush of subscribers. In that quarter all things were rife for revolution. Wilson said he hoped they "would have a good time of it." The following day Miss Boston and attendants took their leave, escorted some distance on their way by Doctor Badger. They separated, the former to prosecute their mission, the latter returned to his "boarding-place." /    <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6456-00000119"/> CHAPTER XVIII. "What fates impose, that men must needs abide; It boots not to resist both wind and tide." HE reader will recollect the departure of Miss Boston from the terms of her published bill, in her tangent movement, in quest of the Mermaid, and, as she supposed, the consequent disappointment of several large audiences. But Rev. Mr. Q-, the abrupt seceder, prompted by philanthropy or some other motive, had himself fulfilledeach appointment, making eloquent appeals in behalf of the rights of woman, and with favorable results, notwithstanding the fanatical miscarriage of our fair reformer and the disappointment of the people ini losing the novelty and pleasure of seeing the person, and witnessing the eloquence of the fascinating Bloomer. We might stop here to vindicate, or at least palliate the con- duct of our heroine, in her apparent want of moral sense, in forsaking her engagements. We will only say, that "to err, is human." Minds the strongest, and souls the most ingenuous, are liable to be thrown from their balance. But a single error, however great, if repented of and not repeated, should easily be forgiven. Miss Boston came to herself again. On consulting her "bill," with the view of redeeming the remainder of her (224)   FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CENTURY. 226 pledges, she found herself in time to attend the great state convention, to be held on the fourth of July following. In every quarter, throughout the state, was heard the din of preparation. At length, the ever-to-be-remembered fourth of July, eighteen hundred seventy-six, came. It was a glorious morning. The sun dashed forth in all his splendor over the capitol, as upon Austerlitz, the harbinger of victory. Coaches, carriages, carts and every other available vehicle, laden with delegates; horsemen, horsewomen, and pedestrians; mothers and daughters, grand-mothers and grand-daughters, civic and rustic; a miscellaneous aggregate of quality and inequality, enveloped with clouds of dust, crowded the high-ways and by- ways. Locomotives, screaming and thundering, rushed to the Dj  depots, with their extra mammoth trains. Steamboats and i   other craft, large and small, sunk to the water's edge beneath their living freight, choked the river channel for miles above and below the city. To complete the demonstration, chairs, tables, tete-e-t6tes, side-boards and every species of furniture with feet or legs from two to four, animated by the spirits, in sympathy with, if not the actual projectors of the political reform, and ambitious of precedence in the grand initiative, sallied from parlor and kitchen, work-shop and ware-room, and struck an air line, pell mell, through flood, field and forest, straining every nerve, Albany-ward! From Champlain to the mouth of the Hudson, from Erie's waters to the St. Lawrence, came the "strong-minded" and cabinet-ware masses, pouring in upon the capitol, like an overwhelming deluge. The earth trembled under the mighty movement. Particular rendezvous there was none. It was impracticable, for in every direction     ,             ' . ;,    <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6456-00000120"/> 228        LuCY  BOSTON. far as the eye could reach, was one dense mass of women, chil- dren, furniture and- men. Music swelled its most stirring strains. Flags and petticoats flapped in the breeze. And such booming of guns and pealing of bell-metal! Such shouts and huzzas as went up from the sea of voices! The very air be- came vocal, and the heavens reverberated! Belfries announced the hour for marching in grand demonstration through the principal streets. Coming to time, appeared the officers: Betsey-Ann, Boss, Grand Marshal of the day -a bloomer, after the straitest sect, bestride a milk-white charger -supported by Tabitha Toplady, Rebecca Rider, Lacretia Cockburn and Henrietta Hornblower, assistant Marshals, together with an indefinite number of subalterns, all "booted and spurred" and horsed. "After many strains and heaves, They got up the saddle-eaves, From whence they vaulted into the seat, With so much vigor, strength, and heat, That they had almost tumbled over With their own weight, but did recover, By laying hold of neck and mane, Which oft they us'd instead of reign." Fruitlessly the officers essayed to form the procession, so densely were they packed and wedged; nor could they move without trampling numbers beneath their horses' feet. Rising aloft in their stirrups, the redoubtable staff brandished their "weapons, and at the top of their slender, feminine voices, vo- ciferated, "Fall into order, fall into order," which did but increase, if possible, the disorder, as the mighty jam swayed   FOLLIES OP THE XIXTH      CENTURY. 227 to and fro like the waves of the ocean. Force and fortune at length opened a breach. The quick-sighted Marshal seizing the lucky moment, shouted- "Music, strike up! crowd fall into line according to the handbill, and follow your leaders." It was like the conflicting rush of many waters - collapsing, rebounding, chafing, twisting and writhing in alternate im- pingement and repulsion. Nevertheless, in the lapse of time, by dint of extraordinary exertion and the aid of the spirits- Cleopatra in particular - the chaotic mass verging towards an equilibrium, was moulded into tolerable shape, when the prodi- gious column moved forward in the following manner: 1. Grand Marshal of the day, and'Staff, with proud port, dancing plumes and drawn swords. 2. BAND of the MUSES, under the direction of Madam Fugle- man, fife and drum major. A union of musicians and combina- tion of musical implements, altogether unparalleled. Next to Miss Fanny Fairy-Finger, who "touched the light guitar"- the leading instrument of the band-was particularly promi- nent Mrs. Thumpemhard, a very portly lady, and the most ex- traordinary base-drummer in all America. It was truly aston- ishing with what scientific precision and masterly emphasis she made every blow tell upon the deacon-skin. Last, though not least, either in magnitude or celebrity, was Aunt Philice, the Ethiopian Minstreless, executing the most exquisite antics on her Banjo. But we will not tantalize the reader by attempt- ing an adequate description of that music. Imagine all the conceivable sounds extractive and extortable from metal, wood, 4"    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6456-00000121"/> 228        LUCY BOSTON/. calf-skin and feline intestines, and you will have a faint idea of the magic execution of the Band of the Muses. 3. Standard Bearers, holding aloft and flaunting to the breeze an ensign, huge and unique, consisting of an enormous serpent, of-the Boa Constrictor species, on a field argent; its position neither couchant, salient, nor rampant, but what, in heraldic terms, would probably be called the bend-sinister, as it lay in something of a half circle, with its head thrust out of one leg of a pair of pantaloons, and its tail out of the other. From the sapient lips of her snakeship issued the mystic, ar- morial motto, "TH, EDE, VILTO, PA, Y." These symbolical characters said to have been inscribed by an amanuensis of the Spheres, it is not our province--even  granting us the ability - to interpret, but giving the fac-simile, opportunely furnished us by a connoisseur artist, we leave it for the reader, if possible, to decipher.

And first and foremost, directly under the  ample shadow of their talismanic standard, the BARE BOSOM BATTALION, a set of rosy-cheeked, cherry-lipped, luscious-look- ing lasses as man ever fastened eyes on, formed upon a model for speedy execution, and --as their appellation indicates-   j free, fearless, and brave. Their arms of nature's own fash- ioning, as yet un-battered or begrimed by campaign exposure, but soon to assume the gallant port of actual service, possessed a polish so perfect, as at the first glance of their sheen, to be- dizzen and paralyze the sterner foe. Once to aim their true  minnie (eye) balls at a poor fellow, was to annihilate him.

Motto: ' Wonman's Rights- No Quarter." 5. BLUE STOCKING BOLTERS, composed of staid spinsters, tall, lean, and lank, evidently fitted for long marches, hard fare and great endurance, yet looking dejected, wo-begone. Whether or not their uniform was symbolical, we cannot say; but their boots were green; * their jackets and trowsers covered with a profusion of green cord and lace; epaulets, knapsacks, and cartouch boxes the same; and lastly, as a sort of top gallant to complete the climax, they supported towering green chapeaus, surmounted by lofty, drooping feathers of like color. Their banner corresponded; field, green flannel hung with festoons and pendants of tea-colored crape. Device: a bald old bach- elor lassoed by a female of Amazonian proportions; the captor dragging the victim to an altar at the base of a decayed hem- lock, and overhead a turtle-dove, mateless and roosting on a solitary limb. Motto: "Maiden's Rights and Annexation." 6.

But extremes meet.

Device: A peacock spread -and a pugna- cious swan snapping at the heels of a retreating donkey. Motto: 'Progress! Clear the track!!" 8. GRAY-HEADED GRENADIERS, whose appellation is suf- ficiently descriptive of their character and appearance.

Accomplishing the passage of the principal avenues to the foot of State Street, the doughty phalanx wheeled, and with nimble step marching up the ascent to the tune of "The'Bloomer Gallopade," environed the capitol, with a massive, living wall of iron hearts, in aspect more "battailous" than simply political. An im. posing deputation demanded, in behalf and for the occupancy of the Female State Convention, the immediate surrender of the chamber. This summary demand met with a prompt and heroic denial. What audacity! How grossly insulting to the dignity and honor of the fair fillibusters, thus to obstruct the action of    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6456-00000123"/> 232         LUCY   BOSTON. their far-reaching patriotic ambition'! A case so extremely- aggravating, so destructive of authority, so unappreciative of popular sovereignty, so utterly shameless a violation of the laws of good breeding-! what could it require but the most summary measures, to avenge the insult and wipe out the dis- grace? Patriotism, to the last latent spark, kindled with he- roineic rage. A council of war forthwith ensued. Brief was the consultation -prompt the decision.

One enthusiastic shout, echoed by the multitudes, with the voice of swelling thunder, and the cohorts - as greyhounds from the leash - dashed forward, filling porch, hall, and cham- ber, and like an avalanchlle overwhelming the Legislature. Re- sistance was attempted, but in vain. The members of either House driven before the inrushing tide, and unable to escape, huddled together in every corner, like frightened sheep. Hurl- ing the Speaker headlong from his seat, General Boss occupied the desk, surrounded by her staff, and the orators of the day., Over them, aloft, was planted the revolutionary ensign-- breeches and boa - with circling spires, flaming crest and subtle eye; while, from window and gallery, waved the banners of de- fiance and triumph. Senate and House shared equal fate. Com- pletely overthrown, hemmed in and garrisoned about, they con- sidered "discretion the better part of valor," and made no further show of resistance. - 'The Jacobins thus in undisputed possession of the capitol, Marshal Boss arose amid tremendous   FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH    CENTURY. 233 cheers, and waving her claymore, in token of silence, an- nounced that, in accordance with a preconcerted and secret ar- rangement, the Honorable Hannah Ann Hancock, a worthy descendant of the illustrious John, of revolutionary memory, would read herpublic document for the action of the conven- tion. Whereupon the distinguished lady, advancing with measured dignity and precision, pronounced the following DECLARATION: When, in the course of inhuman events, it becomes neces- sary for one sex to break the oppressive bands which have linked them  with the other, and to assume the separate and superior station to which the laws of nature and their own abilities evidently entitle them, a voluntary condescension leads them to declare the causes which impel them to the dissolution. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women are created superior;  that they are invested by their formation with certain unmistakable rights; that among these are life and the liberty of doing as they please; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of those ends, it is the right of the women to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new polity, laying its foundation on such principles, and or- ganizing its powers in such forms, as to them shall seem most likely and speedily and safely and successfully to effect their purpose. Prudence indeed will dictate, that a government long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that woman-kind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are suffer- able, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which 20*    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6456-00000124"/> 234        LUCY   BOSTON. they have been accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a settled purpose to grind them under absolute and eternal tyranny, it is their right, it is their duty, to rise up and put down such a despotism, and raise new breast-works for their future protection. Such has been the meek and patient suffer- ance of the women of this state; and such is the necessity which drives them to upset the former system of government. The history of man is a history of repeated, uninterrupted, unprovoked and most outrageous injuries, usurpations and in- sults, all combining in a direct conspiracy, forever, to hamper the females of this state. For proof of this, let the plain facts in the case be told to the world. He has refused to make laws, wholesome and necessary, for the good of the female public. He has, on the contrary, passed laws the most unnecessary, unwholesome, and unpalatable to the feminine democracy of this commonwealth. He has prevented the establishment of justice. He has erected a multitude of houses and incarcerated us within them. He has tried to make the male independent of and superior to the female power. He has endeavored to bring us under a subjection contrary to our constitution; performing acts of legislation and custom: For saddling large troops of children upon us; For curtailing our desires; For limiting our expenses; For packing burdens upon us without our consent;   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH      CENTURY.     235 For compelling us to make clothes, and scour and starch and darn them every week for him to wear out on his own back; ::      For dooming us to delve in the kitchen; For confining us in the nursery prison; For disallowing us the privilege of voting and holding pub- lie office; For covering us with shilling calico when we choose silk, and with silk when we prefer satin. For refusing us a seat in the legislature and declaring him- self clothed with power to legislate for us in all cases whatso- ever : He has annulled our right of governing, by declaring us under his subjection, and waging war against our privileges; He has plundered our affections, rammaged our quarters, hooked our dresses, and fattened on the spoils of our sex; He   has excited domestic insurrections among us, and let' loose his merciless passions to prey upon us, and sought by all the means in. his power to crush out our lives under his un- hallowed feet. In every stage of these usurpations and  oppressions we have petitioned for redress and relief in terms the most pert and emphatic, as well as lofty and authoritative; our oft- repeated petitions, complaints and demands, have theen an- ' swered only by repeated wrongs. A creature, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit and unable to be the head and ruler, of free women. Nor have we been wanting in proper attentions to our male    <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6456-00000125"/> 236        LUCY  BOSTON. brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, against attempting to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of our peculiar circumstances. We have appealed to their sense of justice, magnanimity and de- cency, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred, by the cords of affection, by the sacred ligaments of matrimony, by the tendrils of sympathy, by the nerves of in- dependence and the muscles of vengeance; in short, by all the affections that link, and all the antipathies that sunder the sexes, we have implored and notified them to disavow and dis- continue these usurpations and oppressions, which would inevi- tably interrupt our connection and intercourse. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and mercy, of love and hatred, of warning and retribution. We are driven, therefore, to acqui- esce in the necessity which impels us to revolution, and to hold them as we hold all man-kind--hyenas in war; in peace, mules. We, therefore, the delegates of the women of the state of New York, in general covention assembled, appealing to the highest rule of the world, the supremacy of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good women of this commonwealth, deliberately and solemnly declare, that the females of this state are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT; that they are absolved from all allegiance to men; and that as free and independent women, they have full power to declare war, conclude peace, contract alliances, estab- lish commerce, forsake their children, enslave the men, let themselves loose, in short, "rul the roost," and to do every thing else which independent women may and can do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH CENTURY. 237 stretch of our ambition, the inflexibility of our will and the strength of our grit, we mutually pledge each other to stick together, and, "sink or swim," to fight it through, or fail in the attempt." At this new Declaration of Independence, patriotism, like a pent-up flood, broke loose and rushed beyond all bounds. Hands, feet and lungs, vied with each other in patriotic concussion and momentum.  The capitol shook and legislators- grew pale. This ebullition of freedom measurably subsiding, Fannyetta Freeman, Esq., presented the following-- Resolved, That this convention, having taken The Declara- tion of Independence, just read, into their most deliberate and serious consideration, do, on this the fourth day of July, 1876, unanimously declare that the reasons assigned in this immortal document, for pronouncing the women of the state of New York free and independent, are most pointed, cogent and con- elusive; and while we greatly deplore the necessity which has made this measure unavoidable, we approve the same, and will, at all hazards, hug togetherin supporting it. An approving shout proclaimed the resolution carried. Liberty was jubilant! Music woke b phrensied joy her "in- struments of wind and sound," as the band of the Muses delivered in uproarious harmony- "The Lords of Creation," after which the "campaign quartette" discoursed, in a style worthy the palmy age of Log Cabin-ism, the following ode, composed expressly for the occasion:- a,   ! 8    ;"     <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6456-00000126"/> 238         LUCY    BOSTON.

Now lose no time in parley blab, But quick, with an almighty grab, Hold him fast! This was the signal for the final maneuver in this mistressly 'coup d'tat," this grand stroke of revolutionary policy.

Passed July 4th, 1876. The deed was done! The scepter departed from man! His empire, six thousand years old, was no more! The underpen- ning suddenly extracted from the Babel of his sovereignty, the cloud-capped iron-ribbed, time-defiant structure came tumbling to pieces. Awful crash! The State-House shook. The vey hills of the capital rocked, and the Hudson fled up stream! A portentous tremor shot through either hemisphere, startling the inhabitants like the shock of an earthquake. But at the capital was tumultuous joy. Music poured out its very soul. The bells opened their brazen throats. Cannons bellowed and roared as if ready to split their sides. Shouts and huzzas from countless thousands rent the heavens. Meanwhile the male inhabitants of the city and others fron abroad, attracted thither by the spectacle, grouped together here and there, wherever a spot could be found for the sole of their foot, some making merry over the scene, treating it as! a most capital joke. Others, sedate and thoughtful, shook their heads and cast anxious looks, regarding the transactions of the day as an innovation in the highest degree dangerous, tending strongly to the corruption of morals and the subversion of public order. Deeply earnest were their protestations against the blindness, the folly, the culpability of winking at, or trifling with such proceedings -proceedings of a character so grave, so shameless, so lawless; meriting the contempt and demand- ing the stern rebuke of every good and honest citizen. Trea- son stalked boldly in the capital! Civil war was waged! The   FOLLIES OP THE     XIXTH   CENTURY. 241 reins of government were in the hands of the mob! Anarchy had begun!

But we must, at least for the present, leave the jolly pro- gressionists, fearless of "new measures," to make merry, and the old fogies, with lengthening visage, to peer ominously through their spectacles. Their object accomplished in the enactment of a bloodless revolution, the convention adjourned with cheers " three times three," making heaven and earth ring again. With colors flying, and "All the while Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds," the triumphal return began. Animated nature, and even the very elements, 'caught the new spirit of progression. Horses were fleet as the wind, and carriage-wheels rolled without fric- tion. Vessels like whizzing arrows shot through the foam. Steam generated new power. Electricity darted with increased velocity. Locomotives like mighty war chargers, snorting and pawing, leaped from their stations with nerves of steel and breath of fire, whirling the illustrious victors, almost with the velocity of lightning, over their burning tracks! Waters spouted; forests waved; hills made obeisance; winds whis- tled Yankee Doodle, while every where tables, chairs and storols fell to kicking up their heels for joy!

AMONG those whose vocation led them, by the various "ways and means," to discover the hidden things of both worlds, an intermeddling or prying spirit had been called up, giving an additional demonstration of the beauties and utility of " Spiritualism." Funglehead the Seer, one night, from the " Rock of Vision," through his spiritual eye-glasses, saw a young lady, a member of the " circle," somewhere, and publicly reported the same. She positively declared it was not "her, but somebody else." Amos also saw a gentleman somewhere else, who, when the news thereof came to his ears, pronounced it false, as he was not there, andnever had been. This afforded matter for public speculation, to an indefinite extent. Some thought the Seer could not be mistaken. Quite a number suggested, that if he did see anybody, he had no bus- iness to tell of it. The ladies, in particular, took the broad ground, that he had no right to look any way. " It comes to a pretty pass," said they, " if a body can't go nowhere, nor do nothing, nor even speak nor think, without having old Amos roosting on his rock and peeking through his specs at us all the time." (242)    This subject of Amos' spiritual clairvoyance was finally and very elaborately canvassed one afternoon, at a large tea-party. Were we writing in the by-gone age of horse-power, when the world trundled along by stage coach, under the everlasting four " knots an hour" system, we would furnish a report in detail of the interesting session, to fill up the time, and relieve the dull monotony. But as this is the age of steam and light- ning, making time and space mere abbreviations, when people read, and eat, and sleep laconically, we must adapt ourselves to the spirit of the times, and narrate generically and  not specifically, except where very particular reasons necessitate the contrary. Accordingly, the details of our anti-spiritual- istic tea-party, though in many respects novel and edifying, we pass unchronicled. However, it will indicate the outline, and imagination can fill up the picture, when we say that Amos would have been in extreme peril, had he shown his head among them. Some threatened to throw scalding water on him, and others declared they would smash his spectacles, if they could get their hands on them. High ran the excitement, and desperate were the machinations against him, when a maiden lady, who had hitherto maintained a degree of taci- turnity, with a view to quell the turbulence of her mobocratic sisters, exclaimed - "Why, law me I jist as lives Mr. Funglehead would look at me all the while, as not." Finally, they all agreed they had never said or done any thing to be ashamed of, but still they held that it was ungen- tlemanly and impudent in Amos to be forever peeking into other peoples' matters.    <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6456-00000129"/> 244        LucY  BOSTON. Celestial meetings had been held, and divers manifestations made, when a spirit (through what kind of a Medium we never knew) called the " circle" together again, on a certain evening. All the members were present and highly elated. Encircling the table, after the manner of the old regimen, they joined hands, and the "manifestations" commenced, varying respectively, according to the different kinds of Mediums. The " rappers" began to thump. The "writers " motioned for paper and pencil, which not being furnished them, they used their finger-nails upon the table, making deep spiritual in- denitations. The "talkers" made mouths. The "smellers" snuffed, and the eyes of Amos the Seer projected from their sockets, apparently fastened on some distant object. Thus was constituted a grand union circle, a combination of the different schools of Spiritopathy, a grand consolidation and opening of all the sluices of communication from the Spirit-Land. The room was evidently full of spirits, loading the Mediums with dispatches, ready to be announced. But the " master of ceremonies" was in a quandary. If he should put the usual question -"What spirits are present?" they would all answer at once, in clamor and confusion. To ask in rotation was inexpedient, lest those delayed should take offense at being slighted, and in consequence, important mes- sages be lost to the world. Here was a dilemma, unlooked for and perplexing. But something must be done, for the spirits were not to be trifled with, On the whole, as the safest alter- native, he concluded to call for particular spirits, from whom he felt anxious to hear. So he asked, "Is the spirit of Peter Finkle present?   FOLLIES   OF THE  XIXTH   CENTURY. 245 Thump - thump - thump, by the " rappers." "Here," here," cut deep in the table by the "writers." "On hand every time," sung out the "talker." Funglehead's eyes plainly indicated that he saw it. Z. Socrates the "smeller," with nostrils distended, snorted like a porpoise. All answering thus in the affirmative, it was unquestionable that the spirit was communicative any way, and every way. However, preferring to leave it to adopt its own method, the operator inquired - "What does the spirit of Peter Finkle wish to commu- nicate?" Answer (by the talking Medium).  "Don't believe any body but me. Those ' rappers' are impostors, and so are all the others. They were turned out of the 'Spheres' and cast down to purgatory. I tell the truth.' Answer (by the writing Mediums).  "That talker is no good spirit. It is a notorious liar. Shun it." The other Mediums were mute, as they never communicated except in answer to interrogatories, although they appeared to be under deep concern of mind, and no wonder. The " writer" had his backers, who declared he was right. So, on the other hand, the " talker' -and things took on a dubious aspect. The leader, being partial to the old school - in other words, the " rappers" (who were sitting with knuckles ready on the table)-- determined to give them a chance, and asked- Art thou the real spirit of Peter Finkle?" Answer, by all, affirmatively. Question. '"Art thou in the Upper Sphere? 21*    <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6456-00000130"/> 246        LucY  BOSTON. Half rapped in the affirmative and half in the negative. The interrogator, supposing himself misunderstood, repeated the question distinctly, placing special emphasis upon the word I upper ;" but the "raps" were the same, pro and con as be- , fore, and each so loud as to leave no doubt of their earnestness.  The respective Mediums, with their supporters, were thus divided into four factions, as above indicated, each claiming to be orthodox, and pronouncing the others heterodox. Amos, meanwhile, had kept his seat, as quietly as possible under the circumstances, but straining his eyes nearly out of his head. He had not winked even once.   Amos never winked when looking through spiritual optics. Z. Socrates, the smeller, was very uneasy. He had fre- quently turned up his nasal organ as if in the vicinity of something exceedingly offensive to his spiritual olfactories. Who shall decide when the spirits disagree? Here was a conflict of communications sufficiently contradictory; but there being two Mediums as yet unheard from, it was thought best to go through the list, so the operator inquired "Doth Amos the Seer see the spirit of Peter Finkle?" "Yea, he does," answered Funglehead. Where doth it reside?" "It doth reside in the bottom Sphere." "I don't believe a word of it," said one. "What did I tell you," exclaimed another. "Humbug!" cried others. "I never-had any faith in the rappers." "As much as I ever had in the scrawlers," was the ready retort.    FOLLIES OF THE XI-XTS      CENTURY. 247 Thus some declared one thing and some another, criminating and recriminating. Amos had his full share of followers, who of course de- nounced all other Mediums, and so a fifth sect was formed. Great confusion prevailed, and the " circle" was likely to break up in a row. Z. Socrates had maintained a knowing silence, ever and anon, with an air of wisdom, applying a handkerchief to the extremity of his proboscis. Finally, the leader asked, Doth the smeller scent that the spirit of Peter Finkle is present? "The smeller doth smell many things," was the reply. The question was repeated, when Z. Socrates answered with a snuff, "I smell Peter Finkle's spiritual presence, and I am his only mouth-piece - nose-piece, I mean. I am the final incar- nation of spiritualism. I smell that all these Mediums are quacks. Peter Finkle was a Dutchman. His spirit hasn't understood a word of your English, and can't without an interpreter; besides, he is deaf and'dumb. 4 That's a fact," said one. "True as the almanac, cried another. The Medium of the deaf and dumb Dutchman, to prove his veracity, at once communicating with Mr. Finkle, defunct, threw himself into all conceivable shapes and attitudes, thereby demonstrating his familiarity with the manipulative, pedestrial and physiognomical alphabet of the celestial deaf mutes.                       No All acquiesced in the superior knowledge of Z. Socrates Noz-    <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6456-00000131"/> 248         LUCY BOSTON. zleman. His exposition was entirely satisfactory to the " circle."  Although many were loth to abandon their favorite theories and sects, still the star of Z. Socrates was in the ascendant. A vital truth in the science of"Spiritualism" had thus been evolved, to wit: that spirits retain not only their personal identi-  ty, but the features of their physical, as well as moral peculiari- ties, and cannot naturally communicate save in their own mun- dane, vernacular tongue. Hence it is conclusive, either that the languages are not taught, or if they are, that all do not become linguists in the "Spheres." Hence, also, the origin of the vari- ous mistakes and failures of the Spiritualists. The mystery    : was thus unraveled, and cleared of obscurity - a great and all-  important discovery. Henceforth the New Lights considered their infallibility as settled. They all agreed that the smelling "Medium" was accurate; but as sectarians, more or less felt unwilling to admit that theotherswere notalso reliable. Large bets were laid on the heads of their favorite "Mediums," that if allowed fair play, they would "hit the mark" every time, and it was stipulated, by general consent, that Z. Socrates Noz- zleman, the smeller, should act as umpire. To test their respective merits, the sapient "circle" was  again formed, the owner of the table taking the precaution to furnish stationery for the "writers," to save his furniture from  being further disfigured.  No sooner was the psychological ring described by joining      of hands, than in rushed the spirits like a whirlwind. Never before had they appeared in such numbers. It seemed as if  the "Spheres" had made a general "turn out," and all were  importunate to speak at once. I:   FOLLIES OF THE     XIX TH  CENTURY. 249 The leader foresaw the confusion about to follow. What could he do? How to send them back again he knew not. To turn them out of doors was impossible. His scepter of au- thority over them was a broken reed. Never before had they acted so lawlessly. Without a question being asked, the vari- ous "Mediums" were all in motion, according to their respec- tive "orders." The rappings were deafening. The tongue of the talker, unbridled, ran rampant and wild. Amos' eyes rolled andashed like two balls of electricity. The nose of Z. Soc- rates becoming fearfully distended, fell to snuffing as if all the perfumery of the Spheres were unbottled, and the spiritual effluvia tickling its nervous sensibilities, threw it into a fit of sneezing, so violently explosive as to be in danger of detaching itself from the physiognomy of its owner. Surely, in all nose. dom, there was not another such nose as that of Z. Socrates Nozzleman.  No wonder that by common consent, he was christened the " mighty snorter," as he was. But to the " circle." It was a moment of most intense in- terest. The rival "Mediums," each pitted against the others, had fairly entered the "ring" for superiority, and fierce in- deed was the contest. Amid incessant "knockings," te " talkers" continually shouted, "I can't keep still-I won't keep still-stop your noise, and save your knuckles." The "writers," with great rapidity filling their sheets, in fine hand, closely interlined, wrote- "Cease that clamor. Shut your mouth- quit pounding- stop that blab," &amp;c., &amp;c. \ t    <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6456-00000132"/> 250        Lucy  BosTON. The leader, with the intention of bringing the spirits to order and putting an end to the noise and confusion, inquired, What spirit is present?" "I'm here myself - I'm here myself," shouted the " talker." "Its a lie; we're here-Its a lie; we're here"- answered the "writers." The operator directing himself to the "talking Medium," enquired with emphatic distinctness, "Whose - spirit - are --you?" "I'm my own spirit, sir. Nobody owns me but myself."  ' What is your name?" "None of your business. Who made you my confessor, sir." The interrogator was fairly non-plussed. Whether it was Napoleon, Hannibal, Giant Grim, or the Devil he could not tell, but it was manifestly a bold one. Mr. Moderator would gladly have dropped the subject at this point, but he durst not through fear of exciting a new "manifestation," as the spirits are exceedingly sensitive. Thinking that possibly his manner of interrogation might not have been sufficiently deferential, he bowed and said, "Will you have the kindness to inform me whose spirit you are?" "I told you once I was nobody's but my own. You fool! can't you understand nothing?" This was a poser, argumentum ad hominem, rather personal. The spirit was clearly in high dudgeon, from some cause, and the poor man knew not how soon a spiritual "revolver" or bowie-knife might make daylight shine through him. Being" opposed to war and dueling, he gave the " code of honor" the   FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CENTURY. 251 go-by, pocketed the insult, and withdrew, by turning his atten- tion to the writers. They had communicated nothing new, but observing one of them with pen in hand, apparently await- ing orders, he politely requested, "Will the spirit be kind enough to write its name!" "No, I won't. Its none of your business, sir." The " circle " looked dead blank at so unexpected a rebuff, and such unparalleled obstinacy. Great was the wonderment as to who it could be. The " rappers," in turn, were interro- gated with respect to their spiritual constituents whom they represented, but with no more satisfactory result. Every mil- itary chieftain, robber and outlaw, recorded in history or ro- mance, was called, but to each was received a negative "rap." The backers of the "Mediums" who had" communicated," drooped with discouragement. Who in the name of all the "Spheres" could be the rebel ghost, so wilful and daring as thus to " snub" the "Mediums," and bring the science of Spiritology into public contempt. Amos the Seer had not winked for an hour. His optics were fixed and glassy. His backers knew it was all clear to him, and at their suggestion the moderator asked, "Doth Amos the Seer see the spirit?" "Yea, verily," he replied. c Can Amos the Seer tell his name?" "Yea, he can. "There, what did we tell you!" exclaimed the Amosites. "That art the spirit of General Taylor," continued the Seer. "It hath on regimentals and is on horseback." "Doth it wear an overcoat?" asked the moderator.    <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6456-00000133"/> 252        LUCY. BOSTON. "Yea, an old gray surtout. "The color of his breast?" "It is like unto milk." "The Old Hero of Buena Vista, as sure as guns!" ex. claimed one. "And the old gray coat?" cried another. "And old ' Whitey,' too," joined a third. "Hurrah for Spiritualism and Amos the Seer!" shouted the supporters of Funglehead, with exultation. Its all a de4ish lie!" yelled the " talker," bristling up to Amos in a pugnacious manner. "That's so," scrawled the writers, assuming a similar at- titude. The "knockers," too, with fists doubled in pugilistic style, gathered around the man of "Vision," as if about to give him a rapping "demonstration" that would at least be im- pressive. Some of the peace members interfering, warned them to forbear all belligerent demonstrations, lest "Old Zach." should play up Buena Vista with them. The friends of Z. Socrates Nozzleman were anxious to "make a strike," and one of them inquired - "What doth Z. Socrates, the smeller, smell?" "The smeller doth smell much." "Doth he smell the spirit of General Taylor?" "Nay, it aint here, and hath not been."          - "There!"  "There!" "There!" echoed from different parts of the " circle." "What spirit doth Z. Socrates, the scenter, scent?" asked the moderator.   FOLLIES OF THE XI-XTH      CENTURY. 253 "He doth scent the spirit of a female. It doth savor strongly of woman's rights." "Her name?" "She doth forbid me to tell." "And why?" "- Because." The secret was out. It was in truth a lady spirit. The pertinent responses, and especially the universal woman's "reason" or all-final " because," proved it. Z. Socrates exulted in his triumph. The rival "Mediums" stood aghast. Noseology was established on a firm basis. It was the grand demonstrator of Spiritualism. The "circle" broke up in high glee, at the thought that now they were on the right track-the real " straight line" between earth and the "Spheres." The "Rock of Vision" had become notorious.  The mis. chievousness of boys was always so. *  *   *    , *  *   *  *   *   * Now, it was the habit of Amos the Seer to make nightly observations from his spiritual observatory. He came as usual and took his position. Never before did granite present a sur- face of such downy softness. The spiritual oozing was abun- dant. Surely the rock must have become instinct with the vi- tality of Spiritualism, and delighted with the contact of a body of its own "kidney," it clung to his- unmentionables with the most affectionate adhesiveness. Never till then was there so close an affinity between granite and fustian. The union was beatific. From the tips of his hair to the ends of his toes, the man of vision felt a thrill of pleasure. 22    <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6456-00000134"/> 254        Lucy  BOSTON. Amos had carefully anointed his goggles with the spiritual eye salve, and with clairvoyant optics was about to review the lower regions, when lo! a report like thunder! and amid flame and fume, the Rock of Vision and Funglehead ascended! The last that was seen of Amoshe was on his way to the seventh Sphere! His followers declare he was promoted by the spirits, and that the noise and smoke were but the percussive friction of their electric wings in elevating him to his more exalted position. Rumor said there was a strong smell of pitch and brimstone, and that saltpeter had more to do than the spirits in his ethe- rial elevation. This, however, must be a mistake, as a pilgrim from the Seventh Zone afterwards brought the intelligence that one Amos Funglehead suddenly made his appearance there that he had turned doctor and was peddling roots with a horse and sulky I      \       *  *       -  *   '   CHAPTER XX. "It is jealousy's peculiar nature To swell small things to great; nay, out of nought To conjure much; and then to lose its reason Amid the hideous phantoms it has formed." W   TILSON maintained his accustomed good humor, although he would have been better pleased had his wife re- mained at home and- attended to the household cares. Yet he never allowed himself to cherish towards her feelings of dis- pleasure, nor to address her in the language of unkindness or complaint. In no event had her "rights," as hitherto under- stood, suffered the least abridgment at his hands. Liberal in- dulgence, rather than restraint in the least degree, was his rule of conduct 'relative to his companion-an example, by the way, worthy of all imitation by partners on the voyage of life. The " woman's rights" meeting had set the community in a blaze. Wilson and the editor were almost the only persons in the vicinity who dared express a doubt as to the new scheme of political reform. One night when the curtains were drawn, our landlord ex- plained to his wife at large the inevitable effects of the excite- ment, reasoned with her sensibly on the subject with which (255)    <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6456-00000135"/> 256         LUCY  BOSTON. she was so possessed, and besought her to abandon it, assuring her it was not well considered, that she would be ridiculed af- terwards, and if unable to be convinced of her error, by all means not to make herself so conspicuous in the movement. Mrs. Wilson listened with silent but ominous attention, When not out of humor, she had scarcely ever been disposed to cross her husband's wishes. But when the fit was on, which at length had become chronic,--or, to use a more charitable expression, when her spirit of independence was aroused- she would peremptorily demand her " rights," and vow that she would have them " any how.' Wilson often asked for her definition of u rights," but could get no answer satisfactory to'him. "What is it you want, my dear," he would frequently in-- quire, with real anxiety. I want my I rights,'" was the invariable reply. Like a generous soul as he was, he granted her every thing she desired: money, ostensibly the sole management of the household affairs, and - to. use his own language - liberty to ' put on his breeches and raise the devil her own way." But this was not sufficient. She must and would have her a rights." Somehow the idea had found its way into her head, that she was to be elected a member of the Legislature, In short, she had fallen into the fashion of being ambitious for office. Wilson saw the futility of attempting to change the current of a " strong mind." He also perceived that Badger was holding her spell-bound- that whatever "Mr. Badger" said, did, or advised, was to her the rule of action. His will was   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH      CENTURY. 267 her pleasure, although it might- be in opposition to her hus- band's wishes. Not that Amaziah intentionally trespassed up- on the marital authority of his host, nor that his hostess inten- tionally lacked either in propriety or conjugal fidelity. It was purely the result of spiritualistic affinity--an involuntary co- incidence of reformatory activity, and of which they were wholly unconscious, belonging as they did to the class of Im- pressible Mediums. Mrs. Wilson had not fallen into a fit for some time, a very unusual phenomenon in that latitude. Now Wilson, with all his fund of good nature, had natu- rally a great aversion to ' fits," but he had come to feel a relish for one, provided it could be induced in a modified form. In other words- was it secret jealousy or to develop human na- ture and for the sake of the " fun " - he felt an itching to -see his wife and the "old bachelor" have a falling out; and it must be confessed that in addition (nor is it strange), there was lurking in his feelings a determination not to stand in the way, if the lady of the house should again order Badger to change his boarding-place. "That was a splendid dress; do -you know what it cost?" said Wilson to his wife. "What dress?" asked she, with a tone and look of inquisi- tive surprise. "Have you bought me one since Fve been gone?" "No. I mean that one Badger got in U-- yesterday. I think she'll look pretty fine in it," said he, archly. "Did Badger buy a dress there? Who was it for? I did'nt know it," ejaculated she, with jealous anxiety. 22*  . .- .s * b.    <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6456-00000136"/> 258        Lucy BOSTON.  "-0, you don't know any thing about it then?

Don't say I mentioned it; friend-Badger might not like it, and I don't want to offend hims" said Wilson, as if he had unwittingly revealed a secret. a You shall tell me too. I should like to know who he's buying dresses for. For my part, I don't think it looks well for any woman to receive a dress from him. Come now, husband, do tell me all about it." c"I guess its all right," said he evasively. "Badger knows what he's about. Perhaps he didn't buy it for a woman. The men may want satin soon." "Satin, satin, a satin dress! I'll find out who he's been getting satin dresses for. Now you know all about it. You shall tell me. If you don't, rI'll make hiMm tell, and turn him out of the house besides," said she, showing plainly the   ' Ad symptoms." "O not so bad as that, we can't spare Mr. Badger.

"Now Harry, you shall tell me who he's give the dress and watch to --you ought to, when I wan't to know so bad," said she, coaxingly. "You keep an eye out," returned he, as if putting her on P  .the track to learn it all, " and if you see a certain lady with a new watch, it won't be called inquisitive among yourselves if you enquire pretty closely where it came from."

May be you'll see a pair of new ear-rings on a certain young lady, and -- but what am I about? I must stop," said Wilson, as if inadvertently exposing what Badger had studiously kept a secret from her. This was too much.

He shan't stay here another day. I won't give up this time, any way," and she raved and tore like one with hydrophobia. "But why do you berate Mr. Badger? Isn't he a nice man? Very kind-hearted to the ladies? He gives them dresses, watches, ear-rings and every thing." "Berate him! -nice man!- very kind-hearted! --- dresses! - watches! - ear-rings!

He ought to have his neck broke--who did he give 'em to? I want to know that, and you shall tell me, or I'll haunt you as long as you live." "I haven't said he gave them to anybody- have I?" "You needn't try to fool me -now. You've done it long enough. You-can't make me believe any thing good of him." "I always thought well of Mr. Badger, or I shouldn't have let you go off with him to the convention, and other places," said Wilson, pleasantly. "Shouldn't let me -gone off with him.

And if you don't take care, I'll put you out with him, now you under- stand it." "Well wife, I guess we better take a good night's rest. Perhaps you will feel better in the morning and not have quite so poor an opinion of our friend, Mr. Badger." "Don't call him my friend. He may be your friend and your ladies' friend with the satin dress, and gold watch, and new ear-rings, and all so sly and secret from me-I shan't forget this in one night, you needn't think." Wilson ere long fell asleep, and anon his wife followed him in, at least, the temporary forgetfulness of her troubles. Our landlord opened his eyes with the dawn, feeling a little anxious to know whether his spouse had lost her desperation. He preferred to let the fever rage of its own accord, yet he was ready to excite it, if necessary, which could easily be done by the simple mention of either satin, watch, or ear-rings. She awoke. A glance satisfied him that all was right. She had not come out of the "fit." Breakfast over, Badger took his usual morning walk. Mrs. W--    did not happen to observe his departure. Reparing to his room, in advance of the chamber-maid, she found it in what appeared to her, the most shameful confusion, which cir- cumstance seemed to increase the "state of her mind." i     <pb n="262 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6456-00000138"/> 262       LUCY  BOSTON. What an awful-looking place," said she to herself. "I'll  see if I can't have somebody here that won't keep it looking like bedlam. I'll clear it mighty quick," and suiting the ac- tion to the word, up went the windows, out flew the chairs, table, wash-stand, looking-glass, and all the paraphernalia of Amaziah's quarters, in rapid succession, until she came to the bed. This unfortunately stuck fast in the window. In vain she applied all her strength to eject it, when in the height of desperation, retiring to the back part of the room and running with all her might headforemost against the hitherto unyielding mass, for once, as fate would have it, action and re-action were not equal. The bed went out and   so did Mrs. Wilson! It is. needless to add, that in that single catastrophe our landlord lost a wife -the cause of " woman's rights," a most zealous champion, while another table-tipper was born into the Spheres and some new Medium gained a guardian spirit.     <pb n="-263" xml:id="VAC6456-00000139"/>    CHAPTER XXI. "Tho spinsters in a desperate manner, Daring th' event to th' teeth, are all in uproar," 'Esiter were it To hurl the rooted mountain from its base, Than force the yoke of slavery on women Determined to be free." NEWS of the high-handed outrage perpetrated at the capi- tol, spread with the rapidity of lightning over the coun- try, wherever the telegraphic wires could conduct it.  The public prints - a few excepted - were loud with patriotic elo- quence in protestation against such daring innovations, and mobocratic, treasonable movements. Yet, generally, was there discoverable in their ostensible gravity, a lurking irony, leading one to doubt how far those organs really uttered the sentiments of the male public. Some, however, raised the alarm-cry of revolution, in good earnest, calling upon the people to awake to a sense of danger, to raise up the fallen State, restore order, law, government, and guard with sleepless eye and strong arm, their sacred and inalienable rights. Others, less conservative, scouted the idea of serious danger, or actual revolution, and laughed with deri- sion, if not with scorn, at all attempts to carry out this hair- (263)    <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6456-00000140"/> 264        LUCY   BOSTON. brained scheme of the feminine politicians. What the grounds either for serious apprehension on the one hand, or for merry- making on the other, the sequel will disclose. Leaving the Alarmists, haunted "With wild fantastic shapes of hideous ruin," to blow the tocsin of civil war, and the Humorists to indulge in exuberance of merriment, let us trace the operations of the Revolutionists, alias, the Reformers. Returned from their invasion of the Legislature, resolving to seize time by the c" forward top," and not be caught " nap- ping," they hastened to construct the requisite machinery, and entered upon the electioneering campaign, for the forthcoming crisis at the ballot box. State, county, town, and neighborhood corresponding com- mittees were organized, a political sinking fund instituted, a se- cret police ordained, and a campaign paper, styled The Broom, established at the capital, the first issue of which contained the following prospectus: The Broom, A weekly sheet, will be spread before the public, under the aus- pices of the "State Feminine Committee," and devoted to the cause of Woman's Rights in general, and the election of a fe- male state ticket in particular. Motto: On the carpetfor a clean sweep. We issue but a brief, though significant prospectus, in simply stating our object, and drawing the line of our policy. Our aim is revolution in Church, State and Kitchen, the over- throw of man-power and the enthronement of woman-power.   FOLLIES OF    TIlE XIXTH    CENTURY. 265 Our policy is boldly to takle the field and win the day, peace- fully if we can, forcibly if we must. The dust and mire of political slovenliness, accumulating for ages, covers and disgraces the social fabric. To us it belongs to sweep the boards, set things "to rights," and keep them in a condition of decency and order. The body politic is a mass of corruption, alive with loathsome vermin.  It is ours to renovate it, to strip off its filthy rags and invest it with purple and fine linen, making it the model of taste and comfort, no more to be the polluted carcass it is and has been, but pollution purified and trans- formed to the comeliness of queenly grace and beauty, adored and worshiped by the princes of the earth.

Tetrabune, Screamer, Seasons, Diary, Index--in short, all the political organs, like musty cobwebs, were brushed away by multitudes.  The campaign, opened by a bold stroke, was pushed with desperation, alike by force and stratagem; the more belligerent spirits leading the onslaught, and Sampson-like, with theirjaw bones, smiting, "L hip and thigh," all before them. Others, po- litical Delilahs, clipped the strength of veteran heroes, put out their eyes, and led them slaves with their apron strings. The whirlwind was in motion and gathering strength. The wave of popular excitement, lifted from the depths of passion, accumulated. Strange to say, by the major portion of the male democracy, the one was regarded as a mere whiff of air; the other but a bubble on the surface of the waters; a prank of nature, alike harmless and momentary. Nevertheless, gravely affecting themselves in extremities, the sons of the Empire State called a counter convention, ostensi- bly to countervail the revolution, but in reality as a caricature of the Albany affair. Inasmuch as the "strong-minded" had convened at the capital on the east, consonantly with the memorable vote, sending the men to the " opposite side of the house," Buffalo was indicated as the place of meeting. Al- bany and Buffalo in political and geographical antithesis; the "Dan and Beersheba" of this goodly State of promise, and typical of the extreme antagonisms of sexual humanity.

The day arrived. Clear rose the sun, yet clouds lurked upon the horizon, massive and threatening. Anon the King of Day turned "doughface," and withdrew his influence. Dark forms drove across the sky, like messengers in hot haste, discharging random drops, bullet-like, with ill-boding violence. Lake Erie looked gruff. Even the canal grew turbulent, while Niagara, emptying all its terrific thunder caverns, became au- dible to an incredible distance. Not only at the capital, but in far distant Gotham, the inhabitants, dismayed, felt the ground rock beneath their feet, and heard the portentous roar. Whisperings filled the air above, and ponderous rappings from below well nigh broke through the rib-crusted earth! Amid these unpropitious omens the free-men of the State, nothing daunted, poured into Buffalo by mammoth trains, the more numerous doubtless from the fact that, the Directors'of the various railways had, with patriotic magnanimity, granted free tickets to the whole state, an unheard of phenomenon in the age of monopoly!

Government journals - the heavy ordinance of political strife- captured one by one, by the rebels, were spiked or wheeled into line, and made to pour their "grape and canister," into the faces of the whiskered and mustached foe. Resistance was futile. The avalanche was in motion. No earthly power could stay its progress or avert its violence. No alternative remained but timely to flee or be crushed beneath the mountain mass. The campaign approached its crisis. The ides of November arrived. Liberty blew her trumpet upon the blast, and roused the dormant energies of her sons, who mustering all their availa- ble forces, rallied to the ballot-box. But they were anticipated. The daughters of Freedom had risen first and taken possession of the polls. Matrons of commanding influence, and maidens the most fascinating, were appointed runners and ticket pedlers, pitted against the partisans and bullies, old and young, of the administration. Every poor wight of a voter, who appeared to be in market, as he approached, was the signal for a rush, and the center of contest, frequently hot and sometimes on the point of coming to blows, but, ordinarily, the heroines came out of the squabble, superiors, and drew their prize into port.

A century has passed away since the immortal Declaration of Independence that pro- claimed a nation's birth, when our revolutionary ancestors cast off the yoke of a foreign tyrant, and at length it has come to light, that the fair daughters of America are enslaved by another, more iron-handed and oppressive. That tyrant is man. His days of rule and ruin, however, are at last num- bered with the things that were. Who can tell what a century may bring forth? Woman is in power! She is responsible for its use or abuse. New laws are to be formed. - The old framework of society is to be taken down and remodeled into a new and different struc- ture.

"She has taken occasion to introduce a Dinner Bill, a thing wholly foreign to the subject before the committee, and even were it in order, she has presented it in a state of absolute nu- dity, that is, without specifying any of its provisions -- Mrs. Live-well (interrupting).-"If the gentleman wishes to know my ; bill of fare,' I can inform him that it consists of the choicest meats and vegetables, pastry, fruits, confectionery, champagne and brandy." Mr. Goodmnan.--"Truly sumptuous. The ' Omnibus Dinner Bill.' Now, Mrs. Speakeress, of all political aphorisms, there is none more venerable than the one declaring that 'self-preser- vation is the first law of nature.?  Hence the honorable lady's 'bill' which she has had the audacity to thrust into the teeth, with the intention of cramming down the throat of this house, is both suicidal and unconstitutional, for who, that is at all versed in the theory of digestion, does not know that to sur- feit an empty stomach is nothing less than a debauch?  It is laying an unjust tariff upon the gastric functions, a method of taxation, in direct violation of laws as old as humanity itself. "Such, Mrs. Speakeress, is this 'Omnibus Dinner Bill,' a most voracious bill, conceived in rapacity, and brought forth with greediness, calculated to -induce apoplexy on the one hand, and breed a famine in the State, on the other, to exhaust the public treasury, and skeletonize the body politic."

"How he did seem to dive into their pockets." HE "spiritual" mania pervaded city, town and country, Strange to say, the spiritualists for th most part adhered to the "old fogy' school, and were content to plod along the beaten path of the rapping, writing and seeing Mediums. This may not have been altogether their fault, since the spirits, for some wise purpose, no doubt, had seen fit to endow but a solitary individual with the miraculous gift of a spiritual nasal organ, the ne plus ultra, and only reliable Medium of communication with the Spheres- the real "swiftsure" line of conveyance between the universe of sense and the vapory realms of spirit; dom.  This, experience had. demonstrated most conclusively, as the reader will recollect. The Noseologist and his disciples regarded all other Mediums and their followers with scorn aind disgust. Professor Z. Socrates Nozzleman maintained his just ascen- dency as the greatest among all the great lights of spiritualism; the Jupiter, or rather the central Sun of the system. His satellites were numerous, whose axis of motion and center of gravity all lay within the circle of his capacious nostrils. Hence his influence within the limits of his own L orbit " was supreme and arbi- trary. In this connection; we cannot fail to notice the singular (288)   r .

For instance-he smelt that brother Pliable must give him fifty dollars, and it was forthcoming, at any sacrifice. Our "Smeller was in want of a certain horse valued at a hundred and fifty dollars. When seeking the owner, and ostensibly under the promptings of benevolence, he addressed him thus- "'Brother Soft, I am here to let thee know that thy valuable horseis diseased, and will shortly die, unless he fall into my hands. Thou knowest, brother Soft, that I do not covet thy horse, but rather than thou shouldest lose him and suffer a total loss, the Spirits direct me to be just, and give thee the liberal price of forty dollars and save the life of the animal. So bring him hither speedily, and make sure of thy money." Brother Soft, not hesitating between the skin of a dead beast and so great a sum, hastened to the pasture, brought and de- livered up the horse, rejoicing that he had saved forty dollars and the life of his noble "Bay." Professor Nozzleman was destitute of a family carriage. Sister Marvel, residing some three miles distant, had a new one exactly to 'the professor's taste, or rather to his smell. So mounting his splendid Bay, with whip and spur, he set off at full speed for sister'Marvel's. Like a pointer on the scent, descrying in the distance the coveted vehicle before the door, he bent forward with all his might, and came dashing up to the gate, his horse-covered with dust and foam, and himself-breath- less with agitation, just as the good woman of the house with her children were issuing to take a morning ride. 25    <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6456-00000154"/> 290        Lu UC Y BOSTON. "Sister Marvel! sister Marvel!" said- the smeller, with face and jesture the picture of terror, and voice sticking in his throat, "I - smelt that - thee- was--on the point of riding --out- and would--get killed by--that carriage. I've- got - here- in time - to save--thy life. Thou must never - ride - in it again.'" "Oh, bless you! bless you!" exclaimed sister Marvel, /   ^"you've saved our lives. We should've been dead before night. No other Medium could've told this. Spiritualism has snatched us from the jaws of destruction. Nobody can doubt now. ' Spiritualism ' --- its everything - its everything." A little rested, and sitting on his panting beast, our smelling Apostle related his feelings on first snuffing the sad news, and then apparently subsiding into a state of abstraction, with a melancholy look and an ominous shake of -the head, as if con- templating some future occurrence, uttered the exclamation, "That carriage! that carriage!" c, What must I do with it?" asked sister Marvel. I'll tell thee what thou must not do," replied the Medium, with a sigh; " thee or any of thy family must never set foot in it again, if thou wouldest not be dashed in pieces." "Would it be safe for you to use it? asked sister Marvel. "f I don't know till I consult the spirits," answered the wily Apostle. Whereupon ordering the horse to be detached and the wheels well blocked, he cautiously ascended, and seating himself for a short time, said with a smile -- "I scent there is no immediate danger to me, and that should any arise, I shall be advertised of it in due season." "Well," said the simple owner, with a heart full of gratitude,   FOLLIES   OF THE   XIXTII    CENTUaY. 291 a You are welcome to the carriage and the harness too, if you want it, and any thing else I have, for you have saved me and my family." "I do not foresmell any immediate harm to thee from the harness, but as you might, run a risk in using it, perhaps it will be safest for me to take it," said the Medium. [Sister Marvel cheerfully acquiesced, not only, but superadded heartfelt thanks for her timely rescue. Our Medium Apostle was now fashionably equipaged. At- taching his splendid Bay to his beautiful carriage, he returned home in style and comfort, having promised sister Marvel that not a moment should be lost in giving her notice, should any accident be about to overtake her again. The reader has not as yet been made acquainted with the personal character and genealogy of the Prime Medium of the age and Arch Apostle of Spiritualism. Perhaps some would like to add his daguerreotype to their picture gallery. He was in the neighborhood of forty years of age, of middle stature - hair sandy and unsheared, hanging down his should- ers--beard patriarchal - eyes small, gray, sharp and deep set in his head; nose the leading feature of the profile, hugely occu- pying the foreground - altogether sui generis, of true yankee extraction -was a wandering planet, a universal itinerant, had contrived many ways to get a living by his wits, but with in- different success, till, fortunately, his nasal qualities were brought into requisition. Sly, shrewd, cunning, he could lay his plans ingeniously, and promote them prosperously, until some novel idea would drive him off tangent-wise into some new scheme. In short, he belonged to that' class who are    <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6456-00000155"/> 292        LUCY   BOSTON. unwilling to ' let well enough alone," to use a homely adage. He had finally struck a rich vein, and made a permanent " hit," had he not, like those of his class, sought to grasp all within his reach. Moved by the spirit of lucre, he set himself up as general Executor for all his followers, inspiring them with the belief that it was wholly unnecessary to make a will, as in case of demise, their spirits could, by personal communication, direct him as to the disposition of their property, from time to time, thereby retaining the oversight of their temporal affairs as really as when in the flesh. Besides, the method proposed, possessed this important advantage :I In the Spirit-Land where there is ample time for reflection and self-review, where all things appear in their true light, and can be clearly contem- plated in their intrinsic character and every possible bearing, they would be prepared to dispose of their earthly estates far more safely and wisely than it was in their power to have done previous to their departure. Our Spiritual Executor assured them likewise that should he happen to be taken away, some one or more of his descend- ants would succeed to his Pwers, and the business be trans- acted by them equally as well as by himself. Most fortuitous discovery! A thrifty branch among the off-shoots of Spirit- ualism, and promising to bear abundant fruit! The believers hailed it with jubilee. Indeed, what child of Adam could have the obstinacy to reject a scheme of such transcendent utility and so obviously in harmony with the dictates of human nature? Only let this perfection of Spiritualism be univer- sally adopted, and the " empty void" of yielding up the " things   FOLLIES OFS    THE  XIXTH   CENTURY. 293 of time and sense" is filled. The dreadful chasm between Earth and the Spheres is bridged. Farewell to the iron-fisted law of hereditaments and the despotic fashion of testamentary bequests, by which past generations have suffered their goods to be wrenched from their grasp and parceled out- to their pos- terity. Henceforth, every passenger to the Spirit World con- veys with hint all right and title to his temporal estate, both personal and real, holding it in fee simple, not only while " grass grows and water runs," but while human nature lasts and the "Spheres" revolve. Auspicious era! Ultimatum most glo- rious of the great law of spiritual development! Think of it, reader, and exult. What a " manifest destiny!"  Spirits are no longer the meager ghosts they have been, cut off from their worldly possessions and sent away into limbo like outlaws and bankrupts, but retired capitalists; the real upper-tendom- operators on "Change" --proprietors of the soil with all its incumbrances, of this mundane territory, by actual title, or holding under bond and mortgage, while the Mediums are their agents on commission, and to whom is allowed a very liberal per centage. At the head of this class of communicators stood, as we have seen, Professor Nozzleman. Though in moderate circum- stances previous to his promotion by his spiritual employers, he had " demonstrated" himself into a handsome property. His disciples multiplied. Some of them occasionally de- clared they " smelt a rat," but their smeller-in-chief assured them it could not be spiritual effluvia, and so he nosed them into the belief of his infallibility. History, ancient or modern, furnishes no example of one. * *-   25*    <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6456-00000156"/> 294        LucY BOSTON. man-power so absolute as that of Z. Socrates Nozzleman. Here was a spiritual hierarchy with a vengeance, under the sway of this chief Apostle. He levied weekly contributions upon each disciple male and female, and which were cheerfully paid to help forward " the good cause." As we have before remarked, many people remained in the dark, in relation to the latest improvements in the science and art of Spiritualism. Even men occupying "high places" in our national synagogue; judges, professors and statesmen, law- yers, doctors and generals, were following in the wake of the rappers, writers and seers. The ancient city of Gotham, chris- tened New York, N. S., proverbial for its fastness in every- thing, teemed with Mediums of the " old school." Spiritual Noseology had not as yet been discovered nor introduced there, which circumstance is evidence that the most truthful spirits, eschewing the most populous towns, frequent the " rural dis- tricts." In this instance, at least, the great metropolis was ,far behind our far-famed country village. I f    CHAPTER XXIV. "O, madam, Your sex is too imperious to rule; You are too busy and stirring to Be put in action; your curiosity Would do as much harm in a kingdom as A monkey in a glass shop; move and remove, Till you had broken all." "T  HE usual hour" found the members of the Legislature L  in their respective seats, the galleries crowded with spec- tators, and " lobby" full of anxious expectants. During the interim of adjournment, the Speakeress having consulted the Governess, they together condescended to exam- ine the constitution and register on the opening of legislative sessions, and thus gathered the necessary information for or- ganizing the-Senate and House.  They disdained to ask coun- sel of the Attorney-General, who happened to belong to the other gender, haying been elected previous to the "clean sweep," and whose term of office had not yet expired. The houses were at length organized, in a manner, by the appointment of various committees, a list of which we cannot stay to record, as proper brevity requires us to generalize. It is sufficiently specific to say, that in no instance was a male ap- (295)    <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6456-00000157"/> 296        L u C  BO ST O N. pointed chairman, nor even as a member of any committee of prominent importance. The session wore itself away, dragging its "slow length along," in the succession of buncome speeches, caucussing, and long adjournments. The main topic of discussion was the message, and particularly that portion relating to the marriage question. As might be expected, a subject of such vital importance to the welfare of the State, so radical in its nature and far-reach- ing in its results, called forth the strongest effort of the best tal- ent on the floor of the capitol. It is beyond the power of any re- porter to do even a moiety of justice to the ingenious and elo- quent speakers on both sides of the house. Miss Lovegood, of Cupidville, earned the notoriety of tak- ing the initiative, by introducing a very elaborate "Bill con- cerning Matrimony," and from which we extract the following sections: "The Governess shall appoint in each town three persons as a Board of Matrimonial Excise; said Board to consist solely of females of undoubted character, and not less than fifty nor more than eighty years of age;-that no marriage shall hereafter be lawful and binding upon any lady, unless sanctioned by said "Board of Excise," or a majority thereof.  That it shall be the prerogative of any female to make ap- plication. to any male to become her servant-the term " hus- band" to be expunged from the language, or made obsolete, save as a by-word and reproach. "That it be unlawful for any man over sixteen years of age to refuse said application, provided always the age of the fair   FOLLIES OF TIIE     XIXTH   CENTURY. 297 applicant be between fifteen and fifty-five years. In case two or more applications be made to the same person,.at the same time, the mother of the applicantee shall determine which of the fair applicants he shall accept. If he have no mother living, then his eldest sister. If he have no sister, it shall be his duty to accept the eldest applicant-provided again, that no peculiar reasons exist, to be certified by the 'Board of Excise.' "It shall be the duty of the excise-woman to see that fe- males are not imposed upon, and any want of fidelity in their official capacity shall subject them to severe penalties. "Immediately following the application,; the applicant shall send the applicantee to the Board of Excise, to notify them of said application, and unless they judge that positive'injury would result to the fair applicant, let them write 'yes,' on a card, and sign the same, as a marriage certificate; and any ap- plicantee refusing to become the servant of such applicant, holding said certificate, shall be adjudged guilty of a misde- meanor, and subject to such punishment as, in the discretion of the Board, he shall be deemed worthy. "In case the excise ladies should write 'No' on said card, the applicant, if in reality,  The sweet lady dotes, Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry, Upon the ----     man," shall have the right to appeal to the Governess, or may, at her option, compel the applicantee to retire to the distance of at least one hundred miles as a penalty for exciting in the fair ,     <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6456-00000158"/> 298        LUCY  BOSTON. applicant an undue and unreciprocated p);ission -there to re- main in 'durance vile,' until the fair applicant shall have made application for another servant, or certify that the delinquent's return would not infringe upon her 'RIGHTS.' "The sanction of this most wholesome, righteous law, shall be nothing short of extreme penalty for its slightest in- fringement." The minority, to a man, looked upon the bill with abhorrence as a most daring high-handed innovation, and were for quash- ing it at once. They would speedily have killed the monster at a blow; but that was inexpedient, if not impracticable. It would not do to legislate in a hurry. Precipitate action would not comport with the dignity of such a body, and the interests of the public, which require legislators to proceed with the greatest possible deliberation and caution. Besides, despatch is unstatesman-like and contrary to political orthodoxy. To hinder the ebullition of passion, and the display of eloquence, and the maneuvers of statesmanship, and the settlement of private quarrels, and the making of capital, would be highly impolitic, and at variance with the first principles of-democ- racy, not for a moment to be tolerated in any free government. Our State, next to our national Legislature, knew how to stand upon their constitutional and inalienable rights, and among them the freedom to speak as often, and as long, and on whatever subject they pleased. iMiss Lovegood, by the presentation of her famous "Marriage Bill," set the ball in motion and gave it impetus by a long and lusty speech, in which it was contended with great strength of 4*   X::1  ' FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH   CENTURY. 299 reasoning, and richness of illustration, that nature was per- verted, and society out of order. Woman," said she, A was not made for man, but man for woman. True, father Adam was formed before mother Eve. But things made first are not necessarily the best. Is it not indeed the reverse? Cannot a journeyman work better than a raw apprentice, and an old mechanic outdo them both? Be- "sides, man was composed of clay, and at best, he is nothing iX more than humanity in the rough, coarse earthenware, for com- mon use. But woman! whence and what is she? Not a clumsey vessel formed of mud. Man's composition in its most refined state was but the raw material for her mechanism. Hence she is not the mere pottery that man is, but the genuine porcelain and china in the palace of society. Or to speak figuratively, Nature in the gross assumes the masculine, but in the superfine, the feminine gender; plainly indicating that man was made to be under the woman, and woman to be over the man; he, as her slave, she, as his mistress." "Now, Mrs. Speakeress," continued the eloquent stateswo- man, "in the light of these self-evident truths, what is the I inevitable conclusion to which we are driven?

Yes, a very remarkable speech, at once historical, argumentative, philosophical and hortatory. But, madam, let us examine this 'stone ware' and cheeny' argument, as it may properly be christened. Itis admitted at the outset, by the honorable lady, that man was made first, but she denies it to be evidence of superiority -nay, she has the 'cheek' to argue that it proves his inferiority. Was there ever before such an abuse of facts and reason? What a miserable shift to cover a weak position? (Sensation - many of the female mem- bers making mouths at the speaker.) Stripped of the guise of sophistry, what is the naked truth on this subject? Why plainly, that man was created first, not only in the order of   FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CENTURY. 301 time, but also in the scale of endowments and authority. Let whoever doubts it turn to the anthropological record and read it in plain English. The learned lady also debates, not reasons, the same point on the score of mechanical improvement. As if Nature put out to a trade had wrought successivelya ap- prentice, journeyman -journey-woman rather--and mistress- mechanic.  "Now in the first place, the honorable lady's argument proves too much. It virtually predicates that Nature was originally imperfect, which amounts to an open impeachment of the handiwork of the great Architect of the universe. "But in the second place, the lady's reasoning proves noth- ing at all; for if Nature was apprenticed, let the honorable lady produce the indentures. But admit it. Grant, for argu- ments sake, that Nature in the march of artistic improvement, for any period however indefinite, and degree of perfection however great, accomplished the product .of woman. What then? Does the lady's conclusion follow? Not at all. May not a most skillful artisan turn off the most worthless job? Does it not indeed require the galvanic powers of the nineteenth century to turn pinch-beck and pewter into gold, twenty carats fine, with which to adorn the 'fashionables?' Can any short of the highest commercial dexterity enable a bankrupt to sport his 'coach and four' on other people's money? Is it not the extreme of chemical acuteness, from the bowels of the crucible, to furnish the demands of European and American aristocracy with artificial diamonds, rivaling in their luster the great 'Kohinoor' itself. And what, Mrs. Speaker, let me ask, as the climax of all, what short of the miraculous perfection of 26    <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6456-00000160"/> 302        LUCY   BOSTON. Yankee workmanship can surpass even Nature herself in the manufacture of white-oak cheese, wooden nutmegs and garden seeds! (Bursts of applause from the left-hisses from the right.) In allusion to the textural formation of the sexes, the honorable lady, with an air of triumph, is pleased to call man the stone-ware, and woman china. Man, stone-ware! Wo-  man, china! Very well, admit it.  The lady is exceedingly unfortunate in her positions. Is the china-set put to daily, common use?  Or is it not kept in choice reserve to be spread in the entertainment of company? I put it directly to the honorable lady herself, if this is not attested by her personal  knowledge and experience? I challenge the honorable mem-  beress to deny it. Well now, let us apply this in the form of syllogism:  Woman is china-ware: But china-ware is made for the entertainment of company-- Therefore woman was made for the entertainment of company. Again-To advance another link in the chain:  Company signifies visitors;- - But suitors are visitors- - Therefore suitors are company. "The adverse of the proposition, amounting to a reductio ad absurdum, is equally unfortunate for the lady's cause. Put in terms consonant with her own showing, Man is designed for the entertainment of company: But man is stone-ware; Therefore stone-ware is designed for the entertainment of company, A conclusion directly contrary to the nature of things, at least :, Ity   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH-CENTURY.         303 of stone and china, and the universal practice of. society, for the honorable lady will not affirm that pottery is the highest style of crockery ware; nay, she holds exactly the reverse. "Thus, Mrs. Speakeress, the power of absolute demonstration deals a fatal blow to this bill, which constitutes woman the court-er and man the court-ee, in all matrimonial alliances, and  which the honorable lady has so strenuously maintained as the pink of nuptial orthodoxy, when as we have seen in the light of reason and the nature of things -and hence constitution- ally considered - man is the suit-or and woman the suit-ee. "But, madam, there is another aspect of this measure, still more monstrous, if possible - I mean its illegality, "The honorable lady, in the course of her argument, declared that 'man's composition refined was but the raw material for woman's mechanism.' This, madam, sounds very fine from the lips of the eloquent memberess. But why did she not go fur- ther and state the modus operandi of the thing? The reason is obvious. She dare not do it. It would have been a death- blow to her bill. What, madam, are the facts in the case? Why undeniably these. Adam retired to rest, and while fast asleep, a rib was dislocated from his side, without his knowl- edge or consent, and converted into woman. "Now I take it, Mrs. Speakeress, that a man has a right to his own ribs wherever he can find them, as much so as to any other personal property whatever. But what is the ground assumed by the author and supporters of this bill? Why, madam, as if it were not enough for a man to have a portion of himself abstracted covertly, in the dark, he must now sub- mit to be seized bodily and held, vi et armis, by force and      I s    <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6456-00000161"/> 804        LUCY    BOSTON.

Are ladies -and  X gentlemen prepared to vote for a measure- so burglarious, so treasonable, so. absolutely monstrous? I trow not. (Great applause from the left- groans from the right.) I shall not attempt, madam, to follow the honorable lady in her eloquent and pathetic episode on cupids, arrows, crushed hearts, ambro- sial curls, whiskers, et cetera, all of which has about as much to do with the question before the house, as the 'Nebraska swindle,' or the 'annexation of Cuba.' With this exposi- tion of my sentiments, Mrs. Speakeress, I sit."  (Great and continued sensation in all quarters of the house.) Mrs, Pomnposo of the metropolis arose. -"Mrs. Speakeress, may it please your right honorable ladyship, I had beatified my sensorium ,ith the deeply-seated hope, that the extant measure which has absorbed so much of the time and talent of this legislative corporeity, would have made its transit without. antagonism, and thus have exonerated me from the onerous- ness of delivering my sentiments. But such is the unexpected and puissant opposition to this political enterprise, so antece-' dent in its conception, so righteous -in its provisions, and so magnificent in its consequences, that I dare not retrograde to my constituency, without exalting my voice in a sample of oratory. "Mrs. Speakeress, I have the perception of a line of argu- mentation as yet untraversed, and which I -covet the liberty and honor of demarcating. I mean the property argument.

I am anchored in the determination that my offspring, so nobly descended, so exquisitely beautiful and accomplished, shall never so tarnish their ancestral escutcheon as to become the 'ladies' of any thing less than billionaires. Mrs. Speakeress, I persist in my adhesiveness to this measure, in the light of public munificence." Mrs. Blunt of Stumptown, a bulky-looking matron, and though somewhat illiterate, contended with great natural force, in opposition to the bill. "Miss Spokesman," said bulky Mrs. Blunt, "I have brought twelve live boys upon airth --Reuben the oldest and Benny the littlest.

So jist hangtup yer fiddle about this 'ere bill." Honorable Mrs. Blunt subsided heavily into her seat, amid hisses, applause and laughter. It is useless to attempt to follow up the multifarious, lengthy and heated discussion of this measure, attempted to be sprung upon the Legislature and saddled on the commonwealth, but which was staved off most vigorously, by all the means within the constitutional reach of the "old schools." 3ut the "strong-minded" had fairly passed the rubicon, and now they pushed the " war into the enemies country." Amid secret caucusing, buncome speeches, personal alterca- tions, and amorous episodes, the famous Marriage Bill con- sumed the entire session, to the exclusion of everything else. The hundredth day found the Council of State in secret session. Night closed upon the contest. Fierce and fiercer still grew the strife, when, as the town-clock tolled out the hour of twelve, the deed of darkness was done! The vote was taken and car- ried by the timely assistance of the doughfaces. The House adjourned.    <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6456-00000163"/> CHAPTER       XXV. '0 horror! horror! after this alliance, Let tigers match with hinds, and wolves with sheep; And every creature couple with its foe." "While other doublets deviate here and there, What secret handcuff binds that pretty pair?  Compactest couple! pressing side to side- Ah! the white bonnet--that reveals the bride." HUMANITY is pre-eminently the most progressive institu. tion of this nineteenth century. In all its ramifications of feeling, thought, and action, progress is the law.    Especially was this true of the "New Lights." In no direction did the demonstrations of reform make such rapid, far-reaching strides, as in the line of matrimony.    The "strong-minded"    had taken the initiati  by demolishing Hy- men's altar, cutting down the Idalian Groves, and destroying the " high places of marital idolatry," where the little-winged god, ever since the days of good mother Eve, was wont to prac- tice his skillful archery.  But this was merely the prelude. What the mundane sisterhood had begun, the lady spirits com- pleted. The sacred myrtle, planted in the hot-bed of radical- ism, in spite of the bleakness and frigidity of this terraqueous orb, by the artificial force of political horticulture and spiritual chemicals, extended   its roots into the more genial soil, and 308   FOLLIES OP    THE  XIXTH    CENTURY. 309 reached out its branches, gracefully waving, into the ambrosial atmosphere of the ever-sunny Zones. Spiritual Marriage or Free Love-ism was the highest pinna- cle in the upward progress of "development"- the Mont Blanc towering in solitary grandeur, whose brow dewy morn and blushingeve kiss first and last; whose hoary scalp, though storm swept and disheveled, is yet encircled with the eternal diadem of alternate clouds and sunshine, 'so ethereal, so fairy, "So softly blending, that the cheated eye Forgets on which is earth or which is heaven." The chief medium of this grand spiritual manifestation was the Legislature. The Spherical Fillibusters had conquered the annexation of Earth to the Zones. Carrying out legitimately the code of con- quest, they claimed for themselves at least a shatre in the coun- cils of state. Accordingly, seats were awarded to mell, bers firom the Spheres. Besides, thei capitol was enlarged by -the addition of a magnificent Chamber of Conference or Spiritual Star- Chamber, constructed exclusively for spiritual caucusing, and the reception and transmission of commullications by spiritual telegraph, express, and private nlessengers. Unparalleled was the galaxy of Spherical Representatives. Queen Elizabeth, Empress Catherine, Queen of Sheba, Jezebel, Queen Dido, Queen Mab, in short, the whole troop of " strong- minded" magnates from remotest antiquity, downwards. Among the r/doSgfaces, or, to use a mnore charitable term, the inmlress/iblfs, that is to sfly, the adherents of the new administra- tion, Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, Dr. Franklin, John Ran-    <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6456-00000164"/> 810        LUCY  BOSTON. dolph, Lord Bacon, Cicero, Swedenborg, King Solomon, Moses Davy Crockett, Lorenzo Dowe, and Joe Smith, all of whom, ;i with numerous others of the same "stripe," held seats in the  Legislature through their respective Mediums. Venus and Cupid surrounded by the Muses, with troops of  Nymphs and Graces, thronged the lobbies and galleries.   Ia The Spirituals were decidedly the Lyons and Lyonesses of i both Houses, and "crushed out" every thing that opposed them: The Matrimonial Bill had been passed in the gross. It re- mained to be refined and sublimated into Spiritual Marriage and Free Love-ism, by way of progressive amendment. It was. not enough to disfranchise the Lords of Creation matrimonially, and allow their fair oppressors the right of choosing a solitary companion and compelling him to submit to the conjugal yoke, howmuchsoever repugnant to his feelings, his tastes, or his affinities. The most important, spiritual, and holy of all human institutions, both in respect to its intrinsic character and extrinsic results, could not be left in so crude a form -worthy only of pagans the most benighted and undeveloped. The honor of the sex, the welfare of the race, and the glory of Spiritualism, demanded its all-perfect consummation in the doctrine and pracm 'tice of Free Love. Free Love-ism! Spiritual Marriage! Reader, do you ,un- aerstand and appreciate its import? Let the advocates of the highly-progressed " institution" expound it. "Marriage is the law of heaven; the marriage of the spirit is the only marriage to abide in any condition. The marriage institution of man is wrong, and must be annulled ere the race is redeemed.   POLtL  ES OF  THit  XIXTI   CENTURY. 3" "All mankind were created male and female, in pairs, per- fectly mated. The male generally comes upon the earth first, and is older, by few or many years (the difference being gene- rally from five to twenty years); and they are generally located near each other, so that, if circumstances be favorable they can meet and be united. "Unless divinely attracted to each other and conjoined in eternal truth, no marriage can be rightly celebrated, and none other will prove ought but miserable. As there can be but one proper marriage, so there can only be one marriage on the earth. Man and woman drawn together by the moral interior of their natures, and driven onwards from the bosom of the Father to the eternities, shall be united to the eternities and never severed. Marriage not thus consummated, will exist but for a time, but when eternity breaks upon our race, every man and every woman shall see his and her own to be united for- ever. "Free Love is like the outgushing of water that bubbles from out the fountain to kiss the morning air, - that gives itself to its own in holy marriage, free only from-the despotism of man- nerism, and from care of the thoughts and opinions of an un- righteous society." Or, to be more specific, if we rightly comprehend it, Free Love is essentially and solely a spherical element-one of the fundamental spiritual harmonies - a primordial inseparability of the eternities - a primogenial coefficient of the supersensible Zones--a cognate principle of original materiality, flowing lineally towards matrimonial, social, and moral consonance in the universal and eternalflux of things. I!    <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6456-00000165"/> 312    i    LUCY    BOSTON.  In conformity with, or more logieally speaking, coexistent   ; and inseparable, if not identical with this ante-cosmological or X pre-existent basis, Free Love exists and springs -the ideal and . the actual, the simple ontological and complex phenomenal-- spirito-material entity ' unindividuated," or spiricity in the lump, radiating into individualities, sensific, rational and moral,  or spiricity "individuated," which individuations in turn col-  - 0 lapse into inseparability, or spiricity perfection---so that conditional plurality becomes absolute singularity; that is to say, abstract duality contracts into substantial, conscious unity  and again concrete dualism absorbs and terminates itself in su-  X pra-spiritual totality!" To make it still more perspicuous, if possible,.let us resort to a different terminology. All personal identities are distinguishable into sexual indi- vidualities. These individualities possess original conforma- tions differing respectively from each other, in endless, wide, q and infinitessimal variety, yet under the plastic force of dualistic law, resolving themselves spontaneously into duads or counter- parts -intellectual and moral, physical, affectional and connu- bial duplicates, bating the gender. Thus in the development of infinite disagreement is mani- fested finite agreement--amid endless repulsions, individual polarities attracted to the point of magnetic unitr, by which   X limited inherence, coherence, and dependence, out-crop into personal, absolute, and universal independence. In other words, throughout the heterogeneous external conglomeration of hu- manity in the " form," there is the development of pre-existent, antithetieal sexualities --spiritual nebulce which permeated   FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH   CENTURY. 313 and surcharged with the essence of elective affinity, mutually gravitate, meet and cohere into conjugal synthesis, in which        ; process subjective affection gushes spontaneously into objective      ] activity, hastening to and terminating in the grand ultimatum, the ne plus ultra development of unalloyed s2iricity! In fine, to render the whole thing transparent to even the opaque sense of the most undeveloped mortals, we have only to add, that Free Love is a pre-existent cause of which true matrimonial alliance is the present and post-existent effect, in the direct progression of antecedent and consequent--the a posteriori manifestation being dependent upon and governed by the a priori fitness, whereby the physical, metaphysical, moral and social economy is conditioned, developed and subordinated by the spiritual. Such is the rationale of Free Love, or spiritual husband- and-wife-ism; the new and highly advanced theory of byme- Deal aesthetics, or the feelinlg of the beautiful and the true, the symp'honious and the beatific, constituting the clairvoyance of the heart, by which correspondent nuptial instincts recognize i' each other, and at first glance, according to a pre-established harmony, meet and coalesce in the most affectionate embrace! A bill embracing such principles, so dissimilar and antago- nistic to the views and time-established custom of all civilized nations, was, to say the least of it, a remarkable novelty in the history of political science. Public opinion denounced it in unmeasured terms, not only as delusion and folly, but the flood- gate of iniquity, yet was it put forth endorsed by all the Spir- ituals as the forerunner and glad earnest of the millennium. What if the people were not rife for the measure? Wha7t if society had notksufficiently progressed to appreciate and wel- 27    <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6456-00000166"/> 814         LtCY   BOSTON. come it? What if it did materially conflict with the memoras : ble Marriage Bill previously passed, and which was considered the ultimatum, the final and perpetual settlement of the great question? Development must progress. Leading spirits de- veloped so far in advance of the age can not wait the tardy movement of rudimental mortals. Legal landmarks, in com-  mon with every thing else, must yield to the high swelling, on- rushing current of Progress. Long and heated was the controversy between the Sphericals and the most radical of the "strong-minded" mundaneans,.on this fundamental and very delicate topic; the latter party taking the broad ground without modification or compromise, that in no instance had man any right whatever to take the lead in the science and art of matrimony, in any of its phases, either of courtship, wedlock or domestic rule. But the Sphereites were by no means disposed to succomb to the rudimentals, for spirits can be tenacious as well as mortals in the flesh. Indeed the higher the degree of spiricity the greater its independence, a manifestation which might easily be, and doubtless often is, construed into obstinacy by those less developed. Party spirit ran high. Hot and hotter grew the contest, until argument gave place to personalities, zeal to animosity, threats to violence. Slung-shot, bowie knives, and revolvers, material and spiritual, were brandished profusely, by the fiery legislative gladiators, foremost and fiercest among whom, was Joe Smith, the doughty champion of polygamy, and for his matchless eminence surnamed the Mighty Joe.  I ' Challenges to mortal combat were given and accepted. But   F'tLLirES .o   TH:E XIXTH    CENTURY. 815 the "authorities" threatenzed to interfere, the political sages and master spirits interposed a comnpromise, the "code of honor" received the go-by, all insults were mutually pocketed, and the Free Love Bill progressed. In prospect, the domestic economy revised, improved, and enlarged, was committed to the supervision and control of the Zones. The crisis was regarded as passed. Although not fully de- veloped in form, by positive, legal enactment, yet spiritually, and to all intents and purposes, Free-wifc-and-husband-ism was the law of the land. Behold now the fruits of political reform! Myrtle boughs waved over the heads, rosebuds, phlox, and jonquils--elo- quent symbols-flourished in the bosoms and button-holes of the spiritual members, and carrier doves with celestial plu- mage fluttered and cooed from desk to desk. Free Love manifested itself in the fusion of the hitherto dis- cordant and antagonistic, elements of both Houses. 5Members began respectively and dualistically to discover their reciprocal internal congeniality and aptitude, so that ere long was scarcely to- be found a representative without a spiritual companion. Nor were the developments of this tremendous stride in the onward march of progress limited by the walls of the capitol, or the bounds of the legislature. . The reform spread like wild- fire. lEverywhere spirits were busy as bees, in promoting the due operation of the about-to-be new enactment.  Young men and naidens, bachelors and spinsters with blood '" caked and cold," felt the inward warmth and motions of Free Love. Hus- bands and wives discovered, to their astonishment and regret, that they were mismatched --in-truth ,they were never matched o    <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6456-00000167"/> 816         LUCY  BOSTON.' at all--being destitute of the requisites of true marriage, that is, neither inherently adapted to each other, nor coherently and divinely attracted, and consequently not " conjoined in eternal truth."    How unlike genuine spiritual marriage, in which not merely the artificial ligaments of legislation and custom harness together the parties in external companionship like drautght- animals, but where above and antecedent to human convention- alities, spirit embraces spirit in sweet elective affinity, and the affections, instead of being either periodicallyor permanently at loggerheads, are spiritually dovetailed and glued together in perfect and indissoluble union, at once demonstrating the beauty and the genius of pure matrimonial statics and dynamics ! Witness the happy doublet, unattended by priest or squire, who, like heartless mercenaries, for the sake of the fees, yolke in mock wedlock those who, from equally mercenary or other- wise unworthy motives, consent to the farcial perform-lnce - witness, we say, the happy doublet as in spontaneous coljunc- tion they step forth, hand in hand, heart in heart, twain in one, and recite in concert the formula of spiritual marriage. "Have you seen the morning       sunbeam   kiss the opening blossom ?  Thus did our spirits meet and greet at the first in- terview;    and as the invisible elements of nature unite and blend in one harmonious impulse, so are our spirits affinitized into one accordant living force. Whoever are thus united by the eternal laws of affinity, naught has authority to separate. We thus introduce ourselves unto you in the relation of husband and wife." Could any thing short of the Spheres be so poetical, pictur- esque and  hyper-romantic?  What is it but the flower of   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH      CENTURY. 317 spiricity, the zenith of social development, the sublime climax  of domestic esthetics?

Shall we then-although the medium of prophetic history, yet as a chronicler in the "form," at best and of necessity but partially progressed-- shall we venture upon a theme so intensely and delicately ex- quisite, only to belittle and caricature it, with our rudimental goosequill? Ye gods and goddesses of Celestial Parnassus, save us the daring, presumptuous, sacrilegious thought! But if we may not tread 'with vulgar, rudimental feet upon the enchanted ground of that honeymoon, we may be permitted, as an author- ized historian, to follow in the trail of Mrs. Hardhead and gen- tleman for a short space, with pencil and note book. We modestly forbear, however, to extend our narrative, or push our researches within the sanctum-sanctorum of family privacy, notwithstanding the domestic archives would yield rare treasures, to enrich and adorn our page. The scene before the curtains is sufficiently indicative of what passed behind- them. But whatever else may have trans- pired there in relation to opinion and authority, there is no reasonable ground for the presumption 'that any altercations ever occurred, inasmuch as Mr. Hardhead privately, and on the hymenlal platform, publicly entered into bonds to keep the family peace; while Mrs. Hardhead very prudently reserved for herself, under perpetual guaranty, the right--and that an in- alienable one - of always consulting her own will and pleasure    <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6456-00000170"/> 822       LUCY  BOSTON. without dictation or interference from her minor half" and weaker one-quarter.

Only upon a solitary occasion -and that before the days of the honeymoon were ended- did it happen otherwise, when, under a sudden impulse occasioned by the expiring struggle for his manhood, Benny so far forgot himself as to venture the suggestion to his fair yoke-mate, that she had by far the longest end of the lever. "My dear Mrs. Hardhead," said he with an effort at manly independence, "if I do not misapprehend, you claim to hold the balance of power in everything appertaining to our co-part- nership." "Pray sir," responded she, "where should the balance of power lie, if not in the natural and legal head of our domestic and social commonwealth?  "Very true, Mrs. H-- , but who is the natural and legal head? That is the question." "That was the question, but it is not now, and what is more, sir, it never shall be." "But you seem imperative." "And you seem impertinent."   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTV      CENTURY. 323 "Ten thousand pardons, my dear Mrs. Hardhead, I meant not the slightest disrespect, but-hem--I-it -" "But - you - it - what?"

"'Spare the ' good book' such disrespectful epithets, Mrs H.," responded he; "it claims to be a divine revelation, and on very good grounds, it appears to me-at least, I am thinking better of it than I was." "Add I am thinking worse of it, if possible. Divine reve- lation! For pity's sake, inform me what makes you think it divine?" "It is so full of common sense." "So full of nonsense, more like.

As part and parcel of the honeymoon, Hon. Mrs. Hardhead and gentleman could by no means dispense with the bridal tour. Did not our prescribed limits forbid it, we should de- light to follow the illustrious pair, and take notes, which might easily be elaborated into the most interesting "Book of Travels."  Suffice it to say, Mrs. and Mr. Hardhead, wherever they went, were the "observed of all observers." As the pioneers of matrimonial reform, under the operation of the new mar- riage code, and the Hon. Lucinda being herself a princess among the magnates of the State, they were greeted all along their route with overwhelming congratulations. Their journey was a continuous fete. Chief of all, Governor Lucy honored them with a soirde magnificently grand.

Gov. Boston entertained the concourse with a Speech singu- larly appropriate to the occasion, and which was unanimously pronounced one of her most brilliant efforts. The Mermaid, through her Medium, followed in a neat strain of blank verse, with which, did it not appear invidious or partial, we should not fail to treat the reader. 28    <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6456-00000172"/> 326        LUCY  BOSTON. Time continued to progress, and so did Hon. Mrs. Hardhead and gentleman, she mainly by public harangues, to enlighten mankind,lat twenty-five cents a head, and he, as her "good man Friday," in the capacity of ticket-peddler and doorkeeper. But in matrimony, as in every thing else, the physical was destined to succumb to the spiritual. i Human' enactments could neither Aforestall, nor supplant, nor impede the uni- versal and higher law of development. In the 'ever onward operation of this law, the manifestation was evolved that no woman has any right to live with her husband, unless sheloves him spiritually as well as physically; that no man is under ob- ligation to live with his wife, unless he loves her spiritually as well as physically, and that whenever they may chance to meet another, whom they can love better, it is evidence conclusive that they are not spiritually united, and hence they are morally bound to forsake each other, and cleave to the newly-discovered object of their affection. Such abandonment - rno matter how often --it is equally their duty to practice, as long as they re- main in the form, that is to say, till they die, and are born into the Spheres. So simple, easy, and delightful a method of righting the wronged, of banishing inequalities, and securing equilibrium and harmony to the social system, was hailed with joy by multitudes of every class and condition, but by none more than those of upper-ten-dom. As under the physical organism of the a strong-minded" Marriage Law, Mr. Hardhead had been first of the victims led to the altar, so was he among the first to lead off the purely spiritual figure, leaving the Hon. Lucinda to look elsewhere for her spiritual servant. - '   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH       CENTURY. 327           Sf Rapidly did the Progressionists multiply, and infinite were the speculations, on all hands, in reference to this new and highly developed phase of spiricity.    i It is true as trite, that ' a single fact is worth a thousand theories," but where theory and facts correspond, they together are worth vastly more. Take an example, reader, and contem-       j plate it calmly. Mr. P--  was a gentleman of respectability and wealth, owning and occupying a beautiful villa on, the shore of the Hudson, where nature, in profusion, has mingled' beauty with sublimity. Art and science vied with nature, and lent all their embellishments to complete the scene of enchant- ment that bloomed around him. Partners with him in the en- joyment of his paradise, were the wife of his youth, a son, noble, generous, full of promise, and a daughter, just entering the bloom of womanhood, beautiful, virtuous, and loving. They were, altogether, a most lovely and happy family, al- though not, as yet, spiritually developed. But Spiritualism, all pervading and progressive, at length found its way into this domestic Eden, this home of peace, tranquillity, and innocence. Manifestations ensued, mysterious and convincing. The whole family, except Mrs. P--, became proselytes to the new faith, and the magnificent mansion was soon converted into a rendez- vous for the Progressionists, who styled themselves "Literals," for what reason it is not exactly clear. Mr.?  progressed with great rapidity to the attainment of a high degree of spiricity. As a consequence, his compan- ion was not congenial.

"I have had a new revelation," said lMr. P-- , one even- sing, to his " physical" companion, as they were taking their ac- customed walk in the garden. "Another revelation! And what is it, pray?" responded she, in a pleasant tone. "Why, madam, that we are not properly affinitized, and therefore we have never been, neither can we be, united in true marriage." "O, my husband!" exclaimed she, throwing her arms about his neck and bursting into a flood of tears. - "You are mistaken, I am not your husband, I belong to another," persisted he unmoved, and coolly endeavoring to dis- engage himself from her embrace. "Not my husband? - Not my husband? - Were not our souls united from the days of our youth? Did we not stand together at the holy altar and plight our vows as the man of God pronounced us husband and wife? And have we not lived together in fidelity and happiness? Are not our dear children the sweet pledges of our love? You are my husband, my own beloved; and I' am your wife by the laws of God and man, and nation's strongest, holiest ties."

Steadfast and immovable in the faith, without once looking back, he progressed, and taking his neighbor's wife as his spiritual corn-  panion, emigrated to the city of Mormon, the highest circle of the Rudimental Sphere, and where polygamy was inlfull blast.  Mrs.? -- , still lying in a state of helplessness, more like death than a swoon, was fortunately discovered by her children as they were returning from a ramble in the park. In the ut- most alarm and tender concern they succeeded in removing her to the house, where, by proper restoratives, she was at length able to answer the anxious inquiries of her children as to the occasion of her sudden illness. "Your poor father is deranged-- what will become of him -hasten, O my son, find him, bring him home again that we may care for and, if possible, restore him to reason." "Do not give yourself unnecessary trouble about father. His guardian spirit will guide and protect him a great deal better than I can," replied he with singular unconcern, his alarm having all at once ceased upon learning the cause of his mother's indisposition. "O my son! my son! what dreadful infatuation! How can it be? Where will it end?" exclaimed she, incapable of com- prehending sfh highly-developed spiricity. "Dear daughter," continued the disconsolate mother, "forgive your brother. He knows not what he says. Go yourself, my child.

We are indeed estranged, because there is a' want of harmony between us." "But are you not my own dear children, in whom my very soul is bound up?" "Brother and I are your children, it is true, but I am sorry to say we are not spiritual children." "Forbear, my child, forbear. I cannot comprehend you." "I mean you and father were never divinely nmrried. You could not' be, for you are not congenial. He is spiritual, you are rudimental, and that is why he has left you.

She called her name imploringly, but there was no answer. "Where is your sister?" inquired she of her son as he en- tered the room. "I cannot tell," was the careless answer. "But do you not know?" "If I did I would tell you." "Is she not at home?" "I presume she is." "Where?" "With :her spiritual husband." "She is not gone?" "Yes." "To return no more?"  "Not to remain."

It is only one case among thousands neces- sarily occurring, in the progressive economy of the supreme, deific law of Deyelopment. What if the Bible does denounce polygamy as an abomina- tion? Spiritualism is higher authority than the Bible. What though the Saviour has declared that" what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder?" Are not the spiritual- istic Rabbies greater than Jesus Christ? What if human laws are treated as a nullity? Spiritualism is a "law unto itself." What if society be disorganized? It is to construct a better system. What if youth and beauty are hastened to premature decay, and innocence and virtue perish? Is it not the intro- duction to higher scenes of enjoyment, a more exalted state of spiricity? What though God and religion, morality, civiliza- tion and civil government be repudiated as exploded humbugs? What though the brightest hopes be wrecked, hearts crushed, families ruined, and homes made desolate? What though envy and suspicion, distrust and jealousy, cupidity, lust, immorality, and crime, follow in the train of the "new philosophy," peo- pling alms-houses, insane asylums, penitentiaries, and the grave,  <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6456-00000176"/> 334         Lucy  BOSTON. with wretched victims? What are all these things but minor evils attendant upon a greater good, mere contingencies ne- cessarily inseparable with the eternal law of Development in its upward progress and expansion from  the physical to the spiritual, the rudimental to the supernal? Must not the old heavens pass away before the new can succeed; and can the old be demolished without a mighty crash? Then banished be all unbelief, and hushed every voice of com- plaint. But if scepticism will rave, if gross human nature does cry out against the developments of Spiritualism, what is it but the friction of materialism grinding its way into spiricity, hu- manity shaking off the form in its birth-struggle into the Spheres? :                      .

As Doct. Z. Socrates Nozzleman, holding grim Death at arm's length, was the all-healer of the bodies, so was Judge Addlehead the Saviour of the souls of men.

Before entering my teens, I       i CaA off parental despotism and, turned with loathing, and un- utterable hatred, from the fabulous religion, the puerile dog-      ! mas and sickish mythology of the Bible.  Delivered from the bondage of pious bigotry, superstition, and tyranny, I boldly unfurled the black flag oft infidelity and atheism.             -i I am now in the full bloom of womanhood, and a settled be- liever in the science of Modern Spritualism. My husband is wholly undeveloped and the children are treading in his foot- steps. I am satisfied there is a total want of affinity between me and them.

HONORED JUDGE:  Blessed with a sound mind and a good education, I have from my youth led the life of a philosopher, untrammeled by Christian dogmatism --giving myself up to the study of the constitution and laws of nature. By the process of philo- sophical, chemical, and logical analysis, I discovered nature to  be surrounded, permeated, generated, and in all its phenomena  identical with the inherent, self-existent, all-creative, and cc^i- trolling law of progressive development, which, by its own in- nate, independent energizing, from the latent nucleus of cha- otic nonenity, gradually expanded into symmetrical system in- organic and organic, material and spiritual of universal nature. I considered my name as immortalized by the profound discov- ery, and was about perfecting a spirito-mechanieal machine, at a vast expense of time and money, to prove and elucidate, be- yond the shadow of a doubt, the beauty and truthfulness of my theory, and for which I was on the point of applying for a patent, when, to my astonishment and consternation, I found myself anticipated. You announced yourself as the legitimate discoverer of the   FOLLIES OP THE    XIXTH   CENTURY. 343 New Philosophy, and in the glorious light of which it was re- vealed to me, that instead of being an originator in the fabri - cation of the true cosmological theory, I had only been the cho- sen medium of Bacon, Newton, Plato, Ptolomy, and other highly-progressed philosophers of the Spheres. Judge, enrol my name among your foremost disciples and coadjutors- ever on hand for a trip to the bright El Dorado, the golden Ophir of the Zones: The work goes bravely on.

DEAR ADDLEHEAD: Like you down below, we have incorporated up here the pro- gressive " institution" of Popular Lectures, and I have seized the first opportunity to put you on the course. We indeed have no lack of distinguished spirits of Our own Sphere, such as Bacon, Swedenborg, Newton, Shakspeare, Voltaire, and hosts of others who are abundantly qualified to instruct and delight the most sublimated and highly-developed audience. But here, as with you, "no prophet is without honor save in his own country," to use a mythological adage. Human nature in the Zones is the same as human nature in the "Rudimental Sphere." We saturmans have indeed progressed to a far higher state of .pir- icity, than you mundamans, yet we retain our leading original idiosyncrasies, one of which is the love of novelty. Hence, not-    <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6456-00000182"/> 846        Lucy  BOSTON.  withstanding there are lions, Bengal tigers, and giraffes, among us, in any quantity, yet having no "Elephant" in our natural history, the spirits are all on tiptoe with curiosity to  "see the Elephant." What are lions, Bengal tigers, and giraffes, roar, growl, and stretch as much as they may, to those who meet them every day? The multitude, even in Spiritdom, must and will see " the Animal," though he comes froim the comparatively undeveloped region'of the Zones. As to the item of expense for the trip, allow yourself no care.  I can easily get you checked as a a dead head" on the Celestial Air Line Express Railroad. So get us up something spicy, to tickle the palate of novelty. I will have you announced in all dailies as "the Elephant," par eminence. We will create a grand iush, raise the tickets to double price, and send you home loaded with "rocks." Yours harmoniously ;  ISCARIOT.    . P. S. Can't you engage Barnum for us?

Does a poor   FOLLIES OP THE XIXTH       CENTURY. 347 fellow, accidentally fallen overboard and ready to drown, whine, out to the bystanders, "Gentlemen, you are strangers to me, therefore please ex- cuse me for soliciting a little of your assistance in keeping my head above water?"No. He sings out " help I help!" with- out preface or apology. Now that's just my case, only a master-sight worse. It's cussed hot down here in this great boiling hell-pot of a place. There's not a sea that floats on the surface of this round world that I havn't sailed, not a storm ever blew that I couldn't weather. But I'm brought upon my beam ends at last. I can't navigate this fiery gulph, this subterranean Hell-Gate, full of rocks and whirlpdols, and covered with the thick fog of smoking brimstone. My father was an old voyager before me. I sailed under him eighteen years, studied the " old school" navigation from beginning to end and was as good a sailor as ever manned a helm or pulled at a rope. But dad was an old fogy, a regu- lar blue-skin. I was for progress, and set out on my own hook. I put upon the stocks and launched a new bottom after my own model. A finer-looting craft never floated. But she's gone to pieces upon the reefs of perdition. There's not a plank, broken spar, nor shred of rigging even to cling to. I'm sur- rounded by pirates, landsharks, and huge sea-serpents, writhing and hissing and spitting out black poison at me. Judge, I am fairly swamped. Even my sailor's pluck failed me, and I was ready to strike and go to the bottom,.when I chanced to spy the signal that you had descried my flag of distress. I want to get on deck again, but, shiver my timbers, if I can do it. Now just bring your spiritual life-boat, or fling down a ,N I      <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6456-00000183"/> 348        LUCY   BOSTON. rope to a poor fellow and help me out. It's getting around, down here, that you are the only pilot of skill and daring and good- will enough to venture amid the fiery breakers of damnation to save helpless castaways. Good luck to us. There's no end to the lost in this shoreless, bottomless, maelstroom of death.  You will have plenty of business, so ship a-hoy! round to! lower  your luff-tackle, and heave away, you brave old wrecker. UNHAPPY JACK. " 'I   ! i ,-               0-! i   CHAPTER XXVII. ( There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy." IN pursuance of Governor Lucy's recommendation, in her in- augural, a polytechnic was chartered by the Legislature, denominated "The Spiritual University," and placed on a munificent foundation, at the expense of government, not so much from charity as considerations of state policy. It was al- together a most princely institution, the course of study em- bracing every department of learning, and the Board of Instruc. tion consisting in the main,of native teachers from the Spheres, and prominent among them, Aristotle, L. L. D.; Socrates, D. D.; Plato, S. T. D.; Esculapius, M. B.; Cicero, L. L. D.; Moses, D. D., L. L. D.; \Lord Bacon, William Shakspeare, A M.; John Milton, A. B.; John Calvin, D. D., F. R. S.; Right Rev. St. Peter, S. T. P.; Right Hon. St. Paul, S. T. D., L. L. D., F. R. S., with a large number of under Professors and Tutors; in all, for versatility of genius and profundity of ac- quirement, by far the most' "talented " and " accomplished" Faculty in the whole country. Spiritual University was modeled after the old Peripatetic school, in which all instruction was conveyed by familiar con- versation or dialogue, affording at once the most facile, agreea- ble and ample method, for the impartation and acquisition of (349)                30     <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6456-00000184"/> 350        LUocY BOSTON. knowledge, inasmuch as it avoids the narrowness and restric- tion of prescribed text books, while it affords free and unlimited scope to the highest discursive faculties of both teacher and disciple, forming thus an element of vast utility in the science of education in general and pre-eminently so in its specific ap- plication to Spiritual University, where it was optional with the professors to dispense instruction separately or collectively by dissertation and direct colloquial discourse, or if for any reason they preferred it, to call forward at their pleasure, any of the spirits from either of the Spheres, and by familiar dialogue to develop the hidden stores of wisdom, as well as rectify the dog- mas of past ages, not only fofthe immediate instruction of the pupils, but the enlightenment and progress of the community at large.  See now, with what magic facility the old-fashioned bogus orthodoxy in science and art, philosophy and religion, was de- tected and replaced by the true coin.  John Calvin and Tom Paine, evoked from their respective planes of spiricity, appeared upon the boards in the following edifying colloquy: TOM: --" Well, friend John," shaking him heartily by the hand, "here we are on our old theater again. But how changed! It hardly looks like the same planet, so vastly has it progressed, since we were in the form."' CALVIN:- -"Yes, dear Tom, the development of the IRudi- - mental Sphere has been most wonderful. What a metamor- phosis! Mountains leveled- vallies raised -space annihilated - the earth overlaid and seas traversed with nerves of thought - the elements harnessed and made the ready; obedient, al-   FOLLIES   OF THE XIXTH    CENTURY. 351 most sentient, and voluntary messengers of intelligence! How mighty a leap forward of the law of progress!  TOM:-"But the propulsion, so sudden, rapid, and magnificently grand, has been no more remarkable in the gross material organism, than in the intellectual and moral." CALVIN: - "Very true. While there are doubtless no greater minds here now, than in our own day and generation, yet cultivated intellect is infinitely multiplied; and as educa- tion has developed the masses, it is emphatically the age of thought, reflection,- experiment - the reign of reason without faith. Hence your disciples have increased beyond measure. Never was infidelity, at once so rank, and rampant, and subtle, and prevalent, as at this present time, and unless arrested, it must inevitably reverse the order of progress and plunge hu- manity backward into the horrible pit of the most undeveloped materialism." TOM: -"Whaat! denominate me an infidel?" CALVIN:-"I mean that others called you so, and alas! there are not a few who stubbornly persist in repeating the ac- cusation." ToM-:-  I know that by my contemporaries in the form, generally, and by their descendants, whose orthodoxy is to be- lieve what their fathers before them believed, I am christened an infidel. And why?  Because I was a man of too much sense to be trammeled, hoodwinked, and )priestridden. An infidel! and why? Because I would not remain an inert clod when within me glowed the promethean fire of God-like spir- icity. Because I would not seal my lips with silence, when, through me, nature herself struggled for utterance. Because    <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6456-00000185"/> 352        Lucyi BOSTON.  the very core of Divinity in my heart of hearts would articulate eternal truth, from out the depths of undeveloped materialism. Because my eager spirit, hungering and thirsting for the illu- mination of superior spiricity, sought to escape from its chrys- alis, and, new fledged and unfettered, to soar away in immortal sunlight."                           CALVIN --"Understand me, dear Tom, that Ido not style  you an infidel. You were indeed a man of sense, though the  public pronounced you an insane fool; and not only were you  a man of sense, but a prodigy of wisdom, albeit the multitude,  in other words, the mob, denounced you as a vile, shameless,  impious,-blasphemous wretch; a moral pest, loathsome and ab-  horred alike in the sight of earth and the Zones. The trouble was, your philosophy, or more properly your spirituality, was too profound and luminous for the sensualism of the vulgar herd  to appreciate or comprehend. To you, it was self-evident truth, the bright coruscations of all luminous spiricity in which your towering, god-like soul progressed, while the very intensity of its brightness blinded and bewildered the mass of more unde-  veloped humanity, leaving them to wade in the quagmire of unbelief, and not a few to wallow in the deep and filthy slough of atheism. Not only do they repudiate, as you did, the dog- matisms, puerilities, and nonsense of Christianity, but unable  like you to penetrate with spirit-vision through the fog and darkness of formalism, the future is terra incognita, an im- penetrable, dread unknown. To them death is the all-life ex- tinguisher, instead of a new birth into the Spheres, and the grave, not an advanced stage of development in the career of endless progress, but the infinite black night of annihilation!"   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH       CENTURY. 853 TOM:- "I am not .to blame for that. If people will be deaf, and blind, and dumb, in spite of their senses, the fault does not lie at my door." CALVIN:-"  Truly spoken. You wrote in a style clear, nervous, and caustic enough, to give hearing to the deaf, eyes to the blind, and speech to the dumb. But your enemies say, you wrote in a bad spirit." TOM: - "I confess that my writings wear a tinge of se- verity. And how could I help it? I must develop myself. The law of progress, working out its destiny in and through me, must be obeyed. Think of my intellect towering above those around me. My head butted the stars. I was a giant among pigmies - a man among puppets- a spark of divinity surrounded by the gross rubbish of sensualism. The beings called men - what were they? Veriest automatons - unde- veloped earth-machines. Oh! how I loathed their groveling, cringing, pusillanimous submission to the yoke of Christianism, apparently unconscious of their undevelopment, and that sub- lime destiny ever beckoning them onward to the Zones. How it stirs my blood to think of it. Can you wonder that I spoke out? How could I smother the divinity within me and keep my light hid under a half bushel?"  CALVIN:- "Truth, Thomas, every word truth, and fully do I appreciate it. Had you not possessed the patience of Job, combined with the meekness of Moses, to quote a cant phrase of the pietists, how could you have refrained from im- printing your burning thoughts with a pen of steel, red hot, and dipped in the wormwood and gall of bitterness, boiled down <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6456-00000186"/> 354        LuCY   BOSTON.  to black lye in the fiery furnace of infidelity, the most con- firmed and intensely malignant,. TOMM:-"Right, John. Now you talk like a philosopher and a gentleman, in short, like a ' simon pure' spiritualist. How!! different from your old orthodoxy-your blue light--total de- pravity - whining repentance- slavish fear - divine decrees t -eternal hell and fury--you can and you can't, you shall  and you shant, and you-shall-be-damned-if-you-dontt creed. a Dont you see now, brother John, that with all my black-hearted  infidelity, and fiendish blasphemy, and foul. obscenity, as my  enemies termed it, I was nevertheless'infinitely above you all, on the score of intellectual and moral development. How I  looked down with scorn and contempt upon the whole world of - scientific dwarfs and Christian pagans, and abel of creeds, Catholic and Protestant, as in the strength and grandeur of my superiority, mental and moral, I soared aloft on the pinions of light, and sailed through the cloudless blue ether of the Spheres! And yet was I comparatively undeveloped - a fettered prisoner in the materiality of rudimentalism, groping in the dark-- longing and seeking for light, yet entangled in the horrible .  labyrinths of pagan midnight. Had Spiritualism then beamed J upon me in its present full-orbed glory, how my spirit, escaping , : from its cell, would have mounted to the highest plane of thought, ji and roamed the upper circles of spiricity!" . CALVIN:--- What a calamity to the cause of science and religion, what a deplorable loss to humanity itself, that you did not appear early in the eternal series of development. Had you only issued upon the stage of existence when time was young, iS   FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH   CENTURY. 355           how different would have been the history of the universe, and especially of earth!" a TOM:--  Yes.   It would not have remained as it did, through countless ages, dreary, lifeless, motionless, chaotic, but moulded into shape, symmetry, and harmony, it would, long ere this, have been far out of sight on the track of progress!" CALVIN: --  You do not mean, Thomas, to be understood, that prior to the phenomenon of your ad-vent in the form, the system of nature, or any part of it- the Rudimental Sphere, for instance - had no existence; that there was no sun, nor moon, nor stars$ neither vegetation nor inhabitant." TOM : -" What, Cal.'! are you not yet sufficiently progressed to understand the simplest elementary truths? I mean that, previous to the manifestation of myself and Spiritualism, the world was in' its rudimental state. There were the germs of form, life, activity, but they were not expanded. There re- posed, latent and undeveloped, the seeds of things, of vegeta- - v  bles, animals and men, the most forward of which had only sprouted, a few were in the bud, but none had advanced to the  maturity of the fruit or the blossom." CALVIN: -  ' You do not mean to say there were no ad- vanced phenomena ofe the human biological, intellectual and moral. What think you of Lord Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, Galileo, .and La Place; of Socrates and Plato; of Homer, Shaks-  peare, and Milton; of Napoleon and Washington; of King David, Solomon, St. Paul, and other like developments in the       i history of the Rudimental Sphere?"  TOM :-- "Now, John, are you really so ignorant still? Or do you mean to manifest antagonism to me, and introduce dis-    <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6456-00000187"/> 356        Lucy BOSTON. harmony into the Spheres. Beware, beware. Forget the old tricks you were up to when in the form. CALVIN:--  No, no, my dear Paine, we are in unity. There is not the slightest shade of discord between us. It is  not at all on my own account, that I appear thus to doubt or  cavil or query in any case, but for the enlightenment of the circle, and through it, of benighted mortals still dwelling in the form."                   :        I TOM :-"Well, Cal., I thought it unaccountably strange, if, with your present progression, you could have the face to cast  the faintest shadow of doubt upon the fact of my superior spiricity."                         s CALVIN:-  Doubt your transcendental enspherement in the uppermost circle? As soon might I doubt any other self- evident truth, the existence of the Spheres themselves, or the 'truthfulness of Spiritualism, for example.%  To evince my profound appreciation of your pre-eminence as the pioneer explorer of the Zones, as well as of the boundless wilds of science and philosophy, I was about to turn our dis- course upon the topic of your travels through the Spheres, that the world might reap the benefit of your adventures, and hail you benefactor of the race." TOM-:  A very timely suggestion, my dear Calvin, which. I have anticipated, and one that will afford me the opportunity of interesting and enriching the public with the fruits of my pilgrimage and discoveries. The great Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic and unwittingly run aground upon a New Continent in the Rudimental Sphere, while I have traveled- not a mere rivulet like the Atlantic but the shoteless and   FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CENTURY. 357  hitherto trackless ocean of Spiricity, and brought to light, not an insignificant speck of land like North America, but a New Earth and new Heavens. Columbus found himself so com- pletely eclipsed by the intelligent conception, the bold, daring, and transcendent success of my adventures, that, covered with chagrin and mortification, he has thrown aside his chart and compass in despair, and retired into obscurity, a disappointed man. But pardon me, my most magnanimous Cal., I perceive your eagerness to enter upon our colloquial disquisition. The welfare of our brethren in the form, the progress of humanity and Spiritualism, is hindered by our delay. Ask what ques- tions, propound what queries you choose, you will find me everywhere at home." CALVIN: --"Well, Thomas, to begin at the beginning; ex- pound to us in outline the grand fundamental theory of devel- opment."- To : -"That I can do in few words. Matter and spirit are but the phenomena or attributes - whether dormant or ac- tive, visible or invisible - of the Supreme Law of Development. This Law first reposed, the self-existent, all-creative Force, im- bosomed in illimitable blank space. All was the universal void of undevelopment. The period for manifestation arrived, when by spontaneous combustion the constituents of matter were evolved in atomic particles or nuclei, suspended inert and im- perceptible throughout the depths of boundless, silent, gloomy vacuity. This was the starting point of progress, or the Law of Development in active operation. And now the grand pro- cess of creation set forward. By the inherent, self-impelling force of attraction, drawing the particles of matter into organic    <pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6456-00000188"/> 358'       LUCY  BOSTON.  contact, friction was produced, which of necessity generated heat and light, or the principles of life and locomotion, and which, in the progress of development, have issued into all the endless manifestations of Nature, inanimate and animate, rudi- mental and spherical.  Or to speak in the more exact and scientific terms of the New Philosophy. "The Law of Development, the Law of De- velopment in Progression, organized the first Orb-Creation in form of appearing as one globular ovarium, which was the germ  of the terrestrial universe of universes; and within the globu- lar was the embryo of the external of the universal, impersonal creation, as one curvilinear ovarium; and within the curvilin- ear the germ of the external of the universal, personal, or intel- lectual creation, in form of one vortical ovarium."     X "In the beginning of the orb-formation, preparatory for man- formations, vehicles of Quickening Spirit into intellectual for- I mations, the universal concavity and the universal convexity,  were co-enfolded and encompassed in the universal Zodiac, and within the concavity was the visible disclosure unto the germ  of the Terrestrial."  CALVIN:- "Exceedingly lucid and satisfactory exposition  of a dark and knotty subject, friend Thomas. To couch the  same facts in the vulgar tongue of the Rudimental Sphere, I  suppose you would say that all the manifestations of matter and  spirit ascend in regular progression from inferior to superior  organisms, the superior being nothing more nor less than the  legitimate productions of the inferior, according to the law of  Nature, and not by the creative power of a personal God." To:-"Precisely so. Particles of matter dampened by   FOLLIES OF tHE    XIXTHX   CENTURY. 859 the moisture of the atmosphere exhaled from the face of the deep, and nurtured by the genial influence of light and heat -in other words, matter by the process of fermentation trans- formed itself into moving, living, feeling, organisms. A lump of mud progressed into a clam; the clam into a lobster; the lobster into a quadruped; the quadruped into a monkey; the monkey into a negro; the negro into a white man; the white man into a woman; and the woman into an angel." CALVIN: --"Sublime theory, and beautiful as sublime, in harmony with reason, common sense, and the nature of things; carrying with it its own demonstration, for how often do we meet with people who are exceedingly crabbed. So there are the mulish, the swinish, the snakish; the chicken-hearted, the lamb-like, the hawk-eyed, the brazen-faced; with block-heads, leather-heads, and so on, according to their respective pedigrees, or the biological channels through which they have been seve- rally developed. Especially is the fact notorious that in the genus honmo are multitudes of croakers, affording the strongest presumptive proof, at least, that a large share of mankind were originally but tadpoles, and are progressing into a higher and more sublimated species of human frogs. ToM : -"Exactly. Such is the true cosmogony for which I can vouch." CALVIN :-"But how could you fathom such depths of mystery?  ToM: -' :By the power of my:superior spiricity." CALVIN:-"Through what process? simply theorizing, or absolute demonstration, or both?" TOM: -"Neither - but byactual observation. My mission -'    <pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6456-00000189"/> 360        Lucy BOSTON. was discovery to know and reveal the hitherto unknown. No- thing daunted by the hugeness of the undertaking, with the New Philosophy as my chart and compass, I boldly struck out and followed the course of nature back to its source, looked off into chaos, penetrated the arcana of creation, and returned down the track of progress, scrutinizing most minutely, from beginning to end, the whole process of development." CALVIN --  You speak then from positive knowledge?" TOM: - "I speak from positive knowledge." CALVIN: - "'In relation to everything?" TOM: -"Yes, in relation to everything." CALVIN:- "Well, as a philosopher and eye-witness, you have unfolded the true theory of Creation. Now, as a theologian, define what God is." TOM:- "God is not a person, neither matter nor spirit, but a principle." CALVIN:- "Self-existent, or self-created?"  TOM:--"Self-created --the product of developed intelli- gence."  CALVIN :- "If the Deity be not a person, but only a prin- ciple, how should we be taught to pray?" TOM:- "Why thus. Oh, thou Universal Principle! thou omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent Abstraction! the self-cre- ated Creator, Preserver, and Benefactor, by which all things sprang spontaneously into existence, and in which they continue to progress! we recognize thee as the Almighty Law of Devel- opment, enstamped the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, and by whose operation all nature is advancing in the march of pro- gress. O,' thou most blessed Abstract Principle, save us from 4   FOLLIES OF THE    XIXTH   CENTURY. 361 the idol-worship of Christianity, the infidelity of the Bible, and the despotism of priestcraft. Bring us into harmony with the ' beautiful and the true' and enable us speedily to progress from the low lands of rudin,entalism to the heights of pure spiricity, where thy power and glory is manifested in the high- style of phenomena.

Next to numberless were the ailments that flesh, in time past, was unconscious "of being "heir to," and of which were furnished diagnosis and remedy, by a spiritual inspection of a lock of hair, and all for the simple sum of one dollar! Prescriptions inundated the community, from which numer-  ous individuals experienced a speedy cure, even before they were themselves aware of being diseased.  Other doctors, less famous, could detect disease when openly palpable, and treat it with tolerable skill, but their pathology and practice being of a more ordinary stamp, their utility was therefore not generally appreciated nor understood. It was an extremely mysterious theory, this crinopathy- and hence more scientific and satisfactory -holding as it did that all disorders in the human system manifested themselves fundamentally in the hair, for the reason that the skull was  sympathetically affected. 32               (373)    <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6456-00000197"/> 374         LUCY    BOSTON.

Although, without positive knowledge on the subject, we must nevertheless - believe, that the kind-hearted spirits could not suffer a fellow mortal to drag himself to the close of such a miserable existence, unrelieved, simply because he happened to be bald-headed. We might, therefore, safely anticipate the adoption of an expedient, in behalf of the hairless unfortunates, by a substitute lock clipped from the patient's wig! Nay, reader, down with your incredulity at this supposition, for is it not manifestly in keeping with the whole history of spiritual devel- opment? *  Nor is it unphilosophical. Because, spirits say, that all symptoms of disease tend to and locate themselves in. the hair. Now, symptoms are things.

They started with identical data, but reasoned adversely. Their di. agnosis was the same, their prognosis totally different. "We agree with the hatiropathists," said they, "that symptoms are things. But there cannot be a thing without substance, nor substance without gravity; therefore, disease is neyer sublimated in the apex, but always precipitated at the base of the system, from which it follows conclusively, that thei terminus of the symptoms is not the capitispilus, but the ungnis pedis pollicis, that is to SaY, not the hair of the cranium, but the nail of the great toe!" This theory, more philosophical, marked by greater -common sense, and resting on a deeper foundation than its antagonism, was at once in the ascendant, speedily acquir- ing universal celebrity. The public prints carried to every in- valid in the land the happy intelligence, that a shaving from the nail of the great toe, sent by mail, accompanied with Two 'DOLLARS, postage paid! would convey an accurate knowledge of the disease and secure a prescription, which if faithfully folk lowed, according to directions, would inevitably work a perma- nent cure. Great was the demand for jack-knives, and many a poor wife pefformed secret amputations, cleaving the horny substance to the quick, after the "symptoms," at the imminent hazard of becoming a cripple, and the expense of her husband's best razor!

Among other employments which he had followed for a livelihood, in days gone by, was that of agent for a patent medicine. This professional advantagement furnished him an intimate knowledge of Anatomy and Physiology, which fortu- nately was now brought into play. Having naturally a keen eye in his head, and observing the universal ailibility of man- kind with their hankering after "spiritual" potions, in the yearning of his bowels of pity, he decided on having a " run." Accordingly, a general meeting of the " circle " was convened, and having revealed to them many mysterious mysteries, Z. Socrates, with one hand 'on his breast, arid the other thrust to the bottom of his pocket, as if unconsciously feeling for a change," threw back his head, looking the picture of honest sagacity, and said- "Listen ye to me.

Hygeia stretched her scepter over the world. Disease fled away. Death stood aghast! And no marvel, for the subtle olfactories of our great Spiritopathist had ferreted out the fundamental principle, that all disorders in their normal origin and ab-normal process are conditioned and propagated by spiritual miasma, which was amply demonstrated by a course of the most nice and satisfac- tory experiment with his nasal organ, which served the capacity of a clairvoyant stethoscope, and whose delicate acuteness no essence, however attenuated or occult, could evade. The only thing now wanting to secure perpetual longevity to the race, and rob Old Mortality of his dues, was the inven- tion of a universal specific. This was readily furnished by the spiritual pharmacopoeia, and consisted in the quintessence of spiritual orders, sublimated to the point of indivisibility. It may puzzle the reader'to imagine how a volatility so infinitely attenuated could be obtained and confined for use. The pro- cess was simple. It was not indigenous, but exotic, a product of the Seventh Sphere. The spirits having expressed and volatilized it by a "' spiritual " apparatus, conveyed it by tele- graph to our chief physician, who resolving it by spiritual analysis into two kinds-one for internal, the other for exter- nal application, including surgery-confined it in proper quantities in miniature phials, which phials he scientifically   FOLLI ES OF THE XIXTII CENTURY. 879 labeled respectively Min.

The anti-spiritual portion of the community afflicted at the prospect of losing so valued a citizen and neighbor, besought the relatives of the victim to summon the aid of a regular physician, but in vain. The appeal was met only with indignity, by the spir- itualized kindred, who hoped " people would not trouble them- selves. The spirits probably understood what they were about, and needed no assistance from the quacks." Soon after the good man's decease, our Spiritopathic Medium, in his capacity of Executor, called upon the surviving com- panion and family, to inform them what the spirit of the de- parted wished to have done with the estate. "How glad I am, dear Doctor," said the cheerful widow, "that you have called upon us in our affliction. Yet it is'nt much after all, seeing we can communicate with him every day." "Your husband," said the Medium, " directs me to keep a watchful eye over his estate. My instructions are to convert the real and personal property into money, and then he will tell'me what to do with it. I have not the time to devote to this, but respect for my departed friend will not allow me to decline. Besides, I cannot bear to see the property squandered  I .   FOLLIES OF    THE  XIXTH   CENTURY. 883 from thee and thy children. There are notes and outstanding accounts, and money, which I must take for safe keeping, and apportion to thee from time to time as thy husband shall direct." The affectionate and obedient widow rejoiced at this mark of friendship, and forthwith the "private secretary" was ran- sacked, the Medium taking possession of all the " convertibles" on the spot, as sole administrator of the deceased. The notes and accounts were collected, at once, and the per- sonal chattels struck off at auction, the terms of sale being casCh. Nothing now remained unadjusted except the real estate, consisting of a fine village house and lot, with farm adjacent, and a tract of western land. This also the deceased ordered his spiritual agent to sell. Accordingly he struck a-bargain with a certain speculator, to whom he was to convey title on a given day and receive the purchase-money. Punctual at the appointed time, our Medium administrator appeared with conveyances in hand, duly sealed and signed as follows - IDAVID ABNER (deceased), ,iz          Per Z. SOCRATES NOZZLEMAN, M. D, Spiritual Agent. This singular autograph bore a kind of suspicious look to the scrutinizing eye of the purchaser, who refused to pay the money until the seller could produce a power of attorney a little more intelligible. The Spiritualists were indignant at the incredulity of this suspicious infidel, and assured him that if he would only meet with them  a single evening, it would be demonstrated before                     ,    <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6456-00000202"/> 384        LuJCY  BOSTON. his eyes, that the great professor Nozzleman was no impostor, but the bona fide agent of the deceased, and acting under his immediate direction and control. But the wary speculator stood in fear of a " trap," and the bargain was broken off. The widow and her family were not only "sold out" rather close, but kept on short allowance. -The Medium, however, declared that he disbursed is fast as his instructions allowed. The good wife was satisfied with this assurance, yet could not but think that her husband had grown very economical since becoming an inhabitant of the Spheres j nor could she conjecture for what he was hoarding his money, but she wisely concluded 'that he knew, and would direct everything to the best advantage, both for himself and family. The sudden death of so estimable and prominent a person as Mr. Abner, was of course somewhat widely circulated through the public prints, by which means the melancholy intelligence chanced to reach an absent son, and from whom the family had received frequent spiritual communications, furnishing conclu- sive evidence that he had passed to the Zones: in other words, that he was dead. On learning the decease of his father, Edward (for such was his name), in obedience to the promptings of filial and fraternal affection, hastened home with all practical dispatch. Extensive travel, with a close observation of men and things, had made him a competent judge of character. To his relatives, his return occasioned even greater surprise than the untimely death of his father. Spiritualism was, of course, the first topic introduced to Edward, by the family, Sand on which he expressed his opinion, respectfully and kindly,   FOLLIES OF    THE  XIXTH    CENTURY. 885 yet in terms so decided and caustic, as to fill them with grief, that a fond mother and affectionate sisters should experience such a greeting from a long absent son and brother. It was evening when Edward arrived. His mother-as- sistance was unnecessary--prepared him a meal so exceed. ingly coarse and scanty, as justly to excite in him a momentary look of surprise, and observing which, by way of apology, she said it was the best his father had afforded them lately, and besides, there was no place in the house for him-to lodge, but on the floor, as his father had ordered all the beds and bedding not in actual use to be sold. "How came father to be so poor?" inquired Edward. "O, he is not poor," answered the mother. "He is worth twenty thousand dollars, and communicates to Doctor Z. Soc- rates Nozzleman how to dispose of it." t Did father leave a will?" "Ono, my son. His spirit communicates daily with our Medium, as his -sole administrator and agent. He told the Doctor to take the property and turn it into money, and he would then give him directions how to use it. "Who&amp;is this Doctor Z. Socrates Nozzleman, as you call him?" "Why! is it possible you have never heard of him?  He is the Great Smelling Medium, olfactory physician, surgeon, and professor of Puffemburg Hospital, appointed by the spirits themselves. We are to have a circle here to-night, and you can talk with-your father just as freely as I do with you." "Professor Z. Socrates holds possession of the property, does he?" 33    <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6456-00000203"/> 386        LUY   BoSTON. "Yes, father's spirit told him to take it." "How do you know it did?" a Because the Doctor says so. Besides, father's spirit tells us the same, and that we must always look up to his agent as our guardian and- protector. Don't you want to see our Me- dium, Edward? He will be here directly." ( Guess, you must excuse me. I will call on some of my old acquaintances this evening. I couldn't very. well enjoy your ' circle,' as you term it, if I should stay.-- When did father tell your Medium to take the property?" said Edward, musingly. , O, right away after he died, or rather after he emigrated to the Zone s, and he tells him something about it almost every day." - And this is what you call ' spiritual manifestations 2' " rejoined Edward, rising to depart. Mother and sister besought him to remain at the circle, but gently resisting their entreaties, and promising to return in the morning, he bade them an affectionate "' good night." Edward sought his old associates, a part of whom, as he was pleased to find, were anti-spiritualists, and who made him ac- quainted with the exact position of affairs. Edward had seen too much of the world, mingled with and read too many characters, not to fathom this whole business at a glance. To him, Z. Socrates Nozzleman was no enigma. His line of duty was plain; nor did he hesitate promptly to pursue it, but wisely concluded to seek no interview with his Spiritualship, till having first taken proper measures to estab- lish a little higher earthly claim to his father's estate, than the Medium had produced from the Spheres.   FOLLIES OP     THE XIXTH    CENTURY. 387 The circle, headed by Professor Nozzleman, convened at the widow's, and to whom she announced the unexpected arrival of her son. The professor was taken aback by the startling news. He evidently smelt something " in the wind," being ex- ceedingly inquisitive as to the character of her son; his age, ,intentions, place of residence, how long he was going to stay, et- cetera, expressing also undue anxiety to see him. Learning from the widow the fact of his rank infidelity, on the score of Spiritualism, the unlooked-for heir was conse- quently any thing but a welcome visitor to the ghostly admin- istrator. Nevertheless, resolving to finish the game by a bold throw, he sought Edward early next morning, and addressed him thus: "Young man, thy father hath duly appointed me executor of his estate. He doth direct me from the Spirit-World, to pay thee one thousand dollars, and take from thee this receipt, in full. Here is thy money Lay it carefully away, and see that thou makest good use of it." "Please, excuse me, sir," replied Edward. {'The death of my beloved father bears heavily upon me. I feel too indisposed for the transaction of business just now." "The spirit of thy father ordereth me, that if thou refusest to comply, at this present time, never td pay thee a farthing,"     i said his Mediurinhip, in a tone of authority. "I am in no immediate want of money," responded Edward. "Be so good as to allow me time to become  a little more set- tiled. You shall then have my attention." Our Medium   deputy was foiled. Such coolness discomposed *"     <pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6456-00000204"/> 388         LUCY   BOSTON. him, and he departed not a little abruptly, with at least no abate- ment of his uneasiness. Edward at once laid the matter before the proper authorities, and Z. Socrates Nozzleman, Olfactory Medium, Spiritual M. D., K. Q. X., Professor of Puffemburg, and Arch Apostle of the Sphericals, was invited by the sheriff to take rooms at the "Grate Public Hotel," where he remained until the next sit- ting of the Supreme Court, when his spiritualship received an appointment in the State Prison Department for the term of ten years. Necessity, stern and inexorable, compelled him to resign his executorial office with large emoluments into the hands of Edward, who was thereupon duly appointed material administrator of his father's estate. We omitted to note the opportune arrival of the sheriff, a circumstance not only fortuitous but fortunate, as Z. Socrates, smelling so strongly something " in the wind," was preparing to take his departure, the coming night, for parts unknown, but he was a day too late. For once swift-footed justice got the start of his guardian spirit and cut off his escape. The spirits had failed him. He would have resorted to the more reliable intervention of his own legs for an alibi, but ma- terialism in the shape of iron fetters rendered it impracticable. The Spiritists, put thus to their trumps, concentrated their entire forces, and making a final rally, as the forlorn hope, in- voked all Spheredom for assistance, in this their last extremity, but not a ghost came to the rescue. On receiving sentence, the illustrious convict elevating his nasal organ, gave one tremendous snuff, and said, ,   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH       CENTURY. 389 "I smell that Spiritualism is a mighty big FIZZLE!  This was the final extinguisher. Funglehead had gone up! Nozzleman went down! The circles disbanded. Many of the more prominent members landed in the Mad-House, others in the Poor-House, the balance declaring they " never believed in it, but only attended to see what fools folks could make of themselves when they set out." Puffemburg was deserted. News of the grand finale of this comico-tragedy flew on electric wings over both continents. The Spheres deharmonized and detached from Earth, forsook their orbits, and wheeled away into the boundless void of an- nihilation, leaving our mundane orb to grind on as before! Thus ended Spiritualism at its fountain-head. We understand that a few smaller lights are yet practicing it, as the dying echo of an exploded h7unbug. 33*    <pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6456-00000205"/> CHAPTER XXIX. "Misplaced-in a wrong position--placed in an incongruous situation-out of one's proper sphere." - Noah Webster. THE representatives of the lady democracy of the Empire State were now carrying matters with a high feather at the capitol, aping other legislative bodies in the modifying, ab- rogation,and enactment of laws, respectively agreeable to their ambition, their pockets and their whims, and all under pretense of serving the best interests of their constituents. The early part of the session had been marked by much confusion, and almost the entire absence of any thing like leg- islative order and decorum. Personal abuse, and private scan- dal, bills legitimate and illegitimate - speeches long and short and on all conceivable subjects, save the one before the house, were the order- or more strictly speaking the disorder -of the day, and threatening to render abortive the object for which that body of congregated wisdom had assembled in council.  But while a majority of our lady rulers determined to rely solely upon their own resources, and as far as in them lay denied to the male sex any share or influence in public affairs, a few (390)   FOLLIES   OF  THE  XIXTH   CENTURY. 391 of the more sensible saw the necessity of profiting by the ex- perience and advice of the statesmen, so called. Accordingly husbands, fathers, and brothers were consulted in private, and under whose direction a new code of rules for the government of the Legislature, being drawn up, presented to that body, and after a stormy debate adopted, order gradu- ally grew out of confusion, and the Hall of State began to as- sume, in some degree, the aspect of parliamentary propriety. Yet one anomaly, somewhat incongruous and not easily ob- viated, still characterized the daily business of the session. Most of the female members were persons of middle age, and many of them mothers. The husbands of these prolific stateswomen, to be sure, were being rapidly initiated into the mysteries of the nursery. Not a few of them had already become such adepts in providing for the wants and sundry peculiarities of the "little responsibili- ties," as reflected the highest honor, not onlyon their training, but afforded incontestable evidence of their hitherto unsus- pected aptitude for the business. But it is an Adage, both aged and profound, that great occa- sions develop great talents. Yet, notwithstanding the re- markable proficiency of the fathers of the commonwealth in this their new and interesting occupation, one difficulty re- mained, which neither their patience nor their ingenuity could overcome; a want, in fact, which none but mothers could sup- ply. A supplement was therefore added to the " standing rules," setting apart an hour, twice during the day, in order that the future' hopes of the Republic might draw from the    <pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6456-00000206"/> 392        LUCy BOSTON. maternal breast that nutriment without which all governments whether male or female, would cease to exist. During these juvenile repasts the chambers were necessarily thrown open to the ingress of the masculine nurses, when the male loungers of the galleries and lobbies seized the opportunity of paying their respects to the " powers that be." It was usu- ally the hour of confusion let loose. Talking, laughing, flirting of dandies in petticoats, with co- quettes in pantaloons, squalling of infantiles, and scolding of mothers, together with sundry lectures to husbands on their behavior, presented to the impartial observer a scene which lacked something of that dignity for which we have been ac- customed to look'in the representative wisdom of a great and enlightened state. We have omitted to mention the fact that a change of dress, especially among the females, had now become nearly universal. There remained however a small minority, conservatives of their day and generation, who still clung to the habiliments of their mothers. Not so the men, but two classes of whom had adopted the female costume. The first from compulsion, by the force either of curtain lectures or the broomstick; the other, under the (to them) equally compulsory influence of the law of fashion, the latter class consisting mainly of the dandy and coxcomb. Many a brainless exquisite promenaded the streets rigged out in all the finery of the female habit of twenty years ago,* or the * The reader must bear in mind that we are dealing with events some twenty years in advance of the present.

Strictly speaking, these were not converts to the doctrine of "woman's rights," but merely converts to fashion. Almighty fashion! fit concomitant of the follies of the nineteenth cen- tury, and to whose capricious dictates, not only the dandy, but - if professor Porson may be credited, for integrity of poetic de- scription even Beelzebub himself renders allegiance. The politicians of the day to a man--woman we should have said -adopted the costume which in by-gone times had been considered the exclusive property of the male sex, but many of the younger class, with true female tenacity, still ad- hered to some of the fashions of the past age. For instance, with those who considered themselves the ton, that tasteful ad- dition to the female form, the bustle," was still a sine qua non. On the first introduction of this style of dress it came to be a serious question with connoisseurs, whether the article in- creased or diminished the grace and dignity of the masculine costume. We know not as it has ever been defined what Ho- garth meant by his "Line of Beauty," and while that ques- tion is mooted, some might be disposed to class the hump on the back of the camel and buffalo, or even the " human form divine," with the style of beauty and sublimity so much ad- mired in the bold outline of mountain scenery. At all events, though neither tailor nor mantua-maker, yet pretending to some taste in these matters, we look upoh it as the perfection of the "true sublime" and beautiful in female adornments. Suppose, reader, a lady wearing a close-fitting dress coat, a la Grimes, "all buttoned down before,"--but Nature is not a    <pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6456-00000207"/> 394        Lucy BOSTON. proper subject for criticism. Behold the reverse of the figure. Somewhere about mid-way, the dorsal column hugely jets the "Bustle!" whence the coat stands boldly off at an angle of some forty degrees, while from the verge of this projection the lapels fall gracefully, and like streamers "Wave in the west winds summer sighs," in a very becoming manner! We stated in the beginning, that our mission was not theo- retical but historical, not empty fiction nor philosophical dis- quisition, but simply a record of facts. Hence we disclaimed all speculation on the subject befor'e us, and whether this downfall of the hmighty and exaltation of the humble and the meek, was a blessing, or otherwise, we have not even expressed an opinion; nor are we about to deviate from the direct line of our narrative. Our female legislators were very much annoyed in some of their proceedings by lobby importunities and out-door influence. The Spiritualists of either sex, aware of the important service rendered by their order in elevating to power the dominant party, were especially clamorous for their reward, and with the peculiar self-denial of political parasites claimed the lion's share of the "spoils."  In fact, so numerous were the applicants of this class, that all the offices'in the gift of the Executive or the Legislature were as inadequate to their demands as would be the " five loaves and the two small fishes "-without the mir- acle-- to supply the beleaguering armies of Sevastopol. A few were well rewarded. Judge Addlehead, as a recom- pense for services rendered and in compliment to his high legal attainments in spiritual jurisprudence, was placed at the head of /   FOLLIES OF THE XIXTH       CENTURY. 395 the judiciary. Governor Longnat, made Secretary of State, soon fell into deep political discussion with an embassador firom the Spheres. Johnson David Anderson was appointed President i    of a Spiritual College already in successful operation; and Fillip i.   Waddell, professor of Oratory in the same. Professor Krewsy- i    bull, superintendent of Negro Affairs. His talented wife was ;,   sent on a mission to 1 Boora-Boora-Gbha," while one of her most intimate friends and promising pupils was very properly pre- sented with a situation in the Lunatic Asylum. Betsey Hoax Jones, Esq., was sent Embassadress to the Queen of Egypt. Reverend BWunetta Reddish, D. D., was made a Cardinal; and Honorable Lucinda Hardhead, superintendent of the establish- ment for supplying the army with breeches! Aside from the clamor for office, as before intimated, a strong outside and lobby dictation was at work to control or stifle legislative action. As stated in a former chapter, new laws had been enacted on the subject of marriage, and great changes effected in the relative position of the sexes, but radicalism (as in all great political convulsions) was rampant, and still farther legislation on the subject demanded. One party--of the polygamist school - were urging the passage of a law allow- ing the women a plurality- of husbands, the number to be only limited by the ability of the lady to support them. On the other hand, hecatombs of petitions, with furlongs of signatures, loaded the tables of the house, "' humbly praying " the legisla- ture to abrogate all human enactments on the subject of mar- riage, leaving it for the Spheres alone -to regulate, conjugal relations and, through Medium agency, to bring together those fortunate individuals who had been matched in the ' Zones." c.     <pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6456-00000208"/> 896   *    LUCY  BOSTON. In short, spiritual marriage," or what the profane denominate marriage de convenience -in which a change of companions was  not only tolerated, but became as common almost as a change of partners in a country dance -had a large number of advocates among the female "red republicans;" and like Know-Nothingism, twenty years ago, threatened for a time to carry all before it. Governor Boston, with some of her more sensible adherents, had watched the progress of the revolution with not a little  trepidation. Seriously alarmed at the threatening aspect of political affairs, they began to fear, lest in their zeal for reform, they had raised a spirit which it would be extremely difficult for them to lay. Governor Boston, especially (in whom we hope the reader has discovered symptoms of sound common  sense, in spite of her ultraism in some respects), was becoming, in a measure, sceptical on the subject of. the so-called Modern Re-  form. The itinerant lecturer had first led her to believe, and then to doubt. The career of Funglehead and Nozzleman confirmed her in the belief, that although Spiritualism might possess some grains of truth, yet they were buried and lost beneath moun- tains of imposture. The doctrine of polygamy was especially repugnant to all her ides of propriety, and the practical tendency of " spiritual marriage" was too demoralizing to meet her approbation for a moment. At this time, however, the "tide in the affairs of women" was at its flood, and both these measures passed, with several others equally wise and equally expedient. But Lucy " took the responsibility," interposed her veto, and the session finally closed, having done little, if any thing of importance, except what is recorded in a previous chapter.   CHAPTER XXX. All's well that ends well. HE Legislature closed its eventful session, and the mem- bers returned to their constituents, the feminine portion of whom were generally welcomed by their own sex, with "well done, good and faithful servants." There was, however, a certain class of females who refused their approbation. Whe- ther this withholding from their representatives their " meed of praise" argued a grudging disposition or degeneracy from the true spirit of independence and patriotism, whether it was the want of ambition or the result of wise reflection and rea- sonable aversion to "mixing with politics," we leave for the reader to decide. Miss Governor Boston remained steadfastly at the Executive Mansion, as if, were the incumbent to "lock up the house" and absent herself, some political burglar might gain entrance and locate himself in the Chair of State, a self-constituted suc- cessor, to fill the vacancy. The day fixed for woman's imperial coronation drew nigh. The lords of creation, with becoming submission, wisely anti- cipated and prepared for the hour of " surrender," while among the "strong minded" (with whom we do not count 34                (39() W     <pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6456-00000209"/> 398        LUCY  BOSTON. you, respected female reader), the cry was, "Hurrah for Wo- man's Rights and the downfall of man power!" The wheels of Time, whirling onward, the mighty train of events neared the goal of fate. Man, as man, turned to be- hold for the last time the setting sun, when the King of Day, no doubt from sympathy with his kind, covering himself with sackcloth of indigo, hid his face and retired to his secret cham- ber. Not so his Queen. As if celebrating her accession to the throne, her Majesty, arrayed in robes of silver, with her courtly retinue, paraded up and down her royal saloon, hung with glowing astrals, and danced all night to the " musio of the Spheres." Meek-eyed Morn threw by her veil and looked brusque. Phoebus,-like Prime Ministers and Lord High Chamberlains in general, possessing a self-adjusting power of adaptation to any dominant form of government, old or new, tendering allegiance to the new sovereignty,--appeared in gorgeous splendor, and with the utmost suavity'shed his gol- den smiles upon the inaugural of the new feminine dynasty. Behold now the magic metamorphosis in the triumph of "woman's rights." The male population of the Empire State, like good, law- abiding citizens, arose with the sun, put on the petticoats, and entered with cheerful alacrity upon their domestic duties. To most of the new servants, it was a somewhat awkward busi- ness, to be sure, but the honest souls did as well as they knew how, and who could reasonably be required to do better? Therefore, fair reader, do not laugh, if they did act clumsily and make an occasional blunder. They merit your pity, not your ridicule, for with their house-keeping began also their \   FOLLIES OF THE     XIXTH   CENTURY. 399 cares and their trials, cares and trials numerous and sore enough to make them wish a dozen times a day that they '" had never got married." For instance, on the very first morning when the husbands awoke their wives (now the legal head), and brothers their sisters, ordering them to " get up and make a fire" and " put over the tea-kettle," instead of complying-with the reasonable command, they but half-opened their eyes, and instantly fell into a sound sleep again, stubbornly refusing to lose their morning nap: and so the hapless men servants were left to undergo the hardship of kindling their own fires and putting on their own tea-kettles. They might have doggedly resolved to lie still and starve, rather than brook the cruelty, but willing to bear almost any thing for the sake of peace in the family, they arose with resignation, struck their own fires, and prepared the morning meal, the women meanwhile enjoy- ing their "'Sight" of sleeping till called to breakfast. * * * That breakfast! But 'tis not marvelous if in too many in- stances the coffee was unsettled; the steak raw or roasted to a crisp; the potatoes smoked, thb cakes half dough, or done black; the presiding house-keeper besmeared with soot, greece and batter, with a quantity of rags bound upon his scalded hands; the table-cloth and carpet soaked where the platter hap- pened to land bottom upwards; the children half dressed and unwashed, crying for something to eat; the women sour and crabbed for being kept from their business by waiting " for- ever" for breakfast, and declaring when they did get it that it was not " fit for cannibals'"         * And after breakfast! But we will not follow the " masters of the mansion" up stairs and down, to watch their movements 1*f    <pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6456-00000210"/> 400        LUCY   BOSTON. in all the various departments of house-husbandry, in chamber, kitchen and nursery. It is enough to say, that they were uni- formerly " good keepers at home," industrious, economical, good-natured, and systematic as the case would allow; that in  all the routine of domestic economy they were passably dex- terous, though in nothing did they so much excel, as in the arts of wet-nurse, slapjacks and pastry. But from. within let us look out of doors-. As the ladies had volunteered -various directory items in relation to the do- mestic affairs, the gentlemen could hardly do less than recipro- cate the kindness. Accordingly the farmer told them where to find the horses, and oxen, and harness, and yokes, and carts, and chains, and plows, and hoes, and shovels, and pitchforks, and axes, and scythes, &amp;c., what portions of woodland had better be " chopped and cleared up"- what was the usual pro- gramme of planting, sowing, and harvesting-that the stalls and styes .would require their attention -that they must lay in a good supply of provisions - that wood and water must be furnished for cooking, baking, washing, and ironing -that the cows must be milked, "the calves suckled," and churning done in good time. The various artificers said to them dryly, "You will find the tools in the shop," accompanying the in- telligence with sapient suggestions in the line of architecture, as connected with their respective trades; and particularly the swarthy sons of Vulcan and Tubal-Cain, with brawny arms, pointed their fair successors to the forge, and gave them the benefit of sundry valuable hints in the science and art of met- allurgy. ,         .

Woman was in power. Behold the scene! Banks, stores, offices, shops, all closed, save the milliner shops, which as they now belonged to the province of the men, were promptly attended to, and a brisk trade driven in the out- fit of the new "fashionables," who in their passion for trinkets and finery, teased their wives for money, and when denied, did not hesitate to run them into debt. The sound of the anvil and the clatter of machinery was hushed. The plow stood still in the furrow. Trees felled by the hand of man remained en- tire in the forest. Canals and railroads ceased their functions. Boats, laden and empty, lay along the tow-paths, destitute of a helmsman, the horses standing in the harness without a driver. The locomotives in the engine-houses were not "fired up," and those upon the track, deserted by the engineers, whistled, "bolted the course," and stood motionless and silent, bringing the tide of travel suddenly to a dead stand-still, and leaving sundry passenger as well as freight trains midway between sta- tions - the telegraphic wires were uncommunicative --the stage coaches, with passengers and mail-bags, stood scattered along the routes, just where the first of April overtook them --the steamboats lay silent at the wharves, the shipping in the harbors without a sailor on board - and, as if Nature's sympa- thetic cord were touched, not a breath of air ruffled the glassy surface of the water, while the canvass clung to the spars of the vessels, as if either in downright burlesque, or to carry out the scheme of their sex, and to be in the fashion, they too had -34*    <pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6456-00000211"/> 402        LUCY  BOSTON. doffed their inflated habit, and donned the bloomer ' rig." In short, all, save within the domiciliary doors, was universal stagnation. Agriculture, commerce and art exhibited no signs of life. The motive power or vital function of public activity was suspended, and as the heart of the system ceased to pulsate, the current of life and health, of necessity, no longer flowed through its veins and arteries. G-loomy silence reigned everywhere, broken only by the, as- siduous clattering, amorous ditties, and merry laughter of the domestics, turned into strange dissonance by the doleful out- cries of the hungry animals from the stalls and styes. Poor brutes! which must have perished of starvation, had not the kitchen-men; from motives of humanity, occasionally in a sly way attended to their wants. The "strong-minded" were evidently taken by surprise. They had not anticipated such a preconcerted "masterly inao- tivity" on the part of the male population in respect to busi- ness matters. It was amusing to see the sovereigns request their " domestics" to accompany and assist them in their vari- ous employments, and hear them decline on account of " press- ing household cares." The "servants" also received frequent applications from their mistresses to exchange places, but, with the exception of here and there a "doughface," they uniformly refused, on the ground that it was unconstitutional, and they wished to be peaceable, law-abiding subjects. How different the state of things within doors. The new house-keepers were delighted with their transmigration. All was life, activity and merriment. They made every thing moves   FOLLIES   OF THE  XIXTH   CENTURY. 403 if not in all instances, like " clock-work." It is true, they met with more " kicks" than compliments, especially for their cu- linary performances, but with abundant good nature, concluding that the only way was to " live and learn," they would " hurry the work out of the way," and, ordering up the carriage, take a ride, or in the good old-fashioned style, with sewing and knit- ting work in hand, run together and enjoy their tea-party chat. The crisis had come. The grand problem of "woman's rights" was solved in a universal "smash-up," to speak in the vernacular of this steam and lightning age. The Ship of State, remodeled and new-rigged with such dispatch, launched so triumphantly, and without ballast, chart, compass, or practical helmsman, under the mighty press of her canvass, dashing through foam and spray, among rocks, quick- sands and whirlpools, on the sea of Experinent, had quickly foundered and gone to pieces amid darkness and tempest. From every quarter went up the cry for help. All eyes were turned imploringly towards the Governor, who saw and appreciated the fatal catastrophe. Petitions the most importunate poured in upon her from her sex, to assemble the Legislature without delay, that something might be done for woman's wrongs, as they were absolutely intolerable. Great anxiety was manifested by the female constituency of the "rural districts " in particular, that relief might be afforded in time for "spring's work" to be done. This public expression was too strong to be resisted, even had the Executivess been disposed to tread in the footsteps of sundry of her illustrious predecessors, and throw the petitions "under the table." Accordingly the Legislature was speedily f               of    <pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6456-00000212"/> "404'       LUCY   BOSTON. convened in special session. Every pmember appeared;with swarms of "lobbies" and spectators, among whom was our jolly friend Wilson. Governor Boston appeared in person before the Council of State, and with-deep mortification listened to the tale of folly, shame and disaster. Her eyes, and those of her sex, were opened. They recognized and had the frankness to acknowl- edge their splendid failure, and that they were entirely out of their place. For the most part the feminines could not, nor did they attempt to blame any but themselves and their sex, for they had revolutionized the government, and passed their own laws, and the men had submissively obeyed them. Governess Boston, in person, presented a verbal message, deploring the public and private calamity induced by fanatacism, mixed with ambition for notoriety, and recommending the im- mediate abrogation of the New Dispensation, restoring things upon their former basis-and that accordingly her sex resign their false position, return to the Sphere and resume the duties for which they were designed. This wise recommendation was as wisely adopted, her Excel- lency forthwith setting the example. The Restoration was accomplished. Man was in power again. Thus ended "Wonman's Rights," like its great cotemporary, Spiritualism, in the language of the illustrious Z. Socrates, a i' mighty big humbug." On the steps of the Capitol, Wilson and Ex-Governor LUCY recognized each other with a cordial shake of'the hand. "Miss Boston," said our landlord, in his own peculiar way,   FOLLIES OF    THE  XIXTH    CENTURY. 405 "I understood you to say that you desired to move in the Sphere and attend to the duties for which you were designed." "Certainly I do, sir." "Were you designed to become Mrs. Wilson, think you?" "4 Possibly -if that is the design of MrX. Wilson." They were arm in arm. The Chaplain still present, there in the Capitol, amid the brilliant concourse of dignitaries, she who, but a few moments before, was the Chief Magistrate of the Empire State, had suddenly emigrated to the State of Mat- rimony, and ascending from the gubernatorial chair of political empire, as wife and help-meat of one in heart and soul worthy of her noble self, was inaugurated Governess of the domestic circle in a village boarding-house, according to design. The following morning found themmn n their homeward jour- ney. In Wilson's absence, Amaziah applied to Miss Hager to "fit him a dress."  During the process, the lucky though't struck him of having a mantua-maker of his own, and to which Miss H-  had not " the least objection in this world." Our landlord and landlady, on their arrival, found Mr. and Mrs. Badger cosily located as their boarders, and occupying the quondam haunted chamber. The surprise was mutual. At the point where we drop the thread of our narrative, they were -gliding down the stream of life, prosperously and pleasantly. The Mermaid, foiled in her' filibuster" expedition, retired to her ocean home, a confirmed misanthrope, beholding her sex re-enslaved, yet rejoicing in her own freedom as she reveled through the gem-lit halls of her coral palace and roamed the azure fields, on the back of her odolphin steed, or lay                          <pb n="406" xml:id="VAC6456-00000213"/> 406         LUCY  BOSTON. ' Along the scoop'd side of the hollow wave, Singing dulcet music, to the amorous gales." Lucy - now Mrs. Wilson- had laid by her "bloomer," and sought no further communication with her amphibious acquaintance. The editor's wife was a frequent visitor at the boarding-house, but not to borrow the " city paper." They occasionally looked back and enjoyed a hearty laugh over the memorable "campaign," Wilson remaining foremost in the "ranks of fun."  Our editor continued to publish the National Bulletin. The issue, following the denouement of the above-mentioned par- ties, heralded their marriages, accompanied by one of its racy editorials, and which closed with the following laconic epitaph: SPIRITUALISiM AND WOMAN'S RIGHTS! Twins in their birth and ill begot; Twins in their grave -there let 'em rot. Note. - Since writing the foregoing pages, we chanced to light upon a volume composed by Judge Edmonds and Doctor Dexter, entitled "Spiritualism ;" and which is such a transcendently successful bur- lesque, that had we met it earlier, we should not have had the self- assurance, not to say hardihood, as to think of introducing Lucy Boston as a rival. And even now, were it not for positive engagements, we should deem it the part of prudent discretion to retire from the field,       </p>
