TEATHR  DOCTOR  HE:NEY-.HJL  &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC7117-00000003"/> PREFACE. IN 1849, I resided for a few months in Jackson, Louisiana. During my sojourn in that place, two meritorious young men, who had established a Press in the village, earnestly solicited me to write for it. I agreed to do so; and as a College and a number of admirable schools graced the village, I framed the story of Master MTTEN, to induce the youth of the place, to improve the opportunities which these institutions afforded them of becoming useful and distinguished men. Master MTTEN and his' mother, are both imaginary characters; but who that has had much to do with the instruction of youth, has not seen both, at least in their leading traits? I LAID the scene of the story in Georgia, and took the liberty of intro- ducing into it, the names of several of my Georgian friends, giving a very slight touch of their characters in the conduct and language which I ascribe to ,them. This. I did, to increase the interest of the story to them at least, should it ever reach the State of Georgia. I deem it proper to mention these things, for the story having been Im'oken off at the fifth chapter, by my departure from Louisiana, when it was resumed in Georgia, for the Field &amp; Fireside. Many finding these names in it, with some of the char- acteristics of those who bore them, supposed it to be a veritable history, which it is not. Master MrrTEN is introduced to Doctor Waddel's celebrated School in Willington, Abbeville District, South Carolina, just as it was, from 1806 to 1809, inclusive. SPRAGUE has given us a brief sketch of the Doctor's biography, in which ht merits as a Teacher and a Divine are gravely por- trayed. MTTEN shows the reader the man at the head of his school in its palmiest days.    RUINED BY BAD LUCK. CHAPTER I. MANY years ago there lived in a small village in the State of Georgia, a pious widow, who was left with an only son and two daughters. She was in easy circumstances, and managed her tem-. poral concerns with great prudence; so that her estate increased with her years. Her son exhibited, at a very early age, great precocity of genius, and the mother lost no opportunity of letting, the world know it. Wheh he. was but six years old, he had comitted little pieces in prose and poetry, which he delivered with remarkable pro- priety for his years. He knew as 'much of the scriptures as any child of that age probably ever knew; and he had already made some progress in geography and mental arithmetic. With all this, he was a very handsome boy. It is nt to be wondered at, that his mother should be bringing him out in some department of science, upon all occasions;, of course, she often brought him out upon very unsuitable occasions, and sometimes kept him out, greatly to the annoyance of her company. ltot to praise his performances, would have been discouraging to Master William Mitten, and very morti- fying to his mother; accordingly, wether they were well-timed or ill-timed, everybody praised them. The ladies, all of whom loved Mrs. Mitten, were not unfrequently, thrown into raptures at the child' exhibitions. They would snatch hin up in their arms, kiss him, pronounce him a perfect prodigy, both in beauty of person and power of mind ; and declare that they would be willing, to go beg- gars upon the world to have such ap child. Others would piously exhort Mrs. Mitten not toset her heart too much upon the child. They never saw the little creature, without commingled emotions of delight and'alarm; so often is it the case that children of such *  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7117-00000004"/> 6       .MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.  wonderful gifts die early." Hier brother, Capt. David Thomson, candid, plain-dealing excellent man, often reproved Mrs M. forpc Cracdig, as he called it, "her child upon all occasions." ' Anna," said he, "you will stuff your child so full of pride an( vanity, and make him so pert and forward. that there will be n living with him. From an object of admiiation he will soon becom an object of detestation."  "No danger, brother-no danger;" she would reply, "(I tak, special care to guard him against these vices." At eight yeai of age, William was plaeed under the instruetiol of Miss Smith, the teacher of a female school, into which small boy, were admitted by courtesy. Here he continued until his tenth year when Miss'Smith told his mother that he was getting too old to remair in her school, and that she could keep him no longer. Here Mis: Smith whispered something to Mrs. Mitten which drew a smile fron her, but which has ever remained a secret between them. It tool about the time to deliver it, that it would take to say: "the truth is, he is too pretty and too smart to be in a -female school." William being now out of employment, his mother took six months to deliberate as to what was next to be done with him; and in the meantime she sent him in the country to stay with liis grandmother On his return she determined to place him under the tuition of Mr, Markham, one of the best of men, and best of instructors. Accord. ingly, she conducted him to the school room of his second pre. ceptor. "You will find him, Mr. 5arkham," said Mrs. M., as she de- livered over her son to the teacher'scharge, easy to lead but hard to drice." "If that be the case, Madam," said Mr. Markham, "'I fear that your son will not do well under my government." "Why, surely, Mr. Markham, you don't prefer driving to leadlin.." "By no means, Madam-by no means. I much prefer leading; but no child of his age can be always led. Withal, a teacher must govern, by fixed rules, which cannot be relaxed in favor of one of hist pupils, without rendering them worthless, or 'unjust to all t  test." took MBrs. Mitten a little by surprise; for she supposed that    Mr: Markham would be proud of such an accession to his school as William. She acquiesced, however, in the soundness of his views; :  .  .. but flattering herself "that he would never find it necessary to   drive William," she turned him over to the teacher and withdrew.   MASTER' WILLIAM MTTBENi.'        7 William made his debut at school in a dress which was rather tawdry for Sunday, and extravagant fo the school-room. The first ten or fifteen minutes/ere spent by William and the school boys in inter- changing lookrof admiration, which Mr. Markham indulged, under pretence of not observing. At length a pretty general titter began e  to run through the school at William's expense. Mr. Markham now interposed, with a sternness that instantly brought all to order but William, who tittered in turn, at divers persons and things. But this Mr. Markham happened not to notice. The object of William's special 2regards and amusement was John Brown, whose clothes seemed to have been made of remnants of" old bed-quilts, so numer- ous and party-colored were their patches. John's attitude was as curious as his dress; he seemed to have derived it from the neck of a crane at rest. His head was flat and bushy, his feet were large and black, and his face bore a marked resemblance to that of a leather-winged bat. In all his life, William had never seen exactly such a thing as this; and he laughed at it, without stint and without disguise. John soon became indignant, and raising his book be- tween his face and the teacher, he set his mouth to going as if re- peating all the vowels and consonants of the alphabet in quick time, and shook his fist at William with a quiver of awful portent. 'Ac cording to the masonry of the school-room these signs meant: "Vever mind, old-fellow, soon as school's out .'llt make you laugh t'other side of the mouth!"7 "Come here, sir," said Markham who always saw more than he seemed to see. "Who are you shaking your fist at, sir?" "Mr. Markham, that fellow keeps laughing at me, sir."' "'And did'nt you laugh at him first?" "I--I--laughed at him a little bit; but Be keeps at' it all the time."  He don't do nothin' else but keep'n' on laughin' atme all the time." "Well, if you laugh at other people, you must let them laugh at you; and now, sir, go to your seat; and if I catch you shaking your fist at anybody in school hours again, or using it upon anybody afterwards, who has only paid laugh with laugh, I'll shake you." j  There was a little spice of equity here, that John had entirely ! overlooked; and he went to his seat much cooler than might have been expected.  "Come here, William!" continued the preceptor. William did not move; and the whole school was electrified at disobedience to i Mr. Markham's orders.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7117-00000005"/> 8        MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. "Come here, William!" repeated Mr. Markham but with no bet. ter success. Whereupon herose, and commenced A" leading" him in quick time, to his seat. Having stationed him b- it he said to him:  William I know you have been indulged so much that you hardly know the duty of submission to your teacher's orders, or I would correct you for hot coming to me when I called you. You must do as I tell you.; and I tell you now to quit laughing and gel your lesson-you, John Brown, are you tittering again already l Put down your feet and come here, sir!" Here Mr. Marlham, bJ way of parenthesis, gave John three cuts, which sounded like a whip-poor-will, and made him, dance a jig, . minuetand a polka all in less than a minute.. He'retired, crying, and limping an rubbia and shaking his bushy head like a muscovy drake in a pet; and Mr, Markham proceeded: "I tell you, William, you must obey me"- "Yes, sir/' said William, pale as a sheet. "' I can have no little boys with me who won't do as I tell them"- "No, sir."  "If you will be a good boy, and mind your book and your teacher you need not be afraid of me. Go now and take your seat and quil laughing and get your lesson." William obeyed promptly, and hardly took his eyes from s booI until the school was dismissed. During the recess he begged his mother to take him away fron Mr. Markham's school. He said Mr. Markham whipt his scholars and he " didn't want to go to a man that whipt children." "But," said his mother, "you must be a good boy, and then he will not whip you. I've entered you now, and paid your first quar ter's schooling, and you must go to the end of the quarter." William returned to school, and for several weeks did remark ably well. He was put in a class with George Markham, son of .th( preceptor, a promising youth, but equal to William in nothing bu attention to his studies. As William could get his lessons in hal the time allowed him for this purpose, lie soon began to neglect them until the last moment from which he could commit them, and thei to some time beyond the moment; and iere was the beginning o his bad luck. As he grew remiss, Mr. Markham counseled him lectured him, and threatened him; but all to no purpose. A length he told him that the next time he came to recite withou knowing his lesson, he would correct him. This alarmed William . good deal; but not quite enough to stimulatee his industry to con   MASTER WILLIAM MATEN.           9 tinued exertion; and after ten or fifteen lessons he came up deficient again.            . "Why 'have you not got this lesson, sir?" said Mr. Markham with terrific sternness. '       ' "H-was sick, sir!" This was William's first falsehood; but it saved him from a whip- ping which he awfully dreaded; for though Mr. Markham knew that he, had not told the truth, he deemed it best to admit the ex- cuse, at least so far as to withhold the rod of correction for the present.  -  As he dismissed the school, he told William to remain a few mo- mei and when they were alone he thus addressed him: "William, I very much fear yot told me a falsehood A-day. I saw you all the 'morning 'before you camne to recite idling, and 'whispering, without any appearance of sickness; a ince the recita- tion, I have seen,no sign of sickness about you.. Still I may possibly be mistaken, and I hope I am; but remember, if ever I find you telling a lie to hide your faults, I will punish you' more severely than I would without the lie." He then proceeded to counsel him kindly and affectionately against the danger of lying. William went home in sadness and in tears, for his conscience gave him no rest. His mother sought in vain for the cause of his distress. The next day he went to the, school and acquitted himself well for that and the four succeeding days, for which Mr. Markham gave him great credit and encouragement. On the fifth day he got permission to go out, and as he remained out an unusually long time, Mr. M. went in quest of him, and found him in the act of concealing his book among some rubbish near the school house. He was unob- served by William, and he withdrew to the school room. Just before the recitation hour William made his appearance. What he had been doing during his absence, was not known; but that he had not been studying was manifest from his conduct, and still more manifest from his ignorance of the lesson when he zme to recite. "What have you been doing; William," said Mr. Markham, that you know nothing of-this lesson?" "I lost my book, sir, and I couldn't find it." Mr. Markham passed the matter over until he dismissed his school, t:  when he detained Williar, told him where his book was, repeated his lecture upon lying, and enforced it with a pretty severe flogging. William had never experienced the like of that before, and probably would never have experienced it again, but for the imprudence of his  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7117-00000006"/> mother and her friends. He promised his preceptor that he would never repeat his offence; and he went home with a counte nance and manner indicative of a fixed purpose to keep his promise. He told his mother nothing of what had happened, nor did she find it out for four days afterwards. In the meantime, William was all that she or his preceptor could wish him to be. It so happened, however, that Thomas Nokes had lingered about the school-house, and seen all that had transpired between William and his teacher. He went home where he found Mrs. Glib, one of Mrs. Mitten's most devoted friends-as she proved by carrying to her all news that was likely to affect her peace. Mrs. G. had stopped on her way to her brother's in the country to bid Mrs. 0okes farewell, and had actually risen th depart, when Tom stept in, big with the events of the day. "I tell you, -what!" said he, "Mr. Markham give Bill Mitten jorZum to-day I' "It isn't possible," exclaimed ilrs. Glib, "that Mr. Markham has whipt that dear, sweet, lovely boy." Mrs. Nokes tried to catch Tom's eye, .that she mi-ght stop him; but his whole attention was directed to TMrs. G. and he went on- "Yes he did-and he linked it into him like flugins. I'll be bound he made the blood come." Here Tom caught his mother's eye, which was darting lightnings at him, and he concluded, " but I don't reckon he hurt him much though!"                    ^ "Oh, the brute!" muttered Mrs. Glib, as she left the house for the carriage.  On the afternoon of the fourth day from her departure, she re- turned to the village, and immediately hastened over to Mrs. Mit- ten's. Mrs. M. met her at the door very cheerfully and very cordially. Oh," ejaculated Mrs. Glib, "how iappy I am to find you so. cheerful! I was afraid I should find you in tears."  "In tears! For what?"  "Why, for the unmerciful beating which Mr. Markham gave to your dear, sweet, lovely little William, last Friday." Surely there must be some mistake Mrs. Glib. William never said a word to me about it; and not fifteen minutes before you came in, Br. Markham was here congratulating me on the progress my child was making in everything that was good." Here Mrs. G. looked as if she had taken an emetic which was just about to operate; and after a short pause she proceeded:    "Well, ,I hope it is a mistake; but it came to ine from an eye witness. - You know I don't send my children to Mr. Markham; be- cause I den't choose to have my chil7:ren cut and slashed about like gale ley-slaves, for every little childish error they commit-breaking down their spirit,; nd teaching then sceaking and lying, and everything that's low and mean. Mr. Toper never whips; and I don't see but that my children get along under him as well as other people's chil- dren." (Hlere Mrs. 1. covered her face with her handkerchief, either to hide her griet or a smile which grief could notextinguish, or blushes of conscience; for she had warped her son against ever associating with the Glibs.) "But you know how strict Mrs. Nokes I is with her children; one of them would as soon put his head in the fire as tell a lie--specially before her. Well, Thomas' told me, right in her presenc , thafMnarkhamn whipt William tillhle drew the blood! from him 1"  Mi "Mercy on mel!" groaned MTs. Mr itten " why didn't Williamn tell 1 me of it!" i  Oh, that lis easily accounted for. hIy George Waington  Alexander Augustus says that John Brown told him, that 'ifany- body went to carrying tales out of Mr. Markham's school, he'd make'em dancejuba.' Poor William dare not tell of it. John said, moreover, that Markham dragged him from his seat the first day that  he went to school, and would have whipt him then, if he had been j in school a little longer." I "I fear," said Mrs. Mitten with streaming eyes, "that I offegded M Mr. Markham when I placed William under him, by telling him that William, was easy to'lead but hard to drive. He immediately showed some reluctance at receiving him. But I only meant to ap- - prise him of the child's disposition. Poor child, with all his talents, , I fear he is doomed to bad luck ." qK ; a"Oh, no, mada m; I can explain the mlatter etter than that. 1 ,George Markham was given up on iall hands to be the smnarte't boy j in school. Now everybody knew what a prodigy William was; and old Marlhaml knew that as soon as William entered the school, his beloved darllingl, rcious Geeorge, would have to com e down a notch. i All the boys say that William is smarter than George, and yet that old Markham is always peeking at him.

"What hypocrisy!" exclaimed Mrs. Glib.   "He's get wind of it         '  "William," said his mother, " did Mr. Markham whip yon last Friday?' In an instant his countenance fell, and his eyes filled. af Yes, ma'am," whispered William. "But I don't think he will   whip me again, for I mean to be a good boy." "' Poor, blessed, little innocent angel-lamb!" sighed forth Mrs. G. with honest sympathy.   x. "And haven't you .always been a gqod boy, my son?" "Ye-e-s m'm." "Then what did he whip you for?" "4 He said I told a lie, and wouldn't get my lesson!' ' "Oh, shocking, shocking-worse and worse!" vociferated Mrs. Glib. "I'd stake my salvation on it, that child nevet told an un- truth in all his life."  It was very unlucky for William, that Mrs. G. made this remark; and still more unlucky that his mother did not suspend her examina- tion here, until Mrs. G. retired. "William, it would break my heart to discover that you had told a lie; but if you have told one, confess it, my child, to your mother!" William paused and pondered, as well he might; for having Mrs. Glib's salvation and his mother's heart in one eye, and Mr. Mark- ham's awful lie-physic in the other, he was in a most perplexing di- lemma. ;' Don't you see, Mrs. BMitten, that the child is actually afraid to deny that he told a lie? He knows that if it gets to Marklham's cars that he denied it, he'd beat him to death. Didn't he whip you very severely, William?" ' Yes, ma'am." "Where did he whip you?" "On the calf of my legs." "Well, now, do let us examine them ' I lay the marks of the whip are upon them to this day-" William's pants were rolled up, and at the first glance, his legs seemed as white and as spotless as pure alabaster. But a glance did not satisfy Mrs. Glib. She was confident that William had received l"jorum," and that marks of it might yet be found. Accordingly, she put on her specs and squatted down to a close' examination of William's legs, beginning at the left."    ' Look here, Mrs. Mitten," said she, after a short search, " isn't this the mark of a whip?"  "N-no' said Mrs. M. carelessly,  I believe it's nothing but a vei." "tp no vein, my word for it; it's too straight for a vein, I'm told that whip-marks, just before they disappear, can hardly be dis- tinguished from veins." Proceeding from the left leg to the right, she examined for some time with no better success. At length, however, on the right side of the limb, she found-the palpable marks of " jorum." For reasons that need not be given, I hold myself perfectly. competent to explain this matte with unquestionable accuracy. Jorum is always administered with a scarificator; and in receiving it, it is almost impossible for the patient to keep his legs still. The consequence sometimes is, that the scarificator, which,. is made and intended to act simultaneously and equally upon both limbs hardly scratches one, while it spends all its force (double force) upon the' other. William had obviously' "danced juba" under the operation, and in three of his movements e he had so distracted the instrument, that the end of it pressed much harder upon the flesh in these places than the operator intended and of course. it left its most permanent mark where it pressed haiest. Nor is it true, as Mrs. Glib was informed, that its mark retire in ike. ness to a vein, but with a greenish, straw-color, as the case before her proved. Mrs. Glib had no sooner discovered these marks, than she went through divers evolutions of horror, better suited to the Inquisition than to this occasion. At length she became composed enough to speak. "Oh, Mrs. Mitten, see what your dear lovely, brilliant boy has suffered. Think of when it was done!" Mrs. Mitten looked and burst into tears afresh. Just at this point her daughters made their appearance, and the matter being explained to them they burst into tears; and William seeing his mother and sisters weeping, he burst into tears. In the midst of this affecting scene, David Thompson, Mrs. Mitten's brother, made his appearance, and he didn't burst into tears. "Why, what's the matter-what's to pay?" enquired he, with no little, alarm. The ladies all answered at once, with different degrees of exagger- ation, but all to the same point, namely, that Markham had beaten William most unmercifully.   &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7117-00000008"/> "'Why, nothing seems to be the matter with him that I can see." "Look at his legs!" "Well, I see nothing the matter with his legs." "Look at his right leg." "Well, I see nothing the matter with his right leg." "Look on the right side of his right leg." "Well, Psee nothing on the right side of the right leg." "Look here, Mr. Thompson," said Mrs. Glib-" bend down a Uttle -do you see these marks?" "Psh-e-e e-t! Why surely you have all run crazy! Is it possible you're making all this fuss over these three little specks?" "Those specks as you call their, brother, are the remains of; what was put on my child's tender fesh four days ago." ' And have you all just made up your minds to cry about it!" "We did not know of it, brother David, before." "Why, didn't William tell you of it?" "No, poor child, he hardl dare talk about it now. He is com- pletely cowed. Since he w nt to school he seems to have been buried; nobody notices or speaks of the child any more than if he were dead." "Yes, there it is! you have beenQfeasting upon his 'praises so long, that you cannot live without them. What did Markham whip him for? "The chalrge was, telling a lie, and neglecting his lessons." "Well, are you sure he did not tell a lie?" "Oh, brother, how can you ask such a question right before the child's face! Yes, I'm just as sure of it as I can be of anything. I never detected William in a lie in all my life." "No, nor you never will, the way you're going on, if he told a thousand. Now, if Markham whipt him for lying, I vouch for it he told a lie, and Markham knew it; for he never moves without seeing his way clear." "I think he has a prejudice against William, and I think I know the reason of it." "Prejudice  He's incapable of prejudice against anvbody, much less against little silly children. I'll go over and see him and learn the whole truth of the matter."  "No, you needn't trouble yourself, brother, I shall not send William to school to him any longer."         - "Why, Anna, you surely are not going to take your child from    !   . w    MjTER 'WLILyIAM MTTEN.  school without hearing from Mr. Markham the particulars of this matter?" "I don't want any particulars, more than my own eyes have seen. Suppose the child actually did tella lie, (which nobody who knows him will believe) it wouldn't justify Mr. Markham in beating him to death'  , . "Beating him to death! He's certainly a very natural looking corpse! And when you take him from school, what are you going to do with him?" "I'd rather send him to Mr. Toper than have him .cut and slashed to pieces by Markham." "Toper! what that drunken booby who hardly knows B from bull's foot." "Good morning, ladies!" said Mrs. Glib-"Good mnorning, Captain Thompson." "Why, brother! How could you talk so of Mr. Tope? Don't you know that Mrs. Glib sends her children to him? She'll go right off and tell him what you said." "No, I don't know, nor don't care where she sends them. All I know about them is, that Toper is a drunken fool, and that her chil- dren are perfect nuisances to the town, and that if you mean to send your child to the devil, Toper is the very man to carry him for you. Mrs. Glib may tell him all this too, if she chooses; and ther'if he opens his mouth to' me about the matter, I'll kick-him out of the town, as a public charity."  "I only said I had rather send my child to Mr. Toper than have him beaten so. I think I shall employ a private tutor."  "And pay ten times as much as is needful for your child's instruc- tion ; and then have him not half as well taught, as he will be, by Markham! Anna, I beseech you, I implore you for your child's sake, don't act at all in this matter under your present feelings. Let the matter rest until I can see Markham and learn the whole history of it. I know more of boys than you do. They do many things at school that they never do at home, for the plain reason that they are under many temptations at school which they are not under at home. You are probably now at the turning point of your child's destiny, and a false step here may ruin hint forever." Strange to tell, William listened to his uncle with:a kind of ap-, proving amazement, and as'soon as hp had concluded, said: "Ma, I'm willing to go back to Mr. Markham now; I a'nt afraid of him; I don't think he'll ever whip me again." a. &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7117-00000009"/> 16        MASTER WILLIAM MTTE&amp;I.  "That's a brave boy," said the"Captain. ( Every. word in the sentence is worth a guinea. No good boy fears Mr. Markham."-. "Ah, poor child!" said Mrs. Mitten-" he knows little of the world's duplicity. He little dreams of the undercurrent that is at work against him." W' What undercurrent? Is it possible, Anna, that after nine years' acquaintance with Markham, you can suspect him of duplicity and secret hostility to such ,a child as that-your child--ny nephew!" "PMr. Markham's not perfection, if what I've heard of him is true," said Miss Jane. "No," said Miss Ann, " and if I was ma, I'd die before I'd send brother William back to him to be beaten like a dog!" ( And if I was ma, I'd learn you to hold your tongues till your counsel was asked for." "Oh, do, brother, let thelgirls express their opinions. I should suppose that one 'might have an opinion% of even, Mr. Markham, without having their heads snapt-off." ( Well, Anna, I see your mind is made up to .take William from Mr. Markham's school." "Yes, I'm resolved upon it." "And without one word of explanation"from Mr. Markham!" "Yes; I want none of his explanations." { Ma," said William, "t let me go back to theend of the quarter." "Bravo, Bill! Go back, my son-be a a good boy, and- learn your book, and you'll be a noble fellow. by and by." "Brother David, do you think it right to encourage a poor little ignorant child to run counter to his mother's wishes?" "No, Anna; but I supposed that the wishes of the child in whom you are so much wrapt up, might save you from rash resolutions con- cerning him," "Well, it is not necessary to delate the matter further. I vow he never shall go back to Air. Markham'si school, and that is the long and short of it." Captain Thompson wheeled off and left the house as if to get something of importance that he had left in a dangerous place. In about a half hour he returned: "Well," said he, 'c I have seen Markham, and heard the whole matter explained"-Land he gave it' from first to last, just as it occurred. Still Mrs. Mitten adhered to her resolution. He argued, he entreated, he implored, he forewarned, he remonstrated, he used every means that he could think of to change her minds but to no     H  ,.      MASTER WILLIAMt   MTTEN. purpose. The truth is, Mrs. Mitten would not place her son where he was liable to be whipt. Her brother left in a storm. I have been thus particular in giving this. part of William's history, because , it proved in the end, as the sequel will show, to be remarkably unlucky, and fruitful of wonderful consequences.    CHAPTER II.   , The reader will remember that we left Mrs. Mitten resolved to remove Master William from Mr. Miarkham's school. Her resolu- tion was carried into effect; and she forthwith began to look out for a private teacher for her son. But unluckily no such teacher was just then to be found; she was constrained, therefore, to advertise -for one; and though she placed her advertisement in three Gazettes, i.' pretty general circulation, three months rolled away before any one proffered his services to Master William. In the meantime our little hero was a gentleman at large; and having formed many acquaintances at school, common courtesy required that he should' give them as much of his attention as he could. Awordingly he was with them at every intermission of their studies, and took great pleasure in attending the evening parties of such as were smart enough to do without evening study. These soon became so frequent that William entirely neglected his mother's parties for them; Bly means whereof his mother and her friends lost the entertai'nment which he used to afford them upon such oeasions. She often. de- manded of him explanations of hig discourtesy: to his old admirers, which he promptly gave to her entire satisfaction. Sometimes he was at the Juvenile Debating Society; at others he was at a Prayer Meeting; at one time he " went to hear Parson Deleth's Lecture." (On the importance of the Oriental Languages to the student of Theology.)  At another he went to hear the Euterpean band; and at all other times. he was taking tea with good .oys, or engoaged in some laudable employment: As the young Glibs had rather more leisure than any others boys in town, and as their mother 'had charged them to' cultivate a close acquaintance with Master William, they were frequently thrown together. At first William was rather shy of those acquaintances ;- but as they forced themselves into his company, pleading-f4er mother's order for so doing, he could not well refuse to take them under his moral training. Accordingly they soon became very intimate; and William was pleased to find that they were by no means as bad-boys as his mother took them to a &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7117-00000010"/> 18    .   MASTER WILLIAM MI'EN. be. Withal he soon discovered that they were possessed of a vast fund of information, which they communicated to him freely; first to his astonishment, and afterwards to his delight. They knew who had the best apples, peaches, plums, cherries and melons in the town and neighborhood-what gardens contained the most strawherries, raspberries, grapes, figs and pomegranates-who had the earliest and latest' fruits-what time b]ad dogs wore turned loose at night-- where hens, guinea-chickens, ducks and turkeys, were in the habit of laying. They weren masters of all culinary matters, except. the higher branches of cookery. They were abolitionists of the most generous stamp; disdaining the distinctions of color, and holding out the most liberal encouragements to slave industry, by promising the most liberal prices for such little dainties and curiosities as the poor slave might have to dispose of. Nor were these young ge e- men without personal accomplishments, corresponding with ti vastlmental endowments. They were the most expert climbers of trees and fences in the country. They were good riders and better runners. Though one of them wastwo months, another fifteen and another thirty-seven .months older than William, they could slip through gaps that he feared to attempt. They could heel a game- cock, whet a jack-knife, and shoot a pistol, with unrivalled skill- their age considered. ,They could recognize people in the dark with the eye of an owl; and run half-bent in' gutters and ditches, faster than William could, on a plain. They could perform many amusing and ingenious tricks with cards; and smoke segars, chew tobacco and drink cordial, apple-toddy, egg-nog and' the like, with marvelous grace and impunity. At the end of three or four weeks from the time that William left school, Mr. Markhai's examination came off, and most of the town attended it. The visitors were, as usual, liberal in their praises of such as did well; and these, William, who was present, heard with painful emotions. They were praises which made his tea-party-com- pliments seem insignificant. Here was competition, and not one was praised, of whom he did not know hLtnself to be decidedly the superior. The examination closed with an allotment of prizes to the best in the several classes, by judges appointed for that purpose. William saw one and another distributed with increasing dejection and self-reproach. At length George Markham was called out on the stage, and Judge Dawson advancing to him with a large silver medal, suspended by a crimson ribbon with tasteful decorations, observed: "Master George, in the course of the examination you have laborad   MASTER WILLIAM   MTTEN. under some disadvantages; for the judges, from an apprehension that their high respect for your teacher, might be unconsciously trans- ferred to his son, have been, more vigilant of inaccuracies in you than in any of your school mates. So well have you alquitted your- self, however, that you have entirely relieved us from all apprehension of doing you injustice on either hand, and we presume there will not be a dissenting voice in this large and respectable assembly, to our judgment, which awards to you the first honor in your class; in token of which we present you this beautiful medal. Remember," con- tinued Judge Dawson, as he placed the loop of the ribbon over the head of Master George, and dropt the medal on his breast--" remem- ber as often as you look upon that medal, that on the day you re- ceived it, you raised the highest expectations of your future distinc- tion, and resolved never to disappoint them." As the judge con- cluded, the house thundered with applause. , William dropt his head and wept bitterly.; for he felt that all this would have been his, had he remained at school.  In the afternoon the usual exhibition came off:i We Bnv not dwell upon the performances of each of the students respectively. For r sons-which will be hereafter observed, we notice but wo. Taefourth speaker called out was M3STER JohN BROWN! John stept out so completely metamorphosed; that William himself hardly knew him. His hair was combed down straight and slick. The lard-gourd had obviously been laid under contributions for it. His feet were disguised under shoes and stockings. G His suit was all new and of course all of one color. His mother had tried herself upon it from the spinning of the first thread, to the fitting of fA on. But nature had decreed that ePohn should be a funny lookinu fellow in spite of dress i and as he stept to the centre of the stag(, as if labor- ing under a slight founder, (for shoes manifestly peste-ed him) an involuntary smile diffused itself over every countenance. He made his bow, and in a clear, distinct audible voice he began: "Ladies and Gentlemen: You will not be surprised that I should have selected as my theme for your enteitainment. this afternoon the incalculable advantages of personal beauty." Here it seemed that the house would be knocked to pieces. Men, women and children laughed and thumped immoderately; and even Mr. Markham could not preserve his usual gravity. Mrs. Brown plainly showed that her trouble in rigging out John was repaid by the very first sentence. With almost every other, the same scene was renewed; until at length all respect for order seemed to be for-  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7117-00000011"/> 2I MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. - gotten; and such commendations as these might be heard in under- tones all over the house: Well done, fiat-head! Hurra'short-neck! Bravo pug-nose! I tell you stiff-leg is some! Give me homespun at last. John concluded, and had it been allowable, he, doubtless, would have been encored at least three times. He owed most of his credit to the patient and' careful drilling of his teacher, but there were few in the school who could have improved good drilling as well as John did. Next to John's speech, the most amusing thing in the exhibition was a dialogue between George Markham  and David Thompson, which elicited great applause. At the conclusion of the exercises, honors were a second time distributed, and young Markham was again complimented with a prize. Brown got one, of course, which was rendered doubly complimentary, by another peal of applause as he received it. All this was slow murder to William, Mitten. Nor did his tortures end here. Seeing his uncle and Mr. Markham in conversation as the company retired, he flattered himself that they were negotiating for his return to school, and he drew near to them unobserved by either, and overheard this conversation: "That little fellow Brown is an odd looking fish, 3r. Markham, but there's some gumption in him after all." "He's rough material to polish, but he has some talent; and if he can be made to study, he may be a man of worth yet." "I congratulate you on the very handsome manner in which your son acquitted himself in everything.' "He may thank Mrs. Mitten for his honorsof to-day, for had she suffered her son to remain at school, George would not have touched a single honor. When William studied (and he had begun to study welD he was vastly superior to George in everything. The dialogue was written on purpose to show off his wonderful dramatic talent. George's part was designed for him, and your son's for George; and I'll venture to say, that I can take William and read over the part to him but once, and he will perform it decidedly better than George did. He spoke before me but three or four times *hile he was with me. ; The first time, I read over his piece to him after he had re- peated it, and made him deliver it again; and I was amazed to see how exaetly he followed my reading in every respect. Take him altogether, I think he is decidedly the smartest boy I ever had in my school." Here the conversation was 'interrupted by the congratula- tions of several other gentlemen.   William went home in tortures, and hardly' slept a wink that night. He would have given the world for the honors and praises which George Markham had received that day; and he would have been willing to have changed persons with John Brown, for the trophies which John-had won. The next morning he recounted to his mother all the events of the day, and particularly the conversation which he had heard between his uncle and Mr. Markham. Shd was now stung nearly, or quite as deeply as her son. But what could she do? Her' vow was out and it must be kept. "Well, my child," said she despondingly, " all this only goes to show that you are born to ill-luck. But I hope it is all for the best. Those who are unlucky in youth are apt to be lucky in old age, it is said-and I hope it will be so with you." "Ma, when you get your private teacher will he .have any exhi- bitions?" "No, my son, he will have no scholar but you." "Then  don't want to go to a private teacher." "But remember my child, that as he will have but you one to at- tend to, he can teach you a great deal better, Rand bring you on a great deal faster than Mr. Markham could, who has so many in charge. And study well, and you will soon enter college, where you will have an opportunity of showing off your talents not simply to a village, but to a whole State!" "And how long will it be before I can go to college?" "With your gifts, and a pri ate teacher, I have no doubt you will be prepared to enter college in four years at the outside." "Why, Ma, I'll be dead before four years!" Oh, I hope not; they will roll round before you are aware of it." As the private teacher had not yet been found, William had no- thing to do for the present, and he resumed his attention to public and devotional exercises in fellowship with the young Glibs, and others of their stamp. A few days after this Parson Turner was announced as wishing to have a few minutes private conversation with Mrs. Mitten. He was ushered into the parlor; and Mrs. Mitten soon followed him. "Mrs. Mitten," said the Parson, "I have called on you to beg of you to keep your son at home on Wednesday nights. He and the Glibs come to the church where we hold our prayer meetings, and sometimes at the door, and-sometimes in the gallery, keep up such a C  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7117-00000012"/> laughing, bleating and groaning, that it is next to impossible for to proceed with our devotions" "Why, Parson Turner, you must be mistaken! I have alwa3 taught my child to treat religious services with 'tie most profonu respect; and for reasons that need not be mentioned, I a con dent thathe is hardly acquainted with the Glibs." "No, madam, there is' no mistake about it. We all know hi very well." . "Well, Pargon Turner, I will enquire into the matter, and, if find it so, I will see to it tlat my son disturbs you no more." "Whether you findtit so or not, I assure you madam it is so So saying he took his leave. He had not been gone long whi William came in. ". William," said his mother, do you associate with the G ibs?' "They sometimes come to where I am, and then I can't et rid them; but I don't go where they are."      / "WTell, now, I strictly forbid you from associating /with the: boys. They are very bad boys and unfit company for you. Parse Tuiner says you go with them to the church, and behave very rude during prayer meeting. Is that so, William?' "'Twasn't me, lfa, it was the Glib-boys." "How came you there with the Glib-boys, at all?" "I said I was going to the prayer meeting and they followed me. "Well, my son, I'm  very glad to learn that you didn't misb, have at the meeting. Brought up as piously as you have been, didn't think it possible that you could treat religious services wit contempt. When you go to such meetings, (which I am" glad 1 find you disposed to do) take your seat near the leader of them, an bad boys will not follow you there. Never have anything to do wit boys that can trifle with sacred things. It's the worst sign in ti world."          ,   , Mr. Turner went from Mrs. Mitten's to Mrs. Glib's, and repeats ,    his story. Mrs. Glib received him with a careless chuckle, and said to hinm "Oh, Mr. Turner, I wouldn't mind little thoughtless boys; they wi have their fun; but they'll quit these things when they grdw olde I'm very cautions against reproving my children for little chitdis freaks in church, lest I should excite in them a dangerous and lastin w   prejudice against religion.  ' r. Turner, after sitting petrified for about a half minute, r and abruptly left the house.   About noon on the following Thursday, Mrs. Glib came over to Mrs. Mitten's, in a great flurry. Oh," exclaimed she, as she entered tie house, "Go you know, Mrs. Mitten, there's a warrant out against all our children! I got wind of it and hid my children; but I'm told they've got William"- "A warrant!" shrieked Mrs. M.  In Pmercy's name tell me what has my child been doing to have a warrant out against him?, "Oh, nothing of any consequence-don't be alarmed-nothing but disturbing a prayer-meeting. Squire Crumb says there's no law for it; and if there was, throwing stones at a house and setting off squibs at thb door would not be against the law; and if he was em- ployed, he'd blow it all up. But Judge Dawson says there is a law against disturbing worshipping assemblies. I was afraid of this, when Turner went about complaining of the boys for their little sports. You know such things always make them mad and worse than ever." Mrs. Mitten was nearly distracted; for .her head was filled with jails, and punishment, and eternal disgrace, which she supposed the invariable accompaniments of warrants. Icer brother David, was sent for, post-haste; and he was soon at Mr. Justice Easy's office, where William was under arrest. A short interview between him and Parson Turner settled the matter amicably. The latter told him all that had transpired and said he saw no other way of stopping these hopeful youths; butthat if Mr. Thompson would pledge himself that they would disturb the meetings no more, he would stop the prosecution. The pledge was given, and the matter was settled.- This done, Mr; Thompson proceeded with William to his sister's, where he found the two mothers. "Where are your children, madam i" said Thompson sternly to Mrs. Glib. "Why, they--I expect they are-that is, I think likely-which one of them?' "Why, all of them, madam." "Oh, I have not seen one of them since'quite early this morning. What did you want with them, Captain Thompson?" "I wished to know from their own lips whether, if I get them out of this scrape, they'll let people pray in peace hereafter." "Oh, yes, yes, yes-I'll engage for themn; and I will consider my- self under everlasting obligations to you Captain, if you'll get them out." "I must have the pledge from their own lips."  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7117-00000013"/> 24        MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. Well, I'll run over home and see if they are not there. I've no doubt they are, for they always come home about this hour-what o'clock is it?" "Half after twelve." "Oh, if it's as late as that, I'm sure I shae find them at home. Stay a minute, Captain, and I'll run over and bring them." She soon returned with her three boys, who were placed with Williani before the Captain. "Do ou know, young gentlemen," said he with great solemnity, "that you have violated the lazvs of your country? That a warrant has been issued against you, tovindicate the offended majesty of the people's laws?" (Here the ladies looked much alarmed.) "That, unless somebody will befriend you, your mothers are liable to be mulct in pounds of nioney; and that you are liable to be cast in prison for ten long days and nights, with nothing to eat but bread and water and nothing to sleep on but the hard floor and a few blankets? Then be dragged to a court of justice, before the eyes of the whole world, and there to be tried, by a jury of twelve men duly empanelled to pass between you and your injured, insulted country'? Then, when convicted, (as you are certain to be,) that you are to be turned over to Judge Dawson, (who always respects religion, and whose wife is a most excellent member cf the church,) to 'be dealt with according to the law in such case made and provided? And do you furthermore know, that all four of you are posting to the devil just as fast as he would have you go? 'Do you know all this, my hopeful young friend?" "Yes, sir," answered the boys.  "Very well. Now, I am disposed to befriend you all; but I de- sire to know what I am to expect from youaif I do; for I don't wish to get myself into any more trouble on your account. If I can be certain that you will never get into any more such scrapes, I'll hush up all this natter, as I know I can; but I must have a promise from all of you that, if I do, I shall have no more such matters to hush up. As for Bill there, I'll manage him myself: and if he goes to  disturbing religions meetings again, after the trouble he has given  me, and after I have snatched him from the clutches of the law, 11  give him the timber myself, harder than Markham did, mother or no mother, objection or no objection." "In such case, brother David, I think you would be perfectly justifiable, after you have stood his security and" Certainly, certainly," said Mrs. Glib; " and in such case, I   MASTER W ILIAM MTTEM.    .      25 would not think of opening my mouth, if he should whip my chil; dren tob." "Well, will your children make the promise, or will they prefer going to jail?" "Why, Captain, I would not own them if they refused. They are too high minded and honorable to refuse so great a favor upon such easy terms." "Very well.  George Washington Alexander Augustus Glib: Do you promise me here, in the presence of your mother and Mrs. Mitten, that if I stop this prosecution, so that it shall not harm you or your mother, or your brothers, that you will never disturb another religious meeting while you livc, either by mouth, foot or hand, inside or outside of the house; iand that you will show no rudeness, in any form or way, to Par,-on Turner, at any time or in any place'? Do you?"  "Yes, sir."  "Thomzas Jefferson lNapoleon Bonaparte Glib: Do you make the same promise that your brother has just made?" "Yes, sir." "Benjamin Franklin Pulaski Lafayette Glib: Do you make the same promise?" i"Yes, .sir." "Well, remain here five minutes, and if in that time I do not re- turn, you may be certain that the matter is satisfactorily settled." So saying he retired. "Oh, Mrs. Mitten," said Mrs. Glib, Iwhat an excellent, excellent man, that brother of yours is. I shall love him as long as I live." "Brother David has a good heart, though he is sometimes rough in his manner. Was ever child so unfortunate as mine? It is an old maxim, that one had better be born lucky than rich, and I be- lieve it. Brother David will probably settle the suit; but who is to wipe out the stain from my child's character?" "Dear me, Mrs. Mitten, the thing will be forgotten in a week! Everybody knows that it was bat a childish frolic, that nobody'but old Turner would have noticed; and I shall make it my businesto. give him my mind upon it very lreely, the first time I meet him. I'm under no promise, if my children are." "I cannot blame Parson Turner, Mrs. Glib, and I hope you will not." The five, and even ten minutes rolled away, and, Mr. Thompson not returning, Mrs. Glib moved off with her sons, looking very little like their namesakes.  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7117-00000014"/> CHAPTERT . H. Mrs. Mitten, now determined to keep her son at home of night! she therefore charged him, " upon pain of her sore displeasure," n to leave the house at night without her permission. William promisc obedience, of course; and like a good boy, kept his promise for tv nights andga half, without ever asking leave of absence. On tl second night she seated him at the stand to read to her and h **    sisters. He had proceeded about a quarter of an hour, when thr strange whistles were heard near the house. They were not notice by Mrs. M. as yet; but the first had no sooner sounded, than Willia began to read horribly. "Now, William,"' aid his mother, "you've got tired of readii already; and you're trying how bad you can read, that I may ma! you stop!" "No, I declare I a'nt, ma." "Well, what makes you blunder and halt 'and miscall words sc What does that incessant whistling mean?" That's the way the boys whistle at school," said William. How do they do it! for it sounds like blowing in-large phials "They do it by blowing in their hands." "What are they blowing abouat here for? they never did it befor Go out William, and beg them to desist." William obeyed promptly, and it seemed gladly. The whistlit ceased as soon as he went out; and in a few minutes he returned. "Who are they?" enquired Mrs. iMitten. "A parcel of school-boys," said William, ' but they said the wouldn't whistle about the house any more." He resumed his sea and read pretty well until his mother excused him. The next evening the whistling was renewed; but at such a di tance from the house, as to attract the attention of no one; unles perchance William'from the events of the preceding night, was le to notice it. "3Ia," said he "mayn't I go' td the Juvenile Debating Societ to-night?"' "Certainly, my son; but come home as soon as the Societ adjourns."  He set out, but happening to fall in with Ben and Jeff Glib, b   !,     MASTER WILLIAM MTTEIN.         27 the way, (so they were called for short) they proposed going by Squire King's garden, and getting a few June apples. Ben said, "that Lawyer King was a very clever man, and didn't care who took his apples, if they didn't break his trees; and only took what they wanted to eat." Jeff said that he knew "that to be a fact; for he heard him tell William Strain, his wife's little brother, that very day, to go in with his playmates, and eat as many as they wanted, but riot to break down his trees." "Well, if that's the case," .said William, Ill go; but I wouldn't steal apples for anything in the world." "Neither would I," said Ben. Law, no! Notfor the world." Oh, it's nothing like stealing," said Jeff. "Sposen you was to lay down anything, and say you didn't care who took it, if they didn't break it, and I was to come along at night, and take it, and not break it, would that be stealing "' "No," said Ben, "it's no more stealing than picking up a chip." William had attended the Juvenile Debating Society too long and with too much profit, not to feel the full force of Master Glib's logic, and consequently his scruples were. immbdiately removed and the boys proceeded to the garden. The fence was easily akcended, and they were soon under the best apple tree. "William," said Ben in a whisper, " this is a good place to learh to climb. The limbs are low and I can push you up to them. Whe, you get in the tree, shake down the apples, and brother Jeff and 1 will pick 'em up; but don't shake down more than we can eat; fo' Mr. King wouldn't like that, and I should hate, to do anything he don't like. Don't shake hard. The best way is to get on a limb, and hit a little stomp with your heel, and if they don't come stomp a little harder." Thus thstructed, William, with Ben's help, ascended the tree. He Stampt limb after -limb until he thought enough, had fallen to satisfy the company, and-was about descending, when Jeff said, "Don't come down yit-we An't got enough yit-I can eat a bosom full. Here, go out upon this limb and fetch it a pretty hard stomp or two and thath do." William went out on the limb as directed, and at the first stamp, missing the limb, he fell, and broke his arm just above the elbow. His pain was great, and his alarm was greatei, but he bore them with little complaint until he cleared the garden. He then, broke forth in heart-piercing groans, sobs, and lamentations; but not 16ud enough to disturb any of the villagers; "Oh, my arm'does hurt me  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7117-00000015"/> 28        MASTER WILLIAM MTT'EN. so bad! Only see how it swings about! Oh, my poor dear mother; - B  it will kill her. My. Heavenly Father, forgive me this one time, and I never will do the like again! . I don't want you two boys to go home with me. If you please don't go home with me." His cries announced his coming before he reached home; for they became louder as he approached his mother's door. His sisters flew to him, and his mother rose to follow them; but her strength failed her and she fell back in her chair. They could not 'learn the cause of hiswailing until he entered the house;, when advancing to his mother, he sobbed out, "Oh, my dear mother, look at my arm!" " What, is it broke Y' YEs, ma'am, I can't move it." "Oh, my God, was ever a child doomed to such misfortunes 1 Ann send for the Doctor immediately-I have not strength to move. Send for Doctor Hull and Doctor Barden both." The doctors came, and set the arm. Of course the enquiry was from all, how the accident happened. "I was going to the Society," said William, " and was standing by a tree, and one boy said he'd learn me to climb, and he pushed me up the tree, and I fell down and broke my arm."   $ We will not detain the reader with the many questions which this explanation provoked, and the answers to them which William gave. Suffice it to say that Doctor Hull fetched a little grunt of- equivocal signification, and took a chew of tobacco upon it, with as little in. terest ih it as if he had set a thousand arms broken in this way; bul Doctor Barden was as particular in his enquiries into the case, am though he meant to report it to the Philadelphia Medical Journal. The next morning Squire King came over to enquire "how poor little William was." He expressed, and no doubt felt, tender sym pathies for the boy; but any one to have' marked his Eye, would have supposed that his sympathies gathered about William's feet rather than his arm. This might be accounted for without discredit to the Squire's heart; for being a great hunter, he had. contracted a habit of ex amining tracks, and track-makers, which beset him at times, ant sometimes upon improper occasions, as in this instance. "William," said the Squire with a small dash of waggishness in his tone and countenance which Bill seemed to think very ill-timed' "was it a smooth-barked tree' or a rough-barked tree?" "H---forgot ;" drawled omit Bill a little crustily.'    3fASTER WILLIAM   MTTEN  ..   . .  29 "Did you get up to the limbs before you fell, or just fall from the body?" "I----got to the limbs--"  "Did you take off your oes?" "No."                        . "Aye, that's the way the accident happened. You went up with : your shoes on. You should always take off your shoes when you climb. The Glib-boys, who are the best climbers I 'know, always take off their shoes and stockings both. I hope, my son, you will I soon be well. Mrs. Mitten, if there's a-ything that I have that can nister to William's comfort, it is at your Service. I have some very fine June apples, and I will send him dyer some; little beys commonly like such things." Thank you-thank you kindly, Mr. King. -I know he will prize them very highly-William have you no thanks to give Mr. King I for, his kindness?" -Mr. King retired. "William," said his mother, it seemed to me you were a little rude to Mr. King." "I know him," said Bill sulkily. "Well, you know a most excellent, kind-hearted man." "He's always poking his fun at people.*'" "I'm sure there was nothing like fun in what said to you. I was all tenderness and kindness." William's arm kept him, for the most part confined to the house for five weeks or more;. during whieh time he was quite lucky; for nothing happened to disturb' his, or- his mother's peace. He had ill been so long kept from the Juvenile Debating Society 'that he had become very anxious to attend it; and his mother's consent bein obtained, he departed once more for the arena of youthful polemic He did- not return until the family retired to rest; and in passin to his room he made such a noise among the chairs, as to wake up his mother.  "Is that you William?" said. she. "Yes." "Is, that the way you answer your mother?" "Who put. all these chairs in the pantry?" "There are no more there, than are always there." "It's a lie." "Oh heavens, my child is deranged! My child I my child!

She had hardly got a light and a loose-gown thrown over her shoulders before the Doctor was at the door. They met in the entry, just as William had come the fourth time to a chair which had been headilg him ever since he entered the house. He seized it (for it had naturally enough exhausted his patience) and slung it with all his might as far as he could send it. "Oh Doctor!" exclaimed Mrs. Mitten in the deepest agony of mind, "can you do anything for my poor unfortunate boy!" , "Oh yes ma'am-yes ima'aml. Don't be alarmaed. I pledge my- self to have him  sound and well before nine o'clock to-morrow morning." "Oh Doctor how can you speak so confidently without ever feeling the child's pulse." Just here, William  having got hold of a small table that stood in the entry, and which he probably mistook for a wasl-basin, poured out upon it a villainous compound, of heterogeneous elements, which it would liave required a strontger head and greater capacity than Bill possessed, to keep together in peace for a single nigst1. The Doctor grunted, as usual; but with unusual indications of sym- pathy lfr 3la ster litten. "( Why, Doctor, it seemlls to me," said the good lady, "that I smell peach brandy!" "It seems so to me   too," said the Doctor, "aled scgar smoke to boot." "It's a lie,' said Bill. " -He tells a lie, and you tell a lie." "Do you think my  child is drunki Doctor?" a No doubt of it in the world, madam.  Nothing else is the matter with him." "Then my fate is sealed. I am doomed to wretchedness for life." And she sobbed and shrieked by turns. " .etire to ypur room, madam. I will put him  to bed, and stay with him until he gets sound asleep; and he will be well in the morning." She did so; but it was to walk her room in tortures through the live-long night-not to sleep. . It was late in the morning before William rose. He had learned from  a  servant all that passed on the preceding evening; and it was an, hour after he rose before he could venture from his room, to face his mother. At lenigth he came, and mingled tears of   *   IIASTER WILLIA    MTEigN.      31 contrition with her tears of, sorrow--confessed his fault and promised never to smoke another segar, or drink another drop of liquor, while he lived. About noon, on this day, an elderly, good looking gentleman made his appearance at Mrs. Mitten's and introduced himself as Mr. Jud- kins Twattle. He said he had seen Mrs. Mitten's advertisement, and had come to offer his services as a private'teacher. MrS. Mitted de- sired him to call again at ten the next -morning, when her brother would be present,- whose counsel she wished to have in the matter. At the appointed hour the parties met. "Have you any certificates of character and capability Mtr. Twat- tle?' said Captain Thompsonl.     ' ' 5lore; I presume, sir, than you will be willing to read." -  Y Whereupon he produced a large bundle- of certificitres, running by long jumps throughl twenty years, and growing colder and colder, with very few exceptions, from the first to the last. They all agreed however in representing Mr. Twattle as fully competent to teach all the ordinary branches of an English education, with -Algebra, Geome- try, Latin and Greek. The two first were very flattering, and spoke in unmeasured terms of his skill as a teacher, his talents, attainments, gentlemanly demeanor, and spotless moral character. The two last merely testified that "Doctor Twattle was a-good scholar and fully able-to teach Latin, Greek, Mathematics, &amp;c., c&amp;c.; the. one almost a literal copy of the other.  The first and second were from Vermont --the third friom Pennsylvania-the fourth from Vermont--- the fifth firom' Virginia-the sixth Irerot 'New HaImpshire-and the seventh from Kentucky---the eight from Vermont-and the rest vere- from various places, under the deqsignationa of l"Bethel Seminary," "Be- thesda Institute," "Pineville Lyceum," 1 Buckhead Atheneum," "Goosepond, Literary Parthenon," :' Big Lick Acropolis of Let- ters," "Tickville Emporium of Litelature and Science," &amp;c. Captain Thompson knew nothing of Mathematics, Greek, or Latin, but he could undelstand certificates as well as Newtonl, Delosthenes, or Cicero; and he spared no pains in studying them upon this occa- sion. After he had looked them over until he wore out the patiencc of his sister and Dr. Twattle, he observed: ' You seem to have been a great traveller, Doctor." "Yes, sir. I early conceived a desire to settle in the sunny South; and as soon as I raised money enough to bear my expenses, I left my native State for Pennsylvania; but. my health failing, I had to return.

' my health again failing, I was again constrained to seek a Northern clime.? And thus I went on until, advancing in years, I found that I could not only endure a Southern climate, but that it was now more congenial to my constitution than a Northern one. Thencefor- ward, I have always resided in the South. Having no aim but to spread theelights of science through our favored country; and no dis- position to accummulate money, but a strong propensity to travel, and see the world, I have so ordered my life as to fill the measure of my wishes. I teach from place to place, for longer or shorter periods, as  I like or dislikethe people; but never make an arrangement for more  than two years-at a time. Thus it is, sir, that you see so many cer-  tificates from different places."  "'What gave you such *a strong desire to visit tie South?"  At first, nothing but my inborn roving disposition; but after resining awhile at the South, particularly in Virginia, I became so much 'enamored with Southern manners, customs, talent, spirit, generosity, hospitality and vivacity, that I determined to fix my  abode here as soon as I could do so without rushing,; with my es open right into the jaws of death." 'Emph-hemph!" nosed out the Captain, ponderingly. "What are your terms, Doctor?"                    'X "' Six hundred dollars a year, if I have to board myself and visit H my pupil twice a day, and sometimes at night, (for 1 expect to teach  Astronomy) through all seasons, and all weather; or two hundred, if I board in the family with my pupil."  'I Why, that is a vast difference, Doctor."  "So it is; but I detest taverns so-much, that I would rather sacrifice twice the price of board than board in one at any price." "But you,can find private boarding in the-village, in genteel houses, for much less than fcur hundred dollars." "' Well, if you prefer it; get me board in a genteel private family and add to the tuition as much as it may be less than four hundred dollars; and send the pupil to my room, ipstead of requiring me to go to his."                        .   g Why*not let the tuition stand at two hundred dollars and we pay your board,?"                         "No objections in the world, if you will allow me to board where I please, and allow me every accommodation that I dould have ,at a tavern, and send the pupil to me., I understand that Mrs. Norton   - is a nice woman, and takes boarders. I will board with her and   pledge myself that my board shall not tcost' you over three hun- dred dollars." "Mrs. Norton's is th a dearest-boaiding house in town, and fully one mile from my ister's." "Well, if too far for' the scholar to walk, how much harder for mie to walk! 'Nor can you expect me to let you choose my board- ing house, and fix the price that I shall pay too! Allow me to board ,at Mis. Norton's and I will knock off fifty dollars from the tuition." Or, I suppose, allow you to board at my sister's' and you will do the same'            ' The Doctor looked as if he had committed a terrible blunder; and after a little halting and smiling, he replied: ", Well, sir, you've got me where the owl had the hen: so that I can neither back nor squall . -of course I will." "Are you willing to contrabt for sx' months on trial at those rates?" "Perfectly willing-perfectly wiling-provided you will engage not to turn me off capriciously at the end of six months; and allow me to fix the time of our connection, by our next contract, if I de- port myself to. your satisfaction. Dining, one day with Thomas Jef- ferson, and Nathaniel klacon, the latter made a remark which I have often proved the value of since: "In making a contract," said he always have a little of it on your own -side." "'Are you acquainted with those gentlemen?" *  The Doctor looked provoked at himself, for having made the re- mark and replied in a courteous but hurried manner: "No sir-- that is not-no sir, no. The circumstances which brought us to the  same table, were purely accidental. Neither of them, I am sure, has now the most distant recollection, of me; though we did'interchange some words upon that occasion."  "Well, Doctor, my sister and I will confer upon the matter in hand,;and if you will call at three o'clock, this afternoon, we will let you know our decision." "I will call at the hour," said the Doctor rising, "but to avoid any unkind feelings, it is proper; that I should apprise you of my views of negotiations of this kind.. When I made a proposition, which is not immediately accepted, I do not consider myself bound by it afterwards. If time be claimed to deliberate upon a proposition of mine, I claim the same time for retracting it if I see proper." That is all perfectly fair, Doctor-perfectly. fair."

He had not been in her house one month, before he completely captivated the whele family., So dignifiedaand easy was he in his manners, so neat in his person, so courteous and respectful to the ladies, so rich; in knowledge, so pleasant in anecdote, so attentive to his btfsiness, afd so carelefs- of sordid lucre-in short, so perfectly did he come up to the Mitten-standalrd of the gentleman and the scholar, that he was soon admitted to all, tie rights, privileges and immunities of a near connection, in the family. The girlskalled him Uncle Twatt. William called him Father Twhaddj.- And Mrs.  Mitten called him Good Main, and GooEd Doctor,-and burdened him with delicacies for the palate. The Captain watched him closely; but was constrained to say, greatly to'the delight of his sister, that he didn't know but that he had misjudged the man. '"Certainly," added he,  if he is an imposter, he is the most accomplished, one  that I ever met with; and I have seen not a feW.'" "And now, brother," said Mrs. M"., "I hope You'll acknowledge that /ir once in your life, I was right and you were wrong." "Not yet, Anna. ' Any rogue may be. clever for a few months. I will admit, however, that he does better than I expected, even thus X far."     .          , The Doctor's first quarter's salary was paid; and he laid it nearly i all out in'presents for Mrs. Mitten, her daughters and son. "Good Doctor,'* sai she, "if you could turn these things to any uuse, I would insist upon your keeping them; for it looks like down right robbery to take them ftom your scanty means."

So little do I think of it, while I am able to make a living without it, that I hardly count it as a part of. my estate.

"Suppose you were to die suddenly, to whom would you leave it?" "To some of, the, many beloved pupils whom-I have taught; or to  some one that I might be teaching when death arrests 'ne." "  Have you no. near connections, Doctor?" "None nearer ,than fourth cousins, madam; and these are so. profligate and abandoned, partioularly the one who bears my name,  that I never wish to see them again." "Were you never married, Doctor?" Yes, madam, for a short time; bet----" d"Pardon me, Doctor, for touching that tender chord. I see that I have inadvertently revived long buried griefs,"  "You are very excusable, madam-your question was a very natural one in its place. At another time I will give you the history of my married life, s 'long as my dear Anna lived. For the present, sffice it to say that the little pittance of which I was just speaking came by her;. and-upon her death, I set it apart as a consecrated fund, never to be touched, while I could live without it. You have here another and the principal reasoniwhy I never speak 'of that fund  as my own. But' I have yet another: If the world knew of it, I  should be harrassed and have my feelings lacerated incessantly and insufferably, with idle questions about my manner of life, while I have the means to live without labor, 'as though it were not every man's duty to labor in some usefiul calling, while he is able to do it."

"Thank you, madam;:but pray take no blame to yourself for your curiosity iit rose as naturally from the current of your conversation as the bubble rises from the agitated fountain." Mr's. Mitten possessed too kind a heart to receive presents from the Doctor without returning them with interest. At the end of the first month, Mrs. Mitten proposed to give a  large tea-party, for the express purpose -of introducing the Doctor to  the villagers, miale and female; but he begged her not to do it. . "I W cannot," said he, " reciprocate hospitalities, and I should be pained to receive attentions which I cannot return.

'41 have noticed that, Doctor. You hardly/ever leave the hpuse in the day time, while you often take recreation-rambles at night." "Just so, madam; but there is a better reason than that: the day is yours, (or your son's); the night is mine.' Considering that William never. rose till breakfast time in the morning, and was out almost' every night to a late hour, lie made very rapid progress in his studies under Doctor Twattle. His mother had committed him to .th:eentire direction of his teacher, and as night was the recreation hour, hi' could not object to his pupil's following his. example.  A little incident occurred in the first month of the Doctor's tutorship which must not be passed over in silence, as it. produced important results in the end.  One morning Mrs. Glib called on Mrs. Mitten, and, after the usual salutations and intertogatories) said: I am told Mrs. Mitten that you are delighted with your new teacher." "I am, indeed," said Mrs. M. "WellrI've come over to see if he can't 'takfey boys too. They and William have become so much attached to be another, that it seems a pity to separate them. I have discovered" dowering her voice to a confidential pitch) "that Mr. Toper drinks.. That good brother of yours spoke but too truly when he charged Mr. Toper with drinking. ' ow, I will pay three-fourths of Dr. Twattle's salary if he will take my boys in with William; and that willbring William's tuiti6n down to almost nothing." "But will you board the -Doctor three-fourths of the time?" ' Certainly I will." But he will not be willing to teach four boys for the price he gets for one." "Well, I'll let his wages stand at what they are; and I will double them for my three boys, and board him half the time." "But how will we do? I can't consent for William to go to your house to be taught."   ,  "Well, the teaching may all be done at your house." "But I know that Doctor Twattle would not' be' willing to come from your house to mine to teach." "We, then, he may stay altogether 'at yours, and I will pay part of his board."

'         '  "( Well, what plan would you suggest. It's cruel to part the boys, for they can hardly live out of each other's sight."  "I really do not' see how it will be possible to arrange it-I don't ; think it can possibly be done."  "Suppose you invite him down, Mrs. Mitten; and let us talk over  the whole matter, and see if we can't fix it so that the boys may b6 "i together."'                  '     - " : '! To this proposition Mrs. Mitten readily assented, for she was very  confident that Doctor Twattle would not, upofi any terms, consent to - take the young Glibs. Accordinly, he .was invited down, and in-  troduced to Mrs. Glib. I have called, Doctor," said Mrs. Glib, "to see if you would not be willing to take my three boys under your instruction with Master  William. Mrs. Mitten and I are like sisters, and our children like  brothers, and if you would consent to take my bhildren, you would greatly accommodate us all round." "'Certainly, madam," said the Doctor, " if. Mrs. Mitten desires it, I will take them with pleasure; but being under contract wjtL her, I can of course do nothing without her consent."  "But how could it be' arranged, Doctor?"  "Just as you and Mrs. Glib may choose." '  "Would you be willing to board part of the time with Mrs. Glib?" "I would rather not change my boarding house; but if Mrs    t Mitten desires it, I will even do that."'         I "Oh, no, Doctor, T do not desire to put you to that inconvenience; besides I should feel that I was violating my contract if I did not board you all the time!'-'  "Well, theu, Doetor, how would this suit? You board here all the  time, and I pay Mrs. Mitten half your board?" t Very well, indeed, madam. I should prefer that to moving from - house to house."

"Well," said she, "we can arrange this matter satisfactorily, pro- vided brother David will give his consent that Do:tor Twattle shall take other children under his charge besides William. But you know, Doctor, that he has had the whole management of this business in his own hands, andI would not dare to move an inch in it without his consent. I will submit the matter to him, and if he consents, I will most cheerfully consent that you take Mrs. Glib's sons under your instruction."' "Oh, well," said Mrs. Glib, "I have no fear but that he will give. his consent. You know Mrs. Mitten he stepped forward, unasked, to assist my children, upon no other condition than that they gave him a promise: and that promise they have all kept most honorably and religiously.'

The widow Miiten was not the woman to court anybody-i. e., matrimonially. About a mronth before the first term of Doctor Twattle's service expired, he spent several evenings with Mrs. Glib, who, the reader has long since discovered, (though I believe I forgot to tell him so,) was a widow too. Her given name was Bridget; but not liking it as she grew up, sle added ap "a" to it, so as to make it more romantic. She was rich, and for her years remarkably handsomei  In these visits Mrs. Glib offered the Doctor many inducements to close his contract with Mrs. Mitten at the end of his engagement, and make a more advantageous one with her. How the Doctor re-  ceived her overtures is not known;. but it is certain that Mrs. Glib cherished the idea that afte, another short engagement with Mrs. Mitten, 'he would be at her service; an idea that was strengthened by the fact that when he camd to renew his engagement he limited it to only four months. It was not without alarms that Mrs. Mitten observed the growing intimacy of Mrs. Glib and Dr. Twattle; and when he limited the time of his second engagement to four months, instead of a year or more, as she had expected, her alarms were increased. No change, however, was observed in the Doctor's conduct; and nothing of higher' interest 'occurred for the first two months, than, that Mrs. Mitten in taking one of Master William's coats to mend, found a pack of cards in one of ,the pockets; whicih discovery she reported to his teacher, who promised to cure him of all love of cards by parental reproof and kind counsels.            ' The third month of the second term had just passed,. when a re- port spread all over the village that Doctor Twattle and Mrs. Mitten were certainly engaged to be married. It no sooner reached her ,brother's ears than he hastened to her, to put her upon her guard, lest in her well known admiration of the Doctor, she might say or do something tending to encourage the report. To his surprise, he found her unmoved by her brother's disclosure. If people choose to talk about me," said she, "let them talk. It would be no dis- credit to me to marry such a man as Doctor Twattle, I'm sure, for he has every quality that any woman could desire in a htsband, and not a fault that I have been enabled to discover." "Where is he?" said the Captain, "I'll pack him off, if it costs me my life." "And if we were going to be married, do you think that would stop it? I assure you it would not."  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7117-00000022"/> 42        MASTER WrILLIAM MTTEN.  "Very well, take your course! I see plainly the report is  true. I have one piece of advice to give you, and it is the last that , I ever expect to give you. Have your property secured to yourself  and your children. If you dol't, every hhilling of it,will go to him : as soon as you are married; and do not beggar yourself and them to  enrich a stranger."  ' Rest assured, if we get married, that will be done; and if it  were not, the good Doctor would not touch one dollar of it without  my consent. Of this I have the most satisfactory proof. But I i. have heard him say; that if he should ever marry again, while he  would have no woman who would not trust her property, with her . person to his care, yet that when both were committed to his charge, );i he, would alwayscousider the wife as his, but the property as hers; F and for fear of accidents, he would immediately afterwards settle her property on'her. Not before, because there would be' no merit in doing it then, and great demerit in his betrothed to request it."  "Why, Anna, he's a scoundrel a;s sure as you are born, and I feel strongly tempted to cut his throat. If you're bent upon marrying  him, as I see you are, let me bring a lawyer here and have your! property secured to'you immediately." "What is the use of doing that, when it is certain that he'll make no such contract?"                   .   : "'And, therefore, you're going to marry him without one?" "Yes, but I'm not going to lose my property for all that, brother.  I know Doctor Twattle much better than you know him; and if I were at liberty to give yos his history, you would not even ask me to require a marriage-contract of him-I know you would not." Just here the young ladies, who had overheard the conversation, made their appearance in tears. "I would," said Miss Jane, "rather Ma should marry Uncle e Twattle than anybody else, if she will marry, but I never can see . my poor dear father's place---"          '  "Hold your tongue!" said Mrs. M., sharply. "Ma, you can't blame us," said Miss Ann, "for not wishing to i see our dear departed father's---- " "Hush, I tell you! and speak when you're spoken to."  "Oh, sister," said the Captain, c do let the children have their  opinions. I should think they might express their opinions of even f.; Mr. Saint Twattle, without having their heads snapped off."  Mts. M. was in no humor for this retort just at this time, and she  ',     '     t:ii   MASTER WILLIAM MTToN.       43 MASTER  WILLIAM, MTTEN.        43 showed more independence and temper than she had evinced for many long years  .  - "Well," said she, "' I'n my own mistress, and I'll nmary who I please, if all the brothers and children in the world should oppose it." So saying she hurried from the room. Well, young ladies, I hope you've got a teacher to your liking now!" said the Captain. The girls. each seized a hand of the Captain, and begged his for- giveness for opposing his advice to 'their mother, and promised more for the future than the Captain could have required. He withdrew his right hand from Anna's embrace, and turned his eyes away from them, as if looking for s'cmething that he did'nt wish to find, and with his middle finger pressed something from both, that he manifestly wished to conceal . "Oh, my dearest, dearest uncle," said Jane, "our father, our only, our best counsellor! Will you not do'something to stop this match " "I don't know what I cai do," said the Captain, striving to dissi- pate or hide his feelings hy rough words, "unles it is to cut the scoundrel's throat, to which I feel strongly tempted." "No, uncle, no. Use no violence----" Here William came in whistling "Yankee Doodle," "'You young scoundrel!" said' the Captain, "you've brought things to a pretty pass! Would God you had died at your birth." Why, what have I done, uncle?"  Yi You've filled your mother's hieart with anguish ever since you quit Markham',s sciobl; and you've brought into the house a man who is going to beggar her' and all her children." A"I did'nt bring him, uncle. You know I was willing to go back to lMr. Markham." "Well, to do you justice-but what have you been at ever since! Disturbing prayer-meetinsg, you--little rascal, and running into all manner of iniquities! You'll come to the gallows as sure as your name's Bill Mitten, you young dog-! Do you know your mother's going to marry Twattle?"  "Yes, sir; he told me about it long ago; but said he wouild'nt do it if I objected-- "        - . "If you objected! If you objected. 'And I suppose your Royal Majesty gave yoursconsent?" "I told him,?' said Bill, with humility, for he had never seen his *  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7117-00000023"/> uncle in such a terrific state of mind before, "tIhat if he loved Ma  and Ma loved him as much as he said they' did  "  "Clear out of the house, you young rascal, or I'll--" (Billi; scampered.) "Don't you see the deep, designing knave and hypo-  arite, in everything he does! Using a child--his pupil - . I'll ' smoke the viper out of his hole! so saying he rushed up to Twattle's room amidst the screams of the girls.  He knocked at the door, but received no response.        : "You may as well open the door, Mr.' Hell-cat, for .'1l come in if I have to breakit down." ,  After a short pause, and no voice from within,. he forded open the  door; and behold, the Doctor was not in! He went in search of  him, but luckily did not find him till his fury abated. He went  home and took his bed; 'for the excitement had brought on a smart  fever.                   ,          X CHAPTER V.           ' - At tfie close of the last chapter, the reader will remember that we left Mrs. Mitten resolved to marry Twattle, against the wished of  brother and daughters-Capt. Thompson sick in bed fromover ex- oitement-his two nieces in tears-Billy comfortable, and his teacher  missing. How did Twattle happen to be out of his rooni in the day . time? Doubtless, Mrs. Mitten had advised him to take an airing,  while her brother was swelling. Current as was the report of the  intended marriage, and strengthened as it was by what had passed  between Capt. Thompson and his sister, Mrs. Glib did nothelieve it.  "Mark what I tell you," she would say, with a great deal of self- complacency, " it will never take place." Her visits to Mrs. Mitten had not entirely ceased from the last. which we have noticed; butthey hadl become much less frequent,  and much less cordial than before. And when she heard of what had passed between Thompson and his sister at their last meetiSg, she,  appeared rather pleased tharn pained'by it. captain Thompson had kept 'his bed two days, 'when the Post-- master of the village visitCed him with a .letter in his hand, anda mystery in his face:                       : I  have come over," said the Postmaster,-" to make enquiries of  youtconcerning Mr. Twattle. Here is a letter from a Mr. Charter  Sanders, written at Athens, mailed at Lexington, and requesting an- immediate answer directed to Washington; enquiring, whether there, i 55 'X   MyiA W-lNi1  Y JL 1-aL JVJLJ. Ljw0*  is n'ot a man here by the name of Twattle; and whether he goes by the-name of John, Jacob, Joseph, James, Jeremiah, or any other given name beginning with a 'J;' and requesting a particular de- scription of him. The writer begs me to say nothing about 'this letter; but as I hardly know Twattle, I have come to you for the information required, as well as to let you know that there is pro- bably something wrong in this Twattle, whom report says your sister is about to marry."  ' The dirty scoundrel!" exclaimed the Captain, "it now 'occurs  to me that every certificate which he produced, I believe without a solitary exception, save two which Doctored him, was in behalf of ' ' Twattle; and the rogue's going through the country under every name that ' J' is the initial of. Set down here; and answer it im- mediately; and don't whisper a 'word about that letter- t any one else." It was done accordingly; but unfortunately, thd gentlemen' had not noticed a servant girl- who was in attendance on the Captain; during the conversation, and before the answer was finished, the servant informed Miss Jane that Charter Sanders, 'who lived in Washington, had written about Mr. Twattle, and said his name was John, Jim, and a, heap more names, and' that he was a dirty scoun- drel." Miss Jane hastened home, and conveyed the information to her mother; and her mother to Twattle. He received it with a smile, mingled with a little indignation, and observed:                      ,  "That worthless fourth cousin of mine, Mrs. Mitten } He keeps me making explanations wherever I go. I hope Sanders will find him, and bring him to justice. Now, I must post off to Washington; to see Mr. Sanders, or lie under the suspicions of the town until he comps here. Is your brother able to leave his bed yet?" "No sir; but he is better, and I hope to see him out in two or three days." This day, and the next, the Doctor was out more than usual; and the day following he was missing. About this time; the impression "became general that the Doctor had run away. Mrs. Mitten became very uneasy; and Mrs. Glib came over to consoleher.       '  "Did he make no explanations to you?" said Mrs. Glib. "None about1 leaving ; though I know vhat took him away." "Why, he explained the whole matter to me." That is very strange 1"  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7117-00000024"/> "       MASTER WILLIAM MTtEN. "You may rest perfectly easy, Mrs. Mitten; he will return next Thursday week."                 '  "( Why, it should not take him that long to go to Washington and  'back." -  "Washington! He's not gone to 'Washington; he's- gone to Ij South Carolina to receive a valuable rice plantation, which his lawyer 3i writes he has recovered for him in that State."  ' How did he go?"     .  "I sold him a horse. I'offered to loan him one; but he said he  never borrowed a horse 'for more than a day. He could have no e peace on a journey of a week, upon alborrowed horse, for fear of ac- : ocidents and delays that might injbre the animal or incommode the' owner." "What did he give you for him?"  "More than I asked, by fifty dollars; and when I objected to re- ceiving more than my price, (which was up to the full value of the horse,) he begged me to accept it, 'as an earnest of further and larger favors that he meant to show me-;' so he gave me his note for two hundred dollars."          .! "His note! Why, he had money, I know."          : "Yes; he told me you had been kind enough to advance him  S thirty-two dollars and a half since the last contract with him; but  that, he said, would hardly bear his expenses to Charleston; soeI ,i loaned him three hundred dollars to pay, his lawyer's fees." "Mrs. Glib, he's an imposter; and we have both been made the  dupes of his villainy, as sure as you live."  "Now, how it would distress you if I were to tell the Doctor that,  On his return, cousin Mit."  "No, it wouldn't in the least. He'll never return,unless he is  brought by Mr. Sanders." "What Mr. Sanders?"  "Why, haven't you heard. of the letter from Mr. Sanders, inquir- ing about him, and representing him as a scoundrel, and I know not  what all?"                         e  '  "Why, no. Is there such a letter in town?" / To be sure there is." "Well, if 1 had known of such a letter, Mrs. Mitten, I would  have told you of it."

On the day he left, he borrowed two hunded and fifty dollars of me-all I had-telling me that he had just discovered where a distant relation of his was, who under his name, was imposing upon people everywhere, and constantly bringing him into discredit; and thti, if he could borrow five hun- dred dollars, he would condut.

I 'con- cluded he had gone to Washington to meet Mr. S." "Well, he told me about that cousin, too; and a long cock and bull'story about the death of his dear wife Bridgeta. I told him I didn't, think there was a woman in the world, besides myself, who bore that name  '  "Did he say her name was Bridgeta?  Why, he. told me her name was Anna."            '          " "Why, the hypocritical, ,lying scoundrel! I'll make brother John cut his ears off at sight, i% he prove tobe the.'villian I fear he-is." Brother John, nor brother David, will ever get sight'of him."

'          - "Well, now, Mrs. Glib, we have both been imposed upon; our best way will be to keep the whole matter to ourselves."' "No; I am determined to expose him, and to seek legal redress. I can't sit down quietly under a loss of a fine horse, and three hun- dred dollars, without making some effort to save them. Let people say what they may, I'll try and get hold of this rice plantation at least."         '  "Believe me,' that story about the rice plantation is all a fabrica- tion. Did he tell you about the fund that he got by his dear  Bridgeta?"  ' Oh, yes. It amounted to what he called the ifsignificant sum of ten or twelve thousand dollars, and wie held sacred, and all that rigmarole; which,'he said, nobody in the world knew about, but me; and which he didn't wish to have known.'" "Precisely what he told me i   &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7117-00000025"/> "The infamous rascal! If I was near him) I'd claw his eyes out. I'1 pursue him to the end of'the earth but what I'll have satifac. tion!" So saying she left in a great hurry and a great flurry..  In a few days, Mr. Sanders arrived. His report was that Twattle  had two wives then living whose property he had squandered.  That he had courted many widows and old maids, adf of. whom he A had fleeced to a'greater or less extent; and some of whom he had' treated even worse. That his title of Doctor wasa-assumed by him-  self for purposes of villainy. That he passed under every given ; name that "IJ" would suit; with much more that need not be re- peated. Captain Thompson recovered rapidly after Mr. Sanders' letter  reached the village. As soon as the latter had told his story, the Captain visited his sister, whom he saluted very pleasantly. "Well, sister have you heard Doctor Twattle's history?"  "As much of it as I wish to hear of." "When does the wedding come off?" "When men cease to be scoundrels."  "But surely you don't think ' Good Doctor Twattle' a scoundrel; you, who know him so mucli better than any body else knows him." M "Well, brother David, if you men will be such infamous, hypo- O critical, lying villains, how are we women to find it out?" - A very proper question, Mrs. Mitten! We can excuse Captain i A Thompson for a little raillery, under the circumstances; but we can- not excuse the indifference of mankind generally to the iniquities:of men, and their want of charity for the errors and weaknesses of women. Many a man in high life is in the daily commission of  crimes which would blast a woman's reputation forever! By what law is this distinction made between the sexes?'  'How comes it to pass, that men' are not only indulged in their own dereliction from virtue, hut in laying siege to the virtue of the 6 better sex? And- why is man allowed to avail himself of the most  lovely traits of woman's character-her warm affections, her unsuspect- ing confidence, her generous hospitality, her admiration of what is noble in human nature, and attractive in human conduct-to ruin or  to swindle her? If there be no better world than this, where more . even-handed justice is meted out, than this, God help the women! But 'to return from this digression-              I -  Mrs. Mitten's question stumped the Captain, and he turned the, subject:                  ' "And what are you going to do with William, now?" said he.

'  The Captain tried to convince her that her vow was not binidlng, but without effect. Fortunately, a young man of liberal education and good character opened a school in the village, within three days after Twattle left, and William was sent to scho6l to him. William had just got into his new quarters, when the Captain visited his sister, bearing with him a letter from the Post Office, to her address. i' Anna," said he, as he entered the house, " did you lend Twattle two hundred and fifty dollars before he went away?" "Yes," said she, blushing blue, "but'I've got his note."' Oh, well, if you've got his note, that will makeyou just as safe as if you had got his tooth-pick.

Even your "faults lean to virtue's side"-but like all women, you let your feelings get the better of your good judgment.

Smith, 'but recently from collegh, and coming in competition with Mr. Markham, of course, did not re- ceive much patronage, though few' men of his age better deserved. patronage, than he did. He commericed with sixteen scholars, a fourth of whom  were entered 'by Mrs. Glib and Mrs. Mitten. William, without trouble, and with little study, went immediately to the head of .this school ;' nd he went there only to breed trouble to his teacher, and mischief, vice,' and insubordination. among his, schoolmates. Of all'the pests that can be thrown into a school, the smart boy, without a rival' in it for talents, and' without principle, is' the greatest. His talents give'a charm to his -vices, which is. irre- sistible to' most of his young companions. School-boys make too little distinction between virtue and vice, anyhow. They never- seem to think that their own character:is involved in their associa- tion'with the ricked; nor that they are ludler any obligation to. discountenance sin, in any of its formsi provided it does not invade their own rights. Hence, the vicious are admitted to all, the rights, privileges, and immunities of the little republic, as fully and: freely as the-most, virtuous. Look at the students of a school on the play- ground-mark their intercourse with each other generally, and you will find it impossible to discover from their conduct which of them stands highest, or which stands lowest, in point of moral character. But you will not find much difficulty, in discovering who are the master-spirits among them in their studies. To these there. is a marked deference and respeot shown, even -in their sports. For the most part, their word is law, and whether it be on the side of good or evil, it is equally authoiitative. What can be worse than' such law- givers, when their hearts are constantly set on mischief! For some months before William had entered this school, his ap- plications to his mother, for money,.hadbecome alarmingly frequent; but he always quieted her alarms by representing :to her that the funds desired were for some benevolent, or praiseworthy object. His representations brought from her many excellent lectures upon indi- O *  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7117-00000027"/> 52        MASTER WILILIjAM MTTN.  sciminate charities, and the danger to which his benevolent nature was exposed from imposters, and worthless vagrants, who, choose rather to: beg than to work--to which he generally gave substantial- ly the same reply, namely, "that he was 'always very particular in seeing who he gave his money to." In this he told the truth, at least, since he generally gave his money to one of the Glibs, .:hom he had become very particular in seeing too frequently at thleiard- table. He had been at Smith's school but a few months, before the fountalts of his charity suddenly dried up; and what may seem very strange to some, dried up just as he began to acquire the iWans of more enlarged benevolence. His growing fortune first exhibited itself in a profusion of pen-knives, which he carried about him, from the most costly and elegant down to the cheapest and most worthless kind. William," said his mother, "where* do you get those elegant pen-knives?" - "This one was given to me by Mr. Jones; and this one' found; and this one was given to me by one of the school-boys.' William did not show his mother his whole assortment, by three or four. "I hope, my son, that these gifts are but just returns for the many acts of charity which you have recently done to the poor. One never loses anything in the end by this kind of charity; but you should have excused yourself -from accepting the last, on the ground that yomr had two elegant knives already; and that your young friend needed it more than you did."  "I did tell him so; but he said I must take it to remember him by.' "Well, my son, put that away as a sacred keepsake, and never use it but in case of necessity."  The next signs which William exhibited of his growing fortune, were books, fishing-poles, shinny-sticks, bunches of quills, breast- pins, and cakes of divers kinds. "William," said his mother, " where did you get those articles?" "They were given to me by the boys for doing' their sums for . them'; and taking, them over their lessons-" "Oh my son! my son! You surely did not take pay for these little kindnesses, from your school fellows! I am ashamed of you-- deeply mortified. Where did you learn that groveling sordid, spirit? I would rather have given you twenty dollars, to buy all these things than to have seen you guilty of such ignoble acts." t        4   MASTER WILLIAM MITEN.          53 ' Well, Ma, I didn't wish to take 'em; but/they would make me take them." - ; No matter what they said, you should not have received them. As a gift you might have taken them; but as a reward for such little  favors as these to your young friends, you should have rejected them." These were new lights to William; for he thought his mother would be delighted to hear of his superiority over his schoolmates, and that he was 'already turning his talents to good account. "And where did you get the two breast-pins?" "I sold one of my pentknives, and bought this." "Not the one, I hope, that your friend gave you." "Oh, no mua'am,; the one I found!" "Why, William, you surely have not sold a found knife! It was not your property, but the property of him who lost it; and you should have kept it, to restore it to him as soon as he could be dis- covered; and you should have used your bestexertions to find the. owner, in order that you might restore it to him. I am deeply mor- tified at this act of yours; and if you have any regard for my feel- ings, or your character, never do the like again. It alarms me, and pains me deeply to discover such principles in you. Where did you learn them? Not from any who carries- the blood of your father or mother in his veins, I am sure. ' I fear your intimacy with the Glibs is ruining you. Nothing but dire necessity could have induced me to put you to the same school with em; but I charge you, as I have often charged you before, to have as little to do with them as possible." "Where did you get the other breast-pin?" William was saved a great deal of trouble and mortification in answering this question, by an exclamation of his sister Iane, who no sooner cast her eyes upon the breast-pin, than she exclaimed: "Why, Ma, that is Flora Glib's breast-pin. Let me look at it William, yes, here are her initials on it: F. C. L. G.-Flora Claudia Lavinia Glib. I knew it as soon as I saw it; for I have seen her wear it a hundred times." "William!" ejaculated his mother, with manifest alarm and in- dignation, "where did you get that pin?" 'e4"eff. Glib gave it to mel" "Go immediately to him, and return it; and tell him to give it back to his sister." The truth of the matter is that William had made such rapid im- E  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7117-00000028"/> Ut-       JMAB'I'AJA 4VJ W ILbIAM I'L^i .. 11 . provement in card-playing, that he had become an over-match for, the Glibs, and he was now indoctrinating as many of his school-  mates into the mysteries of the card table as he could find willing to become his pupils; and for the reasons already given, he found nearly the whole school ready to take lessons from him. Most of his ar- ticles of merchandize, (and we have not named all of them) were the fruits of his industry in this department of science; though some of them were, as he said, rewards for his better services to his fellow students. It would have been bad enough, had his evil influence stopt here; but it did not. He had already become mean enough to. tempt his school-fellows to sin in a hundred forms; and artful enough to put them always forward to the post of danger in the commission of it. The consequence was, that, while he got the booty, they got the floggings and disgrace.     J The iniquities of the school were most unrighteously visited upon the head of the preceptor, who, at the end of year, was compelled. to quit the village, for want of patronage. "And what," said Captain Thompson, to his sister, "(are you going to do with your hopeful son now, Anna?" "Heaven only knows! I fear he will bring my grmahairs with sorrow to the grave. Brother David, why do you not talk to him?" "Talk, the devil! I have talked to him, in all ways that I can think of; and what good does it do? lHe has got so of late that when I talk to him I can hardly keep my hands off of him. I can see in the looks and actions of the young rascal, that nothing but fear keeps him from laughing outright in my face." "Oh, brother, I think you judge him too harshy. I know he has got into bad habits; but still, I am sure he respects and loves you." "And he respects and lpves you, too, don't he?" "He must be a brute if he does not." Well I suppose he does love you; but I assure you he cares no more for your counsels than he does for mine; and that hardly a day goes over his head that he does not practice some deception upon you."  "There, brother, I think you judge him a little too ardly again. He generally does what I tell him."      - ' Well, tell him to quit playing cards, pilferin fro rdens and orchards, cursing and swearing, smoking segars,:rnfing spirits, frequenting kitch--  "Oh, mercy on me, brother David! what enemy of my child has filled your ears with these calumnies? He is bad enough, I know;   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN,         55 but he is not a devil yet. I cannot believe he is near as base as you represent him to be." "Yery well; what are you going to do with him?" "I do not know. Will you take him under your charge? for I confess I fear he is getting into bad habits." "Yes, I'll take him, and clothe him and feed him at my own ex- pense, if you will only give me your word that you will not interfere with mymanagement of him. Will you do it?  If you will, I'll perhaps save your boy from ruin and you from a broken heart." "Where would you send him to school? To Mr. Markham?" "I should prefer him; but as I know you object to him, I will engage that Bill shall not be sent to Markham. Indeed, he must be got out of this place; or forty bushels of salt, and as many pounds of saltpetre wouldn't save him. I'll send him to Mr. Waddel. He'll fetch him straight." "I'm told Mr. Waddel is very severe." "Not a whit more than he ought to be, I'll warrant you. I am told his pupils generally like him, and improve wonderfully under him. Now, Anna, if I take hin, remember the terms. You are to have nothing to do with him. You surely ought to know, that I can have no object in taking charge of him, but his good and your peace. If, therefore, my conduct seems inkind, or severe to him, don't let your maternal partialities lead you to interfere in any manner with my authority over him. By this time, you are surely con- vinced of the utter futility of your mode of managing him, and that if some new course of discipline be not adopted towards him, he will / bring himself and you to an untimely grave. You must not only make up your mind to give me unlimited control over him; during his pupilage, but you must pledge me your word, that you will show me every letter that he writes to you during his absence from you at school, or I will have nothing to do with him. Why do you weep, Anna?" "Brother," said Mrs. M., ' it is a hard thing for a mother to wean herself from her own child-to tear him from her bosom, and hand him over as property to another. I know, my dear brother, that your intentions are good-that you have the interests of my child deeply at heart, and that all your aims are for hisgood and mine; but I fear that you have so often been provoked by William, and have become so prejudiced and embittered against him, that you cannot judge of his conduct impartially, you cannot make the due allowances for his faults, and that you will lean as much too far on  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7117-00000029"/> AL.,MO D JM , TV 1 v lo .LlK EL A X L. Gs J the side of severity in your government as I have leaned on the side of lenity in mine. Why cannot you act a father's part by him, without usurping exclusive authority over him?"  "I had a long answer to what you have said, Anna; but your last remark suggests a very brief one, which I think is conclusive. Now all I ask is that you put me exactly in his father's place. Had his father lived,he would have exercised absolute authority over William in all matters touching his education. He would have demapded- or rather you would have freely granted to him, the perusal of all your son's letters to you. In all else you would have ruled the boy conjointly. Now, give me the absolute control of him in the matter of his education, let "me see his letters to you, and in all else you shall have unlimited control of him, I need not tell you why I exact these terms of you. They are indispensable to the proper management of your son." This reply brought Mrs. Mitten to a dead silence; and while she was pondering upon it, very opportunely for its success, in steps Master William, with his beautiful face "pretty considerably " dis- figured with bruises and scratches. "Why, William!" exclaimed his mother, almost at the fainting point, " who upon the earth has treated you in that manner?" "Jim Fox," muttered William. ( What did you fight about?" ' We we're playing and he got mad, and insulted me, and I struck him." This was strictly true, 'but not quite the whole truth. The play- ing was with cards, and the insult was, "Bill Miten, you're the biggest cheat that ever played a card in this town." Captain Thompson said nothing, peradventure, he might at this critical period strengthen his sister's convictions that he was un- duly prejudiced and embittered against her son. With the promise to call the next day for her decision upon his proposition, he left rather abruptly. As soon as he retired, Mrs. M. addressed her son as follows:- "William, I'll have to send you away from this village, or wicked associates will be the ruin of you. I find that it is vain to counsel' you against) keeping bad company, and the only alternative left me is to remove you from it. I have concluded, therefore, to send you- to school to Mr. Waddel, an excellent---" "I'll not go," said Billy, crustily. This was Bill's first indication, when sober, of open revolt againot; ^    %    , .    MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          57 the authority of his mother, and she met it with becoming spirit. "Well, sir," said she, "Isee you are 'getting too stout for my government, and, therefore, I will turn you over to y6ur uncle, and see whether he cannot make you go. Now, sir, my word is out, and you know. I'll keep it." "Ma," said William, in a subdued tone, "I'll go any where else but to Mr. Waddel's school. Everybody says that he is the severest man that ever kept a school. He whips boys just for the fun of it, for he laughs all the time he's doing it. You know Uncle David hates me, and he'll put me there just to have me whipped." "No, William, it is unreasonable to suppose that any man can take pleasure in punishing his pupils. Mr. Waddel's school has a high reputation, which it could not have if he were the man you take him to be. Your uncle does not'hate you; but the town keeps him constantly excited with reports of your misdeeds, and, there. fore, he sometimes seems cross to you; but he has a kind heart, and desires nothing more than my happiness and your good. Oh! that I had followed his advice sooner!" "Well, Uncle may take me to Mr. Waddel's, but he'll not keep me there; for I'll run away and come home as soon as his back's turned." "That matter, sir, I'll leave to be settled between you and him." Here William saddened and wept; and his mother did likewise. The next day the articles proposed were agreed to, without quali- fication, save as to expenses of clothing and tuition, which were to fall on the mother.                          .  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7117-00000030"/> CHAPTER VII. THE articles of capitulation having been ratified, as mentioned in the last chapter, the Captain was anxious to set out immediately with William, for Mr. Waddel's school; but Mrs. Mitten declared that it would be impossible to prepare a suitable outfit for her son, short of a fortnight. "Remember,' said she with a filling eye, "my poor child is going among strangers, where he will find none to make or mend for him. He is to be gone at least five months, even if you will permit him to come home in the vacation; or if you will not, then for a year, or it may be "-here 'Mrs. Mitten's swelling heart stifled utterance. The Captain regarded her for a moment in silence, in thoughtfulness, in petulance, in pity, and then said: "Well, if there be a stranger thing on this green earth than a woman, I should like to know what it is-at least a woman with a smart, pretty, good- for-nothing son. I thought if there was anything in this world that I did know, it was my own sister; but I find that I know nothing about her. A woman! Let her be as good, as sensible, as amiable as she may be, and give her a child, and forthwith her head is turned topsy-turvey. She is as blind to her child's faults as a bat, and she mistrustseverybody who is not as blind to them as she is. I have come to the conclusion that a womian may have a soul before she has a child, but never afterwards-that is, a sound one-a ra- tional one. After that, all is impulse or instinct with her-at least, in all that touches her offspring. She may have a thousand proofs that her indulgence is ruining her child, and she will indulge him still. She will believe him before she will believe any one else; and when his iniquities stand broadly out before her face, she will find an apology for them all. He is 'unfrtihnate,' or i he has been tempted to vice ly bad comnpany,' or he 'is slandered' or ' he is the victim of envy,' or 'prejudcice,' or--  "Why, dear me, brother David,I don't see what I've said or done to calfrth this harangue." "C Why, you are talking and acting just as though I had taken your child from you by force, and meant to afflict him in all forms pos- silile. 'If yolou willpermit hin to come home in vacation, and if not.' Do you suppose that I ever dreamed of keeping him away from you during the holidays? Do you suppose that I take charge of him only to torment him?"   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          59 "'My dear brother, don't be angry with me. I had not the most distant idea of offending you in what I said. I never questioned for a moment your kindly feelings towards me and my child; but have -some charity for a mother's love-folly, if you choose to call it so. I never was separated from William a fortnight in my life. He is not torn from me, but he is taken from me-with my consent-ne- cessarily, I grant, but it is a sore necessity. HHe is to be carried among strangers, to be trdated, I know not h'ow. If sick, to suffer for a mother's care-at- least for a time-perchance to die for the want of it. Now, when all these things crowd upon a mother's heart, is it wonderful that it should be depressed?". "I am not angry with you, Anna, that is-I-believe I am not. I know I don't wish to be; but I am amazed at your want of firm- ness, your want of resignation to necessities; your surrender of judg- ment to feeling; your patience under present evils; and your dis- tress at imaginary ones. I am alarmed at the intimations you already give, of the speedy blowing up of our arrangement-not from a breach of your pledge, but from. your anxieties, your griefs, your fears, your yearning to be with your son, which will leave me no alternative'but to restore him to you, or to see you waste away under their continual corrodings. I pray you nerve yourself up to the exigencies of the cas. That William can stay no longer here, you know. That he is in the broad road to ruin here, I know, and you ought to know. That he is getting beyond your control you  confess, and in a little time he will be beyond mine. Now, think of these things, and let them reconcile you to any unpleasant issues of our new arrangement. Let this reflection quiet, or at least solace all future anxieties about your son. 'It is impossible for things to be worse than they are.' Be cheerful, at least till evils come, and bear them with fortitude when they do conme." Mrs. Mitten promised to do her best, and the Captain continued: "Don't consume time in gathering up an extensive wardrobe for your son. Let us get him out of this place as soon as possible; for he is rotting here faster than a dead rat in August- " "Oh, brother! How can you speak of your sister's child in that way?" "Well, I would have used a more delicate comparison, for your sake, if I had thought of it; but as for Bill-however, get him ready as soon as you can. A few changes of apparel is all that he needs; and let them be plain and stout.

It is made up, I hear, principally of hardy rustic youths, most of whom, probably, never had a broadcloth coat, a linen shirt, ora: pair of store-stockings on in their lives. If therefore, you send your son among them, dressed out in fine clothes, you will expose him to ridicule from his young companions,' and to other petty an- noyances, which will give him a distaste for the place even greater than he now has. Better for you, and for him, that his clothing be cheap, plain, and durable." Mrs. Mitten promised to get him ready as soon as she could, and the Captain left her. In the meantime, William behaved himself uncommonly well. He was too much saddened by the prospect before him to relish either amusements or books. He spent most of his time at home in deep despondency; for as soon as it was noised abroad that William Mit-) ten was going to Waddel's school, the reports of Waddel's severities doubled in number, and quadrupled in exaggeration. Any one, to have heard them, as passed among the young ones of the village, might have supposed that he fried a pair of little boys for breakfast, and roasted a big one for dinner every day. William had heard these reports in all their variations, and they filled him with horror. .Iis mother offered him encouragements with the tongue, but discouragements with the eye, every day, the last, of course, neutralized the first. After twelve days of prepara- tion, Mrs. Mitten informed her brother {lat William would be ready to take his departure the next day. The Captain 'visited his sister that night, to make all preliminary arrangements for the commence- ment of the journey, early the next morning. He found the family alone, for the hour of William's departure had been purposely kept secret, to avoid the intrusion of visitors on this solemn evening. They were all seated around the fire silent and dejected. On the candle-stand, by the mother's side, lay the family Bible open-next to her, in the order of their ages, sat the two daughters, and William rested his drooping head upon the pillar of the mantle-piece. The servants stood around, with their eyes fixed upon him, as if for the last time. They had all just risen from prayers, hurried a little from fear of interruption. The tears which from every eye had accompa- nied the mother's devotion, had just ceased to flow. A death-like silence reigned throughout the group, broken only by sighs more or less heavy, as they rose from hearts more or less depressed. As the Captain entered, all burst into tears afresh. "What!" said he, with a feigned indifference to. the scene, which he did not feel, "All this mourning at sending a little shaver to school!"   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          ($1 The Captain was not a religious nwan, but he was almost persuaded to be a christian; and the sight of his sister atprayer always inspired him with an instinctive philosophy upon "souls," much more im- pressive, if not more rational, than the impulsive philosophy which he had recently delivered. He. glanced his eye to the candle stand, and took his seat in the circle as mute as the mutest. A minute or more elapsed before another word was spoken and the first, to the surprise of all, fell from William. "Uncle," said he, in a grief-stricken, faltering voice, "Uncle- you can-save me-from going to Mr. Waddel's school, if you will. It isn't too late yet--If you please, Uncle, don't send me there- I'll go any where else in the world. that you choose to send me, and not complain. If you will only not send me to that school, I .never will disobey you, or Ma again. I know I've done wrong "--ere the elder sister interposed, kneeling: "Oh, my dear Uncle, you cannot, you will not, resist that-no, your streaming eyes tell me you will not-here on my knees b6fore you, I beg you, I implore you"--"And I, Uncle," said the younger, dropping by her sister's side, "We both beseech you for our dear, our only brother., Why that school, in preference to all other schools in the world?-" "Girls be seated!" said the Captain; and they obeyed him. A long pause in the conversation emboldened even the servants to drop a wold in William's behalf. There was but one of the group who did not; and she felt more than all of them together. Under circumstances so trivial, no poor heart ever ran through such a hurricane of turbulent emotions in a few short moments, as did hers. She had never seen her child so moved by fear before. She had never seen him an humble sup- pliant before; and now, it was to her substitute, not to her! She had never, heard such accents of humility and contrition from his lips before. She had hardly ever before seen the manly cheek of her brother moistened with a tear, and never hoped to see it, by the elo- quence of her boy. Long sinking hopes rose buoyantly from the scene before her; she " would yet see her first anticipations from her. gifted son fully realized "-" her brother's censures would soon be turned into praises; his roughness, to kindness." Anxiety crowded in upon hope-anxiety for the issue of her son's appeal. If suc- cessful, " what then? where then?" Alarms pressed upon anxiety. "If he is foiled in this appeal, will he ever make another-will he not be driven to desperation?"  All these conflicting emotions she bore with marvelous composure; /   &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7117-00000032"/> V O4w     MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. but when the first words of her brother's response fell upon her ear: God bless you, my dear, dear orphan boy!" her self command en. tirelySbrsook her. She crossed her arms upon her Bible, dropt her  head upon them, cried 'Amen! and Amen 1" and sobbed convul.   d sively, loud and long.                      d "God bless you, my dear, dear orphan boy," said the Captain  b you are now in the right way, my son, and while you walk therein  t your Uncle will be a father to you-he will love you, he will serve you, he will do any and everything that he can, to make you happy.  If he deny you anything, be sure it is for your own good. And  h now, if you or your AMother will tell me what other teacher I can  end you to, with any hope of having you well instructed, and your morals well guarded, I will not send you to Mr. Waddel."     a "Can't you send me back to Mr. Markham?"           ai Well, come, your Mother shall answer that question for mee." "In an evil hour, son, I vowed you should never go back to Mr. Markham," said the mother.  "Well, Anna;" continued the Captain, 'in the present state of t things, I think you are released from that vow; but supposing vour. self entirely released from it, would you be willing to keep Willia longer in this town at any school?"     4 "Well, as he is penitent, and promises amendment, if I could feel myself free from my vow, I believe I would be willing to see  him return to Mr. Markham. But it is not worth while to discuss O this subject; I cannot feel myself released from my vow. It is known all over the village, and nobody will believe you put him  p there without my consent; and every body will think I pretended to turn William over to you, just to shuffle out of my vow. Be this as it may, my conscience is involved in the matter, and 1 am not going a to expose it to any nice questions. If I err at all, let me err on a the safe side. I therefore, give no consent to his going to Mr. Mark.  ham, and I would rather that you should not expose me to the sus- picion of having given my consent to it." "Well, William,' resumed the Captain, "that door's closed. Now, hear me, my son. Don't you remember how sorry you were that I did not have my way with you when you were taken from Mr. Markham?  Well, just so it will be by and by, if I do not have my Away with you now. You must get away from the bad boys of this town. Haven't they often tempted you to do what you had fully re. solved not to do?" "Yes, sir." \   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          63 "Now, I know you think you will never be led away by them again, if I let you stay here; but you will be as you have been. You have been alarmed by false and foolish reports about Mr. Wad- del's severity and cruelty. ' If they were true, his school could not be as celebrated as it is. -He could not have the number of scholars he has. I am told he has largely over a hundred scholars, some of them the sons of the first men in the State, and that thousands of people from far and near attend his exhibitions. If you'll go there, and get a premium (as I know you can, if you will,) it will be worth having.  It will be heard of in two or three States.  Come, son, try Uncle's advice this one time. All things 'are ready now-the time appointed for us to go-if we let it slip, you'll be here doing nothing and worse than nothing, for I know not how long. Cheer up, my boy ; yourcan surely stand a school of such renown, and if vou will do your best, you will stand ahead of these big men's sons. Now, what say you, son; will you go or not ?" "I'll go, Uncle," said William, with a promptness and a firmness that astonished all present. "That's a fine fellow," said the Captain. "I wouldn't take a thou*nd dollars for my part in you, this day." William's decision was conclusive upon the family; and the Mother felt herself in duty bound not to disturb it by word, action, or look. She therefore assumed to be pleased, though she was so confident of William's entire and, radical reform, from what had just passed before her, that she would have preferred Markham to Wad- del, if conscience had been out of the way. Anna," said the Captain, " Mary " (his wife,) " and the child- ren will come over with me in the morning to bid Willliam good-bye, and Mary will spend the day with you. I shall be here with the chaise, after an early breakfast, and let all things be ready." The Captain had anticipated some such scene as that which he had just passed through, and to lighten the burden of it, he would not allow his family to accompany him that night.  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7117-00000033"/> a CHAPTER   VIII. THE eventful morning came, and at an early hour Captain Thoimp. son's chaise was at his sister's door. His family had anticipated his advent some eight or ten minutes. Tom came out to hold his horse, while he went in. "No, I won't light, Tom," said he. "Go and bring out William's trunk, and let us be off, for we have no time to lose." The Captain had no idea of witnessing the parting scene. He waited and shivered for it was cold. "Come on, William, my brave boy-come on; we've a long road and a bad road to travel;" bawled out the Captain to the vacant entry. No response came, but sobs and blowing of noses. "Tom! Tom!" cried the Captain. Tom was waiting his turn to bid "mas' William " good-by, and mingling his tears with those of the two fanilies, of course, he had forgotten the trunk. The wind began to rise a little, and the Cap. tain began to backslide rapidly from his conversion of the evening before.  "John!" cried the Captain. No answer. "Sal!" "Lotty!" "Nance!" They were all around "'mas' William;" nothing doubting but that the saturnal-df the preceding evening would be extended to the catastrophe of the occurrence which produced it. The- wind rose a little higher, and the Captain's impatience rose a great deal higher. At length, it gave way entirely; and, lighting from the vehicle, he bolted into the mourning-hall, with a step, and a tongue, and a pas- sion, exceedingly unbecoming the solemnities of the occasion, and exceedingly opposite to his recent experience. The first object that met his eye was Tom, repeating precisely the part he played the night before, when the Captain was so much affected, i. e. with swimming eyes, and mellowed heart, contemplating William. "You black rascal," vociferated the Captain; " what do you stand sniveling here for? (John, go to my horse!") Didn't I order you to bring out the trunk?" "Kigh, mas' David!" said Tom, retiring a little brisklyj "Nig- ger got feeling well as white folks!"You feel, t6o, sometimes." "You impertinent scoundrel! if you aint off for that trunk pretty quick, I'll make you feel worse than white folks." Th6re was a lurking comparison in this reply of Tom, between   MASTBR WILLIAM MTTEN.          65 himself and " mas' David," decidedly favorable to himself; and a plain intimation in it that he regarded the Captain as a clear case of apostacy or inconsistency.  But the Captain was in too great a hurry to analyze, argue, or resent. "&lt; I have been out there for a quarter of an hour," continued he, "freezing, and bawling, and squalling for every negro on the plantation, and not one could I find." (Exetnt blackcs, as from patrol.)  "I have now hardly time to reach old Smith's, be  eight; and to be caught in the night, on such roads, will be awful.  Anna, is William ready ?" "Just a moment, brother; till I tie this handkerchief over his ears; 4the weather's bitter cold." While the Captain was awaiting this process, ten distinct thumps from thebstair-case fell upon his ear, and then a harsh, raking sound of terrible import, when Tom announced: "Here's the trunk, mas' David."  The Captain turned, and beheld one of the biggest trunks of the day. He ran to it and hefted it, as the Yankees say, and grunted furiously. Anna," said he, "that trunk can't go on the chaise-it's impos- sible." "It is the very smallest I could get to hold the boy's things, brother." " What have you got in it ?" "Nothing, but William's clothes, and a few little nick-knacks.'j "' Well, you'll have to divide them, and put them in two small trunks-one to be lashed on behind, and the other to go in the foot; and it's a pretty time to begin that work !"  The Captain was too snappish to be reasoned with; so, by contri- butions from e the girls the small trunks were soon furnished, and the unpacking and re-packing commenced. We will not detain the reader with a detail of the wardrobe. Suf- fice it to say, that after stoppiing n transitu three shirts, three pair of stockings, two under-shirts, one full winter suit, and two summer suits, the Captain saw the two small trunks filled to their utmost ca- pacity with hard pressing; and yet there was a thin layer of clothing on the ceiling of the basement story of the large trunk; we must explain. Mrs. Mitten, with Tomfi's help had placed two blocks of wood in the bottom of the trunk, upon which she laid a nice, clean, thin white-pine board, that was so 'neatly adjusted to the measure of the trunk, that it divided it into, two apartments. The board was lifted, and disclosed one pound cake, one dozen sugar-biscuits, one ditto doughnuts, two pounds raisins, two ditto almonds, (shelled,) one ditto prunes, with chinking of sugar-plums innumerable.  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7117-00000034"/> "William, son," said his mother, "I reckon you'll have to leave these; I don't know how you can carry them." It seemed to be a hopeless case to all, and Bill surrendered with  a long deep sigt, which touched the Captain's heart a little; and casting his eyes to William, who looked like a week's washingof clothes piled together, he said, with a slight smirk: "There's nothing in the chaise-box but a snack, and a little bundle of under-clothing for myself; you can put as many of these things in that as it will hold; but be quick about it!" This was refreshing. It was regarded as a full atonement for all the petulance, impatience, and crustiness that the Captain had exhibited. One of the girls bounced into the chaise; and by the aid of the rest of the company, she was soon enabled to stow away in the box a goodly portion of all the varieties of nick-knacks just mentioned. In the meantime the trunks took their places, the final kisses were dis- posed of, and a minute more found the Captain and William on their way. Nothing of special interest occurred 'on the journey. The Captain gave William much encouragement and good advice and fretted a little at having to travel a half hour in the night to make his first stage, but, as no accident occurred, he was easily reconciled to it. Four o'clock the next day (Saturday,) found them at the public house, or rather boarding house, of M1r. Nelson Newhy, Abbe- ville District, South Carolina. It was a rude log-house, with two rooms, about sixteen feet square each, and an entry nearly as large, between them. , In the rear of it was another building of the same material, somewhat shorter and narrowier than the first. This was the dining room. Six or seven small edifices of the same kind scat. tered around, with little order, served as students' lodges. A rail fence (or rather the remains of one,) three feet high, enclosed the whole. Abont twenty boys of various sizes, were busily engaged in cutting, splitting, and piling wood, at the doors of their respective tenements-the roughest looking set of students that ever repeated the notes of Homer and Virgil since the world began. The prospect looked gloomy, even to the Captain, and terrific to William. "Uncle," whispered he, " these can't be big people's sons!" "Well-don't know-they're pretty rough looking fellows-but -they seem to be very industrious boys." Poor comfort to William. The Captain and his landlord, of course, soon becatne acquainted; and the first expressing a wish to see Mr. Waddel, the last kindly offered to escort him to the teacher's residence. "It is not far out of the way to go by the Academy; would you like to see it?" said Mr. Newhy.   XAo1T'iK WI1LJlAM ML'T EiN.     j  67 - "Very much," replied the Captain. They set forward, and at the distance of about two hundred and ifty yards from Mr. Newhy's premises, they entered a street, shaded by majestic oaks, and composed entirely of log huts, varying in size from six to sixteen feet square. The truth of history demands that we should say, that there was but one of the smallest size just indi- cated, and that was the) whimsical structure of a very whimsical fel- low, byA the name of Dredzel Pace. It was endangered from fire once, and four stout students took it up by the corners, and removed it to a place of safety. The street was about forty yards wide, and its length was perhaps double its width; and yet the houses on either side did not number more than ten or twelve; of course, therefore they stood generally in very open order. They were all built by the students themselves, or by architects of their hiring. They served for study-houses in cold or rainy weather, though the students were allowed to study where they pleased within convenient reach of the monitors. Tlhe common price of a building, on front row, water proof, and easily chinked was five dollars-the chinking was generally removed in summer for ventilation. In the suburbs, were several other buildings of the same kind, erected by literary recluses, we suppose, who could not endure the din of the city at play-time-at play-time we say, for there was no din in it in study hours. At the head of the street, eastward, stood the Academy, differing in nothing from the other buildings but in size and the number of its rooms. It had two; the smaller devoted to a primary school of a few boys and girls, over whichi Moses Waddel Dobbins, a nephew of the Rector, presided. These soon left, and Mr. Dobbins became assistant-general to his uncle. The larger, was the recitation room of Mr. Waddel himself, the prayer room, court room, (see infra) and general convocation room for all matters concerning the school. It was without seats' and just large enough to contain one hundred and fifty boys standing erect, close pressed, and leave a circle of six feet diameter at the door, for jigs and cotillons at the teacher's regular soirees, every Monday morning.  A delightful spring gushed from the foot of the hill on which the school-house stood; and at the distance of but a few paces, poured its waters into a lovely brook, which wound through a narrow plain, covered with, stately beeches.-Venerable old chroniclers of revered names and happy days, where are ye!-It was under the canopy of these beautiful ornaments of the forest, by the side of that whisper- ,  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7117-00000035"/> 68        MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.  ing brook, that we felt the first gleam of pleasure that we ever de- rived from anything in Latin. And here are the words which awakened it: "Tityre titpatulc recubans sub tegmize faigi Silvesteecm tenzii musam meditaris atvena." Our party having taken a hasty survey of these things bent their way to Castle Carberry. As they journeyed on, Mr. Newhy pointed out the ground over which Sam Shanklin and Mr. Waddel had a notable race. Sam had offended" 01(1 Ol oses" (so he were called, even in his prime which he had now hardly left,) and as the latter approached him whip in hand, Sam, took to his heels, not dreaming that old Moses would follow him. But he was mistaken; he did follow him, and gained upon him at every step, a little-Sam, find- ing his pursuer too fleet for him sought safety in lofty leaping; so he made for a brush heap. Just as he reached it, old' Moses fefched him a wipe upon the legs that energized his activity to unmatchable achievement, and he cleared the brush heap at a bound. Here the race ended. The Captain laughed heartily at the story; but William saw no fun in it. Castle Carberry stood on the highway leading from Augusta, Georgia, to Abboville Court House, South Carolina, and about equi- distant from Mr. Newhy's and the Academy. By whom it was erected, we are not informed; probably, by Samuel Shields, an as- sistant of Mr. Waddel, who had occupied it for two years, previous to the time of which we are speaking, and who was just now gather- ing up his goods and chattels for his .final departure from the place, and for a much more interesting engagement.*  Its name was doubt- less derived from Maria Poche's novel--The Chiltdren of the Abby, which had a great run in that day; but to tell wherein the two Castle Carberry's were alike, would puzzle the greatest connundrum- solver that ever lived. Upon the retirement of Mr. Shields, Alex- ander B. Linton succeeded to his possessions, and James L. Petigru to his office (not as some have most erroneously supposed, the Mr. Pentigall, of-the ' Georgia Scenes,') though it was in this very castle that the great question was discussed: "Whether at public elections should the votes of faction predominate by internal suggestions or the bias of jurisprudence?" Mr. Petigru had been in Columbia College, a year or more before the discussion came off. Some two or three students always boarded themselves at Castle *He soon after married a young lady of Vienna.

We think its tenants were, in Mitten's day, Alex. B. Linton, Henry Rasenel, Samuel Weir, and William D. Martin., At Castle Carberry the promenaders re entered the big, road which they had left atNewhy's, having now seen all of Willington proper; Willington common embraced every hous3 within three miles of the Academy. As theyentered the road, a messenger called for Mr. Newhy to return home on some special business. He' gave the Cap- tain directions to Mr. Waddel's, and returned. The directions were simply to keep the road to the next house. A walk of a quarter of a mile, or a little over, brought the Captain and his- charge to the re- sidence of the renowned teacher. It was a comfortable, framed building, two stories high, neatly, but plainly pale'd in--very rare things in that vicinity. Some six or eight more boys, like the Newhyites, were differently employed about the premises. "Do you know, my son," said the Captain, addressing one of them, whether Mr. Waddel is at home?" "Yes Sir," said the youth, springing to the door, and opening it, "Walk in, take seats, and I will call him." He disappeared, and in a moment returned with Mr. Waddel. Mr. Waddel, I presume," said the Captain. "Yes, sir." "Thompson, sir, is -my name, and this is my nephew, William Mitten, whom I have brought to place under your instruction." "It is rather chilly, here," said the teacher, shaking their hands cordially,. "walk into my study, where I have a good'fire."' Won't you go in, David?" added he to the guide, who was about retiring. "No, I thank you,.sir, said David. "That's a sprightly youth," said the Captain, as he moved towards the study,: " and he is-a namesake of mine." "Yes," said the teacher, "he is a clever boy-the son of the cele- brated Doctor Rlamsay"          ,  "What! 1Doctor Ramsay, the patriot, statesman, and historian- who married, the accomplished daughter of the renowned Henry I^aurens, President of the first Congress of the United States, Min- ister to Hollaid, and father of the gallant John Laurens, the bidovel of Washington?" 9  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7117-00000036"/> 701       MASTER 'WILLIAM MTTl  N. This was a cler sp!urge* for William's benefit.  4 The same," said Mr. Waddel.  ,  "Well, I feel myslcf honored in bearing the boy's name.  Before this conversation ended, all were seated in the teacher's study. It was crok led with books-partly the teacherls priyate library-partly, books laid in for the students which he furnished at  cost and charges on. Philadelphia prices. "Have you studied Latin, William?" enquired Mr. Waddel. A Yes, sir." "How far have you gone?" "I was reading Virgil, when I quit schodl." " Well, I have a large Virgil class, which will be divided on Monday. I have found that some of them are keeping others baok; and I have ordered them to get: as long a lesson as they can for Monday morning. Those who get the most and recite the best, will' be put in one cla s and the rest in another. ' Now, you can take either division of this class that you may be found qualified for, or you may enter the Sclcctc class, which will commence Virgil in two or three months.

"' Just where they please, among the neighbors around. They all take boarders, and reside at .diffcreht distances fron the academy, varying from a few hundred yards to three miles." "t Have the students to cut and haul their own firewood, and make their own fires?"        '  "Not always. At some of the boarding houses the landlords have these things done for them, and at all; they may hire servants to perform them, if they will, or, rather, ifthey can; but, as at every house there is at least a truck-wagon and horse at the service of the students, and wood is convenient and abundant, and to beliad without stint or charge, they generally supply themselves, and make their own fires,"                 , During this conversation, which from the beginning to end, was of the most alarming interest to Wiiam, his eyes, wide open, were fixed on Mr. Waddel, who was an object of still imore alarming in- * A splurge is a moral cavort.

From the time that William entered the house to the time that he left it, "shadows, clouds, and larkness ' were gathering and deepening upon hisa mind; relieved only by one faint gleam of light from young Ramsay, whom he re- garded as the concentrated extract of all that was august, and; great, and gifted, and good in the United States, if not in the world; and an ample verification per se of all that his uncle had told him about 'A big men's sons." William .was entered in due form a student of Mt. Waddel's school; and the Captain having enquired of the post ofice at which the students received their letters, and pressed Mr. Waddel to give him early information of William's conduct, standing, and progress, he left, with his charge for Mr j Newhy's. A long silence ensued. At length it was broken by William. "-Mr. Waddel is the grummest looking man I ever saw." "' Pretty sour," said the Captain. "But I don'tereckon he is as bad as he looks to be. The boys seem cheerful around him; and' David }lamnsay seemed perfectly easy in his presence." The 'truth is, the Captain was sore pressed for encouragements himself; and it was the luckiest thing in the world for him' that he happened to fall in with young lRamnsay just'when he did. "I had an idea," continued the Captain, "of proposing to Mr. Waddel to take you to board with him; but'it occurred 'to-me that you might prefer to board somewhere else; and' I am perfectly will- ing to accommodate you in this matter.' "Uncle, H wouldn't board with him for five hundred thousand ,dollars!" '                      , "Well, my son, I will not place you with him. I think the best ,way Will be for you to'board at Mr. Newhy's, for the present.', After you become acquainted with the other boarding houses, you can take your choice among them." Silence ensued, which we fill up with a more particular account of Mr. Waddel. As he was made a Doctor of Divinity soon after the 'time at which'we are speaking of him, we will anticipate a little, and call him henceforth Doctor Waddel.  He was about five feet nine inches high; of stout muscular frame, and a little inclined to corpulency. In limb,' nearly perfect. His head was uncommonly large, and covered with a thick coat of dark hair. His forehead was projecting, and in nothing else more remarkable. His eyes were grey and overshadowed by thick, heavy eye-brows, al-  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7117-00000037"/> ways closely knit in his calmest hours, and almost over-lapping in his angry moods. His nose was 'bluntly acquiline. His lips were' rither thick, and generally closely compressed. His complexion was slightly adust His tout ensemble was, as we have said, ex- tremely austefre' but it was false to his heart; for he was benevolent, affectionate, charitable, hospitable, and kind. '-le was -heerful, and even playful, in his disposition. Good boys. felt at perfect ease in his presence, and even bad ones could, and did, approach him with the utmost freedom. He never whipt in a passion-indeed, he seemed to be in, his most pleasant moods when he admiaistered cor- rection, and hence, astranger to him would naturally suppose that he took pleasure in flogging. It was not so, however. He hardly ever whipt, but upon the rep6rt of a monitor; and after a year or two from Master Mitten's introduction to him, very rarely, but upon a verdict of a jury of students. His government was one of toueking "moral suasion ;" but he administered it in a new wRay. Instead of infusing it-gently into the head and heart, and letting it percolate through the system, and slowly neutralize the ill humors with which it came in contact, he applied it to the extremities, and drove it right up into the head and heart by percussion LHe eeumed to re- gard vices as conrsuaing fires, and ho adopted the engine process of extingui hing them  One, wtuld sp  e thtat moral' reforms, so hastily produced co uldl1 not last; but we have living cases to prove that they have lasted tor fifty-three years, and are still fresh and vi- gorous. It is a vIt'y remarkable fact that Doctor Waddel never flogged a boy for a deficiernt lesson. To be "turned off," as it was called-that is, to lh-e to get a lesson over a seconmd timle, was con- sidered such a disgrace by the students, 'that if this did not cure the fault, whipping, he well knew, would not. He would often mount his horse at eight o'clock at night, and vis it the students at their boarding houses.

One of them intro- duced himself to him a- the son of Doqtor Hay, a near and dear friend of the Captain, in times gone by. The youth was made ac- quainted with WjlliamiT-offered him a part of his bed and study, which were;accepted. Before retiring to rest, the Captain paid a hasty visit to William's new dormitory. He found him at a ,table, with threeaothers, who were studying their lessons before a rousing fire. They seemed very eheerful and, happy. After a fewquestions, he withdrew, and left them  to their studies. -An early hour the next morning found him on his way homeward,     ' CIIAPTER IX. Monday morning came, and William moved sadly to the Acaemy. Soon the students of every size began to pour in from every quarter; and soon the whole school was in commotion. George Cary had got a thousand lines in Virgil I He was to leave his class, of course; for such a lesson had never been heard of before, even in Dr. Waddel's school, where the students seemed to take in Latin and Greek by ab-* sorp:ion.* As his classmates came in, they compared notes, and not one of them had got more than three hundred lines.  "I didn't get but two hundred and ten," said one; "I didn't get but two hun- dred," said another. "Well, I'm at the foot of all," said a third, "I didn't' get but a hundred and fifty; so I'm double distanced, and left, of course." William,heard these reports with overwhelming amazement. The largest lesson he had ever recited was thirty-five lines, and the largest he had ever heard of being recited was one hundred.   He had beeh led to believe that his native ,villag  e was the very focus of in- tellectual illumination and mental vigor, and that he himself was the centre-beam'of the focus. He did not suppose'that, Latin and Greek were made for country folks at all, much less for poor folks; and be- hold, there stood before him homespun,-t Gilbo-shod, potato-fed chaps, P George McDuffie afterwards overtopt Cary, for he recited twelve hundred and twelve lines, in Horace, for a Monday'morning's lesson. We give this name as it was pronounced. We think it was spelled Guille- bou. He was shoemakerfeneral for the school, 'and'one -of the best that ever lived. The soles of his shoes' were about half an inch thiek, and the heels three-  quarterl. The upper leather in exact proportion with the soles. In short, they were brogans in all, respects, of the stoutest sort. It took them about a month to show outward signs 'of an inward foot. Then they began to wriikle down to something lite fkbt-shape, with only a tolerable greasing, they were good for a year, certaiRn.     . ^  ,      .              a  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7117-00000038"/> 74        MASTER WILLIAM   MTTEN. even smaller than himself, lho had mastered one hundred and fifty lines in Virgil, acknowledging themselves the ifag-end of their class, and " double distanced!" His mind was immediately made up to take the selecte class, mortifying as it was to a gentleman of his calibre to have it known at home that he had retrograded; but could'he keep- up with this class He had little hope of doing so; but so shocking was the idea of falling two classes below his home stand, that he resolved to try it at all events. Hle had one consolation, at least, and that was, that none of the school-boys knew of his advance- ment before he. came hither. Withal, he concluded that there must be a something about Doctor Waddel's school that made all the boys who came to it smart, and whatever that something might be, he surely would catch it in a short time. The Doctor soon made his appear- ance; and William signified to him his choice of classes. The school was summoned to prayer, and at the conclusion of this service the monitors' bills were handed in, and the dancing room cleared. The Doctor read over to himself the bills, with an affected seriousness, while a death-like silence reigned around him; his coun- tenance meantime assuming all varieties of expressions. It was very easy for those well acquainted with him, to collect from these indica- tions the general character of the bills in hand; and the signs this morning were of things grave, novel, funny and common. The reading finished, the Doctor began: "Pretty heavy bills! some things' new even to me. Garrett Sandige,'go and gdt the change to settle off these bills, and see that it is such as has the genuine ring!' To a correct understanding of the first case on the, docket, it is necessary to premise a little. John Freeman had beeni exalted for the first time to the dignity of Monitor on the preced- ing week, and he had over-acted his part a litttle; he was rather too vigilant and authoritative. To economise time, while Garrett Sandige was collecting the change, the Doctor sounded the docket in a humorously emphatic and pompous style: Austin B. Overstreet, for being idle repeatedly! What say you, Austin?" "I deny it, sir," said Overstreet. "Monitor, speak!"      ' "Doctor Waddel, almost every day in the week he follows me all about with his Greek grammar in his hand, and goes on in this way: tupto, tupteis, tuptei, (of all the monitors) tupteton, tupteton; (that I ever saw in my life) tuptomen, tupteie, (John Freeman takes the   MASTER WILLIAM   MTTEN.        75 lead) tsptousi, (rather rousy.) I told him I'd spumTd him, (report him) if he didn't quit it, and he 'wouldn't, so I spunked him." During these pleadings the Doctor's face put on all sorts of expres-- sions; to maintain the dignity of the Monitor's character, it was of. the first importance that he should hear him with the profoundest respect and gravity; and yet there was something so novel and farci- cal in this case, that he could with difficulty suppress open laughter. He drew his eyebrows to their closest, pressed his lips forciblyto- gether for a moment, and then passed judgment: "This is a new case-I confess it perplexes me not a little, It seems to be a case in which study and idleness are so equally and in- timately blended, that you can't hit idleness without at least grazing studjy, nor indulge study without indulging idlevess. If, as soon as Overstreet began to make up his compound, you had'informed me, Mr. Monitor, of his experiment, I could have given you a recipe that would have precipitated the feculent matter so entirely from the pure, that we might have dealt with it this morning without danger of dis- turbing the pure; but as it is, with no antecedent law to meet such a case, and under the maxim that it is best to err on the safe side-the side of mercy-if we err at all, I will let the matter pass for this time; but if you come up again, Austin, with such a mixture of Greek and English in the presence of a monitor, I'll teach you the first future tense of your Greek verb in such a stylethat you'll never think of mingling English with it again while you live, unless it be the true English." Before this case was disposed of, Sandige had returned with about a half dozen hickories beautifully trimmed. The Doctor took one, drew it through his left hand, found it knotless, gave it an experi- mental fourish, liked the ring, and proceeded:  Garry- Osko-Sapling, for being idle repeatedly!" * Garry stepped into the ring without defence. The Doctof gave him one cut and paused--"Garry," said he, very good humbrcdly, " that'doesn't sound right. ' My ear don't often de- ceive me." So saying he stooped down and raised up the pants of the left leg, pulled down the stocking, and discovered a tastcful and most artistic binding of the calf and its appurtenances, with long narrow strips of old shirt. The Doctor manifested not the least sur- prise at this, but very deliberately commenced unwinding. At about every yard detached, he would pause and look up to the school with an expression of countenance which seemedo say, " boys needn't try to'fool me." 'Having unrolled about four yards and a half of swath- ,  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7117-00000039"/> 76        MASTER WILLIAM   MITEN. ing from this leg, he proceeded to the other, and did the like. Dur- ing the whole process the school was a roar of laughter, and few laughed more heartily than Garry himself. Having returned the stockings and pants to their places, "let us have fair play, Garry," said the Doctor! "Fair play is a jewel. Now stockings are fair, and pants are fair, thick or thin. If I can't get through them, why, that's my fault, not yours." So saying, he let Garry have the re- maining six with a brilliancy that fully compensated for the lot pleiad. "Why, Neddy, this is an awful account for one week. Monitor, are any of these charges upon your own observation but the first?" "None, sir. They are all by order of the boys whose names are to them." "Explain, James Freer, what is meant by knocking by your nose." a He came by me, and struck his fist as'hard as he could, as close to my nose as he could drive it to miss my nose." Did you tell him to quit?" "Yes, sir." "And did he afterwards repeat the blow?" "No, sir, but he went knocking by the noses of twenty boys in the same way." "' How was your case, Thomas. Murray?" ' Exactly the same as Jim Freer's, sir." "What have you to Pay to all this, Neddy?"' "Why, Doctor Waddel, I was just playing with them. I quit as soon as I saw they didn't like it. None of the other boys got mad at it." "And what's your case, Malory Rivers?"--Malory was the small- est boy in school, save one. "He come up to me, sah-he came up to me, sah-an' he put his face mos' touchin' mine, and he opened his mouth and eyes jus' as wide as he could stretch 'em-putti'n out his arms over me, too, like he was tryin' to scare me."  ' "What do you say to that, Brace?" "I just did it for a little fun-I wanted to see what he would do- and I got the worst of' it, too, for. he butted me on the nose, and I didn't set him down for it." Did you butt him on the nose, Malory?" "  I give him a little butt." "Oh well, the case is easily settled; if you take justice into your own hands, you must not appeal to me. I regard a little butt full pay for a big look,"                " ' '. .       . .     MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          " "Ahd what have you to say, JamesCollier, against the defendant? 'Plaguing wtith a dead cat' is a new offence. Explain!" " e took a long forked stick," said C ollier, "and Stuck an old dead cat's. neck on it, and swung 'her up by the head, and swung the stick on his shoulder, and went all about among the boys like he did'nt see 'em, stinkin' 'em up. Sometimes he'd meet a boy, and when he got close up to him, he'd wheel off another way,4as if he just thought of something, and swung the deadcat by'em almost touch'n 'em. I, and Andrew Govan, and Jimn Tinsley, and Sam McGraw, and Alfred Hobby, were talking, and I saw Brace coming with his cat, and I hollo'd to him and said: 'Now, Brace, I've seen you scatter two or three parcels of boys with that cat; and if you  come here with it, I'll spunk you. He' pretended he did'nt hear. what I said, and kept coming up, asking me all the time what I said; and he knew what I said well enough. All the' other boys run, but I wouldn't run; and he comes to me, and says: 'Jinmmy, I've been hunting all over the school to find somebody to help me bury this poor cat: but they are the hard-heartedest set of boys that I ever saw; wont you help me, Jimmey ' So without saying any- thing to him, I went off and spunked him; and just as 1 started off he turned round as quick as he could, and whirled his cat almost all round me. And I don't b'lieve there's another boy in the world that could have stood, that cat as long as he did, just to have his fun out of the other boys." ", What do you say to\ this, Neddy i" "Doctor Waddel, t enty boys will tell you I did ask them to go with me to bury th at. I don't think Jim Collier had a right to order me away from the other boys he was talking to. If he didn't like the cat and my company, why didn't he go off as the other boys did? They all, thought the cat smelt bad, but it didn't. It didn't smell one bit." Here the Doctor opened his eyes, and showed signs of light which materially changed the aspect of the case. It imme- diately flashed upon his mind, that the weather lad been very cold for a week, and that, perchance, the cat was not offensive. "James," continued he, " did you smell the cat?" "I- didn't stay long enough to smell it."         . "But you say he whirled it round you as you went off; did you smell it then?"  "I think I would have smelt it if I hadn't he6d my breath." I Doctor Waddel," said Brace, " he couldn't have smelt it to save his life. , Call. every boy he says I went to with it, and not one of :them will say that he smelt it." laz         '           t*  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7117-00000040"/> 78        MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.  A number of witnesses were called, and not one testified that. he smelt the cat. Most of them had kept out of' smell of it; some held their noess; and others, by whom it had been whipt, remem- bered nothing about it. "The case is certainly, wonderfully changed," said the Doctor. "Had a single witness testified positively that he smelt the eat, I would not have held you altogether guiltless, Brace,; not that I deny your right to shoulder as many dead eats as you please, and to carry them where you please, provided you do not push yourself, with your charge, into the company of others, and to their annoyance. But you have no right to constrain a student to leave his company, 4 ot his place, or to endure a stench. As to your pretending to want help to bury the cat, I understand all that perfectly; you wanted no such thing." "What have you to say,' Gilbert Hay, against Brace?" "He threw a lightwood knot on my foot, on purpose, and hurt it so that I haven't got over it yet." "Why did you do that, Brace?" "I declare, Dr. Waddel, t didn't mean to drop iv on his foot." "Yes you did, sir---" "Address me, Gilbert-not him," said the Doctor. "Well, Doctor Waddel, he kept carrying his lightwood knot about among th'e boys, and as soon as he'd come near one, he'd pre- tend to let it slip off his shoulder, and pretend to be trying to catch it; and halloo, 'take care of your toes-I can't' hold it,' and let it" fall right by the boy's foot, just to make him jump. He did two or three boys so, 'fore he came to me, and when he came to me, he let it fall on my foot, sure enough." "Is ll this so Neddy?" "Yes, sir; but he shows himself I didn't go to do it." "No, sir, (you didn't go to do it,' but you went to do what you knew was very apf, to do it. So if James Freer, or Thomas Murray, had happened to lean suddenly forward, or been accidcntly pushed forward just as you were striking by their noses, he would have got  a very severe blow; and you Wouldn't have went to do that, either. You have no right to sport with the feelings of others, for your fan. So I'll give you a little for your' nose-fun, and two or .three litties for your foot-fun, and the usual price of idleness unrepeated." Ned had a pair of breeches which Jbe called his Monday morning breeches. They were very full in the legs-trousers, in fact. In their natural position, they hung tangent to the calves of his legs, or * uis   MASTER WILLIAM MTTElN'.          79 nearly so but, by catching them near the hips, and pulling them backward, anl a little upward, they pressed tight upon the shins, and swung entirely clear of the calves, by at least an inch. Ned had acquired such skill in directing the play- of these trowsers, that he had brought his calves through several penal Mondays almost, or entirely, intact. He knew the velocity of the switch, and he gave his twitch just at the instant of its reaching the leg; and at the orack, hands off! the pants were back to their place. Ned stept into the ring, and receivedcthe first cut with his usual success. It was a clear flash. The Doctor, without pausing, went through. the motions of the second, 'but arrested it in its descent, and saw, with a smile, the pants fly back to receive it. "I thought," said he; "that lick made a false report. How was that done, Ned- dy?  ou keep your hands a little too much akimbo for the occa- sion. Hands off, and fair play, Neddy!: Big breeches are perfeutly fair; but no pulling " The remaining nine told (as an-officer said of a park of artillery in battle,) . with beautiful effect!" David Murray, ord throwing a hczo of tobacco in Jamnes Nephew's eye! :.'  David, commonly called Long David, was the tallest/and, for his height, the slimmest student in the school'. He stood full six feet in his stocking.      . "How was that, David?' said the Doctor. ' He asked- me," said David, "to throw him down a chaw o' to- \bacco, and I done it, and it hit him in the eye." "Where were you, David? Where did you throw it down from?" "I wasn't anywhere, sir. Because I am tall, all these little fellows are constantTy running up to me, and askin' me to throw 'em down a chaw o' tobacco, jus' like I was 'way up in a' tree." W "Well, David," said the Doctor, 'chuekling in spite of himself, "if a boy asks you to throw him down 'a chaw o' tobacco,' I don't think you are responsible for where it falls." * "What!" the reader may' be disposed to ask, " did he ever whip grown up young men?"  Not within our reccfction, because we never knew but one who rendered himself liable to this kin'd of cor- rection, and that one left the school in quick time after the commis-  sion of his offence; but tradition said: that helhad done'that thing; and he used to flourish his' hickory with graceful, but terrific vigor of arm, when a little fretted with matters and things' in general, and thunder forth, "'Fll whip you, sirs, from Robert Pettigrew down to  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7117-00000041"/> 80        MASTER WILLIAM   MITEN. James Scriven, inclusive." The first was the largest, the last the smallest student in the school.  A number of other cases, besides those mentioned, Were disposed. of; but there was nothing remarkable in them. They were chiefly eases of idleness in which judgmefit was confessed; but the sessions closed 'With a case of contempt of court, which deserves to be re- ported, first, because it is the only case of the kind, we believe, that evie occurred during the instructorship of Doctor Waddel; and, secondly, because it shows how he disposed of cases which demanded immediate notice, but which he could not visit with the usual penalty, without violating his fixed rule, never to flog in a passion. The last case on docket was just disposed of, when something that the Doctor said or did, now forgotten, led Brace to exclaim pretty rudely, "Doctor Waddel, that's partial!" ' What, sir!" thundered the Doctor from a hurricane countenance. He paused a second--then dropt the switch he had in his hand, and seizing Ned by all the ap- parel that covered his breast, he shook him tremendously. He lifted him high and sat him down emphatically, but not injuriously. He now waltzed him round the ring in the quickest possible time. He then made a path'with him, five feet deep, through the boys-brought him back with a double-jerk-took another turn with him as before, and dismissed him at the door with a push that sent him off at :a I half hammond."  As soon as the impetus had spent itself, Ned stopt, looked back, looked up; looked around, like a man in' delirum tremens, and then set off at a tip-toe, at a rather brisk gait, like' one creeping to catch a butterfly, and discoursing, as he went, in a sort of half whis- per:? The man's mad! The ma-a-ins mad! He's made nme drink, turning me round. If I didn't think 4,'d 'kill me, I'll never budge!" The morning's exercises were exceedingly interesting to Master Mitten, of course, and he was allowed half a day to niuso upon them; for he was without the text book of his class, and could not be- sup-  plied uttil Doctor Waddel went home to his dinner. The forenoon i of the day was employed chiefly in taking observations of the cos- tumes, manners, and conduct of the boys; but part of. the time was spent with young Hay and three of his classmates, with whom he studied during that day. They construed alternately a sentence aloud, and if the version of the reader was corrected by some one of' the listeners, it'was considered as properly rendered, and adopted by all. Occasionally, a dispute would arise between them as to the case of a noun, the mood and tense of a verb, or the application of some' rule of syntax, and the dispute was invariably settled by an appeal  rra   MASTER' WTLLTAU   MTTrEIN. '       81 to the grammar, which each one kept always by him in studying his lessons. Herein, he found one clue to a solution of the mystery which had astonished him so, at the opening of school-f-hc prodigi- ous lessons which the boys recited--and'before the next day he dis- covered another which solved the mystery entirely; it was, that the very idlest of. the bojs studied twice as much as any school-boys he had ever seen. In the afternoon his selectee was furnished him, and he set in regularly with his class. He begged ,to be excused from reading in his turn, as the author was new to him. lIe was indulged; and thus he was virtually carried over his first lesson. -One reading of it, to him, was enough to make him as perfect in it as any in the class, and consequently he recited it creditably. He had hardly con- eluded his first recitation, when the signal for evening prayer was given; the students were assembled, prayer was held, and they were dismissed for the night. Thus ended the most terrific day of Wil- liam's pupilage. We have been particular in giving its history, not only for its effect upon Master Mitten, but that the reader might have a practical exhibition of Doctor Waddel's government. Terrific as the day was to William, it was the first of a long series of days preg- nant with good luck.          * CHAPTER X.  BY reason of detehtion at the river, and an accident to his vehicle on the way, Captain Thompson did not reach' home until near eight o'clock on Monday night; and at his request the tidings of his return were kept from his sister until the next morning. As soon as they reached her, she hastened over to him, to hear his report from Dr. Waddel's school. "How did you find, things, brother?" said shep "I hope you got a good boarding-house, and a co6ifortable room for William tnis cold weather; and that before you left, you saw him well provided with bedding, firewood, and all the other little conve- niences that he needs; for you know he has no idea of providing for himself. Did he seem satisfied with his 'new school? What sort of a man is Mr. Waddel? Is he as severe a man as he is represented to be?  Bless me, Anna!" said the Captain. "What time have I had to 'prepare answers for all these questions.? I got there at ftur o'clock on Saturday afternoon, and left a littlt after sunrise on San- day, so that I had no time to learn much about Mr. Waddel or h'i. school.- Oh, Anna, who do you think was the first boy I go: ac-  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7117-00000042"/> 82        MASTER WILLIAM, HMTTf E . quainted with there! David Ramsay, son of Doctor Ramsay, who -married Miss Lau ens, daughter oft Henry Laurens, President of the first Congress, and Minister to Holland. He seemed to be very well satisfied ther--quite cheerful and happy-fine boy." "Couldn't you have got William into a room with him?" Well-I didn't try-he boards with   Mr. Waddel, and I thought-- " "Oh! brother! I wish you had placed him with young Ramsay, immediately under Mr.. Waddel's eye. I should have no fears) then, if his getting into bad habits." "Well, he can board there yet, if he wishes to, for I only paid his board at Mr. Newhy's for one quarter, and I told him to visit the other boarding houses and select the one he liked best, and I would place him at it. I am'determined to make him just as comfortable and happy as I can, at Mr. Waddel's. His room-mate is a son of our old friend, Di. Hay, of Washington-nice youth-fine school, I've no doubt-one hundred and fiftybsc holars! Industrious, hearty looking fellows of all sizes! Willington is the finest town in the world, for boys. Anna, I'm a little pressed with business this morn- l&amp;g; come over another time, and we will talk the matter over more leisurely." $S saying, he retired. "( Sister Mary,'.said Mrs. Mitten to Mrs. Thompson, "did brother David give you any of the particulars of his trnp to Mr. Waddel's? Did he tell you how. William liked the school and his teacher'?" No," said Mrs. T. ; "I asked him how William liked the school, and he said he hadn't seen the school, when he came away. Hasked him how he liked Mr. WadSlel, and he said William thought Mr. Waddel a very grum looking rman; but that he had had no opportunity  of getting acquainted with him before he left.. But he (Mr. Thomp son,) said that it seemed to him that the man and the place were made for William-that Willington was the most quiet, peaceful little village he ever saw; in i healthy region, with delightful. water, beautiful study-grounds-industrious, hard-working, orderly boys, &amp;e., &amp;c." "Sister Mary, you may depend upon it, brother David was disap- pointed in the school, or William is dissatisfied with it, or both are dissatisfied with the teacher, or the board, or something else, or he would not put us off with these general remarks. As sure as you're born, there is something there that he knows will not lease me. If all had been to his liking .and mine, he wouldn't have waited for questions from me, knowing my solicitude about the boy. He would *   MASTER . WILLIAM MTTENB.         83 have Spoken in raptures about everything. How agreeably disap- pointed William had been-what a charming family, and what com- fortable quarters he had got in--what an accomplished, agreeable, fascinating man Mr. Waddel is, &amp;c., &amp;c. What is the use of his trying to conceal these things from me e As soon as I get a letter from William, he will tell' me all about them, and brother. David had as well let me know about them at once." "No, sister Anna, he cannot be dissatisfied With the teacher or the school, as is plain from what he has said to both of us. I reckon the living is rather rough up there, for he said it was the cheapest board that he ever paid. Just think of it, sister Anna; ten dollars a month for board, washing, lodging, and firewood! The kindest man in the world couldn't supply boys with dainties at these rates. And all this without making any llowance for damage to room, fur- niturd, bedsteads, bedding, breaking window glasses, plastering, and the'like, which is sure to occur ir students' rooms; tor boys are certain to get into romps and frolics at times, and then everything flies before them. Now, I reckon husband Iound the boys' fare very plain at Mr. Newhy's, and thought, maybe, that it would distress you to know this fact, as Williami has' never been used to such lividg. As for accomplished, agreeable, fascinating school-masters------ "Wlell, sister Mary, it may be so; I hope it is no worse. Learn all you can about the school from brother David, and report to me. Good morning!"  Mrs. Mitten went home, and imlmediately addressed to her son a letter, wherein, among olther things, he saidl"As yet, I have learned but very little about the school or your teacher from your uncle but as he seemed to think it promises every thing good to you, I ought to be satisfied. I have always been under the impression that Mr. Wad- del's school was in the woods,-but your uncle informs us that it is in the lovely, quiet little village of Willington. I have looked for it on the map of South Carolina, but A. cannot find it put down there. Now, I charge you,.my dear boy, not to be running about the streets of niglts, to the disturbance of the villagers. You are now, thank Heaven! away from the G-- -  boys, and I hope you never will again fall into such company. I -am happy to learn that you have had the goad fortune to become the room-mate of Dr. Iay's son. It is a long time since we had tie' pleasure of the Dsctor's society, but we never can forget it, and we take it for grante dthat the son of'such a man must be all that a son should be.

So cheap is the board, that I know he cannot afford to bear the expeuse of breakagle. "'I here is another thing upon which I would repeat a caution al- ready given you; you will often be applied to, as you have been, to carry sonke of your less gifted schoolmates over their lessons. Do these little kindnesses for them cheerfully, and for the honor of your name, (.0 not think of charging or receiving anything for them. Study neatness and cleanliness of'person.

Mrs. 'litten added a g!realt many other wise and pious counsels, but as they would be ,of but little intees t to the reader, we suppress theni. 8he concluded her letter, folded it, addressed it to "Master s ilian!

As tihere was no post office at that time in Willingrion, the lettcr wentt to Abbeville Court House, where it re- alined three vlcvks tronl its date before it was called for. At the end of t hat tizne it. was reported to Dr. Waddel, who took it from the office, and the ,ame d1y delivered it to William. Three days passed atw y before ('aptain Thompson found it oon- venibet to g iv, his sister a ci. cunstantial detail of matters and things at Wiliungton and oi tOhe frurth he set out forl Augusta oa business of llhp rtance.

I believe you are right, sister Anna; there is something about Mr. Waddel's school which he doesn't wish us to know; and as for my part, he may keep it to himself till doomsday, for aught I care; I shall ask him no more about it." "Well, sister Mary, he can't keep us long in suspense, for I have written to William, and I shall get a letter from him in a week or so that will explain everything." At Augusta chance threw Captain Thompson and Thomas M. Gilmer in the sa me room of a public house, for two nights. They were made acquainted, and among various other topics ft' coaversa- tion, Doctor Waddel's school came upon the tapis. "That school," said Mr. Gilmer, " just fills, my notion of what a boy's school ought. to be. Plain dressing, plain eating, hard working, close studying, close watching-and, when needful, good whipping." "You are well acquainted with the schopl, then." "Well, not so much from my own observation as from what my boys and my neighbors' boys tell me; for I'm so clumsy, as you see, that I go no where but where. I'm obliged to; but every body says the same thing about the school-that it is the best school in the United States." "Mr. Waddel is said to be very severe with his pupils." "I reckon not. No doubt, if they don't walk straight he gives them the timber, as he ought to do; but all his scholars that I know like him very much, and they seem to consider all other schools as very small affairs, compared with his." Captain Thompson after making a sufficient apology for his in- quisitiveness, fished out of Mr. Gilmer that Governor Mathews had three or four grandsons at Doctor Waddel's. That Senator Bibb had. two brothers-in-law there-that Congressman Early had a brother there-that Judge Tait had a son there. That Congressman AIeri- wether (David) had a son there. And before the Captain left Au- gusta, he learned that Senator, Governor Milledge had a nephew there. And last, (and best known of all, among men, women, and- children, throughout the State,) that William J. Hobby had a son there.  This gentleman was the Editor of the Augusta Herald, and in the use of all the implements of editorial warfare unsurpassed by any journalist of his day. A story was-current about this time, that a lady, expressing a wish to a female friend to have her infant daugh. ter bear the greatest name in the world-" name" her," said the friend, William J. Hobby." Should the reader be disposed to enquire how Mr Gilm'er came to know so many of the grandee pa- Q  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7117-00000044"/> 86        MASTER WILLIAM, MTTEN. trons of Dr. Waddel's school, we answer, that he was connected by blood, or marriage, with all.'but two of them; and one of the two  lived in the same county with him, was as intimate with him as a connection, and had rescued his son George and other boys of this very school from a falling house under which they had taken shelter  in a storm; and the other resided in an adjoining county, and was well known,to him, and a Judge of the circuit which embraced his. county.  The Captain, fully charged with these woman-cooling facts, wend- ed his way homeward in high spirits. His exultation was increased upon reaching home by finding a letter waiting him from Doctor Waddel, As soon as he had reached his dwelling, and had taken refresh- ment--  come," said he, "Mary, let's go over to Anna's, and have our too long postponed conference about Mr. Waddel's." "If-you are going to talk seriously to your sister, to relieve her from-her anxiety about her child, I'll go with you; but if you are going to run on with all that stuff about the whcl: breed of Ramasays, who seem to have turned your bead, I will not go one foot." * ' Well, I am going to be serious, and to give Anna a full state- ment of things at Air. Waddel's as they are. I know it will distress her, and I want you to help me reconcile her to them." They went, and after the usual salutations, the Captain began: "Well, Anna, I have come over to tell you fully how matters'stand at M3i. Waddel's. Miy reason for postponing the disclosure was, that I was in hopes of receiving a letter from Mr. Waddel that would help to reconcile you to the state of things at Willington. So brief was my stay at that place, that I really learned but little of the par. ticulars'in which you are most interested; but I saw-enough to sa- tisfy me, that to all who would hare their sons removed from vioe, well instructed, invigorated in mind and body, and early taught self- reliance, there was no better school than this. But all things about it are of the very cheapest, plainest, and roughest kind. There is one framed house in Willington, and that is the head teacher's; all the rest are of logs, and open at that.". (Mrs. M. turned pale.) "Wil- liam's study and bed room are of this kind. He occupies, it with young Hay and two others. Its-only furniture is two mattresses, (on the floor,) a table, and four split-bottomed chairs. The boys cut and haul their own wood and make their own fires." (Mrs. T. turns pale.) "The fare is very plain-necessarily so, from the price of board. Mr. Waddel is a very rigid disciplinarian,' (they both turn   MASTER WILLIAM   MTTEN.        87  paler,) t but not tyrannical. His government is strictly equitable. Among all the boys that I saw"a- Newhy's and Waddel's, I did not 3ee one whowas as well dressed as your Tom. Even Doctor Ram- however, we'll pass him over. This is as it should be. Boys who cut wood and carry lightwood knots have no use for fine clothes- I need hardly tell you that your boy, among them, looks like a bird of Paradise among so many crows. I wish you had taken my advice in laying in his wardrobe, for I am sure his finery will bring upon him e taunts of his school-fellows. And now I have told you the worst-the very worst. But I have something to brighten this pic- ture a little. And first, read this letter from Mr. Waddel." ' You read it, brother," said Mrs. Mitten, with swimming eyes and tremulous voice. The Captain reads: "WILLINGTON,  &amp;c., &amp;c. "Dear Sir: 'On taking leave of me, you'requested me to give you early information of the standing, conduct, and progress of your nephew; and, as my letter will reach you through the kindness of Mr. Jones, the bearer, nearly or quite a week sooner than it would by regular-or rather irregular--course of mail, I avail myself of the opportunity to comply with your request. William has been under'my instruction just a week to-day; and though I would not venture confident predictions of him, upon so short an acquaintance, I will give you my present estimate of him, for what it is worth. If I am not grossly deceived in him, he is 'destined to a most brilliant future. He was a little rusty in the principles of construction at first-no, in the application of them-for of the principles them. selves; he is master, and he improves in the application of them with every lesson. His class was a week ahead of him in the Greek grammar, when he entered it. He has already 'made up the defi- ciency, and now stands fully equal to the best in his class in this study-indeed, fn all their studies. He is moral, orderly, and stu- dious, and if he will only do half as much for himself as nature has done for him, he will be the pride of his kindred and the boast of his country. You will not be much more delighted at receiving this intelligence, than I am in communicating'it. " Yours very respectfully, MOSES WADDEI."

"Don't you su'ppose there are fifty in that school who have been brought up as tenderly as your boy has?"  "No, I do not. They are all poor boys and country boys who have been brought up to hard work. I may have erred in bringing him up so daintily; but it is done, and he is now unable to bear hard usage." "Do you reckon General Senator Governor Mathew's grand-child- ren are poor boys?-that the Honorable Peter Early's brother is a poor boy?-that Senator Merriwether's son is a poor boy.?-that Senator Bibb's brothers-in-law are poor boys?-that Judge Tait's son is a poor boy? Is young Hay a poor boy? "How do you know that all these mne have sons there?" "I learned it from a bigye'er man than any of them, who is kin to them, and knows all about them, and their sons." "Well, I suppose all their sons were raised in the country and raised to work." "Do you suppose that Senator Governor Mledge's nephew was raised in the country and to work? That William J. Hobby's son was raised in the country, and to work?-that Doctor, Ramsay's son was raised in thre country and to work?

And when a better time than now? or where a better place than among his school-mates of- rank, who all work?"

I've told you so a hund- red times. That, is your greatest fault-almost your only fault,-- that, and refusing your children little innocent indulgences that every other father allows to his children. I have been mortified to death to see my children along side of their cousins. Because men have no feelings themselves, they think women have none-or ought. to have none-" - 'Ph-e-e-e-ew! what a gust! what did you come over for, Mrs. Bildad?" "I came over to comfort sister Anna, who haws most as much to bear as Job had." "I don't think Sarah suffers much by comparison with Ann and Jane-at least if you'd look at one-of Sanford's bills you'd think she 6ught not to."

Now, husband, what will the world say to see you sending off your sister's child into slavery, and keeping your own son at home, with all the comforts of life about him?" "I thought he was in a dreadful pickle at home." "Well, so far as his feelings-his sensibilities are concerned he is; but he's not a mean-fed, mean-clothed, ridiculed slave; he's not tumbled down on a hard mattress, on the bare floor, in a negro house, this pinching, freezing weather. I wouldn't expose George to such hardships and insults, if he never got an education during ash and oak." "I think that very likely." "Surely, upon the face of'the whole earth there can be found some school as good as old Waddel's where boys can be taught with- out being made niggers of."

My purpose is fully answered. Old as I am, I never knew how to comfort women before."  "Brother, I thought you said Willington was a village!" "So it is, but nobody lives in it but students and one tavern- keeper."  "I sent my letter there." "Well, maybe it will go there. You should have sent it to Vi- enna. Come, sweetest, let's be going 1" Go on, sweetest; and I'll come when I'm ready."  CHAPTER XI. FEW men living, have a higher respect for the "American fair" than we have. We regard them  as a thousand times better than men, and do not feel that we pay them a very extravagant comhpli- ment at that. -Nor are we blind to the virtues of the men. There are many splendid specimens of humanity among them; but, as a class they 4onotaequal the other sex in any thing, that tends to en- noble the human race. As good as women are, they would be bet- ter still, if it were not for the men; and yet, with this confession on our lips, we are constrained to say that after all, woman is a very curious thing. In proof of this assertion, "let facts be submitted to a candid world!" The reader has seen with what spirit and dignity Mrs. Thompson reduced her husband to order as soon as he began to cast reflections upon women generally-how he opened a whole volume of family se- crets, that the world would have never known but for his over-latu- dinarian outgivings-with what independence she spoke of "' old Waddel," and his " likes and dislikes "-how sweetly she dismissed her husband-and how his sister was comforted by all these things. Now, after the Captain had retired, and the two ladies were left alone, what think you, gentle reader, was the strain in which she continued to her husband's sister? Why, of course: "Sister, you are to patient-too weak-too submissive. Be independent. . If we don't show some spirit men will make slaves of us. Resume your   MASTER WILLIAM MTITTEN.         91 authority over your child; and take him away from that horrible monster, old Waddel, and his on e hundred and fifty white slaves." You are mistaken, kind reader. Aftera pause, long enough to let the Captain get out of hearing, thus it ran: "Sister, that is a sweet letter of Mr. Waddel's. How kind it was in'him to write so soon. However severe he may be, my life on it, he is a kind man at heart, and takes great pleasure in seeing the advancement of his scholars. It is very hard for a child raised as William has been, to be exposed to Such rough usage; but, after all it may turn out for the best. Every day that. I live I become more and more satisfied, that after a certain age boys should be sub- jected entirely to a father's government. As you knew, husband and I-have had many disputes about the proper management of George, and I have always found that in the end he was right arid I was wrong. We are too apt to let our love get the better of our judg- inent in the management of our children, especially our sons. I reckon it is a wise arrangement of Providence, that men should not have much love and sympathy---that is, as much as we have-that they may not be led off by their affections into too much indulgence. So much better satisfied am I with David's judgment, than I am with mine, in ruling boys, that I don't pretend to oppose him in any thing concerning them, except in the little matter of dresS; and besides you know him well enough to know that when he, once sets his head upon a thing, and puts his foot down, you'd just as well undertake to turn over the Court House with your little finger, as to move him. Now, I see he has made up his mind to keep William at Waddel's, and nowhere but Waddel's, and he is the more bent upon it, because he wants him to contend with those-what was that biggest man of all, that told him so much about Governor's, and Senators, and Judges, and all that?" "Gilmer?" "'1 never heard of him; did you?" "No.' 3 "Well, it's very strange that we never heard of him-we've heard of all the rest of them." But as I was saying: David thinks there never was such a boy born for mind as William. I tell him I think George has quite as good a mind as William-not such a sprightly mind, but more solid. Don't you think so, sister?" "George is a sweet,.good boy, sister; a boy to be proud of, and of fine mind. 'I've no doubt-butthat he will make a more solid, practical, useful man than William,; but '   &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7117-00000047"/> 92        MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. "Well, I've told my husband so; but he says as for talent, for genuine, native talent, George won't do to be named in the same year with William. And that's another very- strange thing in men; have you never noticed it They always think every body else's children smarter and better than their own. What was I saying? Oh-David's head is set upon showing off William to those great folks, in that large school, and have his way he will; so I think, my dear Anna, you'd best try to reconcile yourself to it. Don't let it distress you. Surely, if other people's children, raised as tenderly as he has been, can live through it, he can." "Oh, I could bear it all with becoming fortitude, my dear sister, if I could be sure that William would live through it-that his con- stitution would not be undermined by it. But the change'is so sud- den-in everything! If he lives through it, his spirit will be broken down-he will be cowed-his ambition be stifled. I know William's disposition better than any body else in the world knows it. He can be led by kindness, stimulated by praise; and won by. words, but he cannot bear harshness, censure, and, least of all, chas- tisement. Now, is it not strange, my dear Mary-is it not un-ac- countable, that of all the schools in the world that is the one my poor child should be doomed to at last? When, and where, will his misfortunes end? And now, what shall I do? What- am I to do? I have given my child up to brother David's control, and I know his inflexibility where he thinks he is right. There is onu thing I know, and but one thing, that will overcome, him, and that is my grief; but I do not wish to afflict him with my anguish of heart. What trouble have I given himn! What brotherly kindness has he shown me! How prophetic has been his forecast! How proud he is of my son! Iow rejoiced when he does well! It is cruel in me to pain him. And yet, when I think of my poor boy, how can I help it? Yes, I will, sister Mary--I will strive to suppress my feelings; at least, to hide them from brother David. I am greatly delighted with M r. Waddel's letter. I am sure he is not the cruel, merciless man he has been represented to be." "Well that is right, sister Anna. You %be happy, and husband will be happy, and I will be happy, and we'll all be happy. At least, hope for the best, till you hear fronm William. It will be time enough to grieve when you hear that William is unhappy."' With these words, and two emphatic kisses, moistened with the tears of both, the sisters parted. Now, we could moralize as long, and quite as profitably, upon the .v YVMM -LIYIWIIUV HU -Y--D   MASTER WILLIAM   MTTEN.        93 ,haracter of Mrs. Thompson, as Dickens does upon the characters which he dreams outj but as we detest the repeated interruptions of a story by long dry homilies from the author, we will take it for granted that when we faithfully delineate a character, the reader can draw his lessons of morality from it as well as we can; but as it would be doing great injustice to the character of Mrs. Thompson to rest it with the reader upon an occasional interview with her nearest and dearest friends, we are sure that we will be indulged in a word explanatory of her seeming inconsistency in the conversations just detailed. After long and careful observation of human nature, in all its phases, we are strongly impressed with the idea that there are many women in the world--good women, sensible women, good wives, and good mothers, who are a little imlulsiv:c-liable, under very trying circumstances, such as masculine wit at femine expense, he slurs at she sense, man's snuffing at woman's loving, and the like, to become  slightly excited; and then, as tney feel themselves called upon to ex- temporize without a rmoment's preparation, or a moment's pause, they, of course, do not deliver themselves with a due regard to logical precision, or methodical arrangement. Constrained in their hurry to snatch up any implement of warfare that presents itself, they have no time to consider its fitness, or unfitness, for the contest; conse- quently, they sometimes seize a battle-axe, with-handle so long, that while the blade hits the enemy, the handle knocks down two or three friends at the same time. They send off a petard so mal- adroitly, that, while it only singes the foe, it blows up whole pla- toons of allies. It should be remembered, likewise, that they fight only " to restore the equilibrium"-never for permanent conquest. It would be very strange, therefore, if, under these circumstances, they did not at times seem inconsistent in their words and ways. Now, Mrs. Thompson was one of this class, and one of the very best of this class. While upon this head, let me disabuse the reader's mind of another false impression that lhe may, perchance, receive from the scene of consolations which he has just witnessed. Ile may suppose from the Captain's sudden change of note, as soon as his wife took up the soothing harpsichord, that, except in the mat- ter of G0eorge, and upon a few veiy rare occasions, when " he put his foot down," hq was under pretty rigid petticoat government. Not so. Foot down, or foot up, whenever a material issue occurred between the heads of the family, his judgment was final and con- clusive; but in matters of minor import both acted independently.  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7117-00000048"/> "       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. The jurisdictions of each were early defined after the marriage; to the madam was assigned the house, the kitchen, the smoke house, and the garden, in absolute sovereignty; to himself, all other inter- ests were accorded. After children were born to them, all fell un- der her jurisdiction up to the age of six; then, the Captain assumed a little authority over the' males, up to ten, when he reversed the order of things, he becoming principal and she secondary. 'As to the females, he claimed no privileges, but the very humble ones of grunting and turning up his nose occasionally at their flounces, and of grumbling annually (vide supra,) at their store bills. Small as these things were, they were unconstitutional encroachments, for which he received the due retributions, ,to which he submitted with no other signs of impatience than perpetrating 4 joke, or. a witticism, in the midst of them, always under the pain of double punishment- yes, he was guilty at times oaf other encroachments in the way of certain significant "l Hulps !" at pale coffee, undone biscuits, burnt meat, and the like, at meals; to which she responded in the following apologetic terms:  ' IWhen your negroes cease to be masters and mistresses of the fa- mily, maybe you'll get somethingfit to eat."  To which, at the ear- liest convenient opportunity, she added an amendment, in manner and form following, to-wit: "1 suppose you (little Sueky,) think that because the grown nig- gers are allowed 'to run over me, and do as they please, You can do so too; but I'll teach you Letter Mliss.

By means whereof the most insignificant subjects of said Government had come to regard themselves Emperors and Empres- ses, and to deport themselves to the said Mary accordingly.  To these impeachments, the Captain filed no plea; '"sometimes pretending " that heI was too deaf, and at others too busy to hear them. Nor did the madam always keep within her legitimate domain.

The equilibrium was beautifully preserved in the Captain's family.  From all this, it appears that Thompson was no farther under petti coat government than all husbands are, and ll good husbands ought to be. He was a very hap y man in his family, and his wife was as happy as he was. Before his wife returned 'from the visit of consolations, the Cap- tain had, finished a short letter to William, reporting Doctor, Wad- del's opinion of him, the gratification it afforded his mother jn par- ticular, and his connections in general-urging him not to disapoint the high expectations which had been raised of him-to be studious -not to mind the taunts of the boys about his fine clothes-to wear them out.as quick as possible with lightwood knots, and' get plain, coarse ones.  "-Let the boys see," said the Captain, ' that if you do not know how to work, you can soon learn. Beat them in every thing. 3Beat thecm. in learning, in working, in running, in jumping, in wrestling, in athletic sports of every kind. That is the way to make them respect you."  We must not let the reader sup- pose that the Captain omitted the important matter of diet, though he expressed himself upon it ih very coarse terms -withal, they are characteristic:  Don't let your head be always running ppon what is to go into your paunch."  The Captain was. just folding his letter, when his wife returned. "Well, Mary,"' said he, " and how did Anna seem when you left her ?' "Why, poor dear soul, it's enough to make one's heart bleed to see her.  She does try her very best to become reconciled to Wil- liam's lot, but it seems impossible. If you could have heard her when she talked about your kindness to her, and how it increased her griefs t know how they afflicted you, it would have filled your eyes with tears.

This may seem strange to the reader of the present day, when com- munications pass between New York and New Orleans in a few min- utes and letters pass between them by the due course of mail in'five or six days. But the matter is easily explained. In the good old days of President Jefferson, people were not as much like the Athe nians as they are now-that is, so greedy of news that they could think of nothing else; and had they been, they would have deemed it utterly impracticable to send a letter by public conveyance over sixty miles, in less than two days, excluding stoppages. And if Dogfight post office lay on the way, and rain fell between times, the post-boy was commended if he came up to schedule time. But if Dogfight and Possum.town post offices both lay on the way, and a storm intervened, three days to sixty miles was considered but a scant allowance. No mails were carried in Georgia by vehicles, but the mails between Augusta and Savavnah; none in South Carolina, we believe, but between Charleston and Columbia. All others were horse mails, commonly in charge of boys under nineteen years of age. These took their rest at night, and took shelter from rain in the day, as their health required. The vehicles called stages carried passen- gers as well as mails. They, too, stopt for the night, and well for the passengers that they did; for Waddel's shaking of Brace was a comfort compared to the shaking and bouncing of passengers in these vehicles, when going over rooty, rutty, and stony ground. The facetious Oliver H. Prince, who was toothless in front, upon- being asked how he lost his teeth, replied, "that, they were jolted out by traveling over Georgia roads in a stick sulky." If this were true, teeth must have been scarce among the stage passengers between Augusta and Savannah, sandy as the road was for the most part.@ Besides the tardiness of 'the mails, there was another 'more serious *Post Coaches were introduced in South Carolina and Georgia by Eleazer Early, in 1825, we think; and we know that the first passengers in one of them were Gen. Thomas Glascock, Major Freeman Walker, and the writer, of Geor- gia, and Col.

The nearest post office to Willington was, as we have intimated, at Vienna, six miles from the Academy; and in all Willington proper or common theyre was but one horse that could al- ways be had for hire, and that was Southerland's pld Botherem. Now, for a student to wait the revolution of fifty or sixty Saturdays before his turn to hire old Botherem rolled round, would have been distressingly dilatory.  Withal, to hire him just to mail a letter, ,was "'rather fatiguing to the finances" of the youth of this Institution, which were exceedingly reduced in those days. To walk six miles to mail a letter, was out of the question. The only alternative left, and that which was uuiversally adopted, was to take the chance of a visitor to the village on business, br pleasure, and the chance of hear- ing of his intended departure before -it occurred, and the chance of seeing the visitor ad interinm and the chance of his being willing to bear the letter, and the chance of his not forgetting to mail it after he took, charge of it.  It might be, therefore, especially with a new comer to the school, several weeks before all these contingencies would result favorably to the writer, and so it was with William. His letter to his mother made his fare even worse than it was, by a total omission of wheat biscuit at least once in three weeks, and somuetimes oftener, and butter " semi-occasionally," and fresh pork for middling, every now and then; chicken pie twice or thrice a year; and turkey as often as old Maner* could kill'a wild one, which happened about once in two years; and venison as often as old Maner could kill a deer, which happened once in three years. Of course, master Mitten was not to blame for omitting all these things, for even biscuit-time had not rolled round when he wrote; but it is due to the kind-hearted landlord and landlady, that Mitten'd repbrt should receive the just qualifications.  After descanting upon his board and lodging, he proceeded as follows: "All I ever heard about old Waddel, is true. He whips ten times as much as Mr. Markham does, and twice as hard, and laughs and chuckles all the time he is doing it, like it made his heart glad to cut boys' legs all to pieces. "Last Monday morning, one boy named Ned Brace made him mad, and he caught him by the throat .with both hands, and lifted him up, and slammed him down, and jerked him all about among the boys, till I thought he would have killed him; and I wish he had, for he does' nothing but torment me every chance he gets.

I told him thle I did not knoW what he- meant. 'I mean,' says he, 'how long will  it be before your shirt begins to peep out 6f your. breeches and o jacket?' Then he tells me I am the prettiest boy he ever laid his tis eyes on, and have got the prettiest little hands and feet that be ever  did see, and that it almost makes him cry his eyes out to think that my pretty hands will have to touch lightwood knots; and that I never  shall do it, for he will get a nice little pair of tongs for me to pick l up the knots with, and a pretty little band-box for me to carry them in. The other day he squalled out to me, right before all the boys,  Oh, Bill Mitten, I have found you out, have I ? I suspected it as to soon as I saw you, but I thought nobody would do such a thing.' "What do you mean?' said I. ' What have I done?' "Why,' says he, ' you have come here in boy's clothes, and you ael know very well that you are a girl; and I believe you are the very ne girl that looked so hard at me in church last vacation.' I knew you  loved me, but I never thought you would follow me here in that  plight. What do you expect me to do?  Do you. think I would marry any girl in the world that acts that way?'  "Here, I ordered the monitor to set him down for making game  of me, and telling lies; and I do hope old Waddel Will give him twice the choking and jerking He gave him last Monday.

Waddel does not require them to study at their boarding-houses, though they almost all do it." This was true from 1805 to 1808, but about the latter period, a shoal of city youths entered the school, who abused their privileges so much that they were curtailed one by one, until at length the students were forbidden the use of fire-arms, were required to retire to rest at 9 o'clock P. M., if not dngaged in study beyond that hour, to consume but fifteen minutes at their meals, and to rise with the sun every morning. It is a remarkable fact, that, with two or three exceptions, no student who entered this school between the years 1806 and 1810, from the .largest cities of Georgia and South Caro. lina, ever became greatly distinguished; while the period including   MASTER  WILLIAM MTrEN.      .   99 those dates was the most'fruitful of great men of any of the same length, during the whole time of Doctor Waddel's instructorship.* Master Mitten closed his letter with a most earnest appeal to his mother  to do all that she could to get his uncle to remove him from this school.'  She forthwith dispatched a messenger to the Captain, whowas soon at her side. He found her weeping, of course. The letter was handed to him, and he commenced reading it gravely; but when he reached the complaiits lagainst Ned Brace, he began to laugh, andalaughed more and more immoderately as he progressed.

He is now convenient to the 'Academy,' with pleasant  room-mates, acquainted with the boarders, his landlord and landlady,. and, doubtless, better satisfied upon the whbole than he will be any  where else. Now, would you put him among strangers,'with what kind of a room-mate you know not, and have him walk from one to three miles every night and morning, through winter storm, and summer heat, just to have him a little better fed than he is, and to remove him from the taunts of one waggish boy?" Mrs. Mitten pondered over these sayings sadly for, a time, and - then rejoined: "Now, brother, you're always ascribing William's misfortunes to my folly or weakness; tell me candidly, isn't it bad luck, and nothing but bad luck, that Mr. Waddel's school happens to fall in the woods? That William should be compelled to endure such rough fare? And that he should hav  fallen into the same boarding house with that tantalizing Ned Br ace?" "Well, as Bill is--that is, as you have' made himi-I don't know- ,but that his falling in with Brace may be considered rather unlucky; but if he had been raised as he should. have been, lie would proba- bly have been able to stop Brace's mouth without appealing to Mr. Waddel. But as he is, why doesn't he give Brace as good as he sends? If Brace ridicules his fine clothes, why doesn't he ridicule Brace's coarse and dirty ones! If le'admires Bill's ,pretty face, why does not Bill laugh at his ugly one! If he calls Bill a pretty girl, why does not Bill call him an ugly wench That's the way to meet such larks as Brace; not to play the girl before him, sure enough. "As to the fare, I consider that sheer good luck. It's high time that Bill had the'cakes, and the sugar-plums with which you have been staffing him all his life purged out of himt-"  "Why, brother! where did you learn your coarse language? Not from your father or mother, I know."  'I learned it from William's bringing up; the like of which you never saw in your, mother's family, I know.

There was set in the centre of the table a pepper-box, and a salt-cellar, the last after t'he fashion of a morning-glory on the fbotof a wine-glass. On either side of said salt-cellar, and equidistant from it-say nine inch- es-two table-spoons of solid silver crossed each other, bowls down- ward, and two more lay, the one at- ather's pate, and the other where the fried chicken was to be;, on mother's side of the first brace, was placed a little glass bucket, like a doctor's mortar, full of rich yellow. butter, frizzled all over, pine-burr fashion. Now came in a plate of beautiful biscuit; then an equally beautiful loaf of light-bread; then a plate of new-fashioned corn bread, parceled out by the spoonful, and baked in the shape that the spoon gave it. Then came in a dish of nice fried ham-then anotherof. fried chicken, dressed off with cream, and flour doings, and parsey; then another of broiled chick. en, put up as now, with wings aki itJo, and legs booted in its own skin; then came two bowls of boiled "cgg, the one hard and the other soft-not the bowls, but the eggs. All this accomplished, the napkin was removed, and oh! what a sightwas there! A china te-pot, six cups and si4 saucers, all real china, and all with red pictures on them, of things I had never seen, and have never since seen! A proud, ctandyish, pot-bellied, narrow-necked, big-mouthed, thin-skinned sil. ver cream-pot, strutted out among the china, and turned down its only lip, at everything it faced, most isul;tingly. A silver sugar-dish, shapd like the half of' a small muskmelon, stood modestly by the dapper cream-pot. Mother picks up the little dandy, and turns him bottom upwards, tomake him disghrge six silver tea-spoons that he had swallowed. The handles appear, fut the bowls stick in his# throat. She rights him, gives is eait a pat on the table, and turns him up again; but he can't deliver. She therefore picks out of him one spoon at a time, and lays it in a saucer by the side of'a cup. She now orders Silvy to bring in "the (ittle pitcher of cream." The little pitcher appears (pure crockery) with half its lip bit off, and the han- dle gone, and an ugly crack meandering from the upper oot of the handle towards the disfigured lip. The little gentlernan is carefully filled trom the pitcher, his mouth is wiped' elean, and he is set up to make mouths it me till the company chines. Tho pitcher goes back to the dairy privately. Dick is ordered to bring in thlecoffee, and it appears in a large tin coffee-pot. The tea-pot is filled out of it, and it is ordered back to the fire in the lito'leu: All things are now in order, and I am directed to inform the company that breakfast is ready.. And now, Mrs. Anna Mitrten, you have had a full display of      MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          103 all the crockery, china,/ and silver, that your mother possessed from the year 1773 to theyear 1787, when the whole disappeared with sister Jane, upon her marriage."' "You surely mistake some things, brother,"' said Mrs. Mitten, smiling, "and, therefore, it is quite likely you mistake the amount and kind of mother's table-ware. Mother never let us saunter about the table when she was fixing for company., She never sent you in your coarse clothing to call American officers to breakfast--" "sJust stop there a moment, sister, and 'll explain matters to your entire satisfaction. When mother invited me over touncle's for the evening, she invited me home again at day break the nextmorning. I accepted the invitation, and was prompt to the time, knowing that ladies always get in a pucker when fixing for company, especially for 'the Quality,' and that it would have been very undutiful in me to add a scruple's weight to mother's disturbance of mind upon such occasions. I know I should have reflected upon it with pai, as soon as the company retired. 'Go,' said mother, on meeting me, 'to+ spring, and fetch a keeler of water, and take it up in the loft, and wash and dress yourself, and come down to my room; you will find your clean clothes on the bag of dried apples.' I did as I was bid- den, and came down in my 'Sunday suit, and walked" into mother's room. She ran her eyes over me, pulled up my breeches, pulled down my jacket, spread out my shirt collar, looked for dirt on my neck. and behind my ears, didn't find any, clasped my shoes a lit- tle tighter, combed my head, powdered it, and bade me take my seat in the dining room. All this was done; doubtless, that I might have it to say, in after, times, that I had seen General Greene, Colonel Washiinton, and Colonel .Williams; that they had supped and slept, and breakfasted, at my father's house; and (perchance,) that I had actually spoken to them, and been spoken to by them. It may be, too, that the good lady, finding jme getting a little boorish, was disposed to give me some knowledge of nice entertainments and genteel society. If my. improvement was her object-if she designed to inspire me with military order, she missed it. When the officers first took their seats at the table, I was deeply interested in their looks and conversation; but when I saw all the luxuries of the table going under their vora- cions appetites with a perfect rush, alarm eptirely suffocated admira- tion.

"The same breakfast set. was paraded again, near the sameimne, when Colonel Lee sulped with us, and never again until Jane's mar- riage. "And now, sister, raised as we have been, where did you get your refinement in love and maternal indulgence from?" "In your zeal to display all mother's crockery, you put one plate too many on the table, brother." "No, I didn't; Uncle John was expected to breakfast, and prevent- ed from coming by a shaking ague that very morning." Mrs. Mitten had her tears turned 'to- smiles, at least by the Cap- tain's account of "the old folks at home," and this was more than he hoped for, after reading William's letter. He begged his sister to give William no encouragement to hope for a removal front Waddel's, promised to write to him himself, and left her. CHAPTER XIII. Captain Thompson's design was to keep his nephew at Doctor Waddel's school long enough to wean him from his old associates, and his old habits, to put at least seventeen years upon his head be- fore he entered College, to prepare him so thoroughly for the soo- more class, that he might enter it with credit, and in the meantime to give him the strength and vigor of constitution; that would sus- tain him through any amount of mental labor that he might find it necessary to undergo in order to stand at the head of his classes in College. All this as as well planned as it could be. College is no place for a youth glin to. bad habits. It sometimes happens, that- religion finds such ad one there, and reforms him; but it much oftener happens, that h makes shipwreck of the religion of all his College companions who associate with hidt. Nor should a youth be sent to College until he has acquired some little stability of character and self-control; and seventeen is the earliest -age at which these can be hoped for, in youths generally. Well 'for them if even at that age they have the moral firmness needful to resist the tempta- tions to vice, which are found in all Colleges. One of the best se- curities against these temptations is a high reputation for talents and scholarship, acquired immediately on entering College. Students       .      .   MASTER WILLIAM   MTTEN.        105 will commonly struggle-harder to maintain, than to gain a high po- sition in their classes.  But to the success of Captain Thompson's plans, it was indispens- able that William Mitten should) become reconciled to this school; otherwise he would keep his mother in such a state of mental excite- ,ment, -that her health must soon give way under it, when no alter- native would be left him, but to save the life of the mother, by in- dulgeace of the Son. He flattered himself that time would reconcile William to the school, and the sooner, when he, saw all hope of leav- ing it cut off. He knew that the worst must soon be told, and he supposed that if he could carry his sister safely through the succes- sive developments of the first mouth or two, his ultimate designs would be accomplished. His policy was, therefore, to lighten the first shock of each unpleasant discovery, by diverting her mind from it, with something amusing, flattering, or harmlessly controversial. The critical reader will have learned his tactics from what has been recorded specially in the last Chapter. Having allayed tie mother's anxieties for a moment at least; he turned to the son, and addressed to him a letter, in which, with much good advice, he administered to him a stern rebuke for afflicting his mother with his complaints. "Are you," said he, " so inhuman, so brutish, as to try to win me over to your wishes, through -your mother's tortures? Are you not well enough'acquainted with her to know that she never forfeits her word-that she would sooner die, now, than reclaim you from me until your education is completed? Why, then, do you croak to her? Why do you not make your wants and discontents known to me? I am the only one that can appease them. "And you are grumblOg about your fare already.! Why, I car- ried cakes and sugar things enough with you to last you one week surely; and pray get unstuffed of them, before you begin to grumble about your next cramming. - If you had. seen your father and me when we-were of your age, gulping down ash-pone and cracklings, you would, for the honor' of the stock at least, keep your daintiness to yourself. 1 don't know what Newhy gives you to eat; but I have no doubt it would have been a feast to us in our day. What apology have you for grumbling'at your diet, when you have the privilege of boarding where you please? If you don't like Newhy's, go some- where. else. What better are you than the hundred and fifty boys around you? This much you may take for gettled: that I nXever will talce yotu away from Mr. Tarddes, jZcst to accommodate your belly. So quit your grunting about, what you are to eat; and if you must grunt, grunt to me, and not to your mother.  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7117-00000054"/> "And what does it signify to you, who or how ' oltd Waddel,' as  you call him, whips, so long as he does not whip you? 'Old  Wad- del!' That is a pretty way for such a chap as you are to speak of a man of Mr. Waddel's age and ranks now is it not? Pray, Master _Mitten, where did you learn your manners?  From 'uncle Twa,' or uncle Sot? In the parlor, or in the kitclien ? Now mark me, young man ! The next time you write that name in that way to your mother,'or me, I will cut it out and send it to Mr. Waddel, and ask him. whether he allows his pupils to speak of him after'thia manner. I lose all patience, when I think that at the very time- when you were speaking thus rudely of him, he was penning a let- ter filled with the most flattering' ompliments to you  " While the Captain was thus writing to his nephew, Mrs. Mitten was busily engaged devising means to raise her son above want and ridicule. She resolved that William never should " blossom," and that in this matter, at least, she would disappoint Mr. Brace. Ao-. cordingly she set to work with all dispatch to make him up two new suits; and that they might not attract attention from their fineness, she chose for them the coarsest material that her heart would consent to William's wearing. " Let my son," sighed she, "look like a ne- gro, rather than siffcr worse than one !"  She taxed her mind to find some decent substitute for a shirt, but failing here, she 'made him up three cotton shirts, of Mrs. Thurlow's spinning and weaving -that is to say-of the best quality of home manufacture.. To these she added three pairs of stockings of Mrs. Figg's knitting. All these, with three blankets, and two pairs of cotton sheets, were packed in one box; but as they .did notquite fill it, she slipped in- to it one tumbler of plum jelly, and onelf raspberry jam. These being nicely surrounded and covered with cotton, the box was closed.' Another was replenished with biscuit, crackers, cheese, tongue, sliped ham, sausages, &amp;c., &amp;c., to a large extent; and this too, like the other, was, closed rather carelessly. The' whole process was kept a profound secret from the Capkiin; and indeed, from everybody else, but Tom, upon whom secrecy was strictly enjoined. As there was no hope of meeting with a convenient opportunity of sending these cumbrous stores to William, by one going to Willington, Mrs. Mitten determined to forward them without delay per cart, in charge of her most intelligent and trusty servant. The reader immediately conjectures who this servant was. But a very ugly difficulty lay be- tween the plan and its execution. 'Tom did not know-the first mile of the way to Willington, and to get directions from the Captain,.   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          107 was just to blow the whole project sky high. Mrs. Mitten took the rounds of the stores, therefore, in quest of the desired information. But few of the merchants or citizens of whom she made inquiry, had ever heard of Willingtqn.; and,'when she told theem that Wil- lington was the place where Mr. Waddel kept his school, they looked at her as if doubting whether she was in her right mind; for every body knew that her son was at Mr. Waddel's school, and that her brother had carried him there. All were too polite, however, to ask explanations of her. Prom Mr. West, she got a little light. He told her that when her brother went off with William, he met them near Mr. Ellison's, on the Washington road. This was enough to start by, at least; and she knew that Mr. Smith's was the first stage; but she was well aware tlat it would never do to dispatch Tom upon this information alone. She was constrained, therefore, to resort to her brother at last. .She went over to his house early in the afternoon, and found that he bad gone to his farm. She awaited his return; and in the meantime made a confidant of Mrs. Thompson, and bespoke her assistance in extracting from her husband such directions, as would guide Tom surely and speedily to Willington. The Captain reached home just at supper time. His sister greeted him with a radiance of countenance and gaiety of man- ner, that really transported him. "Oh, my dear sis,'^ said he, "how happy I am to see you so cheerful-so much like your own. dear, sweet, former self! What good news have you heard?"  "None, brother. My cheerfulness is not altogether real; but I hope it soon will be so; and perhaps the best way to make it so, is to assume it when I can."'               , So went the conversation, as they went to the table. When seated,  Mrs'. Mitten actually began a playful conversation with' Mrs. Thomp- son, by enquiring whether she had heard lately of "David Ramsay, son of Dr. Raimsay, the Historian, &amp;c.; &amp;c., &amp;c." "No, said Mary, "it don't think he'll ever say 'Rams(n/' to me again, as long as he lives." The Captain roared-, and all laughed. "Well, Moll," said he, "if I could always see you and sis in such fine spirits, I believe I should be the happiest man living." "Well husband," said Mary, "we ouglt both of us always to be in fine spirits, for after all 'your teasing and wilfuiness, I don't think any wonmn ever had a better hiiisbaiid than I have, or a better brother than Anna has."  "I can say'amenl to that Nt all my heart," said Anna.  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7117-00000055"/> "Well; done, ladies!" cried the Captain, pretending to take it all as a joke, "what project have you now on foot' Where are the girls going? How many horses will they want, and for how long? How much money will it take to rig them out, and bear their expenses. It t can't be that either of the girls are going to get married: the oldest is a little too young for that." "Nothing of the kind, husband; nothing of the kind. It just-  came in the way, and I spoke out the honest sentiments of my heart." "And so did I, brother, I assure you." "Well, ladies, I can only say that I wish from the very bottom of my heart, that all this would 'just come in the way' every day. It would make me the happiest man in the United States, I'm sure." "Brother, have you answered William's letter?"         Y "Oh, yes, long ago," said the Captain, lqokin, as if he thoutht something was about to "come in the way" that was not quite so com-  fortable. "Husband, how far is it to -Mr. WNaddel's?" "About sixty miles-maybe a little under or over.'" "Which way do you go to get there, brother? '         Y "'I went the Barkesdale Ferry Road, because it is a little nearer - than the upper road by Lisbon, Petersburg, and Vienna. Look  here, good women, what do all these questions mean? Anna, you surely have no notion of -going to Mr. Waddel's, have you?"  "Oh, no, not the most distaXnt idea of it--at least till the weather becomes milder."  "You're not going to send for William to come home, surely!" "No, no my dear brother, no. Did you eve ; know me to violate  my word? And if I were disposed to do it, do you suppose that I c would do it stealthily?" -  "That would be quite out of character with you, sister, I confess.  But, there is something so strange in this catechising froml you and Mary, and it goes on with such quizzical looks between you, right upon the heel of a loving fit, that I am constrained to think thata there is something ih the wind that I am not to be suffered to under- f stand."         '    n "How do you know husband, but that we are paying you back in your Own coin? It is fine sport foryou to trifle with our curiosity." '-'I should expect such pay from 'you, but not from Anna."  "Well, sister M3ary, as we can't please himneither by being serious  or pleasant, suppose we go over to my house for the remainder of the evening."           :  . .- . Is   -UJSLT ER' W 4-ll1AAwL M'Lu"I'IT.    1UY "Oh, no, my dear wife, and my dear sister, don't go away and leave the while you are in such a pleasant mood. I have not had such a refreshing, for two years. Stay, and you may ask me as many ques- tions as you please, and I will answer them with pleasure." "Stay a moment, Anna, aud let's try him," said Mrs. Thompson. What is the given name of the smith whom you stayed with the first night?" "John." "How far does he live this side of Washington?"  "About three miles-perhaps a little less." "After you pass through Washigrton, what is the next town that you come to?" "No town. But there are two places that bear the names oftowns- r names which a traveller would take for the names of towns, though here are not six houses in both of them put together; the first is tehoboth, and the second is Goshen." "Well, you have said your lesion so well that we. will not examine you any more to-night. And now, sister Anna, he has been such a good boy that I think you ought to sit down and spend the evening with him." "I would with all my heart, sister, 'if I could, but business that must be attended to-night, calls me'home. Remember, I have  seen here nearly all the afternoon." "Well, if you must go, I'll go with you."  "What in the mischief can these women be' aPer-?" mused the captain as they left the house. "If Waddel was a wido r, and didn't whip so joyfully, I should think that Anna was going over to. May see to his heart." The Captain being fatigued, retired early to rest. As soon as the ladies entered the house, Tom was summoned. "Tom," said Mrs. Mitten, "I want you to take old Ball and the Batt,and carry those boxes to your mas' William. He is going to school to Mr. Waddel, in Willington, over in South Carolina-is Ball hod?"  "Yes, ina'am, new shod, day before yesterday." "I want you to start at the peep of day in th oringin. And now Listen well to what I'm going to tell you. You take the Washington road, the road by Mr. Ellison's, and keep it till you come to Mr. John 0 Smith's. -Ie lives only two or three miles this side of Washington.

"Rehoboth-Re-ho-both.; "I got him!" said Tom, with one ear up and the other down, his eyes looking on the ground six feet off, and listening, most vigor- ously.  "When youi get to Rehoboth, inquire for Goshen, and when you get to Goshen, enquire for Barkesdale's ferry; and when you get lto Barkesdale's ferry, enquire for Willington, or Mr. Waddel's either; and when you get to Willington, ask for Mr. INewhy's, where you will find William-I believe that's all right, 'sn't it, Mary?" "Exactly."  "Here is your pass, Tom, in which I have stated where you are going, and for what. If yon get out of the way, show that to any one you meet, and he will set you right. And here are ten dollars; take five to bear your expenses, and give the other five, with this let- ter, to William. No;v, do be particular, Tom, for if anything goes wrong, we shall never hear the last of it. I want you to get back before brother David finds out that you have ever been." "I'll go it, mis'ess, like a streak o' lightnin'." Mrs. Thompson returned home and slipped into bed without wak- ing her husband. The next morning he watched her very, closely, but could discover nothing unusual in her conduct or conversation.  After-breakfast, he re-visited his farm, and returned to dinner. Hav- ing dined, he sauntered down to the business part of the town, where he joirfed aGroup of gentlemen in front of Mr. West's store. They gave him a somewhat distant salutation, and eyed him with rather a solemn interest, saying nothing.           - "Why, gentlemen,"l said the Cai:tain, " what makes you all look so - serious?"  "Captain," said Mr. West, "have you heard from your nephew, William Mitten, lately?" "Not very," said the Captain, turning pale. "Has anything hap-  pened to him?" "Not that I know of, but his mother asked me the way to Mr. Waddel's yesterday, with some anxiety, and I didn't know but that something had happened."  She asked me, too," said a second. "And me, too," said a third.. "And me,' said a fourth. "Why," resumed the Captain, 'it is the strangest thing in the     world! i Nothing can be the matter with William, for his mother Was at my house last night, and I hardly ever saw her more cheerful than she was, all the time she stayed. And, what was unaccountable to me, then, and is more so now, she and my wife were pumping me all the time About the road to Waddel's." '"I thought it very strange," continued West, "that lae did hot go to you for information." "I w as not at home in the forenoon." ["Oh, well, that accounts for it." It was sheer good luck on Mrs. Mitten's side that none of the par- ty knew but that she had gone, to consult her brother in the first in- stance. While the whole company were standing amazed, Mr. Hough- ton came up, smiling- ["Captain," said he, "as I came into town this mornin, I met your sister's Tom about two miles this side of my houses in a cart, with two boxes in it, and about two feeds of fodder and corn. Why, Tom, said I, "where ire you :going?" "I'm gwiine," says he, "to Mr. Wodden's, who keeps school at Mr. Williston's, in Car'lina." "Well," said I, "Tom, you'll never get to Car'linL this way, till you pass'through Augusta." "Why, ain'tthis the W'ashington road, Mas' Josh?" said he. "'No, Tom', you left the Washington 'road three or four miles back." "Emp--e-e-eh 1" iss Tomn. "1My sign fail lnc this time. that's sar- tainr' -V '        . : !"What^sign, Tom?"

But, bless the Lor', the spit cheat me this time, that's sartain." A peal of laughter followed this narrative, loud enough tobe heard overhalf the village; but the Captain did not swell it much. He disguised his wrath, however, pretty well. "1 put him in the right road agai,"' continued' Br. Houghton, "and for fear the spit wouldn't fly right, I' advised him of all the forks between my road and the Washington road." "The mystery is explained," said the Captain. "Anna has Sent off a cart load of comforts to her son, which she did not wish me to know about; and now I'll have to go after Tom, for he'll never find the way to Waddel's during ash and oak."   &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7117-00000057"/> "2        MASTER WILLIAM MTEN. "What did he mean, Captain," inquired Houghton. "by Waddel's keeping school at, Mr. 1Williston's Y" "The place where Waddel's school is kept, is called WiliSygton and Tom has mistaken it for a man's namce. As the Captain's feelings were not in tune with those of the coml pany, and as every question made the discord more and more grating to his refined sensibilities, he"concluded to retire; so putting on an air of perfect indifference to the whole matter, and saying carelessl "I must see Anna," he withdrew very leisurely; but one who saw how his face reddened, and his pace quickened with every step towards his sisters after he turned the nearest corner, might with truth have exclaimed, "The ma-an's mad '" CHAPTER XIV. Captain Thomapson had ample cooling time before he reached hi sister's residence, for it was full two hundred yards from Mr. West's  store; "but contrary to the law in such case made and provided," in stead of cooling, he got hotter and hotter with every step of the way. Business at home demanded his attention just at this time-the weather was still cold, and might in a day or two turn much colder. When and where he should overtake Tom, and how he should dispos of him and his load when overtaken, were perplexing considerations. Then his sister's unconquerable indulgence of her son, with its proba- ble consequences, coming upon the raw places of his mind which it had already produced, was quite irritating. Nor was he entirely forget- ful of the fun of the village already enjoyed at his expense, and like- ly to be renewed on his return. All these things pressing upon a mind naturally excitable, were not calculated to lull it into repose. The reader therefore will not be surprised to learn thatthey so com- pletely absorbed the Captain's attention, that he became wholly for. getful of the claims of dignity, and "the poetry of motion,' and that he reached his sister's steps in a palpable trot. As soon as his sister saw him she showed signs of great alarm, for sbe observed that he was in a state of very unusual excitement. Her alarms had a good effect upon the Captain; they reduced his feelings instantly to a littleabove temperate. "What," said he, "was in those boxes you sent off by Tom, thi morning?" "One contained some clothing for William, and-- " "MSore finery, I suppose!" "No, not a stitch of finery." "What theni?" %             ,r   MASTER WILLIAM   XMITBN.        113 "Two suits of coarse negro cloth, (I may call' it) some cotton. homespun shirts, and a few home-kpit stockings."  This was refreshing to the Captain. "Well, I rejoice," continued ie, "that your love for your boy is beginning to show itself in the ight way at last. And what was in the other box?" "Some refreshments-- " "More cakes, raisins, almonds, sugar-pums, &amp;c., &amp;c., of course?" "No, not a single one of either." "What then?  She named the contents of the box. "Well, if he imust be crammed, better this than the first lot. Now. I've got to pack off after that fool negro, pressed as I am with busi- ness, just at this time; for he'll never find the way to Waddel's while the world stands " "Brother, I am sure you need not take upon yourself that trouble. Tom is a very intelligent negro-- " "Humph!" "- - And I have no doubt but that he will go straight to Mr. gaddel's without a blunder. I give him such particular directions that he can't miss the way--" '"Loz gave him directions! Why, there never was a woeman-- town woman-on the face of the. earth, who could find the way to house fifteen miles from her own, after going to it twenty times; and there never was one who could direct Solomon to a place ten miles off; so that he could find it; and here you've sent off a stupid jackass of a negro to go sixty miles under your directions, and to a place that you've never been to yourself!" "Well, if he doesn't find the way, it will be all your fault--"' "How the devil will it be my fault.?" "I got the directions from you, and I gave them to Tom just pre- isely as I received them from you, and Isister Mary will prove it." "I didn't pretend to go into the details, for I did not know what you and Mary were fishing for; and if I had given them, there is not a 'Tom in. the world that could have followed them.' "I think, brother/ you underrate the negro character, as you are too apt to do with all character, except that of the 'lords of creation.' I must think that there is a little sense in the world that does not belong to them. Perhaps, however, I am mistaken." "Well; what directions did you give Tom?"  She repeated them. "'An you think'Tom can't miss the way under these directions?"   &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7117-00000058"/> "4        MASTEBR WILLIAM  MTTEN. "I am sure he will not, for I have proved him to be uncommonly shrewd at finding roads."  "Well, he did not get ten miles from town before he got lost- took the Augusta rqad, and told Joshua Houghton that he was going to Mr. Wodden's who kept school at Mr. Williston's, in Carolina!" "Oh! Mr. Houghton must have misunderstood him. He couldn't have miscalled Mr. Waddel's name, for it has been repeated in his hearing over and over, and over again, Isn't Burke's Meetinghouse on the Washington road '" "Near it." "And isn't it more than ten miles off?" "Yes." "Well, he knows the way to Burke's Meeting-house, for he ha taken me there repeatedly." "Yes, and if you had told him to go by Burke's Meeting-house, he would have gone that far straight, at least." "I couldn't have told 'him that, for I didn't know that Burke'd Meeting-house road and the Washington road were the same my. self."    * "I suppose not. But it is not worth while to stand talking about it. I know that he will not find the way to Waddel's in a week, if ever, and I must go after him. Was old Ball shod or bare-foot when he set out?" "Newly shod." "Did you give him any money to bear his expenses?" "I gave Tom money." "Did you understand me to ask whether you gave old Ball money to pay his expenses?" The Captain, without waiting for an answer to his last question, went home with his 'foot down," and of course his wife was all meek- ness and obsequiousness. 'He did not speak to her at all, but called out in her presence to Dick, "to have his horse ready at the peep of day, for him to pack off after Anna's Tom." "Master, is Tom runaway?" "Ask your mistress there-she can tell you." 1"Miss'ess is Tom---- "Go about your business, you black rascal," said Mra. Thompson, in an undertone." "Kigh!" whispered Dick, "some 'en wrong here!" The Captain fell to writing letters furiously-jumped up and or- deredDick to grease the chaise-resumed his pen, and jumped up   ,MASTER WILLIAM  MTTEN.       115 again and feltiin his breeches' pockets-wrote sometime, and jumped 'up again and jerked open a drawer, looked in and shut it up again- folded up a letter and commenced another-jumnped up and ordered Delphy to get him some warm water to shave-wrote again-stopped, punched the fire, and told Suckey to fell Dick to bring in some wood,  "plenty of it, for I don't know that I shall go to bed to night." Wrote again-rose, went out and stayed a little while, and came in again. Folded another letter or note, and went to writing again. Finished another note, and called for the water to shave. Just here, Mrs. Thompson, ina very subdued tone, informed him that supper was ready. It consisted of tea, biscuit, butter, cheese, sliced ham, cold tongue, and a few cold sauages. The Captain took his seat, and looked at them as if they were all laughing at him, and then fell to work upon them, as if he were fighting them for their rudeness. "What clothes shall I put up for you, husband?" said Mrs. Thomp- son, tenderly. '!" reckon you'd best put up all I've got, for I expect to wear them all out before I find Tom, ald get him safely home again. It will be at the very least, four days before this can be accomplished. Uppon this hint the good lady stocked him for a week. After supper, the Captain shaved, went to the stable to see that old Roan was in travelling order, returned, handed the letters to his wife, and went to bed. The letters were all left open, from which the wife understood prefctly, that her duty concerning them was to be learned from their contents. And now having put the Captain quietly to bed, we beg leave to indulge in a few reflections upon his conduct towards his sister and wife. We can find it in our heart to palliate, if not wholly excuse his gusts of' temper before his lovely sister. The heat of his mind would not cool, even in cooling time. But how can we justify him, in a direct issue between them upon the capacity of the negro race generally, and of Tom, in particular, for ascribing his blunder whol- ly to stupidity, when he knew and mustC have remembered, that ne- gro stupidity had nothing to do with it! It was the result, as the reader has seen, of a symbolical delusion (if we may be allowed the expression) and not of mental imbecility. It was not in keeping with the Captain's usual candor to suppress this important fact. Nor can we find a single apology for the Captain's long protracted crustiness to his wife. He had relieved himself at his sister's of his redundant Stearm, there was nothing to raise it again on his way home, her playful " fishing" frolic was certainly no offence, and her  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7117-00000059"/> "6        MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. meekness in his presence should have reduced him instantly to ten-r derness 'and kindness. But so it is with these " lords of creation ;" they must not only be allowed to become furious, but they must be allowed to spend their wrath upon the dearest object they have on earth. Is it likely that women will continue to marry if such con- duct be persisted in? And what is to become of the world when they, cease to marry? Having made no allowance for the six or eight miles that he had lost on the Augusta road, Tcm concluded, at the end of seventeen miles from home that he must not be far distantfrom John Smith's; and that he might not pass his stopping place from ignorance of its location, he determined to keep hims lf well advised of his ap- proaches to it, from such travellers as he might meet. His mind was no sooner made up to seek light, than an opportunity was af- forded him in the person of one who entered his road but a few yards ahead of him.            : "M aster," said he to the stranger, " how far is it to Mr. Smith's?" "Which Smith?" "John Smith." "Parson John Smith?" "Well, I reckon he's a Parson, for Mis'ess is a mighty good Christian, and she told me I must be sure to stay at his house to- night, any how, day or night." "' That's the road to Parson Smith's." said the traveller, pointing to the road he had just left. "It's just three miles to his house." Tom took the road and went on his way rejoicing. He soon reached the Parson's, and without introduction, or question, to the good man, he commenced ungearing. Mr. Smith, noticing him from his window, walked out and asked him what he was doing. "Ain't this Parson Smith's?" enquired Tom. "Yes."-  "Mis'ess told me I must stay here any how, no matter whait time I got here."                    I "Who is your Mistress, my boy?"' "Mrs. Mitten-mighty good woman." ' I don't know her-I reckon there's some mistake-Have you any paper?" "Yes air," said Tom, handing his pass. The, Parson read it, and said, "'Tommy, my boy you've come out   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         117 of your way., I'm pot the John Smith you are seeking. He lives right on the road you left, just this side of Washington." "Emp-e e-e-eh! How far is it Master?" "Why, if you go bclk to the Washington road it is about four- teen miles, but if you'll take that road that turns around the horse lot, you will save near two miles." Tom took it, fell again into the Washington road and reached Smith's an hour or two in the night. The next morning the Captain and Tom had an even start; they bboth left their respective stations as soon as they could see to drive. As it'was next to impossible for Tom to miss his way after being set right by Houghton, until he passed little River, the Captain made no inquiries for him up to this point, but employed himself in a close look-out for the tracks of the cart wheels, and of old Ball. Every now and then he would espy traces of a two wheeled vehicle, drawn by a new-shod horse, which he felt pretty sure was the equip- age he was in pursuit of; but still he was far from certainty upon this head. He stopped at the first house he came to after he passed the river, and enquired whether a negro, driving a large bald-faced sorrel, in a blue cart, with two boxes in it, had. passed that way. Yes," said the man whom he accosted, "I met him yesterday at the forks of the road up here, axing for- Parson Smith's,'and I put him in the road to the Parson's."  "Parson Smith! who the devil made him a parson? A month or two ago, he was one of the profanest men I ever saw." "You don't know the man, sir Brother' Smith is one of the most religiouisist men in all this country." '"What! John Smith, just this side of Washington'?" "Oh no, not him! Parson Smith, who lives over here by Be- thesda Meeting House." Here the Captain, 'contrary to his habit, let fall a very bad word against Tom, and proceeded: "What could have put it into the head of that addled-brained goose to quit the plain beaten road and run off into by-ways to hunt up Parsons and Meeting-houses!" "Stranger, I don't know but that I am to blame for that. He axed for John Smith;' I axed him if he meant Parson John Smith; and he said he reckoned he was a Parson, for his Mistress was a mighty good woman, and told him he must stay all night- -' "Well, please direct me th, way'to Parson Smith's." "Stranger, I hope you won't think hard of me -" "Oh, no sno no I don't blame you the least in the world. Di-  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7117-00000060"/> "8       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. reet me the way to Parson Smith's if you please, for I am in a great hurry."  "I'm mighty sorry if I turned him out of the way; but he axed me c "I give you my word and honor I don't blame you at all-but I shall blame you if you don't tell me the way to Smith's as you did the negro." "Oh, yes, well I will with a great deal of pleasure. Go on till you pass a little old field to your left, and you'll come to a road wind- ing round thefuri edge of it; take that, and it will lead you straight to Parson Smith's." As the Captain turned off, the other continued: "Stop one minute stranger!" The Captain stopped.  "Have you ever thought, stranger, of the sin of profane swear- ing?" "Yes," said the Captain, cutting up old Roan. "I never do it. unless I amn very angry." The Captain had no difficulty in finding the road to Parson, Smith's, but he had great difficulty in solving a mystery which pre- qented itself to him as soon as he reached it. As the road was but little traveled, the tracks of the cart wheels and of old Bald re- mained entirely unobliterated. They proved to be the same that he' had caught glinpses of on the way, and supposed to be Tom's tra- cing; but while they showed plainly that he had gone to the'Par- son's, there was no sign that he had returned to the direct road from, the Parson's. This perplexed him seriouslyand made him wonder- whether Tom had not gone to a camp .meeting with the Parson, There was no alternative, so he determined to go to the Parson's even at the hazard of getting a more serious lecture from -him than he had already received from one of his flock. He soon reached the' house, and saw a lady standing in the door. He called to her to know "whether Parson John Smith lived there?"The lady looked at him intently, but gave him no answer. He repeated the question, but still'received no response. c Why what upon earth does the woman mean?" muttered he. "If there was a fatal disease on this earth called ' The Womuran,' I should die of it, to a dead certainty." At length the kind woman broke silence: ' Light and come in, and warm yourself." "No, I thank you, madam, I am not cold, and am in a great hur- ry. Did a negro man stop here with a cart and a blazeafaed horse, yesterday?"    MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         119 The lady made no answer, but advanced slowly towards him. Cm- ing near the chaise she said: "You'll have to speak a little loud to nme; I'm a little hard of hearing,. "Is this Parson Smita's?" asked the Captain in a pretty Icud tone.*  "Yes, sir." 4"Where is he?" "He's at the pig pen, sp-- 'tending to his pigs." "Did a negro man and a Maze-faced horse stop here yesterday?" "You'll bave to speak a little loud to me; I'm 'a little hard of hearing." The Captain repeated the question louder.  " think he did."'  "'Which way did he go?" "Sir?" "Which-way did-the-negro-boy-go?" bawled the Captain to tie top of his voice. "Well, I'm not so deaf as all that comes to-I think he we-it round the lot there." The Captain wheeled off, soon struck the trail, and "opened ;a it" loudly. At the true John Smith's, he learned the history of Tom for t'. preceding night. Smith'told him that he had given Tom such  directions as would carry him on his way tlrough Washington. 'The Captain pushed on through the village, struck the trail on t'e Petersburg road, followed it for two miles, and stopped for the night at Mr. Brown's. Brown told him that Tom had passed there early on. the preceding morning, and that this was all the information I e. could give of him; except that he seemed to be getting along veiyr well. A little after night-fall another gentleman stopped at Brown's,. whom the landlord greeted with all the cordiality of intimate firiean - ship, under the name of Col. White. "Here's a man," said Browi , "who can probably tell you something about your boy; he liv s right on the -road about five miles this side of Petersburg. ", boy," continued Brown to White, ( in a cart, with a balled sorreAl in it." "Oh yes,".said White, "he stopped at ,my house and enquired for 'the Hlbbot,' but I understood himl and put him in the rcid to Rehoboth." At Col. White's Tom was much nearer to Doctor Waddel's than he was to "  the Hobuot ;. but he had promised to go like a streak.. of lightning," and he was verifying his pledge.  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7117-00000061"/> 120       MASTIER WILLIA1M MTTEN. As his game had , doubled," the Captain determined to quit the trail and push directly for Rehoboth. By this movement he had gained greatly upon Tom; but not enough to overtake him that day. We will not detain the reader with further particulars of the chaise, suffice it to say that about two hours by sun on the third day, in a rugged by-way, about two hundred yards from the highway leading from Augusta to Barkesdale's Ferry, and about three miles from the ferry, he came, up with Tom under very interesting circumstances. On a washed hill side, Tom, as a classic reader is reported to have said, "in trying to avoid Skilly he bad rushed upon Caribogus "- or deaving the classics) in trying to avoid a deep gully on the one hand he had run over a log on the other; and though he did, not quite upset his cart, he tilted it far enough topour out both boxes in the gully. The top of one of the boxes'was'so far opened by the fall, that it discharged four biscuits and two crackers in the gully. The top- of the other burst entirely off, and the tumblers of pre- serves were broken, having delivered a part of their contents to the top of the box, part to the package, part to the road, and having re- tained a part. As the biscuit and crackers were too dirty to be re- placed, as the jelly and jam were irretrievably lost to William, and as Tom, from fatigue and long fasting, was very hungry, he rightly conceived that he could make no better use of them than to eat them. As well as he could with a biscuit, he cleaned the package, then the board, (which happened to rest bottom upward) then skim- med the top off what was on the ground, and topped off with what was left in the tumblers. As he did not observe the rule of propor- tion in eating, his biscuit and crackers gave out before he had dis- patched the last tumbler, and he was just wiping it out with his fore- finger, and sucking it, when the Captain came up with him. Lor gor' a'mighty, Mas David!" exclaimed Tonm, as the Cap- tain approached him, "I never was so glad to see'anybody in all my born days. These people 'bout here been'foolin' me all day long-" "How did you get here, you wooly-headed scoundrel?" "One man told me I'd save three miles by comin' this way." As the Captain got t:4'saying bad words again early in the inter- view, notwithstanding;-the lecture he had received, and as what farther passed between him and Tom was of little interest, we omit it. They were now but about six miles from Willington and the Captain, very reluctantly, concluded to pilot Tom himself for the remainder of the way. The idea of appearing at Willington, with a cart load of provisions for his nephew, was very annoying; but the thought -   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         121 of lugging them all the way home again, and disappointing his sis- ter, was still more annoying'; so he chose the least painful alterna- tive.  Things were righted, and the two set out for the ferty. The y reached it and found a wagon waiting the return of the fiat from the South Carolina side., His 'heart leaped at this good fortune, for he knew that the wagon could hardly cross without going through Wil- lington. He was not disappointed. The wagoner liyed but five miles from Willington, was going through it, and knew everybody who lived within six miles of it. The,(aptain took his name, placed the boxes and Mrs. Mitten's letter in his charge, offered to pay freight, but the wagoner wculd receive nothing, placed Tom's un- expended cash (seven' dollars) in his hands for William, dropped a line in pencil to Newhy explaining things, and set his face home- ward rejoicing. Nothing of interest occtirred on the way back. The Captain's good fortune prepared him for receiving Toni's account of his adventures which were wonderful indeed, and which Tom never got done recounting during his life. The moral of it, as drawn by himself, may perchance be of service to the reader: If I had 'forty thousand nigger s'qlai never sen' one so far from home by he'self 'less he know de road firs' chop." The Captain reached home early on the fifth day from his depart- ure. He gave the particulars of his trip to his wife and sister by snatches, as he happened to be in the humor, until they were all told. The fate of the jelly and jam was very provoking to Mrs. Mitten who was "sure if she had been there, she could have saved some of it'"The Captain was too busy to visit the public square for more than a week after his return; and his visits were very brief for more than a fortnight. But Tom became for a long while a dis- tinguished character on the square. . ,  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7117-00000062"/> CHAPTER XV. THE incidents of the last chapter were, upon the whole, fortunate. They cured Mrs. Mitten of sending delicacies to her son, cured Wi- liam of his complaints for many months, improved his style whe speaking of his Preceptor, brought him out in suitable apparel for" his place and associates, and sprung all the energies of?is mother to reconcile herself to his lob. When so much is said, the reader need not be told that Captain Thoirpson was also a great gainer by them. Things now went on more smoothly than they had for years. Wil- liam soon stood a head and shoulders above any member of his class. The Georgians began to brag on him, the Carolinians to emulate him. He began to mingle in the active sports of his fellows, to be cheerful, if not forward,in sharing his part int providing fuel and making fires. His new clothes, to be sure, did not quite reach him before he "blos- somed," for he kept the changes of his first supply as long out of sight as possible; but he was far from being in full bloom when "the fruits of home industry reached him. Immediately upon their arri- val, he appeared in the handy work of Mixi Thurlow and Mrs. Figgs, and Brace's lips were closed to all further' sarcasm upon his dress. In short, he followed his uncle's advice as well as he could, and forthwith began to experience the practical benefits of it. His new clothes "scratched him mightily at first, but he had got use to them," as he wrote to his mother; but he thanked her for them. The change in his dress was not much more remarkable than the change in his physical constitution. From a weakly, puny, cowering, retirin -say-nothing boy, he be- came a muscular, active, sprightly, vigorous yoth, who was nearly a match for any of his age, in running, jumping, wrestling, and the active sports of the school; and for loud clamoring at bull-pen, and town-ball, he had no superior. There was but one South Carolinian in the school who could throw him down, and that one was Andrew Govan; there was not one in the school who could match him in running. From fifty lips the exclamation would. come: "Did you ever see a fellow come out of the kinks as Bill Mitten has?" By the time it came to his turn to make fires in the Academy, (one of the duties of every student,) he was as prompt and skillful in this work as most of his associates. Sweeping out the Academy (anoth- er duty) of course was easy. Beyond all this, there was nothing re- markable in his history until the annual examination and exhibition   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         123 camp on., These exercises continued for several days, and they were attended by. multitudes-more, by many, than usually attend our College Commencements in these days. The order was as follows: First, the, examination of all the classes; which was iivariably con- ducted by the visitors, except when they declined the task, and this rarely occurred. Then speaking, for which prizes were awarded. And lastly, the performance of one or two dramatic pieces, us*ally d comedy and farce: but these were discontinued after the first and only'public exhibition in which William Mitten took part, and the reading of compositions was substituted for them. The speakers were divided into three classes, according to their age and advance- ment; the first class being composed generally of the oldest students in the school; the. second, of those next in years; and the third, of the youngest, excluding those in the elementary studies. .This ar- rangement was not always observed, however. Sometimes the larger and less advanced were put in the first class, and the smaller and more advanced, in the second class. William's age flung him in the low- est, though his advancement would have entitled him to a place in the second. The examination approached, and William wrote press- ingly to his mother and uncle to attend.. They did so, and reached Newhy's the day before the exercises'commenced. William recog- nized them at the fence, and ran out to meet them. Neither of them knew him, till, he greeted th'em, any more than if they had never seen him. His fine face was there, a little tanned, but that was all of William .Mitten that was left. He had grown like a weed, and developed as we have said. The Captain looked at him in triumph- the mother in. tears. Mr. Newhy was soon at the chaise and introduced to Mrs.- M. Five or six ladies were standing at his door, observing the new comers.. "I fear, Mr. Newhy," said Captain Thompson, "that you will not be able to accommodate us."' (Oh, very easy, if you can rough it a little fa .a few days." "Why, where will you put us? Your house seems full already." "Oh, we've plenty of houses, as you see." i' But those are the students' houses; what are you going to do with them?"  Oh, we cotton them upon such occasions as this, if necessary." ". Cotton them?" Yes; put 'em all in one hole and rai them tight together. How- ever, I don't think that will be necessary. We've two large rooms in the house, in one of which we will put the ladies, and in the oth- ,er the gentlemen."  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7117-00000063"/> 124       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.  "Well, that will answer very well," said the .Captain. "Do you take charge of Mrs. Mitten, and William and Tom and I will attend to the horses and baggage." "Why, this is a new horse, Tom," said William, as he srung to unsaddle a. horse which Toi. had led up. "Whose is he?" "He's Mas' David's. ' He say if you do well while he's up here, he gwine to give hifn to you. He's a tip top bos." "Well, I've got him safe," said, Bill. "What's his rnfme?" He name Snap Dlraggum."  (Snap Dragon.) "aHere, Tom," said the Captain, "take this trunk in the house----- "I'll take it," uncle, said William. "You can't carry it, my son; it's pretty heavy." Let me try it," said Bill; so saying, he, flung it on his shoulder, and marched off with it, with perfect ease. "Look ya a-nder!" exclaimed Tom, as he moved off. "Bless de Lor', Mas' William done got a man. 'ready." The Captain saw him near the door with his burden without a tot- ter, then turned, wiped his eyes twice, and was just blowing his nose the third time, when William leaped the fence, to assist Tom in lead- ing the horses to the horse lot. "Why, Bill," said the Captain, "I never saw a boy improve as you have in all' my life." The ladies gathered at Mr. Newhy's were all of the first respectabili- ,ty. They soon made Mrs. Mitten easy, and before they. parted, seve- ral of them and Mrs. Mitten promised to interchange visits most. certainly "if ever they came our way." (They never came our way.) The night shut in and the woods were vocal in all directions with rehearsals of speeches and parts of plays. A very comfortable sup- per was provided for the guests, (increased by several, after the Cap- tain's arrival the mattresses were spread, all laid down, the gentle- men talked till twelve, the ladies till two, and all was hush-save here and there "the bubbling cry of some strong" snorer "in his ag- ony." They were all, of necessity, up betimes the next morning, when they declared generMly that they had "had a -most delightful night's rest." Thus passed a wonderful night for Mrs. Mitten. The next morning exhibited a complete metamorphosis of the stu- dents. It was easy now to distinguish the sons of the Patricians from those of the Plebs, though turkey-red and indigo-blue predomi- nated largely over nankeen and gingham still. From seven o'clock till nine, people of all ranks, ages, sexes and sizes, might be seen wending their way to the school house, or rather   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.      '    125 to the area in front of it-for the examination was conducted under! the 'stately oaks of the campus. Some of the first men of the two States were there. At nine the examination commenced. The stu- dents, with very few exceptions, acquitted, themselves admirably. In all the studies of his class, William distinguished himself. On this day an incident occurred which was absolutely luxurious to all who dis- liked Brac'e. The reader, need hardly be told that however bright in wit, or ingenious in teazing Brace might be, he was not very bright in his studies. He was in one of the Virgil classes, and he had caught from a student, given to spouting poetry aloud, whenever he had any in store to spout, the four first lines of Dryden's translation of the second book of. the 2Enead. Doctor John Casey was conducting the examination, flanked on his right and left with an imposing row of dignitaries. "Begin," said the Doctor to Ned, who was at one ex- treme of the class in more senses than one, "at the second book of the Enead, and read the Latin first." Ned did so to the extent of six or eight lines. "Now translate."  Ned proceeded:  ' All were attentive to the God-like man,  When from his lofty couch he thus began." A roar of laughter burst from every one-loudest from the boys; for two reasons, first;, because they gloried in Brace's mortification; and second, because they wished the company to understand from this token that they were thoroughly versed in the poetry of all lan- guages under the sun. "Give us the translation in prose, if you please," said the Doctor. Ned continued: "Great Queen, what you command me to relate, Renews the sad remembrance of our fate.'" The laugh was repeated, but the Doctor had no occasion to repeat his request; for Ned had exhausted his stock of poetry. His debut was doubly unfortunate.; for besides exposing him to ridicule, it left :him wholly in the dark as to how much of the Latin his version had covered. So he began his literal translation two lines back of what he had already rendered; arid Dryden iould have been amazed to discover how he had butchered the Mantuan Bard, according to  Brace's translation.  This day and the next were consumed in like manner. On the  third day the speaking commenced.  A stage of rough plank was erected adjoining the school-house.  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7117-00000064"/> On this sat the Judges, of whom William H. Crawford, John C.. Cal- houn, and William W. Bibb were three. These hardly ever failed to attend the public exercises of Dr. Waddel's school. The two first had been his pupils, and the reader will excuse the digression, to learn that the first wife of the Doctor was the sister of the second. In front of the stage, large ologs were laid parallel to each other on which planks were placed at convenient distances apart, for seats. The whole was covered' over with a bush-arbor. It was but a scant  provision for the thrdng that attended upon this occasion; but what provision could accommodate all, when the number fell little, if any, short of two thousand people? The ladies, several hundreds in num- ber, occupied all the seats. Without going through the details of the exercises, suffice it to say that Mitten took the premium in his class by the award of the judges, approved of by every man, woman and studoet present at the exhibition. He had a part in both the dramatic pieces; and here he acquitted himself; if possible, with more credit than in declama- tion. When Mr. Calhoun, with a few complinlentary words, pre- sented him the prize, the whole assembly applauded loudly and cor- dially. One pretty little girl, beautifully-dressed, quite forgot her- self, and kcpoon clapping after everybody else had done, till her mother, laughing most heartily, stopped her. " itn Mitten, Mitten Mitten!" was on every lip. All the ladies, old and young, wanted to kiss him; all the little girls fell in love with him. A thousand compliments saluted the ear of iMrs. Mitten from lips that she knew not. Through Captain Thompson, she had been made acquainted with Doctor Waddel, before the exercises commenced, and through him, with most of the gentlemen who sat as judges, and her ac- quaintance was still farther extended by the sojourners at Mr. New- by's; but now everybody sought an introduction to her, and every- body congratulated her upon the performance of her son. Most of the judges waited upon her, and all of them had some- thing flattering to say of William, or to him in her presence, for he was always ather side. "Master Mitten," said Mr. Crawford, "I am proud to claim you as a Georgian. Cultivate your brilliant talents as a duty and an honor to the State that gave you birth." "Master Mitten," said Mr. Calhoun, ' the United States have an interest in you; and should I live to see you in the prime of life,' I shall be sorely disappointed if I o not see you the admiration of them all."'   ALaoj1 VY1 T1 L.-ijIiAi1 I'I'L&amp;LN. M I TT  As for Captain Thompson, he was in danger of going off by ex- plosion. He had been filling up with joy, from the first sight of Bill, to the close of the exhibition; and now' to find him so far sur- passing his most sanguine expectations in everything, to see him standing at the head of his classes iii scholarship, and declamation', and ahead of the whole school in dramatic talent, to hear him ap- plauded by all, and specially by Messrs. Crawford and Calhoun, and, (though last not least,) to see his sister almost in transports, was really perilous to the good Captain. He had tried to quench the volcano that was in him with rain; that is to say, he had cried six times, twice secretly, and four times publicly; but this gave him only momentary relief. Besides, the fire kept kindling all the time, and he could not keep crying all the time. Whithersoever he cast his eyes he saw so!nething to inflame his ecstacy, and I rhat would have been the consequence it were hard to tell, had not David Ram- say sauntered near him just at the critical moment--"Why, David, my young pilot, how do you do?" said the Captain. "Conic here, my son, and let me introduce you to Mrs. Mitten, my sister, mother of William. Anna, this is David Ramnsay, of whom you heard me speak!" "How do you do, Master Ramsay?" said Mrs. Mitten, smiling almost to a laugh. "I am very familiar with your name, for my brother could talk of no one else for-some time after his return from his first visit to this place." "'I remember Captain Thompson very well; but I cannot call to mind anything that I said or did to make him remember me." Here the Captain was a little at fault, but he soon ralfied, and re- plied : "It was your prompt courtesy to us as strangers, David, the coin- cidence of our names, but most of all, your connections who are known to all, that impressed you so permanently upon my memory. I no sooner asked if Mr. Waddel was at home than you answered in the affirmative, sprang to the door, invited me in, and brought Mr. Waddel out to see me. -This was but common politeness, to be sure, but I did not see any of your playmates offer to do the same thing. But for your kindness I might have had to knock long at the door, and sit long in the cold parlor, before Mr. Waddel would have come to my. relief." This interview was an admirable safcty-valve to the Captain. It set his thoughts to running back to titmes and incidents, well calcu- lated to relieve him from over-pressure of joy. The conversation with young aamsay was but just ended, when ,    5        .     ,    &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7117-00000065"/> 128      '  ASTER WILLIAM MTTElN. Doctor Hay stepped up and greeted the Captain and his sister with a fervor which showed plainly that time had not abated his friendship for them in the least. The greeting was returned with equal warmth. The Doctor expressed his regret that he had been detained by professional business at home until the last day of the exhibition; but added, that he had been amply compensated for his trouble in coming, by the rich entertainment he had just enjoyed-"An en- tertainment, Mrs. Mitten," continued he, "to which your son was the largest contributor. I deem myself fortunate in having my son in the close connection of class-mate and rooni-mate with him." Mrs. Mitten returned the compliment, by repeating what she said upon hearing that her son had fallen into the same room and class with the Doctor's son, only changing the terms of the complimlent so: far as to accommodate it to the Doctor's ear.. "And now," continued Dr. Hay, ".you must tarry with me to- morrow night on your way home. Let us g) over to Petersburg this afternoon, stay there to-night,. take an early start in the morning, and (barring accidents) we will reach my house by dinner time or a little after. There crest until the next morning, when, if I can't prevail on you to stay longer, I will give you an early breakfast, and set you on your way in time to get home, without traveling much in the heat of the day." The invitation was cordially accepted, and'as soon as one of Wil- liam's small trunks could be packed with selections from his wardrobe for the summer vacation, and Mrs. Mitten could renew ier invitations and promises to the few ladies who had not left, and return her thanksgiving to Mr. and Mrs. Newhy for their kindness to her son, and their hospitality to herself, and kiss Miss Thompson because she bore' the family name and both knew they must be related, though neither could tell how, and give each of the house-servants a quarter of a dollar apiece for being willing to do for her all that-Tom did, and a dollar to the wash-woman for extra services, and a half dollar (sent) to the ostler for fear that he might be disappointed and her brother forget him-Mrs. Mitten was ready to depart. While all this was transacting, the chaise was at the fence, Doctor Hay was sitting in his sulky, Gilbert was mounted on his father's horse, Silverheels, William on. Snap-dragon, and Captain Thomipson; at the door getting comfortable fast. The Captain escorted his sister to the chaise, she took her seat, the Captain took his, and off went the happiest company that Ever moved from Willington. Nothing of interest occurred on .the way   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         129 to Petersburg; for Mrs. Mitten, having to send back for her veil just as she reached Dr. Waddel's, was not even attended; with inconve- nience, as she declared that she could not think of passing by Mr. Waddel's door without, lighting and bidding him good-bye, and thanking him for his kindness to her son. These little duties con- sumed exactly the time needful for recovering the veil. It gave the Captain, too, an opportunity of charging William' and Tom to notice well the road, so that either of them might ind it without difficulty on their return. Doctor Hay's servant, Quash, went back for the missing article, and strange to say, found it readily. The dusk of the evening foundthe company at Mrs. Ragland's, in Petersburg. The reader will naturally enquire where the immense throng which attended Dr. Waddel's exhibitions found accommodation. We an.- swer, at all the houses within six or seven-miles of Willington, and? at the four villages of Lisbon, Petersburg, Vienna, and Richmond. The three first were tolerably thrifty little villages at the time of which we are speaking. Petersburg was quite an active, busy, commercial little town. It was situated in the fork of the Sayannah and Broad Rivers, and contained some eight or ten stores, with the usual supplement of grog-shops, and the very unusual supplement of a billiard-table. Notwithstanding these last, the citizens of the place were generally remarkable for their refinement, respectability, intel- ligence and hospitality. The dwelling houses far outnumbered the stores and shops. It was separated from Lisbon by Broad River, and from Vienna by the Savannah. Lisbon we believe could never boast of more than two stores and a groggery, and as niany dwellings. Vienna surpassed Lisbon in everything, but exactly how far, and in what we are not able to say, except in John Glover's house andstore, which had no match in Lisbon. The road leading to Willington from Vienna ascended a hill, about a mile from the latter place, which was crowned with Richmond. This town was very compactly built. It consisted of one dwelling house, one doctor's shop, one kitchen, one stable, one corn-crib, and one smoke house. Its white population consisted of Doctor Thomas Casey, his wife, one or two children, and Warler (or Walter) Beckly, a student of medicine. Neither of the four towns surpassed this in hospitality. Doctor Casey's house was open to all, and his heart was as open as his house-so was his wife's. It was a great resort of the beaux and belles of the neighboring villagesa here they were always made wel- come and happy. In these villages, the remotest of which was not over seven miles from Willington, was ample entertainment for all  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7117-00000066"/> 130       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. who attended the Exhibition, and could not prochre it elsewhere. Captain Thompson and Mrs. Mitten spent a happy night at Doctor Hay's, and were at home the next day by five in the afternoon. As they stopped at Mrs. I.'s door, the Captain inquired of William how 'he liked Snap-dragon. "Oh! I am delighted with him, Uncle. I think he's the finest horse I ever saw." "Well, he's yours, my son.- So you see if your Uncle scolds when you do ill, he rewards handsomely when you do well." "Oh! thank you, thank you, Uncle, a thousand times.. You never will find me doing ill agait, I promise you. I am so glad that you sent me to Mr. Waddel's I'am so glad that you would not allow me to leave there when I wanted to--you have been, you are a father to me, and the very best of fath-- " ' Well, that'll do, my son-you paid me for him before I gave him to you. Remember your pledges, as often as you ride him!" Alas! Captain, where was your usual forecast when you made this present? CHAPTER XVI. TuE cup of Mrs. Mitten's happiness was not yet fill. In less than a month after Captain Thompson's return from Willington' he embraced religion and joined the Methodist Church; and in the course of a week his wife followed his example. The story which he told at the first Love Feast which he attended after his conver- sion, is worthy of being recorded: "b I have had," said he "' for many years before me, a most beauti- ful example of the Christian character in iny dear sister. I never could see but one fault in her, and that was ' a fault which leaned to virtue's side :' too much indulgence of her son. She embraced religion early in life; and often when I have seenb her at her. devo- tions, my conscience has smitten me sorely. But I always managed to silence its reproofs, for a time at least. Oh, how eloquent is the godly life of a sister! Whether because she was my sister, that the inward monitor would not forsake me, although repelled a thousand times; or because I have had for many years a secret leaning towards religion, which prolonged his visits, or somne unknown cause, I can- not tell; but a month never rolled over our heads, that I did not observe in her the gleaming or broad out-shining of some heavenly virtue, which came like lightning to my soul." /   M'ASrER WILLIAM MTTEN.         131 As some of you know, about a month ago my sister dispatched a servant with some comforts for her boy at school in South Carolina. Knowing that I would bitterly oppose the measure, she, kept it se- cret from me. I found it out, however, and posted off after the servant in a great rage. The bluhders of the negro incteased my rage. I stopped at a house to. enquire for him. A plain illiterate man came out and, informed me that he had left the plain large road and gone offon a by-way. In my wrath I cursed outright, and on the trip, I repeated the sin oftener, I believe, than I had in the whole course of m. life before. As I turned to leave the good hearted man, ' Strapger,' said he to me, have you ever reflected ,upon the sin of profane swearing?' I was in no frame of mind ior reflecting upon any thing, and in the worst possible,- for receiving religious lectures; but a flash of respect for the good man came over me, which kept me from insulting him, and I replied, that I was not in the habit of profane swearing." "1My pursuit ended and object gained, I now set my face home- ward, and on the way had nothing to do but to reflect. My' mind' had hardly resumed its accustomed tone, when the question of my road-side friend, in the rude accents in which he put it (for I have not given it in his own terms) forced itself upon my memory. As- sociated as-it was, with the ignorance, the artlessness and innocence of the propounder, I smiled, and endeavored to divert my thoughts; but the question would control thelm, so I let it have its way: ' Have you ever reflected upon the sin 'of. profane swearing ' No, honest, untutored-ye0man, I never have! What a sin it is! Every others sin ls something to plead in its behalf. The gamester, the cheat, the swindler, the thief, the robber, the pirate, sin in the hope of gain. The assassin for the gratification of revenge-the drunkard to appease a raging thirst-the prodigal, for many gratifications. But thou, oh, profane swearer! what have you to plead in the ex- tenuation of thy offence? )It is purely gratuitous. In one single, short imprecation, you embody sins enough to damn a world. You insult the Almighty, you trifle with his Holy Name, -you violate the law of reverence, the law gt love, the law of humanity, the law of peace! You sst God's power at defiance and invoke God's power to crash your neighlbor and your brother! And all, for ivhat What momentary gain do you derive or promise yourself from your sin of sins? Often, most commonly, you have not even the flimsey i plea of passion to gloss over your crime. You mingle it in your sports, your revels, your banquets, and. horrify it with a laugh!" ' O        &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7117-00000067"/> 132       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. "You will not wonder, brethren, that I became alarmed, and re. solved never to swear another oath while I lived. This was as far as I weent at the time; but it was not as far as Ifelt, by a long, long way.  Thenceforward my sins were more constantly and vividly before me, than ever, until I sought the pardon of them, in God's own way, and as I believe found it-I am strongly tempted to, say, I know I found it.' " In religion, the captain was'as he had been in every thing else that he undertook: open, active, liberal, ardent, zealous, laborious, untiripg. What some Christians call a cross, such as holding family prayer, particularly before strangers of rank, praying in public, and speaking in public on proper occasions, was to him no cross at all; and we advise those Christians who cannot perform these offices, (and there are such) not to dignify them with the name of crosses. Captain Thompson and his wife led off a great revival in the vil- lage, upon which Mrs. Glib took occasion to deliver her theology very freely. "Well, well, well!" said she to Mrs. Lark, this is what you call getting religion, is it? Sinning all your life,'.and then kneeling down there two or three days and then jumping up a Christian!" "But, Mrs. Glib," said Mrs. Lark, "you don't remember what they say. They say that under Peter's preaching three thousand were converted and joined the church in one day." "Well, is old Howell, Peter, or is old Sherman, Paul?" "No, but they say that they preach the same gospel that Peter and Paul did-   " "Oh yes, they say, they say, and they'll say anything to get up an excitement, and to scare people. Now I love religiont-real, genuine religion-that kind of religion which a person goes to work' calmly, soberly, and deliberately to get. When I get religion, this is the sort I mean to get; but this wild-fire sort of religion I don't believe in at all." "But they say you don't get it when and as you want it." ' They do! I should like to know how they know what I can do, and what I can't. Now, mind what I tell you, nine out of ten of these flashy converts will back-slide before the year's out-you mark it! You remember we had just such a fuss as this five years ago, and old Groat and John Dunn and Sally Nix, and Polly Pines all got religion and were mighty!tppy; and where are they now?" i' But Mrs. Glib, you must 4o them the justice to say that a great many more of thelm than that, held on to their religion."   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         133 e "Yes, such holding on as it was. Holding on like Sam Strap; 'who is mighty sanctified all day Sunday, and slandering people's children all the week-saying that'genteel people's children are, lit- tle better than a den of thieves. That's what you call holding on, is it?. That's what you eftl} religion, init? And there's old Turner prosecuting little 'boys for a little harmless sport-and he a preacher at that! Don't tell wie anything about any such religion js that 3 You'd' 1l yourself laughing if you .could see my Flora Claudia La- 'vinia take them off. Now you know Mrs. Lark, that' I don't allow my children to make game of religious people of any sort. But some nights when we come home from these night meetings, she begins before I have time to stop her, and when she begins I get in such a laughing fit, I can't stop her. She takes off old Howell to perfec- tion-his very voice, action, and words-then old brother' MeBoon's praying-the very twang. And old 'sister' McRea, creeping about among the mourners. And 'brother' Wilson's singing! It seems to me sometimes she will kill me. I always reprove her for it. I said to her last night, Flora, you naughty girl, you really must quit this, it you don't I shall get right angry with you-they mean well, poor things, and you must not make fun of them." Nine weeks after this conversation, Mrs. Glib was brought to death's door with the bilious fever; the first man that she sent for to pray for her was Captainl Thompson; the second was "brother" McBoon. The first woman she asked to pray for her was Mtrs. Mit- ten, and the second was "siester" 'McRea-charging every one of them, while they prayed for her, to pray for her children, also, and for Flora in particular. She professed conversion in two days from the date of the first prayer. that was put up in her behalf, and died. Flora never professed conversion. She married, in three weeks after her mother's detth, a worthless, silly fellow, named Curt, who ad- ministcred upon Mrs. Glib's estate because no, one else would, took the guardianship of the boys, because no one else would; hired a man -of some property and no principle, named Carp, to gy upon his bois, sold out all the property of the estate, except the negroes, as soon as he could, and moved off with his security, and the whole tribe, white and black, to the frontier of Alabama; to the great re- lief and greater delight of every body. Nine years afterwards, the younger Glib (Ben.) camle back-to the village to learn something about the estate. To the amazement of all who knew the family, he was a decent, pious, but ignorant man. IE's story was that Curt and Carp settled near each other in Alabama. That in a very few years j  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7117-00000068"/> after they got out there, Carp had got from Curt every neegro that belonged to the estate, and then moved still fartker West. That the elder Glib got into a difficulty with a gambler, who shot him. Of his sister, he could be got to saX no more than that he did not know where she was. That his other brother was'thrown from a horse in a quarter race and killed. That he himself, seeing nothing but ,pov- crty and ruin and disgrace all around him, had sought and obtained religion. * That as soon as he did so, a good Btptist man of consider- able wealth took him by the hand, gave him employment on his farm, telling him that if he would do well, he would give 'him godd wages till he came of age, and then give him a little start in the world. That his friend had been as good as his word, and that he had now enough to live on comfortably, though he was not rich. The records showed of what the estate consisted. He took copies, went to the old family mansion, sauntered round it for a time, wept, and left the village forever. Having gone thus far with the Glib. family, we had as well dispose of it finally-it is replete with moral lessons.' Carp had played his cards adroitly to avoid responsibility. He knew the character of the boys, and judged that none of them would live long enough to call him to account. He knew, too, it would be an easy matter to. wheedle Curt out of all that he was worth individually or representa- tively, and conjectured that as soon as poverty began to stare her in the face, Mrs. Curt would be setting lawyers upon his trail. He therefore, from the day that they left Georgia, became exceedingly kind and exceedingly attentive to her ladyship. He would often speak to her playfully of her husband's inefficiency and bad manage- ment-declare that but for her, nothing could have induced him to become his security; "but I saw," said he," every body hanging off, nobody seemed to care anything for you or your poororphan brothers; and I said to myself, well, as for the boys, they will soon be big enough to shirk for themselves-they can rough it; but what is to become of Mrs. Curt? I can't see her suffer, and I'll be her friend if it costs me every dollar I have in the world." He used a thousand seductive arts to entoil, and he succeeded. He loaned money liberally to' Curt,often advising him in the pre- sence of his wife not to take it. "Mr. Curt," he would say, " two per cent. a month will ruin you. I can get that from other people, and, therefore, I don't like to loan for less, and I wil not lend it to you unless Mrs. Curt says so." "How much," said Mrs. Curt, " is two per cent.?" "Two dollars on every hundred dollars," said Carp.   M ASTER WILLIAM  ' MTTEN.       135 "Two dollars on every hulndred dollas! why that is very little? indeed! Pd borrow all the money in Alabama at that price, if I could get it." "Yes, Mrs. Curt, but you will not like to see your negroes under mortgage to secure the debt." ' JAortgage! What's that?" "Its a pledge of a negro to secure the debt." "qOh, that's nothing-surely Mr. Cftrt can pay the little sums that he borrows with only two per cent. on them." The "little sums" ran up so fast'that in a few years every negro that Curt had in his hands was under inortgage. Not all for money loaned, but for corn, fodder, pork, bacon, and other things sold; and forlarge balances in horse-swaps, carpenters' bills paid, and large outlays for Curt, in erecting a mill; for Mr. Curt having a fine mill seat on his land, said it would never do to let such a fine water-power be lost; so he commenced building a large mill when, as yet, there was nobody in the neighborhood to patronize it, and when his brain was about as well suited to manage a mill, as a claw-hammer is to maul rails with. About the time that the last mortgage ripened to maturity, Mr. Carp concluded to go "and take a view,4he said, of the Loulisiana country." He went, and came'back so delighted with it, that he must needs move there forthwith. But he could not go until he col- lected his Alabatma debts. Curt and he came to a settlement, when it was found that Curt owed him more by three hundred dollars than the negroes were worth by Curt's own valuation; he agreed, howev- er, as Curt was a particular friend, to take the negroes at Curt's esti- mate, and give him a receipt'in full. Curt felt very grateful for the kindness, and promptly signed a bill of sale of the n'egroes, drawn up by Carp himself, in which he took every precaution to guard against "after claps" as he called them, and which, in aftertimes gave a west- ern lawyer very great annoyance. Here it is: Whereas, on settlement this day made' between myself and John Carp, it appears that I am in his debt -for monies advanced to me on my own account, and also as administrator of Mrs. Brigita Glib, and also as guardian of the children of said Mrs. Glib, to the amount, of ten thousand dollars; and whereas, I did execute a mortgage to said John of the within fourteen negroes to secure the said debt, said ne. groes not being worth by three hundred dollars as much as ftid dAt, at my own valuation, which mortgage is given up on my signing this -bill of sale, and whereas said John did become my security as admin-  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7117-00000069"/> 1DD       -M A&amp;TXAbt5 YW1.lA-51 Al'lSt'; A "istrator, and guardian aforesaid, and I being willing to make him safe from any loss or losses for becoming my security as aforesaid, do  make this-bill of sale for that purpose also, for all these consideras-  tions I do sell and convey to the said .John the following negroes namely :" (naming them, their sizes, sexes, and ages.)  d "And I warrant them to said John against all claim by me or any body claim  ing the same as heir of Mrs. Glib or any other person whatsoever  ] &amp;c., &amp;c."                             l This remarkable bill of sale Mr. Carp required should be signed . by Mrs. Curt as well as her husband, and that Curt should sign it  "for himself and as administrator and guardian." Curt expressed  1 his readiness to comply with all these requisitions but the first. As  to this he said, "he doubted whether his wife could be induced tq  ] sign it." ' "Well," said Carp, " ask her, and if she refuses, all well,  it will make no difference."  Curt went to her with downcast looks and told her all the circum-  stances. To his astonishment she expressed her perfect readiness to t sign it. "Sign it," said she, ' yes, that I will. Mr. Carp has been. r so kind to us, that I can refuse him nothing.' The bill of sale was executed to Mr. Carp's wishes. "And now, friend Curt," said Carp,  'what are you going to do with no help here? You'd better bundle X up and go with me to Louisiana. I'll befriend you to my last dol- lar." "What am I to do with my mill and my little household plunder I and farm?"                            t] ' Trge," said Carp, pondering -. you can't well leave them-oh, I'll tell you how to manage it. Advertise them for sale two months ti hence. I'll take your wife and child on, and fix her up by the time you get there. When you've sold out all but your best horse, mount k him and come on. Sell for cash, for it will be inconvenient for you a to come back to collect money. Pity when I was selling my land to o Watson I did not think to put yours in the trade too." May be you n can sell it to him yet. ^y this plan you can come on with no trou- i ble or expense hardly."     -                 I  Curt said he liked the plan mightily, but doubted whether his wife I would agree to it. It was submitted to her, and she assented to it o readily; only charging her husband to come on as soon as possible. g In four days after this interview, Carp and all his negroes were I reply tdotake the road. He had provided a nice little Jersey for : Mrs. Curt and her child, and for fear of accidents, he promised to drive it himself all the way to Louisiana. Just as the caravan was- ti   MASTER WILLIAM MrTEN.          137  about setting out, "Stop," said Curt, "where shall I find you in Louisiana ?' "Sure enough !" exclaimed Carp, " Now didn't we like to make a pretty business of it! You will find us in Clwckilluckimaw Parish, on the Sabine river. Eere, I'll give you the name on a piece of pa- per--Tonnafoosk7 y id the town where the Post office is. If'you write before you hear from us, direct your letter to Tonannfobosnk Post of- fice, Chutakiluckimaw Parish, Louisiana.  There, it is all written out so you can't miss it."  So saying, the whole caravan moved forward, leaving poor Curt in loneliness, wifeless, childless, helpless, and in money penniless. Carp settled on Buffalo creek, Wilkinson county, Mississippi, where he and Mrs. Curt lived as man and wife for many years. Several children were the fruit of this union. Mrs. Curt had been dead about three months when Glib traced Carp to his hiding place. Her death was awful. When the Doctor told her that she could not possibly live more than twenty-four hours, she raised a scream that was terrific. "Doctor," cried she, iI am ruined Im lost. Lost, lost, lost forever !"  Aminister was sent for and came. "You needn't talk to me, sir-you needn't pray for me, sir- I thank you-but if you knew-oh what shall I do I! ' If I knew what, ma'am ?  Is it too bad to be told-  It might be told, but telling it will do no good and much harm- isn't passed, it's now-yes, ithas been for years, it's now, it's all the time." " Can't you tell it to your husband, or some of us ?" said one of the several ladies at her bedside. " He knows it-he knows all about it. No, my husband doesn't know it-he's innocent, poor man-yes, he knows part of it, but not all of it-not half of it, not a quarter of it, not a thousandth part of it-wasn't it a shame to treat him so ?" (another scream.)  ' Her mind's gone," said one. "No, it isn't!  know all that I am say- ing-.I know you, I know everybody here. It isn't anything passed, I tell you. It's now, I'm dying in it, and what good can praying do? It's too late to get out of it. If I were to get well I couldn't get out.of it. My children scare me, my husband scares me, the ne- groes scare me; my thoughts scare me, everything-send for Mr Carp here, and you. all go out of the room. Go clean aWay~ send all the children away, and all the servants, and I'll tell him all about it." It was done, and Carp entered the room. "Mr. Carp, see wlat you've brought me to! I never would have thought of it, if it hadn't'been for you----" &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7117-00000070"/> 138       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. "Haven't I treated you well, Flora?" "Yes, better than I de- served; but what does it all amount to? You've brought me to ev- erlasting ruin. It was bad enough in me to leave my poor husband; but to leave him as we did-with nothing to live on-to fill his ears with lies-to make fun of him-to send him all over the country hunting for us   \ Oh, Flora, don't tal on so! Try and compose yourself. Every- thing depends upon it. \Think of your children! The thing's past and gone now, and fretting over it can't mend it-- ' "Our children! Our children!- Look there '!- Look there! Ir. Carp! Mr. Carp!  Mr. Carp" - Anothe scream-and her mind was gone. She Jay for a few minutes in a stupor, during which the company were called back. Then she began in a low, calm tone of voice: "Ma! - Ma!---Ma, did you tell them ? you're scared-- 'Pray for Flora!'--You laughed--No -  No--  yes, both- In the Pulpit -Mrs. McRae (a wild laugh!) Mr. Wilson! (anoth- er) There, its bed time-- All dead but me! Ben's alive-- e'll all meet in heaven - He was so stupid--  Sabine! Another convulsive laugh-and she died. Carp was asked repeatedly what it was that distressed his wife so much in her last moments. He said she had told him all about it, but that it was nothing of any consequence-she was out of her head.  Benjamin Glib soon explained the mystery. After satisfying him- self fully that Carp was in Wilkinson, he went to a lawyer in Natchez, and unfolded the whole history of his ease from the death of his mother to Carp's elopement with his, sister. Mr. Stark, his Attor- ney, advised him to remain in Natchez until he (Stark) could go to Wilkinson, and ascertain all the particulars of Carp's history from his settlement in Mississippi to the time present. Two days were amply sufficient to assure him that Glib's story was true in-every particular. He immediately took the preliminary steps 'necessaryto the institution of suits against Carp, in behalf of both Glib'and Curt's daughter Sarah, now going under the name of Sally Carp. The child's interests could not be secured without letters of guardian- ship; and Stark assisted in procuring them. He did not allow Glib to apply for them until he had fortified himself with proofs impreg- nable, to sustain his application. As soon as it was made, all Wood- ville was thrown in a ferment. Carp's infamywas exposed, and the horrid death of his putative wife disposed everybody to believe it.   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         L39 Sarah caused' some difficulty at first, but as it was much more agree- able'to her to pass for a legitimate than an illegitimate child, it was easily removed. The suits were instituted and recoveries had which swept away nearly the whole of Carp's estate. But we must not suppress the 'history of the bill of sle.  As soon as he was served with process, Carp went to -Mr. Smith, a great Attorney of Woodville, to engage his services. "Well," says Smith, " let us take up one case at a time; what have you to say to Glib's case?" Lord bless your soul, squire," said Carp, "I've aot 'em tied so fast that they can't kick. Turn whichr way they will, they're headed." "Well, Carp, P'm glad to hear you say that, old fellow, for public prejudice is very strong against you." "Just look at that bill of sale, squire, and tell me how they're to get out of that, will you?" '  Smith read it, and while reading it, his countenance assumed nearly every variety of expression that the human countenance can assume. When he had finished- "Well," said he, " of all the Bills of Sale that ever I laid my eyes upon, that beats. If you had cone to me and told me to draw up an instrument, in the form of a bill of sale, that at all times, and in all Courts would be equal to a confession of judgment by'you, in any suit brought against you, by any person claiming under Mrs. Glib, I couldn't have come within gun-shot of this for that purpose. Burn it up immediately- destroy it-what's your 'wife's name doing to that bill of sale? Isn't Flora Curt the woman you've been living with as your wife? But it's not worth while to talk about it--de- stroy it, I tell you, immediately!" "And then what title will I have to show for all these negroes and--".  ' None; trust to the defects of Glib's title, or to his not being able to identify them-- "       .        . "Is that the best advice that y6u can give me?"  ' ' Yes."                . "Then I'll get another lawyer. Stark wonld give me the same advice; I understand it!" "What do you mean, you cheating, swindling, adulterous rascal?" said Smith, moving to the back room with a stick hunting motion. Carp was gone before his return. Carp employed a young attorney of Woodville, who confirmed his  views of the bill of sale, in. every particular. "There's the title,"  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7117-00000071"/> "O        MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. '%,             ... said he, 'plainly and distinctly set forth-not simply upon a good consideration, which would have been all-sufficient, but also upon a valuable consideration, and, to make assurance doubly sure, upon di- vers other consider&amp;tions. This title, like the resistless torrent, is sustained by various. tributaries from perfectly pure sources: Then it is fortified by a rampart of truth -ad generosity on your part, Mr. Carp, that must forever protect it from the imputation of fraud. All else is mere surplusage. How such a profound jurist as Mr. Smith is, could have advised you to destroy this all important document I cannot conceive, unless he overlooked taat sterling legal maxiim: UTtile per in utile?on vitrlat'ur." Carp was enraptured with this impromptu display of legal ability; rejoiced at his change of Attornies, and highly flattered at finding his skill in guarding against "aftcrclaps" so filly avouched. Far' s we have digressed from the direct path of our narrative, we are strongly tempted to follow this bill of sale through the several Courts in which it made its appearance; but in charity to the reader's patience we forbear. Suffice it to say, that as soon as Stark saw it, he took a copy of it, served notices to produce it in all the cases, and never let it get out of Court until it had, as we have said, turned over nearly the whole of Carp's estate to Glib and his niece. This is but one of a thousand instances in which rascality has over-reach- ed itself, and been made subservient to justice.  Glib and his niece returned to Alabama, rich, and both prosperep in life. Curt was lucky. Watson purchased him out entirely, in less than two months after Carp's departure, at tolerably fair prices, and he'set out in quest of his wife 'with three thousand dollars in his pocket. He had not gone far in Louisiana bcfore he learned that' there were no such places in the State as Chuckilckimaw and'Ton- nafoosky: so coming upon a valuable piece of land, he purchased it cheap, and settled down upon it with two negro womnen, proceeds of his surplus funds. His land grew in value and his negroes in num- ber, and thus when he died, (a little before his wife,) he left a right pretty little estate, wich ynt to swell the fortune of his daughter. It would have been lk-t her, but for a letter which .he wrote to a friend in Georgia, just before his death, who three pr fou r years af- terwards went to visit Glib.    CHAPTER XVII. As soon as Captain Thompson joined the Methodists, his eister ex- pressed a wish to attach herself to the same church to which he and his wife belonged. "No, Anna," said the Captain, "I advise you against it. I am sure you cannot be a better christian in the Methodist Church than you have proved yourself to be in the Presbyterian Church. If I. can be as bright an ornament to my Church, as you are to yours, I shall deem myself greatly blessed .  "Brother, you greatly over-rate imy piety. I h:,vc'a great many faults and weaknesses which your eye never sees, but which I see and mourn over, and struggle against, every day." 1" shall hardly be convinced of my errio by tlat kind of proof, my dear sister. One brazen sin would bring your piety in question with me more than a hundred faults and weaknesses hidden in the heart, and mourned over and struggled against every day. But enough of this-stay with your people, with wh6m you have long held sweet communion, to whom you are endeared by a"thousand tics, and who are entitled to the benefit of your influence and example. I am not sure that thedivision of the Church into sects is not of God's ap- pointment. Some good results from the divisin, obviously. It se- cures the Scriptures from interpolation and mutilation, stimulates the several churches to good works, liberality, generlity, and activi- ty in the advancement of the Redeemer's Kingdom ; brings truth to the test of open, fair and able discussion, guards the chuich 'from new heresies, if it cannot eradicate old ones, and effectually prevents a union of Church and State in this blessed country, at least. So much good does it, and much more would it do, if each sect would practice, as it should, the heavenly precepts of love and charity taught them by their common 'Head. If others will not practice them let us do it, ny dear sister; and be assured, if our example passes unobserved on earth, it will not be overlooked in Heaven." "Those are sweet counsels, my dear brother, and they have al- ready banished from my mind every thought of quitting my church. It is strange, very strange, but I cannot dispossess my mind of the thought that some heavy calamity is' going to befall us. I am too happy for earth. I question whether there is this day a human be- ing this side of Heaven as happy as I am. tou once said to me  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7117-00000072"/> "2       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.  sportively, 'turn Methodist and shout' and now I could do it with right good will. I can hardly keep from it " "And why should you wish to keep from it? It is one of the means which Providence has appointed for relieving the overcharged heart, and I do not see why it should be repressed. I know why it is repressed, very well. It is regarded by most people as very un- dignified-only, however, when mostpeople are devoid of the feel- ing that provokes it. Let the people, dignitaries and all, witness a closely contested election of deep interest; at one moment it seems to be going one way, at the next the other, and thus the contestants alternately pass each other, until they stand abreast with but two votes in the box-they come out for the same man. What do you see, then, among the victors? One weeps outright with joy, another laughs frantically, another vents the long suppressed breath, and smiles; but all applaud, and nine-tenths raise a shout that mav be- heard for miles. There is nothing at all undignified in this! It is perfectly natural. Now they are all moved by the same spirit; but it manifests itself in different ways according to the different tem- peraments of the crowd. I suppose if a battery of artillery were bearing upon them, and they were forbidden to shout, under pain of being fired upon, they inight suppress it (doubtful if all would); but what would be thought of, the man who would recommend such a measure, or any milder one, to prevent this honest outhurst of feel- ing? When General W  iashington passed through the country on his Southern tour, he was met by multitudes at every town and village at which he stopped. As soon as the throngs caught a glimpse of the approaching hero, they made the welkin ring with their shouts. . As he passed through the streets, women waved their handkerchiefs, and wept; old soldiers wept, but most waved their hats, and shouted again and again, loud and long. He would have been regarded as aTory who gave no outward demonstration of joy at such times. The very next day these same people would go to a Methodist meeting, and sneer at a new convert for shouting. And what has Washington done for any one of us, compared with what Christ has done for the new convert? What the liberty which Washington gained for us, compared with 'the liberty wherewith Chri st Ims made, us free?' What can we promise ourselves from this great Republic, compared with the Savior's legacy to the soldiers of the Cross? At His birth the angels of heaven shouted. His second, coming 'to earth will be her- alded by a shout. At His triumphant entry into Jerusalem, the- whole multitude of 1tis disciples shouted. The Pharisee (strict re-   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          143 ligionists) begged him to rebuke them. What was His reply? : t tell you, if these should hoel their peace, the stones would immnediately cry out.' But He had not yet died for these disciples. No one is offend- ed at a shout from the dying Christian! Inothe times of bavid and the Prophets, it was not regarded as undignified in holy men to shout. I used to laugh at the shouting Christians, myself. I ised; to be provoked with them, until I learned somethint of their feelings, and then I was very ready to excuse them. From excusing I went to thinking, and from thinking to' eading upon the subject; and the result of my deliberations and research is what I have delivered to you. Now, do not misunderstand me. I do not say that Christians ought to shout, much less that shouting, is an infallible test of Christianity; and least of all, that there are not just as good Christians who never shout, as there are who do. I do not believe that there is a better shouting Christian in our Church than you are; but I do' say that it is the most natural thing in the world that Christians of some temperaments should shout, if I understand any- thing about religion; and that ridicule of it comes with ill grace from a shouting world, or a non-shouting Church." "But brother, how does it happen that there is shouting in no other Church in the world but the Methodist?" "Just because the Methodist is, (in one sense) the newest church in the world. When we join a church we as naturally drop into the ways of its people as we do into its creed. I know very well where they all began; it was in such a scene of excitcment and clamor as amazed the lookers-on, and led them to mock, and to say that the converts were full of new wine. But all churches will, in process of time, conform themselves to the opinions and manners of the world, just as far as they can, without compromising their prin- qciples, Prudence or policy may dictate this course-to avoid perse- cution, ridicule and contengpt, or to gain popularity. inever did the world show any mercy, not to say charity to religious excitements. The Methodists have hardly yet passed the fiery ordeal through which all zealous, self-denying God-serving, world-defying Christians 'must pass. The marks of violence are still upon their humble meeting houses, and derision seedts them at all their services. As vet, they have no church etiqufette (if you will excuse the term), no thought .anda very little knowledge, of the world's dignities; for they are mostly poor and illiterate; no idea that joy should be disciplined, or transports suppressed. They, therefore, give the rein to their feelings just as nature prompts them. They are happy, very happy,  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7117-00000073"/> "4       RMASTER WILLIAM  MTT'EN.  and they express their happiness in the natural way, without fear of startling their brethren, offendinge their pastors, or- provoking sin- ners. But it is not to be supposed twt our church will be exempt from the common lot of churches. With a penniless Ministry, fer- vid, zealous, devout, persecuted, traversing the, country from the mountains to the seaboard, and preaching the Gospel to every crea- ture, wlite, black, bond, free, rich, poor, at their own doors, it must grow, and as it grows it will increase in dignity, science, fine preach- ing, fine dressing, fine eating, fine stations, fine circuits, fine music, fine churches, and strong voting. Of course, it will then become, especially with the most respected office holders and office seekers; very respectable. There will be religion in it, sterling religion in it still-religion armed for giant work, and well employed; but there will be no shoutingin it, no fraternal embraces in it, no out gushing of hymns from a thousand voices, eloquent of the heart's heavenly inspirations, no 'brothering' between great preachers and poor members. Or if these distinctive features of primitive Methodism be not entirely effaced, you will have to seek them, to find them, in some poor brother's circuit, in the gorges of the mountains, the wilds of the West, or the negro quarters of the rich." ' Verily, brother, you have said more in defence of shouting, than I supposed could be said; and most certainly, if I never shout my- self, I shall always, hereafter, look with the greatest indulgence upon those Christians who do." "That is the lesson that I would inculcate, my sister. And when you learn what may be said in defence of it, tell me, what think you of that Pastor of a church who requested a good sister of his flock to leave the church, because, under his ow6n glowing description of Heaven, or under something else he said, that filled her heart with joy, she relieved it with a shout Think of her, ifiyou please, per- chance the holiest of his charge, retiring from the house of worship -from the sermon which refreshed her, under the eye-shot of the ,congregation, shamed, subdued, depressed, disgraced!" "Oh, my dear brother! Surely such a' thing never happened?" 'Surely such a thing did happen, if a credible witness is to be believed. It may be that that woman paid more, for her means, to build the church from which she was ordered-paid more, for her means, to support the Pastor who so deeply wounded her, than any other member of his, congregation. She never shouted, again, in his church, you may be sure, nor did any other one of his flock; and the consequence was, (I conjecture, not without some reason), he   MASTER WILLIAM   IatlTEN.       145 had ever afterwards a very quiet, orderly, Laodicean Church. Chari- ty, my sister! let there be charity among the churches. Instead of looking for faults in'each other, let them be looking for what is good in each other, and -let them reciprocally interchange the good, and reject the faulty. In this way, all mighit be improved-all'would be more endeared to each other than they are." "You have so well defended shouting among Christians, that per- haps you can give me some new views upon another usage of your church, which has always seemed to me much more obje6tionable than shouting. I allude to your altar scenes in times of revival. Some are singing, some are talking to mourners, and two or three are praying aloud at the same time, and when to all this is added the shouts of the converts, the whole scene is one of utter confusio, it- seems to me. What can you'say in defence of all this?"  "Nothing. It is not only indefensible, but it is positively un- scriptural. Each and all of these exercises are proper in their place; but to have them all going on at one and the same time is little better than to set all the rules of order, human and divine, at defiauce. The honesty of intentidn' and benevolence of purpose with which it is done, are all that make it tolerable, even to the most charitable; but these are very poor excuses for those who are presumed to have read Paul's Epistles, and yet encourage such things. And here, a very pertinent illustration of what I have just said, pre- sents itself: If at revivals in your church, your people would-borrow a little more fervor from ours, and ours in like circumstances would borrow a little more order and solemnity from yours, I think both would' be inmproved. Dignity, gravity, and order well become the christian; but love, joy and zeal, much better become him; and if they cannot all be harmonized, why, let the first give way, I say, and -let all give way to love, if it be possible to separate joy from it! And when love and joy abound in him, let mim be indulged ih his nature's way of manifesting them, even to the interruption of a sermon for a time; and if the reeling become general among the flock, why, let thl sermon go; there is no better preaching, at times, than the re- joicing together of many happy Christians. These are my crude no- tions, sister; take them for what they are worth." ' "I thank you for them, my very dear, dear brother, and I am sure that they will be of seryice to me. Oh, how much happiness I have lost from your delay in emllbacing Christianity!" "Not so much, perhaps, from want of my counsels and religious opinions, as from want of that deference and respect which I should e ,  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7117-00000074"/> "6       MTASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. have shown to your piety, and that tenderness of address that I should have shown to a sister."  In the main, things went on smoothly and happily in the two families, during the vacation; but befioe its close, both the Captain and his ister .had their quiet a little disturbed ,by William's over attention to Snap-dragon. It was a natural curiosity that prompted him to enquire carefully into Snap-dragon's capabilities, accomplish- ments, predilectiofs, and tractability. By close observation arnd'ex- periment, he discovered that a little needless whipping improved him wonderfully-(such the difference between a teacher and a disciple.) It made him move airily, and infused life, grace and activity into both his extremities; that he could trot eght miles an hour-that he could beat Billy Figg's Nicktail, Billy Pine's Catham, and Bob Maston's Flying Nelly easily; that he stood the firing of a gun on him very well; that he could clear a six-rail fence at a leap; that by tickling, him in a particular way in the flank (which he called the " grabble-tickle ") he could make him kick amusingly, that by applying'the "grabble-tickle" to his back-bone, just behind the 'saddle, he could carry him through a variety of most interesting evolutions-tail-switching, warping, biting, (backwards, at nothing,) polka-dancing, and furious kicking. 'One thing he taught him which was perfectly original, and that was to stop at the cluck' or chirp, and go at the word " wo!" To teach him al. these accomplishments William had to devote nearly his whole tnme to him. He had to ride him far and lear; and in so doing it was just as well to call and see all the planters within seven miles of the village, and rest awhile with them, and entertain them with all the wonders of Doc- tor Waddel's school, as to ride that far and return without dismount- ing. Every gathering in the county he was certain to attend by means whereof he had a fine opportunity of studying human nature, in some of its most interesting aspects. He saw how petty elections were conducted-how electibneering was carried on-how much rum it took to elect a Captain and a Justice of the Peace. He saw justice administerei by magistrates in their shirt-sleeves, and heard stiff quarrels between them, and the suitors-he saw card playing in its most unpretending humility and simplicity, to-wit, by a couple of the sovereignty, seated cross legged on the ground, with a dirty cotton handkerchief 'between them for a table, and a half deck of dirtier cards. (Here- was the $introduction of 'sguatter sovereignty" into the country; but who could have sup- posed that it would ever make such a fuss in the world as it has (    '    ,   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         147 made'!) He saw cock-fights occasionally, dog-fights often, and men- fights regularly--now and then, he was entertained with a quarter race and a foot,race-upon one occasion h 'thok up a banter of " the universal world" for a foot race,' by: a youth both: older and larger than himself' and gained the victory handsomely. His competitor said, "if he' couldn't beat him a running, he could whip him." Bill "pitched into him,' as the saying is, without a parley, ahd flogged him, beautifully, and to the delight and admiration of every- body, who thought-it mean in liim to pick a quarrel with a boy who, had fairly beaten him, just from shame of his defeat. These feats gave William great renown in the' county. Perhaps no youth in 'the -land ever made greater progress 'in, ' the study of human nature" than/ William did in"the short space of two months. But without Snap-dragon, where would he have been?. Confined to the darkness of his own village! And whoever heard of any human nature in a village, save at Court timers, general elections, and general, parades? The Captain often heard of his progress, and often counselled him. "'William," he would say, "I fear I committed a great error in giv- ing you that horse; I am sure I did. It was one of the most im- prudent acts' of'my life."  "Why, uncle?"  "For many reasons. He takes up#,all your time. I never see a book in your hand; :you have hardly attended a religious meeting, except on Sunday, since the vacation commencsd. You are too young to have control of a horse. He is a spirited horse; and if not managed with care he may break your neck-" "Uncle, he can't throw me to save his life.", "i'm glad to hear that; my main design in giving him to you, was to make you a good horseman; but he may run away with you, carry you under the limb of a tree, and' knock your brains out.

"Why, William,' my son, you 'ought not to visit people's houses inu tat way--"  "Uncle, they, always tell me they are glad to see me, and always beg me to come and see them again." "To' be sure they do; but because they are kind, you should not tax their hospitality all the time. At times, I am 'sure you must fall upon them, very unseasonably, and give them. no little inconvenience. When they see you in town here, and ask you to come and see them, why, then go; but don't thrust yourself upon them at all hours, un- invited. " I'll obey you uncle." Again the Captain would renew his complaints and advice: "William, your mother is very uneasy about you. She says you constantly come home charged with news fror all the gatherings in the county. Surely, you don't frequent such places? What interest can you take in them? Wh -t do you' promise. yourself from such resorts? I charge you under pain of my sore displeasure to abandon them." "I will do so, uncle." *Williaun's victories happened to be reported to the Captain by Mr. Moore, in the proesence of William, and in the way of congratulation -to him! "Why, William!" 'exclaimed the Captain, "is it possible that you have been running foot races and fightinmg----' ( Oh, don't blame him,7' said Mr. Moore; "I supposed you knew all about it, since'it is' talked about everywhere. But don't blame William, for he never did a better thing in all his life, and never will do a better while he lives. He was at the Court, at old man Haral- son's, and there was an unconimonly large gathering for the-occasion. There .was a-fellow there, a forward, noisy chap, named Jake Black, who was cutting up high shines. He said he could beat anything of his weight and inches in the universal Wotld at a foot race., ,I ,can beat you,' said William. ' You V!' says ;Black. 'I can run round you three -times in fifty yards and then beat -you.' ' Well,' says William, :suppose you try it.' The match was made up, a hundred yards were stepped' off,'"and all on the Court ground went toseo the race. At the word they started, and William' beat him a clear 'light of at least seven yards. There was a general slout as. they came in, and many, had somethingm digging to say to Black. Ono told him he oughtn't. to run against anything but grub-worms and terrapins. Another told him his belly didn't give his legs faii play.. 4^'   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          149 'I saw your thigh,' says he 'hit your belly every step you made. If you can only manage to hook up your belly just three quarters of an inch before you run, so as to 'give your legs full sweep, you'd 'beat Bill Mitten thirty yards in the hundred, I know you would.' 'Oh,' says a third, 'his stomach had nothing to do with it-at least it wouldn't have had, ifbhe'had been in good keep; but he was in no order to run. I saw him eat two water nillions and a peck of peach- es, not an hour before the race. *Take that weight off of him, and where would Bill Mitten have been?' 'Well,' said the second, 'that's just what I say. He only lacks three-qnarters of an inch of beating 'the universal world;' I thought his belly was nat'rl7.' "This kind of chat," continued Moore, "made Jake very mad, and as William stood lapghilg with the rest, Jake stept up to him, and said, iIf you can beat me running, I can whip you mighty easy.' You know that hard place in the .road .between old man Haralson's house and the Court room"? He .was standing there; and the words was no sooner out -of hiis mouth' than William seized-him, fetched the hip lock upon him,. and gave him the hardest fall that I ever saw a boy get in all my life. Before Jake 'could recover from his fall, William was on 'him, giving him bringer. He very soon 'told the news' (cried 'enough!') and William got off of him without a scratch. I don't suppose there ever was a people more rejoiced and surprised than they all were at William's doings. Jake had no idea that a boy dressed as fine as William was, could fight at all, nor didc anybody else believe it; but, Lord'bless your soul, Captain, he walked, over Jake in the highest style of fighting! I tell you what, sir, he's as active as a eat and as bold as a lion. So you see he was not. to blame."' "And now came the tug of war," (intestine 'war), with the Cap-- tain. Before Moore had proceeded four sentences i'n his narrative, Captain Thompson's countenance lost every trace of amazement and, indignation, and assumed a rather unchristian placidity. Tbh. next.; transition was to a benignant'smile;; then to an expression'of wonder, and delight; then to a laugh Qf triumph , and so it went on, stronger and strOnger, to the end of the chapter; so tha .when Moore con. cluded, it was manifet that "brother"Thompson had no more, thought of religion in him, than he had of the tattling of his counte. nance; and no more thought of the tattlink of his countenance. than if he had been all the time imn profound sleep. But the time had come for him to apeal, and what could he say? Bill had fol- lowed his counsels to the letter, and 'had exhibited the very fruits Kf   . *   '  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7117-00000076"/> from them that he had anticipated and desired. Should he noyw re- buke him? That would not do. Should he :applaud his conduct? That would not do from a Christian. Should he remain silent? That would be a tacit sanction of all that Williaii bad done. But say something he must,;and that something tnust be :extemporized; so he began, in i very cool tone, that might, be taken for the com0 posure of religion, or the composure of gratification:.  "Why, William, I'm astonishedat you!" " Very true, but very equivocal. "I don't think, in any vieto of the case, that his saying simply,  that he could whip you, justified you in attacking him--" "Buts Uncle, I saw that he was mad,' and bent upon picking a quarrel with me, or hacking me before all thecompany, and I thionght that as I would have to fight or back -out, I'd best take a runfing start on him; for the first blow in a' fight is balt the battle, they 8ay.

Oh! of all the disgusting things in this world, a mere bully-a- man whd forces his fellow be- ing into a fight with him, merely for the 'vile fame of whipping him, is the most disgusting. I have seen such men, and I have despised them. They pretend to take as insults what They know was meant in friendship,. or in fun. They wantonly assail feelings, play insuf- ferable pranks with men, and then assail them for speaking harshyI of what they say they meant as innocent sport. ,They take occasion from a man's dress, his features, his person, his carriage, to worry him into resistance of. some kind, and then, flog' him 'for resisting.   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          151 Can anything better mark a devil than such conduct as this? Now, William, I don't blame you for fighting (that is, upon worldly prin- ciples) under the circumssances; but I 'do blame you for going to s auch places-not for gointg to Mr. Haralson's, for he is a very worthy man, and has a vgry worthy family, but for going there in COoit times. I have been there often and I don't remember ever to have seen one of his sons in the crowd' of Court 'days, in my life. And I blame you for running a race, at such a time and place." Now if the reader can extract from this long harangue, what were the Captain's views of the case of Mitten vs. Black, upon Christian principles, he is certainly much wiser than the writer. Whether it was becoming in him to discuss the case so generally upon " worldly primciples," without drawing a line of istinction be- tween them and Christian principles-whether it was right in him to say what he would have advised four or five months ago, that he would not now without any specifications that might enlighten his nephew, as to whether he meant to take back any of his counsels upon universal excellence, are questions which we will not under- take to settle. But we will venture to say, that Master Mitten iln- ferred from it, that the Captain was highly delighted, (hut of course only on worldly 2p incples) with his achievements, and that he need never fear the Captain's wrath for fighting, provided he would always fight at the right time, in the right place, and for good reasons in Mr. Moore's judgment.  In the course of his observations, Master Mitten discovered two other things through the aid of Snap-dragon, which we must not omit to mention; the one was, that six or seven months abstinence from strong drink, had hot entirely abated his relish for it; and the other was, that the squatter sovereigns committed many errors in their games that he could -have rectified with success. It was the custom of not a few 'heads of families at this, time,' to make up a mint-julep of peach or apple-brandy, every morning, and to give a little to every member of the family, old' and young, blacks excepted. It was a much more invariable custom to make a large bowl of egg- nog every Chiistmas, of which the whole family were expected to take a little more freely, and it was considered rather a laughing than a serious matter if some of the children got intoxicate d; No * one ever entered a house' to tarry for a half hbur, without being asked "to take something to drink," andswith the plainer people of thf country, this invitation was extended to boys hardly in their teens, and was accepted Without exciting 'any surprise. Not many years' / J                      .  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7117-00000077"/> before the times of which we are speaking, probably down to the very times, a, still more remarkable custom prevailed among some, if not all Methpdist Preachers;-which was to ask a blessing upon every glass of toddy they took. Should this statement be questioned, we have authority for it, at hand, which i-o man in Georgia will question. fow this custom originated it is easy to divine; the dis- cipline of the Methodist Church enjoined upon its members to do nothing upon which they could not invoke God's blessing, and as they never dreamed that there was anything sinful in taking a glass of toady, or, as it was more commonly called a little sweetened dram, they "said grace over it."  While such customs were rife in the country, it is not to be won- dered at that Master Mitten had frequent opportifnities of indulging his early formed relish for ardent spirits, even without the help, of Snap-dragon-with his help they were quintupled. He however took care never to appear at home, or in the presence of his Uncle, ".disguised with liquor." But as the Captain saw that he was doing no good, he feared that he was doing much harm, and he rejoiced great- ly when the time arrived for his return to school. A little before this time, the Captain informed William overnight that he wished to borrow Snap-dragon for a short ride the next morning, as all his own horses were in use. William gave a cordial assent, of course. "Send Tom over with him directly after breakfast, I'm only going to Doctor Wingfield's," said the Captain. The Captain lived on the street that led directly to Doctor Wing- field's and near the edge of the town. AS William had never seen his uncle on Snap-dragon, and felt a deep interest in his performance under the saddle of his kind benefactor, he took his position in the inner lock of a fence on the street, under cover of some, high weeds, whence, with a little change of position, he could have a full view of the Captain's house, and two or three hundred yards of the street and road leading from it. Tom got to the house with Snap-dragon, about the time that William gob ncomfortably seated. Snap was soon saddled, and the Captain was nearly as soon by his side, ready to mount him. Snap showing signs of impatiance to get off. What makes that horse do so, Tom?" asked the Captain. "I don't like his motions."  He's gentle, Mas' David "' said Tom. "He only do so till you start him." '      s The Captain placed one hand on Snap's neck and the other onthe back of the saddle to mount; this hand happened to slip and fall a   MASTER WILLIAM  MTTEN.        15S little rudely dn Snap's back. Snap, nothing doubting that this was the beginning of the a' grabble tickle," commenced with the prelimi- naries of the polka. "Why, that horse is ruined," said the Captain'. I wonder he hasn't knocked William's brains out long ago."' "Mas' David I tell you the' an't nothin' the matter with him* This is nothin' bat some little foolnish Mas William larn him. He's gentle."  In the mean time Bill was rolling in the weeds, "enthused"* with delight.  The Captain made a second attempt; aid mounted.  "Tom, tell your Mistress-Wo!" said he to fidgetting Snap, and away went Snap " to the tune of eight miles an hour!" "Wo!' repeated the Captain more emphatically, and Snap put off at half speed, at which gait he passed Bill in an agony of laughter. The Captain immediately conjectured that Bill had been running Snap, and that the horse took " wo" for " go!" and he did not repeat the word again. Snap soon became pacified, and the Captain brought him to a halt. He studied awhile whether it would be best for him to go on or return. He'concluded he would try Snap a little farther any how; so he clucked to hinm to proceed; but so far from proceed. ing, Snap settled himself in more, dignified composure than he had exhibited during the whole morning. He clucked again, with no better success. He chirped, but these changes of note operated upon Snap like a seranade. "' Why, did ever anybody see such a fool horse since the world was made!" mused the, Captain. "What's a body to do with him? How is he to be made to go on, or stop? If I ever give another chap a fine horse, he may give me a thousand lashes, and I'll thank him for it. It certainly was the' unluckiest act of my life to give Bill'this horse '"  Upon the whole, the Captain concluded it would be best for him . to get out of temptationt as quick as possible, by returning home. Just as he made up his mind to this course, Mr. Foster met him: "Good morning,'brother Thompson!" said Foster. "Good morning, brother, Foster," said Mr. Thompson. "Which way are, you going?" "I was going to Doctor Wingfield's, but I've got on my nephew's horse, which the boy has so compfetely spoiled, that there is no do- ing anything with him, so I'll go back with you." *This word, of very modern coinage, is now getting into pretty general use, in some parts of the country.  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7117-00000078"/> 154       MASTTER WILLIAM- MTEN. All of the proceedings up to this moment convinced. Snap-dragon that he had been brought out that morning for no other purpose in the world, than to beat Mr. Foster's horse in a quartej race. His conjectures were fully confirmed, when in answer to Mr. Foster's question "'don't you own him?" the Captain, as he pacedabout, answered emphatically "No i" At the word, Snap dashed. The Captain soon took him- up, and. waited till brother Foster came up. As he approached, the Captain clucked to Snap, and he stopped crustily. "Bless your soul, honey," said brother Foster, " that's a mighty good looking horse, but he's a mighty, foolish one." He was one of the finest horses in the land-  Wo!" cried the Captain, (forgetting himself,) to Snap, in rage to beat Foster's horse, and away he dashed again. He was stopped as before. "Why, brother Thompson, that horse seems to go when he ought to stop, and stop when he ought to go," "Exactly so," said the Captain; and Snap bristled considerably at the last word, but was chirped to a halt instantly. "Why bless your soul, honey, I never did see a horse take on after that sort in all my life. I wouldn't give this pipe for him, if I had to ride him." "No," said the Captain, (Snap bristled,) "nor I neither." In this way, between stops and starts, and sidles and snorts, the Captain reached home greatly to his delight, and the still greater de- light of William. The lecture he gave his nephew at their next meeting, we leave the reader to chnjecture. - f   , C'HAPTEI  XVIII. WHSN the time came for'Witlianm Mitten to return to school, he begged his uncle to allow hi[m to keep his horse at, Willngton. He thight, ithlat if he parded two or three'miles from the school house, and rodeto school and 'baek th his boarding house every day, his health would ba greatly improved." He said, that "if he had a horse to ride to the post office he could get and mail letters speedily -that he often wished to go and hear Mr. Waddel preach at Rocky River Churich; but that he had no means of getting there-that it would cost nothing hardly ,to, keep a horse at Willington. That several -times during the summer he had suffered from head-ache, occasioned by hard study and want of exercise, and that unless he could take more exercise in the summer ,months than he had been taking, he feared his health would be ruined. That in the winter it was not so bad; for the exercise of geting wood, and the active plays of the school, at this season gave him plenty of exercise; but in warm Weather, he someiimes got so weak that it seemed to him he would faint." 'Mrs. Mitten saidj' that she would cheerfully bear the expense of the horse, if her brother would consent to 7illiam's keeping him' at Willington. That the idea of his constitution being shattered by severe study was distressing to her. That she had suffered no little in mind herself from. the difficulty of hearing tram William often through the mails, and that there was something delightful in the thought of herson going to sacred service with his preceptor. She couldJ conceive of' nothing more likely to produce reciprocal endear- ment between the two than this; but that if brother David thought differently she had nothing to say." t William," said the'Captain, 'you perplex me not a little. The horse is yours, and do not like to inerfere with your right of pro- perty in him; and yet, to allow you to take him off to school with you, and keep him. there, knowing as I do how you have used him, seems to me Iittle better than wilfully putting your life in jeopardy, encouraging you to idleness, pushing you into difiiculties with your preceptor, and periling .all my bright hopes of you at once.

'"No, I will not do that; but I'll tell you what I will do; he cost me one hundred dollars; now I will give you :for him, one hundred and twenty dollars in any property you will name-but a htorse. That sum will ,get you a very. pretty' iittle library, that will be of use to you through life.

In considering my proposition, forget that I am your Uncle; forget all the good that I have ever done you, and decide upon it' with perfect freedom of will.

"No, Uncle; Mr. Cunningham has never done me the favors that you have; he's no relation of mine; I do not respect his judgment as I do yours; and to prove what I say, I now teil you that though I never was as much attached to anything in all my life as I am to Snap-dragon, I freely and voluntarily, and of my own judgment alone, accept your proposition; and you shall say whether: the:ppa$ for the horse shall"be in books or a negro boy."

He is yours,: 'my dear boy, and I will not purchase him from; you upon any other considerations than those which would influence you in a trade with a stranger." - '-Why, brother, that seems to me a very strange refinement." I don't think so, sister. Suppose I had opened the proposition in this way: ' William, I regret that I gave you that horse. Now, I gave him to you unasked for; I am your Uncle, who loves you; who has done a great deal for you; to whom you owe a large debt of gratitude but for whom you would never have gone to Mr. Waddel's school, and by conseqcuence must have lost all the honors you have gaineed there; in all which, as in many other instances, you have seen' how much better my judgment is as to your true in- terests than yours; now, in my judgment, the horse will do you more harm than good; yield, therefore, to my judgment-return my love and kindness, by giving me back the horse.' Would you think 'all this right'?" "No, certainly; for that would be just working upon the child's feelings, to get from him his horse for nothing; but you propbse to give him more than the value of the horse, and in better pro- perty." '            .  "Thenthere is no difference between the case at hand, and the case put, but in the return that is offered to him for the horse. It is right' to work on his feelings in any way I please to get his horse from him, provided, I give him for him what you and I think a fine price! Is that your doctrine? iDon't you think that William 6ught to have a will iti the matter?" Oh, pshaw! The cases are not at all alike. You havn't gone on with all that string of appeals to his heart; you would not let-me even speak of your better judgment; you forewarned him not to let  his decision be governed in any way by his relation to you or your kindness to him. He's not a man to judge of prices, and of what will bebest for him."  "' Nevertheless, he has all the rights of a man in trade.

"Highly Ipraiseworthy, sister! Too praiseworthy to be abused; and it would be an abuse of them li me, to avail myself of thb'm to deprive him of a piece of property which he does not wish to part with. And now, my dear boy, I withdraw my proposition; and let it not distress you the least in. the world, that I have done so.

Keep your horse, son, but don't think of taking him to Dr. Waddel's. I have hot yet fully made up my mind whether I have"authority to forbid your so doing-I incline to the opinion that standing as I do in the place of a iparent to you, duty requires me to interdict positively your keeping a horse at Willington; but I hope you will not force me to decide that question by attempting to take him. I have many things to say against it, but let these suf- 'fic,: You've spoiled that horse-he is dangerous to others, if not to you---you will have fifty students on his back, and sonie of them may get hurt--perhaps killed by him. He will be a useless expense to your-mother-the summer months are now gon'e--he will interfere with your studies--dispatch of letters between here and Willington is of no consequence, and the weather will be 'too cold for you to go off to preaching with Mr. Waddel." Now, brother," said Mrs. Mitten, " don't understand me in what I say, as interfering in the least with your authority over William, or as opposing my judgment to yours, or as raising the slightest ob- jection to your dealing with him in this matter as you think best; but simply as asking an explanation of you. William offers you his horse on your own. terms; you refuse him because he does not offer him from the right motives, or the right feelings, or somiething else that I don't understand, and yet you doubt whether you will allow him to use him as he wishes to. Hoew do you reconcile these views?"  "It will be time, enough to reconcile them when I come to act upon them; but should I deem it my duty to forbid his keeping a   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         159 horse at Willington, I should reconcile them just as you would in giving a toy to your child, and forbidding him to use it to-the an- noyance of your household; or to the injury of himself." ' But William is not now a child, and I am sure that he would obey your directions strictly in the use of him."  ' Yes, Uncle; you may just lay down the law, and I will obeyit strictly in every, thing."             '  "But I cannot anticipate all- the Ways in which you maymis-use him." "' Brother, will you take it amiss if I venture a word of advice here?"  "No; by no means. I will always hear your views in reference to your child with pleasure; and what is more I will always take it, if I am not con/fident that it will operate to the prejudice' of your son." "Well Hknow that you take a pleasure in indulging him in every thing you can, that you do not think will be injurious to him."' "True!"  "And I am equally. se that William has reaped too many' benefits from obedience to you,AWto disobey you again in anything. Now, this plan has oceurred to me: September, though a fail month is always a warm, relaxing, sickly month in this climate; and as he has been much on horse-backr during the vacation, it may injure his health to break off suddenly from this exercise, and set himself down to severe study. I knbw he has made rather a bad use of his horse during the vacation, but he can't do seat sehool. You 'have enume- rated the evils you apprehend from his keeping a horse there, and that will be sufficient to guard him against them-; for he has told me over and over again, that he believed he had the best Uncle in the world; that you had only to tell him what todo, and he would do it' if it were'to go to the earth's end. Now give him any other orders or cautions about the horse that you think proper; let him keep him only while the weather continues warm, and as soon as it turns. cool, I will send Tom for him and fetch him home, if you say so. The - short vacation at Christmas will soon be here, and if he keeps him till then, he can ride him home, and save us the trouble of Sending for him. But no matter for that, if you say send for him before, it shall be done. As for the expenses of keeping the horse, it will cost no more to keep him there than here, nor as much; and therft, he will be of someuse, and here he will be of none. But the gkieo benefit I promise myself from it, is William's delightful improving trips with Mr. Waddel to his preaching places."

William retired. "Do you know, Anna," continued the Captain, "that nothing has fallen from William in three months, which has pained me, not to say offended me, so much, as that Rocky River plea for keeping a horse? Here he has been in the midst of preaching, and various religioun exercises for three or Tour weeks, and except on the Sab- bath, he has hardly ever darkened a Church door in the day time, and never at night, unless you pressed him into your service; and now all of a sudden he has taken a wonderful yearning to accompa- ny Mr. Waddel upon his preaching excursions." ; Brother, I think the day'has gone by when William would de- ceive; and I am very happy in having it in my power to explain this thing to your satisfaction. I talked to William about his taking so little interest in the meetings, and he said, that he wanted recrea- tion after his hard study, for the long term. That he would soon have to renew his studies for ten lon bhrntls, with only two weeks vacation at Christmas, and that if fie did not improve his health in the vacation he'would break down. That he had been to preaching in the country several times when there was preaching in town, because he could take exercise in going there. Now at school the state of things will be just reversed. He will be kept constantly employed except on Saturdays and Sundays, and'he would be desirous of exercising on those days and doing good at the same timd." The Captain looked doubtingly, and said no more upon that head; but he returned from the episode: "Anna," said he, ,c I am very anxious to accommodate you and William, but I have awful misgivings about, this horse affair. There is much weight in what you have said; but it does not satisfy me. What a world of trouble one false step may give a man! What eternal vigilance must a man keep up, both upon himself and his charge, who has the government of boys! Now,. if I refuse to comply with your wishes, and by any chance in the world William should happen to get sick, you will ascribe it to my needless rigor, and carelessness about his health. I erred in giving him the horse, and I am not absolutely certain that after having given him, I ought to control his use of him, simply upon my apprehensions that it will e mischievous. Perhaps n evil will grow out of it for one short month, or a month and a half at farthest, for surely we shall have frost in that time, and by giving William proper precautions, it may 9   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         161 be that all will turn out well at last. You and William will be accom- modated, my doubts will be removed, (if they can be called dbubts) about' interfering with his right' of property in the present State of things, and possibly his health ma y le improved, or at least preserved ,by it. Cali him back and let me give him my charge."  William calme.  "I have concluded, son, to let you'keep your horse at Mr. Waddel's, upon these'conditions: You are to ride him no where but to the school house qnd back to your boarding house, except on Saturdays. On those days, you are to ride him to no grog shops, gatherings or frolics, nor more than six miles from Willington, anywhere, except to Vienna, and there, only to mail your own letters-don't forget this condition. You are never to go, to Vielna unless you go to mail a letter of &amp;your ouw, addressed, to your mother or mysefZ. All your 'letters to others, you must carry to the office when you go to mail your letters to one of us. You are not to go simply to enquire for letters-enquire for them when you go to mail your own. When you go under these restrictions, you may of course carry letters and bring letters for your school-mates-you are not to ride your horse at all on the Sabbath, except to accompany Mr. Waddel to some preach- ing appointment. You are to loan him to no student--I'll give you a paper to show them, that will excuse you to them for not loaning. your horse to them. When your mother sends for your horse, you are to give him up without a murmur, and if you keep him till Christmas, you are to bring him home and leave him here." William subscribed to the terms cheerfully, and showed by his countenance that he suffered no distress from his Uncle's over-refine- ment in trade. On the second of!September he and Tom took the road to Willington-Tom with saddle-bags which bent upwards with stuffing. On reaching W-illington, William, selected for his board- ing house one of the remotest from the school house that he could find, with any students in it. It contained two pretty wild fellows. A single day here convinced him tlat he had made a great change for the better,' in boarding houses. The eating was better, the sleep- ing was better, than at Newhy's, and here he understood he would not have to cut his own wood and make his own fires. "Why didn't I come here' at first?" thought he. "Smith," said he, "does Mr. Waddel ever come round here of nights?" "No," said Smith, "it's too far off for him to gome'boguing about to, of nights; and if he was to come one time, he wouldn't come againj for I'd make him smell -the face of a brick-bat."

As there were no brick-bats about Willington, We infer from this remark that Smith was a city gentleman. "And you've no Monitor here?" enquired William. "No ;" said Jones, "Old Moses is got more sense than to make Smith monitor over me. or me over him. He knows we'd never spunk one another."' Wiliiam was in transports with his new location. His appearance at school on horseback, created quite a sensation among the students; divers of whom got spunked " for looking at William Mitten's horse in study hours "-in short for being idle, but in detail as just stated. As Doctor Waddel was about mounting old Hector, at 12 o'clock on the second day after William's return, he saw William riding Snap- dragon, to water, and he joined him.  'William," said the Doctor. "have you quit boarding at Mr. Newhy's?"  "Yes sir." "tul sorry to hear that. Did Mr. or iMrs. Newhy say or do any- thing'to offend you?"  "( No sir, but Uncle allows me to board where I please, and I pre- ferred,boarding at Mr. -- 's." "Is that your horse?" "Yes sir." The Doctor cleared his throat sadly and prophetically, and pro- ceeded:  That horse, William, is going to bring yo/into trouble, and I advise you to write to your mother immediately to send for him and take him away; and I advise you to get back to Mr. Newhy's as soon as possible." "I don't expect to keep him long Mr. Waddel-only till the weather turns cool."  "That may be quite too long. William I have been keeping school many years, and I declare to you, my son, that no student under me has ever done anything to fill me with such fears, anxieties and griefs as you have, in these seemingly small matters of changing your boarding house, and keeping a horse here. What day of the month is this? The fifth, isn't it?" "Yes sir.' ' "Is your name upon either of these beech-trees, William?" Yes sir." Come show me which." "There it is,' said William as they approached a beech.   u .JL12JJJ. W .Ll1JUALsLJ L dlll IJCi',. 1t J6 "Very prettily carved. Do you keep a pocket book, William?" "Yes sir." "Write down in your pocket-book the year and the day of the month, in which you and 'I took our first and last look together at your name on that beech.'. 'Why, Mr. WFaddel, I haven't done anything wrong, have I?" "Nothing morally wrong my son, nothing, morally wrong. I have a deep interest in you William, and so has your country. Hund- reds will regret to be disappointed in you. Lay t- heart the advice I am about to give, and follow it as you respect me, as you love'your Uncle, as you love yourself, as you love your mother, as you love your country. Till you send home that horse, be more studious than you have ever been, more striCt in observiig the rules of the school, more watchful of what you say and do, more careful of where you go, than you have ever been. And as soon as you dispose of the horse, come back to Mr. Newhy'---Mr.    s is too far for you to walk." "I've paid my board for a quarter." "No matter for that. Get back to Newhy's as soon as you can, and I'lf arrange the matter of board with Mr.  "Mr.- Waddel, X. Jones and Z. Smith board at Mr. -'s" "I know they do, but-they keep no horse.

"What," thought he, "can there be in keeping a horse, that is so horrible to Uncle and Mr. Waddel! It's the strangest thing in the world! '"  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7117-00000083"/> t  CHAPTER XIX. IT was a common remark of Doctor Waddel, "show me a school boy with a horse, dog, and gun, and I'll show you- a boy who will never come to anything." We can look back through the vista of fifty yea s, and w cannot point to the man, living or dead, whose his- tory disproves tlf remark. We .can point to many in verification of it. But Master Mitten had as yet only a horse, and at worst accord- ing to Waddel, he was only one-third of the way to nothing. Why, then, was the Doctor so much afflictedby his horse? And why, did it distress him so much more to find Willia'm boarding at Mr. --'s, than Smith and Jones? He saw at once that William had changed his lodging only for the pleasure of riding his horse every day. That his horse would ne- cessarily employ much of his time, that might be much better dis- posed of, and be constantly engaging him in pleasure rides, or vice- rides, when he ought to be at his books. He felt almost certain that ere long that horse would bring him on the monitor's bill, and he disliked exceedingly to give a promising boy his first whipping; because he'knew that half the stiwtulus to close study and good order would be taken from him by his first whipping. But the great source of the Doctor's uneasiness was his room-mates. Jones and Smith were among the few students of the Ddotor's school, who disliked him, and they cordially despised him. And yet, strange as it may seem, he had never flogged either of them, he had never said a cress word to either of them. 'They feared whipping, and demeaned them- selves well enough when at school, to keep off the monitor's bills, and recited well enough to drag along with their classes. "Why, then, did they despise him?" The reader must ask the Devil to explain that matter. We ac- knowledge our utter incomp tency to do it. Yes, we can go a little way into the explanation of it, and as it is. one of the paradoxes of human nature, the philosophic reader is entitled to all the light that we can shed upon it. If it were possible we should say that Smith came into the world hating Doctor Waddel; for he seemed to bring his hatred with him to the school. At their very first inter- view, he showed palpable signs of it, already up to a red heat. Now if it be possible for a rational being to hate furiously at sight, then Smith's hatred commenced with this interview. But if this be mor- '                            i 0   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         165 ally impossible, at what period of his life can we better place it than at his birth?. As to Jones, his hatred, though curious, and smoked a little with the unnatural, is nevertheless traceable. From his introduction to the Doctor, to the. day of his becoming Smith's room-mate, he seemed rather to like the Doctor; but on the evening of that day, the most wonderful transition of feeling 4ok lace in him, that per- haps ever occurred in the history of mind. -As the two took their seats, at their study-table, Jones observed, 0( Old Moses is a pretty tight old fellow, but I can't help liking him." "He's a d--nd  old tyrant!" said Smith. Whereupon Jones' countenance made proclamation of the workings of hism nind in this unmistakable lan- guag :--,-Why,-- La me! I never thought of that! ' But it's so! I Rsee it plain enough w! What an escape I have made! A little more, and I might have been precipitated into the bottomless alyss of love!" Jones covered his ignorance and weakness in thdusual way, by pretending he was in fufi, and to prove it, fell to cursing the Doctor luxuriously. -The: most of their recreation hours of eve- nings, were spent in' brotherly contests for supremacy in hating and abusing their excellent preceptor. Let no man saythat such cases never occurred. They are to be found in every school of a hundred boys in the land-not exactly, to be sure, in the features which we have given to them, but exactly in substance. Ye protestors agaiinst the doctrine of native depravit explain this matter, if you please. Doctor Waddel knew weilthe feelings of these youths towards him, and their worthlessness of character; and he was pleased that they had selected a residence' which cut them off almost entirely from communication with the other students, save when they were under his eye. No wonder that he had most gloomy forebodings when he saw a youth of Williani's tender age, and bright promise, placed'in daily, and gightly intercourse with them. Young teachers may caution, a good, amiable, highly gifted boy, against associating with a low, vulgar, abandoned youth of his school, but an old one never does; for the plain reason that ninety-nine in the hundred good boys, instead of thanking the teacher for his kind- ness, holding his counsels in confidence, and improving them, will go right off to the profligate and tell him all that his teacher has sai about him, render him ten, times worse than he was beforein- furiate his parents, and spread the spirit of rebellion through the whole school, -Well for the kind man if .he ,dbs not get his head cracked by the father, his hbaracter eracked by ithe mother, and his L  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7117-00000084"/> 166 v      MASTER WILLIAM MrITTEN. chair cracked by his patrons or trustees. All this, kind reader, in answer to your question, "Why did not Dr. Waddel tell the boy frankly that Smith and Jones were unfit associates for him, and that they would ruin him, if he did not leave them immediately?"Doc- tor Waddel well knew "that there were things," not only "in heaven and earth," but in schools, " which never were dreamed of" in the world's " philosophy." 'We must not, however, take leave of Smith and Jones without doing hem the justice to. say, that there were two amiable, excellent, intelligent men, and as many women of like character, whose opinion of them differed toto colo from ours: these were their fathers and mothers. On the evening of the fifth,. William Mitten reported to Smith and Jones all that had passed between the Doctor and himself; wondering how the Doctor could be so much concerned' about hs horse and his boarding at Newhy's. "i; understand it," said Smith, with expletives, which we omit, "he and Newhy are in cahoot. He knows you're good pay; and another thing-he wants you there near him, where he can be pok- ing his grey eyes and club nose through the crack of your house, of nights, without much trouble. If ;I stayed there and he was to come peeping into my house, l'd take a sharp stick and punch out his old peepers. I was always taught to despise eaves-droppers, and' so I do." "Oh yes," said William, ' I see into it. -He thinks if he can get my horse awayfromn me, rather than walkl so far to school, I'll go back to Newhy's; but he misses. it. just as much as if he had burnt his shirt. I ain't going to quit thbe good eating here,*and the good sleeping and easy living and go back there, to eating and sleeping and working like a nigger, if my horse was gone." ' Bill," said Jones, ' did you ever play cards?" " yes," said Bill, " many;a timte."  I wish we had a pack," said Smith. "We burnt up ours, at the end of the term ; but if you'll lend me your horse Saturday, I'll go to Petersburg and get a packS." ' "Read that pap," said William. Smith read it.      . Well, how will your Uncle know that you lent him?" pursued Smith.           '  ' But I promised my Uncle solemnly to obey his orders about the horse, and I hate to violate my .word. It would distress my mother to death, if I was to do so, and she find it out."   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         167 "Well, are you going to use him Saturday?" said Jones. "If you ain't, I'll tell you how we can fix it elegantly; you just leave him in the stable, and I'll take him, without your lending him." "I thought I'd go, next Saturday and Sunday, with Mr. Waddel, if he goes, to Rocky River Church; I must go one time---" Here William's Words were drowned, by most obstreporous laughter from his companions. "But hear me, hear me!" continued Bill. "Let me explain! You see, Pjcle disliked my bringing my horse very'much; and after giving him all the reasons I could think of to let me bring him, I told him I would like sometimes to go with Mr. Waddel to Rocky River Church! When I said that, I saw something in Uncle's looks, which made me believe he thought I was telling a lie-" "And wh? the devil is your Uncle!" said Jones. "Do you be long to your Uncle?"  "Jones, you mustn't say anything against my Uncle-'he's one of the best men in'the world, and-" "Oh, go on Bill; I didn't mean to say anything against your Uncle.' "Well, as I was saying, I want to go with Doctor Waddel one time, and if I,can go before I write my first letter, and tell 'em of it when I write, it will convince Uncle I told the truth, please Mother, and make them very willing for me to keep my horse till Christmas. But if I don't, my Uncle, who watches everything like a hawk, will have a boy' here after my horse as soon as the weather turns cool." ".Oh, well," said Jones, " that's not 80 bad; but take care of old Mose, by the way, or he'll have you back to Newhy's Monday morn- ing, to a certainty." "But," said Smith, "suppose old Wad. does not preach at Rocky Rierp, what will you do with your horse Saturday and Sunday?" I shall ride him to Vienna, to mail a letter-" "Th-t'll do; 'when you get toVienna, go over to Petersburg, and buy a pack of cards." "But my orders are not to ride my horse further than Vienna, except to preaching." A' Well," said Smith, "you needn't ride over to Petersbur, you can gothere afoot.".  "Thatfs it," said Bill, snapping his fingers joyously. The evening passed off with but little study  William's class usually recited to one of the Assistants, but the g  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7117-00000085"/> JLO       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. next morning it was called before Doctor Waddel. The Doctor ar- ranged the order of recitation, so as to throw the last part of the lesson to -William. He had not been over it, and he bungled shamefully. "Why, William," said the Doctor, " hat's the. matter with you? I never knew iyou to recite so poor a lesson. I'm afraid you don't study at your new boarding house as well as you did at your old one." William was excessively mortified, and his classmates no less sur- prised. After the class retired, William enquired of Doctor Waddel, whether he preached at Rocky River, the next Sabbath. "No, my gon," said the Doctor, "but I preach thercthe Sabbath after. Why do you ask? Do you think of accomnpanying me?" "Yes, sir." {' I am very glad to hear that. Now you are going to make a good use of your horse. If you never make a worse use of him, you will do well." Saturday came4 and William, at an early hour after breakfast, was off to Vienna to hail a letter. As the lttter was written only to be mailed, it of course was not written in his usual diffuse, florid style; but what it lost in beauty, grace and polish, it gained in conciseness, nerve and point. Here it is: WIu1'N, Sep. 7. "Dear Mother ;-I just write for fear you will feel uneasy if you get no letter from me by this mail. Tom can tell you all about me. Delighted with my boarding house-Fare much better than New's. Health good-T1old. Mr. Wad'l I wished to go to preach'g with him, if he went to-day, but he don't go till next Sat'y-Best love to all. In hasteyour af'te son,     WM. I4." After mailing his letter, he. went over to Petersburg, and bought a pack of cards, a tickler of peach brandy, and a plug of tobacco. "My son," said the merchant as. he handed him the articles ' these are ugly things for such a youth as you arc to buy." "'Oh, I don't buy any of them for myself, I buy themn for Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones, who live about nine miles from here." T(e merchant knew William at sight as the youth who had dis- tinguished himself so much at the exhibition, and he naturally felt pained to see a boy of his talents engaged in such a dangerous traf- fic. Hence his remark, which produced from- William one lie and   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         169 two truths, in consolidated form. He bought the cards for himself, the brandy for Smith, and the tobacco for Jones. He returned immediately to his residence, and spent the afternoon and till twelve at night, playing cards and drinking peach brandy. The next day he was sick. On Monday he went to school, was called again to recite to. Doctor Waddel, and knew nothing of his lesson. It was rarely the case that the Doctor called one of the lower classes to recite to him two mornings in succession. "What," said he to William, "with allSaturday, and all Monday morning to get your lesson in, come up here and know nothing about it, sir! You don't study, sir!" The Doctor enquired ofMr. Dobbins how Smith and Jones recited that morning. "They didn't recite at all," responded Dobbins, "Smith said he had been sick from Friday evening till Monday morning, and Jones came up with his jaw tied up in a handkerchief and took on as if he was raving distracted with the tooth-ache. He disturbed the class so that I excused him from attending recita- tion." Tuesday they all appeared at school, as well prepared for recitation as usual, but the Doctor heard none of them. On Wednesday they were not noticed until after prayer in the evening. This service over, he hauled a tickler out of his pocket, and said: "William Mitten come forward "' William just 'had strength to step forward, and that was all. "Do you know this tickler, sir '" "Ye-e-s, sir!" "Whose is it?"' '* It's Smith's, sir." "You took it to Petersburg last Saturday,. didn't you, sir; and got it filled with peach brandy 7" "Yes, sir." "Who did you get it for?" "Smith, sir.",' "Whose pack of cards is this?" asked the Doctor, drawing a pack from his pocket." Bill did not require an inspection of it, to give'the answer: "It's mine, sir." "You and Jones and Smith sat up late on Saturday nightU play- ing cards and drinking peach brandy, didn't you?"  "We-I-Jo-I did, sir."  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7117-00000086"/> "You did, sir. Did you play cards by yourself till late at night? -and drink all Smith's brandy yourself?" "No sir; they drank some." "And did they sit by and help-yon drink, while you played cards by yourself?" "No, sir; they played too-- some.' "Perhaps you may think that I got my information of your deal- ings at Petersburg, from the merchant who sold you the cards, brandy, and a plug of tobacco. I have not'seen him, and no man in Peters- burg or Vienna told me a syllable about it. Alexander B. Linton, bring me six tough hickories in the morning, suited to the occasion. In the language of Rob Roper's composition, 'the apple of discord has been cast in among us, and if not speedily snipt in the bud, it will inevitably explode and shroud us in the pitchy night of anarchy and confusion, and deluge the country with fire and sword.' As that apple is a3 dangerous to schools as it is to the country, I'll try to nip it in the bud effectually, in the morning. You are dismissed." As for Jones and Smith, nobody cared for' them, but the whole school sympathized with William. They laid all his faults to them, (rather more than was due to them by the way,) and rejoiced at the retribution that Was in reserve for them. Gilbert Hay accompanied him for about a quarter of a mile on his'way to his lodgings. To this point they walked hand in hand. William leading his horse, and both weeping bitterly. Here they stopped, and William broke silence: "Gilbert," said he, "nothing. gave me so much pain in leaving Mr. Newhy's as parting with you. How happy we were in talking together, working together, playing together, and studying together! I'd give ten thousand millions of dollars if I hadn't lIft you---" "Will, come back now." "It's too late now-I'm disgraced, I'm ruined-I wish that my horse and Jones and Smith were all tumbled together in the flames of Hell!---Stop Gilbert; don't leave me "' "I will leave you, William, if you talk in that way; and, much as I love you, I must drop your acquaintance, if you use such lan- guage.' "Forgive me, Gilbert, I hardly know what I say. You have no idea what I suffer"--  "Why, it's no killing matter, to get whipped by Mkr. Wad-" Whipped! I don't .mind the whipping at all, severe as I know it will be. If cutting my legs to the bone would just put me back   MASTER WIIIAAM M,1TTEIN.

"Then what is it that distresses you so?-Youare not thefitst boy that Mr. Waddel has ee-r caught playing caids and drinking liquor, I know."' "If I should tell you, you never would own me as a friend or ac- quaintance again."  "Well, it can't be worse than I'll think it is, if you don't tell me."     , "In less than one short fortnight, I hare deceived the best of mothers, the best of uncles; forsaken you; the best of friends; de- spised the advise of the best of teachers; drank, gambled and lied- disgraced myself in my class, as you know, and disgraced myself in the eyes of all who applauded me at the examination and exhibition.

By the dim twilight be read: "My Dearest Boy : Two days after you left us, your Uncle was attacked with bilious fever. The attack is very severe, but we hope- not fatal. Last evening he begged that you might be sent for. Come as quick as you can, in mercy to your horse.

What does that mean, William.?" "He knows--he will tell -you. Farewell, my dearest, best class- mate!"  . Gilbert went immediately with. the letter to Doctor Waddel,-and delivered it with Williatm's message. The Doctor listened, read, and walked the floor in great agitation' of mind. After a few strides back- wards and forwards, he spoke: It is awful, awful to think of such a star as that being eclipsed just at itsrising! A breath may change the destiny of a youth for. time and eternity. If ever there was a 'boy *  .-          '!  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7117-00000087"/> 172       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN., of more brilliant promise than William Mitten, three months ago, I don't think I ever saw him. And where is he now!, Why is it that in the contact of virtue and vice, vice always gets the advantage--at least with the young?" "Mr. Waddel, what did William mean by the beech .2" "I'll take you to it and explain, to-morrow at twelve; but I little dreamed that the catastrophe was so near at hand.! At a proper time, I will write to his uncle,-or mother, to send him back. His heart's in the right place still, and he may yet be the pride of his mother, the boast of his teacher, and the glory of his country."' "If you write, Mr. Waddel, tell him I love him yet; and that the front side of my bed is w-titing for him yet." William wended his way to his boarding house, slowly and sadly. On reaching it, he went in and informed the landlord of the distress- ing tidings from home, and that he-wouid leave at the dawn in the morning. He refused supper, and walked towards the study, near the Steps of which Smith and Jones were standing. "Well," said Smith, " you've stayed so long we thought you'd run away. You've got us into a hell of a crapc, and you may well look sheepish." "Smith, that boy has just come for me- my Uncle's at the point of death  "  You're d--nd lucky, to have a sick Uncle just at this time." The words were hardly out of his mouth, before the onset of Wil- liam's fight with Black was renewed precisely; but not with pre- oisely the same results. In his fall, Smith's had struck the cornier of a step, and he came senseless to the ground. Jones, supposing that he was only a little stunned by the fall, and that he would soon rally and give William a tremendons beating, (just what he desired) did not interpose. William supposed so too, (i. e., that he would soon rise,) and he resolved to improve the interim to the best advan- tage. Such language, at such a-time, front such a character, set his whole soul on- fire, .and inspired him with supernatural strength and inhumanity. He dealt blow after blow upon the face, neck and ribs of the unresisting Smith, with a force and rapidity that horrified Jones, and would have astonished any one. It was in vain that Jones cried out " for God's sake tte, Mi stop, ie's - dead!" If 4he isn't dead, I'll kill him," said Mitten. Rising fromn the body, he stamped Smith in the face with his heavy nail-pegged shoes, and was in the act of repeating the injury, whqn the landlord and Tom both seized him and forced him into the house. As they dragged him ,      ,             .   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         178 away, "Stop" said he, "let me give Jones a little, and then I'll 'be satisfied.:' He was given in charge of Tom, while the landlord and Jones'took care of Smith. His head was' ut' to the bone; and the wound was clogged up' with blood and dirt. His face was like noth- ing human. 'He was washed, undressed, and put to bed; but he did not recover his senses, though he breathed, andshis pulse 'be t. There was no physician within miles of the place, and the landlord did not suppose it necessary to send for one so far off, ,as he deemed it certain that' Smith would die or be out of danger before he could get there. In-a half hour's time William became cool, and surren- dered himself to grief again. A bed was prepared for him in the house; his trunk was brought in, he washed, changed his bloody clothes for clpan ones, packed such as hle needed' in the saddle-bags, sent Tom to attend to the horses, and threw himself on the bed to wait, in tears, the coming dawn. In the meantime, Jones and the landlord were at the bedside of Smith, in a state of the most intense' anxiety. The former was in the deepest agony: He and Smith had dgreed to run away from school the next morning, It was further arranged that Smith should give Mitten a sound dressing over-nigHt, because he had not managed his purchases in Petersburg with sufficient cunning; be- cause he had not extemporized lies according to his talents, under Waddel's examination; because" he had told the truth where he cutght to have told lies, and bungled even at the truth, and because "he wanted whipping anyhow."  There was a short debate between them as to which should have the pleasure of chastising William. Smith said that he was so much over Bill's size' and age, that it would look 'a little mean in him to do it. '"Now you,'Jones," continued Smith, ' are just about his weight, and you are but a little older than he is; if you would 'fan him out, there-would be some honor in itn ' "Oh, ' can whip him easy enough," said Jones, , and will do it if you inisist upon it, but he will be certain to biang up my face a little at the beginning of the fight, for you know he can throw me just as fast asI s can get up, and I hate to go home with my face scratched anbud buedup. "It will be hard enough for me to make peace with old Johl (his father) anyhow. -But you can tie hibm-- you can'flog'him without a scratch, and don't hurt him much. It would be mean in a boy of your size to hurt him much; just whip a little common sense inhim." The matter was 'arranged accordingly; but instead of Smith's '  '    &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7117-00000088"/> 174.       MASSTER WIUIAMM MrTEN. whipping a little common sense into Bill, behold Bill had,knocked a, great deal of?ery common sense out of Smith. To run away and leave Smith in his present condition was not to be thought of. To remain with. him until after prayers the next morning, would be certain to awaken Doctor Waddel's curiosity con- cerning the state of his health, as early as old Hector could bring him hither; and as his old prejudices had greatly strengthened that day, he had nq disposition to encounter him anywhere. From what had passed between him and Smith, there was a fair implication that if Smith did not whip'William, be would; and though Smith might not hold him responsible for the implied pledge, he would be very apt to hold him responsible for allowing William to beat him while he was in a' state of insensibility. William's retiring remark, too, made him feel very uncomfortable; for though he had done nothing to incur his wrath but sympathise with Smith in everything, and drop one disrespectful remark about .William's uncle, already atoned for, it was plain that William's mind was not in a condition. o allow the proper credits, in closing up his uncle's claims. He was very certain that William would sleep none 'that night, and" if he shodld conclude to come out aiittle before day and give him a parting bles- sing when all were asleep but the two, it would be-very, ill-timed, to say the least of it. So that, upon the whole, none of the house- hold spent a more uncomfortable night of' it than poor Jones did. To have got rid of the troubles of that single night, he would have been' perfectly willing to sign a written pledge to love "o'ld Moses ' all his life, elegantdly, and to accompany him to Rocky River Church monthly, during the term of his pupilage. Smith did not come fully to himself until about twelve' o'clock. When he recovered his mind, and saw with but onq eye-.(for he could not open the other, and one not fully,) Jones and the landlord keeping watch over him. his shirt all bloody, and found himself in pain all over, "Why, what's the matter with mce W muttered he from two hideously swollen lips.  "Never mind," said Jones, "lie still and be quiet till morning, and we'll tell you all about it." While Jones was talking, Smith was feeling his face and head. Why, how did I get in this fix?" enquired he, ti1'm1 in a dread- ful fix-,my back, hip, head and face all pain me awfully. Jones, tell me who treated me so. Have I been out of my head? What  o'clock is it?" "' Never mind, Smith-never mind," said Jones, "you'll soon be   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         175 over it if you'll be quiet. Lie still till morning, and we'll explain all things to your satisfaction." Didn't Mitten clinch me? Did he strike me with a stick? He couldn't-- " "Oh, go to sleep, go to sleep, Smith, and quit talking. A- 'd accident has happened to you. and you must be quiet, or there's no telling what'll come of it." "I don't recollect anything after he clinched me; but it's impossi- ble he could have hurt me so' bad. Is he gone?" , Yes," said Jones, "he's gone long ago--he didn't do it-it was an accident, I tell you, and you must be quiet, and not talk, or you may lose your life'." In this way Smith was quieted, dropped to sleep, and did not wake until an hour by sun the next morning, when William was ten miles on his way homeward. By ten o'clock Doctor Waddel was at Mr.   's. The wole matter was explained to him. He told Jones to stay with Smith, and nurse him until he was Able to walk to school. Jones did so; Jut instead of walking to school, they walked home-or rather walked to where they could get horses to ride home. It was the Doctor's habit to follow runaways and bring them back, but he Ivas too glad to get rid of these gentlemen to do so in this instance. William's purchase in Petersburg soon became the town talk, for almost everybody in town knew him as the bright boy of the exhi- bition, and everybody deplored the indications of ruin that his pur- chases gave. The talk soon spread from Petersburg to Willington) and from Willingtoi to Doctor Waddel's ears. He went immediate- ly to Mitten's room, where, he found the cards and tickler uncon- cealed, and surprised Mitten with them,- as we' have seen. Thus did he possess himself of the 'few facts, from which he drew out of Wil- liam all that the trio had done after the cards and brandy reached their room. He explained to young Hay, according to his promise, William's reference to the beech, the import of which William fully uuderstood after his disgrace. What a lamentable thing it is, that 'there is no way of inducing the young to follow the counsels of the old!   &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7117-00000089"/> CHAPTER XX. Captain Thompson breathed his last but a few minutes before Wil- liam reached his habitation. We need hardly say that he died hap- pily-he died triumphantly-not shouting, simply because in his last moments, he had not strength to shout, but whispering "Glory, Glory, Glory!" William's entry into the death-chamber, served but to embitter the griefs of all who filled it. A little while before Captain Thomp- son expired, he said, "I have been looking anxiously for William- I wished to give him my last counsels, as I have given themi to the older children, [his own and his sister's] but it is now too late. Tell him, Anna, my last words to him were, ' Loe, honor, cherish and obey your mother.' " These sentences were uttered amidst rests at every three or four words.  Deep and all-prevailing as was the grief around the death-bed of the uncle, the entry of the nepliew startled every one, and nearly overpowered his mother. Anguish of mind, loss of sleep, absti- nence from food, and fatigue from travel, had wrought the greatest change in his appearance, that perhaps ever had been wrought in a youth of his age, unvisitedLy disease. He walked, or rather tot- tered to the corpse, kissed its cold lips, covered his face with his hands, shrieked, and sunk to the floor. The Doctor who had not yet left the'room, raised him up, advised that he be removed from the scene of grief to a bed in another apartment, and he assisted in effecting what he advised. He returned and reported to Mrs. Mit- ten that William needed medical aid, for that "he was quite unwell." She hastened to his bed side with thephysician, and found him in a high fever. He was prescribed for, and carried home as soon as possible. Her forebodings of some great calamity had been realized in the death of her brother; but she now believed that her son would soon follow him; and her agony of soul can be better con- ceived than described. Still she bore her afflictions like a christian; with no other demonstrations of grief than streaming eyes, deep- drawn sigh., and saddened countenance. A few weeks before Captain Thompson's death, he and five or six other gentlemen of the village had, upon M3r. Markham's suggestion, agreed to furnish the means for giving John Brown a collegiate edu- cation. Mr. Markham, after having taught John gratuitously from the day that he acquitted himself so creditably at the exhibition, set '   MASTER WILLIAM. MTTIrN.        1" on foot this benevolent enterprise, and was himself the, largest con- tributor to it. How this excellent man came to enlist so warmly and efficiently in John's favor. is worthy of record. A short vaea- tion followed the exhibition, and at the opening of the term John was missing from school. At twelve o'clock, Mr. Markham went to his mother's to learn the cause of his absence. He found John seat- ed on the door-step, weeping bitterly. "Well, John," said he, "what's the matter, son?"  e ' Mammy says she can't send me to school any more." "Why, that's bad; but I reckon you wouldn't study much, if she was to bend you again."  "Yes, sir, I would; I'd study harder than ever I did in all my life. You should never have to whip, me again, as long as you live." "Why, that would be a wonderful improvement, John, for I've generally had to whip you at least twice a week, ever since you first came to me." "I know that, sir, because I didn't care about going to school at first; but now I want to go to school; and if I could go back, you'd never have to whip me again, I know you wouldn't." By this time, Mrs. Brown was at the door.  i"Walk in, Mr. Markham!" said she, ' I never did see a boy take on so about going to school, as John has all the morning, in at my born days. 'Twas much as I could do to get him off to school be- fore; but now he takes on 'at sitch a rate to go to school, that I can't help feeling nn'trally right sorry for him." - Well, why won't you let him go, Mrs. Brown?" "Well, Mr. Markham, ra'lly the truth is, I an't able to pay his schoolin'. You know mighty well what my husband it, and therefore 'taint worthwhile to be mealy-mouthed about it; he jist na'tially drinks up, e'en about every little that I can rake: together, that he can lay his hands on. He's a good hearted, clever, hard-working man, when he's sober;- but he's all the time drunk -- 'tan't worth while for'ine to be tryin' to hide it from you, Mr. Markham; 'every body knows it. 'Cept the time Judge Yearly put him 'in jail for gwine into court drunk as a jurior, he's hardly drawn one sober breath since, and you know, Mr. Markham, it's mighty hard for one ,poor lone woman like me to get along with three little children, and a drunken husband besides. Seems to me sometimes that I should na'trally jist give, up. And I b'lieve H--Oh yes, I know Iwould- ha' give up long ago, if it hadn't been for your wife, and, five or six other good ladies in town, who've holp me mightily. But after all I  I  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7117-00000090"/> 178       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. could do, I couldn't do more than jist rake up money enough to pay for what little schoolin' I could give him, sidMe he's been to you. I think Johnny would take larning mighty well if he had a chance. You know he did mighty well at your-at your-show. People took on mightily at Johnny's doins' that day, and I wish he could have a chance to git more larning, but I an't able to give it to him-it's a fact--I an't able to do it, Mr. Markham, and I may as well 4ist tell the plain, naked truth about it." "Well, Mrs. Brow', your's is really a right hard case. How long could you spare John to go to school, if it cost you nothing to' send him?" "Oh, la messy; that would be the onliest thing in the world for Johnny. I'd be mighty willin' for him to stay till he gets clean through for my part, and be glad of it. It would be a mighty great thing if Johnny could git larnin' enough to keep a school himself, now wouldn't it, Mr. Markham? You must make a heap o' money at it, havin' so many scholars as you always have, and gittin' your money every quarter"  ' But if I take John to teach him, won't your husband take him away from me before he gets through?" "O,' la, no! Be has nothin' to do with the children, no how, poor drunken creater! Besides, he shouldn't do it." "But- how would you prevent him!" "I could prevent him easy enough. Do you think I'd let him, who don't do a hand's stirrin' towards feedin' and clothin' my child- ren, take one of them away from gettin' larnin' for nothin'? No, -sir, he'd no more dare to do it than he'd put his hand in the fire.'. "Well, Mrs. Brown, if you'll promise me that youwon't take John 'away till he gets through, and that your husband shall not, I'll take Joohn, and if he will behave himself, I'll" make him a great scholar- :able to keep any sort of a school. I'll furnish allhJis' books for him, -and teach him, and it shan't cost you a cent."  i' Yes, that I do promise for both-- Behave himself! If he don't, I reckon you know how to make him ; and if 4olu can't, jest send him home to me, and I'll give him such a cawhallopin', that I'll be 'bound he'll never misbehave again while his head's hot, to a man that's done so much for him." "Well, send him over to school in the morning, and we'll see what -we can do for him."  While this eonversation was in progress, John's eyes expanded -from a couple of cracks to a couple of pretty respectable key holes,   MASttER WILLIAM MTTEN.         179 and, at the conclusion of it, he commenced patting his foot 'id snapping his fingers in unspeakable delight. As Mr. Markham was retiring, "Stop' a little, Mr. Marlham," said Mrs. Brown. He stopped.  "Where's your manners, sir," continued she to John. "Make a ,bow to Mri' Markham, and thank him for what he's gwine to do for you '" John gave Mr. Markham a bow of his own teaching, excellent for the stage, but quite too formal for the signal ofprivate thanksgiv- ing, under Mrs. Brown's dictation. He delivered himself, however, in-his own language: "Mr. Markham, I'm very much obleeged --" "Obliged, John." Mrs. B. "What, have you been gwine to school all this time and don't know how to call words yet!"  Mr. M.  John's is a very common mistake."   John, conceiving that his bow and his thanks had got too far apart, repeated his bow as before, and commenced again: "Mr. Markham, I'm very much obliged to you for your goodness. I always said you was---" "Were, John."  "I always said you were the best man I ever seen.' "Saw, John-" Mrs. B. "Why, that boy don't know no better how to talk than me, who han't had no schoolin' at all." "Well, never mind, never mind, Jbhn," said Mr. Markham, fear- ing John would go back to his bow and begin again. ' Your heart's right, my boy, and'I'll soon set your tongue right. Mrq Brown, you're going to see John a biMg man somne of these days." So saying, he retired in haste-in haiste for two reasons: the one, was, that. he might relieve himself from the laughter witht which he had been filling up-from the beginning to the end of the interview; and the other was, to disembarrass John, who, between his corrections, and' his mother's comments,was likely to become inextricably bewildered. John was the first boy at school the next morning; and thence- forward Mr, Markhart never had cause to correct him, or even to re- prove him, He soon became one of the best scholars in':the school, distinguished himself at every examination and exhibition, and in a short time became such a popular favorite that when Mr. iarkhhamR proposed to the citizens to unite in raising a fund to give him a,libe- ral education, he. had not the least aifficuity in Anding the requisite number of contributors.  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7117-00000091"/> 180       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. *Just before Captain Thompson's last sickness, the arrangement had been made for David Thompson, George Markham 'and John Brown, to leave for Princeton Gollege, N. J., on the 10th of the ensuing November. Princeton was, at that time, in the Soutl at least, the most renowned College in the Union. Captain Thompson appointed Mr. Markham one of the executors of his will, and authorized him to appropriate any sum out of his estate that he might deem neces- sary, to the education of John Brown, not exceeding one hundred dollars per annum. He also appointed Mr. Markham testamentary guardian of his two sons, David and George, until the complgtion of  their education; directing that " in all matters touching the edtica- tion of his two sons, should a difference of opinion arise between his wife [his other representative] and Mr. Markham, his judgment should be decisive." After an illness of two weeks, William Mitten recovered, and at the en4 of four, his health was entirely restored. About this time, his mother said to him: * "William, isn't it time for you to think of returning to Dr. Wad- del's?"  "Mother," said he, "I1 can never go back to Dr. Waddel's.", "( What!".exclaimed she, horror-stricken, "Oh, my dear, depart- ed brother! Is this affliction to be added to the thousand that thy death has cost me-?" * No, mother, if/uncle were alive, he never could induce me to re- turn to Dr. Waddel's. I feared him,-I loved him, I adored him, to the day of his death. If I could have saved his life by having my right arm chopped off, I would have done it freely; but uncle could never have induced me to go back to Willingtop."  "William, in mercv to me, tell me quickly, why?" "Because I have disgraced myself tthere."  "Disgracedyourselfthieree! Oh, how little we poor mprtals know what to pray for IL Would that you had died on the bed:fromn which you have just risen!-No, 'my heavenly Father, pardon me - .-In disgrace you were not fit to die; in disgrace you are not fit to live. William, let me know the worst--don't keep me a moment longer in suspense, if you have any respect for me-I may he able to survive the disclosure, if you make it immediately: I may not be able to survive it,. if you keep me a few days in this agony of suspense." e* ( I have lied, 1 have gambled, I have drank, and been detected in all, and exposed before the whole school--"' "Is that all?--i that the worst!" 4      , I MASTER' WILLIAM MTTE/N.        181 Yes, ma'am, that's the worst: and I don't know what could be worse.', "Bad enough-bad, indeed; bu't it might have been worse. I have nothing to say in defence of these sins; but how did you rush into them so speedily, after your return?" "That infern-, that abominable horse!" "How could he have involved you in this series of offences in so short a time?" William gave his mother a full and truthful account of all the dif- ficultiecs in which his horse had involved him. When he had con- cluded, she resumed:  "I was sure, that things had been going wrong with you, from the * brief letter'you wrote,'and which did not reach me until some days after your return. It bore the marks of great carelessness and want of feeling." "That letter was part of the deceit which I began to practiE on you and Uncle before I left here, and which Iwas carrying on, when I was detected by Mr. Waddel." "Well, William, .you have learned from short, but sad experience the consequences of vice; and now abandon it-forever. I am under inexpressible obligations to Mr. Waddel, for his vigilance in arrest, ing you in it, before it could become a habit ,with you. And, now, my advice to you is, to return to his school, do your first works over ,again, and retrieve your character, as you soon will, where you lost it." "No, mother, I cannot go back there; I'd rather die than do it." "tWell, what will you do, my son? What school will you go to?" "( i don't care about going into any school. If you are willing, I will go into a store as a clerk?"' "iMercy on me, William! Close up all your bright prospects-- bury your brilliant talents among goods and groceries! No, my son, I never can consent to that." "Why, ma; almost all the ;merchants in town began as clerks, and see how rich and respectable they are!" "But Providence has given you talents above this calling!" "My talents have done me very little good as yet, and I doubt whether they ever will do me any. What good will Latin and Greek do me? Nobody speaks Latin and Greek. I don't see any good in anything hardly, that we learn at school. I think I had better stay here with you, and take care of you, and be trying to get an honest living, than to be running off to school, where I will be constantly under temptations."     ^ M  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7117-00000092"/> -5.0      JBtAB1'l'K' .W 1L.'1lJ " i..' , MTT . "' Well, my son, there is a good deal of force in your remarks. It will cost a hard struggle to give up my fond hopes of your future distinction; but I can easily reconcile myself to your position in life as ;4,respectable, wealthy, private citizen. It will be a great comfort to have yof all the time with me. But let us think a while longer -before we decide upon this matter.' While it was hAld under advisement, Dootor Waddel's promised letter arrived. After tender expressions of condolence with. Mrs. Mitten and her brother's family in their recent bereavement, it con- tinued:   "But the main object of this letter is to offer your son encourage- ments to return to school: He left here under great depression of spirits, and under the impression that his character was irretrievably' lost. No one in this vicinity, in or out of the school, thinks so. Now , .  that the story of his misfortunes is fully understood, every one at- tributes them to a train of untoward circumstances which surround- ethim, on his return hither, rather than to depravity of heart. In- deed, le has some noble traits of character, which almost entirely conceal his faults from the eyes of the public and his school-fellows-r I say the pthc, for though it is a. very uncommon thing for the pub- lic to know or notice school-boy delinquencies, yet so wide-spread was William's reputation from his performances at our last Examina- tion and Exhibition, that every one who knows him takes an inter- est in him, and every one, 1 believe, regards him with more of sym- pathy than censure. All would rejoice, I doubt not, to hear of his return to the school, and his return to his good habits. Gilbert Hay, his room-mate and bed-fellow, bid&amp; me say that he loves. him yet, and that the half of his bed is still re erfved for him; and the feelings of Gilbert Hay towards him, I believe, are the feelings of nine-tenths of the school towards him. For myself;, 1 shall give hin a cordial welcome. But you will naturally ask, what will be my dealings, with him, if he return? I answer the question very frankly: I shall feel myself bound to correct him; though in so'doing I shall not forget the many circumstances of extenuation in his case. Had he been guilty of but one offence, and that of a veneal nature, I should freely forgive it, as is my custom, with the first offence. But he has been guilty of several offences, and th'ough none of them are very rare in schools, they are, nevertheless, such as I have never allowed to go unpunished in my school, and whih I could not allow to escape with impunity in this instance, without setting a dangerous prece- dent, as well as showiidg markedipartiality. I have reason to believe   , MASTER WIL-LIA4K; M TTXE .      183 that William would cheerfully submit to the punishment of,his faults, even though 'it were much severer than it will be, if that would restore him to his lost position; now, I can hardly conceive of anything better calculated to have that effect, than his volunteer- ing to take the punishment which he khnows awaits him on his re- turn, when he might perchance avoid it by abandoning'the school. But with or without the punishment, he has only, to be, for ten months, what he has been for nearly as many, to regain the confi- dence of everybody. Nothing but the peculiar circumstances of this case, and the very lively interest whieh I take in the destiny, of your highly-gifted son, -could have induced me to write a letter so liable to misconstruction,- as this is. But brief as is our acquaintance, I think you wili credit me, when I assure you, that my own pecuniary interest has had no more to do with it, than yours will have in delib- erating upon its contents. Verily, the loss or gain of a scholar is nothing to   Your sincere friend and ob't serv't, MOSES WADDEL. CHAPTER XX. So delighted was Mrs. Mitten with the first part of Dr. Waddel's letter, that she-rushed with it half read to ier son, and recommenced the reading for his edification and comfort. With the close of al- most every sentence, she would ejaculate, "Dear, good man!"  , "Haow kind!" "Such a man is a nationis blessig'!" ' Whoftan heD louvig him!" But'when she came to tlw whipping part, she was unable to read without comments, and with becoming compo- sure. Having finished the perusal, "Well," said she, "upon the whole, it is. a sweet letter; but I cannot see the necessity of his whipping a boy of your size a month after the offence is committed, and when he' himself admits that there are, so many circumstances of extenuation in the case. If everybody else is ready to forgive and forget, why might not he? But, William, as these are the only terms upon which you can get back and save your credit,.I think you had better go. I will write to' Mr. Waddel, informing him of your deep contrition, and begging him if he can possibly pass over the offence without correction, consistently with his sense of duty, to do so; but if not, then in the midst of justice, to remember mer- cy. Surely, under all the circumstances of the case, the. purposes of justice would be as fully answered by two or three stripes, as by--' ". Ttvo or three stripes ': said Bill, why,/he gives double that for simple idleness; and if. he were to let' me -oS with two or three  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7117-00000093"/> 184       MASTE1t WILLIAM MtTEN. tGripe, I'd bring home the marks of them next July. I'd rather take ten such as he commonly gives in the summer time, when the boys Wear thin breeches, than three such as he gave one boynamed Sapling, when he found his legs wrapped-up with strips of shirt. If I go back, and he lets'me off with less than ten peelers, or fifteen of the common sort, I shall think myself lucky." "Oh, William, you make Mr. Waddel a perfect enigma; how could a'man of his kindness of heart, be so inhuman!" "'He doesn't think it inhuman to whip students who violate his laws; but it is not worth ,while to talk about it, ma, for I'm not going back to Mr:.-Waddel's. As to the whipping, I shouldn't mind that, so very much, if I could believe that I would be put back to where I was before I committed the offences; but I know that that can never be." "Well, my son, I hardly know what to advise. You surely were born .under an unlucky star. Always, always there is something which obstructs'the way which seems best for you to pursue. * How unfortunate was it that your uncle gave you that horse! How much more unfortunate, that you did not accept his offer for him before your return to Willington! Oh! were he, now in life I would sur- render you to his goveirnment, and never have an opinion of my own upon it, during your minority. But in this singleinstance of giving you the-horse--and there he soon saw his error, and did all that he could do to correct it-his views have always proved right, while mine, however carefully taken, invariably turn out unfortunately." ( Well, ma, you may console yourself with this reflection, that if Uncle David were alivey he could not force me back to Mr. Wad- del's." "Yes, William, if he were live, and felt convinced that yotur fru- ture destiny hung upon it, you would have to go. He would have reasoned with you, he would have persuaded you, at first; but if he found these means unavailing, he would have carried you back to school at all hazards. But it is in vain to talk of supposed cases. I cannot do what he might have done. What say you, will you go back or not?" ' No, ma'am; never, never, never!"  "William, my feelings are against your going, but my convic- tions are. strong and pungent that you ought to go. Something whispers me that if you go, you .will be great; ifyou do not, you will be ruined. Will you submit to Mr. Mafrkham's 'advice in the. matter?" f  '   *        MASTER WILLIAM iITTEN.         185 "No, ma; I've;thought the matter all over, and I've made up my mind, coolly and deliberately, never to go back to Mr. Waddel's." Now the truth of the matter is, that thoigh Master Mitten, while suffering the first tortures of his exposed guilt,- and supposed dis. grace, would very readily have submitted to a severe whipping, to have regained his lost ground; as He became more familiar with his disgrace, it began to .set very easily on him, while the whipping as- sumed a new interest in his cogitations, and became more and more imposing, as the disgrace became less and less distressing: so that when the consultation occurred which we have just noticed, the whipping crowded clean out of Master Mitten's mind, ev6ry other consideration. It brought him, therefore, to a very decided judgment from which nothing could move him which lay within the range of his mother's devices. And yet there was a lady living within three hundred yards of Mrs. Mitten's house, a beneficiary of hers, who did not know A from a deer's track, who would have managed the case to perfection without the help of Mr. Markham. That woman was no other'than Mrs. Nancy Brown, mother of John Brown, sur- named Pactus, which is by interpretation, Pink-Elyed. We opine that if Mrs. Brown had been in the place of 'Mrs. Mitten, and Mas- ter John in the place of Master William, she would have given him the said John, such a " cawhalloping," that Dr. Waddel's best " fif- teen" would have been a Charlotte-russe to it. We have no doubt that John would have given his " cawhalloping" for the "fifteen," and made one of hisbest bows to Dr. Waddel, to boot, No alternative was now left to Mrs. Mitten but to procure a clerk- ship for William in some store of the villae. Two of the merchants, Mr,. Sanders and Mr. Dillon, had been enquiring for clerks, a little while before Mrs. Mitten took the rounds in ler son's behalf. She went first to Mr. Sanders. "Mr. Sanders," said shey" don't you wish to employ a clerk in your store?"  "Yes, madam," said Mr. Sanders, "very much indeed." Well, I would be very glad if you would take my son Wil- liam  "  ' "Your son William, NIrs. Mitten! why surely you are not going to take such a smart boy as that from school, to make a clerk of him!" "He has quit school----"  "Quit school!

"Dear,dear, dear.! How thoughtless boys are! Why, Mrs. Mit- ten, you oughtn't to allow him to quit school. That boy was cut out for a great man-yes, for a very great man---- "Well, Mr. Sanders, his talents will not be in the way of your em- ploying him, I hope.!' "Oh, no, ma'am, no! I prefer a pmart boy to a dull one, certainly; but it does look like such a sacrifice to put such a boy as that behind the counter.! If he's determined to quit school, he ought, by all means, to study law or physic." "He's too young for that." "Oh--al, yes. He's too young to go into any sort of business. A store, in such a place as this, is a very dangerous place for a youth of William's age. I never could forgive myself if I should take him into my store at his tender age, aid he should turn out badly-", "But he will be constantly under your eye and mine, Mr. San- dtrs." "Ah, there's the difficulty, Mrs. Mitten. He will not be constant- ly under my eye. I have long trips to make to the irorth twice a year-repeated trips to August, and Savannah. But, Mrs. Mitten, if you are disposed to risk it, such is my regard for you and your family-but lie is too young-entirely too young!" "Why, M-r. Sanders, he can't be younger than young Dally was when you-first took him; and he did well while he was with you, and went out of your store to preaching." "Very true, very true, Mrs. Mitten. But, young Daily was the son of a widow-  and-so is William; and thus far the cases are alike. But Mrs; Dally was a poor widow, with a number of sons, and you are a rich widow with but one son. It was a charity (somewhat) to take her son, but it would be no charity to take yours. -And, you see, moreover, besides, Mrs. Mitten, you would never be satisfied with the wages for AWilliam that I gave young Dally--- " i I don't care, Mr. Sanders, if you give him no wages at all--- "t Oh, bless my soul, Mrs. Mitten, that wotild never do! I couIn't think of taking your boy for -othing." "i Well just give him Iwhat you think proper. It is not for the pay  that I wish to put him under you, but siniply to acquaint himself with theanercantile business. I will board him and clothe him my- self and if you choose to give him anything, very well; it will go to him, and he won't care wlether it is much or little." "Ah, there you arc mistaken, Mrs. Mitten. William would never be satisfied to see other boys in town, not half as smart as he is, get--   MASTa  WILmIAM MTTEN.        .18T ting two or three timers, much -as he gets-and I shouldn't blame him at all. Besides, I can't think of fixing his wages myself. If I take him, it must be under contract with you, inrwhich his wages  must be settled to our mutual satisfaction.: William must have noth- ing to do with it. Now what would you be willing to take for. his services?" "Why, bless my soul, Alr. Sanders, I know nothing about such matters. I'm willing to take anything you choose to give."  X M'r. Sanders looked down, scratched his head, and said rather to himself, than to Mrs. Mitten: "How shall we fix this thing. - I dis- like very muchl that any obstacle should stand in the way of my get- ting -the services of such a brilliant youth as he is. But, stop, stop, stop. Does William understand Arithmetic pretty well? If he doesn't, you know it would be impossible -for me to employ him." "I presume he docs; he was consideecd very smart at figures by his teachers here.'*  "Well, if that's the ease, I reckio we shall be enabled to get along. Send him to-morrow morning, Mrs. 1titten, at nine o'clock precisely, and I will try hin a little at figures, and if he does well, why then, that will take away the only insuperable obstacle to employing him." Mrs. Mitten promised to send him over at the appointed time, and retired.  The Mr. Sanders of whom we lhave been speaking, was Mr. D. Sanders, who was doing business with his brother, Mr. B. Sanders, under the copartnership name of D. &amp; B. Sanders. The last, how- ever, ws little more than a dormant partner. The ,onversation just detailed was hardly ended before, it reached Mr. Dillon's ears, who, at precisely nine o'cloek the next morning, closed doors, and" ab)squatu-lted," as Billy .MuInford would say, alias vamoosed, alias was "tak!en wiith, a getting azwa,// William was prompt to Mr. Sanders' appointed hour.

Now I don't believe either of them had as Bbright talents as you have."  Just here Mr. B. Sanders, who was rarely seen about the store, rode up, dismounted, and walked into the counting room. "My mind is made up, Mr. Sanders," said William, "and if you will got employ me, I must seek a place elsewhere."'  "Well, if you are determined to go into a store-which store would you prefer?" "I prefer yours greatly to any store in town." "Well, however desirous I may be to employ you, you know your- self, my son, that I can't do it unless you understand figures pretty well." - "Of course not," said Willialm.  "Well, here take the slate and pencil, and let me try you a little. How much will five and a half yards of cloth come to, at five and a half dollars a yard?" The question was no sooner asked, than William answered it by his head without touching pencil to slate. Mr. Sanders took the slate, ciphered it up, found the answer correct,'rubbed out his calcu-. lation, and returned the slate to William, saying, "Very well done, my son; but that's head-work, and it won't do to keep merchants' accounts by the head; do it on the slate." William did it on the slate in'less time than Mr. Sanders did it. (' Very well. How much will eighteen pounds and three quarters of sugar comg to, at eighteen and three quarter cents a pound." William gave the answer promptly, not by his head, but according to Pike.

William soon presented the answer. It isn't right my son," 6aid Mr. Sanders. William reviewed it. "Yes, it is right, Mrr Sanders," said William. Sanders looked over it again and acknowledged his error. "Well, William," said Mr. Sanders, "I will put a few more ques- tions to you and then release you. How much will seven and a quarter yards of cloth come to at one pound, seven shillings and six- pence ha'penny sterling a yard?" William gave the answer correctly.  "Well, let me try you a little at interest." He put down upon the slate "$5674-" and handed it to William. "There/' said he,. "give me the interest on that sum for a month and a half, at eight per cent." William took the slate, placed a dot to the right of the first figure and handed it back, saying "there's the answer sir-six dollars, sixty-seven and a quarter cents." Mr. Satiders went over the sum in the common way, while Wil- liam stood chuckling. When he brought out the result just as William had it, he looked at him with perfect amazement. "Well, William," said he, "I believe you are the smartest boy at figures that' I ever saw in all my life."  Here Mr. B. Sanders,stepped in" ,' Why,.brother," -said lie, "have you turned school master?" ' "No," -aid Mr. D., "I was trying William on arithmetic, to see if he would answer for a clerk for us." "Why, I've engaged a clerk," said Mr. B. Sanders. "You have!" said Mr. D., "who is it?" "John Dally, brother oT our old clerk." "Why brother, there never was a Dally to compare with William Mitten at figures! I verily believe he is better than both of us put together. Couldn't you get off from your engagement with Mrs. Daily, so that we may employ William?" "'I suppose I could, if Iwere to ask'her to let me off, but that's not my way of dealing,"   . Well, William," said Mr. D. Sanders, "you'see how it is-we shall have to ,giver you up.

William went home and related all that had passed between him and Mr. D. Sanders. "Well, was there ever such an unlucky mortal born, William, as you are!" said Mrs. Mitten. "It seems almost supernatural." On Mr. Dillon's retu rn home, which was two days and a half after his " absquatulation," Mrs. Mitten waited on him to know if he would,not employ her son. But Mr. Dillon had just engaged a young man, who had been highly recommended to him., Mrs. Mitten now made application to every other merchant in town, but they were all supplied with clerks; they all spoke, how-  ever, in the highest terms of William's talents.. '"And what will you do now, my son," said she, "seeing your favorite plan is broken up?"   '      ^ ' I really don't know, mother; I am at the end' of my row." Mr. Markham, hea:ing of her disappointment, called upon Mrs. Mitten and proposed to her to let William go on with his cousin David, George Markham, anl John Brown, and fit himself for col- lege under Doctor Finley, a. celebrated teacher at Basken Ridge, New Jersey. "If," said Mr. Markham, "William will apply him- salf closely to the study of Greek and Mathematics, (the only studies in which he is deficient,) he will be able to enter the I4reshman class in six mouths with ease, I am certain." The proposition was readily embraced by both the mother and the son;. and while she commenced his outfit for the journey, he com- menced the study of Greek assiduously.  *l      .  OF   CHAPTER XXII. ABOUT nine days before the time appointed for Masters Thompoin, Markham, Brown and Mitten to leave for the North, Mr. Beach, a celebrated manufacturer of vehicles, in Newark, New Jersey, came to tlhe village on a collecting tour through the State of Georgia. He. was well known to Mir. B. Sanders, who suggested to him that the four youths just mentioned were about leaving for his tate, and that he would confer a very great favor on their parents, by taking charge of them, at least as far as his residence. Mr. Beach very cheerful-- ly and kindly offered to do so, provided they could delay their de- parture until the fifteenth of the month, and meet him at Augusta on that date. Mr. Sanders sent for Mr. Markham, introduced him to Mr. Beach, and the arrantement was made to suit the conveni- ence of.the latter. On the fourteenth, Mr. Markham was in Au- gusta with the iour youths, where  e e oaund ar. Beach ready to take charge of thenl. They were placed nlder his care, and left with him for Jersey, via Savannah  the next morning.  On the evening before their departure, Mr. Malrkham addressed the four as follows: "I cannot part with you, my young friends; perhaps forever, witfi- out giving you the benefit of my experience and observation in . the way of counsel. Bear with me if I occasionally play the woman in delivering it, flor 1 speak from a heavy heart. Was ever man placed in preciselv the, reltion which I sustain to you all ! I can with truth say, that I never felt the delicacy and responsibilities of it, in all their force, until this moment. When I left college, I had no higher ambition than to be a good and a useful man; and I saw no better way of attaining these ends than by devoting myself to the instruction of yutlh. I determined to engage in this vocation- greatly to the disappointment and mortification of my only surviving parent, who, mother-like, far over-estimated my gifts and attain- nlents, and regarded them  as certain passports to high political or judicial distinction, while in consoance with a miserably perverted public opinion of that day, (not yet entirely reformned,) she esteemed the calling of the 'School Master' as hardly respectable. I saw the importance of iti and the bitter fruits of this debasement of public opinion,. (that it was throwing the sacred business of instruction into the hands of the worst of characters) and I determined that, to the extent of my ability, I would elevate the character of the teacher  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7117-00000097"/> 192       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. and rectify the popular error. I opened my school at first in this place, and afterwards in the village. where I now reside. I soon ac- quired the confidence of the villagers-at least of all whose confi. dence was worth having. I appreciated it highly, and studied to retain and strengthen it by a faithful discharge of my duty as an in. Atructor, and the performance of good offices as a man. The conse- quence has been, that trust after trust has been devolved upon me through a long series of years. I accepted them simply on' the score of friendship, benevolence or humanity, thinking nothing of the responsibilities attached to them, until I found myself occupying the place of a parent to four youths of fair promise, of different means, tempers and dispositions, at the most critical period of life, on the eve of their departure from the parental roof, for two, three or more years. Verily, my position is an unenviable one; but it will be a source of future rejoicing to us all, if you choose to make :it such. That you may make it such, listen to the last counsels that I expect ever to give you; remembering that there are others much mnore deeply interested in your observance of them, (with but one eexception) than I am.    ,  ; Hitherto yma have had wiser heads to shape your course, to correct your errors, to check your wanderings, and to guard your morals, tthan your own. From to-morrow you must be thrown mainly upon your own resources, and that too amidst scenes of novelty, temptation and trial, to 'which you are entire strangers. Fortunately for me, and more fortunately for you if you will be advised, I am enabled to anticipate the more serious evils to Which you will be exposed during  your sojourn abroad, and to fortify'you against'them. Come safely through these, and your character will survive all others, though it may be smartly chafed by them. To these, however, I shall not con- fine my counsels, for my purpose is; not simply to save you from ruin, but to exalt you to honorable distinction . "I begin with your duty to Mr. Beach, who has laid us all under 'obligations to him which we can never repay. He has kindly ,promised to take you to his house upon reaching Newark, to retain you there for two days, until he cap dispose of a little pressing liusi- ness, then to accompany you to New York, and devote two more days to showing you the city'and as many of *ts curiosities 's can be seen in so short a time, and then to see you all to your' destina- tion. Now, whether we are indebted to his native goodness of heart for these unusual and unlooked-for kindnesses, or to his friendship for Mr, Sanders, they certainly demand your profoundest respect and t   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.          19 your warmest feelings of gratitude. Let him see that you are sensi- ble of them. In your intercourse with him bbe modest, but not bash- ful; easy, -but not forward; 'familiar, but not -pert; and at all times and under all circumstances, show him the most, marked deference and respect. When he speaks, give him your attention. Arrest always your conversation with each other, to hear what he has to say. Should he use an ungrammatical expression, or betray ignor- ance of any of the very few things which you know, you are net to evince by word, smile or interchange of look, that you notice or know of his defects. Anticipate his wishes, and relieve him of the burden of you as much as possible. Take care of your own t runks and of his, (if he will. allow you to do so) under his direction. Whatever opinions he may advance, you are not to object'to them; much less are you to debate-them with him. These rules should be observed in your intercourse with your elders generally, more es- pecially are they to be observed in your intercourse with a benefac- tor. "In thetourse of your travels, you will sooner or later be thrown in company with every variety of character; the grave, the scientific, the facetious, the ignorant, the profane, the vile. Be not forward in obtruding yourselves upon the notice of either class. A modest and diffident approach to 'men of rank and learning, you may make, with propriety and improvement; but take care to let them always lead in the conversation; and. as soon as they turn their attention from you to another, cease to be talkers, and become listeners. Let others entertain the wit, not you.' To the ignorant be charitable, 'not rude. Ignorance is no crime. Show no countenance to the vulgar and the profane. I do not say that it is your province to rebuke them; but it is your duty to yourselves to exhibit no signs of approbation to anything that falls from the lips of such characters. And do not suppose that you will gain credit for purity of heart, by simply ab- staining from vulgarity of lip yourselves. Let me see how you re- ceive it from the lips of others, and I will tell you exactly how far you differ from them 4in moral character. - Does it absorb your atten- tion? 'Does it excite a smile? Does it raise no blush upon your cheek? Does it receive from you an impulsive hint? You are no better at heart than the retailer of it. The only difference between you is, that you are a little more prudent than he is, in your choice of times and places of relieving your hearts from this moral fecu- lence. .  "( Do not allow yourselves to contract the habit of profane swearing. *.I  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7117-00000098"/> Aside from its sinfulness, it should be eschewed by every man, who desires to become fascinating in conversation, or renowned in elocu- tion. I never saw the very profane swearer, who was a very eloquent extemporaneous speaker.. The reason is plain: such an one, always accustomed to filling up his sentences 'with oaths, cannot command the appropriate terms to supply their places when they are rejected. "When you enter college, you will be presented with a copy of its laws . read them attentively, and resolve to obey them. Indeed, you will be required to sign a written pledge to do so. A word upon this pledge. It is called the matriculation pledge, and imports the formal admission of the student into tihe Institution. How it' Comes. to pass I know. not, but so it is, that not one. in twenty students regard this solemnly recorded vow as of any' force whatever., A large majority do not violate it-at least in any important particu- lars-but whether their conformity to it is from respect to it, or a proper sense of its obligations, is very questionable. It is certain, that in the four years in which I was in college, I never heard it ad- verted to as a ground of obedience to the rules of' the Institution. One day, a very grave, pious student said to a rather wild one, in my presence, 'How does it happen that so many students treat the matriculation pledge as a nullity?' 'Oh,' said the other, 'when I took the pledge, I understood it to mean that I would keep the law, or endure the penalty' (!) I see you all smile at this stupendous discovery in moral philosophy, and well you may. If every official oath, and every private promise were to be interpreted in this' way, no government could last a year, and every ligament that binds man to man would be severed in less time. Officers .ight do as they please, and 'endure the penalty ' Husbands might forsake their wives, and wives their husbands, and 'endure the penalty!' I might desert you here, and take your funds to myself and 'endure the penalty! Mr. Beach may desert you in Savannah or New York and 'endure the penalty!' But I forget myself-you see the ab- surdity of this doctrine as plainly as I do. If you mean to disre- gard your matriculation pledge, tell me so now, that I may save you from the sin of taking it. If you mean to keep it, all further coun- sels from me would seem unnecessary. Not, so, however: nine- tenths of those who take it, mean at the tine to keep it;' but from temptation, want of caution, or some other cause, they violate it; and then they think one violation as bad as a thousand, and become desperate, or quiet their'consciences with some such miserable ap- pliance as that to which we have just advertetd Now, this is all   JMAiTA'l'J1.ilS V'W 1JlAX ilXfll"I'J . L t/U wrong. One breach of duty can' never justify another; and there is almost as wide a difference, between a deliberate fault, and one ommiitted under severe temptation, as there is between innocence 'and guilt., If, therefore, you should be betrayed into a breach of your pledge, do not consider yourselves as released from 'it, but as instructively admonished to guard with quickened vigilance against the associations or train of events that led you into it. "But, my young friends, there is a condition attached to that pledge--an implied one, to be sure, but none the less obligatory on that account-which' Professors are apt to forget; but students, never: It is, that the members of the Faculty discharge their duties faithfully to the students. And here is the prolific source of many difficulties in Colleges. One duty of the Faculty students always see very clearly; and that is, that .every membei of the Faculty is bound to treat them with tenderness, courtesy and respect, and this duty they not only exact with unreasonable rigor; but treat a breach of it in the most unreasonable manner that hunan ingenuity could devise. They hold the Professor bound to this duty, no matter how they may treat him. This is bad enough, but their mqde of dealing with the offending Professor is ten thousand times worse. The injured party, instead of mildly'.and calmly laying his grievances before the Professor, and asking an explanation of him, which in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred would produce a reconciliation, spreads his grievances through the College. - His class (perhaps two or three classes,) espouse his cause; visit the. Professor with every species of insult and indignity, set all the laws of the Institution at defiance, rage like the Bacchantes of old, get themselves expelled by the dozen and suspended by the score, and then come .to order. "; There was but one row of this kind while I was ia College; and though I really sympathised with the student whose wrongs pro- duced it, I took no part in it, because I could not see what good end was to be accqnplished by, it. And had I not seen such things with my own eyes, I could not have believed it possible that any human being out of Bedlam could act in this way. I was blamed for my neutrality while the uproar was in progress, but never afterwards. Now, should either of you feel yourselves aggrieved by anything said or done by any member of the Faculty, aftei allowing cooling time for yourself and him, go to him and lay the grounds of your complaint before hip privately and temperately. If he does not give yousati^ faction, appeal in like manner to the Faculty., If they give you no redress," appeal to the Trustees; and if they give you no redress, $  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7117-00000099"/> 196        MASTER WILLIAM  MTTEN. appeal to me, and, if your cause be just, I will procure for you an honorable dismission, and remove you from the College. This course willbe much more creditable and profitable to you, than to tax the friendship of your fellow-students with your vindication, when it is impossible that they can ga'u anything by it, and certain that they will lose incalculably. All this upon the supposition that you are actually maltreated by a Professor without any fault ron your part-a case which hardly ever occurs. Take care that you do not construe the duty of a Professor into a JAult. The laws will show you what he is bound to do; and all that he does in obedience -to the laws, do you submit to without murmurs or complaint. It is no ground of objection to him that other Professors are more remias in the dis- charge of their duties than lie is. The comparison between him and them will be altogether in their favor while you are in College, but altogether in his when you come out of it, especially if you ever become the Trustee of a College. "The greatest danger to which you will be exposed, is from the shocking system of ethics which prevails in Colleges. It is admitted onwall hands, that a student should not become a voluuntaiy informer against his fellow-students, But even to this rule there ought to be some exceptions; and the exceptions should cover all cases where the information is given from a principle of benevolence to the students themselves, and there is no other means of securing the end in view but by information lodged with authorities of the Col- lege, or of the State. A student, for instance, knows of a contem- plated duel between two of his fellow-students; he, uses his best exertions to stop it, but fails; is he to be branded with the infamy of a common informer, because he puts the Faculty in possession of the fact? Surely not. A fortiori, where the intended crime would produce irreparable injury to a person, and subject thd student him- self to the pain of death, as murder, arson, treason, and the Jike. True, none of these criimes, but the first mentioned (the duel,) are likely to ever occur in a College. but should they occur, it is very doubtful whether the informer would find any quarter among his cellege companions. "But let as come to a case very likely to bccur. It is a rule in some Colleges, (in most of them, I believe,) that if a' student is charged with an offence, and another is called oh to testify in his case, and refuse, he shall be dismissed. Every student who enters the College pledges himself to keep this law; and yet, in the judg- ment of seven-tenths of the students, it is considered basely dis- k,   - MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         197 honorable to testify, if his testimony would prove the guilt of the accused! The culprit himself has not the magnanimity to confess his guilt, 'and save his innocent friends from punishment, but, shielded by this miserable abortion of College comity, he avoids de- tection, sees them disgraced, driven off and robbed of man's richest boon, (a liberal education,) while he quietly retains his place, and ultimately polckets his Parchment! 'fnd yet, black, rotten and foetid as he is, some of the unimplicated congratulate him on his escape, and many of them hold fellowship with him, not only with- out nausea, but with an agreeable relish! The dirty lump of hu- manity should be turned over to the scavenger, by the unanimous. verdict of the, College, and pitched into the remotest sewer from it. Now this case has actually happened, and it may happen again while you are in College. If so, and. you are cognizant of the offence, (not a participant in it,) and summoned as a witness against an of- fender, go to him and tell him to confess his fault, or you will be- come a witness against him. If thus forewarned, le refuses to con- fess, testify against him. His friendship is not worth having, nor is the friendship of a legion of students, who would cut your ac- quaintance for so doing. I know it is hard to bear the derision and contempt of your College companions; but bear that, or even mar- tyrdom, rather than forfeit your word, incur disgrace, be driven from the walks of science, and have your fairest prospects blighted, to favor a villain. "That students should suffer themselves to be punished, in order to conceal 'the guilt of an ,ffender too vile to own his guilt-that a rule should obtain among them, which makes it better to be a culprit than a witness, safer to sin than to see it, more honorable to profit by magnanimity than to practice it, and more graceful in the tnale- factor to divide his responsibilities among his friends than to bear: them himself-is marvelous indeed. But the wonders of College, 'ethics do not stop here. Another principle of the school is, that 'ano member of the fraternity is tolexculpate himnself from a crime esm- mitted by one of his fellows;. because, forsooth, if all who are inno- cent, avow their innocence, the guilty one must be discovered if lhe be a' man of truth! By the law of all Colleges, I believe, if a student stands mute when questioned as to his participation in an, offence, he is to' be regarded as the perpetrator of it, and to be visited i  accordingly. Students, innocentstudents, stand mute and endure the- penalty! 'They virtually acknowledge a fault, of which they are not, guilty.

Young men, you are not to forfeit the inestimable blessings of a lib- eral education, for any such refinementw as these. You are not. to encourage the idea that you are evil-doers, when you are not! You are not to lacerate your parents' feelings, to conciliate the blind votaries of a preposterous dogma!

How has it come toepass, that wrong receives more favor in schools and colleges than anywhere else? How hap- pens it, that every code of morals, human and divine, is reversed in these Institutions? It is amazing, it is unaccountable!

Have no fellowship with the idle, tha dissipated, the boisterous, the 'prodigal. Treat them politely, but distantly. These are the characters who breed all the mischiefs in College. From such as these must have sprung up those moral monstrosities of which I have been speaking. The best code of morals for them is, of course, that which indulges vice and repu- diates virtue. Take care of them; the Faculty will judge you by the company you keep; and if you would avoid the trying dilemmas of which I have spoken, keep away from the vicious and the lawless.

X  'i  CHAPTER XXIII. THREE days' staging placed Mr. Beach with his charge in Savan- nah, and an eight: days' voyage landed him in New York. He pro- ceeded immediately to Newark, whence he wrote a letter to Mr. Sanders, concluding as follows: ' Report our safe arrival all in good health, to Mr. 'Markham. He told me that the boys were raw, un. trayeled youths, whom he feared would give me much trouble; but I assure him that they gave me no trouble at all. So Or from it, they sought every opportunity to relieve me from treuble. They :seemed to contend for the pleasure of serving me. They are four of the most genteel, well-behaved, clever boys I ever saw. Instead of giving me trouble, they were a pleasure and delight to me all the way. As they were from the South; used to be waittd on, and not used to work, (as I supposed,) I did expect to find them all a little  lazy; but they were ieady to turn their hands to anything. 'On board ship they were,all very sick, and as they had all been so kind to me, I took great pleasure in waiting on them. In two or three days they were all well, and ever since have: been as hearty as bucks. They are now at my house, quite the delight of my family. To- morrow and next day I -shall take them over to see New York ac- cording to promise, and the day after go with them to Basken Ridge and Princeton;" '  . '  This letter of course went the rounds of the families most inter.  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7117-00000101"/> ested in it, and give unspeakable satisfaction whithersoever it went. Mr. Beach fulfilled his promise. MarkhAm, Thompson and Brown entered the Sophorore class without difficulty. It was exceedingly mortifyilgito William to find himself under the necessity of going through a preparatory course in order. to enter the Freshman class, when his old schoolmates were all honorably admitted into the next higher class; and he determined to make amends for lost time by assiduity in study. The weather and' the place favored his resolu- tion, at least for several months, for he was kept in-doors from the cold, and there were few, if any, dissolute youths at, Basken Ridge to tempt him to vice. His first fetter to his mother spoke in highest terms of Mr. Finleyand his "charming family ;" and the first letter of Mr. Finlcy to Mrs. Mitten was not less complimentary to William. At the end of five months, his teacher pronounced him fully pre- pared for the Freshmanclass, put in his hand a very flattering cer tificate, and dispatched hi olege. Instead of presenting his certificate to the President, and aking application for admission into the Freshman class, he beogitated a brilliant scheme, not al- together original, to be sure, but hig ly creditable to his ingenuity, whereby he was to get into the Sophomore class without the needful preparation for it. Thus thought our hero: 'If I apply for the Junior class, they will have too much respect for nmy feelings to put me away down in the Freshman class, if they can possibly avoid it. Even for the Junior class, they will, in all probability, examine me upon those studies which I have been over, and here I shall acquit myself so .handsomely, that they will readily compromise matters, and let me into the Sophomore class." Accordingly he reported himselt to the President with an air of great self-possession, as a candidate for the Junior class. The President, after gravely taking his dimensions with the eye, to the manifest terror of Master Mitten, said: "The Junior Class, now nore than half advanced! How far have you advanced in Latin and Greek?"William answered. "  In mathematics?" He answered again. "Have you studied Chemis- try, Astronomy, Natural and Moral Philosophy and Logic?" "No, sir!" "Under whom did you prepare for College?" ' "Mr. Waddel and Mr. Finley." "Mr. Waddel of South Carolina and Mr. Finley of Basken Ridge?" ' Yes, sir." ( We have four students nbw in- College, from Mr. Waddel's school, and ten from Mr. Finley's, 'all of whom entered without difficulty. Did either of your preceptors advise you to apply for the Junior class?" "No, sir, but I thought may be I could enter that class." Well, Master Mitten, Ithinki   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.    .     201 'may be' you can enter no class in College. I will give you a trial, however, for the Freshman class, if you can bring down your aspi- rations that low." "Well, sir," said William, ,with a spirit of ac- commodation truly commendable, 'I'll try for that olass." Here William's usual bad lhck attended him, for his ingenuity had ex- posed him to agonizing mortification, betrayed him into a falsehood, and, as he well knew; made the President's first impressions of him very unfavorable. He was examined, and admitted without diffiiult'y. ThePresi- dent was curious to learn what sort of an examination he stood, and enquired of the examining Professors. "Admnirable!" said they, una voce. The President smiled, but said nothing. William followed Mr. Markham's advice strictly through the Freshman year, and for four months of the Sophomore year, and the consequence was as usual; he stood at the head of the class. His letters to his mother were in the highest degree gratifying. He* spoke gratefully of Mr. Markham's last counsels to him, and prqm- ised to obey them to the letter; he expressed his admiration of the Faculty, particularly of those members of it who had charge of his class, in terms bordering'upon the extravagance of praise--rejoed that he had been defeated in his attempt to procure a clerkship ;ld. rejoiced still more that he now saw the error of his ways. and had radically reformed. One of his epistles he concltded 4n this lan- guage : "When I think, my dearest mother, of the trouble I have given you-how I abused your goodness, and disappointed your reasonable expectations, my conscience smites me, and my cheeks burn with blushes. How could I have been such an ingrate! How could I have sent'a pang to the m of te the bosom of the sweetest, the kides the tenderest, the holiest, the best of mothers! Well, the past is gqne, and with it my childish, boyish follies: they have all been for- given long ago, and no more are to be forgiven in future.' That I \ am to get the first honor in my class is conceded by all the class except four. These four were considered equal competitors for it until I entered the class, and they do not despair yet; but they had as well, for they equal me in nothing but Mathematics, and do no j excel me in that. The, funds that you allow me ($500 per annum)k are more than sufficient to meet all my college expenses, and allow me occasional pleasure rambles during the vacation. What I have written about my stand in College, you will of course understand as intended only for a mother's eye, "Your truly affectionate and grateful son, WM. MTTEN'." *                 %        *  .  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7117-00000102"/> 202        MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. William's report of himself was fully confirmed by his fellow- students of the village. He wrote al]o an affectionate letter to Doctor Waddel, thanking him for his many kindnesses, approving of ,all his dealings with him, and censuring himself for his rejection of his counsels, and -disobedience to his rules. Beforethis letter reached his old Preceptor, William's fame and pr cts in College had reached the school, where all considered themselves interested in his reputation, and all rejoiced. At his home the-rejoicing was more intense,'and all the merchants, ofthe place, and Mr. Sanders in particular, congratulated themselves that they had offered him no encouragement to become a merchant. There was one exception, to be sure, to the general rejoicing, in the person of old Stewey Anderson; and he only suspended his joy; for he offered ' to give his promissory note, payable twelve months 'after date, for double joy; if Bill Mitten held on that long." * Billy," said Stewey, " is a Belair colt ; he beats everything for a quarter, but he can't stand. a long run, I'm afraid; he's entered now for the four mile heats, and I think he'll break down about the second or third mile, sure."- There was something, too, that chilled the ardor of Dr. Hull's delight, though no one knew what .it 'was. ]t  that he partook of the general feeling-to some extent, was manifest; for he never took a chew of tobacco and grunted when William was praised.  Up to the close of the fourth month of h1aster Mitten's Sopho- more year, he had almost entirely neglected ir. Markham's advice touching his recreation hours; indeed, he hardly allowed himself any recreation hours: but occasional viits to a beautiful little Princeton lassie, by the name of Amanda Ward, reminded him forcibly of his missness in this particular, and he resolved forth- with to amend his ways. Miss Amanda was not pious, but she .was sprightly, witty and graceful;' and for' her age (for she had hardly entered her teens,") she was not wanting in intellectual culture. William's interest in her increased with every visit to her, and his "recreation hours." began to increase with his interest. The neces- sary consequenee was, that his study hou'rs became more arduous. Still he maintained his reputation and his place in his class, with only a hardly perceptible change, in the promptness and fluency with which he disposed of his recitations. Soon after his first visit to Miss Amanda, William's talents were made known to her, as well as his fortune, which was represented to be something under the square of what it really was. She was quite too young and too ro-   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN'.         203 mantic to have anything venal in her composition, and, as his hand- some person, brilliant talents and interesting conversation began to win upon her affections, she became touchingly pensive, By as much as she lost her vivacity, by so much did William's interest in 'her increase. He loved her before, ana now he sympathized with her deeply and tenderly. It was a floating sympathy, to be sure, seeking, like Noah's dove, a resting place and finding none; but it was none the less sincere on that account, and none the less appre- ciated by the lovely object over tdich it hovered, and diffused its grateful incense. Often from the gloom which overshadowed the dear Amanda, would she send forth. mellow twinklings, like those which sport upon the bosom of an evening cloud, and which would irradiate the countenance of her anxious friend for a moment; but he could not persuade her to reveal the cause of her depression, Under the combined force of love, sympathy, anxiety and sus- pense; William's spirits for ook him, he became sad and gloomy, and study became irksome to him. Late sittings with Miss Amanda, and then much later sittings to makie up the lost time, began to make inroads upon William's health, and all his fair prospects would probably have been blighted before the close of the term, had he not determined to act upon conjecture as to Miss Ward's anguish of mind. ' He judged, not. without good reason, that it proceeded from love to him, and that she was wasting away under the consuiiing passion, because she supposed that it was not reciprocated. He re- solved, therefore, with becoming frankness to unbosom himself to her and offer her his hand. Accordingly, at their next interview, he thus addressed her: "Miss Ward, you know that I am not blind to your despondency, and, by a thousand proofs, you know that I am not indifferent to it. Believe me, that my oft repeated enquiries into the cause of it were prompted by a purer and holier motive than mere idle curiosity.. No, Miss Ward, that heart which is not touched with' the griefs of the gentler sex, mast be insensible indeed; such an ond, I am sure was never reared in the genial clime of the sunny South. lie who could. obtrude a selfish curiosity into the hallowed sanctuary of woman's sorrows, never breathed the balaly zephyrs which waft the odors of the magnolia and' the orange. 'Twas sympathy, Miss Ward, which prompted my questions-an honest desire to share your griefs, if I could not relieve them. Your generous nature will appreciate my motives, and pardon one more question-the last, if answered nega- tively : Am I in any way, directly or indirectly, connected with your mental perturbations?"  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7117-00000103"/> 204       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. Torrents of tears from the eyes of the fair Almanda relieved her gallant suitor's suspense, while she struggles for utterance with her a irrepressible emotions. At length she spoke:  "Mister Mitten, your noble nature assures me that I may trust the dearest secret of my heart. to you, without fear that you will ever c betray the trust, under any changes of feeling, time or place. I frankly own that I am and have l6ng been most ardently attached to X you--I have sometimes thought-hoped-that our attachment was mutual. Yet, why did I hope it? when I knew that we never could  be united?" ' Knew that we could never be united, my dearest Amanda??"  "Never, never, never!" exclaimed Amanda, burying her face in her handkerchief, and sobbing. convulsively.  "Then I am doomed to wretchedness for life!" ejaculated Mister  Mitten. "Amanda, you are my first love----" And you are mine, William. My first, my last, my only love. When you return to the land of birds and of flowers, object, of my adoration, send back a thought to your poor, unfortunate, heart-broken Amanda!" "Amanda," said William, in tears, "you said you would entrust the dearest secret of your heart to me: tell me then what insuper- able olstacle there is to our union?" "I never violate my promise, dearest William, I am told that you are very, very rich; and never can I consent to marry a man with whom I cannot be upon an equality,-a man who must ever feel that he stooped to take his partner's hand; and who may suppose that the poor trash of earth, called -wealth, had some influence upon her choice. I should be the most miserable wretch upon earth, to dis- cover in the being I adore, anything going to show that he consider- ed me his inferior, or capable of loving him for anything but him- self." "These noble- sentiments,' responded Mister Mitten, "exalt you higher, if possible, in my estimation, than ever. Know, then, thou sweetest, purest, noblest of thy sex, that I am not rich-- -" ' Not rich! Don't trifle with my feelings, William!" "I assure you, upon the honor of a gentleman, that I am worth nothing. My mother owns a very pretty estate,' which, when divid- ed between her three children, will only give a comfortable living to each of them." "Oh, happiest moment of my life!" exclaimed Amanda. "Wil- liam, there is my hand, and with it a heart that idolizes you, ;if you choose to take them."             .   MASTERK WILLIAM MTTEN.         205 "I receive them," said William, " and exchange for tbhm a hand  and heart equally warm and unwavering."  Their vows were plighted, and they separated in ecstacies.  Fortunately for William this interview occurred on Friday night;  or it would have played the mischief with is next day's recitation.  The nest day William visited Miss Amanda to arrange for the nuptials; and howeverindiscreet and rash we may consider the en- gagempcnt, everybody must accord to them the highest prudence in   settling the preliminaries of the nuptials. The arrangement was that M;ster Mitten (so we must now call him,. as he is engaged to be married) should go on and complete his edu- cation, return to Georgia and spend two or three months with his family, then go to Litchfield, Connecticut, and attend Judge Reeves' Law Lectiyes for one year, revisit Georgia, get admitted to the bar  as soon as possible, return to Princeton, and consummate the marriage. Could old Parr himself, and a lady his equal in years, have ordered things more wisely ! As soon as matters were thus happily arranged, Mr. Mitten said': ' I have reflected a great deal, my Amanda, upon matrimonial en-  gagements, and I have brought my mind to the conclusion long ago,   that there is a radical error in regard to them, too common in the world. Let us reform it--at least as far as we can. I allude to the   secrecy with which such engagements are kept by the parties to them--"  Miss Amanda started--" Why, if the parties are sincere and  mean to be constant to each other, should they object to the world's knowing of their engagement?  Were it generally known how few matches would be broken off,! What man of honoi would pay his ad- dresses to a lady whom he knew to be pledged to another! What wo- man of honor would receive the addresses of a man whom she knew to be engaged  . For my part, I shall make no secret of our engage- ment, and then if any man dare to pay you particular attentions, I shall hold him personally responsible  " ' Oh, William, my dearest William, do not think, of such a thing ! Our engagement must not be breathed to a human being-not even to father, mother, sister or brother. If our parents knew of it, they  would certainly break it off if they could,%n the ground of our age-- Break it off! No, that can never be. Sooner will the moon cease to shed her placid beams upon the earth, sooner will'this heart cease to  beat, than your Amanda forget her vows, or humian power make,,her break them. But think of the troubles that may follow the disclosure!   &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7117-00000104"/> 206       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN    s Oh, William, I cannot bear a frown, I cannot bear even S cold look from my dear, sweet parents; and how would it rend my heart to see them frown on you or receive you distantly---" "And does Miss Ward suppose that her parents would object to our alliance?-" "No, no, William: I'm sure they will be delighted with it, at the proper time; but think how young we are! I have heard my fath- er say that the man who has grown daughters in Princeton occupies a very delicate position. To forbid them to receive the visits of stu-. dents, would be to forbid' them from receiving in the main, the very best society that they could have, and to violate the laws of hospitali- ty; but to encourage students in making love to their daughters, was injustice to the students, and treason to their distant parents. Now, if he knew that we were engaged, he would be almuost certain to send me away to some boarding school-and what pain would that give us! And suppose another should address me; does my Wil- liam think that there is'another iii this wide world who can make the least impressio: on his Amanda's heart? Can you doubt your Aman- da's constancy? Can you fear that anything on earth could chill her first, her only love, in a few short years? No, William, whether you remain true or false, never, pever, can I love another. The very thought startles me like an electric shock. The keenest pang I ever felt, was at hearing my mother say that my father was not her first love-I ought not to have mentioned it-I have never breathed it to another; but to you I may entrust it, for we are soon to be one From you I can conceal nothing. But what agony did the disclo- sure give me--you'll never mention it, William?" "Never, Amanda." I felt for days, weeks and months, as if I were an orphan. Oh, how my heart sympathized with my dear, sweet father! He knew it when he married mother. They live happily together. But it seems to me, the cruel, bitter thought must sometimes present itself, this. heart was once another's-this heart was not tlways niine,' and oh, what pain it must give! And what is married life, if there be anything in it to interrupt, even for a, moment, the constant stream of heavenly bliss which it promises to hearts united in the silken cords of pure, ecstatic, first-born love! There, William, you are en- trusted with every secret of my heart." Mr. Mitten was so charmed with Miss Amanda's sentiments, and enraptured with her eloquence, that he entirely forgot the text. He soon recovered it, however, and after thanking Miss Ward'for her confidence, and promising to keep it sacred, he said: e   MASTER WILLIAM   MTTEN.        207 "Under all the peculiar circumstances of the case, my Amanda,'I will consent to keep our engagement a secret,; but, as a'general rule, I think there should be no secrecy in such matters." Mr. Mitten's mind being-now disburdened, he resumed his studies with alacrity, and maintained his place to the close of the Sopho- more year. The vacation ensued, and the first five weeks of it Mr., Mitten devoted to Miss Amanda. He took her out almost daily on pleasure-rides, lavished presents upon her, of the most costly jewelry, books, engravings, and love-tokens innumerable; and strange to tell, Miss Amanda received them without rebuking this ill-advised waste of his humble patrimony. Nor was SMr. Mitten less attentive to the decoration of his own person, than of Miss Amanda's. He laid in a profusion of coats, vests, pants, gloves, stockings, boots, shoes,pumps and under garments, all at the highest prices, and in the most fash- ionable style. To his other purchases he added an elegant watch, chain, seals and key, and a handsome diamond lbreast pin. Many of these things were purchased upon a short credit, to be paid for as soon as he could get remittances from home. With all his accom- plishments there was one wanting to make him  perfect in- liss Amanda's eye, and that was, " the poetry of motion." Herein Miss Amanda excelled, and she urged him to put himself under Monsieur Coupee, to add this to his many graces. She said that she was very fond of cotillon parties. but that they had lost all interest to her since she learned that he did not dance. He took her advice. As "the poetry of motion," cotillon measure, consists entirely of analoests and dactyls, performed with alternate feet, Mr. Mitten soon mastered this accomplishment. Thus went off the first month and a quarter of the vacation. With all his expenditures he had taken care to reserve money enough, as he supposed, to spend a few days in Morristown, a week in Newark, and a week in New. York, without exhausting his funds. At the, commencement of his sixth week of the vacation, he set out for Morristown. Here lived a class-mate of his, who insisted upon his spending a week with him.. Mitten consented. A round of par- ties ensued, all of which he attended, and at all of which he played havoc with the hearts of the girls of Norristown. From his class- mate the report soon spread through the village, that he was the first scholar in his class, and immensely rich.' These things conspir- ing with his fine person, graceful manners, and agreeable conversa- * tion, made him:absolutely irresistible. Now there happened to be in Morristown at this time, a young lady from S6uth Carolina, of the *  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7117-00000105"/> 208       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. Bethlehem School, who was spending her vacation with a relative of the village, or rather making Morristown her headquarters for the 'vacation. Her name was Louisa Green, she was behind Miss Ward in nothing, and one hundred thousand dollars ahead of her in point b of fortune. Miss Green and Mr. Mitten being both from the South, , naturally formed a strong partiality for each other; of course it did not arnornt to love on William"s part, but it amounted to love palpably, on liouisa's part. Asshe was from the South; William felt himself bound to WIy her particular attentions. Accordingly he did all that he could to make her time pass agreeably.. during his stay in Morris- town. He could but observe the tokenseof her favor, and they awak- ened in him a tender compassion. She had appointed to visit a ; school-mate in Elizabethtown, five days after the time when he was to leave for NevtArk. He offered to wait and accompany her. This ( threw him five days longer on his friend's hospitality, than he con- tracted for, but he was welcome. She accepted his offer thankfully.1 They went-he was introduced to her young friend, who prevailed upon him to spend two or three days in Elizabethtown. He con-. sented-parties commenced on the second day after his arrival, and were kept up with but short intervals for nine days. The scenes of Morristown were renewed. He had set every day for the last six, for leaving Elizabethtown, but something or other always delayed his departure. The school-mates of Elizabethtown'planned a visit to  third, in New York, for a few days. Ao this jumped with William's plans exactly, and promiseg to make his visit to New York pleasura- E ble infinitely beyond his anticipations, he proposed to accompany the young ladies. They accepted his proposition with pleasure. It required three days to prepare the young ladies for their contempla- ted trip, and these embraced the opening of the college term. Time had run off so merrily that he had not kept count of it, and he was:  thunderstruck when a question put to him about the college, remind- ed him that the term opened on the day before he was. to leave with his fair companions for New York. 'What was he to do? Violate his pledge to the young ladies? That would never do. He determined to conduct them to New York, and hasten on to College. When he came to settle up his bills inl Elizabethtown, he was thunderstruck again; they were four times as large as he antici. pated, and in counting up his cash, he found that he had barely enough left to take him to New York and back to Princeton. The ladies were delayed a day beyond the appointed .timpe by some acci- dent. Mr. Mitten' was in torments. It w as certain that his funds-   MASTERi WILLIAM MTTEN.         209 would give out before he reached Princeton; and here in a land of strangers, what was he to do? In this emergency, it had just occur- red to him that he had been very remiss in not paying his respectsto Mr. Beach, and he concluded to spend a part of the spare. day with this kind friend. Mr. Beach hardly knew hinm when he presented himself at his door, so changed was he in-every thing. After a vis- it of an hour, "SMr. Beach," said' William, L I have been out spend-. ing the vacation, and mny expenses have been so much heavier than I expected, that I have got out of molney; could you favor me so far as to loan me thirty dollars, and I will give you an, order on Mr. San- ders for the anmount, or I will send it to you as soon as I get back to, college."  'Certainly, William," said Mbr. Beach, "I will take,the order, and if you pay it when you get to college, I will send it to you. The money was loaned, and William returned to Elizabeth- town rejoicing. On their way to New York he suggested to Miss Green ,that the college term had opened and that on the day after their arrival in New York, he would be compelled to return to col- lege. She expressed her regrets that they must part, probably never to meet again, but hoped that they. would renew their acquaintance, after their return home. William proposed a friendly correspondence ad interinm. She said she could not promise that, as the pupils of her school were forbidden to correspond with young genlemen; but if he chose to write to her she had no objections. On their arrival in New York, the news greeted them,: that on the evening of the next day two of the greatest tragedians of the age were to appear in the principal parts of Shakspeare's Othello. William had never seen a play acted by professed performers, and "a he had overstayed his time any how, and one day more could not make-much difference," he determined to prolong his visit that far, and take the ladies to the theatre. le procured tickets for the three young ladies, but as :the father of theone whom the others were visiting, chose to accompany thetm all to the theatre, and furnish tickets himself, William had two. on hand either to use or throw away at his option. He was trausport- ed'with the perfomlance. Hamlet wi announced for the next night - but as the ladies declined going to the thlleatre two nights in succes- sion, he went alone. Macheth'was announced for the next night; and as all the girls must see this play, they went as befbre; William accompanying. The day following he left for Princeton, and reach- ed there with just seventy-five cents in his pocket. His class-mate of Morristown (Johnson by name) brought down his history to his departure from that village. "' He went off/'" said &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7117-00000106"/> 210       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. Johnson, " after a, beautiful accomplished South Carolina heiress, worth a cool hundred thousand in cash, with kinky-heads according; and he has only to stretch out his hand to her and she'll snatch at it; for everybody sees that she is over head and ears in love with him, as indeed all the girls in Morristownare; for Bill is death among the pullets." This report mitigated the anxiety of his Georgian compan- ions concerning him,but did not entirely relieve them; for they feared the consequences of William's change of habits, not only upon his stand in College, but upon his future life. We have said that he had four competitors for the first, honor, but there was only one of them that he had cause to dread, for though the five were equal in mathematics, there was but one who approached him in the other studies. This one was Taliaferro ,(pro- nounced Toliver) of Virginia. When at the opening of the term, the ciass appeared to recite in mathematics, and Taliaferro found Mitten absent, his countenance-kindled with delight. His delight increased with every recitation in this study, until it came to the fifth. As he retired from this he said triumphantly, I've got him safe-I've got this brilliant young Georgian just as the owl had the hen, so that he can neither back nor squall. With:his head full of girls and fortune, if ever he keeps up with the class, and makes up five lost lessons, he is a smarter man than I think he is, and I think he is the smartest I ever saw." Taliaferro thus spoke because he well knew that a lost recitation in mathematics is almost as fatal to farther progress in the science, as the loss of one of the nine 'digits would be to enumeration. And yet if William had determined to do it, he could hate made up his deficiencies before the end of the Junior year, and thrown Taliaferro far in his real; in the Senior year. Why he did not, we shall see. When called to account for his ab- sences he said "he was necessarilt' detained." Having followed Mitten's movements during the vacation, let us now unveil some of his thoughts and reflections accompanying these movements. "Here it is now," mused he'on the fifth day of his acquaintance with Miss Green.# "If Amanda had not made me promise to keep our engagement secret, I could now tell Louisa of it, and let her understand the true ground of my attentions to her; but 'as it is, I must either be distant to her-which would be unpardon- able in me as she is from the South-or I must encourage her at- tachment which is plainly visible and growing. Amanda will hear of my attentions through Johnson; and suppose I am after Louisa's fortune. No, dear girl, fortune shall never make me sacrifice my word and my honor."   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         211' On the seventh day: "It was very indiscreet in Amanda to exact that promise from me, I don't know how to act under it." Nintlh day: "Hang that silly promise I'll keep it, but I fear I shall never feel towards Amanda as I should have felt if she had not extorts it from me. I was too hasty in making it-in fact I was too hasty in the whole matter. Well, whatever may come of it, I shall not forego duty to a Southern friend, far from home, because I hap- pen to be engaged." On the day he visited Mr. Beach: "What a botheration it is to. want money-I doubt whether Amanda will ever be satisfied ,o live in Georgia. I wish she was not quite so romantic. It was very im- prudent in her to speak of her father and mother as she did to me- I don',believe one can love truly but once; I believe I could love Louisa just as ardently as I love her, if I would allow myself to do so.,  On the day he left New York-: One hundred thousand dollars! I wish I had fifty of it now. What a suim it is! nough to last a man's life time, and satisfy every desire of his heart. One hundred thousand dollars, and a Beautiful intelligent lovely Southern girl to boot! Amanda ought to adore me for resisting such a temptation. for her sake." On reaching Princetop, he went immediately to see Amanda and found her in deep distress. She said "she had been meditating suicide, but she could not leave the world without one more last, longing, lingering look upon her William." Upon his assuring her, however, that he was not engaged to Miss Green, that he had not proposed himself to her, and that he would have informed her of his engagement, if he had notl been forbidden to do so, Miss Aman- da was greatly comforted, insomuch that she concluded to postpone the suicide to a more,suitable season. She entertained him with a melting narrative of her soliloquies and tears over breastpins, lockets and the like, which, as it came just at the time when he was terribly pinched for money, produced a double sympathy-or rather an oscil- latinig sympathy, which played so equally bet ween himself and Mits Amanda, that she could not understand it, and took it for coldness. They parted, however, with renewed professions of love. Markham, Thompson and Brown, had together paid a short visit to Philadelphia, Trenton and Monmouth, early in the vacation, and *At this time Jersey bank bills were just as current iil Georgia as-gold and silver. The first one dollar bill that ever was seen in Georgia was from a Jersey bank. 9  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7117-00000107"/> 212       MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN. returned to Princeton. On their return, Brown enclosed a fifty dol- lar bill* in a letter to Mr. Mark-ham, saying: "I have saved this much out of my allowance without stinting myself in the least. If you think it would not be wrong to appropriate it to my mother's necessities, please deal it out to her as she needs. Apply al of it but what is absolutely necessary to keep my mother above want, to the schooling of my two little sisters. But if you think that I have no right to use the money in this way, please return it to the kind gentiemen who raised it for me; and tell them that it is more than I need, ard I think in justice it ought to be returned to them." We need hardly say that this letter made John's patrons feel much more like doubling than reducing their contributions to him. From New York William had written a letter to his mother, set- ting forth that he had greatly miscalculated, in saying that five hun- dred dollars per annum would be amply sufficient 9 pay his College expenses. Traveling expenses, he said, far excee b his expecta- tions-that he had set out from Princeton on a vacation ramble, with money enough in hand, he thought, to pay his expenses three times over, and after visiting only three places, he was in New York with hardly money enough to pay his reckoning, and get him back to Princeton; and there his board and tuition would have to be paid in advance. He concluded by begging her to send him on tw o hun- dred,dollars as speedily as possible. Here was the very place for him to'have informed 'his mother that he had borrowed money from Mr. Beach, and to have informed Mr. Sanders through'her, how he came to draw on him. But he knew that it would mortify his moth- er exceedingly, to learn that he was repaying 3ir. Beach's kindness br taxing his purse; and he intended to stop the draft from going to the drawee, by payment of it.. Brown's letter had a fortnight or more'the start of Willian's, and its contents were known to every- body in the village in three days after it had reached Mr. Markham. When William's letter therefore reached home,/it alarmed and dis- tressed his mother exceedingly. She gathered the money -as spoo as she possibly could, (borrowing a part of it) and dispatched it to William, withb a letter eloquently expressive of her feelings. "How is it, my dear boy," said she, ".that John Brown, with his limited resources, can visit Philadelphia, Trenton and Monmouth, and yet send hither fifty dollars out of his income, to assist his poor mother, and school his little sisters; and you cannot visit as many places. without exhausting your funds and requiring two hundred' dollars: over?"

"4 Dig a mole out of the dirt andqstick him on a steeple, and he'll be a mole still." No pen can describe John's agony. He saw himself deserted by the sons of his benefactors--he knewthat they'all believed that he had lied, and he knew that before the morrow's sun, it would be trumpeted' all through-the College that the bright Mitten was kept from his class by his .meanness. In the midst of his horrors, the bell summoned him to recitation. .The class was arranged alphabeti- cally, and his name was 'the first on the list. The Professor called on him; he rose tried to. suppress his emotions, but could not; and be resumed his seat, his bosom heaving, and his eyes streaming as though his heart would break. The class stood aghast, and the Professor looked sad; for Brown had not been remiss in a single College du:ty.' Keen as was his anguish, it would have been aggra. vated heavily, but for George Markham's prudence. "Boys " said he, f'it isn't worth while to spread this thing through the College-at least let us wait awhile before we do it. lie- member that be is a Georgian, has been our intimate friend, and it will be flung up sto us upon all occasions. And after. all, I never knew John Brdkvn to tell a lie in my life, and-he may bc enabled to explain the nmatter."  'ffter some debate they agieed to keep the matter to themselves. That very day John. eceived tidings of his father's death, and as no body thought of enquiring as to the precise time when he received the intelligence, it was regarded by the class as the cause of his emotion in the recitation roomy and by his three friends as an addi- tional inducement to deal tenderly with him. Thompson borrowed the fifteen dollars for William,' and he joined his class. Thus stood matters when Mrs. Mitten's letter was received. As soon as'William read it, he hastened to Thompson and Markham's room with it; hahded it to his cousin, flung himiself into a seat, dropped his forehead) hands-covered on his knees, and wept bitterly. Thompson read it, and passed it in sobs to Markham. He was not so much affected, and spoke first i "';The Lord be praised that we kept ours notions of John's conduct' from the college. Why this, and our coldness, and his father's death *     ,                 ,  ' ,   MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.         215i  all coming upon him at once, would have killed the poor fellow. He's almost heart-broken, any-how. What a warning is this to us against acting hastily in such ,matters! Let us send for him, and relieve both him and ourselves immediately." He was sent for,'and as soon as he entered the room, they all rushed to him ard embraced him together. "Oh, John," continued Markham, " we know what you did with your fifty dollars, and we are all ashamed of ourselves."  ": John," said William, "I beg your pardon ten thousand times-" A' IAnd I.'  "And-'          .  "John," sai&amp;d'Villiam," "how could you say, you didn't know as yet how your money went?"  ' "Because I didn't know that it would be right in me to take mon- ey raised for my education, and apply it to the use of my mofherand . sisters; so I sent it to Mr. Markham and told him, if he thought I had no right to use it in this way, to return it to the gentlemen who raised it for me, and I don't know which way it went, even now, for Mr. Miarkhamt said nothing to me about it in the letter reporting my father's death." "John," continued William," I never shall forgive myself for my treatment of you. I had some apology for suspecting you of insin- cerity, but I had none for that vile, unfeeling, brLital remark of mine-"         , "What remark, AWilliam?" "About the mole." "I didn't hear that."  "You, didn't! Thank heaven, that you did not, but it's none the a less mean on that account.'   ..  William paid the sums borrowed and his board; and now the mer- chants, tailors, shoe-makers and jewelers began to press him. they always press at the opening and close of terms, because students are then commonly full-handed; but they had other reasons for pressing in this instance. The balance of his two hundred dollars, save fif- teen reserved went in less than a fortnight, without paying more than fifty cents on the dollar of his debts. Yputh-like, he thought more of the annoyances of creditors than of their respective claims upon  his honor, and Mr. Beach was postponed to the most ravenous. Some of these, all of whom understand well the- art of milking students, said " that they were not in the habit of crediting students, but that everybody represented Mr. Mitten as such a brilliant, high-minded, rich and honorable young ran, that they would have trusted him for rrryu n, uvnvv yi   '  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7117-00000109"/> half their goods." Othenr fSaid, "'that 'relying Ertally upon pagy ment at this time, they had contracted debts on the faith of it, anid if disappointed, they did not know 'hat was to become -of them." Another said, "If-5tr. Mitton couldn't pay him all, he would be very ghad to get half the amount due, to keep his wife and children froti isuffering." -Thus thbey weht on with every variety of experih:ent uponehis feelings, until he began to think that: his own chiaraCter, the charhctei of the South, and:all Printceton, were likely to sink tdgeth- er in one common grave of indiscriminate ruin. Most 'of Mi'r. Mit- ten's debts had bccn contracted within the past three months, and mabhy'of' the studets, 'elilposted in such ratters;'estified with be- cominig indignation, that such a thidg was unhi(ard. of in the'history of Prihcetdn, as dunning studenta for debts but three months old; aniid' two oir three proposed, in vindication of the time-honored :usages. of t-he place, to stone the- windows of the importunate creditors' - but M. iitten, partly from the 4lights' of Mr. MAarkham's counsels, anc partly froni his ow:Vgood sense, opposed all violent meadires, as he 'could not sea how thee would sustain his credit or cancel his debts. But there were two specialties, which' hurried the creditors -;the one was, that 'Mr. Mitten had promised to pay them at the opening of the term, and the othler was, that Miss Amanda, either from love of truth, ort'he truth of love, had corccted the popular opinion of MAr. Mit- ten's vast wealth, and represented him, upon his own authority, as not only not very rich, but very proor. The torments of creditors abated considerably the rapture with which Mr. Mitten was wont to view the ornaments of Miss Ward's person, interfered witl his stud- ies, and set his thoulghts to runnintg upon filthy lucre. He commnenc- ed his friendly correspondence with Miss Green. H-is first letter was exceedingly friendly. He waiited the proper time for an answer. but received none. H'e wrote another, still more-friendly, but received no :answer. He wr6te another in the very agony of friendship. To this he -ieceivcd the following answer:    '  "All your letters have be, received. They have given the Prin- cipal of the School great uea'siness, and me great delight.

M., when theybecame rather troublesome to a Professor in an adjoining dormitory. The Professor rose, dressed himself, and wenit to Mitten's room door--distehed thile and knock- ed. "Walk in," said Mitten. The Professor attempted to open. the deor, but it was locked. A shuffling of feet, a moving of chairs, a rattling of glasses were hdrd, and the door was opened. The Pro.' fessor stepped iq, found a table set out in the middle of the 'room, with two candles on'it, burnt down nearly to the socket-two fellows on Mitten's bed with all their clothes on, fast askepe-two mo'e in  his room-mate's bed, covered over wit, a counterpane, except aS: to the heel of one -boot-another just undressing. to go-to bed pnder same counterpane (at least he was near that. bed)-another seated at the table 'studying the Greek Lexicon-while Mr. Mitten, who4phen- ed the door, was pacing the room in manjfest indignation.- Though not exactly intoxicated, he had-stimulatehis, nervous system up to. an unwonted degree of'independence-while the Professor was very coolly making his observations,.

(Here onelof the sleep- ers, whose face was to lights, turned abruptly over with a sleepy snort: and the Greek student saw a funny word"' in the Lexicon at which he gave a- little chuckle. "Not quite," said the' Frofessoi; calmly.

J ust before the fatal vacation of which we have spoken, Mrs. Mitten was as happy as she could be on this earth.' Her two daughters had married muea of worth, position and fortune, and were comfortably settled in  counties adjoining that in which she, resided. Her son, already dis. tinguished, was on the high road to preferment, and her mind was at  peace with her Maker and the world. What changes-a few months more wrought in her destiny!    .  The events with which we concluded the last chapter, occurred on Friday night, running into Saturday morning. On Monday morning the Faculty met and Mr.-Mitten was summo'ed before them. "Mitten," sai4 the President, "you are charged with keeping a disorderly room-with keeping intoxicating liquors in your room- with drinking intoxicating liquors-with playing cards. and with in- sulting Professor Plus on Friday night last." "May' I be permitted," enqtired Mitten, '"to ask upon what evi- dence these charges 'are brought against me?"  "I do not think," said the President, " that you have a right to demand the evidence, until you deny the charges." I hope," said Professor Plus, "that I shall be permitted to put Mr. Mitten in possession of the evidence upon which the charges' are fdunded, before he is required to answer them."' The President nodded as*ent. "About twelve o'clock or a little after, on Friday night last, I was waked ,out of sleep by a noise in the dormitory adjoining mirh. It was not continuous, but fitful, and therefore the more annoying; for with every intermission I*flattered- myself it would cease, and I would just get into a doze, when I waj oused by it again. I endured it for about an hour, when I rose, drtssed my- self, went out, and found that the noise proceeded from Mitten's room. I approached the door, 'nd paused for a moment; just as I reached it, I heard five thumps pn a table in quick succession, fol- ,lowed by a yell and profane swearing. 'But for Mitten's Jack of Hearts,' said a voice thatIJ took to be Johnson's, I should have taken the pool.. He plays the devil with hearts' ' Rabb,' sa'd one, 'you were looed.' 'No/,I wasn',' said Rabb, 'I didn't stand.' 'It's Mitten's deal,' said another. 'No, it isn't,' said a third, ' he dealt last time.'

Upon 'enteripg the room, my olfactories were assailed itrongly with the fumes of wine and brandy." The Professor pro- oeeded witi the details which we have already given the reader. "President S* **," said Mitten, '"suppose a Professor of this Institution should take up a strong prejudice against a student, should seek all opportunities of mortifying him and wournting his feelings, an-d in order to bring him before the Faculty, plainly and palpably violate the laws of College-has the student any redress, and how?" Mr. Mitten;" said the President, "our time is too precious to be occupied with the discesion and' settlement of hypothetical cases; but if you have been thus aggrieved, you should seek redress of the Faculty, and if you do not find it here, you should appeal to the Trustees." ".So I supposed," said Mr. Mitten, "and I am now ready to an. swer the charges brought against me, and to lay my complaints be- fore the Faculty."'  He now delivered a flaming speech, in a remarkably fine style for one of his age. As to the first charge, h: said that " keeping a dis- orderly room," certainly implied something'more than having disor- der in his room for a single evening. So of "keeping intoxicating liquors in hia room." As ta "drinlkin, intoxicating liquors," he said he would answer that with the last charge. He admitted there was card-playing, but asserted positively that there was not a bank bill ',a piece of gold or ,silver staked on the gamL-that the pool spoken of consisted of nothing but button-mold --" "Mr. Mitten', said the Presientt, "didn't hose button-molds represent quarters, half dollars or dollars, or some other denomina- tion of money?"     .      o "Really, Dr. S   -:, I cannot see how little bits of bane could represcnt money. A bill rupresents money, because it eontains on its 'face a promise to pay money; but--" Go on with' your defence, Mr. Mitten," said the President. 'Before I answer the last charge," continued Mitteu,. "I beg leaves to readia law of the College: ' Oue of the Profeissors shall room it each dormitory, 2chose . special duty it shall be to vist the rooms, and keep order therein.'

"Abundant proof; but we have not time now to give the reasons of our opinion upon the several charges. Suffice it to say that you hav e not denied a single one of them; and as for this one, we are  constrained to believe that six young gentlemen would not have set up till one o'clock in the morning playing for button-molds." "But four of them had actually gone to bed, and another was un- dressing to gc to bpd when Professor Plus entered." "Yes, but they must have sit up very late; for they were so com- pletely exhausted that they could not take time to undress; and so sleepy, that between the knock at the door and the opening of it, they all fell sound asleep. They monopolized all the beds in the  room, too, leaving you and your studious companion no place to sleep; which was exceedingly impolite, to say the least of it. And here, Mr. Mitten, is the end of questions and answers." f Mitten retired very much incensed, and appealed, not to the Trus- tees, but to his fellow-students, for justice. Nine espoused his cause. They disguised themselves, serenaded'Professor Plus with tin pans, horns, and other noisy instruments, broke his windows, broke up his black-boards, and placarded him in various ways and places. Six were detected and expelled, of whom David Thompson was one. Three escaped for want of proof against them. Thus far Thompson had been hurried on by blind impulse; but now the hour of sober reason had returned, and he was overwhelmed with the troubles which gathered upon him. He ,was disgraced near the close of a creditable Collegiate career. He had not money to bear his expenses home. Ite looked towards home'with horror; for his mother was' no Mrs. Mitten, and Mr. tarkham was a faithful reprie- sentative of his father, and there was the mortification of meeting his many friends and his father's friends as an expelled student. As his troubles increased, so did his indignation against his cousin. "' William,' said he, ' had you followed Mr. Markham's advice, you would have taken the first honor in your class; but instead of that, you have disgraced yourself, disgoaced me, and got five more of your fellow students expelled. Two of the'three ringleaders in the  scrape have escaped, while the rest of us who did nothing more than join in the serenade are dismissed, Had Mr. Markham been in- spired, he could not have foreseen our difficulties clearer, or advised us better about them than he did.

"Ys, and I am that man. I have done wrong, and why not con- fess it? I will confess it to 'everybody else who cannot help me; why not confess it to the Faculty who may help me?" ' Well, if you can truckle to men who have treated your cousin as the Faculty has treated me, you can do so; but if you do, I can never feel to you again as a cousin --- a Well then, we shall be even, for I certainly do iot feel to you as a cousin,   " "You don't?" "No, Idon't." "Then, good morqing, Mr. Thompson. You can shape your course as you please, and I'll do the same." Thompson followed his better judgment.; and the Faculty, incon- sibceration of 'his previous good conduct-that he had never been charged with an offence before-and that he was nearly-related to * litten, and therefore exposed to peculiar temptation from him, com- muted the punishment from expulsion to three weeks' suspension. He rejoiced at his good fortune, and thenceforward improved it through life. Two of his companions in guilt tried the same experi- ment; but as they had nothing to recommend them to clemency, their sentence was unchanged. -"And there is Nassau tall justice," said one of them. "Two students in precisely the. same predicament, one expelled, and the other suspended for three weeks [ A glorious College tls!" Mr. Mitten waited on Miss Ward, and informed her of " the in- justice that had been done him." "It aqly gives me, dear William," said she, "an opportunity of proving'the sincerity of my attachment.

He returned to Mrs. Mitten, and found her sinking, and begging to see her son. He was sent for, and approached her with marvellous self-conmmandi She reached forth her arms to him, and he gently bent himself to their embrace. She held him long to 'her bosom, a flood of tears came to her relief, and she brightened wonderfully. Releasing and gazing on him for a moment, she said: "My dear boy, you are wonderfully improved in appearance." By this time the room was thronged with visitors. The Doctors requested them to withdraw, id order that Mrs. Mitten might be un- disturbed, and if possible, gain sleep.. "Let William and Mr. Markham remain," said she. The rest retired.

Pray, Mr. Mark- ham."  As they bowed. William thought of Mr. Markham's parting pray- er, and the counsels that preceded it, of his abuses of those coun- sels, and the bitter consequences; and his bosom heaved with" inde- scribable emotions. His mother gau, his hand a quick emphatic pressure at every petition, which she would have him notice particu- larly. These signals of attention became less and less sensible as the prayer progressed, till just before its conclusion they ceased en- tirely-her grasp relaxed, and her hand lay motionless and almost lifeless upon that of her son. Mr. Markham and William rose,   //MASTER -VILLIAM MTTEN. "        227 turned their eyes to the gentle suffeer, and saw on her countenance every mark of immediate dissolution.

William took his room, and never left it for near a month, save to tread pensively the walks of the garden. At the end of a fortnight, he addressed a letter to Miss Green, reporting his mother's death, and telling her that she was the last and strongest tie that bound him to earth, and his only hope of heaven. , In due time he received an answer, expressing the tenderest sympathy for him in his bereavement, and concluding as follows:  "I have been tormented by strange reports concerning you which I cannot, I will not believe, until they receive some confirmation from your own lips. . will not aggravate your griefs by repepating-tihenl now, farther than just to say, that if true, your last brief epistle from Princeton was. untrue.

Why did I not forestall Ipublic report by a frank confession of the truth, and offer such justifications of myself as I could?

MASTER WILLIAM   MTTEN.       229 'brooded over his misfortunes for a time, became enraged at the treat- ment of his old friends, and with a heroism worthy of a better cause- he resolved to retaliate upon them. He went forth boldly among them, treated all coldly, and some rudely; made advances to no one; stepped loftily and independently, and resolved to hold every man personally responsible to him, who had taken the liberty of using his name, otherwise than with the profoundest respect. The young gentleman had undertaken an Herculean task, but he deemed him- self adequate to it, and acted accordingly. He called the Doctor to account for circulating remarks made by him " under great excite. ment and distress, which any man of common humanity would never have thought of repeating." The Doctor declared that he never had repeated them. Mr. Mitten told him that 'it was' not worth while to add the sin of falsehood to the sin of brutality, for no one else could have mentioned them."  Anderson's remarks also became town talk, as soon as it was known that Mitten had "backed down" in the "third heat." Ha went. to Anderson in a great rage. "I understand, sir," said he, "that you have been making very free with my name in my absence." "No, Billy, I only said---" ' Don't call me Billy sir--" '"Well, Qenerall WUashington-." "Stop sir! But for your age, I'd give you a caning. And, now listen to me sir: If ever I hearyf your mentioning my name in any way, I shall forget the respect due to age, and give you a chastising, let it cost what it may. If you must expend your race-course wit, expend it upon some one. else, not on me."  "When you undertake to chastise me," said Stewy, "you'd better appoint your executors : for they'll have to wind up the business." Thus Mr. Mitten went on rectifying public opinion, and purifying private conversation, until there were but five persons in the village or its vicinity who could venture to be upon terms of intimacy with him, These five, two old men and three young ones, conceived a * marvelous attachment to him. They forced themselves into his af- fections by a thousand kind saying -of him, and as many harsh ones of all who kept aloof from him. "Never mind, Mitten," said one of the ancients; " as soonVas you get possession of your property, these very mein who are shying off from you nop,.and whispering all sorts of things about you, will be truokling to youalilke houAd-puppies. They hate me worse than p  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7117-00000116"/> they do .you, just because I always take up for you. I see tow thet look at me, every time they see me with you. I despise those old tl men who forget that they were once young, and make no allowance for a little wildness in young men." "Well," said a young one, "I'm glad to see Mitten's indepen-  h dence. He is not beholden to thorl for anything, and I like to see  him going his own way, and taking care of himself." "Mitten," said a third, "we are going into Thew's back room to  amuse ourselves with a game of cards for an hour or so; where shall a! we find you when we come out?" "Why," said William, I'll go in with you."            a "You'd better not)7' said two or. three voices at once. "You   j might be tempt d to play," said Old Fogy, "and when once a young  man begins to play cards, he never knows where to stop. Could you do as we do, just set down and awuse yourself for an hour or two,  and then get up and quit, why that would be all well enough ;/but young people are not like old folks."    w "Well," continued William, "I'll go in and gee you play, but I  will not play myself, for I hlave suffered enough from card-playing  for one lifetime I know."  "Oh well, if you'll do that, no harm done.'" William went in, and kept his word.         , The same scene was riepeated fur a number of days. At length William began to spend his opinion upon the play of one and another, demnonstrating by the doctrine of chances that they were  ' injudicious.                            t "Its lucky for-us, Mittell, that you don't play, or you'd soon leave 8  us without a stake. We know nothing about book-learning, and just. thump away after our old plantation -ray. Old as I am, I'd give the world if I only had your education." Day after day rolled away in like manner. At length, said William, ,"let me take a hand, and see if my theo- ry holds good in practice."  "Oh no!', exclaimed half of them. 'He'll beat us all to death. What do we know about the doctrine of chances!" "Mitten," said Old Fogy, "  don't play. I'm an old man, and though I dou't know anything about chances, I know that the cards 'un so sometimes that there is no counting on them. Now, you are a high-minded, honorable young man, and if you should happen to lose largely, you would be strongly tempted to refuse to pay, plead nfancy, the gaming act, and all that sort of thingu even when you   MASTER WIILLIAM MTTEN.         281 got able to pay, and I wouldn't lose my good opinion of you for all the money in the county."  ' I hope, Mr. Fogy, you don't think I'd do that." " No, I know you'd die now before you'd do it, but temptations. are hard things to get over.  I talked just so to young Tickler, as honor- able a yoelng fellow as ever was born, and what did he do?  Why he won of me dai after day, and week'after week; but when the cards took a turn in my favor, he refused to pay the little, nasty suii of one thousand dollars, when he was worth forty thousand. I never asked him for it till he got his property in hand; and then he said I tempted him to play and cheated him, and I dor't know. what all. I wouldn't have lost m.y good opinion of that young' man for double the money." "Well," .said MIitten, "' am not anxious to 'play."  And he did not. Mitten's company and back-roomn sittings coming to the cars of Mr. Markham, he warned William against his associates. I-e told him'that they were a set of shtrpcrs who would certainly ruin him if he did not abandon them. "Mr. Markham," said William, " these are the only men of the village, (yourself excepted,) who have treated me with any respect and kindness since my return home. You nistake their character. They play cards, it is true, but so far from tempting me to do the same, they advise me not to do it; and consequently I have not thrown a card since my association with them. I shoull be an in- grate and a fool to abandon the only friends who stood by me when all the rest of the world abandoned' me"  Mr. Markham told him their friendships were pretended, their professions unreal, and their counsels hypocritical. 'I.n short, he used every argument and entreaty that he could to witidraw him from these men, but all was unavailing. About this time his college companions returned, having com- pleted their course. Brown haA taken the first honor in his class, and Markham the third. Thompson graduated creditably, but took no honor. The day after their arrival, Thompson presented Alitten'a beau- tiful box.  "And who sends this ?" said Mitten. "Open and see," said his cousin. He  opened it, and saw all the jewelry that he ha'd given to  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7117-00000117"/> 282       MASTER WILLIAM MTTrN. Amanda. On the top of it lay a small note of velvet paper' prettily folded. He opened and,read:   ', "Let them follow the heart of the giver. AMA DA." "How did she seem, David, when she handed it to you " " "Heart-broken."      ; .           I "Yes, poor girl! Had I remained true to her, She would not have  forsaken me. as all my colder friends have done. In a. little time, now, I could have made her comfortable and happy, and for 11 time she would have made me happy." Tears rolled rapidly down his cheeks as he spoke. : Mr. Markham turned over his-school and the profits of it to his son and Brown-he only retiiinig such a supervision over it as to pass it as his school. , The first studied medicine, and the Jsecond law, while teaching. In a little time Brown fixed up a comfortable little residence for his mdther, and furnished it neatly. He gave his sisters the benefit of a good Female Academy, and extended their education by his own private instruction. David Thompson became  the head of his father's family, and trod in the footsteps of his father through life. William continued his unlucky associations. One day, while he was lookirg on at the game of his friendq: Here, Mitten," said one of the seniors, "play my hand for me," rising and going out. On his return another addressed him, slying: "'Look here, old man, take your seat there and play your own hand we can't play with Mitten."  Mitten had won ten dollars while representing his old friend. "Lord," said another,"' what a benefit an education is in every- ' thiqg!"         .  William now proposed to take a hand for himself. Well," poe said, "we needn't object on his account, if we don't object on our own, for there is no danger of his losing."  William played, and won a little. So did he for five or. six si tings. Then his winnings and losings begatr to balance each other -pretty. equally. Then heibegan to lose regularly, but ii small amounts- then in larger amounts.            *  About this time Mr. Mitten made divers remarkable discoveries, to-wit: 'hat whenever he lost, one of the old ones and one of the young ones lost, but that they won in regular succession, so that, at the end of a week's play, he owed (for they " played on tick,") each of them almost exactly the same amount. That though they often played against all the doctrines of chances, t ey were very sure to win? That 9 '   - MtASTER WILLIAM       WILTEH.       - 233 the Young one would frequently relieve himself fiqm the fatigues of the game by playing the fiddle and walking round the table, and that so lohg as he played the fiddle, he (Mitten) was certain to lose. That the other-two young ones lost and won occasionally, but in the long run were like himwlf, losers; and that their losses, like his own were the equal gain of the other three. Now prudence dictated that he should quit this-clique, but he was largely over a thousand dollars in debt to the trio, andre could not gain his consent to do so,' until he recovered his losses. 'At a convenient season he took his fellow-sufferers aside, informed them of his discoveries, and proposed to them that. they shoultplay in co- partnership against the other three," only till they got back their money."  They readily assented to his proposition, and William in- doctrinated them in a set of signs, offensive and defensive, Chat in t better cause would have immortalized him. He cautioned thenrto wait the signal from hinhi before they put any of their plans of attack in operation, and in the mearintime to act wholly on the defensive. The parties mot, and old Fogy entertained the company with' an account of his early adventures at the card-table, in which was this passage:  I lost; and lost, and lost. Dollar after dollar went, and negro after negro. I bore it all like a man until I had to sell my favorite servant, Simon. This was tough, but I had to sacrifice him or fuy honor, so I let him go." The club took their seats. e Two hours rolled away, and the seniors gained nothing from the juniors. The fiddler got fatigued and took his fiddle. .'1ie Juniors, as if by accident, hid their hands every. time he valked behind them. He soon got rested, and resumed his seat. At twelve o'clock at night, the Juniors being a little winners, Mitten gpot too sleepyl to set any longo r, and the game closed. Five sittings ended nearly in the sanle way to the utter amazement of the senwirs*.t  '      , "The young rascals have found out our signs," said Old Fogy, "we must make new ones." They did so. Mitten discovered it in three deals.. ' This is a piddling- sort o' business," said Fogy; '" let's play higher."                         William had not only concerted lhis signs in a, masterly manner, but he had a way of communicating to his partners the most import- ant signs of their adversaries as soon as he discovered them. While he was making his discoveries his party lost a little. "I don't'like to raise the stakes when I'm losing," said William,  ' -  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7117-00000118"/> Gu --andj     T JLnbAM 1JA  jY'L1 ' N. *- "but luck must turn soon, and that will be the quickest way of get- ting back my losings, and I believe I'm willing to play a little higher." Old fogy put up the stakes very high, and William gave the sig- nal for attack with all his armory. In less tan an hour the corn (representing money) was streaming from the Fogy party in a perfect sluice, Mitten lost to his partners Two hundred dollars, and the Fogies lo to them from five hundred to a thousand each. At one o'lock, A. M'., Mitten rose from. the table saying: "That his brain: was so addled- he couldn't play; and that if he could, such a run of luck woutd ruin the best player in the world." It would be both interesting and instructive to the young, to trace Mitteh' progress step by step in gaming, until he became a inost ae- omplishad blackleg; but our limits will not allow us to do so. He was-in rapid progress to this distinction, when Miss Flora Summers daughter of Col. Mark Summers, who resided five miles from the village, returned home from Salem, N. C. She was an only child handsome, agreeable in manners, of good sense and well improved mind. William visited her, land so did John Brown, now admitted td the bar and practising with brilliant promise. The Colonel re- ceived Brown with great cordiality, and Wiliam with distant civili- ty. Flora reversed things exactly. The Colonel 'was not surprised at her preference, but before it had time to ripen into love, he thus addressed her: "My daughter, it may be that Mitten and Brown will become suitors of yours. I do not say to you, in that event marry Brown, but I do say to you do not marry Mitten,'if you would save yourself and me from misery intolerable. You know his his- tgry in part. If he did not break his mother's heart, he hastened her death. He has rendered himself odious to all good men, and become the associate of gamblers. And yet he is a young man of handsome person, fiN address and fine talents. These endowments are apt to win upon a girl's heart; but surely my daughter can for- tify her heart against dangerous impressions from such a man as Mitten."  .    "Yes, Pa," said Flora; "I can and will. I assure you that I will never give my hand, to William." "Then, without feigning an attachment that you do not feel, give him the earliest opportunity of declaring himself, and let your refusal- be resp'ectful but decisive." "I will. It will cost mee'no difficulty to refuse Mitten; but I, don't think I ever can love John Brown. Dear me, Pa, he is so ugly "               ' ',     ,       ?    MASTER WILLIAM MTTEN.        ' 25  "Well, my child, be that as you would have it e I certainly shall not urge you to have Brown or any body else. Your choice will be mine, previded your choice does not light upon one of despicable- character."                      , ' Mitten repeated his visits, and was received more warmly Iby the . Colonel than at first.' In process of tiii e he declared himself aind was positively rejected. Brown continued hisvisits too, but at much longer intervals. His fame in the mean, time was constantly growing; e His manners were not, wanting in poshsh and in intellectual endow- ments he now far outstripped Mitten. His visits for five or six months seemed only of a friendly character. ie read we'l and talkedl well, and was both a wit and humoristi but he never wounded by his sallies. Flora soon became satisfied that John lhad no idea of courting her, and she threw off?" shyness and came upon terms of easy and' agreeable familiarity with him. John spoke 'freely and playfully of his own homeliness; told amusing anecdotes about it, and spoke of it in such ways as made Flora laugh heartily. A single example: After they had become as intimate as brother and sister, 4here was a pause in the conversation one day, And John after a deep sigh said, Well, I'd give a thousand dollars just to know for one, hout how an ugly man feels." Flora laughed immoderately. "Well, John,"' said she, ' I think you might for a dollar know how such an one feels for a life time." Then John roared. Thus matters went on until Flora began'to feel that John's society was a very import- ant item in her life of single blessedness. She met him with smiles iand parted with him-not exactly insadness, but with an expression 'of countenance and "good-bye," which seemed to say, "John, it's hard to part with you, you pleasant, ugly dog." Still John never whispered love, while everybody spoke his praises. About this time Col. Summers got into a lawsui, that alarmed him greatly:' He employed Brown, who disposed of it, on demurrer, at the first term of the' court. At his next visit to Flora, she expressed her gratitude to, him very tenderly, and added,- "John, I hope some day or other we will be able to repay the obligation that we are un; der to you."             . t "Why, Miss Flora; said John, "it's the easiest thing in thewdOild for you to cancel the obligation and make me the willing servant of, you both-"       .  "How; John?" "Why just let your father give his daughter to me, andyou ratify , the gift."   &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7117-00000119"/> Flora looked at him and blushed, and smiled, looked serious and said       ^  -"Are you in earnest, John?"                    h  ' In just as sober earnest as if I were preaching."'  o "John, I don't Welieve you love me:" "Yes, I do, Miss FSlora, ai: ardently as ever man loved woman, but ( until recently I believed my love was hopeless, and therefore I con-  t cealed it, or tried to conceal it. for Hknow you often saw it."' - "Why, John, you astonish me!--Go, ask Pa, and if he gives me  to you, I'll ratify the gift.  I might get- a handsomer man, hut t   ] wever could get a more worthy one." ^ 'As to my beauty,"  said John, ,why that's neither here nor  there.  One thing is certain about it, and that is, that it will never 1 "Well, Johnl, i; we live ten years longer, I am sure Ishull think .  you handsome; ibr your features have been growing more and more agreeable to me, ever since you began to visit me.           i "Well, Miss Flora, if they are aerau'e a qb yo--tokhl-.r to you, ' 1 it is a matter of perfect indifference to me what any one else thinks of them. Another ,great advantage you  will have in marrying a   .  homely man, and that is, you will not be exposed to the common tor-   1 ments of the wives of handsome men."                 . 1 "I'm not so sure of that, -John. Splendid talents, renown and fascinating manners are mluch more aplt to win ale admiration of our sex than a  pretty face."'                 "If you see all these tlings in nme, Flora, you see nmore than I have., ever seen. As you are getting in a complimentary strain, I'll thank you to ask your father in; for thoughil I bear compliments with great [ortitude, they always embarrass men, alid when colningo friom you, ;hey give mne a peculiar drawing to the lips that utter them."

So saying, she bounced to her room and left uim alone, saying as sle flitted away, "I'll send my. father to you  ' ind listen how you draw to each other." The Colonel soon made his appearance. John looked at te   Colouel, put his right'leg over his left, took it lown again and patted his foot. The Colonel took a chew of tobaec. o, cleared his throat and looked at John. John cleared his throat o0, coughed twice, blew his nose and looked at the carpet. "John," aid the CNlonel, ." Flora said you wished to. see. me."

Mitten surrendered himself to cards; distinguished himself among gamblers for his shrewdness, and actually made money by his callingt antil he- was arrested in his career by that disease so common to gamblers, and so fatal to all, consumption.  When he found the di sease fastened incurably upon him, he took his rooln, his mother's Ijed room. , The old family Bible was there. She had often said, that at her death she wished it to go to William, and there it was left for him. He opened it, found in it many traces of his mother's pen, scdraps of paper with texts of scripture, holy resolutions, .prayers, Christian consolations, and the like, written on them.  He closed the book, pressed it to his bosomi and wept bitterly. "Dearest, best of .women!" soliloquized he.  "What a curse 'have . I been to thee! what a curse have I been to myself!   One fault thou hadstj and only one --- No, I must not call it a fault--one weakness shallI call it? No, that is too harsbh a term for-it. One heavenly virtue in exces, thou hadst. too much teA'ness for thy son. But why  do I advert to this!

But oh, how impotent are human resolutions against vices' which halte become constitutional! Tonl, go for Mr. Markhan ."  ' ' Mr. Marklham came, and, found William with his head on hi    . mother's Bible, bedewing it with tears. He raised his head, reached his hot haid to his friend,; and, after some struggles for utteratice,  said:               -'     ' ,       '  ' :- "Mr. larfkham, you have known me from' my childhood to the  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7117-00000120"/> zoo   *    MASTER WILLIA1M I MTTEie . present moment, you have marked my every step in the pathway of ruin--you lave seen me abuse and torture the best of mothers, re- ject the counsels of the best of uncles, and the best of friends, mul- tiplying sins to cover ,sins, insulting .men for disappovin of what my own conscience disapproved, avoiding the goods and consorting with the depraved, prostituting heaven's best gifts to ea*h's worst purposes-in shot, assiniilating myself to a de, as far as it was possible for me to do, so; now tell nie, my dear friend, do you think it possible for such an. abandoned wretch as I am to find tuercy in heaven? In making up your answer, remember that I never thought of asking mercy, and probably never should have thought of it'  had I not seen Death approaching me with sureLunerring step." "Oh yes," said Mr. Markham, " you are not beyond the reach of mercy; Brovided you seek it in the way of God's appointment."  "Be pleased to instruct me in .that way; for I am lamentably de- fi ient in knowledge of the Bible."  Well, in the first place, you "annot expect lmercy unless you ask 'or it. If you ask for it you cannot expect tol have your request granted, unless you perform the conditions upon which such request is to be granted. Now these conditions are (the essential ones,) that you show mercy to every human being that has offended you--" "That is but reasonable." You must freely, and from your heart forgive every one who has trespassed against you. Youtemember your infantile prayer." "Yes, but I never understood it until this moment." "You must seek to be reconciled to every one who has aught against you.'  "The hardest condition of all. I can forg ve those*who have in- jured me; but how shall I ask peace of thbse whom I never wronged?"  "God nevey. wronged you, did He? And yet He asks you to be e  reconciled to him."  "' Wonderful!" ejaculated William, thoughtfully. '"ou would not come to me, William, and ask a favor of me, and at the same time say, '.1 ask it, but I do not believe you will grant it,' would you?" "No, that would'be to insult you to your face." "Neither must you ask favors of God, believing that He will not grant them. You must ask, believing in His goodness, His word and His promises, i. e., you must ask in faith.

"Well, God helping me, I will follow' your counsels this time, to the day of my death. Pray once more for me, thou heaven-born and heaven-directed man." Mr. Markham prayed with him, as if his "lips were touched with a live coal from off the alftar." William, now gave himself to prayer and reading the scriptures. He sent for all within his reach, whom he had offended, or who had offended him. Freely forgave, and was freely forgiven Two, three, -and four months the disease spared him; but he found little coin- fort. "At the beginning of the fifth he found peace; rejoiced for a month more, preached powerfully to all who came to his bedside, and with his last breath cried, "Mother, receive thy son!" and died. / ' ',   &#xD;</p>
