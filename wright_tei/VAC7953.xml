            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>GENTLE READER,—It is customary to omit prefaces. I beg you to make an exception in my
               particular case; I have something I really want to say. I have an object in this
               book, more than the mere telling of a story, and you can always judge of a book
               better if you compare it with the author's object. My object is to interpret to the
               world the New England life and character in that particular time of its history which
               may be called the seminal period. I would endeavor to show you New England in its
                  <emph>seed-bed,</emph> before the hot suns of modern progress had developed its
               sprouting germs into the great trees of to-day.</p>
            <p>New England has been to these United States what the Dorian hive was to Greece. It
               has always been a capital country to emigrate from, and North, South, East, and West
               have been populated largely from New England, so that the seed-bed of New England was
               the seed-bed of this great American Republic, and of all that is likely to come of
               it.</p>
            <p>New England people cannot be thus interpreted without calling into view many grave
               considerations and necessitating some serious thinking.</p>
            <p>In doing this work, I have tried to make my mind as still and passive as a
               looking-glass, or a mountain lake, and then to give you merely the images reflected
               there. I desire that you should see the characteristic<pb
                  n="iv-v (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7953-00000003"/> persons of those times,
               and hear them talk; and sometimes I have taken an author's liberty of explaining
               their characters to you, and telling you why they talked and lived as they did.</p>
            <p>My studies for this object have been Pre-Raphaelite,—taken from real characters, real
               scenes, and real incidents. And some of those things in the story which may appear
               most romantic and like fiction are simple renderings and applications of facts.</p>
            <p>Any one who may be curious enough to consult Rev. Elias Nason's book, called "Sir
               Charles Henry Frankland, or Boston in the Colonial Times," will there see a full
               description of the old manor-house which in this story is called the Dench House. It
               was by that name I always heard it spoken of in my boyhood.</p>
            <p>In portraying the various characters which I have introduced, I have tried to
               maintain the part simply of a sympathetic spectator. I propose neither to teach nor
               preach through them, any farther than any spectator of life is preached to by what he
               sees of the workings of human nature around him.</p>
            <p>Though Calvinist, Arminian, High-Church Episcopalian, sceptic, and simple believer
               all speak in their turn, I merely listen, and endeavor to understand and faithfully
               represent the inner life of each. I myself am but the observer and reporter, seeing
               much, doubting much, questioning much, and believing with all my heart in only a very
               few things.</p>
            <p>And so I take my leave of you.</p>

               <head type="sub">OLDTOWN AND THE MINISTER.</head>
               <p>IT has always been a favorite idea of mine, that there is so much of the human in
                  every man, that the life of any one individual, however obscure, if really and
                  vividly perceived in all its aspirations, struggles, failures, and successes,
                  would command the interest of all others. This is my only apology for offering my
                  life as an open page to the reading of the public.</p>
               <p>Besides this, however, every individual is part and parcel of a great picture of
                  the society in which he lives and acts, and his life cannot be painted without
                  reproducing the picture of the world he lived in; and it has appeared to me that
                  my life might recall the image and body of a period in New England most peculiar
                  and most interesting, the impress of which is now rapidly fading away. I mean the
                  ante-railroad times,—the period when our own hard, rocky, sterile New England was
                  a sort of half Hebrew theocracy, half ultra-democratic republic of little
                  villages, separated by a pathless ocean from all the civilization and refinement
                  of the Old World, forgotten and unnoticed, and yet burning like live coals under
                  this obscurity with all the fervid activity of an intense, newly kindled,
                  peculiar, and individual life.</p>
               <p>My early life lies in one of these quiet little villages,—that of Oldtown, in
                  Massachusetts. It was as pretty a village as ever laid itself down to rest on the
                  banks of a tranquil river. The stream was one of those limpid children of the
                  mountains, whose brown, clear waters ripple with a soft yellow light over
                  many-colored pebbles, now brawling and babbling on rocky bottoms,<pb n="2-3"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000006"/> dashing hither and thither in tiny cascades,
                  throwing white spray over green mossed rocks, and then again sweeping silently,
                  with many a winding curve, through soft green meadows, nursing on its bosom troops
                  of water-lilies, and bordering its banks with blue and white violets, snow-flaked
                  meadow-sweet, and wild iris. Hither and thither, in the fertile tracts of meadow
                  or upland through which this little stream wound, were some two dozen farm-houses,
                  hid in green hollows, or perched on breezy hill-tops; while close alongside of the
                  river, at its widest and deepest part, ran one rustic street, thickly carpeted
                  with short velvet green grass, where stood the presiding buildings of the
                  village.</p>
               <p>First among these was the motherly meeting-house, with its tall white spire, its
                  ample court of sheds and stalls for the shelter of the horses and the various
                  farm-wagons which came in to Sunday services. There was also the school-house, the
                  Academy, and Israel Scran's store, where everything was sold, from hoe-handles up
                  to cambric needles, where the post-office was kept, and where was a general
                  exchange of news, as the different farm-wagons stood hitched around the door, and
                  their owners spent a leisure moment in discussing politics or theology from the
                  top of codfish or mackerel barrels, while their wives and daughters were shopping
                  among the dress goods and ribbons, on the other side of the store. Next to the
                  store was the tavern,—with a tall signpost which used to creak and flap in the
                  summer winds, with a leisurely, rich, easy sort of note of invitation,—a broad
                  veranda in front, with benches,—an open tap-room, where great barrels of beer were
                  kept on draft, and a bar where the various articles proscribed by the temperance
                  society were in those days allowed an open and respectable standing. This tavern
                  veranda and tap-room was another general exchange, not in those days held in the
                  ill repute of such resorts now. The minister himself, in all the magnificence of
                  his cocked hat and ample clerical wig, with his gold-headed cane in his hand,
                  would sometimes step into the tap-room of a cold winter morning, and order a mug
                  of flip from obsequious Amaziah the host, and, while he sipped it, would lecture
                  with a severe gravity a few idle, ragged fellows who were spending too much time
                  in those seductive precincts. The clergy in those days felt that they never
                  preached temperance with so warm a fervor as between the comfortable sips of a
                  beverage of whose temperate use they intended to be shining examples. The most
                  vivid image of respectability and majesty which a little boy born in a
                  Massachusetts village in those early days could form was the minister. In the
                  little theocracy which the Pilgrims established in the wilderness, the ministry
                  was the only order of nobility. They were the only privileged class, and their
                  voice it was that decided <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ex cathedra</foreign> on all
                  questions both in Church and State, from the choice of a Governor to that of the
                  district-school teacher.</p>
               <p>Our minister, as I remember him, was one of the cleanest, most gentlemanly, most
                  well bred of men,—never appearing without all the decorums of silk stockings,
                  shining knee and shoe buckles, well-brushed shoes, immaculately powdered wig, out
                  of which shone his clear, calm, serious face, like the moon out of a fleecy
                  cloud.</p>
               <p>Oldtown was originally an Indian town, and one of the most numerous and powerful
                  of the Indian tribes had possessed the beautiful tracts of meadow and upland farms
                  that bordered the Sepaug River. Here the great apostle of the Indians had
                  established the first missionary enterprise among them, under the patronage of a
                  society in England for the propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts; here he had
                  labored and taught and prayed with a fervor which bowed all hearts to his sway,
                  and gathered from the sons of the forest a church of devoted Christians. The harsh
                  guttural Indian language, in the fervent alembic of his loving study, was melted
                  into a written dialect; a Bible and hymn-book and spelling-book seemed to open a
                  path to an Indian literature. He taught them agriculture, and many of the arts and
                  trades of civilized life. But he could not avert the doom which seems to
                  foreordain that those races shall dry up and pass away with their native forests,
                  as the brook dries up when the pines and hemlocks which shaded its source are torn
                  away.</p>
               <p>In my boyhood, three generations had passed since the apostle died. The elms which
                  two grateful Indian catechumens had set out as little saplings on either side of
                  his gateway were now<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7953-00000007"/> two beautiful pillars,
                  supporting each its firmament of leafy boughs, and giving a grand air of scholarly
                  retirement to the plain, old-fashioned parsonage; but the powerful Indian tribe
                  had dwindled to a few scattered families, living an uncertain and wandering life
                  on the outskirts of the thrift and civilization of the whites.</p>
               <p>Our minister was one of those cold, clear-cut, polished crystals that are formed
                  in the cooling-down of society, after it has been melted and purified by a great
                  enthusiasm. Nobody can read Dr. Cotton Mather's biography of the first ministers
                  of Massachusetts, without feeling that they were men whose whole souls were in a
                  state of fusion, by their conceptions of an endless life; that the ruling forces
                  which impelled them were the sublimities of a world to come; and that, if there be
                  such a thing possible as perfect faith in the eternal and invisible, and perfect
                  loyalty to God and to conscience, these men were pervaded by it.</p>
               <p>More than this, many of them were men of a softened and tender spirit, bowed by
                  past afflictions, who had passed through the refining fires of martyrdom, and come
                  to this country, counting not home or kindred dear to them, that they might found
                  a commonwealth for the beloved name and honor of One who died for them. <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Christo et Ecclesiæ,</foreign> was the seal with which they
                  consecrated all their life-work, from the founding of Harvard College down to the
                  district school in every village. These men lived in the full spirit of him who
                  said, "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live: yet not I, but Christ
                  liveth in me"; and the power of this invisible and mighty love shed a softening
                  charm over the austere grandeur of their lives. They formed a commonwealth where
                  vice was wellnigh impossible; where such landmarks and boundaries and buttresses
                  and breastworks hedged in and defended the morality of a community, that to go
                  very far out of the way would require some considerable ingenuity and
                  enterprise.</p>
               <p>The young men grew up grave and decorous through the nursing of church, catechism,
                  and college, all acting in one line; and in due time many studious and quiet
                  youths stepped, in regular succession, from the college to the theological course,
                  and thence to the ministry, as their natural and appointed work. They received the
                  articles of faith as taught in their catechism without dispute, and took their
                  places calmly and without opposition to assist in carrying on a society where
                  everything had been arranged to go under their direction, and they were the
                  recognized and appointed leaders and governors.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Lothrop had come of good ministerial blood for generations back. His
                  destination had always been for the pulpit. He was possessed of one of those calm,
                  quiet, sedate natures, to whom the temptations of turbulent nerves or vehement
                  passions are things utterly incomprehensible.</p>
               <p>Now, however stringent and pronounced may be the forms in which one's traditional
                  faith may have been expressed, it is certain that temperament gradually, and with
                  irresistible power, modifies one's creed. Those features of a man's professed
                  belief which are unsympathetic with his nature become to his mind involved in a
                  perpetual haze and cloud of disuse; while certain others, which are congenial,
                  become vivid and pronounced; and thus, practically, the whole faith of the man
                  changes without his ever being aware of the fact himself.</p>
               <p>Parson Lothrop belonged to a numerous class in the third generation of
                  Massachusetts clergy, commonly called Arminian,—men in whom this insensible change
                  had been wrought from the sharply defined and pronounced Calvinism of the early
                  fathers. They were mostly scholarly, quiet men, of calm and philosophic
                  temperament, who, having from infancy walked in all the traditions of a virtuous
                  and pious education, and passed from grade to grade of their progress with
                  irreproachable quiet and decorum, came to regard the spiritual struggles and
                  conflicts, the wrestlings and tears, the fastings and temptations of their
                  ancestors with a secret scepticism,—to dwell on moralities, virtues, and decorums,
                  rather than on those soul-stirring spiritual mysteries which still stood forth
                  unquestioned and uncontradicted in their confessions of faith.</p>
               <p>Parson Lothrop fulfilled with immaculate precision all the proprieties exacted in
                  his station. Oldtown having been originally an Indian missionary station, an
                  annual stipend was paid<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7953-00000008"/> the pastor of this
                  town from a fund originally invested in England for the conversion of the Indians;
                  and so Parson Lothrop had the sounding-board of Eliot's pulpit put up over the
                  great armchair in his study, and used to call thither weekly the wandering
                  remnants of Indian tribes to be catechised. He did not, like his great
                  predecessor, lecture them on the original depravity of the heart, the need of a
                  radical and thorough regeneration by the Holy Spirit of God, or the power of Jesus
                  as a Saviour from sin, but he talked to them of the evil of drunkenness and lying
                  and idleness, and exhorted them to be temperate and industrious; and when they,
                  notwithstanding his exhortations, continued to lead an unthrifty, wandering life,
                  he calmly expressed his conviction that they were children of the forest, a race
                  destined to extinction with the progress of civilization, but continued his labors
                  for them with automatic precision.</p>
               <p>His Sunday sermons were well-written specimens of the purest and most elegant
                  Addisonian English, and no mortal could find fault with a word that was in them,
                  as they were sensible, rational, and religious, as far as they went. Indeed, Mr.
                  Lothrop was quite an elegant scholar and student in literature, and more than once
                  surprise had been expressed to him that he should be willing to employ his
                  abilities in so obscure a town and for so inconsiderable a salary. His reply was
                  characteristic. "My salary is indeed small, but it is as certain as the Bank of
                  England, and retirement and quiet give me leisure for study."</p>
               <p>He, however, mended his worldly prospects by a matrimonial union with a widow lady
                  of large property, from one of the most aristocratic families of Boston. Mrs.
                  Dorothea Lucretia Dixwell was the widow of a Tory merchant, who, by rare skill in
                  trimming his boat to suit the times, had come through the Revolutionary war with a
                  handsome property unimpaired, which, dying shortly after, he left to his widow.
                  Mrs. Dixwell was in heart and soul an Englishwoman, an adorer of church and king,
                  a worshipper of aristocracy and all the powers that be. She owned a pew in King's
                  Chapel, and clung more punctiliously than ever to her prayer-book, when all other
                  memorials of our connection with the mother country had departed.</p>
               <p>Could it be thought that the elegant and rich widow would smile on the suit of an
                  obscure country Congregational clergyman? Yet she did; and for it there were many
                  good reasons. Parson Lothrop was a stately, handsome, well-proportioned man, and
                  had the formal and ceremonious politeness of a gentleman of the old school, and by
                  family descent Mrs. Dorothea's remembrance could trace back his blood to that of
                  some very solid families among the English gentry, and as there were no more
                  noblemen to be had in America, marrying a minister in those days was the next best
                  thing to it; and so Mrs. Dixwell became Mrs. Parson Lothrop, and made a
                  processional entrance into Oldtown in her own coach, and came therein to church
                  the first Sunday after her marriage, in all the pomp of a white brocade, with
                  silver flowers on it of life-size, and white-satin slippers with heels two inches
                  high. This was a great grace to show to a Congregational church, but Mrs. Lothrop
                  knew the duty of a wife, and conformed to it heroically. Nor was Parson Lothrop
                  unmindful of the courtesies of a husband in this matrimonial treaty, for it was
                  stipulated and agreed that Madam Lothrop should have full liberty to observe in
                  her own proper person all the festivals and fasts of the Church of England, should
                  be excused from all company and allowed to keep the seclusion of her own apartment
                  on Good Friday, and should proceed immediately thereafter in her own coach to
                  Boston, to be present at the Easter services in King's Chapel. The same procession
                  to Boston in her own coach took place also on Whit-sunday and Christmas. Moreover
                  she decked her house with green boughs and made mince-pies at Christmas time, and
                  in short conducted her housekeeping in all respects as a zealous member of the
                  Church of England ought.</p>
               <p>In those days of New England, the minister and his wife were considered the
                  temporal and spiritual superiors of everybody in the parish. The idea which has
                  since gained ground, of regarding the minister and his family as a sort of
                  stipendiary attachment and hired officials of the parish, to be overlooked,
                  schooled, advised, rebuked, and chastened by every deacon and deacon's wife or
                  rich and influential parishioner, had not then arisen.<pb n="8-9"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000009"/> Parson Lothrop was so calmly awful in his sense of
                  his own position and authority, that it would have been a sight worth seeing to
                  witness any of his parish coming to him, as deacons and influential parishioners
                  now-a-days feel at liberty to come to their minister, with suggestions and
                  admonitions. His manner was ever gracious and affable, as of a man who habitually
                  surveys every one from above, and is disposed to listen with indulgent courtesy,
                  and has advice in reserve for all seekers; but there was not the slightest shadow
                  of anything which encouraged the most presuming to offer counsel in return. And so
                  the marriage with the rich Episcopal widow, her processional entry into Oldtown,
                  the coach and outriders, the brocade and satin slippers, were all submitted to on
                  the part of the Oldtown people without a murmur.</p>
               <p>The fact is, that the parson himself felt within his veins the traditional
                  promptings of a far-off church and king ancestry, and relished with a calm delight
                  a solemn trot to the meeting-house behind a pair of fat, decorous old family
                  horses, with a black coachman in livery on the box. It struck him as sensible and
                  becoming. So also he liked a sideboard loaded with massive family plate, warmed up
                  with the ruby hues of old wines of fifty years' ripening, gleaming through crystal
                  decanters, and well-trained man-servants and maid-servants, through whom his wig,
                  his shoes, and all his mortal belongings, received daily and suitable care. He was
                  to Mrs. Dorothea the most deferential of husbands, always rising with stately
                  courtesy to offer her a chair when she entered an apartment, and hastening to open
                  the door for her if she wished to pass out, and passing every morning and evening
                  the formal gallantries and inquiries in regard to her health and well-being which
                  he felt that her state and condition required.</p>
               <p>Fancy if you can the magnificent distance at which this sublime couple stood above
                  a little ten-year-old boy, who wore a blue checked apron, and every day pattered
                  barefoot after the cows, and who, at the time this story of myself begins, had
                  just, by reaching up on his little bare tiptoes, struck the great black knocker on
                  their front door.</p>
               <p>The door was opened by a stately black servant, who had about him an indistinct
                  and yet perceptible atmosphere of ministerial gravity and dignity, looking like a
                  black doctor of divinity.</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Lothrop at home," I said, blushing to the roots of my hair.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sonny," said the black condescendingly.</p>
               <p>"Won't you please tell him father 's dying, and mother wants him to come quick?"
                  and with that, what with awe, and what with grief, I burst into tears.</p>
               <p>The kind-hearted black relaxed from his majesty at once, and said: "Lord bress yer
                  soul! why, don't cry now, honey, and I'll jes' call missis";—and in fact, before I
                  knew it, he had opened the parlor door, and ushered me into the august presence of
                  Lady Lothrop, as she used to be familiarly called in our village.</p>
               <p>She was a tall, thin, sallow woman, looking very much like those portraits by
                  Copley that still adorn some old houses in Boston; but she had a gentle voice, and
                  a compassionate, womanly way with her. She comforted me with a cake, which she
                  drew from the closet in the sideboard; decanted some very choice old wine into a
                  bottle, which she said I was to carry to my mother, and be sure and tell her to
                  take a little of it herself. She also desired me to give her a small book which
                  she had found of use in times of affliction, called "The Mourner's Companion,"
                  consisting mainly of choice selections from the English Book of Common Prayer.</p>
               <p>When the minister came into the room I saw that she gave a conjugal touch to the
                  snowy plaited frill of his ruffled shirt, and a thoughtful inspection to the wide
                  linen cambric frills which set off his well-formed hand, and which were a little
                  discomposed by rubbing over his writing-table,—nay, even upon one of them a small
                  stain of ink was visible, as the minister, unknown to himself, had drawn his
                  ruffles over an undried portion of his next Sunday's sermon.</p>
               <p>"Dinah must attend to this," she said; "here 's a spot requiring salts of lemon;
                  and, my dear," she said, in an insinuating tone, holding out a richly bound velvet
                  prayer-book, "would you<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7953-00000010"/> not like to read
                  our service for the Visitation of the Sick,—it is so excellent."</p>
               <p>"I am well aware of that, my love," said the minister, repelling her prayer-book
                  with a gentle stateliness, "but I assure you, Dorothea, it would not do,—no, it
                  would not do."</p>
               <p>I thought the good lady sighed as her husband left the house, and looked longingly
                  after him through the window as he walked down the yard. She probably consoled
                  herself with the reflection that one could not have everything, and that her
                  spouse, if not in the Established Church of England, was every way fitted to adorn
                  it had he only been there.</p>

               <head type="sub">MY FATHER.</head>
               <p>MY good reader, it must sometimes have fallen under your observation that there is
                  a class of men who go through life under a cloud, for no other reason than that,
                  being born with the nature of gentlemen, they are nevertheless poor. Such men
                  generally live under a sense of the dissatisfaction and rebuke of our good mother
                  world; and yet it is easy to see all the while that even a moderate competence
                  would at any moment turn their faults into virtues, and make them in everybody's
                  opinion model characters.</p>
               <p>Now you know there are plants to whom poor soil or rich soil seems to make no
                  manner of difference. Your mullein and your burdock do admirably on a gravelly
                  hillside, and admirably in rich garden soil. Nothing comes amiss with them. But
                  take a saffrano rose or a hyacinth and turn it out to shift for itself by the
                  roadside, and it soon dwindles and pines, and loses its color and shape, till
                  everybody thinks such a wretched, ragged specimen of vegetation had better be out
                  of the world than in it.</p>
               <p>From all I remember of my poor father, he had the organization and tastes of a
                  scholar and a gentleman; but he was born the son of a poor widow, who hardly knew
                  from week to week where the few hard-earned dollars were to come from which kept
                  her and her boy in the very plainest food and clothing. So she thought herself
                  happy when she apprenticed him to a paper-maker. Thence he had fought his way up
                  with his little boy hands towards what to him was light and life,—an education.
                  Harvard College, to his eyes, was like the distant vision of the New Jerusalem to
                  the Christian. Thither he aspired, thither he meant to go. Through many a
                  self-denial, many an hour of toil,—studying his Latin grammar by night in the
                  paper-mill, saving his odd pennies, and buying book after book, and treasuring<pb
                     n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7953-00000011"/> ing each one as a mine of wealth,—he went
                  on, till finally he gained enough of a standing to teach, first the common school,
                  and then the Academy.</p>
               <p>While he was teacher of the Academy he made his first false step, which was a
                  false step only because he was poor,—he fell in love with my mother. If he had
                  been well to do in the world, everybody would have said that it was the most
                  natural and praiseworthy thing possible. It was some extenuation of his fault that
                  my poor mother was very pretty and attractive,—she was, in fact, one of my
                  father's prettiest scholars. He saw her daily, and so the folly grew upon him,
                  till he was ready to sacrifice his life's object, and consent to be all his days a
                  poor academy teacher in Oldtown, that he might marry her.</p>
               <p>One must be very much of a woman for whom a man can sacrifice the deepest purpose
                  of his life without awaking to regret it. I do not say that my father did so; and
                  yet I could see, from the earliest of my recollection, that ours was a household
                  clouded by suppressed regrets, as well as embarrassed by real wants.</p>
               <p>My mother was one of those bright, fair, delicate New England girls who remind us
                  of the shell-pink of the wood-anemone, or the fragile wind-flower; and every one
                  must remember how jauntily they toss their gay little heads as they grow in their
                  own mossy dells, at the root of old oaks or beeches, but how quickly they become
                  withered and bedraggled when we gather them.</p>
               <p>My mother's gayety of animal spirits, her sparkle and vivacity, all went with the
                  first year of marriage. The cares of housekeeping, the sicknesses of maternity and
                  nursing, drained her dry of all that was bright and attractive; and my only
                  recollections of her are of a little quiet, faded, mournful woman, who looked on
                  my birth and that of my brother Bill as the greatest of possible misfortunes, and
                  took care of us with a discouraged patience, more as if she pitied us for being
                  born than as if she loved us.</p>
               <p>My father seemed to regard her with a half-remorseful tenderness, as he strove by
                  extra reading and study to make up for the loss of that education the prospect of
                  which he had sacrificed in his marriage. In common with a great many scholars of
                  that day and of this, he ignored his body altogether, and tasked and strained his
                  brain with night studies till his health sank under it; and Consumption, which in
                  New England stands ever waiting for victims, took his cold hand in hers, and led
                  him quietly but irresistibly downward.</p>
               <p>Such, to this moment, was my father's history; and you will see the truth of what
                  I have been saying,—that a modest little property would have changed all his
                  faults and mistakes into proprieties and virtues.</p>
               <p>He had been sick so long, so very long, it seemed to my child-mind! and now there
                  was approaching him that dark shadow so terrible to flesh and heart, in whose
                  dimness every one feels an instinctive longing for aid. That something must be
                  done for the dying to prepare them for their last lonesome journey is a strong
                  instinct of every soul; and I had heard my mother pathetically urging my father
                  that morning to send for the minister.</p>
               <p>"What good will it do, Susy?" had been his answer, given with a sort of weary
                  despondence; but still he had assented, and I had gone eagerly to bring him.</p>
               <p>I was, for my part, strong in faith. I wanted to do something for my father, and I
                  felt certain that the minister would know what was the right thing; and when I set
                  forth with him, in his full panoply,—wig and ruffles and gold-headed cane,—I felt
                  somehow as if the ark of the covenant was moving down the street to our house.</p>
               <p>My mother met the minister at the door, with tears yet undried in her eyes, and
                  responded in the fullest manner to the somewhat stately, but yet gracious,
                  inquiries which he made as to my father's health and condition, and thanked him
                  for the kindly messages and gifts of Lady Lothrop, which I had brought.</p>
               <p>Then he was shown into the sick-room. My father was lying propped up by pillows,
                  and with the bright flush of his afternoon fever on his cheeks. He was always a
                  handsome man, fastidious about his person and belongings; and as he lay with his
                  long thin hands folded together over the bed-clothes, his hair clinging<pb
                     n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7953-00000012"/> in damp curls round his high white
                  forehead, and his large, clear hazel eyes kindled with an unnatural brightness, he
                  formed on my childish memory a picture that will never fade. There was in his eyes
                  at this moment that peculiar look of deep suffering which I have sometimes seen in
                  the eyes of wounded birds or dying animals,—something that spoke of a quiet,
                  unutterable anguish.</p>
               <p>My father had been not only a scholar, but a thinker,—one of those silent,
                  peculiar natures whose thoughts and reasonings too often wander up and down the
                  track of commonly received opinion, as Noah's dove of old, without finding rest
                  for the sole of their foot. When a mind like this is approaching the confines of
                  the eternal unknown, there is often a conflict of thought and emotion, the
                  utterance of which to a receptive and sympathizing soul might bring relief.
                  Something there was of intense yearning and inquiry in the first glance he threw
                  on the minister, and then it changed to one of weary languor. With the quick
                  spiritual instincts of that last dying hour, he had seen into the soul of the
                  man,—that there was nothing there for him. Even the gold-headed cane was not the
                  rod and staff for him in the dark valley.</p>
               <p>There was, in fact, something in the tranquil, calm, unpathetic nature of that
                  good man, which rendered him peculiarly inapt to enter into the secret chamber of
                  souls that struggle and suffer and doubt. He had a nature so evenly balanced, his
                  course in life had been so quiet and unruffled, his speculations and doubts had
                  been of so philosophical and tranquil a kind, that he was not in the least fitted
                  to become father confessor to a sick and wounded spirit.</p>
               <p>His nature was one that inclined to certain stately formalities and proprieties;
                  and although he had, in accordance with his station in the Congregational church,
                  put from him the forms of the Church of England, and was supposed to rely on the
                  extemporaneous movements of the hour, his devotional exercises, nevertheless, had
                  as much a stereotype form as if they had been printed in a book. We boys always
                  knew when the time for certain familiar phrases and expressions would occur in his
                  Sunday morning prayer, and exactly the welcome words which heralded the close of
                  the afternoon exercise.</p>
               <p>I remember now, as he knelt by my father's bedside, how far off and distant the
                  usual opening formula of his prayer made the Great Helper to appear. "Supremely
                  great, infinitely glorious, and ever-blessed God," it said, "grant that we may
                  suitably realize the infinite distance between us, worms of the dust, and thy
                  divine majesty."</p>
               <p>I was gazing earnestly at my father, as he lay with his bright, yearning, troubled
                  eyes looking out into the misty shadows of the eternal world, and I saw him close
                  them wearily, and open them again, with an expression of quiet endurance. The
                  infinite distance was a thing that he realized only too well; but who should tell
                  him of an infinite <emph>nearness</emph> by which those who are far off are made
                  nigh?</p>
               <p>After the prayer, the minister expressed the hope that my father would be resigned
                  to the decrees of infinite wisdom, and my father languidly assented; and then,
                  with a ministerial benediction, the whole stately apparition of ghostly aid and
                  comfort departed from our house.</p>
               <p>One thing, at all events, had been gained,—my father had had the minister and been
                  prayed with, and nobody in Oldtown could say that everything had not been properly
                  done, according to the code of spiritual etiquette generally established. For our
                  town, like other little places, always kept a wide-awake eye on the goings and
                  doings of her children. Oldtown had had its own opinion of my father for a great
                  while, and expressed it freely in tea-drinkings, quiltings, at the store, and at
                  the tavern. If Oldtown's advice had been asked, there were a hundred things that
                  he did which would have been left undone, and a hundred things done which he did
                  not do. Oldtown knew just whom he ought to have married instead of marrying my
                  mother, and was certain he could have had her too. Oldtown knew just how and when
                  he might have made himself a rich man, and did n't. Oldtown knew exactly when,
                  how, and why he caught the cold that set him into a consumption, and what he ought
                  to have taken to cure it, and did n't. And now he was, so to speak,<pb n="16-17"

                  would. But one thing was certain, and Oldtown was glad to hear of it,—he was n't
                  an infidel, as had been at different times insinuated, for he had had the minister
                  and been prayed with; and so, though he never had joined the church, Oldtown
                  indulged some hope for his hereafter.</p>
               <p>When the minister was gone, my father said, with a weary smile: "There, Susy dear,
                  I hope you are satisfied now. My poor child," he added, gently drawing her to sit
                  down by him, and looking at her with the strange, solemn dispassionateness of
                  dying people, who already begin to feel that they are of another sphere,—"my poor
                  dear little girl! You were so pretty and so gay! I did you a great wrong in
                  marrying you."</p>
               <p>"O, don't say that Horace," said my mother.</p>
               <p>"It's true, though," said my father. "With a richer and more prosperous man, you
                  might have been blooming and happy yet. And this poor little man," said my father,
                  stroking my head,—"perhaps fate may have something better in store for him. If I
                  had had but the ghost of a chance, such as some men have,—some who do not value
                  it, who only throw it away,—I might have been something. I had it in me; but no
                  one, will ever know it now. My life is a miserable, disgusting failure. Burn all
                  my papers, Susy. Promise me that."</p>
               <p>"I will do just what you say, Horace."</p>
               <p>"And, Susy, when I am gone, don't let all the old gossips of Oldtown come to croak
                  and croon over me, and make their stupid remarks on my helpless body. I hate
                  country funerals. Don't make a vulgar show of me for their staring curiosity.
                  Death is dreary enough at best, but I never could see any sense in aggravating its
                  horrors by stupid funeral customs. Instead of dressing me in those ghostly,
                  unnatural grave-clothes that people seem to delight in, just let me be buried in
                  my clothes and let the last look my poor children have of me be as natural and
                  familiar as possible. The last look of the dead ought to be sacred to one's
                  friends alone. Promise, now, Susy," he said earnestly, "promise to do as I
                  say."</p>
               <p>"O Horace, I do promise,—I promise to do all you say. You know I always have."</p>
               <p>"Yes, poor dear child, you have; you have been only too good for me."</p>
               <p>"O Horace, how can you say so!" and my poor mother fell on my father's neck in a
                  paroxysm of weeping.</p>
               <p>But his great, bright eyes gathered no tears; they were fixed in an awful
                  stillness. "My darling, you must not," he said tenderly, but with no answering
                  emotion. "Calm yourself. And now, dear, as I am sure that to-morrow I shall not be
                  with you, you must send for your mother to be with you to-night. You know she will
                  come."</p>
               <p>"Father," said I earnestly, "where are you going?"</p>
               <p>"Where?" said he, looking at me with his clear, mournful eyes. "God knows, my son.
                  I do not. It ought to be enough for me that God does know."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <head type="sub">MY GRANDMOTHER.</head>
               <p>"NOW, Horace," said my mother, "you must run right up to your grandfather's, and
                  tell your grandmother to come down and stay with us to-night; and you and Bill
                  must stay there."</p>
               <p>Bill, my brother, was a year or two older than I was; far more healthy, and
                  consequently, perhaps, far more noisy. At any rate, my mother was generally only
                  too glad to give her consent to his going anywhere of a leisure afternoon which
                  would keep him out of the house, while I was always retained as her own special
                  waiter and messenger.</p>
               <p>My father had a partiality for me, because I was early an apt reader, and was fond
                  of the quiet of his study and his books. He used to take pride and pleasure in
                  hearing me read, which I did with more fluency and understanding than many
                  children of twice my age; and thus it happened that, while Bill was off roaming in
                  the woods this sunny autumn afternoon, I was the attendant and waiter in the
                  sick-room. My little soul was oppressed and sorrowful, and so the message that
                  sent me to my grandmother was a very welcome one, for my grandmother was, in my
                  view, a tower of strength and deliverance. My mother was, as I have said, a frail,
                  mournful, little, discouraged woman; but my grandmother belonged to that tribe of
                  strong-backed, energetic, martial mothers in Israel, who brought to our life in
                  America the vigorous bone and muscle and hearty blood of the yeomanry of Old
                  England. She was a valiant old soul, who fearlessly took any bull in life by the
                  horns, and was ready to shake him into decorum.</p>
               <p>My grandfather, a well-to-do farmer, was one of the chief magnates of the village,
                  and carried on a large farm and certain mills at the other end of it. The great
                  old-fashioned farmhouse house where they lived was at some distance from my
                  father's cottage, right on the banks of that brown, sparkling, clear stream I have
                  spoken of.</p>
               <p>My grandfather was a serene, moderate, quiet man, upward of sixty, with an affable
                  word and a smile for everybody,—a man of easy habits, never discomposed, and never
                  in a hurry,—who had a comfortable faith that somehow or other the affairs of this
                  world in general, and his own in particular, would turn out all right, without
                  much seeing to on his part.</p>
               <p>My grandmother, on the contrary, was one of those wide-awake, earnest, active
                  natures, whose days were hardly ever long enough for all that she felt needed to
                  be done and attended to. She had very positive opinions on every subject, and was
                  not at all backward in the forcible and vigorous expression of them; and evidently
                  considering the apostolic gift of exhortation as having come straight down to her,
                  she failed not to use it for the benefit of all whom it might concern.</p>
               <p>Oldtown had in many respects a peculiar sort of society. The Indian tribe that
                  once had been settled in its vicinity had left upon the place the tradition of a
                  sort of wandering, gypsy, tramping life, so that there was in the town an unusual
                  number of that roving, uncertain class of people, who are always falling into
                  want, and needing to be helped, hanging like a tattered fringe on the thrifty and
                  well-kept petticoat of New England society.</p>
               <p>The traditions of tenderness, pity, and indulgence which the apostle Eliot had
                  inwrought into the people of his day in regard to the Indians, had descended
                  through all the families, and given to that roving people certain established
                  rights in every household, which in those days no one ever thought of disowning.
                  The wandering Indian was never denied a good meal, a seat by the kitchen fire, a
                  mug of cider, and a bed in the barn. My grandfather, out of his ample
                  apple-orchard, always made one hogshead of cider which was called the Indian
                  hogshead, and which was known to be always on tap for them; and my grandmother not
                  only gave them food, but more than once would provide them with blankets, and
                  allow them to lie down and sleep by her great kitchen fire. In those days New
                  England was such a well-watched,<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7953-00000015"/> and
                  schooled and catechised community, and so innocent in the general tone of its
                  society, that in the rural villages no one ever locked the house doors of a night.
                  I have lain awake many a night hearing the notes of the whippoorwills and the
                  frogs, and listening to the sighing of the breeze, as it came through the great
                  wide-open front-door of the house, and swept up the staircase. Nobody ever thought
                  of being afraid that the tramper whom he left asleep on the kitchen floor would
                  rouse up in the night and rob the house. In fact, the poor vagrants were
                  themselves tolerably innocent, not being guilty of very many sins darker than
                  occasional drunkenness and habitual unthrift. They were a simple, silly, jolly set
                  of rovers, partly Indian and partly whites who had fallen into Indian habits, who
                  told stories, made baskets, drank cider, and raised puppies, of which they
                  generally carried a supply in their wanderings, and from which came forth in due
                  time an ample supply of those yellow dogs of old, one of whom was a standing
                  member of every well-regulated New England family. Your yellow dog had an
                  important part to act in life, as much as any of his masters. He lay in the
                  kitchen door and barked properly at everything that went by. He went out with the
                  children when they went roving in the woods Saturday afternoon, and was always on
                  hand with a sober face to patter on his four solemn paws behind the farm-wagon as
                  it went to meeting of a Sunday morning. And in meeting, who can say what an
                  infinite fund of consolation their yellow, honest faces and great, soft eyes were
                  to the children tired of the sermon, but greatly consoled by getting a sly
                  opportunity to stroke Bose's yellow back? How many little eyes twinkled
                  sympathetically through the slats of the high-backed pews, as the tick of their
                  paws up and down the broad aisle announced that they were treating themselves to
                  that meditative locomotion allowed to good dogs in sermon-time!</p>
               <p>Surrounded by just such a community as I have described, my grandmother's gifts
                  never became rusty for want of exercise. Somebody always needed straightening up
                  and attending to. Somebody was to be exhorted, rebuked, or admonished, with all
                  long-suffering and doctrine; and it was cheering to behold, after years of labors
                  that had appeared to produce no very brilliant results on her disciples, how hale
                  and vigorous her faith yet remained in the power of talking to people. She seemed
                  to consider that evil-doers fell into sins and evils of all sorts merely for want
                  of somebody to talk to them, and would fly at some poor, idle, loafing, shiftless
                  object who staggered past her house from the tavern, with the same earnestness and
                  zeal for the fortieth time as if she had not exhorted him vainly for the
                  thirty-nine before.</p>
               <p>In fact, on this very Saturday afternoon, as I was coming down the hill, whence I
                  could see the mill and farm-house, I caught sight of her standing in the door,
                  with cap-border erect, and vigorous gesticulation, upbraiding a poor miserable dog
                  commonly called Uncle Eph, who stood swaying on the bridge, holding himself up by
                  the rails with drunken gravity, only answering her expostulations by shaking his
                  trembling fist at her, irreverently replying in every pause of her expostulation,
                  "You—darned—old sheep you!"</p>
               <p>"I do wonder now, mother, that you can't let Uncle Eph alone," said my Aunt Lois,
                  who was washing up the kitchen floor behind her. "What earthly good does it do to
                  be talking to him? He always has drank, and always will."</p>
               <p>"I can't help it," quoth my grandmother; "it 's a shame to him, and his wife lying
                  there down with rheumatism. I don't see how folks can do so."</p>
               <p>"And I don't see as it 's any of our business," said Aunt Lois. "What is it to us?
                  We are not our brother's keeper."</p>
               <p>"Well, it was Cain that said that to begin with," said my grandmother; "and I
                  think it's the spirit of Cain not to care what becomes of our neighbors!"</p>
               <p>"I can't help it if it is. I don't see the use of fussing and caring about what
                  you can't help. But there comes Horace Holyoke, to be sure. I suppose, mother, you
                  're sent for; I 've been expecting it all along.—Stand still there!" she called to
                  me as I approached the door, "and don't come in to track my floor."</p>
               <p>I stood without the door, therefore, and delivered my message;<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000016"/> and my grandmother promptly turned into her own
                  bedroom, adjoining the kitchen, to make herself ready to go. I stood without the
                  door, humbly waiting Aunt Lois's permission to enter the house.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Aunt Lois, "I suppose we 've got to have both boys down here
                  to-night. They 've got to come here, I suppose, and we may as well have 'em first
                  as last. It's just what I told Susy, when she would marry Horace Holyoke. I saw it
                  just as plain as I see it now, that we should have to take care of 'em. It's
                  aggravating, because Susy neglected her opportunities. She might have been Mrs.
                  Captain Shawmut, and had her carriage and horses, if she 'd only been a mind
                  to."</p>
               <p>"But," said my Aunt Keziah, who sat by the chimney, knitting,—"but if she could
                  n't love Captain Shawmut, and <emph>did</emph> love Horace Holyoke—"</p>
               <p>"Fiddlestick about that. Susy would 'a' loved him well enough if she 'd 'a'
                  married him. She 'd 'a' loved anybody that she married well enough,—she's one of
                  the kind; and he's turned out a very rich man, just as I told her. Susy was the
                  only handsome one in our family, and she might have done something with herself if
                  she 'd had sense."</p>
               <p>"For my part," said Aunt Keziah, "I can't blame people for following their hearts.
                  I never saw the money yet that would 'a' tempted <emph>me</emph> to marry the man
                  I did n't love."</p>
               <p>Poor Aunt Keziah had the reputation of being, on the whole, about the homeliest
                  woman in Oldtown. She was fat and ill-shapen and clumsy, with a pale, greenish
                  tinge to her complexion, watery, whitish-blue eyes, very rough thin hair, and
                  ragged, scrubby eyebrows. Nature had been peculiarly unkind to her; but far within
                  her ill-favored body she had the most exalted and romantic conceptions. She was
                  fond of reading Young's Night Thoughts, Mrs. Rowe's Meditations, and Sir Charles
                  Grandison, and always came out strong on the immaterial and sentimental side of
                  every question. She had the most exalted ideas of a lofty, disinterested devotion,
                  which she, poor soul! kept always simmering on a secret altar, ready to bestow on
                  some ideal hero, if ever he should call for it. But, alas! her want of external
                  graces prevented any such application. The princess was enchanted behind a hedge
                  of ragged and unsightly thorns.</p>
               <p>She had been my mother's aid and confidante in her love affair, and was therefore
                  regarded with a suppressed displeasure by Aunt Lois, who rejoined, smartly: "I
                  don't think, Kezzy, that you are likely to be tempted with offers of any sort; but
                  Susy did have 'em,—plenty of 'em,—and took Horace Holyoke when she might 'a' done
                  better. Consequence is, we've got to take her and her children home and take care
                  of 'em. It's just our luck. Your poor folks are the ones that are sure to have
                  children,—the less they have to give 'em, the more they have. I think, for my
                  part, that people that can't provide for children ought not to have 'em. Susy 's
                  no more fit to bring up those boys than a white kitten. There never was a great
                  deal to Susy," added Aunt Lois, reflectively, as, having finished the ablution of
                  the floor, she took the dish of white sand to sand it.</p>
               <p>"Well, for my part," said Aunt Kezzy, "I don't blame Susy a mite. Horace Holyoke
                  was a handsome man, and the Holyokes are a good family. Why, his grandfather was a
                  minister, and Horace certainly was a man of talents. Parson Lothrop said, if he 'd
                  'a' had early advantages, there were few men would have surpassed him. If he 'd
                  only been able to go to college."</p>
               <p>"And why was n't he able to go to college? Because he must needs get married. Now,
                  when people set out to do a thing, I like to see 'em do it. If he 'd a let Susy
                  alone and gone to college, I dare say he might have been distinguished, and all
                  that. I would n't have had the least objection. But no, nothing would do but he
                  must get married, and have two boys, and then study himself into his grave, and
                  leave 'em to us to take care of."</p>
               <p>"Well now, Lois," said my grandmother, coming out with her bonnet on, and her
                  gold-headed cane in her hand, "if I were you, I would n't talk so. What do you
                  always want to fight Providence for?"</p>
               <p>"Providence!" said my Aunt Lois, with a sniff. "I don't call it Providence. I
                  guess, if folks would behave themselves, Providence would let them alone."</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7953-00000017"/>
               <p>"Why, everything is ordered and foreordained," said Aunt Keziah.</p>
               <p>"Besides that," said my grandmother, setting down her stick hard on the floor,
                  "there 's no use in such talk, Lois. What 's done 's done; and if the Lord let it
                  be done, we may. We can't always make people do as we would. There 's no use in
                  being dragged through the world like a dog under a cart, hanging back and yelping.
                  What we must do, we may as well do willingly,—as well walk as be dragged. Now we
                  've got Susy and her children to take care of, and let 's do it. They 've got to
                  come here, and they shall come,—should come if there were forty-eleven more of 'em
                  than there be,—so now you just shut up."</p>
               <p>"Who said they should n't come?" said Aunt Lois. "I want to know now if I have n't
                  moved out of the front room and gone into the little back chamber, and scoured up
                  every inch of that front-room chamber on my hands and knees, and brought down the
                  old trundle-bed out of the garret and cleaned it up, on purpose to be all ready
                  for Susy and those children. If I have n't worked hard for them, I 'd like to have
                  any one tell me; and I don't see, for my part, why I should be scolded."</p>
               <p>"She was n't scolding you, Lois," said Aunt Keziah, pacifically.</p>
               <p>"She was, too; and I never open my mouth," said Lois, in an aggrieved tone, "that
                  you all don't come down on me. I'm sure I don't see the harm of wishing Susy had
                  married a man that could 'a' provided for her; but some folks feel so rich,
                  nothing comes amiss with 'em. I suppose we are able to send both boys to college,
                  and keep 'em like gentlemen, are n't we?"</p>
               <p>My grandmother had not had the benefit of this last volley, as she prudently left
                  the house the moment she had delivered herself of her reproof to Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>I was listening at the door with a troubled spirit. Gathering from the
                  conversation that my father and mother, somehow, had been improperly conducted
                  people, and that I and my brother Bill had no business to have been born, and that
                  our presence on the earth was, somehow or other, of the nature of an impertinence,
                  making everybody a vast deal of trouble. I could not bear to go in; and as I saw
                  my grandmother's stately steppings in the distance, I ran after her as fast as my
                  little bare feet could patter, and seized fast hold of her gown with the same
                  feeling that makes a chicken run under a hen.</p>
               <p>"Why, Horace," said my grandmother, "why did n't you stay down at the house?"</p>
               <p>"I did n't want to, grandma; please let me go with you."</p>
               <p>"You must n't mind Aunt Lois's talk,—she means well."</p>
               <p>I snuffled and persisted, and so had my own way, for my grandmother was as
                  soft-hearted to children as any of the meekest of the tribe who bear that revered
                  name; and so she did n't mind it that I slid back into the shadows of my father's
                  room, under cover of her ample skirts, and sat down disconsolate in a dark
                  corner.</p>
               <p>My grandmother brought to the sick-room a heavier responsibility than any mere
                  earthly interest could have laid on her. With all her soul, which was a very large
                  one, she was an earnest Puritan Calvinist. She had been nourished in the sayings
                  and traditions of the Mathers and the Eliots, and all the first generation of the
                  saints who had possessed Massachusetts. To these she had added the earnest study
                  of the writings of Edwards and Bellamy, and others of those brave old thinkers who
                  had broken up the crust of formalism and mechanical piety that was rapidly forming
                  over the New England mind.</p>
               <p>My remembrances of her are always as a reader. In her private chamber was always a
                  table covered with books; and though performing personally the greater share of
                  the labors of a large family, she never failed to have her quiet hour every
                  afternoon for reading. History and biography she delighted in, but she followed
                  with a keen relish the mazes of theology.</p>
               <p>During the days of my father's health and vigor, he had one of those erratic,
                  combative minds that delight in running logical tilts against received opinions,
                  and was skilled in finding the weak point in all assertions. My grandmother, who
                  believed with heart and soul and life-blood everything that she believed at all,
                  had more than once been worsted by him in arguments where her inconsiderate heat
                  outran her logic. These remembrances<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7953-00000018"/>
                  brances had pressed heavily on her soul during the time of his sickness, and she
                  had more than once earnestly sought to bring him to her ways of thinking,—ways
                  which to her view were the only possible or safe ones; but during his illness he
                  had put such conversation from him with the quick, irritable impatience of a sore
                  and wounded spirit.</p>
               <p>On some natures theology operates as a subtle poison; and the New England theology
                  in particular, with its intense clearness, its sharp-cut crystalline edges and
                  needles of thought, has had in a peculiar degree the power of lacerating the
                  nerves of the soul, and producing strange states of morbid horror and repulsion.
                  The great unanswerable questions which must perplex every thinking soul that
                  awakes to consciousness in this life are there posed with the severest and most
                  appalling distinctness. These awful questions underlie all religions,—they belong
                  as much to Deism as to the strictest orthodoxy,—in fact, they are a part of human
                  perception and consciousness, since it cannot be denied that Nature in her
                  teaching is a more tremendous and inexorable Calvinist than the Cambridge Platform
                  or any other platform that ever was invented.</p>
               <p>But in New England society, where all poetic forms, all the draperies and
                  accessories of religious ritual, have been rigidly and unsparingly retrenched,
                  there was nothing between the soul and these austere and terrible problems; it was
                  constantly and severely brought face to face with their infinite mystery. When my
                  grandmother came into the room, it was with an evident and deep emotion working in
                  her strong but plain features. She came up to the bed and grasped my father's hand
                  earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Well, mother," he said, "my time is come, and I have sent for you to put Susy and
                  the children into your hands."</p>
               <p>"I 'll take 'em and welcome,—you know that," said my grandmother heartily.</p>
               <p>"God bless you, mother,—I do know it," he said; "but do have a special eye on poor
                  little Horace. He has just my passion for books and study; and if he could be
                  helped to get an education, he might do what I have failed to do. I leave him my
                  books,—you will try and help him, mother?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my son, I will; but O my son, my son!" she added with trembling eagerness,
                  "how is it with you now? Are you prepared for this great change?"</p>
               <p>"Mother," he said in a solemn voice, yet speaking with a great effort, "no sane
                  man ever comes to my age, and to this place where I lie, without thinking a great
                  deal on all these things. I have thought,—God knows how earnestly,—but I cannot
                  talk of it. We see through a glass darkly here. There perhaps we shall see
                  clearly. You must be content to leave me where I leave myself,—in the hands of my
                  Creator. He can do no wrong"</p>

               <head type="sub">THE VILLAGE DO-NOTHING.</head>
               <p>"WAL naow, Horace, don't ye cry so. Why, I 'm railly concerned for ye. Why, don't
                  you s'pose your daddy's better off? Why, sartin <emph>I</emph> do. Don't cry,
                  there 's a good boy, now. I 'll give ye my jack-knife now."</p>
               <p>This was addressed to me the day after my father's death, while the preparations
                  for the funeral hung like a pall over the house, and the terror of the last cold
                  mystery, the tears of my mother, and a sort of bustling dreariness on the part of
                  my aunts and grandmother, all conspired to bear down on my childish nerves with
                  fearful power. It was a doctrine of those good old times, no less than of many in
                  our present days, that a house invaded by death should be made as forlorn as hands
                  could make it. It should be rendered as cold and stiff, as unnatural, as dead and
                  corpse-like as possible, by closed shutters, looking-glasses pinned up in white
                  sheets, and the locking up and hiding out of sight of any pleasant little familiar
                  object which would be thought out of place in a sepulchre. This work had been
                  driven through with unsparing vigor by Aunt Lois, who looked like one of the Fates
                  as she remorselessly cleared away every little familiar object belonging to my
                  father, and reduced every room to the shrouded stillness of a well-kept tomb.</p>
               <p>Of course no one thought of looking after me. It was not the fashion of those days
                  to think of children, if only they would take themselves off out of the way of the
                  movements of the grown people; and so I had run out into the orchard back of the
                  house, and, throwing myself down on my face under an apple-tree in the tall
                  clover, I gave myself up to despair, and was sobbing aloud in a nervous paroxysm
                  of agony, when these words were addressed to me. The speaker was a tall,
                  shambling, loose-jointed man, with a long, thin visage, prominent watery blue
                  eyes, very fluttering and seedy habiliments, who occupied the responsible position
                  of first do-nothing-in-ordinary in our village of Oldtown, and as such I must
                  introduce him to my readers' notice.</p>
               <p>Every New England village, if you only think of it, must have its do-nothing as
                  regularly as it has its school-house or meetinghouse. Nature is always wide awake
                  in the matter of compensation. Work, thrift, and industry are such an incessant
                  steam-power in Yankee life, that society would burn itself out with intense
                  friction were there not interposed here and there the lubricating power of a
                  decided do-nothing,—a man who won't be hurried, and won't work, and will take his
                  ease in his own way, in spite of the whole protest of his neighborhood to the
                  contrary. And there is on the face of the whole earth no do-nothing whose
                  softness, idleness, general inaptitude to labor, and everlasting, universal
                  shiftlessness can compare with that of this worthy, as found in a brisk Yankee
                  village.</p>
               <p>Sam Lawson filled this post with ample honor in Oldtown. He was a fellow dear to
                  the souls of all "us boys" in the village, because, from the special nature of his
                  position, he never had anything more pressing to do than croon and gossip with us.
                  He was ready to spend hours in tinkering a boy's jack-knife, or mending his skate,
                  or start at the smallest notice to watch at a woodchuck's hole, or give incessant
                  service in tending a dog's sprained paw. He was always on hand to go fishing with
                  us on Saturday afternoons; and I have known him to sit hour after hour on the
                  bank, surrounded by a troop of boys, baiting our hooks and taking off our fish. He
                  was a soft-hearted old body, and the wrigglings and contortions of our prey used
                  to disturb his repose so that it was a regular part of his work to kill the fish
                  by breaking their necks when he took them from the hook.</p>
               <p>"Why, lordy massy, boys," he would say, "I can't bear to see no kind o' critter in
                  torment. These 'ere pouts ain't to blame for bein' fish, and ye ought to put 'em
                  out of their misery. Fish hes their rights as well as any on us."</p>
               <p>Nobody but Sam would have thought of poking through the high grass and clover on
                  our back lot to look me up, as I lay sobbing<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000020"/> bing under the old apple-tree, the most
                  insignificant little atom of misery that ever bewailed the inevitable.</p>
               <p>Sam was of respectable family, and not destitute of education. He was an expert in
                  at least five or six different kinds of handicraft, in all of which he had been
                  pronounced by the knowing ones to be a capable workman, "if only he would stick to
                  it." He had a blacksmith's shop, where, when the fit was on him, he would shoe a
                  horse better than any man in the county. No one could supply a missing screw, or
                  apply a timely brace, with more adroitness. He could mend cracked china so as to
                  be almost as good as new; he could use carpenter's tools as well as a born
                  carpenter, and would doctor a rheumatic door or a shaky window better than half
                  the professional artisans in wood. No man could put a refractory clock to rights
                  with more ingenuity than Sam,—that is, if you would give him his time to be about
                  it.</p>
               <p>I shall never forget the wrath and dismay which he roused in my Aunt Lois's mind
                  by the leisurely way in which, after having taken our own venerable kitchen clock
                  to pieces, and strewn the fragments all over the kitchen, he would roost over it
                  in endless incubation, telling stories, entering into long-winded theological
                  discussions, smoking pipes, and giving histories of all the other clocks in
                  Oldtown, with occasional memoirs of those in Need-more, the North Parish, and
                  Podunk, as placidly indifferent to all her volleys of sarcasm and contempt, her
                  stinging expostulations and philippics, as the sailing old moon is to the frisky,
                  animated barking of some puppy dog of earth.</p>
               <p>"Why, ye see, Miss Lois," he would say, "clocks can't be druv; that's jest what
                  they can't. Some things can be druv, and then agin some things can't, and clocks
                  is that kind. They's jest got to be humored. Now this 'ere 's a 'mazin' good
                  clock; give me my time on it, and I 'll have it so 't will keep straight on to the
                  Millennium."</p>
               <p>"Millennium!" says Aunt Lois, with a snort of infinite contempt.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the Millennium," says Sam, letting fall his work in a contemplative manner.
                  "That 'ere 's an interestin' topic now. Parson Lothrop, he don't think the
                  Millennium will last a thousand years. What 's your 'pinion on that pint, Miss
                  Lois?"</p>
               <p>"My opinion is," said Aunt Lois, in her most nipping tones, "that if folks don't
                  mind their own business, and do with their might what, their hand finds to do, the
                  Millennium won't come at all."</p>
               <p>"Wal, you see, Miss Lois, it 's just here,—one day is with the Lord as a thousand
                  years, and a thousand years as one day."</p>
               <p>"I should think you thought a day was a thousand years, the way you work," said
                  Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"Wal," says Sam, sitting down with his back to his desperate litter of wheels,
                  weights, and pendulums, and meditatively caressing his knee as he watched the
                  sailing clouds in abstract meditation, "ye see, ef a thing 's ordained, why it 's
                  got to be, ef you don't lift a finger. That 'ere 's <emph>so</emph> now, ain't
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"Sam Lawson, you are about the most aggravating creature I ever had to do with.
                  Here you 've got our clock all to pieces, and have been keeping up a perfect
                  hurrah's nest in our kitchen for three days, and there you sit maundering and
                  talking with your back to your work, fussin' about the Millennium, which is none
                  of your business, or mine, as I know of! Do either put that clock together or let
                  it alone!"</p>
               <p>"Don't you be a grain uneasy, Miss Lois. Why, I 'll have your clock all right in
                  the end, but I can't be druv. Wal, I guess I 'll take another spell on 't
                  to-morrow or Friday."</p>
               <p>Poor Aunt Lois, horror-stricken, but seeing herself actually in the hands of the
                  imperturbable enemy, now essayed the tack of conciliation. "Now do, Lawson, just
                  finish up this job, and I 'll pay you down, right on the spot; and you need the
                  money."</p>
               <p>"I 'd like to 'blige ye, Miss Lois; but ye see money ain't everything in this
                  world. Ef I work tew long on one thing, my mind kind o' gives out, ye see; and
                  besides, I 've got some 'sponsibilities to 'tend to. There 's Mrs. Captain Brown,
                  she made me promise to come to-day and look at the nose o' that 'ere silver teapot
                  o' hern; it 's kind o' sprung a leak. And then I 'greed to split a little
                  oven-wood for the Widdah Pedee, that lives up on the Shelburn road. Must visit the
                  widdahs in their affliction, Scriptur' says. And then there 's Hepsy: she 's
                  allers a castin' it up at me that I don't do nothing for her and the chil'en;
                     but<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7953-00000021"/> then, lordy massy, Hepsy hain't no
                  sort o' patience. Why jest this mornin' I was a tellin' her to count up her
                  marcies, and I 'clare for 't if I did n't think she 'd a throwed the tongs at me.
                  That 'ere woman's temper railly makes me consarned. Wal, good day, Miss Lois. I
                  'll be along again to-morrow or Friday, or the first o' next week." And away he
                  went with long, loose strides down the village street, while the leisurely wail of
                  an old fuguing tune floated back after him,— <q>

                        <l>"Thy years are an</l>
                        <l>Etarnal day,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"An eternal torment," said Aunt Lois, with a snap. "I'm sure, if there 's a mortal
                  creature on this earth that I pity, it's Hepsy Lawson. Folks talk about her
                  scolding,—that Sam Lawson is enough to make the saints in Heaven fall from grace.
                  And you can't <emph>do</emph> anything with him: it 's like charging bayonet into
                  a woolsack."</p>
               <p>Now, the Hepsy thus spoken of was the luckless woman whom Sam's easy temper, and a
                  certain youthful reputation for being a capable fellow, had led years before into
                  the snares of matrimony with him, in consequence of which she was encumbered with
                  the bringing up of six children on very short rations. She was a gnarly, compact,
                  efficient little pepper-box of a woman, with snapping black eyes, pale cheeks, and
                  a mouth always at half-cock, ready to go off with some sharp crack of reproof at
                  the shoreless, bottomless, and tideless inefficiency of her husband. It seemed to
                  be one of those facts of existence that she could not get used to, nor find
                  anywhere in her brisk, fiery little body a grain of cool resignation for. Day
                  after day she fought it with as bitter and intense a vigor, and with as much
                  freshness of objurgation, as if it had come upon her for the first time,—just as a
                  sharp, wiry little terrier will bark and bark from day to day, with never-ceasing
                  pertinacity, into an empty squirrel-hole. She seemed to have no power within her
                  to receive and assimilate the great truth that her husband was essentially, and
                  was to be and always would be, only a do-nothing.</p>
               <p>Poor Hepsy was herself quite as essentially a do-something,—an early-rising,
                  bustling, driving, neat, efficient, capable little body,—who contrived, by going
                  out to day's works,—washing, scrubbing, cleaning,—by making vests for the tailor,
                  or closing and binding shoes for the shoemaker, by hoeing corn and potatoes in the
                  garden at most unseasonable hours, actually to find bread to put into the mouths
                  of the six young ravens aforesaid, and to clothe them decently. This might all do
                  very well; but when Sam—who believed with all his heart in the modern doctrines of
                  woman's rights so far as to have no sort of objection to Hepsy's sawing wood or
                  hoeing potatoes if she chose—would make the small degree of decency and prosperity
                  the family had attained by these means a text on which to preach resignation,
                  cheerfulness, and submission, then Hepsy's last cobweb of patience gave out, and
                  she often became, for the moment, really dangerous, so that Sam would be obliged
                  to plunge hastily out of doors to avoid a strictly personal encounter.</p>
               <p>It was not to be denied that poor Hepsy really was a scold, in the strong old
                  Saxon acceptation of the word. She had fought life single-handed, tooth and nail,
                  with all the ferocity of outraged sensibilities, and had come out of the fight
                  scratched and dishevelled, with few womanly graces. The good wives of the village,
                  versed in the outs and ins of their neighbors' affairs, while they admitted that
                  Sam was not all he should be, would sometimes roll up the whites of their eyes
                  mysteriously, and say, "But then, poor man, what could you expect when he has n't
                  a happy home? Hepsy's temper is, you know," etc., etc.</p>
               <p>The fact is, that Sam's softly easy temper and habits of miscellaneous handiness
                  caused him to have a warm corner in most of the households. No mothers ever are
                  very hard on a man who always pleases the children; and every one knows the
                  welcome of a universal gossip, who carries round a district a wallet of choice
                  bits of neighborhood information.</p>
               <p>Now Sam knew everything about everybody. He could tell Mrs. Major Broad just what
                  Lady Lothrop gave for her best parlor carpet, that was brought over from England,
                  and just on what occasions she used the big silver tankard, and on what they<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7953-00000022"/> were content with the little one, and how
                  many pairs of long silk stockings the minister had, and how many rows of stitching
                  there were on the shoulders of his Sunday shirts. He knew just all that was in
                  Deacon Badger's best room, and how many silver table-spoons and teaspoons graced
                  the beaufet in the corner; and when each of his daughters was born, and just how
                  Miss Susy came to marry as she did, and who wanted to marry her and could n't. He
                  knew just the cost of Major Broad's scarlet cloak and shoe-buckles, and how Mrs.
                  Major had a real <emph>Ingy</emph> shawl up in her "camphire" trunk, that cost
                  nigh as much as Lady Lothrop's. Nobody had made love, or married, or had children
                  born, or been buried, since Sam was able to perambulate the country, without his
                  informing himself minutely of every available particular; and his unfathomable
                  knowledge on these subjects was an unfailing source of popularity.</p>
               <p>Besides this, Sam was endowed with no end of idle accomplishments. His indolence
                  was precisely of a turn that enjoyed the excitement of an occasional odd bit of
                  work with which he had clearly no concern, and which had no sort of tendency
                  toward his own support or that of his family. Something so far out of the line of
                  practical utility as to be in a manner an artistic labor would awaken all the
                  energies of his soul. His shop was a perfect infirmary for decayed articles of
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">virtu</foreign> from all the houses for miles around.
                  Cracked china, lame tea-pots, broken shoe-buckles, rickety tongs, and decrepit
                  fire-irons, all stood in melancholy proximity, awaiting Sam's happy hours of
                  inspiration; and he was always happy to sit down and have a long, strictly
                  confidential conversation concerning any of these with the owner, especially if
                  Hepsy were gone out washing, or on any other work which kept her at a safe
                  distance.</p>
               <p>Sam could shave and cut hair as neatly as any barber, and was always in demand up
                  and down the country to render these offices to the sick. He was ready to go for
                  miles to watch with invalids, and a very acceptable watcher he made, beguiling the
                  night hours with endless stories and legends. He was also an expert in psalmody,
                  having in his youth been the pride of the village singing-school. In those days he
                  could perform reputably bly on the bass-viol in the choir of a Sunday with a
                  dolefulness and solemnity of demeanor in the highest degree edifying,—though he
                  was equally ready of a week-evening in scraping on a brisk little fiddle, if any
                  of the thoughtless ones wanted a performer at a husking or a quilting frolic.
                  Sam's obligingness was many-sided, and he was equally prepared at any moment to
                  raise a funeral psalm or whistle the time of a double-shuffle.</p>
               <p>But the more particular delight of Sam's heart was in funerals. He would walk
                  miles on hearing the news of a dangerous illness, and sit roosting on the fence of
                  the premises, delighted to gossip over the particulars, but ready to come down at
                  any moment to do any of the odd turns which sickness in a family makes necessary;
                  and when the last earthly scene was over, Sam was more than ready to render those
                  final offices from which the more nervous and fastidious shrink, but in which he
                  took almost a professional pride.</p>
               <p>The business of an undertaker is a refinement of modern civilization. In simple
                  old days neighbors fell into one another's hands for all the last wants of our
                  poor mortality; and there were men and women of note who took a particular and
                  solemn pride in these mournful offices. Sam had in fact been up all night in our
                  house, and having set me up in the clover, and comforted me with a jack-knife, he
                  proceeded to inform me of the particulars.</p>
               <p>"Why, ye see, Horace, I ben up with 'em pretty much all night; and I laid yer
                  father out myself, and I never see a better-lookin' corpse. It's a 'mazin' pity
                  your daddy hed such feelin's 'bout havin' people come to look at him, 'cause he
                  does look beautiful, and it's been a long time since we 've hed a funeral, anyway,
                  and everybody was expectin' to come to his 'n, and they'll all be dissipinted if
                  the corpse ain't show'd; but then, lordy massy, folks ought n't to think hard on't
                  ef folks hes their own way 'bout their own funeral. That 'ere's what I 've been a
                  tellin' on 'em all, over to the tavern and round to the store. Why, you never see
                  such a talk as there was about it. There was Aunt Sally Morse, and Betsey and
                  Patsy Sawin, and Mis' Zeruiah Bacon, come over early to look at the corpse, and
                  when they was n't<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7953-00000023"/> let in, you never heerd
                  sich a jawin'. Betsey and Patsy Sawin said that they allers suspected your father
                  was an infidel, or some sich, and now they was clear; and Aunt Sally, she asked
                  who made his shroud, and when she heerd there was n't to be none, he was laid out
                  in his clothes, she said she never heerd such unchristian doin's,—that she always
                  had heerd he had strange opinions, but she never thought it would come to
                  that."</p>
               <p>"My father is n't an infidel, and I wish I could kill 'em for talking so," said I,
                  clenching my jack-knife in my small fist, and feeling myself shake with
                  passion.</p>
               <p>"Wal, wal, I kind o' spoke up to 'em about it. I was n't a-goin' to hear no sich
                  jaw; and says I, 'I think ef there is any body that knows what's what about
                  funerals I'm the man, fur I don't s'pose there's a man in the county that's laid
                  out more folks, and set up with more corpses, and ben sent for fur and near, than
                  I have, and my opinion is that mourners must always follow the last directions
                  gi'n to 'em by the person. Ef a man has n't a right to have the say about his own
                  body, what hes he a right to?' Wal, they said that it was putty well of me to talk
                  so, when I had the privilege of sittin' up with him, and seein' all that was to be
                  seen. 'Lordy massy,' says I, 'I don't see why ye need envi me; 't ain't my fault
                  that folks thinks it 's agreeable to have me round. As to bein' buried in his
                  clothes, why, lordy massy, 't ain't nothin' so extraordinary. In the old country
                  great folks is very often laid out in their clothes. 'Member, when I was a boy,
                  old Mr. Sanger, the minister in Deerbrook, was laid out in his gown and bands,
                  with a Bible in his hands, and he looked as nateral as a pictur. I was at Parson
                  Rider's funeral, down to Wrentham. He was laid out in white flannel. But then
                  there was old Captain Bigelow, down to the Pint there, he was laid out regular in
                  his rigimentals, jest as he wore 'em in the war, epaulets and all.' Wal now,
                  Horace, your daddy looks jest as peaceful as a psalm-tune. Now, you don't
                  know,—jest as nateral as if he'd only jest gone to sleep. So ye may set your heart
                  at rest 'bout him."</p>
               <p>It was one of those beautiful serene days of October, when the earth lies as
                  bright and still as anything one can dream of in the New Jerusalem, and Sam's
                  homely expressions of sympathy had quieted me somewhat. Sam, tired of his
                  discourse, lay back in the clover, with his hands under his head, and went on with
                  his moralizing.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, Horace, to think on 't,—it's so kind o' solemnizin'! It's one's turn
                  to-day, and another's to-morrow. We never know when our turn 'll come." And Sam
                  raised a favorite stave,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"And must these active limbs of mine</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Lie moulderin' in the clay?"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Active limbs! I guess so!" said a sharp voice, which came through the
                  clover-heads like the crack of a rifle. "Well, I've found you at last. Here you
                  be, Sam Lawson, lyin' flat on your back at eleven o'clock in the morning, and not
                  a potato dug, and not a stick of wood cut to get dinner with; and I won't cut no
                  more if we never have dinner. It 's no use a humorin' you,—doin' your work for
                  you. The more I do, the more I may do; so come home, won't you?"</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, Hepsy," said Sam, slowly erecting himself out of the grass, and
                  staring at her with white eyes, "you don't ought to talk so. I ain't to blame. I
                  hed to sit up with Mr. Holyoke all night, and help 'em lay him out at four o'clock
                  this mornin'."</p>
               <p>"You 're always everywhere but where you've business to be," said Hepsy; "and
                  helpin' and doin' for everybody but your own. For my part, I think charity ought
                  to begin at home. You're everywhere, up and down and round,—over to Shelbun, down
                  to Podunk, up to North Parish; and here Abram and Kiah Stebbins have been waitin'
                  all the morning with a horse they brought all the way from Boston to get you to
                  shoe."</p>
               <p>"Wal now, that 'ere shows they know what's what. I told Kiah that ef they 'd bring
                  that 'ere hoss to me I 'd 'tend to his huffs."</p>
               <p>"And be off lying in the mowing, like a patridge, when they come after ye. That 's
                  one way to do business," said Hepsy.</p>
               <p>"Hepsy, I was just a miditatin'. Ef we don't miditate sometimes on all these 'ere
                  things, it'll be wus for us by and by."</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7953-00000024"/>
               <p>"Meditate! I'll help your meditations in a way you won't like, if you don't look
                  out. So now you come home, and stop your meditatin', and go to doin' somethin'. I
                  told 'em to come back this afternoon, and I'd have you on the spot if 't was a
                  possible thing," said the very practical Hepsy, laying firm hold of Sam's
                  unresisting arm, and leading him away captive.</p>
               <p>I stole into the darkened, silent room where my father had lain so long. Its
                  desolate neatness struck a chill to my heart. Not even a bottle remained of the
                  many familiar ones that used to cover the stand and the mantel-piece; but he,
                  lying in his threadbare Sunday coat, looked to me as I had often seen him in later
                  days, when he had come from school exhausted, and fallen asleep on the bed. I
                  crept to his side and nestled down on the floor as quietly as a dog lies down by
                  the side of his master.</p>

               <p>THE next day was the funeral, and I have little remembrance in it of anything but
                  what was dreary. Our Puritan ancestors, in the decision of their reaction from a
                  dead formalism, had swept away from the solemn crises of life every symbolic
                  expression; and this severe bareness and rigid restriction were nowhere more
                  striking than in funeral services, as conducted in these early times in
                  Massachusetts.</p>
               <p>There was at the house of mourning simply a prayer, nothing more; and then the
                  procession of relatives, friends, and townspeople walked silently to the grave,
                  where, without text, prayer, or hymn, the dust was forever given to its
                  fellow-dust. The heavy thud of the clods on the coffin, the rattling of spades,
                  and the fall of the earth, were the only voices that spoke in that final scene.
                  Yet that austere stillness was not without its majesty, since it might be
                  interpreted, not as the silence of indifference, but as the stillness of those
                  whose thoughts are too mighty for words. It was the silence of the unutterable.
                  From the grave my mother and her two boys were conducted to my grandfather's
                  house,—the asylum ever ready for the widowed daughter.</p>
               <p>The next day after was Sunday, and a Sunday full of importance in the view of Aunt
                  Lois, Aunt Keziah, and, in fact, of every one in the family. It was the custom, on
                  the first Sabbath after a bereavement, for the whole family circle to be present
                  together in church, to request, in a formal note, the prayers of the congregation
                  that the recent death might be sanctified to them. It was a point of honor for all
                  family connections to be present at this service, even though they should not
                  attend the funeral; and my Uncle Bill, a young Sophomore in Cambridge College, had
                  come down duly to be with us on the occasion. He was a joyous, spirited, jolly,
                  rollicking young fellow, not in the slightest<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000025"/> degree given to funereal reflections, and his
                  presence in the house always brought a certain busy cheerfulness which I felt to
                  lighten my darkness.</p>
               <p>One thing certainly had a tendency in that direction, which was that Aunt Lois was
                  always perceptibly ameliorated by Uncle Bill's presence. Her sharp, spare features
                  wore a relaxed and smiling aspect, her eyes had a softer light, and she belied her
                  own frequent disclaimer, that she never had any beauty, by looking almost
                  handsome.</p>
               <p>Poor Aunt Lois! I am afraid my reader will not do justice to her worth by the
                  specimens of her ways and words which I have given. Any one that has ever pricked
                  his fingers in trying to force open a chestnut-burr may perhaps have moralized at
                  the satin lining, so smooth and soft, that lies inside of that sharpness. It is an
                  emblem of a kind of nature very frequent in New England, where the best and
                  kindest and most desirable of traits are enveloped in an outside wrapping of sharp
                  austerity.</p>
               <p>No person rendered more deeds of kindness in the family and neighborhood than Aunt
                  Lois. She indeed bore the cares of the whole family on her heart; she watched and
                  prayed and fretted and scolded for all. Had she cared less, she might perhaps have
                  appeared more amiable. She <emph>invested</emph> herself, so to speak, in others;
                  and it was vital to her happiness, not only that they should be happy, but that
                  they should be happy precisely on her pattern and in her way. She had drawn out
                  the whole family chart, and if she had only had power to make each one walk
                  tractably in the path she foreordained, her sharp, thin face might have had a few
                  less wrinkles. It seemed to her so perfectly evident that the ways she fixed upon
                  for each one were ways of pleasantness and paths of peace, that she scarcely could
                  have patience with Providence for allowing things to fall out in a way so entirely
                  different from her designs.</p>
               <p>Aunt Lois was a good Christian, but she made that particular mistake in repeating
                  the Lord's Prayer which so many of us quite unconsciously do,—she always said,
                     <emph>My</emph> will be done, instead of Thy will. Not in so many words, of
                  course,—it was the secret inner voice of her essential nature that spoke and said
                  one thing, while her tongue said another. But then who can be sure enough of
                  himself in this matter, to cast the first stone at Aunt Lois?</p>
               <p>It was the fashion of the Calvinistic preaching of that time to put the doctrine
                  of absolute and unconditional submission to God in the most appalling forms, and
                  to exercise the conscience with most severe supposititious tests. After many
                  struggles and real agonies, Aunt Lois had brought herself to believe that she
                  would be willing to resign her eternal salvation to the Divine glory; that she
                  could consent to the eternal perdition of those on whom her heart was most
                  particularly set, were it God's will; and thus her self-will, as she supposed, had
                  been entirely annihilated, whereas it was only doubled back on itself, and ready
                  to come out with tenfold intensity in the unsuspected little things of this life,
                  where she looked less at Divine agency than human instrumentality. No law, as she
                  supposed, required her to submit to people's acting foolishly in their worldly
                  matters, particularly when she was able and willing to show them precisely how
                  they ought to act.</p>
               <p>Failing of a prosperous marriage for my mother, Aunt Lois's heart was next set
                  upon a college education for my Uncle Bill, the youngest and brightest of the
                  family. For this she toiled and economized in family labor, and eked it out by
                  vest-making at the tailor's, and by shoe-binding at the shoemaker's,—all that she
                  might have something to give to Bill for spending-money, to keep up his standing
                  respectably in college. Her antagonistic attitude toward my brother and myself
                  proceeded less from hardness of heart than from an anxious, worrying fear that we
                  should trench on the funds that at present were so heavily taxed to bring Uncle
                  Bill through college. Especially did she fear that my father had left me the
                  legacy of his own ungratified desire for an education, and that my grandmother's
                  indulgence and bountifulness might lead her to encourage me in some such
                  expectations, and then where was the money to come from? Aunt Lois foresaw
                  contingencies afar off. Not content with the cares of the present day and hour,
                  she dived far into the future, and carried all sorts of imaginary loads that would
                  come in suppositious<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7953-00000026"/> titious cases. As
                  the Christian by the eye of faith sees all sorts of possible good along the path
                  of future duty, so she by the eye of cautiousness saw every possible future evil
                  that could arise in every supposable contingency. Aunt Lois's friends often had
                  particular reason to wish that she cared less for them, for then, perhaps, she
                  might give them some peace. But nothing is so hopeless as your worthy domestic
                  house-dog, every hair of whose fur bristles with watchfulness, and who barks at
                  you incessantly from behind a most terrible intrenchment of faithful labors and
                  loving-kindnesses heaped up on your behalf.</p>
               <p>These dear good souls who wear their life out for you, have they not a right to
                  scold you, and dictate to you, and tie up your liberty, and make your life a
                  burden to you? If they have not, who has? If you complain, you break their worthy
                  old hearts. They insist on the privilege of seeking your happiness by thwarting
                  you in everything you want to do, and putting their will instead of yours in every
                  step of your life.</p>
               <p>Between Aunt Lois and my father there had been that constant antagonism which is
                  often perceptible between two human beings, each good enough in himself, but of a
                  quality to act destructively upon the other. A satin vest and a nutmeg-grater are
                  both perfectly harmless, and even worthy existences, but their close proximity on
                  a jolting journey is not to be recommended.</p>
               <p>My father never could bear my Aunt Lois in his house; and her presence had such an
                  instant effect in developing all the combative element in him, that really the
                  poor woman never saw him long enough under an agreeable aspect to enable her even
                  to understand why my mother should regard him with affection; and it is not to be
                  wondered at, therefore, that she was not a deep mourner at his death. She regarded
                  her sister's love for my father as an unfortunate infatuation, and was more
                  satisfied with the ways of Providence than she usually was, when its object was
                  withdrawn.</p>
               <p>It was according to all the laws of moral gravitation that, as soon as my father
                  died, my mother became an obedient satellite in Aunt Lois's orbit. She was one of
                  those dear, helpless little women, who, like flowers by the wayside, seem to be at
                  the disposal of the first strong hand that wants to gather them. She was made to
                  be ruled over; and so we all felt this first Sunday morning that we had come home
                  to be under the dominion of Aunt Lois. She put on my mother's mourning-bonnet and
                  tied it under her meek, unresisting chin, turning her round and round to get views
                  of her from different points, and arranging her ribbons and veil and pins as if
                  she had been a lay figure going to exhibition; and then she tied our collars, and
                  gave a final twitch to our jackets, and warned us not to pull out the pins from
                  the crape bands on our new hats, nor to talk and look round in meeting,
                  strengthening the caution with, "Just so sure as you do, there's Mr. Israel Scran,
                  the tithing-man, will come and take you and set you on the pulpit stairs."</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Israel Scran on week-days was a rather jolly, secular-looking individual,
                  who sat on the top of a barrel in his store, and told good stories; but Israel
                  Scran on Sundays was a tithing-man, whose eyes were supposed to be as a flame of
                  fire to search out little boys that played in meeting, and bring them to awful
                  retribution. And I must say that I shook in my shoes at the very idea of his
                  entering into judgment with me for any misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Going to church on the present occasion was rather a severe and awful ceremony to
                  my childish mind, second only to the dreary horror of the time when we stood so
                  dreadfully still around the grave, and heard those heavy clods thud upon the
                  coffin. I ventured a timid inquiry of my mother as to what was going to be done
                  there.</p>
               <p>Aunt Lois took the word out of her mouth. "Now, Horace, hush your talk, and don't
                  worry your mother. She's going to put up a note to be prayed for to-day, and we
                  are all going to join; so you be a good boy, and don't talk."</p>
               <p>Being good was so frequently in those days represented to me as synonymous with
                  keeping silence, that I screwed my little mouth up firmly as I walked along to the
                  meeting-house, behind my mother, holding my brother Bill's hand, and spoke not a
                  word, though he made several overtures towards conversation by<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000027"/> informing me that he saw a chipmunk, and that if it
                  was only Monday he 'd hit him smack; and also telling me that Sam Lawson had
                  promised to go pout-fishing with us on Tuesday, with other boy temporalities of a
                  nature equally worldly.</p>
               <p>The meeting-house to which our steps were tending was one of those huge,
                  shapeless, barn-like structures, which our fathers erected apparently as a part of
                  that well-arranged system by which they avoided all resemblance to those fair,
                  poetic ecclesiastical forms of the Old World, which seemed in their view as
                  "garments spotted by the flesh."</p>
               <p>The interior of it was revealed by the light of two staring rows of windows, which
                  let in the glare of the summer sun, and which were so loosely framed, that, in
                  wintry and windy weather, they rattled and shook, and poured in a perfect
                  whirlwind of cold air, which disported itself over the shivering audience.</p>
               <p>It was a part of the theory of the times never to warm these buildings by a fire;
                  and the legend runs that once in our meeting-house the communion was administered
                  under a temperature which actually froze the sacred elements while they were being
                  distributed. Many a remembrance of winter sessions in that old meeting-house rose
                  to my mind, in which I sat with my poor dangling feet perfectly numb and paralyzed
                  with cold, and blew my finger-ends to keep a little warmth in them, and yet I
                  never thought of complaining; for everybody was there,—mother, aunts, grandmother,
                  and all the town. We all sat and took our hardships in common, as a plain,
                  necessary fact of existence.</p>
               <p>Going to meeting, in that state of society into which I was born, was as necessary
                  and inevitable a consequence of waking up on Sunday morning as eating one's
                  breakfast. Nobody thought of staying away,—and, for that matter, nobody wanted to
                  stay away. Our weekly life was simple, monotonous, and laborious; and the chance
                  of seeing the whole neighborhood together in their best clothes on Sunday was a
                  thing which, in the dearth of all other sources of amusement, appealed to the
                  idlest and most unspiritual of loafers. They who did not care for the sermon or
                  the prayers wanted to see Major Broad's scarlet coat and laced ruffles, and his
                  wife's brocade dress, and the new bonnet which Lady Lothrop had just had sent up
                  from Boston. Whoever had not seen these would be out of society for a week to
                  come, and not be able to converse understandingly on the topics of the day.</p>
               <p>The meeting on Sunday united in those days, as nearly as possible, the whole
                  population of a town,—men, women, and children. There was then in a village but
                  one fold and one shepherd, and long habit had made the tendency to this one
                  central point so much a necessity to every one, that to stay away from "meetin'"
                  for any reason whatever was always a secret source of uneasiness. I remember in my
                  early days, sometimes when I had been left at home by reason of some of the
                  transient ailments of childhood, how ghostly and supernatural the stillness of the
                  whole house and village outside the meeting-house used to appear to me, how loudly
                  the clock ticked and the flies buzzed down the window-pane, and how I listened in
                  the breathless stillness to the distant psalm-singing, the solemn tones of the
                  long prayer, and then to the monotone of the sermon, and then again to the closing
                  echoes of the last hymn, and thought sadly, what if some day I should be left out,
                  when all my relations and friends had gone to meeting in the New Jerusalem, and
                  hear afar the music from the crystal walls.</p>
               <p>As our Sunday gathering at meeting was a complete picture of the population of our
                  village, I shall, as near as possible, daguerreotype our Sunday audience, as the
                  best means of placing my readers in sympathy with the scene and actors of this
                  history.</p>
               <p>The arrangement of our house of worship in Oldtown was somewhat peculiar, owing to
                  the fact of its having originally been built as a mission church for the Indians.
                  The central portion of the house, usually appropriated to the best pews, was in
                  ours devoted to them; and here were arranged benches of the simplest and most
                  primitive form, on which were collected every Sunday the thin and wasted remnants
                  of what once was a numerous and powerful tribe. There were four or five
                  respectable Indian families, who owned comfortable farms in the neighborhood, and
                  came to meeting in their farm-wagons, like any of their white neighbors.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7953-00000028"/>
               <p>Conspicuous among these, on the front bench, facing the pulpit, sat the Indian
                  head-magistrate, Justice Waban,—tall and erect as an old pine-tree, and of a grave
                  and reverend aspect. Next to him was seated the ecclesiastical superior of that
                  portion of the congregation, Deacon Ephraim. Mild, intelligent, and devout, he was
                  the perfect model of the praying Indian formed in the apostolic traditions of the
                  good Eliot. By his side sat his wife, Keturah, who, though she had received
                  Christian baptism, still retained in most respects the wild instincts and untamed
                  passions of the savage. Though she attended church and allowed her children to be
                  baptized, yet, in spite of minister, elder, and tithing-man, she obstinately held
                  on to the practice of many of her old heathen superstitions.</p>
               <p>Old Keturah was one of the wonders of my childhood. She was spoken of among the
                  gossips with a degree of awe, as one who possessed more knowledge than was good
                  for her; and in thunder-storms and other convulsions of nature she would sit in
                  her chimney-corner and chant her old Indian incantations, to my mingled terror and
                  delight. I remember distinctly three syllables that occurred very
                  often,—"ah-mah-ga, ah-mah-ga,"—sometimes pronounced in wild, plaintive tones, and
                  sometimes in tones of menace and denunciation. In fact, a century before, Keturah
                  must have had a hard time of it with her Christian neighbors; but our minister was
                  a gentleman and a scholar, and only smiled benignly when certain elderly ladies
                  brought him terrible stories of Keturah's proceedings.</p>
               <p>Next to Keturah was seated Deborah Kummacher, an Indian woman, who had wisely
                  forsaken the unprofitable gods of the wild forest, and taken to the Christian
                  occupation of fruit-growing, and kept in nice order a fruit farm near my
                  grandfather's, where we children delighted to resort in the season, receiving from
                  her presents of cherries, pears, peaches, or sweet apples, which she informed us
                  she was always ready to give to good children who said their prayers and made
                  their manners when they came into her house. Next behind her came Betty Poganut,
                  Patty Pegan, and old Sarah Wonsamug,—hard-visaged, high-cheek-boned females, with
                  snaky-black eyes, principally remarkable, in my mind, for the quantity of cider
                  they could drink. I had special reason to remember this, as my grandmother's house
                  was their favorite resort, and drawing cider was always the work of the youngest
                  boy.</p>
               <p>Then there was Lem Sudock, a great, coarse, heavy-moulded Indian, with gigantic
                  limbs and a savage face, but much in request for laying stone walls, digging
                  wells, and other tasks for which mere physical strength was the chief requisite.
                  Beside him was Dick Obscue, a dull, leering, lazy, drinking old fellow, always as
                  dry as an empty sponge, but with an endless capacity for imbibing. Dick was of a
                  class which our modern civilization would never see inside of a church, though he
                  was in his seat in our meeting-house as regularly as any of the deacons; but on
                  week-days his principal employment seemed to be to perambulate the country, making
                  stations of all the kitchen firesides, where he would tell stories, drink cider,
                  and moralize, till the patience or cider-pitchers of his hosts ran dry, when he
                  would rise up slowly, adjust his old straw hat, hitch up his dangling nether
                  garments a little tighter, and, with a patronizing nod, say, "Wal, naow, 'f you
                  can spare me I'll go."</p>
               <p>Besides our Indian population, we had also a few negroes, and a side gallery was
                  appropriated to them. Prominent there was the stately form of old Boston Foodah,
                  an African prince, who had been stolen from the coast of Guinea in early youth,
                  and sold in Boston at some period of antiquity whereto the memory of man runneth
                  not. All the Oldtown people, and their fathers and grandfathers, remembered old
                  Boston just as he then existed, neither older nor younger. He was of a majestic
                  stature, slender and proudly erect, and perfectly graceful in every movement, his
                  woolly hair as white as the driven snow. He was servant to General Hull in the
                  Revolutionary war, and at its close was presented by his master with a full suit
                  of his military equipments, including three-cornered hat, with plume, epaulets,
                  and sword. Three times a year,—at the spring training, the fall muster, and on
                  Thanksgiving day,—Boston arrayed himself in full panoply, and walked forth a
                  really striking and magnificent object. In the eyes of us boys, on these days,
                     he<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7953-00000029"/> was a hero, and he patronized us
                  with a condescension which went to our hearts. His wife, Jinny, was a fat,
                  roly-poly little body, delighting in red and yellow bonnets, who duly mustered
                  into meeting a troop of black-eyed, fat, woolly-headed little negroes, whom she
                  cuffed and disciplined during sermon-time with a matronly ferocity designed to
                  show white folks that she was in earnest in their religious training.</p>
               <p>Near by was old Primus King, a gigantic, retired whaleman, black as a coal, with
                  enormous hands and feet, universally in demand in all the region about as
                  assistant in butchering operations.</p>
               <p>Besides these, let me not forget dear, jolly old Cæsar, my grandfather's own
                  negro, the most joyous creature on two feet. What could not Cæsar do? He could
                  gobble like a turkey so perfectly as to deceive the most experienced old gobbler
                  on the farm; he could crow so like a cock that all the cocks in the neighborhood
                  would reply to him; he could mew like a cat, and bark like a dog; he could sing
                  and fiddle, and dance the double-shuffle, and was <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au
                     fait</foreign> in all manner of jigs and hornpipes; and one need not wonder,
                  therefore, that old Cæsar was hugged and caressed and lauded by me in my childhood
                  as the most wonderful of men.</p>
               <p>There were several other colored families, of less repute, who also found seats in
                  the negro gallery. One of them was that of Aunt Nancy Prime, famous for making
                  election-cake and ginger-pop, and who was sent for at all the great houses on
                  occasions of high festivity, as learned in all mysteries relating to the
                  confection of cakes and pies. A tight, trig, bustling body she, black and polished
                  as ebony, smooth-spoken and respectful, and quite a favorite with everybody. Nancy
                  had treated herself to an expensive luxury in the shape of a husband,—an idle,
                  worthless mulatto man, who was owned as a slave in Boston. Nancy bought him by
                  intense labors in spinning flax, but found him an undesirable acquisition, and was
                  often heard to declare, in the bitterness of her soul, when he returned from his
                  drinking bouts, that she should never buy another nigger, she knew.</p>
               <p>The only thing she gained by this matrimonial speculation was an abundant crop of
                  noisy children, who, as she often declared, nearly wore the life out of her. I
                  remember once, when I was on a visit to her cottage, while I sat regaling myself
                  with a slice of cake, Nancy lifted the trap-door which went down into the cellar
                  below. Forthwith the whole skirmishing tribe of little darkies, who had been
                  rolling about the floor, seemed suddenly to unite in one coil, and, with a final
                  flop, disappeared in the hole. Nancy gave a kick to the door, and down it went;
                  when she exclaimed, with a sigh of exhausted patience, "Well, now then, I hope
                  you'll be still a minute, anyway!"</p>
               <p>The houses of the colored people formed a little settlement by themselves in the
                  north part of the village, where they lived on most amicable terms with all the
                  inhabitants.</p>
               <p>In the front gallery of the meeting-house, opposite the pulpit, was seated the
                  choir of the church. The leader of our music was old Mump Morse, a giant of a man,
                  in form not unlike a cider-hogshead, with a great round yellow head, and a voice
                  like the rush of mighty winds, who was wont to boast that he could chord with
                  thunder and lightning better than any man in the parish. Next to him came our
                  friend Sam Lawson, whose distinguishing peculiarity it was, that he could strike
                  into any part where his voice seemed most needed; and he often showed the
                  miscellaneous nature of his accomplishments by appearing as tenor, treble, or
                  counter, successively, during the rendering of one psalm. If we consider that he
                  also pitched the tunes with his pitch-pipe, and played on his bass-viol, we shall
                  see increasing evidence of that versatility of genius for which he was
                  distinguished.</p>
               <p>Another principal bass-singer was old Joe Stedman, who asserted his democratic
                  right to do just as he had a mind to by always appearing every Sunday in a clean
                  leather apron of precisely the form he wore about his weekly work. Of course all
                  the well-conducted upper classes were scandalized, and Joe was privately
                  admonished of the impropriety, which greatly increased his satisfaction, and
                  caused him to regard himself as a person of vast importance. It was reported that
                  the minister had told him that there was more pride in his leather apron than in
                     Captain<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7953-00000030"/> Browne's scarlet cloak; but
                  Joe settled the matter by declaring that the apron was a matter of conscience with
                  him, and of course after that there was no more to be said.</p>
               <p>These leading characters, with a train of young men and maidens who practised in
                  the weekly singing-school, used to conduct the musical devout exercises much to
                  their own satisfaction, if not always to that of our higher circle.</p>
               <p>And now, having taken my readers through the lower classes in our meeting-house, I
                  must, in order of climax, represent to them our higher orders.</p>
               <p>Social position was a thing in those days marked by lines whose precision and
                  distinctness had not been blurred by the rough handling of democracy.
                  Massachusetts was, in regard to the aroma and atmosphere of her early days, an
                  aristocratic community. The seeds of democratic social equality lay as yet
                  ungerminated in her soil. The State was a garden laid out with the old formal
                  parallelograms and clipped hedges of princely courts and titled ranks, but sown
                  with seeds of a new and rampant quality, which were destined to overgrow them
                  all.</p>
               <p>Even our little town had its court circle, its House of Lords and House of
                  Commons, with all the etiquette and solemn observances thereto appertaining. At
                  the head stood the minister and his wife, whose rank was expressed by the pew next
                  the pulpit. Then came Captain Browne, a retired English merchant and ship-owner,
                  who was reported to have ballasted himself with a substantial weight of worldly
                  substance. Captain Browne was a tall, upright, florid man, a little on the shady
                  side of life, but carrying his age with a cheerful greenness. His long, powdered
                  locks hung in a well-tended queue down his back, and he wore a scarlet coat, with
                  a white vest and stock, and small-clothes, while long silk stockings with knee and
                  shoe buckles of the best paste, sparkling like real diamonds, completed his
                  attire. His wife rustled by his side in brocade which might almost stand alone for
                  stiffness, propped upon heels that gave a majestic altitude to her tall, thin
                  figure.</p>
               <p>Next came the pew of Miss Mehitable Rossiter, who, in right of being the only
                  surviving member of the family of the former minister, was looked upon with
                  reverence in Oldtown, and took rank decidedly in the Upper House, although a very
                  restricted and limited income was expressed in the quality of her attire. Her
                  Sunday suit in every article spoke of ages past, rather than of the present hour.
                  Her laces were darned, though still they were laces; her satin gown had been
                  turned and made over, till every possible capability of it was exhausted; and her
                  one Sunday bonnet exhibited a power of coming out in fresh forms, with each
                  revolving season, that was quite remarkable, particularly as each change was
                  somewhat odder than the last. But still, as everybody knew that it was Miss
                  Mehitable Rossiter, and no meaner person, her queer bonnets and dyed gowns were
                  accepted as a part of those inexplicable dispensations of the Providence that
                  watches over the higher classes, which are to be received by faith alone.</p>
               <p>In the same pew with Miss Mehitable sat Squire Jones, once, in days of colonial
                  rule, rejoicing in the dignity of Sheriff of the County. During the years of the
                  Revolutionary war, he had mysteriously vanished from view, as many good Tories
                  did; but now that the new social status was well established, he suddenly
                  reappeared in the neighborhood, and took his place as an orderly citizen,
                  unchallenged and unquestioned. It was enough that the Upper House received him.
                  The minister gave him his hand, and Lady Lothrop courtesied to him, and called on
                  his wife, and that, of course, settled the manner in which the parish were to
                  behave; and, like an obedient flock, they all jumped the fence after their
                  shepherd. Squire Jones, besides, was a well-formed, well-dressed man, who lived in
                  a handsome style, and came to meeting in his own carriage; and these are social
                  virtues not to be disregarded in any well-regulated community.</p>
               <p>There were certain well-established ranks and orders in social position in
                  Oldtown, which it is important that I should distinctly define. People who wore
                  ruffles round their hands, and rode in their own coaches, and never performed any
                  manual labor, might be said to constitute in Oldtown our House of Lords,—and they
                  might all have been counted on two or three of my fingers. It was, in fact,
                  confined to the personages already<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7953-00000031"/>
                  enumerated. There were the minister, Captain Browne, and Sheriff Jones.</p>
               <p>But below these, yet associating with them on terms of strict equality, were a
                  more numerous body of Commons,—men of substance and influence, but who tilled the
                  earth with their own hands, or pursued some other active industrial calling.</p>
               <p>Distinguished among these, sitting in the next pew to the Sheriff, was Major
                  Broad, a practical farmer, who owned a large and thriving farm of the best New
                  England type, and presented that true blending of the laboring man and the
                  gentleman which is nowhere else found. He had received his military rank for
                  meritorious services in the late Revolutionary war, and he came back to his native
                  village with that indefinable improvement in air and manner which is given by the
                  habits of military life. With us he owed great prestige to a certain personal
                  resemblance to General Washington which he was asserted to have by one of our
                  townsfolk, who had often seen him and the General on the same field, and who sent
                  the word abroad in the town that whoever wanted to know how General Washington
                  looked had only to look upon Major Broad. The Major was too much of a real man to
                  betray the slightest consciousness of this advantage, but it invested him with an
                  air of indefinable dignity in the eyes of all his neighbors, especially those of
                  the lower ranks.</p>
               <p>Next came my grandfather's family pew; and in our Oldtown House of Commons I
                  should say that none stood higher than he. In his Sunday suit my grandfather was
                  quite a well-made, handsome man. His face was marked by grave, shrewd reflection,
                  and a certain gentle cast of humor, which rarely revealed itself even in a
                  positive smile, and yet often made me feel as if he were quietly and interiorly
                  smiling at his own thoughts. His well-brushed Sunday coat and small-clothes, his
                  bright knee and shoe buckles, his long silk stockings, were all arranged with a
                  trim neatness refreshing to behold. His hair, instead of being concealed by a wig,
                  or powdered and tied in a queue, after the manner of the aristocracy, fell in long
                  curls on his shoulders, and was a not unbecoming silvery frame to the placid
                  picture of his face. He was a man by nature silent and retiring, indisposed to
                  anything thing like hurry or tumult, rather easy and generously free in his
                  business habits, and quietly sanguine in his expectations. In point of material
                  possessions he was reputed well to do, as he owned a large farm and two mills, and
                  conducted the business thereof with a quiet easiness which was often exceedingly
                  provoking to my grandmother and Aunt Lois. No man was more popular in the
                  neighborhood, and the confidence of his fellow-townsmen was yearly expressed in
                  town-meeting by his reappointment to every office of trust which he could be
                  induced to accept. He was justice of the peace, deacon of the church,
                  selectman,—in short, enjoyed every spiritual and temporal office by the bestowal
                  of which his fellow-men could express confidence in him. This present year,
                  indeed, he bore the office of tithing-man, in association with Mr. Israel Scran.
                  It had been thought that it would be a good thing, in order to check the
                  increasing thoughtlessness of the rising generation in regard to Sunday-keeping,
                  to enlist in this office an authority so much respected as Deacon Badger; but the
                  manner in which he performed its duties was not edifying to the minds of strictly
                  disposed people. The Deacon in his official capacity was expected to stalk forth
                  at once as a terror to evil-doers, whereas he seemed to have no capacity for
                  terrifying anybody. When a busy individual informed him that this or that young
                  person was to be seen walking out in the fields, or picking flowers in their
                  gardens of a Sabbath afternoon, the Deacon always placidly answered that he had
                  n't seen them; from which the ill-disposed would infer that he looked another way,
                  of set purpose, and the quiet internal smile that always illuminated the Deacon's
                  face gave but too much color to this idea.</p>
               <p>In those days the great war of theology which has always divided New England was
                  rife, and every man was marked and ruled as to his opinions, and the theologic
                  lines passed even through the conjugal relation, which often, like everything
                  else, had its Calvinistic and its Arminian side.</p>
               <p>My grandfather was an Arminian, while my grandmother was, as I have said, an
                  earnest, ardent Calvinist. Many were the controversies I have overheard between
                  them, in which the texts<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7953-00000032"/> of Scripture
                  flew thick and fast, until my grandfather at last would shut himself up in that
                  final fortress of calm and smiling silence which is so provoking to feminine
                  ardor. There intrenched, he would look out upon his assailants with a quiet,
                  imperturbable good-humor which quite drove them to despair.</p>
               <p>It was a mystery to my grandmother how a good man, as she knew my grandfather to
                  be, <emph>could</emph> remain years unmoved in the very hearing of such
                  unanswerable arguments as she had a thousand times brought up, and still, in the
                  very evening of his days, go on laying his serene old head on an Arminian pillow!
                  My grandfather was a specimen of that class of men who can walk amid the opinions
                  of their day, encircled by a halo of serene and smiling individuality which
                  quarrels with nobody, and, without shocking any one's prejudices, preserves intact
                  the liberty of individual dissent. He silently went on thinking and doing exactly
                  as he pleased, and yet was always spoken of as the <emph>good</emph> Deacon. His
                  calm, serene, benignant figure was a sort of benediction as he sat in his pew of a
                  Sunday; and if he did not see the little boys that played, or, seeing them, only
                  smilingly brought them to a sense of duty by passing them a head of fennel through
                  the slats of the pews, still Deacon Badger was reckoned about the best man in the
                  world.</p>
               <p>By the side of my grandfather sat his eldest born, Uncle Jacob, a hale, thrifty
                  young farmer, who, with his equally hale and thrifty wife, was settled on a
                  well-kept farm at some distance from ours. Uncle Jacob was a genuine son of the
                  soil, whose cheeks were ruddy as clover, and teeth as white as new milk. He had
                  grown up on a farm, as quietly as a tree grows, and had never been ten miles from
                  his birthplace. He was silent, contented, and industrious. He was in his place to
                  be prayed for as one of a bereaved family, of course, this morning; but there was
                  scarcely more capability of mourning in his plump, healthy body than there is in
                  that of a well-fed, tranquil steer. But he took his weekly portion of religion
                  kindly. It was the thing to do on Sunday, as much as making hay or digging
                  potatoes on Monday. His wife by his side displayed no less the aspect of calm,
                  respectable, well-to-do content. Her Sunday bonnet was without spot, her Sunday
                  gown without wrinkle; and she had a great bunch of fennel in her
                  pocket-handkerchief, which, from time to time, she imparted to us youngsters with
                  a benevolent smile.</p>
               <p>Far otherwise was the outward aspect of my grandmother's brother, Eliakim Sheril.
                  He was a nervous, wiry, thin, dry little old man, every part of whose body
                  appeared to be hung together by springs that were in constant vibration. He had
                  small, keen black eyes, a thin, sharp hooked nose, which he was constantly
                  buffeting, and blowing, and otherwise maltreating, in the fussy uneasiness which
                  was the habit of the man.</p>
               <p>Uncle 'Liakim was a man known as Uncle to all the village,—the kindest-souled,
                  most untiringly benevolent, single-hearted old body that could be imagined; but
                  his nervous activity was such as to have procured among the boys a slight change
                  in the rendering of his name, which was always popularly given as Uncle Fliakim,
                  and, still more abbreviated, Uncle Fly.</p>
               <p>"Can you tell me where Mr. Sheril is," says an inquirer at the door of my
                  grandfather's mill.</p>
               <p>"If you want to find 'Liakim," says my grandfather, with his usual smile, "never
                  go after him,—you'll never catch him; but stand long enough on any one spot on
                  earth, and he's sure to go by."</p>
               <p>Uncle 'Liakim had his own particular business,—the overseeing of a soap and candle
                  factory; but, besides that; he had on his mind the business of everybody else in
                  town,—the sorrows of every widow, the lonely fears of every spinster, the
                  conversion of every reprobate, the orthodoxy of every minister, the manners and
                  morals of all the parish,—all of which caused him to be up early and down late,
                  and flying about confusedly at all hours, full of zeal, full of kindness,
                  abounding in suggestions, asking questions the answers to which he could not stop
                  to hear, making promises which he did not remember, and which got him into no end
                  of trouble with people who did, telling secrets, and letting innumerable cats out
                  of countless bags, to the dismay and affright of all reserved and well-conducted
                  people. Uncle Fliakim, in fact, might be regarded in our village of Oldtown as a
                  little brown pudding-stick that kept us in a perpetual stir. To be<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000033"/> sure, it was a general stir of loving-kindness and
                  good intentions, yet it did not always give unlimited satisfaction.</p>
               <p>For instance, some of the more strictly disposed members of the congregation were
                  scandalized that Uncle Fliakim, every stormy Sunday, nearly destroyed the
                  solemnity of the long prayer by the officious zeal which he bestowed in getting
                  sundry forlorn old maids, widows, and other desolate women to church. He had a
                  horse of that immortal species well known in country villages,—made of whalebone
                  and india-rubber, with a long neck, a hammer-head, and one blind eye,—and a wagon
                  which rattled and tilted and clattered in every part, as if infected with a double
                  portion of its owner's spirits; and, mounting in this, he would drive miles in the
                  rain or the snow, all for the pleasure of importing into the congregation those
                  dry, forlorn, tremulous specimens of female mortality which abound in every
                  village congregation.</p>
               <p>Uncle Fliakim had been talked to on this subject, and duly admonished. The
                  benevolence of his motives was allowed; but why, it was asked, must he always
                  drive his wagon with a bang against the doorstep just as the congregation rose to
                  the first prayer? It was a fact that the stillness which followed the words, "Let
                  us pray," was too often broken by the thump of the wagon and the sound, "Whoa,
                  whoa! take care, there!" from without, as Uncle Fly's blind steed rushed headlong
                  against the meeting-house door, as if he were going straight in, wagon and all;
                  and then there would be a further most unedifying giggle and titter of
                  light-minded young men and damsels when Aunt Bathsheba Sawin and Aunt Jerusha
                  Pettibone, in their rusty black-crape bonnets, with their big black fans in their
                  hands, slowly rustled and creaked into their seats, while the wagon and Uncle
                  'Liakim were heard giggiting away. Then the boys, if the tithing-man was not
                  looking at them, would bet marbles whether the next load would be old Mother Chris
                  and Phœbe Drury, or Hetty Walker and old Mother Hopestill Loker.</p>
               <p>It was a great offence to all the stricter classes that Uncle Fly should demean
                  his wagon by such an unedifying character as Mother Hopestill Loker; for, though
                  her name intimated that she ought to have charity, still she was held no better
                  than a publican and sinner; and good people in those days saw the same impropriety
                  in such people having too much to do with reputable Christians that they used to
                  years ago in a country called Palestine.</p>
               <p>For all these reasons Uncle Fliakim was often dealt with as one of good
                  intentions, but wanting the wisdom which is profitable to direct. One year his
                  neighbors thought to employ his superfluous activity by appointing him
                  tithing-man; and great indeed in this department were his zeal and activity; but
                  it was soon found that the dear man's innocent sincerity of heart made him the
                  prey of every village good-for-naught who chose to take him in. All the naughty
                  boys in town were agog with expectancy when Joe Valentine declared, with a wink,
                  that he 'd drive a team Sunday right by Uncle Fly's house, over to Hopkinton, with
                  his full consent. Accordingly, the next Sunday he drove leisurely by, with a
                  solemn face and a broad weed on his hat. Uncle Fly ran panting, half dressed, and
                  threw himself distractedly on the neck of the horse. "My young friend, I cannot
                  permit it. You must turn right back."</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," said Joe, "have n't you heard that my mother is lying dead in
                  Hopkinton at this very moment?"</p>
               <p>"Is it possible?" said my uncle, with tears in his eyes. "I beg your pardon. I had
                  n't heard it. Proceed, by all means. I'm sorry I interrupted you."</p>
               <p>The next morning wicked Joe careered by again. "Good morning, Mr. Sheril. I s'pose
                  you know my mother's been lying dead these five years; but I'm equally obliged for
                  your politeness."</p>
               <p>Vain was Uncle Fly's indignation. Greater men than he have had to give up before
                  the sovereign power of a laugh, and erelong he resigned the office of tithing-man
                  as one requiring a sterner metal than he possessed. In fact, an unsavory
                  character, who haunted the tavern and was called by the boys Old Mopshear, gave a
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">résumé</foreign> of his opinions of tithing-men as seen
                  from the camp of the enemy.</p>
               <p>"Old Deacon Badger," he said, "was always lookin' 't other<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000034"/> way, and never saw nothin' 't' was goin' on. But
                  there was Uncle Fliakim,—wal, to be sure the gals could n't tie up their shoes
                  without he was a lookin'; but then, come to railly doin' anythin', it was only a
                  snap, and he was off agin. He wa' n't much more 'n a middlin'-sized grasshopper,
                  arter all. Tell you what," said Mopshear, "it takes a fellow like Israel Scran,
                  that knows what he's about, and 's got some <emph>body</emph> to do with. When old
                  Jerusalem Ben swore he'd drive the stage through the town a Sunday, I tell you it
                  was fun to see Israel Scran. He jest stood out by the road and met the hosses
                  smack, and turned 'em so quick that the stage flopped over like a wink, and Ben
                  was off rolling over and over in the sand. Ben got the wust on 't that time. I
                  tell you, it takes Israel Scran to be tithing-man!"</p>
               <p>Good Uncle Fliakim had made himself extremely busy in my father's last sickness,
                  dodging out of one door and in at another, at all hours; giving all manner of
                  prescriptions for his temporal and spiritual state, but always in too much of a
                  hurry to stop a minute,—a consideration which, I heard my father say, was the only
                  one which made him tolerable. But, after all, I liked him, though he invariably
                  tumbled over me, either in coming into or going out of the house, and then picked
                  me up and gave me a cent, and went on rejoicing. The number of cents I acquired in
                  this way became at last quite a little fortune.</p>
               <p>But time would fail me to go on and describe all the quiddities and oddities of
                  our Sunday congregation. Suffice it to say, that we all grew in those days like
                  the apple-trees in our back lot. Every man had his own quirks and twists, and
                  threw himself out freely in the line of his own individuality; and so a rather
                  jerky, curious, original set of us there was. But such as we were, high and low,
                  good and bad, refined and illiterate, barbarian and civilized, negro and white,
                  the old meeting-house united us all on one day of the week, and its solemn
                  services formed an insensible but strong bond of neighborhood charity.</p>
               <p>We may rail at Blue Laws and Puritan strictness as much as we please, but
                  certainly those communities where our fathers carried out their ideas fully had
                  their strong points; and, rude and primitive as our meeting-houses were, this
                  weekly union of all classes in them was a most powerful and efficient means of
                  civilization. The man or woman cannot utterly sink who on every seventh day is
                  obliged to appear in decent apparel, and to join with all the standing and
                  respectability of the community in a united act of worship.</p>
               <p>Nor were our Sunday services, though simple, devoid of their solemn forms. The
                  mixed and motley congregation came in with due decorum during the ringing of the
                  first bell, and waited in their seats the advent of the minister. The tolling of
                  the bell was the signal for him that his audience were ready to receive him, and
                  he started from his house. The clerical dress of the day, the black silk gown, the
                  spotless bands, the wig and three-cornered hat and black gloves, were items of
                  professional fitness which, in our minister's case, never failed of a due
                  attention. When, with his wife leaning on his arm, he entered at the door of the
                  meeting-house, the whole congregation rose and remained reverently standing until
                  he had taken his seat in the pulpit. The same reverential decorum was maintained
                  after service was over, when all remained standing and uncovered while the
                  minister and his family passed down the broad aisle and left the house. Our
                  fathers were no man-worshippers, but they regarded the minister as an ambassador
                  from the great Sovereign of the universe, and paid reverence to Him whose word he
                  bore in their treatment of him.</p>
               <p>On the Sunday following the funeral of any one in the parish, it was customary to
                  preach a sermon having immediate reference to the event which had occurred, in the
                  course of which the nearest friends and relatives were directly addressed, and
                  stood up in their seats to receive the pastoral admonition and consolation. I
                  remember how wan and faded, like a shimmering flower, my poor mother rose in her
                  place, while I was forcibly held down by Aunt Lois's grasp on my jacket till the
                  "orphan children" were mentioned, when I was sent up on my feet with an impetus
                  like a Jack in a box; and afterward the whole family circle arose and stood, as
                  the stream of admonition and condolence became more general. We were reminded that
                  the God of the widow and orphan never dies,—that this life is the shadow, and<pb
                     n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7953-00000035"/> the life to come the substance,—that
                  there is but one thing needful,—that as our departed friend is to-day, so we may
                  all be to-morrow; and then the choir sung, to the tune of old Darwen, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Shall man, O God of life and light,</l>

               </p>
               <p>I cannot say much for our country psalmody. Its execution was certainly open to
                  severe criticism; and Uncle Fliakim, on every occasion of especial solemnity,
                  aggravated its peculiarities by tuning up in a high, cracked voice a weird part,
                  in those days called "counter," but which would in our days insure his being taken
                  out of the house as a possessed person. But, in spite of all this, those old
                  minor-keyed funeral hymns in which our fathers delighted always had a quality in
                  them that affected me powerfully. The music of all barbarous nations is said to be
                  in the minor key, and there is in its dark combinations something that gives
                  piercing utterance to that undertone of doubt, mystery, and sorrow by which a
                  sensitive spirit always is encompassed in this life.</p>
               <p>I was of a peculiarly sensitive organization; my nerves shivered to every touch,
                  like harp-strings. What might have come over me had I heard the solemn chants of
                  cathedrals, and the deep pulsations of the old organ-hearts that beat there, I
                  cannot say, but certain it is that the rude and primitive singing in our old
                  meeting-house always excited me powerfully. It brought over me, like a presence,
                  the sense of the infinite and eternal, the yearning and the fear and the desire of
                  the poor finite being, so ignorant and so helpless. I left the church lifted up as
                  if walking on air, with the final words of the psalm floating like an illuminated
                  cloud around me,— <q>

               <head type="sub">FIRE-LIGHT TALKS IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S KITCHEN.</head>
               <p>MY grandmother's kitchen was a great, wide, roomy apartment, whose white-sanded
                  floor was always as clean as hands could make it. It was resplendent with the
                  sheen of a set of scoured pewter plates and platters, which stood arranged on a
                  dresser on one side. The great fireplace swept quite across another side. There we
                  burned cord-wood, and the fire was built up on architectural principles known to
                  those days. First came an enormous back-log, rolled in with the strength of two
                  men, on the top of which was piled a smaller log; and then a fore-stick, of a size
                  which would entitle it to rank as a log in our times, went to make the front
                  foundation of the fire. The rearing of the ample pile thereupon was a matter of no
                  small architectural skill, and all the ruling members of our family circle had
                  their own opinions about its erection, which they maintained with the zeal and
                  pertinacity which become earnest people. My grandfather, with his grave smile,
                  insisted that he was the only reasonable fire-builder of the establishment; but
                  when he had arranged his sticks in the most methodical order, my grandmother would
                  be sure to rush out with a thump here and a twitch there, and divers incoherent
                  exclamations tending to imply that men never knew how to build a fire. Frequently
                  her intense zeal for immediate effect would end in a general rout and roll of the
                  sticks in all directions, with puffs of smoke down the chimney, requiring the
                  setting open of the outside door; and then Aunt Lois would come to the rescue,
                  and, with a face severe with determination, tear down the whole structure and
                  rebuild from the foundation with exactest precision, but with an air that cast
                  volumes of contempt on all that had gone before. The fact is, that there is no
                  little nook of domestic life which gives snug harbor to so much self-will and
                  self-righteousness as the family hearth; and<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000036"/> this is particularly the case with wood fires,
                  because, from the miscellaneous nature of the material, and the sprightly activity
                  of the combustion, there is a constant occasion for tending and alteration, and so
                  a vast field for individual opinion.</p>
               <p>We had come home from our second Sunday service. Our evening meal of smoking brown
                  bread and baked beans had been discussed, and the supper-things washed and put out
                  of sight. There was an uneasy, chill moaning and groaning out of doors, showing
                  the coming up of an autumn storm,—just enough chill and wind to make the
                  brightness of a social hearth desirable,—and my grandfather had built one of his
                  most methodical and splendid fires.</p>
               <p>The wide, ample depth of the chimney was aglow in all its cavernous length with
                  the warm leaping light that burst out in lively jets and spirts from every rift
                  and chasm. The great black crane that swung over it, with its multiplicity of
                  pot-hooks and trammels, seemed to have a sort of dusky illumination, like that of
                  old Cæsar's black, shining face, as he sat on his block of wood in the deep recess
                  of the farther corner, with his hands on the knees of his Sunday pantaloons,
                  gazing lovingly into the blaze with all the devotion of a fire-worshipper. On
                  week-day evenings old Cæsar used to have his jack-knife in active play in this
                  corner, and whistles and pop-guns and squirrel-traps for us youngsters grew under
                  his plastic hand; but on Sunday evening he was too good a Christian even to think
                  of a jack-knife, and if his hand casually encountered it in his pocket, he
                  resisted it as a temptation of the Devil, and sat peacefully winking and blinking,
                  and occasionally breaking out into a ripple of private giggles which appeared to
                  spring purely from the overflow of bodily contentment. My Uncle Bill was in that
                  condition which is peculiarly apt to manifest itself in the youth of
                  well-conducted families on Sunday evenings,—a kind of friskiness of spirits which
                  appears to be a reactionary state from the spiritual tension of the day, inclining
                  him to skirmish round on all the borders and outskirts of permitted pleasantry,
                  and threatening every minute to burst out into most unbecoming uproariousness.
                  This state among the youngsters of a family on Sunday evening is a familiar trial
                  of all elders who have had the task of keeping them steady during the sacred
                  hours.</p>
               <p>My Uncle Bill, in his week-day frame, was the wit and buffoon of the family,—an
                  adept in every art that could shake the sides, and bring a laugh out on the
                  gravest face. His features were flexible, his powers of grimace and story-telling
                  at times irresistible. On the present occasion it was only my poor mother's pale,
                  sorrowful face that kept him in any decent bounds. He did not wish to hurt his
                  sister's feelings, but he was boiling over with wild and elfish impulses, which he
                  vented now by a sly tweak at the cat's tail, then by a surreptitious dig at black
                  Cæsar's sides, which made the poor black a helpless, quivering mass of giggle, and
                  then he would slyly make eyes and mouths at Bill and me behind Aunt Lois's chair,
                  which almost slew us with laughter, though all the while he appeared with painful
                  effort to keep on a face of portentous gravity.</p>
               <p>On the part of Aunt Lois, however, there began to be manifested unequivocal
                  symptoms that it was her will and pleasure to have us all leave our warm fireside
                  and establish ourselves in the best room,—for we had a best room, else wherefore
                  were we on tea-drinking terms with the high aristocracy of Oldtown? We had our
                  best room, and kept it as cold, as uninviting and stately, as devoid of human
                  light or warmth, as the most fashionable shut-up parlor of modern days. It had the
                  tallest and brightest pair of brass andirons conceivable, and a shovel and tongs
                  to match, that were so heavy that the mere lifting them was work enough, without
                  doing anything with them. It had also a bright-varnished mahogany tea-table, over
                  which was a looking-glass in a gilt frame, with a row of little architectural
                  balls on it; which looking-glass was always kept shrouded in white muslin at all
                  seasons of the year, on account of a tradition that flies might be expected to
                  attack it for one or two weeks in summer. But truth compels me to state, that I
                  never saw or heard of a fly whose heart could endure Aunt Lois's parlor. It was so
                  dark, so cold, so still, that all that frisky, buzzing race, who delight in air
                  and sunshine, universally deserted and seceded from it; yet the looking-glass, and
                  occasionally the fire-irons, were rigorously shrouded, as if desperate attacks
                  might any moment be expected.</p>
               <p>Now the kitchen was my grandmother's own room. In one<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000037"/> corner of it stood a round table with her favorite
                  books, her great work-basket, and by it a rickety rocking-chair, the bottom of
                  which was of ingenious domestic manufacture, being in fact made by interwoven
                  strips of former coats and pantaloons of the home circle; but a most comfortable
                  and easy seat it made. My grandfather had also a large splint-bottomed arm-chair,
                  with rockers to it, in which he swung luxuriously in the corner of the great
                  fire-place. By the side of its ample blaze we sat down to our family meals, and
                  afterwards, while grandmother and Aunt Lois washed up the tea-things, we all sat
                  and chatted by the firelight. Now it was a fact that nobody liked to sit in the
                  best room. In the kitchen each member of the family had established unto him or
                  her self some little pet private snuggery, some chair or stool, some individual
                  nook,—forbidden to gentility, but dear to the ungenteel natural heart,—that we
                  looked back to regretfully when we were banished to the colder regions of the best
                  room.</p>
               <p>There the sitting provisions were exactly one dozen stuffed-seated cherry chairs,
                  with upright backs and griffin feet, each foot terminating in a bony claw, which
                  resolutely grasped a ball. These chairs were high and slippery, and preached
                  decorum in the very attitudes which they necessitated, as no mortal could ever
                  occupy them except in the exercise of a constant and collected habit of mind.</p>
               <p>Things being thus, when my Uncle Bill saw Aunt Lois take up some coals on a
                  shovel, and look towards the best-room door, he came and laid his hand on hers
                  directly, with, "Now, Lois, what are you going to do?"</p>
               <p>"Going to make up a fire in the best room."</p>
               <p>"Now, Lois, I protest. You're not going to do any such thing. Hang grandeur and
                  all that. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>''Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,</l>
                        <l>Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home,'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> you know; and home means right here by mother's kitchen-fire, where she and
                  father sit, and want to sit. You know nobody ever wants to go into that terrible
                  best room of yours."</p>
               <p>"Now, Bill, how you talk!" said Aunt Lois, smiling, and putting down her
                  shovel.</p>
               <p>"But then, you see," she said, the anxious cloud again settling down on her
                  brow,—"you see, we're exposed to calls, and who knows who may come in? I should
                  n't wonder if Major Broad, or Miss Mehitable, might drop in, as they saw you down
                  from College."</p>
               <p>"Let 'em come; never fear. They all know we've got a best room, and that's enough.
                  Or, if you'd rather, I'll pin a card to that effect upon the door; and then we'll
                  take our ease. Or, better than that, I'll take 'em all in and show 'em our best
                  chairs, andirons, and mahogany table, and then we can come out and be
                  comfortable."</p>
               <p>"Bill, you're a saucy boy," said Aunt Lois, looking at him indulgently as she
                  subsided into her chair.</p>
               <p>"Yes, that he always was," said my grandfather, with a smile of the kind that
                  fathers give to frisky sophomores in college.</p>
               <p>"Well, come sit down, anyway," said my grandmother, "and let's have a little
                  Sunday-night talk."</p>
               <p>"Sunday-night talk, with all my heart," said Bill, as he seated himself
                  comfortably right in front of the cheerful blaze. "Well, it must be about 'the
                  meetin',' of course. Our old meeting-house looks as elegant as ever. Of all the
                  buildings I ever saw to worship any kind of a being in, that meeting-house
                  certainly is the most extraordinary. It really grows on me every time I come
                  home!"</p>
               <p>"Come, now, Bill," said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"Come, now! Ain't I coming? Have n't said anything but what you all know. Said our
                  meeting-house was extraordinary, and you all know it is; and there's extraordinary
                  folks in it. I don't believe so queer a tribe could be mustered in all the land of
                  Israel as we congregate. I hope some of our oddities will be in this evening after
                  cider. I need to study a little, so that I can give representations of nature in
                  our club at Cambridge. Nothing like going back to nature, you know. Old Obscue,
                  seems to me, was got up in fine fancy this morning; and Sam Lawson had an extra
                  touch of the hearse about him. Hepsy must have been disciplining him this morning,
                  before church. I always know when Sam is fresh from a matrimonial<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000038"/> visitation: he's peculiarly pathetic about the
                  gills at those times. Why don't Sam come in here?"</p>
               <p>"I'm sure I hope he won't," said Aunt Lois. "One reason why I wanted to sit in the
                  best room to-night was that every old tramper and queer object sees the light of
                  our kitchen fire, and comes in for a lounge and a drink; and then, when one has
                  genteel persons calling, it makes it unpleasant."</p>
               <p>"O, we all know you're aristocratic, Lois; but, you see, you can't be indulged.
                  You must have your purple and fine linen and your Lazarus at the gate come
                  together some time, just as they do in the meeting-house and the graveyard. Good
                  for you all, if not agreeable."</p>
               <p>Just at this moment the conversation was interrupted by a commotion in the back
                  sink-room, which sounded much like a rush of a flight of scared fowl. It ended
                  with a tumble of a row of milk-pans toward chaos, and the door flew open and Uncle
                  Fly appeared.</p>
               <p>"What on earth!" said my grandmother, starting up. "That you, 'Liakim? Why on
                  earth <emph>must</emph> you come in the back way and knock down all my
                  milk-pans?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I came 'cross lots from Aunt Bathsheba Sawin's," said Uncle Fly, dancing in,
                  "and I got caught in those pesky blackberry-bushes in the graveyard, and I do
                  believe I've torn my breeches all to pieces," he added, pirouetting and frisking
                  with very airy gyrations, and trying vainly to get a view of himself behind, in
                  which operation he went round and round as a cat does after her tail.</p>
               <p>"Laws a-massy, 'Liakim!" said my grandmother, whose ears were startled by a
                  peculiar hissing sound in the sink-room, which caused her to spring actively in
                  that direction. "Well, now, you have been and done it! You've gone and fidgeted
                  the tap out of my beer-barrel, and here's the beer all over the floor. I hope
                  you're satisfied now."</p>
               <p>"Sorry for it. Did n't mean to. I'll wipe it right up. Where's a towel, or
                  floor-cloth, or something?" cried Uncle Fly, whirling in more active circles round
                  and round, till he seemed to me to have a dozen pairs of legs.</p>
               <p>"Do sit down, 'Liakim," said my grandmother. "Of course you did n't mean to; but
                  next time don't come bustling and whirligigging through my back sink-room after
                  dark. I do believe you never will be quiet till you're in your grave."</p>
               <p>"Sit down, uncle," said Bill. "Never mind mother,—she'll come all right by and by.
                  And never mind your breeches,—all things earthly are transitory, as Parson Lothrop
                  told us to-day. Now let's come back to our Sunday talk. Did ever anybody see such
                  an astonishing providence as Miss Mehitable Rossiter's bonnet to-day? Does it
                  belong to the old or the new dispensation, do you think?"</p>
               <p>"Bill, I'm astonished at you!" said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"Miss Mehitable is of a most respectable family," said Aunt Keziah, reprovingly.
                  "Her father and grandfather and great-grandfather were all ministers; and two of
                  her mother's brothers, Jeduthun and Amariah."</p>
               <p>"Now, take care, youngster," said Uncle Fly. "You see you young colts must n't be
                  too airy. When a fellow begins to speak evil of bonnets, nobody knows where he may
                  end."</p>
               <p>"Bless me, one and all of you," said Bill, "I have the greatest respect for Miss
                  Mehitable. Furthermore, I like her. She's a real spicy old concern. I'd rather
                  talk with her than any dozen of modern girls. But I do wish she'd give me that
                  bonnet to put in our Cambridge cabinet. I'd tell 'em it was the wing of a
                  Madagascar bat. Blessed old soul, how innocent she sat under it!—never knowing to
                  what wandering thoughts it was giving rise. Such bonnets interfere with my
                  spiritual progress."</p>
               <p>At this moment, by the luck that always brings in the person people are talking
                  of, Miss Mehitable came in, with the identical old wonder on her head. Now,
                  outside of our own blood-relations, no one that came within our doors ever
                  received a warmer welcome than Miss Mehitable. Even the children loved her, with
                  that instinctive sense by which children and dogs learn the discerning of spirits.
                  To be sure she was as gaunt and brown as the Ancient Mariner, but hers was a style
                  of ugliness that was neither repulsive nor vulgar. Personal uncomeliness has its
                  differing characters, and there are some very<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000039"/> homely women who have a style that amounts to
                  something like beauty. I know that this is not the common view of the matter; but
                  I am firm in the faith that some very homely women have a certain attraction about
                  them which is increased by their homeliness. It is like the quaintness of Japanese
                  china,—not beautiful, but having a strong, pronounced character, as far remote as
                  possible from the ordinary and vulgar, and which, in union with vigorous and
                  agreeable traits of mind, is more stimulating than any mere insipid beauty.</p>
               <p>In short, Miss Mehitable was a specimen of what I should call the good-goblin
                  style of beauty. And people liked her so much that they came to like the
                  singularities which individualized her from all other people. Her features were
                  prominent and harsh; her eyebrows were shaggy, and finished abruptly half across
                  her brow, leaving but half an eyebrow on each side. She had, however, clear,
                  trustworthy, steady eyes, of a greenish gray, which impressed one with much of
                  that idea of steadfast faithfulness that one sees in the eyes of some good, homely
                  dogs. "Faithful and true," was written in her face as legibly as eyes could write
                  it.</p>
               <p>For the rest, Miss Mehitable had a strong mind, was an omnivorous reader, apt,
                  ready in conversation, and with a droll, original way of viewing things, which
                  made her society ever stimulating. To me her house was always full of delightful
                  images,—a great, calm, cool, shady, old-fashioned house, full of books and of
                  quaint old furniture, with a garden on one side where were no end of lilies,
                  hollyhocks, pinks, and peonies, to say nothing of currants, raspberries, apples,
                  and pears, and other carnal delights, all of which good Miss Mehitable was free to
                  dispense to her child-visitors. It was my image of heaven to be allowed to go to
                  spend an afternoon with Miss Mehitable, and establish myself, in a shady corner of
                  the old study which contained her father's library, over an edition of Æsop's
                  Fables illustrated with plates, which, opened, was an endless field of enchantment
                  to me.</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable lived under the watch and charge of an ancient female domestic
                  named Polly Shubel. Polly was a representative tive specimen of the now extinct
                  species of Yankee serving-maids. She had been bred up from a child in the Rosseter
                  family of some generations back. She was of that peculiar kind of constitution,
                  known in New England, which merely becomes drier and tougher with the advance of
                  time, without giving any other indications of old age. The exact number of her
                  years was a point unsettled even among the most skilful genealogists of Oldtown.
                  Polly was a driving, thrifty, doctrinal and practical female, with strong bones
                  and muscles, and strong opinions, believing most potently in early rising, soap
                  and sand, and the Assembly's Catechism, and knowing <emph>certainly</emph> all
                  that she did know. Polly considered Miss Mehitable as a sort of child under her
                  wardship, and conducted the whole business of life for her with a sovereign and
                  unanswerable authority. As Miss Mehitable's tastes were in the world of books and
                  ideas, rather than of physical matters, she resigned herself to Polly's sway with
                  as good a grace as possible, though sometimes she felt that it rather abridged her
                  freedom of action.</p>
               <p>Luckily for my own individual self, Polly patronized me, and gave me many a piece
                  of good advice, sweetened with gingerbread, when I went to visit Miss Rossiter. I
                  counted Miss Mehitable among my personal friends; so to-night, when she came in, I
                  came quickly and laid hold of the skirt of her gown, and looked admiringly upon
                  her dusky face, under the portentous shadow of a great bonnet shaded by nodding
                  bows of that preternatural color which people used to call olive-green. She had a
                  word for us all, a cordial grasp of the hand for my mother, who sat silent and
                  thoughtful in her corner, and a warm hand-shake all round.</p>
               <p>"You see," she said, drawing out an old-fashioned snuff-box, and tapping upon it,
                  "my house grew so stupid that I must come and share my pinch of snuff with you.
                  It's windy out to-night, and I should think a storm was brewing; and the rattling
                  of one's own window-blinds, as one sits alone, is n't half so amusing as some
                  other things."</p>
               <p>"You know, Miss Rossiter, we're always delighted to have you come in," said my
                  grandmother, and my Aunt Lois, and my Aunt Keziah, all at once. This, by the way,
                  was a little domestic<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7953-00000040"/> trick that the
                  females of our family had; and, as their voices were upon very different keys, the
                  effect was somewhat peculiar. My Aunt Lois's voice was high and sharp, my
                  grandmother's a hearty chest-tone, while Aunt Keziah's had an uncertain buzz
                  between the two, like the vibrations of a loose string; but as they all had
                  corresponding looks and smiles of welcome, Miss Mehitable was pleased.</p>
               <p>"I always indulge myself in thinking I am welcome," she said. "And now pray how is
                  our young scholar, Master William Badger? What news do you bring us from old
                  Harvard?"</p>
               <p>"Almost anything you want to hear, Miss Mehitable. You know that I am your most
                  devoted slave."</p>
               <p>"Not so sure of that, sir," she said, with a whimsical twinkle of her eye. "Don't
                  you know that your sex are always treacherous? How do I know that you don't serve
                  up old Miss Rossiter when you give representations of the Oldtown curiosities
                  there at Cambridge? We are a set here that might make a boy's fortune in that
                  line,—now are n't we?"</p>
               <p>"How do you know that I do serve up Oldtown curiosities?" said Bill, somewhat
                  confused, and blushing to the roots of his hair.</p>
               <p>"How do I know? Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? and
                  can you help being a mimic, as you were born, always were and always will be?"</p>
               <p>"O, but I'm sure, Miss Mehitable, Bill never would,—he has too much respect," said
                  Aunt Keziah and Aunt Lois, simultaneously again.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not; but if he wants to, he 's welcome. What are queer old women for, if
                  young folks may not have a good laugh out of them now and then? If it's only a
                  friendly laugh, it's just as good as crying, and better too. I'd like to be made
                  to laugh at myself. I think generally we take ourselves altogether too seriously.
                  What now, bright eyes?" she added, as I nestled nearer to her. "Do you want to
                  come up into an old woman's lap? Well, here you come. Bless me, what a tangle of
                  curls we have here! Don't your thoughts get caught in these curls sometimes?"</p>
               <p>I looked bashful and wistful at this address, and Miss Mehitable went on twining
                  my curls around her fingers, and trotting me on her knee, lulling me into a
                  delicious dreaminess, in which she seemed to me to be one of those nice,
                  odd-looking old fairy women that figure to such effect in stories.</p>
               <p>The circle all rose again as Major Broad came in. Aunt Lois thought, with evident
                  anguish, of the best room. Here was the Major, sure enough, and we all sitting
                  round the kitchen fire! But my grandfather and grandmother welcomed him cheerfully
                  to their corner, and enthroned him in my grandfather's splint-bottomed
                  rocking-chair, where he sat far more comfortably than if he had been perched on a
                  genteel, slippery-bottomed stuffed chair with claw feet.</p>
               <p>The Major performed the neighborly kindnesses of the occasion in an easy way. He
                  spoke a few words to my mother of the esteem and kindness he had felt for my
                  father, in a manner that called up the blood into her thin cheeks, and made her
                  eyes dewy with tears. Then he turned to the young collegian, recognizing him as
                  one of the rising lights of Oldtown.</p>
               <p>"Our only nobility now," he said to my grandfather. "We've cut off everything
                  else: no distinction now, sir, but educated and uneducated."</p>
               <p>"It is a hard struggle for our human nature to give up titles and ranks, though,"
                  said Miss Mehitable. "For my part, I have a ridiculous kindness for them yet. I
                  know it's all nonsense; but I can't help looking back to the court we used to have
                  at the Government House in Boston. You know it was something to hear of the goings
                  and doings of my Lord this and my Lady that, and of Sir Thomas and Sir Peter and
                  Sir Charles, and all the rest of 'em."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Bill; "the Oldtown folks call their minister's wife Lady yet."</p>
               <p>"Well, that's a little comfort," said Miss Mehitable; "one don't want life an
                  entire dead level. Do let us have one titled lady among us."</p>
               <p>"And a fine lady she is," said the Major. "Our parson did a good thing in that
                  alliance."</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7953-00000041"/>
               <p>While the conversation was thus taking a turn of the most approved genteel style,
                  Aunt Keziah's ears heard alarming premonitory sounds outside the door. "Who 's
                  that at the scraper?" said she.</p>
               <p>"O, it 's Sam Lawson," said Aunt Lois, with a sort of groan. "You may be sure of
                  that."</p>
               <p>"Come in, Sam, my boy," said Uncle Bill, opening the door. "Glad to see you."</p>
               <p>"Wal now, Mr. Badger," said Sam, with white eyes of veneration, "I 'm real glad to
                  see ye. I telled Hepsy you 'd want to see me. You 're the fust one of my Saturday
                  arternoon fishin' boys that 's got into college, and I 'm 'mazing proud on 't. I
                  tell you I walk tall,—ask 'em if I don't, round to the store."</p>
               <p>"You always were gifted in that line," said Bill. "But come, sit down in the
                  corner and tell us what you 've been about."</p>
               <p>"Wal, you see, I thought I'd jest go over to North Parish this arternoon, jest for
                  a change, like, and I wanted to hear one of them <emph>Hopkintinsians</emph> they
                  tell so much about; and Parson Simpson, he 's one on 'em."</p>
               <p>"You ought not to be roving off on Sunday, leaving your own meeting," said my
                  grandfather.</p>
               <p>"Wal, you see, Deacon Badger, I 'm interested in these 'ere new doctrines. I met
                  your Polly a goin' over, too," he said to Miss Mehitable.</p>
               <p>"O yes," said Miss Mehitable, "Polly is a great Hopkinsian. She can hardly have
                  patience to sit under our Parson Lothrop's preaching. It's rather hard on me,
                  because Polly makes it a point of conscience to fight every one of his discourses
                  over to me in my parlor. Somebody gave Polly an Arminian tract last Sunday,
                  entitled, 'The Apostle Paul an Arminian.' It would have done you good to hear
                  Polly's comments. ''Postle Paul an Arminian! He's the biggest 'lectioner of 'em
                  all.'"</p>
               <p>"That he is," said my grandmother, warmly. "Polly's read her Bible to some
                  purpose."</p>
               <p>"Well, Sam, what did you think of the sermon?" said Uncle Bill.</p>
               <p>"Wal," said Sam, leaning over the fire, with his long, bony hands alternately
                  raised to catch the warmth, and then dropped with an utter laxness, when the
                  warmth became too pronounced, "Parson Simpson's a smart man; but, I tell ye, it's
                  kind o' discouragin'. Why, he said our state and condition by natur was just like
                  this. We was clear down in a well fifty feet deep, and the sides all round nothin'
                  but glare ice; but we was under immediate obligations to get out, 'cause we was
                  free, voluntary agents. But nobody ever had got out, and nobody would, unless the
                  Lord reached down and took 'em. And whether he would or not nobody could tell; it
                  was all sovereignty. He said there wa' n't one in a hundred,—not one in a
                  thousand,—not one in ten thousand,—that would be saved. Lordy massy, says I to
                  myself, ef that's so they 're any of 'em welcome to my chance. And so I kind o'
                  ris up and come out, 'cause I'd got a pretty long walk home, and I wanted to go
                  round by South Pond, and inquire about Aunt Sally Morse's toothache."</p>
               <p>"I heard the whole sermon over from Polly," said Miss Mehitable, "and as it was
                  not a particularly cheerful subject to think of, I came over here." These words
                  were said with a sort of chilly, dreary sigh, that made me turn and look up in
                  Miss Mehitable's face. It looked haggard and weary, as of one tired of struggling
                  with painful thoughts.</p>
               <p>"Wal," said Sam Lawson, "I stopped a minute round to your back door, Miss
                  Rossiter, to talk with Polly about the sermon. I was a tellin' Polly that that
                  'ere was puttin' inability a leetle too strong."</p>
               <p>"Not a bit, not a bit," said Uncle Fly, "so long as it's moral inability. There's
                  the point, ye see,—<emph>moral,</emph>—that's the word. That makes it all
                  right."</p>
               <p>"Wal," said Sam, "I was a puttin' it to Polly this way. Ef a man's cut off his
                  hands, it ain't right to require him to chop wood. Wal, Polly, she says he 'd no
                  business to cut his hands off; and so he ought to be required to chop the wood all
                  the same. Wal, I telled her it was Adam chopped our hands off. But she said, no;
                  it was we did it <emph>in</emph> Adam, and she brought up the catechise plain
                     enough,—<emph>We sinned in him,</emph> and fell with him.'"</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7953-00000042"/>
               <p>"She had you there, Sam," said Uncle Fly, with great content. "You won't catch
                  Polly tripping on the catechism."</p>
               <p>"Well, for my part," said Major Broad, "I don't like these doctrinal subtilties,
                  Deacon Badger. Now I've got a volume of Mr. Addison's religious writings that seem
                  to me about the right thing. They 're very pleasing reading. Mr. Addison is my
                  favorite author of a Sunday."</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid Mr. Addison had nothing but just mere morality and natural religion,"
                  said my grandmother, who could not be withheld from bearing her testimony. "You
                  don't find any of the discriminating doctrines in Mr. Addison. Major Broad, did
                  you ever read Mr. Bellamy's 'True Religion Delineated and Distinguished from all
                  Counterfeits'?"</p>
               <p>"No, madam, I never did," said Major Broad.</p>
               <p>"Well, I earnestly hope you will read <emph>that</emph> book," said my
                  grandmother.</p>
               <p>"My wife is always at me about one good book or another," said my grandfather;
                  "but I manage to do with my old Bible. I have n't used that up yet."</p>
               <p>"I should know about Dr. Bellamy's book by this time," said Miss Mehitable, "for
                  Polly intrenches herself in that, and preaches out of it daily. Polly certainly
                  missed her vocation when she was trained for a servant. She is a born professor of
                  theology. She is so circumstantial about all that took place at the time the
                  angels fell, and when the covenant was made with Adam in the Garden of Eden, that
                  I sometimes question whether she really might not have been there personally.
                  Polly is particularly strong on Divine sovereignty. She thinks it applies to
                  everything under the sun except my affairs. Those she chooses to look after
                  herself."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Major Broad, "I am not much of a theologian. I want to be taught my
                  duty. Parson Lothrop's discourses are generally very clear and practical, and they
                  suit me."</p>
               <p>"They are good as far as they go," said my grandmother; "but I like good, strong,
                  old-fashioned doctrine. I like such writers as Mr. Edwards and Dr. Bellamy and Dr.
                  Hopkins. It's all very well, your essays on cheerfulness and resignation, and all
                  that; but I want something that takes strong hold of you, so that you feel
                  something has got you that <emph>can</emph> hold."</p>
               <p>"The Cambridge Platform, for instance," said Uncle Bill.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my son, the Cambridge Platform. I ain't ashamed of it. It was made by men
                  whose shoe-latchet we are n't worthy to unloose. I believe it,—every word on 't. I
                  believe it, and I'm going to believe it."</p>
               <p>"And would if there was twice as much of it," said Uncle Bill. "That's right,
                  mother, stand up for your colors. I admire your spirit. But, Sam, what does Hepsy
                  think of all this? I suppose you enlighten her when you return from your
                  investigations."</p>
               <p>"Wal, I try to. But lordy massy, Mr. Badger, Hepsy don't take no kind o' interest
                  in the doctrines, no more 'n nothin' at all. She 's so kind o' worldly, Hepsy is.
                  It 's allers meat and drink, meat and drink, with her. That 's all she 's thinkin'
                  of."</p>
               <p>"And if <emph>you</emph> would think more of such things, she would n't have to
                  think so much," said Aunt Lois, sharply. "Don't you know the Bible says, that the
                  man that provideth not for his own household hath denied the faith, and is worse
                  than an infidel?"</p>
               <p>"I don't see," said Sam, slowly flopping his great hands up and down over the
                  blaze,—"I railly don't see why folks are allers a throwin' up that 'ere text at
                  me. I 'm sure I work as hard as a man ken. Why, I was a workin' last night till
                  nigh twelve o'clock, doin' up odd jobs o' blacksmithin'. They kind o' 'cumulate,
                  ye know."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lawson," said my grandmother, with a look of long-suffering patience, "how
                  often and often must I tell you, that if you 'd be steadier round your home, and
                  work in regular hours, Hepsy would be more comfortable, and things would go on
                  better?"</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, Mis' Badger, bless your soul and body, ye don't know nothin' about
                  it;—ye don't know nothin' what I undergo. Hepsy, she 's at me from morning till
                  night. First it 's one thing, and then another. One day it rains, and her
                  clothes-line breaks. She 's at me 'bout that. Now I tell her, 'Hepsy, I ain't to
                  blame,—I don't make the rain.' And then another day she 's at me agin<pb n="76-77"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000043"/> 'cause the wind 's east, and fetches the smoke down
                  chimbley. I tell her, 'Hepsy, now look here,—<emph>do</emph> I make the wind
                  blow?' But it 's no use talkin' to Hepsy."</p>
               <p>"Well, Sam, I take your part," said Bill. "I always knew you was a regular martyr.
                  Come, boys, go down cellar and draw a pitcher of cider. We 'll stay him with
                  flagons, and comfort him with apples. Won't we, Sam?"</p>
               <p>As Sam was prime favorite with all boys, my brother Bill and I started willingly
                  enough on this errand, one carrying the candle and the other a great stone pitcher
                  of bountiful proportions, which always did hospitable duty on similar
                  occasions.</p>
               <p>Just as we returned, bearing our pitcher, there came another rap at the outside
                  door of the kitchen, and Old Betty Poganut and Sally Wonsamug stood at the
                  door.</p>
               <p>"Well, now, Mis' Badger," said Betty, "Sally and me, we thought we must jest run
                  in, we got so scar't. We was coming through that Bill Morse's woods, and there
                  come such a flash o' lightnin' it most blinded us, and the wind blew enough to
                  blow a body over; and we thought there was a storm right down on us, and we run
                  jest as fast as we could. We did n't know what to do, we was so scar't. I 'm
                  mortal 'fraid of lightning."</p>
               <p>"Why, Betty, you forgot the sermon to-day. You should have said your prayers, as
                  Parson Lothrop tells you," said my grandfather.</p>
               <p>"Well, I did kind o' put up a sort o' silent 'jaculation, as a body may say. That
                  is, I jest said, 'O Lord,' and kind o' gin him a wink, you know."</p>
               <p>"O, you did?" said my grandfather.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I kind o' thought He 'd know what I meant."</p>
               <p>My grandfather turned with a smile to Miss Mehitable. "These Indians have their
                  own wild ways of looking at things, after all."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, I s'pose you have n't had a bit of supper, either of you," said my
                  grandmother, getting up. "It 's commonly the way of it."</p>
               <p>"Well, to tell the truth, I was sayin' to Sarah that if we come down to Mis'
                  Deacon Badger's I should n't wonder if we got something good," said Betty, her
                  broad, coarse face and baggy cheeks beginning to be illuminated with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Here, Horace, you come and hold the candle while I go into the buttery and get
                  'em some cold pork and beans," said my grandmother, cheerily. "The poor creturs
                  don't get a good meal of victuals very often; and I baked a good lot on
                  purpose."</p>
               <p>If John Bunyan had known my grandmother, he certainly would have introduced her in
                  some of his histories as "the housekeeper whose name was Bountiful"; and under her
                  care an ample meal of brown bread and pork and beans was soon set forth on the
                  table in the corner of the kitchen, to which the two hungry Indian women sat down
                  with the appetite of wolves. A large mug was placed between them, which Uncle Bill
                  filled to the brim with cider.</p>
               <p>"I s'pose you 'd like twice a mug better than once a mug, Sally," he said, punning
                  on her name.</p>
               <p>"O, if the mug 's only big enough," said Sally, her snaky eyes gleaming with
                  appetite; "and it 's always a good big mug one gets here."</p>
               <p>Sam Lawson's great white eyes began irresistibly to wander in the direction of the
                  plentiful cheer which was being so liberally dispensed at the other side of the
                  room.</p>
               <p>"Want some, Sam, my boy?" said Uncle Bill, with a patronizing freedom.</p>
               <p>"Why, bless your soul, Master Bill, I would n't care a bit if I took a plate o'
                  them beans and some o' that 'ere pork. Hepsy did n't save no beans for me; and,
                  walkin' all the way from North Parish, I felt kind o' empty and windy, as a body
                  may say. You know Scriptur' tells about bein' filled with the east wind; but I
                  never found it noways satisfyin',—it sets sort o' cold on the stomach."</p>
               <p>"Draw up, Sam, and help yourself," said Uncle Bill, putting plate and knife and
                  fork before him; and Sam soon showed that he had a vast internal capacity for the
                  stowing away of beans and brown bread.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Major Broad and my grandfather drew their chairs together, and began a
                  warm discussion of the Constitution<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7953-00000044"/> tion
                  of the United States, which had been recently presented for acceptance in a
                  Convention of the State of Massachusetts.</p>
               <p>"I have n't seen you, Major Broad," said my grandfather, "since you came back from
                  the Convention. I 'm very anxious to have our State of Massachusetts accept that
                  Constitution. We 're in an unsettled condition now; we don't know fairly where we
                  are. If we accept this Constitution, we shall be a nation,—we shall have something
                  to go to work on."</p>
               <p>"Well, Deacon Badger, to say the truth, I could not vote for this Constitution in
                  Convention. They have adopted it by a small majority; but I shall be bound to
                  record my dissent from it."</p>
               <p>"Pray, Major, what are your objections?" said Miss Mehitable.</p>
               <p>"I have two. One is, it gives too much power to the President. There's an
                  appointing power and a power of patronage that will play the mischief some day in
                  the hands of an ambitious man. That 's one objection. The other is the recognizing
                  and encouraging of slavery in the Constitution. That is such a dreadful
                  wrong,—such a shameful inconsistency,—when we have just come through a battle for
                  the doctrine that all men are free and equal, to turn round and found our national
                  government on a recognition of African slavery. It cannot and will not come to
                  good."</p>
               <p>"O, well," said my grandfather, "slavery will gradually die out. You see how it is
                  going in the New England States."</p>
               <p>"I cannot think so," said the Major. "I have a sort of feeling about this that I
                  cannot resist. If we join those States that still mean to import and use slaves,
                  our nation will meet some dreadful punishment. I am certain of it."<ref

                        above stated, may still be read in the report of the proceedings of the

                  </note>
               <p>"Well, really," said my grandfather, "I 'm concerned to hear you speak so. I have
                  felt such anxiety to have something settled. You see, without a union we are all
                  afloat,—we are separate logs, but no raft."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Miss Mehitable, "but nothing can be settled that is n't founded on
                  right. We ought to dig deep, and lay our foundations on a rock, when we build for
                  posterity."</p>
               <p>"Were there many of your way of thinking in the Convention, Major?" said my
                  grandfather.</p>
               <p>"Well, we had a pretty warm discussion, and we came very near to carrying it. Now,
                  in Middlesex County, for instance, where we are, there were only seventeen in
                  favor of the Constitution, and twenty-five against; and in Worcester County there
                  were only seven in favor and forty-three against. Well, they carried it at last by
                  a majority of nineteen; but the minority recorded their protest. Judge Widgery of
                  Portland, General Thompson of Topsham, and Dr. Taylor of Worcester, rather headed
                  the opposition. Then the town of Andover instructed its representative, Mr.
                  Symmes, to vote against it, but he did n't, he voted on the other side, and I
                  understand they are dreadfully indignant about it. I saw a man from Andover last
                  week who said that he actually thought Symmes would be obliged to leave the town,
                  he was so dreadfully unpopular."</p>
               <p>"Well, Major Broad, I agree with you," said my grandmother, heartily, "and I honor
                  you for the stand you took, Slavery is a sin and a shame; and I say, with Jacob,
                  'O my soul, come not thou into their secret,—unto their assembly, mine honor, be
                  not thou united.' I wish we may keep clear on 't. I don't want anything that we
                  can't ask God's blessing on heartily, and we certainly can't on this. Why, anybody
                  that sees that great scar on Cæsar's forehead sees what slavery comes to."</p>
               <p>My grandmother always pointed her anti-slavery arguments with an appeal to this
                  mark of ill-usage which old Cæsar had received at the hands of a brutal master
                  years before, and the appeal never failed to convince the domestic circle.</p>
               <p>"Well," said my grandfather, after some moments of silence, in which he sat gazing
                  fixedly at the great red coals of a hickory log, "you see, Major, it 's done, and
                  can't be helped."</p>
               <p>"It 's done," said the Major, "but in my opinion mischief will come of it as sure
                  as there is a God in heaven."</p>
               <p>"Let 's hope not," said my grandfather, placidly.</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7953-00000045"/>
               <p>Outside the weather was windy and foul, the wind rattling doors, shaking and
                  rumbling down the chimney, and causing the great glowing circle lighted by the
                  fire to seem warmer and brighter. The Indian women and Sam Lawson, having finished
                  their meal and thoroughly cleaned out the dishes, grouped themselves about the end
                  of the ingle already occupied by black Cæsar, and began a little private gossip
                  among themselves.</p>
               <p>"I say," says Sam, raising his voice to call my grandfather's attention, "do you
                  know, Deacon Badger, whether anybody is living in the Dench house now?"</p>
               <p>"There was n't, the last I knew about it," said my grandfather.</p>
               <p>"Wal, you won't make some folks believe but what that 'ere house is haunted."</p>
               <p>"Haunted!" said Miss Mehitable; "nothing more likely. What old house is n't?—if
                  one only knew it; and that certainly ought to be if ever a house was."</p>
               <p>"But this 'ere 's a regular <emph>haunt,</emph>" said Sam. "I was a talkin' the
                  other night with Bill Payne and Jake Marshall, and they both on 'em said that they
                  'd seen strange things in them grounds,—they 'd seen a figger of a man—"</p>
               <p>"With his head under his arm," suggested Uncle Bill.</p>
               <p>"No, a man in a long red cloak," said Sam Lawson, "such as Sir Harry Frankland
                  used to wear."</p>
               <p>"Poor Sir Harry!" said Miss Mehitable, "has he come to that?"</p>
               <p>"Did you know Sir Harry?" said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"I have met him once or twice at the Governor's house," said Miss Mehitable. "Lady
                  Lothrop knew Lady Frankland very well."</p>
               <p>"Well, Sam," said Uncle Bill, "do let's hear the end of this haunting."</p>
               <p>"Nothin', only the other night I was a goin' over to watch with Lem Moss, and I
                  passed pretty night the Dench place, and I thought I 'd jest look round it a
                  spell. And as sure as you 're alive I see smoke a comin' out of the chimbley."</p>
               <p>"I did n't know as ghosts ever used the fireplaces," said Uncle Bill. "Well, Sam,
                  did you go in?"</p>
               <p>"No, I was pretty much in a hurry; but I telled Jake and Bill, and then they each
                  on 'em had something to match that they 'd seen. As nigh as I can make it out,
                  there 's that 'ere boy that they say was murdered and thrown down that 'ere old
                  well walks sometimes. And then there 's a woman appears to some, and this 'ere man
                  in a red cloak; and they think it 's Sir Harry in his red cloak."</p>
               <p>"For my part," said Aunt Lois, "I never had much opinion of Sir Harry Frankland,
                  or Lady Frankland either. I don't think such goings on ever ought to be
                  countenanced in society."</p>
               <p>"They both repented bitterly,—repented in sackcloth and ashes," said Miss
                  Mehitable. "And if God forgives such sins, why should n't we?"</p>
               <p>"What was the story?" said Major Broad.</p>
               <p>"Why," said Aunt Lois, "have n't you heard of Agnes Surridge, of Marblehead? She
                  was housemaid in a tavern there, and Sir Harry fell in love with her, and took her
                  and educated her. That was well enough; but when she 'd done going to school he
                  took her home to his house in Boston, and called her his daughter; although people
                  became pretty sure that the connection was not what it should be, and they refused
                  to have anything to do with her. So he bought this splendid place out in the
                  woods, and built a great palace of a house, and took Miss Agnes out there. People
                  that wanted to be splendidly entertained, and that were not particular as to
                  morals, used to go out to visit them."</p>
               <p>"I used to hear great stories of their wealth and pomp and luxury," said my
                  grandmother, "but I mourned over it, that it should come to this in New England,
                  that people could openly set such an example and be tolerated. It would n't have
                  been borne a generation before, I can tell you. No, indeed,—the magistrates would
                  have put a stop to it. But these noblemen, when they came over to America, seemed
                  to think themselves lords of God's heritage, and free to do just as they
                  pleased."</p>
               <p>"But," said Miss Mehitable, "they repented, as I said. He took her to England, and
                  there his friends refused to receive her; and then he was appointed Ambassador to
                  Lisbon, and he<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7953-00000046"/> took her there. On the day
                  of the great earthquake Sir Harry was riding with a lady of the court when the
                  shock came, and in a moment, without warning, they found themselves buried under
                  the ruins of a building they were passing. He wore a scarlet cloak, as was the
                  fashion; and they say that in her dying agonies the poor creature bit through this
                  cloak and sleeve into the flesh of his arm, and made a mark that he carried to his
                  dying day. Sir Harry was saved by Agnes Surridge. She came over the ruins, calling
                  and looking for him, and he heard her voice and answered, and she got men to come
                  and dig him out. When he was in that dreadful situation, he made a vow to God, if
                  he would save his life, that he would be a different man. And he was a changed man
                  from that day. He was married to Agnes Surridge as soon as they could get a priest
                  to perform the ceremony; and when he took her back to England all his relations
                  received her, and she was presented in court and moved in society with perfect
                  acceptance."</p>
               <p>"I don't think it ever ought to have been," said Aunt Lois. "Such women never
                  ought to be received."</p>
               <p>"What! is there no place of repentance for a woman?" said Miss Mehitable. "Christ
                  said, 'Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more.'"</p>
               <p>I noticed again that sort of shiver of feeling in Miss Mehitable; and there was a
                  peculiar thrill in her voice, as she said these words, that made me sensible that
                  she was speaking from some inward depth of feeling.</p>
               <p>"Don't you be so hard and sharp, Lois," said my grandmother; "sinners must have
                  patience with sinners."</p>
               <p>"Especially with sinners of quality, Lois," said Uncle Bill. "By all accounts Sir
                  Harry and Lady Frankland swept all before them when they came back to Boston."</p>
               <p>"Of course," said Miss Mehitable; "what was done in court would be done in Boston,
                  and whom Queen Charlotte received would be received in our upper circles. Lady
                  Lothrop never called on her till she was Lady Frankland, but after that I believe
                  she has visited out at their place."</p>
               <p>"Wal, I've heerd 'em say," said Sam Lawson, "that it would take a woman two days
                  jest to get through cleaning the silver that there was in that'ere house, to say
                  nothing about the carpets and the curtains and the tapestry. But then, when the
                  war broke out, Lady Frankland, she took most of it back to England, I guess, and
                  the house has been back and forward to one and another. I never could rightly know
                  jest who did live in it. I heard about some French folks that lived there one
                  time. I thought some day, when I had n't nothin' else to do, I 'd jest walk over
                  to old Granny Walker's, that lives over the other side of Hopkinton. She used to
                  be a housekeeper to Lady Frankland, and I could get particulars out o' her."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Miss Mehitable, "I know one woman that must go back to a haunted
                  house, and that is this present one." So saying, she rose and put me off her
                  knee.</p>
               <p>"Send this little man over to see me to-morrow," she said to my mother. "Polly has
                  a cake for him, and I shall find something to amuse him."</p>
               <p>Major Broad, with old-fashioned gallantry, insisted on waiting on Miss Mehitable
                  home; and Sam Lawson reluctantly tore himself from the warm corner to encounter
                  the asperities of his own fireside.</p>
               <p>"Here, Sam," said good-natured Bill,—"here 's a great red apple for Hepsy."</p>
               <p>"Ef I dares to go nigh enough to give it to her," said Sam, with a grimace. "She
                  's allers a castin' it up at me that I don't want to set with her at home. But
                  lordy massy, she don't consider that a fellow don't want to set and be hectored
                  and lectured when he can do better elsewhere."</p>
               <p>"True enough, Sam; but give my regards to her."</p>
               <p>As to the two Indian women, they gave it as their intention to pass the night by
                  the kitchen fire; and my grandmother, to whom such proceedings were not at all
                  strange, assented,—producing for each a blanket, which had often seen similar
                  service. My grandfather closed the evening by bringing out his great Bible and
                  reading a chapter. Then we all knelt down in prayer.</p>
               <p>So passed an evening in my grandmother's kitchen,—where<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000047"/> religion, theology, politics, the gossip of the
                  day, and the legends of the supernatural all conspired to weave a fabric of
                  thought quaint and various. Intense earnestness, a solemn undertone of deep
                  mournful awe, was overlaid with quaint traceries of humor, strange and weird in
                  their effect. I was one of those children who are all ear,—dreamy listeners, who
                  brood over all that they hear, without daring to speak of it; and in this
                  evening's conversation I had heard enough to keep my eyes broad open long after my
                  mother had laid me in bed. The haunted house and its vague wonders filled my mind,
                  and I determined to question Sam Lawson yet more about it.</p>
               <p>But now that I have fairly introduced myself, the scene of my story, and many of
                  the actors in it, I must take my reader off for a while, and relate a history that
                  must at last blend with mine in one story.</p>

               <p>ON the brow of yonder hill you see that old, red farm-house, with its slanting
                  back roof relieved against the golden sky of the autumn afternoon. The house lifts
                  itself up dark and clear under the shadow of two great elm-trees that droop over
                  it, and is the first of a straggling, irregular cluster of farm-houses that form
                  the village of Needmore. A group of travellers, sitting on a bit of rock in the
                  road below the hill on which the farm-house stands, are looking up to it, in
                  earnest conversation.</p>
               <p>"Mother, if you can only get up there, we 'll ask them to let you go in and rest,"
                  said a little boy of nine years to a weary, pale, sick-looking woman who sat as in
                  utter exhaustion and discouragement on the rock. A little girl two years younger
                  than the boy sat picking at the moss at her feet, and earnestly listening to her
                  older brother with the air of one who is attending to the words of a leader.</p>
               <p>"I don't feel as if I could get a step farther," said the woman; and the
                  increasing deadly paleness of her face confirmed her words.</p>
               <p>"O mother, don't give up," said the boy; "just rest here a little and then lean on
                  me, and we 'll get you up the hill; and then I 'm sure they 'll take you in. Come,
                  now; I'll run and get you some water in our tin cup, and you 'll feel better
                  soon." And the boy ran to a neighboring brook and filled a small tin cup, and
                  brought the cool water to his mother.</p>
               <p>She drank it, and then, fixing a pair of dark, pathetic eyes on the face of her
                  boy, she said: "My dear child, you have always been such a blessing to me! What
                  should I do without you?"</p>
               <p>"Well, mother, now, if you feel able, just rest on my shoulder, and Tina will take
                  the bundle. You take it, Tina, and we 'll find a place to rest."</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7953-00000048"/>
               <p>And so, slowly and with difficulty, the three wound their way up to the grassy top
                  of the hill where stood the red house. This house belonged to a man named Caleb
                  Smith, whose character had caused the name he bore to degenerate into another
                  which was held to be descriptive of his nature, namely, "Crab"; and the boys of
                  the vicinity commonly expressed the popular idea of the man by calling him "Old
                  Crab Smith." His was one of those sour, cross, gnarly natures that now and then
                  are to be met with in New England, which, like knotty cider-apples, present a
                  compound of hardness, sourness, and bitterness. It was affirmed that a continual
                  free indulgence in very hard cider as a daily beverage was one great cause of this
                  churlishness of temper; but be that as it may, there was not a boy in the village
                  that did not know and take account of it in all his estimates and calculations, as
                  much as of northeast storms and rainy weather. No child ever willingly carried a
                  message to him; no neighbor but dreaded to ask a favor of him; nobody hoped to
                  borrow or beg of him; nobody willingly hired themselves out to him, or did him
                  cheerful service. In short, he was a petrified man, walled out from all
                  neighborhood sympathies, and standing alone in his crabbedness. And it was to this
                  man's house that the wandering orphan boy was leading his poor sick mother.</p>
               <p>The three travellers approached a neat back porch on the shady side of the house,
                  where an old woman sat knitting. This was Old Crab Smith's wife, or, more properly
                  speaking, his life-long bond-slave,—the only human being whom he could so secure
                  to himself that she should be always at hand for him to vent that residue of
                  ill-humor upon which the rest of the world declined to receive. Why half the women
                  in the world marry the men they do, is a problem that might puzzle any
                  philosopher; how any woman could marry Crab Smith, was the standing wonder of all
                  the neighborhood. And yet Crab's wife was a modest, industrious, kindly creature,
                  who uncomplainingly toiled from morning till night to serve and please him, and
                  received her daily allowance of grumbling and fault-finding with quiet submission.
                  She tried all she could to mediate between him and the many whom his ill-temper
                  was constantly provoking. She did surreptitious acts of kindness here and there,
                  to do away the effects of his hardness, and shrunk and quivered for fear of being
                  detected in goodness, as much as many another might for fear of being discovered
                  in sin. She had been many times a mother,—had passed through all the trials and
                  weaknesses of maternity without one tender act of consideration, one encouraging
                  word. Her children had grown up and gone from her, always eager to leave the
                  bleak, ungenial home, and go out to shift for themselves in the world, and now, in
                  old age, she was still working. Worn to a shadow,—little, old, wrinkled,
                  bowed,—she was still about the daily round of toil, and still the patient
                  recipient of the murmurs and chidings of her tyrant.</p>
               <p>"My mother is so sick she can't get any farther," said a little voice from under
                  the veranda; "won't you let her come in and lie down awhile?"</p>
               <p>"Massy, child," said the little old woman, coming forward with a trembling,
                  uncertain step. "Well, she does look beat eout, to be sure. Come up and rest ye a
                  bit."</p>
               <p>"If you 'll only let me lie down awhile and rest me," said a faint, sweet
                  voice.</p>
               <p>"Come up here," said the old woman, standing quivering like a gray shadow on the
                  top doorstep; and, shading her wrinkled forehead with her hand, she looked with a
                  glance of habitual apprehension along the road where the familiar cart and oxen of
                  her tyrant might be expected soon to appear on their homeward way, and rejoiced in
                  her little old heart that he was safe out of sight. "Yes, come in," she said,
                  opening the door of a small ground-floor bedroom that adjoined the apartment known
                  in New England houses as the sink-room, and showing them a plain bed.</p>
               <p>The worn and wasted stranger sunk down on it, and, as she sunk, her whole
                  remaining strength seemed to collapse, and something white and deathly fell, as if
                  it had been a shadow, over her face.</p>
               <p>"Massy to us! she's fainted clean away," said the poor old woman, quiveringly. "I
                  must jest run for the camphire."</p>
               <p>The little boy seemed to have that unchildlike judgment and presence of mind that
                  are the precocious development of want<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7953-00000049"/>
                  and sorrow. He ran to a water-pail, and, dipping his small tin cup, he dashed the
                  water in his mother's face, and fanned her with his little torn straw hat. When
                  the old woman returned, the invalid was breathing again, and able to take a few
                  swallows of camphor and water which had been mixed for her.</p>
               <p>"Sonny," said the old woman, "you are a nice little nurse,—a good boy. You jest
                  take care now; and here's a turkey-feather fan to fan her with; and I'll get on
                  the kettle to make her a cup of tea. We 'll bring her round with a little nursing.
                  Been walking a long way, I calculate?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the boy, "she was trying to get to Boston."</p>
               <p>"What, going afoot?"</p>
               <p>"We did n't mind walking, the weather is so pleasant," said the boy; "and Tina and
                  I like walking; but mother got sick a day or two ago, and ever since she has been
                  so tired!"</p>
               <p>"Jes' so," said the old woman, looking compassionately on the bed. "Well, I 'll
                  make up the fire and get her some tea."</p>
               <p>The fire was soon smoking in the great, old-fashioned kitchen chimney, for the
                  neat, labor-saving cook-stove had as yet no being; and the thin, blue smoke,
                  curling up in the rosy sunset air, received prismatic coloring which a painter
                  would have seized with enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>Far otherwise, however, was its effect on the eye of Old Crab Smith, as, coming up
                  the hill, his eye detected the luminous vapor going up from his own particular
                  chimney.</p>
               <p>"So, burning out wood,—always burning out wood. I told her that I would n't have
                  tea got at night. These old women are crazy and bewitched after tea, and they
                  don't care if they burn up your tables and chairs to help their messes. Why a
                  plague can't she eat cold pork and potatoes as well as I, and drink her mug of
                  cider? but must go to getting up her fire and biling her kettle. I 'll see to
                  that. Halloa there," he said, as he stamped up on to the porch, "what the devil
                  you up to now? I s'pose you think I hain't got nothing else to do but split up
                  wood for you to burn out."</p>
               <p>"Father, it 's nothing but a little brush and a few chips, jest to bile the
                  kettle."</p>
               <p>"Bile the kettle, bile the kettle! Jest like yer lazy, shif'less ways. What must
                  you be a bilin' the kettle for?"</p>
               <p>"Father, I jest want to make a little tea for a sick woman."</p>
               <p>"A sick woman! What sick woman?"</p>
               <p>"There was a poor sick woman came along this afternoon with two little
                  children."</p>
               <p>"Wal, I s'pose you took 'em in. I s'pose you think we keep the poor-house, and
                  that all the trampers belong to us. We shall have to go to the poor-house
                  ourselves before long, I tell ye. But you never believe anything I say. Why could
                  n't you 'a' sent her to the selectmen? I don't know why I must keep beggars'
                  tavern."</p>
               <p>"Father, father, don't speak so loud. The poor critter wa' n't able to stir
                  another step, and fainted dead away, and we had to get her on to a bed."</p>
               <p>"And we shall have her and her two brats through a fit of sickness. That 's just
                  like you. Wal, we shall all go to the poor-house together before long, and then
                  you 'll believe what I say, won't ye? But I won't have it so. She may stay
                  to-night, but to-morrow morning I 'll cart her over to Joe Scran's, bright and
                  early, brats and all."</p>
               <p>There was within hearing of this conversation a listener whose heart was dying
                  within her,—sinking deeper and deeper at every syllable,—a few words will explain
                  why.</p>
               <p>A younger son of a family belonging to the English gentry had come over to America
                  as a commissioned officer near the close of the Revolutionary war. He had
                  persuaded to a private marriage the daughter of a poor country curate, a beautiful
                  young girl, whom he induced to elope with him, and share the fortunes of an
                  officer's life in America. Her parents died soon after; her husband proved a
                  worthless, drunken, dissipated fellow; and this poor woman had been through all
                  the nameless humiliations and agonies which beset helpless womanhood in the sole
                  power of such a man. Submissive, gentle, trusting, praying, entreating, hoping
                  against hope, she had borne with him many vicissitudes and reverses,—always
                  believing that at last the love of his children, if not of her, would awaken a
                     better<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7953-00000050"/> nature within him. But the man
                  steadily went downward instead of upward, and the better part of him by slow
                  degrees died away, till he came to regard his wife and children only as so many
                  clogs on his life, and to meditate night and day on a scheme to abandon them, and
                  return, without their encumbrance, to his own country. It was with a distant
                  outlook to some such result that he had from the first kept their marriage an
                  entire secret from his own friends. When the English army, at the close of the
                  war, re-embarked for England, he carried his cowardly scheme into execution. He
                  had boarded his wife and children for a season in a country farm-house in the
                  vicinity of Boston, with the excuse of cheapness of lodgings. Then one day his
                  wife received a letter enclosing a sum of money, and saying, in such terms as bad
                  men can find to veil devilish deeds, that all was over between them, and that ere
                  she got this he should be on the ocean. The sorest hurt of all was that the letter
                  denied the validity of their marriage; and the poor child found, to her
                  consternation, that the marriage certificate, which she had always kept among her
                  papers, was gone with her husband.</p>
               <p>The first result of this letter had been a fit of sickness, wherein her little
                  stock of money had melted almost away, and then she had risen from her bed
                  determined to find her way to Boston, and learn, if possible, from certain persons
                  with whom he had lodged before his departure, his address in England, that she
                  might make one more appeal to him. But before she had walked far the sickness
                  returned upon her, till, dizzy and faint, she had lain down, as we have described,
                  on the bed of charity.</p>
               <p>She had thought, ever since she received that letter, that she had reached the
                  bottom of desolation,—that nothing could be added to her misery; but the
                  withering, harsh sounds which reached her ear revealed a lower deep in the lowest
                  depths. Hitherto on her short travels she had met only that kindly country
                  hospitality which New England, from one end to the other, always has shown to the
                  stranger. No one had refused a good meal of brown bread and rich milk to her and
                  her children, and more often the friendly housewife, moved by her delicate
                  appearance, had unlocked the sanctum where was deposited her precious tea-caddy,
                  and brewed an amber cup of tea to sustain the sickly-looking wanderer. She and her
                  children had been carried here and there, as occasion offered, a friendly mile or
                  two, when Noah or Job or Sol "hitched up the critter" to go to mill or country
                  store. The voice of harsh, pitiless rejection smote on her ear for the first time,
                  and it seemed to her the drop too much in her cup. She turned her face to the wall
                  and said, "O my God, I cannot bear this! I cannot, I cannot!" She would have said,
                  "Let me die," but that she was tied to life by the two helpless, innocent ones who
                  shared her misery. The poorest and most desolate mother feels that her little
                  children are poorer and more desolate than she; and, however much her broken
                  spirit may long for the rest of Paradise, she is held back by the thought that to
                  abide in the flesh is needful to them. Even in her uttermost destitution the
                  approaching shadow of the dark valley was a terror to the poor soul,—not for her
                  own sake, but for theirs. The idea of a harsh, unpitiful world arose before her
                  for the first time, and the thought of leaving her little ones in it unprotected
                  was an anguish which rent her heart.</p>
               <p>The little girl, over-weary, had eaten her supper and fallen asleep beside her,
                  with the trusting, ignorant rest of early childhood; but her boy sat by her
                  bedside with that look of precocious responsibility, that air of anxious thought,
                  which seems unnatural in early childhood, and contrasted painfully with the slight
                  childish figure, the little hands, and little voice. He was, as we have said, but
                  nine years of age, well grown for his years, but with that style of growth which
                  indicates delicacy of fibre rather than strength of organization. His finely
                  formed head, with its clustering curls of yellow hair, his large, clear blue eyes,
                  his exquisitely delicate skin, and the sensitiveness betrayed by his quivering
                  lips, spoke of a lineage of gentle blood, and an organization fitted rather to
                  æsthetic and intellectual development than to sturdy material toil. The little
                  girl, as she lay sleeping, was a beautiful picture. Her head was a wilderness of
                  curls of a golden auburn, and the defined pencilling of the eyebrows, and the long
                  silken veil of the lashes that fell over the sleeping eyes, the delicate polished
                  skin, and the finely moulded<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7953-00000051"/> limbs, all
                  indicated that she was one who ought to have been among the jewels, rather than
                  among the potsherds of this mortal life. And these were the children that she was
                  going to leave alone, without a single friend and protector in this world. For
                  there are intuitions that come to the sick and dying which tell them when the end
                  is near; and as this wanderer sunk down upon her bed this night, there had fallen
                  upon her mind a perfect certainty that she should never be carried thence till
                  carried to the grave; and it was this which had given her soul so deadly a wrench,
                  and caused her to cry out in such utter agony.</p>
               <p>What happens to desolate souls, who, thus forsaken by all the world, cry out to
                  God, is a mystery, good brother and sister, which you can never fathom until you
                  have been exactly where they are. But certain it is that there is a very near way
                  to God's heart, and so to the great heart of all comfort, that sometimes opens
                  like a shaft of light between heaven and the soul, in hours when everything
                  earthly falls away from us. A quaint old writer has said, "God keeps his choicest
                  cordials for the time of our deepest faintings." And so it came to pass that, as
                  this poor woman closed her eyes and prayed earnestly, there fell a strange
                  clearness into her soul, which calmed every fear, and hushed the voice of every
                  passion, and she lay for a season as if entranced. Words of holy writ, heard years
                  ago in church-readings, in the hours of unconscious girlhood, now seemed to come
                  back, borne in with a living power on her soul. It seemed almost as if a voice
                  within was saying to her: "The Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and
                  grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. For
                  a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee. In
                  a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting kindness
                  will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer. O thou afflicted, tossed
                  with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors,
                  and thy foundations with sapphires. And all thy children shall be taught of the
                  Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy children."</p>
               <p>It is fashionable now to speak of words like these as fragments of ancient Hebrew
                  literature, interesting and curious indeed, but relating to scenes, events, and
                  states of society long gone by. But it is a most remarkable property of this old
                  Hebrew literature, that it seems to be enchanted with a divine and living power,
                  which strikes the nerve of individual consciousness in every desolate and
                  suffering soul. It may have been Judah or Jerusalem ages ago to whom these words
                  first came, but as they have travelled down for thousands of years, they have
                  seemed to tens of thousands of sinking and desolate souls as the voice of God to
                  them individually. They have raised the burden from thousands of crushed spirits;
                  they have been as the day-spring to thousands of perplexed wanderers. Ah! let us
                  treasure these old words, for as of old Jehovah chose to dwell in a tabernacle in
                  the wilderness, and between the cherubim in the temple, so now he dwells in them;
                  and to the simple soul that seeks for him here he will look forth as of old from
                  the pillar of cloud and of fire.</p>
               <p>The poor, ill-used, forsaken, forgotten creature who lay there trembling on the
                  verge of life felt the presence of that mighty and generous, that godlike spirit
                  that inspired these words. And surely if Jehovah ever did speak to man, no words
                  were ever more worthy of Him. She lay as in a blessed trance, as passage after
                  passage from the Scriptures rolled over her mind, like bright waves from the ocean
                  of eternal peace.</p>
               <p>"Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God. When thou
                  passest through the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall
                  not overflow thee. When thou walkest through the fire, thou shall not be burned,
                  neither shall the flame kindle upon thee; for I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One
                  of Israel, thy Saviour."</p>
               <p>The little boy, who had heard his mother's first distressful cry, sat by her
                  anxiously watching the changes of her face as she lay there. He saw her brow
                  gradually grow clear and calm, and every line of trouble fade from her face, as
                  shadows and clouds roll up from the landscape at day-dawn, till at last there was
                  a rapt, peaceful expression, an evenness of breathing, as if she slept, and were
                  dreaming some heavenly dream. It lasted for<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7953-00000052"
                  /> more than an hour, and the child sat watching her with the old, grave, tender
                  look which had come to be the fashion of his little face when he looked upon his
                  mother.</p>
               <p>This boy had come to this mother as a second harvest of heart, hope, and joy,
                  after the first great love and hope of womanhood had vanished. She felt herself
                  broken-hearted, lonely, and unloved, when her first-born son was put into her
                  arms, and she received him as did the first mother, saying, "I have gotten a man
                  from the Lord." To him her desolate heart had unfolded its burden of confidence
                  from the first dawning hours of intelligence. His tiny faculties had been widened
                  to make room for her sorrows, and his childish strength increased by her leaning.
                  There had been hours when this boy had stood between the maniac rage of a drunken
                  father and the cowering form of his mother, with an unchildlike courage and
                  steadiness that seemed almost like an inspiration. In days of desertion and
                  poverty he had gone out with their slender stock of money and made bargains such
                  as it is pitiful to think that a little child should know how to make; and often,
                  in moments when his mother's heart was overwhelmed, he would come to her side with
                  the little prayers and hymns which she had taught him, and revive her faith and
                  courage when it seemed entirely gone.</p>
               <p>Now, as he thought her sleeping, he began with anxious care to draw the coverlet
                  over her, and to move his little sister back upon the bed. She opened her
                  eyes,—large, clear blue eyes, the very mirror of his own,—and, smiling with a
                  strange sweetness, stretched out her hand and drew him towards her. "Harry, my
                  dear good boy, my dear, dear child, nobody knows what a comfort you have been to
                  me."</p>
               <p>Then holding him from her, and looking intently in his eyes, she seemed to
                  hesitate for words to tell him something that lay on her mind. At last she said,
                  "Harry, say your prayers and psalms."</p>
               <p>The child knelt by the bed, with his hands clasped in his mother's, and said the
                  Lord's Prayer, and then, standing up, repeated the beautiful psalm beginning, "The
                  Lord is my shepherd." Then followed a hymn, which the Methodists had made familiar
                  in those times:—<q>

                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Harry," said his mother, looking at him with an intense earnestness, "I want to
                  tell you something. God, our Father, has called me to come home to him; and I am
                  going. In a little while—perhaps to-morrow—I shall be gone, and you cannot find
                  me. My soul will go to God, and they will put my body in the ground; and then you
                  will have no friend but Jesus, and no father but the Father in heaven."</p>
               <p>The child looked at her with solemn, dilated gaze, not really comprehending the
                  full mystery of that which she was trying to explain; yet the tears starting in
                  his eyes, and the twitching of the muscles of his mouth, showed that he partly
                  understood.</p>
               <p>"Mother," he said, "will papa never come back?"</p>
               <p>"No, Harry, never. He has left us and gone away. He does not love us,—nobody loves
                  us but our Father in heaven; but He does. You must always believe this. Now,
                  Harry, I am going to leave your little sister to your care. You must always keep
                  with her and take care of her, for she is a very little girl."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother."</p>
               <p>"This is a great charge for a little boy like you; but you will live and grow up
                  to be a man, and I want you never, as long as you live, to forget what I say to
                  you now. Promise me, Harry, all your life to say these prayers and hymns that you
                  have just<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7953-00000053"/> been saying, every morning and
                  every night. They are all I have to leave you; but if you only believe them, you
                  will never be without comfort, no matter what happens to you. Promise me,
                  dear."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother, I will."</p>
               <p>"And, Harry, no matter <emph>what</emph> happens, never doubt that God loves
                  you,—never forget that you have a Friend in heaven. Whenever you have a trouble,
                  just pray to Him, and He will help you. Promise this."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother."</p>
               <p>"Now lie down by me; I am very, very tired."</p>
               <p>The little boy lay down by his mother; she threw her arms around him, and both
                  sunk to sleep.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">MISS ASPHYXIA.</head>
               <p>"THERE won't be no great profit in this 'ere these ten year."</p>
               <p>The object denominated "this 'ere" was the golden-haired child whom we have spoken
                  of before,—the little girl whose mother lay dying. That mother is dead now; and
                  the thing to be settled is, What is to be done with the children? The morning
                  after the scene we have described looked in at the window and saw the woman, with
                  a pale, placid face, sleeping as one who has found eternal rest, and the two
                  weeping children striving in vain to make her hear.</p>
               <p>Old Crab had been up early in his design of "carting the 'hull lot over to the
                  poor-house," but made a solemn pause when his wife drew him into the little
                  chamber. Death has a strange dignity, and whatsoever child of Adam he lays his
                  hand on is for the time ennobled,—removed from the region of the earthly and
                  commonplace to that of the spiritual and mysterious. And when Crab found, by
                  searching the little bundle of the deceased, that there was actually money enough
                  in it to buy a coffin and pay 'Zekiel Stebbins for digging the grave, he began to
                  look on the woman as having made a respectable and edifying end, and the whole
                  affair as coming to a better issue than he had feared.</p>
               <p>And so the event was considered in the neighborhood, in a melancholy way, rather
                  an interesting and auspicious one. It gave something to talk about in a region
                  where exciting topics were remarkably scarce. The Reverend Jabez Periwinkle found
                  in it a moving Providence which started him favorably on a sermon, and the funeral
                  had been quite a windfall to all the gossips about; and now remained the question,
                  What was to be done with the children?</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7953-00000054"/>
               <p>"Now that we are diggin' the 'taters," said old Crab, "that 'ere chap might be
                  good for suthin', pickin' on 'em out o' the hills. Poor folks like us can't afford
                  to keep nobody jest to look at, and so he'll have to step spry and work smart to
                  airn his keep." And so at early dawn, the day after the funeral, the little boy
                  was roused up and carried into the fields with the men.</p>
               <p>But "this 'ere"—that is to say, a beautiful little girl of seven years—had greatly
                  puzzled the heads of the worthy gossips of the neighborhood. Miss Asphyxia Smith,
                  the elder sister of old Crab, was at this moment turning the child round, and
                  examining her through a pair of large horn spectacles, with a view to "taking her
                  to raise," as she phrased it.</p>
               <p>Now all Miss Asphyxia's ideas of the purpose and aim of human existence were
                  comprised in one word,—work. She was herself a working machine, always wound up
                  and going,—up at early cock-crowing, and busy till bedtime, with a rampant and
                  fatiguing industry that never paused for a moment. She conducted a large farm by
                  the aid of a hired man, and drove a flourishing dairy, and was universally
                  respected in the neighborhood as a smart woman.</p>
               <p>Latterly, as her young cousin, who had shared the toils of the house with her, had
                  married and left her, Miss Asphyxia had talked of "talkin' a child from the
                  poor-house, and so raisin' her own help"; and it was with the view of this
                  "raisin' her help," that she was thus turning over and inspecting the little
                  article which we have spoken of.</p>
               <p>Apparently she was somewhat puzzled, and rather scandalized, that Nature should
                  evidently have expended so much in a merely ornamental way on an article which
                  ought to have been made simply for service. She brushed up a handful of the
                  clustering curls in her large, bony hand, and said, with a sniff, "These'll have
                  to come right off to begin with; gracious me, what a tangle!"</p>
               <p>"Mother always brushed them out every day," said the child.</p>
               <p>"And who do you suppose is going to spend an hour every day brushing your hair,
                  Miss Pert?" said Miss Asphyxia. "That ain't what I take ye for, I tell you. You
                  've got to learn to work for your living; and you ought to be thankful if I'm
                  willing to show you how."</p>
               <p>The little girl did not appear particularly thankful. She bent her soft, pencilled
                  eyebrows in a dark frown, and her great hazel eyes had gathering in them a cloud
                  of sullen gloom. Miss Asphyxia did not mind her frowning,—perhaps did not notice
                  it. She had it settled in her mind, as a first principle, that children never
                  liked anything that was good for them, and that, of course, if she took a child,
                  it would have to be made to come to her by forcible proceedings promptly
                  instituted. So she set her little subject before her by seizing her by her two
                  shoulders and squaring her round and looking in her face, and opened direct
                  conversation with her in the following succinct manner.</p>
               <p>"What's your name?"</p>
               <p>Then followed a resolved and gloomy silence, as the large bright eyes surveyed,
                  with a sort of defiant glance, the inquisitor.</p>
               <p>"Don't you hear?" said Miss Asphyxia, giving her a shake.</p>
               <p>"Don't be so ha'sh with her," said the little old woman. "Say, my little dear,
                  tell Miss Asphyxia your name," she added, taking the child's hand.</p>
               <p>"Eglantine Percival," said the little girl, turning towards the old woman, as if
                  she disdained to answer the other party in the conversation.</p>
               <p>"Wh—a—t?" said Miss Asphyxia. "If there ain't the beatin'est name ever I heard.
                  Well, I tell you <emph>I</emph> ain't got time to fix <emph>my</emph> mouth to say
                  all that 'ere every time I want ye, now I tell ye."</p>
               <p>"Mother and Harry called me Tina," said the child.</p>
               <p>"Teny! Well, I should think so," said Miss Asphyxia. "That showed she 'd got a
                  grain o' sense left, anyhow. She 's tol'able strong and well-limbed for her age,"
                  added that lady, feeling of the child's arms and limbs; "her flesh is solid. I
                  think she 'll make a strong woman, only put her to work early and keep her at it.
                  I could rub out clothes at the wash-tub afore I was at her age."</p>
               <p>"O, she can do considerable many little chores," said Old Crab's wife.</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7953-00000055"/>
               <p>"Yes," said Miss Asphyxia; "there can a good deal be got out of a child if you
                  keep at 'em, hold 'em in tight, and never let 'em have their head a minute; push
                  right hard on behind 'em, and you get considerable. That's the way I was
                  raised."</p>
               <p>"But I want to play," said the little girl, bursting out in a sobbing storm of
                  mingled fear and grief.</p>
               <p>"Want to play, do you? Well, you must get over that. Don't you know that that 's
                  as bad as stealing? You have n't got any money, and if you eat folks's bread and
                  butter, you've got to work to pay for it; and if folks buy your clothes, you've
                  got to work to pay for them."</p>
               <p>"But I've got some clothes of my own," persisted the child, determined not to give
                  up her case entirely.</p>
               <p>"Well, so you have; but there ain't no sort of wear in 'em," said Miss Asphyxia,
                  turning to Mrs. Smith. "Them two dresses o'hern might answer for Sundays and sich,
                  but I'll have to make her up a regular linsey working dress this fall, and check
                  aprons; and she must set right about knitting every minute she is n't doing
                  anything else. Did you ever learn how to knit?"</p>
               <p>"No," said the child.</p>
               <p>"Or to sew?" said Miss Asphyxia.</p>
               <p>"Yes; mother taught me to sew," said the child.</p>
               <p>"No! Yes! Hain't you learned manners? Do you say yes and no to people?"</p>
               <p>The child stood a moment, swelling with suppressed feeling, and at last she opened
                  her great eyes full on Miss Asphyxia, and said, "I don't like you. You ain't
                  pretty, and I won't go with you."</p>
               <p>"O now," said Mrs. Smith, "little girls must n't talk so; that's naughty."</p>
               <p>"Don't like me?—ain't I pretty?" said Miss Asphyxia, with a short, grim laugh.
                  "May be I ain't; but I know what I 'm about, and you 'd as goods know it first as
                  last. I 'm going to take ye right out with me in the waggin, and you 'd best not
                  have none of your cuttin's up. I keep a stick at home for naughty girls. Why,
                  where do you suppose you 're going to get your livin' if I don't take you?"</p>
               <p>"I want to live with Harry," said the child, sobbing. "Where is Harry?"</p>
               <p>"Harry 's to work,—and there 's where he 's got to be," said Miss Asphyxia. "He 's
                  got to work with the men in the fields, and you 've got to come home and work with
                  me."</p>
               <p>"I want to stay with Harry,—Harry takes care of me," said the child, in a piteous
                  tone.</p>
               <p>Old Mother Smith now toddled to her milk-room, and, with a melting heart, brought
                  out a doughnut. "There now, eat that," she said; "and mebbe, if you 're good, Miss
                  Asphyxia will bring you down here some time."</p>
               <p>"O laws, Polly, you allers was a fool!" said Miss Asphyxia. "It's all for the
                  child's good, and what's the use of fussin' on her up? She'll come to it when she
                  knows she 's got to. 'T ain't no more than I was put to at her age, only the
                  child's been fooled with and babied."</p>
               <p>The little one refused the doughnut, and seemed to gather herself up in silent
                  gloom.</p>
               <p>"Come, now, don't stand sulking; let me put your bonnet on," said Miss Asphyxia,
                  in a brisk, metallic voice. "I can't be losin' the best part of my day with this
                  nonsense!" And forthwith she clawed up the child in her bony grasp, as easily as
                  an eagle might truss a chick-sparrow.</p>
               <p>"Be a good little girl, now," said the little gray woman, who felt a strange
                  swelling and throbbing in her poor old breast. To be sure, she knew she was a
                  fool; her husband had told her so at least three times every day for years; and
                  Miss Asphyxia only confirmed what she accepted familiarly as the truth. But yet
                  she could not help these unprofitable longings to coddle and comfort something,—to
                  do some of those little motherly tendernesses for children which go to no
                  particular result, only to make them happy; so she ran out after the wagon with a
                  tempting seed-cake, and forced it into the child's hand.</p>
               <p>"Take it, do take it," she said; "eat it, and be a good girl, and do just as she
                  tells you to."</p>
               <p>"I'll see to that," said Miss Asphyxia, as she gathered up the reins and gave a
                  cut to her horse, which started that quadruped<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000056"/> from a dream of green grass into a most animated
                  pace. Every creature in her service—horse, cow, and pig—knew at once the touch of
                  Miss Asphyxia, and the necessity of being up and doing when she was behind them;
                  and the horse, who under other hands would have been the slowest and most
                  reflective of beasts, now made the little wagon spin and bounce over the rough,
                  stony road, so that the child's short legs flew up in the air every few
                  moments.</p>
               <p>"You must hold on tight," was Miss Asphyxia's only comment on this circumstance.
                  "If you fall out, you 'll break your neck!"</p>
               <p>It was a glorious day of early autumn, the sun shining as only an autumn sun knows
                  how to shine. The blue fields of heaven were full of fleecy flocks of clouds,
                  drifting hither and thither at their lazy will. The golden-rod and the aster hung
                  their plumage over the rough, rocky road; and now and then it wound through a
                  sombre piece of woods, where scarlet sumachs and maples flashed out among the
                  gloomy green hemlocks with a solemn and gorgeous light. So very fair was the day,
                  and so full of life and beauty was the landscape, that the child, who came of a
                  beauty-loving lineage, felt her little heart drawn out from under its burden of
                  troubles, and springing and bounding with that elastic habit of happiness which
                  seems hard to kill in children.</p>
               <p>Once she laughed out as a squirrel, with his little chops swelled with a nut on
                  each side, sat upon the fence and looked after them, and then whisked away behind
                  the stone wall; and once she called out, "O, how pretty!" at a splendid clump of
                  blue fringed gentian, which stood holding up its hundred azure vases by the
                  wayside. "O, I do wish I could get some of that!" she cried out, impulsively.</p>
               <p>"Some of what?" said Miss Asphyxia.</p>
               <p>"O, those <emph>beautiful</emph> flowers!" said the child, leaning far out to look
                  back.</p>
               <p>"O, that's nothing but gentian," said Miss Asphyxia; "can't stop for that. Them
                  blows is good to dry for weakness," she added. "By and by, if you're good, mebbe
                  I'll let you get some on 'em."</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia had one word for all flowers. She called them all "blows," and they
                  were divided in her mind, in a manner far more simple than any botanical system,
                  into two classes; namely, blows that were good to dry, and blows that were not.
                  Elder-blow, catnip, hoarhound, hardhack, gentian, ginseng, and various other
                  vegetable tribes, she knew well and had a great respect for; but all the other
                  little weeds that put on obtrusive colors and flaunted in the summer breeze,
                  without any pretensions to further usefulness, Miss Asphyxia completely ignored.
                  It would not be describing her state to say she had a contempt for them: she
                  simply never saw or thought of them at all. The idea of beauty as connected with
                  any of them never entered her mind,—it did not exist there.</p>
               <p>The young cousin who shared her housework had, to be sure, planted a few flowers
                  in a corner of the garden; there were some peonies and pinks and a rose-bush,
                  which often occupied a spare hour of the girl's morning or evening; but Miss
                  Asphyxia watched these operations with a sublime contempt, and only calculated the
                  loss of potatoes and carrots caused by this unproductive beauty. Since the
                  marriage of this girl, Miss Asphyxia had often spoken to her man about "clearing
                  out them things"; but somehow he always managed to forget it, and the thriftless
                  beauties still remained.</p>
               <p>It wanted but about an hour of noon when Miss Asphyxia set down the little girl on
                  the clean-scrubbed floor of a great kitchen, where everything was even desolately
                  orderly and neat. She swung her at once into a chair. "Sit there," she said, "till
                  I 'm ready to see to ye." And then, marching up to her own room, she laid aside
                  her bonnet, and, coming down, plunged into active preparations for the dinner.</p>
               <p>An irrepressible feeling of desolation came over the child. The elation produced
                  by the ride died away; and, as she sat dangling her heels from the chair, and
                  watching the dry, grim form of Miss Asphyxia, a sort of terror of her began slowly
                  to usurp the place of that courage which had at first inspired the child to rise
                  up against the assertion of so uncongenial a power.</p>
               <p>All the strange, dreadful events of the last few days mingled themselves, in her
                  childish mind, in a weird mass of uncomprehended<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000057"/> hended gloom and mystery. Her mother, so
                  changed,—cold, stiff, lifeless, neither smiling nor speaking nor looking at her;
                  the people coming to the house, and talking and singing and praying, and then
                  putting her in a box in the ground, and saying that she was dead; and then, right
                  upon that, to be torn from her brother, to whom she had always looked for
                  protection and counsel,—all this seemed a weird, inexplicable cloud coming over
                  her heart and darkening all her little life. Where was Harry? Why did he let them
                  take her? Or perhaps equally dreadful people had taken him, and would never bring
                  him back again.</p>
               <p>There was a tall black clock in a corner of the kitchen, that kept its invariable
                  monotone of tick-tack, tick-tack, with a persistence that made her head swim; and
                  she watched the quick, decisive movements of Miss Asphyxia with somewhat of the
                  same respectful awe with which one watches the course of a locomotive engine.</p>
               <p>It was late for Miss Asphyxia's dinner preparations, but she instituted prompt
                  measures to make up for lost time. She flew about the kitchen with such long-armed
                  activity and fearful celerity, that the child began instinctively to duck and bob
                  her little head when she went by, lest she should hit her and knock her off her
                  chair.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia raked open the fire in the great kitchen chimney, and built it up
                  with a liberal supply of wood; then she rattled into the back room, and a sound
                  was heard of a bucket descending into a well with such frantic haste as only an
                  oaken bucket under Miss Asphyxia's hands could be frightened into. Back she came
                  with a stout black iron tea-kettle, which she hung over the fire; and then,
                  flopping down a ham on the table, she cut off slices with a martial and determined
                  air, as if she would like to see the ham try to help itself; and, before the child
                  could fairly see what she was doing, the slices of ham were in the frying-pan over
                  the coals, the ham hung up in its place, the knife wiped and put out of sight, and
                  the table drawn out into the middle of the floor, and invested with a cloth for
                  dinner.</p>
               <p>During these operations the child followed every movement with awe-struck eyes,
                  and studied with trembling attention every feature of this wonderful woman.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia was tall and spare. Nature had made her, as she often remarked of
                  herself, entirely for use. She had allowed for her muscles no cushioned repose of
                  fat, no redundant smoothness of outline. There was nothing to her but good,
                  strong, solid bone, and tough, wiry, well-strung muscle. She was past fifty, and
                  her hair was already well streaked with gray, and so thin that, when tightly
                  combed and tied, it still showed bald cracks, not very sightly to the eye. The
                  only thought that Miss Asphyxia ever had had in relation to the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">coiffure</foreign> of her hair was that it was to be got out of
                  her way. Hair she considered principally as something that might get into people's
                  eyes, if not properly attended to; and accordingly, at a very early hour every
                  morning, she tied all hers in a very tight knot, and then secured it by a horn
                  comb on the top of her head. To tie this knot so tightly that, once done, it
                  should last all day, was Miss Asphyxia's only art of the toilet, and she tried her
                  work every morning by giving her head a shake, before she left her looking-glass,
                  not unlike that of an unruly cow. If this process did not start the horn comb from
                  its moorings, Miss Asphyxia was well pleased. For the rest, her face was dusky and
                  wilted,—guarded by gaunt, high cheek-bones, and watched over by a pair of small
                  gray eyes of unsleeping vigilance. The shaggy eyebrows that overhung them were
                  grizzled, like her hair.</p>
               <p>It would not be proper to say that Miss Asphyxia looked ill-tempered; but her
                  features could never, by any stretch of imagination, be supposed to wear an
                  expression of tenderness. They were set in an austere, grim gravity, whose lines
                  had become more deeply channelled by every year of her life. As related to her
                  fellow-creatures, she was neither passionate nor cruel. We have before described
                  her as a working machine, forever wound up to high-pressure working-point; and
                  this being her nature, she trod down and crushed whatever stood in the way of her
                  work, with as little compunction as if she had been a steam-engine or a
                  power-loom.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia had a full conviction of what a recent pleasant<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000058"/> writer has denominated the total depravity of
                  matter. She was not given to many words, but it might often be gathered from her
                  brief discourses that she had always felt herself, so to speak, sword in hand
                  against a universe where everything was running to disorder,—everything was
                  tending to slackness, shiftlessness, unthrift, and she alone was left on the earth
                  to keep things in their places. Her hired men were always too late up in the
                  morning,—always shirking,—always taking too long a nap at noon; everybody was
                  watching to cheat her in every bargain; her horse, cow, pigs,—all her
                  possessions,—were ready at the slightest winking of her eye, or relaxing of her
                  watch, to fall into all sorts of untoward ways and gyrations; and therefore she
                  slept, as it were, in her armor, and spent her life as a sentinel on duty.</p>
               <p>In taking a child, she had had her eyes open only to one patent fact,—that a child
                  was an animal who would always be wanting to play, and that she must make all her
                  plans and calculations to keep her from playing. To this end she had beforehand
                  given out word to her brother, that, if she took the girl, the boy must be kept
                  away. "Got enough on my hands now, without havin' a boy trainin' round my house,
                  and upsettin' all creation," said the grim virgin.</p>
               <p>"Wal, wal," said Old Crab, "'t ain't best; they 'll be a consultin' together, and
                  cuttin' up didos. I'll keep the boy tight enough, I tell you."</p>
               <p>Little enough was the dinner that the child ate that day. There were two hulking,
                  square-shouldered men at the table, who stared at her with great round eyes like
                  oxen; and so, though Miss Asphyxia dumped down Indian pudding, ham, and fried
                  potatoes before her, the child's eating was scarcely that of a blackbird.</p>
               <p>Marvellous to the little girl was the celerity with which Miss Asphyxia washed and
                  cleared up the dinner-dishes. How the dishes rattled, the knives and forks
                  clinked, as she scraped and piled and washed and wiped and put everything in a
                  trice back into such perfect place, that it looked as if nothing had ever been
                  done on the premises!</p>
               <p>After this Miss Asphyxia produced thimble, thread, needle, and scissors, and,
                  drawing out of a closet a bale of coarse blue home-made cloth, proceeded to
                  measure the little girl for a petticoat and short gown of the same. This being
                  done to her mind, she dumped her into a chair beside her, and, putting a brown
                  towel into her hands to be hemmed, she briefly said, "There, keep to work"; while
                  she, with great despatch and resolution, set to work on the little garments
                  aforesaid.</p>
               <p>The child once or twice laid down her work to watch the chickens who came up round
                  the door, or to note a bird which flew by with a little ripple of song. The first
                  time, Miss Asphyxia only frowned, and said, "Tut, tut." The second time, there
                  came three thumps of Miss Asphyxia's thimble down on the little head, with the
                  admonition, "Mind your work." The child now began to cry, but Miss Asphyxia soon
                  put an end to that by displaying a long birch rod, with a threatening movement,
                  and saying succinctly, "Stop that, this minute, or I'll whip you." And the child
                  was so certain of this that she swallowed her grief and stitched away as fast as
                  her little fingers could go.</p>
               <p>As soon as supper was over that night, Miss Asphyxia seized upon the child, and,
                  taking her to a tub in the sink-room, proceeded to divest her of her garments and
                  subject her to a most thorough ablution.</p>
               <p>"I'm goin' to give you one good scrubbin' to start with," said Miss Asphyxia; and,
                  truth to say, no word could more thoroughly express the character of the ablution
                  than the term "scrubbing." The poor child was deluged with soap and water, in
                  mouth, nose, ears, and eyes, while the great bony hands rubbed and splashed,
                  twisted her arms, turned her ears wrong side out, and dashed on the water with
                  unsparing vigor. Nobody can tell the torture which can be inflicted on a child in
                  one of these vigorous old New England washings, which used to make Saturday night
                  a terror in good families. But whatever they were, the little martyr was by this
                  time so thoroughly impressed with the awful reality of Miss Asphyxia's power over
                  her, that she endured all with only a few long-drawn and convulsed sighs, and an
                  inaudible "O dear!"</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7953-00000059"/>
               <p>When well scrubbed and wiped, Miss Asphyxia put on a coarse homespun nightgown,
                  and, pinning a cloth round the child's neck, began with her scissors the work of
                  cutting off her hair. Snip, snip, went the fatal shears, and down into the towel
                  fell bright curls, once the pride of a mother's heart, till finally the small head
                  was despoiled completely. Then Miss Asphyxia, shaking up a bottle of camphor,
                  proceeded to rub some vigorously upon the child's head. "There," she said, "that's
                  to keep ye from catchin' cold."</p>
               <p>She then proceeded to the kitchen, raked open the fire, and shook the golden curls
                  into the bed of embers, and stood grimly over them while they seethed and twisted
                  and writhed, as if they had been living things suffering a fiery torture,
                  meanwhile picking diligently at the cloth that had contained them, that no stray
                  hair might escape.</p>
               <p>"I wonder now," she said to herself, "if any of this will rise and get into the
                  next pudding?" She spoke with a spice of bitterness, poor woman, as if it would be
                  just the way things usually went on, if it did.</p>
               <p>She buried the fire carefully, and then, opening the door of a small bedroom
                  adjoining, which displayed a single bed, she said, "Now get into bed."</p>
               <p>The child immediately obeyed, thankful to hide herself under the protecting folds
                  of a blue checked coverlet, and feeling that at last the dreadful Miss Asphyxia
                  would leave her to herself.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia clapped to the door, and the child drew a long breath. In a moment,
                  however, the door flew open. Miss Asphyxia had forgotten something. "Can you say
                  your prayers?" she demanded.</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am," said the child.</p>
               <p>"Say 'em, then," said Miss Asphyxia; and bang went the door again.</p>
               <p>"There, now, if I hain't done up my duty to that child, then I don't know," said
                  Miss Asphyxia.</p>

               <head type="sub">HARRY'S FIRST DAY'S WORK.</head>
               <p>IT was the fashion of olden times to consider children only as children pure and
                  simple; not as having any special and individual nature which required special and
                  individual adaptation, but as being simply so many little creatures to be washed,
                  dressed, schooled, fed, and whipped, according to certain general and
                  well-understood rules.</p>
               <p>The philosophy of modern society is showing to parents and educators how delicate
                  and how varied is their task; but in the days we speak of nobody had thought of
                  these shadings and variations. It is perhaps true, that in that very primitive and
                  simple state of society there were fewer of those individual peculiarities which
                  are the result of the stimulated brains and nervous systems of modern society.</p>
               <p>Be that as it may, the little parish of Needmore saw nothing in the fact that two
                  orphan children had fallen into the hands of Crab Smith and his sister, Miss
                  Asphyxia, which appeared to its moral sense as at all unsuitable. To be sure,
                  there was a suppressed shrug of the shoulders at the idea of the little
                  fair-haired, pleasant-mannered boy being given up to Old Crab. People said to each
                  other, with a knowing grin: "That 'ere boy 'd have to toe the mark pretty
                  handsome; but then, he might do wus. He 'd have enough to eat and drink anyhow,
                  and old Ma'am Smith, she 'd mother him. As to Miss Asphyxia and the girl, why, 't
                  was jest the thing. She was jest the hand to raise a smart girl."</p>
               <p>In fact, we are not certain that Miss Asphyxia, with a few modifications and
                  fashionable shadings suitable for our modern society, is not, after all, the ideal
                  personage who would get all votes as just the proper person to take charge of an
                  orphan asylum,—would be recommended to widowers with large families as just the
                  woman to bring up their children.</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7953-00000060"/>
               <p>Efficiency has always been, in our New England, the golden calf before which we
                  have fallen down and worshipped. The great granite formation of physical needs and
                  wants that underlie life in a country with a hard soil and a severe climate gives
                  an intensity to our valuation of what pertains to the working of the direct and
                  positive force that controls the physical; and that which can keep in constant
                  order the eating, drinking, and wearing of this mortal body is always asserting
                  itself in every department of life as the true wisdom.</p>
               <p>But what, in fact, were the two little children who had been thus seized on and
                  appropriated?</p>
               <p>The boy was, as we have described, of a delicate and highly nervous
                  organization,—sensitive, æsthetic,—evidently fitted by nature more for the poet or
                  scholar than for the rough grind of physical toil. There had been superinduced on
                  this temperament a precocious development from the circumstance of his having been
                  made, during the earliest years of his consciousness, the companion of his mother.
                  Nothing unfolds a child faster than being thus taken into the companionship of
                  older minds in the first years of life. He was naturally one of those manly,
                  good-natured, even-tempered children that are the delight of nurses and the staff
                  and stay of mothers. Early responsibility and sorrow, and the religious teachings
                  of his mother, had awakened the spiritual part of his nature to a higher
                  consciousness than usually exists in childhood. There was about him a steady,
                  uncorrupted goodness and faithfulness of nature, a simple, direct truthfulness,
                  and a loyal habit of prompt obedience to elders, which made him one of those
                  children likely, in every position of child-life, to be favorites, and to run a
                  smooth course.</p>
               <p>The girl, on the contrary, had in her all the elements of a little bundle of
                  womanhood, born to rule and command in a pure womanly way. She was affectionate,
                  gay, pleasure-loving, self-willed, imperious, intensely fond of approbation, with
                  great stores of fancy, imagination, and an under-heat of undeveloped passion that
                  would, in future life, give warmth and color to all her thoughts, as a volcanic
                  soil is said to brighten the hues of flowers and warm the flavor of grapes. She
                  had, too, that capacity of secretiveness which enabled her to carry out the
                  dictates of a strong will, and an intuitive sense of where to throw a tendril or
                  strike a little fibre of persuasion or coaxing, which comes early to those fair
                  parasites who are to live by climbing upon others, and to draw their hues and
                  sweetness from the warmth of other hearts. The moral and religious faculties were
                  as undeveloped in her as in a squirrel or a robin. She had lived, in fact, between
                  her sorrowing mother and her thoughtful little brother, as a beautiful pet, whose
                  little gladsome ways and gay pranks were the only solace of their poverty. Even
                  the father, in good-natured hours, had caressed her, played with her, told her
                  stories, and allowed all her little audacities and liberties with an indulgence
                  that her brother could not dare to hope for. No service or self-denial had ever
                  been required of her. She had been served, with a delicate and exact care, by both
                  mother and brother.</p>
               <p>Such were the two little specimens of mortality which the town of Needmore thought
                  well provided for when they were consigned to Crab Smith and Miss Asphyxia.</p>
               <p>The first day after the funeral of his mother, the boy had been called up before
                  light in the morning, and been off at sunrise to the fields with the men; but he
                  had gone with a heart of manly enterprise, feeling as if he were beginning life on
                  his own account, and meaning, with straightforward simplicity, to do his best.</p>
               <p>He assented to Old Crab's harsh orders with such obedient submission, and set
                  about the work given him with such a steady, manly patience and good-will, as to
                  win for himself, at the outset, golden opinions from the hired men, and to excite
                  in Old Crab that discontented satisfaction which he felt in an employee in whom he
                  could find nothing to scold. The work of merely picking up the potatoes from the
                  hills which the men opened was so very simple as to give no chance for mistake or
                  failure, and the boy was so cheerful and unintermitting in his work that no fault
                  could be found under that head. He was tired enough, it is true, at night; but, as
                  he rode home in the cart, he solaced himself with the idea that he was beginning
                  to be a man, and that he should work and support his sister,—and he had many
                  things to tell<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7953-00000061"/> her of the result of his
                  first day's labor. He wondered that she did not come to meet him as the cart drove
                  up to the house, and his first inquiry, when he saw the friendly old woman, was,
                  "Where is Tina?"</p>
               <p>"She 's gone to live with <emph>his</emph> sister," said Mrs. Smith, in an
                  undertone, pointing to her husband in the back yard. "Asphyxia 's took her to
                  raise."</p>
               <p>"To what?" said the boy, timidly.</p>
               <p>"Why, to fetch her up,—teach her to work," said the little old woman. "But come,
                  sonny, go wash your hands to the sink. Dear me! why, you 've fairly took the skin
                  off your fingers."</p>
               <p>"I 'm not much used to work," said the boy, "but I don't mind it." And he washed
                  carefully the little hands, which, sure enough, had the skin somewhat abraded on
                  the finger-ends.</p>
               <p>"Do ye good," said Old Crab. "Must n't mind that. Can't have no lily-fingered boys
                  workin' for me."</p>
               <p>The child had not thought of complaining; but as soon as he was alone with Mrs.
                  Smith, he came to her confidentially and said, "How far is it to where Tina
                  lives?"</p>
               <p>"Well, it's the best part of two miles, I calculate."</p>
               <p>"Can't I go over there to-night and see her?"</p>
               <p>"Dear heart! no, you can't. Why, your little back must ache now, and he 'll have
                  you routed up by four o'clock in the morning."</p>
               <p>"I 'm not so very tired," said the boy; "but I want to see Tina. If you'll show me
                  the way, I'll go."</p>
               <p>"O, well, you see, they won't let you," said the old woman, confidentially. "They
                  are a ha'sh pair of 'em, him and Sphyxy are; and they 've settled it that you
                  ain't to see each other no more, for fear you 'd get to playin' and idlin'."</p>
               <p>The blood flushed into the boy's face, and he breathed short. Something stirred
                  within him, such as makes slavery bitter, as he said, "But that is n't right.
                  She's my only sister, and my mother told me to take care of her; and I
                     <emph>ought</emph> to see her sometimes."</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy!" said Goody Smith; "when you 're with some folks, it don't make no
                  difference what's right and what ain't. You 've jest got to do as ye ken. It won't
                  do to rile <emph>him,</emph> I tell you. He 's awful, once git his back up." And
                  Goody Smith shook her little old head mysteriously, and hushed the boy, as she
                  heard her husband's heavy tread coming in from the barn.</p>
               <p>The supper of cold beef and pork, potatoes, turnips, and hard cider, which was now
                  dispensed at the farm-house, was ample for all purposes of satisfying hunger; and
                  the little Harry, tired as he was, ate with a vigorous relish. But his mind was
                  still dwelling on his sister.</p>
               <p>After supper was over he followed Goody Smith into her milk-room. "Please do ask
                     <emph>him</emph> to let me go and see Tina," he said, persuasively.</p>
               <p>"Laws a massy, ye poor dear! ye don't know the critter. If <emph>I</emph> ask him
                  to do a thing, he 's all the more set agin it. I found out that 'ere years ago. He
                  never does nothin' <emph>I</emph> ask him to. But never mind; some of these days,
                  we 'll try and contrive it. When he 's gone to mill, I'll speak to the men, and
                  tell 'em to let ye slip off. But then the pester on 't is, there 's Sphyxy; she's
                  allers wide awake, and would n't let a boy come near her house no more than ef he
                  was a bulldog."</p>
               <p>"Why, what harm do boys do?" said the child, to whom this view presented an
                  entirely new idea.</p>
               <p>"O, well, she 's an old maid, and kind o' set in her ways; and it ain't easy
                  gettin' round Sphyxy; but I 'll try and contrive it. Sometimes I can get round
                  'em, and get something done, when they don't know nothin' about it; but it's
                  drefful hard gettin' things done."</p>
               <p>The view thus presented to the child's mind of the cowering, deceptive policy in
                  which the poor old woman's whole married life had been spent gave him much to
                  think of after he had gone to his bedroom.</p>
               <p>He sat down on his little, lonely bed, and began trying to comprehend in his own
                  mind the events of the last few days. He recalled his mother's last conversation
                  with him. All had happened just as she had said. She was gone, just as she had
                  told him, and left him and little Tina alone in the world. Then he remembered his
                  promise, and, kneeling down by his bedside, repeated the simple litany—psalm,
                  prayer, and hymn—which<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7953-00000062"/> his mother had
                  left him as her only parting gift. The words soothed his little lonesome heart;
                  and he thought what his mother said,—he recalled the look of her dying eyes as she
                  said it,—"Never doubt that God loves you, whatever happens; and, if you have any
                  trouble, pray to him." Upon this thought, he added to his prayer these words: "O
                  dear Father! they have taken away Tina; and she's a very little girl, and cannot
                  work, as I can. Please do take care of Tina, and make them let me go and see
                  her."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <head type="sub">MISS ASPHYXIA'S SYSTEM.</head>
               <p>WHEN Miss Asphyxia shut the door finally on little Tina, the child began slowly to
                  gather up her faculties from the stunning, benumbing influence of the change which
                  had come over her life.</p>
               <p>In former days her father had told her stories of little girls that were carried
                  off to giants' houses, and there maltreated and dominated over in very dreadful
                  ways; and Miss Asphyxia presented herself to her as one of these giants. She was
                  so terribly strong, the child felt instinctively, in every limb, that there was no
                  getting away from her. Her eyes were so keen and searching, her voice so sharp,
                  all her movements so full of a vigor that might be felt, that any chance of
                  getting the better of her by indirect ways seemed hopelessly small. If she should
                  try to run away to find Harry, she was quite sure that Miss Asphyxia could make a
                  long arm that would reach her before she had gone far; and then what she would do
                  to her was a matter that she dared not think of. Even when she was not meaning to
                  be cross to her, but merely seized and swung her into a chair, she had such a grip
                  that it almost gave pain; and what would it be if she seized her in wrath? No;
                  there was evidently no escape; and, as the thought came over the child, she began
                  to cry,—first sobbing, and then, as her agitation increased, screaming
                  audibly.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia opened the door. "Stop that!" she said. "What under the canopy ails
                  ye?"</p>
               <p>"I—want—Harry!" said the child.</p>
               <p>"Well, you can't have Harry; and I won't have ye bawling. Now shut up and go to
                  sleep, or I 'll whip you!" And, with that, Miss Asphyxia turned down the
                  bedclothes with a resolute hand.</p>
               <p>"I will be good,—I will stop," said the child, in mortal terror, compressing the
                  sobs that seemed to tear her little frame.</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7953-00000063"/>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia waited a moment, and then, going out, shut the door, and went on
                  making up the child's stuff gown outside,</p>
               <p>"That 'ere 's goin' to be a regular limb," she said; "but I must begin as I 'm
                  goin' to go on with her, and mebbe she'll amount to suthin' by and by. A child's
                  pretty much dead loss the first three or four years; but after that they more 'n
                  pay, if they 're fetched up right."</p>
               <p>"Mebbe that 'ere child's lonesome," said Sol Peters, Miss Asphyxia's hired man,
                  who sat in the kitchen corner, putting in a new hoe-handle.</p>
               <p>"Lonesome!" said Miss Asphyxia, with a sniff of contempt.</p>
               <p>"All sorts of young critters is," said Sol, undismayed by this sniff. "Puppies is.
                  'Member how our Spot yelped when I fust got him? Kept me 'wake the biggest part of
                  one night. And kittens mews when ye take 'em from the cats. Ye see they' s used to
                  other critters; and it's sort o' cold like, bein' alone is."</p>
               <p>"Well, she'll have to get used to it, anyhow," said Miss Asphyxia. "I guess 't
                  won't kill her. Ef a child has enough to eat and drink, and plenty of clothes, and
                  somebody to take care of 'em, they ain't very bad off, if they be lonesome."</p>
               <p>Sol, though a big-fisted, hard-handed fellow, had still rather a soft spot under
                  his jacket in favor of all young, defenceless animals, and the sound of the little
                  girl's cry had gone right to this spot. So he still revolved the subject, as he
                  leisurely turned and scraped with a bit of broken glass the hoe-handle that he was
                  elaborating. After a considerable pause, he shut up one eye, looked along his
                  hoe-handle at Miss Asphyxia, as if he were taking aim, and remarked, "That 'ere
                  boy's a nice, stiddy little chap; and mebbe, if he could come down here once and a
                  while after work-hours, 't would kind o' reconcile her."</p>
               <p>"I tell you what, Solomon Peters," said Miss Asphyxia, "I 'd jest as soon have the
                  great red dragon in the Revelations a comin' down on my house as a boy! Ef I don't
                  work hard enough now, I'd like to know, without havin' a boy raound raisin'
                  gineral Cain. Don't tell me! I'll find work enough to keep that 'ere child from
                  bein' lonesome. Lonesome!—there did n't nobody think of no such things when I was
                  little. I was jest put right along, and no remarks made; and was made to mind when
                  I was spoken to, and to take things as they come. O, I'll find her work enough to
                  keep her mind occupied, I promise ye."</p>
               <p>Sol did not in the least doubt that, for Miss Asphyxia's reputation in the region
                  was perfectly established. She was spoken of with applause under such titles as "a
                  staver," "a pealer," "a roarer to work"; and Sol himself had an awful sense of
                  responsibility to her in this regard. He had arrived at something of a late era in
                  single life, and had sometimes been sportively jogged by his associates, at the
                  village store, as to his opportunity of becoming master of Miss Asphyxia's person
                  and property by matrimonial overtures; to all which he summarily responded by
                  declaring that "a hoss might as soon go a courtin' to the hosswhip as he court
                  Miss Sphyxy." As to Miss Asphyxia, when rallied on the same subject, she expressed
                  her views of the matrimonial estate in a sentence more terse and vigorous than
                  elegant,—that "she knew t' much to put her nose into hot swill." Queen Elizabeth
                  might have expressed her mind in a more courtly way, but certainly with no more
                  decision.</p>
               <p>The little head and heart in the next room were full of the rudiments of thoughts,
                  desires, feelings, imaginations, and passions which either had never lived in Miss
                  Asphyxia's nature, or had died so long ago that not a trace or memory of them was
                  left. If she had had even the dawnings of certain traits and properties, she might
                  have doubted of her ability to bring up a child; but she had not.</p>
               <p>Yet Miss Asphyxia's faults in this respect were not so widely different from the
                  practice of the hard, rustic inhabitants of Needmore as to have prevented her
                  getting employment as a district-school teacher for several terms, when she was
                  about twenty years of age. She was held to be a "smart," economical teacher,
                  inasmuch as she was able to hold the winter term, and thrash the very biggest
                  boys, and, while she did the duty of a man, received only the wages of a woman,—a
                  recommendation in female qualification which has not ceased to be available in our
                  modern days. Gradually, by incredible industries, by a faculty of pinching,<pb
                     n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7953-00000064"/> saving, and accumulating hard to
                  conceive of, Miss Asphyxia had laid up money till she had actually come to be the
                  possessor of a small but neat house, and a farm and dairy in excellent condition;
                  and she regarded herself, therefore, and was regarded by others, as a model for
                  imitation. Did she have the least doubt that she was eminently fitted to bring up
                  a girl? I trow not.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia, in her early childhood, had been taken to raise in the same manner
                  that she had taken this child. She had been trained to early rising, and constant,
                  hard, unintermitted work, without thought of respite or amusement. During certain
                  seasons of the year she had been sent to the district school, where, always
                  energetic in whatever she took in hand, she always stood at the head of the school
                  in the few arts of scholarship in those days taught. She could write a good, round
                  hand; she could cipher with quickness and adroitness; she had learned by heart all
                  the rules of Murray's Grammar, notwithstanding the fact that, from the habits of
                  early childhood, she habitually set at naught every one of them in her daily
                  conversation,—always strengthening all her denials with those good, hearty double
                  negatives which help out French and Italian sentences, and are unjustly denied to
                  the purists in genteel English. How much of the droll quaintness of Yankee dialect
                  comes from the stumbling of human nature into these racy mistakes will never be
                  known.</p>
               <p>Perhaps my readers may have turned over a great, flat stone some time in their
                  rural rambles, and found under it little clovers and tufts of grass pressed to
                  earth, flat, white, and bloodless, but still growing, stretching, creeping towards
                  the edges, where their plant instinct tells them there is light and deliverance.
                  The kind of life that the little Tina led, under the care of Miss Asphyxia,
                  resembled that of these poor clovers. It was all shut down and repressed, but
                  growing still. She was roused at the first glimmer of early dawn, dressing herself
                  in the dark, and, coming out, set the table for breakfast. From that time through
                  the day, one task followed another in immediate succession, with the sense of the
                  ever-driving Miss Asphyxia behind her.</p>
               <p>Once, in the course of her labors, she let fall a saucer, while Miss Asphyxia, by
                  good fortune, was out of the room. To tell of her mischance, and expose herself to
                  the awful consequences of her anger, was more than her childish courage was equal
                  to; and, with a quick adroitness, she slipped the broken fragments in a crevice
                  between the kitchen doorstep and the house, and endeavored to look as if nothing
                  had occurred. Alas! she had not counted on Miss Asphyxia's unsleeping vigilance of
                  hearing. She was down stairs in a trice.</p>
               <p>"What have you been breaking?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, ma'am," was the trembling response.</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me! I heard something fall."</p>
               <p>"I think it must have been the tongs," said the little girl,—not over-wise or
                  ingenious in her subterfuge.</p>
               <p>"Tongs! likely story," said Miss Asphyxia, keenly running her eye over the cups
                  and saucers.</p>
               <p>"One, two,—here's one of the saucers gone. What have you done with it?"</p>
               <p>The child, now desperate with fear, saw no refuge but in persistent denial, till
                  Miss Asphyxia, seizing her, threatened immediate whipping if she did not at once
                  confess.</p>
               <p>"I dropped a saucer," at last said the frightened child.</p>
               <p>"You did, you little slut?" said Miss Asphyxia, administering a box on her ear.
                  "Where is it? what have you done with the pieces?"</p>
               <p>"I dropped them down by the doorstep," said the sobbing culprit.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia soon fished them up, and held them up in awful judgment. "You 've
                  been telling me a lie,—a naughty, wicked lie," she said. "I'll soon cure you of
                  lying. I'll scour your mouth out for you." And forthwith, taking a rag with some
                  soap and sand, she grasped the child's head under her arm, and rubbed the harsh
                  mixture through her mouth with a vengeful energy. "There, now, see if you'll tell
                  me another lie," said she, pushing her from her. "Don't you know where liars go
                  to, you naughty, wicked girl? 'All liars shall have their part in the lake that
                  burns with fire and brimstone,'—that's what the Bible says; and you may thank me
                  for keeping you from going there.</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7953-00000065"/>
               <p>Now go and get up the potatoes and wash 'em, and don't let me get another lie out
                  of your mouth as long as you live."</p>
               <p>There was a burning sense of shame—a smothered fury of resentment—in the child's
                  breast, and, as she took the basket, she felt as if she would have liked to do
                  some mischief to Miss Asphyxia. "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you," she said to
                  herself when she got into the cellar, and fairly out of hearing. "I hate you, and
                  when I get to be a woman, I 'll pay you for all this."</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia, however, went on her way, in the testimony of a good conscience.
                  She felt that she had been equal to the emergency, and had met a crisis in the
                  most thorough and effectual manner.</p>
               <p>The teachers of district schools in those days often displayed a singular
                  ingenuity in the invention of punishments by which the different vices of
                  childhood should be repressed; and Miss Asphyxia's housewifely confidence in soap
                  and sand as a means of purification had suggested to her this expedient in her
                  school-teaching days. "You can break any child o' lying, right off short," she was
                  wont to say. "Jest scour their mouths out with soap and sand. They never want to
                  try it more 'n once or twice, I tell you."</p>
               <p>The intervals which the child had for play were, in Miss Asphyxia's calendar, few
                  and far between. Sometimes, when she had some domestic responsibility on her mind
                  which made the watching of the child a burden to her, she would say to her, "You
                  may go and play till I call you," or, "You may play for half an hour; but you must
                  n't go out of the yard."</p>
               <p>Then the child, alone, companionless, without playthings, sought to appropriate to
                  herself some little treasures and possessions for the instituting of that fairy
                  world of imagination which belongs to childhood. She sighed for a doll that had
                  once belonged to her in the days when she had a mother, but which Miss Asphyxia
                  had contemptuously tossed aside in making up her bundle.</p>
               <p>Left thus to her own resources, the child yet showed the unquenchable love of
                  beauty, and the power of creating and gilding an imaginary little world, which is
                  the birthright of childhood. She had her small store of what she had been wont to
                  call pretty things,—a broken teapot handle, a fragment of colored glass, part of a
                  goblet that had once belonged to Miss Asphyxia's treasures, one or two smooth
                  pebbles, and some red berries from a wild rose-bush. These were the darlings, the
                  dear delights of her heart,—hoarded in secret places, gazed on by stealth, taken
                  out and arranged and re-arranged, during the brief half-hours, or hours, when Miss
                  Asphyxia allowed her to play. To these treasures the kindly Sol added another; for
                  one day, when Miss Asphyxia was not looking, he drew from his vest-pocket a couple
                  of milkweed pods, and said, "Them 's putty,—mebbe ye 'd like 'em; hide 'em up,
                  though, or she 'll sweep 'em into the fire."</p>
               <p>No gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls ever made bright eyes open wider than did
                  the exploring the contents of these pods. It was silk and silver, fairy-spun
                  glass,—something so bright and soft that it really seemed dear to her; and she
                  took the shining silk fringes out and caressed them against her cheek, and wrapped
                  them in a little bit of paper, and put them in her bosom. They felt so soft and
                  downy,—they were so shining and bright,—and they were her own,—Sol had given them
                  to her. She meditated upon them as possessions of mysterious beauty and unknown
                  value. Unfortunately, one day Miss Asphyxia discovered her gazing upon this
                  treasure by stealth during her working hours.</p>
               <p>"What have you got there?" she said. "Bring it to me."</p>
               <p>The child reluctantly placed her treasure in the great bony claw.</p>
               <p>"Why, that 's milkweed silk," said Miss Asphyxia. "'T ain't good for nothin'. What
                  you doing with that?"</p>
               <p>"I like it because it 's pretty."</p>
               <p>"Fiddlestick!" said Miss Asphyxia, giving it a contemptuous toss. "I can't have
                  you making litter with such stuff round the house. Throw it in the fire."</p>
               <p>To do Miss Asphyxia justice, she would never have issued this order if she had had
                  the remotest conception how dear this apparent trash was to the hopeless little
                  heart.</p>
               <p>The child hesitated, and held her treasure firmly. Her breast<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000066"/> heaved, and there was a desperate glare in her soft
                  hazel eyes.</p>
               <p>"Throw it in the fire," said Miss Asphyxia, stamping her foot, as she thought she
                  saw risings of insubordination.</p>
               <p>The child threw it in, and saw her dear, beautiful treasure slowly consumed, with
                  a swelling and indignant heart. She was now sure that Miss Asphyxia hated her, and
                  only sought occasion to torment her.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia did not hate the child, nor did she love her. She regarded her
                  exactly as she did her broom and her rolling-pin and her spinning-wheel,—as an
                  implement or instrument which she was to fashion to her uses. She had a general
                  idea, too, of certain duties to her as a human being, which she expressed by the
                  phrase, "doing right by her,"—that is, to feed and clothe and teach her. In fact,
                  Miss Asphyxia believed fully in the golden rule of doing as she would be done by;
                  but if a lioness should do to a young lamb exactly as she would be done by, it
                  might be all the worse for the lamb.</p>
               <p>The little mind and heart were awakened to a perfect burning conflict of fear,
                  shame, anger, and a desire for revenge, which now overflowed with strange, bitter
                  waters that hitherto ignorantly happy valley of child-life. She had never had any
                  sense of moral or religious obligation, any more than a butterfly or a
                  canary-bird. She had, it is true, said her little prayers every night; but, as she
                  said to herself, she had always said them to mother or Harry, and now there was
                  nobody to say them to. Every night she thought of this when she lay down in her
                  joyless, lonesome bed; but the kindly fatigue which hard work brings soon weighed
                  down her eyes, and she slept soundly all night, and found herself hungry at
                  breakfast-time the next morning.</p>
               <p>On Sunday Miss Asphyxia rested from her labors,—a strange rest for a soul that had
                  nothing to do in the spiritual world. Miss Asphyxia was past middle life, and, as
                  she said, had never experienced religion,—a point which she regarded with some
                  bitterness, since, as she was wont to say, she had always been as honest in her
                  dealings and kept Sunday as strict as most church-members. Still, she would do her
                  best at giving religious instruction to the child; and accordingly the first
                  Sunday she was dressed in her best frock, and set up in a chair to be kept still
                  while the wagon was getting ready to "go to meetin'," and Miss Asphyxia tried to
                  put into her head the catechism made by that dear, friendly old lover of children,
                  Dr. Watts.</p>
               <p>But somehow the first question, benignly as it is worded, had a grim and
                  threatening sound as it came from the jaws of Miss Asphyxia, somewhat thus: "Stop
                  playing with your frock, and look right at me, now. 'Can you tell me, dear child,
                  who made you?'"</p>
               <p>Now the little one had often heard this point explained, but she felt small
                  disposition to give up her knowledge at this demand; so she only looked at Miss
                  Asphyxia in sulky silence.</p>
               <p>"Say, now, after me," said Miss Asphyxia, "'The great God that made heaven and
                  earth.'"</p>
               <p>The child repeated the words, in that mumbling, sulky manner which children use
                  when they are saying what does not please them.</p>
               <p>"Tina Percival," said Miss Asphyxia, in warlike tones, "do you speak out plain, or
                  I'll box yer ears."</p>
               <p>Thus warned, the child uttered her confession of faith audibly enough.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia was peculiarly harsh and emphatic on the answer which described the
                  omnipresence of the Supreme Being, and her harsh voice, croaking, "If I tell a
                  lie, He sees me,—if I speak an idle or wicked word, He hears me," seemed to the
                  child to have a ghastly triumph in it to confirm the idea that Miss Asphyxia's
                  awful tyranny was thoroughly backed up by that of a Being far more mighty, and
                  from whom there was no possible escape. Miss Asphyxia enforced this truth with a
                  coarse and homely eloquence, that there was no getting away from God,—that He
                  could see in the night just as plain as in the daytime,—see her in the yard, see
                  her in the barn, see her under the bed, see her down cellar; and that whenever she
                  did anything wrong He would write it down in a dreadful book, and on the Day of
                  Judgment she would have it all brought out upon her,—all which<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000067"/> the child heard with a stony, sullen despair. Miss
                  Asphyxia illustrated what became of naughty children by such legends as the story
                  of the two she-bears which came out of a wood and tare forty-and-two children who
                  mocked at old Elisha, till the rebellious auditor quaked in her little shoes, and
                  wondered if the bears would get Harry, and if Harry, after all, would not find
                  some way to get round the bears and come to her help.</p>
               <p>At meeting she at last saw Harry, seated, however, in a distant part of the house;
                  but her heart was ready to jump out of her breast to go to him; and when the
                  services were over she contrived to elude Miss Asphyxia, and, passing through the
                  throng, seized his hand just as he was going out, and whispered, "O Harry, Harry,
                  I do want to see you so much! Why don't you come to see me?"</p>
               <p>"They would n't let me, Tina," said Harry, drawing his sister into a little recess
                  made between the church and the horse-block,—an old-fashioned structure that used
                  to exist for the accommodation of those who came to church on horseback. "They
                  won't let me come. I wanted to come,—I wanted to see you so much!"</p>
               <p>"O Harry, I don't like her,—she is cross to me. Do take me away,—do, Harry! Let 's
                  run away together."</p>
               <p>"Where could we go, Tina?"</p>
               <p>"O, somewhere,—no matter where. I hate her. I won't stay with her. Say, Harry, I
                  sleep in a little room by the kitchen; come to my window some night and take me
                  away."</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps I will."</p>
               <p>"Here you are, you little minx," said Miss Asphyxia. "What you up to now? Come,
                  the waggin 's waiting,"—and, with a look of severe suspicion directed to Harry,
                  she seized the child and conveyed her to the wagon, and was soon driving off with
                  all speed homeward.</p>
               <p>That evening the boy pondered long and soberly. He had worked well and steadily
                  during the week, and felt no disposition to complain of his lot on that account,
                  being, as we have said, of a faithful and patient nature, and accepting what the
                  friendly hired men told him,—that work was good for little boys, that it would
                  make him grow strong, and that by and by he would be grown up and able to choose
                  his own work and master. But this separation from his little sister, and her
                  evident unhappiness, distressed him; he felt that she belonged to him, and that he
                  must care for her, and so, when he came home, he again followed Goody Smith to the
                  retirement of her milk-room.</p>
               <p>The poor woman had found a perfect summer of delight in her old age in having
                  around her the gentle-mannered, sweet-spoken, good boy, who had thus marvellously
                  fallen to her lot; and boundless was the loving-kindness with which she treated
                  him. Sweet-cakes were slipped into his hands at all odd intervals, choice morsels
                  set away for his consumption in secret places of the buttery, and many an adroit
                  lie told to Old Crab to secure for him extra indulgences, or prevent the
                  imposition of extra tasks; and many a little lie did she recommend to him, at
                  which the boy's honest nature and Christian education inclined him greatly to
                  wonder.</p>
               <p>That a grown-up, good old woman should tell lies, and advise little boys to tell
                  them, was one of those facts of human experience which he turned over in his mind
                  with wonder,—thinking it over with that quiet questioning which children practise
                  who have nobody of whom they dare make many inquiries. But today he was determined
                  to have something done about Tina, and so he began, "Please, won't you ask him to
                  let me go and see Tina to-night? It 's Sunday, and there is n't any work to
                  do."</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, child, he 's crabbeder Sundays than any other day, he has so much
                  time to graowl round. He drinks more cider; and Sunday night it 's always as much
                  as a body's life 's worth to go near him. I don't want you to get him sot agin ye.
                  He got sot agin Obed; and no critter knows why, except mebbe 'cause he was some
                  comfort to me. And ye oughter seen how he used that 'ere boy. Why, I've stood here
                  in the milk-room and heerd that 'ere boy's screeches clear from the stun pastur'.
                  Finally the men, they said they could n't stan' it, nor they would n't."</p>
               <p>"Who was Obed?" said Harry, fearfully.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy! wal, I forgot ye did n't know Obed. He was the baby, ye see. He was
                  born the eighteenth of April, just about nine o'clock in the evening, and Aunt
                  Jerusha Periwinkle<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7953-00000068"/> and Granny Watkins,
                  they said they had n't seen no sich child in all their nussing. Held up his head
                  jest as lively, and sucked his thumb, he did,—jest the patientest, best baby ye
                  ever did see,—and growed beautiful. And he was gettin' to be a real beautiful
                  young man when he went off."</p>
               <p>"Went off?" said Harry.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he-went off to sea, jest for nothin' but 'cause his father aggravated him
                  so."</p>
               <p>"What <emph>was</emph> the matter? what <emph>did</emph> he do it for?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, Obed, he was allers round helpin' me,—he 'd turn the cheeses for me, and
                  draw the water, and was always on hand when I wanted a turn. And he took up agin
                  him, and said we was both lazy, and that I kept him round waitin' on me; and he
                  was allers a throwin' it up at me that I thought more of Obed than I did of him;
                  and one day flesh and blood could n't stan' it no longer. I got clear beat out,
                  and says I, 'Well, father, why should n't I? Obed 's allers a tryin' to help me
                  and make my work easy to me, and thinkin' what he can do for me; and he 's the
                  greatest comfort of my life, and it ain't no sin if I do think more on him than I
                  do of other folks.' Wal, that very day he went and picked a quarrel with him, and
                  told him he was going to give him a stand-up thrashing. And Obed, says he, 'No,
                  father, that you sha' n't. I 'm sixteen year old, and I've made up my mind you
                  sha' n't thrash me no more.' And with that he says to him, 'Get along out of my
                  house, you lazy dog,' says he; 'you 've been eatin' of my bread too long,' says
                  he. 'Well, father, I will,' says Obed. And he walks up to me and kisses me, and
                  says he, 'Never mind, mother, I 'm going to come home one of these days and bring
                  money enough to take care of you in your old age; and you shall have a house of
                  your own, and sha' n't have to work; and you shall sit in your satin gown and
                  drink your tea with white sugar every day, and you sha' n't be no man's slave. You
                  see if I don't.' With that he turned and was off, and I hain't never seen him
                  since."</p>
               <p>"How long 's he been gone?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, it 's four years come next April. I've hed one or two letters from him, and
                  he 's ris' to be mate. And he sent me his wages,—biggest part on 'em,—but he hed
                  to git 'em to me round by sendin on em to Ebal Parker; else <emph>he</emph> 'd a
                  took 'em, ye see. I could n't have nothin' decent to wear to meetin', nor my
                  little caddy o' green tea, if it had n't been for Obed. He won't read Obed's
                  letters, nor hear a word about him, and keeps a castin' it up at me that I think
                  so much of Obed that I don't love him none."</p>
               <p>"I should n't think you would," said the boy, innocently.</p>
               <p>"Wal, folks seems to think that you must love 'em through thick and thin, and I
                  try ter. I 've allers kep' his clothes mended, and his stockings darned up, and
                  two or three good pair ahead, and done for him jest the best I know how; but as to
                  lovin' folks when they 's so kind o' as he is, I don't reelly know how ter.
                  Expect, ef he was to be killed, I should feel putty bad, too,—kind o' used to
                  havin' on him round."</p>
               <p>This conversation was interrupted by the voice of Crab, in the following pleasing
                  style of remark: "What the devil be you a doin' with that boy,—keepin' him from
                  his work there? It 's time to be to the barn seein' to the critters. Here, you
                  young scamp, go out and cut some feed for the old mare. Suppose I keep you round
                  jest to eat up the victuals and be round under folks' feet?"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CRISIS.</head>
               <p>MATTERS between Miss Asphyxia and her little subject began to show evident signs
                  of approaching some crisis, for which that valiant virgin was preparing herself
                  with mind resolved. It was one of her educational tactics that children, at
                  greater or less intervals, would require what she was wont to speak of as
                     <emph>good</emph> whippings, as a sort of constitutional stimulus to start them
                  in the ways of well-doing. As a school-teacher, she was often fond of rehearsing
                  her experiences,—how she had her eye on Jim or Bob through weeks of growing
                  carelessness or obstinacy or rebellion, suffering the measure of iniquity
                  gradually to become full, until, in an awful hour, she pounced down on the culprit
                  in the very blossom of his sin, and gave him such a lesson as he would remember,
                  as she would assure him, the longest day he had to live.</p>
               <p>The burning of rebellious thoughts in the little breast, of internal hatred and
                  opposition, could not long go on without slight whiffs of external smoke, such as
                  mark the course of subterranean fire. As the child grew more accustomed to Miss
                  Asphyxia, while her hatred of her increased, somewhat of that native hardihood
                  which had characterized her happier days returned; and she began to use all the
                  subtlety and secretiveness which belonged to her feminine nature in contriving how
                     <emph>not</emph> to do the will of her tyrant, and yet not to seem designedly
                  to oppose. It really gave the child a new impulse in living to devise little plans
                  for annoying Miss Asphyxia without being herself detected. In all her daily toils
                  she made nice calculations how slow she could possibly be, how blundering and
                  awkward, without really bringing on herself a punishment; and when an acute and
                  capable child turns all its faculties in such a direction, the results may be very
                  considerable.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia found many things going wrong in her establishment in most
                  unaccountable ways. One morning her sensibilities were almost paralyzed, on
                  opening her milk-room door, to find there, with creamy whiskers, the venerable
                  Tom, her own model cat,—a beast who had grown up in the very sanctities of
                  household decorum, and whom she was sure she had herself shut out of the house,
                  with her usual punctuality, at nine o'clock the evening before. She could not
                  dream that he had been enticed through Tina's window, caressed on her bed, and
                  finally sped stealthily on his mission of revenge, while the child returned to her
                  pillow to gloat over her success.</p>
               <p>Miss Asphyxia also, in more than one instance, in her rapid gyrations, knocked
                  down and destroyed a valuable bit of pottery or earthen-ware, that somehow had
                  contrived to be stationed exactly in the wind of her elbow or her hand. It was the
                  more vexatious because she broke them herself. And the child assumed stupid
                  innocence: "How could she know Miss Sphyxy was coming that way?" or, "She did n't
                  see her." True, she caught many a hasty cuff and sharp rebuke; but, with true
                  Indian spirit, she did not mind singeing her own fingers if she only tortured her
                  enemy.</p>
               <p>It would be an endless task to describe the many vexations that can be made to
                  arise in the course of household experience when there is a shrewd little elf
                  watching with sharpened faculties for every opportunity to inflict an annoyance or
                  do a mischief. In childhood the passions move with a simplicity of action unknown
                  to any other period of life, and a child's hatred and a child's revenge have an
                  intensity of bitterness entirely unalloyed by moral considerations; and when a
                  child is without an object of affection, and feels itself unloved, its whole vigor
                  of being goes into the channels of hate.</p>
               <p>Religious instruction, as imparted by Miss Asphyxia, had small influence in
                  restraining the immediate force of passion. That "the law worketh wrath" is a
                  maxim as old as the times of the Apostles. The image of a dreadful Judge—a great
                  God, with ever-watchful eyes, that Miss Asphyxia told her about—roused that
                  combative element in the child's heart which says in<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000070"/> the heart of the fool, "There is no God." "After
                  all," thought the little sceptic, "how does she know? She never saw him." Perhaps,
                  after all, then, it might be only a fabrication of her tyrant to frighten her into
                  submission. There was a dear Father that mamma used to tell her about; and perhaps
                  he was the one, after all. As for the bear story she had a private conversation
                  with Sol, and was relieved by his confident assurance that there "had n't been no
                  bears seen round in them parts these ten year"; so that she was safe in that
                  regard, even if she should call Miss Asphyxia a bald-head, which she perfectly
                  longed to do, just to see what would come of it.</p>
               <p>In like manner, though the story of Ananias and Sapphira, struck down dead for
                  lying, had been told her in forcible and threatening tones, yet still the little
                  sinner thought within herself that such things must have ceased in our times, as
                  she had told more than one clever lie which neither Miss Asphyxia nor any one else
                  had found out.</p>
               <p>In fact, the child considered herself and Miss Asphyxia as in a state of warfare
                  which suspends all moral rules. In the stories of little girls who were taken
                  captives by goblins or giants or witches, she remembered many accounts of
                  sagacious deceptions which they had practised on their captors. Her very blood
                  tingled when she thought of the success of some of them,—how Hensel and Grettel
                  had heated an oven red-hot, and persuaded the old witch to get into it by some
                  cock-and-bull story of what she would find there; and how, the minute she got in,
                  they shut up the oven door, and burnt her all up! Miss Asphyxia thought the child
                  a vexatious, careless, troublesome little baggage, it is true; but if she could
                  have looked into her heart and seen her imaginings, she would probably have
                  thought her a little fiend.</p>
               <p>At last, one day, the smothered fire broke out. The child had had a half-hour of
                  holiday, and had made herself happy in it by furbishing up her little bedroom. She
                  had picked a peony, a yellow lily, and one or two blue irises, from the spot of
                  flowers in the garden, and put them in a tin dipper on the table in her room, and
                  ranged around them her broken bits of china, her red berries and fragments of
                  glass, in various zigzags. The spirit of adornment thus roused within her, she
                  remembered having seen her brother make pretty garlands of oak-leaves; and,
                  running out to an oak hard by, she stripped off an apronful of the leaves, and,
                  sitting down in the kitchen door, began her attempts to plait them into garlands.
                  She grew good-natured and happy as she wrought, and was beginning to find herself
                  in charity even with Miss Asphyxia, when down came that individual, broom in hand,
                  looking vengeful as those old Greek Furies who used to haunt houses, testifying
                  their wrath by violent sweeping.</p>
               <p>"What under the canopy you up to now, making such a litter on my kitchen floor?"
                  she said. "Can't I leave you a minute 'thout your gettin' into some mischief, I
                  want to know? Pick 'em up, every leaf of 'em, and carry 'em and throw 'em over the
                  fence; and don't you never let me find you bringing no such rubbish into my
                  kitchen agin!"</p>
               <p>In this unlucky moment she turned, and, looking into the little bedroom, whose
                  door stood open, saw the arrangements there. "What!" she said; "you been getting
                  down the tin cup to put your messes into? Take 'em all out!" she said, seizing the
                  flowers with a grasp that crumpled them, and throwing them into the child's apron.
                  "Take 'em away, every one of 'em! You 'd get everything out of place, from one end
                  of the house to the other, if I did n't watch you!" And forthwith she swept off
                  the child's treasures into her dust-pan.</p>
               <p>In a moment all the smothered wrath of weeks blazed up in the little soul. She
                  looked as if a fire had been kindled in her which reddened her cheeks and burned
                  in her eyes; and, rushing blindly at Miss Asphyxia, she cried, "You are a wicked
                  woman, a hateful old witch, and I hate you!"</p>
               <p>"Hity-tity! I thought I should have to give you a lesson before long, and so I
                  shall," said Miss Asphyxia, seizing her with stern determination. "You 've needed
                  a good sound whipping for a long time, miss, and you are going to get it now. I
                  'll whip you so that you'll remember it, I 'll promise you."</p>
               <p>And Miss Asphyxia kept her word, though the child, in the fury of despair, fought
                  her with tooth and nail, and proved herself quite a dangerous little animal; but
                  at length strength got<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7953-00000071"/> the better in
                  the fray, and, sobbing, though unsubdued, the little culprit was put to bed
                  without her supper.</p>
               <p>In those days the literal use of the rod in the education of children was
                  considered as a direct Bible teaching. The wisest, the most loving parent felt
                  bound to it in many cases, even though every stroke cut into his own heart. The
                  laws of New England allowed masters to correct their apprentices, and teachers
                  their pupils,—and even the public whipping-post was an institution of New England
                  towns. It is not to be supposed, therefore, that Miss Asphyxia regarded herself
                  otherwise than as thoroughly performing a most necessary duty. She was as ignorant
                  of the blind agony of mingled shame, wrath, sense of degradation, and burning for
                  revenge, which had been excited by her measures, as the icy east wind of Boston
                  flats is of the stinging and shivering it causes in its course. Is it the wind's
                  fault if your nose is frozen? There is not much danger in these days that such
                  measures will be the fashionable ones in the bringing up of children. But there is
                  a class of coldly-conscientious, severe persons, who still, as a matter of duty
                  and conscience, justify measures like these in education. <emph>They,</emph> at
                  all events, are the ones who ought to be forbidden to use them, and whose use of
                  them with children too often proves a soul-murder,—a dispensation of wrath and
                  death. Such a person is commonly both obtuse in sensibility and unimaginative in
                  temperament; but if his imagination could once be thoroughly enlightened to see
                  the fiend-like passions, the terrific convulsions, which are roused in a child's
                  soul by the irritation and degradation of such correction, he would shrink back
                  appalled. With sensitive children left in the hands of stolid and unsympathizing
                  force, such convulsions and mental agonies often are the beginning of a sort of
                  slow moral insanity which gradually destroys all that is good in the soul. Such
                  was the danger now hanging over the hapless little one whom a dying mother had
                  left to God. Is there no stirring among the angel wings on her behalf?</p>
               <p>As the child lay sobbing in a little convulsed heap in her bed, a hard, horny hand
                  put back the curtain of the window, and the child felt something thrown on the
                  bed. It was Sol, who, on coming in to his supper, had heard from Miss Asphyxia the
                  whole story, and who, as a matter of course, sympathized entirely with the child.
                  He had contrived to slip a doughnut into his pocket, when his hostess was looking
                  the other way. When the child rose up in the bed and showed her swelled and
                  tear-stained face, Sol whispered: 'There 's a doughnut I saved for ye. Darn her
                  pictur'! Don't dare say a word, ye know. She 'll hear me."</p>
               <p>"O Sol, can't you get Harry to come here and see me?" said the child, in an
                  earnest whisper.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I'll get him, if I have to go to thunder for 't," said Sol. "You jest lie
                  down now, there 's a good girl, and I'll work it,—ye see if I don't. To-morrow
                  I'll make her go off to the store, and I'll get him down here, you see if I don't.
                  It's a tarnal shame; that'ere critter ain't got no more bowels than a file."</p>
               <p>The child, however, was comforted, and actually went to sleep hugging the
                  doughnut. She felt as if she loved Sol, and said so to the doughnut many
                  times,—although he had great horny fists, and eyes like oxen. With these, he had a
                  heart in his bosom, and the child loved him.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE LION'S MOUTH SHUT.</head>
               <p>"NOW, where a plague is that boy?" said Old Crab, suddenly bearing down, as
                  evil-disposed people are always apt to do, in a most unforeseen moment.</p>
               <p>The fact was that there had been a silent conspiracy among Sol and Goody Smith and
                  the hired men of Old Crab, to bring about a meeting between the children. Miss
                  Asphyxia had been got to the country store and kept busy with various bargains
                  which Sol had suggested, and Old Crab had been induced to go to mill, and then the
                  boy had been sent by Goody Smith on an errand to Miss Asphyxia's house. Of course
                  he was not to find her at home, and was to stay and see his sister, and be sure
                  and be back again by four o'clock.</p>
               <p>"Where a plague is that lazy shote of a boy?" he repeated.</p>
               <p>"What, Harry?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Harry. Who do you suppose I mean? Harry,—where is he?"</p>
               <p>"O, I sent him up to Sphyxy's."</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> sent him?" said Old Crab, with that kind of tone which sounds so
                  much like a blow that one dodges one's head involuntarily. "<emph>You</emph> sent
                  him? What business <emph>you</emph> got interfering in the work?"</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, father, I jest wanted Sphyxy's cards and some o' that 'ere fillin'
                  she promised to give me. He won't be gone long."</p>
               <p>Old Crab stood at this disadvantage in his fits of ill-temper with his wife, that
                  there was no form of evil language or abuse that he had not tried so many times on
                  her that it was quite a matter of course for her to hear it. He had used up the
                  English language,—made it, in fact, absolutely of no effect,—while his fund of
                  ill-temper was, after all, but half expressed.</p>
               <p>"You 've begun with that 'ere boy just as you allers did with all your own,
                  gettin' 'em to be a waitin' round on you,—jest 'cause you 're a lazy
                  good-for-nothin'. We 're so rich, I wonder you don't hire a waiter for nothin' but
                  to stan' behind your chair. I'll teach him who his master is when he comes
                  back."</p>
               <p>"Now, father, 't ain't no fault o' his'n. <emph>I</emph> sent him."</p>
               <p>"And <emph>I</emph> sot him to work in the fields, and I 'd like to know if he's
                  goin' to leave what I set him to do, and go round after your errands. Here 't is
                  gettin' to be 'most five o'clock, and the critters want fodderin', and that 'ere
                  boy a dancing 'tendance on you. But he ain't a doin' that. He's jest off a
                  berryin' or suthin' with that trollopin' sister o' his'n,—jes' what you bring on
                  us, takin' in trampers. That 'ere gal, she pesters Sphyxy half to death."</p>
               <p>"Sphyxy 's pretty capable of takin' care of herself," said Goody Smith, still
                  keeping busy with her knitting, but looking uneasily up the road, where the form
                  of the boy might be expected to appear.</p>
               <p>The outbreak that she had long feared of her husband's evil nature was at hand.
                  She knew it by as many signs as one foretells the approach of hurricanes or
                  rain-storms. She knew it by the evil gleam in his small, gray eyes,—by the
                  impatient pacing backward and forward in the veranda, like a caged wild animal. It
                  made little matter to him what the occasion was: he had such a superfluity of evil
                  temper to vent, that one thing for his purpose was about as good as another.</p>
               <p>It grew later and later, and Old Crab went to the barn to attend to his cattle,
                  and the poor little old woman knitted uneasily.</p>
               <p>"What could 'a' kep' him?" she thought. "He can't 'a' run off." There was a sudden
                  gleam of mingled pleasure and pain in the old woman's heart as this idea darted
                  through her mind. "I should n't wonder if he would, but I kind o' hate to part
                  with him."</p>
               <p>At last she sees him coming along the road, and runs to meet him. "How could you
                  be so late? He 's drefful mad with ye."</p>
               <p>"I did n't know how late it was. Besides, all I could do, Tina would follow me,
                  and I had to turn back and carry her home. Tina has bad times there. That woman is
                  n't kind to her."</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7953-00000073"/>
               <p>"No, dear, she ain't noways kind," said the old woman; "it ain't Sphyxy's way to
                  be kind; but she 'll do middlin' well by her,—anyway, she won't let nobody hurt
                  her but herself. It's a hard world to live in; we have to take it as 't
                  comes."</p>
               <p>"Well, anyway," said the boy, "they <emph>must</emph> let us go to see each other.
                  It is n't right to keep us apart."</p>
               <p>"No, 't ain't, dear; but lordy massy, what can ye do?"</p>
               <p>There was a great steady tear in the boy's large, blue eyes as he stopped at the
                  porch, and he gave a sort of dreary shiver.</p>
               <p>"Halleoah you there! you lazy little cuss," said Old Crab, coming from the barn,
                  "where you been idling all the afternoon?"</p>
               <p>"I 've been seeing my sister," said the boy, steadily.</p>
               <p>"Thought so. Where's them cards and the fillin' you was sent for?"</p>
               <p>"There was n't anybody at home to get them."</p>
               <p>"And why did n't you come right back, you little varmint?"</p>
               <p>"Because I wanted to see Tina. She 's my sister; and my mother told me to take
                  care of her; and it's wicked to keep us apart so."</p>
               <p>"Don't you give me none of yer saace," said Old Crab, seizing the boy by one ear,
                  to which he gave a vicious wrench.</p>
               <p>"Let me alone," said the boy, flushing up with the sudden irritation of pain and
                  the bitter sense of injustice.</p>
               <p>"Let you alone? I guess I won't; talking saace to me that 'ere way. Guess I'll
                  show you who's master. It's time you was walked off down to the barn, sir, and
                  find out who 's your master," he said, as he seized the boy by the collar and drew
                  him off.</p>
               <p>"O Lord!" said the woman, running out and stretching her hands instinctively after
                  them. "Father, do let the boy alone."</p>
               <p>She could not help this cry any more than a bird can help a shriek when she sees
                  the hawk pouncing down on her nest, though she knew perfectly well that she might
                  as well have shouted a petition in the angry face of the northeast wind.</p>
               <p>"Take off your jacket," said Old Crab, as soon as he had helped himself to a long
                  cart-whip which stood there.</p>
               <p>The boy belonged to that class of amiable, good-natured children who are not
                  easily irritated or often provoked, but who, when moved by a great injustice or
                  cruelty, are thrown into convulsions of passion. The smallest and most
                  insignificant animal, in moments of utter despair, when every fibre of its being
                  is made vital with the energy of desperate resistance, often has a force which
                  will make the strongest and boldest stand at bay. The boy retreated a pace or two,
                  braced his back against the manger, while his whole form trembled and appeared to
                  dilate, and it seemed as if blue streams of light glared from his eyes like sparks
                  struck from burning steel.</p>
               <p>"Strike me if you dare, you wicked, dreadful man," he shouted. "Don't you know
                  that God sees you? God is my Father, and my mother is gone to God; and if you hurt
                  me He 'll punish you. You know I have n't done anything wrong, and God knows it.
                  Now strike me if you dare."</p>
               <p>The sight of any human being in a singular and abnormal state has something
                  appalling about it; and at this moment the child really appeared to Old Crab like
                  something supernatural. He stood a moment looking at him, and then his eyes
                  suddenly seemed fixed on something above and beyond him, for he gazed with a
                  strange, frightened expression; and at last, pushing with his hands, called out,
                  "Go along; get away, get away! I hain't touched him," and, turning, fled out of
                  the barn.</p>
               <p>He did not go to the house again, but to the village tavern, and, entering the
                  bar-room with a sort of distraught air, called for a dram, and passed the evening
                  in a cowering state of quiet in the corner, which was remarked on by many as
                  singular.</p>
               <p>The boy came back into the house.</p>
               <p>"Massy to us, child," said the old woman, "I thought he 'd half killed ye."</p>
               <p>"No, he has n't touched me. God would n't let him," said the boy.</p>
               <p>"Well, I declare for 't! he must have sent the angels that shut the lion's mouth
                  when Daniel was in the den," said the woman. "I would n't 'a' had him struck ye,
                  not for ten dollars."</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7953-00000074"/>
               <p>The moon was now rising, large, white, and silvery, yet with a sort of tremulous,
                  rosy flush, as it came up in the girdle of a burning autumn horizon. The boy stood
                  a moment looking at it. His eyes were still dilated with that unnatural light, and
                  his little breast heaving with waves of passion not yet tranquillized.</p>
               <p>"Which way did he go?" said the woman.</p>
               <p>"Up the road," said the boy.</p>
               <p>"To the tavern," said the woman. "He's been there before this afternoon. At any
                  rate, then, he 'll let us alone awhile. There comes the men home to supper. Come
                  in; I 've got a turnover I made a purpose for ye."</p>
               <p>"No, I must bid you good by, now," said the boy. "I can't stay here any
                  longer."</p>
               <p>"Why, where be ye going?"</p>
               <p>"Going to look for a better place, where I can take care of Tina," said the
                  boy.</p>
               <p>"Ye ain't a going to leave me?" said the old woman. "Yet I can't want ye to stay.
                     <emph>I</emph> can't have nothin' nor nobody."</p>
               <p>"I'll come back one of these days," said the boy cheerfully,—"come and see
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Stay and get your supper, anyhow," pleaded the old woman. "I hate ter have ye go,
                  drefful bad."</p>
               <p>"I don't want any supper," said the child; "but if you 'll give me a little basket
                  of things,—I want 'em for Tina."</p>
               <p>The old soul ran to her buttery, and crammed a small splint basket with turnovers,
                  doughnuts, and ample slices of rye bread and butter, and the boy took it and
                  trudged off, just as the hired men were coming home.</p>
               <p>"Hulloah, bub!" shouted they, "where ye goin'?"</p>
               <p>"Going to seek my fortune," said the boy cheerfully.</p>
               <p>"Jest the way they all go," said the old woman.</p>
               <p>"Where do you suppose the young un 'll fetch up?" said one of the men to the
                  other.</p>
               <p>"No business of mine,—can't fetch up wus than he has ben a doin'."</p>
               <p>"Old Crab a cuttin' up one of his shines, I s'pose?" said the other,
                  interrogatively.</p>
               <p>"Should n't wonder; 'bout time,—ben to the tavern this arternoon, I reckon."</p>
               <p>The boy walked along the rough stony road towards Miss Asphyxia's farm. It was a
                  warm, mellow evening in October. The air had only a pleasant coolness. Everything
                  was tender and bright. A clump of hickory-trees on a rocky eminence before him
                  stood like pillars of glowing gold in the twilight; one by one little stars looked
                  out, winking and twinkling at the lonely child, as it seemed to him, with a
                  friendly, encouraging ray, like his mother's eyes.</p>
               <p>That afternoon he had spent trying to comfort his little sister, and put into her
                  soul some of the childlike yet sedate patience with which he embraced his own lot,
                  and the good hopes which he felt of being able some time to provide for her when
                  he grew bigger. But he found nothing but feverish impatience, which all his
                  eloquence could scarcely keep within bounds. He had, however, arranged with her
                  that he should come evenings after she had gone to bed, and talk to her at the
                  window of her bedroom, that she should not be so lonesome nights. The perfectly
                  demoniac violence which Old Crab had shown this night had determined him not to
                  stay with him any longer. He would take his sister, and they would wander off, a
                  long, long way, till they came to better people, and then he would try again to
                  get work, and ask some good woman to be kind to Tina. Such, in substance, was the
                  plan that occurred to the child; and accordingly that night, after little Tina had
                  laid her head on her lonely pillow, she heard a whispered call at her window. The
                  large, bright eyes opened very wide as she sat up in bed and looked towards the
                  window, where Harry's face appeared.</p>
               <p>"It's me, Tina,—I've come back,—be very still. I'm going to stay in the barn till
                  everybody's asleep, and then I 'll come and wake you, and you get out of the
                  window and come with me."</p>
               <p>"To be sure I will, Harry. Let me come now, and sleep with you in the barn."</p>
               <p>"No, Tina, that would n't do; lie still. They'd see us. Wait till everybody's
                  asleep. You just lie down and go to sleep. I 'll get in at your window and waken
                  you when it's time."</p>
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7953-00000075"/>
               <p>At this moment the door of the child's room was opened; the boy's face was gone in
                  an instant from the window. The child's heart was beating like a trip-hammer;
                  there was a tingling in her ears; but she kept her little eyes tightly shut.</p>
               <p>"O, here's that brown towel I gin her to hem," said Miss Asphyxia, peacefully.
                  "She 's done her stent this afternoon. That 'ere whipping did some good."</p>
               <p>"You 'll never whip me again," thought the defiant little heart under the
                  bedclothes.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Old Crab came home that night thoroughly drunk,—a thing that did not very often
                  occur in his experience. He commonly took only just enough to keep himself in a
                  hyena's state of temper, but not enough to dull the edge of his cautious,
                  grasping, money-saving faculties. But to-night he had had an experience that had
                  frightened him, and driven him to deeper excess as a refuge from thought.</p>
               <p>When the boy, upon whom he was meaning to wreak his diabolic passions, so suddenly
                  turned upon him in the electric fury of enkindled passion, there was a sort of jar
                  or vibration of the nervous element in the man's nature, that brought about a
                  result not uncommon to men of his habits. As he was looking in a sort of stunned,
                  stupid wonder at the boy, where he stood braced against the manger, he afterwards
                  declared that he saw suddenly in the dark space above it, hovering in the air, the
                  exact figure and form of the dead woman whom they had buried in the graveyard only
                  a few weeks before. "Her eyes was looking right at me, like live coals," he said;
                  "and she had up her hand as if she 'd 'a' struck me; and I grew all over cold as a
                  stone."</p>
               <p>"What do you suppose 't was?" said his auditor.</p>
               <p>"How should I know," said Old Crab. "But there I was; and that very night the
                  young 'un ran off. I would n't have tried to get him back, not for my right hand,
                  I tell you. Tell you what," he added, rolling a quid of tobacco reflectively in
                  his mouth, "<emph>I</emph> don't like dead folks. Ef dead folks 'll let me alone,
                  I 'll let them alone. That 'ere 's fair, ain't it?"</p>

               <head type="sub">THE EMPTY BIRD'S-NEST.</head>
               <p>THE next morning showed as brilliant a getting up of gold and purple as ever
                  belonged to the toilet of a morning. There was to be seen from Miss Asphyxia's
                  bedroom window a brave sight, if there had been any eyes to enjoy it,—a range of
                  rocky cliffs with little pin-feathers of black pine upon them, and behind them the
                  sky all aflame with bars of massy light,—orange and crimson and burning gold,—and
                  long, bright rays, darting hither and thither, touched now the window of a
                  farm-house, which seemed to kindle and flash back a morning salutation; now they
                  hit a tall scarlet maple, and now they pierced between clumps of pine, making
                  their black edges flame with gold; and over all, in the brightening sky, stood the
                  morning star, like a great, tremulous tear of light, just ready to fall on a
                  darkened world.</p>
               <p>Not a bit of all this saw Miss Asphyxia, though she had looked straight out at it.
                  Her eyes and the eyes of the cow, who, with her horned front, was serenely gazing
                  out of the barn window on the same prospect, were equally unreceptive.</p>
               <p>She looked at all this solemn pomp of gold and purple, and the mysterious star,
                  and only said: "Good day for killin' the hog, and I must be up gettin' on the
                  brass kettle. I should like to know why Sol ain't been a stirrin' an hour ago. I
                  'd really like to know how long folks <emph>would</emph> sleep ef I 'd let
                  'em."</p>
               <p>Here an indistinct vision came into Miss Asphyxia's mind of what the world would
                  be without her to keep it in order. She called aloud to her prime minister, who
                  slept in the loft above, "Sol! Sol! You awake?"</p>
               <p>"Guess I be," said Sol; and a thundering sound of cowhide boots on the stairs
                  announced that Sol's matutinal toilet was complete.</p>
               <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7953-00000076"/>
               <p>"We 're late this morning," said Miss Asphyxia, in a tone of virtuous
                  indignation.</p>
               <p>"Never knowed the time when we wa' n't late," said Sol, composedly.</p>
               <p>"You thump on that 'ere child's door, and tell her to be lively," said Miss
                  Asphyxia.</p>
               <p>"Yaas 'm, I will," said Sol, while secretly he was indulging in a long and low
                  chuckle, for Sol had been party to the fact that the nest of that young bird had
                  been for many hours forsaken. He had instructed the boy what road to take, and
                  bade him "walk spry and he would be out of the parish of Needmore afore daybreak.
                  Walk on, then, and follow the road along the river," said Sol, "and it 'll bring
                  you to Oldtown, where our folks be. You can't miss your victuals and drink any day
                  in Oldtown, call at what house you may; and ef you's to get into Deacon Badger's,
                  why, your fortin 's made. The Deacon he 's a soft-spoken man to everybody,—white
                  folks, niggers, and Indians,—and Ma'am Badger keeps regular poor-man's tavern, and
                  won't turn even a dog away that behaves himself. Ye could n't light on was than ye
                  have lit on,—for Old Crab's possessed of a devil, everybody knows; and as for Miss
                  Asphyxia, she 's one of the kind of sperits that goes walkin' through dry places
                  seekin' rest and findin' none. Lordy massy, an old gal like her ain't nobody to
                  bring up a child. It takes a woman that's got juice in her to do that. Why, that
                  'ere crittur 's drier 'n a two-year-old mullen-stalk. There ain't no sap ris in
                  her these 'ere thirty years. She means well; but, lordy, you might jest as well
                  give young turkey chicks to the old gobbler, and let him stram off in the mowin'
                  grass with 'em, as give a delicate little gal like your sister to her to raise; so
                  you jest go long and keep up your courage, like a brave boy as ye be, and you 'll
                  come to somethin' by daylight";—and Sol added to these remarks a minced pie, with
                  a rye crust of a peculiarly solid texture, adapted to resist any of the incidents
                  of time and travel, which pie had been set out as part of his own last night's
                  supper.</p>
               <p>When, therefore, he was exhorted to rap on the little girl's door, he gave sundry
                  noisy, gleeful thumps,—pounding with both fists, and alternating with a rhythmical
                  kick of the cowhide boots, calling out in stentorian tones: "Come, little un,—time
                  you 's up. Miss Sphyxy 's comin' down on ye. Better be lively! Bless me, how the
                  gal sleeps!"</p>
               <p>"Don't take the door off the hinges," said Miss Asphyxia, sweeping down stairs.
                  "Let me come; I 'll wake her, I guess!" and with a dipper of cold water in her
                  hand, Miss Asphyxia burst into the little room. "What!—what!—where!" she said,
                  looking under the bed, and over and around, with a dazed expression. "What 's this
                  mean? Do tell if the child 's re'lly for once got up of herself afore I called
                  her. Sol, see if she 's out pickin' up chips!"</p>
               <p>Sol opened the door and gazed out with well-affected stolidity at the wood-pile,
                  which, garnished with a goodly show of large chips, was now being touched up and
                  brightened by the first rays of the morning sun.</p>
               <p>"Ain't here," he said.</p>
               <p>"Ain't here? Why, where can she be then? There ain't nobody swallowed her, I
                  s'pose; and if anybody 's run off with her in the night, I guess they 'd bring her
                  back by daylight."</p>
               <p>"She must 'a' run off," said Sol.</p>
               <p>"Run! Where could she 'a' run to?"</p>
               <p>"Mebbe she 's gone to her brother's."</p>
               <p>"I bet you," said Miss Asphyxia, "it's that 'ere boy that 's the bottom of it all.
                  You may always know that there 's a boy at the bottom, when there 's any deviltry
                  up. He was here yesterday,—now wa' n't he?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, I reckon he was," said Sol. "But, massy, Miss Sphyxy, ef the pigs is to be
                  killed to-day, we can't stan' a talkin' about what you nor me can't help. Ef the
                  child 's gone, why she 's somewhere in the Lord's world, and it 's likely she 'll
                  keep,—she won't melt away like the manna in the wilderness; and when the pigs is
                  killed, and the pork salted down and got out o' the way, it 'll be time enough to
                  think o' lookin' on her up. She wa' n't no gret actual use,—and with kettles o'
                  hot water round, it 's jest as well not to have a child under yer feet. Ef she got
                  scalded, why, there 's your time a taking care on her, and mebbe a doctor to pay;
                  so it 's jest as well that things be as they be.<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000077"/>
                  <emph>I</emph> call it kind o' providential," said Sol, giving a hoist to his
                  breeches by means of a tug at his suspenders, which gesture was his usual
                  indication that he was girding up the loins of his mind for an immediate piece of
                  work; and, turning forthwith, he brought in a mighty armful of wood, with massive
                  backlog and fore-stick, well grizzled and bearded with the moss that showed that
                  they were but yesterday living children of the forest.</p>
               <p>The fire soon leaped and crackled and roared, being well fed with choice split
                  hickory sticks of last year, of which Sol kept ample store; and very soon the big
                  brass kettle was swung over, upon the old iron crane, and the sacrificial water
                  was beginning to simmer briskly, while Miss Asphyxia prepared breakfast, not only
                  for herself and Sol, but for Primus King, a vigorous old negro, famed as a sort of
                  high-priest in all manner of butchering operations for miles around. Primus lived
                  in the debatable land between Oldtown and Needmore, and so was at the call of all
                  who needed an extra hand in both parishes.</p>
               <p>The appearance of Primus at the gate in his butcher's frock, knife in hand, in
                  fact put an end, in Miss Asphyxia's mind, to all thoughts apart from the present
                  eventful crisis; and she hastened to place upon the table the steaming sausages
                  which, with her usual despatch, had been put down for their morning meal. A mighty
                  pitcher of cider flanked this savory dish, to which Primus rolled delighted eyes
                  at the moment of sitting down. The time had not yet dawned, in those simple, old
                  New England days, when the black skin of the African was held to disqualify him
                  from a seat at the social board with the men whom he joined in daily labor. The
                  strength of the arm, and the skill of the hand, and the willingness of the mind of
                  the workman, in those days, were his passport to equal social rights; and old
                  Primus took rank, in the butchering season, as in fact a sort of leader and
                  commander. His word was law upon all steps and stages of those operations which
                  should transform the plethoric, obese inhabitants of the sty into barrels of
                  pink-hued salt-pork or savory hams and tenderloins and spareribs, or immense
                  messes of sausage-meat.</p>
               <p>Concerning all these matters, Primus was an oracle. His fervid Ethiopian nature
                  glowed with a broad and visible delight, his black face waxed luminous with the
                  oil of gladness, while he dwelt on the savory subject, whereon, sitting at
                  breakfast, he dilated with an unctuous satisfaction that soothed the raven down of
                  darkness in Miss Asphyxia's perturbed mind, till something bearing a distant
                  analogy to a smile played over her rugged features.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE DAY IN FAIRY-LAND.</head>
               <p>OUR little travellers, meanwhile, had had a prosperous journey along the rocky
                  road between Needmore and Oldtown, in which Sol had planted their feet. There was
                  a great, round-orbed, sober-eyed October moon in the sky, that made everything as
                  light as day; and the children were alive in every nerve with the keen interest of
                  their escape.</p>
               <p>"We are going just as Hensel and Grettel did," said the little girl. "You are
                  Hensel, and I am Grettel, and Miss Asphyxia is the old witch. I wish only we could
                  have burnt her up in her old oven before we came away!"</p>
               <p>"Now, Tina, you must n't wish such things <emph>really,</emph>" said the boy,
                  somewhat shocked at such very extreme measures. "You see, what happens in stories
                  would n't do <emph>really</emph> to happen."</p>
               <p>"O, but Harry, you don't know how I <emph>hate</emph>—how I
                  h—<emph>ate</emph>—Miss Sphyxy! I hate her—most as much as I love you!"</p>
               <p>"But, Tina, mother always told us it was wicked to hate anybody. We must love our
                  enemies."</p>
               <p>"You don't love Old Crab Smith, do you?"</p>
               <p>"No, I don't; but I try not to hate him," said the boy. "I won't think anything
                  about him."</p>
               <p>"I can't help thinking," said Tina; "and when I think, I am <emph>so</emph> angry!
                  I feel such a burning in here!" she said, striking her little breast; "it 's just
                  like fire!"</p>
               <p>"Then don't think about her at all," said the boy; "it is n't pleasant to feel
                  that way. Think about the whippoorwills singing in the woods over there,—how plain
                  they say it, don't they?—and the frogs, all singing, with their little, round,
                  yellow eyes looking up out of the water; and the moon looking down on us so
                  pleasantly! she seems just like mother!"</p>
               <p>"O Harry, I 'm so glad," said the girl, suddenly throwing herself self on his neck
                  and hugging him,—"I 'm so glad we 're together again! Was n't it wicked to keep us
                  apart,—we poor children?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Tina, I <emph>am</emph> glad," said the boy, with a steady, quiet, inward
                  sort of light in his eyes; "but, baby, we can't stop to say so much, because we
                  must walk fast and get way, way, way off before daylight; and you know Miss Sphyxy
                  always gets up early,—don't she?"</p>
               <p>"O dear, yes! She always poked me out of bed before it was light,—hateful old
                  thing! Let 's run as fast as we can, and get away!"</p>
               <p>And with that she sprang forward, with a brisk and onward race, over the pebbly
                  road, down a long hill, laughing as she went, and catching now at a branch of
                  sweetbrier that overhung the road, and now at the tags of sweet-fern, both laden
                  and hoary with heavy autumnal dews, till finally, her little foot tripping over a
                  stone, she fell and grazed her arm sadly. Her brother lifted her up, and wiped the
                  tears from her great, soft eyes with her blue check apron, and talked to her in
                  that grandfatherly way that older children take such delight in when they feel the
                  care of younger ones.</p>
               <p>"Now, Tina, darling, you should n't run so wild. We 'd better go pretty fast
                  steadily, than run and fall down. But I 'll kiss the place, as mother used
                  to."</p>
               <p>"I don't mind it, Hensel,—I don't mind it," she said, controlling the quivering of
                  her little resolute mouth. "That scratch came for <emph>liberty;</emph> but this,"
                  she said, showing a long welt on her other arm,—"this was <emph>slavery.</emph>
                  She struck me there with her great ugly stick. O, I never <emph>can</emph> forgive
                  her!"</p>
               <p>"Don't let 's talk any more, baby; let 's hurry on. She <emph>never</emph> shall
                  get you again; I 'll fight for you till I die, first!"</p>
               <p>"You 'd kill 'em all, would n't you? You would have knocked her down, would n't
                  you?" said Tina, kindling up with that inconsiderate exultation in the powers of
                  an elder brother which belongs to childhood. "I knew you would get me away from
                  here, Harry,—I knew you would."</p>
               <p>"But now," said Harry, "you just keep hold of my hand, and<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000079"/> let 's run together, and I 'll hold you up. We must
                  run fast, after all, because maybe they will harness up the wagon when daylight
                  comes, and come out to look for us."</p>
               <p>"Well, if it 's only Sol comes," said the little girl, "I sha' n't care; for he
                  would only carry us on farther."</p>
               <p>"Ay, but you may be sure Miss Asphyxia would come herself."</p>
               <p>The suggestion seemed too probable, and the two little pairs of heels seemed
                  winged by it as they flew along, their long shadows dancing before them on the
                  moonlit road, like spiritual conductors. They made such good headway that the hour
                  which we have already recorded, when Miss Asphyxia's slumbers were broken, found
                  the pair of tiny pilgrims five miles away on the road to Oldtown.</p>
               <p>"Now, Tina," said the boy, as he stopped to watch the long bars of crimson and
                  gold that seemed to be drawing back and opening in the eastern sky, where the sun
                  was flaring upward an expectant blaze of glory, "only look there! Is n't it so
                  wonderful? It 's worth being out here only to see it. There! there! there! the sun
                  is coming! Look! Only see that bright-red maple,—it seems all on fire!—now that
                  yellow chestnut, and that old pine-tree! O, see, see those red leaves! They are
                  like the story papa used to tell of the trees that bore rubies and emeralds. Are
                  n't they beautiful?"</p>
               <p>"Set me on the fence, so as I can see," said Tina. "O Harry, it's beautiful! And
                  to think that we can see it together!"</p>
               <p>Just at this moment they caught the distant sound of wheels.</p>
               <p>"Hurry, Tina! Let me lift you over the fence," said the boy; "they are
                  coming!"</p>
               <p>How the little hearts beat, as both children jumped down into a thicket of
                  sweet-fern, heavy and wet with morning dew! The lot was one of those confused
                  jungles which one often sees hedging the course of rivers in New England. Groups
                  of pine and hemlock grew here and there, intermixed with low patches of swampy
                  land, which were waving with late wild-flowers and nodding swamp-grasses. The
                  children tore their way through golden-rods, asters, and cat-tails to a little
                  elevated spot where a great, flat rock was surrounded by a hedge of white-pine.
                  This was precisely the shelter they wanted; for the pines grew so thickly around
                  it as completely to screen it from sight from the road, while it was open to the
                  warm beams of the morning sun.</p>
               <p>"Cuddle down here, Tina," said Harry, in a whispering voice, as if he feared the
                  driver in the rattling farm-wagon might hear them.</p>
               <p>"O, what a nice little house the trees make here!" said Tina. "We are as snug here
                  and as warm as can be; and only see what a nice white-and-green carpet there is
                  all over the rock!"</p>
               <p>The rock, to be sure, was all frothed over with a delicate white foam of moss,
                  which, later in the day, would have crackled and broken in brittle powder under
                  their footsteps, but which now, saturated by the heavy night-dews, only bent under
                  them, a soft, elastic carpet.</p>
               <p>Their fears were soon allayed when, peeping like scared partridges from their
                  cover, they saw a farm-wagon go rattling by from the opposite direction to that in
                  which Miss Asphyxia lived.</p>
               <p>"O, it 's nobody for us; it comes the other way," said the boy.</p>
               <p>It was, in fact, Primus King, going on his early way to preside over the
                  solemnities of pig-killing.</p>
               <p>"Then, Hensel, we are free," said the little girl; "nobody will catch us now. They
                  could no more find us in this lot than they could find a little, little tiny pin
                  in the hay-mow."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, Tina; we are safe now," said the boy.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you call me Grettel? We will play be Hensel and Grettel; and who knows
                  what luck will come to us?"</p>
               <p>"Well, Grettel then," said the boy, obediently. "You sit now, and spread out your
                  frock in the sun to dry, while I get out some breakfast for you. Old Aunty Smith
                  has filled my basket with all sorts of good things."</p>
               <p>"And nice old Sol,—he gave us his pie," said Tina. "I love Sol, though he is a
                  funny-looking man. You ought to see Sol's hand, it 's so big! And his feet,—why,
                  one of his shoes would make a good boat for me! But he 's a queer old dear,
                  though, and I love him."</p>
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7953-00000080"/>
               <p>"What shall we eat first?" said the boy,—"the bread and butter, or the cookies, or
                  the doughnuts, or the pie?"</p>
               <p>"Let 's try a little of all of them," said young madam.</p>
               <p>"You know, Tina," said the boy, in a slow, considerate way, "that we must take
                  care of this, because we don't know when we 'll get any more. There 's got to be a
                  dinner and a supper got out of this at any rate."</p>
               <p>"O, well, Hensel, you do just as you please with it, then; only let 's begin with
                  Sol's pie and some of that nice cheese, for I am so hungry! And then, when we have
                  had our breakfast, I mean to lie down in the sun, and have a nap on this pretty
                  white moss. O Harry, how pretty this moss is! There are bright little red things
                  in it, as bright as mother's scarlet cloak. But, O Harry, look, quick! don't say a
                  word! There 's a squirrel! How bright his little eyes are! Let 's give him some of
                  our breakfast."</p>
               <p>Harry broke off a crumb of cake and threw it to the little striped-backed
                  stranger.</p>
               <p>"Why, he 's gone like a wink," said the girl. "Come back, little fellow; we sha'
                  n't hurt you."</p>
               <p>"O, hush, Tina, he 's coming! I see his bright eyes. He 's watching that bit of
                  cake."</p>
               <p>"There, he 's got it and is off!" said Tina, with a shriek of delight. "See him
                  race up that tree with it!"</p>
               <p>"He 's going to take it home to his wife."</p>
               <p>"His wife!" said Tina, laughing so hard at Harry's wit that she was obliged to lay
                  down her pie. "Has he got a wife?"</p>
               <p>"Why, of course he has," said Harry, with superior wisdom.</p>
               <p>"I 'm <emph>your</emph> wife, ain't I?" said Tina, contentedly.</p>
               <p>"No. You 're my little sister, and I take care of you," said the boy. "But people
                  can't have their sisters for wives; the Bible says so."</p>
               <p>"Well, I can be just <emph>like</emph> your wife; and I 'll mend your clothes and
                  knit your stockings when I get bigger."</p>
               <p>To which practical view of matrimonial duties Harry gave a grave assent.</p>
               <p>Not a striped-backed squirrel, or a bobolink, or a cat-bird, in the whole
                  pasture-lot, had better spirits than our two little travellers. They were free;
                  they were together; the sun was shining and birds were singing; and as for the
                  future, it was with them as with the birds. The boy, to be sure, had a share of
                  forethought and care, and deemed himself a grown man acting with most serious
                  responsibility for his light-headed little sister; but even in him this was only a
                  half-awakening from the dream-land of childhood.</p>
               <p>When they had finished their breakfast, he bethought him of his morning prayers,
                  and made Tina kneel down beside him while he repeated psalm and hymn and prayer,
                  in which she joined with a very proper degree of attention. When he had finished,
                  she said, "Do you know, Hensel, I have n't said my prayers a single once since I
                  've been at Miss Asphyxia's?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Tina!"</p>
               <p>"Well, you see, there was n't anybody to say them to, now mother is gone; and you
                  were not there."</p>
               <p>"But you say them to God, Tina."</p>
               <p>"O, he 's so far off, and I 'm so little, I can't say them to him. I must say them
                  to somebody I can see. Harry, where is mother gone?"</p>
               <p>"She is gone to heaven, Tina."</p>
               <p>"Where is heaven?"</p>
               <p>"It 's up in the sky, Tina," said the boy, looking up into the deep, cloudless
                  blue of an October sky, which, to say the truth, is about as celestial a thing as
                  a mortal child can look into; and as he looked, his great blue eyes grew large and
                  serious with thoughts of his mother's last wonderful words.</p>
               <p>"If it 's up in the sky, why did they dig down into the ground, and put her in
                  that hole?" said the little sceptic.</p>
               <p>"It is her soul that went up. Her body is planted like a beautiful flower. She
                  will come up by and by; and we shall see her again, if we are good children."</p>
               <p>Tina lay back on the white moss, with only a fringy bough of white-pine between
                  her and the deep, eternal blue, where the thinnest films of white clouds were
                  slowly sailing to and fro. Her spiritual musings grew, to say the truth, rather
                  confused. She was now very tired with her night tramp; and the long<pb n="152-153"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000081"/> fringes fell over her great, dark eyes, as a flower
                  shuts itself, and she was soon asleep.</p>
               <p>The boy sat watching her awhile, feeling soothed by the calm, soft sunshine, and
                  listening to the thousand sweet lullaby-notes which Nature is humming to herself,
                  while about her great world-housework, in a calm October morning. The locusts and
                  katydids grated a drowsy, continuous note to each other from every tree and bush;
                  and from a neighboring thicket a lively-minded cat-bird was giving original
                  variations and imitations of all sorts of bird voices and warblings; while from
                  behind the tangled thicket which fringed its banks came the prattle of a hidden
                  river, whose bright brown waters were gossiping, in a pleasant, constant chatter,
                  with the many-colored stones on the bottom; and when the light breezes wandered
                  hither and thither, as your idle breezes always will be doing, they made little
                  tides and swishes of sound among the pine-trees, like the rising and falling of
                  sunny waters on the sea-shore.</p>
               <p>Altogether, it was not long before Harry's upright watch over his sister subsided
                  into a droop upon one elbow, and finally the little curly head went suddenly down
                  on to his sister's shoulder; and then they were fast asleep,—as nice a little pair
                  of babes in the wood as ever the robins could cover up. They did not awake till it
                  was almost noon. The sun was shining warm and cloudless, and every bit of dew had
                  long been dried; and Tina, in refreshed spirits, proposed that they should explore
                  the wonders of the pasture-lot,—especially that they should find out where the
                  river was whose waters they heard gurgling behind the leafy wall of wild
                  vines.</p>
               <p>"We can leave our basket here in our little house, Hensel. See, I set it in here,
                  way, way in among the pine-trees; and that 's my little green closet."</p>
               <p>So the children began picking their way through the thicket, guided by the sound
                  of the water.</p>
               <p>"O Tina!" said the boy; "look there, over your head!"</p>
               <p>The object pointed out was a bough of a wild grape-vine, heavily laden with ripe
                  purple grapes.</p>
               <p>"O, wild grapes!" said Tina. "Harry, do get them!"</p>
               <p>Harry soon pulled the bough down within reach, and the children began helping
                  themselves.</p>
               <p>"I'm going to take an apronful up to the tree, and put into our closet," said
                  Tina; "and we shall have a nice store there."</p>
               <p>"But, Tina, we can't live there on the rock," said the boy; "we must walk on and
                  get to Oldtown some time."</p>
               <p>"O, well, we have the whole long, long day for it," said the girl, "and we may as
                  well have a good time now; so, when I 've put up these grapes, we 'll see where
                  the river is."</p>
               <p>A little scrambling and tearing through vines soon brought the children down to
                  the banks of a broad, rather shallow river, whose waters were of that lustrous
                  yellow-brown which makes every stone gleam up from the bottom in mellow colors,
                  like the tints through the varnish of an old picture. The banks were a rampart of
                  shrubbery and trees hung with drapery of wild vines, now in the brilliancy of
                  autumnal coloring. It is not wonderful that exclamations of delight and wonder
                  burst from both children. An old hemlock that hung slantwise over the water
                  opposite was garlanded and interwoven, through all its dusky foliage, with wreaths
                  and pendants of the Virginia creeper, now burning in the brilliant carmine and
                  scarlet hues of autumn. Great, soft, powdery clumps of golden-rod projected their
                  heads from the closely interwoven thicket, and leaned lovingly over the stream,
                  while the royal purple of tall asters was displayed in bending plumage at their
                  side. Here and there, a swamp-maple seemed all one crimson flame; while greener
                  shrubbery and trees, yet untouched by frosts, rose up around it, as if purposely
                  to give background and relief to so much color. The rippling surface of the
                  waters, as they dashed here and there over the stones, gave back colored flashes
                  from the red, yellow, crimson, purple, and green of the banks; while ever and anon
                  little bright leaves came sailing down the stream, all moist and brilliant, like
                  so many floating gems. The children clapped their hands, and began, with sticks,
                  fishing them towards the shore. "These are our little boats," they said. So they
                  were,—fairy boats, coming from the land of nowhere, and going on to oblivion,
                  shining and fanciful, like the little ones that played with them.</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7953-00000082"/>
               <p>"I declare," said Tina, "I mean to take off my shoes and stockings, and wade out
                  to that little island where those pretty white stones are. You go with me."</p>
               <p>"Well, Tina, wait till I can hold you."</p>
               <p>And soon both the little pairs of white feet were slipping and spattering among
                  the pebbles at the bottom. On the way, Tina made many efforts to entrap the bright
                  rings of sunlight on the bottom, regardless of the logic with which Harry
                  undertook to prove to her that it was nothing but the light, and that she could
                  not catch it; and when they came to the little white gravelly bank, they sat down
                  and looked around them with great content.</p>
               <p>"We 're on a desolate island, are n't we, Hensel?" said Tina. "I like desolate
                  islands," she added, looking around her, with the air of one who had had a wide
                  experience of the article. "The banks here are so high, and the bushes so thick,
                  that Miss Asphyxia could not find us if she were to try. We 'll make our home
                  here."</p>
               <p>"Well, I think, Tina, darling, that it won't do for us to stay here very long,"
                  said Harry. "We must try to get to some place where I can find something to do,
                  and some good, kind woman to take care of you."</p>
               <p>"O Harry, what's the use of thinking of that,—it's so bright and pleasant, and
                  it's so long since I 've had you to play with! Do let's have one good, pleasant
                  day alone among the flowers! See how beautiful everything is!" she added, "and
                  it's so warm and quiet and still, and all the birds and squirrels and butterflies
                  are having such a good time. I don't want anything better than to play about out
                  in the woods with you."</p>
               <p>"But where shall we sleep nights, Tina?"</p>
               <p>"O, it was so pleasant last night, and the moon shone so bright, I would not be
                  afraid to cuddle down under a bush with you, Harry."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Tina! you don't know what may come. The moon don't shine all night, and there
                  may be cold and wind and rain, and then where would we be? Come, darling, let's go
                  on; we can walk in the fields by the river, and so get down to the place Sol told
                  us about."</p>
               <p>So at last the little fanciful body was persuaded to wade back from her desolate
                  island, and to set out once more on her pilgrimage. But even an older head than
                  hers might have been turned by the delights of that glorious October day, and gone
                  off into a vague trance of bliss, in which the only good of life seemed to be in
                  luxurious lounging and dreamy enjoyment of the passing hour. Nature in New England
                  is, for the most part, a sharp, determined matron, of the Miss Asphyxia school.
                  She is shrewd, keen, relentless, energetic. She runs through the seasons a
                  merciless express-train, on which you may jump if you can, at her hours, but which
                  knocks you down remorselessly if you come in her way, and leaves you hopelessly
                  behind if you are late. Only for a few brief weeks in the autumn does this grim,
                  belligerent female condescend to be charming; but when she does set about it, the
                  veriest Circe of enchanted isles could not do it better. Airs more dreamy, more
                  hazy, more full of purple light and lustre, never lay over Cyprus or Capri than
                  those which each October overshadow the granite rocks and prickly chestnuts of New
                  England. The trees seem to run no longer sap, but some strange liquid glow; the
                  colors of the flowers flame up, from the cold, pallid delicacy of spring, into
                  royal tints wrought of the very fire of the sun and the hues of evening clouds.
                  The humblest weed, which we trod under our foot unnoticed in summer, changes with
                  the first frost into some colored marvel, and lifts itself up into a study for a
                  painter,—just as the touch of death or adversity often strikes out in a rough
                  nature traits of nobleness and delicacy before wholly undreamed of.</p>
               <p>The children travelled onward along the winding course of the river, through a
                  prairie-land of wild-flowers. The whole tribe of asters—white, lilac, pale blue,
                  and royal purple—were rolling in perfect billows of blossoms around them, and the
                  sprays of golden-rod often rose above their heads, as they crackled their way
                  through the many-colored thickets. The children were both endowed with an
                  organization exquisitely susceptible to beauty, and the flowers seemed to
                  intoxicate them with their variety and brilliancy. They kept gathering from right
                  to left without any other object than the possession of a newer and fairer spray,
                     till<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7953-00000083"/> their little arms were full;
                  and then they would lay them down to select from the mass the choicest, which
                  awhile after would be again thrown by for newer and fairer treasures. Their motion
                  through the bushes often disturbed clouds of yellow butterflies, which had been
                  hanging on the fringes of the tall purple asters, and which rose toying with each
                  other, and fluttering in ethereal dances against the blue sky, looking like whirls
                  and eddies of air-flowers. One of the most brilliant incidents in the many-colored
                  pictures of October days is given by these fluttering caprices of the butterflies.
                  Never in any other part of the season are these airy tribes so many and so
                  brilliant. There are, in particular, whole armies of small, bright yellow ones,
                  which seem born for no other purpose than to make effective and brilliant
                  contrasts with those royal-purple tints of asters, and they hang upon them as if
                  drawn to them by some law of affinity in their contrasting colors.</p>
               <p>Tina was peculiarly enchanted with the fanciful fellowship of these butterflies.
                  They realized exactly her ideal of existence, and she pointed them out to Harry as
                  proof positive that her own notion of living on sunshine and flowers was not a bad
                  one. She was quite sure that they could sleep out all night if the butterflies
                  could, and seemed not to doubt that they would fancy her as a bedfellow.</p>
               <p>
                  <unclear>Towards sundown</unclear>, when the children were somewhat weary of
                  wandering, and had consumed most of the provisions in their basket, they came
                  suddenly on a little tent pitched in the field, at the door of which sat an old
                  Indian woman weaving baskets. Two or three red-skinned children, of about the same
                  age as our wanderers, were tumbling and kicking about on the ground, in high
                  frolic, with about as many young puppies, who were scratching, rolling, and
                  biting, with their human companions, in admirable spirits. There was a fire before
                  the door, over which a pot was swung from a frame of crossed sticks, the odor of
                  which steamed up, suggestive of good cheer.</p>
               <p>The old Indian woman received the children with a broad, hearty grin, while Harry
                  inquired of her how far it was to Oldtown. The old squaw gave it as her opinion,
                  in very Indian English, that it was "muchee walkee" for little white boy, and that
                  he had best stay with her that night and go on to-morrow.</p>
               <p>"There, Harry," said Tina, "now you see just how it is. This is a nice little
                  house for us to sleep in, and oh! I see such pretty baskets in it."</p>
               <p>The old woman drew out a stock of her wares, from which she selected a small,
                  gayly-painted one, which she gave to the children; in short, it was very soon
                  arranged that they were to stop to supper and spend the night with her. The little
                  Indians gathered around them and surveyed them with grins of delight; and the
                  puppies, being in that state of ceaseless effervescence of animal spirits which
                  marks the indiscreet era of puppyhood, soon had the whole little circle in a state
                  of uproarious laughter.</p>
               <p>By and by, the old woman poured the contents of the pot into a wooden trough, and
                  disclosed a smoking mess of the Indian dish denominated succotash,—to wit, a soup
                  of corn and beans, with a generous allowance of salt pork. Offering a large, clean
                  clam-shell to each of the children, she invited them to help themselves.</p>
               <p>Whether it was the exhilarating effect of a whole day spent on foot in the open
                  air, or whether it was owing to the absolute perfection of the cookery, we cannot
                  pretend to say, but certain it is that the children thought they had never tasted
                  anything better; and Tina's spirits became so very airy and effervescent, that she
                  laughed perpetually,—a state which set the young barbarians to laughing for
                  sympathy; and this caused all the puppies to bark at once, which made more fun; so
                  that, on the whole, a jollier supper company could nowhere be found.</p>
               <p>After sundown, when the whole party had sufficiently fatigued themselves with play
                  and laughing, the old woman spread a skin inside the tent, where Tina lay down
                  contentedly between Harry and one of the puppies, which she insisted upon having
                  as her own particular bedfellow. Harry kneeled down to his prayers outside the
                  tent, which being observed by the Indian woman, she clasped her hands, and seemed
                  to listen with great devotion; and when he had finished, she said, "Me praying
                  Indian; me much love Jesus."</p>
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7953-00000084"/>
               <p>The words were said with a tender gleam over the rough, hard, swarthy features;
                  and the child felt comforted by them as he nestled down to his repose.</p>
               <p>"Harry," said Tina, decisively, "let's we live here. I like to play with the
                  puppies, and the old woman is good to us."</p>
               <p>"We 'll see, Tina," said wise little Harry.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE OLD MANOR-HOUSE.</head>
               <p>ALAS! the next morning dawned wet and rainy. The wind flapped the tent-cover, and
                  the rain put out the fire; and, what was worse, a cross, surly Indian man came
                  home, who beat the poor old woman, and scattered the children and puppies, like
                  partridges, into the bushes.</p>
               <p>The poor old squaw took it all patiently, and seemed only intent on protecting the
                  children from injuries and inconveniences on which she calculated as part of her
                  daily lot. She beckoned them to her, and pointed across a field. "Go dat way.
                  White folks dere be good to you." And she insisted on giving them the painted
                  basket and some coarse corn bread.</p>
               <p>They set off through the fields; but the wind was chilly and piercing, and the
                  bushes and grass were wet, and Tina was in a doleful state. "O Harry, I wish we
                  had a house to live in! Where do you suppose all the butterflies are staying that
                  we saw yesterday? I 'd like to go where they stay."</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Tina; by and by we 'll come to a house."</p>
               <p>They passed a spot where evidently some Indians had been camping, for there were
                  the remains of a fire; and Harry picked up some dry brush and refuse sticks
                  around, and kindled it up bright for Tina to warm and dry herself. They sat there
                  awhile and fed the fire, till they began to feel quite warm. In one of Harry's
                  excursions for sticks, he came back and reported a house in sight.</p>
               <p>Sure enough, concealed from view behind a pine thicket was a large, stately
                  mansion, the approach to which was through an avenue of majestic trees. The path
                  to this was all grown over with high grass, and a wilderness of ornamental
                  shrubbery seemed to have twined and matted itself together in a wild labyrinth of
                  utter desertion and neglect. The children made their way up<pb n="160-161"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000085"/> the avenue through dripping grass, and bushes that
                  reached almost to their shoulders, and that drizzled water upon their partially
                  dried garments in a way that made Tina shiver. "I 'm so cold!" she said,
                  pitifully. "The folks must let us come in to dry us."</p>
               <p>They at last stood before the front door, in a sort of porch which overshadowed
                  it, and which rested on Corinthian pillars of some architectural pretension. The
                  knocker was a black serpent with its tail in its mouth. Tina shuddered with some
                  vague, inward dread, as Harry, rising on tiptoe, struck several loud blows upon
                  it, and then waited to see who would appear.</p>
               <p>The wind now rose, and tossed and swung the branches of the great trees in the
                  avenue with a creaking, groaning sound. The shrubbery had grown around the house
                  in a dense and tangled mass, that produced, in the dismal stormy weather, a sense
                  of oppression and darkness. Huge lilacs had climbed above the chamber windows, and
                  clumps of syringas billowed outward from the house in dense cascades; while roses
                  and various kinds of more tender shrubbery, which had been deprived of light and
                  air by their more hardy neighbors, filled up the space below with bare, dead
                  branches, through which the wind sighed dolefully.</p>
               <p>"Harry, do knock again," said Tina, when they had waited some time.</p>
               <p>"It's no use," said the boy; "I don't think anybody lives here."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, if we go round to the back of the house, we shall find somebody," said
                  Tina; "it's storming worse and worse." And the little girl plunged resolutely into
                  the thicket of dead shrubbery, and began tearing her way through.</p>
               <p>There was a door on the side of the house, much like that in front; and there were
                  spacious back buildings, which, joining the house, stretched far away in the
                  shrubbery. Harry tried this side door. It was firmly locked. The children then
                  began regularly trying every door that presented itself to their view. At last
                  one, after considerable effort, gave way before their united exertions, and opened
                  to them a shelter from the storm, which was now driving harder and harder. It was
                  a place that had evidently been used for the storing of wood, for there was then
                  quite a pile of fuel systematically arranged against the wall. An ancient axe,
                  perfectly red with rust, was also hanging there.</p>
               <p>"Well, we 're in at last," said Tina, "but wet through. What a storm it is!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps we can get to some better place in the house," said Harry; "here is wood,
                  and we might make a fire and dry our clothes, and wait here till the storm is
                  over."</p>
               <p>He accordingly pushed against a door at the farther end of the wood-shed, and it
                  opened before him into a large old kitchen. There was the ample fireplace of olden
                  times, extending quite across one side, garnished with a crane having various
                  hooks and other paraphernalia for the convenience of culinary operations.</p>
               <p>"There, now," said Harry, "is a fireplace, and here is wood. Now we can dry
                  ourselves. Just you wait here, and I 'll go back and bring a brand from our fire,
                  if the rain has n't put it all out." And Harry turned, and hastily made the best
                  of his way out of the house, to secure his treasure before it should be too
                  late.</p>
               <p>Tina now resolved to explore some of the other rooms. She opened a door which
                  seemed to lead into a large dining-hall. A heavy dining-table of dark wood stood
                  in the middle of this room, and a large, old-fashioned carved sideboard filled up
                  an arched recess. Heavy mahogany chairs with stuffed leathern bottoms stood
                  against the wall, but the brass nails with which they had been finished were green
                  with rust. The windows of this room were so matted over with cobwebs, and so
                  darkened by the dense shrubbery outside, as to give the apartment a most weird and
                  forlorn appearance. One of the panes of the window had been broken, perhaps by the
                  striking of the shrubbery against it; and the rain and snow beating in there had
                  ruined the chair that stood below, for the seat of it was all discolored with
                  mould.</p>
               <p>Tina shivered as she looked at this dreary room, and the tapping of her own little
                  heels seemed to her like something ghostly; so she hastened to open another door.
                  This led to a small apartment, which had evidently been a lady's boudoir. The
                  walls were hung with tapestry of a dark-green ground, on which flowers and<pb
                     n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7953-00000086"/> fruits and birds were represented in
                  colors that yet remained brilliant, notwithstanding the dilapidated air of some
                  portions of it. There was a fireplace in this room, and the mantel was choicely
                  carved, of white Italian marble, and upon it were sundry flasks and vases of
                  Venetian glass, of quaint and strange shapes, which the child eyed with awe-struck
                  curiosity. By the side of the fireplace was a broad lounge or sofa, with a pile of
                  cushions, covered with a rich but faded brocade, of a pattern evidently made to
                  carry out the same design with the tapestry on the wall.</p>
               <p>A harpsichord occupied another side of the room, and upon it were piled
                  music-books and manuscript music yellow with age. There was a sort of Oriental
                  guitar or lute suspended from the wall, of which one of the strings, being broken,
                  vibrated with the air of the door when the child made her way into the room, and
                  continued quivering in a way that seemed to her nervous and ghostly. Still she was
                  a resolute and enterprising little body; and though her heart was beating at a
                  terrible rate, she felt a sort of mixture of gratified curiosity and exultation in
                  her discovery.</p>
               <p>"I wish Harry would come back," she said to herself. "We might make a fire in this
                  pretty little room, and it would be quite snug, and we could wait here till the
                  folks come home." How glad she was when the sound of his voice and footsteps broke
                  the terrible loneliness! She ran out to him, exclaiming, "O Harry, we won't make a
                  fire in this great, doleful old kitchen. I 've found such a nice little room full
                  of pretty things! Let me bring in some wood";—and, running to the wood-pile, she
                  filled her arms.</p>
               <p>"It was all I could do to find a brand with a bit of fire on it," said Harry.
                  "There was only the least spark left, but I put it under my jacket and blew and
                  blew, and now we have quite a bright spot in it," he said, showing with exultation
                  a black brand with a round, fiery eye in it, which had much the appearance of a
                  knowing old goblin winking at the children.</p>
               <p>The desolate boudoir was soon a scene of much animation, as the marble hearth was
                  strewn with chips and splinters.</p>
               <p>"Let me blow, Harry," said Tina, "while you go and look for some more of this
                  brushwood. I saw a heap in that woodhouse house. I 'll tend the fire while you are
                  gone. See," she said triumphantly to him, when he returned, dragging in a heavy
                  pile of brushwood, "we 'll soon have such a fire!"—and she stooped down over the
                  hearth, laying the burnt ends of sticks together, and blowing till her cheeks were
                  so aflame with zeal and exertion that she looked like a little live coal herself.
                  "Now for it!" she said, as she broke bit after bit of the brushwood. "See now, it
                  's beginning to burn,—hear it crackle! Now put on more and more."</p>
               <p>Very soon, in fact, the brushwood crackled and roared in a wide sheet of flame up
                  the old chimney; and being now rein-forced with stout sticks of wood, the fire
                  took a solid and settled and companionable form,—the brightest, most hopeful
                  companion a mortal could ask for in a chill, stormy day in autumn.</p>
               <p>"Now, Harry," said Tina, "let 's dry our clothes, and then we will see what we can
                  do in our house."</p>
               <p>"But is it really ours?" said thoughtful Harry. "Who knows who it may belong
                  to?"</p>
               <p>"Do you think," said Tina, apprehensively, "that any giant lives here that has
                  gone out and will come home again? Father used to tell us a story like that."</p>
               <p>"There are n't really giants now-a-days, Tina," said Harry; "those are only
                  stories. I don't think that it looks as if anybody had lived here for a great
                  while. Things don't look as if anybody lived here, or was expecting to come
                  back."</p>
               <p>"Then we may as well live here as anybody," said Tina, "and I will keep house for
                  you. I will roast some apples for our dinner,—I saw ever so many out here on the
                  tree. Roast apples with our corn bread will be so good! And then we can sleep
                  to-night on this great, wide sofa,—can't we? Here, let me sweep up the chips we
                  have made, and make our little house look nice."</p>
               <p>"It must be a long time since any one has lived here," said Harry, looking up at
                  the cobwebbed window, against which the shrubbery was dashing and beating in the
                  fury of the storm, "and there can't be the least harm in our staying here till the
                  storm is over."</p>
               <p>"Such a strange, pretty room this is!" said Tina, "and so many<pb n="164-165"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000087"/> strange, pretty things in it! Do you know, Harry, I
                  was almost afraid to be here while you were gone; but this bright, warm fire makes
                  such a difference. Fire is company, is n't it?"</p>
               <p>When the little one had dried her clothes, she began, with a restless, butterfly
                  sort of motion, to investigate more closely the various objects of the apartment.
                  She opened the harpsichord, and struck a few notes, which sounded rather
                  discordantly, as an instrument which chill and solitude had smitten with a lasting
                  hoarseness.</p>
               <p>"O, horrid! This is n't pretty," she said. "I wonder who ever played on it? But, O
                  Harry! come and look here! I thought this was another room in here, with a fire in
                  it," she said, as she lifted a curtain which hung over a recess. "Look! it's only
                  looking-glass in a door. Where does it go to? Let's see." And with eager curiosity
                  she turned the knob, and the door opened, disclosing only a sort of inner closet,
                  which had been evidently employed for a writing-cabinet, as a writing-table stood
                  there, and book-cases filled with books.</p>
               <p>What most attracted the attention of the children was a picture, which was hung
                  exactly opposite the door, so that it met the children face to face. It was the
                  image of a young girl, dressed in white, with long, black, curling hair falling
                  down over her neck and shoulders. The dark eyes had an expression both searching
                  and melancholy; and it was painted in that peculiar manner, which produces such
                  weird effects on the beholder, in which the eyes seem to be fixed upon the
                  spectator, and to follow him on whichever side he stands.</p>
               <p>"What a pretty lady! But she looks at us so!" said Tina, covering her eyes. "I
                  almost thought it was a real woman."</p>
               <p>"Whichever way we move, she looks after us," said Harry.</p>
               <p>"She looks as if she would speak to us," said Tina; "she surely wants to say
                  something."</p>
               <p>"It is something very sad, then," said the boy, studying the picture attentively.
                  "She was not sad as mother was," said he, with a delicate, spiritual instinct
                  reading the impression of the face. "Mother used to look very, very sad, but in a
                  different way,—a better way, I think."</p>
               <p>"Of course it is n't in the least like mother," said Tina. "Mother had soft,
                  bright hair,—not black, like this; and her eyes were blue, like yours, Harry."</p>
               <p>"I don't mean her hair or her eyes," said Harry; "but when mother was sad, she
                  always used to pray. I don't think this one looks as if she would pray," said the
                  boy, rather under his breath.</p>
               <p>There was, in fact, a lurking sparkle of haughty determination in the depths of
                  the mournful eyes, and a firm curve to the lines of the mouth, an arching of the
                  neck, and a proud carriage of the head, that confirmed the boy's strictures, and
                  indicated that, whatever sorrows might have crushed the poor heart that beat
                  beneath that fair form, they were borne in her own strength, with no uplooking for
                  aid.</p>
               <p>Tina longed to open the drawers of the cabinet beneath the picture, but Harry held
                  her hand. "Tina, dear, what would mother say?" he said, reprovingly. "This is n't
                  our house. Whoever owns it would n't think it was wrong for us to stay here in
                  such a storm, but we certainly ought not to touch their things."</p>
               <p>"But we may go through the house, and see all the rooms," said Tina, who had a
                  genuine feminine passion for rummaging, and whose curiosity was piqued to the
                  extreme point by the discoveries already made. "I shall be afraid to sleep here
                  to-night, unless I know all that is in the house."</p>
               <p>So the children went, hand in hand, through the various apartments. The house was
                  one of those stately manors which, before the Revolutionary war, the titled
                  aristocracy of England delighted to reproduce on the virgin soil of America. Even
                  to this modern time, some of the old provincial towns in New England preserve one
                  or two of these monuments of the pride and pomp of old colonial days, when America
                  was one of the antechambers of the English throne and aristocracy.</p>
               <p>The histories of these old houses, if searched into, present many romantic
                  incidents, in which truth may seem wilder than fiction. In the breaking of the
                  ties between the mother country and America, many of these stately establishments
                  were suddenly broken up, and the property, being subject to governmental claims<pb
                     n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7953-00000088"/> yet undecided, lay a long time
                  unoccupied; the real claimants being in England, and their possessions going
                  through all the processes of deterioration and decay incident to property in the
                  hands of agents at a distance from the real owners. The moss of legend and
                  tradition grew upon these deserted houses. Life in New England, in those days, had
                  not the thousand stimulants to the love of excitement which are to be found in the
                  throng and rush of modern society, and there was a great deal more of
                  story-telling and romancing in real life than exists now; and the simple villagers
                  by their firesides delighted to plunge into the fathomless abyss of incident that
                  came from the histories of grand, unknown people across the water, who had
                  established this incidental connection with their neighborhood. They exaggerated
                  the records of the pomp and wealth that had environed them. They had thrilling
                  legends of romantic and often tragic incidents, of which such houses had been the
                  theatres. More than one of them had its well-attested ghosts, which, at all proper
                  hours, had been veritably seen to go through all those aimless ghostly
                  perambulations and performances which, according to village legends, diversify the
                  leisure of the spiritual state.</p>
               <p>The house into which the children's wandering fortunes had led them was one whose
                  legends and history formed the topic of many an excited hour of my childhood, as
                  crooned over to me by different story-telling gossips; and it had, in its
                  structure and arrangements, the evident impress of days nevermore to be reproduced
                  in New England. Large and lofty apartments, some of them still hung with tapestry,
                  and some adorned with arches and columns, were closed in from air and light by
                  strong shutters, although a dusky glimmer came through the heart-shaped holes cut
                  in them. Some of these apartments were quite dismantled and bare. In others the
                  furniture was piled together in confusion, as if for the purpose of removal. One
                  or two chambers were still thoroughly furnished, and bore the marks of having
                  been, at some recent period, occupied; for there were mattresses and pillows and
                  piles of bedclothing on the great, stately bedsteads.</p>
               <p>"We might sleep in one of these rooms," said Harry.</p>
               <p>"O, no, no!" said the child, clinging to him; "I should be afraid. That great,
                  dreadful-looking, dark bed! And who knows what might be behind the curtains! Let
                  me sleep in the bright little room, where we can see all around us. I should be
                  afraid that lady in the closet would walk about these rooms in the night."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps she did once," said Harry. "But come, let us go down. The wind blows and
                  howls so about these lonesome rooms, it makes me afraid."</p>
               <p>"How it rumbles down the chimneys!" said Tina; "and now it squeals just as if
                  somebody was hurting it. It 's a terrible storm, is n't it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it's well we are in a house at any rate," said Harry; "but let 's go down
                  and bring in wood, and I 'll get some apples and pears off the trees out by the
                  back door."</p>
               <p>And so the two poor little swallows chittered as they built their small, innocent
                  nest in the deserted house, as ignorant of the great Before and After, as if they
                  had had wings and feathers, and round, bright bird-eyes, instead of curly, golden
                  heads. Harry brought in a quantity of fruit in Tina's little checked apron, and,
                  like two squirrels, they stored it under the old brocade sofa.</p>
               <p>"Now ever so much wood in the hall here," said Tina, with the providence of a
                  little housewife; "because when the dark night comes we shall be afraid to go into
                  the wood-house."</p>
               <p>Harry felt very large and very provident, and quite like a householder, as he
                  brought armful after armful and laid it outside the door, while Tina arranged some
                  apples to roast on the marble hearth. "If we only could get something to eat every
                  day, we might live here always," she said.</p>
               <p>And so that evening, when the night shadows came down darkly on the house, though
                  the storm without thundered and beat and groaned amid the branches of the old
                  trees, and rumbled and shook the chimneys of the solitary manor-house, there was
                  one nook that presented as bright and warm a picture as two fair child-faces, with
                  a background of strange antique furniture and surroundings, could furnish. The
                  fire had burned down into<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7953-00000089"/> great
                  splendid glowing coals, in which the children, seated before it on the tapestried
                  hearth-rug, saw all sorts of strange faces. Tina had insisted on keeping open the
                  door of the cabinet where the beautiful lady was, because, she said, she must be
                  lonesome in that dark closet by herself.</p>
               <p>"I wish she would only smile," she said, as the sharp spires of flame from a new
                  stick of wood which she had just laid on, dancing up, made the face seem to become
                  living and tremulous as if with emotion. "See, Hensel, she looks as if she were
                  going to speak to us."</p>
               <p>And hours later the fire still burned in the little boudoir; but the two pretty
                  child-faces lay cheek to cheek in the wide, motherly arms of the sofa, and the
                  shadowy lady seemed to watch over them silently from her lonely recess.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">SAM LAWSON'S DISCOVERIES.</head>
               <p>THE evening was closing in sharp and frosty, with a lowering of wind and cloud
                  that rendered fire-light doubly dear and welcome, as we all drew our chairs round
                  the great, glowing fire in my grandmother's kitchen. I had my little block of
                  wood, which served as a footstool, far in the cavernous depths of one end of the
                  fireplace, close by Black Cæsar, who was busy making me a popgun, while my
                  grandmother sat at the other end in her rocking-chair, rattling her
                  knitting-needles. Uncle Fly had just frisked in, and was perched, as was his wont,
                  on the very tip of his chair, where he sat fussily warming and rubbing his hands,
                  much as a meditative blue-bottle performs the same operation with his fore
                  feet.</p>
               <p>"So," said my grandmother to my grandfather, in reproachful tones, "you've gone
                  and shut the calf up from its mother."</p>
               <p>"To be sure," said my grandfather; "that was foreordained and freely
                  predetermined."</p>
               <p>"Well, I say it's a shame," sputtered my grandmother,—"poor creturs!"</p>
               <p>It was a part of the farming ordinance, when the calf was fated to be killed, to
                  separate it for a day from its mother, a proceeding which never failed to excite
                  the indignation of my grandmother, which she expressed always with as much life
                  and freshness as if she had never heard of such a matter before in her life. She
                  was not, to be sure, precisely aware what was to be done about it; but in a
                  general way she considered calf-killing as an abominable cruelty, and the parting
                  of calf and cow for a day beforehand as an aggravation. My grandfather was fond of
                  meeting her with a sly use of some of the Calvinistic theological terms which
                  abounded in her favorite writers. The most considerate of husbands often enjoy any
                  quiet method of giving a sly tweak to<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7953-00000090"/>
                  some cherished peculiarity of their yokefellows; and there was the least
                  suggestion of a smile hovering over my grandfather's face,—which smile, in your
                  quiet man, means two things,—first, that he is going to have his own way in spite
                  of all you can say, and, secondly, that he is quietly amused by your
                  opposition.</p>
               <p>"I say it 's a shame," quoth my grandmother, "and I always shall. Hear that poor
                  cow low! She feels as bad as I should."</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Aunt Lois, in an impatient tone, "I wonder that you can't learn to
                  let things go on as they must. What would you have? We must have fresh meat
                  sometimes, and you eat as much as any of us."</p>
               <p>"I don't care, it 's too bad," said my grandmother, "and I always shall think so.
                  If I had things <emph>my</emph> way, folks should n't eat creatures at all."</p>
               <p>"You 'd be a Brahmin," said my grandfather.</p>
               <p>"No, I should n't be a Brahmin, either; but I know an old cow's feelings, and I
                  would n't torment her just to save myself a little trouble."</p>
               <p>The conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of Sam Lawson, who came in
                  with a long, lugubrious face, and an air of solemn, mysterious importance, which
                  usually was the herald of some communication.</p>
               <p>"Well, Sam," said my grandfather, "how are you?"</p>
               <p>"Middlin', Deacon," said Sam, mournfully,—"only middlin'."</p>
               <p>"Sit down, sit down," said my grandfather, "and tell us the news."</p>
               <p>"Wal, I guess I will. How kind o' revivin' and cheerful it does look here," said
                  Sam, seating himself in his usual attitude, with his hands over the fire. "Lordy
                  massy, it's so different to our house! Hepsy hain't spoke a railly decent word to
                  me since the gineral trainin'. You know, Deacon, Monday, a week ago, was gineral
                  trainin' day over to Hopkinton, and Hepsy, she was set in the idee that I should
                  take her and the young uns to muster. 'All right, Hepsy,' says I, 'ef I can borrow
                  a hoss.' Wal, I walked and walked clean up to Captain Brown's to borrow a hoss,
                  and I could n't get none, and I walked clean down to Bill Peters's, and I could
                  n't get none. Finally, Ned Parker, he lent me his'n. Wal, to be sure, his hoss has
                  got the spring-halt, that kind o' twitches up the waggin, and don't look so
                  genteel as some; but, lordy massy, 't was all I could get. But Hepsy, she blamed
                  me all the same. And then she was at me 'cause she had n't got no gloves. Wal, I
                  had n't no gret o' change in my pocket, and I wanted to keep it for gingerbread
                  and sich for the young uns, so I thought I 'd jest borrow a pair for her, and say
                  nothin'; and I went over and asked Mis' Captain Brown, and over to Mis' Dana's,
                  and round to two or three places; and finally Lady Lothrop, she said she 'd
                     <emph>give</emph> me a old pair o' hern. And I brought 'em to Hepsy; and do you
                  believe, she throwed 'em right smack in my face. 'S'pose I'm goin' to wear such an
                  old dirty pair as that?' says she. Wal, arter all, we sot out, and Hepsy, she got
                  clear beat out; and when Hepsy does get beat out she has <emph>spells,</emph> and
                  she goes on awful, and they last day arter day. Hepsy's spells is jest like these
                  'ere northeast storms,—they never do railly clear off, but kind o' wear out, as 't
                  were,—and this 'ere seems to be about one of her longest. She was at me this
                  mornin' fust thing 'fore I was out o' bed, cry-in' and goin' on, and castin' on it
                  up at me the men she might 'a' hed if she had n't 'a' hed me, and the things they
                  'd 'a' done for her, jest as if 't was my fault. 'Lordy massy, Hepsy,' says I, 'I
                  ain't t' blame. I wish with all my heart you hed 'a' hed any on 'em you 'd
                  ruther.' You see I wa' n't meanin' no 'fence, you know, but just a bein' kind o'
                  sympathizin' like, and she flew at me 't oncet. Massy to us! why, you 'd 'a'
                  thought all them old Sodom and Gomorrah sinners biled down wa' n't nothin' to me.
                  She did talk ridiculous. I tried to reason with her. Says I, 'Hepsy, see here now.
                  Here you be in a good bed, in your own house, and your kindlin's all split to make
                  your fire,—and I split every one on 'em after twelve o'clock last night,—and you a
                  goin' on at this 'ere rate. Hepsy,' says I, 'it 's awful.' But, lordy massy, how
                  that 'ere woman can talk! She begun agin, and I could n't get in a word edgeways
                  nor crossways nor noways; and so I jest got up and went round to the tavern, and
                  there I met Bill Moss and Jake Marshall, and we had some crackers and cheese and a
                  little suthin' hot with it, and it kind o'<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000091"/> 'curred to me, as Hepsy was in one o' her spells,
                  it would be a good time to go kind o' Indianing round the country a spell till she
                  kind o' come to, ye know. And so I thought I'd jest go t' other side o' Hopkinton
                  and see Granny Walkers,—her that was housekeeper to Lady Frankland, ye know,—and
                  see if I could n't rake out the pertickelars of that 'ere Dench house. That 'ere
                  house has been a lyin' on my mind considerable, along back."</p>
               <p>My ears began to prick up with great liveliness and animation at this sound; and,
                  deserting Cæsar, I went over and stood by Sam, and surveyed him with fixed
                  attention, wondering in the mean time how a house could lie on his mind.</p>
               <p>"Well," said my grandfather, "what did you hear?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, I did n't get over to her house; but when I 'd walked a pretty good piece I
                  came across Widdah Peters's son, Sol Peters,—you know him, Mis' Badger, he lives
                  over in Needmore with a great, spankin' old gal they call Miss Asphyxy Smith.
                  You've heard of Miss Sphyxy Smith, hain't you, Mis' Badger?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly I have," said my grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Miss Asphyxia Smith is a smart, industrious woman," said Aunt Lois; "it is n't
                  worth while to talk so about her. The world would be better off," she continued,
                  eying Sam with an air of didactic severity, "if there were more people in it that
                  keep to their own business, like Miss Sphyxy."</p>
               <p>"Wal, spuz so," said Sam Lawson, with an innocent and virtuous droop, not in the
                  slightest degree recognizing the hint; "but now, you see, I'm coming to a pint.
                  Sol, he asked me if anybody over to Oldtown had seen or heard anything of a couple
                  of children that had run away from Needmore. There was a boy and a gal about nine
                  or ten or under, that had been put out by the parish. The boy was livin' with Old
                  Crab Smith, and the gal with Miss Sphyxy."</p>
               <p>"Well, I pity the child that Miss Sphyxy Smith has taken to bring up, I must say,"
                  said my grandmother. "What business have old maids a taking children to bring up,
                  I want to know? Why, it is n't every hen that's fit to bring up chickens. How came
                  the children there, anyway?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, you see, there come a woman along to Crab Smith's with these 'ere children.
                  Sol says they're real putty children,—putty-behaved as ever he see. The woman, she
                  was took down and died there. And so Old Crab, he took the boy; and Miss Sphyxy,
                  she took the gal."</p>
               <p>"Too bad," said my grandmother; "poor motherless babes, and nobody but Crab and
                  Sphyxy Smith to do for 'em! Somebody ought to see about it."</p>
               <p>"Wal, ye see, Sol, he said that Miss Sphyxy was as hard as a grindstone on this
                  gal, and they kep' the boy and gal apart, and would n't let 'em see nor speak to
                  each other; and Sol says he never did pity any poor, lonesome little critter as he
                  did that 'ere little gal. She used to lie abed nights, and sob and cry fit to
                  break her little heart."</p>
               <p>"I should like to go and talk to that woman!" said my grandmother, vengefully. "I
                  wonder folks can be so mean! I wonder what such folks think of themselves, and
                  where they expect to go to!".</p>
               <p>"Wal, you see," continued Sam, "the young un was spicy; and when Miss Sphyxy was
                  down on her too hard, the child, she fit her,—you know a rat 'll bite, a hen will
                  peck, and a worm will turn,—and finally it come to a fight between 'em; and Miss
                  Sphyxy, she gin her an awful whippin'. 'Lordy massy, Sol,' says I, when Sol was a
                  tellin' me, 'you need n't say nothin' about it. That 'ere gal's got arms like a
                  windmill; she's a regular brown thrasher, she is, only she ain't got no music in
                  her; and ef she undertook to thrash me, she 'd make out.'"</p>
               <p>"Well, what became of the children?" said my grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Wal, you see, they run off together; fact is, Sol says he helped 'em off, and
                  told 'em to come over to Oldtown. He says he told 'em to inquire for Deacon
                  Badger's."</p>
               <p>"I believe so," said Aunt Lois, severely. "Every man, woman, and child that wants
                  taking care of is sent straight to our house."</p>
               <p>"And good reason they should, Lois," said my grandmother, who was wide awake. "I
                  declare, people ought to be out looking for them. 'Liakim, you are always flying
                  about; why don't you look 'em up?"</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7953-00000092"/>
               <p>Uncle Fly jumped up with alacrity. "To be sure, they ought to be looked after," he
                  said, running to the window. "They ought to be looked after right off; they must
                  be attended to." And Uncle Fly seemed to have an indefinite intention of pitching
                  straight through the window in pursuit.</p>
               <p>Sam Lawson eyed him with a serene gravity. He felt the importance of being
                  possessed of all the information the subject in question admitted of, which he was
                  determined to develop in an easy and leisurely manner, without any undue hurry or
                  heat. "Mr. Sheril," he said, "the fust thing you'll hev to find out is <emph>where
                     they be.</emph> It's no use tearin' round gen'lly. Where be they?—that's the
                  question."</p>
               <p>"To be sure, to be sure," said Uncle Fly. "Well, what you got to say about
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, you jest set down now, and be kind o' composed. I'm a comin' to that 'ere
                  pint in time," said Sam. "That 'ere 's jest what I says to Sol. 'Sol,' says I,
                  'where be they?' And Sol, he says to me, 'I dunno. They might 'a' gone with the
                  Indians,' says Sol, 'or they might 'a' got lost in the Oldtown woods';—and jest as
                  we was a talkin', we see old Obscue a coming' along. He was out on a tramp over to
                  Hopkinton, Obscue was, and we asked him about 'em. Wal, Obscue, he says that a gal
                  and boy like what we talked of had slep' in his wife's hut not long sence. You
                  know Obscue's wife; she makes baskets, and goes round sellin' on 'em. I could n't
                  fairly get out o' Obscue what day 't was, nor which way they went arter; but it
                  was clear that them was the ones."</p>
               <p>"Then," said Uncle Fly, "they must be somewhere. They may have lost their way in
                  the Oldtown woods, and wandered up and down. There ought to be a party started out
                  to look for 'em to-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>"Now look here, Mr. Sheril," said Sam, "I think we 'd better kind o' concentrate
                  our idees on some one pint afore we start out, and I'll tell you what I 'm a
                  thinkin' of. You know I was a tellin' you that I 'd seen smoke coming out o' the
                  chimbly of the Dench house. Now I jest thought them poor little robins might have
                  jest got in there. You know it stormed like vengeance geance last week, and the
                  little critters might have took shelter in that 'ere lonesome old house."</p>
               <p>"Poor babes!" said my grandmother. "'Liakim, you go up there and see."</p>
               <p>"Well, I tell you," said Uncle Eliakim, "I'll be up bright and early with my old
                  horse and wagon, and go over to the Dench house and see about it."</p>
               <p>"Wal, now," said Sam, "if you would n't mind, I'll just ride over with you. I
                  wanted to kind o' go over that 'ere house. I 've had it on my mind a good
                  while."</p>
               <p>"Is that the haunted house?" said I, in a whisper.</p>
               <p>"Wal, it 's the one they call haunted, but 'tain't best to be 'fraid of nothin',"
                  said Sam, surveying me paternally, and winking very obviously with one eye at
                  Uncle Eliakim; quite forgetting the long roll of terrible suggestions he had made
                  on the same subject a few evenings before.</p>
               <p>"But you told about the man in a long red cloak, and the boy they threw in a well,
                  and a woman in white."</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, what ears young ones has!" said Sam, throwing up his hands
                  pathetically. "I never thought as you was round, Horace; but you must n't never
                  mind nothin' about it. There ain't really no such thing as ghosts."</p>
               <p>"I want to go over and see the house," said I.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, you shall," said Uncle Fly; "but you must wake up bright and early. I
                  shall be off by six o'clock."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, mother," said Aunt Lois, "I just want to know if you are going to make
                  our house an asylum for all the trampers and all the stray children in the
                  neighboring parishes? Have we got to keep these children, or are we going to send
                  'em back where they belong?"</p>
               <p>"Send 'em back to Old Crab Smith and Miss Sphyxy?" said my grandmother. "I'd like
                  to see myself doing that."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, are <emph>we</emph> going to maintain 'em?" said Aunt Lois; "because
                  I want to know definitely what this is coming to."</p>
               <p>"We'll see," said my grandmother. "It 's our business to do good as we have
                  opportunity. <emph>We</emph> must n't reap the corners<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000093"/> of our fields, nor beat off all our olive-berries,
                  but leave 'em for the poor, the fatherless, and the widow, Scripture says."</p>
               <p>"Well, I guess our olive-berries are pretty well beaten off now, and our fields
                  reaped, corners and all," said Lois; "and I don't see why we needs must
                  intermeddle with children that the selectmen in Needmore have put out."</p>
               <p>Now Aunt Lois was a first-rate belligerent power in our family circle, and in many
                  cases carried all before her; but my grandmother always bore her down on questions
                  like these, and it was agreed, <abbr>nem. con.,</abbr> that the expedition to look
                  up the wanderers should take place the next morning.</p>
               <p>The matter being thus arranged, Sam settled back with a jocular freedom of manner,
                  surveying the fire, and flopping his hands over it, smiling to himself in a manner
                  that made it evident that he had a further reserve of something on his mind to
                  communicate. "This 'ere Miss Sphyxy Smith 's a rich old gal, and 'mazin' smart to
                  work," he began. "Tell you, she holds all she gets. Old Sol, he told me a story
                  'bout her that was a pretty good un."</p>
               <p>"What was it?" said my grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Wal, ye see, you 'member old Parson Jeduthun Kendall, that lives up in Stonytown:
                  he lost his wife a year ago last Thanksgiving, and he thought 't was about time he
                  hed another; so he comes down and consults our Parson Lothrop. Says he, 'I want a
                  good, smart, neat, economical woman, with a good property. I don't care nothin'
                  about her bein' handsome. In fact, I ain't particular about anything else,' says
                  he. Wal, Parson Lothrop, says he, 'I think, if that's the case, I know jest the
                  woman to suit ye. She owns a clear, handsome property, and she 's neat and
                  economical; but she's no beauty.' 'O, beauty is nothin' to me,' says Parson
                  Kendall; and so he took the direction. Wal, one day he hitched up his old one-hoss
                  shay, and kind o' brushed up, and started off a courtin'. Wal, the parson he come
                  to the house, and he was tickled to pieces with the looks o' things outside,
                  'cause the house is all well shingled and painted, and there ain't a picket loose
                  nor a nail wantin' nowhere. 'This 'ere 's the woman for me,' says Parson Kendall.
                  So he goes up and raps hard on the front door with his whip-handle. Wal, you see,
                  Miss Sphyxy, she was jest goin' out to help get in her hay. She had on a pair o'
                  clompin' cowhide boots, and a pitchfork in her hand, just goin' out when she heard
                  the rap. So she come jest as she was to the front door. Now you know Parson
                  Kendall 's a little midget of a man; but he stood there on the step kind o'
                  smilin' and genteel, lickin' his lips and lookin' <emph>so</emph> agreeable! Wal,
                  the front door kind o' stuck,—front doors gen'ally do, ye know, 'cause they ain't
                  opened very often,—and Miss Sphyxy, she had to pull and haul and put to all her
                  strength, and finally it come open with a bang, and she 'peared to the parson,
                  pitchfork and all, sort o' frownin' like.</p>
               <p>"'What do you want?' says she; for you see Miss Sphyxy ain't no ways tender to the
                  men.</p>
               <p>"'I want to see Miss Asphyxia Smith,' says he, very civil, thinking she was the
                  hired gal.</p>
               <p>"'<emph>I</emph>'m Miss Asphyxia Smith,' says she. 'What do you want o' me?'</p>
               <p>"Parson Kendall, he jest took one good look on her, from top to toe.
                     '<emph>Nothin</emph>',' says he, and turned right round and went down the steps
                  like lightnin'.</p>
               <p>"The way she banged that 'ere door, Sol said, was lively. He jumped into his shay,
                  and I tell you his old hoss was waked up for once. The way that 'ere old shay spun
                  and bounced was a sight. And when he come to Oldtown, Parson Lothrop was walkin'
                  out in his wig and cocked hat and ruffles, as serene as a pictur, and he took off
                  his hat to him as handsome as a gentleman could; but Parson Kendall, he driv right
                  by and never bowed. He was awful riled, Parson Kendall was; but he could n't say
                  nothin', 'cause he 'd got all he asked for. But the story got out, and Sol and the
                  men heard it, and you 'd a thought they 'd never be done laughin' about it. Sol
                  says, if he was to be hung for it the next minute, he never can help laughin' when
                  he thinks how kind o' scared little Parson Kendall looked when Miss Asphyxia
                  'peared to him on the doorstep."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, well," said Uncle Eliakim, "if we are going to the Dench house
                  to-morrow morning, you must all be up early,<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000094"/> for I mean to be off by daylight; and we 'd better
                  all go to bed." With which remark he fluttered out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>"'Liakim 'll be along here by ten o'clock to-morrow," said my grandfather,
                  quietly. "I don't suppose he 's promised more than forty people to do something
                  for them to-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Aunt Lois, "and the linch-pins of the wagon are probably lost, and the
                  tire of the wheels sprung; but he'll be up before daylight, and maybe get along
                  some time in the forenoon."</p>

               <head type="sub">THE VISIT TO THE HAUNTED HOUSE.</head>
               <p>MY story now approaches a point in which I am soon to meet and begin to feel the
                  force of a train of circumstances which ruled and shaped my whole life. That I had
                  been hitherto a somewhat exceptional child may perhaps have been made apparent in
                  the incidents I have narrated. I was not, in fact, in the least like what an
                  average healthy boy ought to be. My brother Bill was exactly that, and nothing
                  more. He was a good, growing, well-limbed, comfortably disposed animal, reasonably
                  docile, and capable, under fair government, of being made to go exactly in any
                  paths his elders chose to mark out for him.</p>
               <p>It had been settled, the night after my father's funeral, that my Uncle Jacob was
                  to have him for a farm-boy, to work in the summer on the farm, and to pick up his
                  education as he might at the district school in the winter season; and thus my
                  mother was relieved of the burden of his support, and Aunt Lois of his superfluous
                  activity in our home department. To me the loss was a small one; for except a very
                  slight sympathy of souls in the matter of fish-hooks and popguns, there was
                  scarcely a single feeling that we had in common. I had a perfect passion for
                  books, and he had a solid and well-pronounced horror of them, which seems to
                  belong to the nature of a growing boy. I could read, as by a kind of preternatural
                  instinct, as soon as I could walk; and reading was with me at ten years a
                  devouring passion. No matter what the book was that was left in my vicinity, I
                  read it as by an irresistible fascination. To be sure, I preferred stories,
                  history, and lively narrative, where such material was to be had; but the passion
                  for reading was like hunger,—it must be fed, and, in the absence of palatable
                  food, preyed upon what it could find. So it came to pass that theological tracts,
                  treatises on agriculture, old sermons,—anything, in short, that could be raked out
                  of the<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7953-00000095"/> barrels and boxes in my
                  grandfather's garret,—would hold me absorbed in some shady nook of the house when
                  I ought to have been out playing as a proper boy should. I did not, of course,
                  understand the half of what I read, and miscalled the words to myself in a way
                  that would have been laughable had anybody heard me; but the strange, unknown
                  sounds stimulated vague and dreamy images in my mind, which were continually
                  seething, changing, and interweaving, like fog-wreaths by moonlight, and formed a
                  phantasmagoria in which I took a quaint and solemn delight.</p>
               <p>But there was one peculiarity of my childhood which I have hesitated with an odd
                  sort of reluctance to speak of, and yet which so powerfully influenced and
                  determined my life, and that of all with whom I was connected, that it must find
                  some place here. I was, as I said, dreamy and imaginative, with a mind full of
                  vague yearnings. But beside that, through an extreme delicacy of nervous
                  organization, my childish steps were surrounded by a species of vision or
                  apparition so clear and distinct that I often found great difficulty in
                  discriminating between the forms of real life and these shifting shapes, that had
                  every appearance of reality, except that they dissolved at the touch. All my
                  favorite haunts had their particular shapes and forms, which it afforded me
                  infinite amusement to watch in their varying movements.</p>
               <p>Particularly at night, after I had gone to bed and the candle was removed from my
                  room, the whole atmosphere around my bed seemed like that which Raphael has
                  shadowed forth around his Madonna San Sisto,—a palpitating crowd of faces and
                  forms changing in dim and gliding quietude. I have often wondered whether any
                  personal experience similar to mine suggested to the artist this living background
                  to his picture. For the most part, these phantasms were agreeable to me, and
                  filled me with a dreamy delight. Sometimes distinct scenes or visions would rise
                  before my mind, in which I seemed to look far beyond the walls of the house, and
                  to see things passing wherein were several actors. I remember one of these, which
                  I saw very often, representing a venerable old white-headed man playing on a
                  violin. He was always accompanied by a tall, majestic woman, dressed in a strange,
                  outlandish costume, in which I particularly remarked a high fur cap of a peculiar
                  form. As he played, the woman appeared to dance in time to the music. Another
                  scene which frequently presented itself to my eyes was that of a green meadow by
                  the side of a lake of very calm water. From a grove on one side of the lake would
                  issue a miniature form of a woman clothed in white, with a wide golden girdle
                  around her waist, and long, black hair hanging down to her middle, which she
                  constantly smoothed down with both her hands, with a gentle, rhythmical movement,
                  as she approached me. At a certain point of approach, she always turned her back,
                  and began a rapid retreat into the grove; and invariably as she turned there
                  appeared behind her the image of a little misshapen dwarf, who pattered after her
                  with ridiculous movements which always made me laugh. Night after night, during a
                  certain year of my life, this pantomime never failed to follow the extinguishment
                  of the candle, and it was to me a never-failing source of delight. One thing was
                  peculiar about these forms,—they appeared to cause a vibration of the great
                  central nerves of the body, as when a harp-string is struck. So I could feel in
                  myself the jar of the dwarf's pattering feet, the soft, rhythmic movement of the
                  little woman stroking down her long hair, the vibrations of the violin, and the
                  steps of the dancing old woman. Nobody knew of this still and hidden world of
                  pleasure which was thus nightly open to me. My mother used often to wonder, when,
                  hours after she put me to bed, she would find me lying perfectly quiet, with my
                  eyes widely and calmly open. Once or twice I undertook to tell her what I saw, but
                  was hushed up with, "Nonsense, child! there has n't been anybody in the room; you
                  should n't talk so."</p>
               <p>The one thing that was held above all things sacred and inviolable in a child's
                  education in those old Puritan days was to form habits of truth. Every statement
                  received an immediate and unceremonious sifting, and anything that looked in the
                  least like a departure from actual verity was met with prompt and stringent
                  discouragement. When my mother repeated before Aunt Lois some of my strange
                  sayings, she was met with the downright declaration: "That child will be an awful
                  liar, Susy, if you don't keep a strict lookout on him. Don't you let him tell you
                  any stories like that."</p>
               <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7953-00000096"/>
               <p>So I early learned silence; but my own confidence in the reality of my secondary
                  world was not a whit diminished. Like Galileo, who said, "It does move,
                  nevertheless," so I, when I once had the candle out at night, snapped my fingers
                  mentally at Aunt Lois, and enjoyed my vision.</p>
               <p>One peculiarity of these appearances was that certain of them seemed like a sort
                  of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">genii loci,</foreign>—shapes belonging to certain
                  places. The apparition of the fairy woman with the golden girdle only appeared in
                  a certain room where I slept one year, and which had across one of its corners a
                  sort of closet called a buffet. From this buffet the vision took its rise, and
                  when my parents moved to another house it never appeared again.</p>
               <p>A similar event in my shadow-world had marked our coming to my grandmother's to
                  live. The old violin-player and his wife had for a long time been my nightly
                  entertainers; but the first night after we were established in the apartment given
                  up to our use by Aunt Lois, I saw them enter as they usually did, seeming to come
                  right through the wall of the room. They, however, surveyed the apartment with a
                  sort of confused, discontented movement, and seemed to talk to each other with
                  their backs to me; finally I heard the old woman say, "We can't stay here," and
                  immediately I saw them passing through the wall of the house. I saw after them as
                  clearly as if the wall had dissolved and given my eyes the vision of all out of
                  doors. They went to my grandfather's wood-pile and looked irresolutely round;
                  finally they mounted on the pile, and seemed to sink gradually through it and
                  disappear, and I never saw them afterwards.</p>
               <p>But another of the companions of my solitude was more constant to me. This was the
                  form of a young boy of about my own age, who for a year past had frequently come
                  to me at night, and seemed to look lovingly upon me, and with whom I used to have
                  a sort of social communion, without words, in a manner which seemed to me far more
                  perfect than human language. I <emph>thought</emph> to him, and in return I
                  received silent demonstrations of sympathy and fellowship from him. I called him
                  Harvey, and used, as I lay looking in his face, mentally to tell him many things
                  about the books I read, the games I played, and the childish joys and griefs I
                  had; and in return he seemed to express affection and sympathy by a strange
                  communication, as lovers sometimes talk to each other by distant glances.</p>
               <p>Attendant on all these exceptional experiences, perhaps resulting from them, was a
                  peculiar manner of viewing the human beings by whom I was surrounded. It is common
                  now-a-days to speak of the sphere or emanation that surrounds a person. To my
                  childish mind there was a vivid perception of something of this nature with regard
                  to every one whom I approached. There were people for whom I had a violent and
                  instinctive aversion, whose presence in the room gave me a pain so positive that
                  it seemed almost physical, and others, again, to whom I was strongly attracted,
                  and whose presence near me filled me with agreeable sensations, of which I could
                  give no very definite account. For this reason, I suppose, the judgments which
                  different people formed concerning me varied extremely. Miss Mehitable, for
                  example, by whom I was strongly attracted, thought me one of the most amiable of
                  boys; while my poor Aunt Lois was certain I was one of the most trying children
                  that ever were born.</p>
               <p>My poor mother! I surely loved her, and yet her deficient vital force, her
                  continual sadness and discouragement, acted on my nerves as a constant weight and
                  distress, against which I blindly and instinctively struggled; while Aunt Lois's
                  very footstep on the stair seemed to rouse every nerve of combativeness in my
                  little body into a state of bristling tension. I remember that when I was about
                  six or seven years old I had the scarlet-fever, and Aunt Lois, who was a most
                  rampant and energetic sick-nurse, undertook to watch with me; but my cries and
                  resistance were so terrible that I was thought to be going deranged. Finally the
                  matter was adjusted by Sam Lawson's offering to take the place, upon which I
                  became perfectly tranquil, and resigned myself into his hands with the greatest
                  composure and decorum. Sam was to me, during my childhood, a guide, philosopher,
                  and friend. The lazy, easy, indefinite atmosphere of being that surrounded him was
                  to me like the haze of Indian summer over a landscape, and I delighted to bask in
                  it. Nothing about him was any more fixed than the wavering shadows<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000097"/> of clouds; he was a boundless world of narrative
                  and dreamy suggestion, tending to no point and having no end, and in it I
                  delighted. Sam, besides, had a partiality for all those haunts in which I took
                  pleasure. Near our house was the old town burying-ground, where reposed the bones
                  of generations of Indian sachems, elders, pastors, and teachers, converted from
                  the wild forests, who, Christianized and churched, died in the faith, and were
                  gathered into Christian burial. On its green hillocks I loved to sit and watch and
                  dream long after sundown or moon-rise, and fancy I saw bands of wavering shapes,
                  and hope that some one out of the crowd might have a smile of recognition or a
                  spiritual word for me.</p>
               <p>My mother and grandmother and Aunt Lois were horror-stricken by such propensities,
                  indicating neither more nor less than indefinite coughs and colds, with early
                  death in the rear; and however much in the way a little boy always seemed in those
                  times in the active paths of his elders, yet it was still esteemed a primary duty
                  to keep him in the world. "Horace, what do you go and sit in the graveyard for?"
                  would my grandmother say. "I should think you 'd be 'fraid something would 'pear
                  to you."</p>
               <p>"I want something to appear, grandmother."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, pshaw! no, you don't. What do you want to be so odd for? Don't you ever
                  say such things."</p>
               <p>Sam, however, was willing to aid and abet me in strolling and lounging anywhere
                  and at any hour, and lent a willing ear to my tales of what I saw, and had in his
                  capacious wallet a pendent story or a spiritual precedent for anything that I
                  could mention.</p>
               <p>On this night, after he had left me, I went to bed with my mind full of the
                  haunted house, and all that was to be hoped or feared from its exploration.
                  Whether this was the cause or not, the result was that Harvey appeared nearer and
                  more friendly than ever; and he held by his hand another boy, whose figure
                  appeared to me like a faintly discerned form in a mist. Sometimes the mist seemed
                  to waver and part, and I caught indistinct glimpses of bright yellow curls and
                  clear blue eyes, and then Harvey smiled and shook his head. When he began to
                  disappear pear, he said to me, "Good by"; and I felt an inward assurance that he
                  was about to leave me. I said my "Good by" aloud, and stretched out my hands.</p>
               <p>"Why, Horace, Horace!" said my mother, waking suddenly at the sound of my
                  voice,—"Horace, wake up; you 've been dreaming."</p>
               <p>I had not even been asleep, but I did not tell her so, and turning over, as I
                  usually did when the curtain fell over my dreamland, I was soon asleep. I was wide
                  awake with the earliest peep of dawn the next morning, and had finished dressing
                  myself before my mother awoke.</p>
               <p>Ours was an early household, and the brisk tap of Aunt Lois's footsteps, and the
                  rattling of chairs and dishes in the kitchen, showed that breakfast was in active
                  preparation.</p>
               <p>My grandfather's prediction with regard to my Uncle Eliakim proved only too
                  correct. The fact was, that the poor man lived always in the whirl of a perfect
                  Maelstrom of promises and engagements, which were constantly converging towards
                  every hour of his unoccupied time. His old wagon and horse both felt the effects
                  of such incessant activity, and such deficient care and attention as were
                  consequent upon it, and were at all times in a state of dilapidation. Therefore it
                  was that the next morning nine, ten, and eleven o'clock appeared, and no Uncle
                  Eliakim.</p>
               <p>Sam Lawson had for more than two hours been seated in an expectant attitude on our
                  doorstep; but as the sun shone warm, and he had a large mug of cider between his
                  hands, he appeared to enjoy his mind with great equanimity.</p>
               <p>Aunt Lois moved about the house with an air and manner of sharp contempt, which
                  exhibited itself even in the way she did her household tasks. She put down plates
                  as if she despised them, and laid sticks of wood on the fire with defiant thumps,
                  as much as to say that she knew some things that had got to be in time and place
                  if others were not; but she spake no word.</p>
               <p>Aunt Lois, as I have often said before, was a good Christian, and held it her duty
                  to govern her tongue. True, she said many sharp and bitter things; but nobody but
                  herself and her God knew how many more she would have said had she not reined<pb
                     n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7953-00000098"/> herself up in conscientious silence.
                  But never was there a woman whose silence could express more contempt and
                  displeasure than hers. You could feel it in the air about you, though she never
                  said a word. You could feel it in the rustle of her dress, in the tap of her heels
                  over the floor, in the occasional flash of her sharp, black eye. She was like a
                  thunder-cloud whose quiet is portentous, and from which you every moment expect a
                  flash or an explosion. This whole morning's excursion was contrary to her mind and
                  judgment,—an ill-advised, ill-judged, shiftless proceeding, and being entered on
                  in a way as shiftless.</p>
               <p>"What time do you suppose it is, mother?" she at last said to my grandmother, who
                  was busy in her buttery.</p>
               <p>"Massy, Lois! I dare n't look," called out my grandmother, who was apt to fall
                  behindhand of her desires in the amount of work she could bring to pass of a
                  morning. "I don't want to know."</p>
               <p>"Well, it's eleven o'clock," said Lois, relentlessly, "and no signs of Uncle
                  'Liakim yet; and there's Sam Lawson, I s'pose he's going to spend the day on our
                  doorstep."</p>
               <p>Sam Lawson looked after my Aunt Lois as she went out of the kitchen. "Lordy massy,
                  Horace, I would n't be so kind o' unreconciled as she is all the time for nothin'.
                  Now <emph>I</emph> might get into a fluster 'cause <emph>I</emph>'m kep' a
                  waitin', but I don't. I think it 's our duty to be willin' to wait quiet till
                  things come round; this 'ere 's a world where things can't be driv', and folks
                  must n't set their heart on havin' everything come out jes' so, 'cause ef they do
                  they 'll allers be in a stew, like Hepsy and Miss Lois there. Let 'em jest wait
                  quiet, and things allers do come round in the end as well or better 'n ef you
                  worried."</p>
               <p>And as if to illustrate and justify this train of thought, Uncle Eliakim's wagon
                  at this moment came round the corner of the street, driving at a distracted pace.
                  The good man came with such headlong speed and vivacity that his straw hat was
                  taken off by the breeze, and flew far behind him, and he shot up to our door, as
                  he usually did to that of the meeting-house, as if he were going to drive straight
                  in.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, Mr. Sheril," said Sam, "don't get out; I 'll get your hat. Horace,
                  you jest run and pick it up; that 's a good boy."</p>
               <p>I ran accordingly, but my uncle had sprung out as lively as an autumn grasshopper.
                  "I 've been through a sea of troubles this morning," he said. "I lent my waggin to
                  Jake Marshall yesterday afternoon, to take his wife a ride. I thought if Jake was
                  a mind to pay the poor woman any attention, I 'd help; but when he brought it back
                  last night, one of the bolts was broken, and the harness gave out in two
                  places."</p>
               <p>"Want to know?" said Sam, leisurely examining the establishment. "I think the
                  neighbors ought to subscribe to keep up your team, Mr. Sheril, for it 's free to
                  the hull on 'em."</p>
               <p>"And what thanks does he get?" said Aunt Lois, sharply. "Well, Uncle 'Liakim, it
                  's almost dinner-time."</p>
               <p>"I know it, I know it, I know it, Lois. But there 's been a lot o' things to do
                  this morning. Just as I got the waggin mended come Aunt Bathsheba Sawin's boy and
                  put me in mind that I promised to carry her corn to grind; and I had to stop and
                  take that round to mill; and then I remembered the pills that was to go to Hannah
                  Dexter—"</p>
               <p>"I dare say, and forty more things like it," said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"Well, jump in now," said Uncle Fly; "we 'll be over and back in no time."</p>
               <p>"You may as well put it off till after dinner now," said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"Could n't stop for that," said Uncle 'Liakim; "my afternoon is all full now. I
                  've got to be in twenty places before night." And away we rattled, while Aunt Lois
                  stood looking after us in silent, unutterable contempt.</p>
               <p>"Stop! stop! stop! Whoa! whoa!" said Uncle 'Liakim, drawing suddenly up. "There 's
                  that plaster for Widdah Peters, after all. I wonder if Lois would n't just run up
                  with it." By this time he had turned the horse, who ran, with his usual
                  straightforward, blind directness, in a right line, against the doorstep
                  again.</p>
               <p>"Well, what now?" said Aunt Lois, appearing at the door. "Why, Lois, I 've just
                  come back to tell you I forgot I promised<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7953-00000099"
                  /> ised to carry Widdah Peters that plaster for lumbago; could n't you just find
                  time to run up there with it?"</p>
               <p>"Well, give it to me," said Aunt Lois, with sharp precision, and an air of
                  desperate patience.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I will," said Uncle Fly, standing up and beginning a rapid search into
                  that series of pockets which form a distinguishing mark of masculine
                  habiliments,—searching with such hurried zeal that he really seemed intent on
                  tearing himself to pieces. "Here 't is!—no, pshaw, pshaw! that 's my handkerchief!
                  O, here!—pshaw, pshaw! Why, where is it? Did n't I put it in?—or did I—O, here it
                  is in my vest-pocket; no, though. Where a plague!" and Uncle Fly sprang from the
                  wagon and began his usual active round-and-round chase after himself, slapping his
                  pockets, now before and now behind, and whirling like a dancing dervis, while Aunt
                  Lois stood regarding him with stony composure.</p>
               <p>"If you <emph>could</emph> ever think where anything was, before you began to talk
                  about it, it would be an improvement," she said.</p>
               <p>"Well, fact is," said Uncle Eliakim, "now I think of it, Mis' Sheril made me
                  change my coat just as I came out, and that 's the whole on 't. You just run up,
                  Lois, and tell Mis' Sheril to send one of the boys down to Widdah Peters's with
                  the plaster she 'll find in the pocket,—right-hand side. Come now, get up."</p>
               <p>These last words were addressed, not to Aunt Lois, but to the horse, who, kept in
                  rather a hungry and craving state by his master's hurrying manner of life, had
                  formed the habit of sedulously improving every spare interval in catching at a
                  mouthful of anything to eat, and had been accordingly busy in cropping away a
                  fringe of very green grass that was growing up by the kitchen doorstep, from which
                  occupation he was remorselessly twitched up and started on an impetuous
                  canter.</p>
               <p>"Wal, now I hope we 're fairly started," said Sam Lawson; "and, Mr. Sheril, you
                  may as well, while you are about it, take the right road as the wrong one, 'cause
                  that 'ere saves time. It 's pleasant enough anywhere, to be sure, to-day; but when
                  a body 's goin' to a place, a body likes to get there, as it were."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, well," said Uncle Fly, "we 're on the right road, ain't we?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, so fur you be; but when you come out on the plains, you must take the fust
                  left-hand road that drives through the woods, and you may jest as well know as
                  much aforehand."</p>
               <p>"Much obliged to you," said my uncle. "I reely had n't thought particularly about
                  the way."</p>
               <p>"S'pose not," said Sam, composedly; "so it 's jest as well you took me along.
                  Lordy massy, there ain't a road nor a cart-path round Oldtown that I hain't been
                  over, time and time agin. I believe I could get through any on 'em the darkest
                  night that ever was hatched. Jake Marshall and me has been Indianing round these
                  'ere woods more times 'n you could count. It 's kind o' pleasant, a nice bright
                  day like this 'ere, to be a joggin' along in the woods. Everything so sort o'
                  still, ye know; and ye hear the chestnuts a droppin', and the wa'nuts. Jake and
                  me, last fall, went up by Widdah Peters's one day, and shuck them trees, and got
                  nigh about a good bushel o' wa'nuts. I used to kind o' like to crack 'em for the
                  young uns, nights, last winter, when Hepsy 'd let em sit up. Though she 's allers
                  for drivin' on 'em all off to bed, and makin' it kind o' solitary, Hepsy is." And
                  Sam concluded the conjugal allusion with a deep sigh.</p>
               <p>"Have you ever been into the grounds of the Dench house?" said Uncle Fly.</p>
               <p>"Wal, no, not reely; but Jake, he has; and ben into the house too. There was a
                  fellow named 'Biah Smith that used to be a kind o' servant to the next family that
                  come in after Lady Frankland went out, and he took Jake all over it once when
                  there wa' n't nobody there. 'Biah, he said that when Sir Harry lived there, there
                  was one room that was always kept shet up, and wa' n't never gone into, and in
                  that 'ere room there was the long red cloak, and the hat and sword, and all the
                  clothes he hed on when he was buried under the ruins in that 'ere earthquake. They
                  said that every year, when the day of the earthquake come round, Sir Harry used to
                  spend it a fastin' and prayin' in that 'ere room, all alone. 'Biah says that he
                  had talked with a fellow that was one of Sir Harry's body-servants, and he told
                  him that<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7953-00000100"/> Sir Harry used to come out o'
                  that 'ere room lookin' more like a ghost than a live man, when he' d fasted and
                  prayed for twenty-four hours there. Nobody knows what might have 'peared to him
                  there."</p>
               <p>I wondered much in my own quiet way at this story, and marvelled whether, in Sir
                  Harry's long, penitential watchings, he had seen the air of the room all tremulous
                  with forms and faces such as glided around me in my solitary hours.</p>
               <p>"Naow, you see," said Sam Lawson, "when the earthquake come, Sir Harry, he was a
                  driving with a court lady; and she, poor soul, went into 'tarnity in a
                  minit,—'thout a minit to prepare. And I 'spect there ain't no reason to s'pose but
                  what she was a poor, mis'able Roman Catholic. So her prospects could n't have been
                  noways encouragin'. And it must have borne on Sir Harry's mind to think she should
                  be took and he spared, when he was a cuttin' up just in the way he was. I should
                  n't wonder but she should 'pear to him. You know they say there is a woman in
                  white walks them grounds, and 'Biah, he says, as near as he can find out, it 's
                  that 'ere particular chamber as she allers goes to. 'Biah said he 'd seen her at
                  the windows a wringin' her hands and a cryin' fit to break her heart, poor soul.
                  Kind o' makes a body feel bad, 'cause, arter all, 't wa' n't her fault she was
                  born a Roman Catholic,—now was it?"</p>
               <p>The peculiarity of my own mental history had this effect on me from a child, that
                  it wholly took away from me all dread of the supernatural. A world of shadowy
                  forms had always been as much a part of my short earthly experience as the more
                  solid and tangible one of real people. I had just as quiet and natural a feeling
                  about one as the other. I had not the slightest doubt, on hearing Sam's story,
                  that the form of the white lady did tenant those deserted apartments; and so far
                  from feeling any chill or dread in the idea, I felt only a sort of curiosity to
                  make her acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Our way to the place wound through miles of dense forest. Sir Harry had chosen it,
                  as a retreat from the prying eyes and slanderous tongues of the world, in a region
                  of woodland solitude. And as we trotted leisurely under the bright scarlet and
                  yellow boughs of the forest, Uncle Eliakim and Sam discoursed of the traditions of
                  the place we were going to.</p>
               <p>"Who was it bought the place after Lady Frankland went to England?" said Uncle
                  Eliakim.</p>
               <p>"Wal, I believe 't was let a spell. There was some French folks hed it 'long
                  through the war. I heerd tell that they was pretty high people. I never could
                  quite make out when they went off; there was a good many stories round about it. I
                  did n't clearly make out how 't was, till Dench got it. Dench, you know, got his
                  money in a pretty peculiar way, ef all they says 's true."</p>
               <p>"How 's that?" said my uncle.</p>
               <p>"Wal, they do say he got the great carbuncle that was at the bottom of Sepaug
                  River. You 've heard about the great carbuncle, I s'pose?"</p>
               <p>"O, no! do pray tell me about it," said I, interrupting with fervor.</p>
               <p>"Why, did n't you never hear 'bout that? want to know. Wal, I 'll tell ye, then. I
                  know all 'bout it. Jake Marshall, he told me that Dench fust told him, and he got
                  it from old Mother Ketury, ye know,—a regelar old heathen Injun Ketury is,—and
                  folks do go so fur as to say that in the old times Ketury 'd 'a' ben took up for a
                  witch, though I never see no harm in her ways. Ef there be sperits, and we all
                  know there is, what's the harm o' Ketury 's seein' on 'em?"</p>
               <p>"Maybe she can't help seeing them," suggested I.</p>
               <p>"Jes' so, jes' so; that 'ere 's what I telled Jake when we 's a talkin' it over,
                  and he said he did n't like Dench's havin' so much to do with old Ketury. But la,
                  old Ketury could say the Lord's Prayer in Injun, cause I 've heard her; though she
                  would n't say it when she did n't want to and she would say it when she did,—jest
                  as the fit took her. But lordy massy, them wild Injuns, they ain't but jest half
                  folks, they 're so kind o' wild, and birchy and bushy as a body may say. Ef they
                  take religion at all, it's got to be in their own way. Ef you get the wild beast
                  all out o' one on 'em, there don't somehow seem to be enough left to make an
                  ordinary smart man of, so much on<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7953-00000101"/> 'em's
                  wild. Anyhow, Dench, he was thick with Ketury, and she told him all about the gret
                  carbuncle, and gin him directions how to get it."</p>
               <p>"But I don't know what a great carbuncle is," I interrupted.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, boy, did n't you never read in your Bible about the New Jerusalem,
                  and the precious stones in the foundation, that shone like the sun? Wal, the
                  carbuncle was one on 'em."</p>
               <p>"Did it fall down out of heaven into the river?" said I.</p>
               <p>"Mebbe," said Sam. "At any rate Ketury, she told 'em what they had to do to get
                  it. They had to go out arter it jest exactly at twelve o'clock at night, when the
                  moon was full. You was to fast all the day before, and go fastin', and say the
                  Lord's Prayer in Injun afore you went; and when you come to where 't was, you was
                  to dive after it. But there wa' n't to be a word spoke; if there was, it went
                  right off."</p>
               <p>"What did they have to say the prayer in Indian for?" said I.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, boy, I s'pose 't was 'cause 't was Indian sperits kep' a watch over
                  it. Any rate 't was considerable of a pull on 'em, 'cause Ketury, she had to teach
                  'em; and she wa' n't allers in the sperit on 't. Sometimes she's crosser 'n
                  torment, Ketury is. Dench, he gin her fust and last as much as ten dollars,—so
                  Jake says. However, they got all through with it, and then come a moonlight night,
                  and they went out. Jake says it was the splendidest moonlight ye ever did see,—all
                  jest as still,—only the frogs and the turtles kind o' peepin'; and they did n't
                  say a word, and rowed out past the pint there, where the water 's ten feet deep,
                  and he looked down and see it a shinin' on the bottom like a great star, making
                  the waters all light like a lantern. Dench, he dived for it, Jake said; and he saw
                  him put his hand right on it; and he was so tickled, you know, to see he 'd got
                  it, that he could n't help hollerin' right out, "There, you got it!" and it was
                  gone. Dench was mad enough to 'a' killed him; 'cause, when it goes that'ere way,
                  you can't see it agin for a year and a day. But two or three years arter, all of a
                  sudden, Dench, he seemed to kind o' spruce up and have a deal o' money to spend.
                  He said an uncle had died and left it to him in England; but Jake Marshall says
                  you 'll never take him in that 'ere way. He says he thinks it's no better 'n
                  witchcraft, getting money that 'ere way. Ye see Jake was to have had half if they
                  'd 'a' got it, and not gettin' nothin' kind o' sot him to thinkin' on it in a
                  moral pint o' view, ye know.—But, lordy massy, where be we, Mr. Sheril? This
                  'ere's the second or third time we've come round to this 'ere old dead chestnut.
                  We ain't makin' no progress."</p>
               <p>In fact there were many and crossing cart-paths through this forest, which had
                  been worn by different farmers of the vicinity in going after their yearly supply
                  of wood; and, notwithstanding Sam's assertion of superior knowledge in these
                  matters, we had, in the negligent inattention of his narrative, become involved in
                  this labyrinth, and driven up and down, and back and forward, in the wood, without
                  seeming at all to advance upon our errand.</p>
               <p>"Wal, I declare for 't, I never did see nothing beat it," said Sam. "We 've been
                  goin' jest round and round for this hour or more, and come out again at exactly
                  the same place. I 've heerd of places that's kep' hid, and folks allers gets sort
                  o' struck blind and confused that undertakes to look 'em up. Wal, I don't say I
                  believe in sich stories, but this 'ere is curous. Why, I 'd 'a' thought I could
                  'a' gone straight to it blindfolded, any day. Ef Jake Marshall was here, he'd go
                  straight to it."</p>
               <p>"Well, Sam," said Uncle Eliakim, "it's maybe because you and me got so interested
                  in telling stories that we've missed the way."</p>
               <p>"That 'ere 's it, 'thout a doubt," said Sam. "Now I 'll just hush up, and kind o'
                  concentrate my 'tention. I 'll just git out and walk a spell, and take an
                  observation."</p>
               <p>The result of this improved attention to the material facts of the case was, that
                  we soon fell into a road that seemed to wind slowly up a tract of rising ground,
                  and to disclose to our view, through an interlacing of distant boughs, the western
                  horizon, toward which the sun was now sinking with long, level beams. We had been
                  such a time in our wanderings, that there seemed a prospect of night setting in
                  before we should be through with our errand and ready to return.</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7953-00000102"/>
               <p>"The house stan's on the top of a sort o' swell o' ground," said Sam; "and as nigh
                  as I can make it out, it must be somewhere about there."</p>
               <p>"There is a woman a little way before us," said I; "why don't you ask her?"</p>
               <p>I saw very plainly in a turn of the road a woman whose face was hidden by a
                  bonnet, who stood as if waiting for us. It was not the white woman of ghostly
                  memory, but apparently a veritable person in the every-day habiliments of common
                  life, who stood as if waiting for us.</p>
               <p>"I don't see no woman," said Sam; "where is she?"</p>
               <p>I pointed with my finger, but as I did so the form melted away. I remember
                  distinctly the leaves of the trees back of it appearing through it as through a
                  gauze veil, and then it disappeared entirely.</p>
               <p>"There is n't any woman that I can see," said Uncle Eliakim, briskly. "The
                  afternoon sun must have got into your eyes, boy."</p>
               <p>I had been so often severely checked and reproved for stating what I saw, that I
                  now determined to keep silence, whatever might appear to me. At a little distance
                  before us the road forked, one path being steep and craggy, and the other easier
                  of ascent, and apparently going in much the same general direction. A little in
                  advance, in the more rugged path, stood the same female form. Her face was hidden
                  by a branch of a tree, but she beckoned to us. "Take <emph>that</emph> path, Uncle
                  'Liakim," said I; "it's the right one."</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy," said Sam Lawson, "how in the world should you know that? That 'ere
                  is the shortest road to the Dench house, and the other leads away from it."</p>
               <p>I kept silence as to my source of information, and still watched the figure. As we
                  passed it, I saw a beautiful face with a serene and tender expression, and her
                  hands were raised as if in blessing. I looked back earnestly and she was gone.</p>
               <p>A few moments after, we were in the grounds of the place, and struck into what had
                  formerly been the carriage way, though now overgrown with weeds, and here and
                  there with a jungle of what was once well-kept ornamental shrubbery. A tree had
                  been uprooted by the late tempest, and blown down across the road, and we had to
                  make quite a little detour to avoid it.</p>
               <p>"Now how are we to get into this house?" said Uncle Eliakim. "No doubt it's left
                  fastened up."</p>
               <p>"Do you see <emph>that?</emph>" said Sam Lawson, who had been gazing steadily
                  upward at the chimneys of the house, with his eyes shaded by one of his great
                  hands. "Look at that smoke from the middle chimbly."</p>
               <p>"There 's somebody in the house, to be sure," said Uncle Eliakim; "suppose we
                  knock at the front door here?"—and with great briskness, suiting the action to the
                  word, he lifted the black serpent knocker, and gave such a rat tat tat as must
                  have roused all the echoes of the old house, while Sam Lawson and I stood by him,
                  expectant, on the front steps.</p>
               <p>Sam then seated himself composedly on a sort of bench which was placed under the
                  shadow of the porch, and awaited the result with the contentment of a man of
                  infinite leisure. Uncle Eliakim, however, felt pressed for time, and therefore
                  gave another long and vehement rap. Very soon a chirping of childish voices was
                  heard behind the door, and a pattering of feet; there appeared to be a sort of
                  consultation.</p>
               <p>"There they be now," said Sam Lawson, "jest as I told you."</p>
               <p>"Please go round to the back door," said a childish voice; "this is locked, and I
                  can't open it."</p>
               <p>We all immediately followed Sam Lawson, who took enormous strides over the
                  shrubbery, and soon I saw the vision of a curly-headed, blue-eyed boy holding open
                  the side door of the house.</p>
               <p>I ran up to him. "Are you Harvey?" I said.</p>
               <p>"No," he answered; "my name is n't Harvey, it's Harry; and this is my sister
                  Tina,"—and immediately a pair of dark eyes looked out over his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Well, we 've come to take you to my grandmother's house," said I.</p>
               <p>I don't know how it was, but I always spoke of our domestic establishment under
                  the style and title of the female ruler. It was grandmother's house.</p>
               <p>"I am glad of it," said the boy, "for we have tried two or<pb n="196-197"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000103"/> three times to find our way to Oldtown, and got
                  lost in the woods and had to come back here again."</p>
               <p>Here the female partner in the concern stepped a little forward, eager for her
                  share in the conversation. "Do you know old Sol?" she said.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, I do," said Sam Lawson, quite delighted at this verification of the
                  identity of the children. "Yes, I see him only day afore yesterday, and he was
                  'quirin' arter you, and we thought we 'd find you over in this 'ere house, 'cause
                  I 'd seen smoke a comin' out o' the chimblies. Had a putty good time in the old
                  house, I reckon. Ben all over it pretty much, hain't ye?"</p>
               <p>"O yes," said Tina; "and it's such a strange old place,—a great big house with
                  ever so many rooms in it!"</p>
               <p>"Wal, we 'll jest go over it, being as we 're here," said Sam; and into it we all
                  went.</p>
               <p>Now there was nothing in the world that little Miss Tina took more native delight
                  in than in playing the hostess. To entertain was her dearest instinct, and she
                  hastened with all speed to open before us all in the old mansion that her own
                  rummaging and investigating talents had brought to light, chattering meanwhile
                  with the spirit of a bobolink.</p>
               <p>"You don't know," she said to Sam Lawson, "what a curious little closet there is
                  in here, with book-cases and drawers, and a looking-glass in the door, with a
                  curtain over it."</p>
               <p>"Want to know?" said Sam. "Wal, that 'ere does beat all. It's some of them old
                  English folks's grander, I s'pose."</p>
               <p>"And here's a picture of such a beautiful lady, that always looks at you,
                  whichever way you go,—just see."</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, so 't does. Wal, now, them drawers, mebbe, have got curous things in
                  'em," suggested Sam.</p>
               <p>"O yes, but Harry never would let me look in them. I tried, though, once, when
                  Harry was gone; but, if you 'll believe me, they 're all locked."</p>
               <p>"Want to know?" said Sam. "That 'ere 's a kind o' pity, now."</p>
               <p>"Would <emph>you</emph> open them? You would n't, would you?" said the little one,
                  turning suddenly round and opening her great wide eyes full on him. "Harry said
                  the place was n't ours, and it would n't be proper."</p>
               <p>"Wal, he's a nice boy; quite right in him. Little folks must n't touch things that
                  ain't theirn," said Sam, who was strong on the moralities; though, after all, when
                  all the rest had left the apartment, I looked back and saw him giving a sly tweak
                  to the drawers of the cabinet on his own individual account.</p>
               <p>"I was just a makin' sure, you know, that 't was all safe," he said, as he caught
                  my eye, and saw that he was discovered.</p>
               <p>Sam revelled and expatiated, however, in the information that lay before him in
                  the exploration of the house. No tourist with Murray's guide-book in hand, and
                  with travels to prepare for publication, ever went more patiently through the
                  doing of a place. Not a door was left closed that could be opened; not a passage
                  unexplored. Sam's head came out dusty and cobwebby between the beams of the
                  ghostly old garret, where mouldy relics of antique furniture were reposing, and
                  disappeared into the gloom of the spacious cellars, where the light was as
                  darkness. He found none of the marks of the traditional haunted room; but he
                  prolonged the search till there seemed a prospect that poor Uncle Eliakim would
                  have to get him away by physical force, if we meant to get home in time for
                  supper.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lawson, you don't seem to remember we have n't any of us had a morsel of
                  dinner, and the sun is actually going down. The folks 'll be concerned about us.
                  Come, let's take the children and be off."</p>
               <p>And so we mounted briskly into the wagon, and the old horse, vividly impressed
                  with the idea of barn and hay at the end of his toils, seconded the vigorous
                  exertions of Uncle Fly, and we rattled and spun on our homeward career, and
                  arrived at the farmhouse a little after moonrise.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">TINA'S ADOPTION.</head>
               <p>DURING the time of our journey to the enchanted ground, my Aunt Lois, being a
                  woman of business, who always knew precisely what she was about, had contrived not
                  only to finish meritoriously her household tasks, and to supplement Uncle
                  Eliakim's forgetful benevolence, but also to make a call on Miss Mehitable
                  Rossiter, for the sake of unburdening to her her oppressed heart. For Miss
                  Mehitable bore in our family circle the repute of being a woman of counsel and
                  sound wisdom. The savor of ministerial stock being yet strong about her, she was
                  much resorted to for advice in difficult cases.</p>
               <p>"I don't object, of course, to doing for the poor and orphaned, and all that,"
                  said Aunt Lois, quite sensibly; "but I like to see folks seem to know what they
                  are doing, and where they are going, and not pitch and tumble into things without
                  asking what's to come of them. Now, we'd just got Susy and the two boys on our
                  hands, and here will come along a couple more children to-night; and I must say I
                  don't see what's to be done with them."</p>
               <p>"It's a pity you don't take snuff," said Miss Mehitable, with a whimsical grimace.
                  "Now, when I come to any of the cross-places of life, where the road is n't very
                  clear, I just take a pinch of snuff and wait; but as you don't, just stay and get
                  a cup of tea with me, in a quiet, Christian way, and after it we will walk round
                  to your mother's and look at these children."</p>
               <p>Aunt Lois was soothed in her perturbed spirit by this proposition; and it was
                  owing to this that, when we arrived at home, long after dark, we found Miss
                  Mehitable in the circle around the blazing kitchen fire. The table was still
                  standing, with ample preparations for an evening meal,—a hot smoking loaf of
                  rye-and-Indian bread, and a great platter of cold boiled beef and pork, garnished
                  with cold potatoes and turnips, the sight of which, to a party who had had no
                  dinner all day, was most appetizing.</p>
               <p>My grandmother's reception of the children was as motherly as if they had been of
                  her own blood. In fact, their beauty and evident gentle breeding won for them
                  immediate favor in all eyes.</p>
               <p>The whole party sat down to the table, and, after a long and somewhat scattering
                  grace, pronounced by Uncle Eliakim, fell to with a most amazing appearance of
                  enjoyment. Sam's face waxed luminous as he buttered great blocks of smoking brown
                  bread with the fruits of my grandmother's morning churning, and refreshed himself
                  by long and hearty pulls at the cider-mug.</p>
               <p>"I tell <emph>you,</emph>" he said, "when folks hes been a ridin' on an empty
                  stomach ever since breakfast, victuals is victuals; we learn how to be thankful
                  for 'em; so I 'll take another slice o' that 'ere beef, and one or two more cold
                  potatoes, and the vinegar, Mr. Sheril. Wal, chillen, this ere 's better than bein'
                  alone in that'ere old house, ain't it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," piped Tina; "I had begun to be quite discouraged. We tried and
                  tried to find our way to Oldtown, and always got lost in the woods." Seeing that
                  this remark elicited sympathy in the listeners, she added, "I was afraid we should
                  die there, and the robins would have to cover us up, like some children papa used
                  to tell about."</p>
               <p>"Poor babes! just hear 'em," said my grandmother, who seemed scarcely able to
                  restrain herself from falling on the necks of the children, in the ardor of her
                  motherly kindness, while she doubled up an imaginary fist at Miss Asphyxia Smith,
                  and longed to give her a piece of her mind touching her treatment of them.</p>
               <p>Harry remained modestly silent; but he and I sat together, and our eyes met every
                  now and then with that quiet amity to which I had been accustomed in my spiritual
                  friend. I felt a cleaving of spirit to him that I had never felt towards any human
                  being before,—a certainty that something had come to me in him that I had always
                  been wanting,—and I was too glad for speech.</p>
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7953-00000105"/>
               <p>He was one of those children who retreat into themselves and make a shield of
                  quietness and silence in the presence of many people, while Tina, on the other
                  hand, was electrically excited, waxed brilliant in color, and rattled and
                  chattered with as fearless confidence as a cat-bird.</p>
               <p>"Come hither to me, little maiden," said Miss Mehitable, with a whimsical air of
                  authority, when the child had done her supper. Tina came to her knee, and looked
                  up into the dusky, homely face, in that still, earnest fashion in which children
                  seem to study older people.</p>
               <p>"Well, how do you like me?" said Miss Mehitable, when this silent survey had
                  lasted an appreciable time.</p>
               <p>The child still considered attentively, looking long into the great, honest, open
                  eyes, and then her face suddenly rippled and dimpled all over like a brook when a
                  sunbeam strikes it. "I do like you. I think you are good," she said, putting out
                  her hands impulsively.</p>
               <p>"Then up you come," said Miss Mehitable, lifting her into her lap. "It's well you
                  like me, because, for aught you know, I may be an old fairy; and if I did n't like
                  you, I might turn you into a mouse or a cricket. Now how would you like that?"</p>
               <p>"You could n't do it," said Tina, laughing.</p>
               <p>"How do you know I could n't?"</p>
               <p>"Well, if you did turn me into a mouse, I 'd gnaw your knitting-work," said Tina,
                  laying hold of Miss Mehitable's knitting. "You 'd be glad to turn me back
                  again."</p>
               <p>"Heyday! I must take care how I make a mouse of you, I see. Perhaps I 'll make you
                  into a kitten."</p>
               <p>"Well, I 'd like to be a kitten, if you 'll keep a ball for me to play with, and
                  give me plenty of milk," said Tina, to whom no proposition seemed to be without
                  possible advantages.</p>
               <p>"Will you go home and live with me, and be my kitten?"</p>
               <p>Tina had often heard her brother speak of finding a good woman who should take
                  care of her; and her face immediately became grave at this proposal. She seemed to
                  study Miss Mehitable in a new way. "Where do you live?" she said.</p>
               <p>"O, my house is only a little way from here."</p>
               <p>"And may Harry come to see me?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly he may."</p>
               <p>"Do you want me to work for you all the time?" said Tina; "because," she added, in
                  a low voice, "I like to play sometimes, and Miss Asphyxia said that was
                  wicked."</p>
               <p>"Did n't I tell you I wanted you for my little white kitten," said Miss Mehitable,
                  with an odd twinkle. "What work do you suppose kittens do?"</p>
               <p>"Must I grow up and catch rats?" said the child.</p>
               <p>"Certainly you will be likely to," said Miss Mehitable, solemnly. "I shall pity
                  the poor rats when you are grown up."</p>
               <p>Tina looked in the humorous, twinkling old face with a gleam of mischievous
                  comprehension, and, throwing her arms around Miss Mehitable, said, "Yes, I like
                  you, and I will be your kitten."</p>
               <p>There was a sudden, almost convulsive pressure of the little one to the kind old
                  breast, and Miss Mehitable's face wore a strange expression, that looked like the
                  smothered pang of some great anguish blended with a peculiar tenderness. One
                  versed in the reading of spiritual histories might have seen that, at that moment,
                  some inner door of that old heart opened, not without a grating of pain, to give a
                  refuge to the little orphan; but opened it was, and a silent inner act of adoption
                  had gone forth. Miss Mehitable beckoned my grandmother and Aunt Lois into a corner
                  of the fireplace by themselves, while Sam Lawson was entertaining the rest of the
                  circle by reciting the narrative of our day's explorations.</p>
               <p>"Now I suppose I 'm about as fit to undertake to bring up a child as the old
                  Dragon of Wantley," said Miss Mehitable; "but as you seem to have a surplus on
                  your hands, I 'm willing to take the girl and do what I can for her."</p>
               <p>"Dear Miss Mehitable, what a mercy it 'll be to her!" said my grandmother and Aunt
                  Lois, simultaneously;—"if you feel that you can afford it," added Aunt Lois,
                  considerately.</p>
               <p>"Well, the fowls of the air and the lilies of the field are taken care of somehow,
                  as we are informed," said Miss Mehitable. "My basket and store are not much to ask
                  a blessing on, but I have a<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7953-00000106"/> sort of
                  impression that an orphan child will make it none the less likely to hold
                  out."</p>
               <p>"There 'll always be a handful of meal in the barrel and a little oil in the cruse
                  for you, I 'm sure," said my grandmother; "the word of the Lord stands sure for
                  that."</p>
               <p>A sad shadow fell over Miss Mehitable's face at these words, and then the usual
                  expression of quaint humor stole over it. "It's to be hoped that Polly will take
                  the same view of the subject that you appear to," said she. "My authority over
                  Polly is, you know, of an extremely nominal kind."</p>
               <p>"Still," said my grandmother, "you must be mistress in your own house. Polly, I am
                  sure, knows her duty to you."</p>
               <p>"Polly's idea of allegiance is very much like that of the old Spanish nobles to
                  their king; it used to run somewhat thus: 'We, who are every way as good as you
                  are, promise obedience to your government if you maintain our rights and
                  liberties, but if not, not.' Now Polly's ideas of 'rights and liberties' are of a
                  very set and particular nature, and I have found her generally disposed to make a
                  good fight for them. Still, after all," she added, "the poor old thing loves me,
                  and I think will be willing to indulge me in having a doll, if I really am set
                  upon it. The only way I can carry my point with Polly is, to come down on her with
                  a perfect avalanche of certainty, and so I have passed my word to you that I will
                  be responsible for this child. Polly may scold and fret for a fortnight; but she
                  is too good a Puritan to question whether people shall keep their promises. Polly
                  abhors covenant-breaking with all her soul, and so in the end she will have to
                  help me through."</p>
               <p>"It's a pretty child," said my grandmother, "and an engaging one, and Polly may
                  come to liking her."</p>
               <p>"There 's no saying," said Miss Mehitable. "You never know what you may find in
                  the odd corners of an old maid's heart, when you fairly look into them. There are
                  often unused hoards of maternal affection enough to set up an orphan-asylum; but
                  it's like iron filings and a magnet,—you must try them with a live child, and if
                  there is anything in 'em you find it out. That little object," she said, looking
                  over her shoulder at Tina, "made an instant commotion in the dust and rubbish of
                  my forlorn old garret, and brought to light a deal that I thought had gone to the
                  moles and the bats long ago. She will do me good, I can feel, with her little
                  pertnesses and her airs and fancies. If you could know how chilly and lonesome an
                  old house gets sometimes, particularly in autumn, when the equinoctial storm is
                  brewing! A lively child is a godsend, even if she turns the whole house
                  topsy-turvy."</p>
               <p>"Well, a child can't always be a plaything," said Aunt Lois; "it's a solemn and
                  awful responsibility."</p>
               <p>"And if I don't take it, who will?" said Miss Mehitable, gravely. "If a better one
                  would, I would n't. I 've no great confidence in myself. I profess no skill in
                  human cobbling. I can only give house-room and shelter and love, and let come what
                  will come. 'A man cannot escape what is written on his forehead,' the Turkish
                  proverb says, and this poor child's history is all forewritten."</p>
               <p>"The Lord will bless you for your goodness to the orphan," said my
                  grandmother.</p>
               <p>"I don't know about its being goodness. I take a fancy to her. I hunger for the
                  child. There's no merit in wanting your bit of cake, and maybe taking it when it
                  is n't good for you; but let's hope all's well that ends well. Since I have fairly
                  claimed her for mine, I begin to feel a fierce right of property in her, and you
                  'd see me fighting like an old hen with anybody that should try to get her away
                  from me. You 'll see me made an old fool of by her smart little ways and speeches;
                  and I already am proud of her beauty. Did you ever see a brighter little
                  minx?"</p>
               <p>We looked across to the other end of the fireplace, where Miss Tina sat perched,
                  with great contentment, on Sam Lawson's knee, listening with wide-open eyes to the
                  accounts he was giving of the haunted house. The beautiful hair that Miss Asphyxia
                  had cut so close had grown with each day, till now it stood up in half rings of
                  reddish gold, through which the fire shone with a dancing light; and her great
                  eyes seemed to radiate brightness from as many points as a diamond.</p>
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7953-00000107"/>
               <p>"Depend upon it, those children are of good blood," said Miss Mehitable,
                  decisively. "You 'll never make me believe that they will not be found to belong
                  in some way to some reputable stock."</p>
               <p>"Well, we know nothing about their parents," said my grandmother, "except what we
                  heard second-hand through Sam Lawson. It was a wandering woman, sick and a
                  stranger, who was taken down and died in Old Crab Smith's house, over in
                  Need-more."</p>
               <p>"One can tell, by the child's manner of speaking, that she has been brought up
                  among educated people," said Miss Mehitable. "She is no little rustic. The boy,
                  too, looks of the fine clay of the earth. But it's time for me to take little Miss
                  Rattlebrain home with me, and get her into bed. Sleep is a gracious state for
                  children, and the first step in my new duties is a plain one." So saying, Miss
                  Mehitable rose, and, stepping over to the other side of the fireplace, tapped Tina
                  lightly on the shoulder. "Come, Pussy," she said, "get your bonnet, and we will go
                  home."</p>
               <p>Harry, who had watched all the movements between Miss Mehitable and his sister
                  with intense interest, now stepped forward, blushing very much, but still with a
                  quaint little old-fashioned air of manliness. "Is my sister going to live with
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"So we have agreed, my little man," said Miss Mehitable. "I hope you have no
                  objection?"</p>
               <p>"Will you let me come and see her sometimes?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; you will always be quite welcome."</p>
               <p>"I want to see her sometimes, because my mother left her under my care. I sha' n't
                  have a great deal of time to come in the daytime, because I must work for my
                  living," he said, "but a little while sometimes at night, if you would let
                  me."</p>
               <p>"And what do you work at?" said Miss Mehitable, surveying the delicate boy with an
                  air of some amusement.</p>
               <p>"I used to pick up potatoes, and fodder the cattle, and do a great many things;
                  and I am growing stronger every day, and by and by can do a great deal more."</p>
               <p>"Well said, sonny," said my grandfather, laying his hand on Harry's head. "You
                  speak like a smart boy. We can have you down to help tend sawmill."</p>
               <p>"I wonder how many more boys will be wanted to help tend sawmill," said Aunt
                  Lois.</p>
               <p>"Well, good night, all," said Miss Mehitable, starting to go home.</p>
               <p>Tina, however, stopped and left her side, and threw her arms round Harry's neck
                  and kissed him. "Good night now. You 'll come and see me to-morrow," she said.</p>
               <p>"May I come too?" I said, almost before I thought.</p>
               <p>"O, certainly, do come," said Tina, with that warm, earnest light in her eyes
                  which seemed the very soul of hospitality. "<emph>She</emph> 'll like to have you,
                  I know."</p>
               <p>"The child is taking possession of the situation at once," said Miss Mehitable.
                  "Well, Brighteyes, you may come too," she added, to me. "A precious row there will
                  be among the old books when you all get together there";—and Miss Mehitable, with
                  the gay, tripping figure by her side, left the room.</p>
               <p>"Is this great, big, dark house yours?" said the child, as they came under the
                  shadow of a dense thicket of syringas and lilacs that overhung the front of the
                  house.</p>
               <p>"Yes, this is Doubting Castle," said Miss Mehitable.</p>
               <p>"And does Giant Despair live here?" said Tina. "Mamma showed me a picture of him
                  once in a book."</p>
               <p>"Well, he has tried many times to take possession," said Miss Mehitable, "but I do
                  what I can to keep him out, and you must help me."</p>
               <p>Saying this she opened the door of a large, old-fashioned room, that appeared to
                  have served both the purposes of a study and parlor. It was revealed to view by
                  the dusky, uncertain glimmer of a wood fire that had burned almost down on a pair
                  of tall brass andirons. The sides of the room were filled to the ceiling with
                  book-cases full of books. Some dark portraits of men and women were duskily
                  revealed by the flickering light, as well as a wide, ample-bosomed chintz sofa and
                  a great chintz-covered easy-chair. A table draped with a green cloth stood in a
                  corner by the fire, strewn over with books and writing-materials, and sustaining a
                  large work-basket.</p>
               <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7953-00000108"/>
               <p>"How dark it is!" said the child.</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable took a burning splinter of the wood, and lighted a candle in a
                  tall, plated candlestick, that stood on the high, narrow mantel-piece over the
                  fireplace. At this moment a side door opened, and a large-boned woman, dressed in
                  a homespun stuff petticoat, with a short, loose sack of the same material,
                  appeared at the door. Her face was freckled; her hair, of a carroty-yellow, was
                  plastered closely to her head and secured by a horn comb; her eyes were so sharp
                  and searching, that, as she fixed them on Tina, she blinked involuntarily. Around
                  her neck she wore a large string of gold beads, the brilliant gleam of which,
                  catching the firelight, revealed itself at once to Tina's eye, and caused her to
                  regard the woman with curiosity.</p>
               <p>She appeared to have opened the door with an intention of asking a question; but
                  stopped and surveyed the child with a sharp expression of not very well-pleased
                  astonishment. "I thought you spoke to me," she said, at last, to Miss
                  Mehitable.</p>
               <p>"You may warm my bed now, Polly," said Miss Mehitable; "I shall be ready to go up
                  in a few moments."</p>
               <p>Polly stood a moment more, as if awaiting some communication about the child; but
                  as Miss Mehitable turned away, and appeared to be busying herself about the fire,
                  Polly gave a sudden windy dart from the room, and closed the door with a bang that
                  made the window-casings rattle.</p>
               <p>"Why, what did she do that for?" said Tina.</p>
               <p>"O, it's Polly's way; she does everything with all her might," said Miss
                  Mehitable.</p>
               <p>"Don't she like <emph>me?</emph>" said the child.</p>
               <p>"Probably not. She knows nothing about you, and she does not like new things."</p>
               <p>"But won't she <emph>ever</emph> like me?" persisted Tina.</p>
               <p>"<emph>That</emph>, my dear, will depend in a great degree on yourself. If she
                  sees that you are good and behave well, she will probably end by liking you; but
                  old people like her are afraid that children will meddle with their things, and
                  get them out of place."</p>
               <p>"I mean to be good," said Tina, resolutely. "When I lived with Miss Asphyxia, I
                  wanted to be bad, I tried to be bad; but now I am changed. I mean to be good,
                  because you are good to me," and the child laid her head confidingly in Miss
                  Mehitable's lap.</p>
               <p>The dearest of all flattery to the old and uncomely is this caressing, confiding
                  love of childhood, and Miss Mehitable felt a glow of pleasure about her dusky old
                  heart at which she really wondered. "Can anything so fair really love
                     <emph>me?</emph>" she asked herself. Alas! how much of this cheap-bought
                  happiness goes to waste daily! While unclaimed children grow up loveless, men and
                  women wither in lonely, craving solitude.</p>
               <p>Polly again appeared at the door. "Your bed 's all warm, and you 'd better go
                  right up, else what's the use of warming it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I 'll come immediately," said Miss Mehitable, endeavoring steadfastly to
                  look as if she did not see Polly's looks, and to act as if there had of course
                  always been a little girl to sleep with her.</p>
               <p>"Come, my little one." <emph>My</emph> little one! Miss Mehitable's heart gave a
                  great throb at this possessive pronoun. It all seemed as strange to her as a
                  dream. A few hours ago, and she sat in the old windy, lonesome house, alone with
                  the memories of dead friends, and feeling herself walking to the grave in a dismal
                  solitude. Suddenly she awoke as from a dark dream, and found herself sole
                  possessor of beauty, youth, and love, in a glowing little form, all her own, with
                  no mortal to dispute it. She had a mother's right in a child. She might have a
                  daughter's love. The whole house seemed changed. The dreary, lonesome great hall,
                  with its tall, solemn-ticking clock, the wide, echoing staircase, up which Miss
                  Mehitable had crept, shivering and alone, so many sad nights, now gave back the
                  chirpings of Tina's rattling gayety and the silvery echoes of her laugh, as, happy
                  in her new lot, she danced up the stairway, stopping to ask eager questions on
                  this and that, as anything struck her fancy. For Miss Tina had one of those
                  buoyant, believing natures, born to ride always on the very top crest of every
                  wave,—one fully disposed to accept of good fortune in all its length and breadth,
                  and to make the most of it at once.</p>
               <p>"This is <emph>our</emph> home," she said, "is n't it?'</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7953-00000109"/>
               <p>"Yes, darling," said Miss Mehitable, catching her in her arms fondly; "it is
                     <emph>our</emph> home; we will have good times here together."</p>
               <p>Tina threw her arms around Miss Mehitable's neck and kissed her. "I'm so glad!
                  Harry said that God would find us a home as soon as it was best, and now here it
                  comes."</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable set the child down by the side of a great dark wooden bedstead,
                  with tall, carved posts, draped with curious curtains of India linen, where
                  strange Oriental plants and birds, and quaint pagodas and figures in turbans, were
                  all mingled together, like the phantasms in a dream. Then going to a tall chest of
                  drawers, resplendent with many brass handles, which reached almost to the ceiling,
                  she took a bunch of keys from her pocket and unlocked a drawer. A spasm as of pain
                  passed over her face as she opened it, and her hands trembled with some suppressed
                  emotion as she took up and laid down various articles, searching for something. At
                  last she found what she wanted, and shook it out. It was a child's nightgown, of
                  just the size needed by Tina. It was yellow with age, but made with dainty care.
                  She sat down by the child and began a movement towards undressing her.</p>
               <p>"Shall I say my prayers to you," said Tina, "before I go to bed?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said Miss Mehitable; "by all means."</p>
               <p>"They are rather long," said the child, apologetically,—"that is, if I say all
                  that Harry does. Harry said mamma wanted us to say them all every night. It takes
                  some time."</p>
               <p>"O, by all means say all," said Miss Mehitable.</p>
               <p>Tina kneeled down by her and put her hands in hers, and said the Lord's Prayer,
                  and the psalm, "The Lord is my shepherd." She had a natural turn for elocution,
                  this little one, and spoke her words with a grace and an apparent understanding
                  not ordinary in childhood.</p>
               <p>"There 's a hymn, besides," she said. "It belongs to the prayer."</p>
               <p>"Well, let us have that," said Miss Mehitable.</p>
               <p>Tina repeated,—<q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"One there is above all others</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Well deserves the name of Friend;</l>
                        <l>His is love beyond a brother's,</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>She had an earnest, half-heroic way of repeating, and as she gazed into her
                  listener's eyes she perceived, by a subtile instinct, that what she was saying
                  affected her deeply. She stopped, wondering.</p>
               <p>"Go on, my love," said Miss Mehitable.</p>
               <p>Tina continued, with enthusiasm, feeling that she was making an impression on her
                  auditor:— <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"O my child, where did you learn that hymn?" said Miss Mehitable, to whom the
                  words were new. Simple and homely as they were, they had struck on some inner
                  nerve, which was vibrating with intense feeling. Tears were standing in her
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"It was mamma's hymn," said Tina. "She always used to say it. There is one more
                  verse," she added. <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">

                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Is that the secret of all earthly sorrow, then?" said Miss Mehitable aloud, in
                  involuntary soliloquy. The sound of her own voice seemed to startle her. She
                  sighed deeply, and kissed the child. "Thank you, my darling. It does me good to
                  hear you," she said.</p>
               <p>The child had entered so earnestly, so passionately even, into the spirit of the
                  words she had been repeating, that she seemed to Miss Mehitable to be transfigured
                  into an angel messenger, sent to inspire faith in God's love in a darkened,
                  despairing soul<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7953-00000110"/> She put her into bed;
                  but Tina immediately asserted her claim to an earthly nature by stretching herself
                  exultingly in the warm bed, with an exclamation of vivid pleasure.</p>
               <p>"How different this seems from my cold old bed at Miss Asphyxia's!" she said. "O,
                  that horrid woman! how I <emph>hate</emph> her!" she added, with a scowl and a
                  frown, which made the angelhood of the child more than questionable.</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable's vision melted. It was not a child of heaven, but a little mortal
                  sinner, that she was tucking up for the night; and she felt constrained to essay
                  her first effort at moral training.</p>
               <p>"My dear," she said, "did you not say, to-night, 'Forgive us our trespasses,
                     <emph>as</emph> we forgive those who trespass against us'? Do you know what
                  that means?"</p>
               <p>"O yes," said Tina, readily.</p>
               <p>"Well, if your Heavenly Father should forgive your sins just <emph>as</emph> you
                  forgive Miss Asphyxia, how would you like that?"</p>
               <p>There was a silence. The large bright eyes grew round and reflective, as they
                  peered out from between the sheets and the pillow. At last she said, in a modified
                  voice: "Well, I won't hate her any more. But," she added, with increased vivacity,
                  "I may think she 's hateful, may n't I?"</p>
               <p>Is there ever a hard question in morals that children do not drive straight at, in
                  their wide-eyed questioning?</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable felt inclined to laugh, but said, gravely: "I would n't advise you
                  to think evil about her. Perhaps she is a poor woman that never had any one to
                  love her, or anything to love, and it has made her hard."</p>
               <p>Tina looked at Miss Mehitable earnestly, as if she were pondering the remark. "She
                  told me that she was put to work younger than I was," she said, "and kept at it
                  all the time."</p>
               <p>"And perhaps, if you had been kept at work all your life in that hard way, you
                  would have grown up to be just like her."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I'm sorry for her," said Tina. "There's nobody loves her, that' s a
                  fact. Nobody can love her, unless it's God. He loves every one, Harry says."</p>
               <p>"Well, good night, my darling," said Miss Mehitable, kissing her. "I shall come to
                  bed pretty soon. I will leave you a candle," she added; "because this is a strange
                  place."</p>
               <p>"How good you are!" said Tina. "I used to be so afraid in the dark, at Miss
                  Asphyxia's; and I was so wicked all day, that I was afraid of God too, at night. I
                  used sometimes to think I heard something chewing under my bed; and I thought it
                  was a wolf, and would eat me up."</p>
               <p>"Poor little darling!" said Miss Mehitable. "Would you rather I sat by you till
                  you went to sleep?"</p>
               <p>"No, thank you; I don't like to trouble you," said the child. "If you leave a
                  candle I sha' n't be afraid. And, besides, I 've said my prayers now. I did n't
                  use to say them one bit at Miss Asphyxia's. She would tell me to say my prayers,
                  and then bang the door so hard, and I would feel cross, and think I would n't. But
                  I am better now, because you love me."</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable returned to the parlor, and sat down to ponder over her fire; and
                  the result of her ponderings shall be given in a letter which she immediately
                  began writing at the green-covered table.</p>

                  STORY.</head>
               <div type="letter">
                  <p>MY DEAR BROTHER:—Since I wrote you last, so strange a change has taken place in
                     my life that even now I walk about as in a dream, and hardly know myself. The
                     events of a few hours have made everything in the world seem to me as different
                     from what it ever seemed before as death is from life.</p>
                  <p>Not to keep you waiting, after so solemn a preface, I will announce to you
                     first, briefly, what it is, and then, secondly, how it happened.</p>
                  <p>Well, then, <emph>I have adopted a child,</emph> in my dry and wilted old age.
                     She is a beautiful and engaging little creature, full of life and spirits,—full
                     of warm affections,—thrown an absolute waif and stray on the sands of life. Her
                     mother was an unknown Englishwoman,—probably some relict of the retired English
                     army. She died in great destitution, in the neighboring town of Needmore,
                     leaving on the world two singularly interesting children, a boy and a girl.
                     They were, of course, taken in charge by the parish, and fell to the lot of old
                     Crab Smith and his sister, Miss Asphyxia,—just think of it! I think I need say
                     no more than this about their lot.</p>
                  <p>In a short time they ran away from cruel treatment; lived in a desolate little
                     housekeeping way in the old Dench house; till finally Sam Lawson, lounging
                     about in his general and universal way, picked them up. He brought them, of
                     course, where every wandering, distressed thing comes,—to Deacon Badger's.</p>
                  <p>Now I suppose the Deacon is comfortably off in the world, as our New England
                     farmers go, but his ability to maintain general charges of housekeeping for all
                     mankind may seriously be doubted. Lois Badger, who does the work of Martha in
                     that establishment, came over to me, yesterday afternoon, quite distressed in
                     her mind about it. Lois is a worthy creature,—rather sharp, to be sure, but,
                     when her edge is turned the right way, none the worse for that,—and really I
                     thought she had the right of it, to some extent.</p>
                  <p>People in general are so resigned to have other folks made burnt sacrifices,
                     that it did not appear to me probable that there was a creature in Oldtown who
                     would do anything more than rejoice that Deacon Badger felt able to take the
                     children. After I had made some rather bitter reflections on the world, and its
                     selfishness, in the style that we all practise, the thought suddenly occurred
                     to me, What do you, more than others? and that idea, together with the beauty
                     and charms of the poor little waif, decided me to take this bold step. I shut
                     my eyes, and took it,—not without quaking in my shoes for fear of Polly; but I
                     have carried my point in her very face, without so much as saying by your
                     leave.</p>
                  <p>The little one has just been taken up stairs and tucked up warmly in my own
                     bed, with one of our poor little Emily's old nightgowns on. They fit her
                     exactly, and I exult over her as one that findeth great spoil.</p>
                  <p>Polly has not yet declared herself, except by slamming the door very hard when
                     she first made the discovery of the child's presence in the house. I presume
                     there is an equinoctial gale gathering, but I say nothing; for, after all,
                     Polly is a good creature, and will blow herself round into the right quarter,
                     in time, as our northeast rain-storms generally do. People always accommodate
                     themselves to certainties.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but regard the coming of this child to me at this time as a messenger
                     of mercy from God, to save me from sinking into utter despair. I have been so
                     lonely, so miserable, so utterly, inexpressibly wretched of late, that it has
                     seemed that, if something did not happen to help me, I must lose my reason. Our
                     family disposition to melancholy is a hard enough thing to manage under the
                     most prosperous circumstances. I remember my father's paroxysms of gloom: they
                     used to frighten me when I was a little girl, and laid a heavy burden on the
                     heart of our<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7953-00000112"/> dear angel mother.
                     Whatever that curse is, we all inherit it. In the heart of every one of us
                     children there is that fearful <emph>black drop,</emph> like that which the
                     Koran says the angel showed to Mahomet. It is an inexplicable something which
                     always predisposes us to sadness, but in which any real, appreciable sorrow
                     strikes a terribly deep and long root. Shakespeare describes this thing, as he
                     does everything else:— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:</l>
                           <l>It wearies me,—you say it wearies you;</l>
                           <l>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</l>
                           <l>What stuff 't is made of, whereof it is born,</l>
                           <l>I am to learn."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> You have struggled with it by the most rational means,—an active
                     out-of-door life, by sea voyages and severe manual labor. A <emph>man</emph>
                     can fight this dragon as a woman cannot. We women are helpless,—tied to places,
                     forms, and rules,—chained to our stake. We must meet him as we can.</p>
                  <p>Of late I have not been able to sleep, and, lying awake all night long in
                     darkness and misery, have asked, if <emph>this</emph> be life, whether an
                     immortal existence is not a curse to be feared, rather than a blessing to be
                     hoped, and if the wretchedness we fear in the eternal world can be worse than
                     what we sometimes suffer now,—such sinking of heart, such helplessness of fear,
                     such a vain calling for help that never comes. Well, I will not live it over
                     again, for I dare say you know it all too well. I think I finally wore myself
                     out in trying to cheer poor brother Theodore's darksome way down to death. Can
                     you wonder that he would take opium? God alone can judge people that suffer as
                     he did,and, let people say what they please, I must, I will, think that God has
                     some pity for the work of his hands.</p>
                  <p>Now, brother, I must, I will, write to you about Emily; though you have said
                     you never wished to hear her name again. What right had you, her brother, to
                     give her up so, and to let the whole burden of this dreadful mystery and sorrow
                     come down on me alone? You are not certain that she has gone astray in the
                     worst sense that a woman can. We only know that she has broken away from us and
                     gone,—but where, how, and with whom, you cannot say, nor I. And certainly there
                     was great excuse for her. Consider how the peculiar temperament and
                     constitution of our family wrought upon her. Consider the temptations of her
                     wonderful beauty, her highly nervous, wildly excitable organization. Her genius
                     was extraordinary; her strength and vigor of character quite as much so.
                     Altogether, she was a perilously constituted human being,—and what did we do
                     with her? A good, common girl might have been put with Uncle and Aunt
                     Farnsworth with great advantage. We put her there for the simple reason that
                     they were her aunt and uncle, and had money enough to educate her. But in all
                     other respects they were about the most unsuited that could be conceived. I
                     must say that I think that glacial, gloomy, religious training in Uncle
                     Farnsworth's family was, for her, peculiarly unfortunate. She sat from Sunday
                     to Sunday under Dr. Stern's preaching. With a high-keyed, acute mind, she could
                     not help listening and thinking; and such thinking is unfortunate, to say the
                     least.</p>
                  <p>It always seemed to me that he was one of those who experiment on the immortal
                     soul as daring doctors experiment on the body,—using the most violent and
                     terrible remedies,—remedies that must kill or cure. His theory was, that a
                     secret enemy to God was lying latent in every soul, which, like some virulent
                     poisons in the body, could only be expelled by being brought to the surface;
                     and he had sermon after sermon, whose only object appeared to be to bring into
                     vivid consciousness what he calls the natural opposition of the human
                     heart.</p>
                  <p>But, alas! in some cases the enmity thus aroused can never be subdued; and
                     Emily's was a nature that would break before it would bow. Nothing could have
                     subdued her but love,—and love she never heard. These appalling doctrines were
                     presented with such logical clearness, and apparently so established from the
                     Scriptures, that, unable to distinguish between the word of God and the cruel
                     deductions of human logic, she trod both under foot in defiant despair. Then
                     came in the French literature, which is so fascinating, and which just now is
                     having so wide an influence on the thinking of our country. Rousseau<pb
                        n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7953-00000113"/> and Voltaire charmed her, and took
                     her into a new world. She has probably gone to France for liberty, with no
                     protection but her own virgin nature. Are we at once to infer the worst, when
                     we know so little? I, for one, shall love her and trust in her to the end; and
                     if ever she should fall, and do things that I and all the world must condemn, I
                     shall still say, that it will be less her fault than that of others; that she
                     will be one of those who fall by their higher, rather than their lower
                     nature.</p>
                  <p>I have a prophetic instinct in my heart that some day, poor, forlorn, and
                     forsaken, she will look back with regret to the old house where she was born:
                     and then she shall be welcome here. This is why I keep this solitary old place,
                     full of bitter and ghostly memories; because, as long as I keep it, there is
                     one refuge that Emily may call her own, and one heart that will be true to her,
                     and love her and believe in her to the end.</p>
                  <p>I think God has been merciful to me in sending me this child, to be to me as a
                     daughter. Already her coming has been made a means of working in me that great
                     moral change for which all my life I have been blindly seeking. I have sought
                     that <emph>conversion</emph> which our father taught us to expect as alchemists
                     seek the philosopher's stone.</p>
                  <p>What have I not read and suffered at the hands of the theologians? How many
                     lonely hours, day after day, have I bent the knee in fruitless prayer that God
                     would grant me this great, unknown grace! for without it how dreary is
                     life!</p>
                  <p>We are in ourselves so utterly helpless,—life is so hard, so inexplicable, that
                     we stand in perishing need of some helping hand, some sensible, appreciable
                     connection with God. And yet for years every cry of misery, every breath of
                     anguish, has been choked by the logical proofs of theology;—that God is my
                     enemy, or that I am his; that every effort I make toward Him but aggravates my
                     offence; and that this unknown gift, which no child of Adam ever did compass of
                     himself, is so completely in my own power, that I am every minute of my life to
                     blame for not possessing it.</p>
                  <p>How many hours have I gone round and round this dreary track,—chilled, weary,
                     shivering, seeing no light, and hearing no voice! But within this last hour it
                     seems as if a divine ray had shone upon me, and the great gift had been given
                     me by the hand of a little child. It came in the simplest and most unexpected
                     manner, while listening to a very homely hymn, repeated by this dear little
                     one. The words themselves were not much in the way of poetry; it was merely the
                     simplest statement of the truth that in Jesus Christ, ever living, ever
                     present, every human soul has a personal friend, divine and almighty.</p>
                  <p>This thought came over me with such power, that it seemed as if all my doubts,
                     all my intricate, contradictory theologies, all those personal and family
                     sorrows which had made a burden on my soul greater than poor Christian ever
                     staggered under, had gone where his did, when, at the sight of the Cross, it
                     loosed from his back and rolled down into the sepulchre, to be seen no more.
                     Can it be, I asked myself, that this mighty love, that I feel so powerfully and
                     so sweetly, has been near me all these dark, melancholy years? Has the sun been
                     shining behind all these heavy clouds, under whose shadows I have spent my
                     life?</p>
                  <p>When I laid my little Tina down to sleep to-night, I came down here to think
                     over this strange, new thought,—that I, even I, in my joyless old age, my
                     poverty, my perplexities, my loneliness, am no longer alone! I am beloved.
                     There is One who does love me,—the One Friend, whose love, like the sunshine,
                     can be the portion of each individual of the human race, without exhaustion.
                     This is the great mystery of faith, which I am determined from this hour to
                     keep whole and undefiled.</p>
                  <p>My dear brother, I have never before addressed to you a word on this subject.
                     It has been one in which I saw only perplexity. I have, it is true, been
                     grieved and disappointed that you did not see your way clear to embrace the
                     sacred ministry, which has for so many generations been the appointed work of
                     our family. I confess for many years I did hope to see you succeed, not only to
                     the library, but to the work of our honored, venerated father and grandfather.
                     It was my hope that, in this position, I should find in you a spiritual guide
                     to resolve my doubts and lead me aright. But I have gathered from you at times,
                     by chance words dropped, that you could not exactly accept the faith of our<pb
                        n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7953-00000114"/> fathers. Perhaps difficulties like
                     my own have withheld you. I know you too well to believe that the French
                     scepticism that has blown over here with the breath of our political revolution
                     can have had the least influence over you. Whatever your views of doctrines may
                     be, you are not a doubter. You are not—as poor Emily defiantly called herself—a
                     deist, an alien from all that our fathers came to this wilderness to maintain.
                     Yet when I see you burying your talents in a lonely mountain village, satisfied
                     with the work of a poor schoolmaster, instead of standing forth to lead our New
                     England in the pulpit, I ask myself, Why is this?</p>
                  <p>Speak to me, brother! tell me your innermost thoughts, as I have told you mine.
                     Is not life short and sad and bitter enough, that those who could help each
                     other should neglect the few things they can do to make it tolerable? Why do we
                     travel side by side, lonely and silent,—each, perhaps, hiding in that silence
                     the bread of life that the other needs? Write to me as I have written to you,
                     and let me know that I have a brother in soul, as I have in flesh.</p>
                  <closer>
                     <salute>Your affectionate sister,</salute>

               <div type="letter">
                  <p>MY DEAR SISTER:—I have read your letter. Answer it justly and truly how can I?
                     How little we know of each other in outside intimacy! but when we put our key
                     into the door of the secret chamber, who does not tremble and draw
                        back?—<emph>that</emph> is the true haunted chamber!</p>
                  <p>First, about Emily, I will own I am wrong. It is from no want of love, though,
                     but from too much. I was and am too sore and bitter on that subject to trust
                     myself. I have a heart full of curses, but don't know exactly where to fling
                     them; and, for aught I see, we are utterly helpless. Every clew fails; and what
                     is the use of torturing ourselves? It is a man's nature to act, to do, and,
                     where nothing can be done, to forget. It is a woman's nature to hold on to what
                     can only torture, and live all her despairs over. Women's tears are their meat;
                     men find the diet too salt, and won't take it.</p>
                  <p>Tell me anything I can <emph>do,</emph> and I 'll do it; but talk I
                     cannot,—every word burns me. I admit every word you say of Emily. We were
                     mistaken in letting her go to the Farnsworths, and be baited and tortured with
                     ultra-Calvinism; but we were blind, as we mortals always are,—fated never to
                     see what we should have done, till seeing is too late.</p>
                  <p>I am glad you have taken that child,—first, because it's a good deed in itself,
                     and, secondly, because it's good for you. That it should have shed light on
                     your relations to God is strictly philosophical. You have been trying to find
                     your way to Him by definitions and by logic; one might as well make love to a
                     lady by the first book of Euclid. "He that loveth not his brother whom he hath
                     seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?" That throb of protecting,
                     all-embracing love which thrilled through your heart for this child taught you
                     more of God than father's whole library. "He that loveth not knoweth not God."
                     The old Bible is philosophical, and eminent for its common sense. Of course
                     this child will make a fool of you. Never mind; the follies of love are
                     remedial.</p>
                  <p>As to a system of education, it will be an amusement for you to get that up.
                     Every human being likes to undertake to dictate for some other one. Go at it
                     with good cheer. But, whatever you do, don't teach her <emph>French</emph>.
                     Give her a good Saxon-English education; and, if she needs a pasture-land of
                     foreign languages, let her learn Latin, and, more than that, Greek. Greek is
                     the morning-land of languages, and has the freshness of early dew in it which
                     will never exhale.</p>
                  <p>The French helped us in our late war: for that I thank them; but from French
                     philosophy and French democracy, may the good Lord deliver us. They slew their
                     Puritans in the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the nation ever since has been
                     without a moral sense. French literature is like an eagle with one broken wing.
                     What the Puritans did for us English people, in bringing in civil liberty, they
                     lacked. Our revolutions have been gradual. I predict that theirs will come by
                     and by with an explosion.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, our young men who follow after French literature<pb n="220-221"
                        xml:id="VAC7953-00000115"/> ture become rakes and profligates. Their first
                     step in liberty is to repeal the ten commandments, especially the seventh.
                     Therefore I consider a young woman in our day misses nothing who does not read
                     French. Decorous French literature is stupid, and bright French literature is
                     too wicked for anything. So let French alone.</p>
                  <p>She threatens to be pretty, does she? So much the worse for you and her. If she
                     makes you too much trouble by and by, send her up to my academy, and I will
                     drill her, and make a Spartan of her.</p>
                  <p>As to what you say about religion, and the ministry, and the schoolmaster, what
                     can I say on this sheet of paper? Briefly then. No, I am <emph>not</emph> in
                     any sense an unbeliever in the old Bible; I would as soon disbelieve my own
                     mother. And I am in my nature a thorough Puritan. I am a Puritan as thoroughly
                     as a hound is a hound, and a pointer a pointer, whose pedigree of unmixed blood
                     can be traced for generations back. I feel within me the preaching instinct,
                     just as the hound snuffs, and the pointer points; but as to the pulpit in these
                     days,—well, thereby hangs a tale.</p>
                  <p>What should I preach, supposing I were a minister, as my father, and
                     grandfather, and great-grandfather were before me? What they preached was true
                     to them, was fitted for their times, was loyally and sincerely said, and of
                     course did a world of good. But when I look over their sermons, I put an
                     interrogation point to almost everything they say; and what was true to them is
                     not true to me; and if I should speak out as honestly as they did what is true
                     to me, the world would not understand or receive it, and I think it would do
                     more harm than good. I believe I am thinking ahead of the present generation,
                     and if I should undertake to push my thoughts I should only bother people,—just
                     as one of my bright boys in the latter part of the algebra sometimes worries a
                     new beginner with his advanced explanations.</p>
                  <p>Then again, our late Revolution has wrought a change in the ministry that will
                     soon become more and more apparent. The time when ministers were noblemen by
                     divine right, and reigned over their parishes by the cocked hat and gold-headed
                     cane, is passing away. Dr. Lothrop, and Dr. Stern, and a few others, keep up
                     the prestige, but that sort of thing is going by; and in the next generation
                     the minister will be nothing but a citizen; his words will come without
                     prestige, and be examined and sifted just like the words of any other
                     citizen.</p>
                  <p>There is a race of ministers rising up who are fully adequate to meet this
                     exigency; and these men are going to throw Calvinism down into the arena, and
                     discuss every inch of it, hand to hand and knee to knee, with the common
                     people; and we shall see what will come of this.</p>
                  <p>I, for my part, am not prepared to be a minister on these terms. Still, as I
                     said, I have the born instinct of preaching; I am dictatorial by nature, and
                     one of those who need constantly to see themselves reflected in other people's
                     eyes; and so I have got an academy here, up in the mountains, where I have a
                     set of as clear, bright-eyed, bright-minded boys and girls as you would wish to
                     see, and am in my way a pope. Well, I enjoy being a pope. It is one of my
                     weaknesses.</p>
                  <p>As to society, we have the doctor,—a quiet little wrinkled old man, a profound
                     disbeliever in medicines, who gives cream-of-tartar for ordinary cases, and
                     camomile tea when the symptoms become desperate, and reads Greek for his own
                     private amusement. Of course he does n't get very rich, but here in the
                     mountains one can afford to be poor. One of our sunsets is worth half a Boston
                     doctor's income.</p>
                  <p>Then there's the lawyer and squire, who draws the deeds, and makes the wills,
                     and settles the quarrels; and the minister, who belongs to the new
                     dispensation. He and I are sworn friends; he is my Fidus Achates. His garden
                     joins mine, and when I am hoeing my corn he is hoeing his, and thence comes
                     talk. As it gets more eager I jump the fence and hoe in his garden, or he does
                     the same to mine. We have a strife on the matter of garden craft, who shall
                     with most skill outwit our Mother Nature, and get cantelopes and melons under
                     circumstances in which she never intended them to grow. This year I beat the
                     parson, but I can see that he is secretly resolved to revenge himself on me
                        when<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7953-00000116"/> the sweet corn comes in. One
                     evening every week we devote to reading the newspaper and settling the affairs
                     of the country. We are both stanch Federalists, and make the walls ring with
                     our denunciations of Jacobinism and Democracy. Once a month we have the
                     Columbian Magazine and the foreign news from Europe, and then we have a great
                     deal on our hands; we go over affairs, every country systematically, and settle
                     them for the month. In general we are pretty well agreed, but now and then our
                     lines of policy differ, and then we fight it out with good courage, not sparing
                     the adjectives. The parson has a sly humor of his own, and our noisiest
                     discussions generally end in a hearty laugh.</p>
                  <p>So much for the man and friend,—now for the clergyman. He is neither the
                     sentimental, good parson of Goldsmith, nor the plaintive, ascetic parish priest
                     of Romanism, nor the cocked hat of the theocracy, but a lively, acute,
                     full-blooded <emph>man,</emph> who does his duty on equal terms among men. He
                     is as single-hearted as an unblemished crystal, and in some matters sacredly
                     simple; but yet not without a thrifty practical shrewdness, both in things
                     temporal and things spiritual. He has an income of about two hundred and fifty
                     dollars, with his wood. The farmers about here consider him as rolling in
                     wealth, and I must say that, though the parsonage is absolutely bare of
                     luxuries, one is not there often unpleasantly reminded that the parson is a
                     poor man. He has that golden faculty of enjoying the work he does so utterly,
                     and believing in it so entirely, that he can quite afford to be poor. He whose
                     daily work is in itself a pleasure ought not to ask for riches: so I tell
                     myself about my school-keeping, and him about his parish. He takes up the
                     conversion of sinners as an immediate practical business, to be done and done
                     now; he preaches in all the little hills and dales and hollows and brown
                     school-houses for miles around, and chases his sinners up and down so
                     zealously, that they have, on the whole, a lively time of it. He attacks
                     drinking and all our small forms of country immorality with a vigor sufficient
                     to demolish sins of double their size, and gives nobody even a chance to sleep
                     in meeting. The good farmers around here, some of whom would like to serve
                     Mammon comfortably, are rather in a quandary what to do. They never would bear
                     the constant hounding which he gives them, and the cannonades he fires at their
                     pet sins, and the way he chases them from pillar to post, and the merciless
                     manner in which he breaks in upon their comfortable old habit of sleeping in
                     meeting, were it not that they feel that they are paying him an enormous
                     salary, and ought to get their money's worth out of him, which they are certain
                     they are doing most fully. Your Yankee has such a sense of values, that, if he
                     pays a man to thrash him, he wants to be thrashed thoroughly.</p>
                  <p>My good friend preaches what they call New Divinity, by which I understand the
                     Calvinism which our fathers left us, in the commencing process of
                     disintegration. He is thoroughly and enthusiastically in earnest about it, and
                     believes that the system, as far as Edwards and Hopkins have got it, is almost
                     absolute truth; but, for all that, is cheerfully busy in making some little
                     emendations and corrections, upon which he values himself, and which he thinks
                     of the greatest consequence. What is to the credit of his heart is, that these
                     emendations are generally in favor of some original-minded sheep who can't be
                     got into the sheep-fold without some alteration in the paling. In these cases I
                     have generally noticed that he will loosen a rail or tear off a picket, and let
                     the sheep in, it being his impression, after all, that the sheep are worth more
                     than the sheep-fold.</p>
                  <p>In his zeal to catch certain shy sinners, he has more than once preached
                     sermons which his brethren about here find fault with, as wandering from old
                     standards; and it costs abundance of bustle and ingenuity to arrange his system
                     so as to provide for exceptional cases, and yet to leave it exactly what it was
                     before the alterations were made.</p>
                  <p>It is, I believe, an admitted thing among theologians, that, while theology
                     must go on improving from age to age, it must also remain exactly what it was a
                     hundred years ago.</p>
                  <p>The parson is my intimate friend, and it is easy for me to see that he has
                     designs for the good of my soul, for which I sincerely love him. I can see that
                     he is lying in wait for me patiently, as sometimes we do for trout, when we go
                     out fishing together. He reconnoitres me, approaches me carefully, makes nice
                        little<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7953-00000117"/> logical traps to catch me
                     in, and baits them with very innocent-looking questions, which I, being an old
                     theological rat, skilfully avoid answering.</p>
                  <p>My friend's forte is logic. Between you and me, if there is a golden calf
                     worshipped in our sanctified New England, its name is Logic; and my good friend
                     the parson burns incense before it with a most sacred innocence of intention.
                     He believes that sinners can be converted by logic, and that, if he could once
                     get me into one of these neat little traps aforesaid, the salvation of my soul
                     would be assured. He has caught numbers of the shrewdest infidel foxes among
                     the farmers around, and I must say that there is no trap for the Yankee like
                     the logic-trap.</p>
                  <p>I must tell you a story about this that amused me greatly. You know everybody's
                     religious opinions are a matter of discussion in our neighborhood, and Ezekiel
                     Scranton, a rich farmer who lives up on the hill, enjoys the celebrity of being
                     an atheist, and rather values himself on the distinction. It takes a man of
                     courage, you know, to live without a God; and Ezekiel gives himself out as a
                     plucky dog, and able to hold the parson at bay. The parson, however, had
                     privately prepared a string of questions which he was quite sure would drive
                     Ezekiel into strait quarters. So he meets him the other day in the store.</p>
                  <p>"How's this, Mr. Scranton? they tell me that you 're an atheist!"</p>
                  <p>"Well I guess I be, Parson," says Ezekiel, comfortably.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Ezekiel, let's talk about this. You believe in your own existence, don't
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I don't."</p>
                  <p>"What! not believe in your own existence?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I don't." Then, after a moment, "Tell you what, Parson, ain't a going to
                     be twitched up by none o' your syllogisms."</p>
                  <p>Ezekiel was quite in the right of it; for I must do my friend the parson the
                     justice to say, that, if you answer one of his simple-looking questions, you
                     are gone. You must say B after saying A, and the whole alphabet after that.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I do not greatly disbelieve the main points of Calvinism. They
                     strike me, as most hard and disagreeable things do, as quite likely to be true,
                     and very much in accordance with a sensible man's observation of facts as they
                     stand in life and nature. My doubts come up, like bats, from a dark and
                     dreadful cavern that underlies all religion, natural or revealed. They are of a
                     class abhorrent to myself, smothering to my peace, imbittering to my life.</p>
                  <p>What must he be who is tempted to deny the very right of his Creator to the
                     allegiance of his creatures?—who is tempted to feel that his own conscious
                     existence is an inflicted curse, and that the whole race of men have been a set
                     of neglected, suffering children, bred like fish-spawn on a thousand shores, by
                     a Being who has never interested himself to care for their welfare, to prevent
                     their degradation, to interfere with their cruelties to each other, as they
                     have writhed and wrangled into life, through life, and out of life again? Does
                     this look like being a Father in any sense in which we poor mortals think of
                     fatherhood? After seeing nature, can we reason against any of the harshest
                     conclusions of Calvinism, from the character of its Author?</p>
                  <p>Do we not consider a man unworthy the name of a good father who, from mere
                     blind reproductive instinct, gives birth to children for whose improvement,
                     virtue, and happiness he makes no provision? and yet does not this seem to be
                     the way more than half of the human race actually comes into existence?</p>
                  <p>Then the laws of nature are an inextricable labyrinth,—puzzling, crossing,
                     contradictory; and ages of wearisome study have as yet hardly made a portion of
                     them clear enough for human comfort; and doctors and ministers go on torturing
                     the body and the soul, with the most devout good intentions. And so forth, for
                     there is no end to this sort of talk.</p>
                  <p>Now my friend the parson is the outgrowth of the New England theocracy, about
                     the simplest, purest, and least objectionable state of society that the world
                     ever saw. He has a good digestion, a healthy mind in a healthy body; he lives
                     in a village where there is no pauperism, and hardly any crime,—where all the
                     embarrassing, dreadful social problems and mysteries of life scarcely exist.
                     But I, who have been tumbled up and<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7953-00000118"/>
                     down upon all the shores of earth, lived in India, China, and Polynesia, and
                     seen the human race as they breed like vermin, in their filth and their
                     contented degradation,—how can I think of applying the measurements of any
                     theological system to a reality like this?</p>
                  <p>Now the parts of their system on which my dear friend the parson, and those of
                     his school, specially value themselves, are their explanations of the reasons
                     why evil was permitted, and their vindications of the Divine character in view
                     of it. They are specially earnest and alert in giving out their views here, and
                     the parson has read to me more than one sermon, hoping to medicate what he
                     supposes to be my secret wound. To me their various theories are, as my friend
                     the doctor once said to me, "putting their bitter pill in a chestnut-burr; the
                     pill is bad,—there is no help for that,—but the chestnut-burr is
                     impossible."</p>
                  <p>It is incredible, the ease and cheerfulness with which a man in his study, who
                     never had so much experience of suffering as even a toothache would give him,
                     can arrange a system in which the everlasting torture of millions is casually
                     admitted as an item. But I, to whom, seriously speaking, existence has been for
                     much of my life nothing but suffering, and who always looked on my existence as
                     a misfortune, must necessarily feel reasonings of this kind in a different way.
                     This soul-ache, this throb of pain, that seems as if it were an actual anguish
                     of the immaterial part itself, is a dreadful teacher, and gives a fearful sense
                     of what the chances of an immortal existence might be, and what the
                     responsibilities of originating such existence.</p>
                  <p>I am not one of the shallow sort, who think that everything for everybody must
                     or ought to end with perfect bliss at death. On the contrary, I do not see how
                     anything but misery in eternal ages is to come from the outpouring into their
                     abyss, of wrangling, undisciplined souls, who were a torment to themselves and
                     others here, and who would make this world unbearable, were they not all swept
                     off in their turn by the cobweb brush of Death.</p>
                  <p>So you see it 's all a hopeless muddle to me. Do I then believe nothing? Yes, I
                     believe in Jesus Christ with all my heart, all my might. He stands before me
                     the one hopeful phenomenon of history. I adore him as Divine, or all of the
                     Divine that I can comprehend; and when he bids me say to God, "Our Father which
                     art in heaven," I smother all my doubts and say it. Those words are the rope
                     thrown out to me, choking in the waters,—the voice from the awful silence. "God
                        <emph>so</emph> loved the world that he gave his own Son." I try to believe
                     that he <emph>loves</emph> this world, but I have got only so far as "Help thou
                     mine unbelief."</p>
                  <p>Now, as to talking out all this to the parson, what good would it do? He is
                     preaching well and working bravely. His preaching suits the state of
                     advancement to which New England has come; and the process which he and
                     ministers of his sort institute, of having every point in theology fully
                     discussed by the common people, is not only a capital drill for their minds,
                     but it will have its effect in the end on their theologies, and out of them all
                     the truth of the future will arise.</p>
                  <p>So you see my position, and why I am niched here for life, as a schoolmaster.
                     Come up and see me some time. I have a housekeeper who is as ugly as Hecate,
                     but who reads Greek. She makes the best bread and cake in town, keeps my
                     stockings mended and my shirt-ruffles plaited and my house like wax, and hears
                     a class in Virgil every day, after she has "done her dinner-dishes." I shall
                     not fall in love with her, though. Come some time to see me, and bring your new
                     acquisition.</p>

                  <p>I have given these two letters as the best means of showing to the reader the
                     character of the family with whom my destiny and that of Tina became in future
                     life curiously intertwisted.</p>
                  <p>Among the peculiarly English ideas which the Colonists brought to

                     family hope and fear and desire, were, in my early day, strongly-marked traits.
                     Genealogy was a thing at the tip of every person's tongue, and in every
                     person's mind;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7953-00000119"/> and it is among my
                     most vivid remembrances, with what a solemn air of intense interest my mother,
                     grandmother, Aunt Lois, and Aunt Keziah would enter into minute and
                     discriminating particulars with regard to the stock, intermarriages, and family
                     settlements of the different persons whose history was under their
                     consideration. "Of a very respectable family," was a sentence so often repeated
                     at the old fireside that its influence went in part to make up my character. In
                     our present days, when every man is emphatically the son of his own deeds, and
                     nobody cares who his mother or grandmother or great-aunt was, there can
                     scarcely be an understanding of this intense feeling of race and genealogy
                     which pervaded simple colonial Massachusetts.</p>
                  <p>As I have often before intimated, the aristocracy of Massachusetts consisted of
                     two classes, the magistracy and the ministry; and these two, in this theocratic
                     State, played into each other's hands continually. Next to the magistrate and
                     the minister, in the esteem of that community, came the schoolmaster; for
                     education might be said to be the ruling passion of the State.</p>
                  <p>The history of old New England families is marked by strong lights and deep
                     shadows of personal peculiarity. We appeal to almost every old settler in New
                     England towns, if he cannot remember stately old houses, inhabited by old
                     families, whose histories might be brought to mind by that of Miss Mehitable
                     and her brother. There was in them a sort of intellectual vigor, a ceaseless
                     activity of thought, a passion for reading and study, and a quiet brooding on
                     the very deepest problems of mental and moral philosophy. The characteristic of
                     such families is the greatly disproportioned force of the internal,
                     intellectual, and spiritual life to the external one. Hence come often morbid
                     and diseased forms of manifestation. The threads which connect such persons
                     with the real life of the outer world are so fine and so weak, that they are
                     constantly breaking and giving way here and there, so that, in such races,
                     oddities and eccentricities are come to be accepted only as badges of family
                     character. Yet from stock of this character have come some of the most
                     brilliant and effective minds in New England; and from them also have come
                     hermits and recluses,—peculiar and exceptional people,— people delightful to
                     the student of human nature, but excessively puzzling to the every-day judgment
                     of mere conventional society.</p>
                  <p>The Rossiter family had been one of these. It traced its origin to the colony
                     which came out with Governor Winthrop. The eldest Rossiter had been one of the
                     ejected ministers, and came from a good substantial family of the English
                     gentry. For several successive generations there had never been wanting a son
                     in the Rossiter family to succeed to the pulpit of his father. The Rossiters
                     had been leaned on by the magistrates and consulted by the governors, and their
                     word had been law down to the time of Miss Mehitable's father.</p>
                  <p>The tendency of the stately old families of New England to constitutional
                     melancholy has been well set forth by Dr. Cotton Mather, that delightful old
                     New England grandmother, whose nursery tales of its infancy and childhood may
                     well be pondered by those who would fully understand its far-reaching maturity.
                     As I have before remarked, I have high ideas of the wisdom of grandmothers, and
                     therefore do our beloved gossip, Dr. Cotton Mather, the greatest possible
                     compliment in granting him the title.</p>
                  <p>The ministers of the early colonial days of New England, though well-read,
                     scholarly men, were more statesmen than theologians. Their minds ran upon the
                     actual arrangements of society, which were in a great degree left in their
                     hands, rather than on doctrinal and metaphysical subtilties. They took their
                     confession of faith just as the great body of Protestant reformers left it, and
                     acted upon it as a practical foundation, without much further discussion, until
                     the time of President Edwards. He was the first man who began the
                     disintegrating process of applying rationalistic methods to the accepted
                     doctrines of religion, and he rationalized far more boldly and widely than any
                     publishers of his biography have ever dared to let the world know. He sawed the
                     great dam and let out the whole waters of discussion over all New England, and
                     that free discussion led to all the shades of opinion of our modern days.
                     Little as he thought it, yet Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker were the last
                     results of the current set in motion by Jonathan Edwards.</p>
                  <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7953-00000120"/>
                  <p>Miss Mehitable Rossiter's father, during the latter part of his life, had
                     dipped into this belt of New Divinity, and been excessively and immoderately
                     interested in certain speculations concerning them. All the last part of his
                     life had been consumed in writing a treatise in opposition to Dr. Stern,
                     another rigorous old cocked-hat of his neighborhood, who maintained that the
                     Deity had created sin on purpose, because it was a necessary means of the
                     greatest good. Dr. Rossiter thought that evil had only <emph>been
                        permitted,</emph> because it could be overruled for the greatest good; and
                     each of them fought their battle as if the fate of the universe was to be
                     decided by its results.</p>
                  <p>Considered as a man, in his terrestrial and mundane relations, Dr. Rossiter had
                     that wholesome and homely interest in the things of this mortal life which was
                     characteristic of the New England religious development. While the Puritans
                     were intensely interested in the matters of the soul, they appeared to have a
                     realizing sense of the fact that a soul without a body, in a material world, is
                     at a great disadvantage in getting on. So they exhibited a sensible and
                     commendable sense of the worth of property. They were especially addicted to
                     lawful matrimony, and given to having large families of children; and, if one
                     wife died, they straightway made up the loss by another,—a compliment to the
                     virtues of the female sex which womankind appear always gratefully to
                     appreciate.</p>
                  <p>Parson Rossiter had been three times married; first, to a strong-grained,
                     homely, highly intellectual woman of one of the first Boston families, of whom
                     Miss Mehitable Rossiter was the only daughter. The Doctor was said to be one of
                     the handsomest men of his times. Nature, with her usual perversity in these
                     matters, made Miss Mehitable an exact reproduction of all the homely traits of
                     her mother, with the addition of the one or two physical defects of her
                     handsome father. No woman with a heart in her bosom ever feels marked personal
                     uncomeliness otherwise than as a great misfortune. Miss Mehitable bore it with
                     a quaint and silent pride. Her brother Jonathan, next to herself in age, the
                     son of a second and more comely wife, was far more gifted in personal points,
                     though not equal to his father. Finally, late in life, after a somewhat
                     prolonged widowhood, Parson Rossiter committed the folly of many men on the
                     downhill side of life, that of marrying a woman considerably younger than
                     himself. She was a pretty, nervous, excitable, sensitive creature, whom her
                     homely elder daughter, Miss Mehitable, no less than her husband, petted and
                     caressed on account of her beauty, as if she had been a child. She gave birth
                     to two more children, a son named Theodore, and a daughter named Emily, and
                     then died.</p>
                  <p>All the children had inherited from their father the peculiar constitutional
                     tendency to depression of spirits of which we have spoken. In these last two,
                     great beauty and brilliant powers of mind were united with such a singular
                     sensitiveness and waywardness of nature as made the prospect for happiness in
                     such a life as this, and under the strict requirements of New England society,
                     very problematical.</p>
                  <p>Theodore ran through a brilliant course in college, notwithstanding constant
                     difficulties with the college authorities, but either could not or would not
                     apply himself to any of the accepted modes of getting bread and butter which a
                     young man must adopt who means to live and get on with other men. He was full
                     of disgusts, and repulsions, and dislikes; everything in life wounded and made
                     him sore; he could or would do nothing reasonably or rationally with human
                     beings, and, to deaden the sense of pain in existence, took to the use of
                     opiates, which left him a miserable wreck on his sister's hands, the father
                     being dead.</p>
                  <p>Thus far the reader has the history of this family, and intimations of the
                     younger and more beautiful one whose after fate was yet to be connected with
                     ours.</p>
                  <p>Miss Mehitable Rossiter has always been to me a curious study. Singularly plain
                     as she was in person, old, withered, and poor, she yet commanded respect, and
                     even reverence, through the whole of a wide circle of acquaintance; for she was
                     well known to some of the most considerable families in Boston, with whom, by
                     her mother's side, she was connected. The interest in her was somewhat like
                     that in old lace, old china, and old cashmere<pb n="232-233"
                        xml:id="VAC7953-00000121"/> shawls; which, though often excessively
                     uncomely, and looking in the eyes of uninterested people like mere rubbish, are
                     held by connoisseurs to be beyond all price.</p>
                  <p>Miss Mehitable herself had great pride of character, in the sense in which
                     pride is an innocent weakness, if not a species of virtue. She had an innate
                     sense that she belonged to a good family,—a perfectly quiet conviction that she
                     was a Bradford by her mother's side, and a Rossiter by her father's side, come
                     what might in this world. She was too well versed in the duties of good blood
                     not to be always polite and considerate to the last degree to all well-meaning
                     common people, for she felt the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">noblesse
                        oblige</foreign> as much as if she had been a duchess. And, for that matter,
                     in the circles of Oldtown everything that Miss Mehitable did and said had a
                     certain weight, quite apart from that of her really fine mental powers. It was
                     the weight of past generations, of the whole Colony of Massachusetts; all the
                     sermons of five generations of ministers were in it, which to a God-fearing
                     community is a great deal.</p>
                  <p>But in her quaint, uncomely body was lodged, not only a most active and even
                     masculine mind, but a heart capable of those passionate extremes of devotion
                     which belong to the purely feminine side of woman. She was capable of a
                     romantic excess of affection, of an extravagance of hero-worship, which, had
                     she been personally beautiful, might perhaps have made her the heroine of some
                     poem of the heart. It was among the quietly accepted sorrows of her life, that
                     for her no such romance was possible.</p>
                  <p>Men always admired her as they admired other men, and talked to her as they
                     talked with each other. Many, during the course of her life, had formed
                     friendships with her, which were mere relations of comradeship, but which never
                     touched the inner sphere of the heart. That heart, so warm, so tender, and so
                     true, she kept, with a sort of conscious shame, hidden far behind the
                     intrenchments of her intellect. With an instinctive fear of ridicule, she
                     scarcely ever spoke a tender word, and generally veiled a soft emotion under
                     some quaint phrase of drollery. She seemed forever to feel the strange contrast
                     between the burning, romantic heart and the dry and withered exterior.</p>
                  <p>Like many other women who have borne the curse of marked plainness, Miss
                     Mehitable put an extravagant valuation on personal beauty. Her younger sister,
                     whose loveliness was uncommon, was a sort of petted idol to her, during all her
                     childish years. At the time of her father's death, she would gladly have
                     retained her with her, but, like many other women who are strong on the
                     intellectual side of their nature, Miss Mehitable had a sort of weakness and
                     helplessness in relation to mere material matters, which rendered her, in the
                     eyes of the family, unfit to be trusted with the bringing up of a bright and
                     wilful child. In fact, as regarded all the details of daily life, Miss
                     Mehitable was the servant of Polly, who had united the offices of
                     servant-of-all-work, housekeeper, nurse, and general factotum in old Parson
                     Rossiter's family, and between whom and the little wilful Emily grievous
                     quarrels had often arisen. For all these reasons, and because Mrs. Farnsworth
                     of the neighboring town of Adams was the only sister of the child's mother, was
                     herself childless, and in prosperous worldly circumstances, it would have been
                     deemed a flying in the face of Providence to refuse her, when she declared her
                     intention of adopting her sister's child as her own.</p>
                  <p>Of what came of this adoption I shall have occasion to speak hereafter.</p>

               <head type="sub">MISS ASPHYXIA GOES IN PURSUIT, AND MY GRANDMOTHER GIVES HER VIEWS ON
                  EDUCATION.</head>
               <p>WHEN Miss Asphyxia Smith found that both children really had disappeared from
                  Needmore so completely that no trace of them remained, to do her justice, she felt
                  some solicitude to know what had become of them. There had not been wanting
                  instances in those early days, when so large a part of Massachusetts was unbroken
                  forest, of children who had wandered away into the woods and starved to death; and
                  Miss Asphyxia was by no means an ill-wisher to any child, nor so utterly without
                  bowels as to contemplate such a possibility without some anxiety.</p>
               <p>Not that she in the least doubted the wisdom and perfect propriety of her own mode
                  of administration, which she had full faith would in the end have made a "smart
                  girl" of her little charge. "That 'ere little limb did n't know what was good for
                  herself," she said to Sol, over their evening meal of cold potatoes and boiled
                  beef.</p>
               <p>Sol looked round-eyed and stupid, and squared his shoulders, as he always did when
                  this topic was introduced. He suggested. "You don't s'pose they could 'a' wandered
                  off to the maountains where Bijah Peters' boy got lost?"</p>
               <p>There was a sly satisfaction in observing the anxious, brooding expression which
                  settled down over Miss Asphyxia's dusky features at the suggestion.</p>
               <p>"When they found that 'ere boy," continued Sol, "he was all worn to skin and bone;
                  he 'd kep' himself a week on berries and ches'nuts and sich, but a boy can't be
                  kep' on what a squirrel can."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Miss Asphyxia, "I know one thing; it ain't my fault if they do starve
                  to death. Silly critters, they was; well provided for, good home, good clothes,
                  plenty and plenty to eat. I 'm sure you can bear witness ef I ever stinted that
                  'ere child in her victuals."</p>
               <p>"I'll bear you out on that'ere," said Sol.</p>
               <p>"And well you may; I'd scorn not to give any one in my house a good bellyful,"
                  quoth Miss Asphyxia.</p>
               <p>"That's true enough," said Sol; "everybody 'll know that."</p>
               <p>"Well, it's jest total depravity," said Miss Asphyxia. "How can any one help bein'
                  convinced o' that, that has anything to do with young uns?"</p>
               <p>But the subject preyed upon the severe virgin's mind; and she so often mentioned
                  it, with that roughening of her scrubby eyebrows which betokened care, that Sol's
                  unctuous good-nature was somewhat moved, and he dropped at last a hint of having
                  fallen on a trace of the children. He might as well have put the tips of his
                  fingers into a rolling-mill. Miss Asphyxia was so wide-awake and resolute about
                  anything that she wanted to know, that Sol at last was obliged to finish with
                  informing her that he had heard of the children as having been taken in at Deacon
                  Badger's, over in Oldtown. Sol internally chuckled, as he gave the information,
                  when he saw how immediately Miss Asphyxia bristled with wrath. Even the best of
                  human beings have felt that transient flash when anxiety for the fate of a child
                  supposed to be in fatal danger gives place to unrestrained vexation at the little
                  culprit who has given such a fright.</p>
               <p>"Well, I shall jest tackle up and go over and bring them children home agin, at
                  least the girl. Brother, he says he don't want the boy; he wa'n't nothin' but a
                  plague; but I'm one o' them persons that when I undertake a thing I mean to go
                  through with it. Now I undertook to raise that 'ere girl, and I mean to. She need
                  n't think she's goin' to come round me with any o' her shines, going over to
                  Deacon Badger's with lying stories about me. Mis' Deacon Badger need n't think
                  she's goin' to hold up her head over me, if she <emph>is</emph> a deacon's wife
                  and I <emph>ain't</emph> a perfessor of religion. I guess I <emph>could</emph> be
                  a perfessor if I chose to do as some folks do. That's what I told Mis' Deacon
                  Badger once when she asked me why I did n't jine the church. 'Mis'<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000123"/> Badger,' says I, 'perfessin ain't possessin, and I
                  'd ruther stand outside the church than go on as some people do inside on
                  't.'"</p>
               <p>Therefore it was that a day or two after, when Miss Mehitable was making a quiet
                  call at my grandmother's, and the party, consisting of my grandmother, Aunt Lois,
                  and Aunt Keziah, were peacefully rattling their knitting-needles, while Tina was
                  playing by the river-side, the child's senses were suddenly paralyzed by the sight
                  of Miss Asphyxia driving with a strong arm over the bridge near my
                  grandmother's.</p>
               <p>In a moment the little one's heart was in her throat. She had such an awful faith
                  in Miss Asphyxia's power to carry through anything she undertook, that all her
                  courage withered at once at sight of her. She ran in at the back door, perfectly
                  pale with fright, and seized hold imploringly of Miss Mehitable's gown.</p>
               <p>"O, she's coming! she 's coming after me. Don't let her get me!" she
                  exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter now?" said my grandmother. "What ails the child?"</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable lifted her in her lap, and began a soothing course of inquiry; but
                  the child clung to her, only reiterating, "Don't let her have me! she is dreadful!
                  don't!"</p>
               <p>"As true as you live, mother," said Aunt Lois, who had tripped to the window,
                  "there 's Miss Asphyxia Smith hitching her horse at our picket fence."</p>
               <p>"She is?" said my grandmother, squaring her shoulders, and setting herself in fine
                  martial order. "Well, let her come in; she's welcome, I 'm sure. I 'd like to talk
                  to that woman! It's a free country, and everybody's got to speak their minds,"—and
                  my grandmother rattled her needles with great energy.</p>
               <p>In a moment more Miss Asphyxia entered. She was arrayed in her best Sunday
                  clothes, and made the neighborly salutations with an air of grim composure. There
                  was silence, and a sense of something brooding in the air, as there often is
                  before the outburst of a storm.</p>
               <p>Finally, Miss Asphyxia opened the trenches. "I come over, Mis' Badger, to see
                  about a gal o' mine that has run away." Here her eye rested severely on Tina.</p>
               <p>"Run away!" quoth my grandmother, briskly; "and good reason she should run away;
                  all I wonder at is that you have the face to come to a Christian family after
                  her,—that 's all. Well, she is provided for, and you 've no call to be inquiring
                  anything about <emph>her</emph>. So I advise you to go home, and attend to your
                  own affairs, and leave children to folks that know how to manage them better than
                  you do."</p>
               <p>"I expected this, Mis' Badger," said Miss Asphyxia, in a towering wrath, "but I 'd
                  have you to know that I ain't a person that's going to take sa'ace from no one. No
                  deacon nor deacon's wife, nor perfesser of religion, 's a goin' to turn up their
                  noses at me! I can hold up my head with any on 'em, and I think your religion
                  might teach you better than takin' up stories agin your neighbors, as a little
                  lyin', artful hussy 'll tell." Here there was a severe glance at Miss Tina, who
                  quailed before it, and clung to Miss Mehitable's gown. "Yes, indeed, you may hide
                  your head," she continued, "but you can't git away from the truth; not when I 'm
                  round to bring you out. Yes, Mis' Badger, I defy her to say I hain't done well by
                  her, if she says the truth; for I say it now, this blessed minute, and would say
                  it on my dyin' bed, and you can ask Sol ef that 'ere child hain't had everything
                  pervided for her that a child could want,—a good clean bed and plenty o'
                  bedclothes, and good whole clothes to wear, and her belly full o' good victuals
                  every day; an' me a teachin' and a trainin' on her, enough to wear the very life
                  out o' me,—for I always hated young uns, and this ere 's a perfect little limb as
                  I ever did see. Why, what did she think I was a goin' to do for her? I did n't
                  make a lady on her; to be sure I did n't: I was a fetchin' on her up to work for
                  her livin' as I was fetched up. I had n't nothin' more 'n she; an' just look at me
                  now; there ain't many folks that can turn off as much work in a day as I can,
                  though I say it that should n't. And I 've got as pretty a piece of property, and
                  as well seen to, as most any round; and all I 've got—house and lands—is my own
                  arnin's, honest, so there! There's folks, I s'pose, that thinks they can afford to
                  keep tavern for all sorts of stragglers and runaways, Injun and white. I never was
                  one o' them sort of<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7953-00000124"/> folks, an' I should
                  jest like to know ef those folks is able,—that's all. I guess if 'counts was added
                  up, my 'counts would square up better 'n theirn."</p>
               <p>Here Miss Asphyxia elevated her nose and sniffed over my grandmother's cap-border
                  in a very contemptuous manner, and the cap-border bristled defiantly, but
                  undismayed, back again.</p>
               <p>"Come now, Mis' Badger, have it out; I ain't afraid of you! I 'd just like to have
                  you tell me what I could ha' done more nor better for this child."</p>
               <p>"Done!" quoth my grandmother, with a pop like a roasted chestnut bursting out of
                  the fire. "Why, you 've done what you 'd no business to. You 'd no business to
                  take a child at all; you have n't got a grain of motherliness in you. Why, look at
                  natur', that might teach you that more than meat and drink and clothes is wanted
                  for a child. Hens brood their chickens, and keep 'em warm under their wings; and
                  cows lick their calves and cosset 'em, and it 's a mean shame that folks will take
                  'em away from them. There 's our old cat will lie an hour on the kitchen floor and
                  let her kittens lug and pull at her, atween sleeping and waking, just to keep 'em
                  warm and comfortable, you know. 'T ain't just feedin' and clothin' back and belly
                  that 's all; it 's <emph>broodin'</emph> that young creeturs wants; and you hain
                  't got a bit of broodin' in you; your heart 's as hard as the nether mill-stone.
                  Sovereign grace may soften it some day, but nothin' else can; you 're a poor, old,
                  hard, worldly woman, Miss Asphyxia Smith: that's what <emph>you</emph> are! If
                  Divine grace could have broken in upon you, and given you a heart to love the
                  child, you might have brought her up, 'cause you are a smart woman, and an honest
                  one; that nobody denies."</p>
               <p>Here Miss Mehitable took up the conversation, surveying Miss Asphyxia with that
                  air of curious attention with which one studies a human being entirely out of the
                  line of one's personal experience. Miss Mehitable was, as we have shown, in every
                  thread of her being and education an aristocrat, and had for Miss Asphyxia that
                  polite, easy tolerance which a sense of undoubted superiority gives, united with a
                  shrewd pleasure in the study of a new and peculiar variety of the human
                  species.</p>
               <p>"My good Miss Smith," she observed, in conciliatory tones, "by your own account
                  you must have had a great deal of trouble with this child. Now I propose for the
                  future to relieve you of it altogether. I do not think you would ever succeed in
                  making as efficient a person as yourself of her. It strikes me," she added, with a
                  humorous twinkle of her eye, "that there are radical differences of nature, which
                  would prevent her growing up like yourself. I don't doubt you conscientiously
                  intended to do your duty by her, and I beg you to believe that you need have no
                  further trouble with her."</p>
               <p>"Goodness gracious knows," said Miss Asphyxia, "the child ain't much to fight
                  over,—she was nothin' but a plague; and I 'd rather have done all she did any day,
                  than to 'a' had her round under my feet. I hate young uns, anyway."</p>
               <p>"Then why, my good woman, do you object to parting with her?"</p>
               <p>"Who said I did object? I don't care nothin' about parting with her; all is, when
                  I begin a thing I like to go through with it."</p>
               <p>"But if it is n't worth going through with," said Miss Mehitable, "it's as well to
                  leave it, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"And I'd got her clothes made,—not that they're worth so very much, but then they
                  're worth just what they <emph>are</emph> worth, anyway," said Miss Asphyxia.</p>
               <p>Here Tina made a sudden impulsive dart from Miss Mehitable's lap, and ran out of
                  the back door, and over to her new home, and up into the closet of the chamber
                  where was hanging the new suit of homespun in which Miss Asphyxia had arrayed her.
                  She took it down and rolled the articles all together in a tight bundle, which she
                  secured with a string, and, before the party in the kitchen had ceased wondering
                  at her flight, suddenly reappeared, with flushed cheeks and dilated eyes, and
                  tossed the bundle into Miss Asphyxia's lap. "There 's every bit you ever gave me,"
                  she said; "I don't want to keep a single thing."</p>
               <p>"My dear, is that a proper way to speak?" said Miss Mehitable, reprovingly; but
                  Tina saw my grandmother's broad shoulders joggling with a secret laugh, and
                  discerned twinkling lines in the reproving gravity which Miss Mehitable tried to
                  assume. She felt pretty sure of her ground by this time.</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7953-00000125"/>
               <p>"Well, it 's no use talkin'," said Miss Asphyxia, rising. "If folks think they 're
                  able to bring up a beggar child like a lady, it 's their lookout and not mine. I
                  was n't aware," she added, with severe irony, "that Parson Rossiter left so much
                  of an estate that you could afford to bring up other folks' children in silks and
                  satins."</p>
               <p>"Our estate is n't much," said Miss Mehitable, good-naturedly, "but we shall make
                  the best of it."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, you just mark my words, Miss Rossiter," said Miss Asphyxia, "that 'ere
                  child will never grow up a smart woman with <emph>your</emph> bringin' up; she 'll
                  jest run right over <emph>you,</emph> and you'll let her have her head in
                  everything. I see jest how 't 'll be; I don't want nobody to tell me."</p>
               <p>"I dare say you are quite right, Miss Smith," said Miss Mehitable; "I have n't the
                  slightest opinion of my own powers in that line; but she may be happy with me, for
                  all that."</p>
               <p>"Happy?" repeated Miss Asphyxia, with an odd intonation, as if she were repeating
                  a sound of something imperfectly comprehended, and altogether out of her line. "O,
                  well, if folks is goin' to begin to talk about <emph>that,</emph> I hain't got
                  time; it don't seem to me that <emph>that</emph>'s what this 'ere world's
                  for."</p>
               <p>"What is it for, then?" said Miss Mehitable, who felt an odd sort of interest in
                  the human specimen before her.</p>
               <p>"Meant for? Why, for hard work, I s'pose; that 's all I ever found it for. Talk
                  about coddling! it 's little we get o' that, the way the Lord fixes things in this
                  world, dear knows. He 's pretty up and down with us, by all they tell us. You must
                  take things right off, when they 're goin'. Ef you don't, so much the worse for
                  you; they won't wait for you. Lose an hour in the morning, and you may chase it
                  till ye drop down, you never 'll catch it! That 's the way things goes, and I
                  should like to know who 's a going to stop to quiddle with young uns? 'T ain't me,
                  that's certain; so, as there 's no more to be made by this 'ere talk, I may's well
                  be goin'. You're welcome to the young un, ef you say so; I jest wanted you to know
                  that what I begun I 'd 'a' gone through with, ef you had n't stepped in; and I did
                  n't want no reflections on my good name, neither, for I had my ideas of what 's
                  right, and can have 'em yet, I s'pose, if Mis' Badger does think I've got a heart
                  of stone. I should like to know how I 'm to have any other when I ain't elected,
                  and I don't see as I am, or likely to be, and I don't see neither why I ain't full
                  as good as a good many that be."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, Miss Smith," said Miss Mehitable, "we can't any of us enter into
                  those mysteries, but I respect your motives, and would be happy to see you any
                  time you will call, and I 'm in hopes to teach this little girl to treat you
                  properly," she said, taking the child's hand.</p>
               <p>"Likely story," said Miss Asphyxia, with a short, hard laugh. "She 'll get ahead
                  o' you, you 'll see that: but I don't hold malice, so good morning,"—and Miss
                  Asphyxia suddenly and promptly departed, and was soon seen driving away at a
                  violent pace.</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, that woman is n't so bad, now," said Miss Mehitable, looking after
                  her, while she leisurely inhaled a pinch of snuff.</p>
               <p>"O, I 'm so glad you did n't let her have me!" said Tina.</p>
               <p>"To think of a creature so dry and dreary, so devoid even of the conception of
                  enjoyment in life," said Miss Mehitable, "hurrying through life without a moment's
                  rest,—without even the capacity of resting if she could,—and all for what?"</p>
               <p>"For my part, mother, I think you were down too hard on her," said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"Not a bit," said my grandmother, cheerily. "Such folks ought to be talked to; it
                  may set her to thinking, and do her good. I 've had it on my heart to give that
                  woman a piece of my mind ever since the children came here. Come here, my poor
                  little dear," said she to Tina, with one of her impulsive outgushes of
                  motherliness. "I know you must be hungry by this time; come into the buttery, and
                  see what I 've got for you."</p>
               <p>Now there was an indiscreet championship of Miss Tina, a backing of her in her
                  treatment of Miss Asphyxia, in this overflow, which Aunt Lois severely
                  disapproved, and which struck Miss Mehitable as not being the very best thing to
                  enforce her own teachings of decorum and propriety.</p>
               <p>The small young lady tilted into the buttery after my grandmother<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000126"/> mother, with the flushed cheeks and triumphant air
                  of a victor, and they heard her little tongue running with the full assurance of
                  having a sympathetic listener.</p>
               <p>"Now mother will spoil that child, if you let her," said Aunt Lois. "She 's the
                  greatest hand to spoil children; she always lets 'em have what they ask for. I
                  expect Susy's boys 'll be raising Cain round the house; they would if it was n't
                  for me. They have only to follow mother into that buttery, and out they come with
                  great slices of bread and butter, any time of day,—yes, and even sugar on it, if
                  you 'll believe me."</p>
               <p>"And does 'em good, too," said my grandmother, who reappeared from the buttery,
                  with Miss Tina tilting and dancing before her, with a confirmatory slice of bread
                  and butter and sugar in her hand. "Tastes good, don't it, dear?" said she, giving
                  the child a jovial chuck under her little chin.</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," said Miss Tina; "I 'd like to have old nasty Sphyxy see me
                  now."</p>
               <p>"Tut, tut! my dear," said grandmother; "good little girls don't call names";—but
                  at the same time the venerable gentlewoman nodded and winked in the most open
                  manner across the curly head at Miss Mehitable, and her portly shoulders shook
                  with laughter, so that the young culprit was not in the least abashed at the
                  reproof.</p>
               <p>"Mother, I do wonder at you!" said Aunt Lois, indignantly.</p>
               <p>"Never you mind, Lois; I guess I 've brought up more children than ever you did,"
                  said my grandmother, cheerily. "There, my little dear," she added, "you may run
                  down to your play now, and never fear that anybody 's going to get
                     <emph>you.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Miss Tina, upon this hint, gladly ran off to finish an architectural structure of
                  pebbles by the river, which she was busy in building at the time when the awful
                  vision of Miss Asphyxia appeared; and my grandmother returned to her buttery to
                  attend to a few matters which had been left unfinished in the morning's work.</p>
               <p>"It is a very serious responsibility," said Miss Mehitable, when she had knit
                  awhile in silence, "at my time of life, to charge one's self with the education of
                  a child. One treats one's self to a child as one buys a picture or a flower, but
                  the child will not remain a picture or a flower, and then comes the awful
                  question, what it may grow to be, and what share you may have in determining its
                  future."</p>
               <p>"Well, old Parson Moore used to preach the best sermons on family government that
                  ever I heard," said Aunt Lois. "He said you must begin in the very beginning and
                  break a child's will,—short off,—nothing to be done without that. I remember he
                  whipped little Titus, his first son, off and on, nearly a whole day, to make him
                  pick up a pocket-handkerchief."</p>
               <p>Here the edifying conversation was interrupted by a loud explosive expletive from
                  the buttery, which showed that my grandmother was listening with anything but
                  approbation.</p>
               <p>"FIDDLESTICKS!" quoth she.</p>
               <p>"And did he succeed in entirely subduing the child's will in that one effort?"
                  said Miss Mehitable, musingly.</p>
               <p>"Well, no. Mrs. Moore told me he had to have twenty or thirty just such spells
                  before he brought him under; but he persevered, and he broke his will at last,—at
                  least so far that he always minded when his father was round."</p>
               <p>"FIDDLESTICKS!" quoth my grandmother, in a yet louder and more explosive tone.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Badger does not appear to sympathize with your views," said Miss
                  Mehitable.</p>
               <p>"O, mother? Of course she don't; she has her own ways and doings, and she won't
                  hear to reason," said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Lois; I never knew an old maid who did n't think she knew just how to
                  bring up children," said my grandmother. "Wish you could have tried yourself with
                  that sort of doxy when you was little. Guess if I 'd broke your will, I should ha'
                  had to break you for good an' all, for your will is about all there is of you! But
                  I tell you, I had too much to do to spend a whole forenoon making you pick up a
                  pocket-handkerchief. When you did n't mind, I hit you a good clip, and picked it
                  up myself; and when you would n't go where I wanted you, I picked you up, neck and
                  crop, and put you there. That was my government. I let your will take care of
                  itself. I thought the<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7953-00000127"/> Lord had given
                  you a pretty strong one, and he knew what 't was for, and could take care of it in
                  his own time, which hain't come yet, as I see."</p>
               <p>Now this last was one of those personal thrusts with which dear family friends are
                  apt to give arguments a practical application; and Aunt Lois's spare, thin cheeks
                  flushed up as she said, in an aggrieved tone: "Well, I s'pose I 'm dreadful, of
                  course. Mother always contrives to turn round on me."</p>
               <p>"Well, Lois, I hate to hear folks talk nonsense," said my grandmother, who by this
                  time had got a pot of cream under her arm, which she was stirring with the
                  pudding-stick; and this afforded her an opportunity for emphasizing her sentences
                  with occasional dumps of the same.</p>
               <p>"People don't need to talk to me," she said, "about Parson Moore's government.
                  Tite Moore was n't any great shakes, after all the row they made about him. He was
                  well enough while his father was round, but about the worst boy that ever I saw
                  when his eye was off from him. Good or bad, my children was about the same behind
                  my back that they were before my face, anyway."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, there was Aunt Sally Morse," said Aunt Lois, steadily ignoring the
                  point of my grandmother's discourse. "There was a woman that brought up children
                  exactly to suit me. Everything went like clock-work with her babies; they were
                  nursed just so often, and no more; they were put down to sleep at just such a
                  time, and nobody was allowed to rock 'em, or sing to 'em, or fuss with 'em. If
                  they cried, she just whipped them till they stopped; and when they began to toddle
                  about, she never put things out of their reach, but just slapped their hands
                  whenever they touched them, till they learnt to let things alone."</p>
               <p>"Slapped their hands!" quoth my grandmother, "and learnt them to let things alone!
                  I 'd like to ha' seen that tried on my children. Sally had a set of white, still
                  children, that were all just like dipped candles by natur', and she laid it all to
                  her management; and look at 'em now they 're grown up. They 're decent,
                  respectable folks, but noways better than other folks' children. Lucinda Morse
                  ain't a bit better than you are, Lois, if she was whipped and made to lie still
                  when she was a baby, and you were taken up and rocked when you cried. All is, they
                  had hard times when they were little, and cried themselves to sleep nights, and
                  were hectored and worried when they ought to have been taking some comfort. Ain't
                  the world hard enough, without fighting babies, I want to know? I hate to see a
                  woman that don't want to rock her own baby, and is contriving ways all the time to
                  shirk the care of it. Why, if all the world was that way, there would be no sense
                  in Scriptur'. 'As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you,' the
                  Bible says, taking for granted that mothers were made to comfort children and give
                  them good times when they are little. Sally Morse was always talking about her
                  system. She thought she did wonders, 'cause she got so much time to piece
                  bedquilts, and work counterpanes, and make pickles, by turning off her children;
                  but I took my comfort in mine, and let them have their comfort as they went along.
                  It 's about all the comfort there is in this world, anyway, and they 're none the
                  worse for it now, as I see."</p>
               <p>"Well, in all these cases there is a medium, if we could hit it," said Miss
                  Mehitable. "There must be authority over these ignorant, helpless little folks in
                  early years, to keep them from ruining themselves."</p>
               <p>"O yes. Of course there must be government," said my grandmother. "I always made
                  my children mind me; but I would n't pick quarrels with 'em, nor keep up long
                  fights to break their will; if they did n't mind, I came down on 'em and had it
                  over with at once, and then was done with 'em. They turned out pretty fair, too,"
                  said my grandmother complacently, giving an emphatic thump with her
                  pudding-stick.</p>
               <p>"I was reading Mr. John Locke's treatise on education yesterday," said Miss
                  Mehitable. "It strikes me there are many good ideas in it."</p>
               <p>"Well, one live child puts all your treatises to rout," said my grandmother.
                  "There ain't any two children alike; and what works with one won't with another.
                  Folks have just got to open<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7953-00000128"/> their eyes,
                  and look and see what the Lord meant when he put the child together, if they can,
                  and not stand in his way; and after all we must wait for sovereign grace to finish
                  the work: if the Lord don't keep the house, the watchman waketh but in vain.
                  Children are the heritage of the Lord,—that 's all you can make of it."</p>
               <p>My grandmother, like other warm-tempered, impulsive, dictatorial people, had
                  formed her theories of life to suit her own style of practice. She was, to be
                  sure, autocratic in her own realm, and we youngsters knew that, at certain times
                  when her blood was up, it was but a word and a blow for us, and that the blow was
                  quite likely to come first and the word afterward; but the temporary severities of
                  kindly-natured, generous people never lessen the affection of children or
                  servants, any more than the too hot rays of the benignant sun, or the too driving
                  patter of the needful rain. When my grandmother detected us in a childish piece of
                  mischief, and soundly cuffed our ears, or administered summary justice with
                  immediate polts of her rheumatic crutch, we never felt the least rising of wrath
                  or rebellion, but only made off as fast as possible, generally convinced that the
                  good woman was in the right of it, and that we got no more than we deserved.</p>
               <p>I remember one occasion when Bill had been engaged in making some dressed chickens
                  dance, which she had left trussed up with the liver and lights duly washed and
                  replaced within them. Bill set them up on their pins, and put them through active
                  gymnastics, in course of which these interior treasures were rapidly scattered out
                  upon the table. A howl of indignation from grandmother announced coming wrath, and
                  Bill darted out of the back door, while I was summarily seized and chastised.</p>
               <p>"Grandmother, grandmother! <emph>I</emph> did n't do it,—it was Bill."</p>
               <p>"Well, but I can't catch Bill, you see," said my venerable monitor, continuing the
                  infliction.</p>
               <p>"But I did n't do it."</p>
               <p>"Well, let it stand for something you did do, then," quoth my grandmother, by this
                  time quite pacified: "you do bad things enough that you ain't whipped for, any
                  day."</p>
               <p>The whole resulted in a large triangle of pumpkin pie, administered with the
                  cordial warmth of returning friendship, and thus the matter was happily adjusted.
                  Even the prodigal son Bill, when, returning piteously, and standing penitent under
                  the milk-room window, he put in a submissive plea, "Please, grandmother, I won't
                  do so any more," was allowed a peaceable slice of the same comfortable portion,
                  and bid to go in peace.</p>
               <p>I remember another funny instance of my grandmother's discipline. It was when I
                  was a little fellow, seated in the chimney-corner at my grandfather's side. I had
                  discovered a rising at the end of my shoe-sole, which showed that it was beginning
                  to come off. It struck me as a funny thing to do to tear up the whole sole, which
                  piece of mischief my grandfather perceiving, he raised his hand to chastise.</p>
               <p>"Come here, Horace, quick!" said my grandmother, imperatively, that she might save
                  me from the impending blow.</p>
               <p>I lingered, whereat she made a dart at me, and seized me. Just as my grandfather
                  boxed my ear on one side, she hit me a similar cuff on the other.</p>
               <p>"Why did n't you come when I called you," she said; "now you 've got your ears
                  boxed both sides."</p>
               <p>Somewhat bewildered, I retreated under her gown in disgrace, but I was after a
                  relenting moment lifted into her lap, and allowed to go to sleep upon her ample
                  bosom.</p>
               <p>"Mother, why don't you send that boy to bed nights?" said Aunt Lois. "You never
                  have any regular rules about anything."</p>
               <p>"Law, he likes to sit up and see the fire as well as any of us, Lois; and do let
                  him have all the comfort he can as he goes along, poor boy! there ain't any too
                  much in this world, anyway."</p>
               <p>"Well, for my part, I think there ought to be <emph>system</emph> in bringing up
                  children," said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"Wait till you get 'em of your own, and then try it, Lois," said my grandmother,
                  laughing with a rich, comfortable laugh which rocked my little sleepy head up and
                  down, as I drowsily opened my eyes with a delicious sense of warmth and
                  security.</p>
               <p>From all these specimens it is to be inferred that the theorists on education will
                  find no improvement in the contemplation of<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000129"/> my grandmother's methods, and will pronounce her a
                  pig-headed, passionate, impulsive, soft-hearted body, as entirely below the notice
                  of a rational, inquiring mind as an old brooding hen, which model of maternity in
                  many respects she resembled. It may be so, but the longer I live, the more faith I
                  have in grandmothers and grandmotherly logic, of which, at some future time, I
                  shall give my views at large.</p>

               <head type="sub">WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THE BOY?</head>
               <p>"WELL," said my Aunt Lois, as she gave the last sweep to the hearth, after she had
                  finished washing up the supper dishes; "I 've been up to Ebal Scran's store this
                  afternoon, to see about soling Horace's Sunday shoes. Ebal will do 'em as
                  reasonable as any one; and he spoke to me to know whether I knew of any boy that a
                  good family would like to bind out to him for an apprentice, and I told him I 'd
                  speak to you about Horace. It 'll be time pretty soon to think of putting him at
                  something."</p>
               <p>Among the many unexplained and inexplicable woes of childhood, are its bitter
                  antagonisms, so perfectly powerless, yet often so very decided, against certain of
                  the grown people who control it. Perhaps some of us may remember respectable,
                  well-meaning people, with whom in our mature years we live in perfect amity, but
                  who in our childhood appeared to us bitter enemies. Children are remarkably
                  helpless in this respect, because they cannot choose their company and
                  surroundings as grown people can; and are sometimes entirely in the power of those
                  with whom their natures are so unsympathetic that they may be almost said to have
                  a constitutional aversion to them. Aunt Lois was such a one to me, principally
                  because of her forecasting, untiring, pertinacious, care-taking propensities. She
                  had already looked over my lot in life, and set down in her own mind what was to
                  be done with me, and went at it with a resolute energy that would not wait for the
                  slow development of circumstances.</p>
               <p>That I should want to study, as my father did,—that I should for this cause hang
                  as an unpractical, unproductive, dead weight on the family,—was the evil which she
                  saw in prospective, against which my grandfather's placid, easy temper, and my
                  grandmother's impulsive bountifulness, gave her no security. A<pb n="250-251"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000130"/> student in the family, and a son in college, she
                  felt to be luxuries to which a poor widow in dependent circumstances had no right
                  to look forward, and therefore she opened the subject betimes, with prompt energy,
                  by the proposition above stated.</p>
               <p>My mother, who sat on the other side of the fireplace, looked at me with a
                  fluttering look of apprehension. I flushed up in a sort of rage that somehow Aunt
                  Lois always succeeded in putting me into. "I don't want to be a shoemaker, and I
                  won't neither," I said.</p>
               <p>"Tut, tut," said my grandfather, placidly, from his corner; "we don't let little
                  boys say 'won't' here."</p>
               <p>I now burst out crying, and ran to my grandmother, sobbing as if my heart would
                  break.</p>
               <p>"Lois, <emph>can't</emph> you let this boy alone?" said my grandmother,
                  vengefully; "I do wonder at you. Poor little fellow! his father ain't quite cold
                  in his grave yet, and you want to pitch him out into the world,"—and my
                  grandmother seized me in her strong arms, and lulled me against her ample bosom.
                  "There, poor boy, don't you cry; you sha' n't, no, you sha' n't; you shall stay
                  and help grandma, so you shall."</p>
               <p>"Great help he is," said Aunt Lois, contemptuously; "gets a book in his hand and
                  goes round with his head in a bag; never gives a message right, and is always
                  stumbling over things that are right in his way. There's Harry, now, is as handy
                  as a girl, and if he says he 'll do a thing, I know 't 'll be done,"—and Aunt Lois
                  illustrated her doctrine by calling up Harry, and making him stretch forth his
                  arms for a skein of blue-mixed yarn which she was going to wind. The fire-light
                  shone full on his golden curls and clear blue eyes, as he stood obediently and
                  carefully yielding to Aunt Lois's quick, positive movements. As she wound, and
                  twitched, and pulled, with certainly twice the energy that the work in hand
                  required, his eyes followed her motions with a sort of quiet drollery; there was a
                  still, inward laugh in them, as if she amused him greatly.</p>
               <p>Such open comparisons between two boys might have gone far to destroy incipient
                  friendship; but Harry seemed to be in a wonderful degree gifted with the faculties
                  that made him a universal versal favorite. All the elders of the family liked him,
                  because he was quiet and obedient, always doing with cheerful promptness exactly
                  what he was bidden, unless, as sometimes happened in our family circle, he was
                  bidden to do two or three different things at one and the same time, when he would
                  stand looking innocently puzzled, till my grandmother and Aunt Lois and Aunt
                  Keziah had settled it among them whose was to be the ruling will. He was deft and
                  neat-handed as a girl about any little offices of a domestic nature; he was
                  thoughtful and exact in doing errands; he was delicately clean and neat in his
                  personal habits; he never tracked Aunt Lois's newly scoured floor with the traces
                  of unwiped shoes; he never left shavings and litter on a cleanly swept hearth, or
                  tumbled and deranged anything, so that he might safely be trusted on errands even
                  to the most sacred precincts of a housekeeper's dominions. What boy with all these
                  virtues is not held a saint by all women-folk? Yet, though he was frequently
                  commended in all those respects, to my marked discredit, Harry was to me a sort of
                  necessary of life. There was something in his nature that was wanting to mine, and
                  I attached myself to him with a pertinacity which had never before marked my
                  intercourse with any boy.</p>
               <p>A day or two after the arrival of the children, the minister and Lady Lothrop had
                  called on my grandmother in all the dignity of their station, and taken an
                  approving view of the boy. Lady Lothrop had engaged to take him under her care,
                  and provide a yearly sum for his clothing and education. She had never had a child
                  of her own, and felt that diffidence about taking the entire charge of a boy which
                  would be natural to a person of fastidious and quiet habits, and she therefore
                  signified that it would be more agreeable to her if my grandmother would allow him
                  to make one of her own family circle,—a proposal to which she cheerfully assented,
                  saying, that "one more chick makes little difference to an old hen."</p>
               <p>I immediately petitioned that I might have Harry for a bedfellow, and he and I
                  were allowed a small bedroom to ourselves at the head of the back stairs. It was a
                  rude little crib, roughly fenced off from the passage-way by unplaned boards of
                     different<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7953-00000131"/> heights. A pine table, two
                  stools, a small trundle-bed, and a rude case of drawers, were all its furniture.
                  Harry's love of order was strikingly manifest in the care which he took of this
                  little apartment. His few articles of clothing and personal belongings all had
                  their exact place, and always were bestowed there with scrupulous regularity. He
                  would adjust the furniture, straighten the bed-clothing, and quietly place and
                  replace the things that I in my fitful, nervous eagerness was always disarranging;
                  and when, as often happened in one of my spasms of enthusiasm, I turned everything
                  in the room topsy-turvy, searching for something I had lost, or projecting some
                  new arrangement, he would wait peaceably till I had finished, and then noiselessly
                  get everything back again into its former order. He never quarrelled with me, or
                  thwarted me in my turbulent or impatient moods, but seemed to wait for me to get
                  through whatever I was doing, when he would come in and silently rearrange. He
                  was, on the whole, a singularly silent child, but with the kind of silence which
                  gives a sense of companionship. It was evident that he was always intensely
                  observant and interested in whatever was going on before him, and ready at any
                  moment to take a friendly part when he was wanted; but for the most part his place
                  in the world seemed that of an amused listener and observer. Life seemed to
                  present itself to him as a curious spectacle, and he was never tired of looking
                  and listening, watching the ways and words of all our family circle, and often
                  smiling to himself as if they afforded him great diversion. Aunt Lois, with her
                  quick, sharp movements, her determined, outspoken ways, seemed to amuse him as
                  much as she irritated me, and I would sometimes see him turn away with a droll
                  smile when he had been watching one of her emphatic courses round the room. He had
                  a certain tact in avoiding all the sharp corners and angles of her character,
                  which, in connection with his handiness and his orderly ways, caused him at last
                  to become a prime favorite with her. With his quiet serviceableness and manual
                  dexterity, he seemed to be always the one that was exactly wanting to do an odd
                  turn, so that at last he came to be depended on for many little inferior offices,
                  which he rendered with a goodwill none the less cheerful because of his
                  silence.</p>
               <p>"There 's time enough to think about what Horace is to do another year," said my
                  grandfather, having reflected some moments after the passage of arms between my
                  grandmother and Aunt Lois. "He 's got to have some schooling. The boys had both
                  better go to school for this winter, and then we 'll see what next."</p>
               <p>"Well, I just mentioned about Ebal Scran, because he 's a good man to take a boy,
                  and he wants one now. If we don't take that chance it may not come again."</p>
               <p>"Wal, Miss Lois," said Sam Lawson, who had sat silent in a dark corner of the
                  chimney, "ef I was to say about Horace, I 'd say he 'd do better for somethin'
                  else 'n shoemakin'. He 's the most amazin' little fellow to read I ever see. As
                  much as a year ago Jake Marshall and me and the other fellers round to the store
                  used to like to get him to read the Columbian Sentinel to us; he did it off
                  slicker than any on us could, he did,—there wa' n't no kind o' word could stop
                  him. I should say such a boy as that ought to have a liberal education."</p>
               <p>"And who 's going to pay for it?" said Aunt Lois, turning round on him sharply. "I
                  suppose you know it costs something to get a man through college. <emph>We</emph>
                  never can afford to send him to college. It 's all we can do to bring his Uncle
                  Bill through."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said my grandmother, "there 's no use worrying the child, one way or
                  the other."</p>
               <p>"They can both go to district school this winter," said my grandfather.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Aunt Lois, "the other day I found him down in a corner humping his
                  back out over a Latin grammar that I 'd put away with all the rest of his father's
                  books on the back side of the upper shelf in our closet, and I took it away from
                  him. If he was going to college, why, it 's well enough to study for it; but if he
                  is n't we don 't want him idlin' round with scraps of Latin in his head like old
                  Jock Twitchel,—got just Latin enough to make a fool of his English, and he 's
                  neither one thing nor another."</p>
               <p>"I do wonder, Lois, what there is under the sun that you don't feel called to see
                  to," said my grandmother. "What do you want<pb n="254-255"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000132"/> to quarrel with the child for? He shall have his
                  Latin grammar if he wants it, and any of the rest of his father's books, poor
                  child. I s'pose he likes 'em because they were his poor father's."</p>
               <p>I leaped for joy in my grandmother's lap, for my father's precious books had been
                  in a state of blockade ever since we had been in the house, and it was only by
                  putting a chair on a table one day, when Aunt Lois and my mother were out, that I
                  had managed to help myself to the Latin grammar, out of which my father had begun
                  to teach me before he died.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said Aunt Lois, "at any rate it 's eight o'clock, and time these
                  boys went to bed."</p>
               <p>Upon this hint Harry and I went to our little bedroom without the ceremony of a
                  candle. It was a frosty autumn night, but a good, clear square of moonlight lay on
                  the floor.</p>
               <p>Now Harry, in common with many other very quiet-natured people, was remarkable for
                  a peculiar persistency in all his ways and manners. Ever since I had roomed with
                  him, I had noticed with a kind of silent wonder the regularity of his nightly
                  devotional exercises, to which he always addressed himself before he went to bed,
                  with an appearance of simple and absorbed fervor, kneeling down by the bed, and
                  speaking in a low, earnest tone of voice, never seeming to hurry or to abbreviate,
                  as I was always inclined to do whenever I attempted similar performances. In fact,
                  as usually I said no prayers at all, there was often an awkward pause and
                  stillness on my part, while I watched and waited for Harry to be through with his
                  devotions, so that I might resume the thread of worldly conversation.</p>
               <p>Now to me the perseverance with which he performed these nightly exercises was
                  unaccountable. The doctrines which in that day had been gaining ground in New
                  England, with regard to the utter inutility and unacceptableness of any prayers or
                  religious doings of the unregenerate, had borne their legitimate fruits
                     <unclear>in causing</unclear> parents to become less and less particular in
                  cultivating <unclear>early</unclear> habits of devotion in children; and so, when
                  I had a room to myself, my mother had ceased to take any oversight of my religious
                  exercises; and as I had overheard my Aunt Lois maintaining very stringently that
                  there was no use in it so long as my heart was not changed, I very soon dropped
                  the form. So, when night after night I noticed Harry going on with his devotions,
                  it seemed to me, from my more worldly point of view, that he gave himself a great
                  deal of unnecessary trouble, particularly if, after all, his prayers did no good.
                  I thought I would speak with him about it, and accordingly this night I said to
                  him, "Harry, do you think it does any good to say your prayers?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I do," he said.</p>
               <p>"But if your heart has n't been changed, your prayer is an abomination to the
                  Lord. Aunt Lois says so," I said, repeating a Scriptural form I had often heard
                  quoted.</p>
               <p>Harry turned over, and in the fading daylight I saw his eyes, large, clear, and
                  tranquil. There was not the shadow of a cloud in them. "I don't know anything
                  about that," he said quietly. "You see I don't believe that sort of talk. God is
                  our Father; he loves us. If we want things, and ask him for them, he will give
                  them to us if it is best; mother always told me so, and I find it is so. I
                  promised her always to say these prayers, and to believe that God loves us. I
                  always shall."</p>
               <p>"Do you <emph>really</emph> think so, Harry?" I said.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes; to be sure I do."</p>
               <p>"I mean, do you ever ask God for things you want? I don't mean saying prayers, but
                  asking for anything."</p>
               <p>"Of course I do. I always have, and he gives them to me. He always has taken care
                  of me, and he always will."</p>
               <p>"Now, Harry," said I, "I want to go to college, and Aunt Lois says there is n't
                  any money to send me there. She wants mother to bind me out to a shoemaker; and I
                  'd rather die than do that. I love to study, and I mean to learn. Now do you
                  suppose if I ask God he will help me?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly he will," said Harry, with an incredible firmness and quietness of
                  manner. "Just you try it."</p>
               <p>"Don't you want to study and go to college?" said I.</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do. I ask God every night that I may <emph>if it is best,</emph>" he
                  said with simplicity.</p>
               <p>"It will be a great deal harder for you than for me," I said, "because you have
                  n't any relations."</p>
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7953-00000133"/>
               <p>"Yes, but God <emph>can</emph> do anything he pleases," said Harry, with a sort of
                  energetic simplicity.</p>
               <p>The confidence expressed in his manner produced a kind of effect upon me. I had
                  urgent needs, too,—longings which I was utterly helpless ever to
                  fulfil,—particularly that visionary desire to go to college and get an education.
                  "Harry," I said, "you ask God that I may go to college."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will," he answered,—"I 'll ask every night. But then," he added, turning
                  over and looking at me, "why don't you ask yourself, Horace?"</p>
               <p>It was difficult for me to answer that question. I think that the differences
                  among human beings in the natural power of <emph>faith</emph> are as great as any
                  other constitutional diversity, and that they begin in childhood. Some are born
                  believers, and some are born sceptics. I was one of the latter. There was an
                  eternal query,—an habitual interrogation-point to almost every proposition in my
                  mind, even from childhood,—a habit of looking at everything from so many sides,
                  that it was difficult to get a settled assent to anything.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the curious kind of double life that I led confirmed this sceptical
                  tendency. I was certain that I constantly saw and felt things, the assertion of
                  whose existence as I saw them drew down on me stinging reproofs and radical doubts
                  of my veracity. This led me to distrust my own perceptions on all subjects, for I
                  was no less certain of what I saw and felt in the spiritual world than of what I
                  saw and felt in the material; and, if I could be utterly mistaken in the one, I
                  could also be in the other.</p>
               <p>The repression and silence about this which became the habit of my life formed a
                  covering for a constant wondering inquiry. The habit of reserve on these subjects
                  had become so intense, that even to Harry I never spoke of it. I think I loved
                  Harry more than I loved anything; in fact, before he came to us, I do not think I
                  knew anything of love as a sentiment. My devotion to my father resembled the
                  blind, instinctive worship of a dog for his master. My feeling toward my mother
                  and grandmother was that impulse of want that induces a chicken to run to a hen in
                  any of its little straits. It was an animal instinct,—a commerce of helplessness
                  with help.</p>
               <p>For Harry I felt a sort of rudimentary, poetical tenderness, like the love of man
                  for woman. I admired his clear blue eyes, his curling golden hair, his fair, pure
                  complexion, his refined and quiet habits, and a sort of unconsciousness of self
                  that there was about him. His simplicity of nature was incorruptible; he seemed
                  always to speak, without disguise, exactly what he thought, without the least
                  apparent consideration of anything but its truth; and this gave him a strange air
                  of innocency. A sort of quaint humor always bubbling up in little quiet looks and
                  ways, and in harmless practical jokes, gave me a constant sense of amusement in
                  his society.</p>
               <p>As the reader may have observed, we were a sharp-cut and peculiar set in our
                  house, and sometimes, when the varied scenes of family life below stairs had
                  amused Harry more than common, he would, after we had got into our chamber by
                  ourselves, break into a sudden flow of mimicry,—imitating now Aunt Lois's sharp,
                  incisive movements and decided tones, or flying about like my venerated
                  grandmother in her most confused and hurried moments, or presenting a perfect
                  image of Uncle Fliakim's frisky gyrations, till he would set me into roars of
                  laughter; when he would turn gravely round and ask what I was laughing at. He
                  never mentioned a name, or made remarks about the persons indicated,—the sole
                  reflection on them was the absurd truthfulness of his imitation; and when I would
                  call out the name he would look at me with eyes brimful of mischief, but in utter
                  silence.</p>
               <p>Generally speaking, his language was characterized by a peculiar nicety in the
                  selection of words, and an avoidance of clownish or vulgar phraseology, and was
                  such as marks a child whose early years have all been passed in the intercourse of
                  refined society; but sometimes he would absurdly introduce into his conversation
                  scraps from Sam Lawson's vocabulary, with flashes of mimicry of his shambling
                  gait, and the lanky droop of his hands; yet these shifting flashes of imitation
                  were the only comment he ever made upon him.</p>
               <p>After Harry began to share my apartment, my nightly visions became less frequent,
                  because, perhaps, instead of lying wide-awake<pb n="258-259"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000134"/> awake expecting them, I had him to talk to. Once or
                  twice, indeed, I saw standing by him, after he had fallen asleep, that same woman
                  whose blue eyes and golden hair I had remarked when we were lost in the forest.
                  She looked down on him with an inexpressible tenderness, and seemed to bless him;
                  and I used to notice that he spoke oftener of his mother the next day, and quoted
                  her words to me with the simple, unquestioning veneration which he always showed
                  for them.</p>
               <p>One thing about Harry which was striking to me, and which he possessed in common
                  with many still, retiring people, was great vigor in maintaining his
                  individuality. It has been the experience of my life that it is your quiet people
                  who, above all other children of men, are set in their ways and intense in their
                  opinions. Their very reserve and silence are a fortification behind which all
                  their peculiarities grow and thrive at their leisure, without encountering those
                  blows and shocks which materially modify more outspoken natures. It is owing to
                  the peculiar power of quietness that one sometimes sees characters fashioning
                  themselves in a manner the least to be expected from the circumstances and
                  associates which surround them. As a fair white lily grows up out of the bed of
                  meadow muck, and, without note or comment, rejects all in the soil that is alien
                  from her being, and goes on fashioning her own silver cup side by side with weeds
                  that are drawing coarser nutriment from the soil, so we often see a refined and
                  gentle nature by some singular internal force unfolding itself by its own laws,
                  and confirming itself in its own beliefs, as wholly different from all that
                  surround it as is the lily from the rag-weed. There are persons, in fact, who seem
                  to grow almost wholly from within, and on whom the teachings, the doctrines, and
                  the opinions of those around them produce little or no impression.</p>
               <p>Harry was modest in his bearing; he never put forth an opinion opposed to those
                  around him, unless a special question was asked him; but, even from early
                  childhood, the opinion of no human being seemed to have much power to modify or
                  alter certain convictions on which his life was based.</p>
               <p>I remember, one Sunday, our good Parson Lothrop took it into his head to preach
                  one of those cool, philosophical sermons in which certain scholarly and rational
                  Christians in easy worldly circumstances seem to take delight,—a sort of preaching
                  which removes the providence of God as far off from human sympathy as it is
                  possible to be. The amount of the matter as he stated it seemed to be, that the
                  Creator had devised a very complicated and thorough-working machine, which he had
                  wound up and set going ages ago, which brought out results with the undeviating
                  accuracy of clock-work. Of course there was the declaration that "not a sparrow
                  falleth to the ground without our Father," and that "the very hairs of our head
                  are numbered," standing square across his way. But we all know that a text of
                  Scripture is no embarrassment at all in the way of a thorough-paced theologian,
                  when he has a favorite idea to establish.</p>
               <p>These declarations were explained as an Oriental, metaphorical way of stating that
                  the All-wise had started a grand world-machine on general laws which included the
                  greatest good to the least of his creation.</p>
               <p>I noticed that Harry sat gazing at him with clear, wide-open eyes and that fixed
                  attention which he always gave to anything of a religious nature. The inference
                  that I drew from it was, that Harry must be mistaken in his confidence in prayer,
                  and that the kind of Fatherly intervention he looked for and asked for in his
                  affairs was out of the question. As we walked home I expected him to say something
                  about it, but he did not. When we were in our room at night, and he had finished
                  his prayers, I said," Harry, did you notice Dr. Lothrop's sermon?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I noticed it," he said.</p>
               <p>"Well, if that is true, what good does it do to pray?"</p>
               <p>"It is n't true," he said, simply.</p>
               <p>"How do you know it is n't?"</p>
               <p>"O, I <emph>know</emph> better," he said.</p>
               <p>"But, Harry,—Dr. Lothrop, you know,—why, he 's the minister,"—and what could a boy
                  of that day say more?</p>
               <p>"He 's mistaken there, though," said Harry, quietly, as he would speak of a man
                  who denied the existence of the sun or moon. He was too positive and too settled
                  to be in any frame to<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7953-00000135"/> argue about it,
                  and the whole of the discourse, which had seemed to me so damaging to his
                  opinions, melted over him like so much moonshine. He fell asleep saying to
                  himself, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want," and I lay awake, wondering
                  in my own mind whether this was the way to live, and, if it were, why my
                  grandmother and Aunt Lois, and my father and mother, and all the good people I had
                  ever known, had so many troubles and worries.</p>
               <p>Ages ago, in the green, flowery hollows of the hills of Bethlehem, a young
                  shepherd boy took this view of life, and began his days singing, "The Lord is my
                  shepherd, I shall not want," and ended them by saying, "Thou hast taught me from
                  my youth up, and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works"; and his ten der
                  communings with an unseen Father have come down to our days as witnesses of green
                  pastures and still waters to be found in this weary work-a-day world, open ever to
                  those who are simple-hearted enough to seek them. It would seem to be the most
                  natural thing in the world that the child of an ever-present Father should live in
                  this way,—that weakness and ignorance, standing within call and reach of infinite
                  grace and strength, should lay hold of that divine helpfulness, and grow to it and
                  by it, as the vine climbs upon the rock; but yet such lives are the exception
                  rather than the rule, even among the good. But the absolute faith of Harry's mind
                  produced about him an atmosphere of composure and restfulness which was, perhaps,
                  the strongest attraction that drew me to him. I was naturally nervous, sensitive,
                  excitable, and needed the repose which he gave me. His quiet belief that all would
                  be right had a sort of effect on me, and, although I did not fall into his way of
                  praying, I came to have great confidence in it for him, and to indulge some vague
                  hopes that something good might come of it for me.</p>

               <head type="sub">DAILY LIVING IN OLDTOWN.</head>
               <p>HENCEFORTH my story must be a cord with three strands, inexplicably intertwisted,
                  and appearing and disappearing in their regular intervals, as each occupies for
                  the moment the prominent place. And this threefold cord is composed of myself,
                  Harry, and Tina. To show how the peculiar life of old Massachusetts worked upon
                  us, and determined our growth and character and destinies, is a theme that brings
                  in many personages, many subjects, many accessories. It is strange that no human
                  being grows up who does not so intertwist in his growth the whole idea and spirit
                  of his day, that rightly to dissect out his history would require one to cut to
                  pieces and analyze society, law, religion, the metaphysics and the morals of his
                  times; and, as all these things run back to those of past days, the problem is
                  still further complicated. The humblest human being is the sum total of a column
                  of figures which go back through centuries before he was born.</p>
               <p>Old Crab Smith and Miss Asphyxia, if their biographies were rightly written, would
                  be found to be the result and out-come of certain moral and social forces, justly
                  to discriminate which might puzzle a philosopher. But be not alarmed, reader; I am
                  not going to puzzle you, but to return in the briefest time possible to my
                  story.</p>
               <p>Harry was adopted into our family circle early in the autumn; and, after much
                  discussion, it was resolved in the family synod that he and I should go to the
                  common school in the neighborhood that winter, and out of school-hours share
                  between us certain family tasks or "chores," as they were called at home.</p>
               <p>Our daily life began at four o'clock in the morning, when the tapping of Aunt
                  Lois's imperative heels on the back stairs, and her authoritative rap at our door,
                  dispelled my slumbers. I was<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7953-00000136"/> never much
                  of a sleeper; my slumbers at best were light and cat-like; but Harry required all
                  my help and my nervous wakefulness to get him to open his drowsy blue eyes, which
                  he always did with the most perfectly amiable temper. He had that charming gift of
                  physical good-humor which is often praised as a virtue in children and in grown
                  people, but which is a mere condition of the animal nature. We all know that there
                  are good-natured animals and irritable animals,—that the cow is tranquil and
                  gentle, and the hyena snarly and fretful; but we never think of praising and
                  rewarding the one, or punishing the other, for this obvious conformation. But in
                  the case of the human animal it always happens that he who has the good luck to
                  have a quiet, imperturbable nature has also the further good luck of being praised
                  for it as for a Christian virtue, while he who has the ill fortune to be born with
                  irritable nerves has the further ill fortune of being always considered a sinner
                  on account of it.</p>
               <p>Nobody that has not suffered from such causes can tell the amount of torture that
                  a child of a certain nervous formation undergoes in the mere process of getting
                  accustomed to his body, to the physical forces of life, and to the ways and doings
                  of that world of grown-up people who have taken possession of the earth before
                  him, and are using it, and determined to go on using it, for their own behoof and
                  convenience, in spite of his childish efforts to push in his little individuality
                  and seize his little portion of existence. He is at once laid hold upon by the
                  older majority as an instrument to work out their views of what is fit and proper
                  for himself and themselves; and if he proves a hard-working or creaking
                  instrument, has the further capability of being rebuked and chastened for it.</p>
               <p>My first morning feeling was generally one of anger at the sound of Aunt Lois's
                  heels, worthy soul! I have lived to see the day when the tap of those efficient
                  little instruments has seemed to me a most praiseworthy and desirable sound; but
                  in those days they seemed only to be the reveille by which I was awakened to that
                  daily battle of my will with hers which formed so great a feature in my life. It
                  imposed in the first place the necessity of my quitting my warm bed in a room
                  where the thermometer must have stood below zero, and where the snow, drifting
                  through the loosely framed window, often lay in long wreaths on the floor.</p>
               <p>As Aunt Lois always opened the door and set in a lighted candle, one of my sinful
                  amusements consisted in lying and admiring the forest of glittering frost-work
                  which had been made by our breath freezing upon the threads of the blanket. I
                  sometimes saw rainbow colors in this frost-work, and went off into dreams and
                  fancies about it, which ended in a doze, from which I was awakened, perhaps, by
                  some of the snow from the floor rubbed smartly on my face, and the words, "How
                  many times must you be called?" and opened my eyes to the vision of Aunt Lois
                  standing over me indignant and admonitory.</p>
               <p>Then I would wake Harry. We would spring from the bed and hurry on our clothes,
                  buttoning them with fingers numb with cold, and run down to the back sink-room,
                  where, in water that flew off in icy spatters, we performed our morning ablutions,
                  refreshing our faces and hands by a brisk rub upon a coarse rolling-towel of brown
                  homespun linen. Then with mittens, hats, and comforters, we were ready to turn out
                  with old Cæsar to the barn to help him fodder the cattle. I must say that, when it
                  came to this, on the whole it began to be grand fun for us. As Cæsar went ahead of
                  us with his snow-shovel, we plunged laughing and rolling into the powdery element,
                  with which we plentifully pelted him. Arrived at the barn we climbed, like cats,
                  upon the mow, whence we joyously threw down enough for all his foddering purposes,
                  and with such superabundant good-will in our efforts, that, had need so required,
                  we would have stayed all day and flung off all the hay upon the mow; in fact, like
                  the broomstick in the fable, which would persist in bringing water without rhyme
                  or reason, so we overwhelmed our sable friend with avalanches of hay, which we
                  cast down upon him in an inconsiderate fury of usefulness, and out of which we
                  laughed to see him tear his way, struggling, gesticulating and remonstrating, till
                  his black face shone with perspiration, and his woolly head bristled with hayseeds
                  and morsels of clover.</p>
               <p>Then came the feeding of the hens and chickens and other<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000137"/> poultry, a work in which we especially delighted,
                  going altogether beyond Cæsar in our largesses of corn, and requiring a constant
                  interposition of his authority to prevent our emptying the crib on every single
                  occasion.</p>
               <p>In very severe weather we sometimes found hens or turkeys so overcome with the
                  cold as to require, in Cæsar's view, hospital treatment. This awoke our
                  sympathies, and stimulated our sense of personal importance, and we were never so
                  happy as when trudging back through the snow, following Cæsar with a great
                  cock-turkey lying languidly over his shoulder like a sick baby, his long neck
                  drooping, his wattles, erst so fiery red with pride and valor, now blue and
                  despairing. Great on such occasions were our zeal and excitement, as the cavalcade
                  burst into the kitchen with much noise, and upturning of everything, changing Aunt
                  Lois's quiet arrangements into an impromptu sanitary commission. My grandmother
                  bestirred herself promptly, compounding messes of Indian-meal enlivened with
                  pepper-corns, which were forced incontinently down the long throat, and which in
                  due time acted as a restorative.</p>
               <p>A turkey treated in this way soon recovered his wonted pride of demeanor, and,
                  with an ingratitude which is like the ways of this world, would be ready to bully
                  my grandmother and fly at her back when she was picking up chips, and charge down
                  upon us children with vociferous gobblings, the very first warm day afterwards.
                  Such toils as these before breakfast gave a zest to the smoking hot brown bread,
                  the beans and sausages, which formed our morning meal.</p>
               <p>The great abundance of <emph>food</emph> in our New England life is one subject
                  quite worthy of reflection, if we consider the hardness of the soil, the extreme
                  severity of the climate, and the shortness of the growing season between the late
                  frosts of spring and those of early autumn. But, as matter of fact, good, plain
                  food was everywhere in New England so plentiful, that at the day I write of nobody
                  could really suffer for the want of it. The theocracy of New England had been so
                  thoroughly saturated with the humane and charitable spirit of the old laws of
                  Moses, in which, dealing "bread to the hungry" is so often reiterated and enforced
                  as foremost among human duties, that no one ever thought of refusing food to any
                  that appeared to need it; and a traveller might have walked on foot from one end
                  of New England to the other, as sure of a meal in its season as he was that he saw
                  a farm-house. Even if there was now and then a Nabal like Crab Smith, who, from a
                  native viciousness, hated to do kindness, there was always sure to be in his
                  family an Abigail, ashamed of his baseness, who redeemed the credit of the house
                  by a surreptitious practice of the Christian virtues.</p>
               <p>I mention all this because it strikes me, in review of my childhood, that,
                  although far from wealth, and living in many respects in a hard and rough way, I
                  remember great enjoyment in that part of our physical life so important to a
                  child,—the eating and drinking. Our bread, to be sure, was the black compound of
                  rye and Indian which the economy of Massachusetts then made the common form,
                  because it was the result of what could be most easily raised on her hard and
                  stony soil; but I can inform all whom it may concern that rye and Indian bread
                  smoking hot, on a cold winter morning, together with savory sausages, pork, and
                  beans, formed a breakfast fit for a king, if the king had earned it by getting up
                  in a cold room, washing in ice-water, tumbling through snow-drifts, and foddering
                  cattle. We partook of it with a thorough cheeriness; and black Cæsar, seated on
                  his block in the chimney-corner, divided his rations with Bose, the yellow dog of
                  our establishment, with a contentment which it was pleasant to behold.</p>
               <p>After breakfast grandfather conducted family prayers, commencing always by reading
                  his chapter in the Bible. He read regularly through in course, as was the custom
                  in those days, without note, comment, or explanation. Among the many insensible
                  forces which formed the minds of New England children, was this constant, daily
                  familiarity with the letter of the Bible. It was for the most part read twice a
                  day in every family of any pretensions to respectability, and it was read as a
                  reading-book in every common school,—in both cases without any attempt at
                  explanation. Such parts as explained themselves were left to do so. Such as were
                  beyond our knowledge were still read, and<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7953-00000138"
                  /> left to make what impression they would. For my part, I am impatient of the
                  theory of those who think that nothing that is not understood makes any valuable
                  impression on the mind of a child. I am certain that the constant contact of the
                  Bible with my childish mind was a very great mental stimulant, as it certainly was
                  a cause of a singular and vague pleasure. The wild, poetic parts of the
                  prophecies, with their bold figures, vivid exclamations, and strange Oriental
                  names and images, filled me with a quaint and solemn delight. Just as a child
                  brought up under the shadow of the great cathedrals of the Old World, wandering
                  into them daily, at morning, or eventide, beholding the many-colored windows
                  flamboyant with strange legends of saints and angels, and neither understanding
                  the legends, nor comprehending the architecture, is yet stilled and impressed,
                  till the old minster grows into his growth and fashions his nature, so this
                  wonderful old cathedral book insensibly wrought a sort of mystical poetry into the
                  otherwise hard and sterile life of New England. Its passionate Oriental phrases,
                  its quaint, pathetic stories, its wild, transcendent bursts of imagery, fixed an
                  indelible mark in my imagination. Where Kedar and Tarshish and Pul and Lud,
                  Chittim and the Isles, Dan and Beersheba, were, or what they were, I knew not, but
                  they were fixed stations in my realm of cloud-land. I knew them as well as I knew
                  my grandmother's rocking-chair, yet the habit of hearing of them only in solemn
                  tones, and in the readings of religious hours, gave to them a mysterious charm. I
                  think no New-Englander, brought up under the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >régime</foreign> established by the Puritans, could really estimate how much
                  of himself had actually been formed by this constant face-to-face intimacy with
                  Hebrew literature. It is worthy of remark, too, that, although in details relating
                  to human crime and vice, the Old Bible is the most plain-spoken book conceivable,
                  it never violated the chastity of a child's mind, or stimulated an improper
                  curiosity. I have been astonished in later years to learn the real meaning of
                  passages to which, in family prayers, I listened with innocent gravity.</p>
               <p>My grandfather's prayers had a regular daily form, to which, in time, I became
                  quite accustomed. No man of not more than ordinary capacity ever ministered twice
                  a day the year round, in the office of priest to his family, without soon learning
                  to repeat the same ideas in the same phrases, forming to himself a sort of
                  individual liturgy. My grandfather always prayed standing, and the image of his
                  mild, silvery head, leaning over the top of the high-backed chair, always rises
                  before me as I think of early days. There was no great warmth or fervor in these
                  daily exercises, but rather a serious and decorous propriety. They were Hebraistic
                  in their form; they spoke of Zion and Jerusalem, of the God of Israel, the God of
                  Jacob, as much as if my grandfather had been a veritable Jew; and except for the
                  closing phrase, "for the sake of thy Son, our Saviour," might all have been
                  uttered in Palestine by a well-trained Jew in the time of David.</p>
               <p>When prayers were over every morning, the first move of the day, announced in Aunt
                  Lois's brief energetic phrases, was to "get the boys out of the way." Our dinner
                  was packed in a small splint basket, and we were started on our way to the
                  district school, about a mile distant. We had our sleds with us,—dear winter
                  companions of boys,—not the gayly painted, genteel little sledges with which
                  Boston boys in these days enliven the Common, but rude, coarse fabrics, got up by
                  Cæsar in rainy days out of the odds and ends of old sleigh-runners and such rough
                  boards as he could rudely fashion with saw and hatchet. Such as they were, they
                  suited us well,—mine in particular, because upon it I could draw Tina to school;
                  for already, children as we were, things had naturally settled themselves between
                  us. She was supreme mistress, and I the too happy slave, only anxious to be
                  permitted to do her bidding. With Harry and me she assumed the negligent airs of a
                  little empress. She gave us her books to carry, called on us to tie her shoes,
                  charged us to remember her errands, got us to learn her lessons for her, and to
                  help her out with whatever she had no mind to labor at; and we were only too happy
                  to do it. Harry was the most doting of brothers, and never could look on Tina in
                  any other light than as one whom he must at any price save from every care and
                  every exertion; and as for me, I never dreamed of disputing her supremacy.</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7953-00000139"/>
               <p>One may, perhaps, wonder how a person so extremely aristocratic in all her ideas
                  of female education as Miss Mehitable should commit her little charge to the
                  chance comradeship and unselect society of the district school. But Miss
                  Mehitable, like many another person who has undertaken the task of bringing up a
                  human being, found herself reduced to the doing of a great many things which she
                  had never expected to do. She prepared for her work in the most thorough manner;
                  she read Locke and Milton, and Dr. Gregory's "Legacy to his Daughter," and Mrs.
                  Chapone on the bringing up of girls, to say nothing of Miss Hannah More and all
                  the other wise people; and, after forming some of the most carefully considered
                  and select plans of operation for herself and her little charge, she was at length
                  driven to the discovery that in education, as in all other things, people who
                  cannot do as they would must do as they can. She discovered that a woman between
                  fifty and sixty years of age, of a peculiar nature, and with very fixed, set
                  habits, could not undertake to be the sole companion and educator of a lively,
                  wilful, spirited little pilgrim of mortality, who was as active as a squirrel, and
                  as inconsequent and uncertain in all her movements as a butterfly.</p>
               <p>By some rare good fortune of nature or of grace, she found her little <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">protégée</foreign> already able to read with fluency, and a
                  tolerable mistress of the use of the needle and thimble. Thus she possessed the
                  key of useful knowledge and of useful feminine practice. But truth compels us to
                  state that there appeared not the smallest prospect, during the first few weeks of
                  Miss Mehitable's educational efforts, that she would ever make a good use of
                  either. In vain Miss Mehitable had written a nice card, marking out regular hours
                  for sewing, for reading, for geography and grammar, with suitable intervals of
                  amusement; and in vain Miss Tina, with edifying enthusiasm, had promised, with
                  large eyes and most abundant eloquence, and with many overflowing caresses, to be
                  "so good." Alas! when it came to carrying out the programme, all alone in the old
                  house, Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and all days, Tina gaped
                  and nestled, and lost her thimble and her needle, and was infinite in excuses, and
                  infinite in wheedling caresses, and arguments, enforced with flattering kisses, in
                  favor of putting off the duties now of this hour and then of that, and
                  substituting something more to her fancy. She had a thousand plans of her own for
                  each passing hour, and no end of argument and eloquence to persuade her old friend
                  to follow her ways,—to hear her read an old ballad instead of applying herself to
                  her arithmetic lesson, or listen to her recital of something that she had just
                  picked out of English history, or let her finish a drawing that she was just
                  inspired to commence, or spend a bright, sunny hour in flower-gatherings and
                  rambles by the brown river-side; whence she would return laden with flowers, and
                  fill every vase in the old, silent room till it would seem as if the wilderness
                  had literally blossomed as the rose. Tina's knack for the arranging of vases and
                  twining of vines and sorting of wild-flowers amounted to a species of genius; and,
                  as it was something of which Miss Mehitable had not the slightest comprehension,
                  the child took the lead in this matter with a confident assurance. And, after all,
                  the effect was so cheerful and so delightful, that Miss Mehitable could not find
                  it in her heart to call to the mind of the little wood-fairy how many hours these
                  cheerful decorations had cost.</p>
               <p>Thus poor Miss Mehitable found herself daily being drawn, by the leash that held
                  this gay bird, into all sorts of unseemly gyrations and wanderings, instead of
                  using it to tether the bird to her own well-considered purposes. She could not
                  deny that the child was making her old days pass in a very amusing manner, and it
                  was so much easier to follow the lively little sprite in all her airy ways and
                  caprices, seeing her lively and spirited and happy, than to watch the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> and the yawns and the restlessness that came
                  over her with every effort to conform to the strict letter of the programme, that
                  good Miss Mehitable was always yielding. Every night she went to bed with an
                  unquiet conscience, sensible that, though she had had an entertaining day, she had
                  been letting Tina govern her, instead of governing Tina.</p>
               <p>Over that grave supposed necessity of governing Tina, this excellent woman groaned
                  in spirit on many a night after the<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7953-00000140"/>
                  little wheedling tongue had become silent, and the bright, deluding eyes had gone
                  down under their fringy lashes. "The fact is," said the sad old woman, "Miss
                  Asphyxia spoke the truth. It is a fact, I am not fit to bring up a child. She does
                  rule over me, just as she said she would, and I 'm a poor old fool; but then, what
                  am I to do? She is so bright and sweet and pretty, and I 'm a queer-looking, dry,
                  odd old woman, with nobody to love me if she does n't. If I cross her and tie her
                  to rules, and am severe with her, she won't love me, and I am too selfish to risk
                  that. Besides, only think what came of using severe measures with poor Emily!
                  people can be spoilt by severity just as much as by indulgence, and more
                  hopelessly. But what shall I do?"</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable at first had some hope of supporting and backing up the weaknesses
                  of her own heart by having recourse to Polly's well-known energy. Polly was a
                  veritable dragon of education, and strong in the most efficient articles of faith.
                  Children must have their wills <emph>broken,</emph> as she expressed it, "short
                  off"; they must mind the very first time you speak; they must be kept under and
                  made to go according to rule, and, if they swerved, Polly recommended measures of
                  most sanguinary severity.</p>
               <p>But somehow or other Tina had contrived to throw over this grimmest and most
                  Calvinistic of virgins the glamour of her presence, so that she ruled, reigned,
                  and predominated in the most awful sanctuaries of Polly's kitchen, with a
                  fearfully unconcerned and negligent freedom. She dared to peep into her yeast-jug
                  in the very moment of projection, and to pinch off from her downy puffs of newly
                  raised bread sly morsels for her own cooking experiments; she picked from Polly's
                  very hand the raisins which the good woman was stoning for the most awfully sacred
                  election cake, and resolutely persisted in hanging on her chair and chattering in
                  her ear during the evolution of high culinary mysteries with which the Eleusinian,
                  or any other heathen trumperies of old, were not to be named. Had n't the receipt
                  for election cake been in the family for one hundred years? and was not Polly the
                  sacred ark and tabernacle in which that divine secret resided? Even Miss Mehitable
                  had always been politely requested to step out of the kitchen when Polly was
                  composing her mind for this serious work, but yet Tina neglected her geography and
                  sewing to be present, chattered all the time, as Polly remarked, like a
                  grist-mill, tasted the sugar and spices, and helped herself at intervals to the
                  savory composition as it was gradually being put together, announcing her
                  opinions, and giving Polly her advice, with an effrontery to which Polly's
                  submission was something appalling.</p>
               <p>It really used to seem to Miss Mehitable, as she listened to Polly's dissonant
                  shrieks of laughter from the kitchen, as if that venerable old girl must be
                  slightly intoxicated. Polly's laughter was in truth something quite formidable.
                  All the organs in her which would usually be employed in this exercise were so
                  rusty for want of use, so choked up with theological dust and <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">débris,</foreign> that when brought into exercise they had a
                  wild, grating, dissonant sound, rather calculated to alarm. Miss Mehitable really
                  wondered if this could be the same Polly of whom she herself stood in a certain
                  secret awe, whose premises she never invaded, and whose will over and about her
                  had been always done instead of her own; but if she ventured to open the kitchen
                  door and recall Tina, she was sure to be vigorously snubbed by Polly, who walked
                  over all her own precepts and maxims in the most shameless and astonishing
                  manner.</p>
               <p>Polly, however, made up for her own compliances by heaping up censures on poor
                  Miss Mehitable when Tina had gone to bed at night. When the bright eyes were
                  fairly closed, and the little bewitching voice hushed in sleep, Polly's conscience
                  awoke like an armed man, and she atoned for her own sins of compliance and
                  indulgence by stringently admonishing Miss Mehitable that she must be more
                  particular about that child, and not let her get her own head so much,—most
                  unblushingly ignoring her own share in abetting her transgressions, and covering
                  her own especial sins under the declaration that "<emph>she</emph> never had
                  undertaken to bring the child up,—she had to get along with her the best way she
                  could,—but the child never would make anything if she was let to go on so." Yet,
                  in any particular case that arose,<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7953-00000141"/>
                  Polly was always sure to go over to Tina's side and back her usurpations.</p>
               <p>For example, it is to be confessed that Tina never could or would be got to bed at
                  those hours which are universally admitted to be canonical for well-brought-up
                  children. As night drew on, the little one's tongue ran with increasing fluency,
                  and her powers of entertainment waxed more dizzy and dazzling; and so, oftentimes,
                  as the drizzling, freezing night shut in, and the wind piped and howled lonesomely
                  round the corners of the dusky old mansion, neither of the two forlorn women could
                  find it in her heart to extinguish the little cheerful candle of their dwelling in
                  bed; and so she was to them ballet and opera as she sung and danced, mimicked the
                  dog, mimicked the cat and the hens and the tom-turkey, and at last talked and flew
                  about the room like Aunt Lois, stirred up butter and pshawed like grandma, or
                  invented imaginary scenes and conversations, or improvised unheard-of costumes out
                  of strange old things she had rummaged out of Miss Mehitable's dark closets.
                  Neither of the two worthy women had ever seen the smallest kind of dramatic
                  representation, so that Tina's histrionic powers fascinated them by touching upon
                  dormant faculties, and seemed more wonderful for their utter novelty; and more
                  than once, to the poignant self-reproach of Miss Mehitable, and Polly's most moral
                  indignation, nine o'clock struck, in the inevitable tones of the old family
                  timepiece, before they were well aware what they were doing. Then Tina would be
                  hustled off to bed, and Polly would preach Miss Mehitable a strenuous discourse on
                  the necessity of keeping children to regular hours, interspersed with fragments of
                  quotations from one of her venerable father's early sermons on the Christian
                  bringing up of households. Polly would grow inexorable as conscience on these
                  occasions, and when Miss Mehitable humbly pleaded in extenuation how charming a
                  little creature it was, and what a pleasant evening she had given, Polly would
                  shake her head, and declare that the ways of sin were always pleasant for a time,
                  but at the last it would "bite like a serpent and sting like an adder"; and when
                  Miss Mehitable, in the most delicate manner, would insinuate that Polly had been
                  sharing the forbidden fruit, such as it was, Polly would flare up in sudden wrath,
                  and declare that "everything that went wrong was always laid to her."</p>
               <p>In consequence of this, though Miss Mehitable found the first few weeks with her
                  little charge altogether the gayest and brightest that had diversified her dreary
                  life, yet there was a bitter sense of self-condemnation and perplexity with it
                  all. One day she opened her mind to my grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Laws a massy! don't try to teach her yourself," said that plain-spoken old
                  individual,—"send her to school with the boys. Children have to go in droves.
                  What's the use of fussing with 'em all day? let the schoolmaster take a part of
                  the care. Children have to be got rid of sometimes, and we come to them all the
                  fresher for having them out of our sight."</p>
               <p>The consequence was, that Tina rode to school on our sleds in triumph, and made
                  more fun, and did more mischief, and learned less, and was more adored and
                  desired, than any other scholar of us all.</p>

               <p>ONE of my most vivid childish remembrances is the length of our winters, the depth
                  of the snows, the raging fury of the storms that used to whirl over the old
                  farm-house, shrieking and piping and screaming round each angle and corner, and
                  thundering down the chimney in a way that used to threaten to topple all down
                  before it.</p>
               <p>The one great central kitchen fire was the only means of warming known in the
                  house, and duly at nine o'clock every night <emph>that</emph> was raked up, and
                  all the family took their way to bed-chambers that never knew a fire, where the
                  very sheets and blankets seemed so full of stinging cold air that they made one's
                  fingers tingle; and where, after getting into bed, there was a prolonged shiver,
                  until one's own internal heat-giving economy had warmed through the whole icy
                  mass. Delicate people had these horrors ameliorated by the application of a brass
                  warming-pan,—an article of high respect and repute in those days, which the modern
                  conveniences for warmth in our houses have entirely banished.</p>
               <p>Then came the sleet storms, when the trees bent and creaked under glittering mail
                  of ice, and every sprig and spray of any kind of vegetation was reproduced in
                  sparkling crystals. These were cold days <foreign xml:lang="FRA">par
                     excellence,</foreign> when everybody talked of the weather as something
                  exciting and tremendous,—when the cider would freeze in the cellar, and the bread
                  in the milk-room would be like blocks of ice,—when not a drop of water could be
                  got out of the sealed well, and the very chimney-back over the raked-up fire would
                  be seen in the morning sparkling with a rime of frost crystals. How the sledges
                  used to squeak over the hard snow, and the breath freeze on the hair, and beard,
                  and woolly comforters around the necks of the men, as one and another brought in
                  news of the wonderful, unheard-of excesses of Jack Frost during the foregone
                  night! There was always something exhilarating about those extremely cold days,
                  when a very forest of logs, heaped up and burning in the great chimney, could not
                  warm the other side of the kitchen; and when Aunt Lois, standing with her back so
                  near the blaze as to be uncomfortably warm, yet found her dish-towel freezing in
                  her hand, while she wiped the teacup drawn from the almost boiling water. When
                  things got to this point, we little folks were jolly. It was an excitement, an
                  intoxication; it filled life full of talk. People froze the tips of their noses,
                  their ears, their toes; we froze our own. Whoever touched a door-latch
                  incautiously, in the early morning, received a skinning bite from Jack. The axe,
                  the saw, the hatchet, all the iron tools, in short, were possessed of a cold devil
                  ready to snap out at any incautious hand that meddled with him. What ponderous
                  stalactites of ice used to hang from the eaves, and hung unmelted days, weeks, and
                  months, dripping a little, perhaps, towards noon, but hardening again as night
                  came on! and how long all this lasted! To us children it seemed ages.</p>
               <p>Then came April with here and there a sunny day. A bluebird would be vaguely
                  spoken of as having appeared. Sam Lawson was usually the first to announce the
                  fact, to the sharp and sceptical contempt of his helpmeet.</p>
               <p>On a shimmering April morning, with a half-mind to be sunshiny, Sam saw Harry and
                  myself trotting by his door, and called to us for a bit of gossip.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, boys, ain't it pleasant? Why, bless your soul and body, I do believe
                  spring 's a comin', though Hepsy she won't believe it," he said, as he leaned over
                  the fence contemplatively, with the axe in his hand. "I heard a bluebird last
                  week, Jake Marshall and me, when we was goin' over to Hopkinton to see how Ike
                  Saunders is. You know he is down with the measles. I went over to offer to sit up
                  with him. Where be ye goin' this mornin'?"</p>
               <p>"We 're going to the minister's. Grandfather is n't well, and Lady Lothrop told us
                  to come for some wine."</p>
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7953-00000143"/>
               <p>"Jes' so," said Sam. "Wal, now, he orter take something for his stomach's sake,
                  Scriptur' goes in for that. A little good hot spiced wine, it 's jest the thing;
                  and Ma'am Lothrop, she has the very best. Why, some o' that 'ere wine o' hern come
                  over from England years ago, when her fust husband was living; and he was a man
                  that knew where to get his things. Wal, you must n't stop to play; allers remember
                  when you 're sent on errands not to be a idlin' on the road."</p>
               <p>"Sam Lawson, will you split me that oven-wood or won't you?" said a smart,
                  cracking voice, as the door flew open and Hepsy's thin face and snapping black
                  eyes appeared, as she stood with a weird, wiry, sharp-visaged baby exalted on one
                  shoulder, while in the other hand she shook a dish-cloth.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, Hepsy, I 'm splittin' as fast as I can. There run along, boys; don't
                  stop to play."</p>
               <p>We ran along, for, truth to say, the vision of Hepsy's sharp features always
                  quickened our speed, and we heard the loud, high-pitched storm of matrimonial
                  objurgation long after we had left them behind.</p>
               <p>Timidly we struck the great knocker, and with due respect and modesty told our
                  errand to the black doctor of divinity who opened the door.</p>
               <p>"I 'll speak to Missis," he said; "but this 'ere 's Missis' great day; it 's Good
                  Friday, and she don't come out of her room the whole blessed day."</p>
               <p>"But she sent word that we should come," we both answered in one voice.</p>
               <p>"Well, you jest wait here while I go up and see,"—and the important messenger
                  creaked up stairs on tiptoe with infinite precaution, and knocked at a chamber
                  door.</p>
               <p>Now there was something in all this reception that was vaguely solemn and
                  impressive to us. The minister's house of itself was a dignified and august place.
                  The minister was in our minds great and greatly to be feared, and to be had in
                  reverence of them that were about him. The minister's wife was a very great lady,
                  who wore very stiff silks, and rode in a coach, and had no end of unknown wealth
                  at her control, so ran the village gossip. And now what this mysterious Good
                  Friday was, and why the house was so still, and why the black doctor of divinity
                  tiptoed up stairs so stealthily, and knocked at her door so timidly, we could not
                  exactly conjecture;—it was all of a piece with the general marvellous and
                  supernatural character of the whole establishment.</p>
               <p>We heard above the silvery well-bred tones that marked Lady Lothrop.</p>
               <p>"Tell the children to come up."</p>
               <p>We looked at each other, and each waited a moment for the other to lead the way;
                  finally I took the lead, and Harry followed. We entered a bedroom shaded in a
                  sombre gloom which seemed to our childish eyes mysterious and impressive. There
                  were three windows in the room, but the shutters were closed, and the only light
                  that came in was from heart-shaped apertures in each one. There was in one corner
                  a tall, solemn-looking, high-post bedstead with heavy crimson draperies. There
                  were heavy carved bureaus and chairs of black, solid oak.</p>
               <p>At a table covered with dark cloth sat Lady Lothrop, dressed entirely in black,
                  with a great Book of Common Prayer spread out before her. The light from the
                  heart-shaped hole streamed down upon this prayer-book in a sort of dusky shaft,
                  and I was the more struck and impressed because it was not an ordinary volume, but
                  a great folio bound in parchment, with heavy brass knobs and clasps, printed in
                  black-letter, of that identical old edition first prepared in King Edward's time,
                  and appointed to be read in churches. Its very unusual and antique appearance
                  impressed me with a kind of awe.</p>
               <p>There was at the other end of the room a tall, full-length mirror, which, as we
                  advanced, duplicated the whole scene, giving back faithfully the image of the
                  spare figure of Lady Lothrop, her grave and serious face, and the strange old book
                  over which she seemed to be bending, with a dusky gleaming of crimson draperies in
                  the background.</p>
               <p>"Come here, my children," she said, as we hesitated; "how is your
                  grandfather?"</p>
               <p>"He is not so well to-day; and grandmamma said—"</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7953-00000144"/>
               <p>"Yes, yes; I know," she said, with a gentle little wave of the hand; "I desired
                  that you might be sent for some wine; Pompey shall have it ready for you. But tell
                  me, little boys, do you know what day this is?"</p>
               <p>"It's Friday, ma'am," said I, innocently.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my child; but do you know <emph>what</emph> Friday it is?" she said.</p>
               <p>"No, ma'am," said I, faintly.</p>
               <p>"Well, my child, it is Good Friday; and do you know why it is called Good
                  Friday?"</p>
               <p>"No, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"This is the day when our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ died on the cross for our
                  salvation; so we call it Good Friday."</p>
               <p>I must confess that these words struck me with a strange and blank amazement. That
                  there had been in this world a personage called "Our Lord and Saviour Jesus
                  Christ," I had learned from the repetition of his name as the usual ending of
                  prayers at church and in the family; but the real literal fact that he had lived
                  on earth had never presented itself to me in any definite form before; but this
                  solemn and secluded room, this sombre woman shut out from all the ordinary ways of
                  the world, devoting the day to lonely musing, gave to her words a strange
                  reality.</p>
               <p>"When did he die?" I said.</p>
               <p>"More than a thousand years ago," she answered.</p>
               <p>Insensibly Harry had pressed forward till he stood in the shaft of light, which
                  fell upon his golden curls, and his large blue eyes now had that wide-open,
                  absorbed expression with which he always listened to anything of a religious
                  nature, and, as if speaking involuntarily, he said eagerly, "But he is not dead.
                  He is living; and we pray to him."</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, my son," said Lady Lothrop, turning and looking with pleased surprise,
                  which became more admiring as she gazed,—"yes, he rose from the dead."</p>
               <p>"I know. Mother told me all about that. Day after tomorrow will be Easter day,"
                  said Harry; "I remember."</p>
               <p>A bright flush of pleased expression passed over Lady Lothrop's face as she said,
                  "I am glad, my boy, that <emph>you</emph> at least have been taught. Tell me,
                  boys," she said at last, graciously, "should you like to go with me in my carriage
                  to Easter Sunday, in Boston?"</p>
               <p>Had a good fairy offered to take us on the rainbow to the palace of the sunset,
                  the offer could not have seemed more unworldly and dream-like. What Easter Sunday
                  was I had not the faintest idea, but I felt it to be something vague, strange, and
                  remotely suggestive of the supernatural.</p>
               <p>Harry, however, stood the thing in the simple, solemn, gentlemanlike way which was
                  habitual with him.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, ma'am, I shall be very happy, if grandmamma is willing."</p>
               <p>It will be seen that Harry slid into the adoptive familiarity which made my
                  grandmother his, with the easy good faith of childhood.</p>
               <p>"Tell your grandmamma if she is willing I shall call for you in my coach
                  to-morrow,"—and we were graciously dismissed.</p>
               <p>We ran home in all haste with our bottle of wine, and burst into the kitchen,
                  communicating our message both at once to Aunt Lois and Aunt Keziah. The two women
                  looked at each other mysteriously; there was a slight flush on Aunt Lois's keen,
                  spare face.</p>
               <p>"Well, if she's a mind to do it, Kezzy, I don't see how we can refuse."</p>
               <p>"Mother never would consent in the world," said Aunt Keziah.</p>
               <p>"Mother <emph>must</emph>," said Aunt Lois, with decision. "We can't afford to
                  offend Lady Lothrop, with both these boys on our hands. Besides, now father is
                  sick, what a mercy to have 'em both out of the house for a Sunday!"</p>
               <p>Aunt Lois spoke this with an intensive earnestness that deepened my already strong
                  convictions that we boys were a daily load upon her life, only endured by a high
                  and protracted exercise of Christian fortitude.</p>
               <p>She rose and tapped briskly into the bedroom where my grandmother was sitting
                  reading by my grandfather's bed. I heard her making some rapid statements in a
                  subdued, imperative tone. There were a few moments of a sort of suppressed,<pb
                     n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7953-00000145"/> earnest hum of conversation, and soon
                  we heard sundry vehement interjections from my grandmother,—"Good
                  Friday!—Easter!—pish, Lois!—don't tell me!—old cast-off rags of the scarlet
                  woman,—nothing else. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'Abhor the arrant whore of Rome,</l>
                        <l>And all her blasphemies;</l>
                        <l>Drink not of her accursed cup,</l>
                        <l>Obey not her decrees.' "</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Now, mother, how absurd!" I heard Aunt Lois say. "Who 's talking about Rome? I'm
                  sure, if Dr. Lothrop can allow it, we can. It 's all nonsense to talk so. We don't
                  want to offend our minister's wife; we must do the things that make for peace";
                  and then the humming went on for a few moments more and more earnestly, till
                  finally we heard grandmother break out:—</p>
               <p>"Well, well, have it your own way, Lois,—you always did and always will, I
                  suppose. Glad the boys 'll have a holiday, anyhow. She means well, I dare
                  say,—thinks she 's doing right."</p>
               <p>I must say that this was a favorite formula with which my grandmother generally
                  let herself down from the high platform of her own sharply defined opinions to the
                  level of Christian charity with her neighbors.</p>
               <p>"Who is the whore of Rome?" said Harry to me, confidentially, when we had gone to
                  our room to make ready for our jaunt the next day.</p>
               <p>"Don't you know?" said I. "Why, it 's the one that burnt John Rogers, in the
                  Catechism. I can show it to you"; and, forthwith producing from my small stock of
                  books my New England Primer, I called his attention to the picture of Mr. John
                  Rogers in gown and bands, standing in the midst of a brisk and voluminous coil of
                  fire and smoke, over which an executioner, with a supernatural broadaxe upon his
                  shoulders, seemed to preside with grim satisfaction. There was a woman with a baby
                  in her arms and nine children at her side, who stood in a row, each head being
                  just a step lower than the preceding, so that they made a regular flight of
                  stairs. The artist had represented the mother and all the children with a sort of
                  round bundle on each of their heads, of about the same size as the head itself,—a
                  thing which I always interpreted as a further device of the enemy in putting
                  stones on their heads to crush them down; and I pointed it out to Harry as an
                  aggravating feature of the martyrdom.</p>
               <p>"Did the whore of Rome do that?" said Harry, after a few moments' reflection.</p>
               <p>"Yes, she did, and it tells about it in the poetry which he wrote here to his
                  children the night before his execution"; and forthwith I proceeded to read to
                  Harry that whole poetical production, delighted to find a gap in his education
                  which I was competent to fill. We were both wrought up into a highly Protestant
                  state by reading this.</p>
               <p>"Horace," said Harry, timidly, "<emph>she</emph> would n't like such things, would
                  she? she is such a good woman."</p>
               <p>"What, Lady Lothrop? of course she 's a good woman; else she would n't be our
                  minister's wife."</p>
               <p>"What was grandma talking about?" said Harry.</p>
               <p>"O, I don't know; grandmother talks about a great many things," said I. "At any
                  rate, we shall see Boston, and I 've always wanted to see Boston. Only think,
                  Harry, we shall go in a coach!"</p>
               <p>This projected tour to Boston was a glorification of us children in the eyes of
                  the whole family. To go, on the humblest of terms, <emph>to Boston,</emph>—but to
                  be taken thither in Lady Lothrop's coach, to be trotted in magnificently behind
                  her fat pair of carriage-horses,—that was a good fortune second only to
                  translation.</p>
               <p>Boston lay at an easy three hours' ride from Oldtown, and Lady Lothrop had
                  signified to my grandmother that we were to be called for soon after dinner. We
                  were to spend the night and the Sunday following at the house of Lady Lothrop's
                  mother, who still kept the old family mansion at the north end, and Lady Lothrop
                  was graciously pleased to add that she would keep the children over Easter Monday,
                  to show them Boston. Faithful old soul, she never omitted the opportunity of
                  reminding the gainsaying community among whom her lot was cast of the solemn days
                  of her church and for one <emph>I</emph> have remembered Easter Sunday and Monday
                  to this day.</p>

               <p>Our good fortune received its crowning stroke in our eyes when, running over to
                  Miss Mehitable's with the news, we found that Lady Lothrop had considerately
                  included Tina in the invitation.</p>
               <p>"Well, she must like children better than I do," was Aunt Lois's comment upon the
                  fact, when we announced it. "Now, boys, mind and behave yourselves like young
                  gentlemen," she added, "for you are going to one of the oldest families of Boston,
                  among real genteel people."</p>
               <p>"They 're Tories, Lois," put in Aunt Keziah, apprehensively.</p>
               <p>"Well, what of that? that thing 's over and gone now," said Aunt Lois, "and nobody
                  lays it up against the Kitterys, and everybody knows they were in the very first
                  circles in Boston before the war, and connected with the highest people in
                  England, so it was quite natural they should be Tories."</p>
               <p>"I should n't wonder if Lady Widgery should be there," said Aunt Keziah, musingly,
                  as she twitched her yarn; "she always used to come to Boston about this time o'
                  the year."</p>
               <p>"Very likely she will," said my mother. "What relation is she to Lady
                  Lothrop?"</p>
               <p>"Why, bless me, don't you know?" said Aunt Lois. "Why, she was Polly Steadman, and
                  sister to old Ma'am Kittery's husband's first wife. She was second wife to Sir
                  Thomas; his first wife was one of the Keatons of Penshurst, in England; she died
                  while Sir Thomas was in the custom-house; she was a poor, sickly thing. Polly was
                  a great beauty in her day. People said he admired her rather too much before his
                  wife died, but I don't know how that was."</p>
               <p>"I wonder what folks want to say such things for," quoth my grandmother. "I hate
                  backbiters, for my part."</p>
               <p>"We are n't backbiting, mother. I only said how the story ran. It was years ago,
                  and poor Sir Thomas is in his grave long ago."</p>
               <p>"Then you might let him rest there," said my grandmother. "Lady Widgery was a
                  pleasant-spoken woman, I remember."</p>
               <p>"She's quite an invalid now, I heard," said Aunt Lois. "Our Bill was calling at
                  the Kitterys' the other day, and Miss Deborah Kittery spoke of expecting Lady
                  Widgery. The Kitterys have been very polite to Bill; they 've invited him there to
                  dinner once or twice this winter. That was one reason why I thought we ought to be
                  careful how we treat Lady Lothrop's invitation. It's entirely through her
                  influence that Bill gets these attentions."</p>
               <p>"I don't know about their being the best thing for him," said my grandmother,
                  doubtfully.</p>
               <p>"Mother, how can you talk so? What can be better than for a young man to have the
                  run of good families in Boston?" said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"I'd rather see him have intimacy with one godly minister of old times," said my
                  grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Well, that's what Bill is n't likely to do," quoth Aunt Lois, with a slight shade
                  of impatience. "We must take boys as we find 'em."</p>
               <p>"I have n't anything against Tories or Episcopalians," said my grandmother; "but
                  they ain't our sort of folks. I dare say they mean as well as they know how."</p>
               <p>"Miss Mehitable visits the Kitterys when she is in Boston," said Aunt Lois, "and
                  thinks everything of them. She says that Deborah Kittery is a very smart,
                  intelligent woman,—a woman of a very strong mind."</p>
               <p>"I dare say they 're well enough," said my grandmother. "I 'm sure I wish 'em well
                  with all my heart."</p>
               <p>"Now, Horace," said Aunt Lois, "be careful you don't sniff, and be sure and wipe
                  your shoes on the mat when you come in, and never on any account speak a word
                  unless you are spoken to. Little boys should be seen and not heard; and be very
                  careful you never touch anything you see. It is very good of Lady Lothrop to be
                  willing to take all the trouble of having you with her, and you must make her just
                  as little as possible."</p>
               <p>I mentally resolved to reduce myself to a nonentity, to go out of existence, as it
                  were, to be nobody and nowhere, if only I might escape making trouble.</p>
               <p>"As to Harry, he is always a good, quiet boy, and never touches things, or forgets
                  to wipe his shoes," said my aunt. "I 'm sure he will behave himself."</p>
               <p>My mother colored slightly at this undisguised partiality for<pb n="284-285"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000147"/> Harry, but she was too much under Aunt Lois's
                  discipline to venture a word.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, Mis' Badger, how do ye all do?" said Sam Lawson, this moment
                  appearing at the kitchen door. "I saw your winders so bright, I thought I 'd jest
                  look in and ask after the Deacon. I ben into Miss Mehitable's, and there 's Polly,
                  she telled me about the chillen goin' to Boston to-morrow. Tiny, she's jest flying
                  round and round like a lightning-bug, most out of her head, she's so tickled; and
                  Polly, she was a i'nin' up her white aprons to get her up smart. Polly, she says
                  it 's all pagan flummery about Easter, but she 's glad the chillen are goin' to
                  have the holiday." And with this Sam Lawson seated himself on his usual evening
                  roost in the corner, next to black Cæsar, and we both came and stood by his
                  knee.</p>
               <p>"Wal, boys, now you 're goin' among real, old-fashioned gentility. Them Kitterys
                  used to hold their heads 'mazin' high afore the war, and they 've managed by hook
                  and crook to hold on to most what they got, and now by-gones is by-gones. But I
                  believe they don't go out much, or go into company. Old Ma'am Kittery, she's kind
                  o' broke up about her son that was killed at the Delaware."</p>
               <p>"Fighting on the wrong side, poor woman," said my grandmother. "Well, I s'pose he
                  thought he was doing right."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," said Sam, "there 's all sorts o' folks go to make up a world, and,
                  lordy massy, we must n't be hard on nobody; can't 'spect everybody to be right all
                  round; it's what I tell Polly when she sniffs at Lady Lothrop keepin' Christmas
                  and Easter and sich. 'Lordy massy, Polly,' says I, 'if she reads her Bible, and 's
                  good to the poor, and don't speak evil o' nobody, why, let her have her Easter;
                  what's the harm on 't?' But, lordy massy bless your soul an' body! there 's no
                  kind o' use talkin' to Polly. She fumed away there, over her i'nin' table; she did
                  n't believe in folks that read their prayers out o' books; and then she hed it all
                  over about them tew thousan' ministers that was all turned out o' the church in
                  one day in old King Charles's time. Now, raily, Mis' Badger, I don't see why Lady
                  Lothrop should be held 'sponsible for that are, if she is 'Piscopalian."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said my grandmother; "they did turn out the very best men in
                  England, but the Lord took 'em for seed to plant America with. But no wonder we
                  feel it: burnt children dread the fire. I've nothing against Lady Lothrop, and I
                  don't wish evil to the Episcopalians nor to the Tories. There's good folks among
                  'em all, and 'the Lord knoweth them that are his.' But I do hope, Horace, that,
                  when you get to Boston, you will go out on to Copps Hill and see the graves of the
                  Saints. There are the men that I want my children to remember. You come here, and
                  let me read you about them in my 'Magnaly'<ref rend="super" target="#note_002"
                     xml:id="return_002">*</ref>
                   here." And with this my grandmother produced her well-worn copy; and, to
                  say the truth, we were never tired of hearing what there was in it. What legends,
                  wonderful and stirring, of the solemn old forest life,—of fights with the Indians,
                  and thrilling adventures, and captivities, and distresses,—of encounters with
                  panthers and serpents, and other wild beasts, which made our very hair stand on
                  end! Then there were the weird witch-stories, so wonderfully attested; and how Mr.
                  Peter So-and-so did visibly see, when crossing a river, a cat's head swimming in
                  front of the boat, and the tail of the same following behind; and how worthy
                  people had been badgered and harassed by a sudden friskiness in all their
                  household belongings, in a manner not unknown in our modern days. Of all these
                  fascinating legends my grandmother was a willing communicator, and had, to match
                  them, numbers of corresponding ones from her own personal observation and
                  experience; and sometimes Sam Lawson would chime in with long-winded legends,
                  which, being told by flickering fire-light, with the wind rumbling and tumbling
                  down the great chimney, or shrieking and yelling and piping around every corner of
                  the house, like an army of fiends trying with tooth and claw to get in upon us,
                  had power to send cold chills down our backs in the most charming manner.</p><note place="foot" xml:id="note_002">
                     
                     <p><ref target="#return_002">*</ref>Dr. Cotton Mather's "Magnalia."</p>
                  </note>
               <p>For my part, I had not the slightest fear of the supernatural; it was to me only a
                  delightful stimulant, just crisping the surface of my mind with a pleasing horror.
                  I had not any doubt of the stories of apparitions related by Dr. Cotton, because I
                  had seen<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7953-00000148"/> so many of them myself; and I
                  did not doubt that many of the witnesses who testified in these cases really
                     <emph>did see</emph> what they said they saw, as plainly as I had seen similar
                  appearances. The consideration of the fact that there really are people in whose
                  lives such phenomena are of frequent occurrence seems to have been entirely left
                  out of the minds of those who have endeavored to explain that dark passage in our
                  history.</p>
               <p>In my maturer years I looked upon this peculiarity as something resulting from a
                  physical idiosyncrasy, and I have supposed that such affections may become at
                  times epidemics in communities, as well as any other affection of the brain and
                  nervous system. Whether the things thus discerned have an objective reality or
                  not, has been one of those questions at which, all my life, the interrogation
                  point has stood unerased.</p>
               <p>On this evening, however, my grandmother thought fit to edify us by copious
                  extracts from "The Second Part, entituled <title>Sepher-Jearim,</title> i. e.
                     <title>Liber Deum Timentium;</title> or, Dead Abels;—yet speaking and spoken
                  of."</p>
               <p>The lives of several of these "Dead Abels" were her favorite reading, and to-night
                  she designed especially to fortify our minds with their biographies; so she gave
                  us short dips and extracts here and there from several of them, as, for example:
                     "<title>Janus Nov.-Anglicus;</title> or, The Life of Mr. Samuel
                     Higginson";—"<title>Cadmus Americanus;</title> or, Life of Mr. Charles
                     Chauncey";—"<title>Cygnea Cantio;</title> or, The Death of Mr. John Avery";—"
                     <title>Fulgentius;</title> or, The Life of Mr. Richard Mather"; and
                     "<title>Elisha's Bones;</title> or, Life of Mr. Henry Whitefield."</p>
               <p>These Latin titles stimulated my imagination like the sound of a trumpet, and I
                  looked them out diligently in my father's great dictionary, and sometimes
                  astonished my grandmother by telling her what they meant.</p>
               <p>In fact, I was sent to bed that night thoroughly fortified against all seductions
                  of the gay and worldly society into which I was about to be precipitated; and my
                  reader will see that there was need enough of this preparation.</p>
               <p>All these various conversations in regard to differences of religion went on
                  before us children with the freedom with which older people generally allow
                  themselves to go on in the presence of the little non-combatants of life. In those
                  days, when utter silence and reserve in the presence of elders was so forcibly
                  inculcated as one of the leading virtues of childhood, there was little
                  calculation made for the effect of such words on the childish mind. With me it was
                  a perfect hazy mist of wonder and bewilderment; and I went to sleep and dreamed
                  that John Rogers was burning Lady Lothrop at the stake, and Polly, as executioner,
                  presided with a great broadaxe over her shoulder, while grandmother, with nine
                  small children, all with stone bundles on their heads, assisted at the
                  ceremony.</p>
               <p>Our ride to Boston was performed in a most proper and edifying manner. Lady
                  Lothrop sat erect and gracious on the back seat, and placed Harry, for whom she
                  seemed to have conceived a special affection, by her side. Tina was perched on the
                  knee of my lady's maid, a starched, prim woman who had grown up and dried in all
                  the most sacred and sanctified essences of genteel propriety. She was the very
                  crispness of old-time decorum, brought up to order herself lowly and reverently to
                  all her betters, and with a secret conviction that, aside from Lady Lothrop, the
                  whole of the Oldtown population were rather low Dissenters, whom she was required
                  by the rules of Christian propriety to be kind to. To her master, as having been
                  honored with the august favor of her mistress's hand, she looked up with respect,
                  but her highest mark of approbation was in the oft-repeated burst which came from
                  her heart in moments of confidential enthusiasm,—"Ah, ma'am, depend upon it,
                  master is a churchman in his heart. If 'e 'ad only 'ad the good fortune to be born
                  in Hengland, 'e would 'ave been a bishop!"</p>
               <p>Tina had been talked to and schooled rigorously by Miss Mehitable as to propriety
                  of manner during this ride; and, as Miss Mehitable well knew what a chatterbox she
                  was, she exacted from her a solemn promise that she would only speak when she was
                  spoken to. Being perched in Mrs. Margery's lap, she felt still further the
                  stringent and binding power of that atmosphere of frosty decorum which encircled
                  this immaculate waiting-maid. A more well-bred, inoffensive, reverential little
                  trio never surrounded<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7953-00000149"/> rounded a lady
                  patroness; and as Lady Lothrop was not much of a talker, and, being a childless
                  woman, had none of those little arts of drawing out children which the maternal
                  instinct alone teaches, our ride, though undoubtedly a matter of great enjoyment,
                  was an enjoyment of a serious and even awful character. Lady Lothrop addressed a
                  few kind inquiries to each one of us in turn, to which we each of us replied, and
                  then the conversation fell into the hands of Mrs. Margery, and consisted mainly in
                  precise details as to where and how she had packed her mistress's Sunday cap and
                  velvet dress; in doing which she evinced the great fluency and fertility of
                  language with which women of her class are gifted on the one subject of their
                  souls. Mrs. Margery felt as if the Sunday cap of the only supporter of the true
                  Church in the dark and heathen parish of Oldtown was a subject not to be lightly
                  or unadvisedly considered; and, therefore, she told at great length how she had
                  intended to pack it first all together,—how she had altered her mind and taken off
                  the bow, and packed that in a little box by itself, and laid the strings out flat
                  in the box,—what difficulties had met her in folding the velvet dress,—and how she
                  had at first laid it on top of the trunk, but had decided at last that the black
                  lutestring might go on top of that, because it was so much lighter, &amp;c.,
                  &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Lady Lothrop was so much accustomed to this species of monologue, that it is quite
                  doubtful if she heard a word of it; but poor Tina, who felt within herself whole
                  worlds of things to say, from the various objects upon the road, of which she was
                  dying to talk and ask questions, wriggled and twisted upon Mrs. Margery's knee,
                  and finally gave utterance to her pent-up feelings in deep sighs.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter, little dear?" said Lady Lothrop.</p>
               <p>"O dear! I was just wishing I could go to church."</p>
               <p>"Well, you are going to-morrow, dear."</p>
               <p>"I just wish I could go now to say <emph>one</emph> prayer."</p>
               <p>"And what is that, my dear?"</p>
               <p>"I just want to say, 'O Lord, open thou my lips,' said Tina, with effusion.</p>
               <p>Lady Lothrop smiled with an air of innocent surprise, and Mrs. Margery winked over
                  the little head.</p>
               <p>"I 'm <emph>so</emph> tired of not talking!" said Tina, pathetically; "but I
                  promised Miss Mehitable I would n't speak unless I was spoken to," she added, with
                  an air of virtuous resolution.</p>
               <p>"Why, my little dear, you <emph>may</emph> talk," said Lady Lothrop. "It won't
                  disturb me at all. Tell us now about anything that interests you."</p>
               <p>"O, thank you ever so much," said Tina; and from this moment, as a little elfin
                  butterfly bursts from a cold, gray chrysalis, Tina rattled and chattered and
                  sparkled, and went on with <emph>verve</emph> and gusto that quite waked us all
                  up. Lady Lothrop and Mrs. Margery soon found themselves laughing with a heartiness
                  which surprised themselves; and, the icy chains of silence being once broken, we
                  all talked, almost forgetting in whose presence we were. Lady Lothrop looked from
                  one to another in a sort of pleased and innocent surprise. Her still, childless,
                  decorous life covered and concealed many mute feminine instincts which now rose at
                  the voice and touch of childhood; and sometimes in the course of our gambols she
                  would sigh, perhaps thinking of her own childless hearth.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">WE BEHOLD GRANDEUR.</head>
               <p>IT was just at dusk that our carriage stood before the door of a respectable
                  mansion at the north end of Boston.</p>
               <p>I remember our alighting and passing through a wide hall with a dark oaken
                  staircase, into a low-studded parlor, lighted by the blaze of a fire of hickory
                  logs, which threw out tongues of yellow flame, and winked at itself with a
                  thousand fanciful flashes, in the crinkles and angles of a singularly high and
                  mighty pair of brass andirons.</p>
               <p>A lovely, peaceful old lady, whose silvery white hair and black dress were the
                  most striking features of the picture, kissed Lady Lothrop, and then came to us
                  with a perfect outgush of motherly kindness. "Why, the poor little dears! the
                  little darlings!" she said, as she began with her trembling fingers to undo Tina's
                  bonnet-strings. "Did they want to come to Boston and see the great city? Well,
                  they should. They must be cold; there, put them close by the fire, and grandma
                  will get them a nice cake pretty soon. Here, I 'll hold the little lady," she
                  said, as she put Tina on her knee.</p>
               <p>The child nestled her head down on her bosom as lovingly and confidingly as if she
                  had known her all her days. "Poor babe," said the old lady to Lady Lothrop, "who
                  could have had a heart to desert such a child? and this is the boy," she said,
                  drawing Harry to her and looking tenderly at him. "Well, a father of the
                  fatherless is God in his holy habitation." There was something even grand about
                  the fervor of this sentence as she uttered it, and Tina put up her hand with a
                  caressing gesture around the withered old neck.</p>
               <p>"Debby, get these poor children a cake," said the lady to a brisk, energetic,
                  rather high-stepping individual, who now entered the apartment.</p>
               <p>"Come now, mother, do let it rest till supper-time. If we let you alone, you would
                  murder all the children in your neighborhood with cake and sugar-plums; you 'd be
                  as bad as King Herod."</p>
               <p>Miss Debby was a well-preserved, up-and-down, positive, cheery, sprightly maiden
                  lady of an age lying somewhere in the indeterminate region between forty and
                  sixty. There was a positive, brusque way about all her movements, and she advanced
                  to the fire, rearranged the wood, picked up stray brands, and whisked up the coals
                  with a brush, and then, seating herself bolt upright, took up the business of
                  making our acquaintance in the most precise and systematic manner.</p>
               <p>"So this is Master Horace Holyoke. How do you do, sir?"</p>
               <p>As previously directed, I made my best bow with anxious politeness.</p>
               <p>"And this is Master Harry Percival, is it?" Harry did the same.</p>
               <p>"And this," she added, turning to Tina, "is Miss Tina Percival, I understand?
                  Well, we are very happy to see <emph>good</emph> little children in this house
                  always." There was a rather severe emphasis on the <emph>good</emph> which,
                  together with the somewhat martial and disciplinary air which invested all Miss
                  Deborah's words and actions, was calculated to strike children with a wholesome
                  awe.</p>
               <p>Our resolution "to be very good indeed" received an immediate accession of
                  strength. At this moment a serving-maid appeared at the door, and, with eyes cast
                  down, and a stiff, respectful courtesy, conveyed the information, "If you please,
                  ma'am, tea is ready."</p>
               <p>This humble, self-abased figure—the utter air of self-abnegation with which the
                  domestic seemed to intimate that, unless her mistress pleased, tea was not ready,
                  and that everything in creation was to be either ready or not ready according to
                  her sovereign will and good pleasure—was to us children a new lesson in
                  decorum.</p>
               <p>"Go tell Lady Widgery that tea is served," said Miss Deborah, in a loud,
                  resounding voice. "Tell her that we will wait her ladyship's convenience."</p>
               <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7953-00000151"/>
               <p>The humble serving-maid courtesied, and closed the door softly with reverential
                  awe. On the whole, the impression upon our minds was deeply solemn; we were about
                  to see her ladyship.</p>
               <p>Lady Widgery was the last rose of summer of the departed aristocracy. Lady
                  Lothrop's title was only by courtesy; but Sir Thomas Widgery was a live baronet;
                  and as there were to be no more of these splendid dispensations in America, one
                  may fancy the tenderness with which old Tory families cherished the last lingering
                  remnants.</p>
               <p>The door was soon opened again, and a bundle of black silk appeared, with a pale,
                  thin face looking out of it. There was to be seen the glitter of a pair of sharp,
                  black eyes, and the shimmer of a thin white hand with a diamond ring upon it.
                  These were the items that made up Lady Widgery, as she dawned upon our childish
                  vision.</p>
               <p>Lest the reader should conceive any false hopes or impressions, I may as well say
                  that it turned out, on further acquaintance, that these items were about all there
                  was of Lady Widgery. It was one of the cases where Nature had picked up a very
                  indifferent and commonplace soul, and shut it up in a very intelligent-looking
                  body. From her youth up, Lady Widgery's principal attraction consisted in looking
                  as if there was a great deal more in her than there really was. Her eyes were
                  sparkling and bright, and had a habit of looking at things in this world with
                  keen, shrewd glances, as if she were thinking about them to some purpose, which
                  she never was. Sometimes they were tender and beseeching, and led her distracted
                  admirers to feel as if she were melting with emotions that she never dreamed of.
                  Thus Lady Widgery had always been rushed for and contended for by the other sex;
                  and one husband had hardly time to be cold in his grave before the air was filled
                  with the rivalry of candidates to her hand; and after all the beautiful little
                  hoax had nothing for it but her attractive soul-case. In her old age she still
                  looked elegant, shrewd, and keen, and undeniably high-bred, and carried about her
                  the prestige of rank and beauty. Otherwise she was a little dry bundle of old
                  prejudices, of faded recollections of past conquests and gayeties, and weakly
                  concerned about her own health, which, in her view and that of everybody about
                  her, appeared a most sacred subject. She had a somewhat entertaining manner of
                  rehearsing the gossip and scandals of the last forty years, and was, so far as
                  such a person could be, religious: that is to say, she kept all the feasts and
                  fasts of the Church scrupulously. She had, in a weakly way, a sense of some
                  responsibility in this matter, because she was Lady Widgery, and because
                  infidelity was prevailing in the land, and it became Lady Widgery to cast her
                  influence against it. Therefore it was that, even at the risk of her precious
                  life, as she thought, she had felt it imperative to come to Boston to celebrate
                  Easter Sunday.</p>
               <p>When she entered the room there was an immediate bustle of welcome. Lady Lothrop
                  ran up to her, saluting her with an appearance of great fondness, mingled, I
                  thought, with a sort of extreme deference. Miss Deborah was pressing in her
                  attentions. "Will you sit a moment before tea to get your feet warm, or will you
                  go out at once? The dining-room is quite warm."</p>
               <p>Lady Widgery's feet were quite warm, and everybody was <emph>so</emph> glad to
                  hear it, that we were filled with wonder.</p>
               <p>Then she turned and fixed her keen, dark eyes on us, as if she were reading our
                  very destiny, and asked who we were. We were all presented circumstantially, and
                  the brilliant eyes seemed to look through us shrewdly, as we made our bows and
                  courtesies. One would have thought that she was studying us with a deep interest,
                  which was not the case.</p>
               <p>We were now marshalled out to the tea-table, where we children had our plates put
                  in a row together, and were waited on with obsequious civility by Mrs. Margery and
                  another equally starched and decorous female, who was the attendant of Lady
                  Widgery. We stood at our places a moment, while the lovely old lady, raising her
                  trembling hand, pronounced the words of the customary grace: "For what we are now
                  about to receive, the Lord make us truly thankful." Her voice trembled as she
                  spoke, and somehow the impression of fragility and sanctity that she made on me
                  awoke in me a sort of tender awe. When the blessing was over, the maids seated us,
                  and I had leisure to notice the entirely new scene about me.</p>
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7953-00000152"/>
               <p>It was all conducted with an inexpressible stateliness of propriety, and, in an
                  undefined way, the impression was produced upon my mind that the frail, shivery,
                  rather thin and withered little being, enveloped in a tangle of black silk wraps,
                  was something inexpressibly sacred and sublime. Miss Deborah waited on her
                  constantly, pressingly, energetically; and the dear, sweet old white-haired lady
                  tended her with obsequiousness, which, like everything else that she did, was lost
                  in lovingness; and Lady Lothrop, to me the most awe-inspiring of the female race,
                  paled her ineffectual fires, and bowed her sacred head to the rustling little
                  black silk bundle, in a way that made me inwardly wonder. The whole scene was so
                  different from the wide, rough, noisy, free-and-easy democracy of my grandmother's
                  kitchen, that I felt crusted all over with an indefinite stiffness of
                  embarrassment, as if I had been dipped in an alum-bath. At the head of the table
                  there was an old silver tea-urn, looking heavy enough to have the weight of whole
                  generations in it, into which, at the moment of sitting down, a serious-visaged
                  waiting-maid dropped a red-hot weight, and forthwith the noise of a violent
                  boiling arose. We little folks looked at each other inquiringly, but said nothing.
                  All was to us like an enchanted palace. The great, mysterious tea-urn, the chased
                  silver tea-caddy, the precise and well-considered movements of Miss Deborah as she
                  rinsed the old embossed silver teapots in the boiling water, the India-china cups
                  and plates, painted with the family initials and family crest, all were to us
                  solemn signs and symbols of that upper table-land of gentility, into which we were
                  forewarned by Aunt Lois we were to enter.</p>
               <p>"There," said Miss Deborah, with emphasis, as she poured and handed to Lady
                  Widgery a cup of tea,—"there 's some of the tea that my brother saved at the time
                  of that disgraceful Boston riot, when Boston Harbor was floating with tea-chests.
                  His cargo was rifled in the most scandalous manner, but he went out in a boat and
                  saved some at the risk of his life."</p>
               <p>Now my most sacred and enthusiastic remembrance was of the glow of patriotic
                  fervor with which, seated on my grandfather's knee, I had heard the particulars of
                  that event at a time when names and dates and dress, and time, place, and
                  circumstance, had all the life and vividness of a recent transaction. I cannot
                  describe the clarion tones in which Miss Deborah rung out the word
                     <emph>disgraceful,</emph> in connection with an event which had always set my
                  blood boiling with pride and patriotism. Now, as if convicted of sheep-stealing, I
                  felt myself getting red to the very tips of my ears.</p>
               <p>"It was a shameful proceeding," sighed Lady Widgery, in her pretty, high-bred
                  tones, as she pensively stirred the amber fluid in her teacup. "I never saw Sir
                  Thomas so indignant at anything in all my life, and I 'm sure it gave me a
                  sick-headache for three days, so that I had to stay shut up in a dark room, and
                  could n't keep the least thing on my stomach. What a mysterious providence it is
                  that such conduct should be suffered to lead to success!"</p>
               <p>"Well," said Lady Lothrop, sipping her tea on the other side, "clouds and darkness
                  are about the Divine dispensations; but let us hope it will be all finally
                  overruled for the best."</p>
               <p>"O, come," said Miss Debby, giving a cheerful, victorious crow of defiance from
                  behind her teapots. "Dorothy will be down on us with the tip-end of one of her
                  husband's sermons, of course. Having married a Continental Congress parson, she
                  has to say the best she can; but I, Deborah Kittery, who was never yet in bondage
                  to any man, shall be free to have <emph>my</emph> say to the end of my days, and I
                     <emph>do</emph> say that the Continental Congress is an abomination in the
                  land, and the leaders of it, if justice had been done, they would all have been
                  hanged high as Haman; and that there is one house in old Boston, at the North End,
                  and not far from the spot where we have the honor to be, where King George now
                  reigns as much as ever he did, and where law and order prevail in spite of General
                  Washington and Mrs. Martha, with her court and train. It puts me out of all manner
                  of patience to read the papers,—receptions to 'em here, there, and everywhere;—I
                  should like to give 'em a reception."</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Deborah, my child, you must be patient," said the old lady. "The
                  Lord's ways are not as our ways. He knows what is best."</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7953-00000153"/>
               <p>"I dare say he does, mother, but we know he does let wickedness triumph to an
                  awful extent. I think myself he 's given this country up."</p>
               <p>"Let us hope not," said the mother, fervently.</p>
               <p>"Just look at it," said Miss Deborah. "Has not this miserable rebellion broken up
                  the true Church in this country just as it was getting a foothold? has it not
                  shaken hands with French infidelity? Thomas Jefferson is a scoffing infidel, and
                  he drafted their old Declaration of Independence, which, I will say, is the most
                  abominable and blasphemous document that ever sinners dared to sign."</p>
               <p>"But General Washington was a Churchman," said Lady Widgery, "and they were always
                  very careful about keeping the feasts and fasts. Why, I remember, in the old
                  times, I have been there to Easter holidays, and we had a splendid ball."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, if he was in the true Church, so much the worse for him." said Miss
                  Deborah. "There is some excuse for men of Puritan families, because their
                  ancestors were schismatics and disorganizers to begin with, and came over here
                  because they did n't like to submit to lawful government. For my part, I have
                  always been ashamed of having been born here. If I 'd been consulted I should have
                  given my voice against it."</p>
               <p>"Debby, child, how you do talk!" said the old lady.</p>
               <p>"Well, mother, what can I do but talk? and it 's a pity if I should n't be allowed
                  to do that. If I had been a man, I 'd have fought; and, if I could have my way
                  now, I 'd go back to England and live, where there 's some religion and some
                  government."</p>
               <p>"I don't see," said the old lady, "but people are doing pretty well under the new
                  government."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, mother, how can you know anything about it? There 's a perfect reign of
                  infidelity and immorality begun. Why, look here, in Boston and Cambridge things
                  are going just as you might think they would. The college fellows call themselves
                  D'Alembert, Rousseau, Voltaire, and other French heathen names; and there's Ellery
                  Davenport! just look at him,—came straight down from generations of Puritan
                  ministers, and has n't half as much religion as my cat there; for Tom does know
                  how to order himself lowly and reverently to all his betters."</p>
               <p>Here there was such a burst of pleading feminine eloquence on all hands as showed
                  that general interest which often pervades the female breast for some bright,
                  naughty, wicked prodigal son. Lady Widgery and old Mrs. Kittery and Lady Lothrop
                  all spoke at once. "Indeed, Miss Deborah,"—"Come, come, Debby,"—"You are too
                  bad,—he goes to church with us sometimes."</p>
               <p>"To church, does he?" said Miss Debby, with a toss; "and what does he go for?
                  Simply to ogle the girls."</p>
               <p>"We should be charitable in our judgements," said Lady Widgery.</p>
               <p>"Especially of handsome young men," said Miss Debby, with strong irony. "You all
                  know he does n't believe as much as a heathen. They say he reads and speaks French
                  like a native, and that 's all I want to know of anybody. I've no opinion of such
                  people; a good honest Christian has no occasion to go out of his own language, and
                  when he does you may be pretty sure it 's for no good."</p>
               <p>"O, come now, Deborah, you are too sweeping altogether," said Lady Lothrop;
                  "French is of course an elegant accomplishment."</p>
               <p>"I never saw any good of the French language, for my part, I must confess," said
                  Miss Debby, "nor, for that matter, of the French nation either; they eat frogs,
                  and break the Sabbath, and are as immoral as the old Canaanites. It's just exactly
                  like them to aid and abet this unrighteous rebellion. They always hated England,
                  and they take delight in massacres and rebellions, and every kind of mischief,
                  ever since the massacre of St. Bartholomew. Well, well, we shall see what 'll come
                  of these ungodly levelling principles in time. 'All men created free and equal,'
                  forsooth. Just think of that! clearly against the church catechism."</p>
               <p>"Of course that is all infidelity," said Lady Widgery, confidently. "Sir Thomas
                  used to say it was the effect on the lower classes he dreaded. You see these lower
                  classes are something dreadful; and what's to keep them down if it is n't
                  religion? as<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7953-00000154"/> Sir Thomas used to say
                  when he always would go to church Sundays. He felt such a responsibility."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Miss Deborah, "you 'll see. I predict we shall see the time when your
                  butcher and your baker, and your candlestick-maker will come into your parlor and
                  take a chair as easy as if they were your equals, and every servant-maid will be
                  thinking she must have a silk gown like her mistress. That 's what we shall get by
                  our revolution."</p>
               <p>"But let us hope it will be all overruled for good," said Lady Lothrop.</p>
               <p>"O, overruled, overruled!" said Miss Deborah. "Of course it will be overruled.
                  Sodom and Gomorrah were overruled for good, but 't was a great deal better not to
                  be living there about those times." Miss Debby's voice had got upon so high a key,
                  and her denunciations began to be so terrifying, that the dear old lady
                  interposed.</p>
               <p>"Well, children, do let's love one another, whatever we do,"she said; "and, Debby,
                  you must n't talk so hard about Ellery,—he 's your cousin, you know."</p>
               <p>"Besides, my dear," said Lady Widgery, "great allowances should be made for his
                  domestic misfortunes."</p>
               <p>"I don't see why a man need turn infidel and rebel because his wife has turned out
                  a madwoman," said Miss Debby; "what did he marry her for?"</p>
               <p>"O my dear, it was a family arrangement to unite the two properties," said Lady
                  Widgery. "You see all the great Pierre-point estates came in through her, but then
                  she was quite shocking,—very peculiar always, but after her marriage her temper
                  was dreadful,—it made poor Ellery miserable, and drove him from home; it really
                  was a mercy when it broke out into real insanity, so that they could shut her up.
                  I 've always had great tenderness for Ellery on that account."</p>
               <p>"Of course you have, because you 're a lady. Did I ever know a lady yet that did
                  n't like Ellery Davenport, and was n't ready to go to the stake for him? For my
                  part I hate him, because, after all, he humbugs me, and will make me like him in
                  spite of myself. I have to watch and pray against him all the time."</p>
               <p>And as if, by the odd law of attraction which has given birth to the proverb that
                  somebody is always nearest when you are talking about him, at this moment the
                  dining-room door was thrown open, and the old man-servant announced "Colonel
                  Ellery Davenport."</p>
               <p>"Colonel!" said Miss Debby, with a frown and an accent of contempt. "How often
                  must I tell Hawkins not to use those titles of the old rebel mob army?
                  Insubordination is beginning to creep in, I can see."</p>
               <p>These words were lost in the bustle of the entrance of one on whom, after
                  listening to all the past conversation, we children looked with very round eyes of
                  attention. What we saw was a tall, graceful young man, whose air and movements
                  gave a singular impression of both lightness and strength. He carried his head on
                  his shoulders with a jaunty, slightly haughty air, like that of a thorough-bred
                  young horse, and there was quality and breeding in every movement of his body. He
                  was dressed in the imposing and picturesque fashion of those times, with a slight
                  military suggestion in its arrangements. His hair was powdered to a dazzling
                  whiteness, and brushed off his low Greek forehead, and the powder gave that
                  peculiar effect to the eye and complexion which was one of the most distinctive
                  traits of that style of costume. His eyes were of a deep violet blue, and of that
                  lively, flashing brilliancy which a painter could only represent by double lights.
                  They seemed to throw out light like diamonds. He entered the room bowing and
                  smiling with the gay good-humor of one sure of pleasing. An inspiring sort of
                  cheerfulness came in with him, that seemed to illuminate the room like a whole
                  stream of sunshine. In short, he fully justified all Miss Deborah's fears.</p>
               <p>In a moment he had taken a rapid survey of the party; he had kissed the hand of
                  the dear old lady, he had complimented Lady Widgery; he had inquired with effusion
                  after the health of Parson Lothrop, and ended all by an adroit attempt to kiss
                  Miss Deborah's hand, which earned him a smart little cuff from that wary
                  belligerent.</p>
               <p>"No rebels allowed on these premises," said Miss Debby, sententiously.</p>
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7953-00000155"/>
               <p>"On my soul, cousin, you forget that peace has been declared," he said, throwing
                  himself into a chair with a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nonchalant</foreign>
                  freedom.</p>
               <p>"Peace! not in our house. <emph>I</emph> have n't surrendered, if Lord Cornwallis
                  has," said Miss Debby, "and I consider you as the enemy."</p>
               <p>"Well, Debby, we must love our enemies," said the old lady, in a pleading
                  tone.</p>
               <p>"Certainly you must," he replied quickly; "and here I 've come to Boston on
                  purpose to go to church with you to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"That's right, my boy," said the old lady. "I always knew you 'd come into right
                  ways at last."</p>
               <p>"O, there are hopes of me, certainly," he said; "if the gentler sex will only
                  remember their mission, and be guardian angels, I think I shall be saved in the
                  end."</p>
               <p>"You mean that you are going to wait on pretty Lizzie Cabot to church to-morrow,"
                  said Miss Debby; "that 's about all the religion there is in it."</p>
               <p>"Mine is the religion of beauty, fair cousin," said he. "If I had had the honor of
                  being one of the apostles, I should have put at least one article to that effect
                  into our highly respectable creed."</p>
               <p>"Ellery Davenport, you are a scoffer."</p>
               <p>"What, I? because I believe in the beautiful? What is goodness but beauty? and
                  what is sin but bad taste? I could prove it to you out of my grandfather Edward's
                  works, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">passim,</foreign> and I think nobody in New England
                  would dispute him."</p>
               <p>"I don't know anything about him," said Miss Debby, with a toss. "He was n't in
                  the Church."</p>
               <p>"Mere matter of position, cousin. Could n't very well be when the Church was a
                  thousand miles across the water; but he lived and died a stanch loyalist,—an
                  aristocrat in the very marrow of his bones, as anybody may see. The whole of his
                  system rests on the undisputed right of big folks to eat up little folks in
                  proportion to their bigness, and the Creator, being biggest of all, is dispensed
                  from all obligation to seek anything but his own glory. Here you have the
                  root-doctrine of the divine right of kings and nobles, who have only to follow
                  their Maker's example in their several spheres, as his blessed Majesty King George
                  has of late been doing with his American colonies. If he had got the treatise on
                  true virtue by heart, he could not have carried out its principles better."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, I never knew that there was so much good in President Edwards before,"
                  said Lady Widgery, with simplicity. "I must get my maid to read me that treatise
                  some time."</p>
               <p>"Do, madam," said Ellery. "I think you will find it exactly adapted to your habits
                  of thought, and extremely soothing."</p>
               <p>"It will be a nice thing for her to read me to sleep with," said Lady Widgery,
                  innocently.</p>
               <p>"By all means," said Ellery, with an indescribable mocking light in his great blue
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>For my own part, having that strange, vibrating susceptibility of constitution
                  which I have described as making me peculiarly impressible by the moral sphere of
                  others, I felt in the presence of this man a singular and painful contest of
                  attraction and repulsion, such as one might imagine to be produced by the near
                  approach of some beautiful but dangerous animal. His singular grace and brilliancy
                  awoke in me an undefined antagonism akin to antipathy, and yet, as if under some
                  enchantment, I could not keep my eyes off from him, and eagerly listened to
                  everything that he had to say.</p>
               <p>With that quick insight into human nature which enabled him, as by a sort of
                  instinct, to catch the reflex of every impression which he made on any human
                  being, he surveyed the row of wide-open, wondering, admiring eyes, which followed
                  him at our end of the table.</p>
               <p>"Aha, what have we here?" he said, as he advanced and laid his hand on my head. I
                  shuddered and shook it off with a feeling of pain and dislike amounting to
                  hatred.</p>
               <p>"How now, my little man?" he said; "what 's the matter here?" and then he turned
                  to Tina. "Here 's a little lady will be more gracious, I know," and he stooped and
                  attempted to kiss her.</p>
               <p>The little lady drew her head back and repulsed him with the dignity of a young
                  princess.</p>
               <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7953-00000156"/>
               <p>"Upon my word," he said, "we learn the tricks of our trade early, don't we? Pardon
                  me, petite mademoiselle," he said as he retreated, laughing. "So you don't like to
                  be kissed?"</p>
               <p>"Only by proper persons," said Tina, with that demure gravity which she could at
                  times so whimsically assume, but sending with the words a long mischievous flash
                  from under her downcast eyelashes.</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, if there is n't one that's perfect in Mother Eve's catechism at an
                  early age," said Ellery Davenport. "Young lady, I hope for a better acquaintance
                  with you one of these days."</p>
               <p>"Come Ellery, let the child alone," said Miss Debby; "why should you be teaching
                  all the girls to be forward? If you notice her so much she will be vain."</p>
               <p>"That's past praying for, anyhow," said he, looking with admiration at the
                  dimpling, sparkling face of Tina, who evidently was dying to answer him back.
                  "Don't you see the monkey has her quiver full of arrows?" he said. "Do let her try
                  her infant hand on me."</p>
               <p>But Miss Debby, eminently proper, rose immediately, and broke up the tea-table
                  session by proposing adjournment to the parlor.</p>
               <p>After this we had family prayers, the maid-servants and man-servant being called
                  in and ranged in decorous order on a bench that stood prepared for exactly that
                  occasion in a corner of the room. Miss Deborah placed a stand, with a great quarto
                  edition of the Bible and prayer-book, before her mother, and the old lady read in
                  a trembling voice the psalm, the epistle, and the gospel for Easter evening, and
                  then, all kneeling, the evening prayers. The sound of her tremulous voice, and the
                  beauty of the prayers themselves, which I vaguely felt, impressed me so much that
                  I wept, without knowing why, as one sometimes does at plaintive music. One thing
                  in particular filled me with a solemn surprise; and that was the prayers, which I
                  had never heard before, for "The Royal Family of England." The trembling voice
                  rose to fervent clearness on the words, "We beseech Thee, with Thy favor, to
                  behold our most Sovereign Lord, King George, and so replenish him with the grace
                  of Thy Holy Spirit, that he may alway incline to Thy will, and walk in Thy way.
                  Endue him plenteously with heavenly gifts, grant him in health and wealth long to
                  live, strengthen him that he may vanquish and overcome all his enemies, and
                  finally after this life may attain everlasting joy and felicity, through Jesus
                  Christ our Lord."</p>
               <p>The loud "Amen" from Miss Debby which followed this, heartily chorussed as it was
                  by the well-taught man-servant and maid-servants, might have done any king's heart
                  good. For my part, I was lost in astonishment; and when the prayer followed "for
                  the gracious Queen Charlotte, their Royal Highnesses, George, Prince of Wales, the
                  Princess Dowager of Wales, and all the Royal Family," my confusion of mind was at
                  its height. All these unknown personages were to be endued with the Holy Spirit,
                  enriched with heavenly grace, and brought to an everlasting kingdom, through Jesus
                  Christ, our Lord. I must confess that all I had heard of them previously, in my
                  education, had not prepared me to see the propriety of any peculiar celestial
                  arrangements in their favor; but the sweet and solemn awe inspired by the
                  trembling voice which pleaded went a long way towards making me feel as if there
                  must have been a great mistake in my bringing up hitherto.</p>
               <p>When the circle rose from their knees, Ellery Davenport said to Miss Debby, "It's
                  a pity the king of England could n't know what stanch supporters he has in
                  Boston."</p>
               <p>"I don't see," said the old lady, "why they won't let us have that prayer read in
                  churches now; it can't do any harm."</p>
               <p>"I don't, either," said Ellery. "For my part, I don't know any one who needs
                  praying for more than the King of England; but the prayers of the Church don't
                  appear to have been answered in his case. If he had been in the slightest degree
                  'endowed with heavenly gifts,' he need n't have lost these American colonies."</p>
               <p>"Come, Ellery, none of your profane talk," said Miss Debby; "<emph>you</emph>
                  don't believe in anything good."</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, I always insist on seeing the good before I<pb n="304-305"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000157"/> believe; I should believe in prayer, if I saw any
                  good come from it."</p>
               <p>"For shame, Ellery, when children are listening to you!" said Miss Debby. "But
                  come, my little folks," she added, rising briskly, "it's time for these little
                  eyes to be shut."</p>
               <p>The dear old lady called us all to her, and kissed us "good night," laying her
                  hand gently on our heads as she did so. I felt the peaceful influence of that hand
                  go through me like music, and its benediction even in my dreams.</p>

               <head type="sub">EASTER SUNDAY.</head>
               <p>FOR a marvel, even in the stormy clime of Boston, our Easter Sunday was one of
                  those celestial days which seem, like the New Jerusalem of the Revelations, to
                  come straight down from God out of heaven, to show us mortals what the upper world
                  may be like. Our poor old Mother Boston has now and then such a day given to her,
                  even in the uncertain spring-time; and when all her bells ring together, and the
                  old North Church chimes her solemn psalm-tunes, and all the people in their
                  holiday garments come streaming out towards the churches of every name which line
                  her streets, it seems as if the venerable dead on Copps Hill must dream
                  pleasantly, for "Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord," and even to this day,
                  in dear old Boston, their works do follow them.</p>
               <p>At an early hour we were roused, and dressed ourselves with the most anxious and
                  exemplary care. For the first time in my life I looked anxiously in the
                  looking-glass, and scanned with some solicitude, as if it had been a third person,
                  the little being who called himself "I." I saw a pair of great brown eyes, a face
                  rather thin and pale, a high forehead, and a great profusion of dark curls,—the
                  combing out of which, by the by, was one of the morning trials of my life. In vain
                  Aunt Lois had cut them off repeatedly, in the laudable hope that my hair would
                  grow out straight. It seemed a more inextricable mat at each shearing; but as
                  Harry's flaxen poll had the same peculiarity, we consoled each other, while we
                  labored at our morning toilet.</p>
               <p>Down in the sunny parlor, a little before breakfast was on the table, we walked
                  about softly with our hands behind us, lest Satan, who we were assured had always
                  some mischief still for<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7953-00000158"/> idle hands to
                  do, should entice us into touching some of the many curious articles which we
                  gazed upon now for the first time. There was the picture of a very handsome young
                  man over the mantel-piece, and beneath it hung a soldier's sword in a large loop
                  of black crape, a significant symbol of the last great sorrow which had
                  overshadowed the household. On one side of the door, framed and glazed, was a
                  large coat of arms of the Kittery family, worked in chenille and embroidery,—the
                  labor of Miss Deborah's hands during the course of her early education. In other
                  places on the walls hung oil paintings of the deceased master of the mansion, and
                  of the present venerable mistress, as she was in the glow of early youth. They
                  were evidently painted by a not unskilful hand, and their eyes always following us
                  as we moved about the room gave us the impression of being overlooked, even while
                  as yet there was nobody else in the apartment. Conspicuously hung on one side of
                  the room was a copy of one of the Vandyck portraits of Charles the First, with his
                  lace ruff and peaked beard. Underneath this was a printed document, framed and
                  glazed; and I, who was always drawn to read any thing that could be read,
                  stationed myself opposite to it and began reading aloud:—</p>
               <p>"The Twelve Good Rules of the Most Blessed Martyr, King Charles First, of Blessed
                  Memory."</p>
               <p>I was reading these in a loud, clear voice, when Miss Debby entered the room. She
                  stopped and listened to me, with a countenance beaming with approbation.</p>
               <p>"Go on, sonny!" she said, coming up behind me, with an approving nod, when I
                  blushed and stopped on seeing her. "Read them through; those are good rules for a
                  man to form his life by."</p>
               <p>I wish I could remember now what these so highly praised rules were. The few that
                  I can recall are not especially in accordance with the genius of our modern times.
                  They began:—</p>
               <p>"1st. Profane no Divine Ordinances.</p>
               <p>"2d. Touch no State Matter.</p>
               <p>"3d. Pick no Quarrels.</p>
               <p>"4th. Maintain no ill Opinions."</p>
               <p>Here my memory fails me, but I remember that, stimulated by Miss Deborah's
                  approbation, I did commit the whole of them to memory at the time, and repeated
                  them with a readiness and fluency which drew upon me warm commendations from the
                  dear old lady, and in fact from all in the house, though Ellery Davenport did
                  shrug his shoulders contumaciously and give a sort of suppressed whistle of
                  dissent.</p>
               <p>"If we had minded those rules," he said, "we should n't be where we are now."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, you would n't; the more's the pity you did n't," said Miss Debby. "If
                  I'd had the bringing of you up, you should be learning things like that, instead
                  of trumpery French and democratic nonsense."</p>
               <p>"Speaking of French," said Ellery, "I declare I forgot a package of gloves that I
                  brought over especially for you and Aunty here,—the very best of Paris kid."</p>
               <p>"You may spare yourself the trouble of bringing them, cousin," said Miss Deborah,
                  coldly. "Whatever others may do, I trust <emph>I</emph> never shall be left to put
                  a French glove on <emph>my</emph> hands. They may be all very fine, no doubt, but
                  English gloves, made under her Majesty's sanction, will always be good enough for
                  me."</p>
               <p>"O, well, in that case I shall have the honor of presenting them to Lady Lothrop,
                  unless her principles should be equally rigid."</p>
               <p>"I dare say Dorothy will take them," said Miss Deborah. "When a woman has married
                  a Continental parson, what can you expect of her? but, for <emph>my</emph> part, I
                  should feel that I dishonored the house of the Lord to enter it with gloves on
                  made by those atheistical French people. The fact is, we must put a stop to
                  worldly conformities somewhere."</p>
               <p>"And you draw the line at French gloves," said Ellery.</p>
               <p>"No, indeed," said Miss Deborah; "by no means French gloves. French novels, French
                  philosophy, and, above all, French morals, or rather want of
                     morals,—<emph>these</emph> are what I go against, Cousin Ellery."</p>
               <p>So saying, Miss Debby led the way to the breakfast-table, with an air of the most
                  martial and determined moral principle.</p>
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7953-00000159"/>
               <p>I remember only one other incident of that morning before we went to church. The
                  dear old lady had seemed sensibly affected by the levity with which Ellery
                  Davenport generally spoke upon sacred subjects, and disturbed by her daughter's
                  confident assertions of his infidel sentiments. So she administered to him an
                  admonition in her own way. A little before church-time she was sitting on the
                  sofa, reading in her great Bible spread out on the table before her.</p>
               <p>"Ellery," she said, "come here and sit down by me. I want you to read me this
                  text."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Aunty, by all means," he said, as he seated himself by her, bent his
                  handsome head over the book, and, following the lead of her trembling finger,
                  read:—</p>
               <p>"And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy fathers, and serve him with a
                  perfect heart and a willing mind. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee, but
                  if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off forever."</p>
               <p>"Ellery," she said, with trembling earnestness, "think of that, my boy. O Ellery,
                  remember!"</p>
               <p>He turned and kissed her hand, and there certainly were tears in his eyes.
                  "Aunty," he said, "you must pray for me; I may be a good boy one of these days,
                  who knows?"</p>
               <p>There was no more preaching, and no more said; she only held his hand, looked
                  lovingly at him, and stroked his forehead. "There have been a great many good
                  people among your fathers, Ellery."</p>
               <p>"I know it," he said.</p>
               <p>At this moment Miss Debby came in with the summons to church. The family carriage
                  came round for the old lady, but we were better pleased to walk up the street
                  under convoy of Ellery Davenport, who made himself quite delightful to us. Tina
                  obstinately refused to take his hand, and insisted upon walking only with Harry,
                  though from time to time she cast glances at him over her shoulder, and he called
                  her "a little chip of mother Eve's block,"—at which she professed to feel great
                  indignation.</p>
               <p>The reader may remember my description of our meeting-house house at Oldtown, and
                  therefore will not wonder that the architecture of the Old North and its
                  solemn-sounding chimes, though by no means remarkable compared with European
                  churches, appeared to us a vision of wonder. We gazed with delighted awe at the
                  chancel and the altar, with their massive draperies of crimson looped back with
                  heavy gold cord and tassels, and revealing a cloud of little winged cherubs,
                  whereat Tina's eyes grew large with awe, as if she had seen a vision. Above this
                  there was a mystical Hebrew word emblazoned in a golden halo, while around the
                  galleries of the house were marvellous little colored statuettes of angels blowing
                  long golden trumpets. These figures had been taken from a privateer and presented
                  to the church by a British man-of-war, and no child that saw them would ever
                  forget them. Then there was the organ, whose wonderful sounds were heard by me for
                  the first time in my life. There was also an indefinable impression of stately
                  people that worshipped there. They all seemed to me like Lady Lothrop, rustling in
                  silks and brocades; with gentlemen like Captain Brown, in scarlet cloaks and
                  powdered hair. Not a crowded house by any means, but a well-ordered and select
                  few, who performed all the responses and evolutions of the service with immaculate
                  propriety. I was struck with every one's kneeling and bowing the head on taking a
                  seat in the church; even gay Ellery Davenport knelt down and hid his face in his
                  hat, though what he did it for was a matter of some speculation with us afterward.
                  Miss Debby took me under her special supervision. She gave me a prayer-book, found
                  the places for me, and took me up and down with her through the whole service,
                  giving her responses in such loud, clear, and energetic tones as entirely to
                  acquit herself of her share of responsibility in the matter. The "true Church"
                  received no detriment, so far as she was concerned. I was most especially edified
                  and astonished by the deep courtesies which she and several distinguished-looking
                  ladies made at the name of the Saviour in the Creed; so much so, that she was
                  obliged to tap me on the head to indicate to me my own part in that portion of the
                  Church service.</p>
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7953-00000160"/>
               <p>I was surprised to observe that Harry appeared perfectly familiar with the
                  ceremony; and Lady Lothrop, who had him under her particular surveillance, looked
                  on with wonder and approbation, as he quietly opened his prayer-book and went
                  through the service with perfect regularity. Tina, who stood between Ellery
                  Davenport and the old lady, seemed, to tell the truth, much too conscious of the
                  amused attention with which he was regarding her little movements, notwithstanding
                  the kindly efforts of her venerable guardian to guide her through the service. She
                  resolutely refused to allow him to assist her, half-turning her back upon him, but
                  slyly watching him from under her long eyelashes, in a way that afforded him great
                  amusement.</p>
               <p>The sermon which followed the prayers was of the most droning and sleepy kind. But
                  as it was dispensed by a regularly ordained successor of the Apostles, Miss
                  Deborah, though ordinarily the shrewdest and sharpest of womankind, and certainly
                  capable of preaching a sermon far more to the point herself, sat bolt upright and
                  listened to all those slumberous platitudes with the most reverential
                  attention.</p>
               <p>It yet remains a mystery to my mind, how a church which retains such a stimulating
                  and inspiring liturgy <emph>could</emph> have such drowsy preaching,—how men could
                  go through with the "Te Deum," and the "Gloria in Excelsis," without one thrill of
                  inspiration, or one lift above the dust of earth, and, after uttering words which
                  one would think might warm the frozen heart of the very dead, settle sleepily down
                  into the quietest commonplace. Such, however, has been the sin of ritualism in all
                  days, principally because human nature is, above all things, lazy, and needs to be
                  thorned and goaded up those heights where it ought to fly.</p>
               <p>Harry and I both had a very nice little nap during sermon-time, while Ellery
                  Davenport made a rabbit of his pocket-handkerchief by way of paying his court to
                  Tina, who sat shyly giggling and looking at him.</p>
               <p>After the services came the Easter dinner, to which, as a great privilege, we were
                  admitted from first to last; although children in those days were held to belong
                  strictly to the dessert, and only came in with the nuts and raisins. I remember
                  Ellery Davenport seemed to be the life of the table, and kept everybody laughing.
                  He seemed particularly fond of rousing up Miss Debby to those rigorous and
                  energetic statements concerning Church and King which she delivered with such
                  freedom.</p>
               <p>"I don't know how we are any of us to get to heaven now," he said to Miss Debby.
                  "Supposing I wanted to be confirmed, there is n't a bishop in America."</p>
               <p>"Well, don't you think they will send one over?" said Lady Widgery, with a face of
                  great solicitude.</p>
               <p>"Two, madam; it would take two in order to start the succession in America. The
                  apostolic electricity cannot come down through one."</p>
               <p>"I heard that Dr. Franklin was negotiating with the Archbishop of Canterbury,"
                  said Lady Lothrop.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but they are not in the best humor toward us over there," said Ellery. "You
                  know what Franklin wrote back, don't you?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Lady Widgery; "what was it?"</p>
               <p>"Well, you see, he found Canterbury &amp; Co. rather huffy, and somewhat on the
                  high-and-mighty order with him, and, being a democratic American, he did n't like
                  it. So he wrote over that he did n't see, for his part, why anybody that wanted to
                  preach the Gospel could n't preach it, without sending a thousand miles across the
                  water to ask leave of a cross old gentleman at Canterbury."</p>
               <p>A shocked expression went round the table, and Miss Debby drew herself up. "That's
                  what I call a profane remark, Ellery Davenport," she said.</p>
               <p>"I did n't make it, you understand."</p>
               <p>"No, dear, you did n't," said the old lady. "Of course you would n't say such a
                  thing."</p>
               <p>"Of course I should n't, Aunty,—O no. I'm only concerned to know how I shall be
                  confirmed, if ever I want to be. Do you think there really is no other way to
                  heaven, Miss Debby? Now, if the Archbishop of Canterbury won't repent, and I
                     do,—<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7953-00000161"/> if he won't send a bishop, and
                  I become a good Christian,—don't you think now the Church might open the door a
                  little crack for me?"</p>
               <p>"Why, of course, Ellery," said Lady Lothrop. "We believe that many good people
                  will be saved out of the Church."</p>
               <p>"My dear madam, that's because you married a Congregational parson; you are
                  getting illogical."</p>
               <p>"Ellery, you know better," said Miss Debby, vigorously. "You know we hold that
                  many good persons out of the Church are saved, though they are saved by
                  uncovenanted mercies. There are no direct promises to any but those in the Church;
                  they have no authorized ministry or sacraments."</p>
               <p>"What a dreadful condition these American colonies are in!" said Ellery; "it 's a
                  result of our Revolution which never struck me before."</p>
               <p>"You can sneer as much as you please, it 's a solemn fact, Ellery; it 's the chief
                  mischief of this dreadful rebellion."</p>
               <p>"Come, come, children," said the old lady; "let 's talk about something else. We
                  've been to the communion, and heard about ' peace on earth and good-will to men.
                  ' I always think of our blessed King George every time I take the communion wine
                  out of those cups that he gave to our church."</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," said Miss Debby; "it will be a long time before you get the
                  American Congress to giving communion services, like our good, pious King
                  George."</p>
               <p>"It's a pity pious folks are so apt to be pig-headed," said Ellery, in a tone just
                  loud enough to stir up Miss Debby, but not to catch the ear of the old lady.</p>
               <p>"I suppose there never was such a pious family as our royal family," said Lady
                  Widgery. "I have been told that Queen Charlotte reads prayers with her maids
                  regularly every night, and we all know how our blessed King read prayers beside a
                  dying cottager."</p>
               <p>"I do not know what the reason is," said Ellery Davenport, reflectively, "but
                  political tyrants as a general thing are very pious men. The worse their political
                  actions are, the more they pray. Perhaps it is on the principle of compensation,
                  just as animals that are incapacitated from helping themselves in one way have
                  some corresponding organ in another direction."</p>
               <p>"I agree with you that kings are generally religious," said Lady Widgery, "and you
                  must admit that, if monarchy makes men religious, it is an argument in its favor,
                  because there is nothing so important as religion, you know."</p>
               <p>"The argument, madam, is a profound one, and does credit to your discernment; but
                  the question now is, since it has pleased Providence to prosper rebellion, and
                  allow a community to be founded without any true church, or any means of getting
                  at true ordinances and sacraments, what young fellows like us are to do about
                  it."</p>
               <p>"I 'll tell you, Ellery," said the old lady, laying hold of his arm. " 'Know the
                  God of thy fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart and willing mind,' and
                  everything will come right."</p>
               <p>"But, even then, I could n't belong to 'the true Church,'" said Ellery.</p>
               <p>"You 'd belong to the church of all good people," said the old lady, "and that 's
                  the main thing."</p>
               <p>"Aunty, you are always right," he said.</p>
               <p>Now I listened with the sharpest attention to all this conversation, which was as
                  bewildering to me as all the rest of the scenery and surroundings of this
                  extraordinary visit had been.</p>
               <p>Miss Debby's martial and declaratory air, the vigorous faith in her statements
                  which she appeared to have, were quite a match, it seemed to me, for similar
                  statements of a contrary nature which I had heard from my respected grandmother;
                  and I could n't help wondering in my own mind what strange concussions of the
                  elementary powers would result if ever these two should be brought together. To
                  use a modern figure, it would be like the meeting of two full-charged railroad
                  engines, from opposite directions, on the same track.</p>
               <p>After dinner, in the evening, instead of the usual service of family prayers, Miss
                  Debby catechised her family in a vigorous and determined manner. We children went
                  and stood up with the row of men and maid servants, and Harry proved to have a
                  very good knowledge of the catechism, but Tina and I only<pb n="314-315"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000162"/> compassed our answers by repeating them after Miss
                  Debby; and she applied herself to teaching us as if this were the only opportunity
                  of getting the truth we were ever to have in our lives.</p>
               <p>In fact, Miss Debby made a current of electricity that, for the time being,
                  carried me completely away, and I exerted myself to the utmost to appear well
                  before her, especially as I had gathered from Aunt Lois and Aunt Keziah's
                  conversations, that whatever went on in this mansion belonged strictly to upper
                  circles of society, dimly known and revered. American democracy had not in those
                  days become a practical thing, so as to outgrow the result of generations of
                  reverence for the upper classes. And the man-servant and the maid-servants seemed
                  so humble, and Miss Debby so victorious and dominant, that I could n't help
                  feeling what a grand thing the true Church must be, and find growing in myself the
                  desires of a submissive catechumen.</p>
               <p>As to the catechism itself, I don't recollect that I thought one moment what a
                  word of it meant, I was so absorbed and busy in the mere effort of repeating it
                  after Miss Debby's rapid dictation.</p>
               <p>The only comparison I remember to have made with that which I had been accustomed
                  to recite in school every Saturday respected the superior case of answering the
                  first question; which required me, instead of relating in metaphysical terms what
                  "man's chief end" was in time and eternity, to give a plain statement of what my
                  own name was on this mortal earth.</p>
               <p>This first question, as being easiest, was put to Tina, who dimpled and colored
                  and flashed out of her eyes, as she usually did when addressed, looked shyly
                  across at Ellery Davenport, who sat with an air of negligent amusement
                  contemplating the scene, and then answered with sufficient precision and
                  distinctness, "Eglantine Percival."</p>
               <p>He gave a little start, as if some sudden train of recollection had been awakened,
                  and looked at her with intense attention; and when Ellery Davenport fixed his
                  attention upon anybody, there was so much fire and electricity in his eyes that
                  they seemed to be felt, even at a distance; and I saw that Tina constantly colored
                  and giggled, and seemed so excited that she scarcely knew what she was saying,
                  till at last Miss Debby, perceiving this, turned sharp round upon him, and said,
                  "Ellery Davenport, if you have n't any religion yourself, I wish you would n't
                  interrupt my instructions."</p>
               <p>"Bless my soul, cousin! what was I doing? I have been sitting here still as a
                  mouse; but I 'll turn my back, and read a good book";—and round he turned,
                  accordingly, till the catechising was finished.</p>
               <p>When it was all over, and the servants had gone out, we grouped ourselves around
                  the fire, and Ellery Davenport began: "Cousin Debby, I 'm going to come down
                  handsomely to you. I admit that your catechism is much better for children than
                  the one I was brought up on. I was well drilled in the formulas of the celebrated
                  Assembly of <emph>dry</emph>vines of Westminster, and dry enough I found it. Now
                  it 's a true proverb, 'Call a man a thief, and he 'll steal'; 'give a dog a bad
                  name, and he'll bite you '; tell a child that he is ' a member of Christ, a child
                  of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven,' and he feels, to say the
                  least, civilly disposed towards religion; tell him 'he is under God's wrath and
                  curse, and so made liable to all the miseries of this life, to death itself, and
                  the pains of hell forever,' because somebody ate an apple five thousand years ago,
                  and his religious associations are not so agreeable,—especially if he has the
                  answers whipped into him, or has to go to bed without his supper for not learning
                  them."</p>
               <p>"You poor dear!" said the old lady; "did they send you to bed without your supper?
                  They ought to have been whipped themselves, every one of them."</p>
               <p>"Well, you see, I was a little fellow when my parents died, and brought up under
                  brother Jonathan, who was the bluest kind of blue; and he was so afraid that I
                  should mistake my naturally sweet temper for religion, that he instructed me daily
                  that I was a child of wrath, and could n't, and did n't, and never should do one
                  right thing till I was regenerated, and when that would happen no mortal knew; so
                  I thought, as my account was going to be scored off at that time, it was no matter
                  if I did run up a pretty long one; so I lied and stole whenever it came
                  handy."</p>
               <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7953-00000163"/>
               <p>"O Ellery, I hope not!" said the old lady; "certainly you never stole
                  anything!"</p>
               <p>"Have, though, my blessed aunt,—robbed orchards and watermelon patches; but then
                  St. Augustine did that very thing himself, and he did n't turn about till he was
                  thirty years old, and I 'm a good deal short of that yet; so you see there is a
                  great chance for me."</p>
               <p>"Ellery, why don't you come into the true Church?" said Miss Debby. "That 's what
                  you need."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Ellery, "I must confess that I like the idea of a nice old motherly
                  Church, that sings to us, and talks to us, and prays with us, and takes us in her
                  lap and coddles us when we are sick and says,— <q>
                     <l>'Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber.'</l>
                  </q> Nothing would suit me better, if I could get my reason to sleep; but the
                  mischief of a Calvinistic education is, it wakes up your reason, and it never will
                  go to sleep again, and you can't take a pleasant humbug if you would. Now, in this
                  life, where nobody knows anything about anything, a capacity for humbugs would be
                  a splendid thing to have. I wish to my heart I 'd been brought up a Roman
                  Catholic! but I have not,—I 've been brought up a Calvinist, and so here I
                  am."</p>
               <p>"But if you 'd try to come into the Church and believe," said Miss Debby,
                  energetically, " grace would be given you. You 've been baptized, and the Church
                  admits your baptism. Now just assume your position."</p>
               <p>Miss Debby spoke with such zeal and earnestness, that I, whom she was holding in
                  her lap, looked straight across with the expectation of hearing Ellery Davenport
                  declare his immediate conversion then and there. I shall never forget the
                  expression of his face. There was first a flash of amusement, as he looked at Miss
                  Debby's strong, sincere face, and then it faded into something between admiration
                  and pity; and then he said to himself in a musing tone: "I a 'member of Christ, a
                  child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.'" And then a strange,
                  sarcastic expression broke over his face, as he added: "Could n't do it, cousin;
                  not exactly my style. Besides, I should n't be much of a credit to any church, and
                  whichever catches me would be apt to find a shark in the net. You see," he added,
                  jumping up and walking about rapidly, "I have the misfortune to have an extremely
                  exacting nature, and, if I set out to be religious at all, it would oblige me to
                  carry the thing to as great lengths as did my grandfather Jonathan Edwards. I
                  should have to take up the cross and all that, and I don't want to, and don't mean
                  to; and as to all these pleasant, comfortable churches, where a fellow can get to
                  heaven without it, I have the misfortune of not being able to believe in them; so
                  there you see precisely my situation."</p>
               <p>"These horrid old Calvinistic doctrines," said Miss Debby, "are the ruin of
                  children."</p>
               <p>"My dear, they are all in the Thirty-nine Articles as strong as in the Cambridge
                  platform, and all the other platforms, for the good reason that John Calvin
                  himself had the overlooking of them. And, what is worse, there is an abominable
                  sight of truth in them. Nature herself is a high Calvinist, old jade; and there
                  never was a man of energy enough to feel the force of the world he deals with that
                  was n't a predestinarian, from the time of the Greek Tragedians down to the time
                  of Oliver Cromwell, and ever since. The hardest doctrines are the things that a
                  fellow sees with his own eyes going on in the world around him. If you had been in
                  England, as I have, where the true Church prevails, you 'd see that pretty much
                  the whole of the lower classes there are predestinated to be conceived and born in
                  sin, and shapen in iniquity; and come into the world in such circumstances that to
                  expect even decent morality of them is expecting what is contrary to all reason.
                  This is your Christian country, after eighteen hundred years' experiment of
                  Christianity. The elect, by whom I mean the bishops and clergy and upper classes,
                  have attained to a position in which a decent and religious life is practicable,
                  and where there is leisure from the claims of the body to attend to those of the
                  soul. These, however, to a large extent are smothering in their own fat, or, as
                  your service to-day had it, 'Their heart is fat as brawn'; and so they don't, to
                  any great<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7953-00000164"/> extent, make their calling
                  and election sure. Then, as for heathen countries, they are a peg below those of
                  Christianity. Taking the mass of human beings in the world at this hour, they are
                  in such circumstances, that, so far from it 's being reasonable to expect the
                  morals of Christianity of them, they are not within sight of ordinary human
                  decencies. Talk of purity of heart to a Malay or Hottentot! Why, the doctrine of a
                  clean shirt is an uncomprehended mystery to more than half the human race at this
                  moment. That 's what I call visible election and reprobation, get rid of it as we
                  may or can."</p>
               <p>"Positively, Ellery, I am not going to have you talk so before these children,"
                  said Miss Debby, getting up and ringing the bell energetically. "This all comes of
                  the vile democratic idea that people are to have opinions on all subjects, instead
                  of believing what the Church tells them; and, as you say, it 's Calvinism that
                  starts people out to be always reasoning and discussing and having opinions. I
                  hate folks who are always speculating and thinking, and having new doctrines; all
                  I want to know is <emph>my duty,</emph> and to do it. I want to know what
                     <emph>my</emph> part is, and it 's none of my business whether the bishops and
                  the kings and the nobility do theirs or not, if I only do mine. 'To do my duty in
                  that state of life in which it has pleased God to call me,' is all I want, and I
                  think it is all anybody need want."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Amen!</emph>" said Ellery Davenport, "<emph>and so be it.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Here Mrs. Margery appeared with the candles to take us to bed.</p>
               <p>In bidding our adieus for the night, it was customary for good children to kiss
                  all round; but Tina, in performing this ceremony both this night and the night
                  before, resolutely ignored Ellery Davenport, notwithstanding his earnest
                  petitions; and, while she would kiss with ostentatious affection those on each
                  side of him, she hung her head and drew back whenever he attempted the
                  familiarity, yet, by way of reparation, turned back at the door as she was going
                  out, and made him a parting salutation with the air of a princess; and I heard him
                  say, "Upon my word, how she does it!"</p>
               <p>After we left the room (this being a particular which, like tellers of stories in
                  general, I learned from other sources), he turned to Lady Lothrop and said: "Did I
                  understand that she said her name was Eglantine Percival, and that she is a sort
                  of foundling?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said Lady Lothrop; "both these children are orphans, left on the
                  parish by a poor woman who died in a neighboring town. They appear to be of good
                  blood and breeding, but we have no means of knowing who they are."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Ellery Davenport, "I knew a young English officer by the name of
                  Percival, who was rather a graceless fellow. He once visited me at my
                  country-seat, with several others. When he went away, being, as he often was, not
                  very fit to take care of himself, he dropped and left a pocket-book, so some of
                  the servants told me, which was thrown into one of the drawers, and for aught I
                  know may be there now: it 's just barely possible that it may be, and that there
                  may be some papers in it which will shed light on these children's parentage. If I
                  recollect rightly, he was said to be connected with a good English family, and it
                  might be possible, if we were properly informed, to shame him, or frighten him
                  into doing something for these children. I will look into the matter myself, when
                  I am in England next winter, where I shall have some business; that is to say, if
                  we can get any clew. The probability is that the children are illegitimate."</p>
               <p>"O, I hope not," said Lady Lothrop; "they appear to have been so beautifully
                  educated."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Ellery Davenport, "he may have seduced his curate's daughter; that 's
                  a very simple supposition. At any rate, he never produced her in society, never
                  spoke of her, kept her in cheap, poor lodgings in the country, and the general
                  supposition was that she was his mistress, not his wife."</p>
               <p>"No," said a little voice near his elbow, which startled every one in the
                  room,—"no, Mr. Davenport, my mother was my father's wife."</p>
               <p>The fire had burnt low, and the candles had not been brought in, and Harry, who
                  had been sent back by Mrs. Margery to give a message as to the night arrangements,
                  had entered the room<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7953-00000165"/> softly, and stood
                  waiting to get a chance to deliver it. He now came forward, and stood trembling
                  with agitation, pale yet bold. Of course all were very much shocked as he went on:
                  " They took my mother's wedding-ring, and sold it to pay for her coffin; but she
                  always wore it and often told me when it was put on. But," he added, "she told me,
                  the night she died, that I had no father but God."</p>
               <p>"And he is Father enough!" said the old lady, who, entirely broken down and
                  overcome, clasped the little boy in her arms. "Never you mind it, dear, God
                  certainly will take care of you."</p>
               <p>"I know he will," said the boy, with solemn simplicity; "but I want you all to
                  believe the truth about my mother."</p>
               <p>It was characteristic of that intense inwardness and delicacy which were so
                  peculiar in Harry's character, that, when he came back from this agitating scene,
                  he did not tell me a word of what had occurred, nor did I learn it till years
                  afterwards. I was very much in the habit of lying awake nights, long after he had
                  sunk into untroubled slumbers, and this night I remember that he lay long but
                  silently awake, so very still and quiet, that it was some time before I discovered
                  that he was not sleeping.</p>
               <p>The next day Ellery Davenport left us, but we remained to see the wonders of
                  Boston. I remembered my grandmother's orders, and went on to Copps Hill, and to
                  the old Granary burying-ground, to see the graves of the saints, and read the
                  inscriptions. I had a curious passion for this sort of mortuary literature, even
                  as a child,—a sort of nameless, weird, strange delight,—so that I accomplished
                  this part of my grandmother's wishes <foreign xml:lang="ITA">con amore.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>Boston in those days had not even arrived at being a city, but, as the reader may
                  learn from contemporary magazines, was known as the Town of Boston. In some
                  respects, however, it was even more attractive in those days for private
                  residences than it is at present. As is the case now in some of our large rural
                  towns, it had many stately old houses, which stood surrounded by gardens and
                  grounds, where fruits and flowers were tended with scrupulous care. It was
                  sometimes called "the garden town." The house of Madam Kittery stood on a high
                  eminence overlooking looking the sea, and had connected with it a stately garden,
                  which, just at the time of year I speak of, was gay with the first crocuses and
                  snowdrops.</p>
               <p>In the eyes of the New England people, it was always a sort of mother-town,—a
                  sacred city, the shrine of that religious enthusiasm which founded the States of
                  New England. There were the graves of her prophets and her martyrs,—those who had
                  given their lives through the hardships of that enterprise in so ungenial a
                  climate.</p>
               <p>On Easter Monday Lady Lothrop proposed to take us all to see the shops and sights
                  of Boston, with the bountiful intention of purchasing some few additions to the
                  children's wardrobes. I was invited to accompany the expedition, and all parties
                  appeared not a little surprised, and somewhat amused, that I preferred, instead of
                  this lively tour among the living, to spend my time in a lonely ramble in the
                  Copps Hill burying-ground.</p>
               <p>I returned home after an hour or two spent in this way, and found the parlor
                  deserted by all except dear old Madam Kittery. I remember, even now, the aspect of
                  that sunny room, and the perfect picture of peace and love that she seemed to me,
                  as she sat on the sofa with a table full of books drawn up to her, placidly
                  reading.</p>
               <p>She called me to her as soon as I came in, and would have me get on the sofa by
                  her. She stroked my head, and looked lovingly at me, and called me "Sonny," till
                  my whole heart opened toward her as a flower opens toward the sunshine.</p>
               <p>Among all the loves that man has to woman, there is none so sacred and saint-like
                  as that toward these dear, white-haired angels, who seem to form the connecting
                  link between heaven and earth, who have lived to get the victory over every sin
                  and every sorrow, and live perpetually on the banks of the dark river, in that
                  bright, calm land of Beulah, where angels daily walk to and fro, and sounds of
                  celestial music are heard across the water.</p>
               <p>Such have no longer personal cares, or griefs, or sorrows. The tears of life have
                  all been shed, and therefore they have hearts at leisure to attend to every one
                  else. Even the sweet, guileless childishness that comes on in this period has a
                     sacred<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7953-00000166"/> dignity; it is a seal of
                  fitness for that heavenly kingdom which whosoever shall not receive as a little
                  child, shall not enter therein.</p>
               <p>Madam Kittery, with all her apparent simplicity, had a sort of simple shrewdness.
                  She delighted in reading, and some of the best classical literature was always
                  lying on her table. She began questioning me about my reading, and asking me to
                  read to her, and seemed quite surprised at the intelligence and expression with
                  which I did it.</p>
               <p>I remember, in the course of the reading, coming across a very simple Latin
                  quotation, at which she stopped me. "There," said she, "is one of those Latin
                  streaks that always trouble me in books, because I can't tell what they mean. When
                  George was alive, he used to read them to me."</p>
               <p>Now, as this was very simple, I felt myself quite adequate to its interpretation,
                  and gave it with a readiness which pleased her.</p>
               <p>"Why! how came you to know Latin?" she said.</p>
               <p>Then my heart opened, and I told her all my story, and how my poor father had
                  always longed to go to college, "and died without the sight," and how he had begun
                  to teach me Latin; but how he was dead, and my mother was poor, and grandpapa
                  could only afford to keep Uncle Bill in college, and there was no way for me to
                  go, and Aunt Lois wanted to bind me out to a shoemaker. And then I began to cry,
                  as I always did when I thought of this.</p>
               <p>I shall never forget the overflowing, motherly sympathy which had made it easy for
                  me to tell all this to one who, but a few hours before, had been a stranger; nor
                  how she comforted me, and cheered me, and insisted upon it that I should
                  immediately eat a piece of cake, and begged me not to trouble myself about it, and
                  she would talk to Debby, and something should be done.</p>
               <p>Now I had not the slightest idea of what Madam Kittery could do in the situation,
                  but I was exceedingly strengthened and consoled, and felt sure that there had come
                  a favorable turn in my fortunes; and the dear old lady and myself forthwith
                  entered into a league of friendship.</p>
               <p>I was thus emboldened, now that we were all alone, and Miss Debby far away, to
                  propound to her indulgent ear certain political doubts, raised by the conflict of
                  my past education with the things I had been hearing for the last day or two.</p>
               <p>"If King George was such a good man, what made him oppress the Colonies so?" said
                  I.</p>
               <p>"Why, dear, he did n't," she said, earnestly. "That 's all a great mistake. Our
                  King is a dear, pious, good man, and wished us all well, and was doing just the
                  best for us he knew how."</p>
               <p>"Then was it because he did n't know how to govern us?" said I.</p>
               <p>"My dear, you know the King can do no wrong; it was his ministers, if anybody. I
                  don't know exactly how it was, but they got into a brangle, and everything went
                  wrong; and then there was so much evil feeling and fighting and killing, and
                  'there was confusion, and every evil work.' There 's my poor boy," she said,
                  pointing to the picture with a trembling hand, and to the sword hanging in its
                  crape loop,—"he died for his King, doing his duty in that state of life in which
                  it pleased God to call him. I must n't be sorry for that, but O, I wish there had
                  n't been any war, and we could have had it all peaceful, and George could have
                  stayed with us. I don't see, either, the use of all these new-fangled notions, but
                  then I try to love everybody, and hope for the best."</p>
               <p>So spoke my dear old friend; and has there ever been a step in human progress that
                  has not been taken against the prayers of some good soul, and been washed by
                  tears, sincerely and despondently shed? But, for all this, is there not a true
                  unity of the faith in all good hearts? and when they have risen a little above the
                  mists of earth, may not both sides—the conqueror and the conquered—agree that God
                  hath given them the victory in advancing the cause of truth and goodness?</p>
               <p>Only one other conversation that I heard during this memorable visit fixed itself
                  very strongly in my mind. On the evening of this same day, we three children were
                  stationed at a table to look at a volume of engravings of beautiful birds, while
                  Miss Debby, Lady Widgery and Madam Kittery sat by the fire. I heard them talking
                  of Ellery Davenport, and, though I had been<pb n="324-325"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000167"/> instructed that it was not proper for children to
                  listen when their elders were talking among themselves, yet it really was not
                  possible to avoid hearing what Miss Debby said, because all her words were
                  delivered with such a sharp and determinate emphasis.</p>
               <p>As it appeared, Lady Widgery had been relating to them some of the trials and
                  sorrows of Ellery Davenport's domestic life. And then there followed a buzz of
                  some kind of story which Lady Widgery seemed relating with great minuteness. At
                  last I heard Miss Deborah exclaim earnestly: "If I had a daughter, catch me
                  letting her be intimate with Ellery Davenport! I tell you that man has n't read
                  French for nothing."</p>
               <p>"I do assure you, his conduct has been marked with perfect decorum," said lady
                  Widgery.</p>
               <p>"So are your French novels," said Miss Deborah; "they are always talking about
                  decorum; they are full of decorum and piety! why, the kingdom of heaven is nothing
                  to them! but somehow they all end in adultery."</p>
               <p>"Debby," said the old lady, "I can't bear to hear you talk so. I think your
                  cousin's heart is in the right place, after all; and he's a good, kind boy as ever
                  was."</p>
               <p>"But, mother, he 's a liar! that's just what he is."</p>
               <p>"Debby, Debby! how can you talk so?"</p>
               <p>"Well, mother, people have different names for different things. I hear a great
                  deal about Ellery Davenport's tact and knowledge of the world, and all that; but
                  he does a great deal of what <emph>I</emph> call lying,—so there! Now there are
                  some folks who lie blunderingly, and unskilfully, but I 'll say for Ellery
                  Davenport that he can lie as innocently and sweetly and prettily as a French
                  woman, and I can't say any more. And if a woman does n't want to believe him, she
                  just must n't listen to him, that's all. I always believe him when he is around,
                  but when he's away and I think him over, I know just what he is, and see just what
                  an old fool he has made of me."</p>
               <p>These words dropped into my childish mind as if you should accidentally drop a
                  ring into a deep well. I did not think of them much at the time, but there came a
                  day in my life when the ring was fished up out of the well, good as new.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">WHAT "OUR FOLKS" SAID AT OLDTOWN.</head>
               <p>WE children returned to Oldtown, crowned with victory, as it were. Then, as now,
                  even in the simple and severe Puritanical village, there was much incense burnt
                  upon the altar of gentility,—a deity somewhat corresponding to the unknown god
                  whose altar Paul found at Athens, and probably more universally worshipped in all
                  the circles of this lower world than any other idol on record.</p>
               <p>Now we had been taken notice of, put forward, and patronized, in undeniably
                  genteel society. We had been to Boston and come back in a coach; and what
                  well-regulated mind does not see that that was something to inspire respect?</p>
               <p>Aunt Lois was evidently dying to ask us all manner of questions, but was
                  restrained by a sort of decent pride. To exhibit any undue eagerness would be to
                  concede that she was ignorant of good society, and that the ways and doings of
                  upper classes were not perfectly familiar to her. That, my dear reader, is what no
                  good democratic American woman can for a moment concede. Aunt Lois therefore, for
                  once in her life, looked complacently on Sam Lawson, who continued to occupy his
                  usual roost in the chimney-corner, and who, embarrassed with no similar delicate
                  scruples, put us through our catechism with the usual Yankee thoroughness.</p>
               <p>"Well, chillen, I suppose them Kitterys has everythin' in real grander, don't
                  they? I 've heerd tell that they has Turkey carpets on th' floors. You know Josh
                  Kittery, he was in the Injy trade. Turkey carpets is that kind, you know, that
                  lies all up thick like a mat. They had that kind, did n't they?"</p>
               <p>We eagerly assured him that they did.</p>
               <p>"Want to know, now," said Sam, who always moralized as he went along. "Wal, wal,
                  some folks does seem to receive their<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7953-00000168"/>
                  good thin's in this life, don't they? S'pose the tea-things all on 'em was solid
                  silver, wa' n't they? Yeh did n't ask them, did yeh?"</p>
               <p>"O no," said I; "you know we were told we must n't ask questions."</p>
               <p>"Jes so; very right,—little boys should n't ask questions. But I 've heerd a good
                  'eal about the Kittery silver. Jake Marshall, he knew a fellah that had talked
                  with one of their servants, that helped bury it in the cellar in war-times, and he
                  said theh was porringers an' spoons an' tankards, say nothing of table-spoons, an'
                  silver forks, an' sich. That 'ere would ha' been a haul for Congress, if they
                  could ha' got hold on 't in war-time, would n't it? S'pose yeh was sot up all so
                  grand, and hed servants to wait on yeh, behind yer chairs, did n't yeh?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," we assured him, "we did."</p>
               <p>"Wal, wal; yeh must n't be carried away by these 'ere glories: they 's transitory,
                  arter all: ye must jest come right daown to plain livin'. How many servants d' yeh
                  say they kep'?"</p>
               <p>"Why, there were two men and two women, besides Lady Widgery's maid and Mrs.
                  Margery."</p>
               <p>"And all used to come in to prayers every night," said Harry.</p>
               <p>"Hes prayers reg'lar, does they?" said Sam. "Well, now, that 'ere beats all! Did
                  n't know as these gran' families wus so pious as that comes to. Who prayed?"</p>
               <p>"Old Madam Kittery," said I. "She used to read prayers out of a large book."</p>
               <p>"O yis; these 'ere gran' Tory families is 'Piscopal, pretty much all on 'em. But
                  now readin' prayers out of a book, that 'ere don' strike me as just the right kind
                  o' thing. For my part, I like prayers that come right out of the heart better. But
                  then, lordy massy, folks hes theh different ways; an' I ain't so set as Polly is.
                  Why, I b'lieve, if that 'ere woman had her way, theh would n't nobody be 'lowed to
                  do nothin', except just to suit her. Yeh did n't notice, did yeh, what the Kittery
                  coat of arms was?"</p>
               <p>Yes, we had noticed it; and Harry gave a full description of an embroidered set of
                  armorial bearings which had been one of the ornaments of the parlor.</p>
               <p>"So you say," said Sam, "'t was a lion upon his hind legs,—that 'ere is what they
                  call ' the lion rampant,'—and then there was a key and a scroll. Wal! coats of
                  arms is curus, and I don't wonder folks kind o' hangs onter um; but then, the
                  Kitterys bein' Tories, they nat'ally has more interest in sech thin's. Do you know
                  where Mis' Kittery keeps her silver nights?"</p>
               <p>"No, really," said I; "we were sent to bed early, and did n't see."</p>
               <p>Now this inquiry, from anybody less innocent than Sam Lawson, might have been
                  thought a dangerous exhibition of burglarious proclivities; but from him it was
                  received only as an indication of that everlasting thirst for general information
                  which was his leading characteristic.</p>
               <p>When the rigor of his cross-examination had somewhat abated, he stooped over the
                  fire to meditate further inquiries. I seized the opportunity to propound to my
                  grandmother a query which had been the result of my singular experiences for a day
                  or two past. So, after an interval in which all had sat silently looking into the
                  great coals of the fire, I suddenly broke out with the inquiry, "Grandmother, what
                  is <emph>The True Church?"</emph>
               </p>
               <p>I remember the expression on my grandfather's calm, benign face as I uttered this
                  query. It was an expression of shrewd amusement, such as befits the face of an
                  elder when a younger has propounded a well-worn problem; but my grandmother had
                  her answer at the tip of her tongue, and replied, "It is the whole number of the
                  elect, my son."</p>
               <p>I had in my head a confused remembrance of Ellery Davenport's tirade on election,
                  and of the elect who did or did not have clean shirts; so I pursued my inquiry by
                  asking, "Who are the elect?"</p>
               <p>"All good people," replied my grandfather. "In every nation he that feareth God
                  and worketh righteousness is accepted of Him."</p>
               <p>"Well, how came you to ask that question?" said my grandmother, turning on me.</p>
               <p>"Why," said I, "because Miss Deborah Kittery said that the war destroyed the true
                  Church in this country."</p>
               <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7953-00000169"/>
               <p>"O, pshaw!" said my grandmother; "that's some of her Episcopal nonsense. I really
                  should like to ask her, now, if she thinks there ain't any one going to heaven but
                  Episcopalians."</p>
               <p>"O no, she does n't think so," said I, rather eagerly. "She said a great many good
                  people would be saved out of the Church, but they would be saved by uncovenanted
                  mercies."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Uncovenanted fiddlesticks!</emph>" said my grandmother, her very cap-border
                  bristling with contempt and defiance. "Now, Lois, you just see what comes of
                  sending children into Tory Episcopal families,—coming home and talking nonsense
                  like that!"</p>
               <p>"Mercy, mother! what odds does it make?" said Aunt Lois. "The children have got to
                  learn to hear all sorts of things said,—may as well hear them at one time as
                  another. Besides, it all goes into one ear and out at the other."</p>
               <p>My grandmother was better pleased with the account that I hastened to give her of
                  my visit to the graves of the saints and martyrs, in my recent pilgrimage. Her
                  broad face glowed with delight, as she told over again to our listening ears the
                  stories of the faith and self-denial of those who had fled from an oppressive king
                  and church, that they might plant a new region where life should be simpler,
                  easier, and more natural. And she got out her "Cotton Mather," and,
                  notwithstanding Aunt Lois's reminder that she had often read it before, read to us
                  again, in a trembling yet audible voice, that wonderful document, in which the
                  reasons for the first planting of New England are set forth. Some of these reasons
                  I remember from often hearing them in my childhood. They speak thus quaintly of
                  the old countries of Europe:—</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Thirdly. The land grows weary of her inhabitants, insomuch that
                     <emph>man,</emph> which is the most precious of all creatures, is here more
                  vile than the earth he treads upon,—children, neighbors, and friends, especially
                  the <emph>poor,</emph> which, if things were right, would be the greatest earthly
                  blessings.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Fourthly. We are grown to that intemperance in all <emph>excess of
                     riot,</emph> as no mean estate will suffice a man to keep sail with his
                     <emph>equals,</emph> and he that fails in it must live in scorn and contempt:
                  hence it comes to pass that all <emph>arts</emph> and <emph>trades</emph> are
                  carried in that deceitful manner and unrighteous course, as it is almost
                  impossible for a good, upright man to maintain his constant charge, and live
                  comfortably in them.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Fifthly. The schools of learning and religion are so corrupted as
                  (besides the insupportable charge of education) most children of the best,
                  wittiest, and of the fairest hopes are perverted, corrupted, and utterly
                  overthrown by the multitude of evil examples and licentious behaviours in these
                     <emph>seminaries.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Sixthly. The <emph>whole earth</emph> is the Lord's
                     <emph>garden,</emph> and he hath given it to the sons of Adam to be tilled and
                  improved by them. Why then should we stand starving here for places of habitation,
                  and in the mean time suffer whole countries as profitable for the use of man to
                  lie waste without any improvement?"</p>
               <p>Language like this, often repeated, was not lost upon us. The idea of
                  self-sacrifice which it constantly inculcated,—the reverence for self-denial,—the
                  conception of a life which should look, not mainly to selfish interests, but to
                  the good of the whole human race, prevented the hardness and roughness of those
                  early New England days from becoming mere stolid, material toil. It was toil and
                  manual labor ennobled by a new motive.</p>
               <p>Even in those very early times there was some dawning sense of what the great
                  American nation was yet to be. And every man, woman, and child was constantly
                  taught, by every fireside, to feel that he or she was part and parcel of a great
                  new movement in human progress. The old aristocratic ideas, though still lingering
                  in involuntary manners and customs, only served to give a sort of quaintness and
                  grace of Old-World culture to the roughness of new-fledged democracy.</p>
               <p>Our visit to Boston was productive of good to us such as we little dreamed of. In
                  the course of a day or two Lady Lothrop called, and had a long private interview
                  with the female portion of the family; after which, to my great delight, it was
                  announced to us that Harry and I might begin to study Latin, if we pleased, and if
                  we proved bright, good boys, means would be provided for the finishing of our
                  education in college.</p>
               <p>I was stunned and overwhelmed by the great intelligence, and Harry and I ran over
                  to tell it to Tina, who jumped about<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7953-00000170"/>
                  and hugged and kissed us both with an impartiality which some years later she
                  quite forgot to practise.</p>
               <p>"I 'm glad, because you like it," she said; "but I should think it would be horrid
                  to study Latin."</p>
               <p>I afterwards learned that I was indebted to my dear old friend Madam Kittery for
                  the good fortune which had befallen me. She had been interested in my story, as it
                  appears, to some purpose, and, being wealthy and without a son, had resolved to
                  console herself by appropriating to the education of a poor boy a portion of the
                  wealth which should have gone to her own child.</p>
               <p>The searching out of poor boys, and assisting them to a liberal education, had
                  ever been held to be one of the appropriate works of the minister in a New England
                  town. The schoolmaster who taught the district school did not teach Latin; but
                  Lady Lothrop was graciously pleased to say that, for the present, Dr. Lothrop
                  would hear our lessons at a certain hour every afternoon; and the reader may be
                  assured that we studied faithfully in view of an ordeal like this.</p>
               <p>I remember one of our favorite places for study. The brown, sparkling stream on
                  which my grandfather's mill was placed had just below the mill-dam a little
                  island, which a boy could easily reach by wading through the shallow waters over a
                  bed of many-colored pebbles. The island was overshadowed by thick bushes, which
                  were all wreathed and matted together by a wild grape-vine; but within I had
                  hollowed out for myself a green little arbor, and constructed a rude wigwam of
                  poles and bark, after the manner of those I had seen among the Indians. It was one
                  of the charms of this place, that nobody knew of it: it was utterly secluded; and
                  being cut off from land by the broad belt of shallow water, and presenting nothing
                  to tempt or attract anybody to its shores, it was mine, and mine alone. There I
                  studied, and there I read; there I dreamed and saw visions.</p>
               <p>Never did I find it in my heart to tell to any other boy the secret of this
                  woodland shelter, this fairy-land, so near to the real outer world; but Harry,
                  with his refinement, his quietude, his sympathetic silence, seemed to me as
                  unobjectionable an associate ciate as the mute spiritual companions whose presence
                  had cheered my lonely, childish sleeping-room.</p>
               <p>We moved my father's Latin books into a rough little closet that we constructed in
                  our wigwam; and there, with the water dashing behind us, and the afternoon sun
                  shining down through the green grape-leaves, with bluebirds and bobolinks singing
                  to us, we studied our lessons. More than that, we spent many pleasant hours in
                  reading; and I have now a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">résumé,</foreign> in our boyish
                  handwriting, of the greater part of Plutarch's Lives, which we wrote out during
                  this summer.</p>
               <p>As to Tina, of course she insisted upon it that we should occasionally carry her
                  in a lady-chair over to this island, that she might inspect our operations and our
                  housekeeping, and we read some of these sketches to her for her critical
                  approbation; and if any of them pleased her fancy, she would immediately insist
                  that we should come over to Miss Mehitable's, and have a dramatic representation
                  of them up in the garret.</p>
               <p>Saturday afternoon, in New England, was considered, from time immemorial, as the
                  children's perquisite; and hard-hearted must be that parent or that teacher who
                  would wish to take away from them its golden hours. Certainly it was not Miss
                  Mehitable, nor my grandmother, that could be capable of any such cruelty.</p>
               <p>Our Saturday afternoons were generally spent as Tina dictated; and, as she had a
                  decided taste for the drama, one of our most common employments was the
                  improvising of plays, with Miss Tina for stage manager. The pleasure we took in
                  these exercises was inconceivable; they had for us a vividness and reality past
                  all expression.</p>
               <p>I remember our acting, at one time, the Book of Esther, with Tina, very much
                  be-trinketed and dressed out in an old flowered brocade that she had rummaged from
                  a trunk in the garret, as Queen Esther. Harry was Mordecai, and I was
                  Ahasuerus.</p>
               <p>The great trouble was to find a Haman; but, as the hanging of Haman was
                  indispensable to any proper moral effect of the tragedy, Tina petted and cajoled
                  and coaxed old Bose, the yellow dog of our establishment, to undertake the part,
                  instructing him volubly that he must sulk and look cross when Mordecai went by,—a
                     thing<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7953-00000171"/> which Bose, who was one of the
                  best-natured of dogs, found difficulty in learning. Bose would always insist upon
                  sitting on his haunches, in his free-and-easy, jolly manner, and lolling out his
                  red tongue in a style so decidedly jocular as utterly to spoil the effect, till
                  Tina, reduced to desperation, ensconced herself under an old quilted petticoat
                  behind him, and brought out the proper expression at the right moment by a
                  vigorous pull at his tail. Bose was a dog of great constitutional equanimity, but
                  there were some things that transcended even his powers of endurance, and the
                  snarl that he gave to Mordecai was held to be a triumphant success; but the thing
                  was, to get him to snarl when Tina was in front of him, where she could see it;
                  and now will it be believed that the all-conquering little mischief-maker actually
                  kissed and flattered and bejuggled old Polly into taking this part behind the
                  scenes?</p>
               <p>No words can more fitly describe the abject state to which that vehemently moral
                  old soul was reduced.</p>
               <p>When it came to the hanging of Haman, the difficulties thickened. Polly warned us
                  that we must by no means attempt to hang Bose by the neck, as "the crittur was
                  heavy, and 't was sartin to be the death of him." So we compromised by passing the
                  rope under his fore paws, or, as Tina called it, "under his arms." But Bose was
                  rheumatic, and it took all Tina's petting and caressing, and obliged Polly to go
                  down and hunt out two or three slices of meat from her larder, to induce him
                  fairly to submit to the operation; but hang him we did, and he ki-hied with a
                  vigor that strikingly increased the moral effect. So we soon let him down again,
                  and plentifully rewarded him with cold meat.</p>
               <p>In a similar manner we performed a patriotic drama, entitled "The Battle of Bunker
                  Hill," in which a couple of old guns that we found in the garret produced splendid
                  effects, and salvoes of artillery were created by the rolling across the garret of
                  two old cannon-balls; but this was suppressed by order of the authorities, on
                  account of the vigor of the cannonade. Tina, by the by, figured in this as the
                  "Genius of Liberty," with some stars on her head cut out of gilt paper, and
                  wearing an old flag which we had pulled out of one of the trunks.</p>
               <p>We also acted the history of "Romulus and Remus," with Bose for the she-wolf. The
                  difference in age was remedied by a vigorous effort of the imagination. Of course,
                  operations of this nature made us pretty familiar with the topography of the old
                  garret. There was, however, one quarter, fenced off by some barrels filled with
                  pamphlets, where Polly strictly forbade us to go.</p>
               <p>What was the result of such a prohibition, O reader? Can you imagine it to be any
                  other than that that part of the garret became at once the only one that we really
                  cared about investigating? How we hung about it, and considered it, and peeped
                  over and around and between the barrels at a pile of pictures, that stood with
                  their faces to the wall! What were those pictures, we wondered. When we asked
                  Polly this, she drew on a mysterious face and said, "<emph>Them</emph> was things
                  we must n't ask about."</p>
               <p>We talked it over among ourselves, and Tina assured us that she dreamed about it
                  nights; but Polly had strictly forbidden us even to mention that corner of the
                  garret to Miss Mehitable, or to ask her leave to look at it, alleging, as a
                  reason, that "'t would bring on her hypos."</p>
               <p>We did n't know what "hypos" were, but we supposed of course they must be
                  something dreadful; but the very fearfulness of the consequences that might ensue
                  from our getting behind those fatal barrels only made them still more attractive.
                  Finally, one rainy Saturday afternoon, when we were tired of acting plays, and the
                  rain pattered on the roof, and the wind howled and shook the casings, and there
                  was a generally wild and disorganized state of affairs out of doors, a sympathetic
                  spirit of insubordination appeared to awaken in Tina's bosom. "I declare, I am
                  going inside of those barrels!" she said. "I don't care if Polly does scold us; I
                  know I can bring her all round again fast enough. I can do about what I like with
                  Polly. Now you boys just move this barrel a little bit, and I 'll go in and
                  see!"</p>
               <p>Just at this moment there was one of those chance lulls in the storm that
                  sometimes occur, and as Tina went in behind the<pb n="334-335"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000172"/> barrels, and boldly turned the first picture, a ray
                  of sunshine streamed through the dusky window and lit it up with a watery
                  light.</p>
               <p>Harry and Tina both gave an exclamation of astonishment.</p>
               <p>"O Tina! it's the lady in the closet!"</p>
               <p>The discovery seemed really to frighten the child. She retreated quickly to the
                  outside of the barrels again, and stood with us, looking at the picture.</p>
               <p>It was a pastel of a young girl in a plain, low-necked white dress, with a
                  haughty, beautiful head, and jet-black curls flowing down her neck, and deep,
                  melancholy black eyes, that seemed to fix themselves reproachfully on us.</p>
               <p>"O dear me, Harry, what shall we do?" said Tina. "How she looks at us! This
                  certainly is the very same one that we saw in the old house."</p>
               <p>"You ought not to have done it, Tina," said Harry, in a rather low and frightened
                  voice; "but I'll go in and turn it back again."</p>
               <p>Just at this moment we heard what was still more appalling,—the footsteps of Polly
                  on the garret stairs.</p>
               <p>"Well! now I should like to know if there 's any mischief you would n't be up to,
                  Tina Percival," she said, coming forward, reproachfully. "When I give you the run
                  of the whole garret, and wear my life out a pickin' up and puttin' up after you, I
                  sh'd think you might let this 'ere corner alone!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! but, Polly, you 've no idea how I wanted to see it, and <emph>do</emph> pray
                  tell me who it is, and how came it here? Is it anybody that's dead?" said Tina,
                  hanging upon Polly caressingly.</p>
               <p>"Somebody that's dead to us, I 'm afraid," said Polly, solemnly.</p>
               <p>"Do tell us, Polly, <emph>do!</emph> who was she?"</p>
               <p>"Well, child, you must n't <emph>never</emph> tell nobody, nor let a word about it
                  come out of your lips; but it's Parson Rossiter's daughter Emily, and where she's
                  gone to, the Lord only knows. I took that 'ere pictur' down myself, and put it up
                  here with Mr. Theodore's, so 't Miss Mehitable need n't see 'em, 'cause they
                  always give her the hypos."</p>
               <p>"And don't anybody know where she is," said Tina, "or if she 's alive or
                  dead?"</p>
               <p>"Nobody," said Polly, shaking her head solemnly. "All I hope is, she may never
                  come back here again. You see, children, what comes o' follerin' the nateral
                  heart; it's deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. She followed her
                  nateral heart, and nobody knows where she 's gone to."</p>
               <p>Polly spoke with such sepulchral earnestness that, what with gloomy weather and
                  the consciousness of having been accessory to an unlawful action, we all felt, to
                  say the least, extremely sober.</p>
               <p>"Do you think I have got such a heart as that?" said Tina, after a deep-drawn
                  sigh.</p>
               <p>"Sartain, you have," said the old woman. "We all on us has. Why, if the Lord
                  should give any on us a sight o' our own heart just as it is, it would strike us
                  down dead right on the spot."</p>
               <p>"Mercy on us, Polly! I hope he won't, then," said Tina. "But, Polly," she added,
                  getting her arms round her neck and playing with her gold beads, "<emph>you</emph>
                  have n't got such a very bad heart now; I don't believe a word of it. I 'm sure
                  you are just as <emph>good</emph> as can be."</p>
               <p>"Law, Miss Tina, you don't see into me," said Polly, who, after all, felt a sort
                  of ameliorating gleam stealing over her. "You must n't try to wheedle me into
                  thinking better of myself than I be; that would just lead to carnal security."</p>
               <p>"Well, Polly, don't tell Miss Mehitable, and I 'll try and not get you into carnal
                  security."</p>
               <p>Polly went behind the barrels, gently wiped the dust from the picture, and turned
                  the melancholy, beseeching face to the wall again; but we pondered and talked many
                  days as to what it might be.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOW WE KEPT THANKSGIVING AT OLDTOWN.</head>
               <p>ON the whole, about this time in our life we were a reasonably happy set of
                  children. The Thanksgiving festival of that year is particularly impressed on my
                  mind as a white day.</p>
               <p>Are there any of my readers who do not know what Thanksgiving day is to a child?
                  Then let them go back with me, and recall the image of it as we kept it in
                  Oldtown.</p>
               <p>People have often supposed, because the Puritans founded a society where there
                  were no professed public amusements, that therefore there was no fun going on in
                  the ancient land of Israel, and that there were no cakes and ale, because they
                  were virtuous. They were never more mistaken in their lives. There was an
                  abundance of sober, well-considered merriment; and the hinges of life were well
                  oiled with that sort of secret humor which to this day gives the raciness to real
                  Yankee wit. Besides this, we must remember that life itself is the greatest
                  possible amusement to people who really believe they can do much with it,—who have
                  that intense sense of what can be brought to pass by human effort, that was
                  characteristic of the New England colonies. To such it is not exactly proper to
                  say that life is an amusement, but it certainly is an engrossing interest that
                  takes the place of all amusements.</p>
               <p>Looking over the world on a broad scale, do we not find that public entertainments
                  have very generally been the sops thrown out by engrossing upper classes to keep
                  lower classes from inquiring too particularly into their rights, and to make them
                  satisfied with a stone, when it was not quite convenient to give them bread?
                  Wherever there is a class that is to be made content to be plundered of its
                  rights, there is an abundance of fiddling and dancing, and amusements, public and
                  private, are in great requisition sition. It may also be set down, I think, as a
                  general axiom, that people feel the need of amusements less and less, precisely in
                  proportion as they have solid reasons for being happy.</p>
               <p>Our good Puritan fathers intended to form a state of society of such equality of
                  conditions, and to make the means of securing the goods of life so free to all,
                  that everybody should find abundant employment for his faculties in a prosperous
                  seeking of his fortunes. Hence, while they forbade theatres, operas, and dances,
                  they made a state of unparalleled peace and prosperity, where one could go to
                  sleep at all hours of day or night with the house door wide open, without bolt or
                  bar, yet without apprehension of any to molest or make afraid.</p>
               <p>There were, however, some few national fêtes:—Election day, when the Governor took
                  his seat with pomp and rejoicing, and all the housewives outdid themselves in
                  election cake, and one or two training days, when all the children were refreshed,
                  and our military ardor quickened, by the roll of drums, and the flash of steel
                  bayonets, and marchings and evolutions,—sometimes ending in that sublimest of
                  military operations, a sham fight, in which nobody was killed. The Fourth of July
                  took high rank, after the Declaration of Independence; but the king and high
                  priest of all festivals was the autumn Thanksgiving.</p>
               <p>When the apples were all gathered and the cider was all made, and the yellow
                  pumpkins were rolled in from many a hill in billows of gold, and the corn was
                  husked, and the labors of the season were done, and the warm, late days of Indian
                  Summer came in, dreamy and calm and still, with just frost enough to crisp the
                  ground of a morning, but with warm trances of benignant, sunny hours at noon,
                  there came over the community a sort of genial repose of spirit,—a sense of
                  something accomplished, and of a new golden mark made in advance on the calendar
                  of life,—and the deacon began to say to the minister, of a Sunday, "I suppose it's
                  about time for the Thanksgiving proclamation."</p>
               <p>Rural dress-makers about this time were extremely busy in making up festival
                  garments, for everybody's new dress, if she was to have one at all, must appear on
                  Thanksgiving day.</p>
               <p>Aunt Keziah and Aunt Lois and my mother talked over their<pb n="338-339"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000174"/> bonnets, and turned them round and round on their
                  hands, and discoursed sagely of ribbons and linings, and of all the kindred
                  bonnets that there were in the parish, and how they would probably appear after
                  Thanksgiving. My grandmother, whose mind had long ceased to wander on such worldly
                  vanities, was at this time officiously reminded by her daughters that her bonnet
                  was n't respectable, or it was announced to her that she <emph>must</emph> have a
                  new gown. Such were the distant horizon gleams of the Thanksgiving festival.</p>
               <p>We also felt its approach in all departments of the household,—the conversation at
                  this time beginning to turn on high and solemn culinary mysteries and receipts of
                  wondrous power and virtue. New modes of elaborating squash pies and quince tarts
                  were now ofttimes carefully discussed at the evening fireside by Aunt Lois and
                  Aunt Keziah, and notes seriously compared with the experiences of certain other
                  Aunties of high repute in such matters. I noticed that on these occasions their
                  voices often fell into mysterious whispers, and that receipts of especial power
                  and sanctity were communicated in tones so low as entirely to escape the vulgar
                  ear. I still remember the solemn shake of the head with which my Aunt Lois
                  conveyed to Miss Mehitable Rossiter the critical properties of <emph>mace,</emph>
                  in relation to its powers of producing in corn fritters a suggestive resemblance
                  to oysters. As ours was an oyster-getting district, and as that charming bivalve
                  was perfectly easy to come at, the interest of such an imitation can be accounted
                  for only by the fondness of the human mind for works of art.</p>
               <p>For as much as a week beforehand, "we children" were employed in chopping mince
                  for pies to a most wearisome fineness, and in pounding cinnamon, allspice, and
                  cloves in a great lignum-vitæ mortar; and the sound of this pounding and chopping
                  reechoed through all the rafters of the old house with a hearty and vigorous
                  cheer, most refreshing to our spirits.</p>
               <p>In those days there were none of the thousand ameliorations of the labors of
                  housekeeping which have since arisen,—no ground and prepared spices and sweet
                  herbs; everything came into our hands in the rough, and in bulk, and the reducing
                  of it into a state for use was deemed one of the appropriate labors of childhood.
                  Even the very salt that we used in cooking was rock-salt, which we were required
                  to wash and dry and pound and sift, before it became fit for use.</p>
               <p>At other times of the year we sometimes murmured at these labors, but those that
                  were supposed to usher in the great Thanksgiving festival were always entered into
                  with enthusiasm. There were signs of richness all around us,—stoning of raisins,
                  cutting of citron, slicing of candied orange-peel. Yet all these were only
                  dawnings and intimations of what was coming during the week of real preparation,
                  after the Governor's proclamation had been read.</p>
               <p>The glories of that proclamation! We knew beforehand the Sunday it was to be read,
                  and walked to church with alacrity, filled with gorgeous and vague
                  expectations.</p>
               <p>The cheering anticipation sustained us through what seemed to us the long waste of
                  the sermon and prayers; and when at last the auspicious moment approached,—when
                  the last quaver of the last hymn had died out,—the whole house rippled with a
                  general movement of complacency, and a satisfied smile of pleased expectation
                  might be seen gleaming on the faces of all the young people, like a ray of
                  sunshine through a garden of flowers.</p>
               <p>Thanksgiving now was dawning! We children poked one another, and fairly giggled
                  with unreproved delight as we listened to the crackle of the slowly unfolding
                  document. That great sheet of paper impressed us as something supernatural, by
                  reason of its mighty size, and by the broad seal of the State affixed thereto; and
                  when the minister read therefrom, "By his Excellency, the Governor of the
                  Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a Proclamation," our mirth was with difficulty
                  repressed by admonitory glances from our sympathetic elders. Then, after a solemn
                  enumeration of the benefits which the Commonwealth had that year received at the
                  hands of Divine Providence, came at last the naming of the eventful day, and, at
                  the end of all, the imposing heraldic words, "God save the Commonwealth of
                  Massachusetts." And then, as the congregation<pb n="340-341"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000175"/> gation broke up and dispersed, all went their
                  several ways with schemes of mirth and feasting in their heads.</p>
               <p>And now came on the week in earnest. In the very watches of the night preceding
                  Monday morning, a preternatural stir below stairs, and the thunder of the
                  pounding-barrel, announced that the washing was to be got out of the way before
                  daylight, so as to give "ample scope and room enough" for the more pleasing duties
                  of the season.</p>
               <p>The making of <emph>pies</emph> at this period assumed vast proportions that
                  verged upon the sublime. Pies were made by forties and fifties and hundreds, and
                  made of everything on the earth and under the earth.</p>
               <p>The pie is an English institution, which, planted on American soil, forthwith ran
                  rampant and burst forth into an untold variety of genera and species. Not merely
                  the old traditional mince pie, but a thousand strictly American seedlings from
                  that main stock, evinced the power of American housewives to adapt old
                  institutions to new uses. Pumpkin pies, cranberry pies, huckleberry pies, cherry
                  pies, green-currant pies, peach, pear, and plum pies, custard pies, apple pies,
                  Marlborough-pudding pies,—pies with top crusts, and pies without,—pies adorned
                  with all sorts of fanciful flutings and architectural strips laid across and
                  around, and otherwise varied, attested the boundless fertility of the feminine
                  mind, when once let loose in a given direction.</p>
               <p>Fancy the heat and vigor of the great pan-formation, when Aunt Lois and Aunt
                  Keziah, and my mother and grandmother, all in ecstasies of creative inspiration,
                  ran, bustled, and hurried,—mixing, rolling, tasting, consulting,—alternately
                  setting us children to work when anything could be made of us, and then chasing us
                  all out of the kitchen when our misinformed childhood ventured to take too many
                  liberties with sacred mysteries. Then out we would all fly at the kitchen door,
                  like sparks from a blacksmith's window.</p>
               <p>On these occasions, as there was a great looseness in the police department over
                  us children, we usually found a ready refuge at Miss Mehitable's with Tina, who,
                  confident of the strength of her position with Polly, invited us into the kitchen,
                  and with the air of a mistress led us around to view the proceedings there.</p>
               <p>A genius for entertaining was one of Tina's principal characteristics; and she did
                  not fail to make free with raisins, or citron, or whatever came to hand, in a
                  spirit of hospitality at which Polly seriously demurred. That worthy woman
                  occasionally felt the inconvenience of the state of subjugation to which the
                  little elf had somehow or other reduced her, and sometimes rattled her chains
                  fiercely, scolding with a vigor which rather alarmed us, but which Tina minded not
                  a whit. Confident of her own powers, she would, in the very midst of her wrath,
                  mimic her to her face with such irresistible drollery as to cause the torrent of
                  reproof to end in a dissonant laugh, accompanied by a submissive cry for
                  quarter.</p>
               <p>"I declare, Tina Percival," she said to her one day, "you 're saucy enough to
                  physic a horn-bug! I never did see the beater of you! If Miss Mehitable don't keep
                  you in better order, I don't see what 's to become of any of us!"</p>
               <p>"Why, what did become of you before I came?" was the undismayed reply. "You know,
                  Polly, you and Aunty both were just as lonesome as you could be till I came here,
                  and you never had such pleasant times in your life as you 've had since I've been
                  here. You 're a couple of old beauties, both of you, and know just how to get
                  along with me. But come, boys, let's take our raisins and go up in the garret and
                  play Thanksgiving."</p>
               <p>In the corner of the great kitchen, during all these days, the jolly old oven
                  roared and crackled in great volcanic billows of flame, snapping and gurgling as
                  if the old fellow entered with joyful sympathy into the frolic of the hour; and
                  then, his great heart being once warmed up, he brooded over successive generations
                  of pies and cakes, which went in raw and came out cooked, till butteries and
                  dressers and shelves and pantries were literally crowded with a jostling
                  abundance.</p>
               <p>A great cold northern chamber, where the sun never shone, and where in winter the
                  snow sifted in at the window-cracks, and ice and frost reigned with undisputed
                  sway, was fitted up to be the storehouse of these surplus treasures. There, frozen
                  solid, and thus well preserved in their icy fetters, they formed a great
                  repository for all the winter months; and the pies baked at<pb n="342-343"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000176"/> Thanksgiving often came out fresh and good with the
                  violets of April.</p>
               <p>During this eventful preparation week, all the female part of my grandmother's
                  household, as I have before remarked, were at a height above any ordinary state of
                  mind,—they moved about the house rapt in a species of prophetic frenzy. It seemed
                  to be considered a necessary feature of such festivals, that everybody should be
                  in a hurry, and everything in the house should be turned bottom upwards with
                  enthusiasm,—so at least we children understood it, and we certainly did our part
                  to keep the ball rolling.</p>
               <p>At this period the constitutional activity of Uncle Fliakim increased to a degree
                  that might fairly be called preternatural. Thanksgiving time was the time for
                  errands of mercy and beneficence through the country; and Uncle Fliakim's immortal
                  old rubber horse and rattling wagon were on the full jump, in tours of
                  investigation into everybody's affairs in the region around. On returning, he
                  would fly through our kitchen like the wind, leaving open the doors, upsetting
                  whatever came in his way,—now a pan of milk, and now a basin of mince,—talking
                  rapidly, and forgetting only the point in every case that gave it significance, or
                  enabled any one to put it to any sort of use. When Aunt Lois checked his
                  benevolent effusions by putting the test questions of practical efficiency, Uncle
                  Fliakim always remembered that he 'd "forgotten to inquire about that," and
                  skipping through the kitchen, and springing into his old wagon, would rattle off
                  again on a full tilt to correct and amend his investigations.</p>
               <p>Moreover, my grandmother's kitchen at this time began to be haunted by those
                  occasional hangers-on and retainers, of uncertain fortunes, whom a full experience
                  of her bountiful habits led to expect something at her hand at this time of the
                  year. All the poor, loafing tribes, Indian and half-Indian, who at other times
                  wandered, selling baskets and other light wares, were sure to come back to Oldtown
                  a little before Thanksgiving time, and report themselves in my grandmother's
                  kitchen.</p>
               <p>The great hogshead of cider in the cellar, which my grandfather called the Indian
                  Hogshead, was on tap at all hours of the day; and many a mugful did I draw and
                  dispense to the tribes that basked in the sunshine at our door.</p>
               <p>Aunt Lois never had a hearty conviction of the propriety of these arrangements;
                  but my grandmother, who had a prodigious verbal memory, bore down upon her with
                  such strings of quotations from the Old Testament that she was utterly routed.</p>
               <p>"Now," says my Aunt Lois, "I s'pose we 've got to have Betty Poganut and Sally
                  Wonsamug, and old Obscue and his wife, and the whole tribe down, roosting around
                  our doors, till we give 'em something. That 's just mother's way; she always keeps
                  a whole generation at her heels."</p>
               <p>"How many times must I tell you, Lois, to read your Bible?" was my grandmother's
                  rejoinder; and loud over the sound of pounding and chopping in the kitchen could
                  be heard the voice of her quotations: "If there be among you a poor man in any of
                  the gates of the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden
                  thy heart, nor shut thy hand, from thy poor brother. Thou shalt surely give him;
                  and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest to him, because that for this
                  thing the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works; for the poor shall never
                  cease from out of the land."</p>
               <p>These words seemed to resound like a sort of heraldic proclamation to call around
                  us all that softly shiftless class, who, for some reason or other, are never to be
                  found with anything in hand at the moment that it is wanted.</p>
               <p>"There, to be sure," said Aunt Lois, one day when our preparations were in full
                  blast,—"there comes Sam Lawson down the hill, limpsy as ever; now he 'll have his
                  doleful story to tell, and mother 'll give him one of the turkeys."</p>
               <p>And so, of course, it fell out,</p>
               <p>Sam came in with his usual air of plaintive assurance, and seated himself a
                  contemplative spectator in the chimney-corner, regardless of the looks and signs
                  of unwelcome on the part of Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, how prosperous everything does seem here!" he said, in musing tones,
                  over his inevitable mug of cider; "so different from what 't is t' our house.
                  There 's Hepsy, she 's all<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7953-00000177"/> in a stew,
                  an' I 've just been an' got her thirty-seven cents' wuth o' nutmegs, yet she says
                  she 's sure she don't see how she 's to keep Thanksgiving, an' she 's down on me
                  about it, just as ef 't was my fault. Yeh see, last winter our old gobbler got
                  froze. You know, Mis' Badger, that 'ere cold night we hed last winter. Wal, I was
                  off with Jake Marshall that night; ye see, Jake, he hed to take old General
                  Dearborn's corpse into Boston, to the family vault, and Jake, he kind o' hated to
                  go alone; 't was a drefful cold time, and he ses to me, 'Sam, you jes' go 'long
                  with me'; so I was sort o' sorry for him, and I kind o' thought I 'd go 'long.
                  Wal, come 'long to Josh Bissel's tahvern, there at the Half-way House, you know,
                  't was so swinging cold we stopped to take a little suthin' warmin', an' we sort
                  o' sot an' sot over the fire, till, fust we knew, we kind o' got asleep; an' when
                  we woke up we found we 'd left the old General hitched up t' th' post pretty much
                  all night. Wal, did n't hurt him none, poor man; 't was allers a favorite spot o'
                  his'n. But, takin' one thing with another, I did n't get home till about noon next
                  day, an', I tell you, Hepsy she was right down on me. She said the baby was sick,
                  and there had n't been no wood split, nor the barn fastened up, nor nothin'. Lordy
                  massy, I did n't mean no harm; I thought there was wood enough, and I thought
                  likely Hepsy 'd git out an' fasten up the barn. But Hepsy, she was in one o' her
                  contrary streaks, an' she would n't do a thing; an', when I went out to look, why,
                  sure 'nuff, there was our old tom-turkey froze as stiff as a stake,—his claws jist
                  a stickin' right straight up like this." Here Sam struck an expressive attitude,
                  and looked so much like a frozen turkey as to give a pathetic reality to the
                  picture.</p>
               <p>"Well now, Sam, why need you be off on things that 's none of your business?" said
                  my grandmother. "I 've talked to you plainly about that a great many times, Sam,"
                  she continued, in tones of severe admonition. "Hepsy is a hard-working woman, but
                  she can't be expected to see to everything, and you oughter 'ave been at home that
                  night to fasten up your own barn and look after your own creeturs."</p>
               <p>Sam took the rebuke all the more meekly as he perceived the stiff black legs of a
                  turkey poking out from under my grandmother's apron while she was delivering it.
                  To be exhorted and told of his shortcomings, and then furnished with a turkey at
                  Thanksgiving, was a yearly part of his family programme. In time he departed, not
                  only with the turkey, but with us boys in procession after him, bearing a mince
                  and a pumpkin pie for Hepsy's children.</p>
               <p>"Poor things!" my grandmother remarked; "they ought to have something good to eat
                  Thanksgiving day; 't ain't their fault that they 've got a shiftless father."</p>
               <p>Sam, in his turn, moralized to us children, as we walked beside him: "A body 'd
                  think that Hepsy 'd learn to trust in Providence," he said, "but she don't. She
                  allers has a Thanksgiving dinner pervided; but that 'ere woman ain't grateful for
                  it, by no manner o' means. Now she 'll be jest as cross as she can be, 'cause this
                  'ere ain't <emph>our</emph> turkey, and these 'ere ain't our pies. Folks doos lose
                  so much, that hes sech dispositions."</p>
               <p>A multitude of similar dispensations during the course of the week materially
                  reduced the great pile of chickens and turkeys which black Cæsar's efforts in
                  slaughtering, picking, and dressing kept daily supplied.</p>
               <p>Besides these offerings to the poor, the handsomest turkey of the flock was sent,
                  dressed in first-rate style, with Deacon Badger's dutiful compliments, to the
                  minister; and we children, who were happy to accompany black Cæsar on this errand,
                  generally received a seed-cake and a word of acknowledgment from the minister's
                  lady.</p>
               <p>Well, at last, when all the chopping and pounding and baking and brewing,
                  preparatory to the festival, were gone through with, the eventful day dawned. All
                  the tribes of the Badger family were to come back home to the old house, with all
                  the relations of every degree, to eat the Thanksgiving dinner. And it was
                  understood that in the evening the minister and his lady would look in upon us,
                  together with some of the select aristocracy of Oldtown.</p>
               <p>Great as the preparations were for the dinner, everything was so contrived that
                  not a soul in the house should be kept from the<pb n="346-347"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000178"/> morning service of Thanksgiving in the church, and
                  from listening to the Thanksgiving sermon, in which the minister was expected to
                  express his views freely concerning the politics of the country, and the state of
                  things in society generally, in a somewhat more secular vein of thought than was
                  deemed exactly appropriate to the Lord's day. But it is to be confessed, that,
                  when the good man got carried away by the enthusiasm of his subject to extend
                  these exercises beyond a certain length, anxious glances, exchanged between good
                  wives, sometimes indicated a weakness of the flesh, having a tender reference to
                  the turkeys and chickens and chicken pies, which might possibly be overdoing in
                  the ovens at home. But your old brick oven was a true Puritan institution, and
                  backed up the devotional habits of good housewives, by the capital care which he
                  took of whatever was committed to his capacious bosom. A truly well-bred oven
                  would have been ashamed of himself all his days, and blushed redder than his own
                  fires, if a God-fearing house-matron, away at the temple of the Lord, should come
                  home and find her pie-crust either burned or underdone by his over or under zeal;
                  so the old fellow generally managed to bring things out exactly right.</p>
               <p>When sermons and prayers were all over, we children rushed home to see the great
                  feast of the year spread.</p>
               <p>What chitterings and chatterings there were all over the house, as all the aunties
                  and uncles and cousins came pouring in, taking off their things, looking at one
                  another's bonnets and dresses, and mingling their comments on the morning sermon
                  with various opinions on the new millinery outfits, and with bits of home news,
                  and kindly neighborhood gossip.</p>
               <p>Uncle Bill, whom the Cambridge college authorities released, as they did all the
                  other youngsters of the land, for Thanksgiving day, made a breezy stir among them
                  all, especially with the young cousins of the feminine gender.</p>
               <p>The best room on this occasion was thrown wide open, and its habitual coldness had
                  been warmed by the burning down of a great stack of hickory logs, which had been
                  heaped up unsparingly since morning. It takes some hours to get a room warm, where
                  a family never sits, and which therefore has not in its walls one particle of the
                  genial vitality which comes from the in-dwelling of human beings. But on
                  Thanksgiving day, at least, every year, this marvel was effected in our best
                  room.</p>
               <p>Although all servile labor and vain recreation on this day were by law forbidden,
                  according to the terms of the proclamation, it was not held to be a violation of
                  the precept, that all the nice old aunties should bring their knitting-work and
                  sit gently trotting their needles around the fire; nor that Uncle Bill should
                  start a full-fledged romp among the girls and children, while the dinner was being
                  set on the long table in the neighboring kitchen. Certain of the good elderly
                  female relatives, of serious and discreet demeanor, assisted at this
                  operation.</p>
               <p>But who shall do justice to the dinner, and describe the turkey, and chickens, and
                  chicken pies, with all that endless variety of vegetables which the American soil
                  and climate have contributed to the table, and which, without regard to the French
                  doctrine of courses, were all piled together in jovial abundance upon the smoking
                  board? There was much carving and laughing and talking and eating, and all showed
                  that cheerful ability to despatch the provisions which was the ruling spirit of
                  the hour. After the meat came the plum-puddings, and then the endless array of
                  pies, till human nature was actually bewildered and overpowered by the tempting
                  variety; and even we children turned from the profusion offered to us, and
                  wondered what was the matter that we could eat no more.</p>
               <p>When all was over, my grandfather rose at the head of the table, and a fine
                  venerable picture he made as he stood there, his silver hair flowing in curls down
                  each side of his clear, calm face, while, in conformity to the old Puritan custom,
                  he called their attention to a recital of the mercies of God in his dealings with
                  their family.</p>
               <p>It was a sort of family history, going over and touching upon the various events
                  which had happened. He spoke of my father's death, and gave a tribute to his
                  memory; and closed all with the application of a time-honored text, expressing the
                  hope that as years passed by we might "so number our days as to apply<pb
                     n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7953-00000179"/> our hearts unto wisdom"; and then he
                  gave out that psalm which in those days might be called the national hymn of the
                  Puritans. <q>

               <p>This we all united in singing to the venerable tune of St. Martin's, an air which,
                  the reader will perceive, by its multiplicity of quavers and inflections gave the
                  greatest possible scope to the cracked and trembling voices of the ancients, who
                  united in it with even more zeal than the younger part of the community.</p>
               <p>Uncle Fliakim Sheril, furbished up in a new crisp black suit, and with his
                  spindle-shanks trimly incased in the smoothest of black silk stockings, looking
                  for all the world just like an alert and spirited black cricket, outdid himself on
                  this occasion in singing <emph>counter,</emph> in that high, weird voice that he
                  must have learned from the wintry winds that usually piped around the corners of
                  the old house. But any one who looked at him, as he sat with his eyes closed,
                  beating time with head and hand, and, in short, with every limb of his body, must
                  have perceived the exquisite satisfaction which he derived from this mode of
                  expressing himself. I much regret to be obliged to state that my graceless Uncle
                  Bill, taking advantage of the fact that the eyes of all his elders were
                  devotionally closed, stationing himself a little in the rear of my Uncle Fliakim,
                  performed an exact imitation of his<emph>counter,</emph> with such a killing
                  facility that all the younger part of the audience were nearly dead with
                  suppressed laughter. Aunt Lois, who never shut her eyes a moment on any occasion,
                  discerned this from a distant part of the room, and in vain endeavored to stop it
                  by vigorously shaking her head at the offender. She might as well have shaken it
                  at a bobolink tilting on a clover-top. In fact, Uncle Bill was Aunt Lois's weak
                  point, and the corners of her own mouth were observed to twitch in such a
                  suspicious manner that the whole moral force of her admonition was destroyed.</p>
               <p>And now, the dinner being cleared away, we youngsters, already excited to a tumult
                  of laughter, tumbled into the best room, under the supervision of Uncle Bill, to
                  relieve ourselves with a game of "blind-man's-buff," while the elderly women
                  washed up the dishes and got the house in order, and the men-folks went out to the
                  barn to look at the cattle, and walked over the farm and talked of the crops.</p>
               <p>In the evening the house was all open and lighted with the best of tallow candles,
                  which Aunt Lois herself had made with especial care for this illumination. It was
                  understood that we were to have a dance, and black Cæsar, full of turkey and
                  pumpkin pie, and giggling in the very jollity of his heart, had that afternoon
                  rosined his bow, and tuned his fiddle, and practised jigs and Virginia reels, in a
                  way that made us children think him a perfect Orpheus.</p>
               <p>As soon as the candles were lighted came in Miss Mehitable with her brother
                  Jonathan, and Tina, like a gay little tassel, hanging on her withered arm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jonathan Rossiter was a tall, well-made man, with a clear-cut, aquiline
                  profile, and high round forehead, from which his powdered hair was brushed
                  smoothly back and hung down behind in a long cue. His eyes were of a piercing dark
                  gray, with that peculiar expression of depth and intensity which marks a
                  melancholy temperament. He had a large mouth, which he kept shut with an air of
                  firmness that suggested something even hard and dictatorial in his nature. He was
                  quick and alert in all his movements, and his eyes had a searching quickness of<pb
                     n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7953-00000180"/> observation, which seemed to lose
                  nothing of what took place around him. There was an air of breeding and
                  self-command about him; and in all his involuntary ways he bore the appearance of
                  a man more interested to make up a judgment of others than concerned as to what
                  their judgment might be about himself.</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable hung upon his arm with an evident admiration and pride, which
                  showed that when he came he made summer at least for her.</p>
               <p>After them soon arrived the minister and his lady,—she in a grand brocade satin
                  dress, open in front to display a petticoat brocaded with silver flowers. With her
                  well-formed hands shining out of a shimmer of costly lace, and her feet propped on
                  high-heeled shoes, Lady Lothrop justified the prestige of good society which
                  always hung about her. Her lord and master, in the spotless whiteness of his
                  ruffles on wrist and bosom, and in the immaculate keeping and neatness of all his
                  clerical black, and the perfect <emph>pose</emph> of his grand full-bottomed
                  clerical wig, did honor to her conjugal cares. They moved through the room like a
                  royal prince and princess, with an appropriate, gracious, well-considered word for
                  each and every one. They even returned, with punctilious civility, the awe-struck
                  obeisance of black Cæsar, who giggled over straightway with joy and exultation at
                  the honor.</p>
               <p>But conceive of my Aunt Lois's pride of heart, when, following in the train of
                  these august persons, actually came Ellery Davenport, bringing upon his arm Miss
                  Deborah Kittery. Here was a situation! Had the whole island of Great Britain waded
                  across the Atlantic Ocean to call on Bunker Hill, the circumstance could scarcely
                  have seemed to her more critical.</p>
               <p>"Mercy on us!" she thought to herself, "all these Episcopalians coming! I do hope
                  mother 'll be careful; I hope she won't feel it necessary to give them a piece of
                  her mind, as she's always doing."</p>
               <p>Miss Deborah Kittery, however, knew her soundings, and was too genuine an
                  Englishwoman not to know that "every man's house is his castle," and that one must
                  respect one's neighbor's opinions on his own ground.</p>
               <p>As to my grandmother, her broad and buxom heart on this evening was so full of
                  motherliness, that she could have patted the very King of England on the head, if
                  he had been there, and comforted his soul with the assurance that she supposed he
                  meant well, though he did n't exactly know how to manage; so, although she had a
                  full consciousness that Miss Deborah Kittery had turned all America over to
                  uncovenanted mercies, she nevertheless shook her warmly by the hand, and told her
                  she hoped she'd make herself at home. And I think she would have done exactly the
                  same by the Pope of Rome himself, if that poor heathen sinner had presented
                  himself on Thanksgiving evening. So vast and billowy was the ocean of her
                  loving-kindness, and so firmly were her feet planted on the rock of the Cambridge
                  Platform, that on it she could stand breathing prayers for all Jews, Turks,
                  Infidels, Tories, Episcopalians, and even Roman Catholics. The very man that burnt
                  Mr. John Rogers might have had a mug of cider in the kitchen on this evening, with
                  an exhortation to go and sin no more.</p>
               <p>You may imagine the astounding wassail among the young people, when two such
                  spirits as Ellery Davenport and my Uncle Bill were pushing each other on, in one
                  house. My Uncle Bill related the story of "the Wry-mouth Family," with such twists
                  and contortions and killing extremes of the ludicrous as perfectly overcame even
                  the minister; and he was to be seen, at one period of the evening, with a face
                  purple with laughter, and the tears actually rolling down over his well-formed
                  cheeks, while some of the more excitable young people almost fell in trances, and
                  rolled on the floor in the extreme of their merriment. In fact, the assemblage was
                  becoming so tumultuous, that the scrape of Cæsar's violin, and the forming of sets
                  for a dance, seemed necessary to restore the peace.</p>
               <p>Whenever or wherever it was that the idea of the sinfulness of dancing arose in
                  New England, I know not; it is a certain fact that at Oldtown, at this time, the
                  presence of the minister and his lady was held not to be in the slightest degree
                  incompatible with this amusement. I appeal to many of my readers, if they or their
                  parents could not recall a time in New England<pb n="352-353"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000181"/> when in all the large towns dancing assemblies used
                  to be statedly held, at which the minister and his lady, though never uniting in
                  the dance, always gave an approving attendance, and where all the decorous,
                  respectable old church-members brought their children, and stayed to watch an
                  amusement in which they no longer actively partook. No one looked on with a more
                  placid and patronizing smile than Dr. Lothrop and his lady, as one after another
                  began joining the exercise, which, commencing first with the children and young
                  people, crept gradually upwards among the elders.</p>
               <p>Uncle Bill would insist on leading out Aunt Lois, and the bright color rising to
                  her thin cheeks brought back a fluttering image of what might have been beauty in
                  some fresh, early day. Ellery Davenport insisted upon leading forth Miss Deborah
                  Kittery, notwithstanding her oft-repeated refusals and earnest protestations to
                  the contrary. As to Uncle Fliakim, he jumped and frisked and gyrated among the
                  single sisters and maiden aunts, whirling them into the dance as if he had been
                  the little black gentleman himself. With that true spirit of Christian charity
                  which marked all his actions, he invariably chose out the homeliest and most
                  neglected, and thus worthy Aunt Keziah, dear old soul, was for a time made quite
                  prominent by his attentions.</p>
               <p>Of course the dances in those days were of a strictly moral nature. The very
                  thought of one of the round dances of modern times would have sent Lady Lothrop
                  behind her big fan in helpless confusion, and exploded my grandmother like a
                  full-charged arsenal of indignation. As it was, she stood, her broad, pleased face
                  radiant with satisfaction, as the wave of joyousness crept up higher and higher
                  round her, till the elders, who stood keeping time with their heads and feet,
                  began to tell one another how they had danced with their sweethearts in good old
                  days gone by, and the elder women began to blush and bridle, and boast of steps
                  that they could take in their youth, till the music finally subdued them, and into
                  the dance they went.</p>
               <p>"Well, well!" quoth my grandmother; "they're all at it so hearty, I don't see why
                  I should n't try it myself." And into the Virginia reel she went, amid screams of
                  laughter from all the younger members of the company.</p>
               <p>But I assure you my grandmother was not a woman to be laughed at; for whatever she
                  once set on foot, she "put through" with a sturdy energy befitting a daughter of
                  the Puritans.</p>
               <p>"Why should n't I dance?" she said, when she arrived red and resplendent at the
                  bottom of the set. "Did n't Mr. Despondency and Miss Muchafraid and Mr.
                  Readytohalt all dance together in the Pilgrim's Progress?"—and the minister in his
                  ample flowing wig, and my lady in her stiff brocade, gave to my grandmother a
                  solemn twinkle of approbation.</p>
               <p>As nine o'clock struck, the whole scene dissolved and melted; for what
                  well-regulated village would think of carrying festivities beyond that hour?</p>
               <p>And so ended our Thanksgiving at Oldtown.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE RAID ON OLDTOWN, AND UNCLE FLIAKIM'S BRAVERY.</head>
               <p>THE next morning after Thanksgiving, life resumed its usual hard, laborious
                  course, with a sharp and imperative reaction, such as ensues when a strong spring,
                  which has been for some time held back, is suddenly let fly again.</p>
               <p>Certainly Aunt Lois appeared to be astir fully an hour earlier than usual, and
                  dispelled all our golden visions of chicken pies and dancings and merry-makings,
                  by the flat, hard summons of every-day life. We had no time to become demoralized
                  and softened.</p>
               <p>Breakfast this next morning was half an hour in advance of the usual time, because
                  Aunt Lois was under some vague impression of infinite disturbances in the house,
                  owing to the latitude of the last two weeks, and of great furbishings and repairs
                  to be done in the best room, before it could be again shut up and condemned to
                  silence.</p>
               <p>While we were eating our breakfast, Sam Lawson came in, with an air of great
                  trepidation.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, Mis' Badger! what <emph>do</emph> you s'pose has happened?" he
                  exclaimed, holding up his hands. "Wal! if I ever—no, I never did!"—and, before an
                  explanation could be drawn out of him, in fluttered Uncle Fliakim, and began
                  dancing an indignant rigadoon round the kitchen.</p>
               <p>"Perfectly abominable! the selectmen ought to take it up!" he exclaimed,—"ought to
                  make a State affair of it, and send to the Governor."</p>
               <p>"Do for mercy's sake, Fliakim, sit down, and tell us what the matter is," said my
                  grandmother.</p>
               <p>"I can't! I can't!! I can't!!! I 've just got to hitch right up and go on after
                  'em; and mebbe I 'll catch 'em before they get over the State line. I just wanted
                  to borrow your breech-band, 'cause ours is broke. Where is it? Is it out in the
                  barn, or where?"</p>
               <p>By this time we had all arisen from table, and stood looking at one another, while
                  Uncle Fliakim had shot out of the back door toward the barn. Of course our
                  information must now be got out of Sam Lawson.</p>
               <p>"Wal, you see, Deacon, who ever would ha' thought of it? They 've took every child
                  on 'em, every one!"</p>
               <p>"Who's taken? what children?" said my grandmother. "Do pray begin at the right end
                  of your story, and not come in here scaring a body to death."</p>
               <p>"Wal, it 's Aunt Nancy Prime's children. Last night the kidnappers come to her
                  house an' took her an' every single one of the child'en, an' goin' to carry 'em
                  off to York State for slaves. Jake Marshall, he was round to our house this
                  mornin', an' told me 'bout it. Jake, he 'd ben over to keep Thanksgivin', over t'
                  Aunt Sally Proddy's; an' way over by the ten-mile tahvern he met the waggin, an'
                  Aunt Nancy, she called out to him, an' he heerd one of the fellers swear at her.
                  The' was two fellers in the waggin, an' they was a drivin' like mad, an' I jest
                  come runnin' down to Mr. Sheril's, 'cause I know his horse never gits out of a
                  canter, an' 's pretty much used to bein' twitched up sudden. But, Lordy massy,
                  s'posin' he could ketch up with 'em, what could he do? He could n't much more 'n
                  fly at 'em like an old hen; so I don't see what's to be done."</p>
               <p>"Well," said my grandfather, rising up, "if that 's the case, it 's time we should
                  all be on the move; and I 'll go right over to Israel Scran's, and he and his two
                  sons and I 'll go over, and I guess there 'll be enough of us to teach them
                  reason. These kidnappers always make for the New York State line. Boys, you go out
                  and tackle the old mare, and have our wagon round to the house; and, if Fliakim's
                  wagon will hold together, the two will just carry the party."</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy! I should like to go 'long too," said Sam Lawson. "I hain't got no
                  special business to-day but what could be put off as well as not."</p>
               <p>"You never do have," said Aunt Lois. "That 's the trouble with you."</p>
               <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7953-00000183"/>
               <p>"Wal, I was a thinkin'," said Sam, "that Jake and me hes been over them roads so
                  often, and we kind o' know all the ups an' downs an' cross-roads. Then we 's
                  pretty intimate with some o' them Injun fellers, an' ye git them sot out on a
                  trail arter a body, they 's like a huntin' dog."</p>
               <p>"Well, father," said Aunt Lois, "I think it 's quite likely that Sam may be right
                  here. He certainly knows more about such things than any decent, industrious man
                  ought to, and it 's a pity you should n't put him to some use when you can."</p>
               <p>"Jes' so!" said Sam. "Now, there 's reason in that 'ere; an' I 'll jes' go over to
                  Israel's store with the Deacon. Yeh see ye can't take both the boys, 'cause one on
                  'em 'll have to stay and tend the store; but I tell you what 't is, I ain't no bad
                  of a hand a hittin' a lick at kidnappers. I could pound on 'em as willingly as
                  ever I pounded a horseshoe; an' a woman 's a woman, an' child'en 's child'en, ef
                  they be black; that's jes' my 'pinion."</p>
               <p>"Sam, you 're a good fellow," said my grandmother, approvingly. "But come, go
                  right along."</p>
               <p>Here, now, was something to prevent the wave of yesterday's excitement from
                  flatting down into entire insipidity.</p>
               <p>Harry and I ran over instantly to tell Tina; and Tina with all her eloquence set
                  it forth to Miss Mehitable and Polly, and we gave vent to our emotions by an
                  immediate rush to the garret and a dramatic representation of the whole scene of
                  the rescue, conducted with four or five of Tina's rag-dolls and a little old box
                  wagon, with which we cantered and re-cantered across the garret floor in a way
                  that would have been intolerable to any less patient and indulgent person than
                  Miss Mehitable.</p>
               <p>The fact is, however, that she shared in the universal excitement to such a
                  degree, that she put on her bonnet immediately, and rushed over to the minister's
                  to give vent to her feelings, while Polly, coming up garret, shouldered one of the
                  guns lovingly, and declared she 'd "like nothing better than to fire it off at one
                  o' them fellers"; and then she told us how, in her young days, where she was
                  brought up in Maine, the painters (panthers) used to come round their log cabin at
                  night, and howl and growl; and how they always had to keep the guns loaded; and
                  how once her mother, during her father's absence, had treed a painter, and kept
                  him up in his perch for hours by threatening him whenever he offered to come down,
                  until her husband came home and shot him.</p>
               <p>Pretty stanch, reliant blood, about those times, flowed in the bosoms of the women
                  of New England, and Polly relieved the excitement of her mind this morning by
                  relating to us story after story of the wild forest life of her early days.</p>
               <p>While Polly was thus giving vent to her emotions at home, Miss Mehitable had
                  produced a corresponding excitement in the minister's family. Ellery Davenport
                  declared his prompt intention of going up and joining the pursuing party, as he
                  was young and strong, with all his wits about him; and, with the prestige of rank
                  in the late Revolutionary war, such an accession to the party was of the greatest
                  possible importance. As to Miss Deborah Kittery, she gave it as her opinion that
                  such uprisings against law and order were just what was to be expected in a
                  democracy. "The lower classes, my dear, you know, need to be kept down with a
                  strong hand," she said with an instructive nod of the head; "and I think we shall
                  find that there 's no security in the way things are going on now."</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable and the minister listened with grave amusement while the worthy
                  lady thus delivered herself; and, as they did not reply, she had the comfort of
                  feeling that she had given them something to think of.</p>
               <p>All the village, that day, was in a ferment of expectation; for Aunt Nancy was a
                  general favorite in all the families round, and was sent for in case of elections
                  or weddings or other high merry-makings, so that meddling with her was in fact
                  taking away part of the vested property of Oldtown. The loafers who tilted, with
                  their heels uppermost, on the railings of the tavern veranda, talked stringently
                  of State rights, and some were of opinion that President Washington ought to be
                  apprised of the fact without loss of time. My grandmother went about house in a
                  state of indignation all day, declaring it was a pretty state of things, to be
                  sure, and that, next they should<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7953-00000184"/> know,
                  they should wake up some morning and find that Cæsar had been gobbled up in the
                  night and run off with. But Harry and I calmed the fears which this seemed to
                  excite in his breast, by a vivid description of the two guns over in Miss
                  Mehitable's garret, and of the use that we should certainly make of them in case
                  of an attack on Cæsar.</p>
               <p>The chase, however, was conducted with such fire and ardor that before moonrise on
                  the same night the captives were brought back in triumph to Oldtown village, and
                  lodged for safe-keeping in my grandmother's house, who spared nothing in their
                  entertainment.</p>
               <p>A happy man was Sam Lawson that evening, as he sat in the chimney-corner and
                  sipped his mug of cider, and recounted his adventures.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy! well, 't was providential we took Colonel Devenport 'long with us, I
                  tell you; he talked to them fellers in a way that made 'em shake in their shoes.
                  Why, Lordy massy, when we fust came in sight on 'em, Mr. Sheril an' me, we wus in
                  the foremost waggin, an' we saw 'em before us just as we got to the top of a long,
                  windin' hill, an' I tell you if they did n't whip up an' go lickity-split down
                  that 'ere hill,—I tell you, they rattled them child'en as ef they 'd ben so many
                  punkins, an' I tell you one of 'em darned old young-uns flew right over the side
                  of the waggin, an' jest picked itself up as lively as a cricket, an' never cried.
                  We did n't stop to take it up, but jes' kep' right along arter; an' Mr. Sheril, he
                  hollers out, 'Whoa! whoa! stop! stop thief!' as loud as he could yell; but they
                  jes' laughed at him; but Colonel Devenport, he come ridin' by on horseback, like
                  thunder, an' driv' right by 'em, an' then turned round an' charged down on their
                  horses so it driv' 'em right out the road, an' the waggin was upsot, an' the
                  fellers, they were pitched out, an' in a minute Colonel Devenport had one on 'em
                  by the collar an' his pistol right out to the head o' t'other. 'Now,' ses he, 'if
                  you stir you 're a dead man!'</p>
               <p>"Wal, Mr. Sheril, he made arter the other one,—he always means mighty well, Mr.
                  Sheril does,—he gin a long jump, he did, an' he lit right in the middle of a tuft
                  of blackberry-bushes, an' tore his breeches as ef the heavens an' 'arth was a
                  goin' asunder. Yeh see, they never 'd a got 'em ef 't had n't ben for Colonel
                  Devenport. He kep' the other feller under range of his pistol, an' told him he 'd
                  shoot him ef he stirred; an' the feller, he was scart to death, an' he roared an'
                  begged for mercy in a way 't would ha' done your heart good to hear.</p>
               <p>"Wal, wal! the upshot on 't all was, when Israel Scran come down with his boy
                  (they was in the back waggin), they got out the ropes an' tied 'em up snug, an'
                  have ben a fetchin' on 'em along to jail, where I guess they 'll have one spell o'
                  considerin their ways. But, Lordy massy, yeh never see such a sight as your
                  uncle's breeches wus. Mis' Sheril, she says she never see the beater of him for
                  allus goin' off in his best clothes, 'cause, you see, he heard the news early, an'
                  he jes' whips on his Thanksgivin' clothes an' went off in 'em just as he was. His
                  intentions is allus so good. It 's a pity, though, he don't take more time to
                  consider. Now I think folks ought to take things more moderate. Yeh see, these
                  folks that hurries allus, they gits into scrapes, is just what I 'm allus a
                  tellin' Hepsy."</p>
               <p>"Who were the fellows, do you know?" said my grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Wal, one on 'em was one of them Hessians that come over in the war times,—he is a
                  stupid crittur; but the other is Widdah Huldy Miller's son, down to Black Brook
                  there."</p>
               <p>"Do tell," said my grandmother, with the liveliest concern; "has Eph Miller come
                  to that?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!" said Sam, "it 's Eph, sure enough. He was exalted to heaven in p'int
                  o' privilege, but he took to drink and onstiddy ways in the army, and now here he
                  is in jail. I tell you, I tried to set it home to Eph, when I was a bringin' on
                  him home in the waggin, but, Lordy massy, we don't none of us like to have our
                  sins set in order afore us. There was David, now, he was crank as could be when he
                  thought Nathan was a talkin' about other people's sins. Says David, 'The man that
                  did that shall surely die'; but come to set it home, and say, 'Thou art the man,'
                  David caved right in. 'Lordy massy bless your soul and body, Nathan,' says he, 'I
                  don't want to die.'"</p>
               <p>It will be seen by these edifying moralizings how eminently<pb n="360-361"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000185"/> Scriptural was the course of Sam's mind. In fact,
                  his turn for long-winded, pious reflection was not the least among his many
                  miscellaneous accomplishments.</p>
               <p>As to my grandmother, she busied herself in comforting the hearts of Aunt Nancy
                  and the children with more than they could eat of the relics of the Thanksgiving
                  feast, and bidding them not to be down-hearted nor afeard of anything, for the
                  neighbors would all stand up for them, confirming her words with well-known
                  quotations from the Old Testament, to the effect that "the triumphing of the
                  wicked is short," and that "evil-doers shall soon be cut off from the earth."</p>
               <p>This incident gave Ellery Davenport a wide-spread popularity in the circles of
                  Oldtown. My grandmother was predisposed to look on him with complacency as a
                  grandson of President Edwards, although he took, apparently, a freakish delight in
                  shocking the respectable prejudices, and disappointing the reasonable
                  expectations, of people in this regard, by assuming in every conversation
                  precisely the sentiments that could have been least expected of him in view of
                  such a paternity.</p>
               <p>In fact, Ellery Davenport was one of those talkers who delight to maintain the
                  contrary of every proposition started, and who enjoy the bustle and confusion
                  which they thus make in every circle.</p>
               <p>In good, earnest, intense New England, where every idea was taken up and sifted
                  with serious solemnity, and investigated with a view to an immediate practical
                  action upon it as true or false, this glittering, fanciful system of fencing which
                  he kept up on all subjects, maintaining with equal brilliancy and ingenuity this
                  today and that to-morrow, might possibly have drawn down upon a man a certain
                  horror, as a professed scoffer and a bitter enemy of all that is good; but Ellery
                  Davenport, with all his apparent carelessness, understood himself and the world he
                  moved in perfectly. He never lost sight of the effect he was producing on any
                  mind, and had an intuitive judgment, in every situation, of exactly how far he
                  might go without going too far.</p>
               <p>The position of such young men as Ellery Davenport, in the theocratic state of
                  society in New England at this time, can be understood only by considering the
                  theologic movements of their period.</p>
               <p>The colonists who founded Massachusetts were men whose doctrine of a Christian
                  church in regard to the position of its children was essentially the same as that
                  of the Church of England. Thus we find in Doctor Cotton Mather this
                  statement:—</p>
               <p>"They did all agree with their brethren at Plymouth in this point: that the
                  children of the faithful were church-members with their parents; and that their
                  baptism was a seal of their being so; only, before their admission to fellowship
                  in any particular church, it was judged necessary that, being free from scandal in
                  life, they should be examined by the elders of the church, upon whose approbation
                  of their fitness they should publicly and personally own the covenant, and so be
                  received unto the table of the Lord. And accordingly the eldest son of Mr.
                  Higginson, being about fifteen years of age, and laudably answering all the
                  characters expected in a communicant, was then so received."</p>
               <p>The colony under Governor Winthrop and Thomas Dudley was, in fact, composed of men
                  in all but political opinion warmly attached to the Church of England; and they
                  published, on their departure, a tract called "The Humble Request of His Majesty's
                  Loyal Subjects, the Governor and Company lately gone for New England, for the
                  Obtaining of their Prayers, and the Removal of Suspicions and Misconstruction of
                  their Intentions"; and in this address they called the Church of England their
                  dear mother, acknowledging that such hope and part as they had attained in the
                  common salvation, they had sucked from her breasts; and entreating their many
                  reverend fathers and brethren to recommend them unto the mercies of God, in their
                  constant prayers, as a church now springing out of their own bowels. Originally,
                  therefore, the first young people who grew up in New England were taught in their
                  earliest childhood to regard themselves as already members of the church, as under
                  obligations to comport themselves accordingly, and at a very early age it was
                  expected of them that they would come forward by<pb n="362-363"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000186"/> their own act and confirm the action of their
                  parents in their baptism, in a manner much the same in general effect as
                  confirmation in England. The immediate result of this was much sympathy on the
                  part of the children and young people with the religious views of their parents,
                  and a sort of growing up into them from generation to generation. But, as the
                  world is always tending to become unspiritual and mechanical in its views and
                  sentiments, the defect of the species of religion thus engendered was a want of
                  that vitality and warmth of emotion which attend the convert whose mind has come
                  out of darkness into marvellous light,—who has passed through interior conflicts
                  which have agitated his soul to the very depths. So there was always a party in
                  New England who maintained that only those who could relate a change so marked as
                  to be characterized as supernatural should hope that they were the true elect of
                  God, or be received in churches and acknowledged as true Christians.</p>
               <p>Many pages of Cotton Mather record the earnest attention which not only the
                  ministers, but the governors and magistrates, of New England, in her early days,
                  gave to the question, "What is the true position of the baptized children of the
                  Church?" and Cotton Mather, who was warmly in favor of the Church of England
                  platform in this respect, says: "It was the study of those prudent men who might
                  be called our seers, that the children of the faithful should be kept, as far as
                  may be, under a church watch, in expectation that they might be in a fairer way to
                  receive the grace of God; so that the prosperous condition of religion in our
                  churches might not be a matter of one age alone."</p>
               <p>Old Cotton waxes warm in arguing this subject, as follows:—</p>
               <p>"The Scriptures tell us that men's denying the children of the Church to have any
                  part in the Lord hath a strong tendency in it to make them cease from fearing the
                  Lord, and harden their hearts from his fear. But the awful obligations of covenant
                  interest have a great tendency to soften the heart and break it, and draw it home
                  to God. Hence, when the Lord would powerfully win men to obedience, he often
                  begins with this: that he is their God. The way of the Anabaptists, to admit none
                  unto membership and baptism but adult professors, is the straitest way. One would
                  think it should be a way of great purity, but experience hath shown that it has
                  been an inlet unto great corruption, and a troublesome, dangerous underminer of
                  reformation."</p>
               <p>And then old Cotton adds these words, certainly as explicit as even the modern
                  Puseyite could desire:—</p>
               <p>"If we do not keep in the way of a converting, grace-giving <emph>covenant,</emph>
                  and keep persons <emph>under those church dispensations wherein grace is
                     given,</emph> the Church will die of a lingering, though not a violent death.
                  The Lord hath not set up churches, only that a few old Christians may keep one
                  another warm while they live and then carry away the Church into the cold grave
                  with them when they die. No; but that they might with all care and with all the
                  obligations and advantages to that care that may be, nurse up another generation
                  of subjects to our Lord, that may stand up in his kingdom when they are gone."</p>
               <p>It was for some time doubtful whether the New England Church would organize itself
                  and seek its own perpetuation on the educational basis which has been the
                  foundation of the majority of the Christian Church elsewhere; and the question was
                  decided, as such society questions often are, by the vigor and power of one man.
                  Jonathan Edwards, a man who united in himself the natures of both a poet and a
                  metaphysician, all whose experiences and feelings were as much more intense than
                  those of common men as Dante's or Milton's, fell into the error of making his own
                  constitutional religious experience the measure and standard of all others, and
                  revolutionizing by it the institutions of the Pilgrim Fathers.</p>
               <p>Regeneration, as he taught it in his "Treatise on the Affections," was the
                  implantation by Divine power of a new spiritual sense in the soul, as diverse from
                  all the other senses as seeing is from hearing, or tasting from smelling. No one
                  that had not received this new, divine, supernatural sense, could properly belong
                  to the Church of Christ, and all men, until they did receive it, were naturally
                  and constitutionally enemies of God to such a degree, that, as he says in a sermon
                  to that effect, "If they had God in their power, they would kill him."</p>
               <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7953-00000187"/>
               <p>It was his power and his influence which succeeded in completely upsetting New
                  England from the basis on which the Reformers and the Puritan Fathers had placed
                  her, and casting out of the Church the children of the very saints and martyrs who
                  had come to this country for no other reason than to found a church.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable that, in all the discussions of depravity inherited from Adam, it
                  never seemed to occur to any theologian that there might also be a counter-working
                  of the great law of descent, by which the feelings and habits of thought wrought
                  in the human mind by Jesus Christ might descend through generations of Christians,
                  so that, in course of time, many might be born predisposed to good, rather than to
                  evil. Cotton Mather fearlessly says that "<emph>the seed of the Church are born
                     holy,</emph>"—not, of course, meaning it in a strictly theological sense, but
                  certainly indicating that, in his day, a mild and genial spirit of hope breathed
                  over the cradle of infancy and childhood.</p>
               <p>Those very persons whom President Edwards addresses in such merciless terms of
                  denunciation in his sermons, telling them that it is a wonder the sun does not
                  refuse to shine upon them,—that the earth daily groans to open under them,—and
                  that the wind and the sun and the waters are all weary of them and longing to
                  break forth and execute the wrath of God upon them,—were the children for
                  uncounted generations back of fathers and mothers nursed in the bosom of the
                  Church, trained in habits of daily prayer, brought up to patience and
                  self-sacrifice and self-denial as the very bread of their daily being, and lacking
                  only this supernatural sixth sense, the want of which brought upon them a guilt so
                  tremendous. The consequence was, that, immediately after the time of President
                  Edwards, there grew up in the very bosom of the New England Church a set of young
                  people who were not merely indifferent to religion, but who hated it with the
                  whole energy of their being.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport's feeling toward the Church and religion had all the bitterness
                  of the disinherited son, who likes nothing better than to point out the faults in
                  those favored children who enjoy the privileges of which he is deprived. All the
                  consequences that good, motherly Cotton Mather had foreseen as likely to result
                  from the proposed system of arranging the Church were strikingly verified in his
                  case. He had not been able entirely to rid himself of a belief in what he hated.
                  The danger of all such violent recoils from the religion of one's childhood
                  consists in this fact,—that the person is always secretly uncertain that he may
                  not be opposing truth and virtue itself; he struggles confusedly with the faith of
                  his mother, the prayers of his father, with whatever there may be holy and noble
                  in the profession of that faith from which he has broken away; and few escape a
                  very serious shock to conscience and their moral nature in doing it.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport was at war with himself, at war with the traditions of his
                  ancestry, and had the feeling that he was regarded in the Puritan community as an
                  apostate; but he took a perverse pleasure in making his position good by a
                  brilliancy of wit and grace of manner which few could resist; and, truth to say,
                  his success, even with the more rigid, justified his self-confidence. As during
                  these days there were very few young persons who made any profession of religion
                  at all, the latitude of expression which he allowed himself on these subjects was
                  looked upon as a sort of spiritual sowing of wild oats. Heads would be gravely
                  shaken over him. One and another would say, "Ah! that Edwards blood is smart; it
                  runs pretty wild in youth, but the Lord's time may come by and by"; and I doubt
                  not that my grandmother that very night, before she slept, wrestled with God in
                  prayer for his soul with all the enthusiasm of a Monica for a St. Augustine.</p>
               <p>Meantime, with that easy facility which enabled him to please everybody, he
                  became, during the course of a somewhat extended visit which he made at the
                  minister's, rather a hero in Oldtown. What Colonel Davenport said, and what
                  Colonel Davenport did, were spoken of from mouth to mouth. Even his wicked wit was
                  repeated by the gravest and most pious,—of course with some expressions of
                  disclaimer, but, after all, with that genuine pleasure which a Yankee never fails

               <p>He cultivated a great friendship with Miss Mehitable,—talking with her of books
                  and literature and foreign countries, and advising her in regard to the education
                  of Tina, with great unction and gravity. With that little princess there was
                  always a sort of half whimsical flirtation, as she demurely insisted on being
                  treated by him as a woman, rather than as a child,—a caprice which amused him
                  greatly.</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable felt herself irresistibly drawn, in his society, as almost
                  everybody else was, to make a confidant of him. He was so winning, so obliging, so
                  gentle, and knew so well just where and how to turn the conversation to avoid
                  anything that he did n't like to hear, and to hear anything that he did. So gently
                  did his fingers run over the gamut of everybody's nature, that nobody dreamed of
                  being played on.</p>
               <p>Such men are not, of course, villains; but, if they ever should happen to wish to
                  become so, their nature gives them every facility.</p>
               <p>Before she knew what she was about, Miss Mehitable found herself talking with
                  Ellery Davenport on the strange, mysterious sorrow which imbittered her life, and
                  she found a most sympathetic and respectful listener.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport was already versed in diplomatic life, and had held for a year or
                  two a situation of importance at the court of France; was soon to return thither,
                  and also to be employed on diplomatic service in England. Could he, would he, find
                  any traces of the lost one there? On this subject there were long, and, on the
                  part of Miss Mehitable, agitating interviews, which much excited Miss Tina's
                  curiosity.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">MY GRANDMOTHER'S BLUE BOOK.</head>
               <p>READER, this is to be a serious chapter, and I advise all those people who want to
                  go through the world without giving five minutes' consecutive thought to any
                  subject to skip it. They will not find it entertaining, and it may perhaps lead
                  them to think on puzzling subjects, even for so long a time as half an hour; and
                  who knows what may happen to their brains, from so unusual an exercise?</p>
               <p>My grandmother, as I have shown, was a character in her way, full of
                  contradictions and inconsistencies, brave, generous, energetic, large-hearted, and
                  impulsive. Theoretically she was an ardent disciple of the sharpest and severest
                  Calvinism, and used to repeat Michael Wigglesworth's "Day of Doom" to us in the
                  chimney-corner, of an evening, with a reverent acquiescence in all its hard
                  sayings, while practically she was the most pitiful, easy-to-be-entreated old
                  mortal on earth, and was ever falling a prey to any lazy vagabond who chose to
                  make an appeal to her abounding charity. She could not refuse a beggar that asked
                  in a piteous tone; she could not send a child to bed that wanted to sit up; she
                  could not eat a meal in peace when there were hungry eyes watching her; she could
                  not, in cool, deliberate moments, even inflict transient and necessary pain for
                  the greater good of a child, and resolutely shut her eyes to the necessity of such
                  infliction. But there lay at the bottom of all this apparent inconsistency a deep
                  cause that made it consistent, and that cause was the theologic stratum in which
                  her mind, and the mind of all New England, was embedded.</p>
               <p>Never, in the most intensely religious ages of the world, did the insoluble
                  problem of the WHENCE, the WHY, and the WHITHER of mankind receive such earnest
                  attention. New England was founded by a colony who turned their backs on the<pb
                     n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7953-00000189"/> civilization of the Old World, on
                  purpose that they might have nothing else to think of. Their object was to form a
                  community that should think of nothing else.</p>
               <p>Working on a hard soil, battling with a harsh, ungenial climate, everywhere being
                  treated by Nature with the most rigorous severity, they asked no indulgence, they
                  got none, and they gave none. They shut out from their religious worship every
                  poetic drapery, every physical accessory that they feared would interfere with the
                  abstract contemplation of hard, naked truth, and set themselves grimly and
                  determinately to study the severest problems of the unknowable and the insoluble.
                  Just as resolutely as they made their farms by blasting rocks and clearing land of
                  ledges of stone, and founded thrifty cities and thriving money-getting communities
                  in places which one would think might more properly have been left to the white
                  bears, so resolutely they pursued their investigations amid the grim mysteries of
                  human existence, determined to see and touch and handle everything for themselves,
                  and to get at the absolute truth if absolute truth could be got at.</p>
               <p>They never expected to find truth agreeable. Nothing in their experience of life
                  had ever prepared them to think it would be so. Their investigations were made
                  with the courage of the man who hopes little, but determines to know the worst of
                  his affairs. They wanted no smoke of incense to blind them, and no soft opiates of
                  pictures and music to lull them; for what they were after was <emph>truth,</emph>
                  and not happiness, and they valued <emph>duty</emph> far higher than
                  enjoyment.</p>
               <p>The underlying foundation of life, therefore, in New England, was one of profound,
                  unutterable, and therefore unuttered, melancholy, which regarded human existence
                  itself as a ghastly risk, and, in the case of the vast majority of human beings,
                  an inconceivable misfortune.</p>
               <p>My grandmother believed in statements which made the fortunate number who escaped
                  the great catastrophe of mortal life as few and far between as the shivering,
                  half-drowned mariners, who crawl up on to the shores of some desert island, when
                  all else on board have perished. In this view she regarded the birth of an infant
                  with a suppressed groan, and the death of one almost with satisfaction. That more
                  than half the human race die in infancy,—that infanticide is the general custom in
                  so many heathen lands,—was to her a comforting consideration, for so many were
                  held to escape at once the awful ordeal, and to be gathered into the numbers of
                  the elect.</p>
               <p>As I have said, she was a great reader. On the round table that stood in her
                  bedroom, next to the kitchen, there was an ample supply of books. Rollin's Ancient
                  History, Hume's History of England, and President Edwards's Sermons, were among
                  these.</p>
               <p>She was not one of those systematic, skilful housewives who contrive with few
                  steps and great method to do much in little time; she took everything the hardest
                  end first, and attacked difficulties by sheer inconsiderate strength. For example,
                  instead of putting on the great family pot, filling it with water, and afterwards
                  putting therein the beef, pork, and vegetables of our daily meal, she would load
                  up the receptacle at the sink in the back room, and then, with strong arm and
                  cap-border erect, would fly across the kitchen with it and swing it over the fire
                  by main strength. Thus inconsiderately she rushed at the daily battle of
                  existence. But there was one point of system in which she never failed. There was,
                  every day, a period, sacred and inviolable, which she gave to reading. The noon
                  meal came exactly at twelve o'clock; and immediately after, when the dishes were
                  washed and wiped, and the kitchen reduced to order, my grandmother changed her
                  gown, and retired to the sanctuary of her bedroom to read. In this way she
                  accomplished an amount which a modern housekeeper, with four servants, would
                  pronounce to be wholly incredible.</p>
               <p>The books on her table came in time to be my reading as well as hers; for, as I
                  have said, reading was with me a passion, a hunger, and I read all that came in my
                  way.</p>
               <p>Her favorite books had different-colored covers, thriftily put on to preserve them
                  from the wear of handling; and it was by these covers they were generally
                  designated in the family. Hume's History of England was known as "the brown
                     book";<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7953-00000190"/> Rollin's History was "the
                  green book"; but there was one volume which she pondered oftener and with more
                  intense earnestness than any other, which received the designation of "the blue
                  book." This was a volume by the Rev. Dr. Bellamy of Connecticut, called "True
                  Religion delineated, and distinguished from all Counterfeits." It was originally
                  published by subscription, and sent out into New England with a letter of
                  introduction and recommendation from the Rev. Jonathan Edwards, who earnestly set
                  it forth as being a condensed summary, in popular language, of what it is vital
                  and important for human beings to know for their spiritual progress. It was
                  written in a strong, nervous, condensed, popular style, such as is fallen into by
                  a practical man speaking to a practical people, by a man thoroughly in earnest to
                  men as deeply in earnest, and lastly, by a man who believed without the shadow of
                  a doubt, and without even the comprehension of the possibility of a doubt.</p>
               <p>I cannot give a better idea of the unflinching manner in which the deepest
                  mysteries of religion were propounded to the common people than by giving a
                  specimen of some of the headings of this book.</p>
               <p>Page 288 considers, "Were we by the Fall brought into a State of Being worse than
                  Not to Be?"</p>
               <p>The answer to this comprehensive question is sufficiently explicit.</p>
               <p>"Mankind were by their fall brought into a state of being worse than not to be.
                  The damned in hell, no doubt, are in such a state, else their punishment would not
                  be infinite, as justice requires it should be. But mankind, by the fall, were
                  brought into a state, <emph>for substance,</emph> as bad as that which the damned
                  are in."</p>
               <p>The next inquiry to this is, "How could God, consistent with his perfections, put
                  us into a state of being worse than not to be? And how can we ever thank God for
                  such a being?"</p>
               <p>The answer to this, as it was read by thousands of reflecting minds like mine,
                  certainly shows that these hardy and courageous investigators often raised spirits
                  that they could not lay. As, for instance, this solution of the question, which
                  never struck me as satisfactory.</p>
               <p>"Inasmuch as God did virtually give being to all mankind, when he blessed our
                  first parents and said, 'Be fruitful and multiply'; and inasmuch as
                     <emph>Being,</emph> under the circumstances that man was <emph>then</emph> put
                  in by God, was very desirable: we ought, therefore, to thank God for our being,
                  considered in this light, and justify God for all the evil that has come upon us
                  by apostasy."</p>
               <p>On this subject the author goes on to moralize thus:—</p>
               <p>"Mankind, by the fall, were brought into a state of being infinitely worse than
                  not to be; and were they but so far awake as to be sensible of it, they would, no
                  doubt, all over the earth, murmur and blaspheme the God of Heaven. But what then?
                  there would be no just ground for such conduct. We have no reason to think hard of
                  God,—to blame him or esteem him e'er the less. What he has done was fit and right.
                  His conduct was beautiful, and he is worthy to be esteemed for it. For that
                  constitution was holy, just, and good, as has been proved. And, therefore, a
                  fallen world ought to ascribe to themselves all the evil, and to justify God and
                  say: 'God gave us being under a constitution holy, just, and good, and it was a
                  mercy. We should have accounted it a great mercy in case Adam had never fallen;
                  but God is not to blame for this, nor, therefore, is he the less worthy of
                  thanks.'"</p>
               <p>After this comes another and quite practical inquiry, which is stated as
                  follows:—</p>
               <p>"But if mankind are thus by nature children of wrath, in a state of being worse
                  than not to be, how can men have the heart to propagate their kind?"</p>
               <p>The answer to this inquiry it is not necessary to give at length. I merely state
                  it to show how unblinking was the gaze which men in those days fixed upon the
                  problems of life.</p>
               <p>The objector is still further represented as saying,—</p>
               <p>"It cannot be thought a blessing to have children, if most of them are thought to
                  be likely to perish."</p>
               <p>The answer to this is as follows:—</p>
               <p>"The most of Abraham's posterity for these three thousand years, no doubt, have
                  been wicked and perished. And God knew<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7953-00000191"/>
                  beforehand how it would be, and yet he promised such a numerous posterity under
                  the notion of a great blessing. For, considering children as to this life, they
                  may be a great blessing and comfort to their parents; and we are certain that God
                  will do them no wrong in the life to come. All men's murmuring thoughts about this
                  matter arise from their not liking God's way of governing the world."</p>
               <p>I will quote but one more passage, as showing the hardy vigor of assertion on the
                  darkest of subjects,—the origin of evil. The author says:—</p>
               <p>"When God first designed the world, and laid out his scheme of government, it was
                  easy for him to have determined that neither angels nor men should ever sin, and
                  that misery should never be heard of in all his dominions; for he could easily
                  have prevented both sin and misery. Why did not he? Surely not for want of
                  goodness in his nature, for that is infinite; not from anything like cruelty, for
                  there is no such thing in him; not for want of a suitable regard to the happiness
                  of his creatures, for that he always has: but because in his infinite wisdom he
                  did not think it best on the whole.</p>
               <p>"But why was it not best? What could he have in view, preferable to the happiness
                  of his creatures? And, if their happiness was to him above all things most dear,
                  how could he bear the thoughts of their ever any of them being miserable?</p>
               <p>"It is certain that he had in view something else than merely the happiness of his
                  creatures. It was something of greater importance. But what was that thing that
                  was of greater worth and importance, and to which he had the greatest regard,
                  making all other things give way to this? What was his great end in creating and
                  governing the world? Why, look what end he is at last likely to obtain, when the
                  whole scheme is finished, and the Day of Judgment passed, and heaven and hell
                  filled with all their proper inhabitants. What will be the final result? What will
                  he get by all? Why, this: that he will exert and display every one of his
                  perfections to the life, and so by all will exhibit a most perfect and exact image
                  of himself.</p>
               <p>"Now it is evident that the fall of angels and of man, together with all those
                  things which have and will come to pass in consequence thereof, from the beginning
                  of the world to the Day of Judgment and throughout eternity, will serve to give a
                  much more lively and perfect representation of God than could possibly have been
                  given had there been no sin or misery."</p>
               <p>This book also led the inquirer through all the mazes of mental philosophy, and
                  discussed all the problems of mystical religion, such as,—</p>
               <p>"Can a man, merely from self-love, love God more than himself?"</p>
               <p>"Is our impotency only moral?"</p>
               <p>"What is the most fundamental difference between Arminians and Calvinists?"</p>
               <p>"How the love to our neighbor which is commanded by God is a thing different from
                  natural compassion, from natural affection, from party-spirited love, from any
                  love whatever that arises merely from self-love, and from the love which
                  enthusiasts and heretics have for one another."</p>
               <p>I give these specimens, that the reader may reflect what kind of population there
                  was likely to be where such were the daily studies of a plain country farmer's
                  wife, and such the common topics discussed at every kitchen fireside.</p>
               <p>My grandmother's blue book was published and recommended to the attention of New
                  England, August 4, 1750, just twenty-six years before the Declaration of
                  Independence. How popular it was, and how widely read in New England, appears from
                  the list of subscribers which stands at the end of the old copy which my
                  grandmother actually used. Almost every good old Massachusetts or Connecticut
                  family name is there represented. We have the Emersons, the Adamses, the Brattles
                  of Brattle Street, the Bromfields of Bromfield Street, the Brinsmaids of
                  Connecticut, the Butlers, the Campbells, the Chapmans, the Cottons, the Daggetts,
                  the Hawleys, the Hookers, with many more names of families yet continuing to hold
                  influence in New England. How they regarded this book may be inferred from the
                  fact that some subscribed for six books, some for twelve, some for thirty-six, and
                  some for fifty. Its dissemination was deemed an<pb n="374-375"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000192"/> act of religious ministry, and there is not the
                  slightest doubt that it was heedfully and earnestly read in every good family of
                  New England; and its propositions were discussed everywhere and by everybody. This
                  is one undoubted fact; the other is, that it was this generation who fought
                  through the Revolutionary war. They were a set of men and women brought up to
                     <emph>think,</emph>—to think not merely on agreeable subjects, but to wrestle
                  and tug at the very severest problems. Utter self-renunciation, a sort of grand
                  contempt for personal happiness when weighed with things greater and more
                  valuable, was the fundamental principle of life in those days. They who could
                  calmly look in the face, and settle themselves down to, the idea of being resigned
                  and thankful for an existence which was not so good as non-existence,—who were
                  willing to be loyal subjects of a splendid and powerful government which was
                  conducted on quite other issues than a regard for their happiness,—were possessed
                  of a courage and a fortitude which no mere earthly mischance could shake. They who
                  had faced eternal ruin with an unflinching gaze were not likely to shrink before
                  the comparatively trivial losses and gains of any mere earthly conflict. Being
                  accustomed to combats with the Devil, it was rather a recreation to fight only
                  British officers.</p>
               <p>If any should ever be so curious as to read this old treatise, as well as most of
                  the writings of Jonathan Edwards, they will perceive with singular plainness how
                  inevitably monarchical and aristocratic institutions influence theology.</p>
               <p>That "the king can do no wrong,"—that the subject owes everything to the king, and
                  the king nothing to the subject,—that it is the king's first duty to take care of
                  himself, and keep up state, splendor, majesty, and royalty, and that it is the
                  people's duty to give themselves up, body and soul, without a murmuring thought,
                  to keep up this state, splendor, and royalty,—were ideas for ages so wrought into
                  the human mind, and transmitted by ordinary generation,—they so reflected
                  themselves in literature and poetry and art, and all the great customs of
                  society,—that it was inevitable that systematic theology should be permeated by
                  them.</p>
               <p>The idea of God in which theologians delighted, and which the popular mind
                  accepted, was not that of the Good Shepherd that giveth his life for the sheep,—of
                  him that made himself of no reputation, and took unto himself the form of a
                  servant,—of him who on his knees washed the feet of his disciples, and said that
                  in the kingdom of heaven the greatest was he who served most humbly,—this aspect
                  of a Divine Being had not yet been wrought into their systematic theology;
                  because, while the Bible comes from God, theology is the outgrowth of the human
                  mind, and therefore must spring from the movement of society.</p>
               <p>When the Puritans arrived at a perception of the political rights of men in the
                  state, and began to enunciate and act upon the doctrine that a king's right to
                  reign was founded upon his power to promote the greatest happiness of his
                  subjects, and when, in pursuance of this theory, they tried, condemned, and
                  executed a king who had been false to the people, they took a long step forward in
                  human progress. Why did not immediate anarchy follow, as when the French took such
                  a step in regard to their king? It was because the Puritans transferred to God all
                  those rights and immunities, all that unquestioning homage and worship and
                  loyalty, which hitherto they had given to an earthly king.</p>
               <p>The human mind cannot bear to relinquish more than a certain portion of its
                  cherished past ideas in one century. Society falls into anarchy in too entire a
                  change of base.</p>
               <p>The Puritans had still a King. The French Revolutionists had nothing; therefore,
                  the Puritan Revolution went on stronger and stronger. The French passed through
                  anarchy back under despotism.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of Divine sovereignty was the great rest to the human mind in those
                  days, when the foundations of many generations were broken up. It is always
                  painful to honest and loyal minds to break away from that which they have
                  reverenced,—to put down that which they have respected. And the Puritans were by
                  nature the most reverential and most loyal portion of the community. Their
                  passionate attachment to the doctrine of Divine sovereignty, at this period, was
                  the pleading<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7953-00000193"/> and yearning within them
                  of a faculty robbed of its appropriate object, and longing for support and
                  expression.</p>
               <p>There is something most affecting in the submissive devotion of these old Puritans
                  to their God. Nothing shows more completely the indestructible nature of the
                  filial tie which binds man to God, of the filial yearning which throbs in the
                  heart of a great child of so great a Father, than the manner in which these men
                  loved and worshipped and trusted God as the ALL LOVELY, even in the face of
                  monstrous assertions of theology ascribing to him deeds which no father could
                  imitate without being cast out of human society, and no governor without being
                  handed down to all ages as a monster.</p>
               <p>These theologies were not formed by the Puritans; they were their legacy from past
                  monarchical and mediæval ages; and the principles of true Christian democracy upon
                  which they founded their new state began, from the time of the American
                  Revolution, to act upon them with a constantly ameliorating power; so that
                  whosoever should read my grandmother's blue book now would be astonished to find
                  how completely New England theology has changed its base.</p>
               <p>The artist, in reproducing pictures of New England life during this period, is
                  often obliged to hold his hand. He could not faithfully report the familiar
                  conversations of the common people, because they often allude to and discuss the
                  most awful and tremendous subjects. This, however, was the inevitable result of
                  the honest, fearless manner in which the New England ministry of this second era
                  discussed the Divine administration. They argued for it with the common people in
                  very much the tone and with much the language in which they defended the
                  Continental Congress and the ruling President; and every human being was addressed
                  as a competent judge.</p>
               <p>The result of such a mode of proceeding, in the long run, changed the theology of
                  New England, from what it was when Jonathan Edwards recommended my grandmother's
                  blue book, into what it is at this present writing. But, during the process of
                  this investigation, every child born in New England found himself beaten backwards
                  and forwards, like a shuttlecock, between the battledoors of discussion. Our
                  kitchen used to be shaken constantly by what my grandfather significantly called
                  "the battle of the Infinites," especially when my Uncle Bill came home from
                  Cambridge on his vacations, fully charged with syllogisms, which he hurled like
                  catapults back on the syllogisms which my grandmother had drawn from the armory of
                  her blue book.</p>
               <p>My grandmother would say, for example: "Whatever sin is committed against an
                  infinite being is an infinite evil. Every infinite evil deserves infinite
                  punishment; therefore every sin of man deserves an infinite punishment."</p>
               <p>Then Uncle Bill, on the other side, would say: "No act of a finite being can be
                  infinite. Man is a finite being; therefore no sin of man can be infinite. No
                  finite evil deserves infinite punishment. Man's sins are finite evils; therefore
                  man's sins do not deserve infinite punishment." When the combatants had got thus
                  far, they generally looked at each other in silence.</p>
               <p>As a result, my grandmother being earnest and prayerful, and my uncle careless and
                  worldly, the thing generally ended in her believing that he was wrong, though she
                  could not answer him; and in his believing that she, after all, might be right,
                  though he <emph>could</emph> answer her; for it is noticeable, in every battle of
                  opinion, that honest, sincere, moral earnestness has a certain advantage over mere
                  intellectual cleverness.</p>
               <p>It was inevitable that a people who had just carried through a national revolution
                  and declared national independence on the principle that "governments owe their
                  just power to the consent of the governed," and who recognized it as an axiom that
                  the greatest good to the greatest number was the object to be held in view in all
                  just governments, should very soon come into painful collision with forms of
                  theological statement, in regard to God's government, which appeared to contravene
                  all these principles, and which could be supported only by referring to the old
                  notion of the divine right and prerogative of the King Eternal.</p>
               <p>President Edwards had constructed a marvellous piece of logic to show that, while
                  true virtue in man consisted in supreme devotion to the general good of all, true
                  virtue in God<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7953-00000194"/> consisted in supreme
                  regard for himself. This "Treatise on True Virtue" was one of the strongest
                  attempts to back up by reasoning the old monarchical and aristocratic ideas of the
                  supreme right of the king and upper classes. The whole of it falls to dust before
                  the one simple declaration of Jesus Christ, that, in the eyes of Heaven, one lost
                  sheep is more prized than all the ninety and nine that went not astray, and before
                  the parable in which the father runs, forgetful of parental prerogative and
                  dignity, to cast himself on the neck of the far-off prodigal.</p>
               <p>Theology being human and a reflection of human infirmities, nothing is more common
                  than for it to come up point-blank in opposition to the simplest declarations of
                  Christ.</p>
               <p>I must beg my readers' pardon for all this, but it is a fact that the true tragedy
                  of New England life, its deep, unutterable pathos, its endurances and its
                  sufferings, all depended upon, and were woven into, this constant wrestling of
                  thought with infinite problems which could not be avoided, and which saddened the
                  days of almost every one who grew up under it.</p>
               <p>Was this entire freedom of thought and discussion a bad thing, then? Do we not see
                  that strength of mind and strength of will, and the courage and fortitude and
                  endurance which founded this great American government, grew up out of characters
                  formed thus to think and struggle and suffer? It seems to be the law of this
                  present existence, that all the changes by which the world is made better are
                  brought about by the struggle and suffering, and sometimes the utter shipwreck, of
                  individual human beings.</p>
               <p>In regard to our own family, the deepest tragedy in it, and the one which for a
                  time brought the most suffering and sorrow on us all, cannot be explained unless
                  we take into consideration this peculiar state of society.</p>
               <p>In the neighboring town of Adams there lived one of the most remarkable clergymen
                  that New England has ever produced. His career influenced the thinking of
                  Massachusetts, both in regard to those who adopted his opinions, and in the
                  violent reaction from those opinions which was the result of his extreme manner of
                  pushing them.</p>
               <p>Dr. Moses Stern's figure is well remembered by me as I saw it in my boyhood.
                  Everybody knew him, and when he appeared in the pulpit everybody trembled before
                  him. He moved among men, but seemed not of men. An austere, inflexible, grand
                  indifference to all things earthly seemed to give him the prestige and dignity of
                  a supernatural being. His Calvinism was of so severe and ultra a type, and his
                  statements were so little qualified either by pity of human infirmity, or fear of
                  human censure, or desire of human approbation, that he reminded one of some
                  ancient prophet, freighted with a mission of woe and wrath, which he must always
                  speak, whether people would hear or whether they would forbear.</p>
               <p>The Revolutionary war had introduced into the country a great deal of scepticism,
                  of a type of which Paine's "Age of Reason" was an exponent; and, to meet this, the
                  ministry of New England was not slow or unskilful.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stern's mode of meeting this attitude of the popular mind was by an
                  unflinching, authoritative, vehement reiteration of all the most unpopular and
                  unpleasant points of Calvinism. Now as Nature is, in many of her obvious aspects,
                  notoriously uncompromising, harsh, and severe, the Calvinist who begins to talk to
                  common-sense people has this advantage on his side,—that the things which he
                  represents the Author of Nature as doing and being ready to do, are not very
                  different from what the common-sense man sees that the Author of Nature is already
                  in the habit of doing.</p>
               <p>The farmer who struggles with the hard soil, and with drouth and frost and
                  caterpillars and fifty other insect plagues,—who finds his most persistent and
                  well-calculated efforts constantly thwarted by laws whose workings he never can
                  fully anticipate, and which never manifest either care for his good intentions or
                  sympathy for his losses, is very apt to believe that the God who created nature
                  may be a generally benevolent, but a severe and unsympathetic being, governing the
                  world for some great, unknown purpose of his own, of which man's private
                  improvement and happiness may or may not form a part.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stern, with characteristic independence and fearlessness,<pb n="380-381"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000195"/> on his own simple authority cut loose from and
                  repudiated the whole traditional idea of the fall in Adam as having anything to do
                  with the existence of human depravity; and made up his own theory of the universe,
                  and began preaching it to the farmers of Adams. It was simply this: that the
                  Divine Being is the efficient cause of all things, not only in matter but in
                  mind,—that every good and every evil volition of any being in the universe is
                  immediately caused by Him and tends equally well in its way to carry on his great
                  designs. But, in order that this might not interfere with the doctrines of human
                  responsibility, he taught that all was accomplished by Omniscient skill and
                  knowledge in such a way as not in the slightest degree to interfere with human
                  free agency; so that the whole responsibility of every human being's actions must
                  rest upon himself.</p>
               <p>Thus was this system calculated, like a skilful engine of torture, to produce all
                  the mental anguish of the most perfect sense of helplessness with the most
                  torturing sense of responsibility. Alternately he worked these two great levers
                  with an almost supernatural power,—on one Sunday demonstrating with the most
                  logical clearness, and by appeals to human consciousness, the perfect freedom of
                  man, and, on the next, demonstrating with no less precision and logic the perfect
                  power which an Omniscient Being possessed and exercised of controlling all his
                  thoughts and volitions and actions.</p>
               <p>Individually, Dr. Stern, like many other teachers of severe, uncompromising
                  theories, was an artless, simple-hearted, gentle-mannered man. He was a close
                  student, and wore two holes in the floor opposite his table in the spot where year
                  after year his feet were placed in study. He refused to have the smallest thing to
                  do with any temporal affair of this life. Like the other clergymen, he lived on a
                  small salary, and the support of his family depended largely on the proceeds of a
                  farm. But it is recorded of him, that once, when his whole summer's crop of hay
                  was threatened with the bursting of a thunder-shower, and, farmhands being short,
                  he was importuned to lend a hand to save it, he resolutely declined, saying, that,
                  if he once began to allow himself to be called on in any emergency for temporal
                  affairs, he should become forgetful of his great mission.</p>
               <p>The same inflexible, unbending perseverance he showed in preaching, on the basis
                  of his own terrible theory, the most fearful doctrines of Calvinism. His sermons
                  on Judas, on Jeroboam, and on Pharaoh, as practical examples of the doctrine of
                  reprobation, were pieces of literature so startling and astounding, that, even in
                  those days of interrupted travel, when there were neither railroads nor good roads
                  of any kind, and almost none of our modern communicative system of magazines and
                  newspapers, they were heard of all over New England. So great was the revulsion
                  which his doctrines excited, that, when he exchanged with his brother ministers,
                  his appearance in the pulpit was the signal for some of the most independent of
                  the congregation to get up and leave the meeting-house. But, as it was one of his
                  maxims that the minister who does not excite the opposition of the natural heart
                  fails to do his work, he regarded such demonstrations as evident signs of a
                  faithful ministry.</p>
               <p>The science of Biblical criticism in his day was in its infancy; the Bible was
                  mostly read by ministers, and proof-texts quoted from it as if it had been a
                  treatise written in the English language by New-Englanders, and in which every
                  word must bear the exact sense of a New England metaphysical treatise. And thus
                  interpreting the whole wide labyrinth of poetry and history, and Oriental allegory
                  and hyperbole, by literal rules, Dr. Stern found no difficulty in making it clear
                  to those who heard him that there was no choice between believing his hard
                  doctrines and giving up the Bible altogether. And it shows the deep and rooted
                  attachment which the human heart has for that motherly book, that even in this
                  dreadful dilemma the majority of his hearers did not revolt from the Bible.</p>
               <p>As it was, in the town where he lived his preaching formed the strongest, most
                  controlling of all forces. No human being could hear his sermons unmoved. He would
                  not preach to an inattentive audience, and on one occasion, observing a large
                  number of his congregation asleep, he abruptly descended from the pulpit and
                  calmly walked off home, leaving the astonished congregation to their own
                  reflections; nor would he resume<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7953-00000196"/> public
                  services until messages of contrition and assurances of better conduct had been
                  sent him.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stern was in his position irresistible, simply because he cared nothing at all
                  for the things which men ordinarily care for, and which therefore could be used as
                  motives to restrain the declarations and actions of a clergyman. He cared nothing
                  about worldly prosperity; he was totally indifferent to money; he utterly despised
                  fame and reputation; and therefore from none of these sources could he be in the
                  slightest degree influenced. Such a man is generally the king of his
                  neighborhood,—the one whom all look up to, and all fear, and whose word in time
                  becomes law.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stern never sought to put himself forward otherwise than by the steady
                  preaching of his system to the farming population of Adams. And yet, so great were
                  his influence and his fame, that in time it became customary for young theological
                  students to come and settle themselves down there as his students. This was done
                  at first without his desire, and contrary to his remonstrance.</p>
               <p>"I can't engage to teach you," he said; but still, when scholars came and
                  continued to come, he found himself, without seeking it, actually at the head of a
                  school of theology.</p>
               <p>Let justice be done to all; it is due to truth to state that the theological
                  scholars of Dr. Stern, wherever they went in the United States, were always marked
                  men,—marked for an unflinching adherence to principle, and especially for a great
                  power in supporting unpopular truths.</p>
               <p>The Doctor himself lived to an extreme old age, always retaining and reiterating
                  with unflinching constancy his opinions. He was the last of the New England
                  ministers who preserved the old clerical dress of the theocracy. Long after the
                  cocked hat and small-clothes, silk stockings and shoe-buckles, had ceased to
                  appear in modern life, his venerable figure, thus apparelled, walked the ways of
                  modern men, seeming like one of the primitive Puritans risen from the dead.</p>
               <p>He was the last, also, of the New England ministers to claim for himself that
                  peculiar position, as God's ambassador dor, which was such a reality in the minds
                  of the whole early Puritan community. To extreme old age, his word was law in his
                  parish, and he calmly and positively felt that it should be so. In time, his gray
                  hairs, his fine, antique figure and quaint costume came to be regarded with the
                  sort of appreciative veneration that every one gives to the monuments of the past.
                  When he was near his ninetieth year, he was invited to New York to give the
                  prestige of his venerable presence to the religious anniversaries which then were
                  in the flush of newly organized enthusiasm, and which gladly laid hold of this
                  striking accessory to the religious picturesque.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stern was invited and fêted in the most select upper circles of New York, and
                  treated with attentions which would have been flattering had he not been too
                  entirely simple-minded and careless of such matters even to perceive what they
                  meant.</p>
               <p>But at this same time the Abolitionists, who were regarded as most improper people
                  to be recognized in the religious circles of good society, came to New York,
                  resolving to have their anniversary also; and, knowing that Dr. Stern had always
                  professed to be an antislavery man, they invited him to sit on the stage with
                  them; and Dr. Stern went. Shocking to relate, and dreadful to behold, this very
                  cocked hat and these picturesque gray hairs, that had been brought to New York on
                  purpose to ornament religious anniversaries which were all agreed in excluding and
                  ignoring the Abolitionists, had gone right over into the camp of the enemy! and he
                  was so entirely ignorant and uninstructible on the subject, and came back, after
                  having committed this abomination, with a face of such innocent and serene
                  gravity, that nobody dared to say a word to him on the subject.</p>
               <p>He was at this time the accepted guest in a family whose very religion consisted
                  in a gracious carefulness and tenderness lest they should wake up the feelings of
                  their Southern brethren on the delicate subject of slavery. But then Dr. Stern was
                  a man that it did no good to talk to, since it was well known that, wherever there
                  was an unpopular truth to be defended, his cocked hat was sure to be in the front
                  ranks.</p>
               <p>Let us do one more justice to Dr. Stern, and say that his<pb n="384-385"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000197"/> utter inflexibility toward human infirmity and
                  human feeling spared himself as little as it spared any other. In his early life
                  he records, in a most affecting autobiography, the stroke which deprived him,
                  within a very short space, of a beloved wife and two charming children. In the
                  struggle of that hour he says, with affecting simplicity, "I felt that I should
                  die if I did not submit; and I did submit then, once for all." Thenceforward the
                  beginning and middle and end of his whole preaching was
                  <emph>submission,</emph>—utter, absolute, and unconditional.</p>
               <p>In extreme old age, trembling on the verge of the grave, and looking back over
                  sixty years of intense labor, he said, "After all, it is quite possible that
                     <emph>I</emph> may not be saved"; but he considered himself as but one drop in
                  the ocean, and his personal salvation as of but secondary account. His devotion to
                  the King Eternal had no reference to a matter so slight. In all this, if there is
                  something terrible and painful, there is something also which is grand, and in
                  which we can take pride, as the fruit of our human nature. Peace to his ashes! he
                  has learned better things ere now.</p>
               <p>If my readers would properly understand the real depth of sorrowful perplexity in
                  which our friend Miss Mehitable Rossiter was struggling, they must go back with us
                  some years before, to the time when little Emily Rossiter was given up to the
                  guardianship and entire control of her Aunt Farnsworth.</p>
               <p>Zedekiah Farnsworth was one of those men who embody qualities which the world
                  could not afford to be without, and which yet are far from being the most
                  agreeable. Uncompromising firmness, intense self-reliance, with great vigor in
                  that part of the animal nature which fits man to resist and to subdue and to hold
                  in subjection the forces of nature, were his prominent characteristics. His was a
                  bold and granite formation,—most necessary for the stability of the earth, but
                  without a flower.</p>
               <p>His wife was a woman who had once been gay and beautiful, but who, coming under
                  the dominion of a stronger nature, was perfectly magnetized by it, so as to
                  assimilate and become a modified reproduction of the same traits. A calm, intense,
                  severe conscientiousness, which judged alike herself and others with unflinching
                  severity, was her leading characteristic.</p>
               <p>Let us now imagine a child inheriting from the mother a sensitive, nervous
                  organization, and from the father a predisposition to morbid action, with a mind
                  as sensitive to external influence as a daguerreotype-plate, brought suddenly from
                  the warmth of a too-indulgent household to the arctic regularity and frozen
                  stillness of the Farnsworth mansion. It will be seen that the consequences must
                  have been many conflicts, and many struggles of nature with nature, and that a
                  character growing up thus must of course grow up into unnatural and unhealthy
                  development.</p>
               <p>The problem of education is seriously complicated by the peculiarities of
                  womanhood. If we suppose two souls, exactly alike, sent into bodies, the one of
                  man, the other of woman, that mere fact alone alters the whole mental and moral
                  history of the two.</p>
               <p>In addition to all the other sources of peril which beset the little Emily, she
                  early developed a beauty so remarkable as to draw upon her constant attention,
                  and, as she grew older, brought to her all the trials and the dangers which
                  extraordinary beauty brings to woman. It was a part of her Aunt Farnsworth's
                  system to pretend to be ignorant of this great fact, with a view, as she supposed,
                  of checking any disposition to pride or vanity which might naturally arise
                  therefrom. The consequence was that the child, hearing this agreeable news from
                  every one else who surrounded her, soon learned the transparent nature of the
                  hoax, and with it acquired a certain doubt of her aunt's sincerity.</p>
               <p>Emily had a warm, social nature, and had always on hand during her school days a
                  list of enthusiastic friends whose admiration of her supplied the light and warmth
                  which were entirely wanting from every other source.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Farnsworth was not insensible to the charms of her niece. She was, in fact,
                  quite proud of them, but was pursuing conscientiously the course in regard to them
                  which she felt that duty required of her. She loved the child, too, devotedly, but
                  her own nature had been so thoroughly frozen by maxims of self-restraint,<pb
                     n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7953-00000198"/> that this love seldom or never came
                  into outward forms of expression.</p>
               <p>It is sad to be compelled to trace the ill effects produced by the overaction and
                  misapplication of the very noblest faculties of the human mind.</p>
               <p>The Farnsworth family was one in which there was the fullest sympathy with the
                  severest preaching of Dr. Stern. As Emily grew older, it was exacted of her, as
                  one of her Sabbath duties, to take notes of his discourses at church, which were
                  afterwards to be read over on Sunday evening by her aunt and uncle, and preserved
                  in an extract-book.</p>
               <p>The effect of such kinds of religious teaching on most of the children and young
                  people in the town of Adams was to make them consider religion, and everything
                  connected with it, as the most disagreeable of all subjects, and to seek
                  practically to have as little to do with it as possible; so that there was among
                  the young people a great deal of youthful gayety and of young enjoyment in life,
                  notwithstanding the preaching from Sunday to Sunday of assertions enough to freeze
                  every heart with fear. Many formed the habit of thinking of something else during
                  the sermon-time, and many heard without really attaching any very definite meaning
                  to what they heard.</p>
               <p>The severest utterances, if constantly reiterated, lose their power and come to be
                  considered as nothing. But Emily Rossiter had been gifted with a mind of far more
                  than ordinary vigor, and with even a Greek passion for ideas, and with
                  capabilities for logical thought which rendered it impossible for her to listen to
                  discourses so intellectual without taking in their drift and responding to their
                  stimulus by a corresponding intellectual activity.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stern set the example of a perfectly bold and independent manner of differing
                  from the popular theology of his day in certain important respects; and, where he
                  did differ, it was with a hardihood of self-assertion, and an utter disregard of
                  popular opinion, and a perfect reliance on his own powers of discovering truth,
                  which were very apt to magnetize these same qualities in other minds. People who
                  thus set the example of free and independent thinking in one or two respects, and
                  yet hope to constrain their disciples to think exactly as they do on all other
                  subjects, generally reckon without their host; and there is no other region in
                  Massachusetts where all sorts of hardy free-thinking are so rife at the present
                  day as in the region formerly controlled by Dr. Stern.</p>
               <p>Before Emily was fourteen years old she had passed through two or three of those
                  seasons of convulsed and agonized feeling which are caused by the revolt of a
                  strong sense of justice and humanity against teachings which seem to accuse the
                  great Father of all of the most frightful cruelty and injustice. The teachings
                  were backed up by literal quotations from the Bible, which in those days no common
                  person possessed the means, or the habits of thought, for understanding, and thus
                  were accepted by her at first as Divine declarations.</p>
               <p>When these agonized conflicts occurred, they were treated by her aunt and uncle
                  only as active developments of the natural opposition of the human heart to God.
                  Some such period of active contest with the Divine nature was on record in the
                  lives of some of the most eminent New England saints. President Edwards recorded
                  the same; and therefore they looked upon them hopefully, just as the medical
                  faculty of those same uninstructed times looked upon the writhings and agonies
                  which their administration of poison produced in the human body.</p>
               <p>The last and most fearful of these mental struggles came after the death of her
                  favorite brother Theodore; who, being supposed to die in an unregenerate state,
                  was forthwith judged and sentenced, and his final condition spoken of with a grim
                  and solemn certainty, by her aunt and uncle.</p>
               <p>How far the preaching of Dr. Stern did violence to the most cherished feelings of
                  human nature on this subject will appear by an extract from a sermon preached
                  about this time.</p>
               <p>The text was from Rev. xix, 3. "And again they said Alleluia. And her smoke rose
                  up for ever and ever."</p>
               <p>The subject is thus announced:—</p>
               <p>"The heavenly hosts will praise God for punishing the finally impenitent
                  forever."</p>
               <pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7953-00000199"/>
               <p>In the <emph>improvement</emph> or practical application of this text, is the
                  following passage:—</p>
               <p>"Will the heavenly hosts praise God for all the displays of his vindictive justice
                  in the punishment of the damned? then we may learn that there is an essential
                  difference between saints and sinners. Sinners often disbelieve and deny this
                  distinction; and it is very difficult to make them see and believe it. . . . .
                  They sometimes freely say that they do not think that heaven is such a place as
                  has been described; or that the inhabitants of it say 'Amen, Alleluia,' while they
                  see the smoke of the torments of the damned ascend up for ever and ever. They
                  desire and hope to go to heaven, without ever being willing to speak such a
                  language, or to express such feelings in the view of the damned. And is not this
                  saying that their hearts are essentially different from those who feel such a
                  spirit, and are willing to adopt the language of heaven? Good men do adopt the
                  language of heaven before they arrive there. And all who are conscious that they
                  cannot say 'Amen, Alleluia,' may know that they are yet sinners, and essentially
                  different from saints, and altogether unprepared to go with them to heaven and
                  join with them in praising God for the vindictive justice he displays in dooming
                  all unholy creatures to a never-ending torment."</p>
               <p>It was this sermon that finally broke those cords which years of pious descent had
                  made so near and tender between the heart of Emily and her father's Bible.</p>
               <p>No young person ever takes a deliberate and final leave of the faith of the
                  fathers without a pang; and Emily suffered so much in the struggle, that her aunt
                  became alarmed for her health. She was sent to Boston to spend a winter under the
                  care of another sister of her mother's, who was simply a good-natured woman of the
                  world, who was proud of her niece's beauty and talents, and resolved to make the
                  most of them in a purely worldly way.</p>
               <p>At this time she formed the acquaintance of a very interesting French family of
                  high rank, who for certain family reasons were just then exiled to America. She
                  became fascinated with their society, and plunged into the study of the French
                  language and literature with all the enthusiasm of a voyager who finds himself
                  among enchanted islands. And French literature at this time was full of the life
                  of a new era,—the era which produced both the American and the French
                  Revolution.</p>
               <p>The writings of Voltaire were too cold and cynical for her enthusiastic nature;
                  but Rousseau was to her like a sudden translation from the ice and snow of
                  Massachusetts to the tropical flowers of a February in Florida. In "La Nouvelle
                  Héloïse," she found, not merely a passionate love story, but the consideration, on
                  the author's side, of just such problems as had been raised by her theological
                  education.</p>
               <p>When she returned from this visit she was apparently quiet and at peace. Her peace
                  was the peace of a river which has found an underground passage, and therefore
                  chafes and frets no more. Her philosophy was the philosophy of Émile, her faith
                  the faith of the Savoyard vicar, and she imitated Dr. Stern only in utter
                  self-reliance and fearlessness of consequences in pursuit of what she believed
                  true.</p>
               <p>Had her aunt and uncle been able to read the French language, they would have
                  found her note-book of sermons sometimes interspersed by quotations from her
                  favorite author, which certainly were quite in point; as, for instance, at the
                  foot of a severe sermon on the doctrine of reprobation was written:—</p>
               <p>"Quand cette dure et décourageante doctrine se déduit de l'Écriture elle-même, mon
                  premier devoir n'est-il pas d'honorer Dieu? Quelque respect que je doive au texte
                  sacré, j'en dois plus encore à son Auteur; et <emph>j'aimerais mieux croire la

               <p>After a period of deceitful quiet and calm, in which Emily read and wrote and
                  studied alone in her room, and moved about in her daily circle like one whose
                  heart is afar off, she suddenly disappeared from them all. She left ostensibly to
                  go on a visit to Boston to her aunt, and all that was ever heard from her after
                  that was a letter of final farewell to Miss Mehitable, in which she told her
                  briefly, that, unable any longer to endure the life she had been leading, and to
                  seem to believe what she could not believe, and being importuned to practise what
                  she never intended to do, she had chosen her lot for herself, and requested her
                  neither to seek her out nor to inquire after her, as all such inquiries would be
                  absolutely vain.</p>
               <p>All that could be ascertained on the subject was, that about this time the Marquis
                  de Conté and his lady were found to have sailed for France.</p>
               <p>This was the sad story which Miss Mehitable poured into the sympathetic ear of

               <head type="sub">WE BEGIN TO BE GROWN-UP PEOPLE.</head>
               <p>WE begin to be grown-up people. We cannot always remain in the pleasant valley of
                  childhood. I myself, good reader, have dwelt on its scenes longer, because,
                  looking back on it from the extreme end of life, it seems to my weary eyes so
                  fresh and beautiful; the dew of the morning-land lies on it,—that dew which no
                  coming day will restore.</p>
               <p>Our childhood, as the reader has seen, must be confessed to have been reasonably
                  enjoyable. Its influences were all homely, innocent, and pure. There was no
                  seductive vice, no open or covert immorality. Our worst form of roaring
                  dissipation consisted in being too fond of huckleberry parties, or in the
                  immoderate pursuit of chestnuts and walnuts. Even the vagrant associates of
                  uncertain social standing who abounded in Oldtown were characterized by a kind of
                  woodland innocence, and were not much more harmful than woodchucks and
                  squirrels.</p>
               <p>Sam Lawson, for instance, though he dearly loved lazy lounging, and was devoted to
                  idle tramps, was yet a most edifying vagrant. A profane word was an abomination in
                  his sight; his speculations on doctrines were all orthodox, and his expositions of
                  Scripture as original and abundant as those of some of the dreamy old fathers. As
                  a general thing he was a devout Sunday keeper and a pillar of the sanctuary,
                  playing his bass-viol to the most mournful tunes with evident relish.</p>
               <p>I remember being once left at home alone on Sunday, with an incipient sore-throat,
                  when Sam volunteered himself as my nurse. In the course of the forenoon stillness,
                  a wandering Indian came in, who, by the joint influence of a large mug of cider
                  and the weariness of his tramp, fell into a heavy sleep on our kitchen floor, and
                  somehow Sam was beguiled to amuse himself by tickling his nose with a broom-straw,
                  and laughing, until the tears<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7953-00000201"/> rolled
                  down his cheeks, at the sleepy snorts and struggles and odd contortions of visage
                  which were the results. Yet so tender was Sam's conscience, that he had frequent
                  searchings of heart, afterward, on account of this profanation of sacred hours,
                  and indulged in floods of long-winded penitence.</p>
               <p>Though Sam abhorred all profanity, yet for seasons of extreme provocation he was
                  well provided with that gentler Yankee litany which affords to the irritated mind
                  the comfort of swearing, without the commission of the sin. Under great pressure
                  of provocation Sam Lawson freely said, "Darn it!" The word "darn," in fact, was to
                  the conscientious New England mind a comfortable resting-place, a refreshment to
                  the exacerbated spirit, that shrunk from that too similar word with an <hi
                     rend="i"/>m in it.</p>
               <p>In my boyhood I sometimes pondered that other hard word, and vaguely decided to
                  speak it, with that awful curiosity which gives to an unknown sin a hold upon the
                  imagination. What would happen if I should say "damn"? I dwelt on that subject
                  with a restless curiosity which my grandmother certainly would have told me was a
                  temptation of the Devil. The horrible desire so grew on me, that once, in the
                  sanctity of my own private apartment, with all the doors shut and locked, I
                  thought I would boldly try the experiment of saying "damn" out loud, and seeing
                  what would happen. I did it, and looked up apprehensively to see if the walls were
                  going to fall on me, but they did n't, and I covered up my head in the bedclothes
                  and felt degraded. I had committed the sin, and got not even the excitement of a
                  catastrophe. The Lord apparently did not think me worth his notice.</p>
               <p>In regard to the awful questions of my grandmother's blue book, our triad grew up
                  with varying influences. Harry, as I have said, was one of those quiet human
                  beings, of great force in native individuality, who silently draw from all scenes
                  and things just those elements which their own being craves, and resolutely and
                  calmly think their own thoughts, and live their own life, amid the most discordant
                  influences; just as the fluid, sparkling waters of a mountain brook dart this way
                  and that amid stones and rubbish, and hum to themselves their own quiet, hidden
                  tune.</p>
               <p>A saintly woman, whose heart was burning itself away in the torturing fires of a
                  slow martyrdom, had been for the first ten years of his life his only companion
                  and teacher, and, dying, had sealed him with a seal given from a visibly opened
                  heaven; and thenceforward no theologies, and no human authority, had the power and
                  weight with him that had the remembrance of those dying eyes, and the sanctity of
                  those last counsels.</p>
               <p>By native descent Harry was a gentleman of the peculiarly English stock. He had
                  the shy reserve, the silent, self-respecting pride and delicacy, which led him to
                  keep his own soul as a castle, and that interested, because it left a sense of
                  something veiled and unexpressed.</p>
               <p>We were now eighteen years old, and yet, during all these years that he had lived
                  side by side with me in closest intimacy, he had never spoken to me freely and
                  frankly of that which I afterwards learned was always the intensest and bitterest
                  mortification of his life, namely, his father's desertion of his mother and
                  himself. Once only do I remember ever to have seen him carried away by anger, and
                  that was when a coarse and cruel bully among the school-boys applied to him a name
                  which reflected on his mother's honor. The anger of such quiet people is often a
                  perfect convulsion, and it was so in this case. He seemed to blaze with it,—to
                  flame up and redden with a delirious passion; and he knocked down and stamped upon
                  the boy with a blind fury which it was really frightful to see, and which was in
                  singular contrast with his usual unprovokable good-humor.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport had made good his promise of looking for the pocket-book which
                  Harry's father had left in his country-seat, and the marriage certificate of his
                  mother had been found in it, and carefully lodged in the hands of Lady Lothrop;
                  but nothing had been said to us children about it; it was merely held quietly, as
                  a document that might be of use in time in bringing some property to the children.
                  And even at the time of this fight with the school-boy, Harry said so little
                  afterward, that the real depth of his feeling on this subject was not
                  suspected.</p>
               <p>I have reason to believe, also, that Ellery Davenport did succeed in making the
                  father of Harry and Tina aware of the<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7953-00000202"/>
                  existence of two such promising children, and of the respectability of the
                  families into which they had been adopted. Captain Percival, now Sir Harry
                  Percival, had married again in England, so Ellery Davenport had informed Miss
                  Mehitable in a letter, and had a son by this marriage, and so had no desire to
                  bring to view his former connection. It was understood, I believe, that a sum of
                  money was to be transmitted yearly to the hands of the guardians of the children,
                  for their benefit, and that they were to be left undisturbed in the possession of
                  those who had adopted them.</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable had suffered so extremely herself by the conflict of her own
                  earnest, melancholy nature with the theologic ideas of her time, that she shrunk
                  with dread from imposing them on the gay and joyous little being whose education
                  she had undertaken. Yet she was impressed by that awful sense of responsibility
                  which is one of the most imperative characteristics of the New England mind; and
                  she applied to her brother earnestly to know what she should teach Tina with
                  regard to her own spiritual position. The reply of her brother was characteristic,
                  and we shall give it here:—</p>

                              your child on the ground of the old Cambridge Platform, and teach her
                              as Winthrop and Dudley and the Mathers taught their children,—that she
                              'is already a member in the Church of Christ,—that she is in covenant
                              with God, and hath the seal thereof upon her, to wit, baptism; and so,
                              if not regenerate, is yet in a more hopeful way of attaining
                              regeneration and all spiritual blessings, both of the covenant and

                              years of a sense of disinheritance with which you struggled will be

               <p>The consequence of all this was, that Tina adopted in her glad and joyous nature
                  the simple, helpful faith of her brother,—the faith in an ever good, ever present,
                  ever kind Father, whose child she was and in whose household she had grown up. She
                  had a most unbounded faith in prayer, and in the indulgence and tenderness of the
                  Heavenly Power. All things to her eyes were seen through the halo of a cheerful,
                  sanguine, confiding nature. Life had for her no cloud or darkness or mystery.</p>
               <p>As to myself, I had been taught in the contrary doctrines,—that I was a
                  disinherited child of wrath. It is true that this doctrine was contradicted by the
                  whole influence of the minister, who, as I have said before, belonged to the
                  Arminian wing of the Church, and bore very mildly on all these great topics. My
                  grandmother sometimes endeavored to stir him up to more decisive orthodoxy, and
                  especially to a more vigorous presentation of the doctrine of native human
                  depravity. I remember once, in her zeal, her quoting to him as a proof-text the
                  quatrain of Dr. Watts:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Conceived in sin, O woful state!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Before we draw our breath,</l>
                        <l>The first young pulse begins to beat</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Iniquity and death."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"That, madam," said Dr. Lothrop, who never forgot to be the grand gentleman under
                  any circumstances,—"that, madam, is not the New Testament, but Dr. Isaac Watts,
                  allow me to remind you."</p>
               <p>"Well," said my grandmother, "Dr. Watts got it from the Bible."</p>
               <pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7953-00000203"/>
               <p>"Yes, madam, a <emph>very long way</emph> from the Bible, allow me to say."</p>
               <p>And yet, after all, though I did not like my grandmother's Calvinistic doctrines,
                  I must confess that she, and all such as thought like her, always impressed me as
                  being more earnestly religious than those that held the milder and more moderate
                  belief.</p>
               <p>Once in a while old Dr. Stern would preach in our neighborhood, and I used to go
                  to hear him. Everybody went to hear him. A sermon on reprobation from Dr. Stern
                  would stir up a whole community in those days, just as a presidential election
                  stirs one up now. And I remember that he used to impress me as being more like a
                  messenger from the other world than most ministers. Dr. Lothrop's sermons, by the
                  side of his, were like Pope's Pastorals beside the Tragedies of Æschylus. Dr.
                  Lothrop's discourses were smooth, they were sensible, they were well worded, and
                  everybody went to sleep under them; but Dr. Stern shook and swayed his audience
                  like a field of grain under a high wind. There was no possibility of not listening
                  to him, or of hearing him with indifference, for he dealt in assertions that would
                  have made the very dead turn in their graves. One of his sermons was talked of for
                  months afterward, with a sort of suppressed breath of supernatural awe, such as
                  men would use in discussing the reappearance of a soul from the other world.</p>
               <p>But meanwhile I believed neither my grandmother, nor Dr. Stern, nor the minister.
                  The eternal questions seethed and boiled and burned in my mind without answer. It
                  was not my own personal destiny that lay with weight on my mind; it was the
                  incessant, restless desire to know the real truth from some unanswerable
                  authority. I longed for a visible, tangible communion with God; I longed to see
                  the eternal beauty, to hear a friendly voice from the eternal silence. Among all
                  the differences with regard to doctrinal opinion, I could see clearly that there
                  were two classes of people in the world,—those who had found God and felt him as a
                  living power upon their spirits, and those who had not; and that unknown
                  experience was what I sought.</p>
               <p>Such, then, were we three children when Harry and I were in our eighteenth year
                  and Tina in her fifteenth. And just at this moment there was among the high
                  consulting powers that regulated our destiny a movement as to what further was to
                  be done with the three that had hitherto grown up together.</p>
               <p>Now, if the reader has attentively read ancient and modern history, he will
                  observe that there is a class of women to be found in this lower world, who,
                  wherever they are, are sure to be in some way the first or the last cause of
                  everything that is going on. Everybody knows, for instance, that Helen was the
                  great instigator of the Trojan war, and if it had not been for her we should have
                  had no Homer. In France, Madame Récamier was, for the time being, reason enough
                  for almost anything that any man in France did; and yet one cannot find out that
                  Madame Récamier had any uncommon genius of her own, except the sovereign one of
                  charming every human being that came in her way, so that all became her humble and
                  subservient subjects. The instance is a marked one, because it operated in a wide
                  sphere, on very celebrated men, in an interesting historic period. But it
                  individualizes a kind of faculty which, generally speaking, is peculiar to women,
                  though it is in some instances exercised by men,—a faculty of charming and
                  controlling every person with whom one has to do.</p>
               <p>Tina was now verging toward maturity; she was in just that delicious period in
                  which the girl has all the privileges and graces of childhood, its freedom of
                  movement and action, brightened with a sort of mysterious aurora by the coming
                  dawn of womanhood; and everything indicated that she was to be one of this
                  powerful class of womankind. Can one analyze the charm which such women possess? I
                  have a theory that, in all cases, there is a certain amount of genius with
                  it,—genius which does not declare itself in literature, but in social life, and
                  which devotes itself to pleasing, as other artists devote themselves to painting
                  or to poetry.</p>
               <p>Tina had no inconsiderable share of self-will; she was very pronounced in her
                  tastes, and fond of her own way; but she had received from nature this passion for
                  entertaining, and been<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7953-00000204"/> endowed with
                  varied talents in this line which made her always, from early childhood, the
                  coveted and desired person in every circle. Not a visage in Oldtown was so set in
                  grimness of care, that it did not relax its lines when it saw Tina coming down the
                  street; for Tina could mimic and sing and dance, and fling back joke for joke in a
                  perfect meteoric shower. So long as she entertained, she was perfectly indifferent
                  who the party was. She would display her accomplishments to a set of strolling
                  Indians, or for Sam Lawson and Jake Marshall, as readily as for any one else. She
                  would run up and catch the minister by the elbow as he solemnly and decorously
                  moved down street, and his face always broke into a laugh at the sight of her.</p>
               <p>The minister's lady, and Aunt Lois, and Miss Deborah Kittery, while they used to
                  mourn in secret places over her want of decorum in thus displaying her talents
                  before the lower classes, would afterward laugh till the tears rolled down their
                  cheeks and their ancient whalebone stays creaked, when she would do the same thing
                  over in a select circle for them.</p>
               <p>We have seen how completely she had conquered Polly, and what difficulty Miss
                  Mehitable found in applying the precepts of Mrs. Chapone and Miss Hannah More to
                  her case. The pattern young lady of the period, in the eyes of all respectable
                  females, was expressed by Lucilla Stanley, in "Cœlebs in Search of a Wife." But
                  when Miss Mehitable, after delighting herself with the Johnsonian balance of the
                  rhythmical sentences which described this paragon as "not so much perfectly
                  beautiful as perfectly elegant,"—this model of consistency, who always blushed at
                  the right moment, spoke at the right moment, and stopped at the right moment, and
                  was, in short, a woman made to order, precisely to suit a bachelor who had
                  traversed the whole earth, "not expecting perfection, but looking for
                  consistency,"—when, after all these charming visions, she <choice>
                     <sic>loooked</sic>
                     <corr>looked</corr>
                  </choice> at Tina, she was perfectly dismayed at contemplating her scholar. She
                  felt the power by which Tina continually charmed and beguiled her, and the empire
                  which she exercised over her; and, with wonderful good sense, she formally laid
                  down the weapons of authority when she found she had no heart to use them.</p>
               <p>"My child," she said to her one day, when that young lady was about eleven years
                  of age, "you are a great deal stronger than I. I am weak because I love you, and
                  because I have been broken by sorrow, and because, being a poor old woman, I don't
                  trust myself. And you are young and strong and fearless; but remember, dear, the
                  life you have to live is yours and not mine. I have not the heart to force you to
                  take my way instead of your own, but I shall warn you that it will be better you
                  should do so, and then leave you free. If you don't take my way, I shall do the
                  very best for you that I can in your way, and you must take the responsibility in
                  the end."</p>
               <p>This was the only kind of system which Miss Mehitable was capable of carrying out.
                  She was wise, shrewd, and loving, and she gradually controlled her little charge
                  more and more by simple influence, but she had to meet in her education the
                  opposition force of that universal petting and spoiling which everybody in society
                  gives to an entertaining child.</p>
               <p>Life is such a monotonous, dull affair, that anybody who has the gift of making it
                  pass off gayly is in great demand. Tina was sent for to the parsonage, and the
                  minister took her on his knee and encouraged her to chatter all sorts of egregious
                  nonsense to him. And Miss Deborah Kittery insisted on having her sent for to visit
                  them in Boston, and old Madam Kittery over whelmed her with indulgence and
                  caresses. Now Tina loved praises and caresses; incense was the very breath of her
                  nostrils; and she enjoyed being fêted and petted as much as a cat enjoys being
                  stroked.</p>
               <p>It will not be surprising to one who considers the career of this kind of girl to
                  hear that she was not much of a student. What she learned was by impulses and fits
                  and starts, and all of it immediately used for some specific purpose of
                  entertainment, so that among simple people she had the reputation of being a
                  prodigy of information, on a very small capital of actual knowledge. Miss
                  Mehitable sighed after thorough knowledge and discipline of mind for her charge,
                  but she invariably found all Tina's teachers becoming accomplices in her
                  superficial practices by praising and caressing her when she had been least
                     faithful,<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7953-00000205"/> always apologizing for her
                  deficiencies, and speaking in the most flattering terms of her talents. During the
                  last year the school-master had been observed always to walk home with her and
                  bring her books, with a humble, trembling subserviency and prostrate humility
                  which she rewarded with great apparent contempt; and finally she announced to Miss
                  Mehitable that she "did n't intend to go to school any more, because the master
                  acted so silly."</p>
               <p>Now Miss Mehitable, during all her experience of life, had always associated with
                  the men of her acquaintance without ever being reminded in any particular manner
                  of the difference of sex, and it was a subject which, therefore, was about the
                  last to enter into her calculations with regard to her little charge. So she said,
                  "My dear, you should n't speak in that way about your teacher; he knows a great
                  deal more than you do."</p>
               <p>"He may know more than I do about arithmetic, but he does n't know how to behave.
                  What right has he to put his old hand under my chin? and I won't have him putting
                  his arm round me when he sets my copies! and I told him to-day he should n't carry
                  my books home any more,—so there!"</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable was struck dumb. She went that afternoon and visited the minister's
                  lady.</p>
               <p>"Depend upon it, my dear," said Lady Lothrop, "it's time to try a course of home
                  reading."</p>
               <p>A bright idea now struck Miss Mehitable. Her cousin, Mr. Mordecai Rossiter, had
                  recently been appointed a colleague with the venerable Dr. Lothrop. He was a young
                  man, finely read, and of great solidity and piety, and Miss Mehitable resolved to
                  invite him to take up his abode with them for the purpose of assisting her
                  educational efforts. Mr. Mordecai Rossiter accordingly took up his abode in the
                  family, used to conduct family worship, and was expected now and then to drop
                  words of good advice and wholesome counsel to form the mind of Miss Tina. A daily
                  hour was appointed during which he was to superintend her progress in
                  arithmetic.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordecai Rossiter was one of the most simple-minded, honest, sincere human
                  beings that ever wore a black coat. He accepted his charge in sacred simplicity,
                  and took a prayerful view of his young catechumen, whom he was in hopes to make
                  realize, by degrees, the native depravity of her own heart, and to lead through a
                  gradual process to the best of all results.</p>
               <p>Miss Tina also took a view of her instructor, and without any evil intentions,
                  simply following her strongest instinct, which was to entertain and please, she
                  very soon made herself an exceedingly delightful pupil. Since religion was
                  evidently the engrossing subject in his mind, Tina also turned her attention to
                  it, and instructed and edified him with flights of devout eloquence which were to
                  him perfectly astonishing. Tina would discourse on the goodness of God, and
                  ornament her remarks with so many flowers, and stars, and poetical fireworks, and
                  be so rapt and carried away with her subject, that he would sit and listen to her
                  as if she was an inspired being, and wholly forget the analysis which he meant to
                  propose to her, as to whether her emotions of love to God proceeded from self-love
                  or from disinterested benevolence.</p>
               <p>As I have said, Tina had a genius for poetry, and had employed the dull hours
                  which children of her age usually spend in church in reading the psalm-book and
                  committing to memory all the most vividly emotional psalms and hymns. And these
                  she was fond of repeating with great fervor and enthusiasm to her admiring
                  listener.</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable considered that the schoolmaster had been an ill-taught,
                  presumptuous man, who had ventured to take improper liberties with a mere child;
                  but, when she established this connection between this same child and a solemn
                  young minister, it never occurred to her to imagine that there would be any
                  embarrassing consequences from the relation. She considered Tina as a mere
                  infant,—as not yet having approached the age when the idea of anything like love
                  or marriage could possibly be suggested to her.</p>
               <p>In course of time, however, she could not help remarking that her cousin was in
                  some respects quite an altered man. He reformed many little negligences in regard
                  to his toilet which Miss Tina had pointed out to him with the nonchalant freedom
                  of a young<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7953-00000206"/> empress. And he would run
                  and spring and fetch and carry in her service with a zeal and alertness quite
                  wonderful to behold. He expressed privately to Miss Mehitable the utmost
                  astonishment at her mental powers, and spoke of the wonderful work of divine grace
                  which appeared to have made such progress in her heart. Never had he been so
                  instructed and delighted before by the exercises of any young person. And he went
                  so far as to assure Miss Mehitable that in many things he should be only too happy
                  to sit at her feet and learn of her.</p>
               <p>"Good gracious me!" said Miss Mehitable to herself, with a sort of half start of
                  awakening, though not yet fully come to consciousness; "what does ail everybody
                  that gets hold of Tina?"</p>
               <p>What got hold of her cousin in this case she had an opportunity of learning, not
                  long after, by overhearing him tell her young charge that she was an angel, and
                  that he asked nothing more of Heaven than to be allowed to follow her lead through
                  life. Now Miss Tina accepted this, as she did all other incense, with great
                  satisfaction. Not that she had the slightest idea of taking this clumsy-footed
                  theological follower round the world with her; but having the highest possible
                  respect for him, knowing that Miss Mehitable and the minister and his wife thought
                  him a person of consideration, she had felt it her duty to <emph>please</emph>
                  him,—had taxed her powers of pleasing to the utmost, in his own line, and had met
                  with this gratifying evidence of success.</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable was for once really angry. She sent for her cousin to a private
                  interview, and thus addressed him:—</p>
               <p>"Cousin Mordecai, I thought you were a man of sense when I put this child under
                  your care! My great trouble in bringing her up is, that everybody flatters her and
                  defers to her; but I thought that in you I had got a man that could be depended
                  on!"</p>
               <p>"I do <emph>not</emph> flatter her, cousin," replied the young minister,
                  earnestly.</p>
               <p>"You pretend you don't flatter her? did n't I hear you calling her an angel?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't care if I did; she <emph>is</emph> an angel," said Mr. Mordecai
                  decai Rossiter, with tears in his eyes; "she is the most perfectly heavenly being
                  I ever saw!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! bah!" said Miss Mehitable, with intense disgust; "what fools you men
                  are!"</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable now, much as she disliked it, felt bound to have some cautionary
                  conversation with Miss Tina.</p>
               <p>"My dear," she said; "you must be very careful in your treatment of Cousin
                  Mordecai. I overheard some things he said to you this morning which I do not
                  approve of."</p>
               <p>"O yes, Aunty, he does talk in a silly way sometimes. Men always begin to talk
                  that way to me. Why, you've no idea the things they will say. Well, of course I
                  don't believe them; it's only a foolish way they have, but they all talk just
                  alike."</p>
               <p>"But I thought my cousin would have had his mind on better things," said Miss
                  Mehitable. "The idea of his making love to you!"</p>
               <p>"I know it; only think of it, Aunty! how very funny it is! and there, I have n't
                  done a single thing to make him. I've been just as religious as I could be, and
                  said hymns to him, and everything, and given him good advice,—ever so
                  much,—because, you see, he did n't know about a great many things till I told
                  him."</p>
               <p>"But, my dear, all this is going to make him too fond of you; you know you ought
                  not to be thinking of such things now."</p>
               <p>"What things, Aunty?" said the catechumen, innocently.</p>
               <p>"Why, love and marriage; that's what such feelings will come to, if you encourage
                  them."</p>
               <p>"Marriage! O dear me, what nonsense!" and Tina laughed till the room rang again.
                  "Why, dear Aunty, what absurd ideas have got into your head! Of course you can't
                  think that he's thinking of any such thing; he's only getting very fond of me, and
                  I'm trying to make him have a good time,—that's all."</p>
               <p>But Miss Tina found that was not all, and was provoked beyond endurance at the
                  question proposed to her in plain terms, whether she would not look upon her
                  teacher as one destined in a year or two to become her husband. Thereupon at once
                     the<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7953-00000207"/> whole gay fabric dissolved like
                  a dream. Tina was as vexed at the proposition as a young unbroken colt is at the
                  sight of a halter. She cried, and said she did n't like him, she could n't bear
                  him, and she never wanted to see him again,—that he was silly and ridiculous to
                  talk so to a little girl. And Miss Mehitable sat down to write a long letter to
                  her brother, to inquire what she should do next.</p>

                  what to do with Tina. She is the very light of my eyes,—the sweetest, gayest,
                  brightest, and best-meaning little mortal that ever was made; but somehow or other
                  I fear I am not the one that ought to have undertaken to bring her up.</p>
               <p>"She has a good deal of self-will; so much that I have long felt it would be quite
                  impossible for me to control her merely by authority. In fact I laid down my
                  sceptre long ago, such as it was. I never did have much of a gift in that way. But
                  Tina's self-will runs in the channel of a most charming persuasiveness. She has
                  all sorts of pretty phrases, and would talk a bird off from a bush, or a trout out
                  of a brook, by dint of sheer persistent eloquence; and she is always so
                  delightfully certain that her way is the right one and the best for me and all
                  concerned. Then she has no end of those peculiar gifts of entertainment which are
                  rather dangerous things for a young woman. She is a born mimic, she is a natural
                  actress, and she has always a repartee or a smart saying quite <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">apropos</foreign> at the tip of her tongue. All this makes her
                  an immense favorite with people who have no responsibility about her,—who merely
                  want to be amused with her drolleries, and then shake their heads wisely when she
                  is gone, and say that Miss Mehitable Rossiter ought to keep a close hand on that
                  girl.</p>
               <p>"It seems to be the common understanding that everybody but me is to spoil her;
                  for there is n't anybody, not even Dr. Lothrop and his wife, that won't connive at
                  her mimicking and fripperies, and then talk gravely with me afterward about the
                  danger of these things, as if I were the only person to say anything disagreeable
                  to her. But then, I can see very plainly that the little chit is in danger on all
                  sides of becoming trivial and<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7953-00000208"/>
                  superficial,—of mistaking wit for wisdom, and thinking she has answered an
                  argument when she has said a smart thing and raised a laugh.</p>
               <p>"Of late, trouble of another kind has been added. Tina is a little turned of
                  fifteen; she is going to be very beautiful; she is very pretty now; and, in
                  addition to all my other perplexities, the men are beginning to talk that
                  atrocious kind of nonsense to her which they seem to think they must talk to young
                  girls. I have had to take her away from the school on account of the schoolmaster,
                  and when I put her under the care of Cousin Mordecai Rossiter, whom I thought old
                  enough, and discreet enough, to make a useful teacher to her, he has acted like a
                  natural fool. I have no kind of patience with him. I would not have believed a man
                  could be so devoid of common sense. I shall have to send Tina somewhere,—though I
                  can't bear to part with her, and it seems like taking the very sunshine out of the
                  house; so I remember what you told me about sending her up to you.</p>
               <p>"Lady Lothrop and Lois Badger and I have been talking together, and we think the
                  boys might as well go up too to your academy, as our present schoolmaster is not
                  very competent, and you will give them a thorough fitting for college."</p>
               <p>To this came the following reply:—</p>

                              I would like to have a hand at them. One of them might live with us
                              and do the out-door chores and help hoe in the garden, and the other
                              might do the same for the minister. So send them along.</p>

               <p>This was an era in our lives. Harry and I from this time felt ourselves to be
                     <emph>men,</emph> and thereafter adopted the habit of speaking of ourselves
                  familiarly as "a man of my character," "a man of my age," and "a man in my
                  circumstances." The comfort and dignity which this imparted to us were wonderful.
                  We also discussed Tina in a very paternal way, and gravely considered what was
                  best for her. We were, of course, properly shocked at the behavior of the
                  schoolmaster, and greatly applauded her spirit in defending herself against his
                  presumption.</p>
               <p>Then Tina had told Harry and me all about her trouble with the minister, and I
                  remember at this time how extremely aged and venerable I felt, and what quantities
                  of good advice I gave to Tina, which was all based on the supposition of her
                  dangerously powerful charms and attractions. This is the edifying kind of counsel
                  with which young gentlemen of my age instruct their lady friends, and it will be
                  seen at once that advice and admonition which rest on the theory of superhuman
                  excellence and attractions in the advised party are far more agreeable than the
                  rough, common admonitions, generally addressed to boys at this time of life, which
                  are unseasoned by any such pleasing hallucination.</p>
               <p>There is now a general plea in society that women shall be educated more as men
                  are, and we hear much talk as if the difference between them and our sex is merely
                  one of difference in education. But how could it be helped that Tina should be
                  educated and formed wholly unlike Harry and myself, when every address made to her
                  from her childhood was of necessity wholly different from what would be made to a
                  boy in the same circumstances? and particularly when she carried with her always
                  that dizzying, blinding charm which turned the head of every boy and man that
                  undertook to talk reason to her?</p>
               <p>In my own mind I had formed my plan of life. I was to go to college, and therefrom
                  soar to an unmeasured height of literary distinction, and when I had won trophies
                  and laurels and renown, I was to come back and lay all at Tina's feet. This was
                  what Harry and I agreed on, in many a conversation, as the destined result of our
                  friendship.</p>
               <p>Harry and I had sworn friendship by all the solemn oaths and forms known in
                  ancient or modern history. We changed names<pb n="408-409"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000209"/> with each other, and in our private notes and
                  letters addressed each by the name of the other, and felt as if this was some
                  sacred and wonderful peculiarity. Tina called us both brothers, and this we agreed
                  was the best means of preserving her artless mind unalarmed and undisturbed until
                  the future hour of the great declaration. As for Tina, she absolutely could not
                  keep anything to herself if she tried. Whatever agitated her mind or interested it
                  had to be told to us. She did not seem able to rest satisfied with herself till
                  she had proved to us that she was exactly right, or made us share her triumphs in
                  her achievements, or her perplexity in her failures.</p>
               <p>At this crisis Miss Mehitable talked very seriously and sensibly with her little
                  charge. She pointed out to her the danger of living a trivial and superficial
                  life,—of becoming vain, and living merely for admiration. She showed her how
                  deficient she had been in those attainments which require perseverance and
                  steadiness of mind, and earnestly recommended her now to devote herself to serious
                  studies.</p>
               <p>Nobody was a better subject to preach such a sermon to than Tina. She would even
                  take up the discourse and enlarge upon it, and suggest new and fanciful
                  illustrations; she entered into the project of Miss Mehitable with enthusiasm; she
                  confessed all her faults, and resolved hereafter to become a pattern of the
                  contrary virtues. And then she came and related the whole conversation to us, and
                  entered into the project of devoting herself to study with such a glow of
                  enthusiasm, that we formed at once the most brilliant expectations.</p>
               <p>The town of Cloudland, whither we were going, was a two days' journey up into the
                  mountains; and, as travelling facilities then were, it was viewed as such an
                  undertaking to send us there, that the whole family conclave talked gravely of it
                  and discussed it in every point of view, for a fortnight before we started. Our
                  Uncle Jacob, the good, meek, quiet farmer of whom I have spoken, had a little
                  business in regard to some property that had been left by a relative of his wife
                  in that place, and suggested the possibility of going up with us himself. So
                  weighty a move was at first thrown out as a mere proposal to be talked of in the
                  family circle. Grandmother and Aunt Lois and Aunt Keziah and my mother picked over
                  and discussed this proposition for days, as a lot of hens will pick over an ear of
                  corn, turning it from side to side, and looking at it from every possible point of
                  view. Uncle Fliakim had serious thoughts of offering his well-worn equipage, but
                  it was universally admitted that his constant charities had kept it in such a
                  condition of frailty that the mountain roads would finish it, and thus deprive
                  multitudes of the female population of Oldtown of an establishment which was about
                  as much their own as if they had the care and keeping of it.</p>
               <p>I don't know anybody who could have been taken from Oldtown whose loss would have
                  been more universally felt and deplored than little Miss Tina's. In the first
                  place, Oldtown had come into the way of regarding her as a sort of Child of the
                  Regiment, and then Tina was one of those sociable, acquaintance-making bodies that
                  have visited everybody, penetrated everybody's affairs, and given a friendly lift
                  now and then in almost everybody's troubles.</p>
               <p>"Why, lordy massy!" said Sam Lawson, "I don't know nothin' what we 're any on us
                  goin' to do when Tiny's gone. Why, there ain't a dog goes into the meetin'-house
                  but wags his tail when he sees her a comin'. I expect she knows about every
                  yellow-bird's nest an' blue jay's an' bobolink's an' meadow-lark's that there's
                  ben round here these five years, an' how they's goin' to set an' hatch without her
                  's best known to 'em-selves, I s'pose. Lordy massy! that child can sing so like a
                  skunk blackbird that you can't tell which is which. Wal, I 'll say one thing for
                  her; she draws the fire out o' Hepsy, an' she 's 'bout the only livin' critter
                  that can; but some nights when she 's ben inter our house a playin' checkers or
                  fox an' geese with the child'en, she 'd railly git Hepsy slicked down so that 't
                  was kind o' comfortable bein' with her. I'm sorry she's goin', for my part, an'
                  all the child'en 'll be sorry."</p>
               <p>As for Polly, she worked night and day on Tina's outfit, and scolded and hectored
                  herself for certain tears that now and then dropped on the white aprons that she
                  was ironing. On the night<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC7953-00000210"/> before Tina
                  was to depart, Polly came into her room and insisted upon endowing her with her
                  string of gold beads, the only relic of earthly vanity in which that severe female
                  had ever been known to indulge. Tina was quite melted, and fell upon her neck.</p>
               <p>"Why, Polly! No, no; you dear old creature, you, you 've been a thousand times too
                  good for me, and I 've nearly plagued the life out of you, and you sha' n't give
                  me your poor, dear, old gold beads, but keep them yourself, for you 're as good as
                  gold any day, and so it 's a great deal better that you should wear them."</p>
               <p>"O Tina, child, you don't know my heart," said Polly, shaking her head solemnly;
                  "if you could see the depths of depravity that there are there!"</p>
               <p>"I don't believe a word of it, Polly."</p>
               <p>"Ah! but, you see, the Lord seeth not as man sees, Tina."</p>
               <p>"I know he don't," said Tina; "he 's a thousand times kinder, and makes a thousand
                  more excuses for us than we ever do for ourselves or each other. You know the
                  Bible says, 'He knoweth our frame, he remembereth that we are dust.'"</p>
               <p>"O Tina, Tina, you always was a wonderful child to talk," said Polly, shaking her
                  head doubtfully; "but then you know the heart is so deceitful, and then you see
                  there 's the danger that we should mistake natural emotions for grace."</p>
               <p>"O, I dare say there are all sorts of dangers," said Tina; "of course there are. I
                  know I'm nothing but just a poor little silly bird; but He knows it too, and he 's
                  taken care of ever so many such little silly people as I am, so that I 'm not
                  afraid. He won't let me deceive myself. You know, when that bird got shut in the
                  house the other day, how much time you and I and Miss Mehitable all spent in
                  trying to keep it from breaking its foolish head against the glass, and flying
                  into the fire, and all that, and how glad we were when we got it safe out into the
                  air. I 'm sure we are not half as good as God is, and, if we take so much care
                  about a poor little bird that we did n't make and had nothing to do with, he must
                  care a good deal more about us when we are his children. And God is all the Father
                  I have or ever knew."</p>
               <p>This certainly looked to Polly like very specious reasoning, but, after all, the
                  faithful creature groaned in spirit. Might not this all be mere natural religion
                  and not the supernatural grace? So she said trembling: "O Tina, did you always
                  feel so towards God? wa' n't there a time when your heart rose in opposition to
                  him?"</p>
               <p>"O, certainly," said Tina, "when Miss Asphyxia used to talk to me about it, I
                  thought I never wanted to hear of him, and I never said my prayers; but as soon as
                  I came to Aunty, she was so loving and kind that I began to see what God must be
                  like,—because I know he is kinder than she can be, or you, or anybody can be.
                  That's so, is n't it? You know the Bible says his loving-kindness is
                  infinite."</p>
               <p>The thing in this speech which gave Polly such peculiar satisfaction was the
                  admission that there had been a definite point of time in which the feelings of
                  her little friend had undergone a distinct change. Henceforth she was better
                  satisfied,—never reflecting how much she was trusting to a mere state of mind in
                  the child, instead of resting her faith on the Almighty Friend who so evidently
                  had held her in charge during the whole of her short history.</p>
               <p>As for me, the eve of my departure was to me one of triumph. When I had seen all
                  my father's Latin books fairly stowed away in my trunk, with the very simple
                  wardrobe which belonged to Harry and me, and the trunk had been shut and locked
                  and corded, and we were to start at sunrise the next morning, I felt as if my
                  father's unfulfilled life-desire was at last going to be accomplished in me.</p>
               <p>It was a bright, clear, starlight night in June, and we were warned to go to bed
                  early, that we might be ready in season the next morning. As usual, Harry fell
                  fast asleep, and I was too nervous and excited to close my eyes. I began to think
                  of the old phantasmagoria of my childish days, which now so seldom appeared to me.
                  I felt stealing over me that peculiar thrill and vibration of the great central
                  nerves which used to indicate the approach of those phenomena, and, looking up, I
                  saw distinctly my father, exactly as I used to see him, standing between the<pb
                     n="412-413" xml:id="VAC7953-00000211"/> door and the bed. It seemed to me that
                  he entered by passing through the door, but there he was, every line and lineament
                  of his face, every curl of his hair, exactly as I remembered it. His eyes were
                  fixed on mine with a tender human radiance. There was something soft and
                  compassionate about the look he gave me, and I felt it vibrating on my nerves with
                  that peculiar electric thrill of which I have spoken. I learned by such interviews
                  as these how spirits can communicate with one another without human language.</p>
               <p>The appearance of my father was vivid and real even to the clothing that he used
                  to wear, which was earthly and home-like, precisely as I remembered it. Yet I felt
                  no disposition to address him, and no need of words. Gradually the image faded; it
                  grew thinner and fainter, and I saw the door through it as if it had been a veil,
                  and then it passed away entirely.</p>
               <p>What are these apparitions? I know that this will be read by many who have seen
                  them quite as plainly as I have, who, like me, have hushed back the memory of them
                  into the most secret and silent chamber of their hearts.</p>
               <p>I know, with regard to myself, that the sight of my father was accompanied by such
                  a vivid conviction of the reality of his presence, such an assurance radiated from
                  his serene eyes that he had at last found the secret of eternal peace, such an
                  intense conviction of continued watchful affection and of sympathy in the course
                  that I was now beginning, that I could not have doubted if I would. And when we
                  remember that, from the beginning of the world, some such possible communication
                  between departed love and the beloved on earth has been among the most cherished
                  legends of humanity, why must we always meet such phenomena with a resolute
                  determination to account for them by every or any supposition but that which the
                  human heart most craves? Is not the great mystery of life and death made more
                  cruel and inexorable by this rigid incredulity? One would fancy, to hear some
                  moderns talk, that there was no possibility that the departed, even when most
                  tender and most earnest, could, if they would, recall themselves to their earthly
                  friends.</p>
               <p>For my part, it was through some such experiences as these that I learned that
                  there are truths of the spiritual life which are intuitive, and above logic, which
                  a man must believe because he cannot help it,—just as he believes the facts of his
                  daily experience in the world of matter, though most ingenious and unanswerable
                  treatises have been written to show that there is no proof of its existence.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE JOURNEY TO CLOUDLAND.</head>
               <p>THE next morning Aunt Lois rapped at our door, when there was the very faintest
                  red streak in the east, and the birds were just in the midst of that vociferous
                  singing which nobody knows anything about who is n't awake at this precise hour.
                  We were forward enough to be up and dressed, and, before our breakfast was
                  through, Uncle Jacob came to the door.</p>
               <p>The agricultural population of Massachusetts, at this time, were a far more steady
                  set as regards locomotion than they are in these days of railroads. At this time,
                  a journey from Boston to New York took a fortnight,—a longer time than it now
                  takes to go to Europe,—and my Uncle Jacob had never been even to Boston. In fact,
                  the seven-mile tavern in the neighborhood had been the extent of his wanderings,
                  and it was evident that he regarded the two days' journey as quite a solemn event
                  in his life. He had given a fortnight's thought to it; he had arranged all his
                  worldly affairs, and given charges and messages to his wife and children, in case,
                  as he said, "anything should happen to him." And he informed Aunt Lois that he had
                  been awake the biggest part of the night thinking it over. But when he had taken
                  Tina and her little trunk on board, and we had finished all our hand-shakings, and
                  Polly had told us over for the fourth or fifth time exactly where she had put the
                  cold chicken and the biscuits and the cakes and pie, and Miss Mehitable had
                  cautioned Tina again and again to put on her shawl in case a shower should come
                  up, and my grandmother and Aunt Lois had put in their share of parting
                  admonitions, we at last trolled off as cheery and merry a set of youngsters as the
                  sun ever looked upon in a dewy June morning.</p>
               <p>Our road lay first along the beautiful brown river, with its sweeping bends, and
                  its prattling curves of water dashing and chattering over mossy rocks. Towards
                  noon we began to find ourselves winding up and up amid hemlock forests, whose
                  solemn shadows were all radiant and aglow with clouds of blossoming laurel. We had
                  long hills to wind up, when we got out and walked, and gathered flowers, and
                  scampered, and chased the brook up stream from one little dashing waterfall to
                  another, and then, suddenly darting out upon the road again, we would meet the
                  wagon at the top of the hill.</p>
               <p>Can there be anything on earth so beautiful as these mountain rides in New
                  England? At any rate we were full in the faith that there could not. When we were
                  riding in the wagon, Tina's powers of entertainment were brought into full play.
                  The great success of the morning was her exact imitation of a squirrel eating a
                  nut, which she was requested to perform many times, and which she did, with
                  variations, until at last Uncle Jacob remarked, with a grin, that "if he should
                  meet her and a squirrel sitting on a stone fence together, he believed he should
                  n't know which was which."</p>
               <p>Besides this, we acted various impromptu plays, assuming characters and supporting
                  them as we had been accustomed to do in our theatrical rehearsals in the garret,
                  till Uncle Jacob declared that he never did see such a musical set as we were.
                  About nightfall we came to Uncle Sim Geary's tavern, which had been fixed upon for
                  our stopping-place. This was neither more nor less than a mountain farm-house,
                  where the few travellers who ever passed that way could find accommodation.</p>
               <p>Uncle Jacob, after seeing to his horses, and partaking of a plentiful supper, went
                  immediately to bed, as was his innocent custom every evening, as speedily as
                  possible. To bed, but not to sleep, for when, an hour or two afterward, I had
                  occasion to go into his room, I found him lying on his bed with his clothes on,
                  his shoes merely slipped off, and his hat held securely over the pit of his
                  stomach.</p>
               <p>"Why, Uncle Jacob," said I, "are n't you going to bed?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I guess I 'll just lie down as I be; no knowin' what may happen when you
                  're travelling. It 's a very nice house, and a very respectable family, but it 's
                  best always to be prepared for<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC7953-00000213"/> anything
                  that may happen. So I think you children had better all go to bed and keep
                  quiet."</p>
               <p>What roars of laughter there were among us when I described this scene and
                  communicated the message of Uncle Jacob! It seemed as if Tina could not be got to
                  sleep that night, and we could hear her giggling, through the board partition that
                  separated our room from hers, every hour of the night.</p>
               <p>Happy are the days when one can go to sleep and wake up laughing. The next
                  morning, however, Uncle Jacob reaped the reward of his vigilance by finding
                  himself ready dressed at six o'clock, when I came in and found him sleeping
                  profoundly. The fact was, that, having kept awake till near morning, he was
                  sounder asleep at this point of time than any of us, and was snoring away like a
                  grist-mill. He remarked that he should n't wonder if he had dropped asleep, and
                  added, in a solemn tone, "We 've got through the night wonderfully, all things
                  considered."</p>
               <p>The next day's ride was the same thing over, only the hills were longer; and by
                  and by we came into great vistas of mountains, whose cloudy purple heads seemed to
                  stretch and veer around our path like the phantasmagoria of a dream. Sometimes the
                  road seemed to come straight up against an impenetrable wall, and we would wonder
                  what we were to do with it; but lo! as we approached, the old mountain seemed
                  gracefully to slide aside, and open to us a passage round it. Tina found ever so
                  many moralities and poetical images in these mountains. It was like life, she
                  said. Your way would seem all shut up before you, but, if you only had faith and
                  went on, the mountains would move aside for you and let you through.</p>
               <p>Towards night we began to pull in earnest up a series of ascents toward the little
                  village of Cloudland. Hill after hill, hill after hill, how long they seemed! but
                  how beautiful it was when the sun went down over the distant valleys! and there
                  was such a pomp and glory of golden clouds and rosy vapors wreathing around the
                  old mountain-tops as one must go to Cloudland to know anything about.</p>
               <p>At last we came to a little terrace of land, where were a white meeting-house, and
                  a store, and two or three houses, and to the door of one of these our wagon drove.
                  There stood Mr. Jonathan Rossiter and the minister and Esther. You do not know
                  Esther, do you? neither at this minute did we. We saw a tall, straight, graceful
                  girl, who looked at us out of a pair of keen, clear, hazel eyes, with a sort of
                  inquisitive yet not unkindly glance, but as if she meant to make up her mind about
                  us; and when she looked at Tina I could see that her mind was made up in a
                  moment.</p>

                     <dateline>"CLOUDLAND, June 6.</dateline>
                  </opener>
                  <p>"Here we are, dear Aunty, up in the skies, in the most beautiful place that you
                     can possibly conceive of. We had such a good time coming! you 've no idea of
                     the fun we had. You know I am going to be very sober, but I did n't think it
                     was necessary to begin while we were travelling, and we kept Uncle Jacob
                     laughing so that I really think he must have been tired.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know, Aunty, I have got so that I can look exactly like a squirrel? We
                     saw ever so many on the way, and I got a great many new hints on the subject,
                     and now I can do squirrel in four or five different attitudes, and the boys
                     almost killed themselves laughing.</p>
                  <p>"Harry is an old sly-boots. Do you know, he is just as much of a mimic as I am,
                     for all he looks so sober; but when we get him a going he is perfectly killing.
                     He and I and Horace acted all sorts of plays on the way. We agreed with each
                     other that we 'd give a set of Oldtown representations, and see if Uncle Jacob
                     would know who they were, and so Harry was Sam Lawson and I was Hepsy, and I
                     made an unexceptionable baby out of our two shawls, and Horace was Uncle
                     Fliakim come in to give us moral exhortations. I do wish you could hear how we
                     did it. Uncle Jacob is n't the brightest of all mortals, and not very easily
                     roused, but we made him laugh till he said his sides were sore; and to pay for
                     it he made us laugh when we got to the tavern where we stopped all night. Do
                     you believe, Aunty, Uncle Jacob really was frightened, or care-worn, or
                        something,<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC7953-00000214"/> so that he hardly
                     slept any all night? It was just the quietest place that ever you saw, and
                     there was a good motherly woman, who got us the nicest kind of supper, and a
                     peaceable, slow, dull old man, just like Uncle Jacob. There was n't the least
                     thing that looked as if we had fallen into a cave of banditti, or a castle in
                     the Apennines, such as Mrs. Radcliffe tells about in the Mysteries of Udolpho;
                     but, for all that, Uncle Jacob's mind was so oppressed with care that he went
                     to bed with all his clothes on, and lay broad awake with his hat in his hand
                     all night. I did n't think before that Uncle Jacob had such a brilliant
                     imagination. Poor man! I should have thought he would have lain down and slept
                     as peaceably as one of his own oxen.</p>
                  <p>"We got up into Cloudland about half past six o'clock in the afternoon, the
                     second day; and such a sunset! I thought of a good subject for a little poem,
                     and wrote two or three verses, which I 'll send you some time; but I must tell
                     you now about the people here.</p>
                  <p>"I don't doubt I shall become very good, for just think what a place I am
                     in,—living at the minister's! and then I room with Esther! You ought to see
                     Esther. She 's a beautiful girl; she 's tall, and straight, and graceful, with
                     smooth black hair, and piercing dark eyes that look as if they could read your
                     very soul. Her face has the features of a statue, at least such as I think some
                     of the beautiful statues that I 've read about might have; and what makes it
                     more statuesque is, that she 's so very pale; she is perfectly healthy, but
                     there does n't seem to be any red blood in her cheeks; and, dear Aunty, she is
                     alarmingly good. She knows so much, and does so much, that it is really
                     discouraging to me to think of it. Why, do you know, she has read through
                     Virgil, and is reading a Greek tragedy now with Mr. Rossiter; and she teaches a
                     class in mathematics in school, besides being her father's only housekeeper,
                     and taking care of her younger brothers.</p>
                  <p>"I should be frightened to death at so much goodness, if it were not that she
                     seems to have taken the greatest possible fancy to me. As I told you, we room
                     together; and such a nice room as it is! everything is just like wax; and she
                     gave me half of everything,—half the drawers and half the closet, and put all
                     my things so nicely in their places, and then in the morning she gets up at
                     unheard-of hours, and she was beginning to pet me and tell me that I need n't
                     get up. Now you know, Aunty, that 's just the way people are always doing with
                     me, and the way poor dear old Polly would spoil me; but I told Esther all about
                     my new resolutions and exactly how good I intended to be, and that I thought I
                     could n't do better than to do everything that she did, and so when she gets up
                     I get up; and really, Aunty, you 've no idea what a sight the sunrise is here
                     in the mountains; it really is worth getting up for.</p>
                  <p>"We have breakfast at six o'clock, and then there are about three hours before
                     school, and I help Esther wash up the breakfast things, and we make our bed and
                     sweep our room, and put everything up nice, and then I have ever so long to
                     study, while Esther is seeing to all her family cares and directing black Dinah
                     about the dinner, and settling any little cases that may arise among her three
                     younger brothers. They are great, strong, nice boys, with bright red cheeks,
                     and a good capacity for making a noise, but she manages them nicely. Dear
                     Aunty, I hope some of her virtues will rub off on to me by contact; don't
                     you?</p>
                  <p>"I don't think your brother likes me much. He hardly noticed me at all when I
                     was first presented to him, and seemed to have forgotten that he had ever seen
                     me. I tried to talk to him, but he cut me quite short, and turned round and
                     went to talking to Mr. Avery, the minister, you know. I think that these people
                     that know so much might be civil to us little folks, but then I dare say it 's
                     all right enough; but sometimes it does seem as if he wanted to snub me. Well,
                     perhaps it 's good for me to be snubbed: I have such good times generally that
                     I ought to have something that is n't quite so pleasant.</p>
                  <p>"Life is to me such a beautiful story! and every morning when I open my eyes
                     and see things looking so charming as they do here, I thank God that I am
                     alive.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Rossiter has been examining the boys in their studies. He is n't a man
                     that ever praises anybody, I suppose, but I can see that he is pretty well
                     pleased with them. We have a lady<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC7953-00000215"/>
                     principal, Miss Titcomb. She is about forty years old, I should think, and very
                     pleasant and affable. I shall tell you more about these things by and by.</p>
                  <p>"Give my love to dear old Polly, and to grandma and Aunt Lois, and all the nice
                     folks in Oldtown.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Aunty, sometimes I used to think that you were depressed, and had
                     troubles that you did not tell me; and something you said once about your life
                     being so wintry made me quite sad. Do let me be your little Spring, and think
                     always how dearly I love you, and how good I am going to try to be for your
                     sake.</p>

               <p>THE academy in Cloudland was one of those pure wells from which the hidden
                  strength of New England is drawn, as her broad rivers are made from hidden
                  mountain brooks. The first object of every colony in New England, after building
                  the church, was to establish a school-house; and a class of the most superior men
                  of New England, in those days of simple living, were perfectly satisfied to make
                  it the business of their lives to teach in the small country academies with which
                  the nooks and hollows of New England were filled.</p>
               <p>Could materials be got as profuse as Boswell's Life of Johnson to illustrate the
                  daily life and table-talk of some of the academy schoolmasters of this period, it
                  would be an acquisition for the world.</p>
               <p>For that simple, pastoral germ-state of society is a thing forever gone. Never
                  again shall we see that union of perfect repose in regard to outward surroundings
                  and outward life with that intense activity of the inward and intellectual world,
                  that made New England, at this time, the vigorous, germinating seed-bed for all
                  that has since been developed of politics, laws, letters, and theology, through
                  New England to America, and through America to the world. The hurry of railroads,
                  and the rush and roar of business that now fill it, would have prevented that
                  germinating process. It was necessary that there should be a period like that we
                  describe, when villages were each a separate little democracy, shut off by rough
                  roads and forests from the rest of the world, organized round the church and
                  school as a common centre, and formed by the minister and the schoolmaster.</p>
               <p>The academy of Cloudland had become celebrated in the neighborhood for the skill
                  and ability with which it was conducted, and pupils had been drawn, even from as
                  far as Boston,<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC7953-00000216"/> to come and sojourn in
                  our mountain town to partake of these advantages. They were mostly young girls,
                  who were boarded at very simple rates in the various families of the place. In
                  all, the pupils of the academy numbered about a hundred, equally divided between
                  the two sexes. There was a class of about fifteen young men who were preparing for
                  college, and a greater number of boys who were studying with the same ultimate
                  hope.</p>
               <p>As a general rule, the country academies of Massachusetts have been equally open
                  to both sexes. Andover and Exeter, so far as I know, formed the only exceptions to
                  this rule, being by their charters confined rigorously to the use of the dominant
                  sex. But, in the generality of country academies, the girls and boys studied side
                  by side, without any other restriction as to the character of their studies than
                  personal preference. As a general thing, the classics and the higher mathematics
                  were more pursued by the boys than the girls. But if there were a daughter of Eve
                  who wished, like her mother, to put forth her hand to the tree of knowledge, there
                  was neither cherubim nor flaming sword to drive her away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rossiter was always stimulating the female part of his subjects to such
                  undertakings, and the consequence was that in his school an unusual number devoted
                  themselves to these pursuits, and the leading scholar in Greek and the higher
                  mathematics was our new acquaintance, Esther Avery.</p>
               <p>The female principal, Miss Titcomb, was a thorough-bred, old-fashioned lady, whose
                  views of education were formed by Miss Hannah More, and whose style, like Miss
                  Hannah More's, was profoundly Johnsonian. This lady had composed a set of rules
                  for the conduct of the school, in the most ornate and resounding periods. The
                  rules, briefly epitomized, required of us <emph>only</emph> absolute moral
                  perfection, but they were run into details which caused the reading of them to
                  take up about a quarter of an hour every Saturday morning. I would that I could
                  remember some of the sentences. It was required of us all, for one thing, that we
                  should be perfectly polite. "Persons truly polite," it was added, "invariably
                  treat their superiors with reverence, their equals with exact consideration, and
                  their inferiors with condescension." Again, under the head of manners, we were
                  warned, "not to consider romping as indicative of sprightliness, or loud laughter
                  a mark of wit."</p>
               <p>The scene every Saturday morning, when these rules were read to a set of young
                  people on whom the mountain air acted like champagne, and among whom both romping
                  and loud laughter were fearfully prevalent, was sufficiently edifying.</p>
               <p>There was also a system of marks, quite complicated, by which our departure from
                  any of these virtuous proprieties was indicated. After a while, however, the
                  reciting of these rules, like the reading of the Ten Commandments in churches, and
                  a great deal of other good substantial reading, came to be looked upon only as a
                  Saturday morning decorum, and the Johnsonian periods, which we all knew by heart,
                  were principally useful in pointing a joke. Nevertheless, we were not a badly
                  behaved set of young people.</p>
               <p>Miss Titcomb exercised a general supervision over the manners, morals, and health
                  of the young ladies connected with the institution, taught history and geography,
                  and also gave especial attention to female accomplishments. These, so far as I
                  could observe, consisted largely in embroidering mourning pieces, with a family
                  monument in the centre, a green ground worked in chenille and floss silk, with an
                  exuberant willow-tree, and a number of weeping mourners, whose faces were often
                  concealed by flowing pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Pastoral pieces were also in great favor, representing fair young shepherdesses
                  sitting on green chenille banks, with crooks in their hands, and tending some
                  animals of an uncertain description, which were to be received by faith as sheep.
                  The sweet, confiding innocence which regarded the making of objects like these as
                  more suited to the tender female character than the pursuit of Latin and
                  mathematics, was characteristic of the ancient <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >régime.</foreign> Did not Penelope embroider, and all sorts of princesses,
                  ancient and modern? and was not embroidery a true feminine grace? Even Esther
                  Avery, though she found no time for works of this kind, looked upon it with
                  respect, as<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC7953-00000217"/> an accomplishment for which
                  nature unfortunately had not given her a taste.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rossiter, although he of course would not infringe on the kingdom of his
                  female associate, treated these accomplishments with a scarce concealed contempt.
                  It was, perhaps, the frosty atmosphere of scepticism which he breathed about him
                  touching those works of art, that prevented his favorite scholars from going far
                  in the direction of such accomplishments. The fact is, that Mr. Rossiter, during
                  the sailor period of his life, had been to the Mediterranean, had seen the
                  churches of Spain and Italy, and knew what Murillos and Titians were like, which
                  may account somewhat for the glances of civil amusement which he sometimes cast
                  over into Miss Titcomb's department, when the adjuncts and accessories of a family
                  tombstone were being eagerly discussed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jonathan Rossiter held us all by the sheer force of his personal character and
                  will, just as the ancient mariner held the wedding guest with his glittering eye.
                  He so utterly scorned and contemned a lazy scholar, that trifling and inefficiency
                  in study were scorched and withered by the very breath of his nostrils. We were so
                  awfully afraid of his opinion, we so hoped for his good word and so dreaded his
                  contempt, and we so verily believed that no such man ever walked this earth, that
                  he had only to shake his ambrosial locks and give the nod, to settle us all as to
                  any matter whatever.</p>
               <p>In an age when in England schools were managed by the grossest and most brutal
                  exercise of corporal punishment, the schoolmasters of New England, to a great
                  extent, had entirely dropped all resort to such barbarous measures, and carried on
                  their schools as republics, by the sheer force of moral and intellectual
                  influences. Mr. Jonathan Rossiter would have been ashamed of himself at even the
                  suggestion of caning a boy,—as if he were incapable of any higher style of
                  government. And yet never was a man more feared and his will had in more awful
                  regard. Mr. Rossiter was sparing of praise, but his praise bore a value in
                  proportion to its scarcity. It was like diamonds and rubies,—few could have it,
                  but the whole of his little commonwealth were working for it.</p>
               <p>He scorned all conventional rules in teaching, and he would not tolerate a
                  mechanical lesson, and took delight in puzzling his pupils and breaking up all
                  routine business by startling and unexpected questions and assertions. He
                  compelled every one to think, and to think for himself. "Your heads may not be the
                  best in the world," was one of his sharp, off-hand sayings, "but they are the best
                  God has given you, and you must use them for yourselves."</p>
               <p>To tell the truth, he used his teaching somewhat as a mental gratification for
                  himself. If there was a subject he wanted to investigate, or an old Greek or Latin
                  author that he wanted to dig out, he would put a class on it, without the least
                  regard to whether it was in the course of college preparation or not, and if a
                  word was said by any poor mechanical body, he would blast out upon him with a sort
                  of despotic scorn.</p>
               <p>"Learn to read Greek perfectly," he said, "and it 's no matter what you read"; or,
                  "Learn to use your own heads, and you can learn anything."</p>
               <p>There was little idling and no shirking in his school, but a slow, dull,
                  industrious fellow, if he showed a disposition to work steadily, got more notice
                  from him than even a bright one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rossiter kept house by himself in a small cottage adjoining that of the
                  minister. His housekeeper, Miss Minerva Randall, generally known to the village as
                  "Miss Nervy Randall," was one of those preternaturally well-informed old mermaids
                  who, so far as I know, are a peculiar product of the State of Maine. Study and
                  work had been the two passions of her life, and in neither could she be excelled
                  by man or woman. Single-handed, and without a servant, she performed all the
                  labors of Mr. Jonathan Rossiter's little establishment. She washed for him, ironed
                  for him, plaited his ruffled shirts in neatest folds, brushed his clothes, cooked
                  his food, occasionally hoed in the garden, trained flowers around the house, and
                  found, also, time to read Greek and Latin authors, and to work out problems in
                  mathematics and surveying and navigation, and to take charge of boys in reading
                  Virgil.</p>
               <p>Miss Minerva Randall was one of those female persons who<pb n="426-427"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000218"/> are of Sojourner Truth's opinion,—that if women
                  want any rights they had better take them, and say nothing about it. Her
                     <emph>sex</emph> had never occurred to her as a reason for doing or not doing
                  anything which her hand found to do. In the earlier part of her life, for the mere
                  love of roving and improving her mind by seeing foreign countries, she had gone on
                  a Mediterranean voyage with her brother Zachariah Randall, who was wont to say of
                  her that she was a better mate than any man he could find. And true enough, when
                  he was confined to his berth with a fever, Miss Minerva not only nursed him, but
                  navigated the ship home in the most matter-of-fact way in the world. She had no
                  fol-de-rol about woman's rights, but she was always wide-awake to perceive when a
                  thing was to be done, and to do it. Nor did she ever after in her life talk of
                  this exploit as a thing to be boasted of, seeming to regard it as a matter too
                  simple, and entirely in the natural course of things, to be mentioned. Miss
                  Minerva, however, had not enough of the external illusive charms of her sex, to
                  suggest to a casual spectator any doubt on that score of the propriety of her
                  doing or not doing anything. Although she had not precisely the air of a man, she
                  had very little of what usually suggests the associations of femininity. There was
                  a sort of fishy quaintness about her that awakened grim ideas of some unknown
                  ocean product,—a wild and withered appearance, like a wind-blown juniper on a sea
                  promontory,—unsightly and stunted, yet not, after all, commonplace or vulgar. She
                  was short, square, and broad, and the circumference of her waist was if anything
                  greater where that of other females decreases. What the color of her hair might
                  have been in days of youthful bloom was not apparent; but she had, when we knew
                  her, thin tresses of a pepper-and-salt mixture of tint, combed tightly, and
                  twisted in a very small nut on the back of her head, and fastened with a
                  reddish-yellowish horn comb. Her small black eyes were overhung by a grizzled
                  thicket of the same mixed color as her hair. For the graces of the toilet, Miss
                  Nervy had no particular esteem. Her clothing and her person, as well as her
                  housekeeping and belongings, were of a scrupulous and wholesome neatness; but the
                  idea of any other beauty than that of utility had never suggested itself to her
                  mind. She wore always a stuff petticoat of her own spinning, with a striped linen
                  short gown, and probably in all her life never expended twenty dollars a year for
                  clothing; and yet Miss Nervy was about the happiest female person whose
                  acquaintance it has ever been my fortune to make. She had just as much as she
                  wanted of exactly the two things she liked best in the world,—books and work, and
                  when her work was done, there were the books, and life could give no more. Miss
                  Nervy had no sentiment,—not a particle of romance,—she was the most perfectly
                  contented mortal that could possibly be imagined. As to station and position, she
                  was as well known and highly respected in Cloudland as the schoolmaster himself:
                  she was one of the fixed facts of the town, as much as the meeting-house. Days
                  came and went, and spring flowers and autumn leaves succeeded each other, and boys
                  and girls, like the spring flowers and autumn leaves, came and went in Cloudland
                  Academy, but there was always Miss Nervy Randall, not a bit older, not a bit
                  changed, doing her spinning and her herb-drying, working over her butter and
                  plaiting Mr. Jonathan's ruffled shirts and teaching her Virgil class. What gave a
                  piquancy to Miss Nervy's discourse was, that she always clung persistently to the
                  racy Yankee dialect of her childhood, and when she was discoursing of Latin and
                  the classics the idioms made a droll mixture. She was the most invariably
                  good-natured of mortals, and helpful to the last degree; and she would always stop
                  her kitchen work, take her hands out of the bread, or turn away from her yeast in
                  a critical moment, to show a puzzled boy the way through a hard Latin
                  sentence.</p>
               <p>"Why, don't you know what that 'ere is?" she would say. "That 'ere is part of the
                  gerund in <emph>dum;</emph> you 've got to decline it, and then you 'll find it.
                  Look here!" she 'd say; "run that 'ere through the moods an' tenses, and ye 'll
                  git it in the subjunctive"; or, "Massy, child! that 'ere is one o' the deponent
                  verbs. 'T ain't got any active form; them deponent verbs allus does trouble boys
                  till they git used to 'em."</p>
               <p>Now these provincialisms might have excited the risibles of so keen a set of
                  grammarians as we were, only that Miss Randall<pb n="428-429"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000219"/> was a dead shot in any case of difficulty presented
                  by the learned languages. No matter how her English phrased it, she had taught so
                  many boys that she knew every hard rub and difficult stepping-stone and tight
                  place in the Latin grammar by heart, and had relief at her tongue's end for any
                  distressed beginner.</p>
               <p>In the cottage over which Miss Randall presided, Harry and I had our room, and we
                  were boarded at the master's table; and so far we were fortunate. Our apartment,
                  which was a roof-room of a gambrel-roofed cottage, was, to be sure, unplastered
                  and carpetless; but it looked out through the boughs of a great apple-tree, up a
                  most bewildering blue vista of mountains, whence the sight of a sunset was
                  something forever to be remembered. All our physical appointments, though
                  rustically plain, were kept by Miss Nervy in the utmost perfection of neatness.
                  She had as great a passion for soap and sand as she had for Greek roots, and
                  probably for the same reason. These wild sea-coast countries seemed to produce a
                  sort of superfluity of energy which longed to wreak itself on something, and
                  delighted in digging and delving mentally as well as physically.</p>
               <p>Our table had a pastoral perfection in the articles of bread and butter, with
                  honey furnished by Miss Minerva's bees, and game and fish brought in by the united
                  woodcraft of the minister and Mr. Rossiter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rossiter pursued all the natural sciences with an industry and enthusiasm only
                  possible to a man who lives in so lonely and retired a place as Cloudland, and who
                  has, therefore, none of the thousand dissipations of time resulting from our
                  modern system of intercommunication, which is fast producing a state of shallow
                  and superficial knowledge. He had a ponderous herbarium, of some forty or fifty
                  folios, of his own collection and arrangement, over which he gloated with
                  affectionate pride. He had a fine mineralogical cabinet; and there was scarcely a
                  ledge of rocks within a circuit of twelve miles that had not resounded to the tap
                  of his stone hammer and furnished specimens for his collection; and he had an
                  entomologic collection, where luckless bugs impaled on steel pins stuck in thin
                  sheets of cork struggled away a melancholy existence, martyrs to the taste for
                  science. The tender-hearted among us sometimes ventured a remonstrance in favor of
                  these hapless beetles, but were silenced by the authoritative dictum of Mr.
                  Rossiter. "Insects," he declared, "are unsusceptible of pain, the structure of
                  their nervous organization forbidding the idea, and their spasmodic action being
                  simply nervous contraction." As nobody has ever been inside of a beetle to certify
                  to the contrary, and as the race have no mode of communication, we all found it
                  comfortable to put implicit faith in Mr. Rossiter's statements till better
                  advised.</p>
               <p>It was among the awe-inspiring legends that were current of Mr. Rossiter in the
                  school, that he corresponded with learned men in Norway and Sweden, Switzerland
                  and France, to whom he sent specimens of American plants and minerals and insects,
                  receiving in return those of other countries. Even in that remote day, little New
                  England had her eyes and her thoughts and her hands everywhere where ship could
                  sail.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rossiter dearly loved to talk and to teach, and out of school-hours it was his
                  delight to sit surrounded by his disciples, to answer their questions, and show
                  them his herbarium and his cabinet, to organize woodland tramps, and to start us
                  on researches similar to his own. It was fashionable in his school to have private
                  herbariums and cabinets, and before a month was passed our garret-room began to
                  look quite like a grotto. In short, Mr. Rossiter's system resembled that of those
                  gardeners who, instead of bending all their energies toward making a handsome head
                  to a young tree, encourage it to burst out in suckers clear down to the root,
                  bringing every part of it into vigorous life and circulation.</p>
               <p>I still remember the blessed old fellow, as he used to sit among us on the steps
                  of his house, in some of those resplendent moonlight nights which used to light up
                  Cloudland like a fairy dream. There he still sits, in memory, with his court
                  around him,—Esther, with the thoughtful shadows in her eyes and the pensive Psyche
                  profile, and Tina, ever restless, changing, enthusiastic, Harry with his sly,
                  reticent humor and silent enjoyment, and he, our master, talking of everything
                  under the sun,<pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC7953-00000220"/> past, present, and to
                  come,—of the cathedrals and pictures of Europe, describing those he had not seen
                  apparently with as minute a knowledge as those he had,—of plants and animals,—of
                  the ancients and the moderns,—of theology, metaphysics, grammar, rhetoric, or
                  whatever came uppermost,—always full and suggestive, startling us with paradoxes,
                  provoking us to arguments, setting us out to run eager tilts of discussion with
                  him, yet in all holding us in a state of unmeasured admiration. Was he conscious,
                  our great man and master, of that weakness of his nature which made an audience,
                  and an admiring one, always a necessity to him? Of a soul naturally
                  self-distrustful and melancholy, he needed to be constantly reinforced and built
                  up in his own esteem by the suffrage of others. What seemed the most trenchant
                  self-assertion in him was, after all, only the desperate struggles of a drowning
                  man to keep his head above water; and, though he seemed at times to despise us
                  all, our good opinion, our worship and reverence, were the raft that kept him from
                  sinking in despair.</p>
               <p>The first few weeks that Tina was in school, it was evident that Mr. Rossiter
                  considered her as a spoiled child of fortune, whom the world had conspired to
                  injure by over-much petting. He appeared resolved at once to change the atmosphere
                  and the diet. For some time in school it seemed as if she could do nothing to
                  please him. He seemed determined to put her through a sort of Spartan drill, with
                  hard work and small praise.</p>
               <p>Tina had received from nature and womanhood that inspiration in dress and toilet
                  attraction which led her always and instinctively to some little form of personal
                  adornment. Every wild spray or fluttering vine in our woodland rambles seemed to
                  suggest to her some caprice of ornamentation. Each day she had some new thing in
                  her hair,—now a feathery fern-leaf, and anon some wild red berry, whose presence
                  just where she placed it was as picturesque as a French lithograph; and we boys
                  were in the habit of looking each day to see what she would wear next. One morning
                  she came into school, fair as Ariadne, with her viny golden curls rippling over
                  and around a crown of laurel-blossoms. She seemed to us like a little woodland
                  poem. We all looked at her, and complimented her, and she received our
                  compliments, as she always did coin of that sort, with the most undisguised and
                  radiant satisfaction. Mr. Rossiter was in one of his most savage humors this
                  morning, and eyed the pretty toilet grimly. "If you had only an equal talent for
                  ornamenting the <emph>inside</emph> of your head," he said to her, "there might be
                  some hopes of you."</p>
               <p>Tears of mortification came into Tina's eyes, as she dashed the offending
                  laurel-blossoms out of the window, and bent resolutely over her book. At
                  recess-time she strolled out with me into the pine woods back of the school-house,
                  and we sat down on a mossy log together, and I comforted her and took her
                  part.</p>
               <p>"I don't care, Horace," she said,—"I don't care!" and she dashed the tears out of
                  her eyes. "I 'll <emph>make</emph> that man like me yet,—you see if I don't. He
                  shall like me before I 'm done with him, so there! I don't care how much he
                  scolds. I 'll give in to him, and do exactly as he tells me, but I 'll conquer
                  him,—you see if I don't."</p>
               <p>And true enough Miss Tina from this time brushed her curly hair straight as such
                  rebellious curls possibly could be brushed, and dressed herself as plainly as
                  Esther, and went at study as if her life depended on it. She took all Mr.
                  Rossiter's snubs and despiteful sayings with the most prostrate humility, and now
                  we began to learn, to our astonishment, what a mind the little creature had. In
                  all my experience of human beings, I never saw one who learned so easily as she.
                  It was but a week or two after she began the Latin grammar before, jumping over
                  all the intermediate books, she alighted in a class in Virgil among scholars who
                  had been studying for a year, and kept up with them, and in some respects stood
                  clearly as the first scholar. The <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vim</foreign> with which
                  the little puss went at it, the zeal with which she turned over the big dictionary
                  and whirled the leaves of the grammar, the almost inspiration which she showed in
                  seizing the poetical shading of words over which her more prosaic companions
                  blundered, were matters of never-ending astonishment and admiration to Harry and
                  myself. At the end of the first week she gravely announced to us that she intended
                  to render Virgil into<pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC7953-00000221"/> English verse;
                  and we had not the smallest doubt that she would do it, and were so immensely
                  wrought up about it that we talked of it after we went to bed that night. Tina, in
                  fact, had produced quite a clever translation of the first ten lines of "Arma
                  virumque," &amp;c. and we wondered what Mr. Rossiter would say to it. One of us
                  stepped in and laid it on his writing-desk.</p>
               <p>"Which of you boys did this?" he said the next morning, in not a disapproving
                  tone.</p>
               <p>There was a pause, and he slowly read the lines aloud.</p>
               <p>"Pretty fair!" he said,—"pretty fair! I should n't be surprised if that boy should
                  be able to write English one of these days."</p>
               <p>"If you please, sir," said I, "it's Miss Tina Percival that wrote that."</p>
               <p>Tina's cheeks were red enough as he handed her back her poetry.</p>
               <p>"Not bad," he said,—"not bad; keep on as you 've begun, and you may come to
                  something yet."</p>
               <p>This scanty measure of approbation was interpreted as high praise, and we
                  complimented Tina on her success. The project of making a poetical translation of
                  Virgil, however, was not carried out, though every now and then she gave us little
                  jets and spurts, which kept up our courage.</p>
               <p>Bless me, how we did study everything in that school! English grammar, for
                  instance. The whole school was divided into a certain number of classes, each
                  under a leader, and at the close of every term came on a great examination, which
                  was like a tournament or passage at arms in matters of the English language. To
                  beat in this great contest of knowledge was what excited all our energies. Mr.
                  Rossiter searched out the most difficult specimens of English literature for us to
                  parse, and we were given to understand that he was laying up all the most abstruse
                  problems of grammar to propound to us. All that might be raked out from the coarse
                  print and the fine print of grammar was to be brought to bear on us; and the
                  division that knew the most—the division that could not be puzzled by any
                  subtlety, that had anticipated every possible question, and was prepared with an
                  answer—would be the victorious division, and would be crowned with laurels as
                  glorious in our eyes as those of the old Olympic games. For a week we talked,
                  spoke, and dreamed of nothing but English grammar. Each division sat in solemn,
                  mysterious conclave, afraid lest one of its mighty secrets of wisdom should
                  possibly take wing and be plundered by some of the outlying scouts of another
                  division.</p>
               <p>We had for a subject Satan's address to the sun, in Milton, which in our private
                  counsels we tore limb from limb with as little remorse as the anatomist dissects a
                  once lovely human body.</p>
               <p>The town doctor was a noted linguist and grammarian, and his son was contended for
                  by all the divisions, as supposed to have access to the fountain of his father's
                  wisdom on these subjects; and we were so happy in the balloting as to secure him
                  for our side. Esther was our leader, and we were all in the same division, and our
                  excitement was indescribable. We had also to manage a quotation from Otway, which
                  I remember contained the clause, "Were the world on fire." To parse "on fire" was
                  a problem which kept the eyes of the whole school waking. Each division had its
                  theory, of which it spoke mysteriously in the presence of outsiders; but we had
                  George Norton, and George had been in solemn consultation with Dr. Norton. Never
                  shall I forget the excitement as he came rushing up to our house at nine o'clock
                  at night with the last results of his father's analysis. We shut the doors and
                  shut the windows,—for who knew what of the enemy might be listening?—and gathered
                  breathlessly around him, while in a low, mysterious voice he unfolded to us how to
                  parse "on fire." At that moment George Norton enjoyed the full pleasure of being a
                  distinguished individual, if he never did before or after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rossiter all this while was like the Egyptian Sphinx, perfectly unfathomable,
                  and severely resolved to sift and test us to the utmost.</p>
               <p>Ah, well! to think of the glories of the day when our division beat!—for we did
                  beat. We ran along neck and neck with Ben Baldwin's division, for Ben was an
                  accomplished grammarian, and had picked up one or two recondite pieces of
                     information<pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC7953-00000222"/> tion wherewith he
                  threatened for a time to turn our flank, but the fortunes of the field were
                  reversed when it came to the phrase "on fire," and our success was complete and
                  glorious. It was well to have this conflict over, for I don't believe that Tina
                  slept one night that week without dreams of particles and prepositions,—Tina, who
                  was as full of the enthusiasm of everything that was going on as a flossy evening
                  cloud is of light, and to whose health I really do believe a defeat might have
                  caused a serious injury.</p>
               <p>Never shall I forget Esther, radiant, grave, and resolved, as she sat in the midst
                  of her division through all the fluctuations of the contest. A little bright spot
                  had come in each of her usually pale cheeks, and her eyes glowed with a fervor
                  which showed that she had it in her to have defended a fortress, or served a
                  cannon, like the Maid of Saragossa. We could not have felt more if our division
                  had been our country and she had led us in triumph through a battle.</p>
               <p>Besides grammar, we gave great attention to rhetoric. We studied Dr. Blair with
                  the same kind of thoroughness with which we studied the English grammar. Every
                  week a division of the school was appointed to write compositions; but there was,
                  besides, a call for volunteers, and Mr. Rossiter had a smile of approbation for
                  those who volunteered to write every week; and so we were always among that
                  number.</p>
               <p>It was remarkable that the very best writers, as a general thing, were among the
                  female part of the school. There were several young men, of nineteen and twenty
                  years of age, whose education had been retarded by the necessity of earning for
                  them selves the money which was to support them while preparing for college. They
                  were not boys, they were men, and, generally speaking, men of fine minds and fine
                  characters. Some of them have since risen to distinction, and acted leading parts
                  at Washington. But, for all that, the best writers of the school, as I have before
                  said, were the girls. Nor was the standard of writing low: Mr. Rossiter had the
                  most withering scorn for ordinary sentimental nonsense and school-girl platitudes.
                  If a bit of weakly poetry got running among the scholars, he was sure to come down
                  upon it with such an absurd parody that nobody could ever recall it again without
                  a laugh.</p>
               <p>We wrote on such subjects as "The Difference between the Natural and Moral
                  Sublime," "The Comparative Merits of Milton and Shakespeare," "The Comparative
                  Merits of the Athenian and Lacedæmonian Systems of Education." Sometimes, also, we
                  wrote criticisms. If, perchance, the master picked up some verbose Fourth of July
                  oration, or some sophomorical newspaper declamation, he delivered it over to our
                  tender mercies with as little remorse as a huntsman feels in throwing a dead fox
                  to the dogs. Hard was the fate of any such composition thrown out to us. With what
                  infinite zeal we attacked it! how we riddled and shook it! how we scoffed, and
                  sneered, and jeered at it! how we exposed its limping metaphors, and hung up in
                  triumph its deficient grammar! Such a sharp set of critics we became that our
                  compositions, read to each other, went through something of an ordeal.</p>
               <p>Tina, Harry, Esther, and I were a private composition club. Many an hour have we
                  sat in the old school-room long after all the other scholars had gone, talking to
                  one another of our literary schemes. We planned poems and tragedies; we planned
                  romances that would have taken many volumes to write out; we planned arguments and
                  discussions; we gravely criticised each other's style, and read morsels of
                  projected compositions to one another.</p>
               <p>It was characteristic of the simple, earnest fearlessness of those times in regard
                  to all matters of opinion, that the hardest theological problems were sometimes
                  given out as composition subjects, and we four children not unfrequently sat
                  perched on the old high benches of the school-room during the fading twilight
                  hours, and, like Milton's fallen angels,— <q>

               <p>Esther, Harry, and I were reading the "Prometheus Bound" with Mr. Rossiter. It was
                  one of his literary diversions, into<pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC7953-00000223"/>
                  which he carried us; and the Calvinism of the old Greek tragedian mingling with
                  the Calvinism of the pulpit and of modern New England life, formed a curious
                  admixture in our thoughts.</p>
               <p>Tina insisted on reading this with us, just as of old she insisted on being
                  carried in a lady chair over to our woodland study in the island. She had begun
                  Greek with great zeal under Mr. Rossiter, but of course was in no situation to
                  venture upon any such heights; but she insisted upon always being with us when we
                  were digging out our lesson, and in fact, when we were talking over doubtfully the
                  meaning of a passage, would irradiate it with such a flood of happy conjecture as
                  ought to have softened the stern facts of moods and tenses, and <emph>made</emph>
                  itself the meaning. She rendered some parts of it into verse much better than any
                  of us could have done it, and her versifications, laid on Mr. Rossiter's desk,
                  called out a commendation that was no small triumph to her.</p>
               <p>"My forte lies in picking knowledge out of other folks and using it," said Tina,
                  joyously. "Out of the least bit of ore that you dig up, I can make no end of
                  gold-leaf!" O Tina, Tina, you never spoke a truer word, and while you were with us
                  you made everything glitter with your "no end of gold-leaf."</p>
               <p>It may seem to some impossible that, at so early an age as ours, our minds should
                  have striven with subjects such as have been indicated here; but let it be
                  remembered that these problems are to every human individual a part of an unknown
                  tragedy in which he is to play the rôle either of the conqueror or the victim. A
                  ritualistic church, which places all souls under the guardianship of a priesthood,
                  of course shuts all these doors of discussion so far as the individual is
                  concerned. "The Church" is a great ship, where you have only to buy your ticket
                  and pay for it, and the rest is none of your concern. But the New England system,
                  as taught at this time, put on every human being the necessity of crossing the
                  shoreless ocean alone on his own raft; and many a New England child of ten or
                  twelve years of age, or even younger, has trembled at the possibilities of final
                  election or reprobation.</p>
               <p>I remember well that at one time the composition subject given out at school was,
                  "Can the Benevolence of the Deity be proved by the Light of Nature?" Mr. Rossiter
                  generally gave out the subject, and discussed it with the school in an animated
                  conversation, stirring up all the thinking matter that there was among us by
                  vigorous questions, and by arguing before us first on one side and then on the
                  other, until our minds were strongly excited about it; and, when he had wrought up
                  the whole school to an intense interest, he called for volunteers to write on
                  either side. Many of these compositions were full of vigor and thought; two of
                  those on the above-mentioned subject were very striking. Harry took the
                  affirmative ground, and gave a statement of the argument, so lucid, and in
                  language so beautiful, that it has remained fixed in my mind like a gem ever
                  since. It was the statement of a nature harmonious and confiding, naturally prone
                  to faith in goodness, harmonizing and presenting all those evidences of
                  tenderness, mercy, and thoughtful care which are furnished in the workings of
                  natural laws. The other composition was by Esther; it was on the other and darker
                  side of the subject, and as perfect a match for it as the "Penseroso" to the
                  "Allegro." It was condensed and logical, fearfully vigorous in conception and
                  expression, and altogether a very melancholy piece of literature to have been
                  conceived and written by a girl of her age. It spoke of that fearful law of
                  existence by which the sins of parents who often themselves escape punishment are
                  visited on the heads of innocent children, as a law which seems made specifically
                  to protect and continue the existence of vice and disorder from generation to
                  generation. It spoke of the apparent injustice of an arrangement by which human
                  beings, in the very outset of their career in life, often inherit almost
                  uncontrollable propensities to evil. The sorrows, the perplexities, the unregarded
                  wants and aspirations, over which the unsympathetic laws of nature cut their way
                  regardless of quivering nerve or muscle, were all bitterly dwelt upon. The
                  sufferings of dumb animals, and of helpless infant children, apparently so useless
                  and so needless, and certainly so undeserved, were also energetically mentioned.
                  There was a bitter intensity in the style that was most painful. In short, the
                     two<pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC7953-00000224"/> compositions were two perfect
                  pictures of the world and life as they appear to two classes of minds. I remember
                  looking at Esther while her composition was read, and being struck with the
                  expression of her face,—so pale, so calm, so almost hopeless,—its expression was
                  very like despair. I remember that Harry noticed it as well as I, and when school
                  was over he took a long and lonely ramble with her, and from that time a nearer
                  intimacy arose between them.</p>
               <p>Esther was one of those intense, silent, repressed women that have been a frequent
                  outgrowth of New England society. Moral traits, like physical ones, often
                  intensify themselves in course of descent, so that the child of a long line of
                  pious ancestry may sometimes suffer from too fine a moral fibre, and become a
                  victim to a species of morbid <emph>spiritual ideality.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Esther looked to me, from the first, less like a warm, breathing, impulsive woman,
                  less like ordinary flesh and blood, than some half-spiritual organization, every
                  particle of which was a thought.</p>
               <p>Old Dr. Donne says of such a woman, "One might almost say her body thought"; and
                  it often came in my mind when I watched the movements of intense yet repressed
                  intellect and emotion in Esther's face.</p>
               <p>With many New England women at this particular period, when life was so retired
                  and so cut off from outward sources of excitement, <emph>thinking</emph> grew to
                  be a disease. The great subject of thought was, of course, theology; and woman's
                  nature has never been consulted in theology. Theologic systems, as to the
                  expression of their great body of ideas, have, as yet, been the work of man alone.
                  They have had their origin, as in St. Augustine, with men who were utterly
                  ignorant of moral and intellectual companionship with woman, looking on her only
                  in her animal nature as a temptation and a snare. Consequently, when, as in this
                  period of New England, the theology of Augustine began to be freely discussed by
                  every individual in society, it was the women who found it hardest to tolerate or
                  to assimilate it, and many a delicate and sensitive nature was utterly wrecked in
                  the struggle.</p>
               <p>Plato says somewhere that the only perfect human thinker and philosopher who will
                  ever arise will be the MAN-WOMAN, or a human being who unites perfectly the nature
                  of the two sexes. It was Esther's misfortune to have, to a certain degree, this
                  very conformation. From a long line of reasoning, thinking, intellectual ancestry
                  she had inherited all the strong logical faculties, and the tastes and
                  inclinations for purely intellectual modes of viewing things, which are supposed
                  to be more particularly the characteristic of man. From a line of saintly and
                  tender women, half refined to angel in their nature, she had inherited exquisite
                  moral perceptions, and all that flattering host of tremulous, half-spiritual,
                  half-sensuous intuitions that lie in the borderland between the pure intellect and
                  the animal nature. The consequence of all this was the internal strife of a
                  divided nature. Her heart was always rebelling against the conclusions of her
                  head. She was constantly being forced by one half of her nature to movements,
                  inquiries, and reasonings which brought only torture to the other half.</p>
               <p>Esther had no capacity for illusions; and in this respect her constitution was an
                  unfortunate one.</p>
               <p>Tina, for example, was one of those happily organized human beings in whom an
                  intellectual proposition, fully assented to, might lie all her life dormant as the
                  wheat-seed which remained thousands of years ungerminate in the wrappings of a
                  mummy. She thought only of what she liked to think of; and a disagreeable or
                  painful truth in her mind dropped at once out of sight,—it sank into the ground
                  and roses grew over it.</p>
               <p>Esther never could have made one of those clinging, submissive, parasitical wives
                  who form the delight of song and story, and are supposed to be the peculiar gems
                  of womanhood. It was her nature always to be obliged to see her friends clearly
                  through the understanding, and to judge them by a refined and exquisite
                  conscientiousness. A spot or stain on the honor of the most beloved could never
                  have become invisible to her. She had none of that soft, blinding, social
                  aura,—that blending, blue haze, such as softens the sharp outlines of an Italian
                  landscape, and in life changes the hardness of reality into illusive and
                     charming<pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC7953-00000225"/> possibilities. Her clear,
                  piercing hazel eyes seemed to pass over everything with a determination to know
                  only and exactly the truth, hard and cold and unwelcome though it might be.</p>
               <p>Yet there is no doubt that the warm, sunny, showery, rainbow nature of Tina acted
                  as a constant and favorable alterative upon her. It was a daily living poem acting
                  on the unused poetical and imaginative part of her own nature; for Esther had a
                  suppressed vigor of imagination, and a passionate capability of emotion, stronger
                  and more intense than that of Tina herself.</p>
               <p>I remarked this to Harry, as we were talking about them one day. "Both have
                  poetical natures," I said; "both are intense; but how different they are!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Harry, "Tina's is electricity, and that snaps and sparkles and
                  flashes; Esther's is galvanism, that comes in long, intense waves, and shakes and
                  convulses; she both thinks and feels too much on all subjects."</p>
               <p>"That was a very strange composition," I said.</p>
               <p>"It is an unwholesome course of thought," said Harry, after thinking for a few
                  moments with his head on his hands; "none but bitter berries grow on those
                  bushes."</p>
               <p>"But the reasoning was very striking," said I.</p>
               <p>"Reasoning!" said Harry, impatiently; "we must trust the intuition of our hearts
                  above reason. That is what I am trying to persuade Esther to do. To me it is an
                  absolute demonstration, that God never could make a creature who would be
                     <emph>better</emph> than himself. We must look at the noblest, best human
                  beings. We must see what generosity, what tenderness, what magnanimity can be in
                  man and woman, and believe all that and more in God. All that there is in the best
                  fathers and best mothers <emph>must</emph> be in him."</p>
               <p>"But the world's history does not look like this, as Mr. Rossiter was saying."</p>
               <p>"We have not seen the world's history yet," said Harry. "What does this green
                  aphide, crawling over this leaf, know of the universe?"</p>

               <head type="sub">OUR MINISTER IN CLOUDLAND.</head>
               <p>THE picture of our life in Cloudland, and of the developing forces which were
                  there brought to bear upon us, would be incomplete without the portrait of the
                  minister.</p>
               <p>Even during the course of my youth, the principles of democratic equality
                  introduced and maintained in the American Revolution were greatly changing the
                  social position and standing of the clergy. Ministers like Dr. Lothrop, noble men
                  of the theocracy, men of the cocked hat, were beginning to pass away, or to appear
                  among men only as venerable antiquities, and the present order of American citizen
                  clergy was coming in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery was a cheerful, busy, manly man, who posed himself among men as a
                  companion and fellow-citizen, whose word on any subject was to go only so far as
                  its own weight and momentum should carry it. His preaching was a striking contrast
                  to the elegant Addisonian essays of Parson Lothrop. It was a vehement address to
                  our intelligent and reasoning powers,—an address made telling by a back force of
                  burning enthusiasm. Mr. Avery preached a vigorous system of mental philosophy in
                  theology, which made our Sundays, on the whole, about as intense an intellectual
                  drill as any of our week-days. If I could describe its character by any one word,
                  I should call it <emph>manly</emph> preaching.</p>
               <p>Every person has a key-note to his mind which determines all its various
                  harmonies. The key-note of Mr. Avery's mind was "the free agency of man." Free
                  agency was with him the universal solvent, the philosopher's stone in theology;
                  every line of his sermons said to every human being. "You are free, and you are
                  able." And the great object was to intensify to its highest point, in every human
                  being, the sense of individual, personal responsibility.</p>
               <pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC7953-00000226"/>
               <p>Of course, as a Calvinist, he found food for abundant discourse in reconciling
                  this absolute freedom of man with those declarations in the standards of the
                  Church which assert the absolute government of God over all his creatures and all
                  their actions. But the cheerfulness and vigor with which he drove and interpreted
                  and hammered in the most contradictory statements, when they came in the way of
                  his favorite ideas, was really quite inspiring.</p>
               <p>During the year we had a whole course of systematic theology, beginning with the
                  history of the introduction of moral evil, the fall of the angels, and the
                  consequent fall of man and the work of redemption resulting therefrom. In the
                  treatment of all these subjects, the theology and imagery of Milton figured so
                  largely that one might receive the impression that Paradise Lost was part of the
                  sacred canon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery not only preached these things in the pulpit, but talked them out in his
                  daily life. His system of theology was to him the vital breath of his being. His
                  mind was always running upon it, and all nature was, in his sight, giving daily
                  tributary illustrations to it. In his farming, gardening, hunting, or fishing, he
                  was constantly finding new and graphic forms of presenting his favorite truths.
                  The most abstract subject ceased to be abstract in his treatment of it, but became
                  clothed upon with the homely, every-day similes of common life.</p>
               <p>I have the image of the dear good man now, as I have seen him, seated on a
                  hay-cart, mending a hoe-handle, and at the same moment vehemently explaining to an
                  inquiring brother minister the exact way that Satan first came to fall, as
                  illustrating how a perfectly holy mind can be tempted to sin. The familiarity that
                  he showed with the celestial arcana,—the zeal with which he vindicated his
                  Maker,—the perfect knowledge that he seemed to have of the strategic plans of the
                  evil powers in the first great insurrection,—are traits strongly impressed on my
                  memory. They seemed as vivid and as much a matter of course to his mind as if he
                  had read them out of a weekly newspaper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery indulged the fond supposition that he had solved the great problem of
                  the origin of evil in a perfectly satisfactory manner. He was fond of the Socratic
                  method, and would clench his reasoning in a series of questions, thus:—</p>
               <p>"Has not God power to make any kind of thing he pleases?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Then he can make a kind of being incapable of being governed except by
                  motive?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Then, when he has made that kind of being, he cannot govern them except by
                  motive, can he?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Now if there is no motive in existence strong enough to govern them by, he cannot
                  keep them from falling, can he?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"You see then the necessity of moral evil; there must be experience of evil to
                  work out motive."</p>
               <p>The Calvinism of Mr. Avery, though sharp and well defined, was not dull, as
                  abstractions often are, nor gloomy and fateful like that of Dr. Stern. It was
                  permeated through and through by cheerfulness and hope.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery was one of the kind of men who have a passion for saving souls. If there
                  is such a thing as apostolic succession, this passion is what it ought to consist
                  in. It is what ought to come with the laying on of hands, if the laying on of
                  hands is what it is sometimes claimed to be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery was a firm believer in hell, but he believed also that nobody need go
                  there, and he was determined, so far as he was concerned, that nobody should go
                  there if he could help it. Such a tragedy as the loss of any one soul in his
                  parish he could not and would not contemplate for a moment; and he had such a firm
                  belief in the truths he preached, that he verily expected with them to save
                  anybody that would listen to him.</p>
               <p>Goethe says, "Blessed is the man who believes that he has an idea by which he may
                  help his fellow-creatures." Mr. Avery was exactly that man. He had such faith in
                  what he preached that he would have gone with it to Satan himself, could he have
                  secured a dispassionate and unemployed hour, with a hope of bringing him
                  round.</p>
               <pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC7953-00000227"/>
               <p>Generous and ardent in his social sympathies, Mr. Avery never could be brought to
                  believe that any particular human being had finally perished. At every funeral he
                  attended he contrived to see a ground for hope that the departed had found mercy.
                  Even the slightest hints of repentance were magnified in his warm and hopeful mode
                  of presentation. He has been known to suggest to a distracted mother, whose

               <p>Like most of the New England ministers, Mr. Avery was a warm believer in the
                  millennium. This millennium was the favorite recreation ground, solace, and
                  pasture land, where the New England ministry fed their hopes and courage. Men of
                  large hearts and warm benevolence, their theology would have filled them with
                  gloom, were it not for this overplus of joy and peace to which human society on
                  earth was in their view tending. Thousands of years, when the poor old earth
                  should produce only a saintly race of perfected human beings, were to them some
                  compensation for the darkness and losses of the great struggle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery believed, not only that the millennium was coming, but that it was
                  coming fast, and, in fact, was at the door. Every political and social change
                  announced it. Our Revolution was a long step towards it, and the French
                  Revolution, now in progress, was a part of that distress of nations which heralded
                  it; and every month, when the Columbia Magazine brought in the news from Europe,
                  Mr. Avery rushed over to Mr. Rossiter, and called him to come and hear how the
                  thing was going.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rossiter took upon himself that right which every free-born Yankee holds
                  sacred,—the right of contravening his minister. Though, if he caught one of his
                  boys swelling or ruffling with any opposing doctrine, he would scath and scorch
                  the youngster with contemptuous irony, and teach him to comport himself modestly
                  in talking of his betters, yet it was the employment of a great many of his
                  leisure hours to run argumentative tilts against Mr. Avery. Sometimes, when we
                  were sitting in our little garret window digging out the Greek lessons, such a war
                  of voices and clangor of assertion and contradiction would come up from among the
                  tassels of the corn, where the two were hoeing together in the garden, as would
                  have alarmed people less accustomed to the vigorous manners of both the
                  friends.</p>
               <p>"Now, Rossiter, that will never do. Your system would upset moral government
                  entirely. Not an angel could be kept in his place upon your supposition."</p>
               <p>"It is not my supposition. I have n't got any supposition, and I don't want any;
                  but I was telling you that, if you must have a theory of the universe, Origen's
                  was a better one than yours."</p>
               <p>"And I say that Origen's system would upset everything, and you ought to let it
                  alone."</p>
               <p>"I sha'n't let it alone."</p>
               <p>"Why, Rossiter, you will destroy responsibility, and annihilate all the motives of
                  God's government."</p>
               <p>"That's just what you theologians always say. You think the universe will go to
                  pieces if we upset your pine-shingle theology."</p>
               <p>"Rossiter, you must be careful how you spread your ideas."</p>
               <p>"I don't want to spread my ideas; I don't want to interfere with your system. It's
                  the best thing you can make your people take, but you ought to know that no system
                  is anything more than human theory."</p>
               <p>"It's eternal truth."</p>
               <p>"There's truth in it, but it is n't eternal truth."</p>
               <p>"It's Bible."</p>
               <p>"Part, and part Milton and Edwards, and part Mr. Avery."</p>
               <p>Harry and I were like adopted sons in both families, and the two expressed their
                  minds about each other freely before us. Mr. Avery would say: "The root of the
                  matter is in Rossiter. I don't doubt that he's a really regenerate man, but he has
                  a head that works strangely. We must wait for him, he'll come along by and
                  by."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Rossiter would say of Mr. Avery: "That's a growing man, boys; he has n't
                  made his terminal buds yet. Some men make them quick, like lilac-bushes. They only
                  grow a little way and stop. And some grow all the season through, like
                     locust-trees<pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC7953-00000228"/> trees. Avery is one of
                  that sort: he'll never be done thinking and growing, particularly if he has me to
                  fight him on all hands. He'll grow into different opinions on a good many
                  subjects, before he dies."</p>
               <p>It was this implied liberty of growth—the liberty to think and to judge freely
                  upon all subjects—that formed the great distinctive educational force of New
                  England life, particularly in this period of my youth. Monarchy, aristocracy, and
                  theocracy, with their peculiar trains of ideas, were passing away, and we were
                  coming within the sweep of pure republican influences, in which the
                     <emph>individual</emph> is <emph>everything.</emph> Mr. Avery's enthusiastic
                  preaching of free agency and personal responsibility was more than an
                     <emph>individual impulse.</emph> It was the voice of a man whose ideas were the
                  reflection of a period in American history. While New England theology was made by
                  loyal monarchists, it reflected monarchical ideas. The rights and immunities of
                  divine sovereignty were its favorite topics. When, as now, the government was
                  becoming settled in the hands of the common people, the freedom of the individual,
                  his absolute power of choice, and the consequent reasonableness of the duties he
                  owed to the Great Sovereign Authority, began to be the favorite subjects of the
                  pulpit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery's preaching was immensely popular. There were in Cloudland only about
                  half a dozen families of any prestige as to ancestral standing or previous wealth
                  and cultivation. The old aristocratic idea was represented only in the one street
                  that went over Cloudland Hill, where was a series of wide, cool, roomy,
                  elm-shadowed houses, set back in deep door-yards, and flanked with stately,
                  well-tended gardens. The doctor, the lawyer, the sheriff of the county, the
                  schoolmaster, and the minister, formed here a sort of nucleus; but outlying in all
                  the hills and valleys round were the mountain and valley farmers. Their houses sat
                  on high hills or sunk in deep valleys, and their flaming windows at morning and
                  evening looked through the encircling belts of forest solitudes as if to say, "We
                  are here, and we are a power." These hard-working farmers formed the body of Mr.
                  Avery's congregation. Sunday morning, when the little bell pealed out its note of
                  invitation loud and long over the forest-feathered hills, it seemed to evoke a
                  caravan of thrifty, well-filled farm-wagons, which, punctual as the village-clock
                  itself, came streaming from the east and west, the north and south. Past the
                  parsonage they streamed, with the bright cheeks and fluttering ribbons of the
                  girls, and the cheery, rubicund faces of children, and with the inevitable yellow
                  dog of the family faithfully pattering in the rear. The audience that filled the
                  rude old meeting-house every Sunday would have astonished the men who only rode
                  through the village of a week-day. For this set of shrewd, toil-hardened,
                  vigorous, full-blooded republicans I can think of no preaching more admirably
                  adapted than Mr. Avery's. It was preaching that was on the move, as their minds
                  were, and which was slowly shaping out and elaborating those new forms of
                  doctrinal statement that inevitably grow out of new forms of society. Living, as
                  these men did, a lonely, thoughtful, secluded life, without any of the thousand
                  stimulants which railroads and magazine and newspaper literature cast into our
                  existence, their two Sunday sermons were the great intellectual stimulus which
                  kept their minds bright, and they were listened to with an intense interest of
                  which the scattered and diversified state of modern society gives few examples.
                  They felt the compliment of being talked to as if they were capable of
                  understanding the very highest of subjects, and they liked it. Each hard, heroic
                  nature flashed like a flint at the grand thought of a free agency with which not
                  even their Maker would interfere. Their God himself asked to reign over them, not
                  by force, but by the free, voluntary choice of their own hearts.
                     "<emph>Choose</emph> you this day whom ye will serve. If the Lord be God, serve
                  him, and if Baal be God, serve him, was a grand appeal, fit for freemen.</p>
               <p>The reasoning on moral government, on the history of man,—the theories of the
                  universe past, present, and to come,—opened to these men a grand Miltonic poem, in
                  which their own otherwise commonplace lives shone with a solemn splendor. Without
                  churches or cathedrals or physical accessories to quicken their poetic nature,
                  their lives were redeemed only by this poetry of ideas.</p>
               <pb n="448-449" xml:id="VAC7953-00000229"/>
               <p>Calvinism is much berated in our days, but let us look at the political, social,
                  and materialistic progress of Calvinistic countries, and ask if the world is yet
                  far enough along to dispense with it altogether. Look at Spain at this hour, and
                  look back at New England at the time of which I write,—both having just finished a
                  revolution, both feeling their way along the path of national independence,—and
                  compare the Spanish peasantry with the yeomen of New England, such as made up Mr.
                  Avery's congregation;—the one set made by reasoning, active-minded Calvinism, the
                  other by pictures, statues, incense, architecture, and all the sentimental
                  paraphernalia of ritualism.</p>
               <p>If Spain had had not a single cathedral, if her Murillos had been all sunk in the
                  sea, and if she had had, for a hundred years past, a set of schoolmasters and
                  ministers working together as I have described Mr. Avery and Mr. Rossiter as
                  working, would not Spain be infinitely better off for this life at least, whether
                  there is any life to come or not? This is a point that I humbly present to the
                  consideration of society.</p>
               <p>Harry and I were often taken by Mr. Avery on his preaching tours to the distant
                  farm parishes. There was a brown school-house in this valley, and a red
                  school-house in that, and another on the hill, and so on for miles around, and Mr.
                  Avery kept a constant stream of preaching going in one or other of these every
                  evening. We liked these expeditions with him, because they were often excursions
                  amid the wildest and most romantic of the mountain scenery, and we liked them
                  furthermore because Mr. Avery was a man that made himself, for the time being,
                  companionable to every creature of human shape that was with him.</p>
               <p>With boys he was a boy,—a boy in the vigor of his animal life, his keen delight in
                  riding, hunting, fishing. With farmers he was a farmer. Brought up on a farm,
                  familiar during all his early days with its wholesome toils, he still had a
                  farmer's eye and a farmer's estimates, and the working-people felt him bone of
                  their bone, and flesh of their flesh. It used to be a saying among them, that,
                  when Mr. Avery hoed more than usual in his potato-field, the Sunday sermon was
                  sure to be better.</p>
               <p>But the best sport of all was when some of Mr. Avery's preaching tours would lead
                  up the course of a fine mountain trout-brook in the vicinity. Then sometimes Mr.
                  Rossiter, Mr. Avery, Harry, and I would put our supper in our pockets, and start
                  with the sun an hour or two high, designing to bring up at the red school-house,
                  as the weekly notice phrased it, at "early candle-lighting."</p>
               <p>A person who should accidentally meet Mr. Avery on one of these tours, never
                  having seen him before, might imagine him to be a man who had never thought or
                  dreamed of anything but catching trout all his days, he went into it with such
                     <emph>abandon.</emph> Eye, voice, hand, thought, feeling, all were concentrated
                  on trout. He seemed to have the quick perception, the rapid hand, and the
                  noiseless foot of an Indian, and the fish came to his hook as if drawn there by
                  magic. So perfectly absorbed was he that we would be obliged to jog his memory,
                  and, in fact, often to drag him away by main force, when the hour for the evening
                  lecture arrived. Then our spoils would be hid away among the bushes, and with wet
                  feet he would hurry in; but, once in, he was as completely absorbed in his work of
                  saving sinners as he had before been in his temporal fishery. He argued,
                  illustrated, stated, guarded, answered objections, looking the while from one
                  hard, keen, shrewd face to another, to see if he was being understood. The phase
                  of Calvinism shown in my grandmother's blue book had naturally enough sowed
                  through the minds of a thoughtful community hosts of doubts and queries. A great
                  part of Mr. Avery's work was to remove these doubts by substituting more rational
                  statements. It was essential that he should feel that he had made a hit somewhere,
                  said something that answered a purpose in the minds of his hearers, and helped
                  them at least a step or two on their way.</p>
               <p>After services were over, I think of him and Mr. Rossiter cheerily arguing with
                  and contradicting each other a little beyond us in the road, while Harry and I
                  compared our own notes behind. Arrived at the parsonage, there would be Tina and
                  Esther coming along the street to meet us. Tina full of careless, open, gay
                  enthusiasm, Esther with a shy and wistful welcome,<pb n="450-451"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000230"/> that said far less, and perhaps meant more. Then
                  our treasures were displayed and exulted over; the supper-table was laid, and Mr.
                  Avery, Mr. Rossiter, and we boys applied ourselves to dressing our fish; and then
                  Mr. Avery, disdaining Dinah, and, in fact, all female supervision, presided
                  himself over the frying-pan, and brought our woodland captives on the table in a
                  state worthy of a trout brook. It should have comforted the very soul of a trout
                  taken in our snares to think how much was made of him, and how perfectly Mr. Avery
                  respected his dignity, and did him justice in his cookery.</p>
               <p>We two boys were in fact domesticated as sons in the family. Although our
                  boarding-place was with the master, we were almost as much with the minister as if
                  we had been of his house-hold. We worked in his garden, we came over and sat with
                  Esther and Tina. Our windows faced their windows, so that in study hours we could
                  call to one another backward and forward, and tell where the lesson began, and
                  what the root of the verb was, or any other message that came into our heads.
                  Sometimes, of a still summer morning, while we were gravely digging at our
                  lessons, we would hear Esther in tones of expostulation at some madcap impulse of
                  Tina, and, looking across, would see her bursting out in some freak of droll
                  pantomimic performance, and then an immediate whirlwind of gayety would seize us
                  all. We would drop our dictionaries and grammars, rush together, and have a
                  general outbreak of jollity.</p>
               <p>In general, Tina was a most praiseworthy and zealous student, and these wild,
                  sudden whisks of gayety seemed only the escape-valves by which her suppressed
                  spirits vented themselves; but, when they came, they were perfectly irresistible.
                  She devoted herself to Esther with that sympathetic adaptation which seemed to
                  give her power over every nature. She was interested in her housekeeping, in all
                  its departments, as if it had been her own glory and pride; and Tina was one that
                  took glory and pride in everything of her friends, as if it had been her own.
                  Esther had been left by the death of her mother only the year before the mistress
                  of the parsonage. The great unspoken sorrow of this loss lay like a dark chasm
                  between her and her father, each striving to hide from the other its depth and
                  coldness by a brave cheerfulness.</p>
               <p>Esther, strong as was her intellectual life, had that intense sense of the worth
                  of a well-ordered household, and of the dignity of house-economies, which is
                  characteristic of New England women. Her conscientiousness pervaded every nook and
                  corner of her domestic duties with a beautiful perfection; nor did she ever feel
                  tempted to think that her fine mental powers were a reason why these homely
                  details should be considered a slavery. Household cares are a drudgery only when
                  unpervaded by sentiment. When they are an offering of love, a ministry of care and
                  devotion to the beloved, every detail has its interest.</p>
               <p>There were certain grand festivals of a minister's family which fill a
                  housekeeper's heart and hands, and in which all of us made common interest with
                  her. The Association was a reunion when all the ministers of the county met
                  together and spent a social day with the minister, dining together, and passing
                  their time in brotherly converse, such as reading essays, comparing sermons,
                  taking counsel with each other in all the varied ups and downs of their pastoral
                  life. The Consociation was another meeting of the clergy, but embracing also with
                  each minister a lay delegate, and thus uniting, not only the ministry, but the
                  laymen of the county, in a general fraternal religious conference.</p>
               <p>The first Association that Esther had to manage quite alone as sole mistress of
                  the parsonage occurred while we were with her. Like most solemn festivals of New
                  England, these seasons were announced under the domestic roof by great preparatory
                  poundings and choppings, by manufacture, on a large scale, of cakes, pies, and
                  provisions for the outer man; and at this time Harry, Tina, and I devoted all our
                  energies, and made ourselves everywhere serviceable. We ran to the store on
                  errands, we chopped mince for pies with a most virtuous pertinacity, we cut citron
                  and stoned raisins, we helped put up curtains and set up bedsteads. We were all of
                  us as resolved as Esther that the housekeeping of the little parsonage should be
                  found without speck or flaw, and should reflect glory upon her youthful
                  sovereignty.</p>
               <p>Some power or other gilded and glorified these happy days,—<pb n="452-453"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000231"/> for happy enough they were. What was it that made
                  everything that we four did together so harmonious and so charming? "Friendship,
                  only friendship," sang Tina, with silver tongue. "Such a <emph>perfect</emph>
                  friendship," she remarked, "was <emph>never</emph> known except just in our
                  particular case"; it exceeded all the classical records, all the annals, ancient
                  and modern.</p>
               <p>But what instinct or affinity in friendship made it a fact that when we four sat
                  at table together, with our lessons before us, Harry somehow was always found on
                  Esther's side? I used to notice it because his golden-brown mat of curls was such
                  a contrast to the smooth, shining black satin bands of her hair as they bent
                  together over the dictionary, and looked up innocently into each other's eyes,
                  talking of verbs and adjectives and terminations, innocently conjugating "amo,
                  amare" to each other. Was it friendship that made Esther's dark, clear eyes,
                  instinctively look towards Harry for his opinion, when we were reading our
                  compositions to one another? Was it friendship, that starry brightness that began
                  to come in Harry's eyes, and made them seem darker and bluer and deeper, with a
                  sort of mysterious meaning, when he looked at Esther? Was it friendship that
                  seemed to make him feel taller, stronger, more manly, when he thought of her, and
                  that always placed him at her hand when there was some household task that
                  required a manly height or handiness? It was Harry and Esther together who put up
                  the white curtains all through the parsonage that spring, that made it look so
                  trim and comely for the ministers' meeting. Last year, Esther said, innocently,
                  she had no one to help her, and the work tired her so. How happy, how busy, how
                  bright they were as they measured and altered, and Harry, in boundless
                  complacency, went up and down at her orders, and changed and altered and arranged,
                  till her fastidious eye was satisfied, and every fold hung aright! It was Harry
                  who took down and cleansed the family portraits, and hung them again, and balanced
                  them so nicely; it was Harry who papered over a room where the walls had been
                  disfigured by an accident, and it was Esther by him who cut the paper and trimmed
                  the bordering and executed all her little sovereignties of taste and disposal by
                  his obedient hands. And Tina and I at this time gathered green boughs and
                  ground-pine for the vases, and made floral decorations without end, till the bare
                  little parsonage looked like a woodland bower.</p>
               <p>I have pleasant recollections of those ministers' meetings. Calvinistic doctrines,
                  in their dry, abstract form, are, I confess, rather hard; but Calvinistic
                  ministers, so far as I have ever had an opportunity to observe, are invariably a
                  jolly set of fellows. In those early days the ministry had not yet felt the need
                  of that generous decision which led them afterwards to forego all dangerous
                  stimulants, as an example to their flock. A long green wooden case, full of
                  tobacco-pipes and a quantity of papers of tobacco, used to be part of the
                  hospitable stock prepared for the reception of the brethren. No less was there a
                  quantity of spirituous liquor laid in. In those days its dispensation was regarded
                  as one of the inevitable duties of hospitality. The New England ministry of this
                  period were men full of interest. Each one was the intellectual centre of his own
                  district, and supplied around him the stimulus which is now brought to bear
                  through a thousand other sources. It was the minister who overlooked the school,
                  who put parents upon the idea of giving their sons liberal educations. In poor
                  districts the minister often practised medicine, and drew wills and deeds, thus
                  supplying the place of both lawyer and doctor. Apart from their doctrinal
                  theology, which was a constant source of intellectual activity to them, their
                  secluded life led them to many forms of literary labor.</p>
               <p>As a specimen of these, it is recorded of the Rev. Mr. Taylor of Westfield, that
                  he took such delight in the writings of Origen, that, being unable to purchase
                  them, he copied them in four quarto volumes, that he might have them for his own
                  study. These are still in the possession of his descendants. Other instances of
                  literary perseverance and devotion, equally curious, might be cited.</p>
               <p>The lives that these men led were simple and tranquil. Almost all of them were
                  practical farmers, preserving about them the fresh sympathies and interests of the
                  soil, and laboring enough<pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC7953-00000232"/> with their
                  hands to keep their muscles in good order, and prevent indigestion. Mingling very
                  little with the world, each one a sort of autocrat in his way, in his own
                  district, and with an idea of stability and perpetuity in his office, which, in
                  these days, does not belong to the position of a minister anywhere, these men
                  developed many originalities and peculiarities of character, to which the simple
                  state of society then allowed full scope. They were humorists,—like the mossy old
                  apple-trees which each of them had in his orchard, bending this way and turning
                  that, and throwing out their limbs with quaint twists and jerks, yet none the less
                  acceptable, so long as the fruit they bore was sound and wholesome.</p>
               <p>We have read of "Handkerchief Moody," who for some years persisted in always
                  appearing among men with his face covered with a handkerchief,—an incident which
                  Hawthorne has worked up in his weird manner into the story of "The Minister with
                  the Black Veil."</p>
               <p>Father Mills, of Torringford, was a gigantic man who used to appear in the pulpit
                  in a full-bottomed white horse-hair wig. On the loss of a beloved wife, he laid
                  aside his wig for a year, and appeared in the pulpit with his head tied up in a
                  black handkerchief, representing to the good housewives of his parish that, as he
                  always dressed in black, he could in no other way testify to his respect for his
                  dear wife's memory; and this tribute was accepted by his parish with the same
                  innocent simplicity with which it was rendered.</p>
               <p>On the whole, the days which brought all the brother ministers to the parsonage
                  were days of enlivenment to all us young people. They seemed to have such a hearty
                  joy in their meeting, and to deliver themselves up to mirth and good-fellowship
                  with such a free and hearty <emph>abandon,</emph> and the jokes and stories which
                  they brought with them were chorused by such roars of merriment, as made us think
                  a ministers' meeting the most joyous thing on earth.</p>
               <p>I know that some say this jocund mirthfulness indicated a want of faith in the
                  doctrines they taught. But do not you and I, honest friends, often profess our
                  belief in things which it would take away our appetite and wither our strength to
                  realize, but notwithstanding which we eat and drink and sleep joyously? You read
                  in your morning paper that the city of so-and-so has been half submerged by an
                  earthquake, and that after the earthquake came a fire and burnt the crushed
                  inhabitants alive in the ruins of their dwellings. Nay, if you are an American,
                  you may believe some such catastrophe to have happened on the Erie Railroad a day
                  or two before, and that men, women, and children have been cooped up and burnt, in
                  lingering agonies, in your own vicinity. And yet, though you believe these things,
                  you laugh and talk and are gay, and plan for a party in the evening and a ride on
                  the same road the next week.</p>
               <p>No; man was mercifully made with the power of ignoring what he believes. It is all
                  that makes existence in a life like this tolerable. And our ministers, conscious
                  of doing the very best they can to keep the world straight, must be allowed their
                  laugh and joke, sin and Satan to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>There was only one brother, in the whole confraternity that used to meet at Mr.
                  Avery's, who was not a married man; and he, in spite of all the snares and
                  temptations which must beset a minister who guides a female flock of parishioners,
                  had come to the afternoon of life in the state of bachelorhood. But O the jokes
                  and witticisms which always set the room in a roar at his expense! It was a
                  subject that never wearied or grew old. To clap Brother Boardman on the back and
                  inquire for Mrs. Boardman,—to joke him about some suitable widow, or bright-eyed
                  young lamb of his flock, at each ministers' meeting,—was a provocative of mirth
                  ever fresh and ever young. But the undaunted old bachelor was always a match for
                  these attacks, and had his rejoinder ready to fling back into the camp of the
                  married men. He was a model of gallant devotion to womanhood in the abstract, and
                  seemed loath to give up to one what was meant for womankind. So, the last that I
                  ever heard of him, he was still unmarried,—a most unheard-of thing for a New
                  England parson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery was a leader among the clergy of his State. His zeal, enthusiasm,
                  eloquence, and doctrinal vigor, added to a<pb n="456-457"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000233"/> capacity for forming an indefinite number of
                  personal friendships, made him a sort of chief among them.</p>
               <p>What joyous hours they spent together in the ins and the outs, the highways and
                  by-ways, of metaphysics and theology! Harry and Esther and Tina and I learned them
                  all. We knew all about the Arminians and Pelagians and the Tasters and the
                  Exercisers, and made a deal of fun with each other over it in our private hours.
                  We knew precisely every shade of difference between tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee
                  which the different metaphysicians had invented, and tossed our knowledge joyously
                  back and forward at one another in our gayer hours, just as the old ministers did,
                  when they smoked and argued in the great parsonage dining-room. Everything is
                  joyful that is learned by two young men in company with two young women with whom
                  they are secretly in love. Mathematics, metaphysics, or no matter what of dry and
                  desolate, buds and blossoms as the rose under such circumstances.</p>
               <p>Did you ever go out in the misty gray of morning dawn, when the stars had not yet
                  shut their eyes, and still there were rosy bands lying across the east? And then
                  have you watched a trellis of morning-glories, with all the buds asleep, but ready
                  in one hour to waken? The first kiss of sunlight and they will be open! That was
                  just where we were.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE REVIVAL OF RELIGION.</head>
               <p>NO New England boy or girl comes to maturity without a full understanding of what
                  is meant by the term at the head of this chapter.</p>
               <p>Religion was, perhaps, never so much the governing idea in any Commonwealth
                  before. Nowhere has there been a people, the mass of whom acted more uniformly on
                  considerations drawn from the unseen and future life; yet nowhere a people who
                  paid a more earnest attention to the life that is seen and temporal.</p>
               <p>The New England colonies were, in the first instance, the outgrowth of a religious
                  enthusiasm. Right alongside of them, at the same period of time, other colonies
                  were founded from a religious enthusiasm quite as intense and sincere. The French
                  missionary settlers in Canada had a grandeur of self-sacrifice, an intensity of
                  religious devotion, which would almost throw in the shade that of the Pilgrim
                  Fathers; and the sole reason why one set of colonists proved the seed of a great
                  nation, and the other attained so very limited success, is the difference between
                  the religions taught by the two.</p>
               <p>The one was the religion of asceticism, in view of which contempt of the body and
                  of material good was taught as a virtue, and its teachers were men and women to
                  whom marriage and its earthly relations were forbidden. The other was the spirit
                  of the Old Testament, in which material prosperity is always spoken of as the
                  lawful reward of piety, in which marriage is an honor, and a numerous posterity a
                  thing to be desired. Our forefathers were, in many essential respects, Jews in
                  their thoughts and feelings with regard to this life, but they superadded to this
                  broad physical basis the intense spiritualism of the New Testament. Hence came a
                  peculiar race of men, uniting the utmost extremes of the material and the
                  spiritual.</p>
               <pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC7953-00000234"/>
               <p>Dr. Franklin represents that outgrowth of the New England mind which moves in the
                  material alone, and scarcely ever rises to the spiritual. President Edwards
                  represents the mind so risen to the spiritual as scarcely to touch the material.
                  Put these two together, and you have the average New England character,—that land
                  in which every <emph>ism</emph> of social or religious life has had its
                  origin,—that land whose hills and valleys are one blaze and buzz of material and
                  manufacturing production.</p>
               <p>A revival of religion in New England meant a time when that deep spiritual
                  undercurrent of thought and emotion with regard to the future life, which was
                  always flowing quietly under its intense material industries, exhaled and steamed
                  up into an atmosphere which pervaded all things, and made itself for a few weeks
                  the only thought of every person in some town or village or city. It was the
                  always-existing spiritual becoming visible and tangible.</p>
               <p>Such periods would come in the labors of ministers like Mr. Avery. When a man of
                  powerful mind and shrewd tact and great natural eloquence lives among a people
                  already thoughtfully predisposed, for no other purpose than to stir them up to the
                  care of their souls, it is evident that there will come times when the results of
                  all his care and seeking, his public ministrations, his private conversations with
                  individuals, will come out in some marked social form; and such a period in New
                  England is called a revival of religion.</p>
               <p>There were three or four weeks in the autumn of the first year that we spent in
                  Cloudland, in which there was pervading the town a sort of subdued hush of
                  emotions,—a quiet sense of something like a spiritual presence brooding through
                  the mild autumn air. This was accompanied by a general inclination to attend
                  religious services, and to converse on religious subjects. It pervaded the school;
                  it was to be heard at the store. Every kind of individual talked on and about
                  religion in his own characteristic way, and in a small mountain town like
                  Cloudland everybody's characteristic way is known to every one else.</p>
               <p>Ezekiel Scranton, the atheist of the parish, haunted the store where the farmers
                  tied up their wagons when they brought their produce, and held, after his way,
                  excited theological arguments with Deacon Phineas Simons, who kept the
                  store,—arguments to which the academy boys sometimes listened, and of which they
                  brought astounding reports to the school-room.</p>
               <p>Tina, who was so intensely sympathetic with all social influences that she
                  scarcely seemed to have an individuality of her own, was now glowing like a
                  luminous cloud with religious zeal.</p>
               <p>"I could convert that man," she said; "I know I could! I wonder Mr. Avery has n't
                  converted him long ago!"</p>
               <p>At this time, Mr. Avery, who had always kept a watchful eye upon us, had a special
                  conversation with Harry and myself, the object of which was to place us right in
                  our great foundation relations. Mr. Avery stood upon the basis that most good New
                  England men, since Jonathan Edwards, have adopted, and regarded all young people,
                  as a matter of course, out of the fold of the Church, and devoid of anything truly
                  acceptable to God, until they had passed through a mental process designated, in
                  well-known language, as conviction and conversion.</p>
               <p>He began to address Harry, therefore, upon this supposition. I well remember the
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>"My son," he said, "is it not time for you to think seriously of giving your heart
                  to God?"</p>
               <p>"I have given my heart to God," replied Harry, calmly.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Avery, with surprise; "when did that take place?"</p>
               <p>"I have always done it."</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery looked at him with a gentle surprise.</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say, my son, that you have always loved God?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Harry, quietly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery felt entirely incredulous, and supposed that this must be one of those
                  specious forms of natural piety spoken of depreciatingly by Jonathan Edwards, who
                  relates in his own memoirs similar exercises of early devotion as the mere fruits
                  of the ungrafted natural heart. Mr. Avery, therefore, proceeded to put many
                  theological questions to Harry on the nature of sin<pb n="460-461"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000235"/> and holiness, on the difference between manly,
                  natural affections and emotions, and those excited by the supernatural movement of
                  a divine power on the soul,—the good man begging him to remember the danger of
                  self-deception, saying that nothing was more common than for young people to
                  mistake the transient movements of mere natural emotions for real religion.</p>
               <p>I observed that Harry, after a few moments, became violently agitated. Two large
                  blue veins upon his forehead swelled out, his eyes had that peculiar flash and
                  fire that they had at rare intervals, when some thought penetrated through the
                  usual gentle quietude of his surface life to its deepest internal recesses. He
                  rose and walked up and down the room, and finally spoke in a thick, husky voice,
                  as one who pants with emotion. He was one of the most reserved human beings I have
                  ever known. There was a region of emotion deep within him, which it was almost
                  like death to him to express. There is something piteous and even fearful in the
                  convulsions by which such natures disclose what is nearest to their hearts.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Avery," he said, "I have heard your preaching ever since I have been here,
                  and thought of it all. It has done me good, because it has made me think deeply.
                  It is right and proper that our minds should be forced to think on all these
                  subjects; but I have not thought, and cannot think, exactly like you, nor exactly
                  like any one that I know of. I must make up my opinions for myself. I suppose I am
                  peculiar, but I have been brought up peculiarly. My lot in life has been very
                  different from that of ordinary boys. The first ten years of my life, all that I
                  can remember is the constant fear and pain and distress and mortification and want
                  through which my mother and I passed together,—she a stranger in this strange
                  land,—her husband and my father worse than nothing to us, oftentimes our greatest
                  terror. We should both of us have died, if it had not been for one thing: she
                  believed that her Saviour loved her, and loved us all. She told me that these
                  sorrows were from him,—that he permitted them because he loved us,—that they would
                  be for good in the end. She died at last alone and utterly forsaken by everybody
                  but her Saviour, and yet her death was blessed. I saw it in her eyes, and she left
                  it as her last message to me, whatever happened to me, <emph>never to doubt God's
                     love,</emph>—in all my life to trust him, to seek his counsel in all things,
                  and to believe that all that happened to me was ordered by him. This was and is my
                  religion; and, after all that I have heard, I can have no other. I do love God
                  because he is good, and because he has been good to me. I believe that Jesus
                  Christ is God, and I worship God always through him, and I leave everything for
                  myself, for life and death are in his hands. I know that I am not very good. I
                  know, as you say, I am liable to make mistakes, and to deceive myself in a
                  thousand ways; but <emph>He</emph> knows all things, and he can and will teach me;
                  he will not let me lose myself, I feel sure."</p>
               <p>"My son," said Mr. Avery, "you are blessed. I thank God with all my heart for you.
                  Go on, and God be with you!"</p>
               <p>It is to be seen that Mr. Avery was a man who always corrected theory by common
                  sense. When he perceived that a child could be trained up a Christian, and grow
                  into the love of a Heavenly Father as he grows into the love of an earthly one, by
                  a daily and hourly experience of goodness, he yielded to the perceptions of his
                  mind in that particular case.</p>
               <p>Of course our little circle of four had, at this time, deep communings. Tina was
                  buoyant and joyous, full of poetic images, delighted with the news of every
                  conversion, and taking such an interest in Mr. Avery's preaching that she several
                  times suggested to him capital subjects for sermons. She walked up to Ezekiel
                  Scranton's, one afternoon, for no other object than to convert him from his
                  atheism, and succeeded so far as to exact a promise from him that he would attend
                  all Mr. Avery's meetings for a fortnight. Ezekiel was one of the converts of that
                  revival, and Harry and I, of course, ascribed it largely to Tina's influence.</p>
               <p>A rough old New England farmer, living on the windy side of a high hill,
                  subsisting largely on codfish and hard cider, does not often win the flattering
                  attention of any little specimen of humanity like Tina; and therefore it was not
                  to be wondered at that the results of her missionary zeal appeared to his mind
                     something<pb n="462-463" xml:id="VAC7953-00000236"/> thing like that recorded
                  in the New Testament, where "an angel went down at a certain season and troubled
                  the waters."</p>
               <p>But, while Tina was thus buoyant and joyous, Esther seemed to sink into the very
                  depths of despondency. Hers, as I have already intimated, was one of those
                  delicate and sensitive natures, on which the moral excitements of New England
                  acted all the while with too much power. The work and care of a faithful pastor
                  are always complicated by the fact that those truths, and modes of presenting
                  truths, which are only just sufficient to arouse the attention of certain classes
                  of hearers, and to prevent their sinking into apathetic materialism, are
                  altogether too stimulating and exciting for others of a more delicate
                  structure.</p>
               <p>Esther Avery was one of those persons for whom the peculiar theory of religious
                  training which prevailed in New England at this period, however invigorating to
                  the intellect of the masses, might be considered as a personal misfortune. Had she
                  been educated in the tender and paternal manner recommended by the Cambridge
                  platform, and practised among the earlier Puritans, recognized from infancy as a
                  member of Christ's Church, and in tender covenant relations with him, her whole
                  being would have responded to such an appeal; her strongest leading faculties
                  would have engaged her to fulfil, in the most perfect manner, the sacred duties
                  growing out of that relation, and her course into the full communion of the Church
                  would have been gentle and insensible as a flowing river.</p>
               <p>"'T is a tyranny," says old Dr. Cotton Mather, "to impose upon every man a record
                  of the precise time and way of their conversion to God. Few that have been
                  restrained by a religious education can give such an one."</p>
               <p>Esther, however, had been trained to expect a marked and decided period of
                  conversion,—a change that could be described in the same language in which Paul
                  described the conversion of the heathen at dissolute Corinth and Ephesus. She was
                  told, as early as she was capable of understanding language, that she was by
                  nature in a state of alienation from God, in which every thought of her heart and
                  action of her life was evil, and evil only; and continually that she was entirely
                  destitute of holiness, and exposed momently to the wrath of God; and that it was
                  her immediate duty to escape from this state by an act of penitence for sin and
                  supreme love to God.</p>
               <p>The effort to bring about in her heart that state of emotion was during all her
                  youth a failure. She was by constitution delicately, intensely self-analytic, and
                  her analysis was guided by the most exacting moral ideality. Every hopeful emotion
                  of her higher nature, as it rose, was dissolved in this keen analysis, as diamond
                  and pearls disappeared in the smelting furnaces of the old alchemists. We all know
                  that self-scrutiny is the death of emotion, and that the analytic, self-inspective
                  habit is its sure preventive. Had Esther applied to her feelings for her own
                  beloved father the same tests by which she tried every rising emotion of love to
                  the Divine Being, the result would have been precisely the same.</p>
               <p>Esther was now nineteen years of age; she was the idol of her father's heart; she
                  was the staff and stay of her family; she was, in all the duties of life, inspired
                  by a most faultless conscientiousness. Her love of the absolute right was almost
                  painful in its excess of minuteness, and yet, in her own view, in the view of the
                  Church, in the view even of her admiring and loving father, she was no Christian.
                  Perfectly faultless in every relation so far as human beings could observe,
                  reverent to God, submissive to his will, careful in all outward religious
                  observances, yet wanting in a certain emotional experience, she judged herself to
                  be, and was judged to be by the theology which her father taught, utterly devoid
                  of virtue or moral excellence of any kind in the sight of God. The theology of the
                  times also taught her that the act of grace which should put an end to this state,
                  and place her in the relation of a forgiven child with her Heavenly Father, was a
                  voluntary one, momently in her power, and that nothing but her own persistent
                  refusal prevented her performing it; yet taught at the same time that, so
                  desperate was the obstinacy of the human heart, no child of Adam ever would, or
                  ever could, perform it without a special interposition of God,—an interposition
                  which might or might not come. Thus all the responsibility and the guilt rested
                  upon her.<pb n="464-465" xml:id="VAC7953-00000237"/> Now, when a nature intensely
                  conscientious is constantly oppressed by a sense of unperformed duty, that sense
                  becomes a gnawing worm at the very root of life. Esther had in vain striven to
                  bring herself into the required state of emotion. Often for weeks and months she
                  offered daily, and many times a day, prayers which brought no brightness and no
                  relief, and read conscientiously that Bible, all whose tender words and comforting
                  promises were like the distant vision of Eden to the fallen exiles, guarded by a
                  flaming sword which turned every way. Mute and mournful she looked into the
                  paradise of peace possessed by the favored ones whom God had chosen to help
                  through the mysterious passage, and asked herself, would that helping hand ever
                  open the gate to her?</p>
               <p>Esther had passed through two or three periods of revival of religion, and seen
                  others far less consistent gathered into the fold of the Church, while she only
                  sunk at each period into a state of hopeless gloom and despondency which
                  threatened her health. Latterly, her mind, wounded and bruised, had begun to turn
                  in bitter reactions. From such experiences as hers come floods of distracting
                  intellectual questions. Scepticism and doubt are the direct children of
                  unhappiness. If she had been, as her standards stated, born "utterly indisposed,
                  disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil," was not
                  this an excuse for sin? Was it <emph>her</emph> fault that she was born so? and,
                  if her Creator had brought her into being in this state, was it not an act of
                  simple justice to restore her mind to a normal condition?</p>
               <p>When she addressed these questions to her father, he was alarmed, and warned her
                  against speculation. Mr. Avery did not consider that the Assembly's catechism and
                  the Cambridge platform and a great part of his own preaching were, after all, but
                  human speculation,—the uninspired <emph>inferences</emph> of men from the Bible,
                  and not the Bible itself,—and that minds once set going in this direction often
                  cannot help a third question after a second, any more than they can help
                  breathing; and that third question may be one for which neither God nor nature has
                  an answer. Such inquiries as Esther's never arose from reading the parables of
                  Christ, the Sermon on the Mount: they are the legitimate children of mere human
                  attempts at systematic theology.</p>
               <p>How to deliver a soul that has come from excessive harassments, introspections,
                  self-analysis, into that morbid state of half-sceptical despondency, was a problem
                  over which Mr. Avery sighed in vain. His cheerful hopefulness, his sympathetic
                  vitality, had drawn many others through darkness into light, and settled them in
                  cheerful hope. But with his own daughter he felt no power,—his heart trembled,—his
                  hand was weak as the surgeon's who cannot operate when it is the life of his best
                  beloved that lies under his hands.</p>
               <p>Esther's deliverance came through that greatest and holiest of all the natural
                  sacraments and means of grace,—LOVE.</p>
               <p>An ancient gem has upon it a figure of a Psyche sitting with bound wings and
                  blindfolded and weeping, whose bonds are being sundered by Love. It is an emblem
                  of what often occurs in woman's life.</p>
               <p>It has sometimes been thrown out as a sneer on periods of religious excitement,
                  that they kindle the enthusiasm of man and woman towards each other into earthly
                  attachments; but the sneer should wither as something satanic before the purity of
                  love as it comes to noble natures. The man who has learned to think meanly of
                     <emph>that,</emph> to associate it with vulgar thoughts and low desires,—the
                  man who has not been lifted by love to aspire after unworldly excellence, to sigh
                  for unworldly purity, to reverence unworldly good,—has lost his one great chance
                  of regeneration.</p>
               <p>Harry and Esther had moved side by side for months, drawn daily to each
                  other,—showing each other their compositions, studying out of the same book,
                  arguing together in constant friendly differences,—and yet neither of them exactly
                  conscious whither they were tending. A great social, religious excitement has
                  often this result, that it throws open between friends the doors of the inner
                  nature. How long, how long we may live in the same house, sit at the same table,
                  hold daily converse with friends to whom and by whom these inner doors are closed!
                  We cannot even tell whether we should love them more or less<pb n="466-467"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000238"/> if they were open,—they are a mystery. But a great,
                  pure, pervading, social excitement breaks like some early spring day around us;
                  the sun shines, the birds sing; and forthwith open fly all the doors and win lows,
                  and let in the sunshine and the breeze and the bird-song!</p>
               <p>In such an hour Esther saw that she was beloved!—beloved by a poet soul,—one of
                  that rare order to whom the love of woman is a religion!—a baptism!—a
                  consecration!</p>
               <p>Her life, hitherto so chill and colorless, so imprisoned and bound in the chains
                  of mere and cold intellect, awoke with a sudden thrill of consciousness to a new
                  and passionate life. She was as changed as the poor and silent Jungfrau of the
                  Swiss mountains, when the gray and ghostly cold of the night bursts into rosy
                  light, as the morning sunbeams rise upon it. The most auspicious and beautiful of
                  all phenomena that ever diversify this weary life is that wonderful moment in
                  which two souls, who hitherto have not known each other, suddenly, by the lifting
                  of a veil or the falling of a barrier, become in one moment and forever after one.
                  Henceforth each soul has in itself the double riches of the other. Each weakness
                  is made strong by some corresponding strength in the other; for the truest union
                  is where each soul has precisely the faculty which the other needs.</p>
               <p>Harry was by nature and habit exactly the reverse of Esther. His conclusions were
                  all intuitions. His religion was an emanation from the heart, a child of personal
                  experience, and not a formula of the head. In him was seen the beginning of that
                  great <emph>reaction</emph> which took place largely in the young mind of New
                  England against the tyranny of mere logical methods as applied to the ascertaining
                  of moral truths.</p>
               <p>The hour of full heart union that made them one placed her mind under the control
                  of his. His simple faith in God's love was an antidote to her despondent fears.
                  His mind bore hers along on its current. His imagination awakened hers. She was
                  like one carried away by a winged spirit, lifted up and borne heavenward by his
                  faith and love. She was a transfigured being. An atmosphere of joy brightened and
                  breathed around her; her eyes had a mysterious depth, her cheeks a fluttering
                  color. The winter was over and past for her, and the time of the singing of birds
                  had come.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery was in raptures. The long agony was past. He had gained a daughter and a
                  son, and he was too joyful, too willing to believe, to be analytic or critical.
                  Long had he secretly hoped that such faultless consistency, such strict attention
                  to duty, might perhaps indicate a secret work of divine grace, which would spring
                  into joy if only recognized and believed in. But now, when the dove that had long
                  wandered actually bent her white wings at the window of the ark, he stretched
                  forth his hand and drew her in with a trembling eagerness.</p>

               <head type="sub">AFTER THE REVIVAL.</head>
               <p>BUT the revival could not always last. The briefness of these periods, and the
                  inevitable gravitation of everybody back to the things of earth, has sometimes
                  been mentioned with a sneer.</p>
               <p>"Where 's your revival now?"</p>
               <p>The deacon whose face was so radiant as he talked of the love of Christ now sits
                  with the same face drawn into knots and puckers over his account-book; and he
                  thinks the money for the mortgage is due, and the avails for the little country
                  store are small; and somehow a great family of boys and girls eat up and wear out;
                  and the love of Christ seems a great way off, and the trouble about the mortgage
                  very close at hand; and so the deacon is cross, and the world has its ready sneer
                  for the poor man. "He can talk about the love of Christ, but he 's a terrible
                  screw at a bargain," they say. Ah, brother, have mercy! the world screws us, and
                  then we are tempted to screw the world. The soil is hard, the climate cold, labor
                  incessant, little to come of it, and can you sneer that a poor soul has, for a
                  brief season, forgotten all this and risen out of his body and above his cares,
                  and been for a little while a glorified deacon instead of a poor, haggling,
                  country store-keeper?</p>
               <p>Plato says that we all once had wings, and that they still tend to grow out in us,
                  and that our burnings and aspirations for higher things are like the teething
                  pangs of children. We are trying to cut our wings. Let us not despise these
                  teething seasons. Though the wings do not become apparent, they may be starting
                  under many a rough coat, and on many a clumsy pair of shoulders.</p>
               <p>But in our little town of Cloudland, after the heavenly breeze had blown over,
                  there were to be found here and there immortal flowers and leaves from the tree of
                  life, which had blown into many a dwelling.</p>
               <p>Poor old drunken Culver, who lived under the hill, and was said to beat his wife,
                  had become a changed man, and used to come out to weekly prayer-meetings. Some
                  tough old family quarrels, such as follow the settlement of wills in a poor
                  country, had at last been brought to an end, and brother had shaken hands with
                  brother: the long root of bitterness had been pulled up and burned on the altar of
                  love. It is true that nobody had become an angel. Poor sharp-tongued Miss Krissy
                  Pike still went on reporting the wasteful excesses she had seen in the minister's
                  swill-barrel. And some that were crabbed and cross-grained before were so still,
                  and some, perhaps, were a little more snarly than usual, on account of the late
                  over-excitement.</p>
               <p>A revival of religion merely makes manifest for a time what religion there is in a
                  community, but it does not exalt men above their nature or above their times. It
                  is neither revelation nor inspiration; it is impulse. It gives no new faculties,
                  and it goes at last into that general average of influences which go to make up
                  the progress of a generation.</p>
               <p>One terrestrial result of the revival in our academy was that about half a dozen
                  of the boys fell desperately in love with Tina. I have always fancied Tina to be
                  one of that species of woman-kind that used to be sought out for priestesses to
                  the Delphic oracle. She had a flame-like, impulsive, ethereal temperament, a
                  capacity for sudden inspirations, in which she was carried out of herself, and
                  spoke winged words that made one wonder whence they came. Her religious zeal had
                  impelled her to be the adviser of every one who came near her, and her sayings
                  were quoted, and some of our shaggy, rough-coated mountain boys thought that they
                  had never had an idea of the beauty of holiness before. Poor boys! they were so
                  sacredly simple about it. And Tina came to me with wide brown eyes that sparkled
                  like a cairngorm-stone, and told me that she believed she had found what her
                  peculiar calling was: it was to influence young men in religion! She cited, with
                  enthusiasm, the wonderful results she had been able to produce, the sceptical
                  doubts she had removed,<pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC7953-00000240"/> the conceptions
                  of heavenly things that she had been able to pour into their souls.</p>
               <p>The divine priestess and I had a grand quarrel one day, because I insisted upon it
                  that these religious ministrations on the part of a beautiful young girl to those
                  of the opposite sex would assuredly end in declarations of love and hopes of
                  marriage.</p>
               <p>Girls like Tina are often censured as flirts,—most unjustly so, too. Their
                  unawakened nature gives them no power of perceiving what must be the full extent
                  of their influence over the opposite sex. Tina was warmly social; she was
                  enthusiastic and self-confident, and had precisely that spirit which should fit a
                  woman to be priestess or prophetess, to inspire and to lead. She had a magnetic
                  fervor of nature, an attractive force that warmed in her cheeks and sparkled in
                  her eyes, and seemed to make summer around her. She excited the higher
                  faculties,—poetry, ideality, blissful dreams seemed to be her atmosphere,—and she
                  had a power of quick sympathy, of genuine, spontaneous outburst, that gave to her
                  looks and words almost the value of a caress, so that she was an unconscious
                  deceiver, and seemed always to say more for the individual than she really meant.
                  All men are lovers of sunshine and spring gales, but they are no one's in
                  particular; and he who seeks to hold them to one heart finds his mistake. Like all
                  others who have a given faculty, Tina loved its exercise,—she loved to influence,
                  loved to feel her power, alike, over man and woman. But who does not know that the
                  power of the sibyl is doubled by the opposition of sex? That which is only
                  acquiescence in a woman friend becomes devotion in a man. That which is admiration
                  from a woman becomes adoration in a man. And of all kinds of power which can be
                  possessed by man or woman, there is none which I think so absolutely intoxicating
                  as this of personal fascination. You may as well blame a bird for wanting to soar
                  and sing as blame such women for the instinctive pleasure they feel in their
                  peculiar kind of empire. Yet, in simple good faith, Tina did not want her friends
                  of the other sex to become lovers. She was willing enough that they should devote
                  themselves, under all sorts of illusive names of brother and friend and what-not,
                  but when they proceeded to ask her for herself there was an instant revulsion, as
                  when some person has unguardedly touched a strong electric circle. The first
                  breath of passion repelled her; the friend that had been so agreeable the hour
                  before was unendurable. Over and over again have I seen her go the same illusive
                  round, always sure that in this instance it was understood that it was to be
                  friendship, and only friendship, or brotherly or Christian love, till the hour
                  came for the electric revulsion, and the friend was lost.</p>
               <p>Tina had not learned the modern way of girls, who count their lovers and offers as
                  an Indian does his scalps, and parade the number of their victims before their
                  acquaintances. Every incident of this kind struck her as a catastrophe; and, as
                  Esther, Harry, and I were always warning her, she would come to us like a guilty
                  child, and seek to extenuate her offence. I think the girl was sincere in the wish
                  she often uttered, that she could be a boy, and be loved as a comrade and friend
                  only. "Why must, why would, they always persist in falling into this tiresome
                  result?" "O Horace!" she would say to me, "if I were only Tom Percival, I should
                  be perfectly happy! but it is so stupid to be a girl!"</p>
               <p>In my own secret soul I had no kind of wish that she should be Tom Percival, but I
                  did not tell her so. No, I was too wise for that. I knew that my only chance of
                  keeping my position as father-confessor to this elastic young penitent consisted
                  in a judicious suppression of all peculiar claims or hopes on my part, and I was
                  often praised and encouraged for this exemplary conduct, and the question
                  pathetically put to me, "Why could n't the others do as I did?" O Tina, Tina! did
                  your brown eyes see, and your quick senses divine, that there was something in me
                  which you dreaded to awaken, and feared to meet?</p>
               <p>There are some men who have a faculty of making themselves the confidants of
                  women. Perhaps because they have a certain amount of the feminine element in their
                  own composition. They seem to be able to sympathize with them on their feminine
                  side, and are capable of running far in a friendship without running fatally into
                  love.</p>
               <p>I think I had this power, and on it I founded my hopes in this<pb n="472-473"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000241"/> regard. I enjoyed, in my way, almost as much
                  celebrity in our little circle for advising and guiding my friends of the other
                  sex as Tina did, and I took care to have on hand such a list of intimates as would
                  prevent my name from being coupled with hers in the school gossip.</p>
               <p>In these modern times, when man's fair sister is asking admission at the doors of
                  classic halls, where man has hitherto reigned in monastic solitude, the query is
                  often raised by our modern sociologists, Can man and woman, with propriety, pursue
                  their studies together? Does the great mystery of sex, with its wide laws of
                  attraction, and its strange, blinding, dazzling influences, furnish a sufficient
                  reason why the two halves of creation, made for each other, should be kept during
                  the whole course of education rigorously apart? This question, like a great many
                  others, was solved without discussion by the good sense of our Puritan ancestors,
                  in throwing the country academies, where young men were fitted for college, open
                  alike to both sexes, and in making the work of education of such dignity in the
                  eyes of the community, that first-rate men were willing to adopt it for life. The
                  consequences were, that, in some lonely mountain town, under some brilliant
                  schoolmaster, young men and women actually were studying together the branches
                  usually pursued in college.</p>
               <p>"But," says the modern objector, "bring young men and young women together in
                  these relations, and there will be flirtations and love affairs."</p>
               <p>Even so, my friend, there will be. But flirtations and love affairs among a nice
                  set of girls and boys, in a pure and simple state of community, where love is
                  never thought of, except as leading to lawful marriage, are certainly not the
                  worst things that can be thought of,—not half so bad as the grossness and
                  coarseness and roughness and rudeness of those wholly male schools in which boys
                  fight their way on alone, with no humanizing influences from the other sex.</p>
               <p>There was, to be sure, a great crop of love affairs, always green and vigorous, in
                  our academy, and vows of eternal constancy interchanged between boys and girls who
                  afterwards forgot and outgrew them, without breaking their hearts on either side;
                  but, for my own part, I think love-making over one's Latin and Greek much better
                  than the fisting and cuffing and fagging of English schools, or than many another
                  thing to which poor, blindly fermenting boyhood runs when separated from home,
                  mother, and sister, and confined to an atmosphere and surroundings sharply and
                  purely male. It is certain that the companionship of the girl improves the boy,
                  but more doubt has been expressed whether the delicacy of womanhood is not
                  impaired by an early experience of the flatteries and gallantries of the other
                  sex. But, after all, it is no worse for a girl to coquette and flirt in her Latin
                  and mathematical class than to do it in the German or the polka. The studies and
                  drill of the school have a certain repressive influence, wholly wanting in the
                  ball-room and under the gas-light of fashionable parties. In a good school, the
                  standard of attraction is, to some extent, intellectual. The girl is valued for
                  something besides her person; her disposition and character are thoroughly tested,
                  the powers of her mind go for something, and, what is more, she is known in her
                  every-day clothes. On the whole, I do not think a better way can be found to bring
                  the two sexes together, without that false glamour which obscures their knowledge
                  of each other, than to put them side by side in the daily drill of a good literary
                  institution.</p>
               <p>Certainly, of all the days that I look back upon, this academy life in Cloudland
                  was the most perfectly happy. It was happier than college life, because of the
                  constant intertwining and companionship with woman, which gave a domestic and
                  family charm to it. It was happy because we were in the first flush of belief in
                  ourselves, and in life.</p>
               <p>O that first belief! those incredible first visions! when all things look
                  possible, and one believes in the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and sees
                  enchanted palaces in the sunset clouds!</p>
               <p>What faith we had in one another, and how wonderful we were in one another's eyes!
                  Our little clique of four was a sort of holy of holies in our view. We believed
                  that we had secrets of happiness and progress known only to ourselves. We had full
                  faith in one another's destiny; we were all remarkable people, and destined to do
                  great things.</p>
               <pb n="474-475" xml:id="VAC7953-00000242"/>
               <p>At the close of the revival, we four, with many others, joined Mr. Avery's
                  church,—a step which in New England, at this time, meant a conviction of some
                  spiritual experience gained, of some familiar communion with the Great Invisible.
                  Had I found it then? Had I laid hold of that invisible hand, and felt its warmth
                  and reality? Had I heard the beatings of a warm heart under the cold exterior of
                  the regular laws of nature, and found a living God? I thought so. That hand and
                  heart were the hand and heart of Jesus,—the brother, the friend, and the
                  interpreting God for poor, blind, and helpless man.</p>
               <p>As we stood together before the pulpit, with about fifty others, on that Sunday
                  most joyful to Mr. Avery's heart, we made our religious profession with ardent
                  sincerity. The dear man found in that day the reward of all his sorrows, and the
                  fruit of all his labors. He rejoiced in us as first fruits of the millennium,
                  which, having already dawned in his good honest heart, he thought could not be far
                  off from the earth.</p>
               <p>Ah! those days of young religion were vaguely and ignorantly beautiful, like all
                  the rest of our outlook on life. We were sincere, and meant to be very good and
                  true and pure, and we knew so little of the world we were living in! The village
                  of Cloudland, without a pauper, with scarcely an ignorant person in it, with no
                  temptation, no dissipation, no vice,—what could we know there of the appalling
                  questions of real life? We were hid there together, as in the hollow of God's
                  hand; and a very sweet and lovely hiding-place it was.</p>
               <p>Harry had already chosen his profession; he was to be a clergyman, and study with
                  Mr. Avery when his college course was finished. In those days the young aspirants
                  for the pulpit were not gathered into seminaries, but distributed through the
                  country, studying, writing, and learning the pastoral work by sharing the labors
                  of older pastors. Life looked, therefore, very bright to Harry, for life was, at
                  that age, to live with Esther. Worldly care there was none. Mr. Avery was rich on
                  two hundred and fifty dollars, and there were other places in the mountains where
                  birds sung and flowers grew, where Esther could manage another parsonage, as now
                  her father's. She lived in the world of taste and intellect and thought. Her love
                  of the beautiful was fed by the cheap delights of nature, and there was no onerous
                  burden of care in looking forward to marriage, such as now besets a young man when
                  he meditates taking to himself some costly piece of modern luxury,—some exotic
                  bird, who must be fed on incense and odors, and for whom any number of gilded
                  cages and costly surroundings may be necessary. Marriage, in the days of which I
                  speak, was a very simple and natural affair, and Harry and Esther enjoyed the full
                  pleasure of talking over and arranging what their future home should be; and Tina,
                  quite as interested as they, drew wonderful pictures of it, and tinted them with
                  every hue of the rainbow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery talked with me many times to induce me to choose the same profession. He
                  was an enthusiast for it; it was to him a calling that eclipsed all others, and he
                  could wish the man he loved no greater blessedness than to make him a
                  minister.</p>
               <p>But I felt within myself a shrinking doubt of my own ability to be the moral guide
                  of others, and my life-long habit of half-sceptical contemplation made it so
                  impossible to believe the New England theology with the perfect, undoubting faith
                  that Mr. Avery had, that I dared not undertake. I did not disbelieve. I would not
                  for the world controvert; but I could not believe with his undoubting enthusiasm.
                  His sword and spear, so effective in his hands, would tremble in mine. I knew that
                  Harry would do something. He had a natural call, a divine impulse, that led him
                  from childhood to sacred ministries; and though he did not more than I accept the
                  system of new-school theology as complete truth, yet I could see that it would
                  furnish to his own devotional nature a stock from which vigorous grafts would
                  shoot forth.</p>
               <p>Shall I say, also, that my future was swayed unconsciously by a sort of
                  instinctive perception of what yet might be desired by Tina? Something a little
                  more of this world I seemed to want to lay at her feet. I felt, somehow, that
                  there was in her an aptitude for the perfume and brightness and gayeties of this
                  lower world. And as there must be, not only clergymen, but lawyers, and as men
                  will pay more for getting their own will than for saving their souls, I dreamed of
                  myself, in the future, as a lawyer<pb n="476-477" xml:id="VAC7953-00000243"/>
                  yer,—of course a rising one; of course I should win laurels at the bar, and win
                  them by honorable means. I <emph>would</emph> do it; and Tina should be mistress
                  of a fine, antique house in Boston, like the Kitterys', with fair, large gardens
                  and pleasant prospects, and she should glitter and burn and twinkle like a gem, in
                  the very front ranks of society. Yes, I was ambitious, but it was for her.</p>
               <p>One thing troubled me: every once in a while, in the letters from Miss Mehitable,
                  came one from Ellery Davenport, written in a free, gay, dashing, cavalier style,
                  and addressing Tina with a kind of patronizing freedom that made me ineffably
                  angry. I wanted to shoot him. Such are the risings of the ancient Adam in us, even
                  after we have joined the Church. Tina always laughed at me because I scolded and
                  frowned at these letters, and, I thought, seemed to take rather a perverse
                  pleasure in them. I have often speculated on that trait wherein lovely woman
                  slightly resembles a cat; she cannot, for the life of her, resist the temptation
                  to play with her mouse a little, and rouse it with gentle pats of her velvet paw,
                  just to see what it will do.</p>
               <p>I was, of course, understood to be under solemn bond and promise to love Tina only
                  as a brother; but was it not a brother's duty to watch over his sister? With what
                  satisfaction did I remember all Miss Debby Kittery's philippics against Ellery
                  Davenport! Did I not believe every word of them heartily? I hated the French
                  language with all my soul, and Ellery Davenport's proficiency in it; and Tina
                  could not make me more angry than by speaking with admiration of his graceful
                  fluency in French, and expressing rather wilful determinations that, when she got
                  away from Mr. Rossiter's dictation, she would study it. Mr. Davenport had said
                  that, when he came back to America, he would give her French lessons. He was
                  always kind and polite, and she did n't doubt that he 'd give <emph>me</emph>
                  lessons, too, if I 'd take them. "French is the language of modern civilization,"
                  said Tina, with the decision of a professor. But she made me promise that I would
                  n't say a word to her about it before Mr. Rossiter.</p>
               <p>"Now, Horace dear, you know," she said, "that French to him is just like a red rag
                  to a bull; he 'd begin to roar and lash his sides the minute you said the words,
                  and Mr. Rossiter and I are capital tal friends now. You 've no idea, Horace, how
                  good he is to me. He takes such an interest in the development of my mind. He
                  writes me a letter or note almost every week about it, and I take his advice, you
                  know, and I would n't want to hurt his feelings about French, or anything else.
                  What do you suppose he hates the French so for? I should think he was a genuine
                  Englishman, that had been kept awake nights during all the French wars."</p>
               <p>"Well, Tina," I said, "you know there is a great deal of corrupt and dangerous
                  literature in the French language."</p>
               <p>"What nonsense, Horace! just as if there was n't in the English language, too, and
                  I none the worse for it. And I 'm sure there are no ends of bad things in the
                  classical dictionary, and in the mythology. He 'd better talk about the French
                  language! No, you may depend upon it, Horace, I shall learn French as soon as I
                  leave school."</p>
               <p>It will be inferred from this that my young lady had a considerable share of that
                  quality which Milton represents to have been the ruin of our first mother; namely,
                  a determination to go her own way and see for herself, and have little
                  confidential interviews with the serpent, notwithstanding all that could be urged
                  to the contrary by sober old Adam.</p>
               <p>"Of course, Adam," said Eve, "I can take care of myself, and don't want you always
                  lumbering after me with your advice. You think the serpent will injure me, do you?
                  That just shows how little you know about me. The serpent, Adam, is a very
                  agreeable fellow, and helps one to pass away one's time; but he don't take me in.
                  O no! there's no danger of his ever getting around <emph>me!</emph> So, my dear
                  Adam, go your own way in the garden, and let me manage for myself."</p>
               <p>Whether in the celestial regions there will be saints and angels who develop this
                  particular form of self-will, I know not; but in this world of what Mr. Avery
                  called "imperfect sanctification," religion does n't prevent the fair angels of
                  the other sex from developing this quality in pretty energetic forms. In fact, I
                  found that, if I was going to guide my Ariadne at all, I must let out my line
                  fast, and let her feel free and unwatched.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE MINISTER'S WOOD-SPELL.</head>
               <p>IT was in the winter of this next year that the minister's "wood-spell" was
                  announced.</p>
               <p>"What is a wood-spell?" you say. Well, the pastor was settled on the understanding
                  of receiving two hundred dollars a year and his wood; and there was a certain day
                  set apart in the winter, generally in the time of the best sleighing, when every
                  parishioner brought the minister a sled-load of wood; and thus, in the course of
                  time, built him up a mighty wood-pile.</p>
               <p>It was one of the great seasons of preparation in the minister's family, and Tina,
                  Harry, and I had been busy for two or three days beforehand, in helping Esther
                  create the wood-spell cake, which was to be made in quantities large enough to
                  give ample slices to every parishioner. Two days beforehand, the fire was besieged
                  with a row of earthen pots, in which the spicy compound was rising to the
                  necessary lightness, and Harry and I split incredible amounts of oven-wood, and in
                  the evening we sat together stoning raisins round the great kitchen fire, with Mr.
                  Avery in the midst of us, telling us stories and arguing with us, and entering
                  into the hilarity of the thing like a boy. He was so happy in Esther, and
                  delighted to draw the shy color into her cheeks, by some sly joke or allusion,
                  when Harry's head of golden curls came into close proximity with her smooth black
                  satin tresses.</p>
               <p>The cake came out victorious, and we all claimed the merit of it; and a mighty
                  cheese was bought, and every shelf of the closet, and all the dressers of the
                  kitchen, were crowded with the abundance.</p>
               <p>We had a jewel of a morning,—one of those sharp, clear, sunny winter days, when
                  the sleds squeak over the flinty snow, and the little icicles tingle along on the
                  glittering crust as they fall from the trees, and the breath of the slow-pacing
                  oxen steams up like a rosy cloud in the morning sun, and then falls back condensed
                  in little icicles on every hair.</p>
               <p>We were all astir early, full of life and vigor. There was a holiday in the
                  academy. Mr. Rossiter had been invited over to the minister's to chat and tell
                  stories with the farmers, and give them high entertainment. Miss Nervy Randall,
                  more withered and wild in her attire than usual, but eminently serviceable, stood
                  prepared to cut cake and cheese without end, and dispense it with wholesome nods
                  and messages of comfort. The minister himself heated two little old andirons
                  red-hot in the fire, and therewith from time to time stirred up a mighty bowl of
                  flip, which was to flow in abundance to every comer. Not then had the temperance
                  reformation dawned on America, though ten years later Mr. Avery would as soon have
                  been caught in a gambling-saloon as stirring and dispensing a bowl of flip to his
                  parishioners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery had recently preached a highly popular sermon on agriculture, in which
                  he set forth the dignity of the farmer's life, from the text, "For the king
                  himself is served of the field"; and there had been a rustle of professional
                  enthusiasm in all the mountain farms around, and it was resolved, by a sort of
                  general consent, that the minister's wood-pile this year should be of the best:
                  none of your old make-shifts,—loads made out with crooked sticks and snapping
                  chestnut logs, most noisy, and destructive to good wives' aprons. Good straight
                  shagbark-hickory was voted none too good for the minister. Also the axe was lifted
                  up on many a proud oak and beech and maple. What destruction of glory and beauty
                  there was in those mountain regions! How ruthlessly man destroys in a few hours
                  that which centuries cannot bring again!</p>
               <p>What an idea of riches in those glorious woodland regions! We read legends of
                  millionnaires who fed their fires with cinnamon and rolled up thousand-dollar
                  bills into lamp-lighters, in the very wantonness of profusion. But what was that
                  compared to the prodigality which fed our great roaring winter fires on the
                  thousand-leafed oaks, whose conception had been ages ago,—<pb n="480-481"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000245"/> who were children of the light and of the
                  day,—every fragment and fibre of them made of most celestial influences, of
                  sunshine and rain-drops, and night-dews and clouds, slowly working for centuries
                  until they had wrought the wondrous shape into a gigantic miracle of beauty? And
                  then snuffling old Heber Atwood, with his two hard-fisted boys, cut one down in a
                  forenoon and made logs of it for the minister's wood-pile. If this is n't making
                  light of serious things, we don't know what is. But think of your wealth, O ye
                  farmers!—think what beauty and glory every year perish to serve your
                  cooking-stoves and chimney-corners.</p>
               <p>To tell the truth, very little of such sentiment was in Mr. Avery's mind or in any
                  of ours. We lived in a woodland region, and we were <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >blasé</foreign> with the glory of trees. We did admire the splendid elms that
                  hung their cathedral arches over the one central street of Cloudland Village, and
                  on this particular morning they were all aflame like Aladdin's palace, hanging
                  with emeralds and rubies and crystals, flashing and glittering and dancing in the
                  sunlight. And when the first sled came squeaking up the village street, we did not
                  look upon it as the funereal hearse bearing the honored corpse of a hundred
                  summers, but we boys clapped our hands and shouted, "Hurrah for old Heber!" as his
                  load of magnificent oak, well-bearded with gray moss, came scrunching into the
                  yard. Mr. Avery hastened to draw the hot flip-iron from the fire and stir the
                  foaming bowl. Esther began cutting the first loaf of cake, and Mr. Rossiter walked
                  out and cracked a joke on Heber's shoulder, whereat all the cast-iron lineaments
                  of his hard features relaxed. Heber had not the remotest idea at this moment that
                  he was to be branded as a tree-murderer. On the contrary, if there was anything
                  for which he valued himself, and with which his heart was at this moment swelling
                  with victorious pride, it was his power of cutting down trees. Man he regarded in
                  a physical point of view as principally made to cut down trees, and trees as the
                  natural enemies of man. When he stood under a magnificent oak, and heard the airy
                  rustle of its thousand leaves, to his ear it was always a rustle of defiance, as
                  if the old oak had challenged him to single combat; and Heber would feel of his
                  axe and say, "Next winter, old boy, we 'll see,—we 'll see!" And at this moment he
                  and his two tall, slab-sided, big-handed boys came into the kitchen with an
                  uplifted air, in which triumph was but just repressed by suitable modesty. They
                  came prepared to be complimented, and they were complimented accordingly.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Atwood," said the minister, "you must have had pretty hard work on that
                  load; that 's no ordinary oak; it took strong hands to roll those logs, and yet I
                  don't see but two of your boys. Where are they all now?"</p>
               <p>"Scattered, scattered!" said Heber, as he sat with a great block of cake in one
                  hand, and sipped his mug of flip, looking, with his grizzly beard and shaggy hair
                  and his iron features, like a cross between a polar bear and a man,—a very shrewd,
                  thoughtful, reflective polar bear, however, quite up to any sort of argument with
                  a man.</p>
               <p>"Yes, they 're scattered," he said. "We 're putty lonesome now 't our house.
                  Nobody there but Pars, Dass, Dill, Noah, and 'Liakim. I ses to Noah and 'Liakim
                  this mornin', 'Ef we had all our boys to hum, we sh'd haf to take up two loads to
                  the minister, sartin, to make it fair on the wood-spell cake.'"</p>
               <p>"Where are your boys now?" said Mr. Avery. "I have n't seen them at meeting now
                  for a good while."</p>
               <p>"Wal, Sol and Tim 's gone up to Umbagog, lumberin'; and Tite, he 's sailed to
                  Archangel; and Jeduth, he 's gone to th' West Injies for molasses; and Pete, he 's
                  gone to the West. Folks begins to talk now 'bout that 'ere Western kentry, and so
                  Pete, he must go to Buffalo, and see the great West. He 's writ back about Niagry
                  Falls. His letters is most amazin'. The old woman, she can't feel easy 'bout him
                  no way. She insists 'pon it them Injuns 'll scalp him. The old woman is just as
                  choice of her boys as ef she had n't got just es many es she has."</p>
               <p>"How many sons have you?" said Harry, with a countenance of innocent wonder.</p>
               <p>"Wal," said Heber, "I 've seen the time when I had fourteen good, straight
                  boys,—all on 'em a turnin' over a log together."</p>
               <p>"Dear me!" said Tina. "Had n't you any daughters?"</p>
               <pb n="482-483" xml:id="VAC7953-00000246"/>
               <p>"Gals?" said Heber, reflectively. "Bless you, yis. There 's been a gal or two
                  'long, in between, here an' there,—don't jest remember where they come; but, any
                  way, there 's plenty of women-folks 't our house."</p>
               <p>"Why!" said Tina, with a toss of her pretty head, "you don't seem to think much of
                  women."</p>
               <p>"Good in their way," said Heber, shaking his head; "but Adam was fust formed, and
                  then Eve, you know." Looking more attentively at Tina as she stood bridling and
                  dimpling before him, like a bird just ready to fly, Heber conceived an indistinct
                  idea that he must say something gallant, so he added, "Give all honor to the
                  women, as weaker vessels, ye know; that 's sound doctrine, I s'pose."</p>
               <p>Heber having now warmed and refreshed himself, and endowed his minister with what
                  he conceived to be a tip-top, irreproachable load of wood, proceeded, also, to
                  give him the benefit of a little good advice, prefaced by gracious words of
                  encouragement. "I wus tellin' my old woman this mornin' that I did n't grudge a
                  cent of my subscription, 'cause your preachin' lasts well and pays well. Ses I,
                  'Mr. Avery ain't the kind of man that strikes twelve the fust time. He 's a man
                  that 'll wear.' That 's what I said fust, and I 've followed y' up putty close in
                  yer preachin'; but then I 've jest got one word to say to ye. Ain't free agency a
                  gettin' a leetle too top-heavy in yer preachin'? Ain't it kind o' overgrowin'
                  sovereignty? Now, ye see, divine sovereignty hes got to be took care of as well as
                  free agency. That 's all, that 's all. I thought I 'd jest drop the thought, ye
                  know, and leave you to think on 't. This 'ere last revival you run along
                  considerble on 'Whosoever will may come,' an' all that. Now, p'r'aps, ef you 'd
                  jest tighten up the ropes a leetle t'other side, and give 'em sovereignty, the
                  hull load would sled easier."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Mr. Avery, "I 'm much obliged to you for your suggestions."</p>
               <p>"Now there 's my wife's brother, Josh Baldwin," said Heber; "he was delegate to
                  the last Consociation, and he heerd your openin' sermon, and ses he to me, ses he,
                  'Your minister sartin doos slant a leetle towards th' Arminians; he don't quite
                  walk the crack,' Josh says, ses he. Ses I, 'Josh, we ain't none on us perfect;
                  but,' ses I, 'Mr. Avery ain't no Arminian, I can tell you. Yeh can't judge Mr.
                  Avery by one sermon,' ses I. You hear him preach the year round, and ye 'll find
                  that all the doctrines gits their place.' Ye see I stood up for ye, Mr. Avery, but
                  I thought 't would n't do no harm to kind o' let ye know what folks is
                  sayin'."</p>
               <p>Here the theological discussion was abruptly cut short by Deacon Zachary Chipman's
                  load, which entered the yard amid the huzzahs of the boys. Heber and his boys were
                  at the door in a minute. "Wal, railly, ef the deacon hain't come down with his
                  shagbark! Wal, wal, the revival has operated on him some, I guess. Last year the
                  deacon sent a load that I 'd ha' been ashamed to had in my back yard, an' I took
                  the liberty o' tellin' on him so. Good, straight-grained shagbark. Wal, wal! I 'll
                  go out an' help him onload it. Ef that 'ere holds out to the bottom, the deacon 's
                  done putty wal, an' I shall think grace <emph>has</emph> made some progress."</p>
               <p>The deacon, a mournful, dry, shivery-looking man, with a little round bald head,
                  looking wistfully out of a great red comforter, all furry and white with the sharp
                  frosts of the morning, and, with his small red eyes weeping tears through the
                  sharpness of the air, looked as if he had come as chief mourner at the hearse of
                  his beloved hickory-trees. He had cut down the very darlings of his soul, and come
                  up with his precious load, impelled by a divine impulse like that which made the
                  lowing kine, in the Old Testament story, come slowly bearing the ark of God, while
                  their brute hearts were turning toward the calves that they had left at home.
                  Certainly, if virtue is in proportion to sacrifice, Deacon Chipman's load of
                  hickory had more of self-sacrifice in it than a dozen loads from old Heber; for
                  Heber was a forest prince in his way of doing things, and, with all his shrewd
                  calculations of money's worth, had an open-handed generosity of nature that made
                  him take a pride in liberal giving.</p>
               <p>The little man shrank mournfully into a corner, and sipped his tumbler of flip and
                  ate his cake and cheese as if he had been at a funeral.</p>
               <pb n="484-485" xml:id="VAC7953-00000247"/>
               <p>"How are you all at home, deacon?" said Mr. Avery, heartily.</p>
               <p>"Just crawlin', thank you,—just crawlin'. My old woman don't git out much; her
                  rheumatiz gits a dreadful strong hold on her; and, Mr. Avery, she hopes you 'll be
                  round to visit her 'fore long. Since the revival she 's kind o' fell into
                  darkness, and don't see no cheerin' views. She ses sometimes the universe ain't
                  nothin' but blackness and darkness to her."</p>
               <p>"Has she a good appetite?" said Mr. Avery.</p>
               <p>"Wal, no. She don't enjoy her vittles much. Some say she 's got the jaunders. I
                  try to cosset her up, and git her to take relishin' things. I tell her ef she 'd
                  eat a good sassage for breakfast of a cold mornin', with a good hearty bit o'
                  mince-pie, and a cup o' strong coffee, 't would kind o' set her up for the day;
                  but, somehow, she don't git no nourishment from her food."</p>
               <p>"There, Rossiter," we heard Mr. Avery whisper aside, "you see what a country
                  minister has to do,—give cheering views to a dyspeptic that breakfasts on sausages
                  and mince-pies."</p>
               <p>And now the loads began coming thick and fast. Sometimes two and three, and
                  sometimes four and five, came stringing along, one after another, in unbroken
                  procession. For every one Mr. Avery had an appreciative word. Its especial points
                  were noticed and commended, and the farmers themselves, shrewdest observers,
                  looked at every load and gave it their verdict. By and by the kitchen was full of
                  a merry, chatting circle, and Mr. Rossiter and Mr. Avery were telling their best
                  stories, and roars of laughter came from the house.</p>
               <p>Tina glanced in and out among the old farmers, like a bright tropical bird,
                  carrying the cake and cheese to each one, laughing and telling stories, dispensing
                  smiles to the younger ones,—treacherous smiles, which meant nothing, but made the
                  hearts beat faster under their shaggy coats; and if she saw a red-fisted fellow in
                  a corner, who seemed to be having a bad time, she would go and sit down by him,
                  and be so gracious and warming and winning that his tongue would be loosened, and
                  he would tell her all about his steers and his calves and his last crop of corn,
                  and his load of wood, and then wonder all the way home whether he should ever
                  have, in a house of his own, a pretty little woman like that.</p>
               <p>By afternoon the minister's wood-pile was enormous. It stretched beyond anything
                  before seen in Cloudland; it exceeded all the legends of neighboring wood-piles
                  and wood-spells related by deacons and lay delegates in the late Consociation. And
                  truly, among things picturesque and graceful, among childish remembrances, dear
                  and cheerful, there is nothing that more speaks to my memory than the dear, good
                  old mossy wood-pile. Harry, Tina, Esther, and I ran up and down and in and about
                  the piles of wood that evening with a joyous satisfaction. How fresh and spicy and
                  woodsy it smelt! I can smell now the fragrance of the hickory, whose clear, oily
                  bark in burning cast forth perfume quite equal to cinnamon. Then there was the
                  fragrant black birch, sought and prized by us all for the high-flavored bark on
                  the smaller limbs, which was a favorite species of confectionery to us. There were
                  also the logs of white birch, gleaming up in their purity, from which we made
                  sheets of woodland parchment.</p>
               <p>It is recorded of one man who stands in a high position at Washington, that all
                  his earlier writing-lessons were performed upon leaves of the white birch bark,
                  the only paper used in the family.</p>
               <p>Then there were massive trunks of oak, veritable worlds of mossy vegetation in
                  themselves, with tufts of green velvet nestled away in their bark, and sheets of
                  greenness carpeting their sides, and little white, hoary trees of moss, with
                  little white, hoary apples upon them, like miniature orchards.</p>
               <p>One of our most interesting amusements was forming landscapes in the snow, in
                  which we had mountains and hills and valleys, and represented streams of water by
                  means of glass, and clothed the sides of our hills with orchards of apple-trees
                  made of this gray moss. It was an incipient practice at landscape-gardening, for
                  which we found rich material in the wood-pile. Esther and Tina had been filling
                  their aprons with these mossy treasures, for which we had all been searching
                  together, and<pb n="486-487" xml:id="VAC7953-00000248"/> now we all sat chatting
                  in the evening light. The sun was going down. The sleds had ceased to come, the
                  riches of our woodland treasures were all in, the whole air was full of the
                  trembling, rose-colored light that turned all the snow-covered landscape to
                  brightness. All around us not a fence to be seen,—nothing but waving hollows of
                  spotless snow, glowing with the rosy radiance, and fading away in purple and lilac
                  shadows; and the evening stars began to twinkle, one after another, keen and clear
                  through the frosty air, as we all sat together in triumph on the highest perch of
                  the wood-pile. And Harry said to Esther, "One of these days they 'll be bringing
                  in our wood," and Esther's cheeks reflected the pink of the sky.</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed!" said Tina. "And then I am coming to live with you. I 'm going to be
                  an old maid, you know, and I shall help Esther as I do now. I never shall want to
                  be married."</p>
               <p>Just at this moment the ring of sleigh-bells was heard coming up the street. Who
                  and what now? A little one-horse sleigh drove swiftly up to the door, the driver
                  sprang out with a lively alacrity, hitched his horse, and came toward the house.
                  In the same moment Tina and I recognized Ellery Davenport!</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">ELLERY DAVENPORT.</head>
               <p>TINA immediately turned and ran into the house, laughing, and up stairs into her
                  chamber, leaving Esther to go seriously forward,—Esther always tranquil and always
                  ready. For myself, I felt such a vindictive hatred at the moment as really alarmed
                  me. What had this good-natured man done, with his frank, merry face and his easy,
                  high-bred air, that I should hate him so? What sort of Christian was I, to feel in
                  this way? Certainly it was a temptation of the Devil, and I would put it down, and
                  act like a reasonable being. So I went forward with Harry, and he shook hands with
                  us.</p>
               <p>"Hulloa, fellows!" he said, "you 've made the great leap since I saw you, and
                  changed from boys into men."</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Miss Avery," he said, as we presented him to her. "May I trench on
                  your hospitality a little? I am a traveller in these arctic regions, and Miss
                  Mehitable charged me to call and see after the health and happiness of our young
                  friends here. I see," he said, looking at us, "that there need be no inquiries
                  after health; your looks speak for themselves."</p>
               <p>"Why, Percival!" he said, turning to Harry, "what a pair of shoulders you are
                  getting! Genuine Saxon blood runs in your veins plainly enough, and one of these
                  days, when you get to be Sir Harry Percival, you 'll do honor to the name."</p>
               <p>The proud, reserved blood flushed into Harry's face, and his blue eyes, usually so
                  bright and clear, sparkled with displeasure. I was pleased to see that Ellery
                  Davenport had made him angry. Yes, I said to myself, "What want of tact for him to
                  dare to touch on a subject that Harry's most intimate friends never speak of!"</p>
               <p>Esther looked fixedly at him with those clear, piercing hazel eyes, as if she were
                  mentally studying him. I hoped she would not like him; yet why should I hope
                  so?</p>
               <pb n="488-489" xml:id="VAC7953-00000249"/>
               <p>He saw in a moment that he had made a mistake, and glided off quickly to another
                  subject.</p>
               <p>"Where's my fair little enemy, Miss Tina?" he said.</p>
               <p>His "fair little enemy" was at this moment attentively studying him through a
                  crack in the window-curtain. Shall I say, too, that the first thing she did, on
                  rushing up to her room, was to look at her hair, and study herself in the glass,
                  wondering how she would look to him now. Well, she had not seen herself for some
                  hours, and self-knowledge is a virtue, we all know. And then our scamper over the
                  wood-pile, in the fresh, evening air, must have deranged something, for Tina had
                  one of those rebellious heads of curls that every breeze takes liberties with, and
                  that have to be looked after and watched and restrained. Esther's satin bands of
                  hair could pass through a whirlwind, and not lose their gloss. It is curious how
                  character runs even to the minutest thing,—the very hairs of our heads are
                  numbered by it,—Esther, always in everything self-poised, thoughtful, reflective;
                  Tina, the child of every wandering influence, tremulously alive to every new
                  excitement, a wind-harp for every air of heaven to breathe upon.</p>
               <p>It would be hard to say what mysterious impulse for good or ill made her turn and
                  run when she saw Ellery Davenport. That turning and running in girls means
                  something; it means that the electric chain has been struck in some way; but
                  how?</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport came into the house, and was received with frank cordiality by Mr.
                  Avery. He was a grandson of Jonathan Edwards, and the good man regarded him as, in
                  some sort, a son of the Church, and had, no doubt, instantaneous promptings for
                  his conversion. Mr. Avery, though he believed stringently in the doctrine of total
                  depravity, was very innocent in his application of it to individuals. That Ellery
                  Davenport was a sceptic was well known in New England, wherever the reputation of
                  his brilliant talents and person had circulated, and Mr. Avery had often longed
                  for an opportunity to convert him. The dear, good man had no possible idea that
                  anybody could go wrong from any thing but mistaken views, and he was sure, in the
                  case of Ellery Davenport, that his mind must have been perplexed about free agency
                  and decrees, and thus he hailed with delight the Providence which had sent him to
                  his abode. He plunged into an immediate conversation with him about the state of
                  France, whence he had just returned.</p>
               <p>Esther, meanwhile, went up stairs to notify Tina of his arrival.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ellery Davenport is below, and has inquired for you."</p>
               <p>Nobody could be more profoundly indifferent to any piece of news.</p>
               <p>"Was that Mr. Ellery Davenport? How stupid of him to come here when we are all so
                  tired! I don't think I can go down; I am too tired."</p>
               <p>Esther, straightforward Esther, took the thing as stated. Tina, to be sure, had
                  exhibited no symptoms of fatigue up to that moment; but Esther now saw that she
                  had been allowing her to over-exert herself.</p>
               <p>"My darling," she said, "I have been letting you do too much altogether. You are
                  quite right; you should lie down here quietly, and I'll bring you up your tea.
                  Perhaps by and by, in the evening, you might come down and see Mr. Davenport, when
                  you are rested."</p>
               <p>"O nonsense about Mr. Davenport! he does n't come to see me. He wants to talk with
                  your father, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"But he has inquired for you two or three times," said Esther, "and he really
                  seems to be a very entertaining, well-informed man; so by and by, if you feel
                  rested, I should think you had better come down."</p>
               <p>Now I, for my part, wondered then and wonder now, and always shall, what all this
                  was for. Tina certainly was not a coquette; she had not learned the art of trading
                  in herself, and using her powers and fascinations as women do who have been in the
                  world, and learnt the precise value of everything that they say and do. She was,
                  at least now, a simple child of nature, yet she acted exactly as an artful
                  coquette might have done.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport constantly glanced at the door as he talked with Mr. Avery, and
                  shifted uneasily on his chair; evidently he expected her to enter, and when Esther
                  returned without her he<pb n="490-491" xml:id="VAC7953-00000250"/> was secretly
                  vexed and annoyed. I was glad of it, too, like a fool as I was. It would have been
                  a thousand times better for my hopes had she walked straight out to meet him, cool
                  and friendly, like Esther. There was one comfort; he was a married man; but then
                  that crazy wife of his might die, or might be dead now. Who knew? To be sure,
                  Ellery Davenport never had the air of a married man,—that steady, collected,
                  sensible, restrained air which belongs to the male individual, conscious, wherever
                  he moves, of a home tribunal, to which he is <choice>
                     <sic>reponsible</sic>
                     <corr>responsible</corr>
                  </choice>. He had gone loose in society, pitied and petted and caressed by ladies,
                  and everybody said, if his wife should die, Ellery Davenport might marry whom he
                  pleased. Esther knew nothing about him, except a faint general outline of his
                  history. She had no prepossessions for or against, and he laid himself out to
                  please her in conversation, with that easy grace and quick perception of character
                  which were habitual with him. Ellery Davenport had been a thriving young Jacobin,
                  and Mr. Avery and Mr. Rossiter were fierce Federalists.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rossiter came in to tea, and both of them bore down exultingly on Ellery
                  Davenport in regard to the disturbances in France.</p>
               <p>"Just what I always said!" said Mr. Rossiter. "French democracy is straight from
                  the Devil. It's the child of misrule, and leads to anarchy. See what their
                  revolution is coming to. Well, I may not be orthodox entirely on the question of
                  total depravity, but I always admitted the total depravity of the whole French
                  nation."</p>
               <p>"O, the French are men of like passions with us!" said Ellery Davenport. "They
                  have been ground down and debased and imbruted till human nature can bear no
                  longer, and now there is a sudden outbreak of the lower classes,—the turning of
                  the worm."</p>
               <p>"Not a worm," said Mr. Rossiter, "a serpent, and a strong one."</p>
               <p>"Davenport," said Mr. Avery, "don't you see that all this is because this
                  revolution is in the hands of atheists?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do, sir. These fellows have destroyed the faith of the common people,
                  and given them nothing in its place."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you recognize that," said Mr. Avery.</p>
               <p>"Recognize, my dear sir! Nobody knows the worth of religion as a political force
                  better than I do. Those French people are just like children,—full of sentiment,
                  full of feeling, full of fire, but without the cold, judging, logical power that
                  is frozen into men here by your New England theology. If I have got to manage a
                  republic, give me Calvinists."</p>
               <p>"You admit, then," said Mr. Avery, delightedly, "the worth of Calvinism."</p>
               <p>"As a political agent, certainly I do," said Ellery Davenport. "Men must have
                  strong, positive religious beliefs to give them vigorous self-government; and
                  republics are founded on the self-governing power of the individual."</p>
               <p>"Davenport," said Mr. Avery, affectionately laying his hand on his shoulder, "I
                  should like to have said that thing myself, I could n't have put it better."</p>
               <p>"But do you suppose," said Esther, trembling with eagerness, "that they will
                  behead the Queen?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do," said Ellery Davenport, with that air of cheerful composure with
                  which the retailer of the last horror delights to shock a listener. "O certainly!
                  I would n't give a pin for her chance. You read the account of the trial, I
                  suppose; you saw that it was a foregone conclusion?"</p>
               <p>"I did, indeed," said Esther. "But, O Mr. Davenport! can nothing be done? There is
                  Lafayette; can he do nothing?"</p>
               <p>"Lafayette may think himself happy if he keeps his own head on his shoulders,"
                  said Davenport. "The fact is, that there is a wild beast in every human being. In
                  our race it is the lion. In the French race it is the tiger,—hotter, more
                  tropical, more blindly intense in rage and wrath. Religion, government, education,
                  are principally useful in keeping the human dominant over the beast; but when the
                  beast gets above the human in the community, woe be to it."</p>
               <p>"Davenport, you talk like an apostle," said Mr. Avery.</p>
               <p>"You know the devils believe and tremble," said Ellery.</p>
               <p>"Well, I take it," said Mr. Rossiter, "you've come home from France disposed to be
                  a good Federalist."</p>
               <pb n="492-493" xml:id="VAC7953-00000251"/>
               <p>"Yes, I have," said Ellery Davenport. "We must all live and learn, you know."</p>
               <p>And so in one evening Ellery witched himself into the good graces of every one in
                  the simple parsonage; and when Tina at last appeared she found him reigning king
                  of the circle. Mr. Rossiter, having drawn from him the avowal that he was a
                  Federalist, now looked complacently upon him as a hopeful young neophyte. Mr.
                  Avery saw evident marks of grace in his declarations in favor of Calvinism, while
                  yet there was a spicy flavor of the prodigal son about him,—enough to engage him
                  for his conversion. Your wild, wicked, witty prodigal son is to a spiritual
                  huntsman an attractive mark, like some rare kind of eagle, whose ways must be
                  studied, and whose nest must be marked, and in whose free, savage gambols in the
                  blue air and on the mountain-tops he has a kind of hidden sympathy.</p>
               <p>When Tina entered, it was with an air unusually shy and quiet. She took all his
                  compliments on her growth and change of appearance with a negligent,
                  matter-of-course air, seated herself in the most distant part of the room, and
                  remained obstinately still and silent. Nevertheless, it was to be observed that
                  she lost not a word that he said, or a motion that he made. Was she in that stage
                  of attraction which begins with repulsion? or did she feel stirring within her
                  that intense antagonism which woman sometimes feels toward man, when she
                  instinctively divines that he may be the one who shall one day send a herald and
                  call on her to surrender. Women are so intense, they have such prophetic,
                  fore-reaching, nervous systems, that sometimes they appear to be endowed with a
                  gift of prophecy. Tina certainly was an innocent child at this time,
                  uncalculating, and acting by instinct alone, and she looked upon Ellery Davenport
                  as a married man, who was and ought to be and would be nothing to her; and yet,
                  for the life of her, she could not treat him as she treated other men.</p>
               <p>If there was in him something which powerfully attracted, there was also something
                  of the reverse pole of the magnet, that repelled, and inspired a feeling not
                  amounting to fear, but having an undefined savor of dread, as if some invisible
                  spirit about him gave mysterious warning. There was a sense of such hidden,
                  subtile power under his suavities, the grasp of the iron hand was so plain through
                  the velvet glove, that delicate and impressible natures felt it. Ellery Davenport
                  was prompt and energetic and heroic; he had a great deal of impulsive good-nature,
                  as his history in all our affairs shows. He was always willing to reach out the
                  helping hand, and helped to some purpose when he did so; and yet I felt, rather
                  than could prove, in his presence, that he could be very remorseless and
                  persistently cruel.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport inherited the whole Edwards nature, without its religious
                  discipline,—a nature strong both in intellect and passion. He was an unbelieving
                  Jonathan Edwards. It was this whole nature that I felt in him, and I looked upon
                  the gradual interest which I saw growing in Tina toward him, in the turning of her
                  thoughts on him, in her flights from him and attractions to him, as one looks on
                  the struggles of a fascinated bird, who flees and returns, and flees and returns,
                  each time drawn nearer and nearer to the diamond eyes.</p>
               <p>These impressions which come to certain kinds of natures are so dim and cloudy, it
                  is so much the habit of the counter-current of life to disregard them, and to feel
                  that an impression of which you have no physical, external proof is of necessity
                  an absurdity and a weakness, that they are seldom acted on,—seldom, at least, in
                  New England, where the habit of logic is so formed from childhood in the mind, and
                  the believing of nothing which you cannot prove is so constant a portion of the
                  life education. Yet with regard to myself, as I have stated before, there was
                  always a sphere of impression surrounding individuals, for which often I could
                  give no reasonable account. It was as if there had been an emanation from the
                  mind, like that from the body. From some it was an emanation of moral health and
                  purity and soundness; from others, the sickly effluvium of moral decay, sometimes
                  penetrating through all sorts of outward graces and accomplishments, like the
                  smell of death through the tube-roses and lilies on the coffin.</p>
               <pb n="494-495" xml:id="VAC7953-00000252"/>
               <p>I could not prove that Ellery Davenport was a wicked man; but I had an instinctive
                  abhorrence of him, for which I reproached myself constantly, deeming it only the
                  madness of an unreasonable jealousy.</p>
               <p>His stay with us at this time was only for a few hours. The next morning he took
                  Harry alone and communicated to him some intelligence quite important to his
                  future.</p>
               <p>"I have been to visit your father," he said, "and have made him aware what
                  treasures he possesses in his children."</p>
               <p>"His children have no desire that he should be made aware of it," said Harry,
                  coldly. "He has broken all ties between them and him."</p>
               <p>"Well, well!" said Ellery Davenport, "the fact is Sir Harry has gone into the
                  virtuous stage of an Englishman's life, where a man is busy taking care of his
                  gouty feet, looking after his tenants, and repenting at his leisure of the sins of
                  his youth. But you will find, when you come to enter college next year, that there
                  will be a handsome allowance at your disposal; and, between you and me, I 'll just
                  say to you that young Sir Harry is about as puny and feeble a little bit of
                  mortality as I ever saw. To my thinking, they 'll never raise him; and his life is
                  all that stands between you and the estate. You know that I got your mother's
                  marriage certificate, and it is safe in Parson Lothrop's hands. So you see there
                  may be a brilliant future before you and your sister. It is well enough for you to
                  know it early, and keep yourself and her free from entanglements. School
                  friendships and flirtations and all that sort of thing are pretty little spring
                  flowers,—very charming in their way and time; but it is n't advisable to let them
                  lead us into compromising ourselves for life. If your future home is to be
                  England, of course you will want your marriage to strengthen your position
                  there."</p>
               <p>"My future home will never be England," said Harry, briefly. "America has nursed
                  me and educated me, and I shall always be, heart and soul, an American. My life
                  must be acted in this country."</p>
               <p>The other suggestion contained in Ellery Davenport's advice was passed over
                  without a word. Harry was not one that could discuss his private relations with a
                  stranger. He could not but feel obliged to Ellery Davenport for the interest that
                  he had manifested in him, and yet there was something about this easy, patronizing
                  manner of giving advice that galled him. He was not yet old enough not to feel
                  vexed at being reminded that he was young.</p>
               <p>It seemed but a few hours, and Ellery Davenport was gone again; and yet how he had
                  changed everything! The hour that he drove up, how perfectly innocently happy and
                  united we all were! Our thoughts needed not to go beyond the present moment: the
                  moss that we had gathered from the wood-pile, and the landscapes that we were
                  going to make with it, were greater treasures than all those of that unknown world
                  of brightness and cleverness and wealth and station, out of which Ellery Davenport
                  had shot like a comet, to astonish us, and then go back and leave us in
                  obscurity.</p>
               <p>Harry communicated the intelligence given him by Ellery Davenport, first to me,
                  then to Tina and Esther and Mr. Avery, but begged that it might not be spoken of
                  beyond our little circle. It could and it should make no change, he said. But can
                  expectations of such magnitude be awakened in young minds without a change?</p>
               <p>On the whole, Ellery Davenport left a trail of brightness behind him,
                  notwithstanding my sinister suspicions. "How open-handed and friendly it was of
                  him," said Esther, "to come up here, when he has so much on his hands! He told
                  father that he should have to be in Washington next week, to talk with them there
                  about French affairs."</p>
               <p>"And I hope he may do Tom Jefferson some good!" said Mr. Avery,
                  indignantly,—"teach him what he is doing in encouraging this hideous, atheistical
                  French revolution! Why, it will bring discredit on republics, and put back the
                  cause of liberty in Europe a century! Davenport sees into that as plainly as I
                  do."</p>
               <p>"He 's a shrewd fellow," said Mr. Rossiter. "I heard him talk three or four years
                  ago, when he was over here, and he was about as glib-tongued a Jacobin as you'd
                  wish to see; but now my young man has come round handsomely. I told him he<pb
                     n="496-497" xml:id="VAC7953-00000253"/> ought to tell Jefferson just how the
                  thing is working. I go for government by the respectable classes of society."</p>
               <p>"Davenport evidently is not a regenerated man," said Mr. Avery, thoughtfully; "but
                  as far as speculative knowledge goes, he is as good a theologian as his
                  grandfather. I had a pretty thorough talk with him, before we went to bed last
                  night, and he laid down the distinctions with a clearness and a precision that
                  were astonishing. He sees right through that point of the difference between
                  natural and moral inability, and he put it into a sentence that was as neat and
                  compact and clear as a quartz crystal. I think there was a little rub in his mind
                  on the consistency of the freedom of the will with the divine decrees, and I just
                  touched him off with an illustration or two there, and I could see, by the flash
                  of his eye, how quickly he took it. 'Davenport,' said I to him, 'you are made for
                  the pulpit; you ought to be in it.'</p>
               <p>"'I know it,' he said, 'Mr. Avery; but the trouble is, I am not good enough. I
                  think,' he said, 'sometimes I should like to have been as good a man as my
                  grandfather; but then, you see, there 's the world, the flesh, and the Devil, who
                  all have something to say to that.'</p>
               <p>"'Well,' says I, 'Davenport, the world and the flesh last only a little
                  while—'</p>
               <p>"'But the Devil and I last forever, I suppose you mean to say,' said he, getting
                  up with a sort of careless swing; and then he said he must go to bed; but before
                  he went he reached out his hand and smiled on me, and said, 'Good night, and thank
                  you, Mr. Avery.' That man has a beautiful smile. It's like a spirit in his
                  face."</p>
               <p>Had Ellery Davenport been acting the hypocrite with Mr. Avery? Supposing a man is
                  made like an organ, with two or three banks of keys, and ever so many stops, so
                  that he can play all sorts of tunes on himself; is it being a hypocrite with each
                  person to play precisely the tune, and draw out exactly the stop, which he knows
                  will make himself agreeable and further his purposes? Ellery Davenport did
                  understand the New England theology as thoroughly as Mr. Avery. He knew it from
                  turret to foundation-stone. He knew all the evidences of natural and revealed
                  religion, and, when he chose to do so, could make most conclusive arguments upon
                  them. He had a perfect appreciation of devotional religion, and knew precisely
                  what it would do for individuals. He saw into politics with unerring precision,
                  and knew what was in men, and whither things were tending. His unbelief was purely
                  and simply what has been called in New England the natural opposition of the heart
                  to God. He loved his own will, and he hated control, and he determined, <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">per fas aut nefas,</foreign> to carry his own plans in this
                  world, and attend to the other when he got into it. To have his own way, and to
                  carry his own points, and to do as he pleased, were the ruling purposes of his
                  life.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">LAST DAYS IN CLOUDLAND.</head>
               <p>THE day was coming now that the idyl of Cloudland must end, and our last term
                  wound up with a grand dramatic entertainment.</p>
               <p>It was a time-honored custom in New England academies to act a play once a year as
                  the closing exercise, and we resolved that our performance should surpass all
                  others in scenic effect.</p>
               <p>The theme of the play was to be the story of Jephthah's daughter, from the Old
                  Testament. It had been suggested at first to take Miss Hannah More's sacred drama
                  upon this subject; but Tina insisted upon it that it would be a great deal better
                  to write an original drama ourselves, each one taking a character, and composing
                  one's own part.</p>
               <p>Tina was to be Jephthah's daughter, and Esther her mother; and a long opening
                  scene between them was gotten up by the two in a private session at their desks in
                  the school-room one night, and, when perfected, was read to Harry and me for our
                  critical judgment. The conversation was conducted in blank verse, with the usual
                  appropriate trimmings and flourishes of that species of literature, and, on the
                  whole, even at this time, I do not see but that it was quite as good as Miss
                  Hannah More's.</p>
               <p>There was some skirmishing between Harry and myself about our parts, Harry being,
                  as I thought, rather too golden-haired and blue-eyed for the grim resolve and
                  fierce agonies of Jephthah. Moreover, the other part was to be that of Tina's
                  lover, and he was to act very desperate verses indeed, and I represented to Harry
                  privately that here, for obvious reasons, I was calculated to succeed. But Tina
                  overruled me with that easy fluency of good reasons which the young lady always
                  had at command. "Harry would make altogether the best lover," she said; "he was
                  just cut out for a lover. Then, besides, what does Horace know about it? Harry has
                  been practising for six months, and Horace has n't even begun to think of such
                  things yet."</p>
               <p>This was one of those stringent declarations that my young lady was always making
                  with regard to me, giving me to understand that her whole confidence in me was
                  built entirely on my discretion. Well, I was happy enough to let it go so, for
                  Ellery Davenport had gone like an evening meteor, and we had ceased talking and
                  thinking about him. He was out of our horizon entirely. So we spouted blank verse
                  at each other, morning, noon, and night, with the most cheerful courage. Tina and
                  Harry had, both of them, a considerable share of artistic talent, and made
                  themselves very busy in drawing and painting scenery,—a work in which the lady
                  principal, Miss Titcomb, gave every assistance; although, as Tina said, her views
                  of scenery were mostly confined to what was proper for tombstones. "But then," she
                  added, "let her have the whole planning of my grave, with a great weeping willow
                  over it,—that 'll be superb! I believe the weeping willows will be out by that
                  time, and we can have real branches. Won't that be splendid!"</p>
               <p>Then there was the necessity of making our drama popular, by getting in the
                  greatest possible number of our intimate friends and acquaintances. So Jephthah
                  had to marshal an army on the stage, and there was no end of paper helmets to be
                  made. In fact, every girl in school who could turn her hand to anything was making
                  a paper helmet.</p>
               <p>There was to be a procession of Judæan maidens across the stage, bearing the body
                  of Jephthah's daughter on a bier, after the sacrifice. This took in every leading
                  girl in the school; and as they were all to be dressed in white, with blue
                  ribbons, one may fancy the preparation going on in all the houses far and near.
                  There was also to be a procession of youths, bearing the body of the faithful
                  lover, who, of course, was to die, to keep the departed company in the shades.</p>
               <p>We had rehearsals every night for a fortnight, and Harry, Tina, and I officiated
                  as stage-managers. It is incredible the trouble we had. Esther acted the part of
                  Judæan matron to perfection,—her long black hair being let down and dressed
                     after<pb n="500-501" xml:id="VAC7953-00000255"/> a picture in the Biblical
                  Dictionary, which Tina insisted upon must be authentic. Esther, however, rebelled
                  at the nose-jewels. There was no making her understand the Oriental taste of the
                  thing; she absolutely declined the embellishment, and finally it was agreed among
                  us that the nose-jewels should be left to the imagination.</p>
               <p>Harry looked magnificent, with the help of a dark mustache, which Tina very
                  adroitly compounded of black ravelled yarn, arranging it with such delicacy that
                  it had quite the effect of hair. The difficulty was that in impassioned moments
                  the mustache was apt to get awry; and once or twice, while on his knees before
                  Tina in tragical attitudes, this occurrence set her off into hysterical giggles,
                  which spoiled the effect of the rehearsal. But at last we contrived a plaster
                  which the most desperate plunges of agony could not possibly disarrange.</p>
               <p>As my eyes and hair were black, when I had mounted a towering helmet overshadowed
                  by a crest of bear-skin, fresh from an authentic bear that Heber Atwood had killed
                  only two weeks before, I made a most fateful and portentous Jephthah, and
                  flattered myself secretly on the tragical and gloomy emotions excited in the
                  breasts of divers of my female friends.</p>
               <p>I composed for myself a most towering and lofty entrance scene, when I came in
                  glory at the head of my troops. I could not help plagiarizing Miss Hannah More's
                  first line:— <q>
                     <l>"On Jordan's banks proud Ammon's banners wave."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Any writer of poems will pity me, when he remembers his own position, if he has
                  ever tried to make a verse on some subject and been stuck and pierced through by
                  some line of another poet, which so sticks in his head and his memory that there
                  is no possibility of his saying the thing any other way. I tried beginning,— <q>
                     <l>"On Salem's plains the summer sun is bright";</l>
                  </q> but when I looked at my troop of helmets and the very startling banner which
                  we were to display, and reflected that Josh Billings was to give an inspiring
                  blast on a bugle behind the scenes, I perfectly longed to do the glorious and
                  magnificent, and this resounding line stood right in my way.</p>
               <p>"Well, dear me, Horace," said Tina, "take it, and branch off from it,—make a text
                  of it."</p>
               <p>And so I did. How martial and Miltonic I was! I really made myself feel quite
                  serious and solemn with the pomp and glory of my own language; but I contrived to
                  introduce into my resounding verses a most touching description of my daughter, in
                  which I exhausted Oriental images and similes on her charms. Esther and I were to
                  have rather a tender scene, on parting, as she was to be my wife; but then we
                  minded it not a jot. The adroitness with which both these young girls avoided
                  getting into relations that might savor of reality was an eminent instance of
                  feminine tact. And while Harry was playing the impassioned lover at Tina's feet,
                  Esther looked at him slyly, with just the slightest shade of
                  consciousness,—something as slight as the quivering of an eyelash, or a tremulous
                  flush on her fair cheek. There was fire under that rose-colored snow after all,
                  and that was what gave the subtle charm to the whole thing.</p>
               <p>We had an earnest discussion among us four as to what was proper to be done with
                  the lover. Harry insisted upon it, that, after tearing his hair and executing all
                  the other proprieties of despair, he should end by falling on his sword; and he
                  gave us two or three extemporaneous representations of the manner in which he
                  intended to bring out this last scene. How we screamed with laughter over these
                  discussions, as Harry, whose mat of curls was somewhat prodigious, ran up and down
                  the room, howling distractedly, running his fingers through his hair until each
                  separate curl stood on end, and his head was about the size of a half-bushel! We
                  nearly killed ourselves laughing over our tragedy, but still the language thereof
                  was, none the less broken-hearted and impassioned.</p>
               <p>Tina was vindictive and bloodthirsty in her determination that the tragedy should
                  be of the deepest dye. She exhibited the ferocity of a little pirate in her utter
                  insensibility to the details of blood and murder, and would not hear of any
                  concealment, or half-measures, to spare anybody's feelings. She insisted upon
                  being stabbed on the stage, and she had rigged up a kitchen carving-knife with a
                  handle of gilt paper, ornamented with<pb n="502-503" xml:id="VAC7953-00000256"/>
                  various breastpins of the girls, which was celebrated in florid terms in her part
                  of the drama as a Tyrian dagger.</p>
               <p>"Why Tyrian," objected Harry, "when it is the Jews that are fighting the
                  Ammonites?"</p>
               <p>"O nonsense, Harry! Tyrian sounds a great deal better, and the Ammonites, I don't
                  doubt, had Tyrian daggers," said Tina, who displayed a feminine facility in the
                  manufacture of facts. "Tyre, you know," she added, "was the country where all
                  sorts of things were made: Tyrian purple and Tyrian mantles,—why, of course they
                  must have made daggers, and the Jews must have got them,—of course they must! I 'm
                  going to have it, not only a Tyrian dagger, but a sacred dagger, taken away from a
                  heathen temple and consecrated to the service of the Lord. And only see what a
                  sheath I have made for it! Why, at this distance it could n't be told from gold!
                  And how do you suppose that embossed work is made? Why, it's different-colored
                  grains of rice and gilt paper rolled up!"</p>
               <p>It must be confessed that nobody enjoyed Tina's successes more heartily than she
                  did herself. I never knew anybody who had a more perfect delight in the work of
                  her own hands.</p>
               <p>It was finally concluded, in full concert, that the sacrifice was to be performed
                  at an altar, and here came an opportunity for Miss Titcomb's proficiency in
                  tombstones to exercise itself. Our altar was to be like the lower part of a
                  monument, so we decided, and Miss Titcomb had numerous patterns of this kind,
                  subject to our approval. It was to be made life-size, of large sheets of
                  pasteboard, and wreathed with sacrificial garlands.</p>
               <p>Tina was to come in at the head of a chorus of wailing maidens, who were to sing a
                  most pathetic lamentation over her. I was to stand grim and resolved, with my eyes
                  rolled up into my helmet, and the sacrificial Tyrian dagger in my hands, when she
                  was to kneel down before the altar, which was to have real flame upon it. The top
                  of the altar was made to conceal a large bowl of alcohol, and before the entering
                  of the procession the lights were all to be extinguished, and the last scene was
                  to be witnessed by the lurid glare of the burning light on the altar. Any one who
                  has ever tried the ghostly, spectral, supernatural appearance which his very
                  dearest friend may be made to have by this simple contrivance, can appreciate how
                  very sanguine our hopes must have been of the tragical power of this <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">dénouement.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>All came about quite as we could have hoped. The academy hall was packed and
                  crammed to the ceiling, and our acting was immensely helped by the loudly
                  expressed sympathy of the audience, who entered into the play with the most
                  undisguised conviction of its reality. When the lights were extinguished, and the
                  lurid flame flickered up on the altar, and Tina entered dressed in white with her
                  long hair streaming around her, and with an inspired look of pathetic resignation
                  in her large, earnest eyes, a sort of mournful shudder of reality came over me,
                  and the words I had said so many times concerning the sacrifice of the victim
                  became suddenly intensely real; it was a sort of stage illusion, an overpowering
                  belief in the present.</p>
               <p>The effect of the ghastly light on Tina's face, on Esther's and Harry's, as they
                  grouped themselves around in the preconcerted attitudes, was really
                  overwhelming.</p>
               <p>It had been arranged that, at the very moment when my hand was raised, Harry, as
                  the lover, should rush forward with a shriek, and receive the dagger in his own
                  bosom. This was the last modification of our play, after many successive
                  rehearsals, and the success was prodigious. I stabbed Harry to the heart, Tina
                  gave a piercing shriek and fell dead at his side, and then I plunged the dagger
                  into my own heart, and the curtain fell, amid real weeping and wailing from many
                  unsophisticated, softhearted old women.</p>
               <p>Then came the last scene,—the procession of youths and maidens across the stage,
                  bearing the bodies of the two lovers,—the whole ending in an admirably constructed
                  monument, over which a large willow was seen waving. This last gave to Miss
                  Titcomb, as she said, more complete gratification than any scene that had been
                  exhibited. The whole was a most triumphant success.</p>
               <p>Heber Atwood's "old woman" declared that she caught her breath, and thought she
                  "should ha' fainted clean away when she<pb n="504-505" xml:id="VAC7953-00000257"/>
                  see that gal come in." And as there was scarcely a house in which there was not a
                  youth or a maiden who had borne part in the chorus, all Cloudland shared in the
                  triumph.</p>
               <p>By way of dissipating the melancholy feelings consequent upon the tragedy, we had
                  a farce called. "Our Folks," which was acted extemporaneously by Harry, Tina, and
                  myself, consisting principally in scenes between Harry as Sam Lawson, Tina as
                  Hepsie, and myself as Uncle Fliakim, come in to make a pastoral visit, and exhort
                  them how to get along and manage their affairs more prosperously. There had been
                  just enough strain upon our nerves, enough reality of tragic exultation, to excite
                  that hysterical quickness of humor which comes when the nervous system is well up.
                  I let off my extra steam in Uncle Fliakim with a good will, as I danced in in my
                  black silk tights, knocking down the spinning-wheel, upsetting the cradle, setting
                  the babies to crying, and starting Hepsie's tongue, which lost nothing of force or
                  fluency in Tina's reproduction. How the little elf could have transformed herself
                  in a few moments into such a peaked, sharp, wiry-featured, virulent-tongued
                  virago, was matter of astonishment to us all; while Harry, with a suit of
                  fluttering old clothes, with every joint dissolving in looseness, and with his
                  bushy hair in a sort of dismayed tangle, with his cheeks sucked in and his eyes
                  protruding, gave an inimitable Sam Lawson.</p>
               <p>The house was convulsed; the screams and shrieks of laughter quite equalled the
                  moans of distress in our tragedy.</p>
               <p>And so the curtain fell on our last exhibition in Cloudland. The next day was all
                  packing of trunks and taking of leave, and last words from Mr. Rossiter and Mr.
                  Avery to the school, and settling of board-bills and school-bills, and sending
                  back all the breastpins from the Tyrian dagger, and a confused kicking about of
                  helmets, together with interchanges between various Johns and Joans of vows of
                  eternal constancy, assurances from some fair ones that, "though they could not
                     <emph>love,</emph> they should always regard as a brother," and from some of
                  our sex to the same purport toward gentle-hearted Aramintas,—very pleasant to look
                  upon and charming to dwell upon,—who were not, after all, our chosen Aramintas;
                  and there was no end of three and four-paged notes written, in which Susan Ann
                  told Susan Jane that "never, never shall we forget the happy hours we 've spent
                  together on Cloudland hill,—never shall the hand of friendship grow cold, or the
                  heart of friendship cease to beat with emotion."</p>
               <p>Poor dear souls all of us! We meant every word that we said.</p>
               <p>It was only the other day that I called in a house on Beacon Street to see a fair
                  sister, to whom on this occasion I addressed a most pathetic note, and who sent me
                  a very pretty curl of golden-brown hair. Now she is Mrs. Boggs, and the sylph that
                  was is concealed under a most enormous matron; the room trembles when she sets her
                  foot down. But I found her heart in the centre of the ponderous mass, and, as I am
                  somewhat inclining to be a stout old gentleman, we shook the room with our
                  merriment. Such is life!</p>
               <p>The next day Tina was terribly out of spirits, and had two or three hours of long
                  and bitter crying, the cause of which none of our trio could get out of her.</p>
               <p>The morning that we were to leave she went around bidding good by to everybody and
                  everything, for there was not a creature in Cloudland that did not claim some part
                  in her, and for whom she had not a parting word. And, finally, I proposed that we
                  should go in to the schoolmaster together and have a last good time with him, and
                  then, with one of her sudden impulsive starts, she turned her back on me.</p>
               <p>"No, no, Horace! I don't want to see him any more!"</p>
               <p>I was in blank amazement for a moment, and then I remembered the correspondence on
                  the improvement of her mind.</p>
               <p>"Tina, you don't tell me," said I, "that Mr. Rossiter has—"</p>
               <p>She turned quickly round and faced on the defensive.</p>
               <p>"Now, Horace, you need not talk to me, for it is <emph>not my fault! Could</emph>
                  I dream of such a thing, now? <emph>Could</emph> I? Mr. Rossiter, of all the men
                  on earth! Why, Horace, I do love him dearly. I never had any father—that cared for
                  me, at least," she said, with a quiver in her voice; "and he was beginning to seem
                     so<pb n="506-507" xml:id="VAC7953-00000258"/> like a father to me. I loved him,
                  I respected him, I reverenced him,—and now was I wrong to express it?"</p>
               <p>"Why, but, Tina," said I, in amazement, "Mr. Rossiter cannot—he could not mean to
                  marry you!"</p>
               <p>"No, no. He says that he would not. He asked nothing. It all seemed to come out
                  before he thought what he was saying,—that he has been thinking altogether too
                  much of me, and that when I go it will seem as if <emph>all</emph> was gone that
                  he cares for. I can't tell you how he spoke, Horace; there was something fearful
                  in it, and he trembled. O Horace, he loves me nobly, disinterestedly, truly; but I
                  felt guilty for it. I felt that such a power of feeling never ought to rest on
                  such a bit of thistle-down as I am. Oh! why would n't he stay on the height where
                  I had put him, and let me reverence and admire him, and have him to love as my
                  father?"</p>
               <p>"But Tina, you cannot, you must not now—"</p>
               <p>"I know it, Horace. I have lost him for a friend and father and guide because he
                  will love me too well."</p>
               <p>And so ends Mr. Jonathan Rossiter's Spartan training.</p>
               <p>My good friends of the American Republic, if ever we come to have mingled among
                  the senators of the United States specimens of womankind like Tina Percival, we
                  men remaining such as we by nature are and must be, will not the general hue of
                  politics take a decidedly new and interesting turn?</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery parted from us with some last words of counsel.</p>
               <p>"You are going into college life, boys, and you must take care of your bodies.
                  Many a boy breaks down because he keeps his country appetite and loses his country
                  exercise. You must balance study and brain-work by exercise and muscle-work, or
                  you 'll be down with dyspepsia, and won't know what ails you. People have wondered
                  where the seat of original sin is; I think it 's in the stomach. A man eats too
                  much and neglects exercise, and the Devil has him all his own way, and the little
                  imps, with their long black fingers, play on his nerves like a piano. Never
                  overwork either body or mind, boys. All the work that a man can do that can be
                     <emph>rested by one night's sleep is good for him,</emph> but fatigue that goes
                  into the next day is always bad. Never get discouraged at difficulties. I give you
                  both this piece of advice. When you get into a tight place, and everything goes
                  against you till it seems as if you could n't hold on a minute longer, <emph>never
                     give up then,</emph> for that's just the place and time that the tide 'll turn.
                  Never trust to prayer without using every means in your power, and never use the
                  means without trusting in prayer. Get your evidences of grace by pressing forward
                  to the mark, and not by groping with a lantern after the boundary-lines,—and so,
                  boys, go, and God bless you!"</p>

               <head type="sub">WE ENTER COLLEGE.</head>
               <p>HARRY and I entered Cambridge with honor. It was a matter of pride with Mr.
                  Rossiter that his boys should go more than ready,—that an open and abundant
                  entrance should be administered unto them in the classic halls; and so it was with
                  us. We were fully prepared on the conditions of the sophomore year, and thus, by
                  Mr. Rossiter's drill, had saved the extra expenses of one year of college
                  life.</p>
               <p>We had our room in common, and Harry's improved means enabled him to fit it up and
                  embellish it in an attractive manner. Tina came over and presided at the
                  inauguration, and helped us hang our engravings, and fitted up various little
                  trifles of shell and moss work,—memorials of Cloudland.</p>
               <p>Tina was now visiting at the Kitterys', in Boston, dispensing smiles and sunbeams,
                  inquired after and run after by every son of Adam who happened to come in her way,
                  all to no purpose, so far as her heart was concerned. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Favors to none, to all she smiles extends;</l>
                        <l>Oft she rejects, but never once offends."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Tina's education was now, in the common understanding of society, looked upon as
                  finished. Harry's and mine were commencing; we were sophomores in college. She was
                  a young lady in society; yet she was younger than either of us, and had, I must
                  say, quite as good a mind, and was fully as capable of going through our college
                  course with us as of having walked thus far.</p>
               <p>However, with her the next question was, Whom will she marry?—a question that my
                  young lady seemed not in the slightest hurry to answer. I flattered myself on her
                  want of susceptibility that pointed in the direction of marriage. She could feel
                  so much friendship,—such true affection,—and yet was apparently so perfectly
                  devoid of passion.</p>
               <p>She was so brilliant, and so fitted to adorn society, that one would have thought
                  she would have been <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennuyée</foreign> in the old Rossiter
                  house, with only the society of Miss Mehitable and Polly; but Tina was one of
                  those whose own mind and nature are sufficient excitement to keep them always
                  burning. She loved her old friend with all her little heart, and gave to her all
                  her charms and graces, and wound round her in a wild-rose garland, like the
                  eglantine that she was named after.</p>
               <p>She had cultivated her literary tastes and powers. She wrote and sketched and
                  painted for Miss Mehitable, and Miss Mehitable was most appreciative. Her strong,
                  shrewd, well-cultivated mind felt and appreciated the worth and force of
                  everything there was in Tina, and Tina seemed perfectly happy and satisfied with
                  one devoted admirer. However, she had two, for Polly still survived, being of the
                  dry immortal species, and seemed, as Tina told her, quite as good as new. And Tina
                  once more had uproarious evenings with Miss Mehitable and Polly, delighting
                  herself with the tumults of laughter which she awakened.</p>
               <p>She visited and patronized Sam Lawson's children, gave them candy and told them
                  stories, and now and then brought home Hepsie's baby for a half-day, and would
                  busy herself dressing it up in something new of her own invention and
                  construction. Poor Hepsie was one of those women fated always to have a baby in
                  which she seemed to have no more maternal pleasure than an old fowling-piece. But
                  Tina looked at her on the good-natured and pitiful side, although, to be sure, she
                  did study her with a view to dramatic representation, and made no end of capital
                  of her in this way in the bosom of her own family.</p>
               <p>Tina's mimicry and mockery had not the slightest tinge of contempt or ill-feeling
                  in it; it was pure merriment, and seemed to be just as natural to her as the
                  freakish instincts of the mocking-bird, who sits in the blossoming boughs above
                  your head, and sends back every sound that you hear with a wild and airy
                  gladness.</p>
               <p>Tina's letters to us were full of this mirthful, effervescent<pb n="510-511"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000260"/> sparkle, to which everything in Oldtown afforded
                  matter of amusement; and the margins of them were scrawled with droll and lifelike
                  caricatures, in which we recognized Sam Lawson, and Hepsie, and Uncle Fliakim,
                  and, in fact, all the Oldtown worthies,—not even excepting Miss Mehitable and
                  Polly, the minister and his lady, my grandmother, Aunt Lois, and Aunt Keziah. What
                  harm was there in all this, when Tina assured us that aunty read the letters
                  before they went, and laughed until she cried over them?</p>
               <p>"But, after all," I said to Harry one day, "it 's rather a steep thing for girls
                  that have kept step with us in study up to this point, and had their minds braced
                  just as ours have been, with all the drill of regular hours and regular lessons,
                  to be suddenly let down, with nothing in particular to do."</p>
               <p>"Except to wait the coming man," said Harry, "who is to teach her what to do."</p>
               <p>"Well," said I, "in the interval, while this man is coming, what has Tina to do
                  but to make a frolic of life?—to live like a bobolink on a clover-head, to sparkle
                  like a dewdrop in a thorn-bush, to whirl like a bubble on a stream? Why could n't
                  she as well find the coming man while she is doing something as while she is doing
                  nothing? Esther and you found each other while you were <emph>working</emph> side
                  by side, your minds lively and braced, toiling at the same great ideas, knowing
                  each other in the very noblest part of your natures; and you are true companions;
                  it is a mating of <emph>souls</emph> and not merely of bodies."</p>
               <p>"I know that," said Harry, "I know, too, that in these very things that I set my
                  heart on in the college course Esther is by far my superior. You know, Horace,
                  that she was ahead of us in both Greek and mathematics; and why should she not go
                  through the whole course with us as well as the first part? The fact is, a man
                  never sees a subject thoroughly until he sees what a woman will think of it, for
                  there is a woman's view of every subject, which has a different shade from a man's
                  view, and that is what you and I have insensibly been absorbing in all our course
                  hitherto. How splendidly Esther lighted up some of those passages of the Greek
                  tragedy! and what a sparkle and glitter there were in some of Tina's suggestions!
                  All I know, Horace, is that it is confoundedly dull being without them; these
                  fellows are well enough, but they are cloddish and lumpish."</p>
               <p>"Well," said I, "that is n't the worst of it. When such a gay creature of the
                  elements as Tina is has nothing earthly to do to steady her mind and task her
                  faculties, and her life becomes a mere glitter, and her only business to amuse the
                  passing hour, it throws her open to all sorts of temptations from that coming man,
                  whoever he may be. Can we wonder that girls love to flirt, and try their power on
                  lovers? And then they are fair game for men who want to try their powers on them,
                  and some man who has a vacation in his life purpose, and wants something to amuse
                  him, makes an episode by getting up some little romance, which is an amusement to
                  him, but all in all to her. Is that fair?"</p>
               <p>"True," said Harry, "and there 's everything about Tina to tempt one; she is so
                  dazzling and bewildering and exciting that a man might intoxicate himself with her
                  for the mere pleasure of the thing, as one takes opium or champagne; and that sort
                  of bewilderment and intoxication girls often mistake for love! I would to Heaven,
                  Horace, that I were as sure that Tina loves you as I am that Esther loves me."</p>
               <p>"She does love me with her <emph>heart,</emph>" said I, "but not with her
                  imagination. The trouble with Tina, Harry, is this: she is a woman that can really
                  and truly love a man as a sister, or as a friend, or as a daughter, and she is a
                  woman that no man can love in that way long. She feels nothing but affection, and
                  she always creates passion. I have not the slightest doubt that she loves me
                  dearly, but I have a sort of vision that between her and me will come some one who
                  will kindle her imagination; and all the more so that she has nothing serious to
                  do, nothing to keep her mind braced, and her intellectual and judging faculties in
                  the ascendant, but is fairly set adrift, just like a little flowery boat, without
                  steersman or oars, on a bright, swift-rushing river. Did you ever notice, Harry,
                  what a singular effect Ellery Davenport seems to have on her?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Harry, starting and looking surprised. "Why, Horace, Ellery Davenport
                  is a good deal older than she is, and a married man too."</p>
               <pb n="512-513" xml:id="VAC7953-00000261"/>
               <p>"Well, Harry, did n't you ever hear of married men that liked to try experiments
                  with girls? and in our American society they can do it all the more safely,
                  because here, thank Heaven! nobody ever dreams but what marriage is a perfect
                  regulator and safeguard."</p>
               <p>"But," said Harry, rubbing his eyes like a person just waking up, "Horace, it must
                  be the mere madness of jealousy that would put such a thing into your head. Why,
                  there has n't been the slightest foundation for it."</p>
               <p>"That is to say, Harry, you 've been in love with Esther, and your eyes and ears
                  and senses have all run one way. But I have lived in Tina, and I believe I have a
                  sort of divining power, so that I can almost see into her heart. I <emph>feel in
                     myself</emph> how things affect her, and I <emph>know,</emph> by feeling and
                  sensation, that from her childhood Ellery Davenport has had a peculiar magnetic
                  effect upon her."</p>
               <p>"But, Horace, he is a married man," persisted Harry.</p>
               <p>"A fascinating married man, victimized by a crazy wife, and ready to throw himself
                  on the sympathies of womanhood in this affliction. The fair sex are such Good
                  Samaritans that some fellows make capital of their wounds and bruises."</p>
               <p>"Well, but," said Harry, "there 's not the slightest thing that leads me to think
                  that he ever cared particularly about Tina."</p>
               <p>"That's because you are Tina's brother, and not her lover," said I. "I remember as
                  long ago as when we were children, spending Easter at Madam Kittery's, how Ellery
                  Davenport's eyes used to follow her,—how she used constantly to seem to excite and
                  interest him; and all this zeal about your affairs, and his coming up to Oldtown,
                  and cultivating Miss Mehitable's acquaintance so zealously, and making himself so
                  necessary to her; and then he has always been writing letters or sending messages
                  to Tina, and then, when he was up in Cloudland, did n't you see how constantly his
                  eyes followed her? He came there for nothing but to see her,—I 'm perfectly sure
                  of it."</p>
               <p>"Well, Horace, you are about as absurd as a lover need be!" said Harry. "Mr.
                  Davenport is rather a conceited man of the world; I think he patronized me
                  somewhat extensively; but all this about Tina is a romance of your own spinning,
                  you may be sure of it."</p>
               <p>This conversation occurred one Saturday morning, while we were dressing and
                  arraying ourselves to go into Boston, where we had engaged to dine at Madam
                  Kittery's.</p>
               <p>From the first of our coming to Cambridge, we had remembered our old-time
                  friendship for the Kitterys, and it was an arranged thing that we were to dine
                  with them every Saturday. The old Kittery mansion we had found the same still,
                  charming, quaint, inviting place that it seemed to us in our childhood. The years
                  that had passed over the silvery head of dear old Madam Kittery had passed lightly
                  and reverently, each one leaving only a benediction.</p>
               <p>She was still to be found, when we called, seated, as in days long ago, on her
                  little old sofa in the sunny window, and with her table of books before her,
                  reading her Bible and Dr. Johnson, and speaking on "Peace and good-will to
                  men."</p>
               <p>As to Miss Debby, she was as up and down, as high-stepping and outspoken and
                  pleasantly sub-acid as ever. The French Revolution had put her in a state of
                  good-humor hardly to be conceived of. It was so delightful to have all her
                  theories of the bad effects of republics on lower classes illustrated and
                  confirmed in such a striking manner, that even her indignation at the destruction
                  of such vast numbers of the aristocracy was but a slight feature in comparison
                  with it.</p>
               <p>She kept the newspapers and magazines at hand which contained all the accounts of
                  the massacres, mobbings, and outrages, and read them, in a high tone of voice, to
                  her serving-women, butler, and footman after family prayers. She catechized more
                  energetically than ever, and bore more stringently on ordering one's self lowly
                  and reverently to one's betters, enforcing her remarks by the blood-and-thunder
                  stories of the guillotine in France.</p>
               <p>We were hardly seated in the house, and had gone over the usual track of inquiries
                  which fill up the intervals, when she burst forth on us, triumphant.</p>
               <pb n="514-515" xml:id="VAC7953-00000262"/>
               <p>"Well, my English papers have come in. Have you seen the last news from France?
                  They 're at it yet, hotter than ever. One would think that murdering the king and
                  queen might have satisfied them, but it don't a bit. Everybody is at it now,
                  cutting everybody's else throat, and there really does seem to be a prospect that
                  the whole French nation will become extinct."</p>
               <p>"Indeed," said Harry, with an air of amusement. "Well, Miss Debby, I suppose you
                  think that would be the best way of settling things."</p>
               <p>"Don't know but it would," said Miss Debby, putting on her spectacles in a manner
                  which pushed her cap-border up into a bristling, helmet-like outline, and whirling
                  over her file of papers, seemingly with a view to edifying us with the most
                  startling morsels of French history for the six months past.</p>
               <p>"Here's the account of how they worshipped 'the Goddess of Reason'!" she cried,
                  eying us fiercely, as if we had been part and party in the transaction. "Here's
                  all about how their philosophers and poets, and what not, put up a drab, and
                  worshipped her as their 'Goddess of Reason'! And then they annulled the Sabbath,
                  and proclaimed that 'Death is an Eternal Sleep'! Now, that is just what Tom
                  Jefferson likes; it's what suits him. I read it to Ellery Davenport yesterday, to
                  show him what his principles come to."</p>
               <p>Harry immediately hastened to assure Miss Debby that we were stanch Federalists,
                  and not in the least responsible for any of the acts or policy of Thomas
                  Jefferson.</p>
               <p>"Don't know anything about that; you see it's the Democrats that have got the
                  country, and are running as hard as they can after France. Ah, here it is," Miss
                  Debby added, still turning over her files of papers. "Here are the particulars of
                  the execution of the queen. You can see,—they had her on a common cart, hands tied
                  behind her, rattling and jolting, with all the vile fishwomen and dirty drabs of
                  Paris leering and jeering at her, and they even had the cruelty," she added,
                  coming indignantly at us as if we were responsible for it, "to stop the cart in
                  front of her palace, so that she might be agonized at seeing her former home, and
                  they might taunt her in her agonies! Anybody that can read that, and not say the
                  French are devils, I'd like to know what they are made of!"</p>
               <p>"Well," said Harry, undismayed by the denunciations; "the French are an
                  exceedingly sensitive and excitable people, who had been miseducated and
                  mismanaged, and taught brutality and cruelty by the examples of the clergy and
                  nobility."</p>
               <p>"Excitable fiddlesticks!" said Miss Debby, who, like my grandmother, had this
                  peculiar way of summing up an argument. "I don't believe in softening sin and
                  iniquity by such sayings as that."</p>
               <p>"But you must think," said Harry, "that the French are human beings, and only act
                  as any human beings would under their circumstances."</p>
               <p>"Don't believe a word of it!" said she, shortly. "I agree with the man who said,
                  'God made two kinds of nature,—human nature and French nature.' Voltaire, was n't
                  it, himself, that said the French were a compound of the tiger and the monkey? I
                  wonder what Tom Jefferson thinks of his beautiful, darling French Republic now! I
                  presume he likes it. I don't doubt it is just such a state of things as he is
                  trying to bring to pass here in America."</p>
               <p>"O," said I, "the Federalists will head him at the next election."</p>
               <p>"I don't know anything about your Democrats and your Federalists," said she. "I
                  thank Heaven I wash my hands of this government."</p>
               <p>"And does King George still reign here?" said Harry.</p>
               <p>"Certainly he does, young gentleman! Whatever happens to <emph>this</emph>
                  government, <emph>I</emph> have no part in it."</p>
               <p>Miss Debby, upon this, ushered us to the dinner-table, and said grace in a
                  resounding and belligerent voice, and, sitting down, began to administer the soup
                  to us with great determination.</p>
               <p>Old Madam Kittery, who had listened with a patient smile to all the preceding
                  conversation, now began in a gentle aside to me.</p>
               <p>"I really don't think it is good for Debby to read those bloody-bone<pb
                     n="516-517" xml:id="VAC7953-00000263"/> bone stories morning, noon, and night,
                  as she does," she said. "She really almost takes away my appetite some days, and
                  it does seem as if she would n't talk about anything else. Now, Horace," she said
                  to me, appealingly, "the Bible says 'Charity rejoiceth not in iniquity,' and I
                  can't help feeling that Debby talks as if she were really glad to see those poor
                  French making such a mess of things. I can't feel so. If they are French, they 're
                  our brothers, you know, and Debby really seems to go against the Bible,—not that
                  she means to, dear," she added, earnestly, laying her hand on mine; "Debby is an
                  excellent woman;but, between you and me, I think she is a little excitable."</p>
               <p>"What 's that mother 's saying?" said Miss Debby, who kept a strict survey over
                  all the sentiments expressed in her household. "What was mother saying?"</p>
               <p>"I was saying, Debby, that I did n't think it did any good for you to keep reading
                  over and over those dreadful things."</p>
               <p>"And who does keep reading them over?" said Miss Debby, "I should like to know. I
                  'm sure I don't; except when it is absolutely necessary to instruct the servants
                  and put them on their guard. I 'm sure I am as averse to such details as anybody
                  can be."</p>
               <p>Miss Debby said this with that innocent air with which good sort of people very
                  generally maintain that they never do things which most of their acquaintances
                  consider them particular nuisances for doing.</p>
               <p>"By the by, Horace," said Miss Debby, by way of changing the subject, "have you
                  seen Ellery Davenport since he came home?"</p>
               <p>"No," said I, with a sudden feeling as if my heart was sinking down into my boots.
                  "Has he come home to stay?"</p>
               <p>"O yes," said Miss Debby; "his dear, sweet, model, Republican France grew too hot
                  to hold him. He had to flee to England, and now he has concluded to come home and
                  make what mischief he can here, with his democratic principles and his Rousseau
                  and all the rest of them."</p>
               <p>"Debby is n't as set against Ellery as she seems to be," said the old lady, in an
                  explanatory aside to me. "You know, dear, he 's her cousin."</p>
               <p>"And you really think he intends to live in this country for the future?" said
                  I.</p>
               <p>"Well, I suppose so," said Miss Debby. "You know that poor, miserable, crazy wife
                  of his is dead, and my lord is turned loose on society as a widower at large, and
                  all the talk here in good circles is, Who is the blessed woman that shall be Mrs.
                  Ellery Davenport the second? The girls are all pulling caps for him, of
                  course."</p>
               <p>It was perfectly ridiculous and absurd, but I suddenly lost all appetite for my
                  dinner, and sat back in my chair playing with my knife and fork, until the old
                  lady said to me compassionately:—</p>
               <p>"Why, dear, you don't seem to be eating anything! Debby, put an oyster-<foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">paté</foreign> on Horace's plate; he don't seem to relish his
                  chicken."</p>
               <p>I had to submit to the oyster-<foreign xml:lang="FRA">paté</foreign>, and sit up
                  and eat it like a man, to avoid the affectionate importunity of my dear old
                  friend. In despair, I plunged into the subject least agreeable to me, and
                  remarked:—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Davenport is a very brilliant man, and I suppose in very good circumstances;
                  is he not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, enormously rich," said Miss Debby. "He still passes for young, with that
                  face of his that never will grow old, I believe. And then he has a tongue that
                  could wheedle a bird out of a tree; so I don't know what is to hinder him from
                  having as many wives as Solomon, if he feels so disposed. I don't imagine there is
                  anybody would say 'No' to him."</p>
               <p>"Well, I hope he will marry a good girl," said the old lady, "poor dear boy. I
                  always loved Ellery; and he would make any woman happy, I am sure."</p>
               <p>"That depends," said Miss Debby, "on what the woman wants. If she wants laces and
                  cashmere shawls, and horses and carriages, and a fine establishment, Ellery
                  Davenport will give her those. But if she wants a man to love her all her life,
                  that's what Ellery Davenport can't do for any woman. He is a man<pb n="518-519"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000264"/> that never cares for anything he has got. It's
                  always the thing that he has n't got that he 's after. It 's the 'pot of money at
                  the end of the rainbow,' or the 'philosopher's stone,' or any other thing that
                  keeps a man all his life on a canter, and never getting anywhere. And no woman
                  will ever be anything to him but a temporary diversion. He can amuse himself in
                  too many ways to want <emph>her</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the old lady, "but when a man marries he promises to cherish her."</p>
               <p>"My dear mother, that is in the Church Service, and I assure you Ellery Davenport
                  has got beyond that. He 's altogether too fine and wise and enlightened to think
                  that a man should spend his days in cherishing a woman merely because he went
                  through the form of marriage with her in church. Much cherishing his crazy wife
                  got of him! but he used his affliction to get half a dozen girls in love with him,
                  so that he might be cherished himself. I tell you what,—Ellery Davenport lays out
                  to marry a real angel. He's to swear and she 's to pray! He is to wander where he
                  likes, and she is always to meet him with a smile and ask no questions. That is
                  the part for Mrs Ellery Davenport to act."</p>
               <p>"I don't believe a word of it, Debby," said the old lady. "You'll see now,—you'll
                  see."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLI.</head>
               <head type="sub">NIGHT TALKS.</head>
               <p>WE walked home that night by starlight, over the long bridge between Boston and
                  Cambridge, and watched the image of the great round yellow moon just above the
                  horizon, breaking and shimmering in the water into a thousand crystal fragments,
                  like an orb of golden glass. We stopped midway in the calm obscurity, with our
                  arms around each other, and had one of those long talks that friends, even the
                  most confidential, can have only in the darkness. Cheek to cheek under the soft
                  dim mantle of the starlight, the night flowers of the innermost soul open.</p>
               <p>We talked of our loves, our hopes, of the past, the present, and the great
                  hereafter, in which we hoped forever to mingle. And then Harry spoke to me of his
                  mother, and told in burning words of that life of bitterness and humiliation and
                  sorrow through which he had passed with her.</p>
               <p>"O Harry," said I, "did it not try your faith, that God should have left her to
                  suffer all that?"</p>
               <p>"No, Horace, no, because in all that suffering she conquered,—she was more than
                  conqueror. O, I have seen such divine peace in her eyes, at the very time when
                  everything earthly was failing her! Can I ever doubt? I who saw into heaven when
                  she entered? No, I have seen her crowned, glorified, in my soul as plainly as if
                  it had been a vision."</p>
               <p>At that moment I felt in myself that magnetic vibration of the great central
                  nerves which always prefaced my spiritual visions, and looking up I saw that the
                  beautiful woman I had seen once before was standing by Harry, but now more glowing
                  and phosphorescent than I saw her last; there was a divine, sweet, awful radiance
                  in her eyes, as she raised her hands above his head, he, meanwhile, stooping down
                  and looking intently into the water.</p>
               <pb n="520-521" xml:id="VAC7953-00000265"/>
               <p>"Harry," said I, after a few moments of silence, "do you believe your mother sees
                  and knows what you do in this world, and watches over you?"</p>
               <p>"That has always been one of those things that I have believed without reasoning,"
                  said Harry, musingly. "I never could help believing it; and there have been times
                  in my life when I felt so certain that she must be near me, that it seemed as
                  though, if I spoke, she must answer,—if I reached out my hand, it would touch
                  hers. It is one of my instinctive certainties, It is curious," he added, "that the
                  difference between Esther and myself is just the reverse kind of that which
                  generally subsists between man and woman. She has been all her life so drilled in
                  what logicians call reasoning, that, although she has a glorious semi-spiritual
                  nature, and splendid moral instincts, she never trusts them. She is like an eagle
                  that should insist upon climbing a mountain by beak and claw instead of using
                  wings. She must always see the syllogism before she will believe."</p>
               <p>"For my part," said I, "I have always felt the tyranny of the hard New England
                  logic, and it has kept me from really knowing what to believe about many phenomena
                  of my own mind that are vividly real to me." Here I faltered and hesitated, and
                  the image that seemed to stand by us slowly faded. I could not and did not say to
                  Harry how often I had seen it.</p>
               <p>"After all I have heard and thought on this subject," said Harry, "my religious
                  faith is what it always was,—a deep, instinctive certainty, an embrace by the soul
                  of <emph>something</emph> which it could not exist without. My early recollections
                  are stronger than anything else of perfect and utter helplessness, of troubles
                  entirely beyond all human aid. My father—" He stopped and shuddered. "Horace, he
                  was one of those whom intemperance makes mad. For a great part of his time he was
                  a madman, with all the cunning, all the ingenuity, the devilishness of insanity,
                  and I have had to stand between him and my mother, and to hide Tina out of his
                  way." He seemed to shudder as one convulsed. "One does not get over such a
                  childhood," he said. "It has made all my religious views, my religious faith, rest
                  on two ideas,—man's helplessness, and God's helpfulness. We are sent into this
                  world in the midst of a blind, confused jangle of natural laws, which we cannot by
                  any possibility understand, and which cut their way through and over and around
                  us. They tell us nothing; they have no sympathy; they hear no prayer; they spare
                  neither vice nor virtue. And if we have no friend above to guide us through the
                  labyrinth, if there is no Father's heart, no helping hand, of what use is life? I
                  would throw myself into this river, and have it over with at once."</p>
               <p>"I always noticed your faith in prayer," said I. "But how can it consist with this
                  known inflexibility of natural laws?"</p>
               <p>"And what if natural laws were meant as servants of man's moral life? What if
                  Jesus Christ and his redeeming, consoling work were the <emph>first</emph> thing,
                  and all things made by him for this end? Inflexible physical laws are necessary;
                  their very inflexibility is divine order; but 'what law cannot do, in that it is
                  weak through the flesh, God did by sending his Son in the likeness of sinful
                  flesh.' Christ delivers us from slavery to natural law; he comes to embody and
                  make visible the paternal idea; and if you and I, with our small knowledge of
                  physical laws, can so turn and arrange them that their inflexible course shall
                  help, and not hinder, much more can their Maker."</p>
               <p>"You always speak of Christ as God."</p>
               <p>"I have never thought of God in any other way," he answered. "Christ is the God of
                  sufferers; and those who learn religion by sorrow always turn to him. No other
                  than a suffering God could have helped my mother in her anguish."</p>
               <p>"And do you think," said I, "that prayer is a clew strong enough to hold amid the
                  rugged realities of life?"</p>
               <p>"I do," said Harry. "At any rate, there is my great venture; that is my
                  life-experiment. My mother left me that as her only legacy."</p>
               <p>"It certainly seems to have worked well for you so far, Harry," said I, "and for
                  me too, for God has guided us to what we scarcely could have hoped for, two poor
                  boys as we were, and so utterly helpless. But then, Harry, there must be a great
                  many prayers that are never answered."</p>
               <p>"Of course," said Harry, "I do not suppose that God has put<pb n="522-523"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000266"/> the key of all the universe into the hand of every
                  child; but it is a comfort to have a Father to ask of, even though he refuse five
                  times out of six, and it makes all the difference between having a father and
                  being an orphan. Yes," he added, after a few moments of thought, "my poor mother's
                  prayers seemed often to be denied, for she prayed that my father might reform. She
                  often prayed from day to day that we might be spared miseries that he still
                  brought upon us. But I feel sure that she has seen by this time that her Father
                  heard the prayers that he seemed to deny, and her faith in him never failed. What
                  is that music?" he said.</p>
               <p>At this moment there came softly over the gleaming water, from the direction of
                  the sea, the faintest possible vibration of a sound, like the dying of an organ
                  tone. It might be from some ship, hidden away far off in the mist, but the effect
                  was soft and dreamy as if it came from some spirit-land.</p>
               <p>"I often think," said Harry, listening for a moment, "that no one can pronounce on
                  what this life has been to him until he has passed entirely through it, and turns
                  around and surveys it from the other world. I think then we shall see everything
                  in its true proportions; but till then we must walk by faith and not by
                  sight,—faith that God loves us, faith that our Saviour is always near us, and that
                  all things are working together for good."</p>
               <p>"Harry," said I, "do you ever think of your father now?"</p>
               <p>"Horace, there is where I wish I could be a more perfect Christian than I am. I
                  have a bitter feeling toward him, that I fear is not healthful, and that I pray
                  God to take away. To-night, since we have been standing here, I have had a
                  strange, remorseful feeling about him, as if some good spirit were interceding for
                  him with me, and trying to draw me to love and forgive him. I shall never see him,
                  probably, until I meet him in the great Hereafter, and then, perhaps, I shall find
                  that her prayers have prevailed for him."</p>
               <p>It was past twelve o'clock when we got to our room that night, and Harry found
                  lying on his table a great sealed package from England. He opened it and found in
                  it, first, a letter from his father, Sir Harry Percival. The letter was as
                  follows:—</p>

                              ashamed to write. I did not do right by your mother, nor by you and
                              your sister, as I am now free to acknowledge. She was not of a family
                              equal to ours, but she was too good for me. I left her in America,
                              like a brute as I was, and God has judged me for it.</p>
                           <p>"I married the woman my father picked out for me, when I came home,
                              and resolved to pull up and live soberly like a decent man. But
                              nothing went well with me. My children died one after another; my boy
                              lived to be seven years old, but he was feeble, and now he is dead
                              too, and you are the heir. I am thinking that I am an old sinner, and
                              in a bad way. Have had two turns of gout in the stomach that went hard
                              with me, and the doctor don't think I shall stand many such. I have
                              made my will with a provision for the girl, and you will have the
                              estate in course. I do wish you would come over and see a poor old
                              sinner before he dies. It is n't in the least jolly being here, and I
                              am dev'lish cross, they say. I suppose I am, but if you were minded to
                              come I'd try and behave myself, and so make amends for what 's past
                              beyond recall.</p>

               <p>Accompanying this letter was a letter from the family lawyer, stating that on the
                  18th day of the month past Sir Harry Percival had died of an attack of gout. The
                  letter went on to give various particulars about the state of the property, and
                  the steps which had been taken in relation to it, and expressing the hope that the
                  arrangements made would meet with his approbation.</p>
               <p>It may well be imagined that it was almost morning before we closed our eyes,
                  after so very startling a turn in our affairs. We lay long discussing it in every
                  possible light, and now first I found courage to tell Harry of my own peculiar
                  experiences, and of what I had seen that very evening. "It seems to me," said<pb

                  I <emph>felt</emph> what you saw. I had a consciousness of a sympathetic presence,
                  something breathing over me like wind upon harp-strings, something particularly
                  predisposing me to think kindly of my father. My feeling towards him has been the
                  weak spot of my inner life always, and I had a morbid horror of him. Now I feel at
                  peace with him. Perhaps her prayers have prevailed to save him from utter
                  ruin."</p>

               <head type="sub">SPRING VACATION AT OLDTOWN.</head>
               <p>IT was the spring vacation, and Harry and I were coming again to Oldtown; and ten
                  miles back, where we changed horses, we had left the crawling old Boston stage and
                  took a footpath through a patch of land known as the Spring Pasture. Our road lay
                  pleasantly along the brown, sparkling river, which was now just waked up, after
                  its winter nap, as fussy and busy and chattering as a housekeeper that has
                  overslept herself. There were downy catkins on the willows, and the water-maples
                  were throwing out their crimson tassels. The sweet-flag was just showing its green
                  blades above the water, and here and there, in nooks, there were yellow cowslips
                  reflecting their bright gold faces in the dark water.</p>
               <p>Harry and I had walked this way that we might search under the banks and among the
                  dried leaves for the white waxen buds and flowers of the trailing arbutus. We were
                  down on our knees, scraping the leaves away, when a well-known voice came from
                  behind the bushes.</p>
               <p>"Wal, lordy massy, boys! Here ye be! Why, I ben up to Siah's tahvern, an' looked
                  inter the stage, an' did n't see yer. I jest thought I'd like to come an' kind o'
                  meet yer. Lordy massy, they 's all a lookin' out for yer 't all the winders; 'n'
                  Aunt Lois, she 's ben bilin' up no end o' doughnuts, an' tearin' round 'nough to
                  drive the house out o' the winders, to git everything ready for ye. Why, it beats
                  the Prodigal Son all holler, the way they 're killin' the fatted calves for yer;
                  an' everybody in Oldtown 's a wantin' to see Sir Harry."</p>
               <p>"O nonsense, Sam!" said Harry, coloring. "Hush about that! We don't have titles
                  over here in America."</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, that 's just what I wus a tellin' on 'em up to store. It's a pity,
                  ses I, this yere happened arter peace was<pb n="526-527" xml:id="VAC7953-00000268"

                  think Lady Lothrop, she kind o' thinks so too."</p>
               <p>"O nonsense!" said Harry. "Sam, are the folks all well?"</p>
               <p>"O lordy massy, yes! Chirk and chipper as can be. An' there 's Tiny, they say she
                  's a goin' to be an heiress nowadays, an' there 's no end of her beaux. There's
                  Ellery Devenport ben down here these two weeks, a puttin' up at the tahvern, with
                  a landau an' a span o' crack horses, a takin' on her out to ride every day, and
                  Miss Mehitable, she 's so sot up, she 's reelly got a brannew bonnet, an' left off
                  that 'ere old un o' hern that she 's had trimmed over spring an' fall goin' on
                  these 'ere ten years. I thought that 'ere bonnet 's going to last out my time, but
                  I see it hain't. An' she 's got a new Injy shawl, that Mr. Devenport gin her. Yeh
                  see, he understan's courtin', all round."</p>
               <p>This intelligence, of course, was not the most agreeable to me. I hope, my good
                  friends, that you have never known one of those quiet hours of life, when, while
                  you are sitting talking and smiling, and to all appearance quite unmoved, you hear
                  a remark or learn a fact that seems to operate on you as if somebody had quietly
                  turned a faucet that was letting out your very life. Down, down, down, everything
                  seems sinking, the strength passing away from you as the blood passes when an
                  artery is cut. It was with somewhat this sensation that I listened to Sam's
                  chatter, while I still mechanically poked away the leaves and drew out the long
                  waxy garlands that I had been gathering for <emph>her!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Sam seated himself on the bank, and, drawing his knees up to his chin and clasping
                  his hands upon them, began moralizing in his usual strain.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, lordy massy, what a changin' world this 'ere is! It's jest see-saw,
                  teeter-tawter, up an' down. To-day it 's I 'm up an' you 're down, an' to-morrow
                  it 's you 're up and I 'm down! An' then, by an' by, death comes an' takes us all.

                  we all gits called in our turn. We hain't here no continuin' city."</p>
               <p>"But, Sam," said I, "how does business get along? Have n't you anything to do but
                  tramp the pastures and moralize?"</p>
               <p>"Wal," said Sam, "I 've hed some pretty consid'able spells of blacksmithin'
                  lately. There 's Mr. Devenport, he 's sech a pleasant-spoken man, he told me he
                  brought his team all the way up from Bostin a purpose so that I might 'tend to
                  their huffs. I 've ben a shoein' on 'em fresh all round, an' the off horse, he 'd
                  kind o' got a crack in his huff, an' I 've been a doctorin' on 't; an' Mr.
                  Devenport, he said he had n't found nobody that knew how to doctor a horse's huffs
                  ekal to me. Very pleasant-spoken man Mr. Devenport is; he 's got a good word for
                  everybody. They say there ain't no end to his fortin, an' he goes a flingin' on 't
                  round, right an' left, like a prince. Why, when I'd done shoein' his hosses, he
                  jest put his hand inter his pocket an' handed me out ten dollars! ripped it out,
                  he did, jest as easy as water runs! But there was Tiny a standin' by; I think she
                  kind o' sot him on. O lordy massy, it 's plain to be seen that <emph>she</emph>
                  rules him. It 's all cap in hand to her, an' 'What you will, madam,' an' 'Will ye
                  have the end o' the rainbow, or a slice out o' the moon, or what is it?' It 's all
                  ekal to him, so as Miss Tiny wants it. Lordy massy," he said, lowering his voice
                  confidentially to Harry, "course these 'ere things is all temporal, an' our hearts
                  ought n't to be too much sot on 'em; still he 's got about the most amazin' fortin
                  there is round Bostin. Why, if you b'lieve me, 'tween you an' me, it 's him as
                  owns the Dench Place, where you and Tiny put up when you wus children! Don't ye
                  'member when I found ye? Ye little guessed whose house ye wus a puttin' up at
                  then; did yer? Lordy massy, lordy massy, who 'd ha' thought it? The wonderful ways
                  of Providence! 'He setteth the poor on high, an' letteth the runagates continoo in
                  scarceness.' Wal, wal, it 's a kind o' instructive world."</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose," said Harry to me, in a low voice, "that this creature knows
                  anything of what he is saying?"</p>
               <pb n="528-529" xml:id="VAC7953-00000269"/>
               <p>"I 'm afraid he does," said I. "Sam seems to have but one talent, and that is
                  picking up news; and generally his guesses turn out to be about true."</p>
               <p>"Sam," said I, by way of getting him to talk of something else, rather than on
                  what I dreaded to hear, "you have n't said a word about Hepsy and the children.
                  How are they all?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, the young uns hes all got the whoopin' cough," said Sam, "an' I'm e'en
                  a'most beat out with 'em. For fust it 's one barks, an' then another, an' then all
                  together. An' then Hepsy, she gets riled, an' she scolds; an', take it all
                  together, a feller's head gits kind o' turned. When ye hes a lot o' young uns,
                  there 's allus suthin' a goin' on among 'em; ef 't ain't whoopin' cough, it 's
                  measles; an' ef 't ain't measles, it 's chicken-pox, or else it 's mumps, or
                  scarlet-fever, or suthin'. They 's all got to be gone through, fust an' last. It
                  's enough to wean a body from this world. Lordy massy, yest'day arternoon I see
                  yer Aunt Keziah an' yer Aunt Lois out a cuttin' cowslip greens t'other side o' th'
                  river, an' the sun it shone so bright, an' the turtles an' frogs they kind o'
                  peeped so pleasant, an' yer aunts they sot on the bank so kind o' easy an' free,
                  an' I stood there a lookin' on 'em, an' I could n't help a thinkin', 'Lordy massy,
                  I wish t' I wus an old maid.' Folks 'scapes a great deal that don't hev no young
                  uns a hangin' onter 'em."</p>
               <p>"Well, Sam," said Harry, "is n't there any news stirring round in the
                  neighborhood?"</p>
               <p>"S'pose ye hain't heerd about the great church-quarrel over to Needmore?" he
                  said.</p>
               <p>"Quarrel? Why, no," said Harry. "What is it about?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, ye see, there 's a kind o' quarrel ris 'tween Parson Perry and Deacon Bangs.
                  I can't jest git the right on 't, but it 's got the hull town afire. I b'lieve it
                  cum up in a kind o' dispute how to spell Saviour. The Deacon he 's on the
                  school-committee, an' Parson Perry he 's on 't; an' the Deacon he spells it <hi
                     rend="i"/>iour, an' Parson Perry he spells it <hi rend="i"/>ior, an' they would
                  n't neither on 'em give up. Wal, ye know Deacon Bangs,—I <emph>s'pose</emph> he 's
                  a Christian,—but, lordy massy, he 's one o' yer dreadful ugly kind o' Christians,
                  that, when they gits their backs up, will do worse things than sinners will. I
                  reelly think they kind o' take advantage o' their position, an' think, es they're
                  goin' to be saved by grace, grace shell hev enough on 't. Now, to my mind, ef
                  either on 'em wus to give way, the Deacon oughter give up to the Parson; but the
                  Deacon he don't think so. Between you and me," said Sam, "it 's my opinion that ef
                  Ma 'am Perry hed n't died jest when she did, this 'ere thing would never ha'
                  growed to where 't is. But ye see Ma'am Perry she died, an' that left Parson Perry
                  a widower, an' folks did talk about him an' Mahaley Bangs, an' fact was, 'long
                  about last spring, Deacon Bangs an' Mis' Bangs an' Mahaley wus jest as thick with
                  the Parson as they could be. Why, Granny Watkins told me about their havin' on him
                  to tea two an' three times a week, an' Mahaley 'd make two kinds o' cake, an' they
                  'd have preserved watermelon rinds an' peaches an' cranberry saace, an' then 't
                  was all sugar an' all sweet, an' the Deacon he talked 'bout raisin' Parson Perry's
                  salary. Wal, then, ye see, Parson Perry he went over to Oldtown an' married
                  Jerushy Peabody. Now, Jerushy 's a nice, pious gal, an' it 's a free country, an'
                  parsons hes a right to suit 'emselves as well 's other men. But Jake Marshall, he
                  ses to me, when he heerd o' that, ses he, 'They 'll be findin' fault with Parson
                  Perry's doctrines now afore two months is up; ye see if they don't.' Wal, sure
                  enuff, this 'ere quarrel 'bout spellin' Saviour come on fust, an' Deacon Bangs he
                  fit the Parson like a bulldog. An' next town-meetin' day he told Parson Perry
                  right out before everybody thet he was wuss then 'n Armenian,—thet he was a rank
                  Pelagian; 'n' he said there was folks thet hed taken notes o' his sermons for two
                  years back, 'n' they could show thet he hed n't preached the real doctrine of
                  total depravity, nor 'riginal sin, an' thet he 'd got the plan o' salvation out o'
                  j'int intirely; he was all kind o' flattin' out onter morality. An' Parson Perry
                  he sed he 'd preached jest 's he allers hed. 'Tween you 'n' me, we know he
                     <emph>must</emph> ha' done that, 'cause these 'ere ministers thet hev to go
                  preachin' round 'n' round like a hoss in a cider-mill,—wal, <emph>course</emph>
                  they <emph>must</emph> preach the same sermons over. I s'pose they kind o' trim
                  'em up with new collars 'n' wris'bands. But we used to say thet Parson<pb
                     n="530-531" xml:id="VAC7953-00000270"/> Lothrop hed a bar'l o' sermons, 'n'
                  when he got through the year he turned his bar'l t'other side up, and begun at
                  t'other end. Lordy massy, who's to know it, when half on em 's asleep? And I guess
                  the preachin's full as good as the pay anyhow! Wal, the upshot on 't all is, they
                  got a gret counsel there, an' they 're a tryin' Mr. Perry for heresy an' what not.
                  Wal, I don't b'lieve there 's a yaller dog goes inter the Needmore meetin'-house
                  now that ain't got his mind made up one way or t'other about it. Yer don't hear
                  nothin' over there now 'xcept about Armenians an' Pelagians an' Unitarians an'
                  total depravity. Lordy massy! wal, they lives up to that doctrine any way. What do
                  ye think of old Sphyxy Smith's bein' called in as one o' the witnesses in council?
                  She don' know no more 'bout religion than an' old hetchel, but she 's ferce as can
                  be on Deacon Bangs's side, an' Old Crab Smith he hes to hev' his say 'bout
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Do tell," said Harry, wonderingly, "if that old creature is alive yet!"</p>
               <p>"'Live? Why, yis, ye may say so," said Sam. "Much alive as ever he was. Ye see he
                  kind o' pickles himself in hard cider, an' I dunno but he may live to hector his
                  wife till he 's ninety. But he 's gret on the trial now, an' very much interested
                  'bout the doctrines. He ses thet he hain't heard a sermon on sovereignty, or
                  'lection, or reprobation, sence he can remember. Wal, t'other side, they say they
                  don't see what business Old Crab an' Miss Sphyxy hev to be meddlin' so much, when
                  they ain't church-members. Why, I was over to Needmore town-meetin' day jest to
                  hear 'em fight over it; they talked a darned sight more 'bout that than 'bout the
                  turnpikes or town business. Why, I heard Deacon Brown (he 's on the parson's side)
                  tellin' Old Crab he did n't see what business <emph>he</emph> had to
                     <emph>boss</emph> the doctrines, when he warn't a church-member, and Old Crab
                  said it <emph>was</emph> his bisness about the doctrines, 'cause he
                     <emph>paid</emph> to hev 'em. 'Ef I <emph>pay</emph> for good strong doctrine,
                  why, I want to <emph>hev</emph> good strong doctrine,' says Old Crab, says he. 'Ef
                  I pays for hell-fire, I want to hev hell-fire, and hev it hot too. I don't want
                  none o' your prophesyin' smooth things. Why,' says he, 'look at Dr. Stern. His
                  folks hes the very hair took off their heads 'most every Sunday day, and he don't
                  get no more 'n we pay Parson Perry. I tell yew,' says Old Crab, 'he 's a lettin'
                  on us all go to sleep, and it 's no wonder I ain't in the church.' Ye see, Old
                  Crab and Sphyxy, they seem to be kind o' settin' it down to poor old Parson
                  Perry's door that he hain't converted 'em, an' made saints on 'em long ago, when
                  they 've paid up their part o' the salary reg'lar, every year. Jes' so
                  onreasonable folks will be; they give a man two hunderd dollars a year an' his
                  wood, an' spect him to git all on em' inter the kingdom o' heaven, whether they
                  will or no, jest as the angels got Lot's wife and daughters out o' Sodom."</p>
               <p>"That poor little old woman!" said Harry. "Do tell if she is living yet!"</p>
               <p>"O yis, she 's all right," said Sam; "she 's one o' these 'ere little thin, dry
                  old women that keep a good while. But ain't ye heerd? their son Obid's come home
                  an' bought a farm, an' married a nice gal, and he insists on it his mother shall
                  live with him. An' so Old Crab and Miss Sphyxy, they fight it out together. So the
                  old woman is delivered from him most o' the time. Sometimes he walks over there
                  an' stays a week, an' takes a spell o' aggravatin' on 'er, that kind o' sets him
                  up, but he 's so busy now 'bout the quarrel 't I b'lieve he lets her alone."</p>
               <p>By this time we had reached the last rail-fence which separated us from the grassy
                  street of Oldtown, and here Sam took his leave of us.</p>
               <p>"I promised Hepsy when I went out," he said, "thet I'd go to the store and git her
                  some corn meal, but I'll be round agin in th' evening. Look 'ere," he added, "I
                  wus out this mornin', an' I dug some sweet-flag root for yer. I know ye used ter
                  like sweet-flag root. 'T ain't time for young wintergreen yit, but here's a bunch
                  I picked yer, with the berries an' old leaves. Do take 'em, boys, jest for sake o'
                  old times!"</p>
               <p>We thanked him, of course; there was a sort of aroma of boyhood about these
                  things, that spoke of spring days and melting snows, and long Saturday afternoon
                  rambles that we had had with Sam years before. And we saw his lean form go
                  striding off with something of an affectionate complacency.</p>
               <pb n="532-533" xml:id="VAC7953-00000271"/>
               <p>"Horace," said Harry, the minute we were alone, "you must n't mind too much about
                  Sam's gossip."</p>
               <p>"It is just what I have been expecting," said I; "but in a few moments we shall
                  know the truth."</p>
               <p>We went on until the square white front of the old Rossiter house rose upon our
                  view. We stopped before it, and down the walk from the front door to the gate,
                  amid the sweet budding lilacs, came gleaming and glancing the airy form of Tina.
                  So airy she looked, so bright, so full of life and joy, and threw herself into
                  Harry's arms, laughing and crying.</p>
               <p>"O Harry, Harry! God has been good to us! And you, dear brother Horace," she said,
                  turning to me and giving me both her hands, with one of those frank, loving looks
                  that said as much as another might say by throwing herself into your arms. "We are
                  all so happy!" she said.</p>
               <p>I determined to have it over at once, and I said, "Am I then to congratulate you,
                  Tina, on your engagement?"</p>
               <p>She laughed and blushed, and held up her hand, on which glittered a great diamond,
                  and hid her face for a moment on Harry's shoulder.</p>
               <p>"I could n't write to you about it, boys,—I could n't! But I meant to tell you
                  myself, and tell you the first thing too. I wanted to tell you about him, because
                  I think you none of you know him, or half how noble and good he is! Come, come
                  in," she said, taking us each by the hand and drawing us along with her. "Come in
                  and see Aunty; she 'll be so glad to see you!"</p>
               <p>If there was any one thing for which I was glad at this moment, it was that I had
                  never really made love to Tina. It was a comfort to me to think that she did not
                  and could not possibly know the pain she was giving me. All I know is that, at the
                  moment, I was seized with a wild, extravagant gayety, and rattled and talked and
                  laughed with a reckless <emph>abandon</emph> that quite astonished Harry. It
                  seemed to me as if every ludicrous story and every droll remark that I had ever
                  heard came thronging into my head together. And I believe that Tina really thought
                  that I was sincere in rejoicing with her. Miss Mehitable talked with us gravely
                  about it while Tina was out of the room. It was most sudden and unexpected, she
                  said, to her; she always had supposed that Ellery Davenport had admired Tina, but
                  never that he had thought of her in this way. In a worldly point of view, the
                  match was a more brilliant one than could ever have been expected. He was of the
                  best old families in the country,—of the Edwards and the Davenport stock,—his
                  talents were splendid, and his wealth would furnish everything that wealth could
                  furnish. "There is only one thing," she continued gravely; "I am not satisfied
                  about his religious principles. But Tina is an enthusiast, and has perfect faith
                  that he will come all right in this respect. He seems to be completely dazzled and
                  under her influence now," said Miss Mehitable, taking a leisurely pinch of snuff,
                  "but then, you see, that 's a common phenomenon, about this time in a man's life.
                  But," she added, "where there is such a strong attachment on both sides, all we
                  can do is to wish both sides well, and speed them on their way. Mr. Davenport has
                  interested himself in the very kindest manner in regard to both Tina and Harry,
                  and I suppose it is greatly owing to this that affairs have turned out as
                  prosperously as they have. As you know, Sir Harry made a handsome provision for
                  Tina in his will. I confess I am glad of that," she said, with a sort of pride. "I
                  would n't want my little Tina to have passed into his arms altogether penniless.
                  When first love is over, men sometimes remember those things."</p>
               <p>"If my father had not done justice to Tina in his will," said Harry, "I should
                  have done it. My sister should not have gone to any man a beggar."</p>
               <p>"I know that, my dear," said Miss Mehitable, "but still it is a pleasure to think
                  that your father did it. It was a justice to your mother's memory that I am glad
                  he rendered."</p>
               <p>"And when is this marriage to take place?" said I.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Davenport wants to carry her away in June," said Miss Mehitable. "That leaves
                  but little time; but he says he must go to join the English Embassy, certainly by
                  midsummer, and as there seems to be a good reason for his haste, I suppose I must
                  not put my feelings in the way. It seems now as if I had had her only a few days,
                  and she has been so very sweet and<pb n="534-535" xml:id="VAC7953-00000272"/>
                  lovely to me. Well," said she, after a moment, "I suppose the old
                  sweetbrier-bushes feel lonesome when we cut their blossoms and carry them off, but
                  the old thorny things must n't have blossoms if they don't expect to have them
                  taken. That's all we scraggly old people are good for."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">WHAT OUR FOLKS THOUGHT ABOUT IT.</head>
               <p>AT home, that evening, before the great open fire, still the same subject was
                  discussed. Tina's engagement to Ellery Davenport was spoken of as the next most
                  brilliant stroke of luck to Harry's accession to the English property. Aunt Lois
                  was all smiles and suavity, poor dear old soul! How all the wrinkles and crinkles
                  of her face smoothed out under the influence of prosperity! and how providential
                  everything appeared to her!</p>
               <p>"Providence gets some pay-days," said an old divine. Generally speaking, his
                  account is suffered to run on with very lax attention. But when a young couple
                  make a fortunate engagement, or our worldly prospects take a sudden turn to go as
                  we would, the account of Providence is gladly balanced; praise and thanksgiving
                  come in over-measure.</p>
               <p>For my part, I could n't see the Providence at all in it, and found this looking
                  into happiness through other people's eyes a very fatiguing operation.</p>
               <p>My grandfather and grandmother, as they sat pictured out by the light of a
                  magnificent hickory fire, seemed scarcely a year older; but their faces this
                  evening were beaming complacently; and my mother, in her very quiet way, could
                  scarcely help triumphing over Aunt Lois. I was a sophomore in Cambridge, and Harry
                  a landed proprietor, and Tina an heiress to property in her own right, instead of
                  our being three poor orphan children without any money, and with the up-hill of
                  life to climb.</p>
               <p>In the course of the evening, Miss Mehitable came in with Ellery Davenport and
                  Tina. Now, much as a man will dislike the person who steps between him and the
                  lady of his love, I could not help, this evening, myself feeling the power of that
                  fascination by which Ellery Davenport won the suffrages of all hearts.</p>
               <pb n="536-537" xml:id="VAC7953-00000273"/>
               <p>Aunt Lois, as usual, was nervous and fidgety with the thought that the call of the
                  splendid Mr. Davenport had surprised them all at the great kitchen-fire, when
                  there was the best room cold as Nova Zembla. She looked almost reproachfully at
                  Tina, and said apologetically to Mr. Davenport, "We are rough working folks, and
                  you catch us just as we are. If we 'd known you were coming, we 'd have had a fire
                  in the parlor."</p>
               <p>"Then, Miss Badger, you would have been very cruel, and deprived us of a rare
                  enjoyment," said he. "What other land but our own America can give this great,
                  joyous, abundant home-fire? The great kitchen-fire of New England," he added,
                  seating himself admiringly in front of it, "gives you all the freshness and
                  simplicity of forest life, with a sense of shelter and protection. It 's like a
                  camp-fire in the woods, only that you have a house over you, and a good bed to
                  sleep in at hand; and there is nothing that draws out the heart like it. People
                  never can talk to each other as they do by these great open fires. For my part,"
                  he said, "I am almost a Fire-worshipper. I believe in the divine properties of
                  flame. It purifies the heart and warms the affections, and when people sit and
                  look into the coals together, they feel a sort of glow of charity coming over them
                  that they never feel anywhere else."</p>
               <p>"Now, I should think," said Aunt Lois, "Mr. Davenport, that you must have seen so
                  much pomp and splendor and luxury abroad, that our rough life here would seem
                  really disagreeable to you."</p>
               <p>"Quite the contrary," said Ellery Davenport. "We go abroad to appreciate our home.
                  Nature is our mother, and the life that is lived nearest to nature is, after all,
                  the one that is the pleasantest. I met Brant at court last winter. You know he was
                  a wild Indian to begin with, and he has seen both extremes, for now he is Colonel
                  Brant, and has been moving in fashionable society in London. So I thought he must
                  be a competent person to decide on the great question between savage and civilized
                  life, and he gave his vote for the savage."</p>
               <p>"I wonder at him," said my grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Well, I remember," said Tina, "we had one day and night of savage life—don't you
                  remember, Harry?—that was very pleasant. It was when we stayed with the old Indian
                  woman,—do you remember? It was all very well, so long as the sun shone; but then
                  when the rain fell, and the wind blew, and the drunken Indian came home, it was
                  not so pleasant."</p>
               <p>"That was the time, young lady," said Ellery Davenport, looking at her with a
                  flash in his blue eyes, "that you established yourself as housekeeper on my
                  premises! If I had only known it, I might have picked you up then, as a waif on my
                  grounds."</p>
               <p>"It 's well you did not," said Tina, laughing; "you would have found me
                  troublesome to keep. I don't believe you would have been as patient as dear old
                  Aunty, here," she added, laying her head on Miss Mehitable's shoulder. "I was a
                  perfect brier-rose,—small leaves and a great many prickles."</p>
               <p>"By the by," said Harry, "Sam Lawson has been telling us, this morning, about our
                  old friends Miss Asphyxia Smith and Old Crab."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," said Tina, laughing, "that those creatures are living yet? Why,
                  I look back on them as some awful pre-Adamite monsters."</p>
               <p>"Who was Miss Asphyxia?" said Ellery Davenport. "I have n't heard of her."</p>
               <p>"O, 't was a great threshing-machine of a woman that caught me between its teeth
                  some years ago," said Tina. "What do you suppose would ever have become of me,
                  Aunty, if she had kept me? Do you think she ever could have made me a great
                  stramming, threshing, scrubbing, floor-cleaning machine, like herself? She warned
                  Miss Mehitable," continued Tina, looking at Ellery and laughing shyly, "that I
                  never should grow up to be good for anything; and she spoke a fatal truth, for,
                  since she gave me up, every mortal creature has tried to pet and spoil me. Dear
                  old Aunty and Mr. Rossiter have made some feeble attempts to make me good for
                  something, but they have n't done much at it."</p>
               <p>"Thank Heaven!" said Ellery Davenport. "Who would think of training a wild rose? I
                  sometimes look at the way a sweetbrier<pb n="538-539" xml:id="VAC7953-00000274"/>
                  brier grows over one of our rough stone walls, and think what a beautiful defiance
                  it is to gardeners."</p>
               <p>"That is all very pretty to say," said Tina, "when you happen to be where there
                  are none but wild roses; but when you were among marchionesses and duchesses, how
                  was it then?"</p>
               <p>For answer, Ellery Davenport bent over her, and said something which I could not
                  hear. He had the art, without seeming to whisper, of throwing a sentence from him
                  so that it should reach but one ear; and Tina laughed and blushed and dimpled, and
                  looked as if a thousand little graces were shaking their wings around her.</p>
               <p>It was one of Tina's great charms that she was never for a moment at rest. In this
                  she was like a bird, or a brook, or a young tree, in which there is always a
                  little glancing shimmer of movement. And when anything pleased her, her face
                  sparkled as a river does when something falls into it. I noticed Ellery
                  Davenport's eyes followed all these little motions as if he had been enchanted. O,
                  there was no doubt that the great illusion, the delicious magic, was in full
                  development between them. And Tina looked so gladly satisfied, and glanced about
                  the circle and at him with such a quiet triumph of possession, and such
                  satisfaction in her power over him, that it really half reconciled me to see that
                  she was so happy. And, after all, I thought to myself as I looked at the airy and
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">spirituel</foreign> style of her beauty,—a beauty that
                  conveyed the impression of fragility and brilliancy united to the highest
                  point,—such a creature as that is made for luxury, made for perfume and flowers
                  and jewelry and pomp of living and obsequious tending, for old aristocratic lands
                  and court circles, where she would glitter as a star. And what had I to offer,—I,
                  a poor sophomore in Harvard, owing that position to the loving charity of my dear
                  old friend? My love to her seemed a madness and a selfishness,—as if I had wished
                  to take the evening star out of the heavens and burn it for a household lamp. "How
                  fortunate, how fortunate," I thought to myself, "that I have never told her! For
                  now I shall keep the love of her heart. We are friends, and she shall be the lady
                  of my heart forever,—the lady of my dreams."</p>
               <p>I knew, too, that I had a certain hold upon her; and even at this moment I saw her
                  eye often, as from old habit, looking across to me, a little timidly and
                  anxiously, to see what I thought of her prize. She was Tina still,—the same old
                  Tina, that always needed to be approved and loved and sympathized with, and have
                  all her friends go with her, heart and hand, in all her ways. So I determined to
                  like him.</p>
               <p>At this moment Sam Lawson came in. I was a little curious to know how he had
                  managed it with his conscience to leave his domestic circle under their trying
                  circumstances, but I was very soon satisfied as to this point.</p>
               <p>Sam, who had watched the light flaring out from the windows, and flattened his
                  nose against the window-pane while he announced to Hepsy that "Mr. Devenport and
                  Miss Mehitable and Tiny were all a goin' into the Deacon's to spend th' evenin',"
                  could not resist the inexpressible yearning to have a peep himself at what was
                  going on there.</p>
               <p>He came in with a most prostrate air of dejection. Aunt Lois frowned with stern
                  annoyance, and looked at my grandmother, as much as to say, "To think
                     <emph>he</emph> should come in when Mr. Davenport is making a call here!"</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport, however, received him with a patronizing cheerfulness,—"Why,
                  hulloa, Sam, how are you?" It was Ellery Davenport's delight to start Sam's
                  loquacity and develop his conversational powers, and he made a welcoming movement
                  toward the block of wood in the chimney-corner. "Sit down," he said,—"sit down,
                  and tell us how Hepsy and the children are."</p>
               <p>Tina and he looked at each other with eyes dancing with merriment.</p>
               <p>"Wal, wal," said Sam, sinking into the seat and raising his lank hands to the
                  fire, while his elbows rested on his knees, "the children 's middlin',—Doctor
                  Merrill ses he thinks they 've got past the wust on 't,—but Hepsy, she 's clean
                  tuckered out, and kind o' discouraged. An' I thought I 'd come over an' jest ask
                  Mis' Badger ef she would n't kind o' jest mix 'er up a little milk punch to kind
                  o' set 'er up agin."</p>
               <pb n="540-541" xml:id="VAC7953-00000275"/>
               <p>"What a considerate husband!" said Ellery Davenport, glancing around the circle
                  with infinite amusement.</p>
               <p>My grandmother, always prompt at any call on her charity, was already half across
                  the floor toward her buttery, whence she soon returned with a saucepan of
                  milk.</p>
               <p>"I 'll watch that 'ere, Mis' Badger," said Sam. "Jest rake out the coals this way,
                  an' when it begins ter simmer I 'll put in the sperits, ef ye 'll gin 'em to me.
                  'Give strong drink ter him as is ready to perish,' the Scriptur' says. Hepsy 's
                  got an amazin' sight o' grit in 'er, but I 'clare for 't, she 's ben up an' down
                  nights so much lately with them young uns thet she 's a'most clean wore out. An' I
                  should be too, ef I did n't take a tramp now 'n' then to kind o' keep me up. Wal,
                  ye see, the head o' the family, he <emph>hes</emph> to take car' o' himself,
                  'cause ye see, ef <emph>he</emph> goes down, all goes down. 'The man is the head
                  o' the woman,' ye know," said Sam, as he shook his skillet of milk.</p>
               <p>I could see Tina's eyes dancing with mirthfulness as Ellery Davenport answered, "I
                  'm glad to see, Sam, that you have a proper care of your health. You are such an
                  important member of the community, that I don't know what Oldtown would be without
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"Wal, now, Mr. Devenport, ye flatter me; but then everybody don't seem to think
                  so. I don't think folks like me, as does for this one an' does for that one, an'
                  kind o' spreads out permiskus, is appreciated allers. There 's Hepsy, she 's
                  allers at me, a sayin' I don't do nothin' for her, an' yet there las' night I wus
                  up in my shirt, a shiverin' an' a goin' round, fust ter one and then ter 'nuther,
                  a hevin' on 'em up an' a thumpin' on their backs, an' clarin' the phlegm out o'
                  their thruts, till I wus e'en a'most fruz; and Hepsy, she lay there abed scoldin'
                  'cause I hed n't sawed no wood thet arternoon to keep up the fire. Lordy massy, I
                  jest went out ter dig a leetle sweet-flag root ter gin ter the boys, 'cause I wus
                  so kind o' wore out. I don't think these 'ere women ever 'flects on
                     <emph>men's</emph> trials. They railly don't keep count o' what we do for
                  'em."</p>
               <p>"What a picture of conjugal life!" said Ellery Davenport, glancing at Tina. "Yes,
                  Sam, it is to be confessed that the female sex are pretty exorbitant creditors.
                  They make us pay dear for serving them."</p>
               <p>"Jes' so! jes' so!" said Sam. "They don't know nothin' what we undergo. I don't
                  think Hepsy keeps no sort o' count o' the nights an' nights I 've walked the floor
                  with the baby, whishin' an' shooin' on 't, and singin' to 't till my thrut wus
                  sore, an' then hed to git up afore daylight to split oven-wood, an' then right to
                  my blacksmithin', jest to git a little money to git the meat an' meal an' suthin'
                  comfort'ble fur dinner! An' then, ye see, there don't nothin' <emph>last</emph>,
                  when there 's so many mouths to eat it up; an' there 't is, it's jest roun' an'
                  roun'. Ye git a good piece o' beef Tuesday an' pay for 't, an' by Thursday it 's
                  all gone, an' ye hev to go to work agin! Lordy massy, this 'ere life don't seem
                  hardly wuth hevin'. I s'pose, Mr. Devenport, you 've been among the gret folks o'
                  th' earth, over there in King George's court? Why, they say here that you've ben
                  an' tuk tea with the king, with his crown on 's head! I s'pose they all goes roun'
                  with their crowns on over there; don't they?"</p>
               <p>"Well, no, not precisely," said Ellery Davenport. "I think they rather mitigate
                  their splendors when they have to do with us poor republicans, so as not to bear
                  us down altogether."</p>
               <p>"Jes' so," said Sam, "like Moses, that put a veil over 's face 'cause th'
                  Israelites could n't bear the glory."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Ellery Davenport, "I 've not been struck with any particular
                  resemblance between King George and Moses."</p>
               <p>"The folks here 'n Oldtown, Mr. Devenport, 's amazin' curus to hear the
                  partic'lars 'bout them grand things 't you must ha' seen; I's a tellin' on 'em up
                  to store how you 'd ben with lords 'n' ladies 'n' dukes 'n' duchesses, 'n' seen
                  all the kingdoms o' the world, an' the glory on 'em. I told 'em I did n't doubt
                  you 'd et off 'm plates o' solid gold, an' ben in houses where the walls was all a
                  crust o' gold 'n' diamonds 'n' precious stones, 'n' yit ye did n't seem ter be one
                  bit lifted up nor proud, so 't yer could n't talk ter common folks. I s'pose them
                  gret fam'lies they hes as much's fifty ur a hunderd servants, don't they?"</p>
               <p>"Well, sometimes," said Ellery Davenport.</p>
               <p>"Wal, now," said Sam, "I sh'd think a man 'd feel kind o'<pb n="542-543"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000276"/> curus,—sort o' 's ef he was keepin' a hotel, an'
                  boardin' all the lower classes."</p>
               <p>"It is something that way, Sam," said Ellery Davenport. "That's one way of
                  providing for the lower classes."</p>
               <p>"Jest what th' Lord told th' Israelites when they would hev a king," said Sam.
                  "Ses he, 'He 'll take yer daughters to be confectioners 'n' cooks 'n' bakers, an'
                  he 'll take the best o' yer fields 'n' yer vineyards 'n' olive-yards, an' give 'em
                  to his sarvints, an' he 'll take a tenth o' yer seed 'n' give 'em ter his
                  officers, an' he 'll take yer men-sarvints 'n' yer maid-sarvints, 'n' yer
                  goodliest young asses, an' put 'em ter his works."</p>
               <p>"Striking picture of monarchical institutions, Sam," said Ellery Davenport.</p>
               <p>"Wal, now, I tell ye what," said Sam, slowly shaking his shimmering skillet of
                  milk, "I should n't want ter git inter that ere' pie, unless I could be some o'
                  the top crust. It 's jest like a pile o' sheepskins,—'s only the top un lies
                  light. I guess th' undermost one's squeezed putty flat."</p>
               <p>"I 'll bet it is, Sam," said Ellery Davenport, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Wal," said Sam, "I go for republics, but yit it's human natur' ter kind o' like
                  ter hold outer titles. Now over here a man likes ter be a deacon 'n' a cap'n 'n' a
                  colonel in the milishy 'n' a sheriff 'n' a judge, 'n' all thet. Lordy massy, I
                  don't wonder them grand English folks sticks to their grand titles, an' the people
                  all kind o' bows down to 'em, as they did to Nebuchadnezzar's golden image."</p>
               <p>"Why, Sam," said Ellery Davenport, "your speculations on politics are really
                  profound."</p>
               <p>"Wal," said Sam, "Mr. Devenport, there's one pint I want ter consult ye 'bout, an'
                  thet is, what the king o' England's name is. There 's Jake Marshall 'n' me, we 's
                  argood that pint these many times. Jake ses his name is George Rix,—R-i-x,—an'
                  thet ef he 'd come over here, he 'd be called Mr. Rix. I ses to him, 'Why, Jake,
                  't ain't <emph>Rix</emph>, it 's Rex, an' 't ain't his name, it's his title,' ses
                  I,—'cause the boys told me thet Rex was Latin 'n' meant king; but Jake 's one o'
                  them fellers thet allers thinks he knows. Now, Mr. Devenport, I 'd like to put it
                  down from you ter him, 'cause you 've just come from the court o' England, an' you
                  'd know."</p>
               <p>"Well, you may tell your friend Jake that you are quite in the right," said Ellery
                  Davenport. "Give him my regards, and tell him he 's been mistaken."</p>
               <p>"But you don't call the king Rex when ye speak to 'im, do yer?" said Sam.</p>
               <p>"Not precisely," said Ellery Davenport.</p>
               <p>"Mis' Badger," said Sam, gravely, "this 'ere milk 's come to the bile, 'n' ef you
                  'll be so kind's to hand me the sperits 'n' the sugar, I 'll fix this 'ere. Hepsy
                  likes her milk punch putty hot."</p>
               <p>"Well, Sam," said my grandmother, as she handed him the bottle, "take an old
                  woman's advice, and don't go stramming off another afternoon. If you 'd been
                  steady at your black-smithin', you might have earned enough money to buy all these
                  things yourself, and Hepsy 'd like it a great deal better."</p>
               <p>"I suppose it's about the two hundred and forty-ninth time mother has told him
                  that," said Aunt Lois, with an air of weary endurance.</p>
               <p>"Wal, Mis' Badger," said Sam, "'all work an' no play makes Jack a dull boy,' ye
                  know. I <emph>hes</emph> to recreate, else I gits quite wore out. Why, lordy
                  massy, even a saw-mill hes ter stop sometimes ter be greased. 'T ain't everybody
                  thet 's like Sphyxy Smith, but she grits and screeches all the time, jest 'cause
                  she keeps to work without bein' 'iled. Why, she could work on, day 'n' night,
                  these twenty years, 'n' never feel it. But, lordy massy, I gits so 'xhausted, an'
                  hes sech a sinking 't my stomach, 'n' then I goes out 'n' kind o'
                     <emph>Injunin</emph>' round, an' git flag-root 'n' winter-green 'n' spruce
                  boughs 'n' gensing root 'n' sarsafrass 'n' sich fur Hepsy to brew up a beer. I
                  ain't a wastin' my time ef I be enjoyin' myself. I say it 's a part o' what we 's
                  made for."</p>
               <p>"You are a true philosopher, Sam," said Ellery Davenport.</p>
               <p>"Wal," said Sam, "I look at it this 'ere way,—ef I keep on a grindin' and a
                  grindin' day 'n' night, I never shell hev nothin', but ef I takes now 'n' then an
                  arternoon to lie roun' in the sun, <emph>I gits suthin' 's I go 'long</emph>.
                  Lordy massy, it 's jest all the comfort I hes, kind o' watchin' the clouds 'n' the
                  birds, 'n' kind o' forgettin' all 'bout Hepsy 'n' the children 'n' the
                  blacksmithin'."</p>
               <pb n="544-545" xml:id="VAC7953-00000277"/>
               <p>"Well," said Aunt Lois, smartly, "I think you are forgetting all about Hepsy and
                  the children now, and I advise you to get that milk punch home as quick as you
                  can, if it 's going to do her any good. Come, here 's a tin pail to put it into.
                  Cover it up, and do let the poor woman have some comfort as well as you!"</p>
               <p>Sam received his portion in silence, and, with reluctant glances at the warm
                  circle, went out into the night.</p>
               <p>"I don't see how you all can bear to listen to that man's maundering!" said Aunt
                  Lois. "He puts me out of all sort of patience. 'Head of the woman' to be sure!
                  when Hepsy earns the most of what that family uses, except what we give 'em. And I
                  know exactly how she feels; the poor woman is mad with shame and humiliation half
                  the time at the charities he will accept from us."</p>
               <p>"O come, Miss Lois," said Ellery Davenport, "you must take an æsthetic view of
                  him. Sam 's a genuine poet in his nature, and poets are always practically
                  useless. And now Sam 's about the only person in Oldtown, that I have seen, that
                  has the least idea that life is meant, in any way, for enjoyment. Everybody else
                  seems to be sword in hand, fighting against the possibility of future suffering,
                  toiling and depriving themselves of all present pleasure, so that they may not
                  come to want by and by. Now I've been in countries where the whole peasantry are
                  like Sam Lawson."</p>
               <p>"Good gracious!" said Aunt Lois, "what a time they must have of it!"</p>
               <p>"Well, to say the truth, there 's not much progress in such communities, but there
                  is a great deal of clear, sheer animal enjoyment. And when trouble comes, it comes
                  on them as it does on animals, unfeared and unforeseen, and therefore unprovided
                  for."</p>
               <p>"Well," said my grandmother, "you don't think that is the way for rational and
                  immortal creatures to live?"</p>
               <p>"Well," said Ellery Davenport, "taking into account the rational and immortal,
                  perhaps not; but I think if we could mix the two races together it would be
                  better. The Yankee lives almost entirely for the future, the Italian enjoys the
                  present."</p>
               <p>"Well, but do you think it is <emph>right</emph> to live merely to enjoy the
                  present?" persisted Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"The eternal question!" said Ellery. "After all, who knows anything about it? What
                     <emph>is</emph> right, and what <emph>is</emph> wrong? Mere geographical
                  accidents! What is right for the Greenlander is wrong for me; what is right for me
                  is wrong for the Hindoo. Take the greatest saint on earth to Greenland, and feed
                  him on train oil and candles, and you make one thing of him; put him under the
                  equator, with the thermometer at one hundred in the shade, and you make
                  another."</p>
               <p>"But right is right and wrong is wrong," said Aunt Lois, persistently, "after
                  all."</p>
               <p>"I sometimes think," said Ellery Davenport, "that right and wrong are just like
                  color, mere accidental properties. There is no color where there 's no light, and
                  a thing is all sorts of colors according to the position you stand in and the hour
                  of the day. There 's your rocking-chair in the setting sun becomes a fine crimson,
                  and in the morning comes out dingy gray. So it is with human actions. There's
                  nothing so bad that you cannot see a good side to it, nothing so good that you
                  cannot see a bad side to it. Now we think it's shocking for our Indian tribes,
                  some of them, to slay their old people; but I'm not sure, if the Indian could set
                  forth his side of the case, with all the advantages of our rhetoric, but that he
                  would have the best of it. He does it as an act of filial devotion, you see. He
                  loves and honors his father too much to let him go through all that horrid process
                  of draining out life drop by drop that we think the thing to protract in our high
                  civilization. For my part, if I were an Indian chief, I should prefer, when I came
                  to be seventy, to be respectfully knocked on the head by my oldest son, rather
                  than to shiver and drivel and muddle and cough my life out a dozen years
                  more."</p>
               <p>"But God has given his commandments to teach us what is right," said Aunt Lois.
                  "'Honor thy father and mother.'"</p>
               <p>"Precisely," said Ellery; "and my friends the Sioux would tell you that they
                     <emph>do</emph> honor their fathers and mothers by respectfully putting them
                  out of the way when there is no more pleasure<pb n="546-547"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000278"/> in living. They send them to enjoy eternal youth in
                  the hunting-grounds of the fathers, you know."</p>
               <p>"Positively, Ellery," said Tina, "I sha' n't have this sort of heathen stuff
                  talked any longer. Why, you put one's head all in a whirl! and you know you don't
                  believe a word of it yourself. What's the use of making everybody think you 're
                  worse than you are?"</p>
               <p>"My dear," said Ellery, "there 's nothing like hearing all that can be said on
                  both sides of subjects. Now there 's my good grandfather made an argument on the
                  will, that is, and forever will remain, unanswerable, because he proves both sides
                  of a flat contradiction perfectly; that method makes a logic-trap out of which no
                  mortal can get his foot."</p>
               <p>"Well," said my grandmother, "Mr. Davenport, if you 'll take an old woman's
                  advice, you 'll take up with your grandfather's <emph>good resolutions,</emph> and
                  not be wasting your strength in such talk."</p>
               <p>"I believe there were about seventy-five—or eighty, was it?—of those resolutions,"
                  said Ellery.</p>
               <p>"And you would n't be the worse for this world or the next if you 'd make them
                  yourself," said my grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, madam," said Ellery, bowing, "I 'll think of it."</p>
               <p>"Well, come," said Tina, rising, "it's time for us to go; and," she said, shaking
                  her finger warningly at Ellery Davenport, "I have a private lecture for you."</p>
               <p>"I don't doubt it," he said, with a shrug of mock apprehension; "the preaching
                  capacities of the fair sex are something terrific. I see all that is before
                  me."</p>
               <p>They bade adieu, the fire was raked up in the great fireplace, all the members of
                  the family went their several ways to bed, but Harry and I sat up in the glimmer
                  and gloom of the old kitchen, lighted, now and then, by a sputtering jet of flame,
                  which burst from the sticks. All round the large dark hearth the crickets were
                  chirping as if life were the very merriest thing possible.</p>
               <p>"Well, Harry," I said, "you see the fates have ordered it just as I feared."</p>
               <p>"It is almost as much of a disappointment to me as it can be to you," said Harry.
                  "And it is the more so because I cannot quite trust this man."</p>
               <p>"I never trusted him," said I. "I always had an instinctive doubt of him."</p>
               <p>"My doubts are not instinct," said Harry, "they are founded on things I have heard
                  him say myself. It seems to me that he has formed the habit of trifling with all
                  truth, and that nothing is sacred in his eyes."</p>
               <p>"And yet Tina loves him," said I. "I can see that she has gone to him heart and
                  soul, and she believes in him with all her heart, and so we can only pray that he
                  may be true to her. As for me, I can never love another. It only remains to live
                  worthily of my love."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">MARRIAGE PREPARATIONS.</head>
               <p>AND now for a time there was nothing thought of or talked of but marriage
                  preparations and arrangements. Letters of congratulation came pouring in to Miss
                  Mehitable from her Boston friends and acquaintances.</p>
               <p>When Harry and I returned to college, we spent one day with our friends the
                  Kitterys, and found it the one engrossing subject there, as everywhere.</p>
               <p>Dear old Madam Kittery was dissolved in tenderness, and whenever the subject was
                  mentioned reiterated all her good opinions of Ellery, and her delight in the
                  engagement, and her sanguine hopes of its good influence on his spiritual
                  prospects.</p>
               <p>Miss Debby took the subject up energetically. Ellery Davenport was a near family
                  connection, and it became the Kitterys to make all suitable and proper advances.
                  She insisted upon addressing Harry by his title, notwithstanding his blushes and
                  disclaimers.</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," she said to him, "it appears that you are an Englishman and a
                  subject of his Majesty; and I should not be surprised, at some future day, to hear
                  of you in the House of Commons; and it becomes you to reflect upon your position,
                  and what is proper in relation to yourself; and, at least under this roof, you
                  must allow me to observe these proprieties, however much they may be disregarded
                  elsewhere. I have already informed the servants that they are always to address
                  you as Sir Harry, and I hope that you will not interfere with my
                  instructions."</p>
               <p>"O certainly not," said Harry. "It will make very little difference with me."</p>
               <p>"Now, in regard to this marriage," said Miss Debby, "as there is no
                     <emph>church</emph> in Oldtown, and no clergyman, I have felt that it would be
                  proper in me, as a near kinswoman to Mr. Davenport, to place the Kittery mansion
                  at Miss Mehitable Rossiter's disposal, for the wedding."</p>
               <p>"Well, I confess," said Harry, blushing, "I never thought but that the ceremony
                  would be performed at home, by Parson Lothrop."</p>
               <p>"My dear Sir Harry!" said Miss Debby, laying her hand on his arm with solemnity,
                  "consider that your excellent parents, Sir Harry and Lady Percival, were both
                  members of the Established Church of England, the only true Apostolic Protestant
                  Church,—and can you imagine that their spirits, looking down from heaven, would be
                  pleased and satisfied that their daughter should consummate the most solemn union
                  of her life out of the Church? and in fact at the hands of a man who has never
                  received ordination?"</p>
               <p>It was with great difficulty that Harry kept his countenance during this solemn
                  address. His blue eyes actually laughed, though he exercised a rigid control over
                  the muscles of his face.</p>
               <p>"I really had not thought about it at all, Miss Debby," he said. "I think you are
                  exceedingly kind."</p>
               <p>"And I 'm sure," said she, "that you must see the propriety of it now that it is
                  suggested to you. Of course, a marriage performed by Mr. Lothrop would be a legal
                  one, so far as the civil law is concerned; but I confess I always have regarded
                  marriage as a religious ordinance, and it would be a disagreeable thing to me to
                  have any connections of mine united merely by a <emph>civil</emph> tie. These
                  Congregational marriages," said Miss Debby, in a contemptuous voice, "I should
                  think would lead to immorality. How can people feel as if they were married that
                  don't utter any vows themselves, and don't have any wedding-ring put on their
                  finger? In my view, it 's not respectable; and, as Mrs. Ellery Davenport will
                  probably be presented in the first circles of England, I desire that she should
                  appear there with her wedding-ring on, like an honest woman. I have therefore
                  despatched an invitation to Miss Mehitable to bring your sister and spend the
                  month preceding the wedding with us in Boston. It will be desirable for other
                  reasons, as all the shopping and dressmaking<pb n="550-551"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000280"/> and millinery work must be done in Boston. Oldtown
                  is a highly respectable little village, but, of course, affords no advantages for
                  the outfit of a person of quality, such as your sister is and is to be. I have had
                  a letter from Lady Widgery this morning. She is much delighted, and sends
                  congratulations. She always, she said, believed that you had distinguished blood
                  in your veins when she first saw you at our house."</p>
               <p>There was something in Miss Debby's satisfied, confiding faith in everything
                  English and aristocratic that was vastly amusing to us. The perfect confidence she
                  seemed to have that Sir Harry Percival, after all the sins of his youth, had
                  entered heaven <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ex officio</foreign> as a repentant and
                  glorified baronet, a member of the only True Church, was really <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">naïve</foreign> and affecting. What would a church be good for
                  that allowed people of quality to go to hell, like the commonalty? Sir Harry, of
                  course, repented, and made his will in a proper manner, doubtless received the
                  sacrament and absolution, and left all human infirmities, with his gouty toes,
                  under the family monument, where his body reposed in sure and certain hope of a
                  blessed and glorious resurrection. The finding of his children under such
                  fortunate circumstances was another evidence of the good Providence who watches
                  over the fortunes of the better classes, and does not suffer the steps of good
                  Churchmen to slide beyond recovery.</p>
               <p>There were so many reasons of convenience for accepting Madam Kittery's hospitable
                  invitation, it was urged with such warmth and affectionate zeal by Madam Kittery
                  and Miss Debby, and seconded so energetically by Ellery Davenport, to whom this
                  arrangement would secure easy access to Tina's society during the intervening
                  time, that it was accepted.</p>
               <p>Harry and I were glad of it, as we should thus have more frequent opportunities of
                  seeing her. Ellery Davenport was refurbishing and refurnishing the old country
                  house, where Harry and Tina had spent those days of their childhood which it was
                  now an amusement to recall, and Tina was as gladly, joyously beautiful as young
                  womanhood can be in which, as in a transparent vase, the light of pure love and
                  young hope has been lighted.</p>
               <p>"You like him, Horace, don't you?" she had said to me, coaxingly, the first
                  opportunity after the evening we had spent together. What was I to do? I did not
                  like him, that was certain; but have you never, dear reader, been over-persuaded
                  to think and say you liked where you did not? Have you not scolded and hushed down
                  your own instinctive distrusts and heart-risings, blamed and schooled yourself for
                  them, and taken yourself sharply to task, and made yourself acquiesce in somebody
                  that was dear and necessary to some friend? So did I. I called myself selfish,
                  unreasonable, foolish. I determined to be generous to my successful rival, and to
                  like him. I took his frankly offered friendship, and I forced myself to be even
                  enthusiastic in his praise. It was a sure way of making Tina's cheeks glow and her
                  eyes look kindly on me, and she told me so often that there was no person in the
                  world whose good opinion she had such a value for, and she was so glad I liked
                  him. Would it not be perfectly abominable after this to let sneaking suspicions
                  harbor in my breast?</p>
               <p>Besides, if a man cannot have love, shall he therefore throw away friendship? and
                  may I not love with the love of chivalry,—the love that knights dedicated to
                  queens and princesses, the love that Tasso gave to Leonora D'Este, the love that
                  Dante gave to Beatrice, love that hopes little and asks nothing?</p>
               <p>I was frequently in at the Kittery house in leisure hours, and when, as often
                  happened, Tina was closeted with Ellery Davenport, I took sweet counsel with Miss
                  Mehitable.</p>
               <p>"We all stand outside now, Horace," she said. "I remember when <emph>I</emph> had
                  the hearing of all these thousand pretty little important secrets of the hour that
                  now must all be told in another direction. Such is life. What we want always comes
                  to us with some pain. I wanted Tina to be well married. I would not for the world
                  she should marry without just this sort of love; but of course it leaves me out in
                  the cold. I would n't say this to her for the world,—poor little thing, it would
                  break her heart."</p>
               <p>One morning, however, I went down and found Miss Mehitable in a very excited
                  state. She complained of a bad headache, but she had all the appearance of a
                  person who is constantly struggling<pb n="552-553" xml:id="VAC7953-00000281"/>
                  gling with something which she is doubtful of the expediency of uttering.</p>
               <p>At last, just as I was going, she called me into the library. "Come here, Horace,"
                  she said; "I want to speak to you."</p>
               <p>I went in, and she made a turn or two across the room in an agitated way, then sat
                  down at a table, and motioned me to sit down. "Horace, my dear boy," she said, "I
                  have never spoken to you of the deepest sorrow of my life, and yet it often seems
                  to me as if you knew it."</p>
               <p>"My dear Aunty," said I, for we had from childhood called her thus, "I think I do
                  know it,—somewhat vaguely. I know about your sister."</p>
               <p>"You know how strangely, how unaccountably she left us, and that nothing
                  satisfactory has ever been heard from her. I told Mr. Davenport all about her, and
                  he promised to try to learn something of her in Europe. He was so successful in
                  relation to Tina and Harry, I hoped he might learn something as to her; but he
                  never seemed to. Two or three times within the last four or five years I have
                  received letters from her, but without date, or any mark by which her position
                  could be identified. They told me, in the vaguest and most general way, that she
                  was well, and still loved me, but begged me to make no inquiries. They were always
                  postmarked at Havre; but the utmost research gives no clew to her residence
                  there."</p>
               <p>"Well?" said I.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Miss Mehitable, trembling in every limb, "yesterday, when Mr.
                  Davenport and Tina had been sitting together in this room for a long time, they
                  went out to ride. They had been playing at verse-making, or something of the kind,
                  and there were some scattered papers on the floor, and I thought I would remove
                  them, as they were rather untidy, and among them I found—"she stopped, and panted
                  for breath—"I found THIS!"</p>
               <p>She handed me an envelope that had evidently been around a package of papers. It
                  was postmarked Geneva, Switzerland, and directed to Ellery Davenport.</p>
               <p>"Horace," said Miss Mehitable, "<emph>that is Emily Rossiter's handwriting;</emph>
                  and look, the date is only two months back! What shall we do?"</p>
               <p>There are moments when whole trains of thought go through the brain like
                  lightning. My first emotion was, I confess, a perfectly fierce feeling of joy.
                  Here was a clew! My suspicions had not then been unjust; the man was what Miss
                  Debby had said,—deep, artful, and to be unmasked. In a moment I sternly rebuked
                  myself, and thought what a wretch I was for my suspicions. The very selfish stake
                  that I held in any such discovery imposed upon me, in my view, a double obligation
                  to defend the character of my rival. I so dreaded that I should be carried away
                  that I pleaded strongly and resolutely with myself for him. Besides, what would
                  Tina think of me if I impugned Ellery Davenport's honor for, what might be, after
                  all, an accidental resemblance in handwriting.</p>
               <p>All these things came in one blinding flash of thought as I held the paper in my
                  hands. Miss Mehitable sat, white and trembling, looking at me piteously.</p>
               <p>"My dear Aunty," I said, "in a case like this we cannot take one single step
                  without being perfectly sure. This handwriting may accidentally resemble your
                  sister's. Are you perfectly sure that it is hers? It is a very small scrap of
                  paper to determine by."</p>
               <p>"Well, I can't really say," said Miss Mehitable, hesitating. "It may be that I
                  have dwelt on this subject until I have grown nervous and my very senses deceive
                  me. I really cannot say, Horace; that was the reason I came to you to ask what I
                  should do."</p>
               <p>"Let us look the matter over calmly, Aunty."</p>
               <p>"Now," she said, nervously drawing from her pocket two or three letters and
                  opening them before me, "here are those letters, and your head is cool and steady.
                  I wish you would compare the writing, and tell me what to think of it."</p>
               <p>Now the letters and the directions were in that sharp, decided English hand which
                  so many well-educated women write, and in which personal peculiarities are lost,
                  to a great degree, in a general style. I could not help seeing that there was a
                  resemblance which might strike a person,—especially a person so deeply interested,
                  and dwelling with such intentness upon a subject, as Miss Mehitable evidently
                  was.</p>
               <pb n="554-555" xml:id="VAC7953-00000282"/>
               <p>"My dear Aunty," said I, "I see a resemblance; but have you not known a great many
                  ladies who wrote hands like this?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I must say I have," said Miss Mehitable, still hesitating,—"only, somehow,
                  this impressed me very strongly."</p>
               <p>"Well," said I, "supposing that your sister has written to Ellery Davenport, may
                  she not have intrusted him with communications under his promise of secrecy, which
                  he was bound in honor not to reveal?"</p>
               <p>"That may be possible," said Miss Mehitable, sighing deeply; "but O, why should
                  she not make a confidante of me?"</p>
               <p>"It may be, Aunty," said I, hesitatingly, "that she is living in relations that
                  she feels could not be justified to you."</p>
               <p>"O Horace!" said Miss Mehitable.</p>
               <p>"You know," I went on, "that there has been a very great shaking of old
                  established opinions in Europe. A great many things are looked upon there as open
                  questions, in regard to morality, which we here in New England never think of
                  discussing. Ellery Davenport is a man of the European world, and I can easily see
                  that there may be circumstances in which your sister would more readily resort to
                  the friendship of such a man than to yours."</p>
               <p>"May God help me!" said Miss Mehitable.</p>
               <p>"My dear Aunty, suppose you find that your sister has adopted a false theory of
                  life, sincerely and conscientiously, and under the influence of it gone astray
                  from what we in New England think to be right. Should we not make a discrimination
                  between errors that come from a wrong belief and the mere weakness that blindly
                  yields to passion? Your sister's letters show great decision and strength of mind.
                  It appears to me that she is exactly the woman to be misled by those dazzling,
                  unsettling theories with regard to social life which now bear such sway, and are
                  especially propagated by French literature. She may really and courageously deem
                  herself doing right in a course that she knows she cannot defend to you and Mr.
                  Rossiter."</p>
               <p>"Horace, you speak out and make plain what has been the secret and dreadful fear
                  of my life. I never have believed that Emily could have gone from us all, and
                  stayed away so long, without the support of some attachment. And while you have
                  been talking I have become perfectly certain that it is so; but the thought is
                  like death to me."</p>
               <p>"My dear Aunty," I said, "our Father above, who sees all the history of our minds,
                  and how they work, must have a toleration and a patience that we have not with
                  each other. He says that he will bring the blind by a way they knew not, and 'make
                  darkness light before them, and crooked things straight'; and he adds, 'These
                  things will I do unto them, and will not forsake them.' That has always seemed to
                  me the most godlike passage in the Bible."</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable sat for a long time, leaning her head upon her hand.</p>
               <p>"Then, Horace, you would n't advise me," she said, after a pause, "to say anything
                  to Ellery Davenport about it?"</p>
               <p>"Supposing," said I, "that there are communications that he is bound in honor not
                  to reveal, of what use could be your inquiries? It can only create unpleasantness;
                  it may make Tina feel unhappy, who is so very happy now, and probably, at best,
                  you cannot learn anything that would satisfy you."</p>
               <p>"Probably not," said she, sighing.</p>
               <p>"I can hand this envelope to him," I said after a moment's thought, "this evening,
                  if you think best, and you can see how he looks on receiving it."</p>
               <p>"I don't know as it will be of any use," said Miss Mehitable, "but you may do
                  it."</p>
               <p>Accordingly, that evening, as we were all gathered in a circle around the open
                  fire, and Tina and Ellery, seated side by side, were carrying on that sort of
                  bantering warfare of with in which they delighted, I drew this envelope from my
                  pocket and said, carelessly, "Mr. Davenport, here is a letter of yours that you
                  dropped in the library this morning."</p>
               <p>He was at that moment playing with a silk tassel which fluttered from Tina's
                  wrist. He let it go, and took the envelope and looked at it carelessly.</p>
               <p>"A letter!" said Tina, snatching it out of his hand with saucy freedom,—"dated at
                  Geneva, and a lady's handwriting! I think I have a right to open it!"</p>
               <pb n="556-557" xml:id="VAC7953-00000283"/>
               <p>"Do so by all means," said Ellery.</p>
               <p>"O pshaw! there 's nothing in it," said Tina.</p>
               <p>"Not an uncommon circumstance in a lady's letter," said Ellery.</p>
               <p>"You saucy fellow!" said Tina.</p>
               <p>"Why," said Ellery, "is it not the very province and privilege of the fair sex to
                  make nothing more valuable and more agreeable than something? that 's the true
                  secret of witchcraft."</p>
               <p>"But I sha' n't like it," said Tina, half pouting, "if you call my letters
                  nothing."</p>
               <p>"Your letters, I doubt not, will be an exception to those of all the sex," said
                  Ellery. "I really tremble, when I think how profound they will be!"</p>
               <p>"You are making fun of me!" said she, coloring.</p>
               <p>"I making fun of you? And what have you been doing with all your hapless lovers up
                  to this time? Behold Nemesis arrayed in my form."</p>
               <p>"But seriously, Ellery, I want to know whom this letter was from?"</p>
               <p>"Why don't you look at the signature?" said he.</p>
               <p>"Well, of course you know there is no signature, but I mean what came in this
                  paper?"</p>
               <p>"What came in the paper," said Ellery, carelessly, "was a neat little collection
                  of Alpine flowers, that, if you are interested in botany, I shall have the honor
                  of showing you one of these days."</p>
               <p>"But you have n't told me who sent them," said Tina.</p>
               <p>"Ah, ha! we are jealous!" said he, shaking the letter at her. "What would you give
                  to know, now? Will you be <emph>very</emph> good if I will tell you? Will you
                  promise me for the future not to order me to do more than forty things at one
                  time, for example?"</p>
               <p>"I sha' n't make any promises," said Tina; "you ought to tell me!"</p>
               <p>"What an oppressive mistress you are!" said Ellery Davenport. "I begin to
                  sympathize with Sam Lawson,—lordy massy, you dunno nothin' what I undergo!"</p>
               <p>"You don't get off that way," said Tina.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Ellery Davenport, "if you must know, it's Mrs. Breck."</p>
               <p>"And who is she?" said Tina.</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear, she was my boarding-house keeper at Geneva, and a very pretty,
                  nice Englishwoman,—one that I should recommend as an example to her sex."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" said Tina, "I don't care anything about it now."</p>
               <p>"Of course," said Ellery. "Modest, unpretending virtue never excites any interest.
                  I have labored under that disadvantage all my days."</p>
               <p>The by-play between the two had brought the whole circle around the fire into a
                  careless, laughing state. I looked across to Miss Mehitable; she was laughing with
                  the rest. As we started to go out, Miss Mehitable followed me into the passageway.
                  "My dear Horace," she said, "I was very absurd; it comes of being nervous and
                  thinking of one thing too much."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLV.</head>
               <head type="sub">WEDDING BELLS.</head>
               <p>THE fourteenth of June was as bright a morning as if it had been made on purpose
                  for a wedding-day, and of all the five thousand inauspicious possibilities which
                  usually encumber weddings, not one fell to our share.</p>
               <p>Tina's dress, for example, was all done two days beforehand, and fitted to a hair;
                  and all the invited guests had come, and were lodged in the spacious Kittery
                  mansion.</p>
               <p>Esther Avery was to stand as bridesmaid, with me as groomsman, and Harry, as
                  nearest relative, was to give the bride away. The day before, I had been in and
                  seen both ladies dressed up in the marriage finery, and we had rehearsed the
                  situation before Harry, as clergyman, Miss Debby being present, in one of her most
                  commanding frames of mind, to see that everything was done according to the
                  Rubric. She surveyed Esther, while she took an approving pinch of snuff, and
                  remarked to me, aside, "That young person, for a Congregational parson's daughter,
                  has a surprisingly distinguished air."</p>
               <p>Lady Widgery and Lady Lothrop, who were also in at the inspection, honored Esther
                  with their decided approbation.</p>
               <p>"She will be quite presentable at court," Lady Widgery remarked. "Of course Sir
                  Harry will wish her presented."</p>
               <p>All this <foreign xml:lang="FRA">empressement</foreign> in regard to Harry's rank
                  and title, among these venerable sisters, afforded great amusement to our
                  quartette, and we held it a capital joke among ourselves to make Esther blush by
                  calling her Lady Percival, and to inquire of Harry about his future parliamentary
                  prospects, his rent-rolls and tenants. In fact, when together, we were four
                  children, and played with life much as we used to in the dear old days.</p>
               <p>Esther, under the influence of hope and love, had bloomed out into a beautiful
                  woman. Instead of looking like a pale image of abstract thought, she seemed like
                  warm flesh and blood, and Ellery Davenport remarked, "What a splendid contrast her
                  black hair and eyes will make to the golden beauty of Tina!"</p>
               <p>All Oldtown respectability had exerted itself to be at the wedding. All, however
                  humble, who had befriended Tina and Harry during the days of their poverty, were
                  bidden. Polly had been long sojourning in the house, in the capacity of Miss
                  Mehitable's maid, and assisting assiduously in the endless sewing and fine laundry
                  work which precedes a wedding.</p>
               <p>On this auspicious morning she came gloriously forth, rustling in a stiff
                  changeable lutestring, her very Sunday best, and with her mind made up to enter an
                  Episcopal church for the first time in her life. There had, in fact, occurred some
                  slight theological skirmishes between Polly and the High Church domestics of Miss
                  Debby's establishment, and Miss Mehitable was obliged to make stringent
                  representations to Polly concerning the duty of sometimes repressing her testimony
                  for truth under particular circumstances.</p>
               <p>Polly had attended one catechising, but the shock produced upon her mind by
                  hearing doctrines which seemed to her to have such papistical tendencies was so
                  great that Miss Mehitable begged Miss Debby to allow her to be excused in future.
                  Miss Debby felt that the obligations of politeness owed by a woman of quality to
                  an invited guest in her own house might take precedence even of theological
                  considerations. In this point of view, she regarded Congregationalists with a
                  well-bred, compassionate tolerance, and very willingly acceded to whatever Miss
                  Mehitable suggested.</p>
               <p>Harry and I had passed the night before the wedding-day at the Kittery mansion,
                  that we might be there at the very earliest hour in the morning, to attend to all
                  those thousand and one things that always turn up for attention at such a
                  time.</p>
               <p>Madam Kittery's garden commanded a distant view of the sea, and I walked among the
                  stately alleys looking at that splendid distant view of Boston harbor, which
                  seemed so bright and sunny, and which swooned away into the horizon with such an
                  ineffable softness, as an image of eternal peace.</p>
               <p>As I stood there looking, I heard a light footstep behind me,<pb n="560-561"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000285"/> and Tina came up suddenly and spattered my cheek
                  with a dewy rose that she had just been gathering.</p>
               <p>"You look as mournful as if it were you that is going to be married!" she
                  said.</p>
               <p>"Tina!" I said, "you out so early too?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, for a wonder. The fact was, I had a bad dream, and could not sleep. I got up
                  and looked out of my window, and saw you here, Horace, so I dressed me quickly and
                  ran down. I feel a little bit uncanny,—and eerie, as the Scotch say,—and a little
                  bit sad, too, about the dear old days, Horace. We have had such good times
                  together,—first we three, and then we took Esther in, and that made four; and now,
                  Horace, you must open the ranks a little wider and take in Ellery."</p>
               <p>"But five is an uneven number," said I; "it leaves one out in the cold."</p>
               <p>"O Horace! I hope you will find one worthy of you," she said. "I shall have a
                  place in my heart all ready for her. She shall be my sister. You will write to me,
                  won't you? Do write. I shall so want to hear of the dear old things. Every stick
                  and stone, every sweetbrier-bush and huckleberry patch in Oldtown, will always be
                  dear to me. And dear old precious Aunty, what ever set it into her good heart to
                  think of taking poor little me to be her child? and it's too bad that I should
                  leave her so. You know, Horace, I have a small income all my own, and that I mean
                  to give to Aunty."</p>
               <p>Now there were many points in this little valedictory of Tina to which I had no
                  mind to respond, and she looked, as she was speaking, with tears coming in her
                  great soft eyes, altogether too loving and lovely to be a safe companion to one
                  forbidden to hold her in his arms and kiss her, and I felt such a desperate
                  temptation in that direction that I turned suddenly from her. "Does Mr. Davenport
                  approve such a disposition of your income?" said I, in a constrained voice.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Davenport! Mr. High and Mighty," she said, mimicking my constrained tone,
                  "what makes you so sulky to me this morning?"</p>
               <p>"I am not sulky, Tina, only sad," I said.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Horace, don't be sad," she said, coaxingly, and putting her hand
                  through my arm. "Now just be a good boy, and walk up and down with me here a few
                  moments, and let me tell you about things."</p>
               <p>I submitted and let her lead me off passively. "You see, Horace," she said, "I
                  feel for poor old Aunty. Hers seems to me such a dry, desolate life; and I can't
                  help feeling a sort of self-reproach when I think of it. Why should I have health
                  and youth and strength and Ellery, and be going to see all the beauty and glory of
                  Europe, while she sits alone at home, old and poor, and hears the rain drip off
                  from those old lilac-bushes? Oldtown is a nice place, to be sure, but it does rain
                  a great deal there, and she and Polly will be so lonesome without me to make fun
                  for them. Now, Horace, you must promise me to go there as much as you can. You
                  must cultivate Aunty for my sake; and her friendship is worth cultivating for its
                  own sake."</p>
               <p>"I know it," said I; "I am fully aware of the value of her mind and
                  character."</p>
               <p>"You and Harry ought both to visit her," said Tina, "and write to her, and take
                  her advice. Nothing improves a young man faster than such female friendship; it's
                  worth that of dozens of us girls."</p>
               <p>Tina always had a slight proclivity for sermonizing, but a chapter in
                  Ecclesiastes, coming from little preachers with lips and eyes like hers, is
                  generally acceptable.</p>
               <p>"You know," said Tina, "that Aunty has some sort of a trouble on her mind."</p>
               <p>"I know all about it," said I.</p>
               <p>"Did she tell you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said I, "after I had divined it."</p>
               <p>"I made her tell me," said Tina. "When I came home from school, I determined I
                  would not be treated like a child by her any longer,—that she should tell me her
                  troubles, and let me bear them with her. I am young and full of hope, and ought to
                  have troubles to bear. And she is worn out and weary with thinking over and over
                  the same sad story. What a strange thing it is that that sister treats her so! I
                  have been thinking so much about<pb n="562-563" xml:id="VAC7953-00000286"/> her
                  lately, Horace; and, do you know? I had the strangest dream about her last night.
                  I dreamed that Ellery and I were standing at the altar being married, and, all of
                  a sudden, that lady that we saw in the closet and in the garret rose up like a
                  ghost between us."</p>
               <p>"Come, come," said I, "Tina, you are getting nervous. One should n't tell of one's
                  bad dreams, and then one forgets them easier."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Tina, "it made me sad to think that she was a young girl like me,
                  full of hope and joy. They did n't treat her rightly over in that Farnsworth
                  family,—Miss Mehitable told me all about it. O, it was a dreadful story! they
                  perfectly froze her heart with their dreary talk about religion. Horace, I think
                  the most irreligious thing in the world is that way of talking, which takes away
                  our Heavenly Father, and gives only a dreadful Judge. I should not be so happy and
                  so safe as I am now, if I did not believe in a loving God."</p>
               <p>"Tina," said I, "are you satisfied with the religious principles of Mr.
                  Davenport?"</p>
               <p>"I 'm glad you asked me that, Horace, because Mr. Davenport is a man that is very
                  apt to be misunderstood. Nobody really does understand him but me. He has seen so
                  much of cant, and hypocrisy, and pretence of religion, and is so afraid of
                  pretensions that do not mean anything, that I think he goes to the other extreme.
                  Indeed, I have told him so. But he says he is always delighted to hear me talk on
                  religion, and he likes to have me repeat hymns to him; and he told me the other
                  day that he thought the Bible contained finer strains of poetry and eloquence than
                  could be got from all other books put together. Then he has such a wonderful mind,
                  you know. Mr. Avery said that he never saw a person that appreciated all the
                  distinctions of the doctrines more completely than he did. He does n't quite agree
                  with Mr. Avery, nor with anybody; but I think he is very far from being an
                  irreligious man. I believe he thinks very seriously on all these subjects,
                  indeed."</p>
               <p>"I am glad of it," said I, half convinced by her fervor, more than half by the
                  magic of her presence, and the touch of the golden curls that the wind blew
                  against my cheek,—true Venetian curls, brown in the shade and gold in the sun.
                  Certainly, such things as these, if not argument, incline man to be convinced of
                  whatever a fair preacher says; and I thought it not unlikely that Ellery Davenport
                  liked to hear her talk about religion. The conversation was interrupted by the
                  breakfast-bell, which rung us in to an early meal, where we found Miss Debby,
                  brisk and crisp with business and authority, apologizing to Lady Widgery for the
                  unusually early hour, "but, really, so much always to be done in cases like
                  these."</p>
               <p>Breakfast was hurried over, for I was to dress myself, and go to Mr. Davenport's
                  house, and accompany him, as groomsman, to meet Tina and Harry at the church
                  door.</p>
               <p>I remember admiring Ellery Davenport, as I met him this morning, with his easy,
                  high-bred, cordial air, and with that overflow of general benevolence which seems
                  to fill the hearts of happy bridegrooms on the way to the altar. Jealous as I was
                  of the love that ought to be given to the idol of my knight-errantry, I could not
                  but own to myself that Ellery Davenport was most loyally in love.</p>
               <p>Then I have a vision of the old North Church, with its chimes playing, and the
                  pews around the broad aisle filled with expectant guests. The wedding had excited
                  a great deal of attention in the upper circles of Boston. Ellery Davenport was
                  widely known, having been a sort of fashionable meteor, appearing at intervals in
                  the select circles of the city, with all the prestige of foreign travel and
                  diplomatic reputation. Then the little romance of the children had got about, and
                  had proved as sweet a morsel under the tongues of good Bostonians as such spices
                  in the dulness of real life usually do. There was talk everywhere of the little
                  story, and, as usual, nothing was lost in the telling; the beauty and cleverness
                  of the children had been reported from mouth to mouth, until everybody was on
                  tiptoe to see them.</p>
               <p>The Oldtown people, who were used to rising at daybreak, found no difficulty in
                  getting to Boston in season. Uncle Fliakim's almost exhausted wagon had been
                  diligently revamped,<pb n="564-565" xml:id="VAC7953-00000287"/> and his harness
                  assiduously mended, for days beforehand, during which process the good man might
                  have been seen flying like a meteor in an unceasing round, between the store, the
                  blacksmith's shop, my grandfather's, and his own dwelling; and in consequence of
                  these arduous labors, not only his wife, but Aunt Keziah and Hepsy Lawson were
                  secured a free passage to the entertainment.</p>
               <p>Lady Lothrop considerately offered a seat to my grandmother and Aunt Lois in her
                  coach; but my grandmother declined the honor in favor of my mother.</p>
               <p>"It 's all very well," said my grandmother, "and I send my blessing on 'em with
                  all my heart; but my old husband and I are too far along to be rattling our old
                  bones to weddings in Boston. I should n't know how to behave in their grand
                  Episcopal church."</p>
               <p>Aunt Lois, who, like many other good women, had an innocent love of the pomps and
                  vanities, and my mother, to whom the scene was an unheard-of recreation, were, on
                  the whole, not displeased that her mind had taken this turn. As to Sam Lawson, he
                  arose before Aurora had unbarred the gates of dawn, and strode off vigorously on
                  foot, in his best Sunday clothes, and arrived there in time to welcome Uncle
                  Fliakim's wagon, and to tell him that "he 'd ben a lookin' out for 'em these two
                  hours."</p>
               <p>So then for as much as half an hour before the wedding coaches arrived at the
                  church door there was a goodly assemblage in the church, and, while the chimes
                  were solemnly pealing the tune of old Wells, there were bibbing and bobbing of
                  fashionable bonnets, and fluttering of fans, and rustling of silks, and subdued
                  creakings of whalebone stays, and a gentle undertone of gossiping conversation in
                  the expectant audience. Sam Lawson had mounted the organ loft, directly opposite
                  the altar, which commanded a most distinct view of every possible transaction
                  below, and also gave a prominent image of himself, with his lanky jaws, protruding
                  eyes, and shackling figure, posed over all as the inspecting genius of the scene.
                  And every once in a while he conveyed to Jake Marshall pieces of intelligence with
                  regard to the amount of property of private history—the horses, carriages,
                  servants, and most secret internal belongings—of the innocent Bostonians, who were
                  disporting themselves below, in utter ignorance of how much was known about them.
                  But when a man gives himself seriously, for years, to the task of collecting
                  information, thinking nothing of long tramps of twenty miles in the acquisition,
                  never hesitating to put a question and never for getting an answer, it is
                  astonishing what an amount of information he may pick up. In Sam, a valuable
                  reporter of the press has been lost forever. He was born a generation too soon,
                  and the civilization of his time had not yet made a place for him. But not the
                  less did he at this moment feel in himself all the responsibilities of a special
                  reporter for Oldtown.</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy," he said to Jake, when the chimes began to play, "how solemn that
                  'ere does sound! <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'Life is the time to sarve the Lord,</l>
                        <l>The time to insure the gret reward.'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> I ben up in the belfry askin' the ringer what Mr. Devenport 's goin' to give
                  him for ringin' them 'ere chimes; and how much de ye think 't was? Wal, 't was
                  jest fifty dollars, for jest this 'ere one time! an' the weddin' fee 's a goin' t'
                  be a hunderd guineas in a gold puss. I tell yer, Colonel Devenport 's a man as
                  chops his mince putty fine. There 's Parson Lothrop down there; he 's got a spick
                  span new coat an' a new wig! That 's Mis' Lothrop's scarlet Injy shawl; that 'ere
                  cost a hunderd guineas in Injy,—her first husband gin 'er that. Lordy massy, ain't
                  it a providence that Parson Lothrop 's married her? 'cause sence the war that 'ere
                  s'ciety fur sendin' the Gospil to furrin parts don't send nothin' to 'em, an' the
                  Oldtown people they don't pay nothin'. All they can raise they gin to Mr. Mordecai
                  Rossiter, 'cause they say ef they hev to s'port a colleague it 's all they can do,
                  'specially sence he 's married. Yeh see, Mordecai, he wanted to git Tiny, but he
                  could n't come it, and so he 's tuk up with Delily Barker. The folks, some on 'em,
                  kind o' hinted to old Parson Lothrop thet his sermons was n't so interestin' 's
                  they might be, 'n' the parson, ses he, 'Wal, I b'lieve the sermons 's about 's
                  good 's the pay; ain't they?' He hed 'em there. I like Parson Lothrop,—he 's a
                  fine old figger-head, and keeps up stiff for th' honor o' the ministry<pb
                     n="566-567" xml:id="VAC7953-00000288"/> try. Why, folks 's gittin' so nowadays
                  thet ministers won't be no more 'n common folks, 'n' everybody 'll hev their say
                  to 'em jest 's they do to anybody else. Lordy massy, there 's the orgin,—goin' to
                  hev all the glories, orgins 'n' bells 'n' everythin'; guess the procession must
                  ha' started. Mr. Devenport 's got another spick an' span new landau, 't he ordered
                  over from England, special, for this 'casion, an' two prancin' white hosses! Yeh
                  see I got inter Bostin 'bout daybreak, an' I 's around ter his stables a lookin'
                  at 'em a polishin' up their huffs a little, 'n' givin' on 'em a wipe down, 'n' I
                  asked Jenkins what he thought he gin for 'em, an' he sed he reely should n't durst
                  to tell me. I tell ye, he 's like Solomon,—he 's a goin' to make gold as the
                  stones o' the street."</p>
               <p>And while Sam's monologue was going on, in came the bridal procession,—first,
                  Harry, with his golden head and blue eyes, and, leaning on his arm, a cloud of
                  ethereal gauzes and laces, out of which looked a face, pale now as a lily, with
                  wandering curls of golden hair like little gleams of sunlight on white clouds;
                  then the tall, splendid figure of Ellery Davenport, his haughty blue eyes glancing
                  all around with a triumphant assurance. Miss Mehitable hung upon his arm, pale
                  with excitement and emotion. Then came Esther and I. As we passed up the aisle, I
                  heard a confused murmur of whisperings and a subdued drawing in of breath, and the
                  rest all seemed to me to be done in a dream. I heard the words, "Who giveth this
                  woman to be married to this man?" and saw Harry step forth, bold, and bright, and
                  handsome, amid the whisperings that pointed him out as the hero of a little
                  romance. And he gave her away forever,—our darling, our heart of hearts. And then
                  those holy, tender words, those vows so awful, those supporting prayers, all
                  mingled as in a dream, until it was all over, and ladies, laughing and crying,
                  were crowding around Tina, and there were kissing and congratulating and shaking
                  of hands, and then we swept out of the church, and into the carriages, and were
                  whirled back to the Kittery mansion, which was thrown wide open, from garret to
                  cellar, in the very profuseness of old English hospitality.</p>
               <p>There was a splendid lunch laid out in the parlor, with all the old silver in
                  muster, and with all the delicacies that Boston confectioners and caterers could
                  furnish.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport had indeed tendered the services of his French cook, but Miss
                  Debby had respectfully declined the offer.</p>
               <p>"He may be a very good cook, Ellery; I say nothing against him. I am extremely
                  obliged to you for your polite offer, but good English cooking is good enough for
                  me, and I trust that whatever guests I invite will always think it good enough for
                  them."</p>
               <p>On that day, Aunt Lois and Aunt Keziah and my mother and Uncle Fliakim sat down in
                  proximity to some of the very selectest families of Boston, comporting themselves,
                  like good republican Yankees, as if they had been accustomed to that sort of thing
                  all their lives, though secretly embarrassed by many little points of
                  etiquette.</p>
               <p>Tina and Ellery sat at the head of the table, and dispensed hospitalities around
                  them with a gay and gracious freedom; and Harry, in whom the bridal dress of
                  Esther had evidently excited distracting visions of future probabilities, was
                  making his seat by her at dinner an opportunity, in the general clatter of
                  conversation, to enjoy a nice little <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >tête-à-tête.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>Besides the brilliant company in the parlor, a long table was laid out upon the
                  greensward at the back of the house, in the garden, where beer and ale flowed
                  freely, and ham and bread and cheese and cake and eatables of a solid and
                  sustaining description were dispensed to whomsoever would. The humble friends of
                  lover degree—the particular friends of the servants, and all the numerous tribe of
                  dependants and hangers-on; who wished to have some small share in the prosperity
                  of the prosperous—here found ample entertainment. Here Sam Lawson might be seen,
                  seated beside Hepsy, on a garden-seat near the festive board, gallantly pressing
                  upon her the good things of the hour.</p>
               <p>"Eat all ye want ter, Hepsy,—it comes free 's water; ye can hev 'wine an' milk
                  without money 'n' without price,' as 't were. Lordy massy, 's jest what I wanted.
                  I hed sech a stram this<pb n="568-569" xml:id="VAC7953-00000289"/> mornin', 'n'
                  hain't hed nothin' but a two-cent roll, 't I bought 't the baker's. Thought I
                  should ha' caved in 'fore they got through with the weddin'. These 'ere 'Piscopal
                  weddin's is putty long. What d' ye think on 'em, Polly?"</p>
               <p>"I think I like our own way the best," said Polly, stanchly, "none o' your
                  folderol, 'n' kneelin', 'n' puttin' on o' rings."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Hepsy, with the spice of a pepper-box in her eyes, "I liked the part
                  that said, 'With all my worldly goods, I thee endow.'"</p>
               <p>"Thet 's putty well, when a man hes any worldly goods," said Sam; "but how about
                  when he hes n't?"</p>
               <p>"Then he 's no business to git married!" said Hepsy, definitely.</p>
               <p>"So <emph>I</emph> think," said Polly; "but, for my part, I don't want no man's
                  worldly goods, ef I 've got to take him with 'em. I 'd rather work hard as I have
                  done, and hev 'em all to myself, to do just what I please with."</p>
               <p>"Wal, Polly," said Sam, "I dare say the men 's jest o' your mind,—none on 'em
                  won't try very hard to git ye' out on 't."</p>
               <p>"There 's bin those thet hes, though!" said Polly; "but 't ain't wuth talkin'
                  about, any way."</p>
               <p>And so conversation below stairs and above proceeded gayly and briskly, until at
                  last the parting hour came.</p>
               <p>"Now jest all on ye step round ter the front door, an' see 'em go off in their
                  glory. Them two white hosses is imported fresh from England, 'n' they could n't
                  ha' cost less 'n' a thousan' dollars apiece, ef they cost a cent."</p>
               <p>"A thousand!" said Jenkins, the groom, who stood in his best clothes amid the
                  festive throng. "Who told you that?"</p>
               <p>"Wal!" said Sam, "I thought I 'd put the figger low enough, sence ye would n't
                  tell me perticklers. I like to be accurate 'bout these 'ere things. There they be!
                  they 're comin' out the door now. She's tuk off her white dress now, an' got on
                  her travellin' dress, don't ye see? Lordy massy, what a kissin' an' a cryin'! How
                  women allers does go on 'bout these 'ere things! There, he 's got 'er at last. See
                  'em goin' down the steps! ain't they a han'some couple! There, he 's handin' on
                  'er in. The kerrige's lined with blue satin, 'n' never was sot in afore this
                  mornin'. Good luck go with 'em! There they go."</p>
               <p>And we all of us stood on the steps of the Kittery mansion, kissing hands and
                  waving handkerchiefs, until the beloved one, the darling of our hearts, was out of
                  sight.</p>

               <head type="sub">WEDDING AFTER-TALKS AT OLDTOWN.</head>
               <p>WEDDING joys are commonly supposed to pertain especially to the two principal
                  personages, and to be of a kind with which the world doth not intermeddle; but a
                  wedding in such a quiet and monotonous state of existence as that of Oldtown is
                  like a glorious sunset, which leaves a long after-glow, in which trees and rocks,
                  farm-houses, and all the dull, commonplace landscape of real life have, for a
                  while, a roseate hue of brightness. And then the long after-talks, the deliberate
                  turnings and revampings, and the re-enjoying, bit by bit, of every incident!</p>
               <p>Sam Lawson was a man who knew how to make the most of this, and for a week or two
                  he reigned triumphant in Oldtown on the strength of it. Others could relate the
                  bare, simple facts, but Sam Lawson could give the wedding, with variations, with
                  marginal references, and explanatory notes, and enlightening comments, that ran
                  deep into the history of everybody present. So that even those who had been at the
                  wedding did not know half what they had seen until Sam told them.</p>
               <p>It was now the second evening after that auspicious event. Aunt Lois and my mother
                  had been pressed to prolong their stay over one night after the wedding, to share
                  the hospitalities of the Kittery mansion, and had been taken around in the Kittery
                  carriage to see the wonders of Boston town. But prompt, on their return, Sam came
                  in to assist them in dishing up information by the evening fireside.</p>
               <p>"Wal, Mis' Badger," said he, "'t was gin'ally agreed, on all hands, there had n't
                  ben no weddin' like it seen in Boston sence the time them court folks and nobility
                  used to be there. Old Luke there, that rings the chimes, he told me he hed n't
                  seen no sech couple go up the broad aisle o' that church. Luke, says he to me, 'I
                  tell yew, the grander o' Boston is here to-day,' and ye'd better b'lieve every one
                  on 'em had on their Sunday best. There was the Boylstons, an' the Bowdoins, an'
                  the Brattles, an' the Winthrops, an' the Bradfords, an' the Penhallows up from
                  Portsmouth, an' the Quinceys, an' the Sewells. Wal, I tell yer, there was real
                  grit there!—folks that come in their grand kerridges I tell you!—there was such a
                  pawin' and a stampin' o' horses and kerridges round the church as if all the army
                  of the Assyrians was there!"</p>
               <p>"Well, now, I 'm glad I did n't go," said my grandmother. "I 'm too old to go into
                  any such grandeur."</p>
               <p>"Wal, I don't see why folks hes so much 'bjections to these here 'Piscopal
                  weddin's, neither," said Sam. "I tell yer, it 's a kind o' putty sight now; ye see
                  I was up in the organ loft, where I could look down on the heads of all the
                  people. Massy to us! the bunnets, an' the feathers, an' the Injy shawls, an' the
                  purple an' fine linen, was all out on the 'casion. An' when our Harry come in with
                  Tiny on his arm, tha' was a gineral kind o' buzz, an' folks a risin' up all over
                  the house to look at 'em. Her dress was yer real Injy satin, thick an' yaller,
                  kind o' like cream. An' she had on the Pierpont pearls an' diamonds—"</p>
               <p>"How did you know what she had on?" said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"O, I hes ways o' findin' out!" said Sam. "Yeh know old Gineral Pierpont, his
                  gret-gret-grandfather, was a gineral in the British army in Injy, an' he racketed
                  round 'mong them nabobs out there, an' got no end o' gold an' precious stones, an'
                  these 'ere pearls an' diamonds that she wore on her neck and in her ears hes come
                  down in the Devenport family. Mis' Delily, Miss Deborah Kittery's maid, she told
                  me all the particulars 'bout it, an' she ses there ain't no family so rich in
                  silver and jewels, and sich, as Ellery Devenport's is, an' hes ben for generations
                  back. His house is jest chock-full of all sorts o' graven images and queer things
                  from Chiny an' Japan, 'cause, ye see, his ancestors they traded to Injy, an' they
                  seem to hev got the abundance o' the Gentiles flowin' to 'em."</p>
               <p>"I noticed those pearls on her neck," said Aunt Lois; "I never saw such
                  pearls."</p>
               <pb n="572-573" xml:id="VAC7953-00000291"/>
               <p>"Wal," said Sam, "Mis' Delily, she ses she's tried 'em 'long-side of a good-sized
                  pea, an' they 're full as big. An' the earrings 's them pear-shaped pearls, ye
                  know, with diamond nubs atop on 'em. Then there was a great pearl cross, an' the
                  biggest kind of a diamond right in the middle on 't. Wal, Mis' Delily she told me
                  a story 'bout them 'ere pearls," said Sam. "For my part, ef it hed ben a daughter
                  o' mine, I 'd ruther she 'd 'a' worn suthin' on her neck that was spic an' span
                  new. I tell yew, these 'ere old family jewels, I think sometimes they gits kind o'
                  struck through an' through with moth an' rust, so to speak."</p>
               <p>"I'm sure I don't know what you mean, Sam," said Aunt Lois, literally, "since we
                  know gold can't rust, and pearls and diamonds don't hurt with any amount of
                  keeping."</p>
               <p>"Wal, ye see, they do say that 'ere old Gineral Pierpont was a putty hard
                  customer; he got them 'ere pearls an' diamonds away from an Injun princess; I
                  s'pose she thought she 'd as much right to 'em 's he hed; an' they say 't was
                  about all she hed was her jewels, an' so nat'rally enough she cussed him for
                  taking on 'em. Wal, dunno's the Lord minds the cusses o' these poor old heathen
                  critturs; but's ben a fact, Mis' Delily says, thet them jewels hain't never
                  brought good luck. Gineral Pierpont, he gin 'em to his fust wife, an' she did n't
                  live but two months arter she was married. He gin 'em to his second wife, 'n' she
                  tuck to drink and le'd him sech a lift 't he would n't ha' cared ef she had died
                  too; 'n' then they come down to Ellery Devenport's first wife, 'n' she went ravin'
                  crazy the fust year arter she was married. Now all that 'ere does look a little
                  like a cuss; don't it?"</p>
               <p>"O nonsense, Sam!" said Aunt Lois, "I don't believe there 's a word of truth in
                  any of it! You can hatch more stories in one day than a hen can eggs in a
                  month."</p>
               <p>"Wal, any way," said Sam, "I like the 'Piscopal sarvice, all 'ceppin' the
                  minister's wearin' his shirt outside; that I don't like."</p>
               <p>"'T is n't a shirt!" said Aunt Lois, indignantly.</p>
               <p>"O lordy massy!" said Sam, "I know what they calls it. I know it's a surplice, but
                  it looks for all the world like a man in his shirt-sleeves; but the words is real
                  solemn. I wondered when he asked 'em all whether they hed any objections to 't,
                  an' told 'em to speak up ef they hed, what would happen ef anybody should speak up
                  jest there."</p>
               <p>"Why, of course 't would stop the wedding," said Aunt Lois, "until the thing was
                  inquired into."</p>
               <p>"Wal, Jake Marshall, he said thet he'd heerd a story when he was a boy, about a
                  weddin' in a church 'at Portsmouth, that was stopped jest there, 'cause, ye see,
                  the man he hed another wife livin.' He said't was old Colonel Penhallow. 'Mazin'
                  rich the old Colonel was, and these 'ere rich old cocks sometimes does seem to
                  strut round and cut up pretty much as if they hed n't heard o' no God in their
                  parts. The Colonel he got his wife shet up in a lunatic asylum, an' then spread
                  the word that she was dead, an' courted a gal, and come jest as near as that to
                  marryin' of her."</p>
               <p>"As near as what?" said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"Why, when they got to that 'ere part of the service, there was his wife, good as
                  new. She 'd got out o' the 'sylum, and stood up there 'fore 'em all. So you see
                  that 'ere does some good."</p>
               <p>"I 'd rather stay in an asylum all my life than go back to that man," said Aunt
                  Lois.</p>
               <p>"Wal, you see she did n't," said Sam; "her friends they made him make a settlement
                  on her, poor woman, and he cleared out t' England."</p>
               <p>"Good riddance to bad rubbish," said my grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Wal, how handsome that 'ere gal is that Harry 's going to marry!" continued Sam.
                  "She did n't have on nothin' but white muslin', an' not a snip of a jewel; but she
                  looked like a queen. Ses I to Jake, ses I, there goes the woman 't 'll be Lady
                  Percival one o' these days, over in England, an' I bet ye, he 'll find lots o'
                  family jewels for her, over there. Mis' Delily she said she did n't doubt there
                  would be."</p>
               <p>"I hope," said my grandmother, "that she will have more enduring riches than that;
                  it 's small matter about earthly jewels."</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy, yes, Mis' Badger," said Sam, "jes' so, jes' so; now that 'ere was
                  bein' impressed on my mind all the time.<pb n="574-575" xml:id="VAC7953-00000292"
                  /> Folks oughtenter lay up their treasures on airth; I could n't help thinkin' on
                  't, when I see Tiny a wearin' them jewels, jest how vain an' transitory everythin'
                  is, an' how the women 't has worn 'em afore is all turned to dust, an' lyin' in
                  their graves. Lordy massy, these 'ere things make us realize what a transitory
                  world we 's a livin' in. I was tellin' Hepsy 'bout it,—she 's so kind o' worldly,
                  Hepsy is,—seemed to make her feel so kind o' gritty to see so much wealth 'n'
                  splendor, when we hed n't none. Ses I, 'Hepsy, there ain't no use o' wantin'
                  worldly riches, 'cause our lives all passes away like a dream, an' a hundred years
                  hence 't won't make no sort o' diffurnce what we 've hed, an' what we heve n't
                  hed.' But wal, Miss Lois, <emph>did</emph> ye see the kerridge?" said Sam,
                  returning to temporal things with renewed animation.</p>
               <p>"I just got a glimpse of it," said Aunt Lois, "as it drove to the door."</p>
               <p>"Lordy massy," said Sam, "I was all over that 'ere kerridge that mornin' by
                  daylight. 'T ain't the one he had up here,—that was jest common doin's,—this 'ere
                  is imported spic an' span new from England for the 'casion, an' all made jest 's
                  they make 'em for the nobility. Why, 't was all quilted an' lined with blue satin,
                  ever so grand, an' Turkey carpet under their feet, an' the springs was easy 's a
                  rockin'-chair. That 's what they 've gone off in. Wal, lordy massy! I don't grudge
                  Tina nothin'! She 's the chipperest, light-heartedest, darlin'est little creetur
                  that ever did live, an' I hope she 'll hev good luck in all things."</p>
               <p>A rap was heard at the kitchen door, and Polly entered. It was evident from her
                  appearance that she was in a state of considerable agitation. She looked pale and
                  excited, and her hands shook.</p>
               <p>"Mis' Badger," she said to my grandmother, "Miss Rossiter wants to know 'f you
                  won't come an' set up with her to-night."</p>
               <p>"Why, is she sick?" said grandmother. "What's the matter with her?"</p>
               <p>"She ain't very well," said Polly, evasively; "she wanted Mis' Badger to spend the
                  night with her."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, mother, I 'd better go over," said Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"No, Miss Lois," said Polly, eagerly, "Miss Rossiter don't wanter see anybody but
                  yer mother."</p>
               <p>"Wal, now I wanter know!" said Sam Lawson.</p>
               <p>"Well, you can't know everything," said Aunt Lois, "so you <emph>may</emph>
                  want!"</p>
               <p>"Tell Miss Rossiter, ef I can do anythin' for 'er, I hope she 'll call on me,"
                  said Sam.</p>
               <p>My grandmother and Polly went out together. Aunt Lois bustled about the hearth,
                  swept it up, and then looked out into the darkness after them. What could it
                  be?</p>
               <p>The old clock ticked drowsily in the kitchen corner, and her knitting-needles
                  rattled.</p>
               <p>"What do you think it is?" said my mother, timidly, to Aunt Lois.</p>
               <p>"How should I know?" said Aunt Lois, sharply.</p>
               <p>In a few moments Polly returned again.</p>
               <p>"Miss Mehitable says she would like to see Sam Lawson."</p>
               <p>"O, wal, wal, would she? Wal, I 'll come!" said Sam, rising with joyful alertness.
                  "I 'm allers ready at a minute's warnin'!"</p>
               <p>And they went out into the darkness together.</p>

               <head type="sub">BEHIND THE CURTAIN.</head>
               <p>IN the creed of most story-tellers marriage is equal to translation. The mortal
                  pair whose fortunes are traced to the foot of the altar forthwith ascend, and a
                  cloud receives them out of our sight as the curtain falls. Faith supposes them
                  rapt away to some unseen paradise, and every-day toil girds up its loins and with
                  a sigh prepares to return to its delving and grubbing.</p>
               <p>But our story must follow the fortunes of our heroine beyond the prescribed
                  limits.</p>
               <p>It had been arranged that the wedding pair, after a sunny afternoon's drive
                  through some of the most picturesque scenery in the neighborhood of Boston, should
                  return at eventide to their country home, where they were to spend a short time
                  preparatory to sailing for Europe. Even in those early days the rocky glories of
                  Nahant and its dashing waves were known and resorted to by Bostonians, and the
                  first part of the drive was thitherward, and Tina climbed round among the rocks,
                  exulting like a sea-bird with Ellery Davenport ever at her side, laughing,
                  admiring, but holding back her bold, excited footsteps, lest she should plunge
                  over by some unguarded movement, and become a vanished dream.</p>
               <p>So near lies the ever possible tragedy at the hour of our greatest exultation; it
                  is but a false step, an inadvertent movement, and all that was joy can become a
                  cruel mockery! We all know this to be so. We sometimes start and shriek when we
                  see it to be so in the case of others, but who is the less triumphant in his hour
                  of possession for this gloomy shadow of possibility that forever dogs his
                  steps?</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport was now in the high tide of victory. The pursuit of the hour was
                  a success; he had captured the butterfly. In his eagerness he had trodden down and
                  disregarded many teachings ings and impulses of his better nature that should have
                  made him hesitate; but now he felt that he <emph>had</emph> her; she was his,—his
                  alone and forever.</p>
               <p>But already dark thoughts from the past were beginning to flutter out like
                  ill-omened bats, and dip down on gloomy wing between him and the innocent, bright,
                  confiding face. Tina he could see had idealized him entirely. She had invested him
                  with all her conceptions of knighthood, honor, purity, religion, and made a
                  creation of her own of him; and sometimes he smiled to himself, half amused and
                  half annoyed at the very young and innocent simplicity of the matter. Nobody knew
                  better than himself that what she dreamed he was he neither was nor meant to
                  be,—that in fact there could not be a bitterer satire on his real self than her
                  conceptions; but just now, with her brilliant beauty, her piquant earnestness, her
                  perfect freshness, there was an indescribable charm about her that bewitched
                  him.</p>
               <p>Would it all pass away and get down to the jog-trot dustiness of ordinary married
                  life, he wondered, and then, ought he not to have been a little more fair with her
                  in exchange for the perfect transparence with which she threw open the whole of
                  her past life to him? Had he not played with her as some villain might with a
                  little child, and got away a priceless diamond for a bit of painted glass? He did
                  not allow himself to think in that direction.</p>
               <p>"Come, my little sea-gull," he said to her, after they had wandered and rambled
                  over the rocks for a while, "you must come down from that perch, and we must drive
                  on, if we mean to be at home before midnight."</p>
               <p>"O Ellery, how glorious it is!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but we cannot build here three tabernacles, and so we must say, <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Au revoir.</foreign> I will bring you here again";—and Ellery
                  half led, half carried her in his arms back to the carriage.</p>
               <p>"How beautiful it is!" said Tina, as they were glancing along a turfy road through
                  the woods. The white pines were just putting out their long fingers, the new
                  leaves of the silvery birches were twinkling in the light, the road was fringed on
                  both sides with great patches of the blue violet, and sweet-fern, and bayberry,<pb
                     n="578-579" xml:id="VAC7953-00000294"/> and growing green tips of young spruce
                  and fir were exhaling a spicy perfume. "It seems as if we two alone were flying
                  through fairy-land." His arm was around her, tightening its clasp of possession as
                  he looked down on her.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he said, "we two are alone in our world now; none can enter it; none can
                  see into it; none can come between us."</p>
               <p>Suddenly the words recalled to Tina her bad dream of the night before. She was on
                  the point of speaking of it, but hesitated to introduce it; she felt a strange
                  shyness in mentioning that subject.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport turned the conversation upon things in foreign lands, which he
                  would soon show her. He pictured to her the bay of Naples, the rocks of Sorrento,
                  where the blue Mediterranean is overhung with groves of oranges, where they should
                  have a villa some day, and live in a dream of beauty. All things fair and bright
                  and beautiful in foreign lands were evoked, and made to come as a sort of airy
                  pageant around them while they wound through the still, spicy pine-woods.</p>
               <p>It was past sunset, and the moon was looking white and sober through the flush of
                  the evening sky, when they entered the grounds of their own future home.</p>
               <p>"How different everything looks here from what it did when I was here years ago!"
                  said Tina,—"the paths are all cleared, and then it was one wild, dripping tangle.
                  I remember how long we knocked at the door, and could n't make any one hear, and
                  the old black knocker frightened me,—it was a black serpent with his tail in his
                  mouth. I wonder if it is there yet."</p>
               <p>"O, to be sure it is," said Ellery; "that is quite a fine bit of old bronze, after
                  something in Herculaneum, I think; you know serpents were quite in vogue among the
                  ancients."</p>
               <p>"I should think that symbol meant eternal evil," said Tina,—"a circle is eternity,
                  and a serpent is evil."</p>
               <p>"You are evidently prejudiced against serpents, my love," said Ellery. "The
                  ancients thought better of them; they were emblems of wisdom, and the ladies very
                  appropriately wore them for bracelets and necklaces."</p>
               <p>"I would n't have one for the world," said Tina. "I always hated them, they are so
                  bright, and still, and sly."</p>
               <p>"Mere prejudice," said Ellery, laughing. "I must cure it by giving you, one of
                  these days, an emerald-green serpent for a bracelet, with ruby crest and diamond
                  eyes; you've no idea what pretty fellows they are. But here, you see, we are
                  coming to the house; you can smell the roses."</p>
               <p>"How lovely and how changed!" said Tina. "O, what a world of white roses over that
                  portico,—roses everywhere, and white lilacs. It is a perfect paradise!"</p>
               <p>"May you find it so, my little Eve,"said Ellery Davenport, as the carriage stopped
                  at the door. Ellery sprang out lightly, and, turning, took Tina in his arms and
                  set her down in the porch.</p>
               <p>They stood there a moment in the moonlight, and listened to the fainter patter of
                  the horses' feet as they went down the drive.</p>
               <p>"Come in, my little wife," said Ellery, opening the door, "and may the black
                  serpent bring you good luck."</p>
               <p>The house was brilliantly lighted by wax candles in massive silver
                  candlesticks.</p>
               <p>"O, how strangely altered!" said Tina, running about, and looking into the rooms
                  with the delight of a child. "How beautiful everything is!"</p>
               <p>The housekeeper, a respectable female, now appeared and offered her services to
                  conduct her young mistress to her rooms. Ellery went with her, almost carrying her
                  up the staircase on his arm. Above, as below, all was light and bright. "This room
                  is ours," said Ellery, drawing her into that chamber which Tina remembered years
                  before as so weirdly desolate. Now it was all radiant with hangings and furniture
                  of blue and silver; the open windows let in branches of climbing white roses, the
                  vases were full of lilies. The housekeeper paused a moment at the door.</p>
               <p>"There is a lady in the little parlor below that has been waiting more than an
                  hour to see you and madam," she said.</p>
               <p>"A lady!" said both Tina and Ellery, in tones of surprise. "Did she give her
                  name?" said Ellery.</p>
               <p>"She gave no name; but she said that you, sir, would know her."</p>
               <p>"I can't imagine who it should be," said Ellery. "Perhaps,<pb n="580-581"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000295"/> Tina, I had better go down and see while you are
                  dressing," said Ellery.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, that would be a pretty way to do! No, sir, I allow no private
                  interviews," said Tina, with authority,—"no, I am all ready and quite dressed
                  enough to go down.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, little positive," said Ellery, "be it as you will; let's go
                  together."</p>
               <p>"Well, I must confess," said Tina, "I did n't look for wedding callers out here
                  to-night; but never mind, it's a nice little mystery to see what she wants."</p>
               <p>They went down the staircase together, passed across the hall, and entered the
                  little boudoir, where Tina and Harry had spent their first night together. The
                  door of the writing cabinet stood open, and a lady all in black, in a bonnet and
                  cloak, stood in the doorway.</p>
               <p>As she came forward, Tina exclaimed, "O Ellery, it is she,—the lady in the
                  closet!" and sank down pale and half fainting.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport turned pale too; his cheeks, his very lips were blanched like
                  marble; he looked utterly thunderstruck and appalled.</p>
               <p>"Emily!" he said. "Great God!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Emily!" she said, coming forward slowly and with dignity. "You did not
                  expect to meet ME here and now, Ellery Davenport!"</p>
               <p>There was for a moment a silence that was perfectly awful. Tina looked on without
                  power to speak, as in a dreadful dream. The ticking of the little French mantel
                  clock seemed like a voice of doom to her.</p>
               <p>The lady walked close up to Ellery Davenport, drew forth a letter, and spoke in
                  that fearfully calm way that comes from the very white-heat of passion.</p>
               <p>"Ellery," she said, "here is your letter. You did not <emph>know</emph> me—you
                  could not know me—if you thought, after <emph>that letter,</emph> I would accept
                  anything from you! <emph>I</emph> live on your bounty! I would sooner work as a
                  servant!"</p>
               <p>"Ellery, Ellery!" said Tina, springing up and clasping his arm, "O, tell me who
                  she is! What is she to you? Is she—is she—"</p>
               <p>"Be quiet, my poor child," said the woman, turning to her with an air of
                  authority. "I have no claims; I come to make none. Such as this man is, <emph>he
                     is your husband,</emph> not mine. You believe in him; so did I,—love him; so
                  did I. I gave up all for him,—country, home, friends, name, reputation,—for I
                  thought him such a man that a woman might well sacrifice her whole life to him! He
                  is the father of my child! But fear not. The world, of course, will approve
                     <emph>him</emph> and condemn <emph>me.</emph> They will say he did well to give
                  up his mistress and take a wife; it's the world's morality. What woman will think
                  the less of him, or smile the less on him, when she hears it? What woman will not
                  feel herself too good even to touch my hand?"</p>
               <p>"Emily," said Ellery Davenport, bitterly, "if you thought I deserved this, you
                  might, at least, have spared this poor child."</p>
               <p>"<emph>The truth</emph> is the best foundation in married life, Ellery," she said,
                  "and the truth you have small faculty for speaking. I do her a favor in telling
                  it. Let her start fair from the commencement, and then there will be no more to be
                  told. Besides," she added, "I shall not trouble you long. <emph>There,</emph>" she
                  said, putting down a jewel-case,—"there are your gifts to me,—there are your
                  letters." Then she threw on the table a miniature set in diamonds, "There is your
                  picture. And now God help me! Farewell."</p>
               <p>She turned and glided swiftly from the room.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Readers who remember the former part of this narrative will see at once that it
                  was, after all, Ellery Davenport with whom, years before, Emily Rossiter had fled
                  to France. They had resided there, and subsequently in Switzerland, and she had
                  devoted herself to him, and to his interests, with all the single-hearted fervor
                  of a true wife.</p>
               <p>On her part, there was a full and conscientious belief that the choice of the
                  individuals alone constituted a true marriage, and that the laws of human society
                  upon this subject were an oppression which needed to be protested against.</p>
               <p>On his part, however, the affair was a simple gratification of passion, and the
                  principles, such as they were, were used by him<pb n="582-583"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000296"/> as he used all principles,—simply, as convenient
                  machinery for carrying out his own purposes. Ellery Davenport spoke his own
                  convictions when he said that there was no subject which had not its right and its
                  wrong side, each of them capable of being unanswerably sustained. He had played
                  with his own mind in this manner until he had entirely obliterated conscience. He
                  could at any time dazzle and confound his own moral sense with his own reasonings;
                  and it was sometimes amusing, but, in the long run, tedious and vexatious to him,
                  to find that what he maintained merely for convenience and for theory should be
                  regarded by Emily so seriously, and with such an earnest eye to logical
                  consequences. In short, the two came, in the course of their intimacy, precisely
                  to the spot to which many people come who are united by an indissoluble legal tie.
                  Slowly, and through an experience of many incidents, they had come to perceive an
                  entire and irrepressible conflict of natures between them.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding that Emily had taken a course diametrically opposed to the
                  principles of her country and her fathers, she retained largely the Puritan
                  nature. Instances have often been seen in New England of men and women who had
                  renounced every particle of the Puritan theology, and yet retained in their fibre
                  and composition all the moral traits of the Puritans—their uncompromising
                  conscientiousness, their inflexible truthfulness, and their severe logic in
                  following the convictions of their understandings. And the fact was, that while
                  Emily had sacrificed for Ellery Davenport her position in society,—while she had
                  exposed herself to the very coarsest misconstructions of the commonest minds, and
                  made herself liable to be ranked by her friends in New England among abandoned
                  outcasts,—she was really a woman standing on too high a moral plane for Ellery
                  Davenport to consort with her in comfort. He was ambitious, intriguing,
                  unscrupulous, and it was an annoyance to him to be obliged to give an account of
                  himself to her. He was tired of playing the moral hero, the part that he assumed
                  and acted with great success during the time of their early attachment. It annoyed
                  him to be held to any consistency in principles. The very devotion to him which
                  she felt, regarding him, as she always did, in his higher and nobler nature, vexed
                  and annoyed him.</p>
               <p>Of late years he had taken long vacations from her society, in excursions to
                  England and America. When the prospect of being ambassador to England dawned upon
                  him, he began seriously to consider the inconvenience of being connected with a
                  woman unpresentable in society. He dared not risk introducing her into those high
                  circles as his wife. Moreover, he knew that it was a falsehood to which he never
                  should gain her consent; and running along in the line of his thoughts came his
                  recollections of Tina. When he returned to America, with the fact in his mind that
                  she would be the acknowledged daughter of a respectable old English family, all
                  her charms and fascinations had a double power over him. He delivered himself up
                  to them without scruple.</p>
               <p>He wrote immediately to a confidential friend in Switzerland, enclosing money,
                  with authority to settle upon Emily a villa near Geneva, and a suitable income. He
                  trusted to her pride for the' rest.</p>
               <p>Never had the thought come into his head that she would return to her native
                  country, and brave all the reproach and humiliation of such a step, rather than
                  accept this settlement at his hands.</p>

               <p>HARRY and I had gone back to our college room after the wedding. There we received
                  an earnest letter from Miss Mehitable, begging us to come to her at once. It was
                  brought by Sam Lawson, who told us that he had got up at three o'clock in the
                  morning to start away with it.</p>
               <p>"There's trouble of some sort or other in that 'ere house," said Sam. "Last night
                  I was in ter the Deacon's, and we was a talkin' over the weddin', when Polly came
                  in all sort o' flustered, and said Miss Rossiter wanted to see Mis' Badger; and
                  your granny she went over, and did n't come home all night. She sot up with
                  somebody, and I 'm certain 't wa' n't Miss Rossiter, 'cause I see her up tol'able
                  spry in the mornin'; but, lordy massy, somethin' or other 's ben a usin' on her
                  up, for she was all wore out, and looked sort o' limpsy, as if there wa' n't no
                  starch left in her. She sent for me last night. 'Sam,' says she, 'I want to send a
                  note to the boys just as quick as I can, and I don't want to wait for the mail;
                  can't you carry it?' 'Lordy massy, yes,'says I. 'I hope there ain't nothin'
                  happened,' says I; and ye see she did n't answer me; and puttin' that with Mis'
                  Badger's settin' there all night, it 'peared to me there was suthin'. I can't make
                  out quite what."</p>
               <p>Harry and I lost no time in going to the stage-house, and found ourselves by noon
                  at Miss Mehitable's door.</p>
               <p>When we went in, we found Miss Mehitable seated in close counsel with Mr. Jonathan
                  Rossiter. His face looked sharp, and grave, and hard; his large gray eyes had in
                  them a fiery, excited gleam. Spread out on the table before them were files of
                  letters, in the handwriting of which I had before had a glimpse. The brother and
                  sister had evidently been engaged in reading them, as some of them lay open under
                  their hands.</p>
               <p>When we came into the room, both looked up. Miss Mehitable rose, and offered her
                  hands to us in an eager, excited way, as if she were asking something of us. The
                  color flashed into Mr. Rossiter's cheeks, and he suddenly leaned forward over the
                  papers and covered his face with his hands. It was a gesture of shame and
                  humiliation infinitely touching to me.</p>
               <p>"Horace," said Miss Mehitable, "the thing we feared has come upon us. O Horace,
                  Horace! why could we not have known it in time?"</p>
               <p>I divined at once. My memory, like an electric chain, flashed back over sayings
                  and incidents of years.</p>
               <p>"The villain!" I said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rossiter ground his foot on the floor with a hard, impatient movement, as if
                  he were crushing some poisonous reptile.</p>
               <p>"It's well for him that <emph>I</emph>'m not God," he said through his closed
                  teeth.</p>
               <p>Harry looked from one to the other of us in dazed and inquiring surprise. He had
                  known in a vague way of Emily's disappearance, and of Miss Mehitable's anxieties,
                  but it never had occurred to his mind to connect the two. In fact, our whole
                  education had been in such a wholesome and innocent state of society, that neither
                  of us had the foundation, in our experience or habits of thought, for the
                  conception of anything like villany. We were far enough from any comprehension of
                  the melodramatic possibilities suggested in our days by that heaving and tumbling,
                  modern literature, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</p>
               <p>Never shall I forget the shocked, incredulous expression on Harry's face as he
                  listened to my explanations, nor the indignation to which it gave place.</p>
               <p>"I would sooner have seen Tina in her grave than married to such a man," he said
                  huskily.</p>
               <p>"O Harry!" said Miss Mehitable.</p>
               <p>"I would!" he said, rising excitedly. "There are things that men can do that still
                  leave hope of them; but a thing like this is <emph>final,</emph>—it is
                  decisive."</p>
               <p>"That is my opinion, Harry," said Mr. Rossiter. "It is a sin that leaves no place
                  for repentance."</p>
               <pb n="586-587" xml:id="VAC7953-00000298"/>
               <p>"We have been reading these letters," said Miss Mehitable; "they were sent to us
                  by Tina, and they do but confirm what I always said,—that Emily fell by her higher
                  nature. She learned, under Dr. Stern, to think and to reason boldly, even when
                  differing from received opinion; and this hardihood of mind and opinion she soon
                  turned upon the doctrines he taught. Then she abandoned the Bible, and felt
                  herself free to construct her own system of morals. Then came an intimate
                  friendship with a fascinating married man, whose domestic misfortunes made a
                  constant demand on her sympathy; and these charming French friends of hers—who
                  were, as far as I see, disciples, of the new style of philosophy, and had come to
                  America to live in a union with each other which was not recognized by the laws of
                  France—all united to make her feel that she was acting heroically and virtuously
                  in sacrificing her whole life to her lover, and disregarding what they called the
                  tyranny of human law. In Emily's eyes, her connection had all the sacredness of
                  marriage."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Mr. Rossiter, "but see now how all these infernal, fine-spun, and
                  high-flown notions always turn out to the disadvantage of the weaker party! It is
                     <emph>man</emph> who always takes advantage of woman in relations like these;
                  it is she that <emph>gives</emph> all, and he that <emph>takes</emph> all; it is
                  she risks everything, and he risks nothing. Hard as marriage bonds bear in
                  individual cases, it is for woman's interest that they should be as stringently
                  maintained as the Lord himself has left them. When once they begin to be lessened,
                  it is always the weaker party that goes to the wall!"</p>
               <p>"But," said I, "suppose a case of confirmed and hopeless insanity on either
                  side."</p>
               <p>He made an impatient gesture. "Did you ever think," he said, "If men had the laws
                  of nature in their hands, what a mess they would make of them? What treatises we
                  should have against the cruelty of fire in <emph>always</emph> burning, and of
                  water in <emph>always</emph> drowning! What saints and innocents has the fire
                  tortured, and what just men made perfect has water drowned, making <emph>no</emph>
                  exceptions! But who doubts that this inflexibility in natural law is, after all,
                  the best thing? The laws of morals are in our hands, and so reversible, and,
                  therefore, we are always clamoring for exceptions. I think they should cut their
                  way like those of nature, <emph>inflexibly and eternally!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Here the sound of wheels startled us. I went to the window, and, looking through
                  the purple spikes of the tall old lilacs, which came up in a bower around the open
                  window, I saw Tina alighting from a carriage.</p>
               <p>"O Aunty," I said involuntarily, "it is she. <emph>She</emph> is coming, poor
                  child."</p>
               <p>We heard a light fluttering motion and a footfall on the stairs, and the door
                  opened, and in a moment Tina stood among us.</p>
               <p>She was very pale, and there was an expression such as I never saw in her face
                  before. There had been a shock which had driven her soul inward, from the earthly
                  upon the spiritual and the immortal. Something deep and pathetic spoke in her
                  eyes, as she looked around on each of us for a moment without speaking. As she met
                  Miss Mehitable's haggard, careworn face, her lip quivered. She ran to her, threw
                  her arms round her, and hid her face on her shoulder, and sobbed out, 'O Aunty,
                  Aunty! I did n't think I should live to make you this trouble."</p>
               <p>"You, darling!" said Miss Mehitable. "It is not <emph>you</emph> who have made
                  it."</p>
               <p>"I am the cause," she said. "I know that he has done dreadfully wrong, I cannot
                  defend him, but oh! I love him still. I cannot help loving him; it is my duty to,"
                  she added. "I promised, you know, before God, 'for better, for worse'; and what I
                  promised I must keep. I am his wife; there is no going back from that."</p>
               <p>"I know it, darling," said Miss Mehitable, stroking her head. "You are right, and
                  my love for <emph>you</emph> will never change."</p>
               <p>"I am come," she said, "to see what can be done."</p>
               <p>"NOTHING <emph>can be done!</emph>" spoke out the deep voice of Jonathan Rossiter.
                  "She is lost and we disgraced beyond remedy!"</p>
               <p>"You must not say that," Tina said, raising her head, her eyes sparkling through
                  her tears with some of her old vivacity. "Your sister is a noble, injured woman.
                  We must shield her and save her; there is every excuse for her."</p>
               <pb n="588-589" xml:id="VAC7953-00000299"/>
               <p>"There is NEVER any excuse for such conduct," said Mr. Rossiter, harshly.</p>
               <p>Tina started up in her headlong, energetic fashion. "What right have you to talk
                  so, if you call yourself a Christian?" she said. "Think a minute. WHO was it said,
                  'Neither do I condemn thee'? and <emph>whom</emph> did he say it to? Christ was
                  not afraid or ashamed to say <emph>that</emph> to a poor friendless woman, though
                  he knew his words would never pass away."</p>
               <p>"God bless you, darling,—God bless you!" said Miss Mehitable, clasping her in her
                  arms.</p>
               <p>"I have read those letters," continued Tina, impetuously. "He did not like me to
                  do it, but I claimed it as my right, and I <emph>would</emph> do it, and I can see
                  in all a noble woman, gone astray from noble motives. I can see that she was grand
                  and unselfish in her love, that she was perfectly self-sacrificing, and I believe
                  it was because Jesus understood these things in the hearts of women that he
                  uttered those blessed words. The law was against that poor woman, the doctors, the
                  Scribes and Pharisees, all respectable people, were against her, and Christ
                  stepped between all and her; he sent them away abashed and humbled, and spoke
                  those lovely words to her. O, I shall forever adore him for it! He is my Lord and
                  my God!"</p>
               <p>There was a pause for a few moments, and then Tina spoke again.</p>
               <p>"Now, Aunty, hear my plan. You, perhaps, do not believe any good of
                     <emph>him,</emph> and so I will not try to make you; only I will say that he is
                  anxious to do all he can. He has left everything in my hands. This must go no
                  farther than us few who now know it. Your sister refused the property he tried to
                  settle on her. It was noble to do it. I should have felt just as she did. But,
                  dear Aunty, <emph>my</emph> fortune I always meant to settle on you, and it will
                  be enough for you both. It will make you easy as to money, and you can live
                  together."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear," said Miss Mehitable; "but how can this be kept secret when there
                  is the child?"</p>
               <p>"I have thought of that, Aunty. I will take the poor little one abroad with
                  me,—children always love me. I can make her so happy; and O, it will be such a
                  motive to make amends to her for all this wrong. Let me see your sister, aunty,
                  and tell her about it."</p>
               <p>"Dear child," said Miss Mehitable, "you can do nothing with her. All last night I
                  thought she was dying. Since then she seems to have recovered her strength; but
                  she neither speaks nor moves. She lies with her eyes open, but notices nothing you
                  say to her."</p>
               <p>"Poor darling!" said Tina. "But, Aunty, let me go to her. I am so sure that God
                  will help me,—that God sends me to her. I <emph>must</emph> see her!"</p>
               <p>Tina's strong impulses seemed to carry us all with her. Miss Mehitable arose, and,
                  taking her by the hand, opened the door of a chamber on the opposite side of the
                  hall. I looked in, and saw that it was darkened. Tina went boldly in, and closed
                  the door. We all sat silent together. We heard her voice, at times soft and
                  pleading; then it seemed to grow more urgent and impetuous as she spoke
                  continuously and in tones of piercing earnestness.</p>
               <p>After a while, there were pauses of silence, and then a voice in reply.</p>
               <p>"There," said Miss Mehitable, "Emily has begun to answer her, thank God! Anything
                  is better than this oppressive silence. It is frightful!"</p>
               <p>And now the sound of an earnest conversation was heard, waxing on both sides more
                  and more ardent and passionate. Tina's voice sometimes could be distinguished in
                  tones of the most pleading entreaty; sometimes it seemed almost like sobbing.
                  After a while, there came a great silence, broken by now and then an indistinct
                  word; and then Tina came out, softly closing the door. Her cheeks were flushed,
                  her hair partially dishevelled, but she smiled brightly,—one of her old triumphant
                  smiles when she had carried a point.</p>
               <p>"I've conquered at last! I've won!" she said, almost breathless. "O, I prayed so
                  that I might, and I did. She gives all up to me; she loves me. We love each other
                  dearly. And now I'm going to take the little one with me, and by and by I will
                  bring her back to her, and I will make her so happy. You<pb n="590-591"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000300"/> must give me the darling at once, and I will take
                  her away with us; for we are going to sail next week. We sail sooner than I
                  thought," she said; "but this makes it best to go at once."</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable rose and went out, but soon reappeared, leading in a lovely little
                  girl with great round, violet blue eyes, and curls of golden hair. The likeness of
                  Ellery Davenport was plainly impressed on her infant features.</p>
               <p>Tina ran towards her, and stretched out her arms. "Darling," she said, "come to
                  me."</p>
               <p>The little one, after a moment's survey, followed that law of attraction which
                  always drew children to Tina. She came up confidingly, and nestled her head on her
                  shoulder.</p>
               <p>Tina gave her her watch to play with, and the child shook it about, well
                  pleased.</p>
               <p>"Emily want to go ride?" said Tina, carrying her to the window and showing her the
                  horses.</p>
               <p>The child laughed, and stretched out her hand.</p>
               <p>"Bring me her things, Aunty," she said. "Let there not be a moment for change of
                  mind. I take her with me this moment."</p>
               <p>A few moments after, Tina went lightly tripping down the stairs, and Harry and I
                  with her, carrying the child and its little basket of clothing.</p>
               <p>"There, put them in," she said. "And now, boys," she said, turning and offering
                  both her hands, "good by. I love you both dearly, and always shall."</p>
               <p>She kissed us both, and was gone from our eyes before I awoke from the dream into
                  which she had thrown me.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"Well," said Miss Mehitable, when the sound of wheels died away, "could I have
                  believed that anything could have made my heart so much lighter as this
                  visit?"</p>
               <p>"She was inspired," said Mr. Rossiter.</p>
               <p>"Tina's great characteristic," said I. "What makes her differ from others is this
                  capacity of inspiration. She seems sometimes to rise, in a moment, to a level
                  above her ordinary self, and to carry all up with her!"</p>
               <p>"And to think that such a woman has thrown herself away on such a man!" said
                  Harry.</p>
               <p>"I foresee a dangerous future for her," said Mr. Rossiter. "With her brilliancy,
                  her power of attraction, with the temptations of a new and fascinating social life
                  before her, and with only that worthless fellow for a guide, I am afraid she will
                  not continue <emph>our</emph> Tina."</p>
               <p>"Suppose we trust in <emph>Him</emph> who has guided her hitherto," said
                  Harry.</p>
               <p>"People usually consider that sort of trust a desperate resort," said Mr.
                  Rossiter. "May the Lord help her,' means, 'It 's all up with her.'"</p>
               <p>"We see," said I, "that the greatest possible mortification and sorrow that could
                  meet a young wife has only raised her into a higher plane. So let us hope for her
                  future."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">WHAT CAME OF IT.</head>
               <p>THE next week Mr. and Mrs. Ellery Davenport sailed for England.</p>
               <p>I am warned by the increased quantity of manuscript which lies before me that, if
                  I go on recounting scenes and incidents with equal minuteness, my story will
                  transcend the limits of modern patience. Richardson might be allowed to trail off
                  into seven volumes, and to trace all the histories of all his characters, even
                  unto the third and fourth generations; but Richardson did not live in the days of
                  railroad and steam, and mankind then had more leisure than now.</p>
               <p>I am warned, too, that the departure of the principal character from the scene is
                  a signal for general weariness through the audience,—for looking up of gloves, and
                  putting on of shawls, and getting ready to call one's carriage.</p>
               <p>In fact, when Harry and I had been down to see Tina off, and had stood on the
                  shore, watching and waving our handkerchiefs, until the ship became a speck in the
                  blue airy distance, I turned back to the world with very much the feeling that
                  there was nothing left in it. What I had always dreamed of, hoped for, planned
                  for, and made the object of all my endeavors, so far as this world was concerned,
                  was gone,—gone, so far as I could see, hopelessly and irredeemably; and there came
                  over me that utter languor and want of interest in every mortal thing, which is
                  one of the worst diseases of the mind.</p>
               <p>But I knew that it would never do to give way to this lethargy. I needed an
                  alterative; and so I set myself, with all my might and soul, to learning a new
                  language. There was an old German emigrant in Cambridge, with whom I became a
                  pupil, and I plunged into German as into a new existence. I recommend everybody
                  who wishes to try the waters of Lethe to study a new language guage, and learn to
                  think in new forms; it is like going out of one sphere of existence into
                  another.</p>
               <p>Some may wonder that I do not recommend devotion for this grand alterative; but it
                  is a fact, that, when one has to combat with the terrible lassitude produced by
                  the sudden withdrawal of an absorbing object of affection, devotional exercises
                  sometimes hinder more than they help. There is much in devotional religion of the
                  same strain of softness and fervor which is akin to earthly attachments, and the
                  one is almost sure to recall the other. What the soul wants is to be distracted
                  for a while,—to be taken out of its old grooves of thought, and run upon entirely
                  new ones. Religion must be sought in these moods, in its active and preceptive
                  form,—what we may call its business character,—rather than in its sentimental and
                  devotional one.</p>
               <p>It had been concluded among us all that it would be expedient for Miss Mehitable
                  to remove from Oldtown and take a residence in Boston.</p>
               <p>It was desirable, for restoring the health of Emily, that she should have more
                  change and variety, and less minute personal attention fixed upon her, than could
                  be the case in the little village of Oldtown. Harry and I did a great deal of
                  house-hunting for them, and at last succeeded in securing a neat little cottage on
                  an eminence overlooking the harbor in the outskirts of Boston.</p>
               <p>Preparing this house for them, and helping to establish them in it, furnished
                  employment for a good many of our leisure hours. In fact, we found that this home
                  so near would be quite an accession to our pleasures. Miss Mehitable had always
                  been one of that most pleasant and desirable kind of acquaintances that a young
                  man can have; to wit, a cultivated, intelligent, literary female friend, competent
                  to advise and guide one in one's scholarly career. We became greatly interested in
                  the society of her sister. The strength and dignity of character shown by this
                  unfortunate lady in recovering her position commanded our respect. She was never
                  aware, and was never made aware by anything in our manner, that we were acquainted
                  with her past history.</p>
               <p>The advice of Tina on this subject had been faithfully followed. No one in our
                  circle, or in Boston, except my grandmother, had<pb n="594-595"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000302"/> any knowledge of how the case really stood. In
                  fact, Miss Mehitable had always said that her sister had gone abroad to study in
                  France, and her reappearance again was only noticed among the few that inquired
                  into it at all, as her return. Harry and I used to study French with her, both on
                  our own account, and as a means of giving her some kind of employment. On the
                  whole, the fireside circle at the little cottage became a cheerful and pleasant
                  retreat. Miss Mehitable had gained what she had for years been sighing for,—the
                  opportunity to devote herself wholly to this sister. She was a person with an
                  enthusiastic power of affection, and the friendship that arose between the two was
                  very beautiful.</p>
               <p>The experiences of the French Revolution, many of whose terrors she had witnessed,
                  had had a powerful influence on the mind of Emily, in making her feel how mistaken
                  had been those views of human progress which come from the mere unassisted reason,
                  when it rejects the guidance of revealed religion. She was in a mood to return to
                  the faith of her fathers, receiving it again under milder and more liberal forms.
                  I think the friendship of Harry was of great use to her in enabling her to attain
                  to a settled religious faith. They were peculiarly congenial to each other, and
                  his simplicity of religious trust was a constant corrective to the habits of
                  thought formed by the sharp and pitiless logic of her early training.</p>
               <p>A residence in Boston was also favorable to Emily's recovery, in giving to her
                  what no person who has passed through such experiences can afford to be
                  without,—an opportunity to help those poorer and more afflicted. Emily very
                  naturally shrank from society; except the Kitterys, I think there was no family
                  which she visited. I think she always had the feeling that she would not accept
                  the acquaintance of any who would repudiate her were all the circumstances of her
                  life known to them. But with the poor, the sick, and the afflicted, she felt
                  herself at home. In their houses she was a Sister of Mercy, and the success of
                  these sacred ministrations caused her, after a while, to be looked upon with a
                  sort of reverence by all who knew her.</p>
               <p>Tina proved a lively and most indefatigable correspondent. Harry and I heard from
                  her constantly, in minute descriptions of the great gay world of London society,
                  into which she was thrown as wife of the American minister. Her letters were like
                  her old self, full of genius, of wit, and of humor, sparkling with descriptions
                  and anecdotes of character, and sometimes scrawled on the edges with vivid
                  sketches of places, or scenes, or buildings that hit her fancy. She was improving,
                  she told us, taking lessons in drawing and music, and Ellery was making a capital
                  French scholar of her. We could see through all her letters an evident effort to
                  set forth everything relating to him to the best advantage; every good-natured or
                  kindly action, and all the favorable things that were said of him, were put in the
                  foreground, with even an anxious care.</p>
               <p>To Miss Mehitable and Emily came other letters, filled with the sayings and doings
                  of the little Emily, recording minutely all the particulars of her growth, and the
                  incidents of the nursery, and showing that Tina, with all her going out, found
                  time strictly to fulfil her promises in relation to her.</p>
               <p>"I have got the very best kind of a maid for her," she wrote,—"just as good and
                  true as Polly is, only she is formed by the Church Catechism instead of the
                  Cambridge Platform. But she is faithfulness itself, and Emily loves her
                  dearly."</p>
               <p>In this record, also, minute notice was taken of all the presents made to the
                  child by her father,—of all his smiles and caressing words. Without ever saying a
                  word formally in her husband's defence, Tina thus contrived, through all her
                  letters, to produce the most favorable impression of him. He was evidently,
                  according to her showing, proud of her beauty and her talents, and proud of the
                  admiration which she excited in society.</p>
               <p>For a year or two there seemed to be a real vein of happiness running through all
                  these letters of Tina's. I spoke to Harry about it one day.</p>
               <p>"Tina," said I, "has just that fortunate kind of constitution, buoyant as cork,
                  that will rise to the top of the stormiest waters."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Harry. "With some women it would have been an entire impossibility to
                  live happily with a man after such a disclosure,—with Esther, for example. I have
                     never<pb n="596-597" xml:id="VAC7953-00000303"/> told Esther a word about it;
                  but I know that it would give her a horror of the man that she never could recover
                  from."</p>
               <p>"It is not," said I, "that Tina has not strong moral perceptions; but she has this
                  buoyant hopefulness; she believes in herself, and she believes in others. She
                  always feels adequate to manage the most difficult circumstances. I could not help
                  smiling that dreadful day, when she came over and found us all so distressed and
                  discouraged, to see what a perfect confidence she had in herself and in her own
                  power to arrange the affair,—to make Emily consent, to make the child love her; in
                  short, to carry out everything according to her own sweet will, just as she has
                  always done with us all ever since we knew her."</p>
               <p>"I always wondered," said Harry, "that, with all her pride, and all her anger,
                  Emily did consent to let the child go."</p>
               <p>"Why," said I, "she was languid and weak, and she was overborne by simple force of
                  will. Tina was so positive and determined, so perfectly assured, and so warming
                  and melting, that she carried all before her. There was n't even the physical
                  power to resist her."</p>
               <p>"And do you think," said Harry, "that she will hold her power over a man like
                  Ellery Davenport?"</p>
               <p>"Longer, perhaps, than any other kind of woman," said I, "because she has such an
                  infinite variety about her. But, after all, you remember what Miss Debby said
                  about him,—that he never cared long for anything that he was sure of. Restlessness
                  and pursuit are his nature, and therefore the time may come when she will share
                  the fate of other idols."</p>
               <p>"I regard it," said Harry, "as the most dreadful trial to a woman's character that
                  can possibly be, to love, as Tina loves, a man whose moral standard is so far
                  below hers. It is bad enough to be obliged to <emph>talk</emph> down always to
                  those who are below us in intellect and comprehension; but to be obliged to
                     <emph>live down,</emph> all the while, to a man without conscience or moral
                  sense, is worse. I think often, 'What communion hath light with darkness?' and the
                  only hope I can have is that she will fully find him out at last."</p>
               <p>"And that," said I, "is a hope full of pain to her; but it seems to me likely to
                  be realized. A man who has acted as he has done to one woman certainly never will
                  be true to another."</p>
               <p>Harry and I were now thrown more and more exclusively upon each other for
                  society.</p>
               <p>He had received his accession of fortune with as little exterior change as
                  possible. Many in his situation would have rushed immediately over to England, and
                  taken delight in coming openly into possession of the estate. Harry's fastidious
                  reticence, however, hung about him even in this. It annoyed him to be an object of
                  attention and gossip, and he felt no inclination to go alone into what seemed to
                  him a strange country, into the midst of social manners and customs entirely
                  different from those among which he had been brought up. He preferred to remain
                  and pursue his course quietly, as he had begun, in the college with me; and he had
                  taken no steps in relation to the property except to consult a lawyer in
                  Boston.</p>
               <p>Immediately on leaving college, it was his design to be married, and go with
                  Esther to see what could be done in England. But I think his heart was set upon a
                  home in America. The freedom and simplicity of life in this country were
                  peculiarly suited to his character, and he felt a real vocation for the sacred
                  ministry, not in the slightest degree lessened by the good fortune which had
                  rendered him independent of it.</p>
               <p>Two years of our college life passed away pleasantly enough in hard study,
                  interspersed with social relaxations among the few friends nearest to us.
                  Immediately after our graduation came Harry's marriage,—a peaceful little idyllic
                  performance, which took us back to the mountains, and to all the traditions of our
                  old innocent woodland life there.</p>
               <p>After the wholesome fashion of New England clergymen, Mr. Avery had found a new
                  mistress for the parsonage, so that Esther felt the more resigned to leaving him.
                  When I had seen them off, however, I felt really quite alone in the world. The
                  silent, receptive, sympathetic friend and brother of my youth was gone. But
                  immediately came the effort to establish myself in Boston. And, through the
                  friendly offices of the Kitterys, I was placed in connection with some very
                  influential lawyers, who gave me that<pb n="598-599" xml:id="VAC7953-00000304"/>
                  helping hand which takes a young man up the first steps of the profession. Harry
                  had been most generous and liberal in regard to all our family, and insisted upon
                  it that I should share his improved fortunes. There are friends so near to us that
                  we can take from them as from ourselves. And Harry always insisted that he could
                  in no way so repay the kindness and care that had watched over his early years as
                  by this assistance to me.</p>
               <p>I received constant letters from him, and from their drift it became increasingly
                  evident that the claims of duty upon him would lead him to make England his future
                  home. In one of these he said: "I have always, as you know, looked forward to the
                  ministry, and to such a kind of ministry as you have in America, where a man, for
                  the most part, speaks to cultivated, instructed people, living in a healthy state
                  of society, where a competence is the rule, and where there is a practical
                  equality.</p>
               <p>"I had no conception of life, such as I see it to be here, where there are whole
                  races who appear born to poverty and subjection; where there are woes, and
                  dangers, and miseries pressing on whole classes of men, which no one individual
                  can do much to avert or alleviate. But it is to this very state of society that I
                  feel a call to minister. I shall take orders in the Church of England, and
                  endeavor to carry out among the poor and the suffering that simple Gospel which my
                  mother taught me, and which, after all these years of experience, after all these
                  theological discussions to which I have listened, remains in its perfect
                  simplicity in my mind; namely, that every human soul on this earth has One Friend,
                  and that Friend is Jesus Christ its Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>"There is a redeeming power in being beloved, but there are many human beings who
                  have never known what it is to be beloved. And my theology is, once penetrate any
                  human soul with the full belief that <emph>God loves him,</emph> and you save him.
                  Such is to be my life's object and end; and, in this ministry, Esther will go with
                  me hand in hand. Her noble beauty and gracious manners make her the darling of all
                  our people, and she is above measure happy in the power of doing good which is
                  thus put into her hands.</p>
               <p>"As to England, mortal heart cannot conceive more beauty than there is here. It is
                  lovely beyond all poets' dreams. Near to our place are some charming old ruins,
                  and I cannot tell you the delightful hours that Esther and I have spent there.
                  Truly, the lines have fallen to us in pleasant places.</p>
               <p>"I have not yet seen Tina,—she is abroad travelling on the Continent. She writes
                  to us often; but, Horace, her letters begin to have the undertone of pain in
                  them,—her skies are certainly beginning to fade. From some sources upon which I
                  place reliance, I hear Ellery Davenport spoken of as a daring, plausible, but
                  unscrupulous man. He is an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">intrigant</foreign> in
                  politics, and has no domestic life in him; while Tina, however much she loves and
                  appreciates admiration, has a perfect woman's heart. Admiration without love would
                  never satisfy her. I can see, through all the excuses of her letters, that he is
                  going very much one way and she another, that he has his engagements, and she
                  hers, and that they see, really, very little of each other, and that all this
                  makes her sad and unhappy. The fact is, I suppose, he has played with his
                  butterfly until there is no more down on its wings, and he is on the chase after
                  new ones. Such is my reading of poor Tina's lot."</p>
               <p>When I took this letter to Miss Mehitable, she told me that a similar impression
                  had long since been produced on her mind by passages which she had read in hers.
                  Tina often spoke of the little girl as very lovely, and as her greatest earthly
                  comfort. A little one of her own, born in England, had died early, and her
                  affections seemed thus to concentrate more entirely upon the child of her
                  adoption. She described her with enthusiasm, as a child of rare beauty and talent,
                  with capabilities of enthusiastic affection.</p>
               <p>"Let us hope," said I, "that she does take her heart from her mother. Ellery
                  Davenport is just one of those men that women are always wrecking themselves
                  on,—men that have strong capabilities of passion, and very little capability of
                  affection,—men that have no end of sentiment, and scarcely the beginning of real
                  feeling. They make bewitching lovers, but terrible husbands."</p>
               <p>One of the greatest solaces of my life during this period was<pb n="600-601"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000305"/> my friendship with dear old Madam Kittery. Ever
                  since the time when I had first opened to her my boyish heart, she had seemed to
                  regard me with an especial tenderness, and to connect me in some manner with the
                  image of her lost son. The assistance that she gave me in my educational career
                  was viewed by her as a species of adoption. Her eye always brightened, and a
                  lovely smile broke out upon her face, when I came to pass an hour with her. Time
                  had treated her kindly; she still retained the gentle shrewdness, the love of
                  literature, and the warm kindness which had been always charms in her. Some of my
                  happiest hours were passed in reading to her. Chapter after chapter in her
                  well-worn Bible needed no better commentary than the sweet brightness of her dear
                  old face, and her occasional fervent responses. Many Sabbaths, when her increasing
                  infirmities detained her from church, I spent in a tender, holy rest by her side.
                  Then I would read from her prayer-book the morning service, not omitting the
                  prayer that she loved, for the King and the royal family, and then, sitting hand
                  in hand, we talked together of sacred things, and I often wondered to see what
                     <emph>strength</emph> and discrimination there were in the wisdom of love, and
                  how unerring were the decisions that she often made in practical questions. In
                  fact, I felt myself drawn to Madam Kittery by a closer, tenderer tie than even to
                  my own grandmother. I had my secret remorse for this, and tried to quiet myself by
                  saying that it was because, living in Boston, I saw Madam Kittery oftener. But,
                  after all, is it not true that, as we grow older, the relationship of souls will
                  make itself felt? I revered and loved my grandmother, but I never idealized her;
                  but my attachment to Madam Kittery was a species of poetic devotion. There was a
                  slight flavor of romance in it, such as comes with the attachments of our maturer
                  life oftener than with those of our childhood.</p>
               <p>Miss Debby looked on me with eyes of favor. In her own way she really was quite as
                  much my friend as her mother. She fell into the habit of consulting me upon her
                  business affairs, and asking my advice in a general way about the arrangements of
                  life.</p>
               <p>"I don't see," I said to Madam Kittery, one day, "why Miss Deborah always asks my
                  advice; she never takes it."</p>
               <p>"My dear," said she, with the quiet smile with which she often looked on her
                  daughter's proceedings, "Debby wants somebody to <emph>ask</emph> advice of. When
                  she gets it, she is settled at once as to what she <emph>don't</emph> want to do;
                  and that's something."</p>
               <p>Miss Debby once came to me with a face of great perplexity.</p>
               <p>"I don't know what to do, Horace. Our Thomas is a very valuable man, and he has
                  always been in the family. I don't know anything how we should get along without
                  him, but he is getting into bad ways."</p>
               <p>"Ah," said I, "what?"</p>
               <p>"Well, you see it all comes of this modern talk about the rights of the people.
                  I've instructed Thomas as faithfully as ever a woman could; but—do you believe
                  me?—he goes to the primary meetings. I have positive, reliable information that he
                  does."</p>
               <p>"My dear Miss Kittery, I suppose it 's his right as a citizen."</p>
               <p>"O, fiddlestick and humbug!" said Miss Debby; "and it may be my right to turn him
                  out of my service."</p>
               <p>"And would not that, after all, be more harm to you than to him?" suggested I.</p>
               <p>Miss Debby swept up the hearth briskly, tapped on her snuffbox, and finally said
                  she had forgotten her handkerchief, and left the room.</p>
               <p>Old Madam Kittery laughed a quiet laugh. "Poor Debby," she said, "she 'll have to
                  come to it; the world will go on."</p>
               <p>Thomas kept his situation for some years longer, till, having bought a snug place,
                  and made some favorable investments, he at last announced to Miss Debby that,
                  having been appointed constable, with a commission from the governor, his official
                  duties would not allow of his continuance in her service.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE LAST CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>IT was eight years after Tina left us on the wharf in Boston when I met her again.
                  Ellery Davenport had returned to this country, and taken a house in Boston. I was
                  then a lawyer established there in successful business.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport met me with open-handed cordiality, and Tina with warm sisterly
                  affection; and their house became one of my most frequent visiting-places. Knowing
                  Tina by a species of divination, as I always had, it was easy for me to see
                  through all those sacred little hypocrisies by which good women instinctively
                  plead and intercede for husbands whom they themselves have found out. Michelet
                  says, somewhere, that "in marriage the maternal feeling becomes always the
                  strongest in woman, and in time it is the motherly feeling with which she regards
                  her husband." She cares for him, watches over him, with the indefatigable
                  tenderness which a mother gives to a son.</p>
               <p>It was easy to see that Tina's affection for her husband was no longer a blind,
                  triumphant adoration for an idealized hero, nor the confiding dependence of a
                  happy wife, but the careworn anxiety of one who constantly seeks to guide and to
                  restrain. And I was not long in seeing the cause of this anxiety.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport was smitten with that direst curse, which, like the madness
                  inflicted on the heroes of some of the Greek tragedies, might seem to be the
                  vengeance of some incensed divinity. He was going down that dark and slippery
                  road, up which so few return. We were all fully aware that at many times our Tina
                  had all the ghastly horrors of dealing with a madman. Even when he was himself
                  again, and sought, by vows, promises, and illusive good resolutions, to efface the
                  memory of the past, and give security for the future, there was no rest for Tina.
                  In her dear eyes I could read always that sense of overhanging dread, that
                  helpless watchfulness, which one may see in the eyes of so many poor women in our
                  modern life, whose days are haunted by a fear they dare not express, and who must
                  smile, and look gay, and seem confiding, when their very souls are failing them
                  for fear. Still these seasons of madness did not seem for a while to impair the
                  vigor of Ellery Davenport's mind, nor the feverish intensity of his ambition. He
                  was absorbed in political life, in a wild, daring, unprincipled way, and made
                  frequent occasions to leave Tina alone in Boston, while he travelled around the
                  country, pursuing his intrigues. In one of these absences, it was his fate at last
                  to fall in a political duel.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Ten years after the gay and brilliant scene in Christ Church, some of those who
                  were present as wedding guests were again convened to tender the last offices to
                  the brilliant and popular Ellery Davenport. Among the mourners at the grave, two
                  women who had loved him truly stood arm in arm.</p>
               <p>After his death, it seemed, by the general consent of all, the kindest thing that
                  could be done for him, to suffer the veil of silence to fall over his memory.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Two years after that, one calm, lovely October morning, a quiet circle of friends
                  stood around the altar of the old church, when Tina and I were married. Our
                  wedding journey was a visit to Harry and Esther in England. Since then, the years
                  have come and gone softly.</p>
               <p>Ellery Davenport now seems to us as a distant dream of another life, recalled
                  chiefly by the beauty of his daughter, whose growing loveliness is the principal
                  ornament of our home.</p>
               <p>Miss Mehitable and Emily form one circle with us. Nor does the youthful Emily know
                  why she is so very dear to the saintly woman whose prayers and teachings are such
                  a benediction in our family.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Not long since we spent a summer vacation at Oldtown, to explore once more the old
                  scenes, and to show to young Master Harry and Miss Tina the places that their
                  parents had told them<pb n="604-605" xml:id="VAC7953-00000307"/> of. Many changes
                  have taken place in the old homestead. The serene old head of my grandfather has
                  been laid beneath the green sod of the burying-ground; and my mother, shortly
                  after, was laid by him.</p>
               <p>Old Parson Lothrop continued for some years, with his antique dress and his
                  antique manners, respected in Oldtown as the shadowy minister of the past; while
                  his colleague, Mr. Mordecai Rossiter, edified his congregation with the sharpest
                  and most stringent new school Calvinism. To the last, Dr. Lothrop remained
                  faithful to his Arminian views, and regarded the spread of the contrary doctrines,
                  as a decaying old minister is apt to, as a personal reflection upon himself. In
                  his last illness, which was very distressing, he was visited by a zealous
                  Calvinistic brother from a neighboring town, who, on the strength of being a
                  family connection, thought it his duty to go over and make one last effort to
                  revive the orthodoxy of his venerable friend. Dr. Lothrop received him politely,
                  and with his usual gentlemanly decorum remained for a long time in silence
                  listening to his somewhat protracted arguments and statements. As he gave no
                  reply, his friend at last said to him, "Dr. Lothrop, perhaps you are weak, and
                  this conversation disturbs you?"</p>
               <p>"I should be weak indeed, if I allowed such things as you have been saying to
                  disturb me," replied the stanch old doctor.</p>
               <p>"He died like a philosopher, my dear," said Lady Lothrop to me, "just as he always
                  lived."</p>
               <p>My grandmother, during the last part of her life, was totally blind. One would
                  have thought that a person of her extreme activity would have been restless and
                  wretched under this deprivation; but in her case blindness appeared to be indeed
                  what Milton expressed it as being, "an overshadowing of the wings of the
                  Almighty." Every earthly care was hushed, and her mind turned inward, in constant
                  meditation upon those great religious truths which had fed her life for so many
                  years.</p>
               <p>Aunt Lois we found really quite lovely. There is a class of women who are like
                  winter apples,—all their youth they are crabbed and hard, but at the further end
                  of life they are full of softness and refreshment. The wrinkles had really almost
                  smoothed themselves out in Aunt Lois's face, and our children found in her the
                  most indulgent and painstaking of aunties, ready to run, and wait, and tend, and
                  fetch, and carry, and willing to put everything in the house at their disposal. In
                  fact, the young gentleman and lady found the old homestead such very free and easy
                  ground that they announced to us that they preferred altogether staying there to
                  being in Boston, especially as they had the barn to romp in.</p>
               <p>One Saturday afternoon, Tina and I drove over to Needmore with a view to having
                  one more gossip with Sam Lawson. Hepsy, it appears, had departed this life, and
                  Sam had gone over to live with a son of his in Needmore. We found him roosting
                  placidly in the porch on the sunny side of the house.</p>
               <p>"Why, lordy massy, bless your soul an' body, ef that ain't Horace Holyoke!" he
                  said, when he recognized who I was.</p>
               <p>"An' this 'ere's your wife, is it? Wal, wal, how this 'ere world does turn round!
                  Wal, now, who would ha' thought it? Here you be, and Tiny with you. Wal, wal!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said I, "here we are."</p>
               <p>"Wal, now, jest sit down," said Sam, motioning us to a seat in the porch. "I was
                  jest kind o' 'flectin' out here in the sun; ben a readin' in the Missionary
                  Herald; they 've ben a sendin' missionaries to Otawhity, an' they say that there
                  ain't no winter there, an' the bread jest grows on the trees, so 't they don't hev
                  to make none, an' there ain't no wood-piles nor splittin' wood, nor nothin' o'
                  that sort goin' on, an' folks don't need no clothes to speak on. Now, I 's jest
                  thinkin' that 'ere 's jest the country to suit me. I wonder, now, ef they could
                  n't find suthin' for me to do out there. I could shoe the hosses, ef they hed any,
                  and I could teach the natives their catechize, and kind o' help round gin'ally.
                  These 'ere winters gits so cold here I 'm e'en a'most crooked up with the
                  rheumatiz—"</p>
               <p>"Why, Sam," said Tina, "where is Hepsy?"</p>
               <p>"Law, now, hain't ye heerd? Why, Hepsy, she 's been dead, wal, let me see, 't was
                  three year the fourteenth o' last May when Hepsy died, but she was clear were out
                  afore she died. Wal, jest half on her was clear paralyzed, poor crittur; she could
                  n't speak<pb n="606-607" xml:id="VAC7953-00000308"/> a word; that 'ere was a gret
                  trial to her. I don't think she was resigned under it. Hepsy hed an awful sight o'
                  grit. I used to talk to Hepsy, an' talk, an' try to set things afore her in the
                  best way I could, so 's to git 'er into a better state o' mind. D' you b'lieve,
                  one day when I 'd ben a talkin' to her, she kind o' made a motion to me with her
                  eye, an' when I went up to 'er, what d' you think? why, she jest tuk and BIT me!
                  she did so!"</p>
               <p>"Sam," said Tina, "I sympathize with Hepsy. I believe if I had to be talked to an
                  hour, and could n't answer, I should bite."</p>
               <p>"Jes' so, jes' so," said Sam. "I 'spex 't is so. You see, women must talk, there
                  's where 't is. Wal, now, don't ye remember that Miss Bell,—Miss Miry Bell? She
                  was of a good family in Boston. They used to board her out to Oldtown, 'cause she
                  was 's crazy 's a loon. They jest let 'er go 'bout, 'cause she did n't hurt
                  nobody, but massy, her tongue used ter run 's ef 't was hung in the middle and run
                  both ends. Ye really could n't hear yourself think when she was round. Wal, she
                  was a visitin' Parson Lothrop, an' ses he, 'Miss Bell, do pray see ef you can't be
                  still a minute.' 'Lord bless ye, Dr. Lothrop, I can't stop talking!' ses she.
                  'Wal,' ses he, 'you jest take a mouthful o' water an' hold in your mouth, an' then
                  mebbe ye ken stop.' Wal, she took the water, an' she sot still a minute or two,
                  an' it kind o' worked on 'er so 't she jumped up an' twitched off Dr. Lothrop's
                  wig an' spun it right acrost the room inter the fireplace. 'Bless me! Miss Bell,'
                  ses he, 'spit out yer water an' talk, ef ye must!' I 've offun thought on 't,"
                  said Sam. "I s'pose Hepsy 's felt a good 'eal so. Wal, poor soul, she 's gone to
                  'er rest. We 're all on us goin', one arter another. Yer grandther's gone, an' yer
                  mother, an' Parson Lothrop, he 's gone, an' Lady Lothrop, she 's kind o' solitary.
                  I went over to see 'er last week, an' ses she to me, 'Sam, I dunno nothin' what I
                  shell do with my hosses. I feed 'em well, an' they ain't worked hardly any, an'
                  yet they act so 't I 'm 'most afeard to drive out with 'em.' I 'm thinkin' 't
                  would be a good thing ef she 'd give up that 'ere place o' hern, an' go an' live
                  in Boston with her sister."</p>
               <p>"Well, Sam," said Tina, "what has become of Old Crab Smith? Is he alive yet?"</p>
               <p>"Law, yis, he 's creepin' round here yit; but the old woman, she 's dead," said
                  Sam. "I tell you she 's a hevin' her turn o' hectorin' <emph>him</emph> now,
                  'cause she keeps appearin' to him, an' scares the old critter 'most to death."</p>
               <p>"Appears to him?" said I. "Why, what do you mean, Sam?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, jest as true's you live an' breathe, she does 'pear to him," said Sam. "Why,
                  't was only last week my son Luke an' I, we was a settin' by the fire here, an' I
                  was a holdin' a skein o' yarn for Malviny to wind (Malviny, she 's Luke's wife),
                  when who should come in but Old Crab, head first, lookin' so scart an' white about
                  the gills thet Luke, ses he, 'Why, Mistur Smith! what ails ye?' ses he. Wal, the
                  critter was so scared 't he could n't speak, he jest set down in the chair, an' he
                  shuk so 't he shuk the chair, an' his teeth, they chattered, an' 't was a long
                  time 'fore they could git it out on him. But come to, he told us, 't was a bright
                  moonlight night, an' he was comin' 'long down by the Stone pastur, when all of a
                  suddin he looks up an' there was his wife walkin right 'long-side on him,—he ses
                  he never see nothin' plainer in his life than he see the old woman, jest in her
                  short gown an' petticut 't she allers wore, with her gold beads round her neck,
                  an' a cap on with a black ribbon round it, an' there she kep' a walkin' right
                  'long-side of 'im, her elbow a touchin' hisn, all 'long the road, an' when he
                  walked faster, she walked faster, an' when he walked slower, she walked slower,
                  an' her eyes was sot, an' fixed on him, but she did n't speak no word, an' he did
                  n't darse to speak to her. Finally, he ses he gin a dreadful yell an' run with all
                  his might, an' our house was the very fust place he tumbled inter. Lordy massy,
                  wal, I could n't help thinkin' 't sarved him right. I told Sol 'bout it, last
                  town-meetin' day, an' Sol, I thought he 'd ha' split his sides. Sol said he did
                  n't know 's the old woman had so much sperit. 'Lordy massy,' ses he, 'ef she don't
                  do nothin' more 'n take a walk 'long-side on him now an' then, why, I say, let 'er
                  rip,—sarves him right.'"</p>
               <p>"Well," said Tina, "I 'm glad to hear about Old Sol; how is he?"</p>
               <p>"O, Sol? Wal, he 's doin' fustrate. He married Deacon<pb n="608-609"
                     xml:id="VAC7953-00000309"/> 'Bijah Smith's darter, an' he 's got a good farm of
                  his own, an' boys bigger 'n you be, considerable."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Tina, "how is Miss Asphyxia?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, Sol told me 't she 'd got a cancer or suthin' or other the matter with 'er;
                  but the old gal, she jest sets her teeth hard, an' goes on a workin'. She won't
                  have no doctor, nor nothin' done for 'er, an' I expect bimeby she 'll die, a
                  standin' up in the harness."</p>
               <p>"Poor old creature! I wonder, Horace, if it would do any good for me to go and see
                  her. Has she a soul, I wonder, or is she nothing but a 'working machine'?"</p>
               <p>"Wal, I dunno," said Sam. "This 'ere world is cur'us. When we git to thinkin'
                  about it, we think ef we 'd ha' had the makin' on 't, things would ha' ben made
                  someways diffurnt from what they be. But then things <emph>is</emph> just as they
                  is, an' we can't help it. Sometimes I think" said Sam, embracing his knee
                  profoundly, "an' then agin I dunno.——There 's all sorts o' folks hes to be in this
                  'ere world, an' I s'pose the Lord knows what he wants 'em fur; but I 'm sure I
                  don't. I kind o' hope the Lord 'll fetch everybody out 'bout right some o' these
                  'ere times. He ain't got nothin' else to do, an' it 's his lookout, an' not ourn,
                  what comes of 'em all.——But I <emph>should</emph> like to go to Otawhity, an' ef
                  you see any o' these missionary folks, Horace, I wish you 'd speak to 'em about
                  it."</p>
