WHEN a man, whether male or female, publishes a book, it is generally a willful, and frequently a mali- cious act. For instance, when Bancroft perpetrated his numerous History of the United States, every ad- ditional volume after the fourth orfifth was a malicious conspiracy against the rising generation, for the reason that life is short, and no man, who desires to know something about the history of the Great Republic, can afford to spend more than a quarter of a century in acquiring the information. If he relies upon Ban- croft, therefore, he must either waltz into his grave with the agonizing consciousness that he has. never read that stupendous monument to the memory of the Pilgrim Fathers, or take out a long-term life insurance policy, in order to secure the necessary time to wade through it.    <pb n="viii-ix" xml:id="VAC6867-00000005"/> Viii        PREFACE. The malice prepense of authors is manifested in a variety of ways, and in order to remove as much of the odium as possible, it has become an almost uni- versal custom among those gentlemen, to send their progeny forth with a sugared dedication, and a sort of letter of credit, vulgarly yclept a preface, in which they frankly acknowledge their fraud, and throw them- selves upon the mercy of the reader. To such an ex- tent does this custom prevail, that a book, without a dedication or a preface, would be a genuine piece of impudence, born of conceit, and a horrible indifference to the feelings of the public. Thomas DeQuincey seems to have concurred with me in this opinion, and, with a modesty which did him honor, refused to pub- lish his PROLEGOMENA TO ALL FUTURE SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY, because circumstances rendered it impossible for him to prepare a suitable preface and dedication. He tells us that, after carefully preparing the book, arrangements were made at a provincial press for printing it. The work was even twice adver- tised, and he was in a manner pledged to the fulfill- ment of his intentions. But he had a preface to pre- pare, and a dedication, which he wished to make a splendid one, and, as circumstances prevented him from doing this, he forfeited his engagements, and the excited world looked in vain for his PROLEGOMENA. The most uncharitable must give Thomas credit for an extraordinarily level head, and a wonderful degree of   PREFACE.         ix consideration for the feelings of the public. The dull- est intellect will see at a glance that it would have been a horrible piece of recklessness to have launched such a craft without providing it with all the most ap- proved aids to navigation which the ingenuity of authors has devised to guard against wrecks upon the ocean of literature. Breathes there a man with soul so dead, Who ever to himself hath said" that he could have swallowed such a festive work as the PROLEGOMENA TO ALL FUTURE SYSTEMS OF PO- "TICAL ECONOMY without a preface of the most gorgeous character, and a dedication unequivocally splendid? Thomas himself evidently did n't think such an individual lived, and I honor him for the thought. I am, therefore, not ambitious of having my bant- ling among any such curiosities of literature as the PROLEGOMENA, or any other book without a preface. I prefer to follow the example of that illustrious trio of cis-Atlantic wits, Noah Webster, Joseph Worcester' and Bill Arp. I can safely recommend their prefaces as "gems of purest ray serene," and advise every man, woman and child to read them, especially those cor- ruscations of wit which Noah and Joseph have pre- fixed to their dictionaries. I have never read these two myself, but whoever follows me through this little    <pb n="x-xi" xml:id="VAC6867-00000006"/> X         PREFACE. volume will doubtless become convinced that one of the safest rules he can adopt is to do as I have not done. I have read Bill Arp's. I wish the reader to understand that his preface is an exception to the rule above laid down-and he has covered the ground so completely that I am really at a loss to find something to say to my readers, without stealing some of Bill's thunder. I will, however, moisten my organs of pre- hension With that slightly-viscid fluid which is secreted by the parotid, sub-maxillary and sub-lingual glands- I might simply say spit on my hands, but I do n't like to do it-and spread myself on a preface to the best of my knowledge and belief. If I knew of a real good one in some old book, which I could feel sure none of my readers would ever see, I would unhesitatingly steal it, and pass it off as original. But I do n't know of any such, and if I did, some lit- erary sneak would be sure to catch me in the dirty trick, and then be mean enough to tell it. If the Bible had a preface, I might appropriate it, and come nearer escaping detection than if I were to take it from almost any other book that I know of. But, alas I it has none, and, if it had, I would hesitate a long time before I would take it from right under the nose of that commandment which says: "Thou shalt not steal."   PREFACE.         xi I wish I could think of something original to say, but now that I look at the matter up one side and down the other, a sober second thought convinces me that it would be better not to say it, if I could, for Adam was the only original man that ever lived, and if I were to get off anything entirely original, I might be taken for that respected progenitor of the human race. If such a suspicion should once get abroad, I would be immediately overwhelmed with such a horde of curi- ous women, doctors of divinity and college youths clamoring to know if it was really a snake that tempted Eve, and why I let her take me in so easily on the apple question, and how she and I got clothes after all the fig trees were shut up in Eden, and who it was that Cain married, that I am sure I should commit suicide; or become a raving maniac, in less than twenty- four hours. I couldn't help writing this book-circumstances, over which I had no control, compelled me to do it, and well meaning, if not well-advised friends, pub- lished it without my knowledge and consent. Why do n't I prosecute tltem for damages? Well, if you insist upon it, I will. But, as I was proceeding to remark, I had " a call" to write, or at least I thought so; and when ,a man thinks he has one of those things, what difference does it make, so far as the "callee " is concerned, whether he really has or not? Did you never have, nor think you had, a "call?" If you    <pb n="xii-xiii" xml:id="VAC6867-00000007"/> 1ii         PREFACE. never did, take one aboard the first time you desire to do something of doubtful propriety, and you will find it as comforting as corn-cob friction to aBerkshire pig. There are two classes of the genus homo who are affected in that way. The most numerous are those who look to their "call" for a support. They are generally people whom it requires some powerful in- fluence to move, and when they begin to incubate upon a "call," they look around for some easy occupation, which they readily persuade themselves they were foreordained to adopt. Their "call" grows each day. Its first spasmodic quivers become healthy, irresisti- ble kicks. They feel it would be a sin to hang fire any longer. In other words, they have loafed until they can loaf no longer; their necessities compel them to do something; they grasp in desperation at that occupation, in which they thinlk they can provide for their wants with the least work, and thus they sail off under the overpowering influence of their "call." The other class, though carried away with their "call," with all the enthusiasm of a fast young man behind a 2:40 team, don't practice it for a living. They run the institution something like a side-show to a circus. If it does n't bring in anything, well and good; and, if it does, so much the better. A man who has a " call" generally urges that as an excuse for all his failures. If he does n't succeed, he piously tells you that he can't help it; that duty com-   PREFACE.         Xiii pels him to "shove along, keep moving," and, if he never captures a good result, it is none of his business; he intends to persevere as long as a deluded public will furnish him with victuals aid clothes. If he can persuade the world that he is acting under the divine pressure of a "call," he is generally respected, and, although his zeal may make him a bore, the party of the second part, or the " boree," will grin and bear it with a grace which he would not display under any other circumstances. For this reason, I have con- cluded to palm this little volume off as the effect of a high-pressure "call," and I hope it will be received as such. How, when, where, and under what circumstances did I become persuaded that I was the victim of a call? Well I suppose I shall be compelled to tell all about it, though my confession will necessarily involve some one else in the crime. I was the guest of my friend, J. B. Killebrew, at the time that those enterprising sons of Tennessee, Messrs. Brown, Cox, McGavock, Harding and others formed the Rural Sun, and breathed into it the breath of life by placing my friend in charge as editor-in- chief. He was anxious to have a contributor from that rich alluvial district of Louisiana, where the sugar cane waves like a sea of green in the soft summer 2    <pb n="xiv-xv" xml:id="VAC6867-00000008"/> xiv         PREFACE. breeze, and, in autumn, every stalk puts forth, as a bloom, a keg of pure sugar; and where the cotton- stalks grow so tall that the pickers are compelled to use ladders to gather the crop-the reader. has my permission to disbelieve this statement if he is so inclined, but I would rather he would swal- low it whole, for I have always been accused of resembling the Father of our Country in many respects, but chiefly in veracity. He-I mean Kil- lebrew, not the Father of our Country-was flat- 'tering enough to insist that I was the very indi- vidual he wanted for his purpose, and begged me to consider myself among his corps of contributors. I stood aghast at the proposition. How could I, whose whole life had been passed in plowing among thei records of a court of law, and cultivating writs of at- tachment, arrest and injunction, teach the noble army of farmers anything whatever about surface plowing and subsoiling the earth, or. the cultivation of those divine plants which give the world its belly-cheer. I therefore demurred most energetically, but when was Killebrew ever known to fail in anything he ever at- tempted? Like that other distinguished..Tennesseean, Davy Crockett, who never failed to bag his coon or bear, he is a sure shot at any enterprise he sets his heart upon. The consequence was that he bagged me as a correspondent. At the time, I thought that he   PREFACE.         XV had secured nothing but a promise, for I fully intended to forget all about it as soon as I should get out of the reach of his persuasive tongue. But I must confess that I did n't understand the persevering nature of the man. I had scarcely reached home before the Rural Sun followed me with its genial beams, and with it came such an urgent reminder of my promise that I felt I was in duty bound to contribute something, which, if it conveyed no information to the world, would at least disenchant the editor of the Sun of his idea as to my value as a writer. One of the most reliable historians of the age, in his biography of the distinguished Oliver Twist, relates a very interesting circumstance which occurred while that gentleman was pursuing his collegiate course in the Work-house. At the very first supper which was served to him in that noble institution, "he rose from the table, and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand, said, somewhat alarmed at his own temerity: "Please, sir, I want some more." "What?" said the master, at length, in a faint voice. "Please, sir," replied Oliver, "I want some more." The master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle, pinioned him in his arms, and shrieked aloud for the beadle.          '     <pb n="xvi-17" xml:id="VAC6867-00000009"/> Xvi        PREFACE. To my astonishment, the editor of the Sun published my article, and then, like the illustrious Oliver, asked for more. Instead of a ladle, I aimed a blow at his paper with some of my experiences, and thus yielded to the overpowering influence of my "call"-my "call" from Killebrew.   BOAZ: HS    TRIBULATIONS. CHAPTER   I. Why I formed an Entangling Alliance with a Farm, and what my Mother-in-law had to say about it. I BELIEVE it is Carlyle who says, "Were it the piti- fullest infinitessimal fraction of a product, produce it;" provided, say I, the fraction be of such a character that erring humanity may reap something of good from it. Though it be "the pitifullest infinitessimal," it may be the very thing that some poor wayfarer along life's rugged road may require to help him in his utmost need, and, therefore, it were a pity had it not been produced. Believing, then, that it is the duty of every individual to cast his mite into the great hat of knowledge which the world is passing around, I have concluded to place before the enlightened agri- culturists of the country some of my experiences as a farmer. I have not the vanity to suppose that these experiences will be the means either of improving or instructing those who are learned in the art, but they    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6867-00000010"/> 18          BOAZ: may serve as a sort of light-house to such neophytes as are just launching their little barques on the stormy sea of agriculture, and who indulge in the delusive be- lief that anybody can " run a farm; " that the farmer's ways "are ways of pleasantness, and all his paths are peace," and that his daily labors are linked together with "A chain of woven flowers dipped in sweetness." An honest confession is said to be good for the soul, and, as I desire to make a clean breast of it, I may as well begin by telling how and why I formed an en- tangling alliance with a farm. Previous to the late unpleasantness between the two sections of our unhappy country, I had acquired some property, and was deriving quite a handsome income from a profession, but " when the cruel war was over," most of my property had "gone glimmering through the dreams of things that were," and I was almost as penniless as the most penniless "reb." that marched back home with his finger in his mouth. My first thought, of course, was to resume the practice of my profession, but to do so I had first to get a license from the State authorities, and to obtain this license, I found it was a necessary prerequisite to take the oath of al- legiance to the Federal Government. Though con- quered in battle, I was one of those who was not sub- dued in spirit, and I vowed I would starve or go to Honduras, or enlist in some foreign army, before I would swear allegiance to a Government which I then thought it was and ever would be a part of my religion to hate. I had a wife and children, therefore I could not conscientiously enlist in a foreign army. I had no   HS TRIBULATIONS.       19 money, therefore it was out of the question to go to Honduras, and I had always had, from my earliest recollection, an ineradicable dislike to starvation. So the only alternative was to adopt some vocation which one could follow in this "land 6f the free and home of the brave" without taking the oath of allegiance. What should' that vocation be? was the question which puzzled me; but, after mature deliberation, I con- eluded to be a farmer. The more I thought of it, the more fully I became convinced it was the very thing, and "the wonder was, and still the wonder grew," that I had ever hesitated a moment about it. The only property I owned was a farm, which I had taken in payment of a debt, in those good old times when peo- r   ple paid debts and did n't care a fig for the act of bank- ruptcy. Like a certain milkmaid, the heroine of one of Noah Webster's most thrilling tales, I erected the most magnificent castles in the air, with that farm as the foundation. I could get as many negroes as I wanted to work it, and, instead of paying them wages, I would give them a portion of the crop. Being thus directly interested in the farm, they would possess one of the noblest "incentives to a virtuous ambition," and would, I was sure, work better than they had when in slavery. I would employ none but experienced hands, and I would thus be relieved of the duties of an over- seer, for, knowing what was to be done, and feeling that they were working for themselves as well as for me, they would form a band of Ariels to do my bid- ding, and at the close of each day I could say with Prospero, "Thy charge exactly is performed." I ' .                .    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6867-00000011"/> 20          BOAZ: I would study farming as a science; would get only the most improved implements, and would show the old fogy farmers around me what a " live man," well up to all the advancements of the age, could do in their time-honored art. I imagined they were vastly behind the times, dead and buried under the old notions which Shem, Ham and Japheth practiced and imparted to their descendants in the misty ages of the past, and I fondly looked forward to the revolution which I would create in the farming operations of my neighbors. I pictured to myself a farm teeming with rich products, a band of happy laborers working harmoniously to- gether, and I the lord of all, directing their operations by intelligent, scientific suggestions. In the plenitude of my innocence, I imagined that I would glide through life as smoothly as a vessel under easy steam glides over a waveless sea, and leaving the manual labors of the farm to interested employees, I would wander through the enchanting world of literature, gathering such gems of thought as sparkled along the streams of romance, poetry and science, In the glorious seclusion of my farm life, the wrangling of struggling mankind would never reach me, and the turmoils of the war- ring world would be to me as a dream that had past. In the enthusiasm of my imagination I sometimes al- most felt that I was in the actual enjoyment of the realization of my dreams, and could sing with the poet: "How dreamily the shadows fall Across my chamber floor! How lazily the sunbeams creep Within the open door  They mingle in delicious sport Like loving waves at play,   HS TRIBULATIONS.       21 Or like the idle floating clouds At noon of summer day. Drifting upon a winged boat My soul, far outward, hies, Till round me bursts from harps unseen Music of paradise! And nature's wondrous, witching spell Has to my spirit given, In strange communion, calmly sweet, Almost a glimpse of Heaven." While the inspiration was upon me, I believed that I had a special call to turn aside from the "ways that were dark, and tricks that were vain " of a professional life, to enter into the glorious brotherhood of inde- pendent farmers, and that the late cruel war and the oath of allegiance had been gotten up for the express purpose of bringing about so desirable a result. It was then too late in the season to begin farming operations, so I determined to get ready for 1866. I found employment for the time being, which supported my family, and all of my leisure hours I devoted to the exclusive study of agriculture. Before the end of the year I was, in my opinion, a thorough farmer in theory, and only wanted an opportunity to show Dick- son and Greeley, and the rest of mankind, a thing or two of what I knew about farming. During the forma- tion of these plans, my home life was not as genial as a day in spring. Most of my friends thought I was act- ing unwisely. They agreed that my notions about the oath of allegiance were Quixotic; that I was bred to a profession, and that I was doing myself and my family an injustice to desert it; My mother-in-law sailed into me tri-daily, with protests of a very em- phatic. character.

I suppose you will want her to spin and weave her own clothes, and live on corn bread and pickle-pork. I will have you to know that she did n't bargain for any such ar- rangement. If you had n't been a professional man, and lived in town like a gentleman, she never would have had you; but you have deceived her, sir. She wasn't brought up to undergo such hardships, and if you do n't go back to your office and the practice of your profession, as a decent, respectable gentleman should do, you will rue the day you failed to take my advice to the end of your life." My wife, too, put in a gentle remonstrance. She thought that, in giving up my profession for a farm, I was another Moses, swapping his horse for a gross of green spectacles; that I knew nothing about farming, and, in short, she would not say exactly that I was too inert, but I was not stirring enough in my disposition to look after the multifarious objects which would re- quire my attention. She therefore entreated me to give up my notions of agricultural reform and resume the practice of my profession.

But the "blethering, blustering, drunken blellum," no doubt, thought Kate was a fool, and the warlocks were all a myth. He learned better, however, to his sorrow, as all readers of that "o'er true tale" 'know full well. It is not an uncommon thing for brilliant specimens of the lords of creation to contemn the opin- ions of their wives, and in the end find their self-con- ceit a very Pegasus, which rushes them on to ruin. My experience in farming gives me a wonderful sym- pathy for the weakness of such men, for, in spite of the advice of friends, the remonstrances of my re- spected mother-in-law, and the pleadings of a tender wife, I deliberately marched on to my destiny. 4    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6867-00000013"/> 24          BOAZ CHAPTER II. My Farm and Improved Implements.-Manures consid- ered from an Astronomical and Infantile Point of View. -Philosophical Suggestions. THE first of January, 1866, found me established upon my farm. The whole place bore evidence of long neglect and the ravages of war. The dwelling was scarcely habitable, the outhuildings were going fast to ruin, a post here and there showed where there was once a garden, and a few dead peach trees were all that were left of the orchard. With a zeal and energy that augured well for my future proceedings, I set to work, and soon got my premises into a very fair con- dition. I secured as many laborers as I wanted. The city merchants regarded the cotton fields as a new El Dorado, and I had no difficulty in finding one who was willing to furnish me with supplies. My farm was on a stream which was navigable only in winter, and, in order to take advantage of the con- venient transportation, I had all my farming utensils and supplies for the plantation brought up at once. These I divided among the negroes, giving each one all that he required for the year, so that I would not be   HS TRIBULATIONS.      25 bothered by having them come to me every few days for a little flour and meal, or a little sugar and coffee. I made a thorough examination of my farm and carefully noted every little characteristic which indi- cated difference in the soil. I then made a map of the whole, marking these differences by various colors, and numbered them 1, 2, 3, etc. I employed a chemist to analyze these soils, and wrote each analysis upon its corresponding number on the map. My object in doing this was that I might be enabled the better to adapt my crops to the land to be cultivated, and to- supply any existing deficiencies in the soil by the necessary manures. I prided myself no little upon this idea, *   and had my map neatly framed and hung in my parlor. I pointed it out to all my visitors, and expatiated largely upon the beauty and advantages of the plan. I tried hard to induce my neighbors to follow my ex- ample in this matter, as well as in providing those improved implements, which the science and experi- ence of enlightened agriculturists had led them to adopt. I showed them the gang-plows, sulky-culti- vators, horse-hoes, etc., with which I proposed to cultivate my farm, and tried to persuade them to shake off,whatI was pleased to term, their old fogy notions, and to unite in the grand effort that was making to elevate agriculture to that high position among the arts and sciences to which it was justly entitled. My ideas, however, did n't seem to take very well. The more in- telligent said they would watch my operations with interest, and my success would determine their ap- proval. One bumpkin declared "he did n't want any durnkV    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6867-00000014"/> 26         BOAZ: doctor pirooten round his land, makin' manure maps," and another believed "he wouldn't take any gang- plows and sich gimcracks in his'n." You'll sing another tune, my boys, thought I, by the end of the year, and will live to bless the day I started a farm in your midst. In due time I set about breaking up my land, and the. morning I began, my field was full of the curious "to see how my Yankee tricks would get up and g' lang." It is useless for me to attempt to give a detailed account of the troubles I had with my gang-plows and sulky-cultivators. It is enough to say, that I soon dis- covered it was worse than folly to put such implements in the hands of ignorant negroes, and, that to get rid of the ten thousand annoyances, which they caused me, I must let my darkies work in their old-time way. The force of circumstances, therefore, compelled me to put my wheel-plows away, and get a supply of the old fashioned kind. I stored them away in an old out- house, almost as fresh and new as the day I bought them, and there they have remained ever since, A prey to insulting neglect. For a long time I tried to sell them far below cost, but no purchaser applied. Still believing that they were good inventions, and would work well in the hands of an intelligent man, who would run them him- self, I offered to give them to any of my neighbors who would bind themselves to make a crop with them, and failed to get rid of them even on those terms. I had several applications from enterprising contrabands for   iIS TRIBULATIONS.       27 permission to take the axles and wheels for the pur- pose of making carts, but I declined the proposition, and the "tricks" are still on hand. L Requiescat in pace. This little experiment was rather a costly one, and opened my eyes to the fact that farming, like true love, doesn't always run smooth, but I consoled myself with the thought, that these little ripples were natural to every man's life, and were probably blessings in disguise. After providing my freedmen with the ordinary plows, work moved oh smoothly enough, and I prose- cuted my agricultural studies with renewed zeal. My 4   mind became so thoroughly imbued with the subject, that I viewed every thing in nature from an agricul- tural standpoint. I cared but little for poetry, music or romance; for my tastes had all become thoroughly utilitarian. I became a veritable Thomas Gradgrind- "A man of realities. A man of facts and calcula- tions." A man who believed that the beautiful should be entirely discarded from our studies, and that the useful only should be cultivated. I thought nature was at fault in decking the earth so bountifully with flowers instead of turnips and cabbages. The sky, glittering "like a jeweled tiara on the brow of night," lost all charms for me, as an object of beauty, and, if I turned my mind skyward at all, it was only to spec- ulate on the probable agricultural operations that were carried on in "other worlds than ours." I wondered if the good people of Jupiter and Mars had any idea of gang-plows and sulky-cultivators, and were blessed with good ranges for hogs and cattle. I wondered if    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6867-00000015"/> 28          BOAZ: Venus abounded in barn-yard manures, and if we could only rig some plan to get at the "pale queen of night," would n't the green cheese, out of which she was said to be made, afford an excellent substitute for guano. If I met a group of beautiful girls, it never occurred to me that they might be a bevy of angels, fresh from the balmy airs of paradise, but I would more than likely make a mental calculation of how this one, or that one, would compost with leaves or swamp muck, and what a start they would-give to corn in early spring. I remember going into the parlor one day, and found quite a number of my wife's fashionable friends who had come out from town to spend the day. There were several brand new babies in the company that I had never seen before, and as is the case the world over, their mothers "had baby on the brain." It happened that I entered in the midst of a discussion on the relative beauties of the little innocents, and I was im- mediately called on for my opinion. I had just been reading a long article on the value of animal flesh as a manure, and my mind was full of the subject. It was natural, therefore, that my standard of excellence should be somewhat different from theirs. "They are all," I said, "very good articles of baby. This one's flesh seems to be firmer than the others, and I would suppose is rich in fertilizing properties. If well rotted and thoroughly spaded in he would make an excellent manure for cabbage. This one is much softer, and seems to have more of an aqueous forma- tion. I would immerse him in sulphuric acid until he was thoroughly dissolved; then dilute the mixture with water, and sprinkle over turnips.

"Dog-on you!" said No. 2; "I would like to see you try to dissolve my baby in your nasty acid, and sprinkle him on turnips. Ze muzzer's 'ittle darlin'," and she pressed him frantically to her bosom. The wrath of the third, whose pickaninny I had re- commended to be burned with stone coal, was too deep for utterance. She closed her eyes in horror, and with a convulsive wave of her hand, cried, "Take him out! take him out!" My mother-in-law rose like an enraged tigress, and glared on me from behind her spectacles, as if she would-if she could-annihilate me with her fiery eyes. "Mary," said she, turning to my wife, " it is worse even than I ever supposed. I thought all along that he was simply a fool, whom a little experience would cure, but now I see he is absolutely crazy." "Ah!" said I, fixing my eyes on her fat sides, and moving toward her, " if I only had two or three such as you to mix with lime, and put around my young apple trees, I know I would get the first premium for fruit at the next fair." The old lady broke from the room as if the devil were after her, and my wife rushed forward in tears to know what was the matter.  My- criticisms on the babies were the natural results of the meditations I had fallen into from the article I had been reading,    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6867-00000016"/> 30          BOAZ: but the stunning demonstrations of the mothers roused me effectually from my manure abstractions, and en- abled me to take-in the situation. I thought I would not let the opportunity pass to give my mother-in-law a shot, as she made use of every occasion to sail into me. When she was gone I explained to the ladies that I did n't intend any disrespect to the babies, and that I only meant to annoy my mother-in-law, who was continually assailing me with the folly of my agri- cultural pursuits. I then displayed such a real interest in the babies, and complimented the mothers so skill- fully, that general good humor was soon restored, and all laughed heartily at the view I had taken of the merits of the children. It was a very long time, how- ever, before I could bring a smile to the austere lips of my mother-in-law, and she played so shy of me, that I have always thought she really believed I was in a quasi-crazed condition, and that I was half inclined to put the ideas I had expressed about her into actual execution. I have wandered thus from my narrative, not for the purpose of raising questions in regard to planetary agriculture, nor of bringing into discussion the proba- bility of the moon's being made to supply the place of the guano islands, when their rich deposits shall all have been removed. Non nostrum est tantas componere lites. Neither do I wish it understood that I would recom- mend young farmers to use any stray babies they might pick up for manure. I particularly hope that none of my readers will be led astray in this matter, for I should   "S TRIBULATIONS.       31 regret exceedingly to hear that some enthusiastic ex- perimentalist had adopted the idea as a good one, and, believing it to be the best use babies could be put to, had let his love of science triumph over his philos- torgy, and had either thinned out his own family circle or conferred a like favor upon some of his friends. I mention these vagaries into which I was led merely for the purpose of illustrating how completely I was ab- sorbed in the subject of agriculture, and how the mind, when it is thus occupied with any particular subject, will endeavor to reduce every thing which comes within its grasp to the standard which that subject evolves- how, in confining the attention exclusively to one thing, the mind will play the wildest pranks, and lead the most wary into .an earnest chase of the merest will-o'-the-wisp. Witness how the learned of a past age wasted their lives in attempting to transmute the baser metals into gold; how the phlegmatic beer drinkers of Holland, ran wild with the senseless desire for the possession of a few tulip roots; how the noble Spaniard, Ponce de Leon, when he felt the infirmities of age creeping upon him, went in search of the fabled fountain of youth, and died miserably in the everglades of Florida, far from the scenes of his glorious youth, with the war-whoop of the savage ringing in his car, instead of the soothing accents of love; and last, modesty prevents me from saying, but not least, how an amateur farmer was led into all manner of vagaries which eventually "proclaimed the deep damnation of his taking off." To guard against such errors I would earnestly urge upon young farmers two beautiful pre- cepts, which I entreat them to inscribe upon their door posts, and engrave upon their memories, and which    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6867-00000017"/> 32          BOAZ: will be to them pillars of cloud by day, and pillars of fire by night, to guide them on to the promised land of success. These precepts, which they should cherish as apples of gold in pictures of silver, are: "Keep your head level," and, "Never-say die." -   HS TRIBULATIONS.,      33 CHAPTER   II. A Cornucopia of Woes. THE digressions in the foregoing chapter rather caused "a solution of continuity" in my narrative, which I will now resume, and endeavor to carry through without further interruption. My plowing went on swimmingly, and in due course of time my land was ready for planting. The analyses of my soils which the chemist had made, easily enabled -me to determine what manures I required for my fields, but the trouble was to get the manures. A part of my theory was that every farmer ought to manufacture his own fertilizers, and I fully calculated that the forests, the high-ways and the by-ways would contribute an ample supply for all my purposes. The difficulty was, however, to collect the tribute from these sources. The planters in my section of country had never been accustomed to manure their lands, and the negroes, therefore, had never been taught to gather it, and to feel the necessity of providing a good supply for every crop. I soon became convinced that I would not be able to obtain my manure from the sources I expected, and I therefore contracted with a neighbor for a large heap of cotton seed, which had been accumulating at his gin for some years. Here    <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6867-00000018"/> 34          BOAZ: another disappointment was in store for me. As I had contracted to give my laborers a share of the crop, I found it next to impossible to control their operations as I desired. They seemed to think that their obliga- tions were limited to plowing, planting, cultivating and gathering. I could not impress upon their minds the conviction that one acre well manured could be made to produce as much as three or four under ordi- nary circumstances, and that the time consumed in putting in the manure was more than saved in having less ground to cultivate. Without refusing positively to fertilize the land, they went about it in such .a dila- tory manner that I was finally compelled to give it up, and to see the seed go into the ground without having it enriched as I desired. This satisfied me that the system of cultivating a farm on shares was not as beautiful and harmonious as it at first appeared to be, and any remaining doubts I may have had were fully removed before the end of the year. I had also another cause of disquietude which gave me no little trouble. My fence was sadly in need of repairs. I tried very hard to get my freedmen to split rails and give it a thorough overhauling before the crop was planted, but they put me off on the plea that it was all important to get an early start, and that they would have ample time to repair the fence before there could be any danger to the crop. Their fair promises quieted my apprehensions, and everything went on smoothly enough for the time. The spring weather was very unpropitious, but my crop compared favorably with those around me, and I was, therefore, satisfied. My corn and cotton grew very well, until a long rainy season set in, which dragged    IIS TRIBULATIONS.       35 on from day to day, and washed away many of the beautiful colors in which I had painted a farmer's life. Ah! those rainy seasons, what a trial they are to the good nature of those whose occupation is in the open air. I sat day in and day out, "like patience on the monument smiling at grief," and watching the grass grow, hoping against hope that every shower would be the last. I made another effort to induce my laborers to take advantage of the fair days which occasionally occurred through the "wet spell," to get out rails for repairing the fence, but I was always answered that the woods were too wet to work in, and that the fence would certainly be repaired in time. Like all the rainy spells that have occurred since the world began, it came to an end in the course of time, but my crop was so lost in the grass, I was fearful we should never be able to find it. Patience, perseverance and fair weather, however, finally rid my field of the grass, and as I looked over the smiling prospect, I felt that I could say with the poet: "Happy fields, where joy forever dwells." I do n't think any old planter would ever have said, that no one but a moon-struck poet, or a cub farmer, who had never cut his eye-teeth, would have been so green. A few weeks later those identical fields failed to impress me with any such sentiment, and, as I streaked it across them in a 'wild chase after roving cattle, and bounded from corn row to corn row, Ijerked out between jumps: Man's inhumanity to man Ma;kes coiuntless millions mourn.    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6867-00000019"/> 36         BOAZ: It was the vile inhumanity of my freedmen to me that left my fences unrepaired, and the consequence was, as Milton says, "The fruit Of my green growing corn, whose mortal taste, Brought cows into my field, caused half my woe." About the time my corn began to ear well, the cattle found their way into my field, and "Achilles' wrath to Greece the direful spring of woes unnumbered," wasn't a circumstance to mine. I swore by all the heathen gods and goddesses that if the black imps of Satan didn't mend my fence, I'd-- well I didn't say exactly what I would do, but my threat had the desired effect. I never succeeded, however, in getting it more than half done. The stock broke in from day to day, and I passed most of my time on horseback driving them out. Every morning regularly the field was full, and I would hardly get one broken place in the fence repaired, before there would be another to look after. Thus the summer passed away, and as soon as the corn was hard enough to break, I gathered what the cattle had left. "'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful," to behold the result. I didn't get more than half enough to replace what I had used in making the crop, and my corn prospects for another year were, therefore, " ex- ceeding sorrowful." I was just in the mood then to join Ariel's church, for I was fully prepared to believe any doctrine he might advance about the negro, and every day seemed to furnish confirmation strong as proofs of holy writ, that he had just enough of the man in him to be a thing of evil, and not enough ever to rise to anything higher. It seemed to me that I was   HS T'RIBULATIO'N.      37 doomed to reap a harvest of troubles, fully armed to make war on my peace of mind, for they gathered around me at every step like an invading army. I read over the history of Job, to see if I could find any consolation in the wisdom of his comforters, but was soon convinced that they were humbugs. Eliphaz, the Temanite, for instance, tried to persuade him that "although man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward, yet affliction cometh not of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground." I have no doubt that Mr. Eliphaz was a wise man in his way, but I don't think he knew any thing about farming, and I do assert in spite of his respectable authority, that troubles sprang by the cart load out of the ground I was trying to cultivate. Perhaps Job had had some experience similar to mine, and if so, I do not wonder that Eliphaz and Bildad, and Zophar, failed to make much of an impression. Early in the season the caterpillars came, and, sweeping the cotton fields from Dan to Beersheba, made sad havoc among the remaining garlands of beauty which my imagination had wreathed around the farmer's life. My freedmen now began to realize that their portion of the crop would not pay me for the supplies I had let them have, and the accounts they had contracted in some of the little cross-road stores, and the consequence was, they did n't care whether the crop was ever gathered or not. Though I had given them provisions in abundance for the whole year, yet most of them had consumed all their supplies by the lst of September, and applied for more. It was evi- dent that the cotton crop was a failure, and it became very difficult to obtain supplies. All the planters 3    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6867-00000020"/> 38         BOAZ: were situated alike in this matter, and the consequences were very serious to them. It made very little differ- ence to the freedmen, however, for they made nightly raids upon stock of all kinds. They seemed to think that the command, "Arise, get thee out from this land" (Gen. xxxi, 13), applied particularly to hogs, and it was a part of their religious duty to enforce it. Right zealously did they perform this duty, for they made many a one "git up and git." Their penchant for beef might have been attributable to the fact that at that time they believed they were the modern Israel- ites on their way to the land of promise, and they probably thought it was incumbent upon them to wor- ship the calf, but in an improved manner from that which was inaugurated by Miriam and Aaron. I had a very fine cow which abundantly supplied my family with milk. One morning my cow "came up missing," and the forlorn bleat of the calf brought no answering moo from its mother, Burns says that "Syman Brodie had a cow, The cow was lost and he could na find her; When he had done what man could do, The cow cam hame, and her tail behind her." I was not quite so fortunate as the revered Syman was, for mine never "cam hame with her tail behind her." "Ah!" said I, "Confusion now hath made his masterpiece! Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope Old crumples unctuous temple, and stole thence The life of the building," and after a long search I found her, that is, what was   1IS TRIBULATIONS.       39 left of her, which was the head, concealed in a patch of briers. As I stood over her mortal remains, and thought of her many virtues, the words of the old song rose to my lips: "Thou wilt come no more, gentle Annie, Like a flower thy spirit did depart, Thou art gone alas! like the many That have bloomed in the summer of my heart." Oh! the glorious independence of a farmer's life! How free from care! How sweetly prosperity smiles upon him and gilds his pathway with gold-in a horn. Verily, "Jordan is a hard road to travel," and it seemed to get more rugged as I advanced. My family groceries were stored in a small house some fifteen or twenty yards from my dwelling, and early one morn- ing my wife went to give out breakfast. In a moment she returned with a world of horror depicted in her countenance, and exclaimed, as she rushed into the room: "The store-room has been broken open, and there is n't a thing in it." I hastened out to the scene of disaster, and sure enough every thing eatable was gone. Mighty Babylon, "the glory of the kingdoms," "the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency," when "the wild beasts of the islands cried in her deserted houses, and dragoons roamed in her pleasant places," the ruins of Palmyra at the ghostly hour when screech-owls cry and bandogs howl; the mountains of Hepzidam, "where the lion roareth and the whangdoodle mourneth for her first- born," would not have struck me as being half so des- olate as that plundered store-room. As I took in the    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6867-00000021"/> 40          BOAZ: horrible calamity in all its completeness, I involuntarily snatched a handful of hair from my scalp, and ex- claimed- "Oh! that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for my miseries." "O yes!" said my mother-in-law, "I told you so. I knew you would wish your head was any thing else but the gourd it is, before you were done with your farm. But it ain't waters, and your eyes ain't foun- tains of tears, and if they were, all your weeping would n't provide us with breakfast. As we can't live on tears, you had better look out for a stronger diet." I was forcibly impressed with the old lady's good sense, and I therefore "dried up," and went over to a neighbor's to borrow something for breakfast. It hap- pened that the nearest farm belonged to a hard case, whom I had many times endeavored to persuade to adopt a more rational system of farming, but without effect. When I had related the misfortunes which had occurred to me the night before, he had a hearty laugh and readily relieved my wants. As I was going away, he eyed me" rather quizzically and remarked: "I'm much obliged to you, old feller, fur tryin' to teach me how to run a farm, but darn me if I do n't think you need a few lessons yourself. You're a good feller, and I'd hate like forty to lose you fur a naber, but if you'll excuse me fur sayin' it, you're a heap better lawyer than you are a farmer, and I've always heard that every man ought to follow the thing he is most fittin' fur.

My evil genius whispered "never say die," "keep a stiff upper lip," "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again," and many other such crumbs of comfort. I imagined that my first year was an ex- ploring expedition, in which I would discover and mark all the shoals, quicksands and snags in the agri- g   cultural stream, and I would ever afterward be able to steer clear of them all. I therefore got up a 'fresh head of steam, sang out "let her rip," and "went in to win" the next time.    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6867-00000022"/> 42         BOAZ: CHAPTER   IV. The Cornucopia Continued-How I encountered an Agent of the Freedman's Bureau, and How he Wilted. IN common with most of those who planted cotton in 1866, I saw a fortune blooming in the snowy staple, and believed that the lucky farmer had but to reach forth his hand, and pluck it from the royal plant. I believed that, through the instrumentality of her potent king, the South would yet rise, phoenix-like, from her ashes, and would fill the earth with her glory and grandeur. In my mind's eye I saw untold bales of wealth stored on the plantations throughout the South. I saw a network of railways that reached the most sequestered vales, and, over these iron highways, endless trains passed hourly, to and fro, gathering up and bearing our treasured products to the public marts. I saw our inland towns expanding into cities, and our cities rivaling the glories of those ancient capitals of royalty which have been the wonders of all succeeding ages, people of all nations crowding their thorough- fares, and their harbors white with unnumbered sails from every clime. I pitied the man who didn't own a farm in this favored land; for I believed that the capitalists of the world would rush in to develop the   HS TRIBULATIONS.       43 vast resources of the Southern cotton fields, and South- ern land would be worth more or less than a thousand dollars per acre. I regretted that I did n't have the means to buy up all the rich lands around me, for the purpose of speculating upon the hordes of land hunters whom every breeze, from every point of the compass would waft to our shores, but I contented myself with the thought that even my moderate farm, sold at prices I would be able to get in two or three years, would enable me to pass the remainder of my days in opu- lence and ease. Alas I Our fortunes float between the earth and heaven, Like clouds which seem pavilions of the sun, . And are the playthings of the casual wind. As I have already shown in former chapters, before the summer had passed away, all these brightpictures, which fancy had painted upon the landscape of the future, faded from view like the gorgeous panoramas which the sun paints upon the clouds as he sinks to his evening rest. I have already told what a miserable failure my corn crop was, and how the rain and worms vastly shortened the yield of my cotton. When the leaves had all been destroyed, the bolls being fully exposed to the warm rays of the sun, opened all at once, and the fields were as white, as if there had been a summer fall of snow. It was, therefore, an object of no little importance to the planter to get his cotton gathered as rapidly as possible, before the winds and rains of autumn could add another discount to the yield. Cotton pickers were in great demand, and many unscrupulous farmers did    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6867-00000023"/> "         BOAZ: not hesitate to employ hands from neighboring planta- tions, without consulting the owners, whenever an op- portunity offered. Thus it was by no means an un- common occurrence for laborers who were working on shares, and whose portion of the crop had been taken up in supplies from their employers, to quit their own fields, and pick for whoever would employ them and pay them in cash. This was the game that some of my freedmen were practicing upon me, but it was some time before I discovered the fact. I noticed that they were often absent from the field, and that no amount of persuasion could induce them to pick their cotton, but I never dreamed that they were scattered through the country, helping my neighbors at the expense of my crop. An old negro whom I had formerly owned, and who had never left me, finally opened my eyes to the true state of the case, and I determined at once to block the game. I had been imposed upon so much that I now concluded to desert my library, and to look more after the interest of my farm, so the next morn- ing I rose earlier than usual, and took my station in a convenient position for future operations. In a little while one of the gentlemen came whistling along with his cotton sack on his shoulder. "Halloo, Tom!" said I, stepping out, " where. are you going?" "H-I'se gwine down to de cotton patch, sah." "But you are going in the wrong direction-the cotton field is behind you." "W-w-well you see, boss, I 'greed to go down and pick for Mr. Jones to-day. He's mighty pushed, and I 'greed to help him outen his tite." "I am pushed too, Tom, and you must get my cotton   HS TRIBULATIONS.      45 out before you pick for any one else. So I want you to get back to my field, and that in a hurry." "Can't do it to-day, boss-I ain't no slave to be drove that ar way, and I'm a gwine down to Mr. Jones'." With that he started on, and I fell aboard of him with a stout hickory, very much to his amazement. I do n't think an "American gentleman of African de- scent" ever got a sounder mauling than I gave Tom. He finally broke for his own field, and I after him, pouring it into him thick and fast at every jump. By the quarters, in full view of the whole place, and down the turning row we flew, until I finally gave up the chase from sheer exhaustion. The whole quarter was roused by the noise, and went out to see what the matter was. I took occasion to give them all a general-stirring up, and swore by the great Csesar that I had submitted to their rascalities as long as I intended to, and that if they did n't get into the cotton field in the shortest kind of order, I would make a ghost of the last one of them. They saw that my dander was up, and not understanding exactly what I meant by making a ghost of 'them, thought, no doubt, I intended to conjure them in some way. At any rate they charged the cotton field to a man, and I never had such a day's work done before. That night his highness, Tom, slipped over to town, and lodged a charge against me with the agent of the Freedman's Bureau. The next morning I received due notice of'the fact, with a summons to appear and answer to the charge. I knew that every negro on the place was fully aware of what had been done, and was watching the result with interest. Before going I rode 3*    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6867-00000024"/> "         BOAZ:       ' out to the field, and told them I was going to answer to Tom's charge, and that he had given himself unnec- essary trouble, for the Freedman's Bureau man would never bother me about it. "But woe unto thee, Tom," said I, shaking my finger ominously at him, "if thou ever doest the like again. It were better for thee that thou hadst never-been born, or, being born, that thy mother had tied a millstone to thy neck, and cast thee into the sea, for I swear by the great Leviathan, that I'll feed thy carcass to the fowls of the air, if this happens again." I tried to look very savage, and imagined that my threat struck terror to their souls. At any rate they looked as humble as a score of Uriah Heeps, and I left them to their own reflections. Every Southern planter knows what a vast humbug, what a huge swindle the Freedman's Bureau was, and how its agencies, scattered broadcast throughout the South, stank in the nostrils of the people. It estab- lished in the Southern States a greedy horde of adven- turers, who came with the pithy words of Iago to Roderigo, as their motto, "Put money in thy purse- make all the money thou canst." Whoever felt dis- posed to indulge them in their proclivities had no trouble with them, but they were thorns in the sides of those who were brought in contact with them, and who either would not, or could not pay. I rode forth to encounter one for the first time, but had no fears as to the result. I carried no witnesses, prepared no ar- guments, took no counsel as to what I should say, but was simply careful not to forget my pocket book. Soon after reaching town I encountered the Freedman's Bu-   HS TRIBULATIONS.      47 reau on the street, and invited him to take a drink. I knew that if I expected to farm another year, it was all-important that I should not be hampered in my operations, for I fully intended to pursue another course, and I was fully determined to run the Bureau in my interest. After disposing of a brace of cocktails, I remarked to him that I had some matters of a pri- vate nature to talk over with him, and would be glad if he would dine with me at a neighboring restaurant, at any hour that might be the most convenient to him. He readily consented, and we parted until two o'clock, the hour named by him. I immediately went to the restaurant and ordered dinner for two. At the same time I gave the proprietor a twenty dollar gold piece, with instructions to put it under F. B.'s plate, so that he would find it there at dinner. Punctual to the hour we met, and took our seats at the table, prepared for the onset. Just as F. B. was turning over his plate, I managed to have my attention drawn away, so that he could secure and pocket his prize without my seem- ing to know it. He accomplished the feat in handsome style, and when I turned again to address him, his face was all aglow with pleasure. I saw immediately that he understood the transaction, and every feature of his countenance declared as distinctly and unmistakablyas the finis of a love letter, "I am thine devotedly." Our dinner completed, I ordered wine, and brought the business of the day to a focus. "F. B.," said I, "I have been trying to farm this year with some of the newly enfranchised, and the la- mentations of Jeremiah don't half express the sorrows that have surged through my bosom. I am going to try it another year, but on a different plan. I do nt-    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6867-00000025"/> 48          BOAZ: intend to request them, but to make them do what I wish. It will be impossible for me to do this, if the Freedman's Bureau interferes with my operations, and encourages insubordination. Now, I want you to keep your fingers out of the pie, or only insert it under my directions. I am satisfied that I can make money if I can control my labor, and I will give you one-tenth of the net profits, if you will give me your assistance in compelling my employes to perform their duty under their contract." Before we had finished our bottle of wine our terms were satisfactorily arranged, and the next morning, in accordance with our plan, F. B. rode over to my plan- tation, and explained the peculiar views of the Great Father at Washington toward his colored children. He convinced them thoroughly that their best course was so to conduct themselves, as to avoid the recurrence of such an unpleasantness as had lately taken place between Tom and me, and promised a buck and gag to such as refused to fulfill the terms of their contract. From that time on I had'no trouble with my labor. I stayed in the field most of the time, and whenever my orders were not obeyed, I went for the offender something like Bill Nye went for Ah Sin. The result was that my cotton was soon gathered and housed. But that crop! Oh that crop I "What a fall my coun- trymen," from the glorious yield, which my fancy had pictured in early spring. When the mountain labored and brought forth a mouse, the result was cyclopean compared to my cotton crop.

I was ashamed for my   HS TRIBULATIONS.      49 neighbors to see it, and felt vastly relieved that the commission merchant who had furnished me with supplies had suspended, for I would rather have re- ported the whole crop stolen, or devoured by the locusts, than to have made such a paltry shipment to one who had advanced to me so heavily.    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6867-00000026"/> 50          BOAZ: CHAPTER V. I am not "Alone in my Glory "-The Commission Merchant Gets a Slice-A few Sage Reflections on  the Subject. YES, my commission merchant was a merchant no more. With such patrons as the unfortunate writer, the glory and strength of his house had departed, and he, like the wild Arab of the desert, quietly folded his tent and went-no one knew whither. The last I heard of him, some lawyer had him in tow, and was putting him through a course of bankruptcy. He looked as if "melancholy had marked him for her own," and he was often heard to sing, in dolorous tones: "This world is all a fleeting show, For man's illusion given, The smiles of joy, the tears of woe, Deceitful shine, deceitful flow; There 's nothing true but Heaven." Poor fellow! I do n't suppose he ever thought of Heaven until he lost his money, but who dares throw the first stone at him for that? His career, like that of many an unfortunate genius, was brilliant, but wo- fully brief. Like the meteor that shoots athwart the skies, he passed away and left no trace behind him,   HS TRIBULATIONS.       51 save a ponderous pile of worthless accounts. No doubt the Psalmist had such cases as his in mind when he said: "As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more." The gay flower that blooms in spring and is rudely plucked from its parent stem to grace the button-hole of some country lout, is a sad commentary upon the ephemeral character of earthly glory; but the con- fiding city merchant, who-flourisheth in the morning like a green bay tree, and who takes the farmers in out of the wet until they cling to him like hungry leeches, and slowly suck him dry, is a thing so sad that my heart weeps tears of blood when I think of it. Alas, poor Yorick! Doubly alas, poor Brown! I always liked Brown. He had such a pleasant way of keeping himself in the memory of his patrons. Every month regularly he rendered his account current, with the commission and interest added in, and then two and a halr per cent. on the whole for advancing; and, although we country bumpkins saw our bills of mer- chandise expand like rising storms, with these con- tinual additions of commissions and interest, yet it was done so beautifully, with various-colored inks, and always accompanied with such polite letters giving us a statement of the variations in the price of cotton since his last; of the stock on hand in Europe, the price of gold, etc., that we could n't help feeling flattered by his attentions. A doubt, like a passing cloud, would sometimes rise in my mind that I would never be able to pay an account that seemed to grow as rapidly as Jack's bean-stalk, but then it was Brown, and Brown a  -  ,          .    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6867-00000027"/> 52         BOAZ: was such a clever fellow, and we all owed him such a debt of gratitude, that we ought not to grumble at being gouged a little. Then it must have been such a pleasure to him to see his accounts growing under his skillful manipulations, and spreading around the cotton fields of his farmers as the fisherman spreads his nets around the unwary shad. Brown had such a pleasant way of speaking of his farmers, that "it was like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments." Ah! Brown, verily thou wast a cunning dog. It is said that every man ought to be the architect of his own fortune, and, if thy architecture failed, it was no fault of thy arithmetic. I have often watched thee, in my mind's eye, standing among thy ledgers, and count- ing thy fortune as it rolled up like a swelling flood, until I could almost hear thee exclaim with the great Richelieu: "I was born q Beneath the aspect of a bright-eyed star, And my triumphant adamant of soul Is but the fixed precursor of success." And when the cruel rumor reached me that thou hadst collapsed, that thy credit was not strong enough to bear thee on to the rich fruition of thy schemes, I felt bad, Brown, and no mistake. Thy memory even now is always the precursor of melancholy musings. The mention of thy name makes me think of the death of innocent children, of landslides, of the struck eagle, of burnt Chicago, of George Francis Train in prison, or poor Marco Bozzaris, falling just as " the red field   HS TRIBULATIONS.       53 was won." , How often, Brown, has a thought of thee -I do n't know why, unless it be that thy breaking was almost as "sad a fate as death-suggested those beautiful lines of Halleck: "Come to the bridal chamber, death! Come to the mother's when she feels, For the first time, her first-born's breath; Come when the ilessed seals That close the pestilence are broke, And crowded cities wail its stroke; Come in consumption's ghastly form, The earthquake shock, the ocean storm; Come when the heart beats high and warm, With banquet song, and dance and wine; And thou art terrible-the tear, The grave, the knell, the pall, the bier; And all we know or dream or fear Of agony, are thine." There was a slight difference between Bozzaris and Brown. The Greek chieftain lived to hear the proud hurrah of his comrades that the red field was won, and then passed away as "Calmly as to a night's repose, Like flowers at set of sun; " but Brown's shirt tail was a little too short to reach his promised goal, and the poor fellow collapsed in the midst of his ledgers, ere he had the pleasure of finger- ing the proceeds of his farmer's crops. I do n't know into what corner of the "wide, wide world" he has drifted, but if these lines should ever reach him, I beg him to remember that I have wept over his misfortune    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6867-00000028"/> 54          BOAZ: as bitterly as ever Jeremiah wept over the woes of Israel. Brown was a representative man. He was not the only merchant whom 1866 sent up a spout. The shores of the commercial sea were strewn with their wrecks, and I am sorry to say that we farmers were the wreck- ers. I do n't know how it was in other States, but in Louisiana the mania for cotton was something like tulip mania that swept over the Netherlands in a by- gone age. Almost every man who did n't cultivate cotton wanted to sell it, and commission merchants sprang up like mushrooms. They saw a new Califor- nia, in handling his majesty at thirty-five and forty cents per pound, anchored with advances at rates of interest that old Shylock would have blushed to ask, and they went for him like a duck for a junebug. There was a certain class of these merchants who were thoroughly mushroom, and while the farmers thought there was a fortune in cotton, they thought there was a fortune in the farmers. Unfortunately there was also a class of mushroom farmers-rather a numerous class-among whom, I am sorry to say, was your very humble and unworthy servant. These mushroom merchants, having their business to form, angled for the farmers as assiduously as enthusiastic sportsmen, angle for trout, and, strange to say, they generally bagged the mushroom farmer. Being new in the busi- ness, they were, of course, unknown, and were com- pelled to send their agents out to solicit patronage. The reliable farmers generally did business with the old established merchants, and the farmers whom those agents bagged for their firms were generally those who could n't get help where they were best known. It   HS TRIBULATIONS.       55 was a melancholy situation for-the mushroom mer- chant, but such is life. They reminded me of Sir Guy Le Scroope and the magnificent feast he prepared for his hosts of particular friends. The historian of this feast says: "It's in Bolton Hall, and the clock strikes one, And the roast meat 's brown, and the boiled meat's done, And the barbecued sucking pig's crisp to a turn, And the pancakes are fried and beginning to burn; The fat stubbe goose swims in gravy and juice, With the mustard and apple sauce ready for use, Fish, flesh and fowl, and all of the best, Want nothing but eating-they 're already dressed." But the favored guests whom Sir Guy expected failed to go, and his feast got cold and he swore: "It 's a monstrous great bore when a gentleman feels A good appetite, thus to be kept from his meals. It 's in Bolton Hall, and the clock strikes two! And the scullions and cooks are themselves in a stew, And the kitch-maids stand, and do n't know what to do, For the rich plum puddings are bursting their bags, And the mutton and turnips are boiling to rags; And the fish are all spoiled, and the butter's oleine, And the soup's got cold in the silver tureen, And there's nothing, in short, that 's fit to be seen. While Sir Guy Le Scroope continues to fume, And to fret by himself in the tapestried room; And still fidgets, and looks more cross than the cooks, And repeats that bad word, which we've softened to zooks." So Sir Guy finally ordered the dinner served for whoever might come.    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6867-00000029"/> 56          BOAZ: "And in rushed a troop of strange guests-such a group As had ne'er before darkened the doors of the Scroope! And nbw what a din, without and within! For the court-yard is full of them. How they begin To mop and to mow, and make faces and grin! Cock their tails up together, like cows in hot weather,  And butt at each other, all eating and drinking, The viands and wine disappearing like winking." The narrator then goes on to remark: What words can express the dismay and distress Of Sir Guy, when, he found such a terrible mess?" It was just so with our mushroom merchants. They made due preparations to make advances to the farm- ers, and to sell their cotton. They could n't afford to let their money lie idle in the banks-it's a pity they hadn't-so they were not very particular as to whom they accommodated. Before the end of the year, they found, in many instances, that they had caught a troop of strange guests, like Sir Guy's, and, like him, they soon wound up in a terrible mess. As I have thus far said nothing that is either practi- cal or sensible, I will just here venture an observation of that kind, as an experiment: "Which I wish to re- mark, and my language is plain," that any farmer who depends upon his commission merchant for the neces- sary supplies to cultivate his crop, can never prosper, and any commission merchant who has such a class of farmers for his patrons, will end his career in a bank- rupt court, as sure as the man who plants by the moon will, or will -not succeed, according to circum- stances.

I WAS seated one pleasant morning upon the porch, lost in one of those delicious reveries which sometimes steal over one like the "sweet south breathing upon a bank of violets." It was one of those warm sunny days, toward the close of the winter, when the earth seemed jubilant at the approach of spring. Tiny sprigs of green were rising in profusion to bathe in the warm sunbeams, and the red-bird warbled his clear notes in the neighboring woods. On one side was a wall of living green, where a forest of grand old magnolias interlaced their branching arms, whose glistening leaves danced merrily to the music which the wanton zephyrs, in their flight, struck from nature's harp, and, on the other, broad acres of fertile glebe reached away, from whose bosom the cheerful song of the laborer rose, ever and anon, and floated away until the simple melody died in the distance. Above me the sky was beautifully clear, flecked only with occasional clouds, so light and fleecy, that in my dreamy state I could al- most imagine they were messengers of peace silently   HS TRIBULATIONS.       59 winging their way between heaven and earth. 'It seemed to me that the spirit of God was manifestly abroad, and my whole being was subdued into harmony with the peaceful scene. I was oblivious of the past year's misfortunes, and that soft, sunny day was, as it were, a prism through which life was pictured in beauty upon my soul. All the bits of poetry I knew, in which the glories of nature are described, trickled through my mind like a gentle stream that trickles softly down the green hillside. I was repeating to myself This land is very beautiful, This land where I am now, A sunlit sky is overhead, Soft breezes fan my'brow, And myriad flowers, that never bloom In climes less warm than this, Waste, on the wooing breeze, their souls In ecstacy of bliss, when I became dimly conscious of the presence of a discordant element that seemed to float through my reverie like a false note in a strain of melody, but I was so lost in the delicious dreams, engendered by the sweet influences around me, that I was loth to call my senses back from those enchanting realms through which they were wandering in blissful freedom. "Boaz! are you deaf?" This time there was no mistaking the sound. I was rudely awakened from my beautiful day-dream, and there sat my mother-in-law, knitting as assiduously as citizeness Defarge, revelling in the march of her victims to the guillotine. There was a trace of malice in the gleam of her eyes, as she peered at me over her    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6867-00000031"/> 60          BOAZ: spectacles, and a real Pincheon smile wreathed her withered lips. "I suppose," said she, "you are counting over the net proceeds of your farm last year, and thinking how rich you will grow, if you can only do as well again." I made no answer, but mentally longed for a lodge in some vast wilderness, some boundless contiguity of shade, where mothers-in-law and rumors of mothers-in- law might never reach me more. "I have a little document here," continued she, "which I would like for you to read." She handed me a carefully-folded paper which she had neatly labeled AN AGRICULTURAL ESSAY-BY BOAZ, JR. It seemed that she had found a composition which my little boy, who was going to school, had written as a Friday evening exercise, and it was this which she gave me to read. I opened the paper and read in the cramped hand of a boy just learning to write, THE FARMER. The farmer is a man, but sometimes he's a widder. Our nabur Mrs. Jones is a farmer, and she's a widder.

Grandma says Pa is a fool for tryin' to farm. She says a farmer that can't   HS TRIBULATIONS.       61 raise his own vittles orter be taken out on 2 chips. Would n't it be funny to see Granma totin' Pa out on 2 chips-she 'd have to git all-fired big chips, fur he'd riggle wuss nur a fishin' wurm on a hook. But wimmen do n't know nuthing about them things. If it was the farmer's biznis to raise his own vittles, what would be the use of the country store-keepers havin' sech things fur sale. Mi Pa did n't buy enny cotton last year becawze that wuz his first year on a farm, and he wuzent able to buy every thing the first year-he tried to raise sum, but he didn't do it. I expect he will buy his cotton this year. I hope he will, becawze I reckin every cotton farmer orter have sum, and if he do n't buy hisn I'm frade he won't have enny. I did n't read any more of the stuff, but threw the paper down and started out of the house with all the gravity of outraged dignity. My feelings were not as cheerful and christian like as they might have been, and nothing except my dislike of "a fuss in the family " saved me from an explosion of wrath which would have given a practical illustration of my little boy's idea that "a farmer can't git along without cussin'." In the anger of the moment I imagined that my mother-in-law was in the habit of making sport of my farming operations in the presence of my children, and that the composition of my little son was the result of her friendly criticisms. I am afraid that if her future had been determined by the invocations which filled my mind and heart at that moment, she would never have realized the desire she so often expressed in her favorite little song, 4    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6867-00000032"/> 62          BOAZ: "I want to be an angel, And with the angels stand, A crown upon my forehead, A harp within my hand." I mounted my horse and dashed away at half speed along the smooth road which led through the adjoin- ing forest of evergreens. I do n't know how it is with others, but to me there is an exhilaration in a swiftride upon a fast horse, which no other exercise affords, and on this occasion it operated as a safety-valve through which all my anger oozed away. I was at peace again with all the world, but there were expressions in that composition which clung to me like the Old Man of the Sea, to Sinbad the sailor. Go where I would, I seemed to hear a still, small voice audibly whispering "enny farmer that can't raise his own vittles orter be taken out on 2 chips," and I must confess that I could find no argument to combat the truth and wisdom of the remark. I had been fully impressed the year before with the fact that no farmer could prosper:who had all his "vittles" to buy, and I had determined to make an effort to raise every thing I needed at home, so that, if my cotton failed, I would at least have the means of subsistence for my family and laborers. I was prepar- ing a large proportion of my land for corn, but beyond this I had made no preparation to carry my good in- tentions into execution. I now, however, determined to postpone the matter no longer. I had a tract of land, well wooded with oak, and so situated near my house that I could inclose it by making a new fence on one side only. I immediately had the necessary rails split and the pasture fence made.   HS TRIBULATIONS.      63 The next item was to get a stock of hogs. This I hoped to accomplish at a public sale which was soon to take place some ten or fifteen miles distant. An old gentleman had recently died, who, while living, had devoted a great deal of attention to raising hogs, and his stock was quite a large one. They were all to be sold in order to settle up' his estate, and I had no doubt would go-very cheap, as most people at that time, placed no value whatever upon such property, on ac- count of the danger to which it was exposed from ne- groes, who scorned the flimsy pretext of meum et tuum as to this world's goods, and especially as to hog meat. As my pasture, however, was situated near my house, I thought I would be able to protect my hogs from roving thieves. In due course of time the sale was made, and, as I anticipated, there were very few bidders for the hogs. I therefore purchased about a hundred, including pigs and shoats, for a mere song, and drove them to my pasture. I bought all the cot- ton seed I could obtain in my neighborhood, and made a convenient heap of them, where my hogs could feed at pleasure through the summer. In order to improve the stock, I then purchased eight or ten head of pure Berkshires, of which I was exceedingly proud. I kept the females in a grass lot near the house, where they would be constantly under my eye, and the males I permitted to roam at large in the pasture. I was par- ticularly careful, however, to pen them every night. with the other Berkshires, so that no one could disturb them without my knowledge. My whole stock throve finely, but my Berkshires were my particular delight. They were to me a well-spring of pleasure; my " ap-    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6867-00000033"/> "         BOAZ: ples of gold in pictures of silver;" my Koh-i-noors among swine; my "Glow-worms golden In a dell of dew, Scattering unbeholden Their Terial hue Among the flowers and grass which screen them from the view." I don't know how many times a day I went out to the lot to scratch them with a corn cob, and see them stretch out their well-rounded limbs and grunt in lazy ecstacy. They were too beautiful, I thought, to "blush unseen," like Gems of purest ray serene Which the dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear, and I never let a neighbor pass without calling him in to admire my pets. There was no mistaking the fact that they were "real loves" of hogs, and every one who saw them wanted a pig. I do n't know how many pigs I contracted to sell, but they would have been marvellous hogs, if they had supplied the demand. I congratulated myself that, if I had not succeeded so well in my farming, my hogs would form a com'pensa- tion balance, which would counteract my agricultural misfortunes. Though I delighted in my Berkshires, I did not neglect my stock at large, and many a time, in the still hour of the night, did I creep forth and make a tour of my pasture to see that no prowling thief disturbed them. One morning I went out as usual to inspect my   HS TRIBULATIONS.       65 Berkshires, and found one of them sick. I didn't suppose it amounted to much, and thought no more about it. I was very much oceupied that day, and did n't see my pets again until evening. I then found the sick one of the morning dead,- and two more seri- ously affected. I now became thoroughly alarmed, and consulted all the old farmers around as to what I should do for them. One said give them lard and pepper, and I gave them lard and pepper. Another said coal oil was good, and down went the coal oil. A third re- commended tar for both sick and well. It was, he said, an excellent remedy for the sick, and a fine pre- ventive for the well. I incontinently treated to tar straight all around. It is useless, however, to enumer- ate the remedies. They all failed, and I had the ex- quisite mortification of seeing all my Berkshires de- part to "That undiscovered country from whose bourne No traveler returns." The disease passed from my Berkshires to the com- mon swine in the pasture, and the rapidity with which they died reminded me of the Destruction of Senna- charib, For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast, And breathed in the face of my hogs as he passed, And the eyes of those porkers waxed deadly and chill, And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still! And there laid those hogs with their nostrils all wide, But through them there rolled not the breath of their pride; No more could they dig with the root searching snout, Like the gay hopes of youth they had gone up a spout.    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6867-00000034"/> "         BOAZ: In the midst of my hog troubles there was one fact which was almost as consoling as the old back-wood- man's milk punch, which he declared was food and raiment too. That was, my hogs might all have died, but did n't quite do it. I had a few left, which; with proper care, might yet be made to yield their quota to a "farmer's vittles." But my beautiful Berskshires were things of the past, not one was left. As I gazed on their vacant lot and idle troughs, I felt wonderfully tempted to strike an attitude, and exclaim with the fair Hinda, ( O, ever thus from childhood's hour," etc., but I choked down the desire, and vowed I would n't do it. I concluded that, as I had such a number of dead hogs on hand, I had better exercise my ingenuity in utilizing them than in spouting poetry. I had read somewhere that the carcass of an animal was one of the finest manures known for fruit trees. I had planted an orchard of young trees the year before, and I now determined to try the experiment. I therefore ordered some of my gentlemen of color to haul the dead hogs to the orchard, and bury one at the root of each tree, as far as they would go. The weather being still cool, decomposition was slow in beginning, and the hogs were all buried without any trouble. I had occasion to visit New Orleans on business, where I was detained some eight or ten days, atthe end of which time I took a steamer for home. The boat reached my plantation a little after midnight, and landed to put me ashore. As I was going out I heard one of the deck hands say to another:   HS TRIBULATIONS.       67 "I golly, Sam, thar must a bin a fight among the polecats 'round here, and they all got thar stink pots busted. It's a rale pity to waste such a site er per- fume." There did seem to be an unusual quantity of unlaw- ful odor lying loose around, but it didn't strike me with any particular force at that moment. The night was very dark and warm. I stumbled on toward the house, and the scent; grew stronger at every step. I could see no light in the dwelling, which was a very unusual circumstance, and perfect silence brooded over the whole place. The smell, however, was terrible. The atmosphere seemed to be so thickened with it that I could almost feel it, and taste it as I breathed. What on earth did it mean? I grasped my nose and made a rush for the house. I reached the door and gave an alarm that would have waked the seven sleepers, but received no answer. Nothing broke the death-like stillness, but that deathly odor " to the clouds in dread- ful billows swelled," and surge upon surge shot into my nose with terrific force. "Great heavens!" said I, "can it be possible that my family are all dead and decomposing without burial in a civilized community." This, however, I knew was not possible, but I could stand the situation no longer. If I loosed for a mo- ment the grip I had on my nose, the smell was more than any mortal creature could bear. If I breathed through my mouth I could taste the putrid matter in the air, and, if I closed both mouth and nose, suffoca- tion would have been the inevitable result. I therefore fled, and I have always thought that the time I made would have done credit to Lexington in his palmiest    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6867-00000035"/> 68          3OAZ: days. I made for the nearest negro house, which was about a quarter of a mile distant, and, as soon as I reached the door, I called lustily for John. "Is dat you, Mass'r Boaz?" "Yes!" said I. "What in the name of Jehosaphat is the matter here? Where is my family, and what in thunder is all this smell about?" I could hear the old fellow chuckle as he opened the door, and I therefore knew there was no cause for alarm. "I golly, Mass'r Boaz, I'se mighty glad to see you. You bin well?" "Yes! I am well, but what makes such an infernal odor at the house, and where is my family?" "Why, sir, its dem hogs what you had sot out dar in de orchid. You see, a few days arter you lef', dar was de orfullest rain I ever hearn, which washed all de dirt offen de hogs, and arter the rain was over de sun come out powerful hot, and sich anuder stink as riz outen dat orchid I neber did see, and neber spects to see agin.

Dey 'se all well, 'cause I seed 'em dis berry evenin'." My feelings were all too deep for utterance. I dared not trust myself to express an opinion, lest I should violate the Third Commandment in a shameful man- ner. The idea that I, who aspired to the position of the model farmer of the neighborhood, should have run my family off, and made my place a nuisance to passers along the highway, was humiliating in the ex- tjemne. I knew I should never hear the last of it, and   HS TRIBULATIONS.       69 that my " new-fangled" manure for an orchard would be the standing joke of the season. Wrapped in anger and mortification, I strode over to a neighbor's to spend the night. When I had roused him up, I said: "Look here, Jones, I want a bed for the night. You know why, and if you don't keep as quiet as a mouse on the subject there 'll be a funeral in the Jones family as sure as the sun shines." "Or hogs spoil," added he with a good humored smile. He was too considerate, however, to press the matter, and delicious sleep soon made me oblivious of all the scents that the human nose is heir to. 4*    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6867-00000036"/> 70         BOAZ: CHAPTER VII. A Porcine Funeral-I am Thrilled with Onions, Cabbage and Horse-radish, SOME poet, m describing one of those paragons which sparkle in song like gems in a royal diadem, says: "Sweet thoughts, like honey bees, made a hive of her soft bosom's cell and clustered there." The morning after my arrival at home, even if Ihad been arrayed in all the pomp and circumstance of huge chignon, frizzled hair and hoop skirt, I am afraid I could not have sat for that picture. My thoughts were indeed like honey bees, but the bees were all in a rage, and, instead of plastering my soft bosom's cell with honey, they were pegging away like all wrath with their infernal stings. Why did n't my wife have the dogoned hogs covered up, instead of running away and making me an object for the wits of the neighbor- hood to shoot their fun at, was a mammoth bee which buzzed around considerably, and socked his sting into my amiability at every turn. Another bee, which was by no means n  odie in his share of the annoyance, was the consciousness that my mother-in-law would never tire of telling every one she met how her precious son-in-law purchased twenty-five dollar Berkshire pigs to manure his fruit trees with, and let them. perfume   HS TRIBULATIONS.       71 his family out of house and home. My thoughts were not as placid as those of a dreaming poet, but my usual good nature finally triumphed, and determined me to make a joke of the whole matter myself, and to laugh as heartily at my mishap as any of my friends. I went over as'early as possible to make a reconnoissance of the situation. The orchard was on the south of my dwelling, and very near to it. I had not superintended in person the burial of the hogs in the orchard, and the consequence was they were scarcely covered. The first heavy rain washed all the dirt from over them, and the southern breezes, which prevailed at the time, wafted the accumulating odors directly from the orchard to the house. It was very evident that, with such a mass of rotting flesh in such proximity to their noses, my family must have done one of three things. They must either have stopped the smell, quit the premises, or undergone the pangs of martyrdom. Why my wife did not attempt to have the hogs cov- ered again, I could not imagine. Perhaps the negroes not liking the job, persuaded her it could not be done; perhaps she bent before the storm which her respected mother brewed over the matter, and left without con- sidering whether or not there was any other way of escape than in flight. My first move, of course, was to stop that terrible odor. For this purpose I bor- rowed all the one-horse carts I could find in the neigh- borhood, to which I had my best mules hitched. Going to the windward of the orchard, I had the carts loaded with dirt and drawn up in line. I had pro- vided a jug of whisky, and a few drinks round put all my freedmen in a fine humor for a frolic, which they were now disposed to make of reburying the hogs. '    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6867-00000037"/> 72          JOA'z: Some of them had been soldiers, and jocularly termed the orchard the hog battery, which they were going to storm. "Now, boys," said I to the drivers, " each of you must select a tree and charge down upon it with all the speed you can get out of your mules, tumble out your dirt upon the hogs, and I reckon you '1 get back in a hurry without any special orders. Are you all ready?-charge!" At the word of command they put whip to their mules, and, while the welkin rang with their hilarious shouts, they charged the orchard in handsome style. As they sped across the intervening space between them and the masked batteries, I involuntarily ex- claimed: "O for a Tennyson to embalm this thrilling charge in song!" Odors to right of them, Odors to left of them, Odors in front of them, Unmingled with roses;. Surrounded with such a smell,' Boldly they drove, and well, Into the mouth of hell, With uncovered noses. Down they went in full gallop upon the first line of trees, and dumped out their dirt; then back to the starting point they drove with all the fury of racing charioteers, and took a drink. I was not with Alex- ander the Great, nor any of those ancient worthies in their expeditions of war, but I will venture to say that the charge of my charioteers was as gallant as any of   HS TRIBULATIONS.       73 theirs, and far more successful. In a very short time every pork battery was silenced, their guns were all spiked, and the soft southern breeze swept away the last remnant of their presence. Boaz was himself again, and his homestead smiled once more amidst embowering vines as sweetlyas if it had never known other than perennial odors of roses. I There are moments, I think, when the spirit receives Whole volumes of joy on its unwritten leaves, When the folds of the heart in a moment unclose, Like the innermost leaves from the heart of the rose, And thus when those odors had passed from the sky, The thoughts it awoke were too deep to pass by; It left my full soul like the wing of a dove, All fluttering with pleasure and fluttering with love. If any one doubts my feelings on the occasion, let him try the situation, and, when he gets out of it, if he does n't feel as if his soul were greased with the oil of joy, he can take my-well, my opinion that he has no appreciation for the fine arts. My next move, of course, was to find my family and get them home again. I therefore posted off to town, and soon found them enjoying the hospitality of a rela- tive. My wife was only too happy to return when I assured her that the atmosphere was as balmy as the spicy breezes that "Blew soft o'er Ceylon's isle." My mother-in-law, however, wrapped in the digni- fied grandeur of an offended nose, declared that it was utterly impossible to purify the premises under six    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6867-00000038"/> 74          BOAZ: months, and vowed that she had suffered just as long as she intended to bymy insane proceedings. If Mary was fool enough to go back with me, she could go, but as to herself, she would try and find a home, among people who had some common sense. Did she really mean not to return? Was it possible that such an undreamed of piece of good fortune was in store for me? My heart leaped with joy. How true it is, thought I, that everything happens for the best. Blessed hog epidemic! It has paid me better than all the bacon I could have made at twenty-five cents per pound. Respect, however, for the feelings of my wife bridled my tongue, and I bade the old lady a blissful adieu. Evening found my little family once more in the old homestead, oblivious of shrouding troubles, and, in our reunion, realizing to its fullest extent that domestic happiness which Cowper says is the " -- only bliss Of Paradise that has survived the fall." The general operations of my farm went on as smoothly as I could desire. Taught by the experience of the previous year, I refused to have my land culti- vated on shares. I employed all my laborers for monthly wages, so that I could control their actions, and have any work performed that suited my views. One of my pet theories was that our farmers yielded too abjectly to the sway of King Cotton; that, in order to prosper, they must, to a certain extent, declare their independence of his Royal Highness, and so diversify their crops as to be beyond the reach of his capricious- ness. My cotton had proved such a failure the year   HS TRIBULATIONS.       75 before that I determined to set a good example to my neighbors by planting a variety of crops. I would make sure of an abundant supply of peas and pota- toes, corn, hay, etc., but what should I plant as a par- tial substitute for cotton, was the question which puz- zled me. I was sitting one winter evening by the fire, looking over the Report of the Commissioner of Agri- culture for the year 1865. I came to the article on onions, and was startled by the figures of Elisha Slade and Peter Henderson. Elisha said " the Weatherfield large red is the most prolific. In some instances, over nine hundred bushels have been 'produced to the acre. The market price of onions in large cities, at the proper selling season, is rarely less than fifty cents a bushel or more than two dollars." Peter followed with the declaration that " the amount sold per acre has always been with me greater than any other crop, although requiring more labor to produce it. It has never sold for less than $500 per acre, and on one occasion, as high as $2,100." I was astonished, and called my wife to look in the last New Orleans paper, and tell me the price of onions. She answered, "Seven dollars per barrel." 'Just think of it," said I; "over nine hundred bushels to the acre, at over two dollars per bushel, will give a clear profit of fully fifteen hundred dollars  per acre. Mary, I'm going to plant a crop of onions."  I read to her the statements of Mr. Slade and Mr. Henderson, which she was inclined to believe were rather Munchausenish. "Oh! its all as true as gospel," said I. "This book    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6867-00000039"/> 76          BOAsZ: is published by authority of the government, for the purpose of fostering the agricultural interests of the country, and there can be no doubt about the truth of its statements." I read on, but soon interrupted her again. "Mary, what is the price of cabbage in that paper?" She looked, and found them quoted at fifteen dollars per hundred. "Geewiliken!" said I; "fifteen dollars per hun- dred! Why, that's one hundred and fifty dollars per thousand and Mr. Henderson says one can raise twelve thousand to the acre, which will give a revenue of eighteen hundred dollars per acre. Mary, I'll plant a crop of cabbage as sure as thunder." The most thrilling novel could not have excited me more than my Report, and I returned to its pages with renewed interest. I had not read far before I bounced out of my chair with excitement, exclaiming: "Mary, I 'm a rich man. I am going to plant all the horse-radish I can put in. You know it grows in our garden almost without trouble, and Mr. Hender- son says it is the most safe and profitable crop known. It will yield eight hundred dollars to the acre, and the cultivation is so simple that there can be no such thing as failure. What fools we farmers are to waste our time with cotton, when we have a certain fortune in onions, cabbage and horse-radish." "But, my dear, you surely mean to plant some cotton?" "Not a single seed. I would be crazy indeed to plant cotton, which can not yield more than one hun- dred dollars per acre at best, when I can make from a   MS TRIBULATIONS.       " thousand to two thousand dollars on onions, cabbage and horse-radish." I felt that I had struck the high road to fortune at last, and my wife and I sat up until a late hour can- vassing the subject in all its phases. I was confident and wild in my dreams of profits. My wife was skep- tical, and thought that I had better make cotton my principal crop, and try some of the others on a small scale. If I found them as profitable as I imagined, I could then devote my entire attention to their cultiva- tion. I was loth to lose a whole year of these marvel- lous profits, but yielded so far to the persuasions of my wife as not to give up cotton entirely. Our consulta- tion finally resulted in the determination to set apart a sufficient quantity of land for the cultivation of corn, peas and potatoes, to insure an abundant supply, and to divide the remainder into lots, one of which should be planted in cotton, one in cabbage, one in onions, and one in horse-radish. I felt better satisfied with myself and my prospects than I had at any time during my agricultural career, and I went to bed ex- claiming: "Ioll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean-roll," who cares a nickle whether or not "Time writes wrinkles on thy azure brow?" while onions are worth seven dollars a barrel and cab- bage fifteen dollars per hundred.    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6867-00000040"/> 78          BOAZ: CHAPTER VIII. Cabbage and Onions a Power-Philosophical Reflections upon the Nature of Cuffee. Ha! what is this that rises to my touch So like a cushion? Can it be a cabbage? It is, it is that deeply injured flower Which boys do flout us with,-but yet I love thee, Thou giant rose, wrapped in a green surtout. Doubtless in Eden thou didst blush as bright As these, thy puny brethren, and thy breath Sweetened the fragrance of her spicy air. There is no doubt that Holmes' tailor's head was level in his views of "that deeply injured flower." Where is the man whose mouth does not perform its functions of chewing, and rolling a sweet morsel under his tongue, whenever that "giant rose wrapped in a green surtout"--vulgarly yclept a cabbage-comes within the range of his visional organs, and will not say with the musing tailor, "I love thee?"-likewise, the same concerning onions. There is not a particle of doubt that cabbage and onions are a power in the land--especially onions, when mingled with the balmy breath that floats through one's nose, as   HS TRIBULATIONS.       79 The breathing airs, from ocean born, Breeze up the bay, and lead the lively morn. The graceful lily, the immaculate japonica, the thousand hued rose, the magnificent victoria regia, may charm the eye and fill the soul with pleasure that passeth all understanding, but, to live and die by, they pale their ineffectual fires before those twin queens of the vegetable kingdom-cabbage and onions. From Greenland's icy mountains to India's coral strand, the noble lords of creation, feel the potent sway of the queens -aforesaid, and bow before their savory dishes-- in humble adoration. It is a well-known fact that the wandering Israelites sighed more for the onions of Egypt, than they longed for the glories of Canaan, that Hanibal tolled his Car- thagenian army across the sultry plains of Spain, and over the snow-clad peaks of the Alps, and kept alive in their minds the cry of "on to Rome," with onions; that Zenobia, the proud .queen of Palestine, whose brow was encircled with one of the brightest crowns of antiquity, and who was led a' captive through the streets of Rome, bound with a chain of gold, to the triumphal car of Aurelian, might have escaped her fate had it not been for her stores of onions which nourished the languishing army of her conqueror, and healed his scurvied soldiers. But for this the ruins of Palmyra might never have been for the moon- light to bathe in melancholy splendor, and "highfa- lutin" orators to wreathe with funereal flowers of elo- quence. Annihilate saur kraut, and the glorious Dutchman- the child of Mars-the favorite of the muses-whose    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6867-00000041"/> 80          BOAZ: corpus approaches nearer a mathematical sphere than that of any other human being, would shrink to a lean-bellied Cassius, "who loves no music, and hears no plays, who seldom smiles, or smiles in such a sort, as if he mocked himself, and scorned his spi it that he could be moved to smile at any thing." Wipe out onions, and the fiery Frenchman would dry up and leave "la ,belle France" a howling wilderness; the throat-cutting Spaniard, and the lassoing Mexican would stop those little national amusements, and the want of onions would Like a worm i' the bud, Feed on their damask cheeks, And with a green and yellow melancholy They'd sit like Patience on a monument Smiling at grief. And New England, proud New England, the only country on the face of the earth which has a Pilgrim's Rock, would not leave a grease spot to tell where her sages climbed the dizzy heights of science, where Long- fellow dandled Mrs. Hiawatha's papooses on his knee, and where wooden nutmegs were invented to give em- ployment to the swarms of little pilgrims that sprung up from the imperial seed. Then hurrah for cabbage and onions! No wonder that frail mortality lavishy barters its gold for the savory plants. Long may they wave o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. Such and so on, ad, ifilaitnm, were the thoughts which trailed through my mind, and gave new warmth to the enthusiasm which glowed within my bosom, and painted my future with ease and independence.   HS TRIBULATIONS.       81 I went to work immediately to arrange my fields to suit my plan of operations, and, as soon as was practi- cable, put in my various crops. My ally of the Freed- man's Bureau, like the honest, honorable, high-toned gentleman that he always was, for a reasonable consider- ation, had thrown his weighty influence in my favor, and I had no difficulty in securing all the labor I wanted under contracts as binding as I could contrive, which, while they secured the laborers ample justice in every respect, bound them, under the most stringent obligations, to give their quid pro quo in work, in any manner, shape or form that I might call for. These contracts were drawn up in the presence of, and ap- proved by, the agent of the Freedman's Bureau, who threatened them with the frowning brow of their great Father at Washington, who would never give them that forty acre tract and the mule unless they proved themselves worthy of the gift by a faithful perform- ance of their contracts. He also stated that I was fully authorized to use any means I might deem neces- sary to enforce obedience, but I have ever since been haunted by a suspicion that a stout hickory, which I always carried, and with which I, on several occasions extemporized a game of croquet, using some of their heads for balls, did far more to secure obedience to my orders than either their sense of a moral obligation, or their fear of the frowning brow of the great Father at Washington, with the loss of the mule and the forty acre lot. I regret very much that candor compels me to make this statement. I would like to believe that there is some spring in the mechanism of Cuffee's moral organization which one might touch, and move him to the performance of deeds which " some noble    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6867-00000042"/> 82          BOAZ: poem shall adorn," but in spite of the wisdom which floats down to us benighted Southerners on every Northern gale, I am forced to the conclusion that neither gratitude to man, nor any sense of justice, neither fear of Hell nor love of Heaven, will quicken his perception of morality, and persuade him to per- form his duties with cheerfulness and alacrity half as effectually as a good hickory; energetically applied. The native chiefs that roam "where Afric's sunny fountains roll down their golden sands," understand this little singularity more clearly than New England sages, who have studied his characteristics onthe mon- umental ruins of Egypt, and investigated his ethical nature at long taw, and consequently they are not in the habit of delivering long homilies on the dishonor of not doing as the New England people do, but bring him up to that high standard of perfection in small things, with an ease and coolness that would make your head swim. Tell him to do any thing that he does n't feel in the humor of doing, and if let alone, he will pout in sullen displeasure at having it to do, and then he will sulk a week longer, and grow defiant be- cause he knows you are mad about having the matter half done, as it surely will be. But bounce him at once, if he shirks, and you will be certain to get your work done, and half an hour after his drubbing, he will feel as good-natured and as exultant as a college youth, with a half bottle of champagne inside the- waisthand of his breeches. Cuffee will " go to meetin'" and howl as dismally over his lost condition as a poor lonesome dog, and roll up his eyes as if he were trying to turn them outside in, to see what a "hell sarpent" his miserable soul is, and will get down on the floor   HS TRIBULATIONS.       83 with his Sunday clothes on, and beg the sisters to pray "for jist one drop of savin' grace to wash his sins away," and on his road home he will lift a chicken from its roost, or bag a fat pig with all the child-like simplicity and bland serenity of the " heathen Chinee" in his game of euchre. As a general thing he cherishes no malice, and if you catch him in his rascality, and everlastingly wear him out, he will go on the even tenor of his way singing "When I can read my title clear" as joyously as if he were really on his shining way "To mansions in the skies." It is a pity, a very great pity, for the dignity and glory of the great North American Republic that this is thus; but thus, in my opinion, it is. I remember going to town one day for the purpose of purchasing some provisions, and ordered Tony, one of my freedmen, to drive in with a small wagon to carry them home. It was Saturday evening, and the town was full of the colored aristocracy, and they were full of rot-gut whisky. It was nearly dark when I had completed my purchases, and I told Tony that he had better go home. "I ain't been to town in nigh onter a month, Mass'r Boaz, and I wants to stop and talk with the boys a little afo' I goes, sir." 'Very well," said I, "but remember, I hold you responsible for all that is in the wagon. If anything is stolen, you will halve to pay for it." "Dat's all right, sir. I'd just like to see any of    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6867-00000043"/> 84         BOAZ: dese niggers steal anything outen dat wagin. I knows niggers too well for dat, and I'se got Ben dar watchin' fur me." I remained in the store talking with some friends, and it was n't long before I heard Tony sing out: "Ben, .wlar 's dat ham?" What ham?" said Ben. "Why, one of dem hams is gone outen dis yere wagin, and you'se de berry nigger dat took it." "I neber done no sich a thing." "Yes you did, and you'se got to git it, too." Thereupon Tony seized Ben by the collar, and, without any resistance whatever, threw him on the ground, and applied a wagon whip to the seat of his breeches in a style well calculated to impress upon him the importance of the commandment, "Thou shalt not steal." Ben howled and protested his innocence, and begged for mercy, but never once tried to defend him- self. Still Tony plied his whip, thundering out every now and then, "Whar's dat ham?" until he had given him a most unmerciful whipping. Finally, some one standing by caught the whip, and made Tony stop his little amusement. Ben rose whimpering like a whipped school-boy, and rubbing the seat of his breeches as furiously as if the ants had made a nest there, and were extending their usual courtesies to disturbers of their peace. "Why, Ben," said I, "you are a stouter man than Tony, and since you have taken that drubbing so good naturedly, you ought to return the favor, and give him a little." "Dat's a fac, Mass'r Boaz, anl I'm just the nigger- to do it, too. Durn me if I don't."   HS TRIBULATIONS.      85 In a moment more Tony was down and Ben had the whip, and the programme was completely reversed, amidst roars of laughter from the by-standers, most of whom were negroes. At the first stroke, Tony yelled piteously: "You Ben, you quit yer foolin'. Dat hurts. I was jus' jokin', Ben. I knowedyou never tuk dat ham. Less quit dis playin' an go home. Mass'r Boaz, make Ben let me git up from-here, I want to go home. I'm gwine to git anudder ham dis minnit, myself. I knowed all de time Ben neber tuck it. I jus' thought I'd skeer it outen some dese udder niggers." "Ben, I think you ought to let him off," said I, "as he has apologized and acknowledged that you did not take the ham." This he readily agreed to do, and in ten minutes more they both mounted the wagon and rode off to- gether, as friendly as if nothing had ever occurred, and in good humor with themselves and all the world. Now, such a scene could never have occurred with any other race of beings under the sun, and ended as it did. I have seen it stated recently that Professor Agassiz, after a long investigation and mature delib- eration, has discovered that a negro's skin is different from that of a white man. Why, I found that out long ago, and never half tried. Put a full-blooded negro and a genuine white man side by side, and I will pick out the negro the moment I see him, as easily as a Mississippi gambler will win your money at three- card monte, and I never studied him scientifically, either. I will stake my reputation as a philosopher against anything which the reader may be disposed to put up, that if he will trot Cuffee and the white man 5    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6867-00000044"/> round for ten or fifteen minutes, he may blindfold me so perfectly that I will not see a wink, and then walk the two by me, and if my nose is in any kind of order, I will put my finger on the "American gentleman of African descent" ninety-nine times in a hundred, and the other time too, which I throw in for good measure. Ethnologists may spin out their nonsense to amuse each other as much as they please, but any Southerner who requires a Professor Agassiz to teach him that Cuffee is not a white man in disguise, ought to be turned over to the Fejee Islanders for breakfast steaks. I hope the reader, if he has followed me thus far, will pardon this learned dissertation on the character- istics of our present sovereigns. As I am giving my experiences for the benefit of all whom they may con- cern, it seemed to me that they would be incomplete if I failed to tell how I profited by the events of the year previous on the labor question, and what the re- sults of my experiments were. And I will here iterate and reiterate my firm conviction that the only way under the sun to operate effectually upon the moral nature of the "nation's pets," is to arm the ministers of the gospel with stout cudgels, instead of bibles, for I am sure the cudgels will win their way in triumph, where invisible lakes of fire and burning brimstone wouldn't start a small-sized scare. Missionaries will please take notice, and govern themselves accordingly.   HS TRIBULATIONS.      87 CHAPTER IX. We Form  an Agricultural Society-I am Elected President-My Inaugural Address. My views about farming were decidedly of a pro- gressive character, and I was shocked every day by the old-fashioned notions of my neighbors. As a general thing, they opposed the use of new and im- proved implements; they subscribed to no agricul- tural journals; they did n't seem to appreciate the im- portance of manures, or an intelligent rotation of crops, and were rather disposed to think that "book- farming" was a humbug. I labored assiduously to remove these prejudices, and succeeded finally in per- suading quite a number to subscribe for some of the journals devoted to the advancement of agriculture. These were circulated extensively through the neigh- borhood, and it soon became apparent that more en- lightened views were grasping the minds of the people. I hailed this dawning revolution with exultation, and bathed my egotism in the sweet consciousness that I was a shining light among my brethren of the farm. My next move was to organize an agricultural club, and, with this view, I thoroughly canvassed the neigh- borhood for several miles, in every direction. The scheme met with general approbation, and the follow-    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6867-00000045"/> 88          BOAZ: ing Saturday was appointed as the day upon which all who were interested in the formation of the club should meet at the school-house and organize. The day dawned beautifully clear, and, at the ap- pointed hour, I repaired to the place of meeting. I was utterly astonished to see such a gathering of the hardy sons of toil. It seemed to be a general under- standing that the day of organization was to be a fete champetre, and every family in reach, including women, children and dogs, turned out en masse. As I viewed the scene, a glow of intense satisfaction pervaded my bosom. The old men were scattered in groups dis- cussing agricultural and political items of interest; the young men were engaged in that interesting pur- suit which all young men have followed since the world began, when there were ladies about; the dogs barked; the children cried; the old women scolded, and a high degree of enthusiasm seemed to be the prevailing sen- timent which actuated each group, and urged its mem- bers to a zealous performance of whatever it was en- gaged in. At the hour appointed for business, the meeting was reduced to as much order as it was possible to in- fuse into such an assembly, and the organization of the club began. On my motion, one of the most venera- ble farmers was called to the chair, and the school- master was appointed Secretary. A constitution and the by-laws, which I had already prepared, were then read and adopted, without any opposition, and the ut- most harmony prevailed until we came to the selection of a name, which I had left in blank in the constitu- tion. THE HOME AGRICULTURAL CLUB was pro- posed, but that was opposed by a member who thought   HS TRIBULATIONS.      89 horticulture ought to be embraced in the name. Another thought that the objects of the club ought not to be confined to agriculture and horticulture, but that the mechanical interests of the community ought to be taken under our protecting wings. A medical student thought that science ought not to be ignored, as it was the very basis of agricultural, horticultural and me- chanical advancement. At this stage of the proceed- ings, the schoolmaster rose, and said he had a few sug- gestions to make, which he hoped would meet with the universal approbation of his assembled fellow-citizens. He thought we should discard from our investigations the cramped name of club, and let our aspirations soar to the more elevated dignity of a society, which might embrace, in its infancy, the community in which it originated; in its youth, the county; and, in the ma- turity of its manhood, the State at large. He hoped, and expected to live to see the day when the eyes of the nation would be fixed upon our proceedings, and perhaps the fame of our investigations would yet be wafted, upon the wings of the breeze, to the classic shores of Europe. He, therefore, begged leave to pro- pose the name of THE COSMOPOLITAN, AGRICULTURAL, HORTICULTURAL, MECHANICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ASS- CIATION OF THE SONS OF TOIL. This name was re- ceived with tremendous applause, and adopted without a dissenting voice. We next proceeded to the election of permanent offi- cers, and, at the first ballot, I was chosen President of the Association by a large majority. I pretended to be very much astonished that their choice should have fallen upon me, but I wasn't. On the contrary, I should have been exceedinglydisappointed and hugely    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6867-00000046"/> YU          BOAZ: disgusted if any one else had been elected. I pre- tended, too, to think that some one of the old farmers should have been made President instead of me, but I really thought that I was the only one of the members who was capable of properly filling the position, and that the Association had wreathed itself with glory by its choice. Immediately after the election, I was duly inaugurated, and, on taking the chair, I rose with my characteristic dignity, and flung off the following speech: GENTLEMEN AND FELLOW-FARMERS--I regard this as the most momentous occasion which has ever oc- curred in the history of this community, and I am sure that I give but feeble expression to the emotions which crowd in overwhelming waves upon my bosom when I say that this is the proudest, as well as the 'happiest moment which has ever brightened my pathway with its glowing beams. I regret, gentlemen, that your choice did not fall upon some older and more experi- enced worshipper at the sacred shrine of agriculture, and I am at a loss for the reason why you should have elevated one who has had so many misfortunes to the dignity of this honorable position, unless it be upon that beautiful allopathic principle of contraria contra- ribus curantur. It is to me a source of no ordinary pride that you have not failed to appreciate my hum- ble efforts in the cause of scientific agriculture, and that your clear-sighted wisdom has penetrated the flimsy'veil of my apparent failures, and enabled you to discover that modest merit in your President which is often concealed from the eye of the casual observer, even as Golconda's treasured gems veil their glittering   HS TRIBULATIONS.       91 beams until they receive the finished polish of the cunning craftsman. Experimental science, gentlemen, is the skillful artificer which strikes the rough incrus- tations of inexperience from the farmer, and enables him to stand forth with the eyes of the world upon him, as I do to-day, and to lead his less enterprising brethren safely by the pitfalls of prejudice into the green fields, and by the still waters of productive wealth. Yes, gentlemen, I am-and I make the assertion with pride-one of those adventurous pio- neers who climb the dizzy heights of experimental agriculture, and, catching the first bright beams of im- provement, proclaim them to the world, as the watch- man on the snow-clad peaks of the cloud-crowned mountain catches the first golden rays of the rising sun, and awakes the sleeping world with the glad tidings that the morning breaketh. I am sorry to say-and the thought makes me blush for my race-that this is sometimes a thankless task, as when the agricultural prophet meets with accidents in his career, and, instead of sympathy, receives the jeers of an ungrateful world. But, ah! when the rich fruition of success finally crowns his unselfish efforts, how sweetly the plaudits of admiring hosts fall upon his ear, and bathe his soul in a sea of ecstatic bliss! Such is the joy which races, on this occasion, through my heart, like the wild courser of the Western plain, and I do not hesitate to say that the supreme beatitude which filled the soul of Jonah when, after his misfor- tune above and beneath the raging flood, he reached the magnificent halls of the Babylonian king; no, gen- tlemen, I do not hesitate to say that the grand sensa- tion of joy which thrilled the heart of the prophet    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6867-00000047"/> 92          BOAZ: when he saw the imperial monarch of the mightiest na- tion of antiquity, in obedience to his'curse, crawling on his all-fours, and biting short grass like a beast of the field, was feeble compared to the elevated emotions which flood my soul, by reason of the unexpected reward bestowed upon me in the Presidency of THE COSMOPOLITAN, AGRICULTURAL, HORTICULTURAL, MECHANICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION OF THE SONS OF TOIL. You have a glorious career before you, gentlemen, if you will cast off all clogging prejudices and march boldly forward to the bright goal of honor which gleams in the future. The subjects worthy of your consideration are immense, but I have time, in this brief inaugural address, to call your attention to but one. Labor is the great desideratum of the South. It is labor only that is wanted to develop her rich agri- cultural and mineral resources, and to make her the pride and glory of the world. But how are we to get it? We have tried in vain to turn the tide of foreign and Northern emigration to our shores, and we must therefore draw this much-needed labor from other sources. Can this be done? I say, gentlemen, can this be done? I do not hesitate to make the bold assertion that it can. The forests of South America abound in monkeys, which can be easily transported to our shores, and taught to gather the fleecy staple from our fields more nimbly than their African brothers, who now infest our legislative halls. Is there a man present who doubts this? If so, I point in triumph to the organ-grinders, who roam through our country with educated monkeys, taught to go round with the hat, and gather the harvest of nickels for their mas-   HS TRIBULATIONS. ,      93 ters. Why, then, may they not be taught to gather. the corn and cotton from our fields while our more in- telligent laborers delve in the rich mines which lie undeveloped around us? Iam particular in recom- mending the South American monkey, because he is the only one of his species which possess the prehensile tail, and he could soon be taught to hang by that ap- pendage while he uses all four of his paws in picking cotton. This is a virtue of such immense importance that it should not fail to receive your consideration, for it is thus apparent that he can be made to perform twice the work which has heretofore been done by his clumsy relatives from Africa. Here, gentlemen, is one of the grandest fields of in- vestigation which can possibly engage the attention of "  man. Let the Proctors soar among the stars, let the Tyndalls prate about the co-relation of forces, let the Drapers grope among the natural sciences, but let this Association import a cargo of monkeys, and train them to develop the resources of our country, and then, as our noble Secretary has said, the fame of our proceed- ings will be wafted, on the wings of the wind, to the classic shores of Europe, and generations yet unborn will honor the name of this Association through the roll of far-off ages. I was frequently cheered during the delivery of my inaugural, and when I closed, the applause was almost deafening. The men stamped like they had a contract to kick the floor through; the boys shouted "hurrah for Mr. Boaz," and the dogs barked as if they thought they ought to have something to say on the occasion. I thought it was beneath the dignity of my position to 5*    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6867-00000048"/> appear conscious of the applause, and I therefore treated the demonstration as a noisy outhreak, and peremptorily commanded order. I blandly inquired if any gentleman had anything of interest to present to the consideration of the Society, and our Secretary, the schoolmaster, then offered the following preamble and resolution: WHERmEs, The Agricultural and Mechanical State Fair will open at New Orleans in a few days, and it is of the utmost importance that all enter- prises of that character should receive the encourage- ment and fostering care of this Association; there- fore, be it Resolved, That our honored and illustrious President be appointed a committee to visit the said fair, and to make a report at the next regular meeting of the man- ner in which the fair aforesaid is conducted, and of such articles on exhibition as may be worthy of the consideration of this Association, and interesting to its members. A generous member moved to amend this resolution by adding that the committee be authorized to draw on the Treasurer for his necessary expenses, and, thus amended, it was passed without a dissenting voice. There being no further busines to transact, the Asso- ciation adjourned to the next regular meeting, and a bountiful dinner was then served beneath the shade of the neighboring trees. The afternoon was devoted to the enjoyment of such pleasures as are usual on rural gala days, and all went   "O A tslrULjATIjONS.    95 home in the evening delighted with the day's proceed- ings, and the more thoughtful highly edified by the learned and scientific suggestions of the President on agriculture, and especially his views in regard to the supply of labor for the development of the South.    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6867-00000049"/> 7U         mvS;AZ.* CHAPTER X. I Attend the State Fair, and Make a Report of my Investigations. IN the due course of human events I attended the State Fair, and, on my return, submitted the following report of my investigations: Gentlemen of THE COSMOPOLITAN, AGRICULTURAL, HORTICULTURAL, MECHANICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ASSO- CIATION OF THE SONS OF TOIL.-In obedience to your instructions, and inspired by that noble sense of duty, which every President ought to feel that he owes to the distinguished body over which he presides, I bade farewell to every fear on the 18th of the present month, and went forth to encounter those trials and dangers, which beset the pathway of the zealous student of the arts and sciences. Having placed my earthly tabernacle on board of the packet which plies between this port and New Orleans, I gayly skimmed the intervening waters, and, in due course of time, reached the Cres- cent City, whose growth and commerce I recommend to your favorable consideration. I was rather disappointed in not finding a delegation ,f the City Council on the wharf to receive and offer t ie hospitalities of the metropolis to your worthy-com-   HS TRIBULATIONS.       97 mittee, but this oversight was doubtless due to the fact that the Honorable Mayor and Aldermen had not re- ceived timely notice of my intended visit. The next morning after my arrival I took a car on Canal street, and started for the Fair Grounds. The car was crowded almost to suffocation, and I was among that unfortunate number who were just too late to get a seat. I soon became very much fatigued with stand- ing, and, at a venture, with my eyes intently fixed in the opposite direction, I gently lowered my personal basis until it reached a firm support. Meeting with no remonstrance, I twisted round a little to fix myself in as comfortable a position as possible, when a voice, evidently containing a strong infusion of pain, reached my ear, and informed me of the fact that I was durned sharp on the inferior apex. "I know it," said I, "but I do n't see why a gentle- man can't travel without being insulted by having the little infirmities, with which nature has seen fit to in- flict him, thrown in his teeth by everybody he meets." "I did n't mean to insult you, stranger," said the same voice, " but this is my lap you are settin' on, and I ain't aware that it's been hired out for this occa- sion." "There is just where you are mistaken," said I. "There was an ordinance passed last night, by the di- rectors of this road, which has been approved by the City Council, and' ordered to be enforced by General Emory, and which provides that every passenger in these cars is entitled to a seat wherever he can find it. If you will spread yourself allp ver the car in this way; you must expect people to sit on you, or get out and walk."    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6867-00000050"/> 98          BOAZ: "I beg your pardon," said he, "I did n't know that was the law." "Very well, I'll forgive you," I replied, "but, if you say anything more about my being sharp, I'1l re- port you to the police as soon as we reach the Fair Grounds for violating the regulations of the road." That settled his hash, and I never heard another complaint from him during the ride. How convenient it is, thought I, for a man to carry a little dignity about with him! Such harshness is foreign to my na- ture, but I considered that it was due to this Associa- tion that I should command respect for its President. We glided on smoothly for some distance, and then there was a sudden lurch, a jolt that made the man I was sitting on quiver in every nerve, and then an un- equivocal stop. The car had run off the track. As soon as the driver discovered the nature of the acci- dent, he very composedly folded his arms, and waited for the passengers to jump out and lift the car back again. "Hadn't we better get out," said my seat, "and help put this shebang on the track.". "Oh, no," said I, "don't trouble yourself. If we were to get out, some of the others might beat us back in the car and get our seats," and he never troubled himself any more. Many of the passengers, however, did take hold and soon had the wheels on the rails again, but, if it had n't been for me, I do not believe they would ever have done it. I always like to help on such occasions, and therefore I sat just as light as possible, and looked' as many of them as I could right in the eye, and every time they gave a heave, I mentally exclaimed with a ,        HS TRIBULATIONS.      99 great deal of nervous force, "Go it boys." It is a well-known fact, that a man of strong nervous temper- ament can exercise a powerful influence over others of weaker organizations, and I noticed that every time I said "go it boys," the car evidently moved toward its place. I do not suppose there was a man present who thought I assisted any, in fact one fellow had the im: pudence to look at me and say, "D-n a man that 'll set still and won't help." I felt a little indignant, es- pecially as I knew it was I who was doing most of the work, but he was a powerful man, stood over six feet in his shoes,- and I forgave him. I always was slow to anger, and of a very forgiving nature. We finally reached the Fair Grounds, and the scene that met the gaze was "grand, gloomy and peculiar." The first thing which attracted my attention was an exhibition of the BABCOCK FIRE EXTINGUISHER. The agent of this machine had erected a house, about twelve by fourteen feet in the open grounds, and filled it with old lard barrels. To intensify the interest of the experiment, he poured coal oil over the roof and sides of the building, and then applied the torch. An immense crowd had assembled to witness the ex- periment. There were just one million people, and a curious looking animal, somewhat larger than the chimpanzee, but not so intelligent in appearance, which sauntered around with a vacant stare on its phiz, and which I was credibly informed was Lieut. Gov. An- toine. If any one thinks I overstate the number pres- ent, I will give him the privilege of knocking off just as many as he pleases, provided he does not reduce it    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6867-00000051"/> 100         BOAZ: below nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand. I would rather the Association would take my statements as I make them, because I like to be exact, and always try to be accurate. I know the animal they called Antoine was there, and I am almost as sure the million people were there, for I counted twenty-five while they were firing the house, and then guessed at the remainder. I was always noted as an accurate guesser, but I may have made a mistake of one or two on this occasion, as I was a littled excited. The house was soon wrapped in drifts of lurid flame and smoke, which spread a ghastly glare over the sur- rounding multitude, who were so enchained by the scene that you could easily have heard a hundred pound mortar fired off in their midst. In the mean- time the directors of the machine played upon the flames with a jet of carbonic acid gas-o-water, but the flames flamed on, and I almost imagined I could hear them singing "Shoo fly, do n't bother me." The house soon caved in-in ten minutes more it was a mass of smoldering ruins-and, in the fullness of my innocence, I thought it was the worst extin- guished Fire Extinguisher I had ever seen, but I was soon convinced of my error. After the house had been fully consumed, a disagreeable smoke hung over the ruins and floated among the multitude. Then it was that the Fire Extinguisher displayed its beauty and power with wonderful effect. -The hose was turned upon the incandescent mass, the machine was set in rapid motion, and, in a little while, the smoke was all gone, and nothing was left but a mass of charcoal to   HS TRIBULATIONS.       101 tell where the house had been. I then remembered the disagreeable concomitants of being burned out. I recollected that a man does not care a fig about having his dwelling burned, his furniture destroyed, his vict- uals and clothes dissolved into their original elements, and his family turned adrift upon the cold charities of the world, provided he can get rid of the embers and stifling smoke that hang around loose after the fire is all over, so that he can go to picking up the nails im- mediately for future use. As soon as my attention was attracted to this view of the case, I saw at once that the Babcock Fire Extinguisher was a complete success. No machine that was ever invented could have per- formed its functions more beautifully and successfully, and I mentally sent up a stentorian shout to encourage the firemen in charge of the machine, I think I shall take a dozen or two home with me when I return. Some of the bystanders pronounced it a humbug, a miserable failure, etc., but they must have been of un- charitable natures and prone to fault finding, for there is no doubt that those embers would have smoked all day, and been a source of annoyance to the visitors, if it had not been that the machine squelched them com- pletely. It is true, the house burned up, but then the house was no consideration. It belonged to the agent of the machine, he had it built; he set it afire; and, if he chose to burn it up for the amusement of the crowd, it was no one's business but his own. These were the reflections, which passed through my mind, as I gazed upon the scene of the experiment, but a wonderful change "came o'er the spirit of my dream " a day or two after, at a second trial of the Fire Extinguisher. It seems that the apparent failure of ,     <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6867-00000052"/> 102         BOAZ: the machine, as above related, was a sort of April fool, a sham experiment gotten up for the purpose of dis- gusting the public, as much as possible, in order to make the real trial a more astonishing success, and the triumph more telling upon the beholder. Another house was therefore erected upon the ruins of the former one, was handsomely furnished with lard barrels,- was duly refreshed with a shower of coal oil, and the torch was again applied. The flames rose as if from an angry volcano on a rampage, and seemed determined to take that house in out of the wet, but the Fire Extin- guisher soon put in an appearance, and "played fami- liar with their hoary locke." Thus far, said the ma- chine, shalt thou go, and no farther; come out of that ye sneaks; back to your kennels ye hungry flames, and they backed right out as quickly as ever the devil did at the approach of holy water. The house was so completely protected that a gay party might have eaten their oysters and drank their champagne on the inside without the least interruption to their hilarious repast, though it was, at one time, wholly enveloped in a sheet of flame. The applauding shout that went up from the assembled multitude was tremendous and over- whelming. The agent of the machine was compelled to hold a levee on the spot, and receive the congratula- tions of his numerous admirers. So terrific was the handshaking that no human arm could have sustained it more than ten minutes, and the overpowered agent had finally to hold his used-up limb in his left hand, and offer the pump handle of the machine as a substi- tute to the throng, which continued to rush in. I have no hesitation in pronouncing the Babcock Fire Extin- guisher a decided success, and recommend this honor-   HS TRIBULATIONS.       103 able Association to endorse the machine in a neat re- solution of approval, expressing the high degree of satisfaction, which your committee derived from wit- nessing its recent trial at the Louisiana State Fair. Your Hon. Secretary should forward a copy of this resolution to Mr. Babcock, if he can ascertain where that gentleman resides, accompanied with a handsome letter encouraging him to persevere in his noble career, and notifying him that, if this Association of the Sons of Toil should ever need a Fire Extinguisher, they will communicate with him before purchasing else- where. It should ever be a distinguishing trait of this honorable Society to encourage meritorious genius wherever it appears, and, thus rewarded, we may con- fidently expect that a new impetus will be given to the inventive faculties of the age. After witnessing the trial of the Babcock Fire Ex- tinguisher, I continued my examination of the curios- ities, which were scattered profusely around, and my attention was attracted by an exceedingly liberal offer, which a gentleman in seedy habiliments was publicly making to any one who would take it. He was stand- ing by a small brass machine with a cushion on the end, resembling a cannon with a mop in the muzzle, firmly planted against a huge live oak tree. This ma- chine was called the How-hard-a-fellow-can-hit Indi- cator; and I thought was one of the most useful and beautiful pieces of mechanism, which the present age has produced. The cushion was fixed to a rod which worked something like a piston in the brass tube of the machine. The party experimenting would strike the cushion, and the depth to which he drove the piston would mark, by some mechanical arrangement, the    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6867-00000053"/> 104         BOAZ: power of the blow. The exhibitor of this beautiful agricultural implement was a sweet-tongued. youth, and, high above the hum of a thousand voices, rang his mellifluous tones, inviting the passing multitude to patronize the machine, and to reap the fortune which it held. "Walk up, gentlemen," said he, "and take your chance for the largest prizes which the world ever of- fered for so small a sum of money. Only five cents for a blow at that cushion, and you are sure to learn how hard you can strike, and I will give, in addition, one hundred thousand dollars to any man who knocks the tree down, fifty thousand if he splits it, and twen- ty-five thousand if he knocks the cushion through the machine; all going for five cents only. Walk up, gentlemen! walk up! while you have this glorious opportunity to pluck the jeweled tiara from the brow of chance. Shakspeare says there is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at its flood, leads on to fortune. Here is the tide, just at its flood, and, if any man goes away without a pocket full of greenbacks, he has him- self only to blame. One hundred thousand dollars for onlyfive cents! O ye wicked and adulterous generation, ye seeketh after a fortune, and here it is, if you will only step up and pluck it. Why, gentlemen, you are buried in old fogyism. You do n't bite at the im- provements of the age like they do in Texas. I coined the greenbacks out there, and I'll tell you how I did it. I bought me a white cravat, and went to preach- ing, and, while I amused the women and children with a sermon, the men played poker in the little room behind the pulpit, and every winner on a hand, higher than two pair, divided the pot with the parson. I al-   HS TRIBULATIONS.      105 ways had crowded houses, and my salary was im- mense." Your committee was so shocked by this levity of the agent, that I turned away, but I was struck with the importance and utility of his machine, and felt that no plantation nor household should be without one. The farmer could easily arrange it in the rear of his kicking mules, and could thus measure exactly the dynamic force of any given kick. He would thereby be enabled to determine what would have been the consequence, if he had been in the way, and would thus learn whether, or not, it is important to keep out of the way of a mule's heels, and, if so, how important. It would be particularly useful in one's household to practice on, when he gets in a fury. Instead of break- ing his knuckles against some offending head, he could march up to the machine and plug away until he is satisfied that the head aforesaid would be sufficiently punished, if his blows had fallen upon it, instead of the machine. And whenever his better half gets her angry passions up, he could lead her to the beautiful implement, and gently say, "peg away old woman- until you feel better," and I am sure a few rounds would remove the clouds from her brow, and restore the rippling smiles to her lips. The machine could, doubtless, be put to many other valuable purposes, but these are all I can think of at present. There is no telling, however, how useful it might be made until one gets the implement, and reasons about the thing. Your committee was so pleased with the machine that I tried to purchase it for the use of the Sons of Toil, but the agent refused to sell the one he had on exhibi- tion. I, however, gave him an order for one to be    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6867-00000054"/> 106         BOAZ: shipped on the boat upon which I returned, and, as the agent refused to receive any order unaccompanied with the cash, I paid him the purchase price, say $250 00, for which I have his receipt. I am sorry to say, that the machine was not shipped according to contract, but I hope the Association will not hesitate to refund the money which I expended for their benefit. I was afraid to try the muscular power of my fist upon the machine, because I was not posted in the price of live oak trees, as large as the one against which the machine rested, and my usual caution taught me to fear that the owner of the soil might charge me more for the tree than the $100,000 I would win by knock- ing it down. I then passed on to the next article of interest, which was one of the most wonderful and ingenious * contrivances of the century, for the advancement of the agricultural interests of the country. This invention comprised a brace of effigies of the " human form divine," representing both the male and the female sex. They stood erect about five feet apart, and near by was a pile of hickory sticks two feet long. The modus operandi was simple, but beautiful in the extreme. You deposit five cents with the agent, he gives you three sticks; you step off ten yards, and then you throw those sticks at either of the effigies which your fancy may select. If you are a married man, you will, of course, think of your mother-in-law, and go for the female. If you are unmarried, the male effigy will personify your rival, and you will try to knock him over the other side of Jordan. If you strike the effigy, at which you aim, your money is refunded. If you miss, it remains with the exhibitor, not as a reward to him for the ex-   HS TRIBULATIONS.       107 hibition, but as a punishment to you for not haviny cultivated the important accomplishment of throwing well. No argument is necessary to convince the farmer how useful such an arrangement is, in bringing up a family. He will, at once, remember how hugely ag- gravating is a rooting pig among his potatoes, or a scratching hen in his garden; and how easily a well- directed rock will persuade either to return to the paths of rectitude. He will doubtless remember his own and certainly his wife's ineffectual efforts to aim that well-directed rock, and his own soul will gush out in gratitude to the genius who invented such a glorious con- trivance to teach the young idea how to throw. I would therefore urge upon every member of this Association the necessity of obtaining one of these artistic inven- tions at the earliest possible moment, for the purpose of making his rising family adepts in the splendid art of hurling a rock. To a father of a large family, a well-practiced hand would be of incalculable value.

Impressed with these views, I determined at once to order a complete set for every married member of this Association, and, for this purpose, I touched the exhibitor on the shoulder, and asked for a private interview. He left the works in charge of an assistant, and followed me behind his tent. Taking out my pencil and note book, I ad- dressed him in the politest manner imaginable. !"My dear fellow," said I, "I am particularly struck with the beautiful invention which you have on exhibi- tion, and I shall be under many obligations if you will in- form me who the inventor is; whether or not it is patented; who is the manufacturer; where the manu- factory is situated, and what is the price per set. I make these inquiries because I am the President of an Agricultural Association, and I desire to order forty or fifty sets for the use of the members." To my utter surprise, he simply said, "If none of your Association has any more brains than the Presi- dent, the fool-killer has n't done his duty up your way," and, turning on his heels, he left me. I thought it was due to my official dignity, as your President, not to resent this insult, as I should have done had the party who gave it been my equal in posi- tion, in weight and in size, and I therefore let him go with marked contempt. Manufacturers, in sending out their wares, ought to provide politer and more accommodating agents, and it would become this Asso- ciation to pass a resolution immediately, expressing in the strongest terms its condemnation of the remark made by the exhibitor as above stated, and declaring its profoundest intention to patronize no establishment   HS TRIBULATIONS.       109 which manifests such a criminal indifference to the feelings of the public. Having become very much exhausted by my severe investigations in the open air, I deemed it absolutely essential that I should strengthen the tottering beams of my earthly tabernacle with a refreshing cordial of some kind, and I therefore ventured to imbibe a bottle of champagne, the bill for which was duly made out against this Association, and will be filed in the ar- chives of the Treasurer's office. I then entered a large building, which seemed to be an omniumn gatherum of fancy articles of every imaginable description. Among these was a display which I shall remember as long as I am permitted to linger in this " vale of tears." It flashed upon my view Like a morning in Paradise, Through the palms of an orient hill, and, had there been nothing else on exhibition, I should have felt amply compensated for my visit to the Fair. Language can not express the Niagara of emotions which poured through my heart when I found myself in the presence of the most magnificent collec- tion of TAPEWORMS the world ever saw. My first overwhelming thought was of the stupendous littleness of man compared with this magnificent collection of wondrous reptilian life. In contemplating the glory and splendor of the heavens, a dim consciousness has sometimes crept over me that I was a-little lower than the angels, but there, in the presence of those omniverous monsters, I felt myself every moment growing "small by degrees, and  beautifully less," until 6    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6867-00000056"/> "O          BOAZ:  I seemed too low To claim kindred with the humblest flower.

Yes, gentlemen; your Committee wept, and I am not ashamed to own it. It is said that, when the bird of victory had perched upon the standard of Britain, Napoleon surrendered his bosom to the soft palpita- tions of grief, and sprinkled the field of the slain with a hero's tears; that Cicero, the prince of Roman elo- quence, fired with the glowing raptures of enthusiasm by the splendid intellectual achievements which had crowned the labors of Archimedes, wandered through brushwood and bramble in search of the grave of that giant martyr of science, and shed tears of ecstacy over his tomb; that Thomas Moore, the sweet-tongued hero of Erin's Isle, having climbed the towering heights of an Alpine peak, was so overcome by the magnificent view of the world beneath him that tears gushed from his eyes, and flowed in profusion down his manly cheeks; and Shelly, one of the brightest gems in England's diadem of poets, says: I do remember well the hour which burst My spirit's sleep; a fresh May-dawn it was, When I walked forth upon the glittering grass, And wept-I knew not why. With such archetypes before me, I do not blush to acknowledge that I wept in presence of those TAPE- WORMS, but I am at a loss to determine whether mine were heroic tears like Napoleon's, ecstatic tears like Cicero's, or poetic tears, like those of Moore and Shelly.

I removed my hat, and solemnly approached that weird shrine. The presiding high priest, seeing my emotion, evidently sympathized with my feelings. He preserved that dignified silence characteristic of a ten- der soul, and, handing me a caid, gracefully waived his hand in invitation to advance and examine his collections. I raised the card, and through the mists which lingered about my eyelids, I read: JEAN LOUIS D'ESTRANGE'd INFALLIBLE TAPEWORM EXTERMNATOR, AT SHORT NOTICE. Without any Pain Whatsoever. I drew my handkerchief, wiped my eyes, blew my nose, and advanced to the tiers of bottled worms which towered grandly up before me. There was one group which was so conspicuously arranged as to catch my eye at the first glance. This was a beautiful cluster of four, each in a separate bottle. The bottles were gracefully looped together with a handsome card, and over the group was a decorated card, which bore this inscription: THESE FOUR WERE REMOVED FROM A LADY in the City, IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME.    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6867-00000057"/> "2         BOAZ: I was at a loss to discover what peculiar merit at- tached to the group from the fact that they formerly sport6d in the female, instead of the male stomach, and that the organ was not of plebian origin, but per- formed its functions for a lady. I made no inquiries calculated to elucidate these interesting questions, but I did ask him what was the length of the longest speci- men in his valuable collection. "I think," said he, "that I have the longest sub- ject of which there is any record. He is a male, and is just two hundred and fifty-seven yards, two feet, four and three-quarter inches in length. His biogra- phy will form an interesting addition to natural his- tory. Numerous attempts had been made to capture him, but his ferocious disposition baffled every effort. I was invited to interview his majesty, and in just five days, four hours and forty seconds he yielded to my persuasive influence, and was enthroned in a demi- john among my numerous other specimens." Your Committee was anxious to bring yourHonora- ble Association into notice, and I therefore said: "You have quite a respectable worm; indeed, I may say, a very respectable worm. I am an amateur sportsman in that line myself, and I bagged one some time ago which is a little longer than yours. I have repeatedly measured him with the utmost care, and he is precisely two hundred and fifty-eight yards long. I captured him after a chase of just one hour, and he is now in the museum of THE COSMOPOLITAN, AGRICUL- TURAL, HORTICULTURAL, MECHANICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION OF THE SONS OF Tom, of which I am the worthy President."

"It was in the simplest, and most reasonable manner in the world," said I, "I made the gentleman, who was - infested with the monster,. swallow a full account of the shameful manner in which the Louisiana State government has been conducted since the war. The WORM had a literary turn of mind, and was so hugely disgusted with the nauseous administration that he de- termined to leave the State, and immediately made for the Rocky Mountains. I succeeded in capturing him, and endeavored to preserve him alive, but he was so ladened with sorrow at being forced to pass the re- mainder of his days under the carpet-bag government of Louisiana that he died of a broken heart in less than a week." I trust that this Association will pardon its Com- mittee for making the above romantic statement, but, as it is yet in its infancy, I did not think I could ad- vance its interest in a more satisfactory manner than by proclaiming that it was in possession of a museum, composed of the most magnificent TAPEWORM which the world ever produced. I regard this subject of tapeworms as of the most momentous importance to the agricultural interests of the country, and I therefore most especially invite your attention to a due consideration of the subject. It is of the utmost importance to the farmer that he should reduce his home consumption to the lowest limit, which is consonant with the comfort of his family, both in order that he may have a greater quantity of home productions to dispose of,and that he may have a less quantity of foreign productions to purchase.

A table of this character will be of incalculable im- portance, and I fondly trust that I shall live to see the day, when, under the auspices of this Association, a copy of that table will be neatly framed, and hung in the kitchen of every farmer in the land, as a warning that a tapeworm in a family is an expensive luxury in which no tiller of the soil should indulge. Your Committee found some articles on exhibition such as plows, harrows, steam engines, saw mills, etc., but as I do not consider them of any special import- ance, I will here close this interesting report.

A Few Thoughts on Whistling-Misfortunes of an Equine Nature. DURING the formation and existence of the Associa- tion of the Sons of Toil, my agricultural operations went on in the most satisfactory manner. Having employed my laborers by the month, as ex- plained in a former chapter, I occupied every spare moment in gathering manure, and accumulated quite a handsome store for distributing among my various crops. My idea was not to plant mor6 than, I could thoroughly cultivate, and, in accordance with this view, I arranged all my plans as the prudent general prepares for his approaching campaign. I plowed deep, thoroughly pulverized the soil, and fertilized freely. The consequence was that my crops got a vigorous start, and grew rapidly. At one time we had a great deal of rain, but my fields were well ditched, and the water did not remain upon the land. As I had not overcropped myself I had no difficulty in keeping down the grass, and while many of my neigh- bors were struggling with that pest of .the farmer, I was riding triumphantly over the defeated foe. Their crops, therefore, were naturally stunted, while the growth of mine was never checked. Some who proph-   HS TRIBULATIONS.       117 esied that I would never make any thing at farming, unless I planted more to the hand, felt the wisdom of my plan, and acknowledged that, as a general rule, my idea was correct. The splendid condition of my crop, and the consciousness that I was rising in the es- timation of my brethren of the farm, made me "as happy as -t!, days are long." My soul was full of music as a strolling hand-organ, and found a vent for its harmonies through my labial ornaments, which were everlastingly puckered for a whistle. Some poet -Dryden, I believe-tells of a youth, who Whistled, as he went, for want of thought. My symphonies, however, did not originate in a 4   dearth of thought, for my brain was as busy as a whole hive of bees all the time, but in the luxuriant exuber- ance of a joyful spirit. In the course of time I imag- ined that I had acquired no little skill in the art, and that my performances were worthy of a reputation which " the world would not willingly let die." Strange to say, however, an embryotic suspicion was sometimes forced on me that my concerts were a nuisance, though I always did my best to make them perfectly agreeable. The baby, for instance, did n't seem to appreciate them, and frequently, when sleeping the sleep of the inno- cent, instead of letting its little soul float away to angelic realms on " the concord of sweet sounds," it would wake up, and cry like all wrath, as if it were scared, and then Mary would take it up, and cooingly say: "Da, da, den, did it's old papa's noise wake ze 'ittle darlin' up? Ze ole papa's always a whistlin' in ze 6*    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6867-00000060"/> "8         3BOAZ: housey when ze baby wants to seepy in its 'ittle c'adle. Yes, ze ugly ole papa mus' do away wiz his noise." The little wretch seemed to understand all that per- fectly well, and would look at me with all the venom of outraged innocence. Then, again, when I would sometimes try my mouth on "Hear me, Norma," or somq other opera, in the midst of my most fascinating quavers, and demi-semi-quavers, I would, perhaps, be interrupted by my wife, who would mildly entreat me not to whistle in the house, as the noise was not pleas- ant to her. Of course I always dried up on such oc- casions, but I could n't stifle the rising regret that my wife and child had no music in their souls. I did n't exactly think they were fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils, simply because I believed they were exceptions to the rule, and not that the rule was founded on mis- conception. I always thought Shakspeare knew a thing or two when he invented that axiom about the man who has no music in his soul, and I think so still. It was just such a treasonable wretch, who advised a lawless mob not to waste a miserable vagrant they werd going to drown, but to kill a fiddler with him, and rll wager a nickel against anybody's twenty dollar gold piece, that nine times out of ten the man who snubs the whistling soul, would Pour the sour milk of discord into heaven, Uproar the universal peace, confound All unity on earth, and fight Against his cankered country with the spleen Of all the under fiends. Did any one ever see a mouth puckered for a whistle that would not break into a smile, as genial as the   HS TRIBULATIONS.    -  119 summer morn, on the slightest pretence? Did any one ever know a sour tempered man who could successfully toot any kind of a tune on his lips, or who ever culti- vated the divine art at all? I do not now remember L1    that I ever made the personal acquaintance of Cassius, or of Falstaff, but I would risk a fortune on a bet that the Roman conspirator was never known to whistle, while the jolly companion of Prince Hal never took a stroll through the green fields that his good humor did not bubble up and flow off in as merry a tune as ever waked the echoes of a smiling morn. It is es- sentially a rural bliss. The stuck-up city gent, with his starched shirt on, can't turn his mouth loose in a real, soul-full whistle, that seems to well up from the very depths of the soul, and float aloft like the lark, that, Soaring ever singeth, and singing still doth soar. He may get off a dwarfed imitation sometimes, but a real, healthful, bona fide, rousing, soul-stirrihg whistle-never. It is only the untrammeled soul of the thoroughbred ruralist that can do such a thing, and the fact stamps him as one of nature's unfettered noblemen, whose lips are the index to a soul at peace with himself and all the world. The poets appreciate this mark of rural independence, and their songs gleam with illustrations. Pope says: The wild winds whistle while the billows roar, and Gay tells how The weary plowman leaves the task of day, And trudging homeward, whistles on the way.    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6867-00000061"/> 120         BOAZ: I believe in whistling, and feel sorry for the prig whose little soul can't rise to a proper appreciation of the art. Some daintily fastidious disciples of fashion condemn whistling as vulgar, but I am at war with any principle of so-called good manners that would debar the farmer, who " dallies with the wind and courts the sunshine," from whistling to his heart's full content, but he should be careful to remember "not to be caught napping," "to keep his eyes skinned," and never, no, never, Pay too dear for his whistle. The farmer who can't get up a healthy whistle is sure to be sick, or has some trouble brewing in his bosom. I know this from experience. My labial music began to fade in the early summer, and died away until my lips could no more pucker for a tune than a wet dish rag could dance a polka. Did you ever try to imagine how the Peri felt when she joyfully sailed up to heaven, with the martyr's blood, to get her in, When she could see the starry bowls That lie around that lucid lake, Upon whose banks admitted souls Their first sweet draft of glory take, and was told that her ticket would n't pass her? I have an idea that, as the gates closed against her, she could n't have gotten off even as solemn a tune as "Old Hundred." I felt that way, I know, after I had been put through my course of troubles in horse flesh. I had treated myself and family to a buggy horse. He was one of the handsomest animals I ever saw, and   HS TRIBULATIONS.       121 as gentle as a lamb. My wife and children doted on that horse, and well they might, for nobody's wife and children, in all the surrounding country, could boast such a turnout on Sundays and gala days-occasions' when women and children love to cut a dash. I gen- erally swelled a little myself when driving through town, or by a crowd, and enjoyed a pleasing conscious- ness that I was an object of envy, or at least that I ought to be. Early one morning, my hostler announced that my horse was missing. He had been left in the pasture the night before. The gates were all shut, the fence was up, and our immediate conclusion was that he had been stolen. I therefore sent a messenger out on every road, and, to make the search as thorough as possible, I scoured the whole country myself for several days, but all in vain. I could get no news of my horse in any direction, and was finally forced to believe that he was gone to me and' my heirs forever. During all those anxious days of search, my lips never puckered once for a whistle, for my soul was exceeding sorrow- ful. About the fourth evening after the disappear- ance of my horse, I noticed a soiree of buzzards in the pasture, and, having some curiosity to know what their bill of fare was, I concluded to attend the party, and there I. found my horse. There was a shallow pit in one corner of the fence, entirely concealed by high weeds, and in it my beautiful dapple-gray slept the sleep that knows no waking. j    O Death, all eloquent! you only prove What dust we dote on, when it 's a horse we love.

Mary declared she must have a horse, so I bought another. I had had him about a month when a Metho- dist minister, riding his circuit, spent the night with me. He had an appointment for the next morning in rather an out-of-the-way place, some miles distant, and as he desired to give his horse a little rest, he asked for mine to ride over to his church. I loaned him tne horse, and about one o'clock I saw him marching home- ward on foot, with his bridle in his hand and his sad- dle on his back. "Halloo, parson," said I, laughing, "Selim gave you the slip while you were preaching, did he?" "Ah, no, my brother, I wish he had. He is down there in the woods, and any child can catch him." "Why did n't you catch him, then?"I asked. A tear slowly gathered in his eye, as he sadly in- formed me that my horse had fallen through a bridge and broken his leg. My laugh at the parson's plight took an apoplectic fit, and died instanter, without a struggle. I went out to the scene of disaster, and there was my poor horse quivering with pain. His leg was shattered from the knee down to the hock, and I saw at once that his case was beyond the reach of my veterinary skill. A pistol ball ended his troubles, and I wended my way homeward almost as sad as Dido was when ,Eneas sailed away and left her "in the low grounds of sin and sorrow." I do not now remember all the minor details connected with my misfortune, but, if my memory serves me rightly, I was not so crowded with grief as to commit suicide, as I believe Dido did, or, if she did n't, she died somehow or other,   HS TRIBULATIONS.       123 as we are led to believe by the fact that none of our modern tourists, who do up foreign lands, mention her as one of the reigning sovereigns who invited them to her court, congratulated them on being citizens of the Great Western Republic, and inquired about the glory and prosperity of their country. Shakspeare, or somebody else-probably somebody. else-says it is useless to cry over spilt milk, so "I wiped my weeping eyes," and bought another horse. My family splurged around about two weeks with him, and then " he shuffled off his mortal coil," and "was gathered to his fathers." Let not the plebian rabble Mock my Toby, thus laid low, 'T was no foeman's arm that felled him, 4       I'T was the colic struck the blow. It seemed to me that the fates were against me, and that it was foreordained that I should not remain the happy owner of a good buggy horse. I concluded, however, tO invest one more time, and bought a beau- tiful mare. She was, for a time, the pet of the family, but she went stone blind in a very short time, and I sold her for just one-fourth of her original cost, and thought that, at least, was one good bargain I might in the future boast of having made. I suspected that her eyes were not sound when I bought her, and called the drover's attention to the fact, but he said that was nothing. She had struck her head against the stable door, some time before, and hurt her eyes. She was then nearly well, and would be as sound as ever in a few days. I knew no better, so I went in and got skinned.    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6867-00000063"/> 124         BOAZ: After this misfortune I almost vowed that I would never invest another dollar in horse flesh, but it seemed so utterly impossible to live in the country, with any degree of comfort, without a horse for my family, that I soon began to look around for a bargain. I was not long in finding an opportunity to put my foot in it again, and to illustrate the truth of the maxim that history repeats itself, though in my case the repetitions came rather rapidly for my personal comfort. Such a succession of equine misfortunes hardly seems probable, but I am not borrowing facts from imagination. I rode into town one evening, and found a peddler, who was offering a good looking horse for sale, and I thought very cheap. He had sold all his goods, he said. He wanted to go away, and would dispose of his horse at a sacrifice, rather than incur the expense of carrying him off. I bought the horse at once, and took him home. The next morning my hostler announced that my new purchase had the distemper. I went out to look at him, and, sure enough, his nose looked like a perennial fountain of-what usually flows from that organ on such occasions. At the time of my purchase nothing of the kind was apparent, and I am satisfied the rascally peddler had carefully washed out the horse's nose, and wiped it clean, for the purpose of imposing on some unfortunate fellow who had n't cut his eye-teeth. I treated him with all the most ap- proved remedies, but he got no better. On the contrary, he seemed to grow worse, and the disease soon ex- tended to my mules. I finally asked an old farmer, who was noted for his veterinary knowledge, to ride over and look at my horse. He did so, and immedi- ately pronounced it a case of glanders, for which he   HS TRIBULATIONS.       125 knew no remedy. Ten minutes afterward my horse and several mules were led to the woods and shot. I changed my lot, and 'resorted to every precaution to prevent the disease from spreading, but I lost fully one half of my mules before I got entirely rid of it. I have never been partial to peddlers since. I always did regard them as the "yaller dogs" of the human race, that prowled around the outskirts of society and gobbled up the greenhorns that fell like crumbs in their way, and after that horse trade, they sank even below the respectability of the "yaller dog," in my estima- tion. Every time I think of that sweet-scented scoundrel I pray that All the infections that the sun sucks up, From bogs, fens, flats, may on him fall, and make him, By inch-meal, a case of glanders. I vowed a vow, and, like the love-struck poet, I wanted "to snatch a giant pine from Norway's forest, and dipping it in the burning crater of Vesuvius, write with this flame-dripping pen" my wrath across that peddler's back. Fate has never thrown him in my way since, but my vow is registered, and, if that happy day should ever come, I'1l - , well, I'll not record any more evidence against myself, in case a, stray peddler should be found in my neighborhood with his scalp gone and his tongue nailed to a tree, to show him in a mild way that he must n't do it again. The reader can well imagine that during all these equinal troubles I never whistled once. My soul was as free of music as Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy is of wit.

Dark, Plutonian shadows gathered around me, and sorrow brooded over me like a thick overhanging cloud. My soul sought communion only with kindred sufferers, and my mind roamed through the whole range of my reading in search of companions in sorrow. Far down the dim vistas of the past I imagined I could 'see King John, and could hear his melancholy wail: I am not mad; I would to heaven I were! For then 't is like I should forget myself; O, if I could, what grief should I forget!"

Aut regern autfatuum nasci oportuit, is an old Latin adage, and means that a man ought to be born either a king or a fool. It is likely that nature was struck with the wisdom of the remark, and afterward gov- erned herself accordingly, but if there was any king in mine, I had not, up to that time, discovered the fact. I was almost persuaded, therefore, that my mother-in-law was right, and that I fell into ranks un- der the flag that waved at the other end of the adage, just as naturally as a'tadpole turns to a frog. I thought, however, it was a hard case that I had not been born such an undivided, undiminished, unmitigated, full and perfect fool, as not to be able to see and feel my misfortunes; or in other words, that I had not been born one of those blessed idiots who thinks he ought not to swim ashore if he falls overboard, because every thing happens for the best. We have another axiom which was invented in the days of the Coesars, or thereabouts, and which tells us, Quos Deus vult perdere, prius dementat: Whom God wishes to destroy he first makes mad.

It seemed to me that some malignant fatality attended my footsteps like an evil spirit, that was determined to lead me on to ruin. I carefully reviewed my losses for the purpose of dis- covering whether they were attributable to mismanage- ment, to a general unfitness for agricultural pursuits, or to a series of unavoidable misfortunes, which might occur to any one. I easily persuaded myself that they were properly indexed in the catalogue of unavoidable misfortunes, and that doubtless many a farmer before me had undergone similar experiences. What pru- dence could have prevented my noble gray from falling into a concealed pit, which I did not know existed? Could I, without stamping myself as an inhospitable, unaccommodating churl, refuse to lend a minister of the gospel a horse, for the purpose of carrying out his holy mission? And, having lent him, how was it pos- sible that any care of mine could have avoided the accident which occurred to him? If any farmer ever lived who had not at times lost a horse by colic, I had never heard of the lucky individual. If I had been a veterinary surgeon I might have guarded against the    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6867-00000066"/> 130          BOAZ: purchase of the mare with defective eyes-and here I made a note that I must improve myself in that branch of science-but that misfortune was hardly owing even to a want of experience, because I trusted to the good faith of the man I bought from. I could not see how I was to blame for the purchase of the glandered horse, and the consequent loss, for I was sure that every trace of the disease had been carefully concealed by the peddler, as previously explained. The distemper is not considered a dangerous disease, and, in its early stages, is scarcely distinguishable from the glanders, so I could not see how I had erred in not resorting to very extraordinary care to prevent its spread among my mules. I persuaded myself that such a train of disasters was not likely to occur again in one's life time, so I marshalled my resources to repair the inju- ries with a modicum of the hope and confidence that braced the spirits of Ezra as he called the scattered Hebrews out of Babylon to rebuild the ruined walls of Jerusalem. I found it was absolutely necessary that I should replace my lost mules; and yet I dreaded to do so, lest the future should still hold in store for me some new ill that horse flesh is sometimes heir to. Shakspeare, with extraordinary meekness and hu- mility, says: "What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculties! In form #nd moving how express and admirable! In action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a god!" He should have added when viewed at long taw, I never knew a specimen of the gemis homo with whom you could live in close quarters and remain under the blissful delusion that all those splendid elements were mixed in him.   HS TRIBULATIONS.      131 As a general rule, man is a glorious fellow. One's brother man is the best institution I ever knew to get on a bender with-when he treats-or to borrow money of when he thinks he sees a good thing in it, and you i    know he does n't; but I have never found one yet that filled Shakspeare's bill. If you ever do, pass him along-he is the very fellow Diogenes was hunting for a few years ago. The immortal William himself was something like it, but he had an ungodlike fondness for venison. Alexander the Great and Noah might have sat for the picture, but you could n't say of them, "in action, how like an angel!" when lying around loose with their shirts full of Robertson county whiskey. David would n't do, because he peeped at Mrs. Uriah on a memorable occasion, when he should n't have done it, and thereby fell into evil ways. If Shakspeare meant me when he drew the picture- and I suppose he did-my next move in my farming operations would have changed his opinion, if he had only lived to see it. It seemed to me thatI got picked up at every turn, as naturally as the industrious worm falls into the clutches of the early bird. . I do n't blame any one for my next mistake except myself. I see now that it was entirely the result of that little weakness in my mind, which my mother-in-law so often told me about, but which I did not at that time reckon in the general summary of my character. Nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit, and, in one of these unfortunate hours, my evil genius sent me a visitor, whom I have always thought was a special emissary of his Satanic Majesty, and was thrown in my way to hasten my undoing. He came as a weary traveler, seeking a night's lodg- !    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6867-00000067"/> 132         BOAZ: ing. I took him in. He had roamed, it seemed, in many climes, and charmed me with descriptions of what he had seen in foreign lands. He discoursed largely of the systems of agriculture throughout the world, and, in the course of the evening, he said it was strange that the farmers of the South had never intro- duced the camel for the purposes of the farm. His experience with that animal in the East convinced him that it was admirably adapted to such uses, and he had no doubt that the day would come when the camel would be as common in Louisiana as in Arabia. His remarkable endurance, and the ease with which he was kept, were recommendations which no other animal possessed. "I have always understood," said I, " that he can not be used in the wagon or plow." "That is a very great mistake, and must be the opinion of those only who know nothing about the animal. In his native country, wagons are almost un- known, and writers imagine that he is unfit for that purpose because he is not so used in the East, when the real reason is that the inhabitants of those coun- tries scarcely know the use of the wagon. I have my- self seen him in the plow, and was well pleased with his performances. His great size and strength would enable him to do the work 5f two horses, and, in addi- tion to this, his long wool surpasses in silky smooth- ness the finest flannel, and would be a source of hand- some profit to the owner of a herd. I assure you, sir, that the man who demonstrates to the people of the South the value of the camel as a farm animal, will confer an inestimable boon upon his country, and his name will be handed down to posterity as one of the   HS TRIBULATIONS.      133 brightest in that noble cluster of benefactors whose genius has developed the agricultural resources of the nation." I retired that night with camel on the brain. I was all aglow with the idea of being one of the pioneers in this praiseworthy enterprise, and, taking a bird's-eye view of futurity, I saw the name of Boaz inscribed in blazing letters on the roll of honored agriculturists, and heard paeans in his praise floating up from coming generations. I remembered that, in 1858 or 1859, there was a bill before Congress to encourage the im- portation of camels to the Southern States, and that fact strengthened the impression made by my guest. I was ripe for the enterprise. O, the unconscionable ass that I was! In addition to the gloryI would reap, a pair of camels would, I thought, be equal to four mules at least, and would enable me to go on swim- mingly with my farming operations, but how was I to get them? I thought I would try an advertisementin a New Orleans paper, and found that fate had made my road to folly as plain as a certain broad and straight way which leads to a place of considerable notoriety, but which I hope never to reach. A bankrupt pro- prietor of a menagerie had a pair he was trying to dis- pose of, and forthwith communicated the fact to me. I kept my secret as tenderly as a miser hoards his gold. I told my wife I was going to New Orleans to renew my supply of mules, and then I went for the menagerie man. Of course he represented that I had not been told the half of what the camel would do as a work animal, and lauded my enterprising spirit in glowing terms. I closed the purchase at once, lest some one else should discover my secret and get ahead of me. 7    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6867-00000068"/> The boat on which I shipped myself and camels reached my landing late in the night, and, as the house yard was the most convenient enclosure at hand, I drove them in there until morning. I said nothing to my wife about the prize I had secured, and was full of exultation over the surprise that would take her all in. a heap the next morning on discovering that we were the real, bona fide owners of those noble pilgrims from the East. Full of this thought, I retired to rest, and was just falling into a gentle slumber when a most unearthly scream rose from the next room, and floated through the house like the wail of a lost soul suddenly caught up and hurled into the bottomless pit. The camels flashed upon my mind at once, and I bounced out of bed, and rushing into the next room, found my mother- in-law in a dead faint, as pale as her sallow complexion could become. The usual restoratives brought her round in due course of time, but her countenance was as veritable a picture of horror as I ever saw. "O Lord!" said she; "where am I? Is this really Boaz and Mary?" "Yes, mother," said I; " but what is the matter?"  She made no answer, but jumped out of bed, and, falling on her knees, crossed her hands upon her bosom, and, confessing that she was a guilty sinner, prayed earnestly for forgiveness. Mary and I looked on all the while in utter aston- ishment, wholly unable to account for her conduct. Having finished her prayer, she kissed me affection- ately, and asked my forgiveness for every unkind word she had ever said to me, and declared that if the Lord   HtS TRIBULATIONS.      135 would only spare her, her future conduct should atone for the past. "Why, mother," said Mary, "' what is the matter? What in the world has happened?" "I had a warning, Mary." "A warning!" "-Yes. I was lying here, as wide awake as I ever was in my life, and I saw the devil come in at that window. I was afraid he had come for me, Mary, and was so frightened that I screamed with all my might, for I thought I was gone. I never expected to see you all again. I have tried to be a Christian, but I must have had too much of the world in my heart. O! if the Lord will only forgive me, I will try to lead a bet- -ter life hereafter."  A light began to dawn upon my mind. A tub of waterwas sitting by the window, which was open, and I found a few hairs on the window-sill. I knew then that what my mother-in-law had taken for his Satanic Majesty was one of the camels which had poked his head in to drink, but I said nothing, for I was sure there would be a row when the truth came out. It was the first time she had visited us since her hog hegira. She had come to stay with Mary while I was in New Orleans, and I knew full well that the breach between us would now be wider than ever. The boys had a song during the war in which occur those beautiful lines- If you want to catch hell, Jest jine the cavalry, Jest jine the cavalry," etc. I had no particular anxiety to catch any thing of    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6867-00000069"/> 136         BOAZ: the sort, but I knew I would have a furious mother-in- law the next morning, which would answer the pur- pose quite as well as the cavalry, and I went to bed in fear and trembling. I didn't sleep any more that night, and my respected mother-in-law seemed to be equally disturbed. I could hear her restlessly rolling in bed, and murmuring, ever and anon, " O Lord! have mercy on me a sinner." At early dawn I dressed and went out on the porch for a quiet smoke. My wife's mother soon joined me, looking as doleful as Jeremiah. A moment afterward my camels came marching round the corner of the house with all the dignity of Oriental sheiks. My mother-in-law gave a little startled cry, then a prolonged "T-H-E L-A-W," and then the truth of the night before flashed upon her like light- ning. Her temper boiled up so suddenly that it al- most choked her, and she sputtered out like a mad boy in bathing when his companions are ducking him. "B-Boaz, did you bring those creatures here?" "I did," said I, as bland as the heathen Chinee, and braced myself for the coming shock. My feeble powers of description are wholly inade- quate to do justice to the occasion. The remembrance of her ludicrous figure the night before, and the idea that I had got her at last, seemed to add kerosene to the fires of her wrath, and she boiled over like a vol- cano shooting out rivers of seething lava. She forgot all her piety and humility of the previous night, and her tongue poured out broadsides of rage upon my devoted head like a full battery of Gatlin guns. It seemed to me that it would never end, and finally I laid aside my pipe, jammed both of my hands down to   HS TRIBULATIONS.      137 the bottoms of my pockets, and squaring myself be- fore her, I began to sing in a stentorian voice- If you want to catch hell, Jest buy a camel, Buy a camel, buy a camel, If you want to catch hell, Jest buy a camel- She didn't wait for me to finish the stanza, but bounced out of the house, and shaking the dust of my domicil from her feet, went bare headed down the road to the nearest neighbor's, vowing in her rage that she was done with me for ever and for ever. My neighbor furnished her with transportation to town, where she " nursed her wrath to keep it warm," and I was told got up a miniature representation of the eruption that buried Pompeii and Herculaneum every time she thought of having kissed me so affec- tionately, and asked my forgiveness for past offenses. In a little while every thing about the premises gathered about my camels. The negroes looked on in amazement, and wondered "what Mass'r Boaz was gwine to do with them things." The dogs crept around with their hair all turned the wrong way, whining un- easily, and every time a camel moved, lowered their tails, and sounding short barks of alarm, got over on the other side of the fence, or round the corner of the house. I soon rigged up some camel harness, and hitched them to a wagon to try their capabilities as work ani- mals. They were extremely awkward, but after several days of incessant driving round the premises, they went very well to an empty wagon. Finally, I thought    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6867-00000070"/> 138         BOAZ: they were practiced enough to give them a real prac- tical test, and one evening I ordered the driver to hitch them up and go to town for a load of corn I had purchased there. I was highly delighted with the manner in which my camels moved off with the wagon and congratulated myself that my experiment was a complete success. About sunset my wagon and team returned, but without any corn. "Well Tony," said I, "why did n't you bring the corn?" "De Lord bress us and perserve us, Mass'r Boaz, I neber got dar, sir. I neber seed sich a sight in all my born days, and I neber 'spects to agin.

Here was a difficulty which I had not originally dreamed of in my philosophy. I did not know until then what an object of terror the camel was to the equine race, but the fact was too clear to admit of even a doubt. Almost every horse and mule that got sight of them fled panic-stricken, and I saw in this a source of endless trouble. My own mules would get accus- tomed to them in the course of time, but I could not take them out on the highway without creating a stampede wherever they went, and endangering the life of whoever might come suddenly upon them, either on horseback or in a carriage. I had to keep them stabled to guard against accidents to persons passing the road, and I and my camels soon became a source of amusement to the whole community. This fact threw my mother-inilaw-bless her dear heart!-into a state of ecstatic beatitude, and she made a daily pil- grimage round the neighborhood to gather up every new item of camel scandal, that she might roll the sweet morsels under her tongue, and proclaim them from Dan to Beersheba. Occasionally some one would ask her about her streak of piety the night she saw the devil, and then you would have thought you had stirred up a case of hydrophobia if you had seen her. One unlucky morning my camels got out and stole forth on a general geological and botanical survey of the neighborhood. It so happened that the young people had gathered that morning for a pic-nic in a beautiful grove not far away. They were at the very acme of their hilarious joy when my camels, in the course of their reconnoisance, stumbled upon the party   IMS TIIBULATIONS.      141 'and concluded they would stop awhile to take a hand in the sport. Their arrival was heralded by a stam- pede among the horses, which broke loose from their moorings and sailed around promiscuously, smashing a buggy here and there against a tree that would n't get out of the way, and never once stopping to see about the pieces. The young ladies screamed, the young gentleman threw out a few adjectives, and such another " confuselment worse confuzled " had not been witnessed since Adam was an infant. The young men of the present generation do n't seem to think they are dressed well unless they have a derringer in each breeches pocket, including the one behind, and maybe a colt or two buckled around them; or, for the sake of a little dashing uniqueness, stuck in their boot legs. Those at the pic-nic were in the height of the fashion, and, drawing their shooting-irons, " cried havoc, and letting slip the dogs of war," went for my poor innocent camels like Cummings or DuChaillu would for a family of rampant lions. The poor beasts did n't mean any harm by going to the pic-nic, and with looks as resigned as the great Caesar's when Bru- tus struck him, they went to join their ancestors on the other side of Jordan. This event was the talk of the neighborhood for several weeks. In fact, those young " toters" of Derrin- gers did little else but ride around and tell how they saved the country by killing Boaz's camels, and their great topic of discussion was where this one or that one put in a ball and brought the claret. I could n't blame them for killing the camels, but I did think it was rather crowding the mourners for them to boast of their valor in shooting the poor gen- 7*.    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6867-00000072"/> "2          BOAZ: tie brutes in order to get up a reputation as heroes among the young ladies in having risked their lives to save them from the ravenous beasts of prey. Thus ended my camel enterprise. My dreams of future glory took to themselves wings and flew away, and I moralized over my misfortune in the language of Cardinal Wolsey: Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness! This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth The tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms, And bears his blushing honors thick upon him. The third day comes a frost, a killing frost; And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely His greatness is a ripening-nips his root, And then he falls as I do. I have ventured, Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders, This many summers in a sea of glory, But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride At length broke under me, and now has left me, Weary and old with service, to the mercy Of a rude stream that must forever hide me.   HS TRIBULATIONS.      143 CHAPTER XIII. Kindness of my Neighbors-Marriage of my Mother-in-law. WHEN Robinson Crusoe attempted to launch his big canoe, and found he could n't quite come it, I have no doubt that he felt a huge disgust for the world gen- erally, and big canoes especially, after having sweated and blown over it for so many long weeks. A very distinctive feeling of that character meandered through my bosom when I discovered that I had a pair of 'dead camels on hand, and the nearest sausage manu- factory was too remote to enable me to dispose of them at anything like their value. To be genuinely candid about the matter, I began to experience some such sen- sation even before those denizens of the Orient came to their sudden end. A suspicion, like the first gleams of early morn, that I had made a mistake, began to permeate my brain, and if I could have taken "round- ance" on that speculation, like boys do in a game of marbles, and got back to where I was before I found the menagerie man, I am rather disposed to think I should have done it. But that was out of the ques- tion. I had the camels, and I had enough of the never-say-die spirit about me to keep a stiff upper lip,    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6867-00000073"/> "4         BOAZ: and make the most of the bargain. Now, however, that they were dead, and my mind was cleared of the glamours that had for a time obscured it, I saw what an egregious ass I had been, and in the humility of the moment, felt that I stood ready bridled and saddled for any Baalam to mount and ride on any fool's errand he might desire. But whenever the picture of my dead camels floated before my imagination, I really could not summon up a sufficient degree of Christian meek- ness to keep down the gentle execration which Marc Antony pronounced over the body of CGesar, "Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!" If any one doubts that camel's blood is costly let him buy a pair and try it on himself. I always pre- tended to my wife-and friends that the menagerie man almost gave them to me, for I 'did n't want them to know how deeply I had put my foot in it, and many was the time that I felt a joyful consolation in being able to say that I didn't care a fig for the durned camels, that the freight, which was the principal cost, wasn't much, and the blessed consciousness that they -that is, my wife and friends-didn't know any better, flowed through my soul as pleasantly as the ottar of roses through one's proboscis. But, between you and me, precious reader, that was all in my eye- they were a veritable case of Asiatic cholera to my poor purse. I thought, at one time, that I would haul them to the manure heap, but the recollection of my hogs made me afraid to take any steps in that direc- tion, and I finally concluded to let them take their chances where they had fallen. I once heard a miser-   HS TRIBULATIONS.        145 able wretch sing to the tune of Old Hundred this de- scription of a rural scene: Two coal black crows sat on a tree, As black as ever two crows could be, The old one said unto his mate, What shall we do for food to eat? I see a horse on yonder plain, That has this moment just been slain, We'll fly and light on his breast bone, And pick his eyes out one by one. Likewise did they serve my poor camels, except that they did n't show any particulat partiality for the eyes, but paid their devoted attention to the whole carcass. I afterward sent my wife's mother a pair of the thigh bones as little mementoes of her first introduc- tion to those " ships of the desert," but it seemed to be utterly out of my power to do anything to please her, for she even got mad about that. What lunreas- onable tempers some people have! Notwithstanding the general rule that it won't do to trust your fellow-man with your money, nor give him a chance to gouge you, if you can help it, he is, taking him up one side and down the other, a very good-na- tured, agreeable and obliging animal. I have always found him so, at any rate. I wish it distinctly under- stood, by way of a parenthesis, that when I speak of my fellow-man I do n't mean a peddler, for I have never claimed fellowship with any of that tribe since the glandered horse was palmed off on me. If one were to come to me with an aggravated case of the colic, I might, perhaps, give him a dose of paregoric,    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6867-00000074"/> "6         BOAZ; if he could n't get it anywhere else, but I would rather he wouldn't try the experiment, for I might, by some unavoidable mistake, get hold of the vial of prussic acid instead. These amiable phases of his character-I mean my fellow-man's, not the peddler's-were brought out in glowing colors toward me, as soon as my misfortune in horse flesh became generally known. The season of double plowing being generally over, many of my neighbors had spare mules which they could very well get along without, and many of these were placed at my disposal, free of charge. I accepted such as I absolutely needed, and in that way got along quite as well as if I had had a full team of my own. I often found myself saying, how much better it would have been if I had waited a little for the kindness of my friends, instead of running off and buying those dogoned camels. As the summer wore on my spirits revived, and all my cares slept as sweetly in the graves of my heart as the sorrows of childhood in the tomb of the past. Hope that "Springs eternal in the human breast," once more sprouted in mine, and there was such an itching sensation about my mouth to whistle again that I felt as if I could say with Walter Scott: Harp of the North, that moldering long has hung On the witch-elm, that shades Saint Fillan's rpring, And down the fitful breeze thy numbers flung, 'Till envious ivy did around thee cling, Muffling with verdant ringlet every string-   HS TRIBULATIONS.       147 Oh minstrel Harp! still must thine accents sleep, Mid rustling leaves and fountains murmuring, Still must thy sweeter sounds their silence keep, Nor bid a farmer smile, nor teach a maid to weep! Fair prospects, like a setting hen, brooded over my soul so lovingly that all its little joyousnesses peeped through their shells and began to pipe their little tunes. The spirit within me that might have "Waked to ecstacy the living lyre," cried aloud to my harp, Oh, wake me once more! Enchantress, wake again? and she woke. The old familiar pucker tuned up the slackened chords of my lips, and once more "Lays of hopeless love or glory won," flowed from my mouth in such "Linked sweetness long drawn out," you would have felt The wizard note had not been struck in vain, provided you were not like my wife and baby, who could n't, for the life of them, appreciate my music. One morning, just after breakfast, Mary was in the yard, feeding a brood of chickens which she had just put out, and I was near by whistling "Old Bod Rid- ley" as I curried my horse preparatory to my usual morning ride over my farm, when, mirabile visu! my mother-in-law rode up to the gate.. I rubbed my eyes to see if I was not laboring under some kind of a men- i.    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6867-00000075"/> "8         BOAZ: tal delusion, but when I opened them and looked again, there she was, as natural as the Sphinx that has watched over the Pyramids for some years past. My first impulse was to close my eyes and repeat the little prayer, "Now I lay me down to sleep," etc., as chil- dren are supposed to do when they see a bugger in the dark. What's up now, thought L Has she come to bury the hatchet and smoke the pipe of peace? or is she spoiling for an old-time quarrel, and does she want to make me swallow the camel bones I sent her as a keepsake? Regardless of what her object might be, I determined to plant myself under the banner of peace, and tying my handkerchief to a stick, I raised my standard over- head, and gravely marched to meet her. She gave her piece of cambric an answering wave, and I knew that her "dogs of war " were in their kennels. I received her with all the suaviter in modo I could get up for the occasion, and she kissed me as affection- ately as on my bridal night. Mary was, of course, de- lighted to see the truce between us, and gave her a most hearty welcome. I mounted my horse and rode off to the field, won- dering what it all meant, for I was sure the old lady had some kind of a flank movement in view. It was near mid-day when I returned, and meeting my wife in the kitchen, I said: "Well, Mary, have you discovered what brought the old lady here in such a pleasant humor? I must confess it puzzles me no little." "Why nothing, except to visit us. Why do you suppose she has anything particular in view?"   HS TRIBULATIONS.      149 "You may rest assured, Mary, that, after abusing me all over the country as she has done, and vowing she would never darken my doors again, she would not come here now, all wreathed in smiles, unless some- thing unusual was in the wind." I soon joined the old lady in the parlor, and found her overflowing with the milk of human kindness. She made particular inquiry about the crop, wanted to know how I was getting on with the cabbage and onions, and said she would like very much to go out with me in the evening and see them herself. "When did you acquire a taste for agriculture," said I. "This is the first time I ever heard you express a desire to see a field, or saw you manifest the slightest interest in a crop of any kind." "Oh, I've been spending a week in the country with the Misses Morse. They are very fond of agriculture, and would show me over the farm, and entered into everything of the kind with so much enthusiasm, that I began to feel an interest in the subject myself before my visit was over." "Did they ' enter into everything of the kind' with any more enthusiasm than I did?" You lived with me more than a year, and I never succeeded in im- pressing you with the slightest interest in anything about my farm, though I tried very hard to do it." "Y-e-s," said she, thoughtfully, "but you know one is more open to conviction at some times than at others. By the way, Boaz, are you well acquainted with Col. Morse?" "I do n't know any Col. Morse," said I, and a broad suspicion of why she suddenly felt such an interest in agriculture, and why she had come to visit us, flashed    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6867-00000076"/> 150         BOAZ: upon me instantly. "The Colonel has hooked you in the gills," said I to myself. "You do n't know Col. Morse of Belvidere Place?" said she, in some surprise. "You surely do n't mean that old blunderbuss who bought Bob Snoddy's Lick-skillet farm last winter? Yes, I 'know him, but I never heard of his being a Colonel before." "That is the gentleman I mean," answered she, while her face flushed with excitement; "but I do n't see why you should speak of him so disrespectfully. His daughters are the most accomplished, lady-like girls in the neighborhood, and I would like to, know where you will find a more dignified, intelligent, hand- some gentleman than the Colonel himself." "Why, mother, he is the durndest old fool and gas- bag I ever saw. The boys all laugh at him for his stuck-up ways every time he goes to town. You would laugh yourself if you could see him sometime strutting around in his turkey-cock style, talking of Belvidere, and hear some one ask him if he means old Bob Snod- dy's Lick-skillet place. It always hits him in a ten- der spot, and brings him down a button-hole or two." The old lady fired up like she would boil over in spite of everything, but fortunately dinner was an- nounced, and interrupted our tete-a-tete. Soon after dinner, she retired for an afternoon nap, and Mary and I took seats on the porch, she to look over and mend the children's clothes, and I to read my papers. I had nearly reached the advertisements-I always read my paper regularly through from beginning to end-when, hearing a horse's hoofs on the road, I   HS TRIBULATIONS.      151 looked up and spied Col. Morse, distressingly dressed in his Sunday clothes and collar of the stiffest, standing in a hostile attitude to his ears, as if waiting to clip them off if his horse should stumble. "Mary," said I, 'Did you ever see a wild goose sailing on the ocean? The wild goose's motion is a mighty funny motion.' The old goose is asleep, and yonder comes the gander." "I do n't know what you mean," said my wife. "Why, this morning your mother popped in upon us in the gayest humor I ever saw her. It soon leaked out that she had been spending a week at Col. Morse's, where she suddenly acquired a wonderful taste for, agriculture. She wanted to know what I thought of the Colonel-thought herself that he was the nicest, handsomest and most intelligent man in the country, and to cap the climax, yonder comes the Colonel him- self, which looks very much to me like there was a secret understanding of some kind between them, as he was never here before. I think it is a very good case of circumstantial evidence. "You don't mean to say the Colonel is, court- ing ma?" "No, I do n't mean that-I only mean that he has already done it, and if you will only open your eyes you will see as spooney a couple as ever exchanged locks of hair." "Nonsense, Boaz; ma would as soon think of going up in a balloon as marrying again." "She'll go up in old Morse's arms, as sure as you're a foot high."    <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6867-00000077"/> 10X^    BOAZ: By this time the Colonel had reached the gate, and I went out to meet him. EIe, too, was as smiling as a bright May morning, and the whole manner of the man proclaimed his errand in unmistakable terms. I gave him a chair on the porch, and I thought I could see that he was disappointed at the absence of my mother-in-law. Mary soon engaged him in conversation upon the thousand and one topics which the ladies always have at their tongue's end, but it was evident to me that his mind was not fixed upon any of the 'matters dis- cussed, for his eyes were continually glancing uneasily around, evidently in search of the idol of his soul. The idol, however, was taking a most unromantic snooze, and the Colonel was doubtless at a loss to ac- count for her absence. A half hour passed, and still she snored away. "Ah, Colonel," thought I, "you kept the old lady up too late last night, and she is making up for lost time." As the evening wore on, a shade of disappointment settled over his features, and he finally proposed that we should go out and look at the crop. He soon satisfied me that he had something on his mind which he wanted to communicate, and several times during the ride he tried to sail up to the point, but I always dexterously turned him away. Finally, he went at me somethinglike desperation in his manner, and asked me when I had seen my wife's mother last. "Let me see," said I thoughtfully. "It has .been some two months since she imagined she saw the devil at my house, and left in a state of considerable excite- ment. The fact is, Colonel, she and I are not as play-   HS TRIBULATIONS.      153 fully pleasant with each other as a pair of young kit- tens, and I would rather not have anything to say about her." "Yes, I know," answered he. "H hope you'll not consider me intrusive, but really H think she is a remarkably fine woman. She has been spending a week with my girls, and it occurred to me that I might be the means of healing this little difficulty between you." "I believe I would rather not have it healed. She is the durnedest old scold I ever saw, and I do n't think our present status can be improved any. That reminds me to ask-you Colonel, how you prepare your bones for manure. I have been told that ashes will soften them so that they can be easily reduced to a powder. Did you ever try it?" "No, I never tried it," said he rather snappishy. "' I don't use bones at all." The old fellow looked rather crest-fallen at being thus headed off, and I had most of the talking to do during the balance of that ride. When we reached the house again my respected mother-in-law had finished her nap, and made her ap- pearance in fresh " bib and tucker," furbelowed and powdered, until she looked as youthful as was possible for one of her age. How that sight brought the Colonel out! His face glowed with rapture, and he actually whistled a line or two of "Come rest in this bosom my own stricken dear," then seemed to think he had started on the wrong tune, and stopped as suddenly as if some one had punched him in the stomach. As we rode up to the gate in full    <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6867-00000078"/> 154         BOAZ: view of the ladies, he thought he would show them how spry he was, and tried to leap from his horse with all the agility of boyhood, but fate had slipped a cob in the very place where his foot struck the hard ground. The cob meanly rolled, and before the old gentleman could recover himself, brought his head in contact with the palings and barked his nose, which gleamed like a stout sapling with a fresh blaze on it. "Bless my soul," I have no doubt he tried to say, but it sounded very much to me like there were two or three d-ns mixed up with it.' "Nice fix to meet one's lady love in," thought I, and I smiled all over, except on the surface of my face, as I sympathetically examined the wound. As soon as we reached the house I insisted on putting a piece of court plaster over the skinned place, to which he consented, and I plastered his proboscis with a section, larger by two or three sizes, thanwwas neces- sary. The Colonel sat until late, and I finally invited him to spend the night. He was n't hard to persuade, and I suppose was as happy the remainder of the evening as any boy in the full-blown glory of puppy love. After supper I went out to see that my horses were fed, and to give the couple a chance to "bill and coo" a little. Mary was in the dining-room washing the dishes, and when I returned, I seated myself on the porch. The window sash was up, but the curtains were down, and the ancient lovers were so engaged in their little pastime that they were not aware when I entered the porch. I did n't mean to listen, but they were sitting just by the window, and I could hear every word that passed.   HS TRIBULATIONS.     155 "Did you speak to Boaz about our engagement?" said the old lady. "W-e-ll, n-o, I thought you were to do that?" "Y-e-s, I did promise, but he is such a curious man that it is a harder task than I thought it would be." "Why don't you tell your daughter, then?" "Tell Mary! gracious me! that is worse still. I thought I would tell Boaz, and let him break the news to her. She would take it better in that way, you know, and just before dinner I began to talk about you, in order to broach the subject, but he got so ex- cited, and called you an old blunderbuss, and an old stuck-up fool, and talked about you in such a scandal- ous manner, that I got flustered and could n't tell him to save my life." "Dear me!" said the Colonel, "that's singular. He and I have always been very friendly. During our ride I did think I would mention the matter to him, but when I, casually, as it were, mentioned your name, he led me to believe that you had not been here for several months. He said you hated him, and when I intimated, in a very insinuating manner I thought, that I might be the means of making you friends again, he shocked me by saying that you were the durnedest old scold in the country, that he did n't want the difficulty mended, and then-would you be- lieve it-asked me how to pulverize bones so as to use them for manure. How could I edge in our love affair between his confounded bones. I never saw such a man in my life. He is enough to make a saint swear." "Oh the wretch!" said the old lady, Just to think of his telling me that you were an old fool, and then to turn right round and tell you the same thing.    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6867-00000079"/> 156         BOAZ: about me. I'm a durned old scold, am I? I 'll make him smart for it, the rascal." I was astonished to hear the old Colonel break into a hearty laugh and say: "My dear Betsy, it has suddenly occurred to me that Boaz suspected, from the first, that there was a love affair between us, and he has been having a little sport at our expense." "That's so," said I, pushing aside the curtain and stepping through the window, as much to their aston- ishment as if a bombshell had exploded in the room. "Kneel, my children, and receive my blessing," and placing a hand on the head of each, as they sat before me, I said: "May your union be happy and prosper- ous; may all your troubles be little ones; may your cradle be like the widow's cruse-never empty." "You, Boaz, hush up this minute," said the old lady, as she jumped up and put her hand over my mouth. "Well," said the Colonel, "I am glad you over- heard our conversation, for I don't see how we ever should have told you, if you had continued the use of your system of tactics." They married soon after, and retired to the roman- tic precincts of Belvidere, as the Morses called it, but they never succeeded in getting the name adopted out- side of their family. Lick-skillet stuck in the minds of the neighbors like a flea in a tar bucket, much to the annoyance of my mother-in-law, who boiled over every time she heard of her family being spoken of as the Lick-skillet people. For some weeks after her marriage she did not have time to regulate my affairs, and the tomahawk remained buried between us for awhile.   HS TRIBULATIONS.      157 CHAPTER XIV. The Result of my Diversified Crops-I Cave - My Opinion of the Necessary Qualities to Constitute a Good Farmer. I HAVE now reached that part of the programme which calls for an exhibit of my diversified crops, and I imagine I can hear the reader, who has followed us thus far, calling out: )S^    Boaz, tell us of the crop, How turned your onions out? Did your drumhead cabbage give A plenteous yield- of sauer-kraut? Did your equine-radish pay, Or aught of hope or joy foretell? Boaz, tell us of the way Your cotton -- Pshaw! I'm disgusted. I've tried my durnedest to end that line with a word that will rhyme with the corresponding one above, and can't do it, and I have finally comforted myself with the conclusion that it is not at all necessary. In fact, a sober second -thought has persuaded me that it is better to leave itjust as it is. If any reader differs with me in opinion, I will give him the privilege of filling it out to suit himself, while I answer the inquiries embodied in the above beautiful cascade of poetry. 8    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6867-00000080"/> 158         nBOAZ: In due course of human events my onions ripened, were gathered and shipped, but the practical result did not fully correspond with the figures which theory had worked out on my mental blackboard. In the first place, there was a slight mistake in the yield, not much, it is true, but still it was enough to vex a man who is as careful as I am to make a clean balance sheet between his real and his theoretical accounts. This mistake forced me to carry about six hundred bushels per acre to the account of profit and loss. In other words, instead of making nine hundred bushels per acre, after the manner of Slade and Henderson, I only made about three hundred. Then these three hundred did n't save very well; then again they did n't sell as well as I expected, and lastly, the expenses were greater than I had counted on. A philosophical view of the onion venture in all its ramifications, led me to a few simple, plain, practical conclusions, a careful perusal of which will, in a moment, convince any one of their truth and wisdom. These conclusions were: First, that there were other processes by which a man might accumulate wealth more rapidly than by growing onions, if he could only be fortunate enough to find them. Secondly, that there were other processes by which a man might sink money faster than by raising onions, if he should ever be so unfortunate as to find them. Thirdly, that all the mysterious circumstances sur- rounding onions, such as the quantity he makes to the acre, the price he obtains for them, and the expenses incurred in cultivating and getting them to market, affect their remuneration to the grower as seriously as   HS TRIBULATIONS.      159 the fox's feast served in shallow dishes affected the appetite of his guest-the stork. Fourthly, that the planter, who has once staked his all on onions, will not be likely to do it again, if he can find anything that will pay better. Fifthly, that the planter might stake his all on a stake, more like the baseless fabric of a dream, than onions, if his experimenting turn of mind should ever enable him to discover it. Without entering into particulars, I would respect- fully ask the reader to substitute cabbage for onions in the foregoing deductions, and he will thus have my whole experiment touching cabbage and onions so completely in a nutshell, that he will be able to com- prehend the problem at a glance, as clearly as he un- derstands that two and two make four. As to the horse-radish, all I can say is that it was an unequivocal, dead failure as a paying investment. The crop was fine enough, the yield was magnificent, but the market was non est inventus. I was in a hurry to gather. And then I was in a hurry to ship it, in order that I might be among the first in market, and get the benefit of the highest prices. I shipped it all at once, and awaited the result with nervous anxiety. In due course of time I received a letter from the consignee in which he communicated the comforting information that he did n't know what to do with my horse-radish. There was no sale for it in New Orleans, except in small quantities at the veg- etable stands in the market-houses, and he could do nothing with such a quantity as I had shipped him. I did n't receive this information with exactly the same spirit that thrills the fortunate well-borer when he    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6867-00000081"/> 160    .BOAZ: strikes oil, and my mind was much disturbed with un- certainty as to who was to blame for the result. I could not well determine whether a just contempt ought to fall upon the people of New Orleans because of their want of appreciation of horse-radish, or upon myself for being such a fool as to plant a crop without first ascertaining that there was a market within reach. I hope the reader will not express his opinion about that matter, for I should not like to be the means of injuring the reputation of the people of that city, on a subject of such grave importance to the agricultural interests of the country as the want of appreciation for horse-radish. Every one who has stored his mind with such items will remember that 1867 was a hard year with the farmers in Louisiana. As in the year previous, the corn and cotton crops were almost total failures, but I have always regarded it as a triumph for my system of farming, because I made corn enough to carry me through another year, and my cotton more than paid expenses. I could, therefore, have "Shoved along, kept'moving," had it not been for the-debt I had contracted in 1866, and the succession of subsequent misfortunes in stock, which shook the vitality out of my finances as effectu- ally as a terrier shakes the life out of a rat. My ex- penses in 1866 had been large, and my receipts-nil. Viewing my situation in the light of all the surround- ing circumstances, I am rather inclined to believe that unappreciative people would have preferred the pro- ducts of the United States Mint to my promissory   HS TRIBULATIONS.      161 -notes, and candor compels me to admit that that fact would not have been received, even by me, as con- clusiye evidence of insanity had I been on the- jury to try one of the unappreciative parties for murder. After Brown's insolvency, as narrated in a former chapter, I learned that all his notes and accounts had been sold at public auction, and that mine had fallen into the hands of one of the veriest old skinflints in New Orleans. It was some months before I heard from him. I suppose he was making his investiga- tions in the meantime, and watching my movements like the eagle does the fishhawk, until he finds him with a handsome fish in his bill, then sweeps down upon him and relieves him of his burden. In the early summer of 1867, my prospects were excellent, and my friend, Shylock, concluded it was time to get his batteries in order for an assault. The consequence was that I received a very polite invita- tion to "call at the captain's office and settle." I saw it was impossible to pay my debts and renew my sup- ply of work animals, so as to continue my farming operations. I might have obtained time from my creditors, but, in view of the rate of interest I would have to pay, and of the unlucky star that guided my fortunes, would it not be better to retire from the contest? To farm or not to farm? That was the question, Whether 't was nobler in the mind to suffer The stings and errors of unlucky farming, Or to bow before its sea of troubles, And by surrendering end them? The argument with myself was a long one. Two    <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6867-00000082"/> IsV14        BUAz: such disastrous years as 1866 and 1867 could not, I. thought, be followed by a third, and some imp of Satan continually whispered in my ears, "It will never do to giveit up so, Mr. Brown, It will never do to give it up so." At last, however, I closed my ears to these seduc- tive voices, which seemed to be a score of sirens, charming me to ruin, and concluded that I would sur- render. I therefore blandly said to my creditors: I give thee all, I can no more, Though poor the offering be, My farm and crops are all the store That I can bring to thee. I fortunately succeeded in making a very advan- tageous sale of my property, and, after paying all my debts, I had enough left to provide my wife with a new bonnet of the latest style, and some other little necessaries of minor importance, such as food and rai- ment, until I could establish myself in some other business. Thus ended my career as a farmer. I have often tried to imagine what a glorious relief it would have been to old Sisyphus if he could have rolled that ever- lasting stone down a precipice on the other side of that everlasting mountain, whence all the powers of the nether world could never have raised it. How he would have jumped up and cracked his heels together with glee! What a merry laugh he would have sent ringing through the Plutonian shadows! I have an idea that the ecstatic independence which inflated my whole soul when I found myself cut loose from my   HS TRIMULATIONS.      163 "entangling alliance with the farm," came very near enabling me to appreciate the relief which Sisyphus would have enjoyed under the aforesaid hypothesis. I felt as light and elastic as Smith did when his sweet- heart kissed him, and while yet the glorious thrill lingered in every nerve, he exclaimed, What then to me were groans, Or pain, or death I Earth was a round of bliss, I seemed to walk on thrones. Nevertheless I believed still that I was endowed with all the elements of a successful farmer, but those " ele- ments were so mixed in me " that I could never suffi- ciently untangle them to avoid my final disaster. I can not say that I regret the two years which I spent in farming. It is true they were full of misfortunes, but I only regard them now as among those pleasing varieties which are said to give all the flavor to life. I love to look back upon them now, as the traveler re- views a new country through which he has passed- though his memory lingers fondly over its flowing vales and murmuring rills, he turns not averse from the recollection of the rugged mountain over which he has dragged his worn and wearied feet. I offer the following deductions from my experience, respecting one's fitness for the farm, which may be worthy of the notice of those who think of engaging in that pursuit. If you are one of those unfortunates who were born tired, don't undertake a farm. The grass and weeds will run away with the crop while you are trying to rest. If you belong to that afflicted class who always feel ,--aJ    <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6867-00000083"/> 164         BOAZ: a kind of sink-and-goneness for the rest of the day, if they get up before - breakfast, pass a farm by as you would a thing of evil. That disease is catching, and your servants will soon be as badly afflicted as you are. If you have a literary turn of mind, and you feel convinced that the good of the world requires that it should be cultivated, do n't attempt to run a farm as a paying institution. You can't serve God and Mam- mon too. And it is no less true that the literary man who farms for profit, will either furnish the world with very little literature orwin a splendid reputation as an execrable farmer. If there is anything in the heavens above or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth, or anywhere else in the universal creation, to hinder you  from going into the business with all your strength of mind and body, fight shy of a farm. Something will be certain to turn wrong side up while you are looking after that other thing, whatever it may be. If you can coolly lay your hand on your stomach, and conscientiously plead guiltless of all the "ifs" aforesaid, then you may put yourself in training for a farmer; but, even then, don't try it on your own hook until you have learned the patience and perse- verance of a coffee-house loafer waiting for a drink; until you have acquired the firmness and determina- tion of an M. C. after his back-pay; until you have hardened your constitution to the same extent that a lobby politician has hardened his conscience; until you have learned to be so ubiquitous and sharp sighted that your farm and all its appurtenances will be con- stantly within your view; until you not only know   HS TRIBULATIONS.       16 how every operation about a farm must be done, but you can do it yourself; until, in short, you can do almost anything in the way of work, and know a little of almost everything. Do n't try any costly experiments on a costly scale. Do n't go to a public sale and buy anything you do n't want because it is cheap. Do n't buy anything of any description whatsoever, especially a horse, from a peddler, who tells you he is losing money by it because he is going away and do n't expect to return. Do n't fail to " raise your own vittles," and then be sure to raise a little more "vittles." The farmer who always has something of that kind to spare will be as sure to prosper as the faro banker who swaps you ivory chips for greenbacks. My standard for a successful farmer may be con- sidered too high, but I believe he requires a more ex- tended ability, a more diversified education and expe- rience than one in almost any other occupation. You may know how to "hoe corn and dig potatoes," you may learn how to perform all the manual labor re- quired in the routine of ordinary crops, but you will find that far more is necessary on a well-appointed farm, requiring the labor of fifteen or twenty servants, if you would keep your improvements in "apple-pie order," your stock in first-class condition, and, at the same time, get all out of your land that it is capable of producing. May the blessings of Ceres cluster around the farm- ers of the South, and peace and prosperity rest with them both now and forever. Amen  8*    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6867-00000084"/> 166         BOAZ: CHAPTER XV. A Farewell Dinner-A Meat and Bread Sermon for Improvident Farmers. A FEW days before I bade a final adieu to my farm, I was invited to meet my neighbors in a farewell din- ner. The gathering was quite large, and a long table was spread in the open air for the accommodation of the guests. A reasonable quantity of whiskey, stored where it would do the most good, followed by an ample supply of wine, made The whole glad circle round yield their souls To festive mirth and wit that knew no gall. Just before rising from the table, there was an en- thusiastic call for a farewell speech from Boaz, and I mounted-upon one end of the table and said: MY CHRISTIAN FRIENDS-This is to me a most solemn occasion, and, in severing my connection with the great brotherhood of farmers, I feel that a few words of sound advice will not be out of place. I hope, therefore, that you will pardon me if I take a regular text, and preach an orthodox sermon for the everlasting benefit of the improvident farmer. I have been told that you will find the words which I have   HS TRIBULATIONS.      167 selected for the occasion in John, - ch., - v., where the apostle feelingly exclaims, "Children, have you any meat?" I say I have been told these words are there, because I once heard an old minister preach a funeral sermon from this text, and he said that it could be found somewhere in John. I do n't know whether he told the truth or not, but, for the purposes of this sermon, I will be rash enough to take it for granted that he did. I do not remember that I ever saw it there, to my shame, perhaps, be it said, but, if my present hear- ers know as little about the matter as I do, I can as- sert with assurance, on the authority of our reverend brother of an estimable persuasion, that the text is there, and none of you can say aught to the contrary. Therefore, I will say to you, my scaly-back auditors, that my text is in John, and woe unto you, and unto your children, and unto your children's children, for coming generations, adinfinitum, if you give not greater heed to that which your humble preachist has to say about the passage than to the particular locus in quo the beautiful language was originally written, whether in the Bible or the Almanac, or the Dictionary, or any other book under the sun. But that word "originally" brings me back to the origin of my remarks, and forces out of my burdened heart the pathetic inquiry, "Chil- dren, have you any meat?" Before proceeding to unveil the mysteries and to elaborate the beauties of my text in all their intricate ramifications, I feel constrained to say that I suspect that our brother misapprehended the meaning of the language, as he stood in the midst of the weeping rela-    <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6867-00000085"/> 168          BOAZ; tives of the defunct, whose funeral he was preaching, and, with his eyes turned skyward, propounded that searching inquiry, unless, peradventure, he had failed in obtaining his matutinal repast, in which event it was but natural that he should have been more thought- ful of the comforts of his craving stomach than of the bereaved hearts of his hearers. I am not preaching a funeral sermon, my beloved, but verily I say unto you that a failure to give proper heed to the teachings of this beautiful text, will be a public invitation to the funeral of your fortunes, your farms and your country, and you will wander through the land, like the lean and melancholy ghosts which chassez along the river Styx without the cash to pay their ferriage, and your voices will be heard, like the voices of the Hebrews, by the rivers of Babylon, howling to every passing breeze, "Children, have you any meat?" Awake, therefore, ye slothful agriculturists, awake, and lend me your ears while I elucidate and fructify the everlasting truths that corruscate along the ever- lasting crests of my text, like "John Brown's soul that still marches on." I propose, then, to consider the meaning of the words in this beautiful passage, in a two-fold light: 1. Individually. 2. Collectively. I would remark that there are only two words in the text which I deem it necessary to individualize, and to catch the true ring of, as the miser catcheth the ring of his coin before he drops it into his old sock and hides it under the hearth, and those two words are "children" and "meat." I opine, my beloved,   HS TRIBULATIONS.       169 that the word children in the text has a much broader signification than that segment of the human family which the old women of the country spank with im- punity, and glory in the blessed consciousness that they can do it again, if they want to. I am persuaded that, in the full amplitude of its height'and depth, its length and breadth, it includes every native-born American citizen, white and black, blue, yellow and gray, male and female, old and young, together with all the rest of man and womankind on the face of this time-bound earth, and I do not think, therefore, my benighted friends, that I would be stretching my imagination too far, if I were to venture the assertion that it includes even you. The word "meat" meaneth not alone the aggre- gated globules which formeth the fleshy portions of the corporal tabernacles in which the spiritual essences of the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, and the fish of the deep " live and move and have their being," but to every eatable thing under the sun, which the tongue of man hankereth after or which he hideth beneath the broad bosom of his abdominal ocean, for it is said, "His meat was locusts and wild honey." I say, there- fore, my brethren, that meat here means "vittles," whether it be " chicken fixin's " or "' flour doin's," hani bones or corn-dodgers, pickled pork or biled cabbage, and I challenge the universal creation to refute the correctness of my doctrine. Judging by the shine of your eyes, my hearers, that you have imbibed my meaning thus far, I will now proceed to the second head, and take a bird's-eye view of my subject collectively. Having eliminated the true doctrine involved in the    <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6867-00000086"/> words dcildren and meat, it is easy to arrive at the col- lective meaning of the whole passage, and, instead of saying, "Children, have you any meat?" we may ex- ,press the same sentiment in the more artistic and poetical paraphrase, O O farmer, hast thou any " vittles?" "Aye, there's the rub." Hast thou the where- withal-not to gorge thy everlasting stomach at the next meal-but to feed thyself and thy family, thine ox and thine ass, thy hogs and thy cattle, even unto the sheep that browse upon thy pastures, and the gob- bler that struts in thy barn-yard, until another crop shall come in the fulness of time. O! my brethren, if I could convert myself into an angel, and soar with the speed of thought throughout the length and breadth of this Southern clime, and, pausing at every doorstep, exclaim in " thoughts that breathe and words that burn," "Farmer, hast thou any ' vittles?"' how many in this congregation could rise up, and shaking the dewdrops from their shaggy manes, answer proudly, "Yea, father, I have?"Weeping, I pause for a reply. Oh! my brethren, many are called but few are chosen, and your hang-dog looks proclaim with trumpet tongues that most of you are in the vocative. Then woe unto you, foolish farmers, for verily you are laying up for yourselves hunger against the day of hunger. Woe unto you I say, for the folly of the foolish virgins that trimmed not their lamps was wisdom compared with' your idiotic neglect.

Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. The son of David, king in Jerusalem, must have invented that idea on a full stomach, whereby his reason was clouded, for the doc- trine which he there propounds is not altogether cor- rect. A myriad voices spring spontaneously from the universal animated creation, and uniting in one grand choral strain, proclaim in tones of thunder that "vittles" is not vanity, and I feel sure, my brethren, that you will all take stock with me in that beautiful and pathetic sentiment, Give me "vittles," or give me death. It has been beautifully said that bread is the staff of life. I can vouch for the truth of this remark with painful fervor, for verily I say unto you that, in my meanderings through these low grounds of sin and sorrow, it hath often happened that that portion of my earthly tabernacle, which is gracefully encircled with the waisthand of my breeches, have travailed for "vittles," and, as the ass brayeth for his provender, even so have I been forced to cry unto the children of Mammon in the language of my text, Children, have you any meat? If, therefbre, ye raise not the "vittles," how can ye have the staff, and if ye have not the staff how can ye support the life, and if ye support not the life, what in the thunder is to become of the country? I will tell you, my agrarian brethren, what will become of you.

"No, we wont," some chuckle-headed brother will say, " we will arise and go unto our merchant and buy the fatted calf on-tick." But what if the merchant should say: "O, foolish and impecunious generation, ye seeketh after tick, but no tick shall be given you save the tick of the prophet Jonah." You know, my brethren, he tried to obey the Lord on tick, and the consequence was that he got ducked in the sea, and swallowed by a whale, and walloped around generally in a way that made him " git up and git." Just so will you get soused in a sea of trouble, swallowed by a whale of debt, and walloped about until you look meaner than that sneaking "yaller" dog which Adam found slinking around his kitchen, and has slunk around the universal creation ever since. O, misguided brethren, are you content to sit, like a legion of Lazaruses, at your merchants' doors, and feed on the crumbs you can beg from their bounty? Can you stand up like men and feel that you are free-born American citizens as long as you whine after others for your " vittles?"Then rise, rise, ye slothful farmers, from the bog holes of your credit, soar aloft on the blessed consciousness of having raised your own " vittles," and year after year you will rise higher and higher, and when your lives shall reach the " sere and yellow leaf" you will perch on the pinnacle of independence, and planting the point of your thumb on the apex of your nose, you will be able to twist your fingers in   nrs TRIBULATIONS.      173 contemptuous defiance at the hordes of Shylocks who lie in wait for the unwary farmer, trying to gobble up all he makes by furnishing him "vittles."

My Wife Purchases a Bonnet-I am   Compelled to Employ an Imp called Coots. I WILL admit, in advance, that it is worse than heathenish to speak of any little irregularity which may occur in the orbitual motions -of one's domestic affairs, but I have heard it said that there are excep- tions to all general rules, and I am persuaded that the occasion sometimes arises when a man may par- tially lift the veil which encircles his domestic sanctum sanctorum, without forfeiting his character as a civilized creature. A single drop of water falling on the head is a very insignificant circumstance, but credible his- torians relate that if it continues to fall drop after drop in the identical spot for a sufficient length of time, the droppee will halloo " ow!" in spite of all the powers that be. It is just so with a small melancholy peculiarity of my wife, which has dropped upon me semi-annually ever since we were married. At first it fell without a quiver, or a shiver, but it now comes with such terrific force as to fill me so full of " ows," I must let'em out, or I shall burst as wide as the Graphic balloon. This peculiar manufactory of my domestic sorrows is my wife's semi-annual purchase of a bonnet; but,   HS' TRIBULATIONS.      175 to make the matter clear, I must be allowed a few pre- liminary explanations. When we were first married, my "pard" was as lovely as they generally make 'em, and no one within the whole circuit of my acquaintance was more con- scious of the fact than herself. I was proud of her beauty, and lavishy furnished her with the means to adorn her earthly tabernacle with such attire as would cause her to linger in the memory of the beholder as "a joy forever." Likewise, also, she was proud of her beauty, liked to linger in one's memory in the manner aforesaid, and if, at any time, I failed to shell out fast enough to keep that earthly tabernacle provided with the rarest creations of milliner and mantua-maker, she never hesitated to give me a gentle reminder that could not be resisted. Though she appreciated the art of the mantua-maker to an extraordinary degree, it was the exquisite creations of the milliner, which brought into play the full tenderness of her soul-above all things else. "My bonnet is my dress," she would say, "Iet me rig my head as it should be, and the remainder of my make-up will harmonize without any trouble." A smile as beautiful as the awakened morn, would glorify her lips every time she opened her bandbox, and when she had adjusted that wonderful combina- tion of wire, lace, ribbons and flowers-vulgarly called a bonnet-upon the apex of her cranial organ, her whole nature became so beatified, and her beautiful eyes shone so like the beaming portals of heaven, that one could almost imagine himself an angel while bask- ing in their intoxicating light. At feast I could, for I was in that "bill and coo " condition, common to newly wedded people, and I firmly believed that if there was    <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6867-00000089"/> 176          BOAZ: a perfect thing in the universal creation, it was Mrs. Boaz. Of course I think so yet, but I am not so en- thusiastic about the matter now that I would- shoot a child or a sick female for expressing a contrary opin- ion. In the early days of our wedded love, I permit- ted myself to become as highly electrified with the desire to see her cranium ornamented with "a real love of a bonnet" as she was herself. It was not dif- ficult to accomplish that purpose, then, but Alas for youth! Alas for truth! That Time his course will never stay; And that his touch, however light, Is always sure to brush away Some beauty that can never more Return as freshy as before. Alas, too, for my wife! that she has not been an ex- ception to this rule, but, as the poet beautifully says, "sich is life." Each passing year has robbed her per- son of some charm that was once a crowning glory, but unfortunately she closes her eyes to this melan- choly fact, and "thereby hangs my tale." She will not believe that the freshness of her youth has de- parted, or that age is making any inroads upon those charms which once made her the "cynosure of all eyes." When adjusting her bonnet for a visit or promenade, she thinks the glass ought to reflect as lovely a picture as it did in "the good old days of yore," and, if it does not, she thinks it is altogether the fault of the bonnet, Then comes the soul-absorb- ing tug, to so adapt a bonnet to that face as to make her look as fresh and beautiful as when her cheeks   IS TRIBULATIONS.       1" were tinted with roseate hues of youth. It would seem that successive years of failure would teach her the impossibillity of the thing, but, strange as it may appear, she tries to solve that problem every time she purchases a bonnet, and, the further she drifts away from her purpose, the more heroic and soul-harrowing become her efforts. Her moulting time is ushered in by signs so unmistakable that the whole family know she is snuffing a new bonnet, as the war-horse snuffs the battle from afar. As a change of season ap- proaches, she begins by eyeing the old bonnet suspi- ciously, and turning it over and over two or three times, whenever she puts it on. She grows restless, and her countenance wears an anxious look, as if she were revolving the fate of nations in her mind. She looks eagerly for her fashion magazine before it is due, and wonders why it doesn't come. She insists it is behind time, and thinks the editor had better quit if he can't furnish his readers with the fashion plates be- fpre the season is over. I suggest that if it is later than usual, it may be the fault of the mails. She gets wrathy, and wishes she had the power to hang a few mail contractors and postmasters; she reckons they would attend to their business then. I venture the opinion that they could not well attend to their postal duties after undergoing that little operation, and she sails out of the room wishing some people would not try to be so smart. Finally, the magazine arrives, and she pounces upon it like a duck upon a grain of corn. She devours all that is said about the coming bonnet, and then abuses the editor for not saying more. She thinks I have the happiest faculty of any man she ever saw of always subscribing for the mean-    <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6867-00000090"/> 178       .   BOAZ: est magazine ever published, forgetting that that par- ticular magazine was not written for until she had pro- mulgated the edict that it was the only one of all the publications worth having. Last fall these premoni- tory symptoms were more serious than usual, and, during their progress, there was no such thing as tranquillity in the family. I do n't mean there was ever anything like a row; my wife is too dignified to indulge in that kind of an entertainment, and likewise, also, am I, and the rest of the Boaz household, but her whole heart and soul being concentrated upon the study of a problem which she could not satisfactorily solve,' her temper was naturally in quite an agitated state, and the consequence was that the Boaz family were in that poetical condition, called one as the sea but many as the waves, and the waves rolled about rather promiscuous-like, and would carom against each other occasionally in a very unsatisfactory manner. The time finally came for her periodical descent upon the milliner shops, and she went forth with firm resolve, Such as raised To height of noblest temper heroes old, Arming to battle, and every feature of her countenance seemed to say, "sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish," I give my heart and hand to this purchase, and I'll have the model bonnet this time, or I'll makb these milliners fairly "siz." She invited me to go with her for the purpose of giving my unbiased judgment upon the thousand and one bonnets she expected to pass in review, and issued   HS TRIBULATIONS.      179 4 the invitation in a manner that plainly said, if I did n't accept she would make me "siz" a little too. My nerves had already been considerably unstrung, during the two or three weeks which she had been incubating on that bonnet, and when she issued the mandate for me to follow in her train, I felt very much inclined to rebel. But past experience taught me not to do that, and with a sigh as huge as the mastodon's, I donned my hat and went as meekly as a lamb to the slaughter. She concluded she would first try a new shop, which had been recently opened, so we entered, and the business of the day began. She blandly asked to ook at some bonnets, and the smiling milliner brought out an armful, trimmed with colors which she thought were suited to my wife's age and matronly ap- pearance. .But a change came o'er the spirit of her dream as quickly as a flea gets out of the way of a pursuing finger, as Mrs. Boaz sternly pushed them all aside, and remarked, with no little dignity, that he had not come to-purchase a bonnet for her grand- mother, she wanted one for herself. "Ah," said the milliner, "will madam look in the case, and see if she finds one that will suit her." Madam took a survey of the cases, and called for one which she believed she would try. She stood be- fore the glass and arranged and re-arranged, adjusted and re-adjusted the thing on the top of her chignon until my patience began to ferment, but the bonnet wouldn't suit. There was always an indescribable something lacking. The innocent milliner didn't know my wife, and suggested that it had been made for a young girl, and was therefore too gayly trimmed for one of her age. Geewiliken! how the old lady's    <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6867-00000091"/> 1SV         BOAZ' ; eyes flashed as she flirted out of that shop. She laughed heartily, but I thought rather hysterically, as we walked away, at the idea of wearing a bonnet with drab-colored trimmings, such as the milliner recom- mended, and asked me if I did n't think she looked horrible in colors of that kind. Experience again came to my relief, and taught me to say frankly and can- didly that, if it were possible for her to look horrible in anything, it would be in a bonnet trimmed in drab. Thus we made the circuit of all the milliner's shops in town, but with no better success, and we finally reached home to a late dinner, she dissatisfied and stormy, and I hungry and mad enough to bite a tenpenny nail in two, but still prudent enough to keep my wrath well corked in. The next morning I thought I would es- cape another such a terrible day as I had just passed through, by running away; and when my wife asked me at the breakfast table if I would be very busy that day, thinking she was going to invite me out again, I answered, yes, that I was going over to Mansura, (a vil- lage about six miles off,) and would be gone all day. "The very thing," said she; I was just going to ask you to drive me over there. There are two or three very nice French milliners in Mansura, and, as they do n't speak English, I want you to interpret for me." The great Caesar I thought I, was it possible that I was in for another bonnet shopping, and as interpre- ter, too, of the ten thousand times ten thousand tom- fooleries which would be said about the bonnets. Cursed be that saffron tea which saved me from the measles in early youth 1 It is useless to give a detailed account of that day's proceedings. Suffice it to say that we went, that I   E  IIIS TRIBULATIONS.      181 acted as interpreter, and that about three o'clock my wife drew me into the house of one of her friends to dinner. That friend had just purchased a new bon- net, which was brought forth and duly inspected, and then they two sat down together, and such another everlasting rigmarole of bonnet talk I never heard be- fore, and may I be immersed in coal oil, and used as a street lamp, rather than be condemned to hear it again. I became so nervous from having had that one eternal subject dinned into my ears for so long a time, that I got sick at the stomach, and could n't eat. A feeling of suffocation, like one feels when he is breath- ing carbonic acid gas, crept over me, and, for a mo- ment, it seemed that I was utterly and teetotally anni- hilated. Then consciousness slowly returned, and my first impression was, that I was Sisera, captain of Jabin's army, that I was bound hand and foot, and there was a Jael on each side of me, trying to pass a bonnet in at one of my ears and out at the other. With a superhuman effirt I broke loose from my cap- tors and ran for my life. Complete consciousness found me on the common, bareheaded, and looking as woe-begone As the maiden all forlorn, That milked the cow with the crumpled horn. Having recovered my equanimity I returned to the house, and there sat those two angels still, so absorbed in talking bonnet that they had not noticed the manner of my disappearance. In sheer desperation I told my wife that I was very sick, and must hurry home. I will do her the justice to say that, for the moment, she 9    <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6867-00000092"/> forgot the bonnet, and manifested a real interest in my welfare. I hastened our departure, and, as we rode home, the refreshing breeze brought me round again. But the horrible thought that the bonnet was not yet purchased clung to me like Banquo's ghost to Macheth. I cried Avaunt and quit my sight, but it would n't avaunt, and the consequence was that when I retired for the night, I was in such a condition of mental excitement that it was a long time before I sank into a restless slumber. Then dreams like Tarta- rean goblins held a wild revel in my brain, and bon- nets were horribly mingled in them all. My first dream was that I was a sun-bonnet, which a merry- hearted maiden wore to school. She pulled me off, and laid me down on a root, while she joined her young companions in play. I enjoyed their sport for awhile, and then a monster, two hundred pound girl dropped out of the game, and spread me out for a seat. I saw her immense weight coming down upon me, as I imag- ine a pile-driver drops upon the offending pile. I felt that I was about to be mashed into sausage meat, and just as she touched me, I awoke with a yell of fright. I found myself sitting up in bed, and the perspiration standing like bird's eggs upon my forehead. . I got up and smoked a pipe or two to calm my nerves, and re- tired again. I soon fell asleep, but erewhile became conscious that I was undergoing a most singular change. I looked down and saw that my legs were two ribbons, my body was a wire frame, my head was an ostrich plume, my arms were two wreaths of artificial flowers, my night shirt a yard of tulle; and then, in a twink-   IIS TRIBULATIONS.      183 Hing, I was a fashionable bonnet. I next found myself in my wife's hands. She was standing before her mir- ror, in full dress, preparing for a descent upon some fashionable friend. She adjusted me carefully upon the top of her head, then brought my legs under her *chin, and tied them securely. It was by no means pleasant to have my legs tangled in a bow-knot, but I had been so long accustomed to accomodate my wife in anything she desired, that I bore it without a mur- mur. She then took up a huge gilt-headed hair-pin, and impaled me through the back to her chignon. That was rather more than I could stand, and as the pin pierced me through, with a roar like a mad bull in the arena when the matadore pierces him with the lance, I made a spring for my life, and awaking, found myself in the middle of the room, with every sinew fixed for running. The situation was awful in the ex- treme, but through it all my wife slept as sweetly as an infant in its mother's arms. If such was to be my life, thought I, it were best to end it at once, and I de- termined to do so. I wrote a brief note of farewell to my wife, and then fastened a rope to the tester, near the head of the bed, so that she could easily find me in the morning. If I had gone into some hidden corner to do the deed, I knew she would feel anxious on ac- count of my singular absence, and in departing, I did n't wish to annoy her any more than necessary, I mounted a chair, and placing the noose around my neck whispered a tender farewell to my sleeping spouse, and in another moment would have launched into eter- nity, but I suddenly remembered that we were to have buckwheat cakes and new syrup for breakfast the next morning. Now if I have a peculiar weakness of any    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6867-00000093"/> kind, it is an overwhelming fondness for buckwheat cakes and syrup, and I therefore concluded that I would postpone the suicide until after breakfast. I destroyed the note, went to bed again, and slept until morning. Breakfast being over, Mrs. Boaz, wholly uncon- scious of the narrow escape I had made the night be- fore, returned to the old sore again. "My dear," said she, "I really do n't know what I shall do for a bonnet. I can not possibly endure that old one any longer, and none of the milliners in reach have one which suits me." "My love," said I, "if you will go down town, select all the materials yourself, and have one put up accord- ing to your own directions, I am sure it will be per- fect." She adopted the idea at once, and went to give the necessary order. When I reached home, at the usual dinner hour, I found her wreathed in smiles, and sing- ing as gayly as a bird carolling a welcome to spring. She had given minute instructions about the building of the institution, and she now awaited the result with all the eager soul fluttering, which pervaded the Graphic sanctum during the construction of that famous balloon. In the course of two or three days it came. It was a gem in the abstract, but when mounted on the cranial apex of my better three-quarters, there was something about the general get-up as strikingly in- congruous as the President's late thanksgiving, day was to poor bankrupt Louisiana. She was dimly conscious of the fact herself, and as she took a view of the scenery in the glass, an ominous gravity clouded her counte- nance. She got up an air of dignity as distressing as   HS TRIBULATIONS.       185 that of the small boy after smoking his first cigar, and turning toward me with all the graceful grandeur of a Mississippi steamboat rounding to, she simply said : "Well?" The crisis was as tremendous as when the Great ('aesar pondered on the brink of the Rubicon. My opinion had been asked. I feared to tell the truth, but still my Washingtonian horror of a lie would not let me glow with ecstatic delight. I therefore mus- tered boldness enough to suggest, in the mildest man- ner possible, that it needed a little-just a little- toning down with more subdued colors. She trans- fixed me with such a withering look that I subsided at once, and tried to whistle in a sort of nonchalant man- ner, as the belated boy does in passing a graveyard after dark, in order to persuade himself that he is n't afraid. She concluded she would keep the bonnet at' all events, as there was no probability that she would be able to suit herself any better. I felt that so gayly and so muchly-trimmed a bonnet, on so old a head as hers, would create a sensation wherever she went, and, when the Sabbath came, I improvised a headache rather than witness the astonishment of the congrega- tion as she entered the church. When the sonorous peals of the Sabbath bells broke the stillness of the quiet morn, she mounted her head-gear, and, with a heart overflowing with religious zeal, she marched forth to the performance of her sacred duties. In due course of time she returned, and I knew by the curve of her lip, the fiery glance of her eye, the Junonian toss of her head, and the extreme dignity of her de- meanor, that her morning's devotion had not been as    <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6867-00000094"/> 186          BOAZ: satisfactory to her as the milk punch I had just swal- lowed had been to me. I was sure that the bonnet was the thing of evil which had disturbed her Sunday serenity of soul, but I did n't think it was prudent to investigate the matter while every appearance indi- cated that her temper was in such an agitated and stormy condition. It leaked out, however, that she had been stared at more than was comfortable, and she had overheard two or three side remarks about her bonnet, which did n't seem to have been read out of the prayer-books, and which elicited responses from her which were not altogether orthodox. I never learned the full particulars of her morning's devotions, but during the evening that bonnet was taken out and thoroughly reconnoitred two or three times, .and every time was returned to the box with a sigh and a shake of the head, as reverend and grave as Jonah shook, when he picked himself up on the sea shore, and tak- ing a retrospective view of his late apartments, is supposed to have said, "Who'd a thunk it." The next morning, as I was about to leave the house, my wife brought out her bandbox, and asked me to carry it back to the milliner, have the plume removed, and call for it again on my return to dinner. I did n't fancy being made an errand boy, but I knew better than to refuse to carry that bandbox, so I did as di- rected. As soon as I returned she clapped it on her head, and took a survey of the situation in the mirror. The survey didn't seem to be satisfactory, for it was accompanied with another of those Jonah-like shakes of the head. Dinner passed in profound silence, and I left her with her elbow on the table, and her head rest- ing upon her hand, evidently absorbed in a brown study.'   HS TRIBULATIONS.      187 I had just reached that stage of my usual afternoon nap, where the mouth flies open, and the first infant snore breaks the stillness of the chamber, when I was roughly shaken and brought to my senses by the stern voice of my wife, saying, "Boaz, I wish you would get up and carry my bon- net back to the milliner for another change. I do n't like to trouble you, but I can not, and will not, make my appearance on the street in that old bonnet, and you can just run down and make the necessary expla- nations so much better than a servant can, or I can write them." That interruption did n't arouse my devotional feel- ings very much, but I rose and went. I waited until the change was made, and carried the bonnet home again. Then begun a series of trips, between Mrs. Boaz and the milliner, which seemed to me would never end. I began to get wrathy, and contemplated planting myself on my constitutional rights as one of the lords of creation. To make the matter worse, I could not even throw out a few forcible expletives to relieve my indignation, because I had been credibly informed that swearing was not genteel, and when I abandoned my farm, I vowed that I would try to get along without it; but that confounded bonnet started all the "cuss words"I had ever learned to ferment- ing, and I found it almost as difficult to hold them in, as it is to bottle champagne without a double rectified tie of wire and twine over the cork. One morning, as I was making about my millionth trip, more or less, one of my friends hailed me, and wanted to know if I had been promoted to a permanent position as errand boy- to the milliner. That immediately brought to my mem v    <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6867-00000095"/> 188         BOAZ: ory every unsaintly word I had ever heard. I jammed my unoccupied hand down to the bottom of my pocket, I stamped my feet, and gritted my teeth, and I am sure I would have boiled over had not a lucky source of relief presented itself. Coots was a rowdy boy about town, a regular gamin, as complete a juvenile bruiser as ever haunted the Five Points. No one knew who his parents were. In fact, it was generally believed that he never had any, but that he was an original creation of Old Harry, a part and parcel of that gentleman himself, turned loose boiling hot upon the town, as a lure to the unwary youth. The whole corps of Sunday-school teachers had made a dead set at him, tried to beguile him with apples and nuts, and a nice suit of clothes, and offered him a brand new Bible and hymn-book, if he would go to Sunday-school, but Coots' invariable answer was to pull down the lower lid of his eye, and ask if there was anything green in it. His vocabulary of objurgatory expressions, or "cuss words," was as choice and com- plete, in its way, as Webster's Unabridged. Coots passed me just as my wrath was about to boil out at my mouth, nose and ears, in spite of the tightest grip I could get on it, and, as it was generally conceded that any boy who could resist the temptations which had been held out to Coots to attend Sunday-school, could not have any soul, I had no hesitation in em- ploying him to exhort that bonnet a little. "Halloo, Coots," said I, " would you like to make a dollar?" "I would, if the work ain't hard." "It is so easy," said I, " that it would do itself if I were to let it alone. I have a bonnet here I am nearly   HS TRIBULATIONS.      189 dying to 'dog-on,' but I have been credibly informed it would be a sin to do it myself. I'll give you a dol- lar if you will do the job in your handsomest style, but you must go it strong, and give it eternal thunder." "All right, boss, ef I do n't do it up brown you can take my belly for a bee-gum." I set the bandbox down, and took the cover off, so that he could see the thing that I wanted him to bless. Now, Coots," said I, " there it is, but if you stop for anything, or say a word to anybody, under any circumstances whatever, while you are doing this little job for me, I won't pay you a cent. Now let her rip like the clatter-wheels of greased lightning were after you." I did n't know exactly what that meant, but Coots seemed to think it meant business, and he did let her rip, in a style that was vastly soothing to my bottled wrath. He pulled off his piece of a hat and threw it aside, spit in his hands, and, with a sudden spring, put himself astride the bandbox, and, pointing down at the bonnet, heaved a yell as terrific as ever Captain Jack got off when scalping a foe. He trotted around it in a sort of a war-dance, and paused every few steps to clinch his fists and shake them at it, as if he in- tended to knock it into spizzerinctums; went off some twenty feet, every few minutes, to get a running start, and then pitched at it like a mad watch-dog after a stray cur; stood over it, and taking his old coat sleeve in his teeth, growled and shook it like a terrier would a rat; pretended to pick up an imaginary bonnet, and went through the motions of tearing it into a thousand 9*    <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6867-00000096"/> 190         BOAZ: pieces, and, all the while, hurled volley after volley of artistic expletives at that bonnet, in such rapid suc- cession that the plaguey thing would have wilted in shame if it had had soul enough to feel mean about anything. In the meantime quite a crowd of the curious collected, and first one and then another would go up to Coots, and ask him what it all meant, but, remem- bering the contract, he never stopped to answer. "Is the boy crazy?" asked one. "Why don't he pick up the bonnet and go about his business?" said another. "I Whose bonnet is that?" asked a third; but no one got any satisfaction, and they all looked on in utter amazement. My wrath gradually oozed away under Coots' mollifying exertions, and I once more felt like a civilized creature. Having reached that ecstatic condition, I handed Coots his dollar, picked up the bandbox, and went on my way rejoicing. As I walked away, in reply to the question, "what in thunder it all meant?"I heard Coots say: "Durned ef I know. He guv me a dollar to cuss that bonnet, and I kin whip any feller in the crowd that's got anything to say agin it." Somehow or other, in a manner the most unaccounta- ble, my wife got hold of an exaggerated account of the whole affair during the day, and she never troubled me with that bonnet any more. She has never told her grief, but she speaks to me so kindly, and looks so hurt, and sighs so sadly, O! so sadly, that it is enough to make an alligator weep. -I am penitent in the ex- treme, and feel that I must apologize, and promise that I will never, never do so again, but will tote that bandbox round the world, if she says so, and be folded   HS TRIBULATIONS.       191 once more in her forgiving arms. But I feel that my days are numbered, and I am looking for a life insur- ance agent to take out a million dollar policy in her behalf, as the only reparation I can make. I know that I can not survive another such a course of bonnet purchasing, and, if my wife puts me through again next spring, I shall be a goner. As I look into the future, about the time " the roses lose their bloom," I see my friends around a lonely "valley grave," and I hear them singing softly: Far too lovely was our darling, For this cold and bitter life, And although we weep to miss him, He is free from every wordly strife; And we dream some other angel Strokes again his darling head, And amid angelic music, Puts him in his little bed.

CHAPTER XVII. I Meet with some Painful Accidents-My Admiration for the Female Sex Leads me into Grief. I PUBLISHED the preceding chapter, recounting my troubles with my wife's bonnet, in the Rural Sun, a newspaper edited in Nashville, and having thus pumped out the pent-up agony of my soul some weeks ago, I flattered myself that I had killed two birds with one stone. I thought I had secured a host of sympathizers among unfortunate Benedicts, and last, but not least, had planted a dig where it would do the most good toward quieting the abnormal excitement which inun- dates my better half whenever she purchases a bonnet. This idea filled me so full of joy that I chuckled as pleasantly as the Psalmist tells us brethren do who dwell together in unity. I placed the paper conspicuously on the center table, where my wife would be sure to see it, and, putting on my hat, walked out with a swell air, slamming the door rather emphatically as I went through, to show that I felt my oats. I went for a stroll through the silent woods to muse on the universal creation as most other distinguished men sometimes do. The air was bracing and balmy; the sunlight darted through the leafless trees with a liberty and independence it would   HS TRIBULATIONS.       193 not dare assume in the summer time; the sky-well the sky looked about as it usually does, when the clouds have furled their banners, and I felt as light and elastic as a balloon full of gas. I paused on a rustic bridge, which spanned a murmuring rill-or rather one that would have murmured if there had been any water in it-and had pretty well concluded that it was a very pleasant evening, when "a thing of beauty," which did n't prove to be '"a joy forever," bearing the form and features of a female woman, came tripping along behind me. She was too heavily veiled for me to tell who she was, but instinct apprised me of the fact that she was beautiful. With all the grace and modesty peculiar to her sex, she trotted right up to me, and, running her arm through mine, proposed to join me in my walk. So much for being a handsome fel- low, thought I; and, as we strolled along, I gently pressed her hand against my side. She gave my arm the faintest possible answering squeeze, just as a nice, modest girl would naturally do. Then with my other hand, I bodly grasped hers, as it lay like a forky snowflake upon mWiarm, and she didn't shy a bit. The great Caesar! how luscious it was! I felt as good and pleasant as two or three families of brethren who dwell together in unity, and I gently closed my eyes to let it ooze through me, "like the precious ointment upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that ran down to the skirts of his garments." You know how it is your- self, and, 4trange to say, I forgot there was a Mrs. Boaz, or a little Boaz, anywhere in the wide, wide world. I am not going to tell all that passed between us. Suffice it to say that we strolled about until " twilight drew her mantle round and pinned it with a star."    <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6867-00000098"/> 194         BOAZ: Then she suggested the propriety of going for our re- spective roosts, as there was danger of catching cold in the night air. We went, but in entering the village, we had to pass an old, deserted house, which was said to be haunted. My fair companion asked me if I be- lieved in ghosts. I said I did n't. She asked me if I was afraid to explore that house with her. I said that I was n't afraid of all the ghosts in Hades, and, with a companion so like one of the blessed angels just out of Paradise, I would explore anything that was ex- plorable. She gently squeezed my hand and said, "then let us do it." The house was closed, and looked dark and ghostly in the extreme. Nothing daunted, I marched boldly up to the door, which I was surprised to see open, apparently of its own accord, and, down the long corridor beyond, the most profound silence sat enthroned upon darkness so dense that it seemed impossible to penetrate it without blasting a tunnel through it. "It is strange, said I pausing, how that door opened. Some one must be in there." "It is a ghost," my companion laughingly answered. "If you are afraid I 'll go alone." "Afraid!" said I, "ask Samson if he was afraid, when he fell upon the Philistines with the jaw bone of an ass -and slew a thousand." I will candidly acknowledge, however, that I was a little shaky, but I boldly entered and the door closed with an ominous slam, which echoed solemnly through the old house. I had scarcely made a step forward, before my companion quietly dropped my arm, and I was seized by a host of unseen hands. It seemed to me that some one had hold of every available portion   HS TRIBULATIONS.     195 of my coat, from the tip end of the tail up to the col- lar, and it occurred to me that by making a bold plunge forward, I might leave my coat in their hands, and thus effect my escape. I plunged; I lunged; I got rid of my garment but not of my enemies. They swarmed around me like enraged hornets. They went for my legs, arms, nose, ears, hair and every available point for obtaining a good hold, and quicker than I could think Jack Robinson, I was stretched upon the floor, like the noble stag whom the force of circum- stances compels to succumb to a pack of hungry wolves. My first thought was of my fair companion, and I sung out to her. "Run, my darling, for your life, and call for help. I am in the hands of robbers and perhaps assassins." "Your darling, indeed!" answered one, who was swinging to on; of my ears with a death grip, and at the same time she planted a neat little gaiter with con- siderable force, just where itseems that nature intended a fellow to be' kicked. I recognized the voice instanter. It was the same whose cooing tones had sounded so like music in my ears during the last two hours, and I realized the appalling truth that I had been cruelly betrayed. With a groan, as godlike and heroic as that of the great Caesar, when Brutus hit him a dig, I mentally folded my toga around me, and submitted to my fate. After binding my arms securely behind my back, I Gyas hoodwinked, a rope was tied around my neck, 'and I was led into a large room, which must have been brilliantly illuminated, for the darkness seemed to be of a much more subdued character. The other end of the cable around my neck was passed through a ring in the ceiling, and drawn taut.    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6867-00000099"/> 196         BOAZ: "Who are you," said I, "and what does all this mean?" "We are a number of married ladies,' whom you have scandalized in the most unpardonable manner, and we have invited you to this little symposium for the purpose of expostulating with you in regard to your unmanly conduct." "Ladies, I think you must be"-before I could com- plete the sentence, I shot up like a stone out of a cata- pult, and my head struck the ceiling with such force that one might have supposed those tender creatures were either trying to knock a hole through the ceiling, or burst one through the top of my head, and were not particular which. It was some seconds before I could realize the situation, but when I did, I began to think of what a splendid item our village editor would have the next morning, and to wonder whether or not my funeral would be a large one. I found myself sus- pended in mid air, and as I went up, two of those aw- ful females swung to my legs, and pulled against those at the other end of the rope, like two steam capstans run by a forty-horse power engine. My eyes popped so far out of their sockets, I thought they would never find their way back again. My tongue-well, I never dreamed I had so much of that article, until I felt it flopping against my naked bosom, (for during the cap- ture I parted company with my shirt as well as my coat,) and as I realized my exposed condition in the presence of those ladies, I blushed in shame. I tried to calculate which would break first, the rope, my neck, or the grip of those terrible women, who had hoisted me up. The chances seemed to be against my neck, but suddenly those two female capstans, who   HIS TRIBULATIONS.     197 pulled at my feet, as if they were working by contract at high wages, became too many for those at the other end of the rope, and I was brought to the floor once more. "What were you proceeding to remark just now," blandly said a sweet voice by my side, "when you suddenly concluded to climb that rope?" "I would like to know," said I, "who that indi- vidual was who enticed me into this den of"-an omi- nous pull on the rope persuaded me not to say she dragons, as I had intended. "She was a committee, appointed for thl purpose of inviting you to this little soiree, and it affords us much pleasure to welcome you to our midst." "I can't say that I reciprocate the"-a sudden tightening of that rope around my jugulum exhorted me very forcibly to pause and consider. Just then I heard the distinct raps of a gavel, and a dignified voice said, "Ladies, you will please come to order, and we will proceed with the business of the evening." It was really very comforting to know that the pre- vious proceedings were not in order, but I did n't have time to think much about the matter, for order was soon established and the same voice proceeded: "Mrs. Secretary, inform the accused of the charges against him."              * "Prisoner at the bar," said the Secretaryess, in tones at sweet as flowing honey, "you have been in- vited here to answer for having, under the name of Boaz, attempted to hold the married ladies of this community up to ridicule, and to make them "-here her voice deepened like angry thunder rolling through I    <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6867-00000100"/> 198         BOAZ: a silver-keyed flute"-a mark for scorn to point her slow unmoving finger at. What say you, guilty or not guilty?" "Not guilty, so help me Jupiter!" said I. "Mrs. Secretary, you will please read that article in the Rural Sun, of December 18, entitled, "Another Experience-Neither Agricultural nor Horticultural- by Boaz." "Ah, Boaz," thought I, when the chairess gave that order, "you are gone up now, and if you never shed tears before, prepare to shed them now." Mrs. Secretary, in tones firm and angry, but musi- cal as is Apollo's lute, proceeded to read my unfortu- nate article in the Sun. The meeting preserved very good order until she reached that portion where some delicate allusions are made to Mrs. Boaz waiting for the arrival of her magazine. Then their bottled wrath broke forth with such vehemence that the reading was continued with difficulty, and when the Secretaryess finally reached the point where my wife is said to have bounced out of the room wishing I would not try to be so smart, there was such a hubbub as no human ear ever heard before. It seemed to me that there were nine hundred thousand women present, every one vo- ciferously declaring that I meant that for her. Their angry passions seemed to gather fury from the noise they thade, and' right then and there they put me through a course of-I do n't know what, for I became demoralized, and lost my presence of mind so com- pletely that my innate antipathy for an untruth pro- hibits me from attempting to report that portion of the proceedings. I only know that, when they had finished with me, and the meeting came to order, I   IIS TRIBULATIONS.      199 had very serious doubts as to whetheror not there was a square inch of unbruised skin anywhere on my body. The reading proceeded, but was frequently interrupted by numerous unique expressions, such as female inge- nuity knows so well how to invent in order to make a fellow feel ashamed of himself. But the real cream of their vengeance was not in their endearing epithets? I verily believe that every woman in that house was armed and equipped with a basket full of brickbats, and every time one of them took any portion of the article to herself, she heaved a bat at my already used-up carcass. The misfortune was that every one of them thought that almost every thing in it was in- tended especially for her, and the consequence was that those bats, ranging in size from a half to a quarter of a brick (you see they meant business), rained around me most terrifically. My only salvation was in the fact that there is n't a woman in the universal creation who can throw well, and I therefore escaped any very serious injury. Another fortunate circumstance for me was that I was blindfolded, and did n't know when to dodge. If they had removed the bandage from my eyes, and got me to dodging, I am sure I should have dodged in the way of most of those bricks, and there would certainly have been a funeral in the Boaz family, but, as it was, I escaped that sad catastrophe. The reading finally came to an end, and the unfortu- nate author had nearly reached his finis also. I sup- pose theirtvengeance was fully satisfied by that time, and hoped they would retire then and let me go home to my little bed; but one very officious female rose, and said that, before adjourning, she desired to offer a resolution of thanks to the committee for the graceful    <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6867-00000101"/> 200         BOAZ: and able manner in which she had captured the pris- oner, and brought him before that honorable body. The resolution was enthusiastically carried unani- mously, and then that confounded committee got up to return her thanks for the resolution of thanks, which, she said, was so gratifying to her sensitive na- ture that language was totally inadequate to convey the slightest conception of how good she really felt. She then went on to give an account of the difficulties she encountered, and the distress she endured in the prosecution of her arduous task. She told how I had grossly insulted her by making love to her; how she had been compelled to submit to my loathsome squeez- ing; how she had even to encourage my outrageous pro- fessions of fondness in order to secure me in her toils, so as to lead me triumphantly before that right honorable conclave. Then she meanly repeated every endearing term I had used to her in our walk, and wound up by calling their attention to the fact that they had all heard me address her as "my darling" while they were binding my hands. The whole diabolical coun- cil was hugely disgusted at such conduct in any man of family, and one little woman, who, I'll bet my head, is jealous of her husband, called for volunteers to scalp me. The whole nine hundred thousand volun- teered instanter, and they went for my scalp, like hun- gry wolves after an unoffending lamb. Fortunately for me, none of that galaxy of beauty had a knife, and they could n't claw quite all the skin off the top of my head, but they didn't leave me a single hair. My stately cranium looked as if, it had been shaved and scarified, my nose was pealed, my eyes were blacked, my cheeks might have been taken for the battle ground \   HS TRIBULATIONS.     '201 of the Kilkenny cats, and my ears looked as if they had been marked with a swallow-fork and over and under bit in one, and a cross and two slits in the other. I was conquered, subdued, aye, cowed! and would gladly have entered into any required obligation that would have released me from that angelic host.' A full and humble apology was required for all I had written about that cursed thing which was neither agricultural nor horticultural. I made it with tears of penitence in my eyes, and swore that the whole thing was. an infamous lie. I wanted to say mistake, but they would n't be satisfied with such a mild expres- sion, which had originated in the vile brain of an un- regenerated man, and I was furthermore made to solemnly promise and swear that I would never, never, NEVER write or indite, print, publish, paint, engrave or sculpture, or permit any one else to do so, in my presence, anything, of any nature whatsoever, which might reflect upon the true dignity and manhood of woman. I was then led to the door and dismissed with the tender injunction to go and sin no more. I just had strength enough left to drag my carcass home, but there another calamity awaited me, and I fully realized how true it is that the way of the transgressor is hard. M]y wife did n't know me, and threatened to call the police to take me out. I begged her to hear me before doing so cruel a thing, and there was some- thing familiar in my voice which arrested her atten- tion. '  "-Mary,' said I, "do n't you remember the straw- berry mark on my left shoulder?" "Yes," said she. ' Well, here it is," said I, "and, my love, look at    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6867-00000102"/> 202         BOAZ: these two Irish potatoes on my right breast, and this very singular mark of the dish of bacon and greens on my stomach, and, my dear, I am sure you have not forgotten the print of that hot flat-iron which you acci- dentally slammed one morning on my naked foot, which you told me to take out of your way, and I did n't do it quick enough?" These proofs convinced my wife of my personal identity, and, like the Good Samaritan, she took me in and dressed my wounds. When she heard my nar- rative she was wrathy in the extreme, and the next morning she started out bright and early to find out who the perpetrators were, in order that they might be brought to the punishment they so justly merited. But the first fact which she discovered was my stroll with that diabolical committee. Of course she heard an exaggerated account of all I had said to the vixen, and she dropped her investigations right there. She quietly returned home, and, taking the children, went to her mother's, without bidding me adieu, or appris- ing me of her intention. In the course of the day she addressed me a little note saying I had better send for "the darling"I had picked up on the bridge the evening before, to dress my bruises. As to herself, she begged to be excused. "Thunder and lightning!" said I; "was ever a poor devil so persecuted before?" I sent immediately for Coots, discharged all my servants, tacked a card on my front door, notifying the public that I was not at home to anybody, and locked up the house. For two weeks Coots was my only companion, my only comfort, and, until the in- flammation in my many bruises began to subside, we ' ,ii   HS TRIBULATIO NS.      203 had a rare old time. Then it was that he came out in the fullness of his glory, and proved himself as near equal to the occasion as it was possible for any one in- dividual to be. There were times, during the first few days, when it required our combined powers to do justice to my wrath, but, in the course of time, I turned it all over to Coots, and tried to make myself as tranquil as possible. As soon as my face healed up I bought a wig, and went after my wife, with whom I succeeded in effecting a reconciliation. But I felt that I was the pitifullest, infinitessimal fraction of a man that ever broke a lance with a woman, and I do n't think 'any humbler individual ever ornamented the human race. I shall pause and consider very ma- turely before I ever touch such a tender subject as a bonnet again.    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6867-00000103"/> 204          BOAZ: CHAPTER XVIII. I Become a Reformer and Invent a new Process for the Prevention of Swearing-I Experiment upon my- self with Beautiful Effect-Encounter between Coots and my Mother-in-law-Coots Deserts-The reason why. I DO not think there can be a reasonable doubt in the mind of any one that there is a shocking blemish in the moral organization of every male member of the genus homo-as to the female members, the reader must really allow me to decline giving an opinion. This defect is made apparent in various ways, at various times, and sometimes profusely in a universal way. The man, or woman, therefore, who devises some new method for the purification of the male heart-that augean stable of vice, which has filled the moral world with epidemics ever since man had a heart-and thus enables him to hang out. a peg or two higher on the scale of perfection, is justly styled a reformer, and. is strung high and dry among those glorious individuals whose names " the world will not willingly let die." Joe Smith, Brigham Young, Victoria Woodhull and Tennie Claflin, are all parts of this class, whom an ad- miring world has strung together, and hung up to dry   HS TRIBULATIONS.      205 in the Temple of Fame, where they wave as gracefully as a string of onions in the kitchen corner. These philosophers are really the moral onions of the present century. One does n't take naturally to them. Both the taste and odor are at first rather trying, for it re- quires a cultivated taste to chew them, as one would roll a sweet morsel under his tongue. Present an onion to a man who has never seen one, and he will turn up his nose in disgust, but persuade him to rub his plate with it before eating, and he finds that his food has a more pleasant flavor than usual. The next time he eats he will want it rubbed again, and then he will try a beafsteak, or omelet, cooked in onions, but will scrape the onions to one side before transferring the morsel to his mouth, then he will bolt the onions with the steak, or eggs, and will finally take them straight and solus, boiled, fried, or raw-he isn't particular, so he gets the onions. It is just so with the philosophy of all great reformers, particularly of that school which I have just mentioned. Mankind snorts with indigna- tion, when he is first invited to partake, but, if he can be persuaded to stand awhile until it can be gently rubbed in, especially with the female hand, he will smack his lips, and swear it is n't half as bad as one would suppose. I wish the reader to understand that I do not speak from experience about these matters. I never ate onions; I never was a Mormon, and I never had a chance to practice the philosophy of Woodhull and Claflin. TI get my facts from a far more reliable source than experience; I draw them entirely from imagina- tion. I do n't know that Brigham and Victoria belong altogether to the same class of philosophers, but this is 10    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6867-00000104"/> 206         BOAZ: neither the time nor place to dispose of that question. They are undeniably reformers. I claim to be one my- self, and, if the world sees proper to hang me on the -same string with the worthies I have just mentioned, I bespeak a place next to Tennie, who, I have heard, is quite a good-looking woman. Yes, I am a reformer. I have invented a new system of purification for mankind, or rather I have made a new application of an old system, which is much in vogue in almost every field of labor. I mean the sys- tem of co-operation. I have so far applied it to only one of the warts on man's moral nature, but I have no doubt that it will eradicate others equally as well. I can best develop my system by giving a history of how I applied it to my own case, and the result of the ap- plication. There are two prominent features in the nature of man which have long engaged my attention. The first is that the heated temper of the individual man natur- ally secretes "cuss words," just as his parotid, sub- maxillary and sub-lingual glands secrete spit; and the second is that collective man, in the aggregated form of society so condemns this natural secretion of the individual man, that all forms of expression, whereby the male member eases off his direful ire, are considered contra bonos mores. Thus man collectively becomes disgusted with himself individually. For instance, the worldly-minded man grows angry with his fellow- being, and, in his fury, hits him a dig in the stomach, and says, "ID-n you, take that." Some deacon hears him and says;  "My friend, I am shocked at the use of such lan-   HS TRIBULATIONS.       207 guage. It is indecent in the extreme, and wicked be- yond measure." The worldly-minded man will at once, and unhesi- tatingly,acknowledge the corn, and agree with the deacon that he ought to be ashamed of himself. Awhile after perhaps that same deacon meanders along the highway, in the cool of the evening. His hands are clasped composedly in his rear; he joyfully inhales the fragrant breeze, as it fans -his brow, and "plays famil- iar with his hoary locks ;" he turns his eyes skyward, and his whole soul becomes rapt in contemplation of the starry hosts which sparkle above him like "a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid." Suddenly his feet come in contact with a cord which some boy has stretched across the road, and in the twinkling of an eye, his nose salutes the earth, and his lips go for a mouthful of dirt. As he rises with his proboscis in his hand, and hears that boy tittering beyond his reach, does he sing a psalm? Does he even call that boy back and offer him a nickel to buy candy? Not a bit of it. He blazes out, "Plague take the young rascal, he ought to be skun alive," and every feature of his coun- tenance proclaims, from Dan to Beersheba, that he would like to perform that little operation for him. As long as he is alone, he feels a wonderful relief in thus venting his spleen, but catch him in class-meeting, and let' some sister, who has witnessed the scene, re- mind him of the language he used, and he will imme- diately confess that he is an unworthy member, who is too pronie to kick against the pricks. There is no denying that the "cusseous" germ flourished in the heart of the deacon as well as in that of the worldly-minded man, and was doubtless a    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6867-00000105"/> 208          BOAZ: source of huge disgust to both, but particularly to the deacon, whenever caught in the act of yielding to its in- fluence. My proverbial modesty will not allow meto adopt the opinion, which is universally entertained by every one who knows me, that I am almost without a fault. The time was, however, when this was not thus, and I was convinced by the a posteriori system of reasoning, that my inner man contained a full assortment of those offensive germs, which frequently put forth such fruit as was shocking to ears polite. I have been wrestling with the attempt to eliminate them from my nature for, lo! these many years, and I think I have finally succeeded. The wonderful relief which I enjoyed from the ef- forts of that boy, Coots, on certain memorable occasions in my history, and the delicious tranquillity which afterward filled my soul, like the serene glory which the sun plasters over the heavens as he passes away, persuaded me that I could completely conquer my evil disposition, if I could get some irresponsible person to follow me through all the highways and byways of my terrestrial journey, and swear for me as occasion re- quired. The more I thought of it, the more I was pleased with the thought, and my earnest desire to get rid of this defect in my morals, determined me not to delay the execution of the scheme. I therefore hunted up Coots, and having thoroughly explained my plan to him, I said: "Now, Coots, how would you like to occupy this position on my staff? The duty is heavy, and the re- sponsibility great, but I think I can fully trust you with its performance."   \ HS TRIBULATIONS.      209 A grateful smile illumined the boy's countenance as he answered: It's jest de posish, Mister Boaz, dat will suit me to a t.

So, if you're in yearnest, I'm agreeabul." Thus the' bargain between us was concluded, but, as I am a man of methodical habits, I deemed it best to reduce our agreement to writing, and I therefore drew up and had Coots to sign the following CONTRACT. THIS INDENTURE, made the fifteenth day of Febru- ary, in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, between Boaz, of the city of Marksville, gentleman, of the first part, and Coots, also of the said city, small boy, of the second part, witnesseth that: WHEREAS, The said party of the first part is griev- ously afflicted at divers times with divers exacerbes- cences of temper, whereby the "cussiary" glands of his spiritual essence become unduly excited, thereby causing a plenteous flow of wicked, objurgatory exple- tives, which agitate his equanimity as a gentleman, and mar his peace of mind as a shining exemplar to the rising generation; and, whereas the said party of the first part longingly yearns to stop the "cusseous"    <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6867-00000106"/> 210          1 BOAZ: flow aforesaid, in order that he may be able to rear his head as a shining light to guide adventurous youths across this " vale of tears," but is grievously hampered in this laudable effort by his weakness of flesh, and the direful temptations of the devil; Now, therefore, be it known that the said party of the-first part hath bargained, assigned, transferred, set over and delivered, and by these presents doth bar- gain, assign, transfer, set over and deliver unto the said party of the second part, all and singular, the duty, service, business and office of abusing, *exe- crating, imprecating, maledicting and anathematizing each and every man, beast, reptile, fish, fowl and in- sect, also each and every event, incident, accident, oc- currence, and thing of any and every nature whatso- ever which may, can or shall afflict, torment, vex or torture the spirit of the party of the first part into the use of hateful, detestable, abominable and wicked words, or induce him to depart in any conceivable manner from that strict line of dignified rectitude which becometh a gentleman and a scholar, hereby ratifying and confirming whatever the said party of the second part shall lawfully do in the premises. And the said party of the second part, in considera- tion of the premises, and in further consideration of raiment in reason and rations in abundance, the first installment of which, viz.: a peck of raw oysters to him in ventre paid by the said party of the first part, -before the ensealing and delivery of these presents, the re- ceipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and also in consideration of the sum of one hundred dollars, to be paid at the expiration of this indenture, doth receipt the trust created, and in him reposed, by these pres-   HS TRIBULATIONS.       2" ents; and doth for himself, his heirs, executors, admin- istrators and assigns, covenant and agree to and with the said party of the first part, that he, the said party of the second part, will honestly and faithfully, and without delay, execute and perform all the duties and obligations herein entrusted to him, according to the best of his skill, knowledge and ability, during the full term of his natural life. And the said party of the second part doth further covenant and agree that he will never, at any time during the term of this contract, curse or swear any on his own account, without the knowledge, and consent previously obtained, of the party of the first part, and that he will at all times do and perform the services herein assumed by him with due caution and a reason- able degree of prudence, by which it is understood that he will never, never, never execrate, imprecate, anathe- matize or swear at any man, woman or child, what- ever may be the provocation given to the party of the first part by said man, woman or child, whose cor- poreity would reasonably indicate that both the party of the first part and the party of the second part, but particularly the party of the first part, would catch thunder in a fisticuff with the man, woman or child aforesaid. It is distinctly understood by and between the high contracting parties, that, should the party of the sec- ond part fail or become derelict in the performance of his dutifs, then the said party of the second part shall forever forfeit each and every consideration which he is to, receive, or has received, under this contract, ex- cept the peck of oysters to him already paid, which, for all practical purposes, shall be deemed and consid-    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6867-00000107"/> 212          BOAZ: ered non est inventus, and, therefore, not to be ac- counted for. In witness whereof, the parties to these presents have hereunto affixed their signatures, the day, month and year first above written. BOAZ, gentleman. His COOTS,  X  small boy. mark. APPENDIX. WHEREAS, The party of the second part, after due and mature consideration of the above contract, has remonstrated against that clause wherein it is provided that he shall never do any swearing on his own ac- count, and has insisted, with tears in his eyes, that the party of the first part has therein crowded him rather tight, and whereas the said party of the first part has no desire nor intention to take an undue advantage of the party of the second part, and scorns to mar his happiness by depriving him of any luxury which has apparently become a part and parcel of his nature, It is therefore understood and agreed that the said party of the second part shall have a vacation of one hour every Saturday evening, wherein he may indulge freely in such discursive harangues as may be indis- pensable to his peace of mind and tranquillity of soul. BOAZ, gentleman. His COOTS, X small boy. mark. These preliminaries having been arranged to the satisfaction of the high contracting parties, I fitted   HS TRIBULATIONS.       213 Coots out in a new suit of clothes, and he immediately entered upon'the actual performance of his duties. When the exultant Turk reposed "at midnight in his guarded tent," and dreams, "' as wild and gay of wing as Eden's garden bird," filled his soul with bliss, he little thought that Bozzaris was near at hand, ranging his Suliote band, and, ere an hour had passed, would put in an' appearance and take the stiffening out of him. Neither did Coots, when strutting along behind me, in all the pomp and circumstance of new clothes with brass buttons, dream that his path of glory might lead him to his grave, but he was in imminent danger of such a fate, for I was almost driven by the force of circumstances to snuff his candle out with a shot-gun ere he had been an hour in my service. After fitting him out as already described, we turned our footsteps homeward, and, just as we were entering the parlor, we encountered my wife, on her way out, arrayed in the bonnet upon which Coots had exercised his art in the manner which has heretofore been described. He recognized the bonnet at once, and I suppose the recollection of the many troubles it had caused me unconsciously brought out a cloudy ex- pression upon my countenance. Coots, of course, was on the lookout for an initiatory occasion to work off a few of his favorite forms of speech, and interpreted my change of countenance into a hint that then was his time to begin or never. I understood the threatened danger at a glance, and I never was so desperately frightened in my life. I was standing behind my wife and I deprecatingly shook my head at him so earnestly that- I was in danger of dislocating my vertebral column. I frowned, shook my fist at him, and went 10*    <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6867-00000108"/> 214         BOAZ: through the motions of choking him blue, if he opened his mouth. All these signs and contortions seemed to involve him in doubt as to what he should do. That moment of doubt saved me, for while he hesitated, I seized a shot-gun which was near by, and, cocking both barrels, leveled it at him, determined to shoot him down in his tracks if he said one word. The poor fel- low was so terribly startled that he lost his presence of mind, and did n't seem to understand whether I was going to shoot him for not opening his batteries, or to prevent him from doing so. While he was endeavor- ing to determine that question, my wife passed out of the house, wholly unconscious of the impending trage- dy, and relieved us both of a tremendous dilemma. Great beads of perspiration stood upon my brow, and so intense was the excitement under which I had la- -  bored that I wilted upon the sofa as lifeless as a shirt collar in a shower of rain. A rapid succession of whiskey straights soon brought me out as bright as a new dollar, and I then took Coots by the lappel of his coat, and, after leading him deep into the forest shades, where no eye could see nor ear could hear, I gave him a few confidential explanations in regard to my wife, and made him understand that we would both be as safe on a barrel of nitro glycerine with a quick match attached as within her reach, when all that is Roman in her gets thoroughly aroused. I never had occasion to repeat the caution. After this little episode, Coots and I got along ex- cellently well together. He was a lad of brilliant parts in his line of business, and the sagacity which he displayed in scenting out the embryotic oath, as it formed in my cerebral chambers, and in giving it a   HS TRIBULATIONS.       215 local habitation and a name, was truly wonderful. It was a reach beyond the limits of the most acute reason. Nothing, in short, but a glorious instinct, most glori- ously developed, could ever have enabled him to antic- ipate me so perfectly in giving expressions to my wrath the moment it gathered sufficient warmth to hatch an oath. Precisely at the right time he would in- variably snatch it up, and develop it into such magni- ficent proportions that I would become lost in grateful admiration of the boy's genius, and wonder if the world would ever see his like again. The moment Coots be- gan his lullabies, that identical moment the sudden blaze in my temper went out, and, instead of fussing and fuming for half an hour as I had formerly done, I was almost instantaneously restored to good humor. Who would not forget all the ills his temper is heir to, when an artist of such. merit is surrounding him with such gorgeous pictures of fancy? Where is the man who would feel like swearing another oath, when some friend catches up the burden of his song for him, and carries the tune in a style far more satisfactory than his? Having my anger thus constantly extinguished, almost the instant it blazed up, its life was in a manner paralyzed, and the paroxysms became less and less fre- quent, until I acquired a reputation for amiability that any male Griselda might well have been proud to own. My strict obedience to the third commandment is now a matter of public notoriety, and I have become as gloriousan exemplar to the profane of my acquaint- ance, as George Washington has ever been to the men- dacious youths of the nation. The consequence is that the peace which pervadeth my bosom passeth all un- derstanding, and I rejoice, with exceeding great joy, K'-    <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6867-00000109"/> 216         BOAZ:  at the happy stroke of genius, which induced me to contract for the services of Coots. It must not be supposed that my advance to this blessed state of purity was over a well-beaten pike. Difficulties innumerable beset me, and remonstrances, without number flew about my ears like forked light- ning about the bosom of a storm. My wife opposed the proceeding because no one had ever heard of such a thing before, and the whole town would be talking about it. I answered that, if novelty was an offense, then the creation of Adam and Eve was wrong, for I was sure no living man or woman had ever heard of anything like that previous to the actual occurrence, and, according to her theory, these respected progeni- tors of ours must have felt mean in the extreme, for doubtless Madam Grundy had oceans to say about their family at the time. I considered it my duty to do all in my power for Coots' mental and moral welfare, and I therefore taught him to read and to write a little, and I also at- tended several camp-meetings for his especial benefit. It was an inevitable corollary of our contract that he should follow me wherever I went, and when I marched into church with Coots behind me, there was quite a sensation, for he had never been known to venture in- side of a place of worship before. He thus became quite regular in his attendance, but, strange to say, some of the members thought it was a scandal, and were good enough to insist that I ought not to be countenanced in society, because, they said, I was setting a pernicious example; I was encouraging Coots himself in his career of sin; and our presence at church was an act of bravado, and a public advertise- -     'S    HS TRIBULATIONS.      217 ment of our mutual shame. I was fully prepared for all manner of comments, for history proves that all reformers, since the world began, have met with vitu- peration, and I could not, therefore, hope for an ex- ception. I bore it all with that patience and meek- ness, which my system had developed in my character, and waited for the time when I should be able to de- monstrate, not only my complete freedom from the habit of swearing, but also the entire reformation of Coots himself. My own conscience justified me in mly course. I could see that the system was having a most happy effect upon me, because I was rapidly improving in the purity of my language, and my fiery temper was growing as mild as that of the little lamb which Mary had. The only motive which actuated me in carrying Coots to church was the hope that some good seed might be sown in his callous heart, and would eventually bring forth good fruit. I knew that a number of vain efforts had been made by others to get him to church, and 'now, that I had accomplished the desired result, it seemed strange that I should be so cordially abused for it. It was evident, too, to the most casual observer, that Coots himself had vastly improved. A wholesome and abundant diet had filled out his lank form, and his cheeks were ruddy with the roses of health. He was decently dressed too, and there could be no question whatever as to the change for the better in the outer boy. The inner boy was also decidedly purer than it had been. Previous to his engagement in my service he had been a wild Arab of the streets, entertaining no respect for any person or thing, and his only occupation the invention of new and more forcible forms of speech to ornament his    <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6867-00000110"/> 218         BOAZ: favorite vocabulary. Now, however, he was under contract to do no swearing on his own account, except during his brief Saturday evening vacations, and as I had so improved that I very seldom had any swearing to do, it necessarily followed that Coots scarcely ever had an occasion to exercise his powers, and therefore very rarely indulged in his loved voca- tion. Thus the contract which we had entered into was a sort of a filterer, through which both of our na- tures were undergoing a purifying process, Was it not strange, therefore, that any reasonable creature under the sun should find aught to say against my ex- periment? Well, no, it isn't so strange either, for when a nation can so far forget its dignity and grati- tude as to refuse to make George Francis Train its President, or Victoria Woodhull, Chief Justice, I can not say that I am surprised at anything. When, therefore, I heard of such attacks upon my system as I have above described, I forgave the at- tacking party as I would forgive any idiot, and thought no more about it. There was, however, one trial which fell upon me like an Alpine avalanche, but which I trust I met and vanquished with becoming heroism. One morning my mother-in-law drove over to regu- late the matter. She brought her valise, and stayed a week for the express purpose of dislodging Coots. She did n't wait to get out of the buggy before she opened her batteries. "Boaz," said she, " what is all this I hearabout you and that creature Coots? It isn't possible that you have hired that boy to do your swearing! I wont be- lieve that a son-in-law of mine, with such a wife as Mary is, would do such a horrible thing. It's every   HS TRIBULATIONS.       219 word true is it? Well it's a sin and a shame that any decent man should introduce such a vile creature into the bosom of his family. He will corrupt the morals of all your children, and- He has nothing to do with your children, nor the bosom of your family you say; it's only with you? Well it's a wonder the earth do n't open and swallow you up at every step. You always thought every thing was swallowed down, and you do n't see how the earth could swallow you more than once? Boaz, you are enough to aggravate the patience of a saint. I never saw such a man in my life. You never have appeared to be in your right senses since the war. I. think a bombshell must have bursted close to your head, and jarred your brain out of place some way, for you are nigher crazy than any man I ever saw out of the asy- lum. I never would have believed that I should live to see the day when my son-in-law would take up a gallows-bird out of the street, and pay him, yes, actu- ally pay him the money that Mary ought to have, to do his cursing. You will all wake up some morning and find your throats cut from ear to ear, and. all your silver gone, for I know that boy belongs to a band of robbers and assassins. And that's Coots is it? Do n't you look at me you horrible wretch, you-you-imp of Satan. If I were in Mary's place I would n't stay a minute under the same roof with a man who would harbor such a creature as that-- Why did I come here then and bring all my clothes with me? I have n't brought 'em all, you know I have n't, and, if I have, it is only tlat I may stay long enough to put a stop to such a scandalous thing in a Christian community. You are afraid my husband will miss me more, if I stay, than you will if I go straight back home? That's nice language    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6867-00000111"/> 220         BOAZ: for a gentleman to use to his mother-in-law, ain't it? You learned that from Coots, did n't you? But you need n't expect to run me off with any such insinua- tions, for I'm not going. I intend to stay right here; yes, sir, right here, just as long as I please, if it kills me. You wish it would? That's right; that's another one of Coots' lessons I suppose, it was surely he that taught you to abuse the woman who has been the mak- ing of you. If I made you such as you are why-should I quarrel with you? O! you ungrateful scamp. I'll have you to know, sir, that I do n't quarrel with any- body. I never did such a thing in my life, and I never made you what you are either. It's a slander upon me to say so. I tried to make something decent of you, but I am sorry to say I never succeeded. If I had n't been a saint on earth you would have broken my heart long ago. You wish Iwas -I was a saint in heaven f- Now ain't that a nice wish for a gentleman to make of a lady? You wish that Mary, the wife of your bosom, the mother of your children was a sorrowing orphan. O! the depravity of the human heart! But who could expect anything better from the Coots family? Boaz, mark what I tell you, the time will come when you will repent in sackcloth and ashes, and you will wish-" I did n't hear what it was I would wish, for just here I inveigled her through the front door, which I imme- diately closed between us, and I then sat down to re- view the situation, while she passed on to put Mary, through a course of motherly instructions. It was surely the whisperings of a masterly genius, which suggested that the most effectual way of spiking my mother-in-law's batteries would be to quit the pre-   HS TRIBULATIONS.      221 mises, and leave her alone in her glory. The reader will at once perceive what a vast progress I had made toward perfection, when I tell him that I did not once lose my good temper, nor breed a "cusseous" thought during the whole of her harangue, and I could see that Coots was hugely disgusted at what he considered my milk and water disposition. I immediately aban- doned the house, and another half hour found Coots and me comfortably quartered at the hotel, whence I dispatched a note to my wife, stating that my experi- ment was at that time acting beautifully, and, as I felt sure that her mother would wreck all the good which had been accomplished, and would certainly start me to swearing again even with Coots to help me, if I remained at home, I would not return until she had gone. This situation of affairs continued for several days. In the meantime my shirt became soiled, and my undergarments needed changing. I therefore sent a servant to ask my wife for some clean clothes. Un- fortunately my mother-in-law was on the lookout for a capitulation of some kind, and was the first to see the messenger. She therefore intercepted him before he reached the house, and asked his business. "Mr. Boaz sent me for some clean clothes, mam," answered he. "Well, do you go back and tell Mr. Boaz he can stay where he is until he rots before he shall have any clean clothes from here, and if I catch you inside of this yard again, I'll make you wish you never had heard of -Mr. Boaz. Now trot." He trotted, and soon reported the result of his inter- view. That little episode, in connection with that which had previously occurred, tempted me very    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6867-00000112"/> 222         BOAZ: strongly to make a few remarks. I could stand the banishment from the comforts of home; I could bear the agony of a separation from my wife and children, but to be thus cruelly deprived of a clean shirt, was crowding the mourner to an extent that was danger- ous. Coots pricked up his ears, and began to lick his lips, as if getting them ready for action, but I had ac- quired a sufficient control over my temper to hold it in check, even under all these provocations. I therefore bought a change of linen, and patiently waited on the course of human events. I remained at the hotel about a week, frequently reconnoitering my premises for the purpose of finding an opportunity to slip in, unpor- ceived by my mother-in-law, to see how things were going on at home. I crawled up to the door one night at half past twelve, and she was in the parlor singing "How tedious and tasteless the hours." I peeped in at the window again just before daylight, and found her sitting before the fire, in my wife's bed- room, making a cup of coffee. Slip in indeed! One of old Pluto's boarders might as well have hoped to- find Cerberus asleep, and slip out. One day, however, I saw two ladies come out of the house, and walk off down the street. One of them I immediately recog- nized to be my wife by her bonnet, and the other I felt sure was her mother. I watched them until they had passed out of sight, and then I darted for the door, with Coots at my heels. But I had missed the figure decidedly. That second female was not my mother-in-law, for when I exultantly entered, there she sat, as large as life and twice as natural. When she saw me a grim smile of satisfaction stole over her   HS TRIBULATIONS.      223 countenance, in the order of the smile which the lady lion gets up when her keeper throws her a quarter of beef for breakfast. "O yes," she began, "I've starved you out have? I thought you would come to your senses after awhile, and you would hurry home to beg my pardon, but you can't get it, until you kick that imp out of the house. You wont do it f Then I will, you miserable, cowardly, disrespectful wretch. If Mary do n't quit you and ap- ply for a divorce before another day passes over your head, it will be because she has lost all respect for the counsels of her mother. How would you like that, eh? You know every cow you've got is hers, and you 11 feel nice when the sheriff comes to drive them to my house, and so seize every thing else you have to pay her what you owe her, wont you?" I had borne with her as long as I possible could, and I therefore turned to Coots and sternly said: "Do your duty sir, and do it well." The great Nebuchadnezzar! how that boy went off. My first impression was that the Devil's magazine of unsaintly words had exploded, for I never dreamed that so small a boy could hold such a mass of " cus- seous " matter. I thought he had done all that a hu- man being could do, when I called upon him to exer- cise a little pleasantry over the bonnet, but Coots could n't possibly have been a human being, for he surpassed his former effort so vastly and with such ease that no man who heard him could longer doubt his paternity. It must be remembered, however, that I had been holding him in check for a long time, and. that on the present occasion he had some of it to do for himself as well as for me. His whole heart and    <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6867-00000113"/> 224         BOAZ: soul were thrown into the exercise, and he made the fur fly at every broadside. The old lady was not ex- pecting such an onslaught, and was therefore taken completely by surprise. At the first volley she heaved an immense "Ugh!" as if a chunk of ice had suddenly slipped down her bosom. Then she snapped her eyes and worked her lips, like she was trying to say some- thing and could n't. Her face glowed with fury. She tried to put in a word or two, but Coots rolled it out so fast and furious that she gave it up in despair. She then went for his hair, but she might as well have at- tempted to catch a humming bird when feasting on the nectar of flowers. Round and round the room she chased him, making desperate lunges at his head, whenever an opportunity offered, but missing every time. Then she changed her tactics and tried to knock his brains out with every thing she could get hold of. Books, flower-vases, poker and tongs were all brought into requisition and hurled one after another at his de- voted head, but all minus their mark, and at every failure her fury seemed to gather increase a hundred fold. She foamed at the mouth, and fumed at the nose. Her hair fell down, and her cap came off and floated round promiscuously, being prevented from falling by one of the strings which caught in her breast- pin. I never saw such a picture of rage. It was not possible for any human being to bear up long under such a pressure of excitement, and she finally clasped her hands across her stomach as if it hurt her, and fell upon the floor in a sort of an epileptic fit. But Coots, who had warmed to his work, as the battle ad- vanced, didn't pause even then to ask how she felt, or if he could do anything for her. The rascal just kneeled   IS TRIBULATIONS.       225 over her, and, placing his lips to her ears, gave her, an extra touch of the fancy kind, which brought her to, and she rose to her feet looking as fierce as a tigress at bay. I feared she would in the end prove too many for Coots, but my fears were of short duration. The expression of her countenance charged from fury to fear, and, wildly striking out a back-handed lickwhich took him in the mouth and knocked him cold for a moment, she fled like old parson Bullen when the "hell-serpents" were chasing each other up his legs. All signs of the strife were soon cleared away, and when my wife returned she found me seated in my favorite rocking chair, with my heels on the banisters, reading Salad for the Solitary, while Coots was plait- ing a raw-hide whip for one of the boys. Mary greeted me most affectionately, but looked very much puzzled over the situation. After putting away her things she came out and asked what had become of her mother. "She thought the Colonel must be getting anxious about her by this time, and concluded to go home, I relieve," answered I. "That is strange," said Mary, "she had no idea of leaving when I went out, and her valise is still in the room." "Yes, she requested me to tell you that you needn't trouble about the valise, she would send for it when convenient. A neighbor passed, and she jumped in the buggy witlihim. Yqu should know the old lady is getting very changeable in her notions." There-was a doubtful expression on Mary's counte- nance, as if she suspected that I had dislodged the old lady by some flank movement, or coup d' etat, but she held her peace and waited for future developments. It    <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6867-00000114"/> 226          BOAZ: is scarcely necessary to add that the old lady never put her finger in the Coots pie again. Such were the difficulties I had to encounter, but I consoled myself with the thought that the past was thick with the graves of martyrs in the cause of science and progress, and I felt that I ought, therefore, to bear with abuse and slander. I could see that a very marked change was going on in Coots. He seemed to have become aware that there was a serious phase in life. He became very sedate, and often, while I was busily engaged in my office, he would sit and gaze by the hour upon the placid skies, as if he were endeavoring to pierce the depths beyond and grasp the mysteries of the spirit land. I dan't know that I ever derived a greater satisfaction from anything in my life than I did from this change in Coots, for I felt satisfied that the various camp-meet- ings I had taken him to, were having a good effect, and that, in the course of time, I should have the sat- isfaction of presenting him to our detractors as a thor- oughly reformed boy. I noticed, however, that when- ever a disagreement occurred between me and any of my visitors about matters of business, and there ap- peared to be the slightest prospect of my falling into a swearing mood, the whole nature of the boy would instantly change. His cheeks would flush, his eyes sparkle, his lips part, and he would gaze into my eyes with all the eagerness of a miner in search of diamonds. And when the disagreement was amicably settled, and my temper remained as calm as a dreaming oyster he would sigh like one who sees and feels the utter deprav- ity of mankind, and fall again into the listless condi- tion I have described. I fondly attributed this change   HS TRIBULATIONS.      227 in the boy to the fear that I was going to call on him to perform a duty which was growing offensive to the better nature which was springing up within him. I thought several times I would broach the subject to him in order to encourage him, and to give him any little spiritual advice he might require. I concluded, however, it would be best to wait until he should vol- untarily open his heart' to me, which I was sure he would do in the course of time, and in this I was not mistaken. One morning Coots failed to make his appearance as usual, and I sent to his room to know if he was sick. The servant soon returned and informed me that he was not there, and that his bed did n't appear to have been occupied the night before. I then went to see for myself, and sure enough Coots was gone. In looking around the room I found the following letter, which he had left for me: dere Mister boaz. i taik mi pen in han to rite you a fu lines to tell you goodbi, fur i'me agoin'.

I haven't heard of him since, but we shall probably meet again, if he has n't gone to his fathers. I am sorry he left, for I should like to have seen my system work on him a little longer. I know it is a grand success. I have, not patented it, and I hope, therefore, that the afflicted will use it freely. Let -any two men, who desire to try it, form a contract in which each one binds himself to do the other's swearing, and never to do any on his own account, and, if they will stick to their contract, and hang together long enough, I will bet a million that they will become so good-natured in the end that they will never breed a damn, and their lives will be- come as serene and beautiful as the moonlight sky.    HS TRIBULATIONS.      229 CHAPTER XIX. Mary Becomes an Invalid-I Travel with her in Search of Health-Some Experience with Quackesses. I PASSED through the winter like one who feels that his days are numbered, and watches his approaching end with philosophical equanimity. I was satisfied- that Mary's purchase of the spring bonnet would wind up my earthly affairs, and I therefore proceeded to "put my house in order" that I might "shuffle off this mortal coil" with as much comfort to my family, as the nature of the circumstances would permit. Through the instrumentality of Coots my evil disposi- tion took to itself wings and flew away, and, having insured my life for large amounts in several safe com- panies, I waited calmly for the end. But when winter had dragged his slow length away, and spring -had crowned the earth with flowers, Mary had become a shadow of her former self, and was too much of an invalid to vex her spirit with the vanity of fashionable bonnets. Summer came, and forest, field and orchard hailed his advancing steps with flowers and fruits, like joyful subjec s offering voluntary tribute to their passing lord. "    <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6867-00000116"/> 230          BOAZ: Sunny skies were overhead, and soft breezes from the Gulf brought freshness upon their wings, and diffused a grateful coolness through the land, but Mary contin- ued to droop like a flower whose petals were wither- ing in the summer's sun. Medical skill, from the most scientific to the most quackerific, was tried in vain. The regular faculty ex- hausted itself upon her, and hosts of quacking females prescribed to no purpose. But the curative remedies of the latter class seemed to be countless, and as fast as one failed it was decided that a hundred more must be tried. I determined, therefore, to "throw physic to the dogs," and to try what virtue there was in a change of climate and scenery. I endeavored, how-, ever, to keep this determination a secret, because there were just one thousand and one female herb dispensers and nostrum drenchers in the neighborhood, every one of whom had put in a prescription, and was sure that her remedy was working wonders for the sufferer. I felt satisfied that as soon as it became known that my wife was going away for the summer, every one of the, thousand and one would come charging in, each with a gallon or more of truck for her to take during her tour, and the result might prove fatal before we could get away. Trunks were therefore packed with all pos- sible haste. Parting adieux were said to the friends and relatives in the secret, and we started for the nearest port on the river side. But our secret had un- fortunately escaped, the news of our departure had gone abroad, and we were just driving off When out the hellish legion, sallied, and came pouring in from every quarter. I seized the   HS TRIBULATIONS.      231 reins and drove off at full speed, but they were loth to let their prey escape, and followed us Wi monie en eldrich screech and hollow, shaking their bottles of ptisans at us, and endeavoring to stop us to take them aboard. For more than a mile the race was kept up, and as we took a parting view behind us they were scattered along the highway like straggling troopers in the rear of an army. While making preparations for our journey there was one harrowing thought, which tormented me ter- ribly. We might free ourselves of our home ptisan- ists, but was there a spot anywhere between the South Pole and Greenland's icy mountains which they did not infest? Would we not find them by the dozen on the cars and boats, in the hotels and at the watering places, and, having found them, was it within the bounds of possibility to dodge them? These were grave questions, and the more I debated them with myself the more hopeless I became. I pictured a fresh half dozen of these tea-drinking medicine-women gathering around my wife at every stopping place, each with a bottle of medicine and a funnel, determined to drench her in spite of all the world, and I was almost mad- dened by the thought. In a moment of desperation I bought a pair of brass knuckles, a bowie-knife, a six- shooter and a sword-cane, and I swore a huge oath that I would make a ghost of every mother's son of the whole breed and generation that ared draw a bottle or pill-box on her. When I b ame a little cool, however, the possibility that this might be con- strued into a criminal offense, induced me to pack my instruments at the bottom of the trunk, lest I might    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6867-00000117"/> 232          BOAZ: hastily snatch them out and go for the females afore- said, with a zeal and vim which would not be alto- gether conducive to their health. I will here take occasion to remark that I have man- aged to pick up quite a smattering of criminal law, and I do most positively assert that the killing of a traveling quackess, who pounces upon the unfortunate invalid, and forces him to take medicine in order to get rid of her, is neither murder nor manslaughter, nor even a mild breach of the peace. Malice is the essence of all crime. Without the malicious intent there can be no offense, and suspicious and uncharita- ble beyond all conception must be the mind which can attribute a malicious intent to the hand which puts an end to the ministrations of the traveling female nos- trum drencher. He is rather a public benefactor, and the legislature of every State ought to reward every man, who snuffs one out, with at least a month's handling of the public money. Any man who can't earn an honest independence in that time out of the public crib has no one to blame but himself. I have frequently been tempted to try my brass knuckles and bowie-knife promiscuously on these specimens of the genus mulier, but the innate benevolence 'of my char- acter would never permit me to wipe out even a "blue tail fly," and respect for the views of so small a num- ber as even twelve of my fellow-men, who might not see the thing in the same light that I do, has so far deterred me. This is an age of progress in law as well as in other sciences, and I have no doubt that the time will come when the muliericide will be fully pro- tected by the plea that the subject upon whom he operated was a traveling quackess.   HS TRIBULATIONS.       233 By dint of hard driving we escaped the gentle min- istrations of those we were leaving behind us, but per- haps to run into the arms of others, who were some- where lying in wait for the unwary. We reached the river in due time; and, just as the light of day was fading in the west, we hailed a passing steamboat and were borne away on our journey. The moment we en- tered the ladies' cabin I saw that the ever-present herb- dispenser was there. She was a middle-aged woman with a hatchet face and a nose like " the tower of Lebanon that looketh toward Damascus." She wore a muslin cap and carried a home-made calico reticule of huge proportions, in whose depths was doubtless stored truck enough to kill a regiment. She sported a pair of silver spectacles on her forehead, and when we entered she was enter- 4   taining one of the ladies with the endless details of a most remarkable case, which the doctors could tell nothing about, but which she took in hand and cured sounder than Adam was the day he was born. We afterward learred that she had ferreted out all the little ailments of everybody on board, and had pro- vided each one with a remedy which she knew would speedily knock her disease into kingdom come. All of her conversation had been of terrible diseases and her wonderful cures, until she had exhausted the patience of all her hearers. There was a peculiar gleam of sat- isfaction in her eye as she marked the frail appear- ance of miy wife, followed by a succession of compla- cent nods which emphatically proclaimed that she thor- oighly understood the case, and she began to open that reticule as if to get at the only remedy in the world which could possibly do any good. I hurried my wife into her room in order to escape the attentions ' 11*    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6867-00000118"/> 234         BOAZ: of this ,Esculapiusess, and every time I went out I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket. It was amusing to see how she watched that door in the hope that she might find an opportunity to bounce in and offer her prescriptions. She was the last to bed that night and was up at her post by times the next morning. I overheard her asking the chambermaid if she knew anything about the sick lady in No. 5, where was she going, what was the matter with her, and would n't she like a little strengthening tea, but that functionaryess couldn't give her any information whatever. After breakfast my wife felt so much better that she concluded she would sit awhile in the ladies' saloon. How the old quackess' eyes gleamed with satisfaction, and what radiant smiles played bopeep at one another under her nose when she saw that the coveted oppor- tunity was hers at last. "Ahem!" said she sliding up, but neither of us no- ticed her gentle exclamation. "Are you sick?" she asked, touching my wife on the shoulder. I replied at once in French, which stumped the old lady, for she had not counted on being unable to make herself understood. "Ah!" said she, "you no speakey de Englis?" "We no speakey de Englis," I replied. She looked extremely blank and terribly distressed at missing such an opportunity to dose a fellow creat- ure. She appealed to the ladies present to know if any of them could speak French and would interpret for her; but none of them understood a word of the language. She then concluded she would try the lan-   IS TRIBULATIONS.      235 guage of signs. She pointed to my wife, then threw herself back in her chair, and put on a woebegone look in the attempt to feign sickness, roused up and pointed to my wife again. I gave an assenting look. She im- mediately took a bottle and spoon from her ,reticule, went through the motion of pouring out a spoonful and drinking it, then handed both to me. I took them and began to pour out a dose of the stuff; She seemed highly delighted at having made herself understood, and remarked that if she could n't speak the lingo she could do the next thing to it. Having poured out the medicine, I placed the bottle on a table, and quickly slipped the spoon in the old lady's mouth, and gave her the dose before she suspected my intention. She sputtered at a furious rate amid the half suppressed )   laughter of the ladies, and glaring at me, savagely said: "What did you do that for? I did n't tell you I was sick and wanted you to give me the medicine. I asked you if the lady was sick, and told you to give it to her." I shrugged my shoulders and shook my head to sig- nify that I didn't understand a word of what she said. She then tried her signs again, punching vigorously with her finger toward my wife, to whom I said in French: "She wants you to pour the medicine for her instead of me." -Sho therefore poured out the dose, and while the old lady was expatiating on the virtues of her truck, I took the spoon and went for her mouth again, but she noticed me in time to dodge, and I lodged the contents    <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6867-00000119"/> 236          BOAZ: of the spoon plump in her ear. She shook her head like a poodle-dog does his when ducked in the water, and the contents of her ear ran in a dark stream down her neck and stained her clean linen collar. "  You miserable foreign fool," said she, " can't you understand anything? I told you to give it to your wife to drink, not to pour it out for me. I'm well. I do n't want any medicine." I bowed around her as polite and spouted French as fast as a Parisian, making profuse apologies for the accident, but restraining myself with difficulty from joining in the laugh which went the round at her ex- pense. She did n't trouble us any more during the trip, but she had so far benefited my wife as to furnish her with food for amusement for several days, and to bring out the first hearty laugh I had seen her indulge in during several months past. We were now moving swiftly over the turbid waters of the Mississippi, sometimes passing, sometimes meet- ing steamers of all characters, hurrying like ours on their destined courses, and the interchanging salutes of the whistle, as they glided by, reminded me of stately gentlemen of the old school politely doffing their hats to each other on the highway. Now we pass a new formation of alluvial soil thickly overgrown with willow and cottonwood, and now a forest of grand old trees, from many of which the trailing moss waved in the passing breeze like signals of God-speed from well wishing friends. Now what was once a lordly planta- tion comes in view. There is the stately dwelling ris- ing above an orange grove, yonder the white-washed quarters nestling like a modest village in a grove of   HS TRIBULATIONS.      237 giant oaks, and in the rear the huge sugar-house with its tall chimneys reaching high above every surround- ing object. These are past, and the swift rush of our boat brings us to some old town which seems to have been finished long ago, and can scarcely "hold its own" in the struggle with the odds against it. Verily, the ancient glory of the Mississippi coasthasdeparted. The spirit of ruin sits in her beautiful places, and slowly dims their lustre like the hand that plucks the queen of roses, and idly scatters its petals by the way- side. The wealth that was used so lavishy in culti- vating and ornamenting these splendid sugar estates, which were once the pride of Louisiana, is gone, and their proprietors live and move among their faded glories, Comfortless as when a father mourns His children. Past these melancholy evidences ofa lost prosperity, our steamer held its way, and in due course of time reached New Orleans. We changed our quarters to a sleeping car on the New Orleans, Mobile and Texas road, and were soon whirling away with almost magic speed. Over morass and lake, across bayous and creeks, through swamps and highlands, by farms and villages we rolled on our way, but rested so comfortably in the palace car that we noted not the changing scenes through which ve were passing. When we retired at night my wife was the only lady in the sleeping car, but on rising the next morning we ' found quite a number of others who had joined us at Mobile, and among them the inevitable quackess with her magazine of domestic remedies. She hailed from ,It    <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6867-00000120"/> 238          BOAZ: some remote creek bottom in Mississippi, had been to Mobile to pilot a gang of grandchildren through the measles, was now on her way home, and was more than anxious to shoot a pill, or drench, at any suffering fel- low-creature who might come in her way. Modesty does n't prevail as an epidemic among that class of fe- males; if there was ever a sporadic case even I never heard of it. The specimen we had aboard had no hesitation about "paddling her own canoe" into any port that suited her purpose,- and was ready at a mo- ment's notice to treat anything from a corn, or a colic, to hydrophobia, or cerebro-spinal meningitis. In just five seconds and a half after the apartment of my wife had been arranged for the day, this female nostrum drencher flopped herself into the opposite seat beside me, and proceeded to make a'diagnosis of the case. "Sick?" said she. "Are you really sick, madama?"I replied, affecting to misunderstand her. "Troubled with worms, I sup- pose? Yes, I might have known it without asking, for any one can see that you are wormy from your looks, and I would n't be surprised if you have a spasm in less than fifteen minutes. Let me insist'that you will instantly- apply a plaster of coal oil and tar along your spine; it is the finest remedy for worms the world ever saw." "I didn't say anything was the matter with me. Bless your soul I never had worms in my life, but do tell me, is a plaster of coal oil and tar on the back really good for such things?" "It is an infallible remedy of recent discovery, and is not yet known to the medical profession." "Well, really now, who'd a thought it?" said she.   HS TRIBULATIONS.      239 "I mean to try it on the first case of worms I have. But what is the matter with you, my dear?" turning to my wife. "Nothing more than a common case of trachelypod- ous tylosis," answered I. "Oh, yes I I thought she looked liked she had some- thin' of that sort. One of our Mournin's chillern had it onct. Mournin, you know, is my daughter, and she spent a powerful site of money with the doctors on that chile, but they could n't do nothin' for it, so I tuck her in hand and cured her as sound as a dollar in litler ur no time." "Did Mournin's child have terrible pains in the top of her head and the soles of her feet, and the palms of her hands?" "Oh, yes!" "Did she break out in blisters all over her back and legs, and get sick at the stomach, and roll up her eyes and chaw the bedclothes when the fever was on her?" "Yes-them's the symptoms eggsactly." "Then she did n't have the trachelypodous tylosis, for my wife has never had any symptoms like these." "Well, what kind er symptoms does she have, then ." "Every kind you can think of except the sort which Mournin's child had." "Poor thing f I've seen 'um that way often, and kill tell you how to fix up somethin' that will fetch her out in no time. You jest take the cud outen a sucklin' cow and bile it down with poke root and hoarhoun', and drink a tumblerful three times every day, and I jess know it 'll cure her."    <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6867-00000121"/> 240         BOAZ: "Oh, I've tried that. I drank a barrel of it last winter, and it did n't help her a bit." "Well I spose it did n't, if you drunk it." "But she drank a barrel and a half herself, and it did n't seem to have any effect." Well, rve got a bottle of cordial in my pocket which is powerful strenthenin', and if you'll jess drink a tumblerful, my dear, you'll sleep like a new-born babe." ( She needs rest more than she does medicine. Por- ter," said I to that functionary, who was passing, "I wish you would arrange these seats into a bed. My wife wishes to lie down again. Madame will you be so kind as to move, so that the porter can execute my order?" She went to her apartment, and I then sat down, telling the porter that he need not trouble himself about the bed. Our she-quack took the hint and did n't in- trude upon us again. On, on we whirled through forest, field and village, and on the second day from New Orleans we reached the residence of an old friend and chum of former days,'whom I had not seen for years. A week at his beautiful place was more than worth all that medical skill and science had been able to effect for my wife. The cordiality and kindness with which she was wel- comed enabled her to enjoy everything around her to the fullest extent. The ice in profusion, the orchard of choice fruit, the rides in the cool evenings along the shady roads, the walks over the green meadows where the fine cattle browsed, and the gay company which gave no time nor opportunity for gloomy thoughts, were curative agents more effective than any in the   IS TRIBULATIONS.       241 pharmacopoeia of the medical faculty. A week in the midst of these social pleasures, and then away to Beer- sheba, that beautiful summer loitering place for in- valids among the mountains. We arrived there just as the parting light of the sun was bathing the moun- tain heights in a flood of golden beauty, and my wife's exclamations of pure delight at every thing which met her view encouraged me to believe that her stay there would be of incalculable benefit. The next morning, however, I had a terrible scare. We had dressed for breakfast and were waiting for the summons of the bell, when there came a knock at our chamber door, which was immediately opened by my wife, and there stood the longest, lankest specimen of the genus mulier I had ever seen, "I-s y-o-u s-i-c-k?" came drawingly through the door in a voice which sounded like misery long drawn out. I felt a good deal like one must feel who sits on a bombshell, and hears the hissing fuse slowly burn- ing its way to the powder beneath him, for I thought another female quack had found us out and was about to besiege us with her stock of herb and root teas. A detailed account of the ailments she had treated, in a voice like that, would have given Hercules the hys- terics, and would have been as sure a shot at a person of ordinary nerves as a bath of carbonic acid gas. I immediately determined to leave as soon as breakfast was oyer, but, by the time I had reached that conclus- ion, she had taken on a fresh head of breath, and stfarted in again. "I t-h-o-u-g-h-t H'-d c-o-m-e a-r-o-u-n-d t-o s-e-e i-f y-o-u h-a-d a-n-y w-a-s-h-i-n-g t-o d-o." The relief was inexpressible, and I went to breakfast 12    <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6867-00000122"/> 242         BOAZ: with an appetite which enabled me to do justice to the bill of fare. The month we spent at Beersheba passed almost like a dream. There was nothing to mar the pleasures which welled up around us in perennial springs, and from morn till night there was a continued succession of delights. We, who had been accustomed all our lives to a country almost perfectly level, never tired of clambering along the mountain sides and drinking in the serene beauty which met us at every step, some- times with a companion, but more frequently alone. I would follow some rude path which led me along the brow of the mountain, until I became wearied, and then I would lie at full length upon a smooth rock in some shady nook, and dream away the passing hours. Far below me the narrow valley reposed in tranquil  beauty, and beyond rose a range of mountains whose tops were radiant with the glory of a summer's sun. Overhead Far clouds of feathery gold, Shaded with the deepest purple, gleamed Like islands in a dark blue sea, while others sailed before the breeze, and, passing be- neath the sun, cast, upon the green side of the moun- tain, shadows which chased each other in silence, like , idling truants from the spirit land. Far away in the circumambient air floated listless birds, Now shaving with level wing the vale, then Soaring up the cerulean concave towering high, - and ever and anon, in their circling flight, flashing   HS TRIBULATIONS.      243 gleams of splendor from their plumage. Soft-blowing winds cooled the brow, and the dream-like music Of that strange lyre whose strings The genii of the breezes sweep, filled the ear with melody, and, by some strange mes- meric influence, seemed to bring the soul into com- munion with nature and enabled it to hear and under- stand the myriad voices which rose from tree and flower, from rock and rill, from mountain and valley, and, blending in a glorious anthem, floated up to the throne of the Most High. Steeped in the delicious sensations which these commingled influences engen- dered, the mind seemed to throw off for the time its mortal tenement, and soaring aloft, revelled in the am- brosial light which poets tell us bathes the spirit land in splendor. Cares were forgotten, pains were unfelt, and dreams of strange beauty, in which visions of the past were sweetly blended, thronged upon the brain and filled the heart with that "perfect peace which passeth all understanding." Thus the pleasant summer passed quickly away. The bracing airs of the mountains restored the bloom to Mary's cheeks, and we returned once more to our southern home to buffet the restless waves which beat against the shores of life. I must here close the narrative of my tribulations. Though my experience convinces me that the immortal Job was right when he said, ' Man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble," yet, there are times when favoring gales waft him onward, and Hope colors his future with her loveliest tints.
